Indonesian officials have reported that as much as 80% of the fires are caused by large-scale clearing of forests for plantation land. The remaining 20% are due to the traditional slash-and-burn practice by farmers. Given the prolonged drought in Indonesia, reported to be its worst in 50 years, many of these fires have spread to surrounding areas and raged out of control. The resulting smoke haze is very widespread, affecting Singapore and the neighbouring countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smoke haze problem is a matter of very serious concern to the Government and to all Singaporeans. It puts the health of our population under threat, and it can have major repercussions on our economy. The Government has therefore acted swiftly and decisively on the issue. We have raised the transboundary haze issue with the Indonesian authorities, both on a bilateral basis and in regional meetings. We began doing so long before the start of the current haze episode. Aside from registering our concerns with the Indonesian authorities and urging them to take effective actions to curb the haze problem, we have also offered our cooperation and assistance in tackling the problem. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1678</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a major step to curb burning by plantation owners, President Suharto announced an indefinite ban on land clearing by burning on 9th September 1997, and plantation owners were threatened with suspension of their licences and other legal action if they defied the ban. Also, at the opening ceremony of the 7th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on the Environment in Jakarta on 16th September 1997, President Suharto emphasised his country's commitment and determination to control the fires. During the meeting, the Indonesian State Minister of the Environment spelt out Indonesia's action plans and programmes to fight the fires. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian authorities have since taken enforcement actions against plantation owners in Kalimantan and Sumatra for clearing land by burning. They have earlier issued warnings and show-cause letters to some 176 companies which have violated the ban, and have to date taken action to revoke 154 permits issued to 29 private companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia has mobilised 50,000 military personnel to beef up its fire-fighting operations in Sumatra and Kalimantan. It has also set up a 24-hour Command Post to track and monitor land and forest fires. The Command Post is located in Jakarta in the office of the Environmental Impact Management Agency (BAPEDAL) under the Indonesian State Ministry of Environment. In addition, Indonesia has commenced cloud-seeding operations in Sumatra in a bid to combat the drought and put out fires. If proven successful, these operations will be extended to Kalimantan. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our part, Singapore has extended full co-operation to Indonesia in its efforts to control the fires and smoke haze. To help the Indonesians locate fires and plan their fire-fighting, we have been sending them daily satellite pictures showing the location of hot spots. For the cloud-seeding operations, Singapore assists by providing daily information on cloud formations and wind data. We have also trained some of their officials in the areas of satellite imagery and air quality monitoring. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1679</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia has invited Singapore to help man its Command Post in Jakarta. A three-member fact-finding team visited the Command Post last month, on 25th and 26th September, to discuss with the Indonesian officials, the specific areas in which Singapore could offer further assistance in tackling the smoke haze problem. Several areas have been identified. Starting from 30th September, teams of environmental and meteorological experts from Singapore are being attached to the Command Post on rotation to assist the Indonesians in locating and tracking fires. The attachment will continue for the duration of the haze period. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of equipment support, Singapore is providing Indonesia with hand-held global positioning system (GPS) sets for their field officers, INMARSAT Communications equipment for direct communication between field offices in remote areas and Jakarta via satellite, and computers for the Command Post. These equipment will help enhance Indonesia's monitoring and enforcement capabilities. We have also finalised plans to send air monitoring equipment to help Indonesia monitor the smoke haze situation in Sumatra. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, my Ministry and the Meteorological Service Department will jointly conduct further training courses for Indonesian officials in air quality monitoring and satellite imagery. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF is also involved in our cooperation effort with Indonesia. The SAF yesterday despatched an RFAF C130 Aircraft to assist Abri in its efforts to fight the haze. The aircraft is based at Bandung's Hussein Sastranegara Airport to carry out haze dispersion operations. It may also be used for airlift operation as required by Abri. The aircraft is accompanied by a full crew and personnel to carry out the dispensing of chemicals. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the home-front, my Ministry chairs an inter-ministry haze task force that formulates overall strategies and guidelines to help our citizens and residents cope with the smoke haze situation. This task force was formed in 1994, when \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1680</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Singapore was similarly affected by smoke haze. It drew up a Haze Action Plan in 1994, setting out the broad response plans for different ranges of the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI). This year, the task force expanded on the Haze Action Plan and is coordinating the efforts of key Government agencies in fine-tuning their individual action plans and the standard operating procedures. I can assure this House that the Government has in readiness the necessary plans to help Singaporeans cope during the haze period. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House would have read about the salient features of the Haze Action Plan as well as the individual action plans of key agencies such as the Ministries of Education and Health. Nevertheless, I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the key elements of the Haze Action Plan. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the 24-hour PSI remains largely below 100, which is the situation so far, the main task is to provide the public frequent air quality updates and health advisories. This is being done with hourly updates on the PSI through the media, on an Internet web page, and over the telephone through a haze info-line. The Meteorological Service Department also provides regular weather forecasts and updates on the haze situation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of haze-related information to the public would be further intensified should the 24-hour PSI creep towards 200 or breach this level. The Haze Task Force, which now meets weekly, will meet more frequently to closely and critically appraise the situation and decide on the activation of certain response plans. For example, when the 24-hour PSI stays between 201 and 300, which is the \"very unhealthy\" range, we would decide on the need to require factories with fuel-burning equipment to further cut down on emissions, and vehicle fleet owners to implement additional measures to reduce emissions from their vehicles. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the 24-hour PSI is between 301 and 400, the air quality is in the \"hazardous\" range. The Haze Task Force would advise Government agencies on \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1681</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the need for closure of schools, childcare centres and sport facilities, and stoppage of military training and outdoor work. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the 24-hour PSI persists above 400, the Civil Defence Force's public warning system would be used to alert the public. The public will also be informed on the healthcare precautions to take through the radio and TV media. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is possible that the 24-hour PSI may exceed the 200-mark on some days, the likelihood of the PSI entering the `hazardous' range of 301 to 400 or even persisting above 200 is low, based on air quality trends and other information that we have so far. Given the on-going efforts in Indonesia to control the raging fires, we would hope that the current situation will not take an unexpected turn for the worse between now and November, when the north-east monsoon is expected to set in and end the threat of smoke haze. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong has asked about MINDEF's military training. MINDEF has indicated that military training will continue as normal when the PSI is between 101 and 200, but soldiers should not be made to run more than 5 km or go on road marches longer than 8 km. If the PSI is between 201 and 300, physical training would be held indoors and extra training would be cancelled. MINDEF has indicated that operational and field training will continue if the PSI is below 300. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now address Members' questions on the health effects of the smoke haze. As I have mentioned earlier, the 24-hour PSI readings have remained mostly below 100 since the onset of this year's haze episode. Given this situation, the health effects of haze are mainly caused by the irritant effects of fine dust particles on the nose, throat, airways, skin and eyes. The effects would depend on the severity of the haze. There is also individual variation depending on one's ability to tolerate air pollution. Most people would experience sneezing, runny nose, eye irritation, dry \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1682</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> throat and dry cough from the pollutant. These symptoms are mild and pose no danger to the health of the general population. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, persons with medical problems like asthma, chronic lung disease, chronic sinusitis and allergic skin conditions are likely to be more affected by the haze and they may experience more severe symptoms. Children and the elderly in general are more likely to be affected. For some, symptoms may worsen with physical activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For persons under medical treatment, it is important that they take their medication regularly. Persons with chronic heart and lung problems are advised not to engage in outdoor sporting activities if the PSI is above 100. There is otherwise no need to take extraordinary precautions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has also received many queries on the usefulness of face masks. We have informed the public that surgical or other similar masks are not effective in filtering out the fine particles present in the smoke haze. Such masks will only give a false sense of well-being to the users. On the other hand, there are special masks, referred to as `respirators', which are designed to protect workers exposed to occupational health hazards. These respirators are effective in filtering out fine particles. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given our current air quality, there is no need for the general public to use respirators. However, respirators may be useful for those with chronic cardio-respiratory illness, but they should only be used on the recommendation of the attending doctors. For the general population, if the haze is intense with the 24-hour PSI exceeding 200, those who need to work outdoors for prolonged periods may find that respirators could provide some relief. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether the haze is carcinogenic in any form. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, we have searched for the information through various literature and we have not found \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1683</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> any information on whether such haze particles over the period that we are being exposed to could be carcinogenic. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether he agrees that the current haze situation in Indonesia is due to a natural disaster. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I have already answered that just now. Perhaps, the Member was not listening properly. I have stated that the authorities in Indonesia had said that 80% of the haze was created initially by land clearing and forest clearing activities through burning by large plantation owners and the remaining 20% was due to the traditional slash-and-burn practices of the small farmers. However, because of the prolonged drought, these fires have now spread to other areas and have reached out of control. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> May I ask the Minister whether there is any long-term effect of the haze on the health of Singaporeans who are exposed to it? We do not see the effect immediately now, but will there be any long-term effect, and if there is, how would this be seen in form and time? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, to explain this, I should also explain to Members the basis for the PSI readings. The PSI readings that we are using are taken from the system that has been drawn up by the US Environmental Protection Agency and they have drawn up this PSI system based on research over many, many years of prolonged exposure of populations to pollution levels at certain ambient levels. For example, they have rated PSI 101 to 200 as being unhealthy. But that is only unhealthy if the population is exposed to this level of pollution for 24 hours each day over many, many years. In that context, in Singapore, the PSI level has gone up above 100 only on eight occasions this year and even then, it is for very short periods of time. In the context of epidemiological research which has been carried out by the US, which assumes exposure over many years, I think Singaporeans are quite safe because our exposure has been very limited. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1684</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Can I ask the Minister whether his Ministry has done any in-depth study of the air pollutants? You cannot talk about the effects unless you know what is in the air. You cannot assume that there is only wood burning. There could be other things that are being burned. I think it is important that this House should have an idea of what are the air pollutants present. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I can assure the Member that we have taken measurements of the major pollutants. The PSI system measures not just the dust particles in the air but also the level of the five major air pollutants, namely, ozone, particulate matter, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. So all these pollutants are measured. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Could I ask the Minister whether in the spirit of ASEAN cooperation, Singapore and the other ASEAN countries could do more in the next few weeks and also in terms of preventive measures in future? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the ASEAN Ministers of the key countries that have been affected, I understand, have been in close contact with the Indonesian Minister. For example, I have been talking to my counterpart, Minister Sarwono, on the phone over the last few days as well. And we are all offering to the Indonesians assistance in areas that we have expertise or resources in. I have also discussed with Minister Sarwono that it may be useful for the ASEAN Ministers of the countries affected to meet together after the haze problem has been solved, maybe at the end of the year or early next year, to discuss how we can better address this issue in future years and to prevent future recurrences of the haze problem of this extent. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, the Minister mentioned about the various types of pollutants. I would like to ask the Minister which particular component is very high. He mentioned about oxide of nitrogen. I know that oxide of nitrogen is one of the main pollutants of wood burning. Is it very high? I want to know how high is it. Because it has an effect on the health of Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1685</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, our studies have shown that other than dust particulates, the other pollutants have not changed very much. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> Sir, I am personally reassured by the measures taken by the Government on the haze. I would like to ask whether, in fact, it is sufficient to have just one measure for the whole of Singapore. Because there were occasions when we saw that the PSI was below 70 PSI but it looked as though it was above 100. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, there are two parts to the question. First, whether we should have PSI indicators for different parts of the island and, secondly, the correlation between the PSI reading and a person's perception of visibility. Firstly, in terms of the need to have multiple PSI readings for the whole of Singapore, the answer is that there is really no need, because the haze is very extensive. It covers the whole region. With the prevailing winds blowing into Singapore, the haze situation equalises very quickly. There may be some time lapse between, say, Jurong and perhaps Marine Parade. But over a very short period of time, the haze really equalises throughout the whole of Singapore. So there is really no need to have different PSI indicators. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in terms of correlation between PSI reading and visibility, Members should also understand that the PSI readings are taken over an average of three hours. So what you see on the TV screen does not reflect the PSI reading as at present, but the PSI reading of the preceding three hours. So if the pollutant levels are increasing, then what you are seeing is a time lapse between what you see and the PSI level. If the PSI is actually on the downward trend, what you see with your eyes and what you see on the TV screen are again different. Because we may think that the sky is clearing, but the PSI reading is still showing a fairly high reading. That is one. Secondly, the visibility perception is also quite deceiving. Because in the early morning hours, after a rainfall and with the mist in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1686</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the air, the visibility impact is enhanced, in the sense that it appears to be more misty than the figures show otherwise. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, are we to understand from the Minister that apart from providing hourly updated information to our residents and giving advice on how they could cope with it, the Government has no other plans to try to see how the risk to our citizens may be minimized? Is that so? Or has the Government any plans to minimize the risk? Has the Government considered, eg, cloud seeding operations in Singapore? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the most effective way is to solve this problem at source, and that is what we have been doing all along. For the past few months, we have been sending to the Indonesians satellite photographs which show the hot spots so that they can quickly get to the hot spots and put out the fires. And we have observed that a few days after, those hot spots did disappear, except that other hot spots appeared in other locations as well. So, it is an ongoing fight which the Indonesian government authorities have been actively engaged in. We have also provided them with various equipment which enhance their enforcement capabilities as well as help them to more accurately identify where the hot spots are. And these are all activities which will help put out the fires and therefore reduce the haze. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards cloud seeding over Singapore, cloud seeding is actually most effective if done over where the fires are, because you want to put out the fires. Seeding in Singapore, first, is not feasible, because we are very small. It is very difficult to predict the wind directions and how fast the effect of the seeding will take impact. We may seed here expecting that it will take effect maybe in half an hour's time and that the wind will blow here, to find that actually the effect takes place only in three hours' time, in which case the rain will be falling in the ocean. Singapore is too small a place for cloud seeding activities to be effective, and that is why we have not engaged in such activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1687</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, the Minister has said that the PSI standards are taken from the US EPA. May I ask the Minister whether and how these standards are relevant in Singapore and whether there have been any studies on this? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, whilst the average American may be a little bit bigger, I would expect that Singaporeans and Americans are similar, and the impact on us will be very similar too. And they have devised this PSI system after many, many years of epidemiological studies. It is now a worldwide standard. So I think we are on strong grounds to adopt this system for Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Harun A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Harun A. Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, the Minister mentioned that the PSI reading is taken on an average, meaning that in some places, the reading is higher. I understand that the PSI reading in Jurong is always higher than other places. If the average PSI reading is 200 or 300, what would be the reading in my constituency? Can the Minister explain? I am worried about my constituents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear! \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I would like to remind the hon. Member that my constituency is also Hong Kah Constituency and that I am equally concerned. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained just now on whether there is a need to have multiple readings for different locations, because the haze is so pervasive that if the wind is blowing from the Marine Parade side to Jurong and is blowing in a heavy intensity of haze, then the Marine Parade side will get a higher reading first followed shortly after by the Jurong side, and vice versa. This haze is affecting the whole region and therefore geographical distances of 3-4 kilometres will not make much of a difference, other than a few minutes of time lapse. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, notwithstanding the Minister's explanation, could he say whether there is a systematic difference, eg, in places in the West Coast which are in close proximity to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1688</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> petrochemical plants and refineries, and whether the haze level readings will be systematically higher? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the current problem is dust particles. The major dust particles are really from the fires in Indonesia. In that context, the differential between, say, areas in Jurong and areas in the East would be extremely small or negligible. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> A last question from Dr Tan Boon Wan. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, we have a long bout of haze in Singapore. I would like the Minister to tell us how long more will Singaporeans be exposed to the current bout of haze. And to crystal gaze from this period until the haze ends, what is the possibility of the PSI exceeding the 200-300 levels? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I wish I had a crystal ball. The meteorological experts have told us that normally by late September, we should be experiencing the early effects of the north east monsoon. However, because of the El Nino effects, this would be delayed between a month and six weeks. What we can expect is that probably by the end of October, we should be getting the benefit of some changes in wind direction during the inter-monsoon period, in which case the smoke would be blown away from Singapore, rather than towards Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether there is a likelihood of the haze going above 200 or even the 300 region, gauging from today's report in the newspapers of the press interview carried out by Environment Minister Sarwono and five of his Ministerial colleagues, I think the commitment of the Indonesian government towards solving the fire problems has been well reflected. And I hope they are able to now translate that commitment into enhanced actions, which again I am quite hopeful about because President Suharto has told Abri to chip in and do its best. So with all the immense resources that Indonesia has, I am quite hopeful that the problem will be kept under control and that the risk of the PSI going above 200 would be fairly minimal. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1689</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>STABILITY OF SINGAPORE DOLLAR</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S.

Recent indicators show that the Singapore economy is also on course for an export-led recovery to attain growth in the region of 6-7% in 1997. For 1998, however, growth of total export of goods and services, particularly tourism, could be weaker, reflecting slower growth and poorer business sentiment in the regional economies. Longer term, the impact will depend on how quickly the regional economies recover and resume their normal growth rates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the Thai Baht and Indonesian Rupiah, the Singapore dollar is managed against a trade-weighted basket of our trading partners' currencies. So far this year up to 3rd October, the Singapore dollar has appreciated by 28.9% against the Thai Baht, by 39.2% against the Indonesian Rupiah, by 19.9% against the Malaysian Ringgit and by 3.7% against the Deutsche Mark, but depreciated by 9.3% against the US dollar, by 9.3% against the Hong Kong dollar, by 9.4% against the Renminbi, by 4.6% against the Japanese Yen and by 4.6% against the Sterling \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1690</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Pound. Overall, the Singapore dollar has firmed against the trade-weighted basket of currencies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has emerged relatively unaffected by the regional currency crisis because of our strong political and economic fundamentals. We have high savings rates, substantial budget surpluses and large foreign reserves. We also have large current account surpluses and strong inflows of direct foreign investment. All these are the outcome of prudent fiscal and monetary policies which the Government has put in place over the years. In addition, our strategy of being pro-business, minimising bureaucracy, ensuring a competitive tax structure and improving the educational and skills level of our workers has been key to our success in attracting foreign investors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increasingly integrated global economic environment offers both opportunities and risks. The challenge for Singapore lies in reaping the benefits of the global market while safeguarding the basic soundness of our financial and economic system. In this regard, the Government remains committed to maintaining Singapore's conducive and competitive economic environment. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, will the Minister please comment what is the Government's position on the proposed Asia Fund to support regional currencies in moments of crisis and whether such a fund, if used, would be subject to IMF conditionality? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The Member would have seen from press reports that such a fund has been mooted initially by the Japanese and subsequently discussed with the ASEAN Finance Ministers. In principle, the ASEAN Ministers have supported the concept of such a fund. But I think all are agreed that the fund should be subject to full IMF conditionality, plus probably additional safeguards on prudential overviews. The matter is under discussion now with the IMF and in consultation with the US Government. For the time being, I cannot say when and how such a fund will be finalised. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1691</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, two supplementary questions. One is the impact of the depreciation of the Singapore dollar against the US dollar on the economy and the other question is the plan to internationalise the Singapore dollar. Has that been reviewed? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> As I mentioned earlier, the Singapore dollar is measured against a basket of currencies, of which the US dollar is one component but by no means a major component. So whilst it has depreciated against the US dollar, this reflects a general strengthening of the US dollar against all international currencies. Depending on the type of exporter you are, the depreciation against the US dollar would benefit certain industries more than others. For example, I am sure that SIA would be very happy to have the situation continued. But overall, we are firming against the trade basket, so the impact of these currency changes will have no effect, we believe, on our imported inflation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of internationalising the Singapore dollar, MAS' policy has consistently been to allow a gradual increase in the use of the Singapore dollar for international purposes, but not at a rate which will lead to destabilising flows taking place which might upset the domestic economy. So we will continue to maintain this policy. Since last year, for example, we have increased the excess by foreign banks through Singapore dollar loans by $50 million from $150 million to $200 million, and we have been doing this gradually over the years. We have also allowed, under certain conditions, foreign companies to list their shares in Singapore dollars and we are contemplating easing some of the conditions to make it more attractive. These are the gradual ways in which we will allow the Singapore dollar to be used internationally but not at a rate which will destabilise our domestic Singapore dollar economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Will the Minister please comment on the effect on the Singapore economy of, first, weaker regional currencies and, second, possible lowering of regional growth rates? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1692</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I mentioned that the immediate impact is very small, certainly for this year. The longer term effect depends entirely on how long these large depreciations of the neighbouring countries' currencies persist. Clearly, in the case of, say, Thailand, the impact on us is not likely to be very large because their basket of export goods is very dissimilar to ours. Similarly, for Indonesia. The largest impact probably lies with the Malaysian currency. If the large differential persists, then of course, the issue of competitiveness against us becomes a little more important because there is some overlap in the middle range. So a great deal depends on how long the differential exists. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lowering of the value of the Malaysian ringgit, for example, obviously has pluses and minuses. Where we purchase, say, consumption goods from Malaysia, like food products, over time the prices should ease. Of course, the negative effect is that it would make Singapore become much more expensive from the Malaysian consumers' point of view. So tourism will be affected. The impact varies across industries, but the most important factor is how long these economies will remain under stress and the longer term impact on us will depend very much on how the growth rates of these countries are affected. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, the Minister has projected that our economic expansion will be 6-7% for the current financial year. My question to him is this: will he say that, with the current problems at the Johor causeway, the impact on us, even on a prolonged basis, will be minimal? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I do not see that as a financial question, although indirectly, of course, it affects business. The Minister for Communications is not around. I think the reports in the papers already highlight the fact that it is a serious problem which lorry operators and businessmen on both sides of the causeway are concerned and they have made appeals to the Johor authorities and I believe some attempts have been made \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1693</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to ease the situation.

Secondly, will the recent currency crisis affect Singapore's endeavour to become a financial centre in this region? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, I think I have already answered the first part of his question.

Consequently, they are staffed by specially trained doctors and nurses, both of whom are limited resources. Also, they are equipped with a wide range of diagnostic and treatment facilities to deal with potentially life-threatening conditions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The A&amp;E service is costly to operate because of the specialised and intensive medical and equipment resources involved. It costs on the average about $114 to treat each patient. Operating costs have increased by between 23% and 30% during the period 1993 to 1997 or between 5% and 6% a year. Yet the A&amp;E fees have remained largely unchanged over these four years. The hospitals will need to recover at least part of the cost increases, especially if they are to continue adding more resources to cater for higher patient demands. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total bill of a typical emergency patient before the fee revision is about $55. With the fee revision, a patient would pay a flat fee of between $50 and $70. This works out to an increase of between 3% and 5% a year, which is lower than the 5% to 6% annual increase in costs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The A&amp;E services are heavily subsidised. After the fee revision, the subsidy will still remain significant, at about 50%. Patients who cannot afford the A&amp;E fees can seek financial assistance from the hospitals. No one needing emergency treatment will be turned away because of inability to pay. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me touch on the prevention of indiscriminate use of A&amp;E services. My Ministry had implemented several measures in the past to curb the increase in the number of non-emergency attendances at the A&amp;E departments. These include educating the public on the proper use of A&amp;E services, introduction of two-tier charging where non-emergency patients pay a higher attendance fee, and the establishment of walk-in clinics in the Singapore General Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1695</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the last two to three years, attendances at A&amp;E departments have been rising rapidly. Total attendances have increased by about 30% since 1994, or an average rate of 9% a year. What is of great concern is that the number of non-emergency cases rose by 38% during this same period. As a result, the median waiting time for emergency cases has gone up from 16 minutes to 26 minutes in 1996. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data shows that a quarter of the A&amp;E patients are not emergency cases. While already high, this figure is probably still understated, because many patients strongly object when the triaging staff at the A&amp;E classify them as non-emergency cases. Part of the reason for their unhappiness at being declared a non-emergency case is that they then have to pay a higher consultation fee, and they are given lower priority in the treatment queue compared to the emergency cases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the non-emergency cases could have gone to the private GPs and polyclinics for treatment. About two-thirds of the non-emergency attendances occurred between 8.00 am and 9.00 pm when polyclinics and GP clinics are open for consultation. There are also 24-hour GP clinics and 24-hour outpatient clinics in the private hospitals. Non-emergency cases who feel unwell after the operating hours of polyclinics and GP clinics could either wait till the next day, since they are non-emergency, or see the doctors in the 24-hour clinics. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understandable that many non-emergency patients would prefer the A&amp;E department instead because of their very comprehensive range of services. Also, with the fees having remained unchanged for four years, the gap between the A&amp;E charges and that of private GPs has narrowed, making the A&amp;E department an attractive alternative to the GPs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is important for the public to understand and appreciate that the A&amp;E services are limited and crucial resources which are meant to cater to patients with \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1696</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> truly emergency and life-threatening medical conditions. My Ministry and the hospitals will therefore continue to educate Singaporeans on what constitute non-emergency conditions, and on the proper use of the A&amp;E departments. We will do this regularly through the mass media and will continue to seek the help of community and grassroots organisations to disseminate this information. The hospitals will also advise non-emergency cases that turn up at the A&amp;E departments to seek treatment at nearby GP clinics or polyclinics, if these are open. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> May I ask the Minister where can the patients go but the A&amp;E departments of the major hospitals when they fall ill in the middle of the night and are not the night clinics too few and far between to be an alternative facility to the A&amp;E departments? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, as I have stated in my answer just now, if they are non-emergency cases, they can afford to wait to the next morning. If the pain or the condition is hurting them so much, and they are considered emergency cases, they can go to the A&amp;E department. There is nothing to prevent them from doing that. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> How is the patient going to know what constitutes an emergency and is it fair to penalise the patient for misjudging the severity of his illness? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Based on that starting point, GP clinics should all close because every patient would then be very worried about his condition and he would go straight to the A&amp;E clinic.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill gives effect to the Government's intention to promote mediation as a means of resolving social and community disputes. The Minister for Law had informed this House on 30th July 1997 that the Government has accepted the recommendations of an Inter-agency Committee on Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) which, among other things, had proposed the setting up of Community Mediation Centres. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill provides for the establishment of such Community Mediation Centres, in suitable locations close to where people live and work. These Community Mediation Centres, or CMCs in short, will provide services to the community to help disputing parties resolve social and community disputes in an amicable way. Mediation is a better way to resolve such disputes than going to the Courts. Trained mediators will be appointed to conduct mediation sessions in a non-confrontational setting. This \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1698</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> approach will promote greater neighbourliness and help foster a more harmonious and cohesive society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice of mediation, of course, is not entirely new in Singapore. Indeed, the Courts have shown the way by successfully using mediation as a pre-trial procedure from early 1992. Other professional groups have also begun to use the mediation process to solve disputes. What this Bill does is to provide a framework to promote its use. This framework envisages a network of Community Mediation Centres spread over different parts of Singapore to bring mediation to the ground. These will complement the Singapore Academy of Law's Singapore Mediation Centre's and other professional groups' efforts in the commercial arena. We hope to set up the first CMC to be co-located with a regional Small Claims Tribunal somewhere in the eastern part of Singapore by early next year. A new ADR Division in the Ministry of Law will provide overall coordination and promotion of ADR, in particular mediation activities in Singapore. In addition, a Resource Panel of lay experts will be appointed to tap existing non-governmental expertise and experience. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now deal with the following questions: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will CMCs be run? Who can come for mediation at CMCs? How will disputes be resolved? Who will the mediators be? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 3 of the Bill provides for the establishment of CMCs to provide mediation services, while clauses 4 to 9 empower the Minister to appoint one or more Directors and staff to run the centres. Mediators will be appointed by the Minister to conduct the sessions. They will follow certain procedures in performing this task. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 10 to 14 deal with the conduct of the mediation sessions. Sir, mediation works best when parties are willing for their disputes to be resolved in a civil manner. They will then be assisted to arrive at mutually-acceptable solutions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1699</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Thus, clause 12 provides that mediation will be on a voluntary basis. Also, the sessions will be conducted with as little formality and technicality as possible. The usual rules of evidence applicable in our courts will in general not strictly apply and the parties will not be represented by lawyers. The idea is to get them to talk to each other early in a constructive and informal manner, so that there will be better mutual understanding of each other's concerns. In most cases, successful mediation should result in a settlement. These settlements will not be legally binding, but the parties may, if they so wish, enter into a written agreement with the clear statement that it shall be binding on them. Breach of this express undertaking can provide the basis for a civil action for breach of contract. Thus the choice is up to the parties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what are the cases that should go to a CMC? The focus of Community Mediation Centres is on relational disputes, not involving a seizable offence, involving especially neighbours and also including family members and other members of a local community where there is a continuing relationship. It is envisaged that most of these parties will go to CMCs on a voluntary basis. The Neighbourhood Police, Members of Parliament and community leaders can also refer disputes to a Centre for resolution where the parties involved are agreeable. Cases involving small consumer claims and financial or contractual disputes, say, between a contractor and his client, however, should continue to be referred to the Small Claims Tribunals where applicable. And because they are co-located, it would be easy to do so. So also should other specific claims arising from sale of goods or provision of service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 provides for another instance of referral, this time by the courts, where complaints lodged before a Magistrate for issue of a private summons may be referred to a Community Mediation Centre. Under this provision, the Magistrate will have the discretion, in suitable cases, to direct the parties, with their consent, to go to a Centre for mediation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1700</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> If such a dispute is not successfully mediated, the Magistrate will proceed to hear the case in accordance with the procedures in the Criminal Procedure Code. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 23 of the Bill empowers the Minister to make regulations for the training and accreditation of mediators in addition to making regulations for the proper administration of the centres. Sir, as all of us know, a key ingredient to the success of community mediation is the availability of suitable mediators who can then be properly trained. Therefore, mediators will be carefully selected. They will be bound by a Code of Conduct to keep confidences and to safeguard any personal information made available to them in the course of mediation. Other than appointing trained professionals, the Government will also identify suitable community leaders with the necessary temperament, standing and experience to act as mediators. Over time, we will develop a pool of such leaders who will help to promote better inter-personal relationships and stronger community bonding amongst our residents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are embarking on a new venture to improve community relations through the resolution of conflicts by non-adversarial means. We will therefore take a phased, step-by-step approach. If necessary, adjustments will be made to our procedures as we gain more experience and knowledge. For example, if considered useful, we may in the future devolve more authority to suitable community leaders, who are Justices of the Peace, to help keep the peace and promote community harmony. This will all make for a better society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the Bill on the setting up of the CMC. As a Member of Parliament, I think most of us have at various times brought up disputes or issues which, I think, are best settled not by the court, but by a mediator. I think this Bill seeks to do just that. However, I have a number of questions for the Minister to ponder and answer. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1701</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 11(1), there is no definition of what is \"family, social or community\". In my view, the family should include ex-spouses, parents and siblings, because such disputes are usually very common. It should also include persons who are regarded as members of the family by the parties in dispute, for example, persons who are living together as husband and wife but are not legally married to one another and, of course, their respective children or next-of-kin. Also, on social and community cases, the line of distinction may be very thin, but it is still necessary to provide a definition. Apart from neighbours or residents living in the same neighbourhood, while eligible to be classified under one or the other category, how would the dispute between, say, a school teacher and a parent be classified? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12(1) states that mediation is voluntary. It is not clear whether mediation services will be provided free of charge since participation or attendance is voluntary. If it is for a fee, then I think some sort of scale will have to be worked out. I submit that they should not be for free because they will then be taken for granted and the Government is under no obligation to provide such a service. Cost of litigation is always a deterrent factor and for this sort of mediation, I think it should be so as well to discourage frivolous pursuit of disputes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13(2), Sir, is on the binding nature of the settlement agreement. The Minister has mentioned that after the settlement, the parties can pursue civil litigation if one party does not agree with the agreement. But, Sir, I think this may be too expensive and a costly procedure, especially in the case of mediation, one party may be seen to be giving more to the other party in the process just to get the dispute out of the way. Can this settlement not be registered with the Subordinate Courts or the Small Claims Tribunals where there are monetary issues involved, so that enforcement action can then be taken? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1702</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, with the setting up of the CMC, it seems to be a logical device for ADRs, such as arbitration, for these CMCs to be used for settlement. In other words, there are several cases of civil contracts whereby not large amounts are involved, instead of the arbitration court being used, perhaps in future the CMCs may be used for such ADRs. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill. It is an attempt to encourage settlement of disputes without the parties resorting to litigation that is both expensive and time-consuming. Singaporeans will have another accessible way of resolving their disputes with each other, at reasonable cost, we hope. This is most welcome, and I only have a few comments to make. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill attempts to set up a structure for community mediation in Singapore. As I understand it, this is distinct from commercial mediation and other court-based mediation such as that practised in the Subordinate Courts. Commercial mediation is being set up in the Singapore Academy of Law. This leaves community mediation to be tackled by the Community Mediation Centres. Such a division of labour among the various agencies will probably confuse potential users of the system and steps will have to be taken to define the scope of each type of mediation clearly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When is a dispute one that should be settled at the Community Mediation Centre? The Bill does not provide guidance on this, other than the phrase used in clause 11 which is, and I quote, \"a case concerning a family, social or community dispute\". This is perhaps an understandably wide phrase, but it can give rise to problems, which means that the rules to be enacted to give effect to these centres have to be drafted with care. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, family disputes involving the distribution of matrimonial property may not be appropriately dealt with in such a forum. Legal rules relating to the distribution of, say, matrimonial property are complex and difficult to apply. In the event of a wrongful settlement, questions \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1703</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> can arise as to whether the spouse can appeal or whether the settlement agreement can be vitiated on the basis that it is actually against the law or that it is doubtful whether the settlement is legal at all. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such examples can be multiplied - a dispute between parent and teenager, between consumer and trader, between landowners as to their common fence, between flat dwellers as to the repairing of leakages, and so on. It seems to me that the centres can be easily bogged down, either by taking too many cases or by taking cases that they cannot handle. At the moment, the Bill provides little guidance for this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, another aspect has to do with the relationship between these centres and other dispute resolution mechanisms, such as the Small Claims Tribunals. I understand that in the United States, the centres are known as \"Neighbourhood Justice Centres\" where more facilities are provided. It is almost like a one-stop centre for dispute resolution. The centres should, according to a report, \"make available a variety of methods of processing disputes, including arbitration, mediation, referral to small claims courts as well as referral to courts of general jurisdiction.\" It may be that, in due course, the centres set up through this Bill should perform wider and more defined roles of dispute resolution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it is clear that many critical issues concerning the running of these centres and the training of mediators are to be dealt with only in the rules, as the Bill confers discretion on the Minister to enact these. The enforceability of such settlements, the powers and duties of mediators, the nature of disputes that such centres can deal with, these are issues which have to be provided for in the rules. It would of course have been better for these matters to be spelt out in the parent legislation. But the legislation merely provides a framework for these centres. I do hope that the rules will take care of such details to come. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as the general principles in the Bill are sound, Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1704</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have only two matters to raise on this Bill. One is, as the Minister has rightly pointed out, the need to select mediators with care. He said that, apart from professional people, they could also be appointed from grassroots leaders. So far as I know, grassroots leaders are appointed largely by the People's Association or selected by them and who are very partial to the Government or the Party. We do have in this country, and I hope it is still being continued, a system of appointing Justices of the Peace. I do not know how many Justices of the Peace we have at the moment in Singapore. Is it not possible to involve Justices of the Peace in solving these disputes that arise? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a danger, as has been mentioned, I think, that information which is highly private may be leaked out and may be made use of by persons who may have other motives in mind. Therefore, I think it is absolutely necessary that whoever is asked to mediate should be persons of the highest integrity and should be bound by some strict rules of conduct and safeguards. So I want to know whether it is not possible to just use the Justices of the Peace that we have in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter that I wish to raise is clause 14, ie, representation by agent. I can well understand the need to keep lawyers out of this mediation. But why is there a refusal to let a party be represented by an agent? Some persons may, but through no fault of themselves, be unable to express their problems and what is it that they are seeking. And if they are prepared to find somebody who will be able to speak for them and on whom they can trust, why is it not possible for them to be represented by the agent selected by them? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common law principle is that any person can do, what he can do by himself, through an agent unless some statute prohibits the doing of anything through an agent. Sir, I would ask the Ministry to consider whether clause 14 may perhaps work to the disadvantage of persons who may not be able to present their problems \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1705</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> or the solutions as they seek as effectively as through an agent in whom they place their trust. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am obliged to you for giving me this opportunity to speak on this Bill. At the outset, I must disclose my interest. I am a practising lawyer and I also sit as a panel member of the Strata Titles Board and the Maintenance of Parents Tribunal, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill before the House is timely. We have successfully experimented with the system in the Subordinate Courts. The Family Court has adopted mediation to settle disputes. In the High Court, parties are encouraged to settle disputes at Mediation Centres set up by the Singapore Academy of Law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, small disputes involving neighbours and family members should not end up in court where, under the existing system of justice, it is adversarial. In the course of the trial and cross-examination, feelings of the parties get affected and the loser is likely to nurse grievances despite justice being done to him. Sir, court trial is costly, time consuming and distressing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 150 years ago, an advice was given on litigation that is relevant even today. Unfortunately, the advice was not followed. Let me quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Discourage litigation. Persuade client to compromise whenever you can. Point out to them that how the nominal winner is often the loser in fees, expenses and waste of time.\" The advice was given by Abraham Lincoln, Sir. Sadly, the American lawyers continued to depend heavily on litigation to settle disputes. The American society is well known for its litigation and the judicial system almost came to a strain. A movement in 1970s started in America, which is called Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), to resolve disputes. It gained ground in America, Australia and we in Singapore have experimented in our court, especially in the Subordinate Courts. It has worked smoothly and satisfactorily. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1706</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, mediation is not new to Asian society. In villages, disputes are settled by a Council of Elders who act as mediators. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I relate a recent case which shows the effective working of mediation. Just a year ago, in the Subordinate Court, a tenancy dispute that would have taken a few days and a few thousand dollars in legal fees ended after the parties saw a Mediation Judge in Chambers. The Judge played a proactive role and took pains to point out the legal position to the parties and to the solicitors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now contrast this with a case which happened some 25 years ago where two neighbours went to the Magistrate Court in South Bridge Road over a minor dispute. It was a private summons case. The matter went on for a few days. The learned Magistrate dismissed the case. Both parties paid the lawyers handsomely. Both men had large families. Both were ordinary wage earners. They spent their hard earned savings on this unproductive exercise. Even now, the families are not on talking terms. So are the children, some of whom are graduates. It is yet to be seen how the grandchildren will see to this family feud. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as a practising lawyer, I see merit in the Bill before this House. Mediation has the advantage that it is accessible and the hearing could be held in the evening in the housing estates. It is expeditious. It saves costs. It is pacifying. It is healing. It is informal, less intimidating and, most of all, it is user friendly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are some areas which perhaps could have been better drafted but I think it would be premature to criticise the Bill as a whole and the thing to do is to leave it to the working for a year or so and to review to see what amendments could be made. But there are some provisions in the Bill which need reconstruction. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under clause 5, the Director may delegate his power. I am unhappy with this provision. May we have other designated officers, like Deputy and Assistant Directors, to assist him? Also, Sir, success of the law would depend on the choice of Directors and mediators. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1707</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has maintained a very high standard in appointments to tribunals. I hope it would be done in this case. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move to clause 15. I suggest that the power of the mediator be increased. Perhaps, a legally trained mediator would be useful in cases under clause 15 so that he could bring finality to the matter instead of referring the matter to the Subordinate Courts again. I know this requires changes in our criminal law and Criminal Procedure Code. I think in the interest of the community, welfare and justice, we should look into this and if it is not possible to do so now, I hope it could be done later. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned with the rules of evidence, Sir. Clause 10(3) of the Bill reads: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The rules of evidence do not apply to mediation session.\" This is rather puzzling, Sir. Can a mediator disregard the evidence? To do so would be unjust and unfair. Even the Maintenance of Parents Act is more satisfactory. Section 14(9) of the Act reads: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Tribunal shall not be bound by the strict rules of evidence and shall determine the conduct of its proceedings.\" I hope that the rules of evidence would be the same as that of the Small Claims Tribunal under section 25(1) of the Small Claims Tribunals Act which reads: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A Tribunal shall not be bound by the rules of evidence but may inform itself on any matter in such manner as it thinks fit.\" Unfortunately, these provisions do not exist in the intending legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on a more fundamental issue, the question that we as a people must ask is what type of society we are going to bring about. Are we going to encourage litigations in society where parties go to court on issues which in other countries are settled by mediation. In short, the system of justice shows the values of the people. We are an Asian society. Our social values differ from the western nations. We pride in community well-being rather than in individual rights. As such, mediation would be relevant to resolve disputes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1708</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the adversarial set-up, there is only one winner. Under the proposed system, all parties would be happier as mediation has a conciliatory effect on the parties and hopefully they may live happily after that. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain cases, there may be some arm twisting in order to get social justice but that is something we need not fear. Success of the system will depend on the choice of the Director who will play a pivotal role in the working of the system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who are chosen as mediators must be community leaders who command the respect of the community. Perhaps we should enlarge the system of Justices of Peace. Two other hon. Members before me have emphasised, and I think I need to further emphasise, that we should try to increase the pool of JPs. We should include some lawyers as mediators. In some disputes, especially in areas of criminal law, lawyers may be better placed to mediate. We should try to make use of people who have vast experience in community well-being. At times, mediators would have to decide very sensitive issues and in these cases, we should have more than one mediator. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, I support the Bill, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for allowing me to join in the debate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a very positive Bill in the sense that it will provide a basis to solve community problems, particularly inter-personal problems between residents. In the longer term the Bill, as the Minister of State has pointed out, will also promote community relations. I think there are a lot of problems in the community and between people that can be resolved through mediation. So such a Bill is timely and a lot of inter-personal issues could be resolved through the mediation centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I am concerned about is that this centre would deal with issues based on voluntary commitment and voluntary initiatives of the parties in dispute. This is good for a start. But there are growing numbers of people who cause problems to others and whose problems can only be resolved if the mediation centre has \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1709</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> sufficient teeth. And the numbers will be growing, Sir. I think the mediation centres should, in the long term, be given sufficient teeth to deal with these problems effectively. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are disputes which are agreed upon. The parties to the disputes finally get a decision or arrive at a mutual agreement. But there are difficulties of enforcement of these decisions or mutual agreements. When this happens and the centre is unable to enforce it, then people would lose confidence in the work of the centre. What I am saying is that it is very important for the mediation centres, at some point, to have sufficient teeth to deal with protracted problems. Sometimes human problems are really protracted and some people refuse to address the issues concerned, and they could cause disharmony to the community. And such people will have to be dealt with, and dealt with effectively. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister of State will be able to look into ways to strengthen these provisions further by perhaps, as my learned friend Mr Rai, the NMP, has said, adopting some of the rules and regulations provided for under the Maintenance of Parents Act. If we adopted these rules and regulations, then I am sure the work of the mediation centre will be effective and efficient. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is also important is to take note that we need to have respectable community leaders, who have integrity and honesty and who are well-known to the community, to serve on these community mediation centres. We need not just have JPs to deal with the problem. If we look around, I am sure there are enough community leaders who have sufficient standing and public interest in mind to serve in these mediation centres. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I would like to support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to follow up on the NCMP's comment on the Bill. As I recall, he said that grassroots leaders should not be mediators. He said that grassroots leaders \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1710</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> are appointed by the People's Association and they would not be impartial in conducting mediation. I do not see the relevance here because a dispute is between two individuals. Let us say in a civil dispute, it is between A and B. The Government does not come into the picture in the settlement of the dispute. He suggested that it would be better to use Justices of Peace. In the same way, the Justice of Peace is also appointed by the Government. So I think his suggestion is inconsistent. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would think that grassroots leaders, like community leaders, can play a part in settling civil disputes for the community. If you look at our history, in the old days, 40-50 years ago, clan associations and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce played a major part in settling communal disputes among the people. And I would suggest to the Minister of State that maybe the established clan associations, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce or any other major social organisation can be used as one of the proposed mediation centres. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, first of all, let me thank all the speakers for speaking up in support of the Bill. It is very heartening to note that the speakers are appreciative of the import of the Bill. Many speakers have said this is the first time we are doing it, to bring mediation to the ground, and indeed, as I have said in my speech, we will take a phased step-by-step approach. Members have made good suggestions which will be considered. The process will go on. In drafting the rules, we will take into consideration some of the points raised. But the fact is that because it is the first time that we are doing it, it is important that everybody lends support to the Bill, which is the case today. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make a few general points before dealing specifically with Members' queries. The first point is the type of disputes which the Centre will help settle. The paradigm situation is really that of the neighbours. I think those of us who work the ground and even those who are involved, for example, in town council work, and reading from the media, will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1711</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> know that there are disputes involving neighbours, which with the best of intentions still cannot result in a settlement. In fact, sometimes grassroots leaders are involved but because there is an absence of a structure, there is a lot of wastage of effort and time. So if we can settle the bulk of these disputes for a start, that will be a very good start. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Members have brought up other situations. For example, Prof. Chin has mentioned the case of family disputes involving property, and also Mr Chng Hee Kok has brought up the point about ex-spouses. We have defined the ambit of the Bill in a broad way so that it is inclusive. Because, after all, the parties want a forum which is friendly, which is available, to just talk and air their views. And as has been mentioned, for example, by Mr Shriniwas Rai, it is important to get the parties together to air their views early, so that set positions do not take place. I think we should allow them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said this, there are some disputes which lend themselves better to resolution in other fora. I think the point raised by Prof. Chin is about a more complicated family matter involving distribution of property. The thing to do is to inform these parties and let them know that there are more appropriate fora where they may wish to go to, whether it is the Singapore Mediation Centre or the Small Claims Tribunal, as I have said in my speech. Or indeed in some disputes where other fora have already taken cognizance of the case like family violence and personal protection orders, it would be more appropriate for the parties to be referred to them. So I think we will take this approach and we will see how it works out on the ground and certainly after two or three years, we will review it. That is the first point. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that of voluntariness. I think Dr Vasoo and a few others are more gung-ho in their approach and would like for a start for us to take a more assertive stance. Like I said, because this is the first time we are doing it, we want to be all-encompassing and get as many people to come on board as possible. We \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1712</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> know that the essence of successful mediation is that the parties really want their disputes to be settled. But, ideally, if both parties come to the Centre together, that will be very good. In some cases, it may not happen this way. In some cases, one party may come to the Centre and say, \"I've got a dispute.\" Then it is up to the Director to ask the other disputing party to come down. We cannot force them. But we will let them know, \"Look, we know of this dispute. Why don't you come and talk and settle it?\" Or in situations of referrals, for example, by MPs. Many of us hear of these cases when they come to see us. Or even by NPPs or an instance where even the Magistrate's Court can refer. The approach currently is that there should be an element of voluntariness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even on how to enforce the settlement. In fact, the Committee that I headed, we thought about this long and hard, whether to make it stricter in enforcement. There again, we took the general approach. Because this is the first time we are doing it, we would like it to succeed. We would like as many parties to come on board as possible. Therefore, we have taken the approach where the parties can come together and air their views. I think airing their views in a constructive mediated manner is already a good step. At the end of the day, their agreement would be put down in writing. That will be the case for all mediations, so that at least the parties will know, after all the discussion, that their compromise position will be set down in writing. And whether or not they want it to be legally bound, it is up to them. If they want to, there will be an express statement. At least they will, in those situations, know that there is a legal hold over what they have agreed to. So let us again take a phased approach. I will take into consideration the points raised by Members and review them subsequently. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third general point made by Members is on the standing of mediators. I think that is critical. In fact, that is very often whether or not a mediation will succeed. And like I have said in my speech, we will be very careful in selecting mediators. Basically, people of good \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1713</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> standing, both professionals and community leaders, because the standing of the mediator, in fact, is pivotal to parties first coming for mediation, and being prepared to air their grievances and, secondly, being prepared to accept the advice and keep to what they have agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justices of Peace will be considered. Mr Jeyaretnam asked why not restrict to only Justices of Peace. My response will be: why exclude other grassroots leaders who are suitably qualified? If there are JPs who are qualified, we will consider them. But there are grassroots leaders who are also well qualified. So we must also consider them. And indeed Dr Ker makes a very valid point, because these are non- political disputes. I do not think we should fear that if grassroots leaders are appointed, they will be pro-Government. I think that is really not the issue in so far as this Bill is concerned. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few other points which are made by Members. Mr Chng asked about fees. Here again, because we want to get people to come, we have decided not to impose fees at the outset, but certainly if and when the Mediation Centres take off, we will consider them. He asked: why not do more than mediation? In terms of the Community Mediation Centres, as the name of the centres implies, it will focus on mediation. But under the Bill, the Law Ministry will set up an ADR Committee, for that is the wider picture. Now we are focusing on mediation. But we will not stop there. In terms of a centre or a body looking into how to foster the further growth of ADR processes, including arbitration, for example, in Singapore, there is scope for this. So the Law Ministry's ADR Committee will also look at the other processes, but let us take one step at a time and focus on mediation for the time being. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin Tet Yung also talks about co-location. He talks about justice centres overseas which are one-stop centres. This is partly why we have located the Small Claims Tribunal Regional Centre with the Community Mediation Centre because \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1714</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> this really involves the people on the ground - your residents who have got either small claims or social disputes wanting settlement. The convenience is that if a dispute is better settled in the other forum, it can be referred straightaway. So that is a start. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai is not happy about the delegation of powers by the Director. That is an administrative measure to enable the centre to run efficiently. But let me assure him that, first, we will choose the Director very carefully and secondly, critical functions, for example, deciding whether or not a dispute should be accepted, will not be delegated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talks about the rules of evidence. I think the point is taken. But we must look at the thrust of the provision, which is really to have a system which is informal, friendly, not bogged down by too many technicalities. But certainly the rules of natural justice must be complied with. In terms of his reference to the other two Acts, the Maintenance of Parents Tribunal Act and the Small Claims Tribunals Act, the broad approach of the CMC will be along the same lines. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam also talks about allowing agents to represent the parties freely. I am sure he can see from the Bill that currently it is up to the Director. If the Director finds it useful and if he feels that it will facilitate mediation, he can actually allow for a third party to also come into the mediation. All of us know that in mediation it is better only for the involved parties to be there. Very often, third parties complicate the matter and make it much more difficult to mediate. Therefore, I think the present position is better. It is not a block-all approach, but let us leave it to the Director to decide, basically, on what grounds - whether or not the presence of a third party will facilitate mediation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have answered all the points. Once again, I want to thank Members here for speaking. All of us are hopeful that community mediation will go a long way in making Singapore more cohesive and more harmonious. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1715</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Assoc.

In addition, the Bill also seeks to amend section 130(1) of the Customs Act on enhanced sentences for cigarette smuggling to remove certain ambiguities which have arisen in interpreting this section of the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, as a member of the WTO, is obliged to comply with the Customs Valuation Code within five years from 1st January 1995. The Customs Valuation Code stipulates that the transaction value of imported goods should be used to assess the import duty payable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also makes the following amendments to the Customs Act: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) amend section 22 to confine the method of valuation in section 22 to that for the purposes of levying excise duty under the Act; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) introduce a new section 22A to provide for the purposes of levying import duty under the Act. The valuation of imported goods will follow the Customs Valuation Code which will be provided for in the subsidiary legislation; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) introduce a new section 22B to provide for any person who disagrees with the valuation under section 22 or 22A an avenue to object to the valuation and, if necessary, appeal to the High Court; \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1716</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) amend section 130(1) to make it clear that for offences involving tobacco products of more than 2 kg in weight, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the punishment of imprisonment is not mandatory; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the first offence refers to an offence involving \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tobacco products of more than 2 kg in weight. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been the intent of section 130(1) but its wording has given rise to certain ambiguities in its interpretation.

In Singapore, the tourism industry is an important sector of our economy. In 1996, we attracted 7.3 million visitors who spent $11 billion in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industry is facing increasing competition. Growth in visitor arrivals slowed to 2.2% in 1996, compared to growth rates of 12% per annum from 1985 to 1990, and 6% per annum from 1990 to 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1985 and 1995, per capita visitor spending fell from $751 to $721. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The currency crisis and the haze problem affecting the region are additional difficulties to our tourism industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tourism 21</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the long-term outlook for the global tourism industry is positive. The World Tourism Organisation has estimated that tourist arrivals to the Asia-Pacific region will grow from 84 million in 1995 to 190 million in 2010. The challenge for us is to continue attracting high value tourists to Singapore and to participate in this growth industry in the region. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1718</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the challenges ahead, my Ministry launched the Tourism 21 plan last year. Under Tourism 21, we aim to attract more tourists to Singapore and to be an attractive location for tourism investments and businesses as well as to be a tourism hub and gateway to the region. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STPB has hitherto focused mainly on marketing itself as a tourist destination by itself. By adopting a partnership approach to jointly market neighbouring destinations as well as invest in regional tourism projects, we will be able to offer a more varied and attractive product to visitors and ride on the growth of the tourism industry in the region. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight the main clauses of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 will amend section 3 of the Act to rename the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board as the Singapore Tourism Board. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2, 3 and 4 are consequential amendments arising from this change of name. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 inserts a new section 13A which sets out the expanded functions of the Board. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 re-enacts with amendments section 14 to give the Board the necessary powers to carry out its expanded role. It will be able to play a pro-active role in developing the tourism industry including granting loans to tourism enterprises, if necessary, entering into tourism-related joint ventures, whether within or outside Singapore and, with the Minister's approval, borrowing money to finance the Board's activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 15 and 16 will replace STPB's existing corporate symbol, the Merlion symbol, with a new corporate symbol to reflect the expanded role of the Singapore Tourism Board. However, the Merlion symbol will continue to be protected and used to promote Singapore as a tourist destination. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Other Amendments</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clauses are intended to update the Act and make consequential amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1719</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 will replace the term \"tourist enterprise\" with \"tourism enterprise\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 will accord greater flexibility to the Minister in the appointment of Board members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 will re-designate the Director of the Board as Chief Executive, or such other designation as the Board may decide. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 will give the Board the power to appoint and delegate power to committees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 will rename the Tourist Promotion Fund to Tourism Fund. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 relates to the Board's Annual Report and annual estimates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 provides for penalties for misusing the Board's new symbol or the Merlion symbol. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 17 to 20 are to make consequential amendments to the Tourism Promotion (Cess Collection) Act, the Economic Development Board Act, the Industrial Relations Act and related regulations and to make transitional provisions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Lee Yock Suan]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1719</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CIVIL DEFENCE SHELTER BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill requires developers of residential properties to build shelters in all new flats and houses. It also empowers the Commissioner of the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) to regulate and enforce the law. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1720</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go into the provisions of the Bill, let me share with the House my Ministry's rationale for the civil defence shelter programme. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Rationale</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the relative calm and stability in the region, Singapore cannot afford to take its peace and security for granted. Hence, our emphasis on total defence to prepare Singaporeans for any possible threat. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil defence shelter programme is an integral part of our civil defence efforts. It will ensure that Singaporeans are well-prepared and protected in times of emergency. It will also provide psychological assurance to our servicemen in the frontline that their families would be safe. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Progress to-date</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shelter programme began in 1983, when public civil defence shelters were built in nine underground MRT stations along the North-South and East-West lines. Since 1986, public shelters have also been built at the foot of new HDB blocks and in other public buildings, such as schools and community centres. In 1994, we started to incorporate household shelters in new HDB flats, the first one was in Hougang. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have a network of public CD shelters in HDB housing estates, community centres and clubs, schools and underground MRT stations around the island. Having household shelters in all new HDB flats and private dwelling units is the next logical step forward. Not only would they increase the coverage of the population, but they would also be more convenient and accessible to Singaporeans in times of emergency. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is not the only country to implement such an extensive shelter programme. Sweden, Switzerland and Finland are among the many countries who require CD shelters for their citizens by law. Although their shelter programmes started in the 1960s, they have yet to achieve 100% shelter coverage today. We have learnt much from these countries, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1721</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> as we formulated our own shelter policy to meet our specific needs. Perhaps the most important lesson we learnt is that it requires a considerable period of time to implement a comprehensive nationwide shelter programme. Hence, it is imperative that we proceed with the next phase of the programme now - through the incorporation of household shelters in all new HDB and private dwelling units. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Provisions of the Bill</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now elaborate on the key provisions of the Bill. As I have said earlier, the legislation is targeted primarily at new residential developments. Re-developments involving addition or renovation works will not be required to incorporate shelters. But, of course, owners can voluntarily do so, and the SCDF will gladly offer advice if sought. Shelters will also not be required for housing developments meant for short term, non-private or commercial-type habitation such as hotels, boarding houses, nursing and old aged homes, hospices, service apartments and staff apartments. We will continue building communal shelters in existing housing estates as and when there are suitable new developments such as schools and community centres. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II of the Bill spells out the specifications of, and regulations for, the construction and provision of both household and storey shelters. Clause 3 of the Bill requires every new flat or house to have a shelter that meets SCDF's specifications. The shelter can be built either within each dwelling unit (termed household shelter), or at a common area to be shared by several apartment units located on the same storey called storey shelter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill specifies the duties of flat/house owners and occupiers in relation to the household and storey shelters. For example, they are allowed to carry out addition or alteration works which may affect the shelters only with the written permission and in accordance with the conditions imposed by the Commissioner, SCDF. They are also \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1722</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> required to maintain the shelter and, as necessary, carry out improvement works directed by the Commissioner. As long as the occupiers abide by these rules, they are free to use the shelter space in peacetime. However, they should promptly prepare the shelter for occupation once notice is given by the SCDF to do so. Some possible uses of the household shelter space include a pantry or study area or even storeroom, while households provided with storey shelters could use them as storage space. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parts III and IV of the Bill provide similar legislation for public and improvised shelters respectively. Clause 5 of the Bill will empower the Commissioner, SCDF to require Statutory Boards to build public shelters in non-residential buildings which they own. Clause 6 specifies the duties of the Statutory Boards in relation to the public shelters; these are similar to the provisions in clause 4 for household and storey shelters. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill will empower the Commissioner, SCDF to designate suitable buildings as improvised shelters during emergencies. But he can exercise these powers only when the Minister for Home Affairs deems a Proclamation of Emergency imminent or when he deems it necessary in the interest of public safety. Such an order can be in force for only seven days unless the President decides otherwise. Clause 8 specifies the duties on owners or occupiers of improvised shelters; these are similar to those in clause 4 for household and storey shelters. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Bill touches on the use of shelters during a state of emergency. Clause 9 empowers the Commissioner to serve a notice requiring owners or occupiers of any shelter to prepare it for occupation during a state of emergency. In the case of non-compliance, the Commissioner or any authorised person may enter any storey, public or improvised shelter to prepare it for occupation, and recover the costs and expenses incurred in doing so from the occupier or owner. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 12 to 29 in Part VI of the Bill provide the Commissioner, SCDF with \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1723</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> additional powers which he would require to regulate and enforce the law effectively. These include empowering the Commissioner and his authorised officers to enter and inspect any premises and shelters. There will be a consequential amendment to the Building Control Act (BCA) so that a shelter as defined under the Shelter Bill will fall within the definition of `building' in the Building Control Act. This will enable the submission and approval of shelter plans, construction and commissioning of shelters, and any addition and alteration works to shelters to be governed by the BCA and its regulations. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Conclusion</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry will give the private sector a grace period of six months after the Bill has been enacted before enforcing the new legislation. This will allow building plans which are already in an advanced stage of preparation or have already been submitted to be approved without any shelter requirements. It will also allow the building industry time to familiarise themselves with the shelter requirements. The duration of the grace period was decided in consultation with URA and professional bodies such as the Singapore Institute of Architects and the Institute of Engineers of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enactment of the Civil Defence Shelter Bill is a significant milestone in the Government's efforts to provide shelters for the protection of all Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the Bill. I also welcome the six-month grace period, as announced by the Minister, for developers. But, nevertheless, there are cost implications and I wonder how the implementation of this Bill will affect land which have been tendered but building plans have yet to be submitted to the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question for the Minister is that over the long term, will there be adequate places for all Singaporeans? And if there are not, will there be any plans for the Government to impose on \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1724</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> old buildings to be retrofitted with civil defence shelters? If that is the case, who will bear the cost, Sir? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is always very difficult to appreciate, especially in peacetime, why we put so much emphasis on the defence of our nation for any eventuality of war. Even in this House, questions have always been asked by Opposition Members as to why we are spending so much on defence and why we require our National Servicemen to undergo such intensive training. But we live in a very unpredictable world and anything can flare up at the snap of a finger. Therefore, it is prudent to always expect the unexpected and never be caught unprepared. The security of our nation not only requires the ever preparedness of our SAF, every Singaporean has to share the responsibility of ensuring our nation's stability and safeguarding the life of our people. The proposed Bill to require various premises to be provided with CD shelters is definitely one of the necessary measures that has to be taken. It will not only provide the physical protection to our people in times of war or civil commotion, it will also give everyone a sense of security now that there are safe places to take refuge in times of need. However, I would like to comment on three areas where I hope the Minister can respond. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, this Bill covers new houses and flats and new buildings which are subdivided into flats to be provided with CD shelters. It also empowers the Commissioner of the Civil Defence Force to require CD shelters to be provided by new buildings or buildings owned by statutory boards. But what about commercial buildings such as shopping centres, offices and entertainment complexes, and also educational buildings such as schools, tertiary institutions or any such civic buildings? Are they not required to provide the necessary CD shelters? These are buildings that will have a great number of people gathering in them at some time or another. Therefore, the provision of CD shelters would be of utmost importance. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1725</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, although a lot of existing buildings such as MRT stations and community centres and, I believe, certain underground car parks are already provided with CD shelters, I wonder how many Singaporeans really know that such CD shelters exist. For example, in our community centres, most of our CD shelters are being used for various purposes such as gymnasium, senior citizens' corner, conference room, etc, as they should be, because it is important for us to maximise the use of all built-up areas and not leave them idle to serve a purpose which hopefully would never be required. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is obvious that all Singaporeans must be aware of the existence as well as the location of such CD shelters. I would suggest that locations of these shelters be made known to all Singaporeans through wider publicity and the provision of clear directional signs. It can be similar to those provided for MRT stations, community centres or some important public buildings. I think it would also benefit everyone if a logo could be popularised to denote such a shelter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, since developers already have to bear additional costs to construct these shelters in their developments, although I do not think any of them would object to such a provision, I would suggest that the area occupied by these shelters should not be included in the gross floor area (GFA) of the development so as not to lessen the buildable area which they are entitled to by the given plot ratio. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, contrary to what the hon. Member for Hong Kah has said, the Opposition do appreciate that adequate provisions must be made for the defence of our country. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I suppose the building of Civil Defence shelters in new houses, new flats and other buildings must be part of the Total Defence strategy of this country. I am in agreement that Civil Defence shelters must be built. But I do not agree with some parts of the Bill. The widespread \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1726</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> building of CD shelters to meet emergency needs is something new to Singaporeans. As the Minister has said, this is not new in some countries, in particular, Switzerland. I believe that, in Switzerland, they have been building CD shelters even before World War II. Probably, due to their thorough preparedness, that was a contributory reason for the country not being devastated like the other European countries in World War II. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a small country with densely built-up areas. In times of war, the civilian population has nowhere to run to unlike other countries with a big land mass, for example, Russia. When the Germans attacked Russia in 1942, the civilian population could retreat with the army to its vast hinterland and the army could fight back from there. Singapore has no such hinterland. The civilian population, in times of war, has no countryside to run to. They can only hide in the CD shelters if there are enough of them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to touch on the Bill. Sir, I do not agree with clause 3(1) which imposes a duty on new house owners to provide household shelters in accordance with the specifications. Land is very scarce and expensive in Singapore and it is not fair to make a land owner to sacrifice part of it for a shelter, if the piece of land is really small. There may be a case for persons who own big pieces of land, say, 10,000 sq ft and above. But for persons who own small plots of land, it is not right to ask them to put aside part of it for a shelter which they may never use in their lifetime. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Government should do is to build more communal shelters in private housing estates so that these shelters can be used by private house owners. Of course, if the private house owners want privacy, they can on their own build shelters on their land. I would propose that the Government build more communal shelters on public land rather than try to construct shelters in houses and buildings. These communal shelters could all be built underground so that the surface land above the shelters can be gainfully used. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1727</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill does not state the specifications of the shelters. I am curious to know what level of safety these shelters are supposed to give to the people who seek refuge there. Are these shelters strong enough for only civil commotions and emergencies? Or are they built for conventional wars? Are these shelters supposed to be built to withstand nuclear wars? Are these shelters built to protect Singaporeans when there is a nuclear attack? If there is a nuclear attack, are these shelters built to the specifications to withstand only low tonnage nuclear bombs? Or are they also built to withstand higher tonnage nuclear bombs? I would like the Minister to clarify. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that town councils have to maintain such shelters if they are built on common property. In this respect, is the Government going to give a grant to the town councils to maintain the shelters built on common property under their charge? If the Government does not give such a grant, it would place further financial burden on these town councils because their income is only from the service and conservancy charges, which are just enough to maintain their estates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask about the costs of building these shelters. What is the cost that each house owner has to bear? Perhaps, the Minister could answer this. Would this cost be tax exempted? In the course of building shelters in multi-storey buildings, what is the percentage of the cost of the shelters when compared to the building as a whole? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was not in the House when the Minister introduced the Bill. But I would like to know from him whether there is any particular reason for introducing this Bill at this time. I hope I shall not be thought flippant if I say that my immediate reaction when I saw this Bill presented to Parliament was to ask, \"Oh, are we in imminent danger of invasion from another country? Or is there an imminent danger of insurgency breaking out in the country?\" So I should like to know what has prompted the Government to bring in this Bill at this point of time. One would have thought, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1728</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> following the news everywhere, that the world is becoming more peaceful except I suppose in certain areas where you have local wars. Do we have real fears in Singapore about some country in this region going to war with us? I suppose I will be told these are questions which I must not ask. The government knows best. But I think people must be told why we now find it necessary to have household and storey shelters built all over Singapore. And it is not being provided by the Government. It has got to be paid for by the owner of the house, which means someone who is building his new house has to go to the extra expense of providing a shelter and even when it is being built by developers. The developers are not going to absorb the cost, are they, of providing the shelters. It will be passed on to the purchasers of the apartments. So this is throwing another burden, another expense, to purchasers or builders of new homes and purchasers of apartments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam has rightly pointed out that if it is necessary, should the Government itself not provide public shelters in all parts of Singapore, especially in areas where there are big concentrations of our people, so that people may seek shelter there. To ask our citizens to put up the cost of providing shelters which, as Mr Chiam has again rightly pointed out, they may not find it necessary to use, is adding an unnecessary cost and expense on our people and it is not as though they have got a lot of money to spare. I would, therefore, like to hear something from the Minister when he replies as to why the Government has considered it necessary to introduce this Bill at this moment of time. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, let me first deal with the questions raised by Mr Chng Hee Kok. He asked whether land that has been tendered already would be affected by the CD Shelter Bill. For land that has already been tendered or not tendered, it really has nothing to do with the CD Shelter Bill. As far as the developer or whoever buys the land is concerned, it is the final selling price of whatever purpose they put the land to. If it is a commercial building, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1729</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> they will factor into account the cost of constructing the building. If it is for residential purposes, they will factor into account the need to provide a shelter, whether it is a storey shelter or household shelter. Only those building plans which are to be approved six months after the coming into force of the Bill will be required to include CD shelters. For those plans, that have already been submitted, we will give them enough time so that approval can be given for the plans and they will not be affected. In other words, when they have decided to tender for the land and price the homes or flats for sale to the people, that is, before this Bill comes into force, they will not be affected. It is only after the six-month period after the Act comes into force that they have to take into account the need to build CD shelters. We have consulted the professional organisations as well as some developers on the length of time that is needed to prepare for new building plans and we were told that the six-month grace period is enough. That is why I mentioned the six-month grace period. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng asked whether there will be enough shelters for all our people. Since the building plans started in 1983, it is about 14 years now, I think we have about 274,000 shelter berths and most of these are in public shelters such as MRT stations, schools, community centres, void decks, underground, etc. It is only since 1994-1995 that we started to have HDB flats incorporate household shelters in the flats. So with the development in Hougang, about 900-odd units already have these household shelters. And with the building programme of about 30,000 units of HDB flats a year, we expect, over time, more and more people will be covered. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the requirement that new homes should have shelters, we are also building public shelters in the 14 MRT stations in the North East line. Since the programme started in 1983, we have built 274,000 shelter berths and 20 years down the road since the programme started, in 2003, 40% of our people would be covered \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1730</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> by shelters. So there ought to be enough shelters as time goes on, unless we expect trouble in the year 2003, which I do not think is a likely scenario. Many countries which started their building programme long ago are still unable to provide adequate or enough shelters for all their people. Switzerland, Finland and Sweden are examples. It would take a very long time for us to provide enough shelters for all our people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen asked about shelters in commercial buildings and shopping centres, etc. We expect that in times of tension and hostility, people would most likely want to stay indoors rather than to go shopping. But if they are around the shopping complexes and there are no shelter spaces, there are still places such as MRT public shelters where they can take cover. So we do not think there is a need to require commercial buildings to have shelters. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also said that more campaigns should be conducted to create more public awareness that we have shelters. Since the programme started, we have conducted a number of campaigns on a regular basis. In 1988, for example, we had a major public shelter programme exercise in Tiong Bahru. The following year, we had it in Lavender Station. In 1991, we had an exercise in Braddell Station. In 1993, we had an exercise in Newton Station. And last year, we had another exercise in Tiong Bahru MRT Station. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the void deck community centre-type of shelters, I think the residents are aware that these are shelters, because some of them do go there. They send their children there for kindergarten classes or to buy things in bookshops, etc. Many of these shelters have been put to use, and when residents go there they would know that these are public shelters. But I will ask the SCDF to study whether we need to put up more direction signs that there are public shelters in these places. When the time comes when we need these shelters, definitely, we will conduct very extensive public awareness exercise to tell people where these shelters are. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1731</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chen also suggests that the shelter space should not be included in the gross floor area. The amount of space taken up by the additional thickness of the wall for the household shelter is actually very minimal. Take the example of a 4-room unit. From what I am told, the additional space taken up due to the increased width of the wall is only about 1.5% of the total floor area of the flat. So there is actually no need to exclude this part of the household shelter from the calculation of the GSA. Similarly, for other types of development, I think there is also no need to exclude the shelter space from the GSA because shelter space is not an empty space. Shelter space is actually a space that can be used as a room, a storeroom, or as a pantry. Or in the case of a storey shelter, it can be a very large storage area. There is no need to make separate provision to exclude the shelter space from the GSA. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam has noted that other countries have shelter programmes but they have taken a long time to build, and that is our plan too. It will take us a very long time to complete our shelter programme. But he said that he does not agree with clause 3(1) which requires households to have household shelter, particularly for people who own a small piece of land. If they own a small piece of land, they can build an underground shelter in the basement. Or they can turn that shelter into a room shelter or household shelter like an HDB flat and make good use of that household shelter. Actually the shelter does not eat into the small land that the land owner may have. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about the type of protection that the shelter will give. I believe that the technical people and the SCDF people, when they discussed the requirements and specifications, although these are not stated here because they may change from time to time depending on the kind of threats that we perceive, would have taken into account the need to provide adequate protection. But, of course, the more stringent provision we make, the higher the cost. And if we are going to take into account all kinds of scenario including nuclear blast, then I think the cost will be much higher. I do not think \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1732</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> that is the intention right now because we have to assess realistically what are the likely types of weapons that are going to hit Singapore and then make a realistic provision for the shelters. I believe that this will be in good hands and have been studied and I will leave it to the technical people to consider upgrading the shelters as time goes on and as we build new shelters. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam asked who bears the cost. I just said that the household shelter is actually the space within the home. And if it is within the home, then whoever uses the home will have to pay. In other words, the home owner will have to pay for the cost. The cost is not really that phenomenal. From what I know, for a 4-room flat, for example, at current price, it ranges from $6,000 to $8,000 for the strengthened space. And it works out to be about 4-5% of the price of a HDB 4-room flat. For a 5-room flat, it is about 2-3%. For a private flat, it is about 1-2%. And the larger the development, I suppose the smaller the percentage, depending on how many people they need to put into that shelter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the answer is quite simple. Home owners who use the shelter will have to pay for it. It is not wasted space like Mr Jeyaretnam suggests. He asked, why are we doing this? I hope he was in the House when I was outlining the rationale for this Bill. I said that Singapore must be prepared for all eventualities. Today, we are peaceful and we hope that the region will remain peaceful forever. But we cannot take things for granted and we must be prepared. And building shelters, conducting civil defence exercises and various things to make sure that we are well prepared for any eventuality is the right thing to do, which only a farsighted Government like the PAP would think of, and not people like Mr Jeyaretnam. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have dealt with all the questions, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I would like to know who maintains town councils' shelters and whether the cost would be tax exempted. What about the level of protection? If the safety level of these shelters is not adequate, they might give a false sense of security to the citizens. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1733</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Let me deal with the question of adequacy of protection. Right now, from what the experts have studied, the level of protection is adequate. As regards town councils' shelters, like any public space, they will have to maintain them. They will have to share the cost with the residents who use the space. It is like any other public space. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> What about tax exemption? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> These are expenses which the household would normally incur for their own protection. So there will be no question of tax exemption. There is no need for tax exemption. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, point of clarification. The Minister says that after constructing these shelters, the residents may use them for whatever purpose they would like to put them to, and he suggests storeroom. If a resident stacks up all his old furniture or other things in the storeroom, what good will that shelter be when it comes to an emergency or wartime? Someone has to remove everything out first. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I think a primary 6 student will be able to answer that question. When you have no need to use the shelter, you use it as a storage space. You put whatever you want into the room for storage. But when tension comes about and when you need to use the shelter for protection, I am sure you would do the wisest thing in the world to save your own life and remove those things. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Does the motion have the support of any other hon. Member? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, it has my support. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House resolves (i) that an independent committee, consisting of persons outside the Government, be appointed to review all salaries and allowances presently paid to Ministers and to make recommendations on the salaries and allowances that should be paid commensurate with the responsibilities and functions of the Ministers; and (ii) that the committee do have the power to invite representations and hear such evidence as it may think necessary to arrive at its recommendations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no doubt that I shall be accused of indulging in politics of envy and being invidious and even of perhaps wasting the time of this House on matters which have already been decided upon by this House. The last time I moved a motion for the appointment of an All-Party Committee, the writer for the Lianhe Zaobao started off by whining that I had kept the House till past 8.00 pm, talking on something which was quite unnecessary. I expect I shall get no better treatment. But that will not deter me from doing what I think I should do in this House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I assure the Ministers particularly and this House that it is not politics of envy, rather it is the judicious use of our monies. It does not follow, Mr Speaker, Sir, that because we have huge surpluses, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1735</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> we have accumulated huge reserves, that we should pay Ministers a lot more than what the job as Ministers, as Prime Minister, demands. If we do have a lot of money, I can think of other ways in which that money can be used. There are crying needs in our community which have been neglected and the monies could perhaps be used for those needs in the community. So it is, may I assure the House, not politics of envy. But it is to try and draw attention again, if necessary, to what would appear to be a glaring anomaly in our country. I shall point out what the glaring anomaly is later. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the present salaries were accepted or adopted, the Government presented a White Paper which was headed, \"Competitive Salaries for Competent and Honest Government\" justifying the salaries which it proposed for the Ministers, junior Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries and other officers. But I must say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I do not think the public found that very convincing. There was no attempt made to try and explain why we have to pay our Ministers the salaries that we are paying. I shall in the course of my speech point out what we are paying the Ministers, what the taxpayers are paying. But no attempt was made as to why. The market rule, as I understand it, is that you pay for the job, and for nothing else. So one would have thought that an attempt would have been made in that White Paper to try and define their responsibilities, their tasks, that lay upon Ministers and why it was necessary to pay them the salaries. On the contrary, the reasons that were advanced were that unless we paid the Ministers the salaries, we would be soon running short of Ministers in Singapore. I do not know whether that observation is justified at all. Secondly, another curious point was made that we have got to pay them so that they are not tempted while in office to try and secretly make any money. If that is the reason, it would ascribe to the people who are aspiring to be Ministers quite the wrong motives. And I do not think that is the right motive to hold out to people who attempt to go into politics. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1736</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was not explained is why it was found necessary to peg Ministers' salaries to those in the private sector. May I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a totally wrong analogy, wrong comparison, because it does not try and see what is involved or what goes with the jobs. It is totally wrong to try and compare and put on equal footing the Chief Executive Officer, the head of a multi-national company, with that of the Prime Minister of the country. I remember seeing sometime ago that somebody who was a former Minister in the UK government saying that he would rather be Prime Minister of England for a day than be the Chairman of the Bank of England. They are two different things. And so it is wrong to try and peg salaries to those in the private sector. For one, as I said, has anyone drawn up a balance sheet of the responsibilities of the Chief Executive Officer in a big multi-national company and that of a Minister? I am quite confident that if that balance sheet is drawn up, it will be found that the Chief Executive Officer of the MNC would have far greater responsibilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is wrong because of its lack of transparency. I assume that the decision was taken by Cabinet, but again we were not told by what route the Cabinet arrived at these salaries. May I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, with all respect to the Ministers, that it is not really seemly for the Ministers themselves to decide what they should be paid and what they are worth. The judgment should be made by the people or by people who are qualified to make that judgment. In other countries, they have Commissions on salaries for Ministers which decide what should be the proper pay for Ministers. Why don't we have one in Singapore? We have the National Wages Council, Mr Speaker Sir, which deliberates on what wage increases should be given to our workers year by year. Why do we not have a National Salaries Commission which will try and provide the guidelines for Ministers' salaries, and not only just Ministers' salaries but for salaries in the public service, in the statutory boards and in the Government? Why not? That would make everything more transparent and allow the taxpayers to see that somebody \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1737</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> outside those affected by the salaries make the decision. It is not that Singaporeans are not prepared to pay the Ministers what they should be paid for their jobs. They are not being grudged that. But as in all things, we have got to keep a sense of proportion. That is important. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, Mr Speaker, Sir, sent to the Clerk two tables. I have not asked for them to be circulated to every Member in this House. I thought perhaps we should not waste so much paper, but they will be available for anyone to look at and they may help the Chief Reporter when it comes to reporting today's proceedings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One table is the monthly wages in Singapore in 1996, Mr Speaker, Sir. And may I assure the House that I have not just plucked this out of my head, as was suggested last time when I said something, that I just come out with figures, and it was even reported in the press that \"Mr Jeyaretnam claims\". These figures are taken from the Ministry of Labour's Labour Force Survey for 1996. We have 136,321 employees in Singapore who earn below $400 a month. And we have 76,040 who earn between $400 and $599. We have 107,932 who earn between $600 and $799. And 140,792 who earn between $800 and $999. Then we have 361,572 employees who are only paid between $1,000 and $1,499 a month. And finally, for my purpose, we have 271,412 who are paid between $1,500 and $1,999. The total number of workforce in Singapore is 1,748,140. And if you add up those who are earning below $2,000 a month, you get 62.58% earning below $2,000 per month. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set against that, which are the wages in Singapore, we have the Ministers' salaries, and this I have taken from the answer given in Parliament by the Minister for Finance in a Question for Written Answer, I think, tabled by the MP for Hougang. These figures are for 1995. And what do we find? The Prime Minister was paid a total of $1, 271,000. May I say straightaway that they are gross salaries, including allowances, not just basic. And \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1738</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the Senior Minister was paid an annual gross salary of $1,703,000. The Deputy Prime Ministers were paid $1,314,000. Ministers varied from $1,239,000 to $765,000. Senior Ministers of State, their salaries ranged from $765,000 to $549,000. And Ministers of State, their salaries ranged from $549,000 to $357,000. These are all annual salaries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set against the wages that our people are earning in Singapore, 62.5%, they tell a story, Mr Speaker, Sir and that is, there is gross disparity in Singapore that whilst our workers are only paid $1,000 to $2,000, the Ministers are paid huge sums, way and above what the employees are paid in Singapore. I do not want to labour this. But as I said, the average wage in Singapore would appear to be between $1,500 and $2,000 and that is for a month. And we have the Prime Minister and the Ministers being paid almost a hundred thousand dollars a month in all. There is a total yawning gap between these salaries. And I think we do all recognise, and the Ministers have often said so, that it is important that we keep wages as low as it is possible. I spoke on this during the Budget debate and also the last time I moved a motion, because we depend for our survival on being able to export whatever we manufacture or produce in Singapore at competitive prices so that they would find a ready market at the prices that we offer them. So we do recognise that need. But then the workers will be very justified, Mr Speaker, Sir, in asking, \"Well and good, you ask us to keep our wages down. We are prepared to do that. But what are you doing, Ministers? What are you doing about your salaries?\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things we have got to learn is that leaders must lead by example, not merely just preach. I think any leader would accept that when I say this. When the increase in water prices was made lately, the Workers' Party asked whether Ministers would give an example, instead of just raising the prices, by disrupting water supply to their homes for a few hours so that the lesson is brought home to our people. But I have never heard from the Ministers as to whether they were prepared to do that. I say, Sir, I repeat \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1739</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> again, that set against the wages paid to our workers in Singapore, the salaries paid to the Ministers are hugely disproportionate. But that is not the only comparison I have made. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have prepared another table and that is to compare the salaries of our Ministers with those paid in selected countries. I have not chosen the still-to-be developed countries but fully developed countries. What do we find if we look at that table? May I say that the figures that I give - I give not from my head - have been obtained from the respective Embassies and High Commissions. In the United Kingdom, and this is the salary for 1996, in Singapore dollars, the Prime Minister's annual salary was only $146,978, about 1/6 or 1/7 of what the Prime Minister in Singapore gets. But may I say again immediately that I do not have what allowances are paid in addition to that. But I should not imagine that even with the allowances, it would come to anything near what the Prime Minister in Singapore is paid. And the Cabinet Ministers, these figures are all in Singapore dollars, are paid $110,417 annually. And again, of course, I have not got the figures for allowances. Junior Ministers are paid $78,123. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the salaries paid in the United States, what do we find? The President of the United States, and this is for 1964, I have not got the present figures, he was paid annually, and expressed in Singapore dollars, $320,004. Whether it was inclusive of all allowances, I know not. The Secretaries of State were paid $237,432. Junior Ministers were paid $213,756. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at Australia, you will find that the Prime Minister was paid, and that was 1964 again, I have not got the figures for 1966, $204,060. Again, I know not whether he was paid any allowances over and above that. Cabinet Ministers were paid $133,380. I have not got any figures for the Junior Ministers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Zealand, I have the figures for 1996, and the Prime Minister there is only paid an annual salary of $183,645 but I have also got the allowances for him. He \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1740</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> is also paid allowances totaling $29,205. And the Deputy Prime Minister gets $140,085 annually and he also gets allowances ranging from $12,870 to $9,000. Ministers get $124,740 and also the same rate of allowances. Junior Ministers are only paid $113,850 to $96,030. Sorry if I have taken up time to give you these figures. But they show, by comparison, that the salaries that we are paying the Ministers in Singapore are way, way above what other countries are paying and what the Commissions, or whoever has the responsibility in these countries to determine salaries, judge to be the proper salaries for the Ministers and President of the United States and others. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said about the wages in Singapore, Mr Speaker, Sir. If you also look at the household monthly income, and this comes from the Household Expenditure Survey for 1992 to 1993, you get that for 60% of our people, the average monthly household income is only $1,920. So, I hope, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have tried to show the great discrepancy that exists in our system and it is not perhaps just the Ministers' salaries but it is also the salaries for the top civil servants in Singapore and other public officers and the rest of the population. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it to be suggested, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Prime Minister of Singapore has a more onerous task? He has greater responsibilities and duties than the President of the United States, and that he should be paid about three or four times more than the United States President should be paid? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we have a tendency to spend time gazing at our navel. We seem to be filled with our own importance of what we are worth. Singapore is, after all, and I am not stating anything that is new, a small city state with a population of three million or more at the moment. We do not have a rural problem, people scattered in remote parts where we may have problems from them. We are very much an urban community and there is no part of Singapore that cannot be reached within half an hour or even less. So it is, may I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, wrong to give ourselves too much \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1741</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> importance and imagine that our problems are far, far greater than the problems encountered by the leaders in other countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth, Mr Speaker, Sir, if it were known - I do want to say it here - is that our Ministers have very few problems. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> You are one of them! \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes, I am one of them. They will tell you that. I am sure I am one of their problems. But that is the trouble. I am glad the Member has highlighted this. We have the spectacle of a government and we saw this in the 1991 elections. We saw this in the 1997 elections. We have the spectacle of a government which appears to be frightened and afraid of having one or two opposition Members in Parliament. In 1991, the general election had to be brought forward by two and a half years for no apparent reason but ostensibly, as seen by the public, so that I would not be able to stand for Parliament in 1991. My disbarment was running out on 10th November and elections were held in September 1991. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, Mr Speaker, a little while ago, we have very few problems. And it is not, may I say, to try and belittle what the Ministers have done for Singapore. The truth is that the PAP Government, ever since it came into power, has gone out of its way to see that no problems will arise, and they do this simply by the imposition of fear among our people. I heard over the BBC that the Senior Minister, in the launching of his book, had said something like that it is better to be feared than to be loved. Well, there you have it. The Government in Singapore has got rid of problems, by letting it be known among our electorate, our citizens, that any least sign of any disquiet, trouble or any clamour will be dealt with severely. And, of course, they have the machinery - the Internal Security Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, what have we got in Singapore, Mr Speaker, Sir? We have a subservient press which is a national scandal who sees its role as simply to uphold the government in power. So \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1742</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> nothing is brought up which may upset the Government or give it cause for any action to be taken against the press. So we have that. And the press has a very important role to play on behalf of the citizens. It is for the press to highlight and to take the Government to task for problems, for injustices, for grievances, but that does not happen in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we have a trade union movement which is again totally under the control of the Government. The workers have been told that either they behave themselves or they might find life made very hard and difficult for them. So you do not get any problems from the workers and trade unions. They just accept. As I said in my radio broadcast, there is a general feeling in Singapore of helplessness among our people. They are a hapless lot. And so the Government gets away with everything. No problems. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the desire for people to provide an opposition in Parliament? This is visited immediately with threats and intimidation and people are deterred from standing for Parliament so that we may have a respectable opposition in Parliament. And the Government with the absence of a proper opposition again is able to get away with a lot of things, that it would not in any other country where there was a respectable opposition. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do say in all sincerity that our Ministers do not have the burdens and high responsibilities of office that Ministers in other countries have. And I think we should take note of this. I asked in the budget debate: may we know what the functions and duties of Ministers are? And I do not think I got a reply. We have a Minister without Portfolio whose task would appear to be to keep the trade unions in order and that is all, nothing else. And we have the Senior Minister, we do not really know what he is doing in the Government. We do know that he goes around, as I said, in the region preaching to all the countries in the region that democracy is not something for Asians. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my proposal in this motion that we now take steps to bring in some sense of proportion and to make the payment of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1743</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> salaries to the Ministers more transparent and this can only be done by appointing a committee. Let us have a commission on salaries, as I said, not only just for Ministers but to include even the civil servants, judges, everyone, just as we have the National Wages Council. What is the objection to such a commission or a committee, unless it be that the Ministers will feel it very difficult to justify their salaries? Is that the reason why we do not have a commission? I would urge the Ministers, as they have all been saying all the time, that there should be greater transparency particularly in the case of Ministers' salaries. They should be made the subject of public approbation. The public are the taxpayers. It is they who are paying the Ministers, and should they not account to them the justification for the salaries? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do want to end, Mr Speaker, Sir, by asking that the matter be given serious consideration. I hope that in reply I am not going to be just laughed at but an attempt is made to deal with the matters that I have raised in my speech. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the subject of Ministers' salaries raised by Mr Jeyaretnam was widely debated in this Chamber in 1993 when the Deputy Prime Minister announced the revision in salaries of civil servants, judges and Ministers. In that debate, 19 Members including three Opposition Members expressed their views. The salary revisions were substantial as the Government was concerned about the declining quality of the civil service as Singaporeans shunned jobs in the civil service for the private sector. With the rapid expansion of the economy, it was clear to all or almost all that the salaries in the civil service and the political leadership were lagging behind that of the private sector. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam mentioned about huge surpluses. I can assure him that when Government salaries are increased, it has nothing to do with the surplus. The surplus runs every year to billions of dollars. Last year, I believe we chalked up a surplus of $7 billion. And what are we talking about? The Cabinet is only paid $17 million. If they are paid on \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1744</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the basis of the surplus, I am quite sure that money is much more. Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam talked about the crying need of the population and that the Government has not met their needs. We have these surpluses. If Mr Jeyaretnam can identify the crying need, as he has mentioned, this would be looked into, but certainly Ministers' salaries have nothing to do with surpluses generated by the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this revision of salaries in 1993 came in about four years after the previous revision exercise in 1989. The issue was again extensively debated in 1994. This time, the debate was on the White Paper on Competitive Salaries for Competent and Honest Government: Benchmarks for Ministers and Senior Public Officers, mentioned by Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this was a landmark event, in that salaries for Ministers and senior civil servants were to be benchmarked against salaries of six key professions in the private sector and were to be adjusted regularly. This was a politically vulnerable move and issue for the Government. Yet, we all knew that it was the right and necessary thing to do. I believe the Government did not flinch. Sir, in that debate, some 29 Members expressed their views including that of Mr Jeyaretnam's colleague, Mr Low Thia Khiang and four Members from the SDP. That debate saw the participation of five Opposition Members. After the general election, today we have only two opposition Members and an NCMP. That debate on the White Paper was spread over three days. The White Paper was adopted by the House and the principle of benchmarking salaries of Ministers against the private sector pay was established. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In both debates, Mr Jeyaretnam was not present in this Chamber. This is, in my view, the only compelling reason why Mr Jeyaretnam is raising this issue. He has spent half his time talking about political freedom and the other half about salaries, and that is because he has not been given a chance to have his say in those two debates. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1745</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since re-joining this House, Mr Jeyaretnam has a very standard line in all issues and problems, ie, he is always calling for the setting up of Committees or Commissions. He has offered no positive suggestions on any other issue. I hope it has nothing to do with the haze. The debate in 1994 took place under very similar circumstances. The haze situation was bad but not as devastating as the current situation. If there is a positive correlation between the haze and Ministers' pay, I hope that the Minister for the Environment will make sure that the haze will not be a perennial affair. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the 1994 debate, as can be expected, this issue was given another public airing, this time most widely and extensively at the hustings during the general elections held in January this year. At rally after rally held by the opposition parties and in their election materials and publications, the electorate was given no respite from this issue. The public was told in no uncertain terms that Ministers were overpaid. The message to the electorate was very clear and very simple: vote opposition for cheaper government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the adoption of the White Paper, ministerial pay is now pegged at two-thirds the average principal income of the top four earners in six professions: bankers, accountants, lawyers, engineers, local manufacturing and multi-national CEOs. Put into practice in 1995, we have in place an open and transparent method of setting the pay of Ministers without having to debate this issue each time Ministers' pay has to be adjusted. However, this does not mean that salary adjustments are carried out secretively. Once the pay is benchmarked, it is reviewed by the Salaries Benchmarks Committee whose members are from the private sector. Ministers' salary is gazetted. Moreover, this does not mean that this matter may not be raised in this Chamber, as Mr Jeyaretnam has done today. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have in place is an open and transparent system in which there is an \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1746</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> established principle and salary adjustments are made to continually ensure that the political leadership and the civil service is competitive. This does not mean a continuous uptrend in salaries as some had thought. Benchmarking is an open system. It fixes relativities and it moves with the market. In 1996, ministerial pay was adjusted downwards, although marginally. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not intend to go into the details, except to say that we have in place a system of pay for Ministers which I am sure many countries would like to adopt. Pay for Ministers is always a very politically sensitive issue which those on the opposing bench is wont to exploit. It is an issue very few governments are able to discuss publicly, let alone implement. Mr Jeyaretnam has made comparisons of our Ministers' salaries with those in the United States and the UK, whereas it would be more appropriate for him to make comparisons as well with developing countries. I am sure our pay for Ministers is way above those of developing countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the UK example he has quoted, I believe Tony Blair wants to move, but he is not able to do so. When Margaret Thatcher resigned as Prime Minister and was removed from the Party's leadership, she had very lucrative book contracts and speaking engagements. In the US, there is a price for public service. Secretaries of State or other Secretaries, ie, the Cabinet Ministers, do lobbying jobs after their stint in government. In fact, all Presidents have lucrative book contracts as well as speaking engagements. So there is a price to be paid for all this. But in Singapore, we are too small. There is no room for such activities. We do not lobby. Parliament is not a lobbying area for anybody. So this is what the system is all about in the UK and the US. If you look at the system of government in developing countries, the contrast is even more stark. Our Ministers get a pay which is perhaps a lifetime pay for a Minister in a developing country. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the underlying message to any educated person is very clear. What are they paying for? Sir, ours is a very unique \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1747</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> system and given time more Singaporeans must come to the conclusion that it is a system which works, just like the way the HDB has been created to provide housing for a great majority in a very fair and systematic basis; the way the CPF was created, and even in time, Sir, the COE, and everything which goes towards securing Singapore's future and our children's future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not intend to go into the arguments which were well covered in the debates of 1993 and 1994. Mr Jeyaretnam has not advanced any new arguments today. But there are two issues which I thought I should address. He says that the CEOs of multi-national companies have greater responsibilities than that of our Ministers. I have been in the private sector. I have managed companies. I have seen how companies have performed under poor or even dishonest managements. When a private company goes under, there could be a possible rescue attempt. If there is no rescue attempt, Sir, at the end of the day, shareholders lose some of their savings and part of the money they invested in the company. Life goes on. They still have their jobs. They save up more money, and they invest in other companies. But applied to Singapore, where does this leave us? I shall cover this in the later part of my speech. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point was the scope of the job. He says that we do not have a large rural population where people are scattered widely. We are a very urbanised people. He said we are a small country. The message is very clear. He seems to imply that we are more easily manageable. Sir, this contradicts his whole argument. Countries with large rural populations and large land masses are the countries, if there are economic and political problems, which enable the people to go back to the land. They can still farm. The worker who loses his job in Bangkok can go back to his father's farm or go back to his farm in his village and continue life. But in Singapore, with no natural resources and an island with three million people, could Mr Jeyaretnam answer the question? Is it more easily manageable than a large country with a rural population? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1748</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, recent events have reinforced the view that we must be on the right track. Whilst neighbouring countries suffer from the currency turmoil, we remain relatively unscathed. In the last three months, the Thai baht has lost nearly 30% of its value against the US dollar. The Malaysian ringgit depreciated by one-quarter. The Philippine peso fell by about a similar margin and the Indonesian ruppiah about 35%. We lost about 10% of our value against the US dollar because our economies are linked with those of our neighbours. But as the Minister for Finance has pointed out this morning, measured against the basket of currencies of our major trading partners, I think the Singapore currency stood up very well. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stock markets also in those countries fell in tandem. Some consider us Singaporeans very lucky, Sir. In the rush to shop in Johor Baru, Singaporeans may not realise that the strong Singapore dollar is the result of years of healthy budget surpluses and prudent fiscal policies and large current account surpluses. The fact that we are spared the upheavals of our neighbours is not just good fortune. Money spent on infrastructure and development has always been done on the basis of sound policies. Despite our growing surpluses, even the investment on our MRT was done after about 10 years of study and only after the Government was convinced of its economic viability. Infrastructure expenditures are very big ticket items, and if we are to spend our money on large scale projects, unless under sound financial considerations, and no other consideration, then the Singapore dollar may not have been spared. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are seeing first-hand how poor and unsound policies can have a serious impact on the lives of those who are affected. In Thailand, it was reported that as a result of recent events, two million Thais may be unemployed soon. Just in the Business Times of 4th October, there was a story of how a high-flying former Managing Director of a securities company is now selling sandwiches in a make-shift stall just to eke out a living. There is another story of a former finance executive who is now driving a taxi. So \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1749</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> much for Mr Jeyaretnam's sense of proportion. When a country is mismanaged, property values go down, the economy comes to a standstill, jobs are lost and everyone loses. But let us not forget that this finance executive who is now selling sandwiches has a much better chance of getting a job overseas if he is qualified for the job than a person who has lost his job in a factory. I believe the Thai economy will recover in a few years while the current problems are being sorted out. But in the meantime, there is gloom and uncertainty. In a recent business visit I made to Bangkok, I could actually make it to a few appointments in one day, which is quite unheard of, considering the Bangkok traffic. These are abject lessons and illustrate most vividly what unsound and poor policies, especially economic policies, can do to a country. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson here obviously is leadership - political leadership. Ask any citizen of those countries who is affected by the currency turmoil, and I am quite certain that he will rather have a system in which political leaders are reasonably well paid for the job and persons responsible for policy decisions should stay out of business. In this way, hopefully, with competent persons in charge, policies will be implemented for the good of the country and its people, and not for personal or vested interests. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a strong nexus between political leadership, economic management and people's welfare. Time and time again, in several countries, poor and dishonest leadership has led to mismanagement of the economy. When this happens, you have read in the papers, some people pay with their lives, not just their jobs. Let us not leave this to chance. But at what price for such a political leadership? I have no more to add than to say that this issue has been settled in the debate and by the adoption of the White Paper in 1994. Therefore, I do not see any pressing need for a review at this time and I urge Members to reject this motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1750</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak against the motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I was listening to the NCMP delivering his message when speaking on the motion, the first thing that struck me was his statement that he has no intention to indulge in any politics of envy. But as I saw him unravel his speech, it became clear to me that what he was indulging in was not anything but the politics of envy. He also highlighted that he wanted to ensure that there was judicious use of our public monies. Here, I would like to highlight that from what I look at the Government over the past years, I think our Government is one that makes judicious use of public monies. I would like to cite two examples. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first example that I have noticed is that some Ministers carry two portfolios. The easiest option for the Prime Minister or the Government in power would be to allot each ministerial post to each individual so that everybody does not carry too much of a load, but by burdening a Minister with two portfolios, the Government is not wasting money but, in fact, is making judicious use of money. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing that struck me while I read the previous Hansard reports was the Prime Minister's statement made in Parliament in 1994 when he disclosed that although he was in a position to pay up to two months' bonus to Cabinet Ministers, all he had paid was 0.9 month's bonus on the average. These two cases clearly highlight that the Government is very conscious of making judicious use of public money. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a few other arguments which I think were based on fallacy. Sir, first and foremost, Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam nearly got away by stating that the CEO in an MNC has got far more responsibilities than a Cabinet Minister. Sir, I beg to differ. The CEO of a company is only interested in money and profit. He is not interested in ensuring the lives of individuals. Our Cabinet Ministers, besides looking after the financial aspect of Singapore, are also responsible for the lives of Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1751</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> They decide our security, they decide our defence, and they make life-threatening decisions. So they are holding far more responsible position than a CEO would. In any event, Sir, I beg to differ that a CEO of an MNC holds much more responsibility than a Cabinet Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He again highlighted and compared the salary of a worker who earns $2,000 to a Minister. Here again, the basis of comparison is totally incorrect. First and foremost, an apple should be compared with an apple, not with an orange. We are talking of people who are highly capable who are going to be at the apex of their career when they are called upon to serve in the Cabinet. If at all, they should be compared with the people who hold a similar position outside Government. So if we are talking about a Cabinet Minister, we should look at the person with the same capability, with the same ability, with the same talent, who is doing the same job in the private sector and see what he is earning. That is a fair basis of comparison. In that respect, I was sad to note that the hon. Non-Constituency Member was unable to cite any statistics or figures on compensation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I was even more startled when the hon. Member, Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam, was quibbling about the fact that the responsibilities of Ministers are unknown to him. This is even more startling to me because he being a lawyer in private practice must be very familiar with the Westminster model of government. He must be very familiar with the responsibilities of Ministers in the Westminster model and if at all, he needs assistance, then I would strongly recommend that he look at the Budget Statement very carefully because the Budget Statement for one, in the designation and responsibility of the Ministry, clearly outlines what are the responsibilities of the various Ministries and the Ministers. Similarly, the other book, like Singapore 1997, also goes on to enlighten the responsibilities of the various Ministries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the motion that is before the House today. Before one looks at the motion itself, it is very important that we look at the existing \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1752</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> system and see whether there is something wrong with the system that we need to reform the system, as suggested by the NCMP. First and foremost, the existing system envisages the PM as the leader of the Cabinet who makes decisions who to recruit and how much to compensate them. Sir, he is in a position to look both at the Cabinet Minister's or the political appointee's past records, his present performance and his future potential in deciding how much a person should be rewarded in his job. This job is something that involves a lot of decision-making. The Prime Minister in his position, Sir, is privy to a lot of decisions which may not come into the public sphere. It involves policy decisions, it involves in some cases even mistakes that could have been made by Ministers. These are things which will never surface in public and should never surface in public because they will affect the moral, dignity and standing of Members of Parliament. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> No. Transparency of Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ravindran:</b> No. There is such a thing as Cabinet responsibility. Sir, the Prime Minister has a heavy burden. He looks at the team in picking up the Cabinet Members. In respect of the performance of Cabinet Members, I think their performance, besides being judged by the Prime Minister in his capacity as the leader of the Cabinet, is also judged by the public. Members of the Cabinet are seen in press conferences, in debates in Parliament and in various forums where their performances are gauged by the public. If at all, Sir, there is any complaint about any performance, the right forum for Members is both in this House and also as far as Singaporeans are concerned, is to exercise that right in the general election. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todate, Sir, the hon. Member has not been able to cite any form of abuse by the Government in this area of remuneration of our Members of Parliament. If at all, the evidence seems to indicate that our Prime Minister has been very stringent in rewarding our Members of Parliament. Again, I would like to highlight the fact that in 1994 in the course of a debate in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1753</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Parliament, it was mentioned that he was only paid 0.9% as an average for bonuses for the political appointees. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> 0.9 month. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ravindran:</b> 0.9 month, correct. Thank you. Sir, if at all, the existing policy is able to attract the best for the best pay. I think the nature of the decision-making process is something that should be left to the Prime Minister in view of the sensitivity of the matters involved and also the fact that if these matters come out in public, it is something that will affect the dignity and standing of our Ministers in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there was fear that the formula was designed in such a way whereby it only goes up, I was one of those who was happy when the Government disclosed early this year that because the top income taxpayers bracket had gone down, as such the salaries for both the Government Ministers and the senior civil servants were downgraded because of the drop in income. So it is not a case where this formula is designed whereby it only moves upwards but it is also designed to ensure that when the top earners' income tax goes down, the Ministers' income and the top civil servants' income go down also. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in respect of the proposal that is before the House, one needs to look at it very carefully, although Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam did not take us through in great detail about the Committee that he intends to set up. The first question, Sir, where one has to ask is: who sits on this Committee, and who appoints them? It is not everybody in Singapore who understands the nature of a Cabinet Minister's job. Very few of us really are in a position to assess what a Cabinet Minister does in his job and whether he does it well and whether he does it poorly. So I think the best persons who will be able to decide will be the ex-Cabinet Ministers or individuals who have served in top positions. Here again, even if the Government sets up a Committee and the Committee is staffed by ex-Cabinet Ministers or top civil servants, the same accusation will come \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1754</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> from the NCMP saying that the Committee that has been appointed is not one that is impartial but one that is subservient to the Government or one that is not totally independent. So we cannot run away from the fact that whatever that the Government does, the Government will be repeatedly accused that it is not setting up something that is independent. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I would like to highlight is that it is unclear as to what is the nature of the work of this Committee. Will the Prime Minister and the Cabinet Ministers be required to appear before this Committee to justify their salaries? Must what they have done in the past be disclosed to the Committee? Sir, all these things are very serious matters but the NCMP has decided to be silent on these points. And he is also unclear as to whether the proceedings of this Committee must be kept secret or whether it must be in public. Sir, if it is secret, the accusation will be that it is a hush-hush affair and that it is not something that is disclosed to the public. But, on the other hand, if it is made public, then matters that affect the integrity, the standing and moral of our Ministers will be up for public ridicule in certain instances. So I am not clear as to why Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam chose to keep quiet as to whether the proceedings of this proposed Committee should be open to the public or should it be secret. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, Sir, in respect of the discharge of the duties by the Minister, as Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam, the NCMP, would be aware, Cabinet works on a collective basis. Decisions that are made are made ultimately on a collective basis. So even if the Prime Minister and his Ministers go before this Committee to justify their salaries, in passing judgment on one person, at the end of the day the Committee may end up passing judgment on the rest of the whole Cabinet, and I think that is not something that is favourable or suitable in the Singapore context or in any Westminster model. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is also unclear from the NCMP's statements earlier as to whether this independent Committee's decisions will be final. If a particular Minister is unhappy \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1755</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> with the decision of the Committee, can the particular Minister take the independent Committee to the court for a judicial review on the basis that its decision was not correct? And then will this judicial review be subject to a further appeal in the Court? Then there is no end to this whole process of establishing this independent Committee of being satisfied with one set of decisions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what happens also is unclear. If the independent Committee sets a low salary benchmark, does it mean that the Prime Minister will be unable to attract very talented people to the Cabinet? Will it mean that because he is unable to attract the best into the Cabinet, he comes back to this House and says, \"Look. We need to set benchmarks. We need to change the composition of this independent Committee?\" We will all be coming back to this House to decide how do we ensure that what we pay is market rate and will be able to attract the best into Cabinet. And, on the other hand, Sir, if the independent Committee recommends even higher salary, is the NCMP going to come back into this House and still claim that, \"Look. Salaries are still too high. We need to do something about it, you know. We need to change this whole independent Committee and come out with another scheme?\" So what he proposes is not something that I think is going to do much difference to the existing system. His proposal has got several holes through which many things can go through. If at all, the trend that has appeared in many bureaucracies all over the world is to shed layers of bureaucracies, not to add on levels of bureaucracy. What the NCMP's proposal envisages is adding another layer of bureaucracy. It goes against the trend in many bureaucracies all over the world. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Ministers are constantly evaluated by Singaporeans. If at all, whether they are under-paid or over-paid or whether the salaries that are being paid to them are not justified, that decision should lie with the Prime Minister, and when he takes his team to the election, let the electorate decide. Similarly, the 1994 formula was something that was on the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1756</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> agenda of the Opposition. The people had made a choice. They were comfortable with this decision and they voted overwhelmingly for the Government's formula. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, Sir, I urge Members to reject this motion that has been put forward by the NCMP. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): First of all, I would like to thank Mr Speaker for giving me this opportunity to join in the debate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam's motion, I must say there is nothing new in his proposal. He is suggesting that a Committee be formed to review the Ministers' salaries. This is not practical at all. He should go back and study the Hansard and find out all that we had discussed concerning the Ministers' salaries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with my colleagues, Mr Chng Hee Kok and Mr Ravindran. The Ministers' salaries may look huge but they are actually very little compared to our GDP. It is only a small fraction of our national income. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to tell you a story that was reported in the newspapers in the United States, an analogy to illustrate the importance of the Ministers' job. The entire system of a certain large computer company in the United States suddenly broke down. There was some malfunction in the computer system and all the experts in the company could not detect where the trouble was. Finally, the company had no choice but to hire a senior consultant from another state and fly him in to check the system. When the senior consultant came, he conducted an analysis which lasted just a few minutes, and then drew a line on the cover of the computer and said, \"Well, you open up this part of the computer and you will find the faulty part.\" The entire system was restored in less than an hour, when the faulty part was replaced. It was as simple as that. The consultant then sent a bill for $10,000. The computer company protested, \"What? You were here for just a few minutes. All you did was to draw a line, and you are asking for $10,000 for that!\" The consultant replied, \"Yes, no doubt, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1757</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> I have only drawn a line, and for that I would charge you just one dollar. But to know where to draw the line and advising you thereof is worth $9,999!\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moral of this story is that a Minister's job is not as simple as what some people may perceive it to be. Everybody can draw a line. Anyone who can hold a pen can draw a line. But the question is where to draw the line. That is the deciding factor. It is never easy to find and recruit good talents. There is a Chinese saying: \"Getting a thousand soldiers is easy, but to get one good General is extremely difficult.\" If you want the horse to run well, you must feed it well. You cannot ask the horse to run well and do not feed it well. So if we want a team of good people to take charge of the various ministries and to look after all the billions in our coffers, we must be prepared to pay them salaries commensurate with their responsibilities. \n  <br>5.00 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the issue of Ministers' salaries has been discussed many times in this House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 1993, I announced here civil service salary revisions (including Ministers). We established the principle that salaries would be set against private sector benchmarks, which means comparable jobs, comparable qualifications, for two reasons. Firstly, because that is the alternative which is open to the civil servants and Ministers whom we are targeting. If he does not come into the civil service, if he does not become a political appointment holder, what does he become - banker, lawyer, accountant. That alternative path is what we must compare against. Secondly, that is the group which we are targeting. Those are the men and women we want in the Government and as political leaders. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam compared the PM's salary with the average monthly wage. It is not relevant. He did not compare the lawyers' salaries with the average \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1758</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> monthly wage. Why? He has a practice. Why do lawyers earn many times the average monthly wage? Because of the contribution which they make, the value added of their work makes it worthwhile for their clients, whether it is companies or individuals, to pay them and they earn their pay honestly. Why is our Prime Minister different? Not everyone who earns $2,000 a month, which was Mr Jeyaretnam's benchmark, is qualified to be a Prime Minister. For that matter, not every lawyer is qualified to be a High Court Judge, or the Attorney-General, or the Minister for Law. We are looking for special people for special jobs. And the basis of comparison must be what is the job worth and what is the man worth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the job worth means how important is the job, how much contribution can you make as a Minister, what is at stake when you make decisions, between the right decision and the wrong decision. Is it just a damaged printed circuit board or a bad housing project? Or is it the security of the country, the stability and prosperity of the economy and the livelihood of three million Singaporeans? Mr Jeyaretnam said only three million. I do not think we are so few or so unimportant. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, what is the man worth? How much can he earn? How much would he be worth in a different job in the private sector? We want that man. How do we make it not too much of a sacrifice for him to do our job? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the salary revisions in December 1993, the following year in October 1994, the Government published the White Paper - Competitive Salaries for Competent and Honest Government. The White Paper formalised two salary benchmarks for comparing the public sector with the private sector. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, at the top, Staff Grade I in the civil service which is the senior Permanent Secretary pegged to 60% of the average of the top four people in six professions - bankers, accountants, engineers, lawyers, local manufacturers, MNCs. And in the long term, we said we would go to two-thirds rather than 60% of what these 24 people earned. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1759</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have the benchmark for the middle level officers because this is a group which is pursuing their careers and very anxious about making sure that they are not left behind by any of their peers and contemporaries. So we pegged Superscale G, which is where a promising young officer should reach by the age of 32, to the 15th highest earner of that age cohort in those six professions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fixed the civil service top and middle points, and we pegged the Ministers to Staff Grade I. And the rationale is the importance of the Minister's job, because the Permanent Secretary runs the Ministry, and the Minister supervises the Permanent Secretary, he does not just preside. And his responsibilities and functions are at least as demanding as that of a senior Permanent Secretary. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the Minister does not just preside. He runs his Ministry and masters his portfolio. At the same time, he has to carry his political duties, present policies to the public, carry the ground, help the Prime Minister to lead the country. There is no mystery about what Ministers do. In fact, it was in the White Paper on page 8, if I read the paragraph: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Persons fit to be Ministers and senior civil servants should be of a calibre who would rise to the top in the private sector. A Staff Grade I Administrative Officer occupies a key post. He may be the Permanent Secretary in a large Ministry like Defence, Finance or National Development. He will often in addition be responsible for a statutory board, a major government-linked company, or other demanding projects. He carries a far heavier responsibility than a typical top private sector professional. A Minister has an even heavier responsibility than a Staff Grade I Permanent Secretary. Setting Ministers' salaries starting at Staff Grade I, with a range of grades above this to cater for the range of Ministerial jobs, is conservative.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we pegged the Permanent Secretaries, we put the Ministers on par with them and we set the Prime Minister's salary at about twice Staff Grade I. And in between, there were the DPMs, the Senior Minister and the Chief Justice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam says it is wrong to compare the Prime Minster's job or a Minister's job with a multi-national CEO, and even if you compare, the CEO will be greater than the Minister. I ask Mr Jeyaretnam, take the Chairman of a bank \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1760</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and take the Minister for Finance. Does he seriously argue that the man running a bank is more important than the man running the whole finances for the whole country and the entire monetary system and financial system? If you mess up a bank, your shareholders lose their equity, your depositors lose their savings. If you mess up the country's finances, three million people lose their houses, their CPF deposits, their livelihoods and maybe their homes. So there is no comparison. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We published the White Paper, we debated it here for four days - 31st October to 3rd November 1994. And after the debate, the House endorsed the White Paper as the basis for setting salaries of Ministers and senior officers. Mr Jeyaretnam says he wants to know what every Minister is worth, call a commission. The Prime Minister, in his speech moving this motion, debating the White Paper specifically addressed the issue of whether every Minister was worth exactly the amount he was paid in the public sector, and I quote him [Hansard, Vol. 63, No. 7, Col. 660]: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Ministers vary in their ability, and in their private sector earning power. But I have no doubt that more than half of my Cabinet would have been among the top 100 salary earners, had they opted for a private sector career. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot truthfully say that all Ministers will get what they are being paid if they were in the private sector. But in politics, I need a balanced team, to reflect the political realities in Singapore. Though a Minister may not earn the same amount in the private sector, I must be satisfied that his responsibilities and performance as a Minister, in particular, his political contribution, justify his being made a Minister. .\" And the proof of that was seen in the last general election where the Opposition candidates very carefully avoided the constituencies which they thought were held by strong Ministers and targeted constituencies which they thought were held by weak Ministers and still lost. So the Ministers earned their pay. If Mr Jeyaretnam seriously did not know what the Senior Minister was doing in Cabinet, then he should have gone to Tanjong Pagar and told the voters there that the Senior Minister was not earning his pay and they should vote for him, and he would do better, or he should go to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1761</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Marine Parade, as he tried to do in 1991, but chickened out in 1992 and did not go again in 1997. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that is the test of what the Ministers are worth. Can they carry the ground? Can they carry their policies? Can they supervise and lead their Ministries? At the end of the debate, the Prime Minister announced that he would submit his own pay, the benchmark for the Prime Minister, to be reviewed by an independent panel, which is what Mr Jeyaretnam has asked for. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we set up a panel. It comprised Michael Fam as Chairman, Fock Siew Wah, Michael Lim Choo San of Price Waterhouse, Lim Ho Kee of UBS, Sat Pal Khattar, a prominent lawyer. The panel sat and reported in January 1995. And it said in its report, I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Committee is therefore of the opinion that it is appropriate for the senior-most Minister (ie, the Prime Minister) to be paid twice the junior-most (ie, Staff Grade I) Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee would even venture that using Ave 24 (1992) as representing the full market related salary of a Minister Staff Grade I, it would be entirely reasonable to pay the Prime Minister twice that, ie, approximately $2.4 million a year.\" This was in January 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepted the report. But the Prime Minister decided and announced that he would personally forgo any salary increase for himself, arising from the recommendations of the White Paper, for a period of five years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following year, 1996 was a general election year. Everybody knew it. We knew that the Opposition would make Ministers' salaries an issue in the election. But we did not avoid the subject. We debated it openly, well before the election to make sure that it was fully discussed and everybody understood, and all arguments could be canvassed. In July last year, the NTUC invited the Senior Minister to talk to unionists. He gave a full exposition on this issue, answered questions, provided additional data, fully televised. All arguments were canvassed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1762</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come the elections, we defused the issue. But we did not submerge it. Because, as expected, the opposition and especially the Workers' Party made the Minister's salaries an issue again. Mr Jeyaretnam himself raised it at least six times in 12 election rallies and in his final Party political broadcast on the eve of the election, he raised it again. He said, \"Vote for us. We will raise this in Parliament.\" But except for one, all of the Workers' Party candidates lost, including Mr Jeyaretnam. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So as Mr Chng Hee Kok said, the Government's policy on Ministers' salaries has been fully and democratically debated and decided. In Mr Jeyaretnam's words, it is judgement by the people. It is settled. The Government has a full mandate to implement it. And the system has now operated for three years. The first two years, the benchmarks went up in 1995, it went up 15%. In 1996, it went up another 10% because that was the way the private sector was moving. This year, 1997, they went down, 18%, as the market moved. But based on preliminary IRAS data for Year of Assessment 1997, which means for next year's adjustment, the benchmark will probably rise again next year. In terms of percentage of the benchmark, we have reached 60% of the Average 24 this year, and we have announced that we will continue and aim to reach two-thirds of the average over the next four years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper stated that we would review the benchmarks after five years, which means in 1999. This was the first time we were setting benchmarks and we were not sure how it would work out in practice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, it has worked well. Because we have a proper system all the way up to the top, paying according to the market. Therefore, we have been able to reward all public officers properly, not just a small number of Administrative Officers, but also teachers, clerks, technicians, SAF officers, and also police officers whose salaries are now being reviewed. These are the problems which we have not been able to solve for years, because the whole structure was wrong and frozen, except for the SAF which was on its own and had \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1763</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> its own block vote, and its own freedom to operate. But since we have now fixed the top, the whole structure falls into place and the \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;revisions we have made for the teachers, for the clerks. Without the revisions, we would not have a proper teaching service in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we fail to pay Ministers properly because we are embarrassed about it politically, coy or unable to defend what we have done publicly here and outside, then the whole public service system is put out of joint, and the quality of the administration and of government must decline. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam cited Britain. He did not cite the recent problems Mr Tony Blair has had in implementing an overdue pay rise for himself and his colleagues. Mr Blair said, \"No, I will forgo it again.\" Because he wants pay restraint across the board and he feels embarrassed to take it, even though by any standards he is grossly underpaid. As a result, the whole British civil service is held down. Judges, etc, become underpaid, and it becomes difficult to recruit good men to maintain standards. Maybe with the British tradition of service, of landed gentry being able to do public service for free, it can continue for some time, but even they are finding difficulty operating that, and there is no Labour Party landed gentry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the comparison with other countries which Mr Jeyaretnam gave is not really relevant. He said he compared only with developed countries. Why not include more? Some of the lowest paid Prime Ministers and Presidents in the world are also the wealthiest. Mr Marcos was one of them. Why not include him in your list? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On developed countries, their Prime Ministers privately tell us that they envy us, our ability to be honest and open, and not be trapped in a political hypocrisy which they are locked into, with politicians looked down upon, unable to attract better quality, therefore, unable to raise their standing and justify a pay rise, a vicious circle. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1764</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam quoted the US President, saying about his allowances he knows not. Let me ask Mr Jeyaretnam whether he knows of the White House and the Lincoln Bedroom, Air Force One, Camp David, the best medical care in the world, and all the perquisites of being the most powerful man on earth. When Ronald Reagan retired as President, he went to Japan on a promotion trip for one company. Before he went, he was given an advance fee of US$5 million. Do you want that system in Singapore? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a revolving door, not just the President, but everybody below him. Mr Reagan had a public affairs consultant, Mike Deaver. He left before Reagan's term expired, because his currency would expire when Reagan's term expired. And he wanted to make sure he cashed in and made his money out of his contacts and his connections before the election and his friends were out of place. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We considered hiring him because we wanted to lobby on some issue, and they told me he was the hottest property in Washington - $200,000. I said, \"No, no, why not you tell him, if he succeeds, I'll pay him half a million. If he doesn't, zero.\" They said, \"No, no, you can't bargain, because he is such a hot property. You either take it or leave it?\" I said, \"Leave it.\" But many other people took him. The Canadians employed him, the Koreans employed him, and he made a good living in the time before the next Presidential election. Do we want that system? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Australians, again, Mr Jeyaretnam says allowances he knows not. Has he heard of Australian travel allowances? There is a scandal. Three Ministers have resigned because they fiddled with their travel allowances which are tax free. One opposition frontbench attempted suicide with a servile apology for letting down the people. He had claimed $300 a night. He was supposed to be out station. He went home to sleep in his mother's house. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is corruption not a problem? Sleaze is a problem with every society where this issue is not honestly confronted and openly acknowledged. Is that system better than ours? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1765</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we instituted the benchmark, there have been no signs of public sector pay outstripping the private sector. The benchmark compares with only six professions. But in the private sector, there are many other professions. So we really need to look not just at these six but also at how people in other professions are earning. It is not strictly comparable but not completely irrelevant. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we wrote the White Paper, we envisaged that the Staff Grade I (60% of Staff Grade I) would rank 134 among the private sector. And we argued that any Minister worth his salt should rank higher than 134. But based on the latest figures we have, which is last year's, Staff Grade I at 60% ranks only 280. In other words, among these six professions, we have maintained our position, but there are many other professions moving ahead in much larger numbers, and relative to them, we are losing some ground. This is the relevant comparison - a potential Staff Grade I Permanent Secretary or Minister cannot become the President of the US, but he can easily be one of these 280 people earning more than him. And if he cannot, then he should not be a Permanent Secretary or a Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most important of all is the quality of men in Government, and the quality of the government as a whole. Nobody enters politics in Singapore for the pay, because even with the market-based salaries, we are still at a discount to the private sector. But the financial sacrifice cannot be too great. Otherwise, many able men and women will be deterred from entering politics. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competitive salaries have helped us to attract and retain good men and women into the civil service and Government, and to govern Singapore well. Sure, we can pay much less and we will still have MPs and Ministers. At every price, some people will queue up for the job. But will they be the same quality? Will they be the people we really want to become MPs and Ministers? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the opposition finds it difficult to get able, honourable men to stand. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1766</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> You take Mr Chiam, formerly of the SDP, and his problems with Dr Chee Soon Juan. You take the WP which in the 1970s twice fielded Mr Wu Kher, who was a bicycle thief, and in 1991, fielded Mr Zeng Guoyuan, a Chinese physician and acupuncturist, who was subsequently convicted for molesting a woman patient. And even in 1997, it had a candidate with a criminal record. How can such people, or such political parties, raise the standard of politics in Singapore? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with honourable men, if they are well-intentioned but not up to the rigorous demands of running the country, we will quickly run into problems, never mind dishonourable men. If we want good people in Government, then we have to pay them properly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam talks about sense of proportion. What is the proportion? $15-$20 million for the pay of all the political appointment holders versus $130,000,000 for the GDP this year, 0.01% of the GDP for the top management? Is that out of proportion? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every unionist knows that when his members look for a job, he does not look for the company with the cheapest CEO. He looks for the company which is the best run, which is most successful and profitable, so that it can pay him good wages and offer him a rewarding job. That depends on having a strong CEO and a good management team, properly paid what they are worth. And I think running a country is the same. You do not volunteer to be a citizen of a country with the cheapest Prime Minister or President, not even Mr Jeyaretnam. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam said our Ministers face very few problems. The worth of the Government is measured not just by the achievements which you can see, but also by the disasters which are silently avoided. Because I am now doing the financial sector review, I have been meeting bankers. One American I met recently, an expert on futures, congratulated me on how we had kept BCCI out of Singapore. He was in Chicago, where the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) had admitted BCCI into the Chicago futures \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1767</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> market. But after a year, they found that BCCI was making suspiciously large trades, putting on big contracts one day billions of dollars, taking it off the next, and they could not figure out why and they could not figure out where the money came from. So they withdrew BCCI's licence. Lucky for them. This banker was in Hong Kong when BCCI collapsed. For three days, there were riots, as depositors who had lost their life savings scrambled to recover their funds. It never occurred to him that in Singapore there was no problem at all, because Singapore had gone one better than Chicago, and never let the scoundrels in. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not that BCCI did not try to get into Singapore. They lobbied repeatedly, at the highest levels through the most powerful channels. The American banker said that whoever resisted the pressure to admit BCCI deserved a commendation. And this was MAS, which means Koh Beng Seng who stood firm, and the Ministers who backed MAS. What is it worth for us to have the right people in charge of our monetary system, so that we avoid one BCCI? Is it worth? You can get a committee to study this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot solve this sort of problems by having MAS say no to every application. Mr Jeyaretnam says climate of fear. You do not generate growth in the financial sector by fear. We have to know which banks to let in and which to keep out, what financial activities to promote, what to discourage, which ones to prohibit. Had we not done this, the financial sector would not have grown by 10% per year for 20 years. The question now is, of course: how do we continue to grow the financial sector vigorously for the next phase, and develop new activities and adjust to a new environment, without letting in any BCCI? That is the question we are now studying and I put it to all the Members that that is the question worthy of the best brains we can find and pay for. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take another example, which is the recent currency instability in the region. The problem started in Thailand. It spread to Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. Thailand now faces severe economic austerity for at least two years \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1768</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> - slower growth, company closures, retrenchments, higher inflation, because they had to up their sales tax, depreciated currency, devalued assets. This is the price the morning after for having borrowed excessively abroad to spend on unproductive investments, especially on a property bubble, and for the government and central bank not intervening earlier, when signs of trouble were already visible and when they had been warned by the World Bank to stop a property bubble and unsound lending by banks and financial companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been relatively unaffected in Singapore. We have maintained our budget surpluses, we have built up our reserves and we have kept the currency strong. So speculators have not tried to attack the Singapore dollar. Against the US dollar, we have gone down 8%, but on a trade-weighted basis, which means that if you take all the countries which we do business with, exports, imports, its value has been stable. So when the newspapers asked why have things not become a lot cheaper because our neighbours' currencies have moved down, this is the reason. It is because our currency has remained stable overall. There is so little bad news about us to report that if you read articles on Southeast Asia's sick economies, you will come to the conclusion that there is no country in Southeast Asia called Singapore, because the charts, the paragraphs, the descriptions, the cartoons, Singapore never appears. We are mentally off the map. But it is better to be off the map than in trouble. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been fortunate to avoid the problems on our balance of payments, our property bubbles, our unproductive investments, currency depreciation, loss of confidence and withdrawal of foreign capital. Last year in May, when the property bubble started to form, we pricked it and nipped the problem in the bud. We acted even though it was an election year, and there was a risk that if we overdid the correction, the property market might crash and we would go into the elections with everybody feeling very sour. But we had to take the risk because \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1769</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> if we had allowed the bubble to continue for another year, and the property prices had gone up another 30% this year, in the year since then, this year when the region was hit by the tom yam effect, we would have been in for a severe tummy ache. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You just take a very quick back-of-the-envelope calculation. Just HDB properties alone, 800,000 HDB properties worth, let us say, $200,000 each. That is $160 billion worth of assets, not counting your CPF, not counting your private property, not counting everything else we have. If our currency had gone down 30%, or if our property market had gone down 30%, that would have been 30% of $160 billion, which would have been $48 billion. How much have we paid in premiums to avoid that disaster? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without competent, honest Government, both Ministers as well as civil servants, who can set sound long term policies and resist populist pressures, we could easily have gone the way of the other economies. Every Singaporean would have been severely affected. The value of HDB homes, CPF savings, purchasing power of your salaries would have gone down, you would not be going off to Johor Baru for midnight shopping, and the confidence of both investors and citizens of Singapore in our future would have been shaken. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But because we have had an able, determined Government, supported by a competent and professional civil service, who anticipated problems and dealt with them early, so we have stayed away from trouble. This will not be the last time that we run into a potential problem. And we may not be as lucky the next time. It makes no sense to quibble over Ministers' salaries, and to make it harder to build the best team for Singapore, by not paying the team what they are worth. Any committee of entrepreneurs, manufacturers, bankers, businessmen, or trade unionists will know that Ministers' salaries are a very small premium to pay for avoiding such catastrophes. [Applause.] \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1770</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will try and deal with every speaker in turn. May I say, first of all, that what has been said in reply to me has been said before. We have not heard anything new. I see that they have avoided some of the nagging questions that I have tried to raise. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>5.39 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me try and deal with this assumption that Singapore is what it is today because of what its Ministers have done. I do not want to belittle the efforts of Ministers. But I think to take all the credit for what Singapore today is is to do an injustice to our people who have contributed in no small way to what Singapore is today. The Finance Minister in his Budget speech acknowledged the contribution made by the workers in Singapore. So to say that Singapore would have been downhill, down in the drain, if not for the Ministers would be, as I say, to deny that the people of Singapore have had a part in the progress that Singapore has made all these years. And to suggest that it is the Ministers who have to find a solution and who come up with solutions is to gloss over the fact that Ministers are here, and in any Government, to make political decisions. That is all. For the solutions and how to go about it, they rely on people outside the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as in the 1985 recession, they appointed a Committee from outside in the business sector to advise them, and they came up with the advice which then the Government considered and implemented or rejected. I see that even this year they have a Committee. So let us not pretend that all decisions are just taken by Ministers and they have to do all the homework for themselves without any help from our people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was, I think in the last debate on Ministers' salaries, the example of the Minister for Home Affairs having to take a decision when a plane was hijacked at the Singapore Airport, and what a great \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1771</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> responsibility he had to decide on what to do, what step to take, how to proceed, and that was a very heavy responsibility. I met a police officer who now has left the Police Force and he said that all, every step in the plan, was worked out by police officers. There was a Committee or a body of officers appointed to work out what should be done if there was a hijack in Singapore. He told me that they outlined step by step and that, of course, was submitted to the Government which, I understand, was finally approved. So that was left to experts who know how to deal with that situation. Similarly, with anything else, the Government looks to experts, to people who know their jobs, to suggest the solutions or to come up with proposals. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion is that they have not put a foot wrong in Singapore. I do not know whether the electorate in Singapore will accept that. They see a number of things on which they think the Government has gone wrong or not done enough. For example, the people have not been told about all our investments overseas and whether any losses have been suffered. But from time to time, we do get information and we find that the investments have suffered heavy losses, running into millions of dollars. So who was responsible for those losses in the investments overseas? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the recent invitation to our citizens to come up with ideas to improve the civil service and told they would be rewarded for that. What are the Ministers doing that they have to depend on people outside and reward them for feeding them with ideas to improve the efficiency or the running of the civil service in the public sector? So let us not, as I said, fill ourselves with importance of ourselves. The Ministers have, as in every country, the civil service to back them. The civil service will come up with whatever is necessary to be done and all that the Ministers have to do is to take a political decision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now if I may try and deal with the various speakers on what they have said. The first speaker says that I have not tried \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1772</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to identify what the crying needs of the country are to which monies could have been put to use. I was surprised. I thought the crying needs of the country have been proclaimed, shouted out or brought out sometimes in the papers, sometimes by the people themselves, and that is the problem faced by our citizens with low income, with low wages, in making a life in Singapore. The crying needs are the higher hospital charges, the crying needs are the charges for outpatient treatment. The Government's answer to everything that would appear to be any problem, it is to raise the cost. And so we have announced recently the increase in fees for those seeking treatment at the Accident and Emergency departments. Is that the only solution that the Government can come up with? Is there no other solution? There must be a demand for this treatment. Is it not possible, as has been said, to make available other centres where people can go for their treatment without having to crowd into the Accident &amp; Emergency departments? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago, someone - I think he was a professor from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - made a comparison about how Singapore and Hong Kong had managed the economy. And his conclusion was that Hong Kong had done much better to manage the economy than Singapore. And he said that Singapore's solution appeared to be to dig deeper and deeper into the people's pockets, to take the money from the people, that there was not enough entreprenuership in Singapore as was in Hong Kong. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second speaker, as I expected, starts off by suggesting that the whole motive of my speech was the politics of envy. I expected that and, of course, got it. But no attempt is made to understand that there is this glaring disparity and whether it does us proud when other people in other countries see this glaring disparity. And then he talks about Ministers carrying two portfolios. Well, the answer is simple - because there is not really very much in that one portfolio and so the Minister can easily look after two portfolios, not because of any attempt to save money. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1773</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Really, take the Ministries of Health and the Environment, they go together - health measures. And to say that is giving very heavy responsibilities to the Minister discloses an inability to understand what the problems are. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he talks about bonus payments. He says, \"Oh, only 0.9 month's bonus was paid.\" But if he had seen what the Finance Minister said in his answer in Parliament in reply to the Question raised by the Member for Hougang in 1996, he will see that the norm was four months' bonus payments. Ministers are paid anything from one to six months' bonus. I do not know how many other countries, in addition to paying salaries, give bonus payments. Why is that necessary? No attempt is made to answer that. And then he asks, \"Should Ministers disclose their responsibilities?\" Why not? What is so secretive? If they have such heavy responsibilities, let us know. Maybe we can try and help them do their jobs if they tell us what their problems are, instead of keeping it to themselves. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he asks whether it is my intention that any Commission should sit in public. I say, yes. The whole idea of a democracy is that the people are well informed and have an opportunity to judge for themselves. That is democracy - open, transparent accountability, and we do not have that in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third speaker said I was not coming up with any practical solution. I am surprised because my solution that I was putting forward in this House was that we have a Commission to look into these salaries, so that the taxpayers will know exactly the duties and responsibilities of Ministers and they can make a judgment on how much they should be paid. He says I have no practical solution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister in his reply makes a number of points. But I am glad that he decided to have a go at the Opposition. That gives me an opportunity to reply more adequately. He said in his speech that the Opposition themselves find it difficult to get good men. Has the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1774</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Deputy Prime Minister given any thought as to why the Opposition cannot get candidates to field for election to Parliament? I thought I have tried to make that very clear. I said that in the last 1997 elections we had at least two who we considered of very good calibre as candidates, both graduates and who had been involved in public work. And they were quite anxious to offer themselves as our Party's candidates for the election to Parliament. But they were set upon by their families, by their relatives, and all because of the fear that if they got into Parliament, their families would suffer, their relatives would suffer. This is what I have said, the absence of a respectable Opposition in Parliament is largely due to the fear that is felt in Singapore quite often. And the electorate sees it. I am asked very often: how is it that you still carry on in spite of all that is being done to you? They see what has happened to other politicians, other people who have tried to offer themselves as Opposition candidates. That is why we are unable to get people, not for anything else. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says we had in 1970 a bicycle thief. I see that the bicycle thief is being resurrected. That was in 1972 only, not two elections. And that poor man, he was impaled just because at the age of 13 he was accused of being with another boy who had made some attempts to take a bicycle just parked somewhere. And he was not himself involved. [Laughter.] You laugh. His friend was just looking at it, testing it, and the Police thought he was trying to steal it, and this boy, at the age of 13, was also charged in the juvenile court and he was just, I think, given a very slight fine and discharge. So that, according to the PAP, completely put him out, suggesting that there are no skeletons in the cupboard when it comes to the PAP. Have we not had some skeletons in the cupboard? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know who he was referring to in the 1997 elections with a criminal record. I take it that the Deputy Prime Minister was referring to me. Yes, I have convictions recorded in the Singapore Courts but which the Privy Council, Singapore's highest Court of Appeal, said were all \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1775</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> wrongly passed. The convictions should never have been made. So much for the statement that the Workers' Party had a candidate with a criminal record in the 1997 elections. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is what I said in my speech. They make sure that there will be no problems for them, shut out the opposition, stop anyone raising any difficult questions and then it will all be plain sailing. Everyone will see that Singapore has got no problems, Singapore is wonderful. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned in the same vein that the Opposition did not challenge Ministers in their constituencies. The answer again is that we were hard put to get enough people. This is something that the Government should seriously consider whether we should go on frightening people, intimidating people against offering themselves as candidates for the elections. If we encourage that, then there will be no shortage of talent in Singapore. We will have the talent if only the Government ceases to be so frightened of the people and encourages open debate, open discussions and encourages them to come forward and offer themselves. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he mentions about the US President getting a lot of perks. Is it suggested that the Prime Minister gets no perks at all, that the Prime Minister of Singapore has to pay all his medical bills in Singapore, whereas the US President might get it all given to him free? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not suggesting that the worker who is paid $2,000 is good enough to be a Minister of the Government. I am not running him down, but you have to have someone with enough education and qualification to be a Minister. But the question that has to be answered is: should there be this great disparity between the $2,000 worker and the Prime Minister and the other Ministers? And the Minister also takes me to task on why I did not compare Ministers' salaries with lawyers' salaries. Well, I do know that some lawyers earn a great deal. But that is not the lot of all lawyers. Even then, I like \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1776</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to know which lawyer in Singapore, perhaps if he wishes to name, earns the amounts that the Ministers are paid. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implicit in all the speeches is the suggestion that the Ministers would have received much higher pay if they had gone into the private sector. As I said, you really cannot make a comparison between the private sector and the public sector. But we had one Minister, I think it is Dr Yeo Ning Hong, who resigned two years ago, and I thought it was said he was going because he wanted to go into the private sector. But I never saw it reported that he had gone into the private sector. Why? Is it because he was unable to get a job at the salary that he had as a Minister? He is now I see the Chairman of the Port of Singapore Authority, or whatever board that has succeeded that. That is again a public body, and appointments are made by the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have tried to deal with the various points brought up by the speakers but let me say again what I have said is that there is an inability in all the speakers that I have heard this afternoon to grasp the issues that I have raised. One of the issues of course is why is it that our Ministers must be paid several times more than the Ministers in the developed countries. Why? That has not been touched upon. Instead of that, we heard that without having good men, Singapore will go to the dogs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and negatived. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion accordingly negatived. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1776</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT TO A DATE TO BE FIXED</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That, at its rising today, Parliament do stand adjourned to a date to be fixed.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4></h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1777</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>THIRD CHILD MATERNITY LEAVE</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>6.05 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I like to raise the issue of the third-child maternity leave although I am aware that this has been brought up for consideration many times before. I beg the indulgence of all the Ministers, especially the Minister for Labour, and the Members of this House to hear me out and consider the reasons I have for testing their patience with this issue one more time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the reason for not granting third-child maternity leave hinges on the basic tenet of \"have three, or more if you can afford it\", and that affordability is reflected by the ability to circumvent `lack of leave' with `gain from tax relief' and by the ability to incur minimal or no economic burdens upon the employer and the nation. Sir, perhaps the time has come for us to reconsider these measures and consider other aspects of best home ideology. Let us also look at non-economic terms and allow our women folk a `less pace, more grace' life. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that our population policy and labour force status have to be carefully monitored and managed. However, I feel we are obliged to continually review the state of affairs and see if we can do a little better. Sir, please consider my five viewpoints concerning third-child maternity leave. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>`Basic Right' Viewpoint</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard of instances where employees are not even allowed to apply for no-pay leave for their third-child delivery due to shortage of manpower. This is a totally deplorable state of affairs for the women. It saddens me that we are unable to grant a very basic right which every new mother deserves in fulfilling one of her natural roles. Confinement is really a necessity for the new mother to recuperate and it should be regarded as a right and not a privilege. I do not want to be unrealistic; let us consider granting this leave, at least to the third child birth for the time being. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1778</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>'Population Policy' Viewpoint</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birth rate in Singapore has been stagnant for the past five years. It remains at about 50,000 per year despite tax incentives to encourage procreation through the revised population policy of 1987. Although the removal of the various disincentives may have helped, it does seem that the Third-child Special Tax Rebates (modified over the years of 1989, 1990, 1993 and 1997) are not sufficient to provide any significant effect on increasing the birth rate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the reason for this lies in the fact that Singaporeans nowadays are more rational and are very much more responsible. Singapore has to maintain high standards in order to retain its success. And, in trying to achieve this, life can sometimes be pressurising. The concerns of the people are mostly about good and successful upbringing of their children. They are not about to have more kids just because of monetary benefits alone. Furthermore, with all that generous GST rebates and additional income tax rebates, I would say a larger number of our working women need to pay little or no tax. In other words, they get no added incentives at all. The responsible Singaporean mothers may just let our birth rate fall again unless we give them all the support we can afford. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>'Higher Education and Higher Income Mothers' Viewpoint</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics have shown that the more educated mothers tended to have higher income. They also tended to have fewer children. I feel that the third-child maternity leave is more likely to benefit this group of mothers and should therefore be granted if we are targeting them to go for that third child. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past five years, the number of third child birth has been constant at between 8,000 and 9,000 each year. Noticeably, about 5,000 of these third order children every year were born to non-working mothers. My impression is that any change of policy will have no influence over this group and we will, in fact, favour the working and presumably higher income group when they \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1779</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> contribute that third child. It is noteworthy that consistently over the last few years, slightly more than half of those who bore a third child had a secondary and/or higher level of education. And, it is significant that slightly more than four-fifths of those who worked, held jobs as service workers at the very least. I feel that third-child maternity leave will induce and encourage our economically active women to stay in their jobs after the second child birth and to go for that third child. This will give us that much needed increase in population for the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an argument that the higher income and better educated group of women is in a better position to bear and to bring up successful and stable children. There is also an argument that, whereas third-child maternity leave will favour everyone equally, enhanced tax relief will favour and give this group some added incentive. Fair points, and perhaps true too. But we do notice that even of late in Singapore, scholars and super-achievers often come from lower income families. Their parents may even have no formal education at all. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>'Economic Loss' Viewpoint</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost to industry, as a result of third-child maternity leave, should not be considered an unnecessary inconvenience in terms of manpower loss. And, it should not be considered exorbitant, at present wages, in monetary terms. For the first point, I contend that if the worker really wishes to have a third child and is not provided maternity leave, she may very well resign from her job anyway. Someone has crudely calculated the annual cost of granting two months of third-child maternity leave. The estimate of between $35 million and $45 million is possible. This is based on a statistical finding that 4,000 of the 9,000 third-child mothers are working and on the assumption that either all of them have a monthly salary of $5,000, or more than likely, 2,000 of them have a monthly salary of $5,000 and the other 2,000 have a monthly salary of $2,000. So, even if we err on the high side of the estimate, the cost to the industry in monetary terms is about $45 million. This figure is not large if we consider the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1780</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> long-term benefits derived from the increased population growth and from the satisfaction and dignity given to our working women. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>'Economic Growth' Viewpoint</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has suggested that we allow more qualified foreigners to immigrate here. Having more talented people living and working for this country will enable us to gain and maintain global competitiveness. Recently, the Minister for Home Affairs also highlighted that we have a birth rate which is too low even to replace ourselves, let alone increase our population. He also said that \" . since Singapore cannot produce enough people to come into the workforce each year, we need foreigners to sustain economic growth .\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, all this means that we do need more people. But, significantly, it was also suggested that we do need more people at all levels, including those in the low-skilled and semi-skilled categories. This being the case, I think it matters not any more who provides us with the increased numbers of people. But I would think that a Singaporean, with commitment towards his country, will be a better option than a newly arrived foreigner. And I would like to think that any of our women would be able to bear us children for these categories of workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having more talented foreigners immigrating here is not a bad thing at all. In fact, by mooting this idea, the Prime Minister has ingeniously fixed several of Singapore's potential predicaments. But the way I see it, although foreigners can contribute to the dynamism of our economy, they cannot quickly and easily duplicate the kind of ties which a locally born and bred Singaporean child brings with him into our society. These are the roots which build a nation. Without these roots, Singapore is nothing more than a temporary stopover, a little more like a hotel, a little less like a home. So, let us give all our working women more incentives to have more children. At the very least, let us give them that third child maternity leave. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1781</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, encouraging \"three or more if you can afford it\" is the way to go. But I think it is time we gave a little more help for the journey. Let us at least offer third child maternity leave. In the longer term, our nation will benefit from getting the extra citizens. And especially so when we need to prevent the unfavourable projected dependency rate of 1 in 2.2 by the year 2030. Any improvement to this figure will be very welcome indeed. The resulting increase in population will add more young men to support and to defend the country besides adding more child-bearing and working women. Sir, please consider that not only do we gain this, we also gain one further step towards graciousness in our 'best home'. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Labour (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me respond to the hon. Member for Kreta Ayer-Tanglin's motion for adjournment. As she pointed out, under the Employment Act today, a female employee is entitled to eight weeks of paid maternity leave for only her first two children. In fact, section 76(4) of the Employment Act, as it stands today, prohibits employers from granting paid maternity benefit to female employees with more than two children. Although employees holding managerial, executive and confidential positions are not covered by the Employment Act, it is common for the employers to adopt a uniform practice with respect to maternity benefits for all their employees. Hence, in practice, all female employees in Singapore generally enjoy maternity leave for eight weeks for the first two children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, first, recount the background to this provision in the Employment Act. Prior to 1973, the Employment Act allowed for paid maternity leave for up to three children. In 1973, the law was amended to limit the benefit to two children. This was in support of the prevailing policy to encourage Singaporeans to have smaller families. With smaller families, parents with limited means would be in a better position to devote more time, resources and attention to their children. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1782</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the new population policy was introduced in March 1987, the Government did consider whether paid maternity leave for the third child should be provided in the Employment Act. The policy was, \"have three or more if you can afford it\". Here, I note that Dr Lily Neo agrees with this approach to have three and more if you can afford it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new population policy was not a complete abandoning or rejection of the old population policy. Because we still emphasise that parents wanting to have a third child should have the resource to look after their children, meaning all their children. While it was imperative to get more women to marry and have more children, Government wanted to ensure that parents must be able to provide fully for their children. Children need more than just tender loving care from their parents. As the then First Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong, in announcing the new population policy, said: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We must however be mindful that bringing up a child is a heavy responsibility. The child needs to be fed and clothed. He needs a supportive home environment, adequate care and parental attention. Every baby born must be well looked after by his parents. Otherwise, he or she would be put at a disadvantage against children from better homes.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, parents who are having difficulty coping with a family of two children should not be over burdened with more children. Doing so could well impair the opportunity for the whole family to raise their standards of living. Hence, in 1987, Government concluded that it was undesirable for the Employment Act to be amended to extend maternity benefits to the third child. Providing paid maternity leave for the third child in the Employment Act could send a wrong signal and encourage those who cannot afford to have more children to do so. This will undo the good of the new population policy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo asked whether by doing so we have denied women the basic right not to be able to claim maternity leave. I think what she meant is not to be able to claim paid maternity leave, because under the law, women are not entitled to claim for paid maternity leave, but they can always \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1783</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> take unpaid maternity leave. And this is where Government, after looking at the issue, has come out with an alternative. Because we realise that for the new population policy to work, there must be incentives to overcome the restriction imposed by this particular section of the Employment Act. Otherwise, it will be extremely difficult to persuade women, working mothers in particular, to have more children. Hence, Government decided in 1987 that it would be more appropriate to give tax incentives to achieve the objectives of procreation. Since 1987, we have introduced a series of tax incentives to encourage women to have the third and fourth child. Currently, a women who gives birth to a third or fourth child can enjoy a special rebate of $20,000 which can be used to offset against her own or her and her husband's income tax liability. Where the woman is working, she can enjoy a further tax rebate equivalent to 15% of her income, which can be offsetted against her income tax liabilities. This amount is almost equivalent to the loss of two months' salary when she takes unpaid maternity leave for the third child. Both tax rebates can be set off against the parent's tax liability up to a maximum of nine years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo pointed out that with the adjustment to the income tax regime, as a result of the introduction of GST, very few working mothers will be able to benefit. This would be true initially. When the maximum set off period was only five years, it was true that not many working mothers could benefit fully from the special tax relief and the third child tax incentive. But since 1994, the maximum set off period had been increased to nine years to cater to the reduction of income tax following the introduction of GST. In other words, income loss arising from a working mother's two months' unpaid maternity leave for a third child would be more than adequately covered by the various tax concessions. Although she is taking no-pay leave during the period of confinement, her real loss of income over a period of years as a result of taking those eight weeks' no-pay leave would be offsetted by future tax reliefs. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1784</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question today is whether the 1987 decision to lift that provision in the Employment Act, in fact, is still valid today. I think, on balance, it is still relevant to today's situation. In the light of globalisation and increasing economic competition, we must be cautious in adding to our labour cost. Whatever measures that can lead to increased cost to employers will have an impact on our competitiveness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we accept her suggestion, it would mean that the Government would be simply passing on the cost of promoting larger families to employers, by requiring them to provide paid maternity leave for the third child. Bear in mind that increasingly more and more better-educated women will be entering the workforce, and we are trying our best to persuade even more housewives to rejoin the workforce that, in fact, if we make this a requirement, then the burden on the employer will, in the years ahead, increase. I do not think this is a good solution. I think it is better that Government continues to bear the cost of providing paid maternity leave for the third child or even the fourth child by way of tax rebates to the working mother or to the family. This way, we can promote larger families for those who are best able to afford more children without adding to the cost of employers and affecting our competitiveness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should also point out that the decision not to extend paid maternity leave to the third child has not really discouraged women from remaining in the workforce. In fact, the labour force participation rate for women in the child bearing age from 25 to 44 has continued to increase over the years. Between 1970 and 1990, the participation rate for women aged 25 to 29 increased from 31% to 81%. For those from the 30 to 34 age group, the participation rate went up from 23% to 68%. Among women in the age group from 35 to 39, the increase was from 19% to 60%. And for those in the age group from 40 to 44, their participation rate rose from 18% to 57%. So you can see that over the years, the absence of a third child maternity benefit had not deterred women from rejoining the labour force. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1785</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, let me point out that the number of third child live births had also increased significantly from 5,443 in 1986 under the old population policy regime to 8,293 in 1996, an increase of 52%. As Dr Neo pointed out, maybe in recent years, the increase had not been so dramatic. We would like to see more families who can better afford it to have three or more children. But we must also accept that there are other considerations and parents are in the best position to decide. What it shows is that there has been an increase in higher order births, particularly third child. Likewise, the number of fourth child live births had increased by 71% over the same period. This trend suggests that the Government's encouragement to Singaporeans to have more children if they can afford it is working. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to point out that the policy to limit the paid maternity leave in the Employment Act for up to two children continues to be relevant and consistent with the policy to encourage procreation. By encouraging lower income families to keep their families small, they would be in a better position to provide opportunities and support for their children and to upgrade the standard of living for the whole family. We will continue to encourage working mothers who can afford it to have three or more children by way of tax incentives and tax rebates, so as not to add to the burden of employers. I believe this is a more focused and more effective means of achieving the objective of the new population policy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> rose - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Are you aware that you have no right of reply? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I have one clarification? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Strictly clarification.

My point \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1786</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> is that the promotion of larger families for the last five years has not made any impact with all these tax rebates. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> That is a right of reply. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> I just want to ask him whether he will consider other incentives now. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, as I have pointed out, in fact, there has been an increase in higher order births. We can debate whether the increase is sufficient or what else we can do to make more families have a third and fourth child. That is a separate debate. The point is that in many developed societies where there is economic progress, in fact, better educated and higher income families generally do have smaller families. We are trying to buck the trend. This is not only a peculiarity in Singapore. In many other countries where they have far better maternity benefits, you see exactly the same trend, or even a worse trend of having no children at all. I am not sure if we just go along the line that she suggests by providing more incentives, we will achieve the result that we want. If we look at the experience of many other developed countries, for instance, the Scandinavian countries, they have tremendous benefits. Are they having a lot of children? I am not sure that they are. Look at all the other developed countries. I do not think they have achieved the purpose. Let us be focused, let us be clearer about what we are trying to achieve. And by way of tax rebates, if we can achieve some changes, some shift in thinking of the parents, particularly the better educated and the higher income level, I think that is success enough for us. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Adjourned accordingly at\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Twenty-Seven Minutes to Seven o'clock pm\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   to a date to be fixed.\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1787</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT ANSWERED BY 1.30 PM</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>HIGHER CHARGES FOR AMBULANCES FOR NON-EMERGENCY CASES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. \n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the imposition of higher charges is an effective solution to curb the increasing number of calls for ambulance for non-emergency cases. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Civil Defence Force's Emergency Ambulance Service (EAS) is primarily intended to respond to life-threatening emergencies. For this reason, SCDF ambulances are well equipped and the crews are specially trained. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCDF has mounted sustained public education efforts over the years to educate the public on the proper use of the EAS. In February this year, 850,000 pamphlets and posters were distributed to households and public buildings to further reinforce this message. In April 1997, SCDF helped private ambulance companies to get together to set up a hotline service (777-0000) operated by CISCO to cater to non-emergency cases. The public is encouraged to call the 777-0000 hotline for non-emergency cases. The hotline is a 24-hour service provided by CISCO and is supported by Heng-Gref Medical Supplies and Services, Civic Ambulance Service and Econ Nursing Home Services. SCDF also continued its publicity drive on the hotline through the mass media and TCS has assisted in incorporating the appropriate educational messages in local entertainment programmes and documentaries. These programmes included \"Under One Roof\" on TCS5 and \"Comedy Night\" on TCS8. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite these efforts, the EAS has been increasingly abused for non-emergency cases. While the number of emergency calls has hovered around 40,000 per year over the last 5 years, the number of non-emergency calls has nearly doubled from the 11,000 in 1992 to 20,000 last year. As a percentage of all calls received by SCDF, the number of non-emergency calls has risen from 20% in 1992 to 32% in 1996 and to about 40% in the first 8 months of 1997. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must take decisive steps to stop this misuse of the EAS. This is because each time the EAS attends to a non-emergency call, it is less able to respond in time to a real emergency. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous charge of $50 for each non-emergency call was lower than what some private ambulance operators charge. It is therefore hardly surprising that the number of non-emergency ambulance calls has increased steadily. In any case, the new fee of $75 barely covers three-quarter of the operating cost of the EAS. We intend to further increase the charge for non-emergency calls to recover its full cost of about $100, with effect from October 1998. Many countries such as the United States, Canada and Australia already charge full cost for non-emergency users of their ambulance services so that critical resources are properly allocated. In fact, even emergency cases have to pay for the ambulance services in these countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With continued publicity on the new 777-0000 non-emergency hotline and SCDF's increased fees for non-emergency cases, the number of non-emergency calls to SCDF should be checked. In any case, we will monitor the situation closely. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1789</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PRELIMINARY SCREENING OF PATIENTS BY 24-HOUR MEDICAL SERVICES</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CENTRE IN PUBLIC HOSPITALS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. \n  <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Health whether he will request public hospitals to consider the establishment of a 24-hour Medical Services Centre to do preliminary screening of patients before directing them to either the Accident and Emergency Departments (A&amp;E) or to other non A&amp;E doctors. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the A&amp;E departments already conduct preliminary screening, or triage, to determine if a patient is a true emergency case.

The first tier is the domestic banking sector in which the currency of transaction is the Singapore dollar. The second tier is the offshore banking sector which transacts in foreign currencies, principally the US dollar, Japanese Yen and the Deutsche Mark. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial system in Singapore is governed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore Act, the Banking Act, the Securities Industry Act, the Futures Trading Act, Finance Companies Act, Insurance Companies Act and subsidiary legislation. The MAS issues regulations setting out operational requirements and prudential standards for all financial institutions. The MAS also regulates the international usage of the Singapore dollar. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present time, 34 banks hold full licences to operate in the domestic banking sector, comprising 12 Singapore controlled banks and 22 foreign bank branches. In addition, there are 13 restricted and 107 offshore licensed foreign bank branches in Singapore which are able to undertake wholesale Singapore dollar business. Singapore practises universal banking, whereby banks are able to transact in all aspects of financial services, including commercial banking, securities/futures trading, insurance and other ancillary activities. Because the domestic banking sector is already over-banked, no new full and restricted banking licences have been issued, whether to local or foreign entities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offshore banking sector is still open and new foreign financial institutions which meet MAS standards will continue to be admitted. Entry is generally based on an assessment of the adequacy of home supervision, and the quality of the parent banks' international reputation and capital and asset status. MAS actively promotes this sector to enhance the status of Singapore as an international financial centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, Singapore has come under increasing pressure to further liberalise and open up the domestic financial sector to foreign participation. A WTO agreement on the liberalisation of financial services is under active discussion and there is pressure to complete the negotiations by December this year. Furthermore, globalization and IT are sweeping the financial industry worldwide, causing radical changes, including mergers, new products, and new risks. Our approach to supervising and promoting the financial \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1795</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> sector, both offshore and domestic, must take these worldwide trends into account. It is against this background that the Government has set up the Competitiveness Committee and the Financial Services Review Group. This is an exercise to build on our strengths, identify new approaches and develop promising new areas to ensure we remain competitive as a financial centre. The Committees are expected to issue their preliminary reports towards the end of this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our financial sector has considerable strengths - high standards of regulation and supervision, sound banks and financial institutions, a transparent, open environment giving all participants maximum protection against fraud and sharp practice. Any policy changes will build upon these strengths, while making the sector more productive and competitive. This will translate into stronger growth and increased profitability. It will also generate greater demand for legal, accountancy and other ancillary services.
