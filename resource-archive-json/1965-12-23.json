Members   will  recollect  that   on   11th\r\n\r\nDecember,  1963, I made a statement in  this  House\r\n\r\nconcerning  the  setting  up  of  a  Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry to inquire into the mismanagement of  union\r\n\r\nfunds  by  the  pro-Communist leaders  of  the \r\n\r\nde-registered unions. I mentioned then that while  \r\n\r\nde-registration proceedings were pending against them,\r\n\r\nthe  leaders  of  these three  unions  were  making\r\n\r\ndesperate  plans to withdraw large  sums  of  money\r\n\r\nfrom  the  unions'  bank accounts  to  finance  the\r\n\r\nCommunist united front campaign against merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  I also recounted to the House how  these\r\n\r\nunions  took  advantage of loopholes in  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  laws  to  sabotage  measures  taken  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  protect trade union  funds  in  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the workers. With the assistance  of\r\n\r\ntheir legal adviser, Mr T. T Rajah, they contrived\r\n\r\nand succeeded in withdrawing $30,000 from banks  in\r\n\r\nthe second week of October 1963. When the Registrar\r\n\r\nof Trade Unions tried to ascertain whether this sum\r\n\r\nof money was properly and legally utilised, the \r\n\r\npro-communist union leaders deliberately obstructed his\r\n\r\ninquiry.  Even police investigations were  hampered\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the sudden disappearance of  the  then\r\n\r\nGeneral-Secretary   of   the   Singapore    General\r\n\r\nEmployees' Union. These incidents caused concern to\r\n\r\nthe public in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\ngeneral  and  the workers in particular.  Naturally\r\n\r\nthey  had  good  reasons to be disturbed.  The  \r\n\r\nso-called  leaders  of the pro-Communist  unions  have\r\n\r\nbeen  claiming all these years that they  were  the\r\n\r\ngenuine  champions of the workers and had dedicated\r\n\r\ntheir  lives  to  the  cause  of  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement.  But  what some of the  workers  did  not\r\n\r\nknow,  because  they were really misled,  was  that\r\n\r\nthese bogus leaders were dedicated only to the \r\n\r\nanti-national  cause  of their political  masters.  They\r\n\r\nwere   not  really  interested  in  promoting   the\r\n\r\nindustrial  interest of the workers but  just  made\r\n\r\nuse  of  the workers as political pawns to  achieve\r\n\r\ntheir anti-national objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public and the workers have a right to know\r\n\r\nthe  actual  state  of financial affairs  in  these\r\n\r\nunions.  It is the duty of the Government  to  keep\r\n\r\nour  citizens informed of the true facts concerning\r\n\r\nany matters of public interest. It was against this\r\n\r\nbackground that a one-man Commission of Inquiry was\r\n\r\nset  up  under the Inquiry Commission Ordinance  by\r\n\r\nHis  Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara on  21st\r\n\r\nDecember, 1963. Mr Tan Wee Kian, an officer of the\r\n\r\nLegal Service, was appointed the Commissioner.  The\r\n\r\nCommissioner  has now completed his work.  In  all,\r\n\r\nthere  were  38  sittings of  the  Commission.  116\r\n\r\nwitnesses were examined, and 324 exhibits submitted\r\n\r\nto the Commission. The report of the Commission was\r\n\r\nsubmitted by the Commissioner to His Excellency  on\r\n\r\n31st  July,  1965. I now present  a  copy  of  this\r\n\r\nReport for the information of Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the Commission reveals a shocking\r\n\r\nstate  of  affairs  in  these  three  de-registered\r\n\r\nunions. Their officials have been found wanting and\r\n\r\nhave not discharged the responsibilities imposed on\r\n\r\nthem  by  union  rules.  This  group  of  political\r\n\r\nactivists  in the disguise of trade unionists  were\r\n\r\nfound to have displayed a flagrant disregard of the\r\n\r\nstatutory provisions governing the custody of trade\r\n\r\nunion  funds. The unions' system of accounting  was\r\n\r\nsuch  that it provided ample opportunities for  the\r\n\r\nmanipulation  of financial transactions.  Even  the\r\n\r\nunions' legal adviser, the self-styled spokesman of\r\n\r\nthe workers, Mr T. T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRajah,   was   found  to  be   a   party   to   the\r\n\r\nirregularities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Report, in the transaction for\r\n\r\nthe purchase of new union premises by the Singapore\r\n\r\nBus  Workers' Union, Mr T. T. Rajah, who acted for\r\n\r\nthe   vendors   and   the   purchasers,   undertook\r\n\r\nconveyance of the property to three union officials\r\n\r\nwho  were not trustees, although the rules  of  the\r\n\r\nunions  specifically provided for  all  properties,\r\n\r\nmovable  and immovable, to be vested in  the  union\r\n\r\ntrustees. In addition to the disappearance  of  the\r\n\r\nunion  officials,  minutes  and  documents  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Business  Houses Employees'  Union,  the\r\n\r\nwhole  Set of account books was also found missing,\r\n\r\nand  deliberate attempts were made to frustrate the\r\n\r\nCommission's   investigation  and  to   cover   the\r\n\r\nmalpractices  of certain officials. The  Commission\r\n\r\nalso  found that huge sums of union funds had  been\r\n\r\ndissipated illegally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The findings of the Commission in this respect,\r\n\r\nas summarised in its Report, are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That in the case of the Singapore General Employees' Union -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Payments totalling $24,467 were\r\n\r\nunauthorised by the rules of the  unions  or\r\n\r\ncontrary  to  the provisions  of  the  Trade Unions Ordinance;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) $29,847.95 were incurred negligently\r\n\r\nby  the  Executive Committee of  the  Union;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) $153,564.32 had not been accounted for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That in the case of the Singapore Business Houses Employees' Union -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Payments totalling $13,550 were\r\n\r\nunauthorised by the rules of the  unions  or\r\n\r\ncontrary  to  the provisions  of  the  Trade Unions Ordinance;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Mr Foo Yong Fong, Mr P. Govindaswamy\r\n\r\nand Mr Tan Siew Chwee were found guilty  of\r\n\r\ngross  negligence in dissipating  a  sum  of $26,901.30 contrary to the union rules; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) $35,654 had not been accounted for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That in the case of the Singapore Bus Workers' Union -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Payments totalling $55,030.80 were\r\n\r\nunauthorised by the rules\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  union or contrary to the provisions\r\n\r\nof the Trade Unions Ordinance;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) $2,535.20 was incurred negligently;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) $12,523.69 had not been accounted for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the above, you will see that a total amount of\r\n\r\n$354,074.26   was  either  unauthorised,   incurred\r\n\r\nnegligently or had not been accounted for by  these\r\n\r\nthree unions over a period from 1st April, 1962, to\r\n\r\n30th  October,  1963. How much more  was  taken  or\r\n\r\nmisused  by  them nobody will know. This represents\r\n\r\nthe  largest  amount of money the  Communist  union\r\n\r\nleaders had abstracted from the workers as  far  as\r\n\r\nrecords are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not the first time that the\r\n\r\npro-Communist  union leaders are found to have  misused\r\n\r\ntrade union funds. Such things happened eight years\r\n\r\nago.   Just  before  the  de-registration  of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Factory  and  Shop  Workers'  Union  in\r\n\r\nFebruary    1957,   a   sum   of    $100,000    was\r\n\r\nunconstitutionally withdrawn from its bank  account\r\n\r\nand  the money just vanished into thin air. Members\r\n\r\nwill  recall  that  on previous  occasions  when  I\r\n\r\nmentioned  in this House how the bogus  leaders  of\r\n\r\nthe pro-Communist unions illegally dissipated funds\r\n\r\nof  the workers for purposes inconsistent with  the\r\n\r\nobjects and rules of the unions to the detriment of\r\n\r\nthe  unions and danger to the State, Members across\r\n\r\nthe House, for obvious reasons, jumped up to defend\r\n\r\ntheir  character and integrity and  accused  us  of\r\n\r\nsmearing them. Members will also recall that in the\r\n\r\npast,  when  the Government introduced  legislative\r\n\r\nmeasures to investigate trade union funds, we  were\r\n\r\naccused  by  Members across the House  of  adopting\r\n\r\nFascist  and  dictatorial methods to  suppress  the\r\n\r\nunions associated with them. When they receive  the\r\n\r\nReport  of  the  Commission, they may  read  it  in\r\n\r\nsilence or play the same old tune. But one thing is\r\n\r\ncertain,  and  that  is that  no  amount  of  false\r\n\r\naccusations  from Members across the Floor  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  and their friends will be able to alter  the\r\n\r\nfacts and figures contained in the findings of  the\r\n\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy of Report submitted to Clerk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.44 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>COMMUNITY CENTRE IN</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NEW MACPHERSON</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HOUSING ESTATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr S.

There are\r\n\r\nalready  in the Aljunied Constituency one  standard\r\n\r\ntype  and  one  rural  type community  centres.  In\r\n\r\nnearby  Paya Lebar there are one standard type  and\r\n\r\nfive rural type community centres. If the residents\r\n\r\nof  the  MacPherson Housing Estate urgently want  a\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre,  they should club  together  and\r\n\r\nrent  suitable premises from the Housing Board  for\r\n\r\nthis  purpose.  Now  that  we  are  an  independent\r\n\r\nnation, social initiatives of this kind are  to  be\r\n\r\nencouraged. The attitude of expecting Government to\r\n\r\nbe  the  universal provider is much to be deplored.\r\n\r\nIt is a legacy of our colonial past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My suggestion to the residents of MacPherson\r\n\r\nHousing  Estate is far from fanciful.  In  fact,  a\r\n\r\ncommunity  initiative of this kind  took  place  in\r\n\r\nTanah  Merah  Kechil, Changi, where  the  residents\r\n\r\nclubbed  together,  built a community  centre,  and\r\n\r\ndonated   it  to  the  People's  Association.   The\r\n\r\nresidents  of Changi are a sturdy breed.  When  the\r\n\r\nsea  curfew  imposed hardships on their  fishermen,\r\n\r\nthey  did  not sit on their haunches and  wait  for\r\n\r\ndole-outs  by  the Social Welfare Department.  They\r\n\r\norganised  a whip-round, bought food and provisions\r\n\r\nand  gave  these to the families of the  fishermen.\r\n\r\nTheir scale of donations is much more generous than\r\n\r\nthe  Government  ration scale. It is  sturdy  \r\n\r\nself-reliance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof this kind that I commend to the residents of\r\n\r\nAljunied, who surely cannot be in any respect less\r\n\r\nworthy than those of Changi.\r\n\r\n                 \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BILL INTRODUCED</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TRADE UNIONS (AMENDMENT)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Trade Unions Ordinance (Chapter 154 of the Revised Edition)\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>presented by the Minister for Labour (Mr Jek  Yeun Thong);  read the First time, to be read  a  Second\r\n\r\nTime  on  the  first  available sitting  day  after\r\n\r\nWednesday, 5th January, 1966, and to be printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DEBATE ON ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question\r\n\r\n[13th  December, 1965], \"That the Assembly approves\r\n\r\nthe financial policy of the Government for the year\r\n\r\n1966.\".-[The Minister for Finance].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.48 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

There\r\n\r\nare   inherent  difficulties  facing  any   Finance\r\n\r\nMinister in budgetting for this small island State.\r\n\r\nWe are a small nation with a population of some two\r\n\r\nmillion and we have no natural resources. We have a\r\n\r\nbig  neighbour with whom, in so many ways,  we  are\r\n\r\nstill closely linked. For example, we share\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  common currency. Because of this close link, any\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  will  have  to  look  over   his\r\n\r\nshoulder to see that any of his proposals will  not\r\n\r\ninvite  retaliation from across  the  Causeway,  or\r\n\r\nthat  any  proposal  will not  be  defeated  simply\r\n\r\nbecause  our  neighbour is there. Let  me  give  an\r\n\r\nexample to illustrate my point. The income  tax  on\r\n\r\ncompanies is 40 per cent in Singapore. It  is  also\r\n\r\n40  per cent in the Federation. Should we decide to\r\n\r\nraise the tax on companies to, say, 50 per cent, we\r\n\r\nhave  to make sure that the Federation do likewise.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  companies  will  move  to  Johore   and\r\n\r\nconduct  their  business from across the  Causeway.\r\n\r\nThis  little  example goes to show the difficulties\r\n\r\nour  Finance Minister faces in formulating economic\r\n\r\npolicies for Singapore. It further goes to show how\r\n\r\nunnatural  it is that Singapore and the  Federation\r\n\r\nshould  be  two  economic entities instead  of  one\r\n\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be that as it may, we are now independent and\r\n\r\nsovereign.  We have to manage our own affairs.  The\r\n\r\nproblems after independence are not quite the  same\r\n\r\nas  those before independence. We must find ways of\r\n\r\nmeeting  these  problems. We must  respond  to  the\r\n\r\nchallenge.  Even before Singapore joined  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nSingapore    embarked    on    a    programme    of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation as the traditional entrepot trade\r\n\r\nwas  found to be insufficient and unable to  create\r\n\r\nenough  job  opportunities  for  our  fast  growing\r\n\r\nworking   population.  After   Malaysia,   however,\r\n\r\nindustrialisation    proceeded    on    the     not\r\n\r\nunjustifiable basis that there would  be  a  Common\r\n\r\nMarket.  With  the  separation  of  Singapore  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  the prospects of a Common Market  become\r\n\r\nremote.  Singapore by herself, however,  forms  too\r\n\r\nsmall  a  market  to  support an  industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme.  In order to industrialise  effectively,\r\n\r\nan  alternative to the Common Market must be found;\r\n\r\nin other words, we must find alternative markets to\r\n\r\nabsorb  the  goods that our factories are  able  to\r\n\r\nproduce.  Unless  these  markets  are  found,   our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme will come to grief  and\r\n\r\nwe will face more than an unemployment problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is gratifying to note, therefore, that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  doing its utmost to  find  overseas\r\n\r\nexport  markets  for our industrial  goods.  It  is\r\n\r\ndoing so on the official level by direct approaches\r\n\r\nto  foreign  governments. It  is  also  encouraging\r\n\r\nprivate enterprises to look for overseas markets by\r\n\r\nproviding suitable incentives like double deduction\r\n\r\nfor  tax  purposes for market development  overseas\r\n\r\nand  for increased allowance for advertising. There\r\n\r\nis the further provision for an accelerated rate of\r\n\r\ndepreciation for tax purposes for export-orientated\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures proposed by the Finance Minister\r\n\r\nmay be powerful incentives in normal times. We are,\r\n\r\nhowever, living in times that are not quite normal.\r\n\r\nOur  industries are not long established.  Most  of\r\n\r\nthem have just started production. Most of them too\r\n\r\nare  pioneer  industries. Pioneer industries  enjoy\r\n\r\nspecial privileges, the most important of which  is\r\n\r\nexemption from income tax for five years.  Most  of\r\n\r\nthe  new  industries, therefore,  would  enjoy  tax\r\n\r\nexemption  for an initial period of five years  and\r\n\r\nthe  double  deduction in respect of  expenses  for\r\n\r\noverseas  market  development does not,  therefore,\r\n\r\nbenefit these pioneer industries. The same argument\r\n\r\napplies  to  accelerated depreciation, although  in\r\n\r\nthis  case  it  is  possible for  manufacturers  to\r\n\r\npostpone  depreciation until after the  first  five\r\n\r\nyears,  i.e.,  after the period in which  they  are\r\n\r\nexempted from income tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also well known that taxation is not a\r\n\r\ndisincentive for capitalists. The reason is that as\r\n\r\nlong  as there is money to be made, capitalists  do\r\n\r\nnot  mind paying taxes. What they worry most is the\r\n\r\nprospect  of  losing money. Exporting  to  overseas\r\n\r\nmarkets  is  a  new  experience  to  many  of   our\r\n\r\nindustrialists. It is something of an adventure  to\r\n\r\nthem.  To  sell our goods abroad, we must give  the\r\n\r\nforeign  buyers  some sort of  inducement.  We  can\r\n\r\nhardly  expect  them  to buy for  cash.  We  would,\r\n\r\ntherefore, have to sell on credit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a great help, of course, if the\r\n\r\nGovernment   could  finance  this   export   trade,\r\n\r\nespecially  for the small manufacturers.  But  this\r\n\r\nwould   throw   an  unbearable  burden   upon   the\r\n\r\nexchequer.  Financing the export trade  is  a  more\r\n\r\nrisky business than financing internal trade.  This\r\n\r\nis  especially  so when we have to break  into  new\r\n\r\nmarkets overseas. So even if private industries can\r\n\r\nfind the money to finance their exports, they would\r\n\r\nbe  slow  to  do so unless there is  some  sort  of\r\n\r\nguarantee that their capital will not be lost.  And\r\n\r\nhere  is  where the Government can help. I have  in\r\n\r\nmind,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, some kind  of  an  export\r\n\r\nguarantee  agency. This is some kind  of  insurance\r\n\r\nagainst  default of payment by overseas buyers.  At\r\n\r\npresent, manufacturers, especially the smaller ones\r\n\r\nwith a modest capital, are reluctant to export even\r\n\r\nif  they  could do so for fear that they  may  lose\r\n\r\ntheir  capital.  With  this fear  removed,  we  can\r\n\r\nexpect  to  see  a  greater drive  in  industry  to\r\n\r\nexport.  Many  industrialised nations  to  whom  an\r\n\r\nexport   market  is  important  have  this   export\r\n\r\nguarantee system. Japan and the United Kingdom  are\r\n\r\ntwo  of  the countries that come to mind. I confess\r\n\r\nthat I have not made a study of any existing system\r\n\r\nand cannot, therefore, recommend how this system in\r\n\r\nour  country  should be set up. This task  I  shall\r\n\r\nleave to the experts in this field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish, however, to anticipate one criticism that\r\n\r\nis invariably levelled against any export guarantee\r\n\r\nsystem, i.e., that it invites reckless exporting by\r\n\r\nmanufacturers resulting in a loss to the  exchequer\r\n\r\nthough  not  to the manufacturers themselves.  This\r\n\r\nmay be true in uncontrolled 100 per cent guarantee.\r\n\r\nBut   this   defect  can  easily  be  overcome   by\r\n\r\nguaranteeing  not the full amount of  the  exports,\r\n\r\nbut,   say,   50   per  cent.   This   will   leave\r\n\r\nmanufacturers to bear a proportion of the loss  and\r\n\r\nwill  induce  them  to exercise  caution.  Further,\r\n\r\nexports  can  be controlled by commodity  selection\r\n\r\nfor  export and quality control grading  of  export\r\n\r\nmarkets according to their risk, etc. But these are\r\n\r\ndetails which, as I have said, I shall leave to the\r\n\r\nexperts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also envisage this agency working hand in glove\r\n\r\nwith our overseas trade\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmissions  which will advertise our products  abroad\r\n\r\nand  provide us with accurate information about the\r\n\r\nconditions and needs of our overseas markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, finding overseas markets to\r\n\r\nsupport our industries has become an urgent task in\r\n\r\nour  exercise for survival. I believe this proposal\r\n\r\nof  mine can help, in however small a way, in  this\r\n\r\nurgent task and I humbly beg to put it forward  for\r\n\r\nthe consideration of hon. Members of this House.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I believe there is not a\r\n\r\nsingle  Singapore citizen, whether from the working\r\n\r\nclass  or from the capitalist class, who is  uneasy\r\n\r\nafter  the Finance Minister delivered his financial\r\n\r\nspeech on the 13th December last. Usually after the\r\n\r\npolicy  speech by the Minister for Finance,  people\r\n\r\nwill  be  uneasy because of increased  taxes.  This\r\n\r\ntime,  not only are they very pleased because there\r\n\r\nhas  been  no increase in taxes for the forthcoming\r\n\r\nyear,  but  the  taxes which were  imposed  by  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Government when Singapore  was  part  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia have now been removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, Mr Speaker, a point which further\r\n\r\npleases  the people of Singapore is that there  are\r\n\r\nmany  other  guarantees given by the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance,  like  the  setting up of  more  factories\r\n\r\nwhich  will  give more employment opportunities  to\r\n\r\nthe   people,   and   the  resumption   of   trade,\r\n\r\nparticularly   with  Malaysia.  This   will   bring\r\n\r\nprosperity to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one thing about which the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore feel uneasy, and that is the attitude  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance in connection with  \r\n\r\nback-pay.  When  he replied to a question by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Telok Blangah on this matter, he reiterated his\r\n\r\npositive  stand relating to back-pay. There  is  no\r\n\r\nchange  on  that. The emphasis by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  can be equated to his giving a  weapon  to\r\n\r\nthe  employers  to  kill  militant  national  trade\r\n\r\nunions  by dilly-dallying over negotiations between\r\n\r\nthe management and the trade unions. The Government\r\n\r\nwill  also  employ  this tactic to  avoid  reaching\r\n\r\nagreement between\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers and management. For instance, when a  union\r\n\r\nputs  up wage claims for better working conditions,\r\n\r\nthe  employer can deliberately dilly-dally over the\r\n\r\nmatter.  Or  the  management will  first  ascertain\r\n\r\nwhether there is a claim for back-pay. When it  can\r\n\r\nuse  this  weapon  provided  by  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance,   then   it   will   deliberately    delay\r\n\r\nnegotiations.  Ultimately, union  members  who  are\r\n\r\nstrongly  united  and support the union  will  lose\r\n\r\nfaith  in  the union, resulting in the union  going\r\n\r\ndefunct  and  this  is  the opportunity  which  the\r\n\r\nmanagement has long been waiting for. But I do  not\r\n\r\nknow  whether the Minister for Finance  adopts  the\r\n\r\nsame attitude as the management towards the unions.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  unions  can  no  longer  represent   the\r\n\r\nworkers, the management will adopt policies at  its\r\n\r\nown  whims and fancies and this will result in  the\r\n\r\nworkers being oppressed by the management.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  soon after our Finance Minister delivered\r\n\r\nhis  first  Budget speech in the first  independent\r\n\r\nParliament of Singapore, he was received with great\r\n\r\napplause  among the people of the various races  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. All these people are of the opinion that\r\n\r\nthis   is   a  great  assurance  for  the  economic\r\n\r\nstability  in  Singapore. This is because  in  this\r\n\r\nBudget  speech,  we  have been  able  to  show  our\r\n\r\neconomic  achievements which represent our national\r\n\r\nspirit  and  which augurs well for a bright  future\r\n\r\nfor  our nation. And this again is a New Year  gift\r\n\r\nfor  our people with the festive season just around\r\n\r\nthe corner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a representative of the people, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nI,  on  behalf  of my constituents, would  like  to\r\n\r\nthank the Finance Minister for his Budget speech. I\r\n\r\nexpress  my  confidence in  and  support  for  this\r\n\r\nBudget  speech in which our stability and  progress\r\n\r\nare assured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, looking at the Budget speech as a\r\n\r\nwhole, we can see various salient features. I think\r\n\r\nit is necessary for me to point out these features.\r\n\r\nFirstly, in this budget we can see that the sum  of\r\n\r\nsome  $537 million will be collected from  revenue.\r\n\r\nAgainst  this we will be spending a total  of  $505\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the balance is that we will have a surplus of\r\n\r\nsome $30 million. This is the first point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that, because of our economic\r\n\r\nresilience  and viability, we have  not  only  been\r\n\r\nable   to  recover  our  losses  as  a  result   of\r\n\r\nIndonesian  confrontation, but we  have  also  been\r\n\r\nable to increase our national income by at least  2\r\n\r\nper  cent in the past one year. This is the  second\r\n\r\nsalient feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that, as a result of\r\n\r\nSingapore's   independence,  certain  retrogressive\r\n\r\ntaxes  have been repealed. These taxes were imposed\r\n\r\nby  the  Malaysian Central Government.  Instead  of\r\n\r\nthese retrogressive measures, we have replaced them\r\n\r\nwith some new measures which provide protection for\r\n\r\nour  economic prosperity. From all this, we can see\r\n\r\nthat with efficient and progressive new methods our\r\n\r\neconomic future is well protected, and this will in\r\n\r\nturn  bring about a reorganisation in the whole  of\r\n\r\nour social order and improvement therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, this Budget speech goes a step\r\n\r\nfurther  to  show that our non-Communist democratic\r\n\r\nsocialist Government is a well-organised and highly\r\n\r\nefficient  piece of machinery. With its  consistent\r\n\r\npolicy   and  long-term  objectives,  it  is   able\r\n\r\neffectively to lead the people of our island  State\r\n\r\nof  224  square miles towards a well-organised  and\r\n\r\nbetter society, in which the standard of living  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  will  be enhanced  and  improved  with\r\n\r\neconomic  independence, which will  bring  about  a\r\n\r\nmore just, equal and prosperous nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are altogether the salient features that\r\n\r\none  will  see in the Budget speech. What  is  more\r\n\r\nimportant  is  that, Mr Speaker, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nstress  at this juncture that the contents of  this\r\n\r\nBudget  speech  show that those theorists  who  are\r\n\r\npolitically  shortsighted are wrong in  their  view\r\n\r\nthat  they can stifle Singapore's independence with\r\n\r\neconomic  measures. They also show themselves  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  very stupid in believing that  they  can\r\n\r\nstifle our economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to give some facts and\r\n\r\nfigures  to  prove my point. This will, of  course,\r\n\r\ngive you a better picture of the Budget speech. The\r\n\r\naverage  national income per capita of the  working\r\n\r\nclass  in Singapore is as high as $1,300, which  is\r\n\r\nthe  highest  in  the whole of Asia.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\ncompared  with  Malaysia, which is  only  $800  per\r\n\r\ncapita income, Sabah - $700 per capita income,  and\r\n\r\nSarawak  -$550 per capita income, we are  also  the\r\n\r\nhighest  in  this region. The main sources  of  our\r\n\r\nnational  income come from these different  fields:\r\n\r\nCommerce and Trade, 23 per cent; Industry,  18  per\r\n\r\ncent;  Government  services,  18  per  cent;  Armed\r\n\r\nForces,  14  per cent; Agriculture,  18  per  cent;\r\n\r\nBuilding Construction, 5 per cent; Tourism,  3  per\r\n\r\ncent;  and  Others,  15  per cent.  The  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities for our people come mainly  from  our\r\n\r\ncommerce,  transportation and other services  which\r\n\r\nprovide employment to 70 per cent of our people. In\r\n\r\nthe field of industry and building construction, 20\r\n\r\nper  cent  are  employed. Agriculture provides  for\r\n\r\nsome 8 per cent of our employed, and others, 2  per\r\n\r\ncent.  From all these figures, we can see that  the\r\n\r\neconomic policies of our Government are correct and\r\n\r\non  the  right track. This is because, on  the  one\r\n\r\nhand,  we  can  maintain  our  traditional  trading\r\n\r\ncentre and, on the other hand, we can go ahead with\r\n\r\nour industrial development programme. These figures\r\n\r\nalso show that Singapore's commerce occupies a very\r\n\r\nimportant  point in our economic structure.  It  is\r\n\r\nerroneous  to  say  that it is  only  in  times  of\r\n\r\nprosperity that the Government is able to go  ahead\r\n\r\nwith  its  economic  programmes.  This  is  a  very\r\n\r\nbackward  view  which is not  shown  in  our  first\r\n\r\nBudget speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to have learned\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister for Finance that for the  first\r\n\r\ntime the Government is intending to consolidate and\r\n\r\nimprove upon our infrastructure with great sums  of\r\n\r\nmoney, such infrastructure being necessary for  our\r\n\r\nfurther   improvement  in  social   amenities   and\r\n\r\neconomic growth. All this will, of course, give our\r\n\r\npeople a better standard of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nliving.  I  understand that it is the intention  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government to spend some $976 million  in  the\r\n\r\nnext  five  years,  which is 60  per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\nestimate  for the purposes of economic development.\r\n\r\nOf this figure, a sum of $486 million will be spent\r\n\r\non social development programmes, and these are all\r\n\r\nvery good for our people, because this sum takes up\r\n\r\nabout  32  per  cent  of  the  estimate  for   this\r\n\r\nparticular Five-Year Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, with regard to social development, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to mention in particular the  programme\r\n\r\nin  housing. Our housing achievements have not only\r\n\r\nwon  praise locally, but they have also boosted our\r\n\r\ninternational  repute. This very well  proves  that\r\n\r\nour  country is going on the right track  and  that\r\n\r\nour  Government has the determination and verve  to\r\n\r\nface  all  types of difficulties and challenges  in\r\n\r\norder to find a way out for our people through  all\r\n\r\nthese economic challenges and difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the reasons for saying so are very\r\n\r\nsimple  and clear. You will remember that  when  we\r\n\r\nfirst came to power in 1959, many, many people were\r\n\r\nwithout decent housing and even experts were of the\r\n\r\nopinion  that our housing problem was difficult  to\r\n\r\nsolve,  because  at that time there  was  an  acute\r\n\r\nshortage   of  houses  in  Singapore  and  whatever\r\n\r\nprogramme for housing development we had, it  would\r\n\r\nnot  be possible to catch up with the growth of our\r\n\r\npopulation. But the facts before us today show that\r\n\r\nall  those fears were actually unfounded  and  that\r\n\r\nthe  housing programme of the Government  has  been\r\n\r\nvery successful all along.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you can see that many, many question\r\n\r\nmarks  have turned into a lot of exclamation  marks\r\n\r\nin  praise of our achievements. Now we have come to\r\n\r\na  stage where we are able to build one unit in  45\r\n\r\nminutes. All this goes to show the overall  success\r\n\r\nof the housing programme of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you can see how successful we are. A\r\n\r\ndevelopment  officer of E.C.A.F.E. said  that  the\r\n\r\nhousing  programme  in Singapore  provided  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in respect of low-cost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhousing   has   been  shockingly  and  surprisingly\r\n\r\nsuccessful  and  that  this  was  a  very   massive\r\n\r\nprogramme  - in fact, the greatest of its  kind  in\r\n\r\nthe whole of Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, our success can be seen in the new\r\n\r\nhousing  estate  now in Bukit  Ho  Swee  which  was\r\n\r\ndevastated  by  a big fire in 1961 in  which  about\r\n\r\n16,000   people   were   rendered   homeless.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  then  took up the  challenge  to  build\r\n\r\nhouses for these people. On 1st February, 1960, the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board  was set up and  it  took  over  our\r\n\r\nhousing   development  project  from   the   former\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let us take note that the people of\r\n\r\nBukit  Ho Swee have been lucky in that in  a  short\r\n\r\ntime they are able to enjoy decent housing provided\r\n\r\nby  our Government. Against this background, let us\r\n\r\ntake  a look at the history of the former Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust. In its 32 years of existence, it\r\n\r\nwas  only able to put up 21,689 units of houses and\r\n\r\nshophouses. This shows that the former Lim Yew Hock\r\n\r\nand   the   colonial  governments  were  not   only\r\n\r\ninefficient  but  also  incompetent.  Against  this\r\n\r\nhistorical background, we will take a look  at  our\r\n\r\nachievements.  We  have  been  able   to   put   up\r\n\r\naltogether about 52,206 units of houses since 1959.\r\n\r\nThis  figure  includes flats as well as shophouses.\r\n\r\nThe  break-up  is  as follows: in 1961,  altogether\r\n\r\n7,320  units of low-cost houses were built for  our\r\n\r\npeople; in 1962, we built 12,230 units; in 1963, we\r\n\r\nbuilt  10,085 units; in 1964, we built about 13,280\r\n\r\nunits. Since the Government came to power, we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to put up a lot of flats and blocks  of\r\n\r\nhouses  in various areas in Singapore, particularly\r\n\r\nin  Queenstown,  Bukit  Ho  Swee,  MacPherson,  St.\r\n\r\nMichael's,  Alexandra, Jurong new town,  Kim  Keat,\r\n\r\nGeylang  Serai, Toa Payoh, Kallang,  Selegie  Road,\r\n\r\nOnan Road, Toa Payoh South, etc. In these areas, we\r\n\r\nhave  been  able to put up altogether about  44,345\r\n\r\nunits  of  houses in order to enable our people  to\r\n\r\nlive   in  housing  estates.  The  Government  also\r\n\r\nprovides  them with housing subsidies. The  figures\r\n\r\nare  as follows: in 1960, the subsidy provided  was\r\n\r\n$2.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion;  in  1961, the provision was $2.1  million\r\n\r\nalso; in 1962, it was $4.2 million; in 1963, it was\r\n\r\nS6.5 million; in 1964, it was $9.5 million and  for\r\n\r\n1965  it  will  be $9.7 million. All these  figures\r\n\r\nshow the amount of housing subsidy provided by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  the people. So the Government  has\r\n\r\nnot  only  solved  the  acute  problem  of  housing\r\n\r\nshortage  but  has also provided  the  people  with\r\n\r\nsocial  amenities in the housing estates,  such  as\r\n\r\nschools, clinics, playgrounds, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, from all these facts and figures, we\r\n\r\ncan  see that the Government has done and is  doing\r\n\r\nall  it  can to improve the standard of living  and\r\n\r\nthe environments of our people. But in spite of the\r\n\r\nefforts of the Government to do good things for the\r\n\r\npeople,  the  Barisan Sosialis and the other  \r\n\r\nanti-national   elements   are   trying   to   be   very\r\n\r\nobstructive,   particularly  in   cases   of   land\r\n\r\nacquisition.  They try to whip up the  feelings  of\r\n\r\nthe   people  against  the  Government  and  create\r\n\r\ntrouble for their own political ends, because  they\r\n\r\ndo   not   want  us  to  carry  out  our  work   of\r\n\r\nconstruction and nation-building. They know that if\r\n\r\nwe  are  successful, it will be very difficult  for\r\n\r\nthem  in their political struggle to achieve  their\r\n\r\nown  selfish  ends.  They  are  not  loyal  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry. They are traitors to our people. They  are\r\n\r\nloyal  only to the political leaders of  a  country\r\n\r\noutside   Singapore.  We  can  see  through   their\r\n\r\ntreacherous  intrigues and plots. They  claim  that\r\n\r\nthey  should  inculcate the theories and  political\r\n\r\nideology  of  Mao Tse-tung into the  minds  of  our\r\n\r\nyoung  people. I would like to tell them  that  our\r\n\r\npeople   are   not   interested  in   any   foreign\r\n\r\nindoctrination   of  any  kind,  because   it   has\r\n\r\npractically  nothing to do with the improvement  of\r\n\r\nthe  lot of our people. Our people want to  see  an\r\n\r\nactual improvement in their livelihood. Because  of\r\n\r\nthis, the Barisan Sosialis have not been able  even\r\n\r\nto hold on to their own political strongholds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, our main task ahead now is survival.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to tell you what the Government  has\r\n\r\ndone in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvarious  fields, such as industry and  agriculture.\r\n\r\nFrom  these  figures we will be  able  to  see  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Singapore's economy and  its  bright\r\n\r\nfuture. First, the development of industry will  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  provide the focal point for our  efforts  in\r\n\r\nthe future progress of economic development. At the\r\n\r\nsame  time, it will be a safeguard for our  society\r\n\r\nto  exist  in  a modernised and developed  economy.\r\n\r\nIndustry  will  play a very important  role  in  an\r\n\r\nindependent  Singapore. From the  figures  which  I\r\n\r\nwill  give  below, we can see that we  have  enough\r\n\r\nviability and verve to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1964 the Government provided sums totalling\r\n\r\n$120  million  for  industrial development.  It  is\r\n\r\nestimated   that  in  Jurong  the   investment   in\r\n\r\nindustrial  development by 1970  will  reach  about\r\n\r\n$200 million, and by 1980 this industrial city will\r\n\r\nbe  able to accommodate about one-half of the total\r\n\r\npopulation  of Singapore. The Economic  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  has already approved various loans.  By  the\r\n\r\nend  of last year it has reached $43 million.  They\r\n\r\nhave   directly  invested  in  various   industries\r\n\r\ntotalling   $15   million.  At  the   moment,   new\r\n\r\nindustries  number  110. Their  registered  capital\r\n\r\namounts to $649 million, with a paid-up capital  of\r\n\r\n$216.86  million.  By the end of last  year,  there\r\n\r\nwere  58  new factories which came into production.\r\n\r\nFour   other  factories  are  in  the   course   of\r\n\r\nconstruction.  These  factories  will  he  able  to\r\n\r\nprovide about 16,000 jobs for our citizens.  It  is\r\n\r\nexpected  that the annual production will be  worth\r\n\r\n$505.85 million. Last year there were 120 factories\r\n\r\nwhich were non-pioneer industry factories, engaging\r\n\r\nin  production. The investment reaches $44 million,\r\n\r\nthus providing 4,000 jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's husbandry has also made great\r\n\r\nachievements. It has brought about better prospects\r\n\r\nin   the   economy   of   Singapore.   Agricultural\r\n\r\nactivities have been neglected by the urban people.\r\n\r\nEvery  year the production of animals for  domestic\r\n\r\nneeds  will be about 20 million heads, 200 million\r\n\r\neggs,  750,000 pigs and 40,000 tons of  vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe  economic value of all this will amount to $200\r\n\r\nmillion. This agricultural produce will not only be\r\n\r\nsufficient for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  own  consumption, but there  will  also  be  a\r\n\r\nsurplus for export. It has been exported to various\r\n\r\nplaces in Malaysia. Such produce like eggs has also\r\n\r\nbeen   exported   to   Hong   Kong   and   adjacent\r\n\r\nterritories.  Singapore is the only  city  in  Asia\r\n\r\nwhich is able to export eggs. Statistics show  that\r\n\r\nin  1961  the  eggs exported reached $2.3  million.\r\n\r\nLast  year  it  has increased to $3.3 million.  The\r\n\r\ntotal   increase  in  exports  amounted  to   $1.06\r\n\r\nmillion.  In  the  same period, Singapore  imported\r\n\r\neggs  valued at $6.8 million. By 1964 there  was  a\r\n\r\nsharp  decrease to $3.8 million. The total decrease\r\n\r\nwas $3 million. That is a favourable figure to show\r\n\r\nthe success of our farmers. All this success is the\r\n\r\nresult  of  our hard work and the progress  of  the\r\n\r\nfarmers. It has shown that the Government's  policy\r\n\r\nhas  been  successful in raising their standard  of\r\n\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to comment on the boycott by the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis.  I  believe  the   people   are\r\n\r\nintelligent and when the right time comes they will\r\n\r\nbe able to understand the various activities of the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members and will be able  to  give  the\r\n\r\ncorrect  and just judgment on them. Let  us  expose\r\n\r\ntheir  facade of democracy and socialism. In  fact,\r\n\r\nthese   Opposition  Members  have  fallen  into   a\r\n\r\ncontradiction of foreign political philosophy. They\r\n\r\nhave  fallen into the contradiction of  the  Soviet\r\n\r\nrevisionist policy of peaceful co-existence on  the\r\n\r\none  hand,  and the orthodox Leninist line  on  the\r\n\r\nother.   This  has  resulted  in  a  division   and\r\n\r\ncontradiction  in  their  analysis  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nindependence.  In the end, the fact of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nindependence  cannot  be  ignored  by  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  and  the  pseudo  socialists,   or   even\r\n\r\naffected by their slogans and smears. History  will\r\n\r\nfinally  record that such people will fail  in  all\r\n\r\ntheir attempts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to give the people a very\r\n\r\nreliable  analysis.  In  order  to  understand  the\r\n\r\nactivities  of the pro-Communist Barisan  Sosialis,\r\n\r\nwe  should  go  a  step further and understand  the\r\n\r\nbackground of international relationships  so  that\r\n\r\nwe can have the right solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me say that Singapore is now an\r\n\r\nindependent   country,   and   it   has   been   so\r\n\r\ninternationally   recognised.   It   has   now   an\r\n\r\ninternational status. But the fate of  our  country\r\n\r\nis in the hands of the people. This is a Government\r\n\r\nelected by the people. All people, irrespective  of\r\n\r\nrace  and  class,  should unite  together  for  one\r\n\r\npurpose  - to fight shoulder to shoulder  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to reform our society so  that  we  can\r\n\r\nrealise   the  higher  objective  of  a   Malaysian\r\n\r\nSingapore.  At  the same time, we should  recognise\r\n\r\nthat  despite the political and economic separation\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  from Malaysia, the  demographic  and\r\n\r\ngeographical  factors are such that the  people  in\r\n\r\nthe  two  territories  are inseparable.  These  are\r\n\r\nfacts.  But, however much the other people wish  to\r\n\r\nforce  us  into our present temporary position,  we\r\n\r\ncan   strive  so  that  in  the  end,  through  the\r\n\r\ndetermined  effort of our people and in the  spirit\r\n\r\nof  Yu Koon who, according to Chinese legend, moved\r\n\r\nmountains, we can establish a multi-racial  society - a non-Communist, democratic socialist \r\n\r\nsociety - in this part of South-East Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I fully support the motion moved\r\n\r\nby the Minister for Finance on 13th December, 1965,\r\n\r\nin  connection with the 1966 Budget.  Although  our\r\n\r\ncountry is small, we are able to maintain a balance\r\n\r\nin  the  expenditure and revenue in  spite  of  the\r\n\r\nadditional burdens of defence and foreign  affairs,\r\n\r\nand  also without increasing taxation in the coming\r\n\r\nyear. This fact shows the soundness of our economic\r\n\r\nposition. Such a financial policy is also a healthy\r\n\r\none.  It  has  been praised and well  supported  by\r\n\r\npeople  from all sections in Singapore. On the  one\r\n\r\nhand,  the  Government is trying  to  industrialise\r\n\r\nand,  on  the other hand, it has also not neglected\r\n\r\nthe present entrepot trade. They are regarding this\r\n\r\nwith  favour.  Our country is trying  to  establish\r\n\r\ntrade relations with more countries, such as Russia\r\n\r\nand  African countries, and enter other markets  in\r\n\r\nthe  international field. This financial policy  is\r\n\r\nthe  most  suitable  one for  our  country  in  the\r\n\r\npresent context of\r\n\r\nSouth-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEast Asia. This is the correct policy to adopt. In\r\n\r\nthe  end,  it  will lead to economic  progress  and\r\n\r\nprosperity. It will bring more jobs to  our  people\r\n\r\nand  raise their living standard. At the same time,\r\n\r\nit   will  help  the  further  development  of  our\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, whether or not the economic base of\r\n\r\na  country is sound depends on population  and  the\r\n\r\nincrease in national income. The 1965 figures  show\r\n\r\na  total income of $2,100 million. But there was an\r\n\r\nincrease of $108 million in the subsequent  period.\r\n\r\nThe average income per capita in 1961 was $200, but\r\n\r\nthis  year it is about $1,200 per head. This  shows\r\n\r\nthe  increase in our national income per capita and\r\n\r\nthe  growth  of our economic development.  Although\r\n\r\nIndonesia has stopped its trade with us because  of\r\n\r\nconfrontation, this has not hampered us in any  way\r\n\r\nin our economic progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Economic Development Board has\r\n\r\nundertaken  joint  investments with  industrialists\r\n\r\nand,  as  a  result,  there  is  good  progress  in\r\n\r\nindustrial development in Jurong. According to what\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance has said, there  are  82\r\n\r\npioneer  factories  engaged  in  production.   They\r\n\r\nengage  9,000 workers. More factories  will  be  in\r\n\r\nproduction.  If  all  are in production,  then  the\r\n\r\nworkers  employed will be 15,000. The Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  has  also  announced that  the  industrial\r\n\r\noutput  is estimated at $1,100 million. This  shows\r\n\r\nan   increase  over  the  previous  year's  figure.\r\n\r\nAccording  to the Minister, our industries  have  a\r\n\r\nsound  foundation, and the aim  of  our  people  to\r\n\r\nindustrialise has now materialised.  With  the  \r\n\r\nco-operation  of  the Government, I  believe  that  in\r\n\r\nthree  or four years' time, our industries will  be\r\n\r\nvery  prosperous  and will definitely  bear  fruit,\r\n\r\nthus earning more foreign exchange for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the question of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation,  we  are  faced   with   certain\r\n\r\nproblems.  One of them concerns the working  class.\r\n\r\nFrom   1954-61,  there  were  general  strikes   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  which discouraged prospective local  and\r\n\r\nforeign investors from investing here. If they were\r\n\r\nto invest large sums of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney  in  local  industries, they would  naturally\r\n\r\nhope to get some profits and dividends. But if  the\r\n\r\nworkers  go on strike even before the products  are\r\n\r\nput  on  the market, then industries will be killed\r\n\r\neven   before   any  profits  can  be   made.   The\r\n\r\ninvestments  will thus come to nothing.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nour  Government, in order to alleviate the  worries\r\n\r\nof prospective investors in this respect, has drawn\r\n\r\nup  pioneer industry laws to provide safeguards and\r\n\r\ntax  concessions  to investors. On  the  one  hand,\r\n\r\nthese concessions are for three to five years, and,\r\n\r\non  the  other  hand, there is  provision  for  the\r\n\r\nregulation  of workers. So far, there has  been  no\r\n\r\ntrouble  in this field, and the workers  have  been\r\n\r\nable   to   live   and   work  smoothly   in   good\r\n\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, because of the importance of workers\r\n\r\nin  industrialisation and the importance  of  trade\r\n\r\nunionism  in  this  development programme,  let  me\r\n\r\ntouch  a  little on this. In trade unionism,  there\r\n\r\nare  apparently two factions. We all remember  that\r\n\r\nin  1961  there  was the argument for  and  against\r\n\r\nmerger and Malaysia, which led to an open split  in\r\n\r\nthe  leadership of the trade union movement.  There\r\n\r\nwere  the  pro-Communist trade unions  led  by  Lim\r\n\r\nChing  Siong  on  the one side and  the  democratic\r\n\r\nsocialist  unions  led by Mr Devan  Nair  on  the\r\n\r\nother  side.  Because  of conflicting  views,  they\r\n\r\nagreed to part, and trade unionism developed  along\r\n\r\ntwo  different lines. This led to the formation  of\r\n\r\nthe  present trade union, the N.T.U.C.,  consisting\r\n\r\nof  100,000 workers and which is non-Communist  and\r\n\r\ndemocratic  in principle. On the other hand,  there\r\n\r\nis  the Left-wing pro-Communist trade union led  by\r\n\r\npro-Communists  and  their  stooges,  who  use  the\r\n\r\nworkers as pawns in their political struggle. Their\r\n\r\nactions  and activities, which were detrimental  to\r\n\r\nthe  interests of the workers, did not satisfy  the\r\n\r\nworkers  and they resigned from their trade unions.\r\n\r\nThis  led  to  the collapse of these trade  unions.\r\n\r\nThey  are now on their way down the drain.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  the healthy non-Communist  democratic\r\n\r\ntrade unionism under the leadership of the N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nis  a  strong influence in nation building. If  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  lead  the  trade  union  movement  by\r\n\r\nproviding  intelligent leadership and treating  the\r\n\r\nworkers  with intelligence, then I believe that  it\r\n\r\nwill  grow  stronger day by day, and we can  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  our  Government's policy  on  labour  is  not\r\n\r\nchanged.  On 16th October, the Minister  said  that\r\n\r\nthe   Government's  policy  was  to  encourage  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment   of  non-Communist  democratic   trade\r\n\r\nunionism, so that it may be built into a strong -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

About  $100\r\n\r\nmillion  will  be allotted for housing development,\r\n\r\nof which $45 million will be for building and other\r\n\r\nsums  have  been allotted for other purposes.  This\r\n\r\ngoes  to show that the Government is not neglecting\r\n\r\nthis   project  and  other  development   projects,\r\n\r\ninclude  the  reclamation of  land.  This  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant  in land-hungry Singapore. On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  a  historic plan in urban  renewal  will  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out  next year and very soon  our  country\r\n\r\nwill  be  turned into a modernised country in  this\r\n\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the expenditure for next year will\r\n\r\nbe   about  one-quarter  of  our  budget.  This  is\r\n\r\nimportant,  because if we want our  country  to  be\r\n\r\nstrong, then we must popularise education and raise\r\n\r\nthe   educational  standard  of  the  people.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment   policy  is  to  regard  education   as\r\n\r\nimportant  as the social amenities to  the  people.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the $120 million to be  spent  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect   is  quite  a  handsome  sum.  Under   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  financial, commercial and  industrial\r\n\r\npolicies, we believe that our commerce and industry\r\n\r\nwill   be   able  to  develop  quickly.

Although Singapore\r\n\r\nis   a   small   nation  and  has   just   achieved\r\n\r\nindependence and sovereignty about four months ago,\r\n\r\nthe Minister's financial speech is an encouragement\r\n\r\nto  us  that  next year the financial  position  of\r\n\r\nSingapore will be sound. This will give inspiration\r\n\r\nto all the people of Singapore to face the problems\r\n\r\nahead.  The  people  of Singapore,  comprising  the\r\n\r\nvarious    races,   workers,   businessmen,    have\r\n\r\nconsidered  the  policy speech as a  balanced  one.\r\n\r\nThis is the result of the efficient efforts of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy that the Minister has given attention\r\n\r\nto  the social amenities and that in the budget for\r\n\r\nnext  year there will be a 10 per cent increase  in\r\n\r\nsocial   amenities.   I  feel   in   future   years\r\n\r\nallocations for social amenities will be  increased\r\n\r\nfurther. In order to create a multi-racial society,\r\n\r\nsuch  amenities  must be provided. These  will  not\r\n\r\nonly  be meant for one race, but for all races that\r\n\r\nlive  in  this country, irrespective of  colour  of\r\n\r\nskin,  language, or culture. The P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nis  based on social democracy. Since 1959  when  it\r\n\r\nfirst  assumed  office,  it has  worked  untiringly\r\n\r\ntowards the creation of a happy, prosperous  and  a\r\n\r\nmore  just  and equal society. We hope  that  these\r\n\r\nefforts will not only be confined to the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  alone, but will also be  meant  for  our\r\n\r\nneighbouring  population of ten  million.  But  our\r\n\r\nefforts  have  been  misunderstood  and  this   has\r\n\r\nresulted in our being kicked out of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to emphasise that the achievements made by\r\n\r\nour people, including the Malays, in Singapore have\r\n\r\nbeen  the  result  of a positive social  democracy.\r\n\r\nNobody  can  deny  this. If we compare  our  living\r\n\r\nconditions, particularly the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalays',  with our neighbours', we will  find  that\r\n\r\nthe  Malays  in  Singapore are  in  a  much  better\r\n\r\nposition   than  our  neighbours.  The  Malays   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  enjoy benefits not only in  housing  and\r\n\r\neducation  but also in other amenities like  supply\r\n\r\nof electricity and water, drains and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is clear that under a government\r\n\r\nbased on social democracy, the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nincluding the Malays of Islamic faith, can  achieve\r\n\r\ntheir  objects. All the accusations that only under\r\n\r\na  government  of Islamic religion can  the  Malays\r\n\r\nprosper  are nonsensical. Socialism is not  against\r\n\r\nany  religion. Socialism is not against Islam.  The\r\n\r\nteachings of Islam are not opposed to the  practice\r\n\r\nof  socialism.  Socialism, in fact, is  Islam.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, the payment of tithes, which is  done  by\r\n\r\nall the people of Islam throughout the world once a\r\n\r\nyear  -  shows  that Islam has the same  policy  as\r\n\r\nsocialism,  and  that  is to  create  a  harmonious\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nnothing  is  a better and more practical  New  Year\r\n\r\npresent to the 1.8 million people of Singapore than\r\n\r\nthe  1966  Budget Estimates presented by  the  Hon. Minister \r\n\r\nfor Finance. The budget, as a whole,  has won the confidence \r\n\r\nand trust of our people, to whom this  House  is  responsible,\r\n\r\nin  the  effort  and ability of the present Government to\r\n\r\ncreate a  more prosperous,  more just and more equal society.  \r\n\r\nThe hazards  and difficulties accompanying  the  sudden\r\n\r\npolitical  changes, namely, Singapore's  separation\r\n\r\nfrom  Malaysia and its emergence as an  independent\r\n\r\nsovereign  nation,  have  proved  to  be   not   so\r\n\r\nformidable  as expected. The panic of  some  people\r\n\r\nover  the  future  of Singapore, with  its  limited\r\n\r\nspace  and  resources, as a country independent  of\r\n\r\nothers,  has  turned  out to be  only  a  temporary\r\n\r\nnightmare.  Everything has turned  out  fine  after\r\n\r\nfour  crucial months have elapsed, and the majority\r\n\r\nof  our  people are now confident not only  in  the\r\n\r\nphysical  survival of Singapore as  a  nation,  but\r\n\r\nalso in the emergence of a more prosperous\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmulti-racial society. The Budget Estimates of  next\r\n\r\nyear have strengthened this belief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to point out\r\n\r\nseveral  things which the Government have  achieved\r\n\r\nor  have decided to accomplish in the coming years,\r\n\r\nand  which gives me grounds for my optimism in  the\r\n\r\nfuture  of the new State. First of all, it  is  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian confrontation that convinces me  of  the\r\n\r\nability  and the capacity of Singapore  to  survive\r\n\r\nand  prosper.  The people at large,  except  for  a\r\n\r\nsmall number of anti-national elements, rejoice  at\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  despite the ordeal  of  Indonesian\r\n\r\nconfrontation  for over two long  years,  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  been  able,  not  only to  overcome  the  loss\r\n\r\nresulting from the severance of trade, but also  to\r\n\r\nshow  an increase in our national income. In  fact,\r\n\r\nwe  expected  to lose 8.7 per cent in our  national\r\n\r\nincome  as  a result of this economic war,  but  we\r\n\r\nhave  managed to show a net increase of 2 per cent.\r\n\r\nThis   is   amazing.  And  again,  in   1964   when\r\n\r\nconfrontation reached its height, the gross capital\r\n\r\nformation  represents an increase of  28  per  cent\r\n\r\nover  1963. While the average rate of annual income\r\n\r\nincrease during the pre-confrontation years,  i.e.,\r\n\r\nfrom  1959  to  1963,  is only  22  per  cent.  And\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding  the confrontation,  the  value  of\r\n\r\nexternal trade also showed an increase of no  small\r\n\r\npercentage.  Considering the important part  played\r\n\r\nby  entrepot trade in the economy of Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe  amount  of trade we had with Indonesia  before\r\n\r\nthe  formation of Malaysia, this achievement of the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  is a near  miracle.  If  the\r\n\r\nnation  can and does survive and prosper under  the\r\n\r\ngravest  trial it has ever experienced, we have  no\r\n\r\nreason  to doubt its ability to continue to survive\r\n\r\nand    prosper   hereafter,   whether   there    is\r\n\r\nconfrontation of one type or another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point which I think is\r\n\r\nsignificant  is that the Government  has  taken  or\r\n\r\ndecided  to  take protective measures to  safeguard\r\n\r\nour   growing  industries.  Considering  the  role,\r\n\r\nespecially in future, of industries in ensuring our\r\n\r\nprosperity and the high standard of living,  it  is\r\n\r\njustifiable for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment to take whatever steps are necessary for\r\n\r\nthe  growth of our industries. One of the steps  is\r\n\r\nthe  imposition of customs duties on some  imported\r\n\r\ngoods,   especially   those  which   the   domestic\r\n\r\nindustries   have   been  able   or   prepared   to\r\n\r\nmanufacture. I understand that this is primarily  a\r\n\r\nreply  to  the  unfriendly action of the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment. Hon. Members of the House must be aware\r\n\r\nof  the consistent policy of the Government on  the\r\n\r\nother side of the Causeway aiming at smothering our\r\n\r\ninfant  industries out of sheer feminine  jealousy.\r\n\r\nThis  same  jealousy  had caused  the  eviction  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  from the Federation. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nanybody  with an average I.Q. will know  that  this\r\n\r\ncold  war  of  economy between the two  Governments\r\n\r\nwill  do no good to both parties, although  we  are\r\n\r\nconvinced that Singapore will suffer less,  if  any\r\n\r\nat all, in the long run. It is in this respect that\r\n\r\nI,  and  the  people at large, surely, welcome  the\r\n\r\nHon.  Minister  for  Finance's pledge  that  he  is\r\n\r\nwilling   at  any  moment  to  meet  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nrepresentatives to discuss the issue of economic \r\n\r\nco-operation  on  the basis of mutual benefit.  And  I\r\n\r\nalso hope that the Malaysian Government will review\r\n\r\nits  policy and will not reject our friendly  offer\r\n\r\non  no  sounder  ground  than  mere  jealousy.  The\r\n\r\nleaders of the Alliance Government should no longer\r\n\r\nbe  under  the illusion that Singapore will  suffer\r\n\r\nmore. They should not calculate the extent they can\r\n\r\nhurt Singapore, but how much they will benefit from\r\n\r\nmutual    co-operation.   I   also   applaud    the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  lifting of certain taxes  which  were\r\n\r\nimposed by the former Central Government and  which\r\n\r\nhad been the target of a nation-wide criticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the favourable conditions now, there is\r\n\r\nsufficient reason to anticipate the success of  our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation projects, and with this  success,\r\n\r\nwe would be able to find enough jobs every year for\r\n\r\nthe  school-leavers who are expected to  enter  the\r\n\r\nlabour  market.  If we are to succeed  in  bringing\r\n\r\nabout  a  more just and equal society in  terms  of\r\n\r\nemployment for all, then we cannot afford  to  fail\r\n\r\nin our industrialisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government does not neglect entrep\ufffdt\r\n\r\ntrade  in its Budget Estimates. This is proof  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government has recognised and appreciated  the\r\n\r\ntraditional role and contribution of entrep\ufffdt trade\r\n\r\nto  the  economy of Singapore. In fact,  before  we\r\n\r\nbecome a truly industrialised State, we must  still\r\n\r\ndepend mainly on entrep\ufffdt trade for our prosperity.\r\n\r\nIt  is  wise  for the Government to create  a  free\r\n\r\ntrade  zone  to  promote  and  facilitate  entrep\ufffdt\r\n\r\ntrade.  I  can  see that for many  years  to  come,\r\n\r\nentrep\ufffdt  trade will be parallel with  industry  as\r\n\r\ntwo essential life vessels of our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has a natural geographical position\r\n\r\nwhich is most favourable for trade, and it is  this\r\n\r\nsuperb  geographical position that makes  Singapore\r\n\r\nthe  fifth largest port in the world. We must  not,\r\n\r\nat any cost, surrender this natural gift, let alone\r\n\r\ngive it up of our own accord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the abundant harvest of the Singapore\r\n\r\nGoodwill  Mission  led  by the  Hon.  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister who returned recently from a tour of \r\n\r\nAfro-Asian and East European countries, is an example of\r\n\r\nwhat this type of mission can do to help boost  our\r\n\r\ntrade  with  the world, especially those  countries\r\n\r\nwhere industries are still in their infancy. I hope\r\n\r\nthe  Government will send more missions, especially\r\n\r\ntrade  missions, abroad, as frequently as possible,\r\n\r\nwithin the capacity of our limited resources.  This\r\n\r\nis  as important as imposing protective tariffs  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the growth of our industries. Meanwhile,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  encourage the  organisation  of\r\n\r\nunofficial  commercial  missions  and   give   them\r\n\r\nmaximum  convenience and assistance.  Semi-official\r\n\r\nmissions  where Government officials and  merchants\r\n\r\ncombine will, in my opinion, bring greater results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch on the $1.5 million\r\n\r\ninvolved  in the Government's intention to  change\r\n\r\nidentity  cards  and  the $55,000  which  will  be\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  the expenditure on work  permits.

Otherwise, the\r\n\r\nunemployment problem will deteriorate; the  present\r\n\r\nprosperity   will   be   jeopardised:    and    the\r\n\r\nGovernment's Second Five-Year Plan will  be  killed\r\n\r\nin  the  bud.  However, Sir, in dealing  with  this\r\n\r\nproblem,  which  is  rather  a  delicate  one,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should take care to see that the feeling\r\n\r\nof  the  masses over the other side of the Causeway\r\n\r\nwill  not  be hurt too much. We should always  show\r\n\r\nour  sympathy,  not  only sympathy  but  also  give\r\n\r\nspiritual  strength and encouragement to  them.  We\r\n\r\nmust  see  that  our actions do  not  endanger  the\r\n\r\ntraditional friendship between the peoples  of  the\r\n\r\ntwo countries, especially their high esteem towards\r\n\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the next thing I wish to\r\n\r\nmention  is  the  introduction of  the  Income  Tax\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill which repeals the  unsatisfactory\r\n\r\npractice  of  the  former Central  Government.  The\r\n\r\npeople  in general, and the fair sex in particular,\r\n\r\nmust  rejoice at this offer of the Government.  One\r\n\r\nof  the signs by which the extent of development of\r\n\r\na  country  is  judged is the percentage  of  women\r\n\r\nemployees  in the total working force. It  is  true\r\n\r\nthat the more women are engaged in nation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuilding, the more advanced the country  is.  As  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  fact, there are very  few  jobs   which\r\n\r\ncannot be handled by women with equal efficiency as\r\n\r\ncompared  with  men, in fact, Sir, there  are  many\r\n\r\njobs  which are monopolised by them. Therefore,  it\r\n\r\nwill be a great loss for the nation if the fair sex\r\n\r\nconfine themselves to their kitchens. Sir,  when  I\r\n\r\nsay  \"fair sex\", I mean the fair sexes of all races\r\n\r\n-  Chinese, Malays, Indians and so on. And the best\r\n\r\nway to encourage them to contribute their share  in\r\n\r\nnation-building is to let their incomes be assessed\r\n\r\nseparately from their husbands. It is also wise for\r\n\r\nthe Government to re-impose the upper tax of 55 per\r\n\r\ncent  on  personal incomes of $100,000 or more,  on\r\n\r\nthe  principle that the heavier burden of  taxation\r\n\r\nshould be borne by those best able to hear it. This\r\n\r\nis a principle to bring about a more just and equal\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to touch on is education.\r\n\r\nThe  present  Government's education policy  is  to\r\n\r\npromote   the   four  streams  of  languages.   The\r\n\r\nestimated  expenditure allotted to  education  next\r\n\r\nyear  amounts  to  $129 million out  of  the  total\r\n\r\nexpenditure  estimate  of $506  million.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  it  is  about  one-quarter  of  the   total\r\n\r\nexpenditure. Besides, there is a sum of $28 million\r\n\r\nfor  development purposes of the Ministry. The fact\r\n\r\nthat  education consumes the greatest part  of  our\r\n\r\nrevenue is our tradition, a tradition treasured  by\r\n\r\na  responsible government. In some countries of the\r\n\r\nworld  today, the greatest part of the government's\r\n\r\nrevenue  goes  to  buying and  producing  arms  and\r\n\r\nammunition  and  the maintenance  of  strong  armed\r\n\r\nforces.  In this respect, we are considered  lucky,\r\n\r\nfor we have a government which spends more money on\r\n\r\nbuilding  more schools and training more  teachers.\r\n\r\nSir,  in  a  nation  like ours,  where  the  social\r\n\r\nstructure  is a multi-racial one, education  has  a\r\n\r\nmore  important part to play. It is in the  schools\r\n\r\nwhere our younger generation learn to live with one\r\n\r\nanother irrespective of race, colour, language  and\r\n\r\ncreed.  It  is in the schools where they  learn  to\r\n\r\ncreate  a  multi-racial society.  Considering  this\r\n\r\nsacred task of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnation-building   burdened   by    our    education\r\n\r\nprogramme,  it  is  more  than  justified  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to put such a big amount of public funds\r\n\r\nat the disposal of the Minister for Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, incidentally, I recall the Government's\r\n\r\nintention  to introduce a new measure on the  study\r\n\r\nof  a second language. It is decided that the study\r\n\r\nof  a  second  language, other than the  medium  of\r\n\r\ninstruction,  will  be  made  compulsory   in   all\r\n\r\nsecondary schools, and instruction will begin  with\r\n\r\nSecondary  I  in 1966. I can foresee the  day  when\r\n\r\nthere  is no language barrier between the component\r\n\r\nraces of our society. Making our younger generation\r\n\r\nwell  versed in at least two languages is the  most\r\n\r\npractical  and surest way to ensure the  successful\r\n\r\ncreation of a multi-racial society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the last, but not the least\r\n\r\nimportant  point I want to touch on is the  problem\r\n\r\nof  defence and security of our country. As all  of\r\n\r\nus  know, all the good things now in our possession\r\n\r\nand  those  which are expected in future  are  only\r\n\r\nreal  and  true within the framework of  peace  and\r\n\r\norder.  This is why we have been relying on British\r\n\r\nforces  for  the safety of our lives and  property.\r\n\r\nAll  the  world,  except  Indonesia  and  the \r\n\r\npro-communist Barisan Sosialis, has not denied  us  the\r\n\r\nright   to   survive  and  the  right  to   protect\r\n\r\nourselves.   But  as  an  independent   non-aligned\r\n\r\nnation,  we  cannot justify ourselves  if  we  keep\r\n\r\nBritish  forces  on our territory forever,  not  to\r\n\r\nmention that the British Government might take  the\r\n\r\ninitiative  to withdraw its bases one  day  due  to\r\n\r\nfinancial difficulties or other reasons. Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  must look ahead to the day when we have to rely\r\n\r\non ourselves. It is high time for us to prepare and\r\n\r\nto  start  doing something. Sir, that  is  why  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  decides to spend about $70  million  on\r\n\r\nsecurity    and   defence.   Compared   with    our\r\n\r\ncontribution   to  the  former  Malaysian   Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  for their expenditure on  our  security\r\n\r\nand  defence,  which is 40 per cent  of  our  State\r\n\r\nrevenue,  we spend much less now. We must establish\r\n\r\nand keep small armed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforces strong enough for defence purpose. We  never\r\n\r\nwant to, and can never, invade other countries.  We\r\n\r\nwant  to  be friendly with all countries, East  and\r\n\r\nWest.  But we do not want to be molested.  Although\r\n\r\nwe  are a small nation, we will show the world that\r\n\r\nwe  want  to  be left alone. The Government  should\r\n\r\ntake  pains to explain to our people our  position.\r\n\r\nWe  must  not  underestimate the influence  of  the\r\n\r\ntraditional attitude towards enlistment, especially\r\n\r\namong  the  Chinese community.  We  must  also  not\r\n\r\nexpect ordinary people to understand the details of\r\n\r\nthe  Government statement published  in  the  local\r\n\r\nPress.  More publicity, especially direct  contacts\r\n\r\nbetween  Government  leaders and  the  people,  are\r\n\r\nrequired  to arouse the interest of our  people  in\r\n\r\njoining the Volunteer Army Forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a small State like ours, to maintain social\r\n\r\norder  and  internal security, is no less important\r\n\r\nthan  keeping out aggressors. Singapore shares  the\r\n\r\ncommon problem that all cosmopolitan cities in  the\r\n\r\nworld face. We have to fight social evils and crime\r\n\r\nwhich  find  their  hot-bed  in  heavily  populated\r\n\r\ncities.  We  are fortunate enough to  have  a  very\r\n\r\nefficient  police  force.  The  number  of   secret\r\n\r\nsociety incidents has rapidly decreased since 1959.\r\n\r\nThis is a clear reflection on the effectiveness  of\r\n\r\nour police force. Sir, our police force has also  a\r\n\r\nduty  to check and curb subversive activities of  a\r\n\r\npolitical, racial, or religious nature. In view  of\r\n\r\nthe  wide range and large amount of work they  have\r\n\r\nto  do, the Government is expanding the size of the\r\n\r\npolice force. The two riots that happened last year\r\n\r\nwould  not  have  been  handled  by  unpopular  and\r\n\r\nviolent  armed  forces had we had  our  own  police\r\n\r\nforce  strong  enough to cope with  the  situation.\r\n\r\nSir,  this is also a painful lesson - that we  must\r\n\r\ntrust nobody but ourselves in case of emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to call upon this\r\n\r\nHouse  to  give  full approval of the  1966  Budget\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been well received by the public  since\r\n\r\nits   presentation.  Sir,  the  whole  nation   has\r\n\r\nexpressed  its confidence in entrusting its  future\r\n\r\nto   the   hands  of  the  People's  Action   Party\r\n\r\nGovernment. And I am sure, if nothing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngoes   wrong  with  the  behaviour  of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants  in  serving the people  efficiently  and\r\n\r\ncordially, then the bringing about of a more  just\r\n\r\nand  equal  multi-racial society will be  realised\r\n\r\nsooner than we expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.28 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as has already\r\n\r\nbeen pointed out by my colleague, the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance,  in  his  Budget speech,  expenditure  on\r\n\r\nsocial  services  has been on the  increase  every\r\n\r\nyear.  For  education  and  health  services,  for\r\n\r\nexample, there has been a ten per cent increase in\r\n\r\nexpenditure this year over that of last year,  and\r\n\r\nthe  1966  Budget provides for a similar order  of\r\n\r\nincrease  next  year. This is, of  course,  as  it\r\n\r\nshould  be,  for  the continuing  improvement  and\r\n\r\nexpansion of social services is in accordance with\r\n\r\nthe  declared  socialist aim of the Government  to\r\n\r\nprovide  more  of the amenities of  life  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  as  part  of  the  general  objective   of\r\n\r\nbringing about a more just and equal society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of social welfare, where the needs\r\n\r\nof  the  handicapped  and underprivileged  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety  are  catered for, as  distinct  from  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of the people generally, there has  been  a\r\n\r\nconstant  endeavour  not  only  to  maintain   the\r\n\r\nexisting   level  and  standard  of  the  services\r\n\r\nprovided, but also to improve and expand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the coming into operation this year of the\r\n\r\nWoodlands Home for old people, which has a maximum\r\n\r\ncapacity of 500, the Social Welfare Department now\r\n\r\nruns  a  total  of 12 welfare institutions,  which\r\n\r\nbetween them provide care and shelter for all  age\r\n\r\ngroups, from boys and girls of school-going age to\r\n\r\nthe  aged and infirm. To provide for future needs,\r\n\r\nplans  have  been  formulated  for  two  new   Old\r\n\r\nPeople's  Homes on the same lines as the Woodlands\r\n\r\nHome,  and a Junior Approved School for boys.  The\r\n\r\nJunior  Approved School will provide training  and\r\n\r\nrehabilitation facilities on up-to-date lines  for\r\n\r\nboys  below  the  age  of 13 (the  present  Gimson\r\n\r\nSchool\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovides  for  boys  above  13),  and  will   have\r\n\r\naccommodation for 80 boys. In addition, there  are\r\n\r\nplans  to  build extensions to an existing  Girls'\r\n\r\nHome  and  a  Boys' Home in order to increase  the\r\n\r\naccommodation    and   improve   the    facilities\r\n\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on the Social Welfare Department, I should\r\n\r\nlike  to draw attention to the fact that the  1966\r\n\r\nprovision for the Public Assistance Scheme,  which\r\n\r\nprovides financial relief for the unemployed among\r\n\r\nour   citizens  ($9.6  million)  shows  a  welcome\r\n\r\nreduction  as compared with this year's  provision\r\n\r\nof $10 million. This is, indeed, a healthy sign, a\r\n\r\nclear    indication   that   despite    Indonesian\r\n\r\nconfrontation  our unemployment problem  has  been\r\n\r\nkept under control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members would have read in the Press  about\r\n\r\nthe public display that was given by the Singapore\r\n\r\nFire Brigade at Empress Place recently. It was the\r\n\r\nfirst  display  of  its kind  in  the  history  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,   and  gave  the  people  a  heartening\r\n\r\nassurance  of  the efficiency and quality  of  the\r\n\r\nFire  Brigade.  In particular, I  should  like  to\r\n\r\nmention  the  two latest items of equipment  which\r\n\r\nhave been acquired by the Fire Brigade and both of\r\n\r\nwhich  were  demonstrated in the  display:  a  new\r\n\r\n\"Snorkel\"   Fire  Engine,  which  is  the   latest\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  fire  fighting  and  particularly\r\n\r\nadapted  for fire fighting and rescue  work  among\r\n\r\nhigh  buildings,  and the Foam Cannon,  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  specially  designed  for  dealing  with  oil\r\n\r\nfires. There are also expansion plans for the Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade. Work is expected to start next year on  a\r\n\r\nnew  $2.5  million Fire Station to serve  the  new\r\n\r\nsatellite town that is coming up in Toa Payoh, and\r\n\r\nplans  have  been formulated for yet another  Fire\r\n\r\nStation  to  serve the Jurong industrial  complex.\r\n\r\nWith  the completion of these two projects  during\r\n\r\nthe  next five years, Singapore will have a  total\r\n\r\nof seven fire stations located strategically on  a\r\n\r\nregional  basis to provide protection against  the\r\n\r\nhazards  of  fire, which must grow  in  a  rapidly\r\n\r\ndeveloping society like ours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has not,\r\n\r\nhowever, forgotten that our progressive and \r\n\r\nhard-working   population   also   needs   recreational\r\n\r\nfacilities for their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleisure hours. The new Faber Scenic Park, which was\r\n\r\nofficially opened last year, and the latest Raffles\r\n\r\nPark Garden-cum-Car Park, which was recently opened\r\n\r\nby  the Prime Minister, have already proved  to  be\r\n\r\nSingapore's  favourite resorts during the  evenings\r\n\r\nand   on  public  holidays.  It  is  my  Ministry's\r\n\r\nintention to continue to increase and improve these\r\n\r\nrecreational    facilities.    A    programme    of\r\n\r\nimprovements  has  already  been  put  in  hand  to\r\n\r\nenhance and beautify the existing facilities at the\r\n\r\nBotanic  Gardens,  including  the  building  of  an\r\n\r\nornamental  bridge across the Lake, and  there  are\r\n\r\nplans  to  extend  the Faber  Scenic  Park  to  the\r\n\r\nadjacent  land and hill, to clean up  and  beautify\r\n\r\nthe  very popular beach resort at Nicoll Drive, and\r\n\r\nto  provide  more children's playgrounds especially\r\n\r\nin   the  densely  populated  areas  of  the   city\r\n\r\nenvironments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister in charge of sport, I should like\r\n\r\nto refer to the Government's plan to build an \r\n\r\nup-to-date  sports  complex including a  National  Sports\r\n\r\nStadium of Olympic standards at Kallang. This is  a\r\n\r\nmajor  project which, when completed, will  give  a\r\n\r\ntremendous  boost  to  the promotion  of  sport  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  will help to put Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\nforefront in the field of international sport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic objectives and policies of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Culture, which have been geared to the long-term\r\n\r\nneeds,  hopes and aspirations of our  people  in  a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial society, have not required any radical\r\n\r\nreappraisal after separation and independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continual policy of preserving the basic\r\n\r\nelements of our four different cultural streams and\r\n\r\naccentuating those facets of our heritage that will\r\n\r\nensure national unity, still stands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy can be instrumental not only in\r\n\r\nbuilding an abiding multi-racial society with \r\n\r\nbuilt-in  constitutional safe-guards for minority groups,\r\n\r\nbut can also serve as a bridge of amity between our\r\n\r\npeople   and  the  people  of  Malaysia   who   are\r\n\r\ntraditionally one people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, as in the past, the total effect of\r\n\r\nthe  various divisions of the Ministry  of  Culture\r\n\r\nwill be, on the one hand, to provide the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  friendly peoples in other parts of  the  world\r\n\r\nwith essential information on the nation's policies\r\n\r\nand  activities,  and on the other,  to  guide  and\r\n\r\nsustain  our  people  in their cultural,  artistic,\r\n\r\nintellectual and other pursuits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of multi-lingualism and\r\n\r\nmulti-culturalism, Radio and Television Singapura \r\n\r\nwill go on   informing,  educating  and  entertaining  \r\n\r\nour people,  and in conformity with the Government  and\r\n\r\npeople's  four  equal-language policy,  daily  news\r\n\r\ncasts   are   being  transmitted  over  radio   and\r\n\r\ntelevision.  Such a practice not only benefits  the\r\n\r\nmost  number  of  people but  also  reinforces  the\r\n\r\nsuperstructure of our multi-racial society.  Hence,\r\n\r\nthe  practice  also of juxtaposing Malay,  Chinese,\r\n\r\nTamil and English programmes over television.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, over a period of time, we expect powerfully\r\n\r\nto  demonstrate  the  virtues  of  multi-racialism,\r\n\r\nmulti-lingualism and multi-culturalism and, at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, the futility of the one-language, \r\n\r\none-race and one-culture doctrine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The completion of the new Television Building and\r\n\r\nStudios  in the middle of 1966 will result in  more\r\n\r\nviewing  hours for our people. Also the quality  of\r\n\r\nprogrammes   can  be  stepped  up   and   improved.\r\n\r\nTelevision time over both channels will increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while on this subject, I gather\r\n\r\nthat  some of our viewers are annoyed with the hard\r\n\r\nselling of merchandise over television at the  most\r\n\r\nexciting  times of the best programmes.  Scientific\r\n\r\nresearch   into  human  nature  has   revealed   to\r\n\r\nadvertisers  these  periods  as  being   the   most\r\n\r\neffective on the sub-conscious minds of even  those\r\n\r\nwho  are apparently unhappy. The net result is more\r\n\r\nmoney  from this source of revenue and a  lessening\r\n\r\nof  the  burden  on the taxpayer for the  essential\r\n\r\nbroadcasting services and the possibility of buying\r\n\r\nbetter  programmes. This practice is now universal,\r\n\r\nand  besides  being  a  dollar earner,  advertising\r\n\r\nstimulates economic activity in the State. In  1965\r\n\r\na gross return of $4.3 million is expected from the\r\n\r\nCommercial Service, which represents 53 per cent of\r\n\r\nthe  recurrent  expenditure  for  the  broadcasting\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith more time over television from the latter part\r\n\r\nof  next  year,  the income will no doubt  increase\r\n\r\nwhen  consideration  can be given  to  having  less\r\n\r\nfrequent commercials in any particular programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a State where about half a million children\r\n\r\nare  at school, the value of educational television\r\n\r\ncannot  be  over-emphasised. This  is  now  in  the\r\n\r\nplanning  stage  and  in 1966  a  pilot  scheme  is\r\n\r\nexpected to come into operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but by no means least, in the light of\r\n\r\nindependence,  external  publicity  has  become   a\r\n\r\n\"must\".  Through  our external short-wave  networks\r\n\r\nand through other media of publicity, including our\r\n\r\nmissions   abroad,  our  situation,  ideology   and\r\n\r\nreaction to world affairs can be made known to  our\r\n\r\nfriends in Afro-Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acceptance of Malay as our national language\r\n\r\nsince  1959 was and is based on multi-racial logic,\r\n\r\npolitical  acumen and common sense.  Internally,  a\r\n\r\nnational  language can serve several  purposes.  It\r\n\r\ncan effectively weld the various communities into a\r\n\r\ncompact  national unity. Malays, Chinese,  Indians,\r\n\r\nand  others can think of themselves as part of  one\r\n\r\npeople who speak a common national language.  Other\r\n\r\nadvantages  also  accrue from  a  common  language.\r\n\r\nThrough  our  language policy, most of our  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration  will  be in the fortunate  position  of\r\n\r\nbeing bi-lingual or even tri-lingual. Their horizon\r\n\r\nbeing  broadened, they will be able to pick up  the\r\n\r\nbest from the literary and technical literature  of\r\n\r\nthese languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While accepting Malay as the national language,\r\n\r\nour  people  are  exhorted to  study  their  mother\r\n\r\ntongue  as  well. Language liberalism, as practised\r\n\r\nby  us, will make for greater national progress  in\r\n\r\nthe  long  run.  A national proficient  in  several\r\n\r\nlanguages  will he able to pick the best  from  the\r\n\r\nwisdom and knowledge in the literature of the other\r\n\r\nlanguages.  Apart from regular lessons  over  radio\r\n\r\nand  television, National Language Months were held\r\n\r\nin 1965. The first, in June 1965, generated a great\r\n\r\ndeal of enthusiasm among all sectors of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npopulation,  as  evinced  by  the  wide  range   of\r\n\r\nactivities  that  took place. The  second  National\r\n\r\nLanguage Month, which was recently concluded, again\r\n\r\ncreated a great impact on our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underlying aim is to spread the use of the\r\n\r\nnational language at all nation-wide levels. It  is\r\n\r\nthe Government's wish that employers in the private\r\n\r\nsector provide facilities and inducements to  their\r\n\r\nemployees  to  study  the  national  language.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  will continue the same policy  in  1966\r\n\r\nwith  promise  of  more varied and more  meaningful\r\n\r\nlanguage activities in the coming year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, increasing importance is being\r\n\r\nattached to the National Museum now that we  are  a\r\n\r\nsovereign and independent nation. As the repository\r\n\r\nof  our  cultural heritage, it has been a  constant\r\n\r\ncentre  of attraction to our own people as well  as\r\n\r\nto  visitors.  Its modernisation is  already  under\r\n\r\nway.   In   the  endeavour  to  stimulate  cultural\r\n\r\nactivities, funds are being secured for the  coming\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with civic organisations, the\r\n\r\nproduction  of  artistic work by local  people  has\r\n\r\nbeen  given  a  fillip.  A  great  number  of   art\r\n\r\nexhibitions and other cultural activities highlight\r\n\r\nthe  year 1965. The Government encourages new modes\r\n\r\nof expression to impart identity to our new nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Theatre Trust is empowered by\r\n\r\nlegislation  as  an  agency for promoting  cultural\r\n\r\nactivities.  It is actively engaged in  planning  a\r\n\r\nwider range of activities for the coming year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture has endeavoured to fulfil\r\n\r\nthe  major  cultural  needs  of  the  people.  More\r\n\r\nremains  to  be  done in the coming year,  and  the\r\n\r\nindication  is  that  1966  will  see   a   greater\r\n\r\nflowering   in   the  artistic,  intellectual   and\r\n\r\ncultural activities in our State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A multi-racial society inevitably poses a greater\r\n\r\nvariety   of  problems  than  a  homogeneous   one.\r\n\r\nSolutions to them are many - some are crabbed while\r\n\r\nothers are downright stupid. Our solution based  on\r\n\r\na  multi-racial rationale cannot be wrong. Our  aim\r\n\r\nis to make our approach humane, just, practical and\r\n\r\nacceptable. This is necessarily a difficult\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand long-term task, and constructive criticisms and\r\n\r\nsuggestions are always welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  in  discussing  our  financial\r\n\r\nbudget  for  next  year,  we  are  discussing   the\r\n\r\ngigantic  plan  of  economic  development   of   an\r\n\r\nemerging country. Our heart is filled with joy  and\r\n\r\nnew  hope. We have sufficient determination jointly\r\n\r\nto shoulder the heavy task of economic construction\r\n\r\nof our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today what gives us regret is that the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  Opposition  are  not  shouldering   their\r\n\r\nresponsibility,   but  instead  adopt   a   passive\r\n\r\nattitude  of  total  disregard  for  the  \r\n\r\npeople - boycotting  the  Parliament.  And  when  our  newly\r\n\r\nemerging  country is marching a step forward,  they\r\n\r\nare trying to sabotage the progress of our country.\r\n\r\nThe  objective  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  is   to\r\n\r\ndestroy.  All  along they have  been  adopting  the\r\n\r\nattitude   of   disruption   of   national   unity,\r\n\r\ndisrupting  the  construction of the  country,  and\r\n\r\ndestroying   the   national   economy.   They   are\r\n\r\nharbouring the thought of turning Singapore  \r\n\r\ntopsy-turvy  so  that  they can realise  their  dream  of\r\n\r\nbuilding  an  ideal  country  from  the  debris  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, because of their boycott, we must solemnly\r\n\r\npoint    out   their   mistakes   and   mischievous\r\n\r\nactivities.    Undoubtedly   they    should    give\r\n\r\nresponsible  constructive criticism, but  they  are\r\n\r\nnot  doing so. Instead they have engaged themselves\r\n\r\nin   destroying   and   sabotaging   our   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment and national interests. Their action is\r\n\r\nmost   incomprehensible.  As  an  independent   and\r\n\r\nemerging  country, we look forward  to  a  peaceful\r\n\r\nstruggle in order to achieve victory, but our  hope\r\n\r\nfor peace is not less than any other country's. For\r\n\r\nthe  sake  of preserving our national security  and\r\n\r\ndefence and the rights and interests of the people,\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  strengthen our  defence.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nnecessary   safeguard  for  our  independence   and\r\n\r\nsecurity. As an independent democratic peace-loving\r\n\r\ncountry,  our  Budget is full of such spirit.  From\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfigures  of  revenue  and expenditure,  both  total\r\n\r\nabout  $500  million.  Education  will  incur  $129\r\n\r\nmillion  for  next year, which is $16 million  more\r\n\r\nthan that of the previous year. Of the $275 million\r\n\r\nfor  the Development Estimates, the Ministry of Law\r\n\r\nand  National Development gets 50 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure. I point out these figures in order  to\r\n\r\nstress  a  characteristic of the whole  Budget.  In\r\n\r\nother words, the characteristic of the whole Budget\r\n\r\nreflects  the Government's hope of progress,  peace\r\n\r\nand construction. They are important factors in our\r\n\r\nmarch towards peace, democracy and progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning of 1966, there will be a new\r\n\r\nFive-Year Development Plan in order to implement  a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial  society in which  there  is  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment and prosperity. In the first  Five-Year\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Plan,  the  Government  has   already\r\n\r\nexpended $192 million and built 51,000 units of \r\n\r\nlow-cost  houses,  to  provide accommodation  for  \r\n\r\none-quarter  of our population. The Housing Board  will\r\n\r\nin  the  next Five-Year Plan build 12,000 units  of\r\n\r\nlow-cost houses yearly. It is expected that by  the\r\n\r\nend  of  the Five-Year Plan, 60,000 units of houses\r\n\r\nand  shop-houses  will have been  built,  and  that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be reclamation of marshes and  beaches\r\n\r\nand urban renewal. There will be P.W.D. development\r\n\r\nand other construction plans. What I like to stress\r\n\r\nis that these gigantic long-term construction plans\r\n\r\nhave  all  been stipulated in our Budget  in  order\r\n\r\nthat  we  may carry them out orderly and  that  the\r\n\r\nplanning can be done in the first year with a  good\r\n\r\nstart. This is a long-term plan and not on a \r\n\r\nyear-to-year basis. And we want to start right from  the\r\n\r\ncorrect perspective. Our stand is very clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Estimates touch on reclamation of\r\n\r\nthe  sea. If there is a saying that God created the\r\n\r\nsea  and  the Dutch created the land, then  we  can\r\n\r\nchange  it  into that God created the sea  but  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore created the land. This is  the\r\n\r\nright time for us to do so. There are many examples\r\n\r\nin  our Budget to show that there has not been  any\r\n\r\nmiscalculation or wasting of money. It is a  Budget\r\n\r\nin which every single\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncent  is scrupulously used for the benefit  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  For instance, the American Defence  Budget\r\n\r\nfor  1966,  according to the United  Press  Agency,\r\n\r\nwill  increase to U.S.$6l,000 million.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nthis  is the result of direct American intervention\r\n\r\nin   the  Vietnamese  war.  Of  course,  I  am  not\r\n\r\ncriticising  or comparing the American Budget  with\r\n\r\nour   Budget.  I  am  only  mentioning  it  as   an\r\n\r\ninteresting contrast. From this, you can  see  that\r\n\r\nthe  total  Budget  for 1966 for Singapore  is,  in\r\n\r\nactual  fact,  one  part out of  366  of  America's\r\n\r\nDefence  Budget.  Now what is the  percentage?  The\r\n\r\nother point is that America is considering spending\r\n\r\n$10,000 million every year on South Vietnam, mainly\r\n\r\non  military aid. One-sixtieth part of it  will  be\r\n\r\nenough for Singapore's development construction for\r\n\r\none year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say that if the ultra adventurists or\r\n\r\nracialist   ultra   elements   want   to    destroy\r\n\r\nSingapore's  economic construction  and  system  in\r\n\r\norder to turn Singapore into a hot-bed of war,  and\r\n\r\nif  they  succeed,  then we will  not  be  able  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  the Budget. I have said that there  is  no\r\n\r\nwasting  of money as shown in the Budget.  Speaking\r\n\r\nfrom  the construction aspect, every cent has  been\r\n\r\nwell  spent,  except that $500  allowance  for  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Members.  They want to get  the  allowance\r\n\r\nwithout  being  willing to do the  same  amount  of\r\n\r\nwork,  to shoulder their responsibilities  for  the\r\n\r\npeople.  If  the  Minister  for  Finance  wants  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  a cut in their allowance, then, on  behalf\r\n\r\nof  the people of Jalan Besar, I fully support  him\r\n\r\nshould  he  wish  to make some adjustment  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, our Finance Minister has ably and in\r\n\r\na straightforward manner presented his Budget to\r\n\r\nthis House. The Government for this year has\r\n\r\nexempted industrialists from paying the necessary\r\n\r\ntaxes. In considering the welfare of the workers,\r\n\r\nthe Government should ensure fair wages. If\r\n\r\nGovernment does not do that, productivity will go\r\n\r\ndown. Increasing productivity is important to us;\r\n\r\nthen only can prices be kept down and exports\r\n\r\nencouraged. The Minister for Finance will have to\r\n\r\npay particular attention to this. Otherwise,\r\n\r\nsubversive elements will influence workers to go on\r\n\r\nto the wrong path. Then there will be trouble in\r\n\r\nthe State. So we have to pay attention to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance in his Budget has also ably set out arguments against back-dating. But civil servants and workers in Government have their own unions. If talks with them are prolonged, and when decisions are finally reached but the agreement is not to be back-dated, then what is the\r\n\r\nreason for it? Is that the mistake of the unions or\r\n\r\nthe  Government?  We  must  examine  this  question\r\n\r\nthoroughly.   When   the  unions   submit   certain\r\n\r\nproposals,  the  officials  concerned  prolong  the\r\n\r\ndiscussion.    Therefore,   the   Government    are\r\n\r\nresponsible. They should not blame the unions. They\r\n\r\nlike  to  implement it from the date on  which  the\r\n\r\nagreement  is signed. They should look  into  this.\r\n\r\nWhen  talks  are to be held, the Government  should\r\n\r\naccelerate them and try to find decisions  quickly.\r\n\r\nIf  we do it this way, then the unions will not  be\r\n\r\nfrustrated.  They  will then  be  prepared  to  \r\n\r\nco-operate  with  the  Government and  do  their  work\r\n\r\nproperly.  I  would  therefore  like  to  ask   the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  pay  attention  to  it.  If  we  make\r\n\r\nconcessions  to  the unions, they  will  co-operate\r\n\r\nwith us, will act responsibly and will continue  to\r\n\r\nassist  us.  So the Minister should find  ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans of doing this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nexpect our new Finance Minister to present to  this\r\n\r\nHouse a deficit budget instead of a surplus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nbudget,  for a surplus budget indicates a  pedantic\r\n\r\nluxury.  However,  the  Finance  Minister's  Budget\r\n\r\nspeech  does reflect the Government's determination\r\n\r\nto put our economy on a sound footing. I am pleased\r\n\r\nto  note that the Finance Minister has not  let  us\r\n\r\ndown.  The  nation  has  full  confidence  in   his\r\n\r\nability, and the allotment to development programme\r\n\r\nas  well  as housing and social services  indicates\r\n\r\nhis  appreciation of the gravity of  the  situation\r\n\r\nand  also  the  immediate necessity  to  raise  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  living of the people by  adding  more\r\n\r\npositive points to the economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my appreciation need not necessarily mean\r\n\r\nthat  I  fully subscribe to the ideas contained  in\r\n\r\nevery  aspect of this budget, as well as the policy\r\n\r\nbehind it. It is extremely difficult and physically\r\n\r\nnot possible to go through the entire budget with a\r\n\r\ntooth-comb  and  offer constructive criticisms  and\r\n\r\nsuggestions. Nevertheless, I shall make an  attempt\r\n\r\nto analyse the budget from the point of view of the\r\n\r\nworkers  who  have to contribute the  lion's  share\r\n\r\ntowards  the  successful  implementation   of   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment programmes of our democratic  socialist\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A look at the budget tends to create a feeling of\r\n\r\nappreciation   and  apprehension.   Regarding   our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme, the  Finance  Minister\r\n\r\nappeared  to be highly optimistic about our  market\r\n\r\nprospects in Western countries, which, according to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister's calculations, are likely to provide\r\n\r\noutlets  for our manufactures. While congratulating\r\n\r\nthe  Minister on striking a note of optimism, I  am\r\n\r\nafraid I cannot share his views with regard to  our\r\n\r\nmarkets. I wonder whether he has been fully briefed\r\n\r\non the difficulties to be encountered while gearing\r\n\r\nour  industrialisation projects to  these  overseas\r\n\r\nmarkets. I am not for a moment being pessimistic or\r\n\r\ncynical,  but I will be failing in my  duty  if  at\r\n\r\nthis juncture I do not pin-point for the Government\r\n\r\nthe drawbacks and the pitfalls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we have to make sure that these\r\n\r\nindustrialised nations would be prepared to provide\r\n\r\nus  with  a share of their local markets.  Further,\r\n\r\neven  if for argument's sake we agree that  we  are\r\n\r\nassured of a certain percentage of their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarkets,  the  Minister  should  remember  that  it\r\n\r\nintroduces    a   new   economic   variable,    The\r\n\r\nfluctuations in the markets of these countries  are\r\n\r\nbound     to    have    repercussions    in     our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme, and hence the ups  and\r\n\r\ndowns in the foreign markets would create jolts and\r\n\r\njerks  in  our  economy. Since these industrialised\r\n\r\nnations  might, or might not, provide  us  with  an\r\n\r\nexpanded  market  in  the long  run,  it  would  be\r\n\r\nadvisable   for  our  officials  in  the   Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board to study the  markets  in  these\r\n\r\ncountries,  the  fluctuations,  the  prospects  for\r\n\r\nSingapore to enter these markets, the short-run and\r\n\r\nthe  long-run  effects, the type of products  which\r\n\r\ncould successfully compete with others in the  long\r\n\r\nrun  etc., etc. Diversification in markets as  well\r\n\r\nas  products has to be made instead of  having  all\r\n\r\neggs  in one basket. Unless a proper study is made,\r\n\r\nall  our  dreams of our economic prosperity  and  a\r\n\r\nsolution  of our unemployment problem are bound  to\r\n\r\nremain in Utopia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An assurance of a certain percentage of the\r\n\r\nmarkets of industrialised countries is unlikely  to\r\n\r\nprovide    a    long-term    solution    to     our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme. The expansion  of  our\r\n\r\npioneer   industries  essentially  depends   on   a\r\n\r\nproportionate  expansion  of  our  markets  abroad.\r\n\r\nHence,  if  these overseas nations  who  might  be\r\n\r\nwilling  at  this juncture to render us  a  helping\r\n\r\nhand by allowing or permitting us to gain access to\r\n\r\ntheir  markets at the initial stage refuse to allow\r\n\r\nus  to make further inroads into their market,  the\r\n\r\nexpansion of industries in Singapore would become a\r\n\r\nremote  possibility, resulting in a  stagnation  in\r\n\r\nour  economy. Thus our industrialisation  programme\r\n\r\nand  a solution to our growing unemployed would not\r\n\r\nbecome  possible in the long run if we  geared  our\r\n\r\neconomic  policies to temporary solutions,  without\r\n\r\ntaking into account the possible impact in the long\r\n\r\nrun.  Further, a change in the political  situation\r\n\r\nin  South-East  Asia and in the strategy  of  these\r\n\r\nnations in this part of the globe might necessitate\r\n\r\na re-orientation in their economic policies towards\r\n\r\nSingapore,  which  in  turn  might  not   be   very\r\n\r\nconducive to our industrialisation programme.  Thus\r\n\r\nI do not think the Finance Minister's statement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  regard to our economic emancipation is likely\r\n\r\nto  be  of  much  practical value to  this  nation,\r\n\r\nunless  he  is  prepared to think in terms  of  the\r\n\r\nshortcomings,  the obstacles, which might  crop  up\r\n\r\nnow and again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to attract foreign entrepreneurs and\r\n\r\nforeign  capital,  and with a view  to  creating  a\r\n\r\nclimate for foreign capital, the Government has not\r\n\r\nonly  provided tax free holidays or pioneer  status\r\n\r\nto  industries but also promised to write  oil  the\r\n\r\ncapital  in  a  matter  of few  years  through  the\r\n\r\nprovision  for heavy depreciation. While  reserving\r\n\r\nmy  comments with regard to this policy,  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether the Honourable Minister has at any time  or\r\n\r\nmoment  considered the measures  essential  to  see\r\n\r\nthat the huge profits are not drained off from  the\r\n\r\neconomy.  If  the return to capital is diverted  to\r\n\r\nforeign countries, there will he no reinvestment on\r\n\r\nexpansion of industries. For the sake of industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion, the excess of profits should be siphoned\r\n\r\noff  and ploughed back into the economy in the form\r\n\r\nof  additional investment. Even though the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister stressed his plans to create a climate for\r\n\r\ninitial  investment, it looks as though he has  not\r\n\r\ngiven  much credence or thought to the idea of  the\r\n\r\nsecond  round of expansion. It would he interesting\r\n\r\nto  know whether the Government has anything up its\r\n\r\nsleeve to make sure that after laying golden  eggs,\r\n\r\nthe  hen  does not carry them back overseas.  Since\r\n\r\nthe  Government  does not supply us  with  relevant\r\n\r\nfigures for Singapore, I can safely assume,  as  in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of Malaysia, that the amount of  profits\r\n\r\nthat  has  been remitted overseas during  the  past\r\n\r\nfive  years from Singapore has far exceeded foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments in this country. If that is the case, I\r\n\r\nam afraid the industrialisation programme might not\r\n\r\nreceive  an  enthusiastic and  unqualified  support\r\n\r\nfrom the population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that wage restraint is the\r\n\r\ncorner-stone  of the Government's industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme. The workers will be only too pleased  to\r\n\r\nmake  any  legitimate sacrifices provided it  would\r\n\r\nput  our  economy on a sound footing. Further,  the\r\n\r\nworking class should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassured  that they are not exploited  in  order  to\r\n\r\nfatten  the  coffers of a handful  of  unscrupulous\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs. It appears to me that wage restraint\r\n\r\nis  a  meaningless empty slogan which is very often\r\n\r\nused  and  abused to make one class in the  economy\r\n\r\nalone  shoulder heavy burdens, inconsistent with  a\r\n\r\nwelfare State. Low wages need not necessarily  mean\r\n\r\nlow  wage  cost  per unit of production.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  keeping the wages low need not  necessarily\r\n\r\nreduce the cost of production or help in any  other\r\n\r\nobjective of our industrialisation programme.  High\r\n\r\ntechnical    efficiency   coupled   with    skilled\r\n\r\nmanagerial  personnel would more effectively  lower\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of  production than  cheap  labour.  The\r\n\r\nUnited   States   products,   for   instance,   are\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  able  to compete in  the  continental\r\n\r\nmarkets  even  though the wages of an average  U.S.\r\n\r\nlabourer  is much higher than that of the  labourer\r\n\r\non  the continent. Thus proper training for skilled\r\n\r\nlabour   and   specialisation  would  more   surely\r\n\r\ncanalise   our  industrialisation  in   the   right\r\n\r\ndirection  than  exploitation of  labour.  Further,\r\n\r\nbelow  standard  wages would adversely  affect  the\r\n\r\nmorale   and   efficiency  of   industrial   labour\r\n\r\nespecially when there is a set pattern in Singapore\r\n\r\ndue  to  the  efficient and effective role  of  the\r\n\r\ntrade union movement. Hence we cannot and we refuse\r\n\r\nto  accept  any  suggestion that  cheap  labour  is\r\n\r\nessential  to  promote  industrialisation  in   our\r\n\r\ncountry.  Let this Socialist Government think  more\r\n\r\nin   terms  of  reducing  wage  cost  per  unit  of\r\n\r\nproduction    through    promotion    of     skill,\r\n\r\nspecialisation  and other economies  of  production\r\n\r\ninstead of repeating the slogans that prevailed  in\r\n\r\na Gladstonian economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is heartening to note that the Government\r\n\r\nintends  to  spend on education $129.2 million  for\r\n\r\nthe  year 1966. It is quite true that we should not\r\n\r\nconsider any investment in human capital a wastage.\r\n\r\nOur   higher  institutes  of  learning,  like   the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Singapore, the Singapore Polytechnic\r\n\r\nand   Nanyang  University,  have  to  provide   the\r\n\r\nnecessary  manpower  to make our  industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme a success. In this connection, our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   has  repeatedly  stated  that  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould produce more men of science and technocrats.\r\n\r\nBut I am\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafraid  that  when,  on the  one  hand,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  frequently  stresses  the  necessity   to\r\n\r\nproduce   more  scientists  and  technicians,   his\r\n\r\nGovernment  officials  (I heard  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture  talk  about his expansion  programme  just\r\n\r\nnow) on the other hand do not know how to make full\r\n\r\nuse of our Science graduates from the Universities.\r\n\r\nThus  you  have  a  sad and sorry spectacle  of  an\r\n\r\nHonours  graduate, who has specialised  in  Nuclear\r\n\r\nphysics, being attached to the Ministry of Culture.\r\n\r\nI  do  not  think the Ministry of Culture  has  any\r\n\r\nintention of manufacturing atomic bombs even though\r\n\r\nit is a pleasure to see that the message carried by\r\n\r\nthe  Mirror,  the official organ of  the  Ministry,\r\n\r\ncontinues   to   radiate   its   powerful   message\r\n\r\nthroughout  Singapore  and Malaysia.  I  understand\r\n\r\nthat  there are two more Science Honours graduates,\r\n\r\none  specialising  in Chemistry and  the  other  in\r\n\r\nnuclear   physics,   attached   to   the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation!  If I am not mistaken, the  investment\r\n\r\nin  a Science graduate is approximately three times\r\n\r\nthat  of  an  Arts graduate. And if we  cannot  tap\r\n\r\ntheir  talents and are only in a position to assign\r\n\r\nthem  jobs which any Arts graduate can do,  then  I\r\n\r\nthink  it would be more economic to close down  the\r\n\r\nScience   Departments  and  concentrate   on   Arts\r\n\r\ngraduates!   Otherwise,   the   Government   should\r\n\r\nnecessarily make use of these men of science in  an\r\n\r\nefficient  and  effective  manner  so  that   their\r\n\r\nassistance    will    be    available    for    our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our education policy should necessarily be\r\n\r\ntailored      to     meet     requirements      for\r\n\r\nindustrialisation.  We should make  sure  that  the\r\n\r\nmanpower  available is utilised in a  manner  where\r\n\r\nthey can give their best. There should be more \r\n\r\nco-ordination not only in policy matters but  also  in\r\n\r\ntheir  implementation. Otherwise we will  be  faced\r\n\r\nwith  a situation where doctors and engineers  will\r\n\r\nbe  attached to the Ministry of Law, scientists  in\r\n\r\nthe  People's Association and Ministry of  Culture,\r\n\r\nlawyers   in   charge   of   boiler   plants,   and\r\n\r\nphilosophers   at   the  helm   of   the   Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board. It is high time our  Ministers\r\n\r\nwoke up from their slumbers and do the needful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A casual glance at the funds allocated to the\r\n\r\nMinistries  for 1966 does indeed convince  me  that\r\n\r\nthe  expenditure  in  the public  sector  is  quite\r\n\r\nsubstantial and that, as far as possible, no  undue\r\n\r\nand  unnecessary  commitments should  be  taken  up\r\n\r\nduring  the course of the coming year. But it  need\r\n\r\nnot necessarily mean that the Government should not\r\n\r\nhonour  its pledge to its employees and treat  them\r\n\r\nwith  contempt the agreement solemnly entered  into\r\n\r\nwith  its  employees who are members of the  Public\r\n\r\nDaily  Rated  Employees' Federation.  I  understand\r\n\r\nfrom the Budget speech and the provisions made  for\r\n\r\ndifferent categories under the Ministries  and  the\r\n\r\nHonourable Minister's reply to the Member for Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah  that  the Government has no  intention  to\r\n\r\nhonour an agreement which was entered into the year\r\n\r\n1961.  Our Minister for Finance has also quoted  F.\r\n\r\nC. Benham. But F. C. Benham has nowhere stated that\r\n\r\nthe  Government as an employer can always toy  with\r\n\r\nthe  idea  of going back on an agreement  which  it\r\n\r\nagreed  to implement. No economist, as a matter  of\r\n\r\nfact,  no human being with an iota of common  sense\r\n\r\nand  fair play, would support a breach of contract.\r\n\r\nToday,  the  Minister has gone  to  the  extent  of\r\n\r\nsuggesting that at no time would the Government  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to revise the emoluments of its employees\r\n\r\nin  such  a manner that it would involve additional\r\n\r\ncommitments  in  the  form of  back  pay.  I  quite\r\n\r\nappreciate  the Minister's capacity and  capability\r\n\r\nin  side-tracking  the issue  with  regard  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  agreement  with  the  P.D.R.E.U.   He\r\n\r\nconveniently forgot to inform the House  that  when\r\n\r\nan agreement was signed in 1961 with the P.D.R.E.U.\r\n\r\nit  was  `current pay' and not `back pay'. But  the\r\n\r\nterms of this agreement were not implemented by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  up to now. Hence today in 1965  it  has\r\n\r\nbecome   `back   pay'.   If  the   Government   had\r\n\r\nimplemented it after the agreement signed in  1961,\r\n\r\nthen  there would be no back pay. But the agreement\r\n\r\nwas  not  implemented by the Government up to  now.\r\n\r\nWhy should the workers -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of clarification, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

The Minister has made a very  poor  case\r\n\r\nto  justify  a  breach  of contract.  In  order  to\r\n\r\njustify  this  undemocratic action, he  has  quoted\r\n\r\nBenham which is quite irrelevant in this particular\r\n\r\ncase.  If  Government as an employer can afford  to\r\n\r\nignore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe terms of a collective agreement, it will not be\r\n\r\na  surprise to me if the private sector too  follow\r\n\r\nthe   footsteps   of  the  Government   and   scrap\r\n\r\ncollective agreements with their respective unions.\r\n\r\nThen  the  N.T.U.C. will not be in  a  position  to\r\n\r\nchampion  the  cause of its workers and  bring  the\r\n\r\nemployers  to book, especially when the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  set  an example to the employers. I  wish  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  instead of devoting his time to  Benham,\r\n\r\ncould  afford to spend a few hours in going through\r\n\r\nthe  terms  and conditions of service enshrined  in\r\n\r\nthe  collective agreements entered into between the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. affiliates and the respective  employers.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  that  will provide him with the  necessary\r\n\r\ncandle-power   for   enlightenment    instead    of\r\n\r\nirrelevant passages from Benham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it will be quite appropriate to quote\r\n\r\nanother passage from Benham which I hope will  open\r\n\r\nthe  eyes  of our Finance Minister who  appears  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  great appreciation of Benham.  Mr  F.  C.\r\n\r\nBenham in his report on revision of salaries in the\r\n\r\npublic  service  states: `... the total  remuneration\r\n\r\nand  conditions of service of government employment\r\n\r\nshould  compare favourably with the net  advantages\r\n\r\nof   private   employment.  They   should   compare\r\n\r\nsufficiently favourably to maintain the standing of\r\n\r\ngovernment  as  a good employer...' Sir,  this  is  a\r\n\r\nReport  on  the Revision of Salaries by Mr  F.  C.\r\n\r\nBenham.  Since Mr Benham is a good friend  of  our\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister,  we insist that  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould serve as a good employer, and that it should\r\n\r\ncompare favourably with the private sector. I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Minister will follow in the footsteps  of  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  which,  by  and  large,  does  not\r\n\r\nbelieve  in  \"breach  of  contract\".  Most  of  the\r\n\r\nemployers in Singapore at least honour the terms of\r\n\r\na  collective  agreement. Will  the  Minister,  who\r\n\r\nconscientiously attempts to identify  himself  with\r\n\r\nBenham,   agree  to  honour  the  1961   collective\r\n\r\nagreement and the recommendations of the subsequent\r\n\r\nCommission  of Inquiry? Or will he at  least  agree\r\n\r\nwith  Mr  Benham that the Government should  be  a\r\n\r\ngood employer and hence consider itself obliged  to\r\n\r\nhonour  the collective agreement? If it  tears  off\r\n\r\ncollective agreements\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  this  fashion, then  the  daily-rated\r\n\r\nemployees are likely to lose faith in any assurance\r\n\r\ngiven  by  the Government, and this development  is\r\n\r\ndefinitely  not going to promote healthy  \r\n\r\nemployer-employee relations between the Government \r\n\r\nand  its employees.  I hope, at this late hour, that \r\n\r\nwisdom will   prevail   and   that  necessary   additional\r\n\r\nprovisions   will  be  made  in   the   Budget   to\r\n\r\naccommodate   justice,  so  that  when   Government\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  attest  their  signatures  to  any\r\n\r\ncollective agreement, it does carry weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I have only to add that the first Budget\r\n\r\nof  an  independent Singapore does present  a  rosy\r\n\r\npicture.

But today and  during\r\n\r\nthe last few days, we see empty benches in front of\r\n\r\nus.  And here I entirely agree with the Member  for\r\n\r\nDelta  that  the people of Singapore will  not  and\r\n\r\nshould not forget the dereliction of duty shown  by\r\n\r\na most irresponsible lot of Members of the opposite\r\n\r\nBench.  Many reasons have been given as to why  the\r\n\r\nOpposition have chickened from the open debate. One\r\n\r\nreason  is probably that during the last few years,\r\n\r\nthey  have  lost out in the open debate. They  have\r\n\r\nclearly  shown their colours; they have shown  that\r\n\r\nthey  never  had  the interests of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore at heart and that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  are not loyal to this country. Their  absence\r\n\r\nhere  during the first Parliament of an independent\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  which important policies  are  being\r\n\r\ndebated is an added testimony to the fact that they\r\n\r\nhave  never  had  the interest  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore at heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some other reasons too, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  but I would only expand on one which  reminds\r\n\r\nme  the story of a fox which has lost its tail. The\r\n\r\nstory  goes  that the fox was trapped and  after  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal of struggle, he managed to escape,  but\r\n\r\nleft  his  tail behind, as a result of which  other\r\n\r\nfoxes  made  fun of him. One day he  had  a  bright\r\n\r\nidea.  He  called all the foxes together  and  told\r\n\r\nthem that a tail was not a nice thing to have, that\r\n\r\nit  was  a  dangerous thing to have,  that  it  was\r\n\r\ndifficult  to keep it clean and that therefore  all\r\n\r\nof  them  should have their tails off. A number  of\r\n\r\nthem were persuaded, but up rose a bright young fox\r\n\r\nwho  said,  \"Will you, Sir, turn round and  let  us\r\n\r\nsee?\" That was the end of the scheme. And so it  is\r\n\r\nwith  the  Barisan. Their leader, having  lost  his\r\n\r\nseat  in the Assembly, is now persuading the  other\r\n\r\nMembers  that the Assembly is not a useful  adjunct\r\n\r\nto  the democratic way of government. Whether there\r\n\r\nwill  be a body as intelligent as the bright  young\r\n\r\nfox  among  the Barisan, only time will tell,  and,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  fortunately  I  am  saved  the\r\n\r\nembarrassment of a monologue on the Budget  by  our\r\n\r\nBack-benchers  who have bravely  stepped  into  the\r\n\r\nbreach. Mr Speaker, Sir, I am wondering whether it\r\n\r\nwould  be possible for you to divide the emoluments\r\n\r\nthat  are  due  to the Members opposite,  who  have\r\n\r\ndisgracefully absented themselves here,  among  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Back-benchers for  carrying  out  their\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is time for me now\r\n\r\nto   summarise  some  of  the  opinions  and  views\r\n\r\nexpressed  by  the Back-benchers on the  Government\r\n\r\nside.  I am glad that they have shown a great  deal\r\n\r\nof interest and have taken time to look through the\r\n\r\nBudget.  The  absence of the Barisan Sosialis  here\r\n\r\ndoes  not make any difference at all to the  Budget\r\n\r\ndebate   because,  from  past  experience,  nothing\r\n\r\nconstructive  has ever come from their  side:  they\r\n\r\nare not constructive people,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  are  destructive, and the opinions that  they\r\n\r\nhave offered here are most sterile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I will take up the suggestion of the\r\n\r\nMember for Punggol with regard to export credit.  I\r\n\r\ndo not know whether Members are aware that at least\r\n\r\nduring   tile   last  few  months,   the   Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board have been assisting exporters  in\r\n\r\nfinancing  the purchase of raw materials for  goods\r\n\r\nordered  and to he exported abroad. The  suggestion\r\n\r\nmade  is  a  good one, and we are now studying  the\r\n\r\nvarious  schemes in different countries to  see  in\r\n\r\nwhat  way they can he adopted here. I am also glad,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  that in putting  forward  this\r\n\r\nsuggestion, the Member for Punggol is also aware of\r\n\r\nthe  abuses that may arise. Also there are  certain\r\n\r\nfactors  existing among our neighbouring  countries\r\n\r\nwhich  make it quite difficult for us to  implement\r\n\r\nsome  export  credit  or  insurance  scheme.  I  am\r\n\r\nreferring  to  the instability of the  currency  in\r\n\r\nsome of our neighbouring countries, but whatever it\r\n\r\nis,   I   have  already  asked  for  an  exhaustive\r\n\r\nexamination  into all the problems  which  must  be\r\n\r\nresolved   before   our   export   trade   can   be\r\n\r\nsubstantially increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what is uppermost in the minds of the trade\r\n\r\nunion Members on our Back Benches is the problem of\r\n\r\nback-pay.  I  would like to remind Members  that  I\r\n\r\nhave  already gone into the reasons why it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible  for Government to encourage back-pay.  My\r\n\r\nfriend the Member for Bras Basah has accused me  of\r\n\r\nbeing  irrelevant  for quoting  Benham.  But  I  am\r\n\r\nwondering  whether  he will  agree  if  I,  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance, back-date revenue  increases\r\n\r\nand  ask  him  for back-payment on his income  tax,\r\n\r\nbecause, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already  made  it\r\n\r\nclear  that  no government can carry out  its  work\r\n\r\nproperly if, at any time, it can be presented  with\r\n\r\na bill for back-pay. It is not the intention of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  penalise the workers  if  delay  in\r\n\r\ncoming to an agreement is the responsibility of the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention was made that delay in coming to an\r\n\r\nagreement on any wage claim is always the fault  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government. It is not always so, because trade\r\n\r\nunions are known also to adopt delaying tactics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform the House that as recently\r\n\r\nas  about  a  fortnight ago, the Arbitration  Court\r\n\r\nhanded down an award to the postal workers, and  it\r\n\r\nwas back-dated to about nine or ten months from the\r\n\r\nday of the award. Therefore, as I have said, we  do\r\n\r\nnot want to encourage the payment of back-pay, but,\r\n\r\nat  the  same  time,  if  we  find  that  there  is\r\n\r\njustification for it, the Government will always be\r\n\r\nreasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the Member for Bras Basah who has\r\n\r\naccused   the  Government  of  not  honouring   its\r\n\r\nagreement with the daily-rated workers.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow whether it is due to a lapse of memory on  his\r\n\r\npart,  or  because  it  is just  to  embarrass  the\r\n\r\nGovernment that he has made his accusation, because\r\n\r\nI  have here before me an extract of the record  of\r\n\r\nthe minutes of the meeting held on 27th July, 1965,\r\n\r\nwith  the  Prime Minister, at which representatives\r\n\r\nof the Public Daily-Rated Unions Federation and the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. were present. I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Claims for fresh revision of wages should be\r\n\r\nregarded  as outside the scope of the Agreement  of\r\n\r\n1961  and  the Union would be at liberty to  submit\r\n\r\nfresh  claims on revision of wages for  negotiation\r\n\r\nafter   settlement   of  the  other   two   issues:\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  and  grievance  procedures  and   job\r\n\r\nevaluation  exercise  of  ten  outstanding   grades\r\n\r\ninvolving about 300 odd employees. In the event  of\r\n\r\nfailure  to  reach  agreement in  the  negotiation,\r\n\r\nconsideration would be given for the claims  to  be\r\n\r\nreferred to arbitration.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Mr Speaker, shows that all outstanding\r\n\r\nissues  have  been  resolved,  and  there   is   an\r\n\r\nagreement  that  any fresh claims would  be  looked\r\n\r\ninto  after  disciplinary and grievance  procedures\r\n\r\nand job evaluation exercise have taken place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, while the Member for Bras Basah\r\n\r\nagrees   with  the  Government's  industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme,  I  think he does not look  with  favour\r\n\r\nupon   what   he  calls  \"huge  profits   made   by\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs\".  I am sure he is  jumping  the  gun\r\n\r\nhere,  because we are just starting and  I  am  not\r\n\r\naware of any pioneer industries that have made huge\r\n\r\nprofits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member went on to the second stage of\r\n\r\nexpansion. We always take one step at a  time,  and\r\n\r\nthis  is where I think the trade unionists  have  a\r\n\r\ngreat  responsibility, and that is,  \"Do  not  look\r\n\r\noptimistic about the profits that are to be made by\r\n\r\nmanufacturers.\" The Member for Bras Basah has  said\r\n\r\nthat  I  am  being  optimistic in  my  estimate  of\r\n\r\nmarkets  abroad. I say that he is being  optimistic\r\n\r\nin   his   estimate  of  profits  to  be  made   by\r\n\r\nmanufacturers, because, as far as I know,  none  of\r\n\r\nthe pioneer industries have paid dividends yet.  As\r\n\r\nregards  his fear that if and when these  companies\r\n\r\ndo  pay  dividends  the profits  will  be  remitted\r\n\r\noverseas,  I  think  my  predecessor  has   already\r\n\r\ninformed  this House last year that more than  half\r\n\r\nof the investments in the pioneer industries are by\r\n\r\nlocal   people;  so  there  is  no  likelihood   of\r\n\r\nremittances being sent abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said just now, the trade\r\n\r\nunionists  have a great responsibility to  shoulder\r\n\r\nin  that  if  we  are  to secure overseas  markets,\r\n\r\nwhether  we are guaranteed a certain percentage  or\r\n\r\nnot, the quality and price of our products must  be\r\n\r\ncompetitive.  And  this is where  our  productivity\r\n\r\ncomes  in.  I would suggest to the trade  unionists\r\n\r\namong our Members here that this is not the time to\r\n\r\nlook backwards but to look forwards and ensure that\r\n\r\nthere  is discipline on the Floor, discipline among\r\n\r\nthe  rank and file, and that the efficiency of  our\r\n\r\nworkers is such that our entrepreneurs will be able\r\n\r\nto  compete, and compete successfully,  in  markets\r\n\r\noverseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Assembly approves the financial policy\r\n\r\nof the Government for the year 1966.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE ARMY BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.14 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a common saying among the Chinese masses\r\n\r\nwhich goes as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[The Minister read the quotation in Mandarin which\r\n\r\nhe then translated into English as follows]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Good men do not become soldiers; good iron does\r\n\r\nnot go into making nails.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This popular Chinese saying originated among the\r\n\r\nChinese folk. The reason for it is not far to seek.\r\n\r\nChina's long history is interspersed with years  of\r\n\r\nviolence.   Then,  as  the  fortunes  of   imperial\r\n\r\ndynasties  declined, ambitious men rose to  contend\r\n\r\nfor mastery over the empire. And it was the fate of\r\n\r\nthe  ordinary  people to provide or  to  be \r\n\r\npress-ganged  into military service for one or the  other\r\n\r\nof  the  contending parties. It is not  surprising,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  that military service  is  not  popular\r\n\r\nwhen  a  soldier risks his life not for his country\r\n\r\nor  for  his people, but for the advantage  of  one\r\n\r\ncontending  group  or  another.  Whoever  wins,  he\r\n\r\nloses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position we are facing in Singapore today is\r\n\r\ncompletely   different  from   that   of   dynastic\r\n\r\nstruggles  of  former imperial China.  Accordingly,\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese saying I have quoted becomes dangerous\r\n\r\nfolly. Our army is to be engaged in the defence  of\r\n\r\nour country and people against external aggression.\r\n\r\nToday  we  are unable to do this task by ourselves.\r\n\r\nIt  is  no use pretending that without the  British\r\n\r\nmilitary  forces  in Singapore  today,  the  island\r\n\r\ncannot  be easily overrun within a matter of  hours\r\n\r\nby  any  neighbouring country within  a  radius  of\r\n\r\n1,000  miles, if any of these countries care to  do\r\n\r\nso.  Everybody  -  and  this includes  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  -  can  see  that at  least  one  of  our\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries does care  to  do  so.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis hope that when this happens,  they\r\n\r\nwould  be  \"top dogs\", or rather I should say  \"top\r\n\r\nrunning  dogs\". So they hoped before 30th September\r\n\r\nthis year!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British military protection today has made quite\r\n\r\na  number of our citizens complacent about the need\r\n\r\nto  conduct  our  own  defence preparations.  These\r\n\r\npeople   assume  that  this  protection   will   be\r\n\r\npermanent.  I regard it as the height of  folly  to\r\n\r\nplan our future on this assumption. And if there is\r\n\r\nany basis on which we, as an independent country,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan plan our future, it will be on the opposite assumption,\r\n\r\nthat is, the removal of the British military preserve at some\r\n\r\ntime in the future.  Nobody - neither we nor the British - can \r\n\r\nsay when this will be. It may be 5, 10 or 15 years - maybe longer,\r\n\r\nmaybe shorter. Whatever the time maybe, it will be useless then \r\n\r\nto think of building up our defence forces. The time to do so \r\n\r\nis now, and the Bill before the House provides for the establishment\r\n\r\nand maintenance of the Singapore Army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the main provisions of the Bill. Part II provides\r\n\r\nfor the establishment of the Army and its Reserve.  Part III provides\r\n\r\nfor the establishment of an Army Board, the Chairman and Members of which\r\n\r\nwill be appointed by the Minister. The Board will be responsible for the \r\n\r\noverall administration and discipline of the Army.  It is empowered, subject\r\n\r\nto appeal to the President, to vary the conditions of service to permit a \r\n\r\nsoldier to extend the term of his commitment or be placed in the Reserve.\r\n\r\nIt may also, with the approval of the President, vary the basis of persons\r\n\r\nto be enlisted in the Army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Bill deals with discipline and provides for punishable offences\r\n\r\nand due execution of the sentences imposed.  Provision is also included for the\r\n\r\nconvening of courts-martial and the appointment of a Judge Advocate - General. \r\n\r\nPart IV is applicable not only to the Army but also to the other Services, such\r\n\r\nas the Navy and the Air Force, if and when they are formed. Now the offences of\r\n\r\nmutiny and sedition in the Armed Forces are punishable with the maximum sentence of\r\n\r\ndeath. Those falsifying statements and documents shall receive a sentence of two years'\r\n\r\nimprisonment.  In order that the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts will not be \r\n\r\ninterfered with, provision is included that a person who is subject to military law\r\n\r\nshall not ordinarily be tried by court-martial for offences such as treason and murder,\r\n\r\nunless the offender was at that time on active military service. Although a court-martial\r\n\r\nmay try person subject to military law for any offence, provision is contained in clause\r\n\r\n63, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nsubclause (2) that the President shall have power to mitigate or remit any sentence passed\r\n\r\nby a court-martial.  Clause 64 provides for the appointment by the President of a person\r\n\r\nin the legal or judicial service with not less than five years' service, or a person\r\n\r\nqualified under the Advocates and Solicitors' Ordinance with not less than five years' \r\n\r\nexperience, as a Judge Advocate-General. The duties of a Judge Advocate-General shall include\r\n\r\nthe appointment of a Judge Advocate at court-martial, and the tendering of advice to the Army Board\r\n\r\non the validity of the findings and sentences of courts martial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is included in Part V of the Bill for the commissioning and promotion of offices by the\r\n\r\nPresident, who is also empowered to cancel commissions. Provision is also included in this Part\r\n\r\nfor the President to grant honourary commissions to suitable persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The qualifications of persons for enlistment and conditions of discharge and transfer to the\r\n\r\nreserves are included in Part VI of the Bill. In brief, a person for enlistment must, among other things,\r\n\r\nsatisfy the qualification of Singapore citizenship. The enlistment or commissioning of others on the\r\n\r\nrecommendation of the Army Board is also provided for in clause 97. A soldier may be discharged on sentence\r\n\r\nby court-martial or by order from the President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VII includes general provisions like summoning of witnesses for courts-martial and the rules of evidence.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of proceedings at courts-martial and the admission or rejection of evidence shall be subject to laws made\r\n\r\nby Parliament. Rules of evidence as adopted at proceedings at courts-martial are the same as those followed in \r\n\r\ncivil courts in Singapore. Other provisions included in Part VII are of a routine nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I speak in support of the Singapore Army Bill introduced by the Hon.Minister\r\n\r\nof Defence. I am not going to touch on the Bill in detail, but I shall touch on matters of general policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI must stress that the building up of a Singapore Army is an absolute necessity. We need to build an army to protect and \r\n\r\ndefend our national integrity and sovereignty because we must always beware of the territorial ambitions of a hungry neighbour\r\n\r\nwhose country is many times bigger than Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is because we are a small country that we must be prepared at all times to meet any emergency. There is an order in an\r\n\r\narmy parade - that is, the order \"On guard\" is occasionally used to test the alertness of the soldiers when a parade is held.  So this\r\n\r\nHouse will fully agree with me that we must be on guard at all times.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Singapore is a small multi-racial nation, I therefore think our army that is to be built should also be multi-racial in character.\r\n\r\nAs I have just mentioned, Singapore is a small island nation. But the very fact that Singapore is a very prosperous nation in which her people\r\n\r\nare enjoying the highest standard of living in South-East Asia is amongst her bigger and stronger neighbours. This may, therefore, tempt her \r\n\r\nbigger and hungry neighbours to try to swallow us up, not only to rob us of our hard-earned wealth, but also of our homes and also with a view\r\n\r\nto enslaving us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure you yourself would not like to be shackled nor put in chains. Further, I think all able young men who have the interests of our\r\n\r\ncountry at heart should choose army life as a career. They can be assured of an interesting and adventurous life in the army. In doing this, we will\r\n\r\nshow to our neighbours that even though we are  a small nation, yet we are not an easy prey for them. We have the determination to ensure our survival\r\n\r\nas an independent and sovereign nation. We mean to keep what we have built and achieved in the past six years, and also to chart a course in which an equal\r\n\r\nand more just, muiti-racial, multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-cultural nation will emerge.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, to those anti-national elements who think they can create trouble in our midst, I have this to say. I think the army is not going to lie or keep\r\n\r\nstill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhile the interests and security of our country are threatened. The army, I am  positive, will deal a strong blow at such elements. So, all in all, I strongly\r\n\r\nurge this House to give its fullest support to the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I rise to support this Bill because our nation needs a national defence based not only on\r\n\r\nequipment but also on people with the spirit of dedication, and a desire to have peace in the Republic of Singapore.  Our Republic must be defended at all costs\r\n\r\nand by all means against our external and internal enemies. They intend to create trouble or invade our country. The responsiblity of the people of the Republic\r\n\r\nof Singapore is to defend their integrity to the last drop of their blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, not only do the Barisan Sosialis have no interest at all to defend the Republic of Singapore, but they intend to surrender our sovereignty to their\r\n\r\nforeign masters, like the Communist Party of Indonesia, with the fate of its leader, Aidit, still unknown. The Barisan Sosialis have acted in an irresponsible manner\r\n\r\ntowards the country. I think there is a small responsiblity on the part of the Barisan Sosialis to carry, and yet they have failed to discharge it. When I say  \r\n\r\n\"small responsiblity\", I mean voicing their arguments in parliamentary debate. What is more, Mr Speaker, we cannot depend on them to defend our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our country has no army, inevitably all our property, including that of Dato David Marshall, will be confiscated and plundered. If our enemies, like the army\r\n\r\nof the P.K.I., were to conquer the Republic of Singapore, there would be no more law or the right of property. Land and propery will be confiscated by our enemy without\r\n\r\ncompensation at all. Dato David Marshall has expressed his anxiety for the right to own property which must be written into the constitution. Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill\r\n\r\nwill safeguard not only land belonging to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDato  David Marshall but also the property  of  all\r\n\r\nthe people of the Republic of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we cannot always depend on our\r\n\r\nneighbour's  soldiers to defend  us,  although  our\r\n\r\nneighbour has given an assurance that it will  help\r\n\r\nus.  We  must  have  second  thoughts.  Because  of\r\n\r\npolitical  developments, we fear that  our  country\r\n\r\nmay  be invaded by enemies. Our neighbour says that\r\n\r\nthey  will  send their troops to defend  us.  Their\r\n\r\ntroops are stationed in Perlis, Penang, Sarawak and\r\n\r\nSabah.  If  we  have  to wait 24  hours  for  their\r\n\r\narrival, our country will be saved. But if we  have\r\n\r\nto   wait  for  one  week,  our  country  wilI   be\r\n\r\ndestroyed,  for when the reinforcements  arrive.  I\r\n\r\nthink they will be of no use to us. Therefore,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the army of the Republic of Singapore\r\n\r\nmust  be  strengthened so that we  can  defend  our\r\n\r\nindependent and sovereign State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this matter of defence is the\r\n\r\nbounden  duty of all of us who owe our  loyalty  to\r\n\r\nthe  country.  We  have  to  defend  not  only  our\r\n\r\nproperty but also to preserve international law and\r\n\r\norder.  On that note, I end my speech. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I rise to support the Singapore  Army\r\n\r\nBill. With Singapore's independence, it becomes the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of our citizens to defend the State.\r\n\r\nThe  British were responsible for our defence,  and\r\n\r\nwe  had no need for an army of our own. But  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  desirable  for us to depend on foreign  forces\r\n\r\nall  the  time. When we were part of Malaysia,  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government  bore  the  responsibility   of\r\n\r\ndefence. But after we were ejected, our defence has\r\n\r\nbecome our own problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last world war, we had known what\r\n\r\nwould happen to a country which depended on foreign\r\n\r\nforces  for  its  defence. In  December  1941,  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  bombed  Singapore.  Although  there  were\r\n\r\n100,000 British troops here, the Japanese were able\r\n\r\nto capture this country in two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonths.  And  now,  two  neighbouring  \r\n\r\ncountries  - Malaysia  and  Indonesia - are not  maintaining  the\r\n\r\nbest of relations with us. Therefore, we should  be\r\n\r\nalert to defend ourselves in all circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Deputy Prime Minister spoke, he referred\r\n\r\nto  the Three Kingdoms of China. We should not face\r\n\r\nsuch  a  situation. There were two racial riots  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and it is our responsibility to maintain\r\n\r\npeace  so  that there is no such repetition.  There\r\n\r\nare  subversive forces which would  like  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout confusion. They have not been eliminated.  If\r\n\r\nwe  have  sufficient security, we will be  able  to\r\n\r\nmanage any situation. The defence of the nation and\r\n\r\nthe maintenance of peace need our own army. That is\r\n\r\nwhy  I  praise  the  Minister who  has  tabled  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Army  Bill. There are  forces  like  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis who propagate that the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore should not join their own army.  When  we\r\n\r\nwere  part  of  Malaysia, when  people  were  being\r\n\r\nenrolled  in  the  security  forces,  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis came out in opposition. At that time,  the\r\n\r\nreason  they gave was that such an army  was  being\r\n\r\nraised to fight Indonesia. Then they were in favour\r\n\r\nof Indonesia. At the same time, the Indonesian Army\r\n\r\nsent  its  agents  into Malaysia and  Singapore  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  subversion and sabotage. When Indonesia\r\n\r\nsought  volunteers  for  West  Irian,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  sent their friends secretly to  Indonesia\r\n\r\nfor  training. After 30th September, there were big\r\n\r\nclashes in Indonesia between the Communists and the\r\n\r\nArmy, and the Barisan Members are now in a state of\r\n\r\nhopeless confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are issuing statements asking the Indonesian\r\n\r\nArmy  not  to strike or work against the Indonesian\r\n\r\nChinese  and the Peking regime. But the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nArmy  is crushing the Chinese in Indonesia.  If  we\r\n\r\nare  going  to  prevent  the Indonesian  Army  from\r\n\r\ncrushing  us  in Singapore, we should establish  an\r\n\r\narmy  and we should support it.
