I,  too,\r\n\r\nwould like to support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, it is very disturbing to read the contents\r\n\r\nof  the  White  Paper and how it would affect  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSo,   I  fully  agree  with  the  comments  made  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to respond in a robust manner,  and  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  indeed  respond  to a threat  which  will  really\r\n\r\nthreaten our national security.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said by many speakers about how\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  ought to respond to this threat  by  groups\r\n\r\nsuch  as the JI.  I do not wish to cover the same grounds\r\n\r\nbecause,  by and large, I agree with all of the  comments\r\n\r\nmade.  But I would like to make a few comments from  just\r\n\r\none single aspect, and that is from my perspective as  an\r\n\r\nemployer and as a corporate citizen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all the speeches made, we can see that it is\r\n\r\nimportant  to  respond to the threat  from  two  somewhat\r\n\r\nopposing ways.  One is that we have to be extra-vigilant.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot  allow potential threats to be  diminished  or\r\n\r\nleft  unchecked.  But, on the other hand, we cannot allow\r\n\r\nourselves  to become overly cautious or overly suspicious\r\n\r\nabout Muslims in general.  Because this would then result\r\n\r\nin a great divide in our society, and our society is just\r\n\r\nnot  about Singapore alone.  It is also about our  Muslim\r\n\r\nneighbours.  So, if we do not approach the issue in a way\r\n\r\nthat  it should be sensibly approached, we can provide  a\r\n\r\nvery fertile soil for extremists to exploit the situation\r\n\r\nand to make political capital out of a very\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsensitive    situation   just    by    simply    alleging\r\n\r\ndiscrimination against a particular racial  or  religious\r\n\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As employers, we face these concerns. We are in a\r\n\r\nmuch more precarious situation compared to the man-in-the-street.   Because when an individual decides to  take  an\r\n\r\noverly  suspicious stance with his Muslim  neighbour,  we\r\n\r\ncan  probably stop at that.  But this is not one man with\r\n\r\ntremendous  irrational  fears.  But  when  employers  and\r\n\r\ncorporates behave that way or have that sort of  feeling,\r\n\r\nthen  the  consequences, indeed, can  be  magnified  many\r\n\r\ntimes over, and it would then not be unreasonable for the\r\n\r\nMuslim   community   to  think  that   they   have   been\r\n\r\ndisenfranchised and marginalised, and for  them  to  feel\r\n\r\ndiscouraged and depressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, as an employer, I would like to call on\r\n\r\nfellow  employers to make that special effort to  ensure,\r\n\r\nand  to be seen to be ensuring, a level playing field  in\r\n\r\nterms   of   employment  and  treatment  of  our   Muslim\r\n\r\ncounterparts.  When the JI paper was first  presented,  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  employer  organisations indeed  came  out  to\r\n\r\naffirm  the  importance of abiding by the  principles  of\r\n\r\nmeritocracy  to  ensure  that job applicants  are  judged\r\n\r\nsolely  based on qualifications, experience and  also  on\r\n\r\nother  objective measures.  This is very important.   Not\r\n\r\nonly  must we be doing this, we must also be seen  to  be\r\n\r\ndoing this.  So our employment processes and our business\r\n\r\ndealings  with  our Muslim counterparts must  be  utterly\r\n\r\ntransparent.  And this is even more important, given  the\r\n\r\nfact  that we have a somewhat high unemployment situation\r\n\r\nwhere we get hundreds of applicants per job, and it is so\r\n\r\neasy  to  cry  foul and allege discrimination  against  a\r\n\r\nparticular grouping.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a practical note, as employers, it would be very\r\n\r\ndifficult for us to sniff out potential terrorists.  From\r\n\r\nthe  profiles of the arrested JI members, it would appear\r\n\r\nthat they are very ordinary folks.  So, it would take  no\r\n\r\nless than the ISD to identify them and to round them  up.\r\n\r\nFrom  a  statistical point of view, we are  also  talking\r\n\r\nabout  small numbers against a very large group of Muslim\r\n\r\ncitizens.  Therefore, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstatistical  chance  of letting a terrorist  through  our\r\n\r\norganisation, I think, is also quite low and remote.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point here is that, on the part of employers,\r\n\r\nthere  is no need to develop elaborate processes to sniff\r\n\r\nout   so-called  potential  terrorists.   But   what   is\r\n\r\nimportant for us to do, as I said earlier on, is to  make\r\n\r\nthat  special  effort to be fair, and to be  seen  to  be\r\n\r\nfair, in our treatment of our Muslim employees.  We  must\r\n\r\nsimply not let the situation get out of hand.  Because if\r\n\r\nwe  do  so,  we  might have to face  up  to  demands  for\r\n\r\npositive discrimination for groups, which feel they  have\r\n\r\nbeen   treated  or  discriminated  against,   for   their\r\n\r\nparticular  problems to be specifically addressed.   This\r\n\r\nis  the  case  in  the  US  when  they  have  legislation\r\n\r\nspecifically  drawn up for minority groups and  also  for\r\n\r\nwomen.   So,  we  do not want legislation to  be  enacted\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is cumbersome, and it is counter-productive.\r\n\r\nBut, as employers, as corporate citizens, we have got  to\r\n\r\npreserve  that right against legislation and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  must do everything we can to be ever mindful that  we\r\n\r\nare seen to be treating our Muslim counterparts as fairly\r\n\r\nas  possible.  Our Muslim community too, on  their  part,\r\n\r\ncan also contribute to this mutual tolerance, respect and\r\n\r\nmoderation,  because we have a collective interest  here.\r\n\r\nWe  have  a collective interest about our well-being  and\r\n\r\nour  national  security.   Together,  we  have  much   to\r\n\r\nachieve, we can triumph.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I too rise in support of the motion  moved\r\n\r\nby the Minister for Home Affairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, as many others before me have done, to\r\n\r\nalso  applaud the Ministry of Home Affairs for initiating\r\n\r\nand  publishing the comprehensive, frank and  penetrating\r\n\r\nWhite   Paper  on  the  historical  existence   and   the\r\n\r\nclandestine  activities of the Jemaah Islamiyah,  leading\r\n\r\nto  the  arrest  of  several of their  members  and  also\r\n\r\nhighlighting  the seriousness of the threat of  terrorism\r\n\r\nSingapore faces.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I am heartened by the fact that what\r\n\r\ninitially  appeared as scepticism among certain  quarters\r\n\r\nin  resurfacing  the Jemaah Islamiyah  issue  by  way  of\r\n\r\ndebating the published White Paper in this House has  now\r\n\r\nturned  into  a  positive and lively  public  debate.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  it  has  created greater  public  awareness  and\r\n\r\nstimulated intense discussion among Singaporeans  of  all\r\n\r\nraces.   What  is important is the fact that Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare  now  more  wary that the threat of  terrorism  is  a\r\n\r\nserious  matter  and driven primarily  by  global  forces\r\n\r\nbeyond   our   shores.   Discussing  and  debating   this\r\n\r\nsensitive issue in such an open manner, both publicly and\r\n\r\nin  this House, again sends the signal to the world  that\r\n\r\nnot  only  are we maturing as a society but also presents\r\n\r\nus  the  opportunity  to desensitise  this  issue,  which\r\n\r\naffects  the  Malay/Muslim  community,  and  consolidates\r\n\r\nSingapore's  fortification against terrorism.   It  helps\r\n\r\nfocus it into a Singaporean problem rather than just that\r\n\r\nof a particular community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the uncovering of the JI's clandestine\r\n\r\nactivities, the Government has taken many firm steps such\r\n\r\nas   implementing  defensive  security  measures  at  key\r\n\r\ninstallations   and  buildings,  and  tightening   border\r\n\r\ncontrols.   Recognising  that  terrorism  world-wide   is\r\n\r\nfunded  by  money-laundering operations,  Parliament  has\r\n\r\nalso  given the mandate to criminalise terrorist  funding\r\n\r\nand  that  this new law is coming into effect later  this\r\n\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe this is integral in the wide range of\r\n\r\ninitiatives  being  taken to combat terrorism.   Policing\r\n\r\nand  crippling the flow of funds to and from illegitimate\r\n\r\nsources  is necessary to prevent another potential  Bali-like  incident  where the terrorists feel  pressured  and\r\n\r\nwere compelled to do something, because the funds were in\r\n\r\ntheir  hands  to conduct such extremist acts.   In  these\r\n\r\naspects,  we  must  remain at least one but,  preferably,\r\n\r\nseveral steps ahead of the terrorists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, owing to the distinctive religious\r\n\r\ndimension  in today's terrorism, tackling this danger  by\r\n\r\nmeans   of  just  defensive  security  measures  is   not\r\n\r\nadequate.    A   more   holistic  dual   track   approach\r\n\r\nencompassing hard and soft measures is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnecessary  to achieve overall effectiveness  in  stamping\r\n\r\nout  terrorism.  According to terrorism expert, Dr  Bruce\r\n\r\nHoffman,   the   defeating  of  the   Al-Qaeda   requires\r\n\r\npinpointing the \"inner logic\" that \"motivates  terrorists\r\n\r\nand animates terrorism\".  The same holds true for the  JI\r\n\r\nand   other  religiously-driven  extremist  and  militant\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the JI issue afflicts the Muslim community, it\r\n\r\nis  encouraging to note that the Malay/Muslim  community,\r\n\r\nreligious  and mosque leaders have come out  strongly  in\r\n\r\nsupport of the White Paper and condemning the JI and  its\r\n\r\nextremist agenda, and also acknowledging that such groups\r\n\r\nare  a  menace to our society.  Many measures  have  also\r\n\r\nbeen  proposed to check and prevent the emergence of such\r\n\r\ngroups again in the future.  Measures ranging from taking\r\n\r\nstock  of  the curriculum of Islamic religious education,\r\n\r\nregistering  qualified asatizahs, or religious  teachers,\r\n\r\nto  sanctioning  foreign  religious  speakers  have  been\r\n\r\nmentioned  by  the Minister-in-charge of  Muslim  Affairs\r\n\r\nyesterday, and also by several of my Malay colleagues  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  who have spoken earlier.  These  are  either\r\n\r\nalready implemented or are being seriously considered for\r\n\r\nimplementation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, while such measures are necessary and\r\n\r\nimportant, I believe that the long run measure should  be\r\n\r\nto  ensure that the Muslim community is equipped  with  a\r\n\r\nsound  and  rational knowledge of Islam  as  well  as  an\r\n\r\nappreciation of the other major religions in our country,\r\n\r\nin  consideration of the multi-racial and multi-religious\r\n\r\ncontext within which we all live.  A proper knowledge  of\r\n\r\nIslam  will  help in preventing the infection of  deviant\r\n\r\nideas from taking root among Muslims here.  Knowledge  of\r\n\r\nother religions would help in enhancing the understanding\r\n\r\nand  the preservation of harmony among the various racial\r\n\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Sundays ago, my constituency's IRCC organised a\r\n\r\nvisit  to the various places of worship within the  Pasir\r\n\r\nRis area.  We started with the Pentacost Methodist Church\r\n\r\nwhere, after a briefing of the history of the church  and\r\n\r\nits activities, we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwere  invited to join in the service.  I was subsequently\r\n\r\nsurprised   in   being  called  upon   to   address   the\r\n\r\ncongregation  and was later told that  I  was  the  first\r\n\r\nMuslim  to have done so.  I told them that singing  hymns\r\n\r\nand saying the Lord's prayer was nothing new to me, as  I\r\n\r\nattended Presbyterian High, a missionary school during my\r\n\r\nsecondary  school days, and yet I am still  very  much  a\r\n\r\nMuslim today.  We all laughed through it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, in May, while being in the United States,\r\n\r\nI  had  the  opportunity to join in a community gathering\r\n\r\nnear  the  hotel where I was put up.  A pastor generously\r\n\r\napproached  a black Muslim attendee to start the  meeting\r\n\r\nwith  a prayer.  He graciously replied by requesting  the\r\n\r\npastor  to  open with the Lord's prayer.   After  several\r\n\r\nenthusiastic  echoes  of  \"Amen\"  from  all,  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  leader lamented that this too was no different\r\n\r\nfrom   the  prayer  of  Muslims!   It  is  apparent  that\r\n\r\ncommunities,  wherever they now live in  the  world,  are\r\n\r\ngenerally   making  efforts  to  bridge   the   gaps   of\r\n\r\nunderstanding   between  Muslims  and  non-Muslims,   and\r\n\r\nespecially so since after the 9/11 unfortunate  event  in\r\n\r\n2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Chinese majority non-Muslims, whether Buddhists,\r\n\r\nChristians or Taoists, should also reciprocate by  making\r\n\r\nan  effort  to understand and know more about true  Islam\r\n\r\nwhich  is  truly  a  religion of  peace,  but  which  has\r\n\r\nregrettably  been subjected to extreme misinterpretations\r\n\r\nby   irresponsible  Muslims  and  non-Muslims  to  wholly\r\n\r\nadvance their personal agenda.  The Minister-in-charge of\r\n\r\nMuslim  Affairs,  Dr  Yaacob, again  yesterday  and  also\r\n\r\nseveral   other  Malay  colleagues  of  mine   have   all\r\n\r\nelaborated  on  the subject of Islam at length  in  their\r\n\r\nspeeches in this House over the last two days.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank all my non-Muslim colleagues\r\n\r\nwho  have spoken so eloquently in support of the need for\r\n\r\nand  the  benefit of more public education on the various\r\n\r\nreligious  and  cultural practices of the  racial  groups\r\n\r\nhere  and  also the need to strengthen the links  between\r\n\r\nour key ethnic groups.  Only through such initiatives and\r\n\r\nconcerted action of greater\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommunication  and involvement with each other  could  we\r\n\r\nachieve  better  understanding, which  would  lead  to  a\r\n\r\nstronger  bond  and  trust between  the  major  races  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We should capitalise on the current  positive\r\n\r\nmood   and   push  for  attitudinal  change   among   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, Muslims or non-Muslims, to take  the  issue\r\n\r\nof  strengthening  harmony and  social  integration  more\r\n\r\nseriously than ever.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the concern of potential discrimination\r\n\r\nat the workplace, it is heartening that there is a strong\r\n\r\ncall  among  workers of different races and religions  to\r\n\r\nuphold the principle of meritocracy.  I also applaud  the\r\n\r\neffort   of   NTUC,  the  Singapore  National  Employers'\r\n\r\nFederation  and  the  Singapore  Business  Federation  to\r\n\r\njointly   craft   a   'code  of  responsible   employment\r\n\r\npractices'  which  recommended, among  others,  to  adopt\r\n\r\nconsistent   and   objective   selection   criteria   for\r\n\r\nemployment   and   to  avoid  discriminatory   rules   in\r\n\r\nconsidering promotion and advancement opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to call upon employers of large and\r\n\r\nsmall companies, MNCs or local SMEs, as Mrs Fang Ai  Lian\r\n\r\nhas  also done so a moment ago, to continue to adopt such\r\n\r\nfair  and  equal opportunity employment practices  as  we\r\n\r\nhave   done  so  all  this  while.   Discriminating   and\r\n\r\nsidelining  Malay/Muslims in jobs if they  could  perform\r\n\r\njust  as  well as any other Singaporean would  not  augur\r\n\r\nwell for our society.  As Dr Yaacob, Dr Wang Kai Yuen and\r\n\r\nseveral  others have pointed out, many Malay Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave  been  performing  better and excelling  in  various\r\n\r\nfields.  Unless equal opportunities - and I would like to\r\n\r\nstress here, equal opportunities on the basis of our time-tested  meritocratic principles are created for  them  to\r\n\r\nprogress  alongside other Singaporeans  -  the  community\r\n\r\nwill  be  denied  of  role  models  to  catalyse  further\r\n\r\nprogress.   It  is  a  known  fact  that  societies   and\r\n\r\ncommunities  blessed with successful role models  develop\r\n\r\ngreater confidence to undertake more difficult challenges\r\n\r\nin every facet of life and tend to progress faster.  When\r\n\r\nthis happens, the entire\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsociety  benefits from it.  As the saying  goes,  success\r\n\r\nbreeds success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, it has to be borne in mind that a\r\n\r\nMalay community which is discriminated against and denied\r\n\r\nof  opportunities, in spite of putting in  best  efforts,\r\n\r\nwill  degenerate  and turn into a disgruntled  community.\r\n\r\nOver time, if not managed, an underclass, in the sense of\r\n\r\ngroups  who  have  lost  all hope and  dropped  out  from\r\n\r\nSingapore's mainstream society, will emerge.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink I need to describe what such a scenario would  mean\r\n\r\nto Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the Government would never allow the\r\n\r\nemergence of an underclass in our country.  But  I  think\r\n\r\nit  is  important that we bring this perspective  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext of the current discussion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Dr Wang Kai Yuen's speech in this House\r\n\r\nyesterday, he noted that many Muslims could not reconcile\r\n\r\nthemselves that the JI members are bad Muslims  and  were\r\n\r\njust  carrying out their Muslim duties when  they  joined\r\n\r\nthe JI organisation in defence of Islam.  As a matter  of\r\n\r\nfurther clarification, Sir, it is important to note  that\r\n\r\nthe  JI  members were well aware of what they were  going\r\n\r\ninto  when they decided to be a part of the JI.  As noted\r\n\r\nin  the  White Paper, they were willing participants  and\r\n\r\nwell  immersed  in extremist activities long  before  the\r\n\r\nSeptember  11  incident  and  their  subsequent  arrests.\r\n\r\nTheir plans to attack targets in Singapore go back to the\r\n\r\nmid-1990s  and  intensified  after  September  11,  2001.\r\n\r\nConsidering also the above-average education that most of\r\n\r\nthe   JI  detainees  have,  it  is  imperative  for   our\r\n\r\nSingaporean Muslims to know and are convinced that the JI\r\n\r\nmembers know exactly what they were getting into and  the\r\n\r\npotential  devastation  they would  have  caused,  should\r\n\r\ntheir plans be successfully executed.   Both Muslims  and\r\n\r\nnon-Muslims  would have been victims of their  aggressive\r\n\r\nacts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, while the White Paper focuses on\r\n\r\nthe  JI  perpetrating terrorism under the  cloak  of  the\r\n\r\nIslamic  faith,  it  must also  be  borne  in  mind  that\r\n\r\nterrorism is,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nby  no  means,  bounded by religion.  The  Oklahama  City\r\n\r\nbombing  by Timothy McVeigh and the sarin gas  attack  in\r\n\r\nunderground  subways by the Aum cult in  Japan  are  some\r\n\r\nterror  acts  that  come to mind.  As such,  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmust  always  be on guard against not only religious  but\r\n\r\nalso other forms of extremism to help the Government and,\r\n\r\nfor  that matter, ourselves, as Singaporeans, to  protect\r\n\r\nlives and property, and preserve the inter-ethnic harmony\r\n\r\nthat  we have painstakingly built since our independence.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the White Paper is apt in reminding  us\r\n\r\nthat,  given the nature of the terrorist threat  we  face\r\n\r\ntoday,  preservation of harmony is paramount to  ensuring\r\n\r\nSingapore's continued well-being.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Thank you, Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker,  Sir,  for letting  me  speak.   Today's\r\n\r\ndebate  is  important because we are discussing  a  topic\r\n\r\nthat  has affected and will continue to affect the  lives\r\n\r\nof all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 30-odd years, we have enjoyed peace and\r\n\r\nprosperity.  Then came September 11 which shook the whole\r\n\r\nworld.  To many Singaporeans, this tragedy opens the eyes\r\n\r\nof  many to the dangers that could fall upon them.   This\r\n\r\nfear  was confirmed when we discovered a terrorist  group\r\n\r\nand  arrested  15 members of this radical Islamic  group,\r\n\r\nJemaah  Islamiyah,  in  December  2001.   They  had  very\r\n\r\nsinister motives, including bombings of foreign embassies\r\n\r\nand even local targets, like Yishun MRT Station.  Then in\r\n\r\nAugust 2002, ISD arrested another 21 persons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the message is very clear.\r\n\r\nWe  better  get  to understand and expose  the  terrorist\r\n\r\nnetwork and the dangers they pose before our citizens get\r\n\r\nhurt  or  killed.   Judging from  the  information  being\r\n\r\ncovered  and linking this with other countries' findings,\r\n\r\nthis is going to last a very, very long time.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthis  White  Paper is timely.  Because  of  the  in-depth\r\n\r\ndiscussion  on  the terrorist operations and  the  people\r\n\r\ninvolved,  this White Paper is a must read  for  all  who\r\n\r\ncherish  this place.  It provides an important source  of\r\n\r\ninformation  and  understanding for the average  citizen,\r\n\r\nwho must know, by now,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhow  close we were to tragic happenings of the kind  seen\r\n\r\nat  Bali where more than 200 lives were lost.  They  will\r\n\r\nbetter  appreciate why we took such swift actions against\r\n\r\nthese anti-national elements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth of the matter is that the terrorists are\r\n\r\nat  our doorsteps.  We must do our utmost to prevent them\r\n\r\nfrom  spreading  their network, and this is  where  every\r\n\r\ncitizen  counts in our approach to block, frustrate,  and\r\n\r\nto   check  their  activities  and  movements.   We  must\r\n\r\nremember  our  security is under attack, and  unless  our\r\n\r\ncitizens show their determination and resolve to  protect\r\n\r\nwhat  we  have  built up over the years,  we  may  suffer\r\n\r\nsevere damages to lives and targets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper showed clearly the targets these\r\n\r\npeople  are gunning - MRT stations, shopping and  crowded\r\n\r\nplaces,  places  of  worship,  airports,  and  many  soft\r\n\r\ntargets  - where civilian casualties will be high.   They\r\n\r\nare not worried about killing Muslims, Christians, Hindus\r\n\r\nand  foreigners.  To them the ideology comes first.  They\r\n\r\nwant  to  create  chaos  - security,  racial,  religious,\r\n\r\nsocial and economic chaos - preventing investors to come,\r\n\r\nand  disrupting  and  destroying the  infrastructures  we\r\n\r\nbuilt.   This  is a national issue.  And all  races  must\r\n\r\nband  together  and not let these anti-national  elements\r\n\r\nbreak  us  apart.  We have come this far through  working\r\n\r\ntogether  and  enjoying the benefits of  strong  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth,  good education, medical care, good housing,  and\r\n\r\nsecurity.  We walk the streets safely.  Do not let  these\r\n\r\nbe  taken  away.  These are all worth fighting  for,  and\r\n\r\ndying  for.  We must not give these up easily by allowing\r\n\r\nthese people to throw a spanner into our society and make\r\n\r\nour  Chinese  and Indian communities distrust  the  Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity, just because they happen to embrace Islam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The media, television, radio and newspapers have put\r\n\r\nMuslims in the limelight because of events like September\r\n\r\n11,  and the carnage at Bali.  Our Malay community, being\r\n\r\nMuslims,  have been drawn into this.  Moreover, of  late,\r\n\r\nour  Malays have become more pious and religious.   Their\r\n\r\ndressing and social behaviour have also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchanged.    There  is  nothing  wrong  in  being   pious.\r\n\r\nHowever,  these changes and trends have made the  Chinese\r\n\r\nand  Indians colour their attitudes towards them.   I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  this is racial in nature.  I  blame  this  on\r\n\r\nhuman  nature's  association  of  thoughts,  trends   and\r\n\r\nevents, that have made them feel this way.  I think  this\r\n\r\nattititudinal change happens everywhere.  We have seen it\r\n\r\nhappening  in the United States, Australia, Britain,  and\r\n\r\neven  in Belgium in a place called Antwerp.  But we  must\r\n\r\ntake  swift  action not to allow this  to  sow  seeds  of\r\n\r\ndistrust.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years since independence, at the ground\r\n\r\nlevel, each community has contributed to the closely-knit\r\n\r\nsociety of multi-racial living and that probably helps  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal during such trying times.  However,  we  must\r\n\r\nnever take things for granted.  We must move forward  and\r\n\r\ncontinue to work on this foundation, reinforcing the need\r\n\r\nto  live together harmoniously, and giving assurances and\r\n\r\nwords of comfort to each community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the many statements of support from the Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity,  especially outsiders,  help  to  give  strong\r\n\r\nsignals of assurances to the non-Muslim communities, that\r\n\r\nthe JI is the work of a minority of Muslims, and that the\r\n\r\nmajority  of Malays are against their actions and  wrong-doings.    Moderate  Malay  leaders  must  not  let   the\r\n\r\nextremist  minority call the agenda.   Non-Muslims  watch\r\n\r\nthe  reactions of our Malay community towards this  White\r\n\r\nPaper  because non-Muslims want assurances, and investors\r\n\r\nalso  want  assurances.  Yesterday, my  colleague,  Ahmad\r\n\r\nKhalis,  told  this  House  that  more  than  127   Malay\r\n\r\norganisations  have  openly  come  out  to  support   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's action and condemned the JI.   This  is  the\r\n\r\nmost  significant  stand and speaks well  for  the  Malay\r\n\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when I read the headline article on 14th January,\r\n\r\n\"Let's  All  Back JI White Paper - Urges  the  leader  of\r\n\r\nKhatijah  Mosque\", I see it as a good and  clear  signal.\r\n\r\nOther  organisations, like Pergas, the Singapore  Islamic\r\n\r\nScholars and Religious Teachers Association, have come\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nout  in  support.   The  latest MUIS'  statement  on  the\r\n\r\ncorrect  practice  of  Muslims is most  welcomed.   This,\r\n\r\ncoupled  with  my  Malay parliamentary colleagues'  press\r\n\r\nstatement,  condemning the JI and its  extremist  agenda,\r\n\r\naugurs well for all of us, especially the non-Muslims and\r\n\r\nthose who want to invest here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Muslims need these kinds of assurances, that the\r\n\r\nJI  is an extreme group rejected by the community, and to\r\n\r\ndispel  the misconception that Islam is the cause of  the\r\n\r\nproblem.  In fact, my MP colleague, Ahmad Khalis, made  a\r\n\r\ngood   and   spirited  speech,  to  respond  to  concerns\r\n\r\nexpressed  by some quarters, including views by Ayatollah\r\n\r\nKhomeini  in  1984 and philosopher Rogers  Scruton,  that\r\n\r\nIslam  does  not mean peace.  It is important  that  such\r\n\r\nviews be challenged, so that Muslims and non-Muslims will\r\n\r\nnot support these serious charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper highlighted that many of the JI\r\n\r\nmembers learned their radical views from foreigners.   So\r\n\r\nwhen the Straits Times on 17th January reported that some\r\n\r\nmosques  regularly  invited PAS  politician-cum-religious\r\n\r\nleaders to preach at the mosques, I was shocked.  PAS  is\r\n\r\na  political  party  in Malaysia, advocating  an  Islamic\r\n\r\nstate.   They control two states in Malaysia -  Trengganu\r\n\r\nand  Kelantan - under Islamic rule.  Their brand of Islam\r\n\r\nis  too  extreme.  They are proposing hudud laws.   I  am\r\n\r\nagainst intolerance to other religions.  In Singapore, we\r\n\r\nhave  separated politics and religion.  So,  how  can  we\r\n\r\nallow  such  religious teachers, with a strong  political\r\n\r\nstand  of  creating  an  Islamic state  in  Malaysia,  be\r\n\r\nallowed to preach and advise?  I think the mosque leaders\r\n\r\nare too naive to believe that giving them a list of \"do's\r\n\r\nand don'ts\" would stop them from preaching their brand of\r\n\r\nIslam.   Their  very  presence is a show  of  acceptance.\r\n\r\nThis  mixing  of politics and religion, and  sending  the\r\n\r\nwrong  signals  to  non-Muslims  and  Muslims,  is   very\r\n\r\ndiscomforting  and not reassuring.  You are  giving  them\r\n\r\nspace and, worse still, credibility, to preach under  the\r\n\r\nguise of piety and religion.  The mosque leaders must  be\r\n\r\naware  of  the  sensitivities of the  other  communities,\r\n\r\nespecially in the light\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  the  present circumstances.  The vetting  of  foreign\r\n\r\nreligious  leaders, be they Muslims, Christians,  Hindus,\r\n\r\nmust  be  careful and discriminating.  In a  multi-racial\r\n\r\nand  multi-religious  society, the  use  of  religion  in\r\n\r\nfestering dissent and discord is serious because religion\r\n\r\nevokes emotion and passion, and is beyond reasoning.   We\r\n\r\nmust avoid this at all costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past two days of debate brought into focus the\r\n\r\nquestion: are Malays being marginalised in a meritocratic\r\n\r\nsociety?  The article \"From the Gallery\" by Tan Tarn  How\r\n\r\ngives  a broad coverage to this issue.  A community  that\r\n\r\nis  marginalised  because of race and  religious  beliefs\r\n\r\nworks  against  the  interest of a  multi-racial,  multi-religious  society,  and  this  is  exactly  what   these\r\n\r\nextremist  groups want to see it happen.  So, if  we,  as\r\n\r\nleaders,  and the press, push this line of argument  that\r\n\r\nthe Malays are marginalised, then we are playing into the\r\n\r\nhands of the JI.  The Prime Minister had given figures on\r\n\r\nthe  improved  performances of Malay  students  over  the\r\n\r\nyears.   Dr  Wang  Kai Yuen restated  it  yesterday.   Mr\r\n\r\nYatiman   Yusof  and  Mr  Zainudin  Nordin  rejected   Mr\r\n\r\nShanmugam's call for some form of affirmative action  for\r\n\r\nMalays.   They  do  not want symbolic icons  of  success.\r\n\r\nThey want to be at the top on their own merit.  They have\r\n\r\ncome  this  far  on their own; so there is  no  need  for\r\n\r\nspecial treatment.  They do not want to devalue the Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity's position in society.  So, let us  be  on  our\r\n\r\nguard  -  affirmative action is potentially divisive  and\r\n\r\nhas other undesirable consequences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are under the watchful eyes of the JI. So, every\r\n\r\npossible  avenue must be closed to them because JI  comes\r\n\r\nin many guises and forms.  We must not give them space to\r\n\r\noperate.   Their teachings must be challenged, and  their\r\n\r\nwrong-doings  exposed.  Singaporeans  of  all  races  who\r\n\r\nbelieve in peace and prosperity must call the agenda, and\r\n\r\nwork out a strategy to stop this.  This strategy involves\r\n\r\nthe  strengthening of our security at every level of  our\r\n\r\nsociety.  In other words, every citizen must be on  their\r\n\r\nguard  to report any suspicious activity or personnel  to\r\n\r\nthe authorities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of the Chinese and Indians, attitudes of\r\n\r\nprejudice  must  give  way to one  of  understanding  the\r\n\r\ntrauma  that our Malays are going through.   If  we  seek\r\n\r\nassurances  from the Malays, we, especially the  Chinese,\r\n\r\nmust  give them the assurances that there will be no  job\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  against Malays as this  is  happening  in\r\n\r\nsome firms.  To do likewise, is to play into the hands of\r\n\r\nJI.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we can overcome, if each and every\r\n\r\nSingaporean understands the threat posed by  the  JI  and\r\n\r\nacts  as a lookout post for our security men.  This vital\r\n\r\ncooperation will make whoever wants to take on us,  think\r\n\r\ntwice, before trying.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this White Paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc.

I\r\n\r\nwould  just  like to clarify a point that he has  raised,\r\n\r\nbecause I think it is useful to clarify in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speakers that were invited by the mosques, go\r\n\r\nthrough  the  vetting  process  and  they  have  to   get\r\n\r\nclearance from MUIS.  The speakers that were featured  in\r\n\r\nthe article were speakers who were invited by the mosques\r\n\r\nlong  before they became PAS members.  They were  invited\r\n\r\nin  their  own right as religious teachers.   But  having\r\n\r\nsaid  that,  Sir, I would just like to assure  the  House\r\n\r\nthat we will step up our measures to ensure that whatever\r\n\r\nthey  do in Singapore, we will monitor very, very closely\r\n\r\nin  terms of what they do and what they say.  So far,  we\r\n\r\nhave not had any incidents, especially with this group of\r\n\r\nspeakers, in terms of the views that they have presented.\r\n\r\nBut, we have also in the past, rejected permission sought\r\n\r\nby  some  mosques to invite some of the foreign speakers.\r\n\r\nSo, I would like to assure the House that the process  is\r\n\r\nin place, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Ser Miang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join  in  this\r\n\r\ndebate.  During\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  last 12 months, I visited countries in Asia,  Europe\r\n\r\nand  the Americas on various assignments.  Every  time  I\r\n\r\nwent  through an airport, the strict, and sometimes over-zealous   security   checks  and  stringent   immigration\r\n\r\nprocedures, served as a constant reminder to  the  threat\r\n\r\nof  international terrorism, and the threat is real,  and\r\n\r\ncountries around the world are dealing with it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrest of the 15 JI members in December 2001\r\n\r\nshocked us.  And, this White Paper forced many of  us  to\r\n\r\ntake cognisance that the threat is nearer to home than we\r\n\r\nwould  have otherwise thought.  Our Government is  taking\r\n\r\nthis  threat seriously and is dealing with it.  And,  now\r\n\r\nit  is  up to us Singaporeans to recognise the issues  on\r\n\r\nhand, and to work together and to support our Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> have spoken eloquently in support of\r\n\r\nthis  motion.   I  would  like  to  add  two  points  for\r\n\r\nconsideration.  In addition to the recommendation in  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  on strengthening social cohesion,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to suggest that sports can play an important role in\r\n\r\ncommunity  bonding  and  nation  building.   Sports   cut\r\n\r\nthrough  barriers of race and religion.  No  matter  what\r\n\r\nlevel  of sports that you play or take part in, there  is\r\n\r\nno  discrimination against Muslims, non-Muslims, Chinese,\r\n\r\nIndians, or Malays.  In sports, one set of rules  applies\r\n\r\nto  everyone, no matter what is the colour of your  skin,\r\n\r\nhair,  eyes  or your beliefs.  Through sports,  we  build\r\n\r\nfriendship  and  strong bonding afterwards.   During  the\r\n\r\nAsian   Games  and  the  Commonwealth  Games  last  year,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, regardless of race and religion cheered our\r\n\r\nchampions,  whether it was Li Jiawei,  our  table  tennis\r\n\r\nchampion, or Abdul Halim bin Haron and Ibrahim Sihat, our\r\n\r\nweightlifting  champions,  or  Remy  Ong,   our   bowling\r\n\r\nchampion.   We  cheered as one, and  we  cheered  as  one\r\n\r\nnation.  Whenever our football team played, thousands  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans went to support them.  When our team lost or\r\n\r\nplayed  badly,  we  felt  disappointed,  frustrated   and\r\n\r\nsometimes even angry when they were trounced.   But  when\r\n\r\nthey\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntriumphed or showed courage and real fighting spirit,  we\r\n\r\ncheered  as  one  and  we  felt  proud  as  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nPlayers  or supporters - we are one - regardless of  race\r\n\r\nand religion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday morning, I hosted a breakfast for my\r\n\r\ncolleague  from the International Olympic  Committee,  Mr\r\n\r\nKip Keino.  Mr Keino is a two-time Olympic gold medallist\r\n\r\nand  a  two-time Olympic silver medallist  and  he  is  a\r\n\r\nlegendary runner from Kenya.  Mr Keino reminded  me  that\r\n\r\nsports  is  a  unifying force that unites  a  nation  and\r\n\r\npromotes peace and harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point I would like to raise is one\r\n\r\non  employment  of Singaporeans.  A number  of  our  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers   have   touched  on  the  code  of   responsible\r\n\r\nemployment  practices that was set  up  together  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Business  Federation  and   NTUC.    In   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of this code, it states, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore's society is multi-racial, multi-cultural\r\n\r\nand   multi-religious.   Employers  and  employees   must\r\n\r\nappreciate  the  diversity  of  the  workforce  and  work\r\n\r\ntogether  in harmony.  Employers should treat  all  staff\r\n\r\nfairly  and continue to recruit, based on skills, merits,\r\n\r\nexperience, capability and relevant job experience.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support this code of practices. My\r\n\r\nexperience in running a group of companies with more than\r\n\r\n2,000  employees has taught me that the best  recruitment\r\n\r\npolicy is one based on meritocracy.  For companies to run\r\n\r\nefficiently and provide the best services or produce  the\r\n\r\nbest  products,  make a good return to  the  company  and\r\n\r\nshareholders so that there will be job security for  each\r\n\r\nand every employee, everyone in the company has a part to\r\n\r\nplay  and every employee has to be qualified and  is  the\r\n\r\nbest  person for the job.  This is especially so  in  the\r\n\r\nincreasing  competitive environment, whether  locally  or\r\n\r\ninternationally.  Sound and viable companies provide jobs\r\n\r\nand  security  and  contribute to social  stability.   We\r\n\r\nshould,  therefore, continue to uphold the  principle  of\r\n\r\nmeritocracy  and at the same time, there should  not  be,\r\n\r\nand we cannot allow, discriminatory practices against any\r\n\r\nemployee that is based on race and religion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore's context, I believe that most of the\r\n\r\nemployers are fair-minded\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand   professional.    For   those   few   who   practise\r\n\r\ndiscrimination,  I  think they  should  be  educated  and\r\n\r\ncorrected.   The Singapore Business Federation  and  NTUC\r\n\r\nwill have a big role to play in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during this period of economic uncertainty, we\r\n\r\nshould continue to concentrate on education, training and\r\n\r\nskill development, so that each and every Singaporean  is\r\n\r\nemployable and has a bright future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, thank you for allowing me to join  in  the\r\n\r\ndebate on this very important matter facing us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the issues before us are multi-faceted. On\r\n\r\nthe  one  hand,  we are facing a serious  threat  to  our\r\n\r\ninternal security.  On the other hand, we are faced  with\r\n\r\nthe  philosophical  issue  of  religion  and  religiosity\r\n\r\namidst  rising  global  religious  revivalism.   Yet,  on\r\n\r\nanother front we are challenged to ensure that our social\r\n\r\ncohesion remains strong and intact.  All these, with  the\r\n\r\nbackground   of  increased  globalisation  and   economic\r\n\r\nuncertainty,  certainly  not  the  best  of  times,   but\r\n\r\npersevere  we must, to ensure the continued  survival  of\r\n\r\nthe generations to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge for speakers on the last day of such a\r\n\r\ndebate is always to say what has not already been said  - it  is indeed a challenge.  Much has been said about  the\r\n\r\ndamage  that  terrorist acts will do to any society.   We\r\n\r\nhave  seen the devastation of the irresponsible  acts  of\r\n\r\nSeptember 11 and October 12, not to mention the many more\r\n\r\nby  Al-Qaeda  and the JI.  Sir, the extent  of  terrorist\r\n\r\nacts  that have been linked to the JI has been documented\r\n\r\nin a report entitled, \"Indonesia's Terrorist Network: How\r\n\r\nJemaah  Islamiyah  Works\", prepared by the  International\r\n\r\nCrisis  Group (ICG).  For example, the report linked  the\r\n\r\nChristmas Eve bombings of December 2000 to JI, noting the\r\n\r\nimpressive planning and coordination work that took place\r\n\r\nin the attack.  It reported that the network ensured that\r\n\r\nbombs were delivered on Christmas Eve 2000 to 38 churches\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npriests  in  11 cities.  Nineteen people were killed  and\r\n\r\nsome 120 wounded.  These are very serious attacks planned\r\n\r\nby  people who have no qualms about taking the  lives  of\r\n\r\ninnocent  people.   These  are the  people  whom  we  are\r\n\r\ntalking  about  today.    Singaporeans  cannot  take  the\r\n\r\nthreat lightly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must also recognise that although the ISD\r\n\r\nhas  succeeded  in  thwarting the  plans  of  the  JI  on\r\n\r\nSingapore  targets, we can see the subsequent costs  that\r\n\r\nwe have to pay to-date.  More manpower and resources have\r\n\r\nto  be  deployed  at  all our Checkpoints  and  important\r\n\r\ninstallations  like  Jurong  Island.   The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nDefence  has already said that defence spending for  this\r\n\r\nyear   will  be  increased.   These  are  important   and\r\n\r\nnecessary to prevent a catastrophe that will cost us  not\r\n\r\nonly millions of dollars but possibly lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper is very explicit in its discussion\r\n\r\non  the  implications of the threat of terrorism  on  our\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion.  I have, as have many  others  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse, spoken on this issue.  In the past year, much  had\r\n\r\nalready been done.  There is heightened awareness of  the\r\n\r\nneed  to  understand and appreciate each other's  beliefs\r\n\r\nand  practices.  There has been a visible increase in the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  visitors to places of worship  like  mosques,\r\n\r\nchurches  and  temples, in the name of  improving  mutual\r\n\r\nunderstanding  and tolerance.  Several Members,  however,\r\n\r\nhave  also  highlighted  that  strengthening  our  social\r\n\r\ncohesion needs more than organised visits to these places\r\n\r\nof  worship.   Indeed,  often  times,  these  visits  are\r\n\r\norganised  by  and for grassroots leaders  and  activists\r\n\r\nwho,  many  of  us know, are often already the  so-called\r\n\r\nconverted.  In any case, how many more mosques,  churches\r\n\r\nor temples are there to visit?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the relevant Ministries and security\r\n\r\nagencies   will  continue  to  be  vigilant  in  ensuring\r\n\r\nSingapore's  security,  and the grassroots  organisations\r\n\r\nactively organise programmes to facilitate cross-cultural\r\n\r\nunderstanding, the question we have to ask ourselves  is:\r\n\r\nwhat is our role as individual members of the society in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nensuring  our  own security?  We are not expected  to  be\r\n\r\nvigilant or to track every suspected character that lives\r\n\r\nin  our midst.  But we can ensure that we actively invest\r\n\r\nin  our social relationships such that we are comfortable\r\n\r\nand  confident of the level of trust that  we  have  with\r\n\r\neach other, with the people who live around us.  For  all\r\n\r\nthose  Singaporeans out there who are  not  activists  or\r\n\r\nhave  not participated in grassroots activities, what  is\r\n\r\nyour role in ensuring and strengthening our social bonds?\r\n\r\nMore  generally,  have we invested  sufficiently  in  our\r\n\r\nsocial  relationships with the people around us?  At  the\r\n\r\nmost  micro level, do we know our neighbours well enough?\r\n\r\nThese  questions  had  been raised yesterday.   How  many\r\n\r\nneighbours who live in the same block of an HDB flat does\r\n\r\nthe average Singaporean know?  What about within the same\r\n\r\nRC zone?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are these questions important? Our housing\r\n\r\npolicy  ensures  that we live among the different  ethnic\r\n\r\ngroups.   The level of trust that we have of  the  people\r\n\r\naround  us  will ensure that our social cohesion  remains\r\n\r\nstrong.  It will also act as a deterrence for individuals\r\n\r\nto  get  involved in acts that will hurt the people  that\r\n\r\nare close and mean something to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the psychological profile of the JI members, as\r\n\r\nreported  in  the White Paper, noted that they  had  high\r\n\r\nlevel  of loneliness.  Perhaps they may also not be close\r\n\r\nto  their  extended network, let alone their  neighbours.\r\n\r\nThe point I am making, Sir, is that social networking  is\r\n\r\nan active process that requires effort and time.  We need\r\n\r\nto  reflect  on  the value we place on such relationships\r\n\r\nand act upon it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have often heard the common response of the lack\r\n\r\nof  time as a reason for not participating in grassroots-organised  activities.  Many will also say  they  do  not\r\n\r\neven  have  time  to interact with their neighbours.   If\r\n\r\nthis  is true, we have to ask ourselves: where will  this\r\n\r\nlead  us to in the long run?  If there is one thing  that\r\n\r\nwe  can  learn from this JI episode it is that we can  no\r\n\r\nlonger take our social relationships for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngranted.  We need to consciously find time and invest  in\r\n\r\nthese relationships.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is also more critical is the inter-ethnic\r\n\r\nrelations between neighbours.  What is the current  level\r\n\r\nof  inter-ethnic  relations in our  neighbourhoods?   The\r\n\r\nhousing policy has been in place for many years now.  But\r\n\r\nanecdotal  evidence, however, suggests that  relationship\r\n\r\nis,  at  best, superficial.  The grassroots organisations\r\n\r\ncan  do  their  part in organising activities  that  will\r\n\r\nfacilitate  interaction.  But if we do  not  embrace  the\r\n\r\nvalue,   we  will  continue  having  the  same  converted\r\n\r\nindividuals attend those functions.  Perhaps,  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations  should consider reducing the  geographical\r\n\r\nfocus  of their activities to a smaller number of  blocks\r\n\r\nof   flats  to  encourage  more  micro-level  interaction\r\n\r\nbetween   neighbours.   This  is  not   to   micro-manage\r\n\r\nrelationships between neighbours but to facilitate  their\r\n\r\ninteraction, knowing how critical such relationships  are\r\n\r\nin ensuring a continued level of trust amongst residents.\r\n\r\nWe  have heard anecdotal incidences of people not wanting\r\n\r\nto  be  in  the  same lift with members of  other  ethnic\r\n\r\ngroups  following the news of the JI arrests  last  year.\r\n\r\nSuch  unwanted  incidences can be avoided  if  neighbours\r\n\r\nreally know and trust one another.  Cumulatively, it will\r\n\r\nensure a higher level of trust between people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper is not only a call for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to wake up to the impending danger  that  is\r\n\r\nlurking  outside  our doorsteps.  It  is  also  a  gentle\r\n\r\nreminder for us to reflect within ourselves some  of  the\r\n\r\nfundamental  values that we uphold.  Are  we  willing  to\r\n\r\nleave  our  comfort  zones and  be  part  of  the  larger\r\n\r\nnetwork?  The bottom-line goes back to Singaporeans.   Do\r\n\r\nthey  feel  compelled enough to answer this call  or  are\r\n\r\nthey  comfortably living within the four walls  of  their\r\n\r\nown homes?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper also raises the important, though\r\n\r\nrather  abstract, issue of religion and religiosity.   It\r\n\r\nis  indeed  complex  - for one it is  supposed  to  be  a\r\n\r\nprivate and individual affair - but at the same time,  it\r\n\r\nhas implications for a larger community.  Indeed, we used\r\n\r\nto think of religion as being part of a private space of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  individual  and  have left it  to  that  space.   We\r\n\r\nseparate religion from the affairs of the state precisely\r\n\r\nbecause we know the complications that will arise  if  we\r\n\r\ndid  otherwise,  especially in a multi-religious  society\r\n\r\nlike ours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the complexity of religion\r\n\r\ncannot  be  sufficiently underscored.  In  any  religion,\r\n\r\nthere   exist   fundamental   doctrines,   often   times,\r\n\r\nmanifested   in   various  forms.   Varying   behavioural\r\n\r\nmanifestations  of followers are used  as  indicators  of\r\n\r\nvariations in the interpretations of these doctrines.  No\r\n\r\nreligious  community  is spared from  dealing  with  such\r\n\r\ncomplexities.  The complexity is acknowledged  by  social\r\n\r\nscientists  who  study religiosity.  As  a  psychological\r\n\r\nconstruct, these scientists agree that religiosity  is  a\r\n\r\nmulti-dimensional phenomenon.  They view  religiosity  as\r\n\r\nmore  than  just  a  behavioural  manifestation  of   the\r\n\r\nreligion.   It  includes  both  intrinsic  and  extrinsic\r\n\r\ncommitments  to  the  religion.  It  is  thus  even  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  for those outside any community to  comprehend\r\n\r\nthat very complexity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Muslim community is put on the spotlight\r\n\r\nand its members have struggled to explain variations that\r\n\r\nexist  within the community itself.  Some have said  that\r\n\r\nthe  doctrines  are  there and  it  is  the  individual's\r\n\r\npersonal choice to follow for at the end of the  day,  it\r\n\r\nis  between him and his Creator, while others believe  it\r\n\r\nis  their  duty to ensure that those who steer  away  are\r\n\r\nbrought  back to the right path.  With so many  different\r\n\r\ntenets  and  doctrines,  the  fundamental  question  that\r\n\r\narises  is  what makes one a good Muslim.   For  example,\r\n\r\nwhat makes a wife beater, who piously prays five times  a\r\n\r\nday but works irregularly and does not support the family\r\n\r\nfinancially, more or less of a Muslim, compared to a non-tudung wearing single mother who works hard and struggles\r\n\r\nto provide food on the table for her children?  Who is to\r\n\r\npass  judgment?   Muslims and non-Muslims should  refrain\r\n\r\nfrom   making  judgments  about  individuals,  based   on\r\n\r\nwhatever criteria.  Perceptions are inevitably made  from\r\n\r\nsuch judgment and, if not checked, these perceptions\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmay  translate into prejudices and prejudiced behaviours.\r\n\r\nTo  facilitate interactions, especially cross-culturally,\r\n\r\nwe  should remain non-judgmental and learn to accept  the\r\n\r\nperson who he or she is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the spiritual vacuum experienced by members of\r\n\r\nthe  JI has been highlighted as one of the keys to  their\r\n\r\nvulnerability.  Exploited to the extreme, they  are  told\r\n\r\nthat   to  be  a  good  Muslim  and  to  guarantee  their\r\n\r\nafterlife,  they have to subscribe to jihad, even  if  it\r\n\r\nmeans  hurting and sacrificing fellow Muslims.  The White\r\n\r\nPaper  thus  calls  for  a self-regulating  mechanism  to\r\n\r\nensure that the likes of the JI members are not exploited\r\n\r\nby religious teachers, like Ibrahim Maidin.  Sir, indeed,\r\n\r\nsome  scholars  have  argued  that  the  rise  of  global\r\n\r\nreligious revivalism is due to a spiritual vacuum created\r\n\r\ndue to modernisation and complex urban living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a more fundamental issue to this, ie, the\r\n\r\nneed   for  a  set  of  guidelines  that  perhaps  allows\r\n\r\nreligious  teachers to help Muslims  know  what  are  the\r\n\r\nparameters  of  behaviours and expressions  of  religious\r\n\r\npiety, within the context of a multi-racial society, that\r\n\r\ngives them the assurance that they are indeed being  good\r\n\r\nMuslims,  and practising the religion well,  as  much  as\r\n\r\nthey are being good citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs\r\n\r\nyesterday noted that Muslims are duty-bound to contribute\r\n\r\ntowards the development of a good society.  Indeed,  this\r\n\r\nis  part  of what being a good Muslim entails.  The  goal\r\n\r\nfor  each individual should be the betterment of  society\r\n\r\nas  a  whole.  I am confident that every religion,  Islam\r\n\r\nincluded, espouses towards this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in relation to the call for a self-regulating\r\n\r\nmechanism,  I am heartened that the Muslim community  has\r\n\r\ntaken the recommendation positively.  Last night, a group\r\n\r\nof  Muslim  residents, including a couple  of  grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders,  came to see me to say that they would  like  to\r\n\r\nregister  the religious classes that are being  organised\r\n\r\nin   their  neighbourhood.   I  welcome  their  voluntary\r\n\r\ngesture and directed them to the mosque in the area which\r\n\r\nis in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprocess of compiling a list of Muslim residents to  refer\r\n\r\nto.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been much call for the moderates in\r\n\r\nthe Muslim community to speak out and denounce terrorism.\r\n\r\nImplicit  is for Muslims to exercise moderation  and  not\r\n\r\nallow  extreme  elements  to take  over  the  community's\r\n\r\nagenda.   Sir,  Islam  is about moderation.   The  Friday\r\n\r\nsermon  of  17th  January this year,  just  last  Friday,\r\n\r\ndelivered   in   mosques  all  over   Singapore   clearly\r\n\r\nemphasised  this point.  The Imam quoted the  Prophet  as\r\n\r\nsaying that:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This religion (Islam) is a simple religion. And\r\n\r\nshould  anyone  make it rigid (by going to the  extremes)\r\n\r\nthe religion will eventually overcome him.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe went on to explain:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Indeed to propel our community forward, we have to\r\n\r\nbe wise and tactful.  We must avoid coming near to any of\r\n\r\nthe  two  extremes.   At one end,  there  are  those  who\r\n\r\nneglect religious duties, no prayers, no fasting, no good\r\n\r\nmoral  character,  and the list goes on.   On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  there  are those who exaggerate the  teachings  of\r\n\r\nIslam  and  promote chaos and disturbances wherever  they\r\n\r\nare.   They  isolate  themselves, have  their  own  rigid\r\n\r\ninterpretations,  and plan for the demise  of  their  own\r\n\r\ncommunity.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same sermon, the Imam also highlighted the\r\n\r\nrole of the Muslim community, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The community of Islam must be exemplary. It must\r\n\r\nset  the  highest  standards of performance  and  be  the\r\n\r\nreference  point for others.  It must avoid excesses  and\r\n\r\nextravagances  and  static rigidity  and  extremism.   To\r\n\r\nstrike  a  middle course of action, to be  steadfast  and\r\n\r\nconsistent, to know what to accept and what to reject, to\r\n\r\nhave principles and at the same time remain adaptable  is\r\n\r\nprobably  the  hardest test of the  human  character  and\r\n\r\nsocial viability.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, Islam is about moderation and the\r\n\r\nMuslim  community  is committed to upholding  this  value\r\n\r\nsteadfastly.   This  is  also  clearly  stated   in   the\r\n\r\nstatement  by  MUIS on the White Paper.  MUIS  urges  all\r\n\r\nmosques,  Muslim organisations and the Muslim  public  to\r\n\r\nuphold  the  true teachings of Islam and  its  values  of\r\n\r\nmoderation, tolerance and mutual respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as we grapple with the\r\n\r\nchallenge of religious revivalism, we are confronted with\r\n\r\nthe issue of common spaces.  Where are these\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommon spaces?  What are the guidelines towards behaviour\r\n\r\nin  these  common  spaces?   Essentially,  common  spaces\r\n\r\nshould  minimise  differences and maximise  commonalties,\r\n\r\nthat  is, a space where members share values, aspirations\r\n\r\nand  motivations,  with  the  betterment  of  the  group,\r\n\r\ncommunity or society as a whole, as the desired  outcome.\r\n\r\nThese  are  universal values that should be  accepted  by\r\n\r\nevery  religion.   Thus, Muslims should feel  comfortable\r\n\r\nthat  being part of the common space does not  make  them\r\n\r\nany  less  Muslim.  MUIS must take the  lead  in  helping\r\n\r\nMuslims  in this regard.  There will always be  room  for\r\n\r\nprivate spaces but we cannot remain in the private  space\r\n\r\nalone.  We need to be part of the common space in a multi-racial and religious context, like Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as much as the White Paper has unequivocally\r\n\r\nemphasised  that  the issue is about  terrorism  and  not\r\n\r\nIslam, many in the community still feel that they are  in\r\n\r\nthe  spotlight  yet  again.   While  the  Malay  MPs  and\r\n\r\ncommunity  leaders continue to motivate the community  to\r\n\r\nmove  on  and  move forward, the process can  be  further\r\n\r\nfacilitated  by  members of the other communities.   Life\r\n\r\nshould go on and should not be affected by this incident.\r\n\r\nThe  other  communities  should also  assure  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  that  they are still as comfortable  with  the\r\n\r\nMuslims  as before.  If there should be any questions  or\r\n\r\ndoubts  that arise, they should be dealt with immediately\r\n\r\nand  not  be  allowed to brew.  The Malay  MPs  have  met\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Chinese media and clan associations  and\r\n\r\nare  heartened to note their continued understanding  and\r\n\r\nsupport  for  the  Muslim  community.   The  channels  of\r\n\r\ncommunication are open at the community level through the\r\n\r\nIRCC or direct to the authorities, like MUIS, should  any\r\n\r\nclarification be needed about the Muslim community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we started 2002 with the\r\n\r\nnews  of  the arrest of the first batch of JI operatives.\r\n\r\nWe  have  started 2003 debating on what we should  do  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  our  society continues to  function  amidst\r\n\r\nthese  serious threats and challenges.  I wonder  how  we\r\n\r\nwill start\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n2004.  But however it may be, I am confident that we will\r\n\r\nweather this storm together and come out of it as a  more\r\n\r\ncohesive and resilient society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, in the last two days,\r\n\r\nseveral MPs and the Minister for Home Affairs have spoken\r\n\r\nof the need to break the silence on the JI and the threat\r\n\r\nof terrorism.  The fervent encouragement to draw out both\r\n\r\nMuslims  and  non-Muslims to engage in open dialogues  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  their  fears, suspicions and  aspirations  is  a\r\n\r\nnecessary phase in the healing process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a diverse people, our multi-racial society can\r\n\r\nonly  progress  to the next phase, if we can  bring  down\r\n\r\nwalls  and  dare  to bare our all to  one  another.   The\r\n\r\npublic  denouncement  of  the sins  of  the  arrested  JI\r\n\r\nmembers  and  the  united  stand  taken  by  the   Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity   and   our  Muslim  political  leadership   in\r\n\r\ncondemning the terrorist activities are reassuring to the\r\n\r\nnon-Muslims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a multi-racial society, we have thrived on\r\n\r\ndiversity  and  learned  to  create  unity  in  diversity\r\n\r\nthrough  mutual  respect,  tolerance  and  trust.    Such\r\n\r\nevergreen  and enduring values have guided the  different\r\n\r\nracial groups through many crises and for as long as they\r\n\r\nare  preserved  as our living code, I believe  they  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to guide us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in Indonesia, we saw the constant denial that\r\n\r\nthe  island states have terrorists in their midst,  right\r\n\r\nup  to  the Bali bombings.  During the regime of Suharto,\r\n\r\nalthough  more  stringent  measures  were  taken  against\r\n\r\nIslamic  extremists, there was also a lid  put  to  avoid\r\n\r\nmentioning names.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the timely release of the White Paper, three\r\n\r\ndaunting  questions  before  us  are:   would  democratic\r\n\r\npolitical  decisions  be sufficient  to  stamp  out  such\r\n\r\nclandestine  terrorist  activities?   Should  we  go  for\r\n\r\nmilitary  response  and how will  the  social  fabric  be\r\n\r\naffected?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer these questions, we have to be clear that\r\n\r\nthe war against the terrorists\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  JI is a war fought by all Singaporeans.  We have  to\r\n\r\nbe  aware of the threat terrorism poses, the need  to  be\r\n\r\nvigilant  and  how as a people we must work  through  our\r\n\r\ndifferences  to foster closer ties so as to  prevent  any\r\n\r\ncleavage  in  our  social fabric  caused  by  those  with\r\n\r\nulterior motives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to touch on the threat of\r\n\r\nterrorism  and  JI.  Sir, terrorism has reared  its  ugly\r\n\r\nhead  in Southeast Asia and Singapore has not been spared\r\n\r\nas   two  groups  of  JI  terrorists  were  arrested  and\r\n\r\ndetained.  As recounted by some MPs before, these  groups\r\n\r\nhad  plotted  to bomb not only US interests in  Singapore\r\n\r\nbut also strategic local sites in a bid to foment discord\r\n\r\nbetween Singapore and Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the JI activities were first made known in\r\n\r\nDecember  2001,  Singaporeans had a rude awakening.   The\r\n\r\nmanifestations  of  their  terror  activities   and   the\r\n\r\ndiscovery  that  these cells exist in our  midst  sent  a\r\n\r\nchill down the spines of many Singaporeans.  Suddenly our\r\n\r\nstable   business   environment  and  lucrative   tourist\r\n\r\nindustry are affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obvious concern is the fear of a bomb explosion\r\n\r\nthat  could  destabilise  our  infrastructure,  and   the\r\n\r\nterrorists would have achieved its goal of creating chaos\r\n\r\nand  animosity  in yet another icon of the  world.   This\r\n\r\nfear  continues to haunt many Singaporeans, as  witnessed\r\n\r\nby  their  public expressions that they avoid individuals\r\n\r\ndraped  entirely in robes and with slits  for  the  eyes.\r\n\r\nAlso,  places frequented by Caucasians, such  as  Holland\r\n\r\nVillage  and Boat Quay, are pegged danger areas by  these\r\n\r\nfearful  Singaporeans.    Such emotions  in  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwill  impact the social interaction amongst the different\r\n\r\nracial groups.  Singaporeans need to be educated more  on\r\n\r\nIslam  and  the practices of the Muslims.  Psychology  of\r\n\r\nthe  human  mind is such that when one knows little,  one\r\n\r\nfears a lot; and that can be overcome through knowledge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth of the matter is that both Muslims and non-Muslims are living in fear and suspicion of one another.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMuslim  fraternity  feels that they are  under  scrutiny,\r\n\r\nthat they are being blocked out of many opportunities  in\r\n\r\ngetting a job, or a promotion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the non-Muslims who have been\r\n\r\nconstantly reminded to be more sensitive of their  Muslim\r\n\r\nfriends,  feel  that they have already accommodated  much\r\n\r\nand that it is time for the Muslims to reciprocate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is timely that we commence a series of PR\r\n\r\ncampaigns  to  inform, create awareness and  educate  the\r\n\r\npublic on how to deal with crisis, tense relationship and\r\n\r\nforge common goals and identity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very nature of the JI terrorists is to break\r\n\r\nsociety.  In response, all Singaporeans need to be closer\r\n\r\nand stronger as fellow brothers and sisters.  This social\r\n\r\nunity is vital.  Although we can have all the legislation\r\n\r\nand security measures in place, cohesion and unity cannot\r\n\r\nbe  guaranteed.   All  it takes is a small  incident  and\r\n\r\nanother  similar strife at Ayodhya, India,  where  Hindus\r\n\r\nand  Muslims  were  formerly living peacefully  together,\r\n\r\ncould erupt in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I would like to touch on the need to be\r\n\r\nprepared and be vigilant at all times.  The globalisation\r\n\r\nof  terrorist activities meant that Singapore is  exposed\r\n\r\nto a number of terrorist groups like the JI, Red Army and\r\n\r\nTamil Tigers.  Singaporeans must be aware that there  are\r\n\r\nmany, among us, who can be exploited by such groups.   We\r\n\r\nneed  to know who is who in the list as the numbers  grow\r\n\r\nso that we can be vigilant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too long ago, Business Times carried an article\r\n\r\non  the  courageous Balinese reaction to the bomb blasts.\r\n\r\nI  think  the  actions of Bambang, a Balinese  of  Indian\r\n\r\ndescent and who is also a Hindu married to a Muslim, is a\r\n\r\nfine example for non-Muslim Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an era where nothing is certain, we need to be\r\n\r\nready and have a prepared\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmindset for the worst so that when the worst does  occur,\r\n\r\nwe know what to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foremost in the minds of many Singaporeans is the\r\n\r\nquestion:  why is it that it has taken the Government  so\r\n\r\nlong  to  present  the facts to the  public?   And,  more\r\n\r\nimportantly,  why  was  there no  earlier  detection  and\r\n\r\naction  taken  to  nip the problem  in  the  bud  at  the\r\n\r\nearliest  sign  of suspicion?  Were we not  playing  with\r\n\r\nfire  when we did nothing to put off the sparks when they\r\n\r\nwere first detected?  Have we given a fair trial?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here, it is necessary to explain and reinforce\r\n\r\nto  the  public that we could not apply the same criminal\r\n\r\nproceedings  to solve the terrorism issue; otherwise,  we\r\n\r\nwould  never be able to comb through the whole JI network\r\n\r\nin Singapore and disbanded two cells.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action taken in the ultimate has to be swift,\r\n\r\nie,  detention  without trial to terminate  mischief;  as\r\n\r\notherwise,  we could not have broken these terrorists  up\r\n\r\nbefore  they  let  off  the  truck  bombs.   We  have  to\r\n\r\nunderstand that Singapore is a high value target  despite\r\n\r\nall measures taken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I would like to touch on the way forward for\r\n\r\nus.  Whilst the JI network in Singapore may seemingly  be\r\n\r\ndisrupted by the arrests of the JI terrorists and may not\r\n\r\npose an imminent threat, a larger looming concern is that\r\n\r\nthe insidious terrorist activities can actually undermine\r\n\r\nthe inter-ethnic peace and harmony that Singaporeans have\r\n\r\nbuilt  up  over the years.  It is important to  reinforce\r\n\r\nthe point raised in the White Paper - that the two groups\r\n\r\narrested  represent only a small, isolated group  of  the\r\n\r\nlarger  Muslim  population.  Their \"sins\" against  fellow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have no bearing on the other Muslims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I condemn the terrorist activities as \"sins\"\r\n\r\nbecause  they were meant to be senselessly and  viciously\r\n\r\ndirected at the innocent and peace-loving Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we had witnessed the joyous outbursts of some\r\n\r\nindividual Muslims on the 9/11 incident, in the  case  of\r\n\r\nthe JI\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\narrests,  the  JI  activities had  elicited  a  different\r\n\r\nresponse from the Muslim community.  The Muslim community\r\n\r\nhas  openly condemned the JI agenda.  Such a stand  taken\r\n\r\nby the Muslim community has given much reassurance to the\r\n\r\nother  racial  groups  of the allegiance  of  our  Muslim\r\n\r\nbrothers and sisters to Singapore as a nation and  fellow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslim community as a whole will have to move\r\n\r\nforward  to  play  the red alert and trigger  the  signal\r\n\r\nwhenever  they come across any deviant character.   As  a\r\n\r\ncommunity,  the Muslims must inculcate the resilience  to\r\n\r\nbring to task the deviant Muslims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that this microscopic scrutiny of the\r\n\r\nextremists  is  causing awkwardness and uneasiness  among\r\n\r\nthe  Muslims.  Efforts have been made to showcase  inter-racial and inter-religious harmony.  I was told that  for\r\n\r\nmany  on  the  ground,  they all  seem  over-zealous  and\r\n\r\nartificial.   Scratch the surface layer a bit deeper  and\r\n\r\nwe will find tension.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way to dissipate such emotions is to encourage\r\n\r\nmore dialogues and sharing among the different racial and\r\n\r\nreligious groups.  I am encouraged by the sharing of  one\r\n\r\nMalay  professional lady, in one recent feedback session,\r\n\r\nand  she spoke openly about her feelings and asked:  what\r\n\r\nis  it that the non-Muslims would like her to clarify for\r\n\r\nthem?  She explained the values and virtues of the Muslim\r\n\r\nfaith  and dispelled the notions that all clad-up Muslims\r\n\r\nare suspects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She commented that the increased religiosity among\r\n\r\nSingaporean  Muslims is not an attempt at isolation.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  it  is about being a better Muslim and that  meant\r\n\r\nbeing  a  better  person and, in turn, a better  citizen.\r\n\r\nShe  also  spoke  of  being  more  warmly  treated  as  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean while in Laos than when she is in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nTo  quote  her,  \"Here, I am seen as a Malay Muslim  girl\r\n\r\nfirst, and Singaporean as secondary\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My initial response to her observation was that all\r\n\r\nvisitors always feel like kings and queens because of the\r\n\r\nspecial efforts\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  the  host  would  accord to  them.   We  know  that\r\n\r\nfamiliarity breeds contempt, and once you are used to one\r\n\r\nanother, you do away with formalities and niceties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting on her comment further, I asked myself if\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  need  to revisit our often take-for-granted\r\n\r\nattitude.  When there is a patch in a relationship to  be\r\n\r\nmended,  it  is  good  to be aware of  the  need  to  re-establish these formalities and niceties, as such efforts\r\n\r\nreassure   the  desire  to  want  to  work  out  positive\r\n\r\noutcomes.   So,  perhaps, social groupings  should  begin\r\n\r\nsome refresher programmes on inter-relationship skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the grassroots organisations should start a\r\n\r\nConversation series in small groupings of not  more  than\r\n\r\n30,  to  encourage  more sharing among  the  multi-racial\r\n\r\ngroupings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also dispel suspicion and avoid criticism\r\n\r\nwhen  we  observe differences in practices.  For example,\r\n\r\nwe  should not see it as wrong if a Muslim woman does not\r\n\r\nshake hands with her male colleague.  She is behaving  in\r\n\r\na  proper  manner as prescribed by her faith.  We  should\r\n\r\nnot be suspicious but be respectful of that.  In fact,  I\r\n\r\nwas told that conservative Indian ladies too do not shake\r\n\r\nhands  with men.  We should take heart that we  are  far-removed from really knowing the practices of other  races\r\n\r\nand religions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, we must have a ready mindset to embrace\r\n\r\nand  learn from the experiences of others.  For  example,\r\n\r\nthe  Sikh  communities in the US had stepped  forward  to\r\n\r\ntalk  about  their faith in the light of  racial  attacks\r\n\r\nafter 9/11.  All Singaporeans could similarly do more  of\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bottom-up approach is the responsibility at the\r\n\r\nindividual  level  and must be the way to  move  forward,\r\n\r\ncomplementing  the  top-down  approach  as  seen  in  the\r\n\r\nsetting-up of IRCCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Singaporeans, including Members of this\r\n\r\nChamber, feel that the way to move ahead is not  to  have\r\n\r\nmore control and legislation, but to prevent\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomic   and  social  disenfranchisement   among   some\r\n\r\nminorities,  which  might  give  rise  to  more  would-be\r\n\r\nterrorists.  I was told that many Malay taxi drivers have\r\n\r\nbeen  relating the sad fate of fellow Muslims  finding  a\r\n\r\njob, due to racial discrimination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this, I would like to share that statistics from\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Manpower showed a \"more or  less\"  equal\r\n\r\ndistribution of the unemployed among the Malays,  Chinese\r\n\r\nand   Indians.    Very  often,  it  is  a   question   of\r\n\r\ncompetencies,  not race, that mattered in job  selection.\r\n\r\nHowever,   we  have  to  note  that  the  perception   of\r\n\r\ndisenfranchisement, which might be contrary  to  reality,\r\n\r\ntakes  on  a  dose of reality itself when it is  repeated\r\n\r\nenough.   And  there will always be people  who  wish  to\r\n\r\nexploit this gap between perception and reality.  We need\r\n\r\nto  remind  employers to be more open and transparent  in\r\n\r\ntheir selection and hiring practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on managing inter-racial\r\n\r\nharmony  at the workplace and creating more awareness  in\r\n\r\nthe institutions of learning on the White Paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper is silent on how relationship\r\n\r\nat   the  workplace  ought  to  be  managed.   Whilst   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  employers and union leaders  are  being\r\n\r\nbriefed  on  the  White Paper, I am  concerned  that  the\r\n\r\noperational people-managers and informal leaders  at  the\r\n\r\nworkplace  to-date have not received proper  guidance  on\r\n\r\nhow  to  deal  with sensitivities concerning  our  multi-racial workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The casual approach towards the terrorist threat\r\n\r\nadopted  at  work  so far has resulted  in  many  at  the\r\n\r\nworkplace taking the situation lightly.  This is  clearly\r\n\r\ndemonstrated by the few reported incidents of  bomb  hoax\r\n\r\nat workplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another disturbing observation is that some\r\n\r\nindividuals   at  the  workplace  are  taking   political\r\n\r\nadvantage  of the situation for their short-term  agenda.\r\n\r\nWe  are hearing more allegations of racial discrimination\r\n\r\nin recruitment and promotion\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexercises.  This gets picked up and, rightly or  wrongly,\r\n\r\nthe sympathies go to the aggrieved party.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here is where we want both employers and union\r\n\r\nleaders to play their part to remind informal leaders  at\r\n\r\nworkplace to be quick to dispel such allusions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I speak this from a personal experience. Not\r\n\r\ntoo  long  ago,  a colleague at work informed  me  of  an\r\n\r\nincident  with the mother of a young Muslim  recruit  for\r\n\r\nthe  job of an apprentice.  She came to the workplace  to\r\n\r\nsign  the Training bond as a guarantor for her son.   She\r\n\r\ninformed  the  executive attending to her, that  her  son\r\n\r\nwould  not be able to perform work every Friday  from  12\r\n\r\nnoon  to  3  pm  because  of prayers.   In  response,  my\r\n\r\ncolleague  advised that the job could not  accommodate  a\r\n\r\nlong  break of three hours and that it would be good  for\r\n\r\nher son to rethink about the job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to acknowledge that the workplace is\r\n\r\ncommon  ground  for all.  It is sometimes  difficult  for\r\n\r\nemployers to draw a line between accommodating employees'\r\n\r\nrequirements and getting the job done.  This is not about\r\n\r\nmarginalising the minority race, but the need to preserve\r\n\r\ncommon identity in a common place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important for the community at large to\r\n\r\nknow that selection and promotion are guided by criteria,\r\n\r\nand if applicants do not qualify, it is because they have\r\n\r\nnot  met  with  the  criteria and not because  of  racial\r\n\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like my colleagues before me, I would like to\r\n\r\ncomment  on  my hon. colleague, Mr Shanmugam's  statement\r\n\r\nabout  \"a small measure of affirmative action\" to  enable\r\n\r\nmore  Malays  to occupy important posts.  I am  happy  to\r\n\r\nnote  that,  in this instance, our system has been  doing\r\n\r\nthat for the latter, starting from the highest office  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   We  had a Malay President  in  Yusof  Ishak.\r\n\r\nThere  are  also other top positions in both the  private\r\n\r\nand Government sectors held by Malays.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In support of Dr Tan Cheng Bock's rejection of the\r\n\r\nsuggestion of marginalisation\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof   Muslims,  I  would  like  to  point  out  here  that\r\n\r\neverything else being equal, it is important that, in the\r\n\r\nfinal  analysis, when picking a candidate for a position,\r\n\r\nit   goes  beyond  considerations  of  meritocracy.    In\r\n\r\nreality, factors that align the affinity of the candidate\r\n\r\nto the job and the people around are just as important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in connection with promoting inter-racial\r\n\r\nharmony at the workplace, I would like to propose  for  a\r\n\r\nseries  of awareness programmes on how to deal  with  the\r\n\r\nsensitivities  of  the  multi-racial  workforce  at   the\r\n\r\nworkplace.   In  fact, to begin with, I am  proposing  to\r\n\r\nincorporate  a Certificate and Diploma module  on  inter-racial  relationship  in  Human Resource  and  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  programmes  so  that  people-managers,   union\r\n\r\nleaders  and,  subsequently, the workforce, will  acquire\r\n\r\nthe  necessary  knowledge and skills  to  deal  with  one\r\n\r\nanother more sensitively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, in order to make these programmes\r\n\r\naccessible, I hope that the Skills Development Fund (SDF)\r\n\r\nwould  consider  giving  these programmes  the  necessary\r\n\r\nfunding  so  that companies will be more  ready  to  send\r\n\r\ntheir employees.  More importantly, we want to bring home\r\n\r\nthe point that 9/11 and the subsequent arrests of the  JI\r\n\r\nmembers  have  certainly changed our  modus  operandi  at\r\n\r\nwork.   And  multi-racial  relationship  management  must\r\n\r\nbecome the core curriculum at the workplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the workplace, we should also look at the\r\n\r\nschools,  JCs  and tertiary institutions.  The  terrorist\r\n\r\nissue  and  threat of the JI are here to stay.   The  3Gs\r\n\r\nwill  be  living  with this threat and  all  the  related\r\n\r\nsensitivities.   This is a special  group  that  we  must\r\n\r\ngarner  to  understand and appreciate  what  the  JI  and\r\n\r\nterrorist threats are all about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge for schools to initiate discussion on\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper.   It needs special  study  in  the  GP\r\n\r\ncurriculum.  With a good appreciation of the complexities\r\n\r\nof  the matter, our 3Gs would be better prepared to  deal\r\n\r\nwith the issues that threaten us.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, going forward. We should no longer be\r\n\r\nmoaning  over  whose responsibility it is  to  drive  the\r\n\r\nunity  of  Singaporeans, but rather as Singaporeans,  how\r\n\r\nand  what should we do to ensure the strengthening of our\r\n\r\nsocial fabric.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we have boldly and clearly clarified that\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslims  are not marginalised, we must  make  every\r\n\r\neffort  to  erase such notions and talks.   Efforts  must\r\n\r\ncome  from both Muslims and non-Muslims.  We could  learn\r\n\r\nfrom  the constant mutual assurances between the  Muslims\r\n\r\nand non-Muslims in the UK.  We should also heed the words\r\n\r\nof  US  President George Bush, \"Islam is  a  religion  we\r\n\r\naccept, but not Al-Qaeda\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Sir, similarly, we should also heed these\r\n\r\nwords.   If  an individual is not promoted  to  a  higher\r\n\r\nposition,  or selected for a post, it is because  he  did\r\n\r\nnot  meet  the  criteria needed for  the  post,  and  not\r\n\r\nbecause of race.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion standing in\r\n\r\nthe  name  of the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Wong  Kan\r\n\r\nSeng.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper clearly sets out the history\r\n\r\nand  the  nature of the threat of terrorism in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  also  recommends bold initiatives to deal  with  this\r\n\r\nthreat.    Many   of  us  have  assumed  that   terrorist\r\n\r\nactivities in Singapore only started in 2001,  after  the\r\n\r\nSeptember 11 attack on the World Trade Center and that it\r\n\r\nhas  ended  with the recent arrests of the JI  activists.\r\n\r\nThe  White  Paper  shows  us  otherwise.   Terrorism   in\r\n\r\nSingapore dates back a long way and it is far from  being\r\n\r\neliminated.   It is a deep-rooted problem.  It  threatens\r\n\r\nthe  stability and security of our society.  It needs  to\r\n\r\nbe  addressed  thoroughly and seriously.   On  the  other\r\n\r\nextreme, there are also people who are paranoid  and  see\r\n\r\nterrorists  everywhere.  There is no need  to  over-react\r\n\r\nand,  as  a result, strain inter-relations.  We  need  to\r\n\r\nhave a balanced approach.  The White Paper is, therefore,\r\n\r\na timely document that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovides some guidelines for dealing with this issue.  It\r\n\r\nalso  reminds  us  that terrorism is a  problem  for  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Government's efforts alone  will  not  be\r\n\r\nenough.   We  must work together to deal  with  it  as  a\r\n\r\nunited people\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the three key recommendations set out\r\n\r\nin the paper, ie, to enhance security measures, to police\r\n\r\nthe threat of terrorism and to strengthen social cohesion\r\n\r\nand  religious harmony.  These are the three  pillars  of\r\n\r\nour  counter-terrorism strategy.  I would like  to  share\r\n\r\nsome of my views and suggestions in this respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I agree with Mdm Ho Geok Choo that we must\r\n\r\nbe   prepared.   We  must  prepare  our  people  for  the\r\n\r\neventuality  of an actual terrorist attack in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  am fully confident of the effectiveness  of  our\r\n\r\nsecurity  measures  and the capability  of  our  security\r\n\r\nagencies  to  manage  and minimise the  terrorist  risks.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we must not and cannot afford to be complacent.\r\n\r\nWe  must recognise that there is a possibility, remote as\r\n\r\nit  may  be,  that  a terrorist incident  could  actually\r\n\r\nhappen  in Singapore.  As documents released recently  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Home Affairs have shown,  had  we  not\r\n\r\ncaught the JI terrorists in time, a major incident  could\r\n\r\nhave  taken  place.   If  and  when  this  happens,   the\r\n\r\npsychological impact on our people could far outstrip the\r\n\r\nphysical  impact  of the incident.  More importantly,  it\r\n\r\ncould create a rift among Singaporeans of different races\r\n\r\nand religions.  It could threaten the cohesiveness of our\r\n\r\nsociety.  The multi-racial and multi-religious society we\r\n\r\nhave  so painstakingly built over the last 30 years could\r\n\r\neasily  be  destroyed overnight.  If  this  happens,  the\r\n\r\nterrorists   would  have  achieved  their  objective   of\r\n\r\ndestabilising the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I feel that other than enhancing physical\r\n\r\nsecurity  measures,  we need to also prepare  our  people\r\n\r\npsychologically  in  the  event  that  an  incident  does\r\n\r\nhappen.  To do this, I would like to urge the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs  to  consider a public education  programme\r\n\r\naimed at informing our people what they ought to do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  what  they  ought  not to do in such  eventualities.\r\n\r\nThis  is  no  different from our effort  to  prepare  our\r\n\r\npeople in Total Defence.  The recent bomb hoax at Holland\r\n\r\nVillage  is an example of how an ill-informed public  may\r\n\r\nbe  used  to  propagate damaging rumours that  may  cause\r\n\r\npanic among Singaporeans.  Therefore, being well-informed\r\n\r\nis   a   crucial  element  of  our  preparedness  against\r\n\r\nterrorist  attacks.   For  example,  we  must  constantly\r\n\r\nremind  our  people that should an incident happen,  they\r\n\r\nshould  not  panic  and should not  jump  to  conclusions\r\n\r\nprematurely.  We should also remind them not  to  aid  in\r\n\r\npropagating   unverified  rumours  or   to   inform   the\r\n\r\nauthorities  when they become aware of such rumours.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  this  needs to be done carefully so  as  not  to\r\n\r\ncreate unnecessary fear among our people.  The key is  to\r\n\r\nlet  them  know  what to expect and what is  expected  of\r\n\r\nthem.   This way, they would be psychologically  prepared\r\n\r\nand  would not be caught by surprise.  The impact of  any\r\n\r\nincident can then be better managed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we need to strengthen the resilience of\r\n\r\nour  people,  especially the younger generation,  against\r\n\r\ndistorted  teachings.  The White Paper showed that  among\r\n\r\nthose  arrested, all, except two, are of average or above\r\n\r\naverage   intelligence.   They  are   not   ignorant   or\r\n\r\ndestitute.   They  are fully aware of their  actions  and\r\n\r\ndeadly  serious about their missions.  What  disturbs  me\r\n\r\nmost  is  the ability of the terrorist network to attract\r\n\r\nintelligent people and sometimes respectable  members  of\r\n\r\nour  society  to  join  in their  cause.   Investigations\r\n\r\nshowed that one of the recruitment techniques used by the\r\n\r\nJI   network  is  through  seemingly  innocent  religious\r\n\r\nclasses.   These classes have far-reaching  influence  on\r\n\r\nthe  impressionable  minds of our  younger  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nThe teachers abuse the trust and betray the confidence of\r\n\r\ntheir  students.   Then  they bind  their  recruits  with\r\n\r\nthreats  of  infidelity  if they choose  to  leave  their\r\n\r\norganisation.  Such techniques are frightfully similar to\r\n\r\nthose  used by secret societies in the past.   The  long-term  solution to terrorist threats is to find a  way  to\r\n\r\ndisrupt  their  recruitment process.  I believe  that  we\r\n\r\nmust deal with the root of the issue.  We must strengthen\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingaporeans' resilience against recruitment  efforts  by\r\n\r\nthe  terrorist network and we must do so right  from  the\r\n\r\nstart, among our younger Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, I would like to suggest that we\r\n\r\nrevise and update our school curriculum, for example,  in\r\n\r\nthe  National  Education  Programme,  to  include  issues\r\n\r\nrelating to terrorism.  Young Singaporeans must be taught\r\n\r\nthe values of social cohesion and religious harmony.   We\r\n\r\nmust  inculcate  in  them  the  basic  values  of  mutual\r\n\r\nrespect,   mutual   tolerance  and   mutual   acceptance,\r\n\r\nregardless  of race and religion.  These values  must  be\r\n\r\ntransformed  from academic knowledge into a way  of  life\r\n\r\nfor   all  Singaporeans.   This  way,  when  our  younger\r\n\r\nSingaporeans come across teachings that do not conform to\r\n\r\nthese  basic values, they would then be able to  question\r\n\r\nthe basis of such teachings rather than being taken in by\r\n\r\ntheir  emotional appeal.  If they have been  taught  from\r\n\r\nyoung that it is wrong to take away lives, they will then\r\n\r\nhave  strong moral courage to resist the call to be  part\r\n\r\nof  a terrorist plan to kill innocent people.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nI  would  like to urge the Ministry to work closely  with\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  of  Education  to  review  our   National\r\n\r\nEducation Programme for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to strengthen religious harmony and foster\r\n\r\ngreater  mutual understanding and acceptance, we need  to\r\n\r\ncreate  more channels for communication among the various\r\n\r\nethnic  and religious groups.  We cannot deny  that  many\r\n\r\ndifferences do exist among different religious and ethnic\r\n\r\ngroups.    To   do   so  is  being  unrealistic.    These\r\n\r\ndifferences  are a result of our cultural  heritage,  our\r\n\r\nlife  experiences and our religious beliefs.  Even within\r\n\r\nthe same religious group, there are differences.  I am  a\r\n\r\nChristian.     There  are  many  different  denominations\r\n\r\nwithin  the  Christian  faith,  with  varying  practices.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  among  the  Chinese,  there  are  also   many\r\n\r\ndifferent dialect groups - Teochew, Hokkien, Cantonese  - some  do not even talk to one another.  However,  on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  there exist many similarities  among  these\r\n\r\ndifferent  groups.  We share the same land, we share  the\r\n\r\nsame  community,  we  share  the  same  consequences   if\r\n\r\nterrorism\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  allowed to grow in Singapore.  Many of the  potential\r\n\r\nconflicts  stem  from the lack of understanding  of  each\r\n\r\nother.   Such  misunderstanding,  if  not  resolved,  may\r\n\r\neventually   lead   to  distrust  and   eventually   even\r\n\r\nanimosity.  To avoid this, we must acknowledge and accept\r\n\r\nthe   differences,  but  emphasise  and  build   on   the\r\n\r\nsimilarities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of the Inter-Racial Confidence\r\n\r\nCircles is a good start.  Perhaps it would be useful  for\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Community Development  and  Sports  to\r\n\r\nconsider  organising  more regular  dialogues  among  the\r\n\r\nvarious  groups at the national level.  For  example,  we\r\n\r\ncould consider an annual forum where leaders from various\r\n\r\nreligious  groups,  as well as grassroots  organisations,\r\n\r\ncan  gather  to  share their views and  concerns.   There\r\n\r\ncould  be  open sessions as well as closed-door sessions.\r\n\r\nThis  will provide a platform for sensitive issues to  be\r\n\r\ndiscussed  and differences to be resolved in  an  orderly\r\n\r\nmanner.   It will also provide an opportunity for greater\r\n\r\ninteraction among the leaders and, hopefully,  this  will\r\n\r\nlead  to greater understanding and tolerance.  This forum\r\n\r\ncan  also be used as a platform for the religious leaders\r\n\r\nto  proclaim  statements on their stand  with  regard  to\r\n\r\nreligious  harmony.  Such proclamation will  serve  as  a\r\n\r\nconstant  reminder and a useful guide for the  respective\r\n\r\nbelievers  and followers.  This forum can also  become  a\r\n\r\nsymbol, an icon, of our commitment to social cohesion and\r\n\r\nracial harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as we debate in this House\r\n\r\nhow to tackle the threat of terrorism, we must not forget\r\n\r\nto  recognise  the  good  work put  in  by  our  security\r\n\r\nagencies.   The  Home  Team,  in  particular,   must   be\r\n\r\napplauded for the effective intelligence they managed  to\r\n\r\ngather  and the swift and decisive actions that followed.\r\n\r\nIt is through their relentless efforts that our homes are\r\n\r\nsafe from the terrorists and we can all sleep soundly  at\r\n\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I support the motion to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nendorse the recommendations proposed in the White Paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take this very serious topic in a more light-hearted manner. There were two families staying in the\r\n\r\nsame  block  of  flats and they did not interact  between\r\n\r\nthemselves, not even greeting each other when they met in\r\n\r\nthe  lift.   One night, they were laughing, cheering  and\r\n\r\neven   held  each  other's  hands  in  jubilation.   Why?\r\n\r\nBecause   the  Brazil  soccer  team,  which   they   both\r\n\r\nsupported,  had  won  the  World  Cup.  So,  this  common\r\n\r\ninterest of theirs had bridged the gap between them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me touch on Part V of the White Paper on\r\n\r\nstrengthening social cohesion and religious harmony. Over\r\n\r\nthe  years,  the Government has been promoting  religious\r\n\r\nharmony  and as a result our people are living in harmony\r\n\r\nhere  in  Singapore.   In  order to  enhance  our  mutual\r\n\r\nunderstanding, we have to first learn and understand  the\r\n\r\ndifferences  among  us,  so that  we  would  be  able  to\r\n\r\naccommodate, tolerate and live with each other.  However,\r\n\r\nwe  are  a multi-racial and multi-religious society.   In\r\n\r\norder  to  enhance  our cohesion,  I  think  it  is  more\r\n\r\nimportant  that  we  recognise our similarities  than  to\r\n\r\nemphasise  our differences. There may be some competition\r\n\r\nbetween  a hawker who sells apples and another who  sells\r\n\r\noranges,   although  the  fruits  they  sell  are   quite\r\n\r\ndifferent. But when someone advocates that it  is  better\r\n\r\nto eat vegetables than to  eat fruits,  I am sure the two\r\n\r\nfruit  sellers will take a common stand and be united  to\r\n\r\nargue otherwise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from knowing and understanding the activities\r\n\r\nof  the  terrorists,  I think we should  use  our  common\r\n\r\ninterest  to  enhance social cohesion.  In  our  society,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  multi-racial and multi-religious, undoubtedly,\r\n\r\nwe  need  to examine the differences between the  various\r\n\r\nethnic  groups.  But let us not forget that we have  many\r\n\r\nthings  in  common too! For example, we  are  all  peace-loving  people, we love our family, we love  our  country\r\n\r\nand,  at  the same time, we like to celebrate the various\r\n\r\nfestivals.  Whether you are a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nChristian, a Buddhist, a Hindu or a Muslim, you would pay\r\n\r\na lot of attention to our respective ethnic and religious\r\n\r\nfestivals.   Just  as  we  enjoy our  reunion  dinner  on\r\n\r\nChinese New Year's Eve, our fellow citizens of the  other\r\n\r\nethnic    groups    enjoy   their   respective    festive\r\n\r\ncelebration.  However,  the joy and  happiness  of  these\r\n\r\nfestivals are not confined to our own community  only.  I\r\n\r\nam  sure  you have this experience.  During Hari Raya  or\r\n\r\nDeepavali,   you  would  have  your  Malay   and   Indian\r\n\r\nneighbours knocking  at your door and offering you  their\r\n\r\ntraditional  delicious kuehs and  tid-bits.   During  the\r\n\r\nChinese  New Year festivities, they may also turn  up  at\r\n\r\nyour  flat to wish you Happy New Year and enjoy your  new\r\n\r\nyear goodies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Christmas, Deepavali, Hari Raya and Chinese New\r\n\r\nYear  light-ups  are enjoyed by everyone,  not  just  the\r\n\r\nindividual  community. I am sure  all  of  us  enjoy  the\r\n\r\nfestive  mood. So, let us all live happily and peacefully\r\n\r\ntogether.  There are differences between us, but  let  us\r\n\r\nlook   more   at  our  similarities  and  less   at   our\r\n\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest that we periodically\r\n\r\nand  systematically create this kind of festive mood  for\r\n\r\nour  people. This is particularly useful in  our   multi-racial society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A foreign friend once told me that racial harmony in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is not bad.  But there seems to be a  lack  of\r\n\r\ncommunication and exchanges among the different cultures.\r\n\r\nEveryone seems to be living in their own quarters with no\r\n\r\nfeeling  for  other  communities.   He  may  be   a   bit\r\n\r\nexaggerating,  but it is true that quite  a  lot  of  our\r\n\r\npeople  are  not  showing interest and  concern  for  the\r\n\r\nhappenings  in the other communities. We should  try  and\r\n\r\nencourage  our  people to seek and get  into  the  common\r\n\r\nspace  among  us.  When  we are  faced  with  a  cultural\r\n\r\nconflict,  the more common points that we have discovered\r\n\r\namong  us,  the  easier  it would  be  to  iron  out  the\r\n\r\ndifferences  among  us.   So, if more  opportunities  are\r\n\r\ncreated   for  us  to  celebrate  the  various  festivals\r\n\r\ntogether, it would be useful for us to resolve the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndifferences,  if any.  We should learn to appreciate  our\r\n\r\ncounterparts   in   the  other  communities   for   their\r\n\r\ncontributions to our nation building, and make it a point\r\n\r\nto show such appreciation.  There could be more exchanges\r\n\r\namong the various cultures through various campaigns, get-togethers  and even through the media.  This  will  go  a\r\n\r\nlong way to enhance our social cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, allow me to present my views on some of the\r\n\r\nother  points  in  the  White Paper.   The  organisation,\r\n\r\nplanning  and  scheming of the terrorists  right  at  our\r\n\r\ndoorstep  are real and serious.  We should  also  have  a\r\n\r\nlong-term  plan to counter such threat to  our  security.\r\n\r\nThese  terrorist activities, if successful, would  impact\r\n\r\nnot  only  our  present generation, but also  our  future\r\n\r\ngenerations.  So, we should bring this White Paper to the\r\n\r\nschools   and   include  its  contents  to   the   school\r\n\r\ncurriculum,  according to the educational levels  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents.   We  could  simplify the  contents,  even  use\r\n\r\ncartoons  or comics to teach our students, so  that  they\r\n\r\nwould  also  know  and understand the activities  of  the\r\n\r\nterrorists.   One  day,  if  we  were  to  encounter   an\r\n\r\nunfortunate incident in Singapore, then our people  would\r\n\r\nbe psychologically prepared to face them, and would  have\r\n\r\nbetter  understanding  and tolerance  among  our  various\r\n\r\nethnic groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Muslim compatriots in Singapore are just as\r\n\r\npeace  loving  as we are.  We know that. Whether  we  are\r\n\r\nMalay, Indian or Chinese, we should trust one another and\r\n\r\nbe  united  to  fight  our  foreign  intruders  together.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  we would fall into the hands of  our  foreign\r\n\r\nintruders.  Let us settle all our differences through our\r\n\r\nsimilarities  and  common space.  Let us  be  united  and\r\n\r\nbuild  up our common aspirations, common wishes to settle\r\n\r\nthe differences in our society so that we can have better\r\n\r\nmutual tolerance, thereby enhancing our social cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  after more than 30 speeches,  I  have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt that many in this House may inadvertently feel that\r\n\r\nthey are suffering from an overdose of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  debate  on  terrorism.  Many of the statements  made\r\n\r\nwould,  by  now, have a familiar ring tone.  Nonetheless,\r\n\r\neven at the risk of sounding like a broken record, I feel\r\n\r\ncompelled to lend my voice to this chorus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since as MP of a constituency, I feel duty-bound to\r\n\r\nvoice  my opinion and the views I have gathered from  the\r\n\r\nresidents  of the community I represent on a  subject  of\r\n\r\nsuch  critical  importance.  I  therefore  beg  for  your\r\n\r\nindulgence, Sir, and Members of this House as I  give  my\r\n\r\nresponse to the White Paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion speaks of countering the terrorist\r\n\r\nthreat in a three-fold manner, like by enhancing security\r\n\r\nmeasures,  by  policing  the  spread  of  terrorism   and\r\n\r\nextremist  ideology,  and  by  strengthening  our  social\r\n\r\ncohesion  and  religious harmony.  Like my  parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues who have spoken before me, let me say, at  the\r\n\r\noutset,   that   I  support  this  motion   because   the\r\n\r\nconsequences of terrorism, if left unchecked,  are  grave\r\n\r\nand unimaginable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I applaud the Government for having the moral\r\n\r\ncourage  to table this motion to debate the White  Paper,\r\n\r\neven  though  it  may  once again  put  our  Malay/Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  under  the spotlight.  It is unfortunate,  but\r\n\r\nnot  unprecedented.  Recall the anguish  felt  among  the\r\n\r\nChinese community at the chauvinistic tactics employed by\r\n\r\nTang  Liang  Hong, two elections ago.  Each time,  issues\r\n\r\nlike  the Chinese Language, or Nantah, are brought up  in\r\n\r\nits various forms, a raw nerve is struck.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, like many of my parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues  before me, urge all Malay/Muslim Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  view  this debate positively.  It is not intended  to\r\n\r\nhighlight the Malay/Muslim community's deficiencies,  but\r\n\r\nto  air the issues in a calm and rational manner so that,\r\n\r\ncollectively, we may find solutions to the problems  that\r\n\r\nconfront  us all.  It is a mark of our nation's  maturity\r\n\r\nthat  we  can  openly  and honestly discuss  issues  like\r\n\r\nthese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, over the last two days, my\r\n\r\nparliamentary colleagues have freely\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbrought  and  frankly  discussed  numerous  awkward   and\r\n\r\nsensitive  issues  relating to race and  religion.   This\r\n\r\nattests   to   our  confidence  with  the   majority   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  with  regard to such  potentially  divisive\r\n\r\nissues.  It also reflects our beliefs in the strengths of\r\n\r\nour  inter-racial ties which have been painstakingly  and\r\n\r\ndeliberately cultivated over the last three decades.   It\r\n\r\nis  an  affirmation  that  the majority  of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nbelieve  in our multi-racial and multi-religious  compact\r\n\r\nand that they are moderate in their practice of religion,\r\n\r\nnot  just  Muslims,  but Buddhists, Taoists,  Christians,\r\n\r\nHindus and others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Economist in its November-December 2002 issue\r\n\r\naptly commented:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Secrecy and centralisation are useful watchwords in\r\n\r\na  conventional war ..  But if the war against  terrorism\r\n\r\nis  going  to  last  for years, the governments  need  to\r\n\r\nmobilise  their people.  The way to do that is  to  treat\r\n\r\nthem  as  adults  and  give them as much  information  as\r\n\r\npossible  without compromising sources of intelligence  - even if this does cause a few sleepless nights.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now offer my own perspectives on the\r\n\r\nresponses we need to take to combat the terrorist threat.\r\n\r\nI  suggest a four-pronged approach to JI, three of  which\r\n\r\necho  what  the  White  Paper proposes.   The  conceptual\r\n\r\nframework  is  that  of a series of enlarging  concentric\r\n\r\ncircles, with widening application and impact.  These are\r\n\r\nthe   four  P's  of  pre-emption  of  terrorist  strikes;\r\n\r\npropagation   of  Islamic  truth;  progression   of   the\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim community; and promotion of inter-ethnic and\r\n\r\nreligious harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, pre-emption of terrorist strikes. At the\r\n\r\ncentre  of  the  series of circles are the hard  security\r\n\r\nmeasures   we  need  to  take  to  prevent  and  pre-empt\r\n\r\nterrorist  strikes.  We need to improve the  security  of\r\n\r\nkey installations and targets.  We need to tighten border\r\n\r\ncontrols.  We need to choke off funds meant for financing\r\n\r\nterrorism.   We  need to have superior  intelligence  and\r\n\r\nsurveillance against the \"super-terrorism\" we are facing.\r\n\r\nI   am   comforted   that  the  Government   has   stated\r\n\r\nunequivocally in the White Paper that it has taken these\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsteps  and  more  to  harden Singapore against  terrorist\r\n\r\ninfiltration and attacks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government not to let up on these\r\n\r\nsecurity  measures  as  they  give  the  population   and\r\n\r\ninvestors alike assurance that Singapore is clearly among\r\n\r\nthe  safest  destination  in  the  region.   Indeed,  the\r\n\r\ninternational community working in Singapore  viewed  the\r\n\r\narrests  as  evidence of an effective security  apparatus\r\n\r\nthat  gives investors confidence in our country's ability\r\n\r\nto thwart all manner of threats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been murmurings about the long jams at\r\n\r\nthe  Tuas and Woodland Checkpoints.  But I strongly feel,\r\n\r\nand  I gather that many other Singaporeans also, that the\r\n\r\nstrict   border  checks  should  not  be  relaxed.    The\r\n\r\nresulting inconvenience is but a small price to  pay  for\r\n\r\nour social, economic and political security.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our homeland security lattice, no matter\r\n\r\nhow  sophisticated, can only do so much, because the  Al-Qaeda  threat is global, and therefore the front  against\r\n\r\nterrorism must likewise be global.  Our neighbours,  with\r\n\r\nsome  of  whom  we have occasional tiffs,  are  similarly\r\n\r\nvictims of terrorist attacks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that Southeast Asia nations will be able\r\n\r\nto put aside our differences to confront the common enemy\r\n\r\nthat can wreak havoc on our very existence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, propagation of Islamic truth. It has been\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the  war on terrorism is 95% ideological  and\r\n\r\nonly  5% military.  There is a Chinese proverb that says,\r\n\r\nzhan  cao chu gen.  We need to remove the sinister  roots\r\n\r\nfrom  which  the  terrorist tree grows and  cut  off  the\r\n\r\nsupply  of  new  recruits.  We need a counter-propaganda,\r\n\r\nnot  of  half-truth and twisted teachings that sowed  the\r\n\r\nseeds  of  JI.   We need to debunk the myth  that  \"true\"\r\n\r\nIslam  equals  fundamentalist and militant  Islam.   This\r\n\r\nwill not be easy.  Because, Islam, like Christianity,  is\r\n\r\nby  nature  monotheistic, preaching one way to salvation.\r\n\r\nFiery   itinerant  Islamic  teachers  and   mullahs,   if\r\n\r\nunchallenged  and  unfettered, may not  be  teaching  the\r\n\r\ncorrect interpretation of their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfaith  and,  indeed, even mislead people  into  believing\r\n\r\nthat jihad and martyrdom is the one-way ticket to heaven.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some influential western scholars, like Samuel\r\n\r\nHuntington,  have taken a pessimistic view  that  Islamic\r\n\r\nteaching  has  no  room for pluralism.   Instead,  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunalism will grow and lead to inter-religious  strife\r\n\r\nand  eventual  Balkanization, that is, disintegration  of\r\n\r\nthe   nation  state  along  religio-ethnic  lines.   That\r\n\r\nconception  cannot and should not remain unchallenged  by\r\n\r\nMuslims  in Singapore.  Otherwise, we risk the return  to\r\n\r\nthe  dark days of communal strife and the undoing of what\r\n\r\nour founding fathers have fought so hard to accomplish  - the  establishment  of  a  multi-racial,  multi-religious\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Therefore, the Malay/Muslim  community  must\r\n\r\naffirm the moderate non-sectarian nature of Islam and the\r\n\r\nnation-building role.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that, in recent days, shortly\r\n\r\nafter  the  release of the JI White Paper, many religious\r\n\r\nleaders and organisations from the Muslim community  have\r\n\r\ncome  forward to state their stand, and argue  for  self-governance,  and  to take the necessary steps  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat itinerant teachers and self-styled mullahs will  not\r\n\r\nbe  permitted to propagate heretical teaching and  poison\r\n\r\nthe   minds  of  our  younger  Muslims.   I  think   this\r\n\r\nproactive, firm and united stand has done much  to  allay\r\n\r\nany anxieties and prejudices the non-Muslim community may\r\n\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, progression of the Malay/Muslim community.\r\n\r\nSir,  the  White Paper has noted that the JI  network  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  comprised generally people  with  average,  or\r\n\r\nabove average, intelligence, and who cannot be classified\r\n\r\nas  being  socially disadvantaged.  Yet, one cannot  deny\r\n\r\nthat  the  risk  of being influenced by the  JI  movement\r\n\r\ncould  be  greater  among  the  weaker  members  of   the\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large issue facing us then is how to bring\r\n\r\nfurther  economic and social progress to this  community,\r\n\r\nin particular, to the weaker members of the community, so\r\n\r\nthat they do not feel left behind in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis  age of rapid gobalisation and technological  change\r\n\r\nand, therefore, become easier prey to deviant teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I am keenly aware of the sensitivity faced\r\n\r\nwhen we raise this question among our Muslim friends.  My\r\n\r\nparliamentary colleague, Mr Shanmugam, has spoken of this\r\n\r\non  Monday.  The reality is that each race has its  share\r\n\r\nof members who lag behind their compatriots, economically\r\n\r\nand  socially.   Sir,  I  am not  suggesting  affirmative\r\n\r\naction.   So,  in  this  sense,  I  am  not  even  mildly\r\n\r\nheretical.   In  fact,  I do not think  that  affirmative\r\n\r\naction  is  necessary at all.  This is  because,  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs has noted, the Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity in Singapore has, in many ways, made  its  mark\r\n\r\nin our society.  It has also been making great strides in\r\n\r\nclosing  any  gap with the other communities.   For  this\r\n\r\nreason,  I think what is needed is for self-help  groups,\r\n\r\nlike  Mendaki, to press on with their efforts, especially\r\n\r\nto  raise the educational attainments and quality of life\r\n\r\nof the weaker members of the Malay/Muslim community, thus\r\n\r\nfurther  uplifting and achieving higher overall  averages\r\n\r\nfor  the community.  Other self-help groups, such as CDAC\r\n\r\nand  SINDA, could also work together with Mendaki towards\r\n\r\nthis  end,  as an added, tangible sign of solidarity  and\r\n\r\nunity among the different races.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, promoting social and ethnic-religious\r\n\r\nharmony.   At the largest circumference of the  strategic\r\n\r\nframework  for tackling JI is the need to enhance  social\r\n\r\nharmony  among  the various ethnic and religious  groups.\r\n\r\nSir,  the need to do so is really unquestionable.  Social\r\n\r\nand  religious harmony are seeds that must be sown in all\r\n\r\nareas  of  public life in Singapore - schools, workplaces\r\n\r\nand  communities.  The national schools,  in  particular,\r\n\r\nare undoubtedly the crucible for multi-racial living.  We\r\n\r\nmust teach our children to be colour blind, and celebrate\r\n\r\nharmony  amidst diversity.  More activities  designed  to\r\n\r\npromote  racial and religious harmony should be  planned.\r\n\r\nFor  instance,  there  could be more designated  projects\r\n\r\nrelated  to  our  cultural and religious diversity  where\r\n\r\nstudents of different races are required to work together\r\n\r\nin groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should encourage and create opportunities for\r\n\r\nstudents of different races to interact and make  friends\r\n\r\nwith  each  other  from as young an age as  possible;  in\r\n\r\nfact, from pre-school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to watch out for the unwitting\r\n\r\nformation  of  enclaves  in  schools  because  groups  of\r\n\r\nstudents  may unconsciously clique and engage each  other\r\n\r\nin   a  particular  language,  and  thus  could  alienate\r\n\r\nstudents  of other races, who may otherwise feel  out  of\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is natural for people of the same colour to\r\n\r\ncongregate.   We  do  so overseas to gain  a  measure  of\r\n\r\nsecurity and for purposes of identification.  But,  doing\r\n\r\nso  in  Singapore, could also raise social  barriers  and\r\n\r\nhamper more meaningful inter-racial interaction.  Certain\r\n\r\nsports,  like basketball or sepak takraw, tend to attract\r\n\r\nparticipation  from specific groups in schools.   Without\r\n\r\nrestricting  choice, schools must make  every  effort  to\r\n\r\ncomplement  such  propensities  for  specific  groups  to\r\n\r\ncoalesce  around  certain sports and  games,  with  other\r\n\r\nactivities that have wider appeal to all races.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the community level, grassroots organisations and\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders  must likewise be  committed  to  the\r\n\r\nmulti-racial ideal in planning activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is commonly observed that Malays are under\r\n\r\nrepresented  in grassroots organisations.  The  non-Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity,   especially  the  Chinese  majority,   should\r\n\r\nredouble  their  efforts  to  reach  out  to  the   Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity  and  make them feel comfortable.   They  would\r\n\r\nhave  to get rid of any residual practices and prejudices\r\n\r\nthey  may have, which may hinder Malays from joining  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations and cause them  to  concentrate\r\n\r\nalmost exclusively on their own mosque-based activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, though the incidence of this today\r\n\r\ncould  be  considerably lower than before, I do  hear  of\r\n\r\ncomplaints from the non-Chinese community that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsome   grassroots  organisations  still   conduct   their\r\n\r\nmeetings    in   Chinese,   without   formally   offering\r\n\r\ntranslations  in  the other languages.   There  are  also\r\n\r\ncomplaints that some non-Muslim grassroots leaders  still\r\n\r\nremain  insensitive to the Muslim's food requirements  at\r\n\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These perceived prejudices, if unchecked, could\r\n\r\ndrive a wedge between the Malay/Muslim community, already\r\n\r\nforced  into an uncomfortable period of introspection  by\r\n\r\nthe  JI  events  and  the  other  races,  especially  the\r\n\r\nChinese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having Singaporeans of different races and religion\r\n\r\ndining  together  and  visiting each  other's  places  of\r\n\r\nworship   is   definitely  a  good   start   to   greater\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of the different races and  religion.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  when I was in Florida last December, I read,  with\r\n\r\nsome  satisfaction  in the local newspaper,  that  in  an\r\n\r\nattempt to imbue greater understanding about Americans of\r\n\r\ndifferent religions, the Muslim organisations in  Florida\r\n\r\nare  initiating visits to different places of worship for\r\n\r\nAmericans  of  all  creed.  However, attempts  to  foster\r\n\r\ngreater  understanding and confidence among the different\r\n\r\nraces  and  religions clearly cannot stop at this  rather\r\n\r\nsymbolic  and significant superficial level.   Confidence\r\n\r\nand  trust in a person can only be built when we  get  to\r\n\r\nknow  each other personally, and the best way to  achieve\r\n\r\nthis  is through working with each other.  Hence, at  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  level,  we must encourage  more  residents  of\r\n\r\ndifferent races and religions to come forward to work  on\r\n\r\ncommunity projects together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, in my constituency, Malay and non-Malay grassroots leaders admitted that they have come to\r\n\r\nunderstand  each other much better after working  closely\r\n\r\ntogether  on a New Year Charity Lunch project  for  needy\r\n\r\nresidents  of  all  races, where they personally  had  to\r\n\r\nprepare  lunch  for  the  residents.   There  were   some\r\n\r\ntensions in the first year when they organised the lunch,\r\n\r\nas   the   non-Muslims  did  not  fully  appreciate   the\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  the Muslims regarding food  preparation\r\n\r\nand  cooking.  They felt that the Muslims were just being\r\n\r\ndifficult and uncompromising.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, which is the second time they are\r\n\r\norganising the lunch, the tension has dissipated, through\r\n\r\ngreater  understanding and a give-and-take attitude,  and\r\n\r\nnow  there is even greater rapport and camaraderie as the\r\n\r\ndifferent races work together for the common good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the individual level, I urge all Singaporeans to\r\n\r\nextend  common  courtesies to one another, especially  to\r\n\r\nthose  of other races, since as a friend of mine quipped,\r\n\r\n\"Inadvertently, in a multi-racial society like ours, each\r\n\r\nof  us  is an ambassador of our own race.\"  For instance,\r\n\r\nHDB  flat dwellers, and even office workers, who  are  in\r\n\r\nthe  lift  together,  can smile  and  greet  each  other,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  staring  at the floor,  at  the  lift  floor\r\n\r\nindicator,  or worse of all, at the ceiling, which  seems\r\n\r\nto be the lift habit of most Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Code of Religious Harmony\r\n\r\nproposed by the Prime Minister as a means to highlight to\r\n\r\nall   religious  leaders  that  peace  on  earth  is  not\r\n\r\nincompatible with peace in heaven.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the IRCC and Harmony Circles will need to\r\n\r\ncontinue their efforts to promote understanding and inter-religious   or,   as   some  one   has   termed,   inter-civilisational dialogue.  Such dialogue can  be  expanded\r\n\r\nfrom   the  conventional  ones  of  philosophy,  history,\r\n\r\nculture and those in the humanities, to other aspects  of\r\n\r\nhuman  life,  since Islam is concerned with the  complete\r\n\r\nway of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, a truly meaningful common action agenda\r\n\r\namong  the  various ethnic and religious  groups  can  be\r\n\r\nformulated  and  carried out in the near future  for  the\r\n\r\nbetterment of all men, women and children, regardless  of\r\n\r\nthe  colour of their skin or the religious headgear  they\r\n\r\nwear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, as the Minister for Home Affairs\r\n\r\nhas noted, some Singaporeans have questioned if we should\r\n\r\nkeep  revisiting this subject; if it might not be  better\r\n\r\nto  go  about  our  daily lives, rather  than  inevitably\r\n\r\nputting the spotlight on the Malay/Muslim community  each\r\n\r\ntime  we  talk  about September 11, the  JI  arrests  and\r\n\r\nterrorism.  They fear that this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincessant   reminder   could  instead   become   negative\r\n\r\nreinforcement.  However, as noted by Rohan Gunaratna, the\r\n\r\nbattle  against terrorism has barely just begun.   It  is\r\n\r\nlikely  to be a persistent flu bug that is hard to  shake\r\n\r\noff and, if left alone to fester, could turn fatal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Racial and religious harmony, as history and\r\n\r\nexperience  have shown, is not a natural phenomenon.   It\r\n\r\nis  far  more natural for people of the same skin colour,\r\n\r\ncreed  and  language,  to  feel  an  affinity  and   thus\r\n\r\ncongregate.  Hence, we must continue to actively  promote\r\n\r\nsocial harmony among Singaporeans of different races  and\r\n\r\nreligions in response to the terrorist challenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this multi-religious and multi-ethnic ecosystem\r\n\r\nwe  currently  have is man-made, as with many  things  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, we must continue to maintain and improve  upon\r\n\r\nit.   Left alone unattended, it will start to fall  apart\r\n\r\nif  extremism starts to gnaw at its seams.  The reminders\r\n\r\nand  debate  about  the  dangers  of  allowing  extremist\r\n\r\nelements into our shores must therefore continue, as  the\r\n\r\nbattle  is  far from over and is likely to  be  long  and\r\n\r\narduous.   Furthermore, this battle is not a conventional\r\n\r\nbattle.   It  is a contest over ideologies,  over  values\r\n\r\nand,  therefore, must be fought on all fronts  and  would\r\n\r\nrequire  the  help of every Singaporean - yellow,  brown,\r\n\r\nblack or white.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I wholeheartedly support the\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore prides itself as an open economy. It is\r\n\r\nan  undeniable  fact that we have prospered  and  got  to\r\n\r\nwhere  we  are  today by being a very open society.   Our\r\n\r\npeople  had moved ahead by assimilating the best  of  the\r\n\r\nEast  and the West.  Whether it is the best practices  in\r\n\r\nbusiness,  technology,  the  arts  or  fashion,  we  have\r\n\r\nlearned,  absorbed, and localised it into something  that\r\n\r\nis  distinctly Singapore.  But, as with all things,  with\r\n\r\nan  open  economy, we take in both the good and the  bad.\r\n\r\nWhile it was sobering to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  learn  of  global  terrorism,  it   was\r\n\r\nshocking to discover that the brand of militant Islam has\r\n\r\ninfiltrated into our region, and into Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper has so clearly put forth that\r\n\r\ncertain  members of our citizenry have been indoctrinated\r\n\r\nwith these virulent teachings.  They saw no contradiction\r\n\r\nbetween living in a prosperous and harmonious society  of\r\n\r\nours,  while  serving  in  a militant  group  that  would\r\n\r\ndestroy  any society and anyone that does not believe  in\r\n\r\ntheir brand of religion.  In their pursuit of achieving a\r\n\r\nsupra-national  goal,  they  are  prepared  to  sacrifice\r\n\r\nlives,   regardless  of  race  or  religion.   They   are\r\n\r\ndangerous  people who could, in just one act of violence,\r\n\r\ndestroy  what  several generations  of  Singaporeans  had\r\n\r\nbuilt  and  achieved.   We stand to  lose  a  lot.   They\r\n\r\nthreaten  our  way of life and threaten the open  society\r\n\r\nwhich  is vital for Singapore's prosperity.  We stand  to\r\n\r\nlose  the confidence of international investors.   As  we\r\n\r\nmake  Singapore  into a more diversified  and  knowledge-based  economy,  all  the more we  need  to  attract  the\r\n\r\nforeign talents and investments.  Many jobs are dependent\r\n\r\non the stability and the continued assurance of stability\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   Our  pillar of  inter-racial  trust  and\r\n\r\ntolerance that has served us so well - all races  working\r\n\r\ntogether  towards  the  goal of a  meritocratic  society,\r\n\r\nequal   opportunities  for  all,   an   upward   mobility\r\n\r\nirrespective  of  our  current  station  in  life  -   is\r\n\r\nthreatened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in essence, we stand to lose\r\n\r\nthe future for our children.  It is a shock that Al-Qaeda\r\n\r\nlinked  elements are in our midst.  So, we must send  the\r\n\r\nmessage,  far  and  wide, down to every  level,  reaching\r\n\r\nevery member of the Singapore family, the severity of the\r\n\r\nissue  confronting  us.   Whilst the  initial  shock  and\r\n\r\ndisbelief  may  have diminished over time, this  security\r\n\r\nissue, and the implications, cannot be brushed aside  and\r\n\r\nwished away.  Many Singaporeans still think it will  just\r\n\r\ngo  away.  Well, it is not a sudden apparition that would\r\n\r\ndisappear  with the blink of an eye.  As the White  Paper\r\n\r\nhas traced the origins, this strain of terrorism\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhas   mutated   and  festered  around  the   region   and\r\n\r\ncontaminated our shores a decade ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we may have crippled the in-country JI cells,\r\n\r\nthe  region  around  us continues to  remain  hotbeds  of\r\n\r\nterrorism.   While  some  governments  are  hampered   by\r\n\r\ndomestic agenda, others continue to offer sanctuaries  to\r\n\r\nthese  terrorists,  and the sources  of  this  fanaticism\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  provide the spiritual,  organisational  and\r\n\r\nfinancial  support  to  continue  to  subvert  legitimate\r\n\r\ngovernments and societies, Singapore cannot let its guard\r\n\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot ring-fence Singapore. As such, I believe\r\n\r\nit  is  time to impress on one and all that in  order  to\r\n\r\nkeep terrorism away from our shores, it requires each and\r\n\r\nevery one of us to do our part.  As a people, we must  be\r\n\r\nprepared to take the long-term view and take the measures\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that we preserve the society, as we  know  it\r\n\r\nnow.   Let  us not delude ourselves that there are  quick\r\n\r\nfixes  or, worse, believe that the issue has been  fixed.\r\n\r\nAs  a  phenomenon  that originated from  the  pan-Islamic\r\n\r\nrevivalist  movement from the Middle East and  its  reach\r\n\r\nfuelled  by  petro-dollars, the  transnational  terrorist\r\n\r\nnetwork  of Al-Qaeda and its JI associates will be  major\r\n\r\nsecurity challenges for years to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, while I hear some quarters talk about alienating\r\n\r\ndecent people, about the uncomfortable glare of directing\r\n\r\nthe spotlight on certain segments of our population, bear\r\n\r\nin mind that we have no other options.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The security threat is real. The JI members in\r\n\r\nSingapore  had  gone  for  military  training;  organised\r\n\r\nthemselves for subversive action and had even met  fellow\r\n\r\nactivists in the region secretly in order that  they  may\r\n\r\nharness and direct resources and efforts towards the harm\r\n\r\nof  our fellow citizens.  We have to expose these people;\r\n\r\ntake  long-term measures to ensure any others are  rooted\r\n\r\nout  and ensure new ones have little chance to take  root\r\n\r\non our shores and spawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like my other parliamentary colleagues, I\r\n\r\napplaud the steps taken by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe Government to safeguard our key installations.  These\r\n\r\nmeasures must be continued to ensure that we are  a  hard\r\n\r\ntarget.  The enemy is cunning and evolving.  Inter-agency\r\n\r\ncooperation  must  be  enhanced;  new  organisations  and\r\n\r\ninstitutions formed, and our Government must ensure  that\r\n\r\nwe  have the latest technology and informational tools to\r\n\r\ncombat this enemy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond physical security, we have to raise national\r\n\r\nawareness,  keep our guard up and act with  one  resolve.\r\n\r\nEach  of us has a role.  Now that there is full awareness\r\n\r\nof  the  insidious nature of the JI operatives,  we  must\r\n\r\nlook  out  for instances of aberrant and deviant pockets.\r\n\r\nWe must be vigilant at all times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only through the information of one concerned\r\n\r\nSingaporean that ISD had the first specific lead on Aslam\r\n\r\nand  from  that point, the whole JI network in  Singapore\r\n\r\nunravelled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe vigilance must be practised at different\r\n\r\nlevels  to be effective.  While the Government  will  not\r\n\r\nlet  up  on  its stringent vigilance, I believe religious\r\n\r\nbodies,  parents  and  families can play  very  important\r\n\r\nroles in this challenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be assured of the vigilance of the religious\r\n\r\nbodies.   Why  religious bodies?  Because we are  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  an extremist ideology and in this current instance,\r\n\r\nit  happens to be a deviant strain of Islam.   But  under\r\n\r\ndifferent circumstances, it could happen under the  guise\r\n\r\nof  any  other religion.  History has ample  examples  of\r\n\r\nextremists using religion as cover for their activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, all religious bodies must take stock and be\r\n\r\non  the lookout for attempts to use their religious bases\r\n\r\nfor   political  agenda.   In  the  White  Paper  on  the\r\n\r\nMaintenance  of Religious Harmony in 1989, the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  had clearly stated the principle of  rigorous\r\n\r\nseparation of religion and politics.  Thirteen years  on,\r\n\r\nthis  is still as valid and must be strictly adhered  to.\r\n\r\nOur  religious bodies must find avenues to reaffirm  this\r\n\r\ncommitment in order that Singapore can continue to  enjoy\r\n\r\ninter-racial harmony.  No one should\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntake  advantage  of the religious freedom that  Singapore\r\n\r\npractises to perpetuate other foreign agenda.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religious bodies and leaders must have their feelers\r\n\r\nout to detect those who stray and have ways to draw these\r\n\r\nfollowers  back into their folds or choke off support  so\r\n\r\nthat virulent teachings do not spread.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message to our Muslim citizens is very clear - you are not alone in tackling misguided individuals\r\n\r\nintent  on  using  religion for  extremist  acts.   Every\r\n\r\nreligion  is  at risk and every religious  body  must  be\r\n\r\nalert  and proactive in ensuring their followers stay  on\r\n\r\ntheir religious paths.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the vigilance of Government and religious\r\n\r\nbodies,    parents   and   families   must   also    take\r\n\r\nresponsibility.   While  the JI detainees  are  above  28\r\n\r\nyears,   we  know  that  some  of  the  more  charismatic\r\n\r\nreligious leaders were able to penetrate homes  and  took\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  teaching platforms  to  proselytise  their\r\n\r\nextremist  views.  Only parental good sense and  judgment\r\n\r\nwould  ferret  out  these imposters  and  eliminate  this\r\n\r\navenue of contamination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else can we do to enhance our social cohesion\r\n\r\nso  that  we  can  confront and manage  any  events  that\r\n\r\nthreaten to tear us apart?  The respect that we must have\r\n\r\nfor each other's religions and cultural spaces cannot  be\r\n\r\nunder-estimated.   We  must continue  to  take  steps  to\r\n\r\nensure  that our entire social fabric remains strong  and\r\n\r\nintact.   The  advent  of the IRCCs and  Harmony  Circles\r\n\r\nalready  provide  us  with  the  tools  to  develop   the\r\n\r\ncontinued understanding and rapport amongst our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This inter-racial, inter-cultural and inter-religious understanding and rapport is very important.\r\n\r\nIt is all too easy to take a simplistic view of this, but\r\n\r\nwe  cannot.   We  have  our very own unique  pluralistic,\r\n\r\nsecular  and multi-racial identity that we must  preserve\r\n\r\nat  all costs.  Any dismantling of this will lead to  our\r\n\r\ndownfall.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot fully anticipate what would hit us next.\r\n\r\nThe foe will certainly evolve new strategies to undermine\r\n\r\nsecurity and stability even as we take measures to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfortify ourselves.  But if we can build this great  sense\r\n\r\nof  unity  as one people - investing time and  effort  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  our fellow citizens better, accommodate  each\r\n\r\nother  with all outward manifestation and affirmation  of\r\n\r\nsupport  for  each other - then can we  tackle  any  such\r\n\r\nthreats  as  one  united people with no  in-fighting.   I\r\n\r\nsecond the call by so many hon. Members that this is  the\r\n\r\ntime  to  drop  any reservations, come out from  all  our\r\n\r\ncomfort zones and erase any fault lines between the races\r\n\r\nby  all  of  us getting into the mainstream of  Singapore\r\n\r\nsociety.  It is with this national fortitude that we  can\r\n\r\nweather  any  threats that threaten our social  cohesion.\r\n\r\nIn  many ways, this is a call to Total Defence for  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While many of us serve National Service and are\r\n\r\nequipped with the skills to defend the sovereignty of our\r\n\r\nnation,   every  Singaporean  can  also  participate   in\r\n\r\nNational Service on a daily basis through:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;full hearted participation in the IRCCs and Harmony\r\n\r\nCircles, giving life to the ideals of these bodies;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;build on the trust and respect that we have for each\r\n\r\nother;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do our part to ensure foreign subversive elements do\r\n\r\nnot drive wedges among us; and, finally,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;build our \"internal strength\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a long road. I had begun by saying that we\r\n\r\nmust  take  a  long-term view.   We  must  persevere.   I\r\n\r\nreiterate  that there are no quick fixes and it  requires\r\n\r\nhard  work  on  everyone's part.  Let us be  prepared  to\r\n\r\ndefend  what  we  have.  Pull together and  redouble  our\r\n\r\nefforts.  Again, I repeat, we have no other options.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

As the last person in the long list of speakers,\r\n\r\nI  find  that almost all the points I want to raise  have\r\n\r\nbeen touched on by the Members. Nevertheless, in view  of\r\n\r\nthe  importance  and significance of the White  Paper,  I\r\n\r\nmust still show my support for the motion by the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Home Affairs. I will briefly touch on five aspects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the release of the White Paper is a\r\n\r\nreflection of the high degree of transparency on the part\r\n\r\nof  the Government. At a dialogue session of the Feedback\r\n\r\nUnit, many participants endorsed and commended the manner\r\n\r\nin  which  the Government tackled the matter,  and  hoped\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  will do likewise  in  other  major\r\n\r\nissues  and  policy-making.   From the  reaction  of  the\r\n\r\npeople, we observe that our society has matured,  and  we\r\n\r\nare  able  to openly discuss sensitive issues  like  this\r\n\r\nwithout incurring any intense reaction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should commend and reward the officers\r\n\r\nof  the  Home Ministry for their contribution, especially\r\n\r\nthe  ISD  officers.   They  are the  unsung  heroes.  But\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the secret nature of their work,  we  cannot\r\n\r\nopenly  commend them.  And I hope that they will  receive\r\n\r\nsome form of appropriate commendation and reward.  At the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  we  must ensure that they are provided  with\r\n\r\nenough  manpower and resources in order to continue  with\r\n\r\ntheir  arduous responsibility of safeguarding our  social\r\n\r\nstability and  national security.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we should not direct our spear or point our\r\n\r\nfingers at the Muslim community.  This is unfair to  them\r\n\r\nbecause maintaining racial and religious harmony  is  the\r\n\r\nduty  and  responsibility of everyone. These JI activists\r\n\r\nare just a handful of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndangerous  elements.  They do not  represent  the  entire\r\n\r\nMuslim community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the big Singapore family, we have to\r\n\r\nbe united to support our Muslim brethren.  Although there\r\n\r\nare certain non-Muslim people who have a wrong perception\r\n\r\nof  the  Muslim  community, we need  to  correct  such  a\r\n\r\nmisconception.   We  have to try to make  the  non-Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  understand that our Muslim brethren are  peace\r\n\r\nloving  and  patriotic fellow citizens. We must  exercise\r\n\r\ntolerance  towards them.  We should not fault  the  whole\r\n\r\ncommunity just because of a few black sheep among them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to tell a story. In the Sung Dynasty,\r\n\r\nthere  was this great writer by the name of Su Dongpo.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve you must have heard of his name.  He was a devout\r\n\r\nBuddhist  and had a good friend who was a Buddhist  monk,\r\n\r\nnamed  Fo Yin.  The two of them enjoyed debating  on  the\r\n\r\nteachings of Buddha.  One day, while they were practising\r\n\r\nmeditation, Su Dongpo asked the Rev. Fo Yin, \"What  do  I\r\n\r\nlook  like?\"  His monk friend answered, \"You are  like  a\r\n\r\nBuddha.\"  Su Dongpo was very pleased to hear that.  After\r\n\r\na  while,  the  monk friend asked him, \"What  do  I  look\r\n\r\nlike?\"  Su  Dongpo thought it was a good opportunity  for\r\n\r\nhim to make fun of his friend. He said, \"You look like  a\r\n\r\nheap  of  cow  dung!\"  When Fo Yin heard  this,  he  said\r\n\r\nnothing  and  smilingly nodded his head.  Su  Dongpo  was\r\n\r\nvery  pleased with himself, thinking that he  had  won  a\r\n\r\nbattle of wits against Fo Yin.  When he returned home, he\r\n\r\nboasted to his younger sister, Su Xiao Xiao, how  he  had\r\n\r\nwon  over  Fo Yin.  On hearing this, Su Xiao  Xiao  said,\r\n\r\n\"Brother, you are wrong.  You have actually lost  to  the\r\n\r\nRev. Fo Yin.  Because Fo Yin's mind was full of Buddhism;\r\n\r\nwhat  he saw before him was nothing but Buddha.  But your\r\n\r\nmind  was full of cow dung, that is why you only saw  cow\r\n\r\ndung.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, how should our non-Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunities  perceive the Muslim community?   A  mind  of\r\n\r\nBuddha, or a mind full of cow dung?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Muslim community should also make\r\n\r\ntheir  stand clear to all Singaporeans.  They  should  be\r\n\r\nexplicit in their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstand  and  draw  a  line  between  themselves  and   the\r\n\r\nextremists.   They should not let the other people  think\r\n\r\nthat  since they are Muslims, they would sympathise  with\r\n\r\nthe  JI  because of their religion.  Therefore,  I  fully\r\n\r\nsupport  our Malay MPs and the Muslim leaders  for  their\r\n\r\nstatements.   But  more  has  to  be  done.   The  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity leaders should explain to all Singaporeans  how\r\n\r\ndo  they  practise their religious teaching in  a  multi-racial,  multi-religious  society,  and  how  they  would\r\n\r\nstrive  to integrate with the mainstream to make  greater\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  our society.  They should  ensure  that\r\n\r\ntheir  followers would not make narrow interpretation  of\r\n\r\nIslam  and shut themselves up in their cocoon, alienating\r\n\r\nfrom society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my conversation with the people, certain Chinese\r\n\r\nare  quite confused on certain religious issues, eg,  the\r\n\r\nwearing  of  the  tudung.  They asked me  whether  it  is\r\n\r\ncompulsory  for  Muslim women to  wear  the  tudung,  and\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is true that when wearing the  tudung,  they\r\n\r\ncannot  shake hands with other people.  They are confused\r\n\r\nabout these issues.  So, if we want to make progress,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  make a breakthrough. When the non-Muslims  open\r\n\r\ntheir arms to welcome the Muslims, the Muslims should  be\r\n\r\nopen  minded and be prepared to work together to  achieve\r\n\r\ngreater religious harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the JI incident must certainly be an eye\r\n\r\nopener   for  all  the  religious  groups  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I fully support the religious leaders' attempt\r\n\r\nto  formulate a code of conduct governing their religious\r\n\r\nteaching.  We should not mix politics with religion.   We\r\n\r\nhave  to  emphasise the social functions of religion  and\r\n\r\nurge   all   the   religions  to  fulfill  their   social\r\n\r\nobligations.  Water can float a boat;  it can also sink a\r\n\r\nboat.  Religion can do the same to our society and to our\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For human beings, clean water is a basic necessity\r\n\r\nto  sustain life.  Frequent drinking of water can cleanse\r\n\r\nout  all the toxins in our body.  A good religion is like\r\n\r\npure water.  It can cleanse up the soul of a human being.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  the  universal love of  Christianity,  the\r\n\r\nmercifulness of Buddhism, the appeal for charity and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngood  conduct of Taoism, and the peace advocated by Islam\r\n\r\n-  all these are aimed at making one a better person  and\r\n\r\nto lead a positive way of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, impure water will bring about\r\n\r\ndiseases.   If  a  cup of water has been  poisoned,  when\r\n\r\ndrunk,  it will slowly damage the nervous system, kidney,\r\n\r\nliver and, eventually, cause death.  A religion that  has\r\n\r\nbeen  distorted  and  misused by other  people  can  also\r\n\r\nslowly  corrode our mind and we can be led astray  to  do\r\n\r\nthings  which are detrimental to ourselves and  to  other\r\n\r\npeople, just like what the JI has done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a higher plane, for example, rainwater can bring\r\n\r\nmoisture to the earth, bring forth all living things.  If\r\n\r\nwater  is  properly controlled, it can irrigate land  and\r\n\r\ngenerate electricity.  But, on the other hand, a  rampant\r\n\r\nflood  and inundation will cause devastation to land  and\r\n\r\nproperties,  and  even loss of lives.   Religion  is  the\r\n\r\nsame.   Good religions serve to cleanse our mind and  the\r\n\r\nfollowers  are urged to engage in charity work and  bring\r\n\r\ngood  to  society.  Therefore, we must endorse  what  the\r\n\r\nreligious  groups have done in Singapore, in  setting  up\r\n\r\nhospitals,  nursing homes and other social welfare  work.\r\n\r\nThey  offer services to people, regardless of their race,\r\n\r\nlanguage or religion.  Such social services will help  to\r\n\r\npromote religious harmony and mutual trust, and serve  to\r\n\r\npromote prosperity of the nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if a religion is solely\r\n\r\npreoccupied with its evangelical work and increasing  its\r\n\r\nfold  or,  worse,  if it is misused by other  undesirable\r\n\r\nelements,  it will bring about social disintegration  and\r\n\r\nthe  break-up  of  the  nation.  Therefore,  the  various\r\n\r\nreligious  leaders,  whether  Buddhist,  Hindu,   Muslim,\r\n\r\nChristian  or  Taoist, should constantly be mindful  that\r\n\r\nthe  JI  incidents could well be repeated  in  their  own\r\n\r\nreligion.   Therefore, they should be   vigilant  against\r\n\r\nthese  undesirable  elements which  twist  the  religious\r\n\r\nteachings to incite hatred, and harm the social  security\r\n\r\nand peace.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a multi-religious society like ours, we have to\r\n\r\nemphasise  the  common ground, and not  the  differences.\r\n\r\nMore  important is that we should respect  the  faith  of\r\n\r\nothers when we engage in evangelical work.  We should not\r\n\r\ndenigrate   other  religions.   When   they   carry   out\r\n\r\nevangelical work, they should curb the excessive zeal  of\r\n\r\ntheir  followers, so as not to hurt the feelings of other\r\n\r\nreligious groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a saying, \"Be magnanimous to others,\r\n\r\nbut  be  strict to oneself.\"  We should not expect  other\r\n\r\npeople  to respect us when we ourselves do not  show  our\r\n\r\nrespect  to them.  Therefore, we have to be exemplary  in\r\n\r\nour  conduct, whether we are Chinese, Malays or  Indians.\r\n\r\nAs  long  as we are Singaporeans, whether we are Muslims,\r\n\r\nChristians, Buddhists or Hindus, every one of  us  should\r\n\r\nlearn  to become a better person, eg, respect others,  be\r\n\r\nconsiderate to others, show concern to others, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only when we have won the respect of others\r\n\r\ncan  we  influence  them  so as  to  reform  society.   A\r\n\r\nharmonious and gracious society starts from the heart  of\r\n\r\nthe  people.   It  cannot be achieved through  Government\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I see no need for this role. Our\r\n\r\nhon. Members have had three days of debate on this, and I\r\n\r\nwill  not try to agonise them further.  But if they  bear\r\n\r\nwith  me, I will just spend a bit of time to try to round\r\n\r\nup  what all the hon. Members have said in the last three\r\n\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nthank  all the Members of this House for expressing their\r\n\r\nviews  on  the White Paper and for their strong  support,\r\n\r\nacross all the parties, for the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years ahead, the broad recommendations in the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper will have to be implemented effectively  and\r\n\r\nsensibly,  and  in  concrete terms - practical  measures.\r\n\r\nBut let me state this very clearly.  The White Paper does\r\n\r\nnot offer a panacea for the complete and permanent\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neradication  of the terrorist threat that we  are  facing\r\n\r\ntoday.  The White Paper's recommendations are actions  we\r\n\r\ncan  develop and pursue domestically.  These actions  are\r\n\r\nnecessary.   But we must not be under any illusion  that,\r\n\r\nby  themselves,  they are enough.  For one  thing,  as  I\r\n\r\nmentioned  in my speech two days ago, this  is  a  threat\r\n\r\nwhich is rooted outside Singapore.  The threat cannot  be\r\n\r\neliminated  by  Singapore's action alone.   Domestically,\r\n\r\nthe   recommendations  in  the  White  Paper   are   just\r\n\r\ndirections  which we can develop and pursue.   But,  even\r\n\r\nthen,  these  do not foreclose any other good  ideas,  or\r\n\r\noptions,  or suggestions or avenues which may be  helpful\r\n\r\nin dealing with this terrorist threat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to enhance security, we will continue to make\r\n\r\nourselves  a harder target for the terrorists.   We  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  develop strong, practical  and  sustainable\r\n\r\ndefensive measures.  Some inconvenience to our life, such\r\n\r\nas  traffic  jams at the checkpoints, cannot be  avoided.\r\n\r\nIt  is a price worth paying for better security.  I share\r\n\r\nMr  Chiam See Tong's view that even one bomb going off in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  one  bomb  too many.   But  there  are  no\r\n\r\nguarantees  - such as the one sought by Mr Steve  Chia  - which  can  insure Singaporeans against the  violence  of\r\n\r\nterrorism,  whether  it  is  spotted  outside  or  inside\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Indeed,  as several Members  of  the  House,\r\n\r\nincluding   Mrs   Lim   Hwee  Hua,   alluded   to,   more\r\n\r\nrealistically,  Singaporeans must get involved  and  take\r\n\r\nownership  of  this  national  threat  to  our  security,\r\n\r\nbecause  it confronts all of us - Muslims and non-Muslims\r\n\r\nalike.  Singaporeans cannot afford to hold the complacent\r\n\r\nbelief  that  the  Government  will  always  insure  them\r\n\r\nagainst a terrorist incident - that there can never be  a\r\n\r\nbomb  going off in Singapore.  No government can  provide\r\n\r\nthis  assurance,  no  matter how  well  prepared  it  is.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  like  the  young people  whom  Prof.  Chin\r\n\r\nreferred  to,  do themselves a disservice,  if  they  are\r\n\r\napathetic  and leave it to the Government  to  deal  with\r\n\r\nthis  threat alone.  Neither can they afford  to  believe\r\n\r\nthat  this  threat is not real, like some  of  those  who\r\n\r\nattended  the  Feedback Unit's session and who  expressed\r\n\r\ndoubt about the genuineness of this JI case.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both groups, if they have no sense of the clear and\r\n\r\npresent danger terrorism poses to their life, will  be  a\r\n\r\nliability  to  our  national effort to instill  vigilance\r\n\r\nagainst  this  threat.  Whether it is the  fight  against\r\n\r\ncrime or drugs or, in our present case, the fight against\r\n\r\nterrorism, it is citizens' involvement and support  which\r\n\r\nare  vital.   The  strongest  defensive  measure  in  any\r\n\r\ncountry against terrorism is always the vigilance and the\r\n\r\nresilience of its citizens and residents.  This can  come\r\n\r\nabout  only  if  citizens  share  in  the  concerns  over\r\n\r\nterrorism  and take ownership in helping to  tackle  this\r\n\r\nthreat.  And I agree with Mr Gan Kim Yong that we  should\r\n\r\nprepare  our people on what to do when a bomb  should  go\r\n\r\noff.   We  will  do  this  through  a  national  security\r\n\r\nawareness  campaign  or programme  starting  next  month.\r\n\r\nBut,  have  no  illusions about it  too.   No  number  of\r\n\r\ncampaigns  or amount of national education is enough,  if\r\n\r\nthe people themselves do not treat this threat seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the concern of a Muslim Singaporean who gave\r\n\r\nthe  crucial  lead  to  ISD's uncovering  of  the  Jemaah\r\n\r\nIslamiyah in December 2001.  He is not alone.  There have\r\n\r\nbeen many like him who have felt that sense of civic duty\r\n\r\nto   step  forward  and  report  what  they  believe  are\r\n\r\npotential security threats.  Since September 11, we  have\r\n\r\nreceived numerous reports from the public which have been\r\n\r\nhelpful  in  the  work  of our law enforcement  agencies.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we have also received numerous hoaxes  and\r\n\r\npranks   which  have  strained  and  wasted  our  limited\r\n\r\npolicing resources.  That is why the police will  take  a\r\n\r\nvery serious view of anyone who either perpetrates a hoax\r\n\r\nor who spreads rumours which generate anxiety, tension or\r\n\r\ndistrust, especially between our ethnic communities.   If\r\n\r\nanyone in good faith observes something which he feels is\r\n\r\nof  potential security threat or concern, he  should  not\r\n\r\nstart a rumour, but instead report it immediately to  the\r\n\r\nauthorities,  so that it may be effectively  and  quickly\r\n\r\ninvestigated and verified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Dr Ong Chit Chung and Prof. Chin Tet Yung\r\n\r\npointed  out  that,  given the nature  of  the  terrorist\r\n\r\nnetwork, counter-measures should have a regional\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndimension.  This is a valid observation.  I believe  that\r\n\r\ngovernments  in  the region and beyond realise  this  and\r\n\r\nrecognise   the   value  of  developing  and   mobilising\r\n\r\ncollective  resources and knowledge  to  deal  with  this\r\n\r\nterrorist threat.  Indeed, efforts are always ongoing  to\r\n\r\nexpand  the level and extent of cooperation and exchanges\r\n\r\nwithin  the region.  Frankly speaking, this may be easier\r\n\r\nsaid  in  the  case  of  some  established  domains,  eg,\r\n\r\nintelligence  and exchange and perhaps, more challenging,\r\n\r\nin newer areas, such as collective action.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our part, we are committed to giving all\r\n\r\npractical  assistance  to our foreign  partners  who  are\r\n\r\nserious  in  fighting this terrorist  threat.   This  has\r\n\r\nincluded,  and  will continue to include, access  to  our\r\n\r\ndetainees,  where they are relevant to  the  cases  under\r\n\r\ninvestigation    or   prosecution   by   these    foreign\r\n\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to translate into action the\r\n\r\nsecond  recommendation of policing against terrorist  and\r\n\r\nextremist  ideology, our Muslim leaders from the  various\r\n\r\norganisations  will have to work closely  together  in  a\r\n\r\nconsultative  and  open manner.  They  must  ensure  that\r\n\r\ntheir  efforts are understood by the community at  large,\r\n\r\nand  not  in  any way be seen to undermine the legitimate\r\n\r\nreligious pursuits and interests within the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must get our focus right. As Mr Zainul Abidin\r\n\r\nRasheed rightly concluded, this is an ideological battle,\r\n\r\nand  Muslim Singaporeans must not allow themselves to  be\r\n\r\nsubverted  and  be a party or proxy to  such  threats  by\r\n\r\nterrorists.   The  Jemaah  Islamiyah  detainees  are  not\r\n\r\nmarginalised  individuals  driven  by  a  deep  sense  of\r\n\r\ngrievance against Singapore society or by the feeling  of\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  and oppression in Singapore.   They  were\r\n\r\ndriven  by the misguided belief in the vision of a Daulah\r\n\r\nIslamiyah - an Islamic regional state - to be achieved by\r\n\r\nrevolutionary  force.   The  centre  of  their   regional\r\n\r\nIslamic state is not Singapore, but Indonesia.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore JI is only a district-level  unit  of  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Jemaah\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIslamiyah branch, whose leaders are in Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need our Muslim MPs, ulamas, asatizahs and\r\n\r\ncommunity  leaders, therefore, to be united, in providing\r\n\r\na  clear direction to the community to counter and reject\r\n\r\nextremism,  extremists  and  terrorist  ideology.    They\r\n\r\nshould   set   aside  their  individual   interests   and\r\n\r\ndifferences  and come together to face the common  threat\r\n\r\nwith determination and perseverance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Ahmad Khalis explained, our Muslim leaders\r\n\r\nhave  an  important role, not just to  guide  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity,  but also to correct erroneous perceptions  of\r\n\r\nIslam  which  may  be purveyed by the  ill-informed.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  they must help to turf out the dangerous  few,\r\n\r\nwho,  as  Mr  Heng  Chee  How  argued,  purvey  extremist\r\n\r\nideology even as they hide within, and prey on our larger\r\n\r\nMuslim  community.  As my colleague, Dr Yaacob,  put  it,\r\n\r\nevery   myopic,  extremist  or  radical  view   must   be\r\n\r\nchallenged and exposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, tackling the third\r\n\r\npresentation  in  the  White Paper of  strengthening  our\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion and religious harmony is  a  fundamental\r\n\r\nand  on-going  enterprise in our  nation-building,  which\r\n\r\npreceded  the  terrorist threat, and which will  continue\r\n\r\neven  after it is over.  Every country needs to form some\r\n\r\nconception  of the kind of society it wants to  be.   For\r\n\r\nSingapore, since its independence, this has been that  of\r\n\r\na  secular multi-ethnic meritocratic nation state.   This\r\n\r\nis  the best political structure, which ensures that  our\r\n\r\nvarious ethnic communities, regardless of their numerical\r\n\r\nsize,  can be equally assured of enough space to  thrive,\r\n\r\npromote and pursue their religion and culture in relative\r\n\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an ethnically plural society, the secular state\r\n\r\nis  centred upon a common civic space which can bind  all\r\n\r\nthe   ethnic   communities.   This  space  is  determined\r\n\r\nsignificantly by the separation of politics and religion.\r\n\r\nIf we allow politics and religion to be mixed, we will be\r\n\r\nbrewing  a  very  powerful amalgam, which  will  pit  one\r\n\r\nethnic  group  against  another  in  ceaseless  political\r\n\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Prof. Chin and other MPs argued in this\r\n\r\ndebate, the secular state which rests on the condition of\r\n\r\nkeeping politics and religion separate, is not just good,\r\n\r\nbut  necessary for Singapore's survival.  It allows  each\r\n\r\ncommunity  to pursue its ethnic interest, so long  as  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  undermine the political cohesion as a  centre.\r\n\r\nNo  single  community can push for the maximum space  for\r\n\r\nitself  without restraint and not expect a reaction  from\r\n\r\nthe other communities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with my colleague, Dr Yaacob, that in\r\n\r\nSingapore  we  must  achieve  unity  in  diversity.   The\r\n\r\nstronger the bonds at the centre, the deeper the level of\r\n\r\ninter-communal tolerance and trust, the greater the space\r\n\r\nfor  diversity  for each community.  No single  community\r\n\r\ncan grow beyond what the whole society can accommodate at\r\n\r\nany  point  in time.  The alternative to this arrangement\r\n\r\nis  an  unmediated free-for-all political society,  where\r\n\r\nevery  community self-centredly pushes for maximum space.\r\n\r\nIn   such  a  situation,  the  majority  community   will\r\n\r\neventually  subjugate,  overwhelm  the  minorities,   and\r\n\r\ncommunal conflict and competition will inevitably be  the\r\n\r\norder of the day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, several MPs spoke about the\r\n\r\nneed  to develop and expand dialogue and the common space\r\n\r\namong the communities.  Indeed, this is what we have been\r\n\r\npractising all these years since independence.  While  we\r\n\r\ncan  continue  to  enhance  the dialogue  between  ethnic\r\n\r\ncommunities in order to deepen inter-communal  bond,  the\r\n\r\neffort, although important, is not enough.  Singapore  is\r\n\r\ntoo  small  a country to afford the coming of  a  society\r\n\r\nwhere we can have any community withdrawing into its  own\r\n\r\ncocoon  and  living separate and cut off from  the  rest.\r\n\r\nCommitment and participation in the common secular  space\r\n\r\nis   vital,  so  that  all  Singaporeans,  regardless  of\r\n\r\nethnicity,  are  collectively  anchored  and  engaged  in\r\n\r\ndefining  a national space where the Singaporean identity\r\n\r\nis rooted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are considerations which must guide the\r\n\r\nconduct of all communities,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neven  as  they  pursue the developments of ethnic  issues\r\n\r\nclose  to  their hearts.  Singaporeans can be both  pious\r\n\r\nMuslims,  Buddhists,  Christians  or  Hindus,  and   good\r\n\r\ncitizens at the same time.  To be both, they need  to  be\r\n\r\nable  to  appreciate the line between the  obligation  as\r\n\r\ncitizens   and  their  duties  as  religious   faithfuls.\r\n\r\nAlthough   the  strengthening  of  social  cohesion   and\r\n\r\nreligious  harmony  is a stable and  vital  part  of  our\r\n\r\nnation  building, the current threat of terrorism  raises\r\n\r\nthe subject more urgently in our consciousness today.  In\r\n\r\na  way,  the  JI  arrests  are a  wake-up  call  for  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   The current threat of terrorism  has  the\r\n\r\nreal  potential of unravelling what we have achieved  and\r\n\r\nfracturing  our  communal  relations  which,  even   when\r\n\r\nmended,  will be permanently scarred and never quite  the\r\n\r\nsame again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's state of social cohesion is a dynamic\r\n\r\nand  evolving one over the last 37 years.   It  does  not\r\n\r\nstart  or end with the White Paper.  As Ms Indranee Rajah\r\n\r\nnoted,  there  are echoes of the past surfacing  in  this\r\n\r\ndebate  because  the issues of race  and  religion  in  a\r\n\r\nsociety  such  as  ours  are  deeply  embedded  and   are\r\n\r\nperennial  concerns.  But, as Dr Wang  Kai  Yuen  rightly\r\n\r\nobserved,  we have not stood still and we have come  some\r\n\r\nway,  and there is still a long way to go in this journey\r\n\r\nof nation building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of ethnic harmony in Singapore today\r\n\r\nhas  allowed  us  sufficient confidence  to  discuss  the\r\n\r\ndifficult issues related to the threats of terrorism in a\r\n\r\nmature,   rational   and  balanced  manner.    This   has\r\n\r\ncharacterised our dialogues with the community, and I  am\r\n\r\nglad  that  it  has also been largely reflected  in  this\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was particularly impressed and taken by the stout\r\n\r\nrejections by several MPs, like Mr Hawazi and Dr Wang Kai\r\n\r\nYuen,  of  the  caricature of the Malay community  as  an\r\n\r\nunder-performing, discriminated, ethnic group, who  needs\r\n\r\na  handout  by  way of affirmative actions  in  order  to\r\n\r\nsucceed.   They argued, rationally, on the basis  of  the\r\n\r\nfact  and  rightly collected feedback  and  not  on  some\r\n\r\nindividual perceptions and loose anecdotes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two MPs mentioned that there are issues still to be\r\n\r\nresolved  in  our ethnic community which are relevant  to\r\n\r\nsocial cohesion.  I agree.  Because ours is not a perfect\r\n\r\nsociety.   None is.  The important thing is that  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety,  if  a  person  has a genuine  problem,  he  has\r\n\r\neffective avenues for redress, including resorting to the\r\n\r\nlaw  for  protection and support.  Are there  individuals\r\n\r\nwho  have  grievances in our society?  Of  course,  there\r\n\r\nmust be.  Every society has its share of them.  Are there\r\n\r\nproblems  and  issues in the Malay community?   Obviously\r\n\r\nthere are.  Not just in the Malay community, but in every\r\n\r\ncommunity.   There are some who perceive  that  they  are\r\n\r\ndiscriminated because of their age or their gender,  too.\r\n\r\nBut,  does  this amount to marginalisation of  an  entire\r\n\r\ncommunity  outweighing  all  the  facts  which  tell   us\r\n\r\notherwise?   Or  worse,  is this  reason  for  anyone  to\r\n\r\ncynically   dismiss   the   findings   of   a   team   of\r\n\r\npsychologists,  counsellers, professional  investigators,\r\n\r\nand the detainees themselves, about the motivation of the\r\n\r\nJI  detainees?  We must not legitimise the JI  terrorists\r\n\r\nas  some kind of a victim of society.  Whatever the  case\r\n\r\nthat  may be in countries elsewhere, this is not the case\r\n\r\nhere.  If this theory of marginalisation is correct, then\r\n\r\nhow do we account for the highly educated, and successful\r\n\r\nprofessional  people, with PhDs, graduate  qualifications\r\n\r\nand some from western universities and businessmen in the\r\n\r\nleadership    of    the   Malaysian   Jemaah    Islamiyah\r\n\r\norganisation,  which our JI network  is  subordinate  to?\r\n\r\nAnd  these  leaders  are the product  of  an  affirmative\r\n\r\naction policy, the bumiputra policy which favours them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on social cohesion, and\r\n\r\nespecially inter-ethnic harmony, we have done well.   The\r\n\r\nfact  that  we can discuss such issues candidly  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  is one's reflection of the greater confidence  and\r\n\r\nmaturity.  However, this is not to say that there  is  no\r\n\r\nroom  for  growth in the strength of our social  cohesion\r\n\r\nand  the  quality  and  the  depth  of  our  inter-ethnic\r\n\r\nrelations.   Far from it.  Otherwise, we would  not  have\r\n\r\nmade it a key recommendation in this White Paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonding our people and nurturing social cohesion is\r\n\r\na  perpetual  and continuing enterprise.   It  is  always\r\n\r\ndynamic,  which  means  it can either  grow  stronger  or\r\n\r\nweaker,  over time, depending on what we do as a  people.\r\n\r\nWe  must  therefore jealously guard what we have achieved\r\n\r\nand build on the accumulated social capital of trust that\r\n\r\nthe last 30 years of communal peace have afforded us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I hope that we come out of\r\n\r\nthis  debate more sober and clear eyed over the terrorist\r\n\r\nthreat  that we are now facing.  But we must by no  means\r\n\r\nbe  intimidated.  We must be vigilant, but not  paranoid.\r\n\r\nWe  must  live with courage and not be cowed.  The  White\r\n\r\nPaper  has  given  us an opportunity to publicly  discuss\r\n\r\nsensitive  issues of race and religion.  In the  face  of\r\n\r\nadversity,  there  is  also  a  valuable  opportunity  to\r\n\r\ngalvanise  and mobilise our ethnic communities to  affirm\r\n\r\nand   strengthen  our  values  of  mutual  tolerance  and\r\n\r\ncommunal trust.  This we must do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has, in fact, been a whole new energy in inter-ethnic engagements following September 11, and the JI\r\n\r\nepisodes.   There is support of effort by the Government,\r\n\r\nlike  the IRCC, but just as encouraging, there have  also\r\n\r\nbeen  initiatives  by  the various ethnic  and  religious\r\n\r\ngroups  on  their  own to reach out,  make  contacts  and\r\n\r\nenhance interactions and understanding, whether it be  by\r\n\r\nway of mutual visits to places of worship, or small group\r\n\r\ndiscussions on religious practices and values.  As Mdm Ho\r\n\r\nGeok  Choo said, this congruence between the efforts from\r\n\r\nthe  top  and  the efforts from below in our  society  is\r\n\r\nimportant, because the quality of inter-ethnic  relations\r\n\r\ncannot  be  decreed by the Government, or willed  by  the\r\n\r\ncreation  of  formal structures, but must  ultimately  be\r\n\r\nfleshed  by the substantive participation and involvement\r\n\r\nof  ordinary  citizens  in their daily  interactions  and\r\n\r\ncontact  with  each  other as they go about  their  daily\r\n\r\nlives.   They  must  take  a personal  responsibility  to\r\n\r\npromote  inter-racial interactions.  They must reach  out\r\n\r\nto  one another.
