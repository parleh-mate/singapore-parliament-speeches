I should like to take this opportunity\r\n\r\nto  stress  that  in their interpretation  of  the\r\n\r\nTrade  Disputes  Ordinance, which is  a  perfectly\r\n\r\nclear  law, the Police are not depriving  strikers\r\n\r\nof  their lawful right to carry on picketing in  a\r\n\r\npeaceful   manner,  and  that  they   are   solely\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  the enforcement  of  the  law  on\r\n\r\nobstruction, intimidation, or behaviour calculated\r\n\r\nto  lead  to a breach of the peace. The Government\r\n\r\nwill  carefully consider not only any constructive\r\n\r\nsuggestions for improvement of the Ordinance  from\r\n\r\nthe point of view of the workers, but will also be\r\n\r\nobliged  to take into consideration the  views  of\r\n\r\nemployers   and  also  considerations  of   public\r\n\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the second part of the question, I\r\n\r\ncan  assure  the Member for Bukit Timah  that  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of amending the Trade Disputes Ordinance\r\n\r\nhas  been occupying my mind for some time.  But  I\r\n\r\nmust  say  that  I am only prepared  to  introduce\r\n\r\namending  legislation if I consider the  interests\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  require it, and not merely  because\r\n\r\nthe legislation has been enacted elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Does the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nrealise that the legislation which is now in force\r\n\r\nin  this  Colony was enacted here because  it  was\r\n\r\nenacted elsewhere, copied therefrom?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, two wrongs do not make one right!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Will the Minister for Labour tell us what he meant by a pseudo trade unionist?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Please look up the dictionary!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It does not answer the question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SECURITY OF TENURE FOR FARMERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Lim Ching Siong</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nLocal  Government,  Lands and Housing  whether  he\r\n\r\nwill  consider introducing legislation  to  obtain\r\n\r\nsecurity  of  tenure for farmers  who  at  present\r\n\r\noccupy   Crown  Land  under  temporary  Occupation\r\n\r\nLicences,  in  order to put such  land  into  more\r\n\r\nproductive use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Authority to\r\n\r\nissue leases for Crown land exists under the Crown\r\n\r\nLands Ordinance and the rules made thereunder.

I think there was, in\r\n\r\nfact,  only  one motion mentioned yesterday  taken\r\n\r\nunder  Standing Order 33 (1) (b) and one under  33\r\n\r\n(1)  (c),  on the grounds that His Excellency  the\r\n\r\nGovernor's consent had not been obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other motion under Head 32, which was to\r\n\r\nreduce  by $600 the sum to be allotted in  respect\r\n\r\nof  Deputy  Secretary to the Ministry of  Commerce\r\n\r\nand Industry was under Standing Order 31 (3), as in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  the motion under Head 48.

Firstly,  that the  Government  should\r\n\r\nfind  ways  and  means  of reducing  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nprimary   school  buildings  so  that  the   money\r\n\r\navailable   can   be  made  to  stretch   further.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  that the absence of any  new  provision\r\n\r\nfor  the  building  of  secondary  schools  was  a\r\n\r\nglaring omission; and thirdly, that there  was  no\r\n\r\nindication  in  the  Government's  programme  that\r\n\r\nthere  was  to  be  any  early  reorientation   in\r\n\r\neducational policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the first point, I do not think that\r\n\r\nthere  is  any need to repeat myself or elaborate,\r\n\r\nexcept to make quite clear that we are against the\r\n\r\ncutting   down  of  the  primary  school  building\r\n\r\nprogramme  as  far  as the number  of  schools  is\r\n\r\nconcerned.  What we feel convinced about  is  that\r\n\r\nthere  can be a considerable reduction in building\r\n\r\ncosts, but I cannot believe that plans are too far\r\n\r\nahead,  as far as the 1956 programme is concerned,\r\n\r\nto  prevent the necessary action being taken.  Let\r\n\r\nme  repeat once more, that this problem should  be\r\n\r\nthe  special concern of an Estimates Committee  of\r\n\r\nthis  House, and for some reason or another, which\r\n\r\nneeds  explaining, the Government appears to  have\r\n\r\nbeen extremely reluctant to set up this Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> That is not true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> As far as secondary education is\r\n\r\nconcerned, Sir, I am still not convinced that  all\r\n\r\nis  well.  A  fortnight ago  the  Minister  stated\r\n\r\ncategorically that six schools would be  completed\r\n\r\nin  1956.  On Monday last he was candid enough  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  only  two  would  be  completed,  if  I\r\n\r\nunderstood him, and later the Financial  Secretary\r\n\r\ncorrected  him  and  made it  four.  Whatever  the\r\n\r\nmeaning of these apparent contradictions,  we  are\r\n\r\nfaced  already this year with about 2,000 students\r\n\r\nhaving to be failed in an examination for entry to\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools, not because of lack of  skill,\r\n\r\nbut because there is no accommodation for them. It\r\n\r\nis true, of course,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  some  of these rejected students  will  find\r\n\r\ntheir  way  into  the new technical  schools,  the\r\n\r\njunior  technical school, into aided  schools,  or\r\n\r\nChinese  schools. Some, of course, are  not  of  a\r\n\r\nhigh  enough intellectual standard to benefit from\r\n\r\nsecondary education and will leave school to  join\r\n\r\nfamily  businesses and so on. But the  balance  of\r\n\r\nstudents  remaining  who need secondary  education\r\n\r\nfrom   January  and  will  not  get  it  is  still\r\n\r\nformidable.  I do not think that the Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation will accuse me of exaggerating if I  say\r\n\r\nthat  this balance would be enough to fill another\r\n\r\ntwo   secondary  schools,  possibly   three,   but\r\n\r\ncertainly  not  less than two.  If  the  secondary\r\n\r\nschool programme for 1955 had been completed, this\r\n\r\nshortage would not have arisen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worse still, the shortage will increase next\r\n\r\nyear   with   increasing   numbers   of   students\r\n\r\ncompleting the primary stage, and once  you  start\r\n\r\ncutting  down  on the policy of one new  secondary\r\n\r\nschool  for every four primary schools built,  you\r\n\r\nare,  in fact, following a policy of putting young\r\n\r\nstudents  of  14  and 15 on to the streets.  Quite\r\n\r\napart from the dangers of this course, we are at a\r\n\r\nloss  to understand the Government policy. A  lack\r\n\r\nof  secondary  schools means a  reduction  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of students who can be trained as teachers\r\n\r\nto  man more schools in the future; a reduction in\r\n\r\nthose  being  sent  for higher  education  in  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Malaya and  abroad,  and  hence  a\r\n\r\nreduction of highly qualified local men  to  enter\r\n\r\nthe   civil  service  or  commerce  and  industry.\r\n\r\nMalayanisation has no meaning as a policy if it is\r\n\r\nto  be  stifled at the outset by lack of  adequate\r\n\r\nhigher   education  facilities  for  the   younger\r\n\r\ngeneration. In our view, therefore, the Minister's\r\n\r\neducational policy is not in the best interests of\r\n\r\nthe  country  and  needs radical  changes.  It  is\r\n\r\nindeed  a  retrograde policy which could bring  us\r\n\r\ninto  serious trouble in a few years, and a direct\r\n\r\nreversal of Progressive Party policy which  fought\r\n\r\nfor years with the previous official Government to\r\n\r\nget secondary education given its proper place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I leave secondary education, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nsuggest  to  the  Minister that he considers  more\r\n\r\nseriously what he can do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  the 2,000 students who will fail to get entry\r\n\r\nto secondary schools next year. He has stated that\r\n\r\nbright  over-aged students will be given a  chance\r\n\r\nto  skip a year of secondary education and qualify\r\n\r\nfor Std. VII, but he has given no solution for the\r\n\r\naverage-aged  students  who  are  still  virtually\r\n\r\nunemployable  at  the completion  of  the  primary\r\n\r\neducation stage, partly because of age and  partly\r\n\r\nbecause  of  an  insufficiently  high  educational\r\n\r\nattainment. Something must be done to  make  these\r\n\r\nyoung  people  employable, so that they  can  make\r\n\r\ntheir  own way in life. They must not be  left  to\r\n\r\ndrift  into undesirable company and become loafers\r\n\r\nor  worse. It has been suggested that just as  the\r\n\r\nintake  of  primary schools has  been  doubled  by\r\n\r\nhaving  morning  and afternoon schools,  the  same\r\n\r\nshould  be  done in respect of secondary  schools,\r\n\r\nbut I believe there are practical difficulties  in\r\n\r\nthe   way  of  this  apparently  simple  solution,\r\n\r\nbecause  secondary  schools spill  over  into  the\r\n\r\nafternoons, particularly science periods; in other\r\n\r\nwords, there is no clear cessation of work at  one\r\n\r\np.m.  But  not  all class-rooms are  full  in  the\r\n\r\nafternoons, and therefore I hand the Minister this\r\n\r\nsuggestion.  Start a two- or three-year  intensive\r\n\r\ncourse  in a limited number of subjects  and  make\r\n\r\nthem   available   to  these  otherwise   unwanted\r\n\r\nstudents;  in other words, bridge the gap  between\r\n\r\nunemployability and employability and give them  a\r\n\r\nchance  in  life,  even if it is  only  in  junior\r\n\r\nposts,  but  do  not abandon them.  Parents  would\r\n\r\nrather  have their children busy with this limited\r\n\r\ntype  of  training than running wild. I hope  that\r\n\r\nearnest  consideration be given to  setting  up  a\r\n\r\nscheme  of  this kind in motion early in  the  new\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third charge against the Government was that\r\n\r\nno consideration had been given to a reorientation\r\n\r\nof  the  educational policy of  this  country.  No\r\n\r\ndoubt,  my hon. Friend will say that he is waiting\r\n\r\nfor  the completion of the now long overdue Report\r\n\r\nof  the All-Party Education Committee, but I would\r\n\r\nremind  him  that  the terms of reference  limited\r\n\r\nthat Committee to consideration of the problems of\r\n\r\nChinese  education  and Chinese schools.  Although\r\n\r\nthe suggestion has been made\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   the  Government  should  build  a   Chinese\r\n\r\nsecondary school, a Malay secondary school,  or  a\r\n\r\nTamil  secondary school on the basis of its policy\r\n\r\nof  equal  treatment  in education  for  all,  and\r\n\r\nalthough the Minister has indicated that a Chinese\r\n\r\nsecondary school, I think it was, is to  be  built\r\n\r\nnext year, it is by no means clear to me that  the\r\n\r\nsum  required has been budgeted for unless  it  is\r\n\r\none of the two which he now says will be completed\r\n\r\nin 1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet it is quite clear that speed in this matter\r\n\r\nis  essential, and Government should have hastened\r\n\r\nthe completion of the All-Party Committee's Report\r\n\r\nso  that it could have been debated in this  House\r\n\r\nthis  year  instead of in February next  year,  or\r\n\r\neven  later, or make a start with its policy where\r\n\r\nit  cannot  conflict with anything the Report  may\r\n\r\nreveal. Just to set aside $20 millions for grants-in-aid to vernacular schools is not a policy,  and\r\n\r\nwe  on  this  side of the House are not  happy  in\r\n\r\napproving a lump sum amounting to ten per cent  of\r\n\r\nthe country's revenue without Government coming to\r\n\r\nus  for  sanction as to how this amount should  be\r\n\r\nspent.  I  am  not  against  it  being  spent   on\r\n\r\neducation, or wholly on vernacular education. That\r\n\r\nis understood and agreed. But we may find that the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  the money should not be spent  on  full\r\n\r\ngrants-in-aid to individual schools, but that  the\r\n\r\npromotion of sound vernacular education  can  best\r\n\r\nbe  promoted if part of it is spent in other ways.\r\n\r\nIt  may be best, for example, to allocate some  of\r\n\r\nit  to  a  special branch of the Teachers Training\r\n\r\nCollege  for the training of teachers for Chinese,\r\n\r\nMalay  and  Indian  schools. Some  of  it  may  be\r\n\r\nrequired for more suitable textbooks and so on.  I\r\n\r\nhope that the Minister will give an assurance that\r\n\r\nthis  huge grant will be put to the best  possible\r\n\r\nuse  for  what I have called the reorientation  of\r\n\r\nour educational policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking broadly, and more broadly than the All-Party Committee is empowered by its terms of\r\n\r\nreference to speak, I would suggest that education\r\n\r\nhas three main purposes: firstly, to equip boys or\r\n\r\ngirls  to  earn their living; secondly,  to  equip\r\n\r\nthem to play their part as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizens  of a democracy; and thirdly,  to  enable\r\n\r\nthem  to  develop  all  the powers  and  faculties\r\n\r\nlatent in their nature so as to enjoy life in  all\r\n\r\nits fullness. These purposes are complementary  to\r\n\r\neach  other  and a proper education will  seek  to\r\n\r\nsecure  all  three,  and all of  them  within  the\r\n\r\nframework  of a Malayan nationalism.  It  follows,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   that  all  the  main  languages   and\r\n\r\ncultures which should make up that composite thing\r\n\r\nwhich  can be called Malayan nationalism  must  be\r\n\r\nregarded as complementary to each other and not as\r\n\r\nexisting separately in water-tight compartments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that a way will have to be found, and\r\n\r\nfound  at  once,  to achieve the  following  three\r\n\r\nobjectives. Firstly, the total eradication of  the\r\n\r\ncharge, erroneous but real, that there is  a  plot\r\n\r\nto  exterminate the Malay and Chinese  and  Indian\r\n\r\ncultures. Secondly, the total eradication  of  the\r\n\r\ncharge,  for  which there is some substance,  that\r\n\r\nour  young  people  in English schools  are  being\r\n\r\nbrought  up as imitation Westerners with  no  real\r\n\r\ncultural  roots  of their own. And,  thirdly,  the\r\n\r\nfree and equal choice of parents to decide whether\r\n\r\ntheir   children  are  to  have  a   predominantly\r\n\r\nChinese,   or   Malay,  or  Indian,   or   English\r\n\r\neducation,  and  yet  always  within   a   Malayan\r\n\r\nframework. I was a teacher of English in an Indian\r\n\r\ncollege  founded on English models  for  over  ten\r\n\r\nyears and perhaps I can claim to know something of\r\n\r\nthe problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to live together in this small country\r\n\r\nin  peace and goodwill, we have to found a Malayan\r\n\r\nnationalism     which    transcends     individual\r\n\r\nnationalism.  The more we understand each  other's\r\n\r\nlanguages,  the  more  we  shall  understand  each\r\n\r\nother's minds and the less shall we be set  within\r\n\r\nthe   rigid   confines  of  our   own   particular\r\n\r\ncommunity.  While  it is true  that  we  see  best\r\n\r\nthrough the eyes of our own community, or race, or\r\n\r\nnationalism,  it  is also true that  we  only  see\r\n\r\nimperfectly.  By  learning each other's  languages\r\n\r\nand  about each other's cultures, we find that  we\r\n\r\ncan see more than we could before, because we see,\r\n\r\nto some extent, through each other's eyes also. In\r\n\r\nthis  way  we  can rise to the idea  of  a  common\r\n\r\nsynthesis, something which we can all see\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough learning many-sidedness; and we shall then\r\n\r\nsee  that  a  Malayan culture  can  transcend  the\r\n\r\nChinese, or Malay, or Indian, or European cultures\r\n\r\nwithout destroying or belittling any of them;  and\r\n\r\nwe  shall then know that it is not merely possible\r\n\r\nbut  indeed  the  duty to begin by  being  a  good\r\n\r\nMalay,  or a good Chinese, or a good Indian  or  a\r\n\r\ngood  European, and then to make one further  step\r\n\r\nwithout  losing  that quality - and  become  a  good\r\n\r\nMalayan.

So far, the University of  Malaya\r\n\r\nhas  not  captured the imagination of the Chinese-speaking,   Indian-speaking,   or   Malay-speaking\r\n\r\ngroups.  Indeed, even amongst the English-speaking\r\n\r\ngroup  it  has not succeeded in bringing home  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  here  is an institution  which,  if  a\r\n\r\nMalayan  civilisation is to  flourish  in  Malaya,\r\n\r\nmust  foster  the  leaders,  not  necessarily  the\r\n\r\neconomic    leaders,   but   the   cultural    and\r\n\r\nintellectual leaders of the Malaya of tomorrow. It\r\n\r\nis  important  that in this seat of  learning  the\r\n\r\nhighest  traditions of academic freedom should  be\r\n\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, we all know that sometime\r\n\r\nlast  year  an  unfortunate blunder  was  made  on\r\n\r\nsomebody's part when academic freedom amongst  the\r\n\r\nstudents  was  attacked, when  a  prosecution  for\r\n\r\nsedition  in a University publication was  brought\r\n\r\nagainst  the editorial board of a certain  student\r\n\r\nmagazine. I find it difficult to assess  even  now\r\n\r\nthe  damage that the prosecution has done. It  was\r\n\r\nfortunate  indeed that a district judge - and  I  am\r\n\r\nproud to say that it was an Asian (he was born and\r\n\r\nbred   in  this  country) - decided  to  throw   the\r\n\r\nprosecution out of hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr C.

This includes the freedom to discuss  any\r\n\r\npolitical  subject  and  to  adopt  any  political\r\n\r\nattitude,  within  the confines of  that  academic\r\n\r\ninstitution.  Since  the salutary  effect  of  the\r\n\r\ndismissal  of  that prosecution,  the  authorities\r\n\r\nhave  been more tolerant and more liberal in their\r\n\r\nattitude  to  the students' political  activities.\r\n\r\nBut  I  wish today to bring to the notice of  this\r\n\r\nHouse the fact that the authorities have not shown\r\n\r\nthat  same  academic  tolerance  to  its  teaching\r\n\r\nstaff.

Mr Chairman, Sir, we are only able to\r\n\r\ndraw  inferences from facts. We do  not  know  the\r\n\r\nreasons  behind the facts. We know that a  certain\r\n\r\nstate of facts exist and from those facts, certain\r\n\r\ninferences  must inevitably be drawn.  Since  that\r\n\r\nintervention of the Chief Minister, a more healthy\r\n\r\natmosphere  has prevailed in the University.  This\r\n\r\nhas  been apparent to a certain number of teachers\r\n\r\nin  that institution who felt the oppression  that\r\n\r\nhad  previously existed when one after another  of\r\n\r\ntheir number, who had chosen not to conform,  were\r\n\r\neither asked to resign or were made to resign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, and this is a case which has not as yet\r\n\r\nreached  the  attention  of  the  Chief  Minister,\r\n\r\nattempts  are  still  being  made  to  penalise  a\r\n\r\nteacher  in  the University because his  political\r\n\r\nviews  do not coincide with those of the  head  of\r\n\r\nhis department or those in charge of policy in the\r\n\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 9th this year, a certain appointment\r\n\r\nwas  made  in which a local man, who had  received\r\n\r\nthe  highest  of recommendations from  his  fellow\r\n\r\nresearch  workers with whom he had  done  research\r\n\r\nwork  in  Britain, was appointed to  a  particular\r\n\r\nReadership.  He was the man most eminently  suited\r\n\r\nfor  that job and was so recommended by the Inter-University Council. The appointment was made.  But\r\n\r\non  the following day objection was taken to it by\r\n\r\nthe  head  of that department who had  refused  to\r\n\r\nrecommend this particular individual. He  had,  in\r\n\r\nfact, the impudence to suggest that this man, born\r\n\r\nand   bred  in  this  country,  should  apply  for\r\n\r\npromotion to a university outside Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot but share the anger with which\r\n\r\nthis  piece of unsavoury wire-pulling was received\r\n\r\nby  those who are connected with this institution.\r\n\r\nI  have been to that institution, Sir. I know  the\r\n\r\nbitterness,  the  frustration, and  the  hostility\r\n\r\nwith  which  the  local man views any  attempt  to\r\n\r\nfrustrate his legitimate political rights. Here is\r\n\r\na  case - and I hope to bring it to the attention of\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Minister  in the near  future - where  a\r\n\r\nlocal  man has proved that he is the best  man  in\r\n\r\nthe field.

Yet\r\n\r\nattempts  have  been made, first,  by  clandestine\r\n\r\nmethods,  to  get the University  to  reverse  the\r\n\r\nappointment  and  substitute somebody  else,  thus\r\n\r\navoiding the risk of having the whole thing  being\r\n\r\nexposed.

It   must   be\r\n\r\nremembered  that  a very large number  of  schools\r\n\r\nwill  be  built in this Colony during the  present\r\n\r\ndecade,  and we do not want them to be so inferior\r\n\r\nin  quality that they will be a permanent reproach\r\n\r\nto  the  legislators  of this  generation.

Prior    to    the    new\r\n\r\nconstitution,  the  Director of  Medical  Services\r\n\r\napproached   the  Government  and  the  Government\r\n\r\napproached   the  Director  of  Medical   Services\r\n\r\nthrough   the   Secretariat.  All   memoranda   to\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  all  external  correspondence  in\r\n\r\nlegislation,   etc.,   are   prepared    in    the\r\n\r\nSecretariat.   Now  all  this  work,   which   was\r\n\r\npreviously  done  by the Secretariat,  has  to  be\r\n\r\ncovered in the Ministry. Circumstances are proving\r\n\r\nthat  the  senior Administrative Officers  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   cannot   cover  the  responsible   work\r\n\r\ninvolved in their dual role of senior departmental\r\n\r\nofficers  and Ministerial officers. The efficiency\r\n\r\nof the work is suffering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Administrative Assistant post provided in\r\n\r\n1955  is  not  a  post for one  who  has  to  take\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for supplying  the  Minister  with\r\n\r\ninformation  and  for  carrying  out  the   policy\r\n\r\ndirected by the Minister. It is essential  that  a\r\n\r\nsenior  and  experienced officer be provided,  one\r\n\r\nwho   is   able   to   take  full   administrative\r\n\r\nresponsibility. A comparable Ministry that I  have\r\n\r\njust  pointed  out  is that  of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation.  The  fact  is  that  with  the   ever-increasing  size  of  the  medical  services,  the\r\n\r\nPermanent   Secretary  and  the  Deputy  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary cannot physically cover Ministry  duties\r\n\r\nas well as departmental duties - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Do not read!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> The additional Ministerial work -\r\n\r\n[Interruption.] May I ask you, Mr Chairman - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

It should be stressed\r\n\r\nthat whatever happened under the old constitution,\r\n\r\nit  is no longer true that policy is framed in the\r\n\r\nSecretariat.  After Government  has  sanctioned  a\r\n\r\npolicy, that policy is implemented in the Ministry\r\n\r\nand  by  the  Ministry, and I repeat, not  by  the\r\n\r\nSecretariat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, it is a\r\n\r\nmost  wordy  explanation which does  not  give  an\r\n\r\nexplanation! We have been referred to the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education on page 164 and it has been  brought\r\n\r\nto  our attention that there is a Deputy Secretary\r\n\r\n(Staff and Administration), Grade F. Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nSir,  that is exactly my point. In no Ministry  is\r\n\r\nthere on the Ministerial side (in the case of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education, turn over to page  163)  a\r\n\r\nDeputy   Secretary   (Administration).   In    his\r\n\r\nMinistry,  Medical  and  Health,  he  has  on  the\r\n\r\nprofessional  side an Administrative  Officer,  as\r\n\r\nthere  is  in the Education Ministry. He  has  not\r\n\r\nexplained why it has been found necessary  in  his\r\n\r\ncase,  and it is certainly not the largest of  the\r\n\r\nsix Ministries which have been created. That he or\r\n\r\nhis  Permanent  Secretary  should  have  found  it\r\n\r\nnecessary to have an extra Administrative  Officer\r\n\r\non  the Ministerial side on a superscale salary is\r\n\r\njust waste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Then you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  following  it \"Senior Port  Health  Officer,\r\n\r\nGrade  G\"; then \"Health Officer-in-charge Schools,\r\n\r\nGrade  G\";  then at sub-head 37 (4) you will  find\r\n\r\n\"Medical  Officer-in-charge,  Maternity  and  Child\r\n\r\nWelfare Services (Rural), Grade G\". In the Remarks\r\n\r\ncolumn against this item, you will find this: \"New\r\n\r\nappointment\".  Now  if you  look  at  the  Remarks\r\n\r\ncolumn   against  item  (2)  \"Senior  Port  Health\r\n\r\nOfficer,  Grade  G\", you will find \"Title  changed\r\n\r\nfrom Deputy Chief Health Officer. (687/55)\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first point is that the post of Senior Port\r\n\r\nHealth Officer is not a change just of title  from\r\n\r\nDeputy Chief Health Officer but a change of  duty,\r\n\r\nbecause  this  man,  who was Deputy  Chief  Health\r\n\r\nOfficer, had under his charge \"Maternity and Child\r\n\r\nWelfare  Services  (Rural)\". If you  compare  this\r\n\r\nwith  the  Singapore Establishment Staff List  for\r\n\r\n1955  at  page  83,  the position  becomes  fairly\r\n\r\nclear.  There is a Chief Health Officer.  At  page\r\n\r\n84,  there is a Deputy Chief Health Officer and  a\r\n\r\nHealth Officer-in-charge of Schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these years the port of Singapore has\r\n\r\nbeen about three square miles long and it has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  necessary  to  have  a  Senior  Port  Health\r\n\r\nOfficer.  His  work  has been  done  by  a  junior\r\n\r\nadministrative medical officer. Unlike the Port of\r\n\r\nLondon or Liverpool he has not such a wide area to\r\n\r\ncover,  nor  has  he  a large  number  of  medical\r\n\r\nofficers  to  supervise  and  control.  The   only\r\n\r\ninference one can reasonably draw from it is that,\r\n\r\nwhilst there is a Deputy Chief Health Officer  who\r\n\r\nalso  looks  after  maternity  and  child  welfare\r\n\r\nservices, it would be difficult to create  another\r\n\r\nsuperscale post Grade G. So a favourite  dodge  in\r\n\r\nEstablishment  technique  has  been  adopted.  The\r\n\r\ntitle  of  the  man  who was Deputy  Chief  Health\r\n\r\nOfficer  is  converted  into  Senior  Port  Health\r\n\r\nOfficer, so there is now no Deputy. Then they slip\r\n\r\nin  another  superscale post and put  it  down  as\r\n\r\nMedical  Officer-in-charge,  Maternity  and   Child\r\n\r\nWelfare  Service.  The appointment  is  completely\r\n\r\nunnecessary. It is wrong to come to this Assembly,\r\n\r\nafter  it has been told that the Government  wants\r\n\r\nto  economise,  to  ask it to boost  up  one  more\r\n\r\nsuperscale post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I would first like to remind the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanjong Pagar that it is our intention\r\n\r\nthat  a suitable local officer shall be chosen  to\r\n\r\nproceed  overseas  for special training  prior  to\r\n\r\nappointment to this post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to inform the House that the\r\n\r\nMedical Department has more than 40 maternity  and\r\n\r\nchild  health  clinics  scattered  throughout  the\r\n\r\nisland today. There has been a remarkable increase\r\n\r\nin  total  attendances  at these  clinics  in  all\r\n\r\ncategories  and I would like to give some  of  the\r\n\r\nfigures. The following statistics are relevant:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n   Number of clinic sessions held                           2,945\r\n\r\n   Ante-natal cases                                        11,505\r\n\r\n   Total attendances of antenatal cases in these clincis   39,000\r\n\r\n   Post-natal cases                                         3,552\r\n\r\n   Total attendances of postnatal cases in these clincis    5,496\r\n\r\n   Infants under one year                                  14,330\r\n\r\n   Total attendances of infants under one year             94,180\r\n\r\n   Pre-school children                                      6,173\r\n\r\n   Total attendances of preschool children                 46,249\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary for the efficiency of the\r\n\r\nservice  that  there should be a  responsible  and\r\n\r\nspecially trained medical officer in charge of  it\r\n\r\nand responsible for it to the Chief Health Officer\r\n\r\nin the Ministry of Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the three chief appointments that you see\r\n\r\nunder  sub-head  37  represented  the  three  main\r\n\r\nsections  of  the Health Branch of  the  Ministry,\r\n\r\neach  officer  responsible  to  the  Chief  Health\r\n\r\nOfficer for his section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the change of title, it is purely that\r\n\r\nthe Senior Port Health Officer under Division I is\r\n\r\nin  charge of Quarantine, and, as I have said, all\r\n\r\nthese   three  Grade  G  posts  are  for  officers\r\n\r\nresponsible to the Chief Health Officer for  their\r\n\r\nparticular  sections. It is the growing  necessity\r\n\r\nof having a medical officer in charge of maternity\r\n\r\nand  child welfare that necessitates the provision\r\n\r\nof  this  new appointment, and it is provided  for\r\n\r\nthe  sole  intention of having  a  suitable  local\r\n\r\nofficer  to  fill  that  post  after  he  has  had\r\n\r\noverseas training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I am glad to note that\r\n\r\nthe  guilty conscience on the part of the Hon. the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Health has made  him  categorically\r\n\r\nstate - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

That is a departmental\r\n\r\nruling  which,  in their opinion, is  designed  to\r\n\r\nexclude  them.  It is no use creating  this  post,\r\n\r\nsending  the  man overseas, letting him  become  a\r\n\r\nspecialist, bringing him back and then letting him\r\n\r\nsquat for five years before he becomes eligible to\r\n\r\nhold this appointment as a specialist officer in a\r\n\r\nsuperscale post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, I would just like to point\r\n\r\nout  to the Minister, in respect of the statistics\r\n\r\nwith  which he has showered us, that he never gave\r\n\r\nus  the  figures for 1951, 1952 and 1953  to  show\r\n\r\nthat  there  was, in fact, a definite increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  number of attendances at these rural clinics.\r\n\r\nBut  on  page 117 of the 1955 Estimates, one  will\r\n\r\nfind that there was exactly the same number of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstaff - Chief Health Officer, Grade E; Deputy  Chief\r\n\r\nHealth  Officer, Grade G; Health Officer-in-charge\r\n\r\nSchools,  Grade G; Health Officers, 27.  Sir,  one\r\n\r\nmust  assume, if one bothers to work it out,  that\r\n\r\nany  increased  work  cannot be  covered  by  just\r\n\r\nappointing a man at the top and placing him at the\r\n\r\ndisposal of this particular department. 27  Health\r\n\r\nOfficers  were  sought in 1955 and  27  are  still\r\n\r\nsought in 1956. That, in my submission, shows that\r\n\r\nwhatever  expansion  there may  be  is  adequately\r\n\r\ncovered  by  the 27 Health Officers and  that,  in\r\n\r\nfact, the Medical Officer-in-charge, Maternity and\r\n\r\nChild Welfare Services, is completely unnecessary.\r\n\r\nFirst,  one  abolishes  the  Deputy  Chief  Health\r\n\r\nOfficer.  (What has he been doing all these  years\r\n\r\nif  he  was  not the Deputy Chief Health Officer?)\r\n\r\nThen  one  creates, since there is no Deputy  now,\r\n\r\nthree  superscale  posts - three different  branches\r\n\r\nall   being  co-ordinated  by  the  Chief   Health\r\n\r\nOfficer.  Then in a year's time, if this  sort  of\r\n\r\nrigging still persists, one slips in a vote for  a\r\n\r\nDeputy  Chief  Health Officer, another  superscale\r\n\r\npost.  One comes back and says, \"Ah, but  now  the\r\n\r\nChief Health Officer has so much to co-ordinate he\r\n\r\nmust  have  an assistant to help him co-ordinate.\"\r\n\r\nThis is just the sort of thing that has been going\r\n\r\non  for  years  and years, bedevilling  the  whole\r\n\r\ncivil service and reducing it to utter contempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I object to the\r\n\r\nsuggestions  made by the last speaker.

Does it mean that they  want  to\r\n\r\nfill  two  vacancies  and continue  two  vacancies\r\n\r\nwhich  they  hope  to fill in the distant  future?\r\n\r\nThen   it  has  some  meaning,  but  we  want   an\r\n\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I am much obliged to the Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar for pointing them out  to  me,  but\r\n\r\nthese are new appointments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> So there will be seven?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Well, I cannot reconcile that. I am\r\n\r\ndealing with the 1956 Estimates and these are  two\r\n\r\nnew  appointments. I would like to point  out  the\r\n\r\nradiological service is expanding rapidly. In 1954\r\n\r\nthere   were   104,605  diagnostic   examinations,\r\n\r\nrepresenting  a  30  percent increase  over  those\r\n\r\nrecorded in 1953.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Therapy section the cases treated\r\n\r\nincreased  from  412  in  1953  to  565  in  1954,\r\n\r\nrepresenting a 37 per cent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincrease.   The   Therapy   department   of    the\r\n\r\nradiological  service is of increasing  importance\r\n\r\nas  modern discoveries extend the scope of  radio-active   treatment  of  disease.  Hitherto  Radio-therapists   have  not  been  shown  specifically,\r\n\r\nalthough  one  Radio-therapist has been  employed.\r\n\r\nThe  provision of two extra posts is  intended  to\r\n\r\nenable  the  special  training  overseas  of   two\r\n\r\nlocally  domiciled  officers  who  may  show   the\r\n\r\nability  to  undertake further  training  in  this\r\n\r\nspeciality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A suggestion has been made by the Colombo Plan\r\n\r\nauthorities  that  Singapore  might  apply  for  a\r\n\r\ncobalt  bomb. So far it has not been  possible  to\r\n\r\nfollow  up  this suggestion because a cobalt  bomb\r\n\r\nwill  be of no assistance to Singapore unless  one\r\n\r\ncan  be confident that there will be available  at\r\n\r\nall times a specialist to use it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I wish to remind the Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar that these two extra posts have been created\r\n\r\nspecially for the purpose of enabling the Ministry\r\n\r\nto  send  two locally domiciled officers  overseas\r\n\r\nfor special training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, this is the\r\n\r\ndifficulty that we constantly experience  on  this\r\n\r\nside  of  the  House. Regardless of the  point  we\r\n\r\nmake, we get an answer which has been prepared and\r\n\r\nwritten out beforehand, without relevance  to  the\r\n\r\npoints made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, if I may take the Minister's last point,\r\n\r\nthat  he wants to send two local officers overseas\r\n\r\nin  order  that they may become radiologists,  and\r\n\r\nthat  therefore he has created the posts now which\r\n\r\nthey cannot fill until five years after qualifying\r\n\r\nas  specialists,  unless he does  something  about\r\n\r\nwhat  he  says is under consideration - the removal\r\n\r\nof this prohibition of a man becoming a specialist\r\n\r\nunless he has five years of his speciality. May  I\r\n\r\ninform him that the local officers are quite happy\r\n\r\nto  be timescale officers, so that when they  come\r\n\r\nback  they can fill the job immediately?  They  do\r\n\r\nnot  want  to be on superscale, because they  feel\r\n\r\nthat  that is another of those nasty little dodges\r\n\r\nthey play in the civil service, check and counter-check,  a  little game of chess.  They  are  quite\r\n\r\nhappy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto go and train as radiologists, come back, not as\r\n\r\nsuperscale  officers  but  as  ordinary  timescale\r\n\r\nradiologists, to do the job, and after five years,\r\n\r\nif  there  is  a  benevolent government  still  in\r\n\r\npower,  they  might be promoted to superscale  and\r\n\r\ngiven  more money. But they are quite happy to  do\r\n\r\nthe  job  without more money, and they  prefer  it\r\n\r\nthat  way, because they feel safer for they cannot\r\n\r\nbe cheated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have heard a mass of irrelevant\r\n\r\ninformation about a cobalt bomb being applied  for\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Colombo Plan authorities, and therefore\r\n\r\nradiologists are required to manipulate it. All we\r\n\r\nwant to know is why are there two vacancies in the\r\n\r\nEstablishment List for radiologists which have not\r\n\r\nbeen  filled? The Minister comes before this House\r\n\r\nand  says, \"I do not know how to explain that, but\r\n\r\nI  am  asking for two new ones.\" He is asking  for\r\n\r\nsomething  which  is costing us something  in  the\r\n\r\nregion of $70,000 odd without our knowing what  it\r\n\r\nis  all about. When it is put to the vote,  we  on\r\n\r\nthis  side of the House are expected to say, \"Aye,\r\n\r\nwe  agree  with that.\" I would ask the  Government\r\n\r\nseriously  to  consider this point which  is  made\r\n\r\nwith the authority of the local officers. They are\r\n\r\nquite happy -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Name them!

I would like to remind him that the further\r\n\r\nhe  goes with his expatriate officials in creating\r\n\r\nall  these appointments, the further away he  goes\r\n\r\nfrom  his  own  people on whom he ultimately  must\r\n\r\nrely  for support to run his Administration. I  am\r\n\r\nnot  suggesting for one moment that this was  done\r\n\r\nwith the connivance or the consent of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChief  Minister or his Ministers. I  said  at  the\r\n\r\nopening  of  the debate on the Second  Reading  of\r\n\r\nthis Bill that there are faults in the Budget that\r\n\r\nI   do  not  lay  directly  at  the  feet  of  the\r\n\r\nMinisters.  They  are new in their  jobs.  As  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Health  has  given  us  reason   to\r\n\r\nbelieve,  they really do not understand  what  all\r\n\r\nthis  is about. Quite obviously they have to  rely\r\n\r\non  the  expatriates and the officials, and  these\r\n\r\ngentlemen,  like everybody else, are creatures  of\r\n\r\nhabit.   They  do  what  they  have  always   been\r\n\r\naccustomed  to  do. They carry  out  their  artful\r\n\r\nlittle  dodges.  They carry on in their  good  old\r\n\r\nways for as long as they can. Sir, I would ask the\r\n\r\nelected  Members  of this Government  to  consider\r\n\r\nreducing the posts of Radiologists from superscale\r\n\r\nto ordinary timescale. The local officers, to whom\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Health has made reference,  have\r\n\r\nindicated that they would prefer much less pay  on\r\n\r\ntimescale. They would rather come back from  their\r\n\r\ntraining overseas and fill that job than come back\r\n\r\nand  find  that they are not qualified to  fill  a\r\n\r\nsuperscale  job.  Then  application  is  made  for\r\n\r\nsomebody  who  is qualified and that  somebody  is\r\n\r\ninevitably an expatriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nSir,   on   this  question  of  Radiologists,   we\r\n\r\nunderstand  from  the  Minister  for  Health  that\r\n\r\nlocally  domiciled people are being sent  overseas\r\n\r\nfor further studies. I would just like to know the\r\n\r\nnumber  sent,  how  long they will  take  to  have\r\n\r\nspecial  training, and when they will  return.  If\r\n\r\nnone  are to return in 1956, as they are sent now,\r\n\r\nthen there is no point in creating posts now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point.

However, since you feel  that  I\r\n\r\nshould  not  comment, I will not, but nevertheless\r\n\r\nit  does not mean that I do not want to comment in\r\n\r\nthe strongest possible terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, at page 92 of the Establishment List, for\r\n\r\nSister  Tutors,  one  finds that  there  are  four\r\n\r\nSister  Tutors - four expatriates, one local.  There\r\n\r\nare  four appointments, but there are five  Sister\r\n\r\nTutors, and I am told the explanation for that  is\r\n\r\nthat  there  is one leave reserve - one is  away  on\r\n\r\nleave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are now told that the Government wants\r\n\r\nsix  more. They want provision for seven for seven\r\n\r\nmonths.  What that means is that for seven  months\r\n\r\nin  1956, June to December, they propose to engage\r\n\r\nseven  Sister Tutors. Of course, we  can  have  an\r\n\r\nassurance from the Minister for Health that he  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  send six lucky local girls for training\r\n\r\nso that they may come back and enjoy the wonderful\r\n\r\nprivilege of being Sister Tutors, because they can\r\n\r\nonly become Sister Tutors by going to Britain  for\r\n\r\ntraining.  That  training takes a period  of  more\r\n\r\nthan  six  months.  By June next  year  all  seven\r\n\r\nappointments  will  have been  filled.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand it, but I do understand this, that this\r\n\r\nneed  was  seen as long ago as February 1954.  Sir\r\n\r\nHan  Hoe Lim is a very conservative member of this\r\n\r\ncommunity about whom, in his capacity as a  Member\r\n\r\nof the Public Services Commission, little good has\r\n\r\nbeen  said.  In  a Commission of which  he  was  a\r\n\r\nMember,   he,  from  such  an  indisputably   pro-expatriate  quarter, advised in  his  report  that\r\n\r\nwithin  the  18 months following the date  of  the\r\n\r\nreport  in  1954,  five Sister Tutors  should  be\r\n\r\nchosen  and sent for training in order  that  they\r\n\r\ncould  fill these posts. It is on page 40  of  the\r\n\r\nHan  Hoe Lim Report (Council Paper No. 40 of 1954)\r\n\r\nand you will see there:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Candidates for these must be chosen within the\r\n\r\nnext  18  months, and the posts in the Departments\r\n\r\nconcerned must not be occupied substantively until\r\n\r\ntheir return, qualified to fill them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there, amongst the list of other things, are\r\n\r\nfive Sister Tutors. Now we are told that they want\r\n\r\nsix.  They were told early in 1954 to choose  five\r\n\r\nand send them away for training. Nothing was done.\r\n\r\nI  do not hold the Minister for Health responsible\r\n\r\nfor  this because, after all, he did not know that\r\n\r\nhe  was  going  to  be Minister for  Health  until\r\n\r\nsometime late in April this year.

The whole thing does\r\n\r\nnot make sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar referred to a White Paper, a  report\r\n\r\nunder  the  chairmanship of Sir Han Hoe  Lim.  The\r\n\r\nrelevant  sentence  of  that  report,  which   was\r\n\r\naccepted by the Government then, was \"that  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to ensure that before officers are  sent\r\n\r\non  Scholarships  there  shall  be  vacancies  for\r\n\r\npromotion  on  their return.\" As I have  explained\r\n\r\nearlier to this House, that is the reason  why  we\r\n\r\nare  creating these posts. That recommendation was\r\n\r\nimplemented  by  the Director of Medical  Services\r\n\r\nand  the Chief Secretary on the 5th of July, 1954,\r\n\r\nand further amplified in August 1955 with regard to\r\n\r\nscholarships, giving the basis for award of  these\r\n\r\nscholarships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar also referred to my\r\n\r\nreading  notes. I have received quite a number  of\r\n\r\nmotions and it is only necessary, of course,  that\r\n\r\nanswers  to  these,  with  the  assistance  of  my\r\n\r\nofficers, be dictated, and I must refer  to  them,\r\n\r\nbut  I can assure him that I do not type and  read\r\n\r\nout any verbatim speeches such I have seen Members\r\n\r\non the opposite side of the House do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I wish to inform the House that the\r\n\r\npresent Medical Department has an establishment of\r\n\r\nfour  Sister  Tutors. In addition to  these  four,\r\n\r\nthere  are three World Health Organisation  Sister\r\n\r\nTutors working in Singapore at the Nurses Training\r\n\r\nSchool.

Therefore,\r\n\r\nalthough  the  proposed  establishment  for   1956\r\n\r\nappears to involve an increase of six, the  actual\r\n\r\nincrease asked for, in fact, is only three.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nurses Training School in the General\r\n\r\nHospital is being expanded to enable the School to\r\n\r\nhave  an  annual  intake of 150  probationers.

In a mental\r\n\r\nhospital  of  the  size  of  Woodbridge  Hospital,\r\n\r\nprovision  for a total of ten sisters  trained  in\r\n\r\nmental  diseases  is  woefully insufficient.

S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I can speak therefore on the\r\n\r\nreason why we permitted it. I would like to say to\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly - other than those who are so  blinded\r\n\r\nby  their  hate  that they will  not  see - that  we\r\n\r\ncalled  in the Controller of Immigration and  said\r\n\r\nthat  we  were not happy to upgrade any particular\r\n\r\npost   until  we  had  the  full  Report  of   the\r\n\r\nSreenivasan (Malayanisation) Commission.  In  this\r\n\r\ninstance, Sir, it was pointed out to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nus  that this officer has reached the upper  limit\r\n\r\nof his timescale for some time now, and that there\r\n\r\nhas  been,  since  the  advent  of  the  Coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment, considerably increased activity in the\r\n\r\nImmigration Department, particularly as  a  result\r\n\r\nof representations which came through me and other\r\n\r\nMinisters,  and particularly due to  the  pressure\r\n\r\nthat  I  was  putting on and other Ministers  were\r\n\r\nputting on the Department to expedite its dealings\r\n\r\nwith  applications for entry permits which in  the\r\n\r\npast  had  taken two or three years to go through.\r\n\r\nTo our minds, Sir, it is a ghastly thing to keep a\r\n\r\nfamily waiting in suspense and anxiety for such  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  period of time, and although  it  is\r\n\r\ntrue  that  the senior officers in that Department\r\n\r\nremain  the  same in number, the House surely  has\r\n\r\nnot  forgotten that only recently it approved  the\r\n\r\nappointment of four more junior officers  to  that\r\n\r\nDepartment  in  order  to expedite  the  increased\r\n\r\nvolume of work as well as to give greater rapidity\r\n\r\nto  the decisions to be taken in respect of  those\r\n\r\napplications. As a result of that expansion,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthere has been a great deal more work thrown  upon\r\n\r\nthe  officer  in question whom I do  not  remember\r\n\r\never  having  met. I learned his  name  only  last\r\n\r\nnight, and that from the hon. Member opposite, but\r\n\r\nthe name does not matter. I think it is correct to\r\n\r\nsay  that  he  is an expatriate officer,  but  the\r\n\r\nposition is this, Sir. It is the intention of this\r\n\r\nGovernment  to deal with scrupulous fairness  with\r\n\r\nall its employees, and if in the normal course  of\r\n\r\nevents  it is proper that a certain civil servant,\r\n\r\nwhether  he  be  a  Malayan or whether  he  be  an\r\n\r\nexpatriate,  should  be  promoted  and  receive  a\r\n\r\nhundred dollars extra per month, then he should be\r\n\r\npromoted,  Sir.  He  should  also,  if  there  are\r\n\r\nabolition  terms,  properly  get  those  abolition\r\n\r\nterms in respect of that extra hundred dollars.  I\r\n\r\ndo not, nor do my colleagues, intend to permit the\r\n\r\nexpatriates to be treated unjustly nor,  I  think,\r\n\r\ndoes the country want it. We want abolition and we\r\n\r\nwant  Malayanisation, but we do admit  that  there\r\n\r\nmust be fair compensation and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere cannot be fair compensation, Sir, if we  are\r\n\r\nholding  back  the  proper  promotions  at  proper\r\n\r\ntimes.  I  know I find myself in the extraordinary\r\n\r\nposition - it  may seem to be so to certain  Members\r\n\r\nof  the  House - of  defending the expatriate  civil\r\n\r\nservice,  but  I  have all my  life,  Sir,  sought\r\n\r\nfairness for all human beings. That is why I am in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly and I hope that is why we are all in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that it is unfair to an expatriate officer\r\n\r\nto  stop his normal promotion - and this was not  a\r\n\r\nnormal  but  a pressing promotion - just because  we\r\n\r\nwant  to give him less when abolition terms  come.\r\n\r\nThat is cheating in the true sense of the word and\r\n\r\nit is not the intention of the Government to cheat\r\n\r\nthe  expatriate civil servants, nor do I think the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore want to cheat the expatriate\r\n\r\ncivil   servant  when  it  comes  to  giving   him\r\n\r\nabolition  terms. I have every reason to  believe,\r\n\r\nand so have the Ministers who are my colleagues on\r\n\r\nthe  Finance Committee and who saw and  heard  the\r\n\r\nController    of    Immigration,     after     the\r\n\r\nrepresentations made, that this was,  in  fact,  a\r\n\r\nproper and well-earned promotion. It is true  that\r\n\r\nwhen  abolition comes he will get  a  few  dollars\r\n\r\nmore  because he is now getting a hundred  dollars\r\n\r\nmore a month. For the honour of this country, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe should not seek to save those few dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> For the honour of this\r\n\r\ncountry, Sir, let us be honest whether we want  to\r\n\r\nMalayanise  at  every possible speed.

I am not moving a reduction of $10 because\r\n\r\nI  feel that the sum is too much but I am moving a\r\n\r\nreduction  of $10 because I think the sum  is  too\r\n\r\nsmall.  I  am bound by Standing Orders  and  so  I\r\n\r\ncannot  move anything above what has been  put  in\r\n\r\nthis Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, \"Assistance to Youth Organisations\" in this\r\n\r\ninstance means assistance to boys' clubs and mixed\r\n\r\nclubs  and girls' clubs. The institution of  boys'\r\n\r\nand girls' clubs was mooted in the year 1946 and I\r\n\r\nthink the Nominated Member, Mr R. C. H. Lim,  was\r\n\r\nfor  a  very long time on the Committee of one  of\r\n\r\nthe clubs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose and aim of such clubs and\r\n\r\ninstitutions   are   to   assist   underprivileged\r\n\r\nchildren. In Singapore today, Sir, we all realise,\r\n\r\nand  it has been repeated very often indeed,  that\r\n\r\nover 50 per cent of the population is under 21. It\r\n\r\nis  even more important, Sir, to realise that  out\r\n\r\nof  that 50 per cent of young people in Singapore,\r\n\r\na   very   large   number  of   them   come   from\r\n\r\nunderprivileged  homes, homes that  cannot  afford\r\n\r\nthe little amenities of life. The parents of these\r\n\r\nyoungsters  are  probably hawkers  and  labourers.\r\n\r\nThey  cannot afford to buy them anything to assist\r\n\r\nthem to pass their time usefully. These youngsters\r\n\r\nhave  no playing facilities. Many of them have  no\r\n\r\nopportunity  to go to school. Many  more  have  to\r\n\r\nhelp  their families. It is because of this  group\r\n\r\nof  youngsters that boys' clubs and  girls'  clubs\r\n\r\nare set up to assist them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance to such people must take in a lot of\r\n\r\nvoluntary  workers, and I would say that  in  many\r\n\r\nclubs  many people are willing to help this  group\r\n\r\nof  people.  They  are  doing  really  good  work,\r\n\r\ninstead of theorising in air-conditioned rooms, as\r\n\r\nsome  people do, as to what we should do  for  the\r\n\r\nunderprivileged. However, not all people who  want\r\n\r\nto  help can help because they are not equipped to\r\n\r\nhelp.  I  believe that whenever we spend money  we\r\n\r\nmust always get value for our money. If any scheme\r\n\r\nto  help these under-privileged young people is to\r\n\r\nattain greater success, then we must train a group\r\n\r\nof  people so that they may be able to help  these\r\n\r\nyoung  people.  We must train them  along  special\r\n\r\nlines.   We  must  train  them  in  art   and   in\r\n\r\nhandicrafts so that they can go back to the  clubs\r\n\r\nand assist the youths, but such schemes cost money\r\n\r\nand very little money has been provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, doing such work is full-time work.\r\n\r\nThe whole band of voluntary people who are helping\r\n\r\nin   these   schemes  have  to  earn   their   own\r\n\r\nlivelihood.  They  have to look  after  their  own\r\n\r\naffairs  and in order to make leadership in  boys'\r\n\r\nclubs  more  effective, we have club  leaders  who\r\n\r\nwork  for  a period of six hours and more  a  day.\r\n\r\nSome  work  for  eight  hours,  and  holidays  are\r\n\r\nincluded,  but  they are very happy  to  serve.  I\r\n\r\npersonally  feel that although the  Department  of\r\n\r\nSocial  Welfare would like to say  that  they  are\r\n\r\npart-time  workers, they are, in  fact,  full-time\r\n\r\nworkers. They work on holidays when they should be\r\n\r\nhaving  their  rest; and yet how much  do  we  pay\r\n\r\nthem?  We pay them round about $80, $90 or $100  a\r\n\r\nmonth,  and that is really a pitiful sum.  We  are\r\n\r\nnow  faced with the position whereby if we do  not\r\n\r\nassist  these  young people to spend their  excess\r\n\r\nenergy in the proper manner, there is a very  real\r\n\r\ndanger of their running into bad company or  being\r\n\r\nled to become gangsters; and of their being taught\r\n\r\nto be anti-social in the years to come. Boys' club\r\n\r\nwork  is positive work and it is only by the  work\r\n\r\nof  such  people that Singapore may be  a  happier\r\n\r\nplace to live in. The sum allocated, $40,000,  for\r\n\r\nthe  whole  movement is indeed very small.  During\r\n\r\nthe  Second Reading stage, I said that in 1954 the\r\n\r\nsum allocated was $28,000. That was for ten clubs.\r\n\r\nIn 1955 the sum allocated went up to $40,000. That\r\n\r\nsum  represents  a 50 per cent rise  and  we  have\r\n\r\nabout  13  clubs. This year we have 40 clubs,  and\r\n\r\nthe  sum allocated remains the same for 1956.  You\r\n\r\nwill   see,  Sir,  that  the  activities  of  this\r\n\r\nmovement  have increased almost three times  since\r\n\r\nlast  year,  but the grant remains  the  same,  at\r\n\r\n$40,000.  I  regret  that that  should  be  so.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that it should be increased and all people\r\n\r\nwho  have  any  love and care for  those  who  are\r\n\r\nreally under-privileged and need assistance should\r\n\r\nsee to it that that sum is increased at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

The amount\r\n\r\nnecessary will, of course, depend on the number of\r\n\r\nnew  clubs formed. Government has no control  over\r\n\r\nthis.  The  formation of clubs is spontaneous  and\r\n\r\nshould be so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been pointed out by Mr R.C. H. Lim, the\r\n\r\nSocial  Welfare Department provides youth or  club\r\n\r\nleaders in the form of five Youth Service Officers\r\n\r\nand  four  Assistant  Youth  Service  Officers  to\r\n\r\nassist  in  the  running of the  boys'  clubs.  In\r\n\r\naddition,  Sir, under the Head: Contributions  and\r\n\r\nCharitable   Allowances,  the   Government   gives\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance to the Girls' Life  Brigade,\r\n\r\nthe   Boy  Scouts  Association,  the  Girl  Guides\r\n\r\nAssociation  and the Singapore Youth Council.  The\r\n\r\namount has been increased from $11,775 in 1951 to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$22,680  in 1956. In addition, Sir, the  Education\r\n\r\nBoard  gives grants to Boy Scouts and Girl  Guides\r\n\r\nto  the  amount  of $11,000, as  can  be  seen  in\r\n\r\nAppendix  C,  page 267, sub-head 3  of  the  Draft\r\n\r\nEstimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I confirm what the\r\n\r\nHon. the Minister for Labour and Welfare has just\r\n\r\nsaid,  that the question of assisting boys'  clubs\r\n\r\nis   in  the  forefront  in  the  minds  of   the\r\n\r\nMinisters,  but  I am sorry that  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon made a reference to the hawkers  because\r\n\r\nI  do  not think they can be considered as  under-privileged  since they have just  built  a  market\r\n\r\ncosting  nearly  $1  million for  the  hawkers  in\r\n\r\nKilliney Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, if Mr R.\r\n\r\nC. H. Lim refers to all boys from schools as being\r\n\r\nprivileged, then I think we must differ  a  little\r\n\r\non  that. If you refer to those boys who  ride  in\r\n\r\nbig  cars and whose parents have salaries of  $500\r\n\r\nand  above, yes, I agree that they are, but I  can\r\n\r\nassure  you that such boys form a fraction of  one\r\n\r\nper cent of the strength of such clubs. If you say\r\n\r\nthat  there  are a few school boys in such  clubs,\r\n\r\nthen  I,  as  the President of the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nBoys'  Clubs, welcome them. I welcome them because\r\n\r\nthey  are material which can be made to lead other\r\n\r\nboys  who  are not as good when compared  to  them\r\n\r\neducationally  or otherwise. A few  educated  boys\r\n\r\ncoming into boys' clubs and mixing with the  other\r\n\r\nboys   is   certainly  a  good  way  of  promoting\r\n\r\nunderstanding between their different stations  in\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to make is that the\r\n\r\nHon. the  Minister  for Labour  and  Welfare  has\r\n\r\nstated  that he has increased the number of  Youth\r\n\r\nService Officers. This should be the case and  the\r\n\r\nnumber should be further increased. It is not just\r\n\r\nbecause  you  have  increased your  Youth  Service\r\n\r\nOfficers  that  you  have discharged  your  duties\r\n\r\ntowards  the under-privileged people,  the  people\r\n\r\nwhom  you say you will take care of; but  I  think\r\n\r\nyou  will  have rendered them a direct service  if\r\n\r\nyou  work  among them, lead them, help  them  with\r\n\r\nmoney and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncreate  for  them a contented feeling that,  after\r\n\r\nall, the Government is trying to do something  for\r\n\r\nthem.

I have already explained that\r\n\r\nthe  $40,000 in the Estimates is a standstill vote\r\n\r\npending the creation of standard formulae, and  as\r\n\r\nsoon as these are ready, Government will then give\r\n\r\nconsideration to additional grants  if  these  are\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

In fact,\r\n\r\nthe  two  amendments which he is moving do concern\r\n\r\nprecisely  the same thing although  it  cannot  be\r\n\r\nshown in the Estimates in the present form.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know myself how it could be shown at all but,\r\n\r\nanyhow,  I  will start now to try and explain  the\r\n\r\nsituation. It is rather a complex one in a sort of\r\n\r\narithmetical way, and if you cannot understand  my\r\n\r\nexplanation, then I will leave it to the Hon. the\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary who can, no doubt, give it  to\r\n\r\nyou still more clearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation, broadly, is that telecommunication\r\n\r\nservices are an essential part of the Regional Air\r\n\r\nTraffic Control Centre, which is necessary for  an\r\n\r\ninternational  airport,  and  the  problem   which\r\n\r\nparticularly puzzles the hon. Member is  that  the\r\n\r\ncosts  under  the  Regional  Air  Traffic  Control\r\n\r\nCentre  are  apportionable amongst the Governments\r\n\r\nof  the  Federation, the Bornean territories,  and\r\n\r\nSingapore.     The     total    expenditure     on\r\n\r\ntelecommunications for the Airport is broken  down\r\n\r\ninto  two-thirds  for  the  Regional  Air  Traffic\r\n\r\nControl  Centre  and one-third for  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nAirport.  The one-third for the Singapore  Airport\r\n\r\nis  payable by Singapore. The two-thirds  for  the\r\n\r\nRegional    Air   Traffic   Control   Centre    is\r\n\r\napportionable. The basis of apportionment  is  one\r\n\r\nof  those  terribly confusing formulae  which  are\r\n\r\narrived  at  when you have Committees  meeting  on\r\n\r\nthese  things, and each Government  is  trying  to\r\n\r\nfind  some  means  of  sorting  out  what  is   an\r\n\r\nacceptable  way of charging the costs amongst  one\r\n\r\nanother.  They  are on the basis  of  landing  and\r\n\r\nhousing fees in each territory. Singapore's  share\r\n\r\ncomes  to  approximately 45 per cent of the  total\r\n\r\ncost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I am not sure if that solves your difficulty\r\n\r\nor whether you want me\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  go  into  the  details of  what  services  are\r\n\r\nprovided and that kind of thing.

Member addressing the Chair?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr Chairman.\r\n\r\nWell, let us see. I think this will do quite well.\r\n\r\nI  think  this is what you want. You have  a  good\r\n\r\nmany  aeroplanes  coming  into  the  international\r\n\r\nAirport.  You  have,  in  fact,  three  aerodromes\r\n\r\nparallel  with one another, and aeroplanes  coming\r\n\r\ninto  all of them. A large part of the air traffic\r\n\r\nis  military, which must fly in a military type of\r\n\r\nway.  In  fact,  if you have got to  make  an  air\r\n\r\nstrike  in Johore, the Airport authorities  cannot\r\n\r\nsay, \"We are going to delay the air strike because\r\n\r\nwe  expect an airliner to arrive at about the same\r\n\r\ntime as you want to make the air strike.\" Military\r\n\r\naircraft therefore have to be able to take off and\r\n\r\ncome  down whenever they want to. You need to have\r\n\r\nspecial navigational aids which can assist a civil\r\n\r\naircraft as it approaches the aerodrome and  bring\r\n\r\nit  straight  on its own proper safety  line  with\r\n\r\nbeacons and that sort of thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the items provided for the safety of\r\n\r\naircraft  in  flight  are  five  long-range  radio\r\n\r\ncircuits to other airports in South-East Asia  and\r\n\r\nAustralia-Sydney, Ceylon, Bangkok,  Djakarta,  and\r\n\r\nBorneo. Then we have the long-distance radio and a\r\n\r\ntelephone service to aircraft in flight up to  500\r\n\r\nmiles or more from Singapore. Then there are short-range  radio services operating from the Singapore\r\n\r\nAirport  Control  Tower which controls  the  local\r\n\r\nflying  of  aircraft  as  they  come  on  to   the\r\n\r\nairstrip.  There  is also the maintenance  of  air\r\n\r\nradio  beacons which are the equivalent, from  the\r\n\r\nair navigator's point of view, of a lighthouse  on\r\n\r\nan  island  when a ship is coming  over  the  sea.\r\n\r\nThese  beacons are picked up by an aeroplane which\r\n\r\nfollows  the beacons till it touches down  on  the\r\n\r\nground. Then there is a miscellaneous\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlocal   link  in  radio  communication  which   is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  ensure  effective  ground   liaison\r\n\r\nbetween  the airports. I hope that is a sufficient\r\n\r\npicture of the network. The costs are fairly high,\r\n\r\nbut if you want an international airport, you have\r\n\r\nto   have   the   equipment  which   international\r\n\r\noperators   expect  and  which  is  necessary   by\r\n\r\ninternational civil aviation standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, references\r\n\r\nhave  been  made  to the absence of  an  Estimates\r\n\r\nCommittee by you and also by other Members on  the\r\n\r\nother side - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Now,  the  relevant fact  to  this  is  the\r\n\r\nexisting  situation  and the  situation  which  we\r\n\r\nexpect  to come. In the beginning of this marathon\r\n\r\ndebating   contest,  I  did  point  out   to   the\r\n\r\nOpposition    that   their   motto   might    very\r\n\r\nappropriately  be:  \"Those  who  pay  no  heed  to\r\n\r\nexisting conditions and formulate their criticisms\r\n\r\nblindly.\" Now let us take one point. In the period\r\n\r\nduring  the last five years, there have been  over\r\n\r\n20,000  houses  and flats built in Singapore  and,\r\n\r\naveraging  at  five residents per house  or  flat,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  rather low, it gives you  a  figure  of\r\n\r\nsomewhere over a hundred thousand persons who have\r\n\r\nbeen  rehoused in new areas in one way or another.\r\n\r\nThis,  in  itself,  is  a very  large  problem  of\r\n\r\nreorganisation. When you get population shifts  of\r\n\r\nthat  size,  you  do need continual  planning  and\r\n\r\nreadjustment in order to secure that your  letters\r\n\r\ndo  arrive  without  undue  delay  and  that  your\r\n\r\npostmen have an adequate weight to carry on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  beat - not too many letters and not too  few,\r\n\r\nbut  just  what  is  reasonable  and  correct   by\r\n\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this movement of population\r\n\r\n(which  is  continually going on) there  are  also\r\n\r\nsome  statistical  figures. The  hon.  Member  has\r\n\r\nexpressed  his  repugnance at being showered  with\r\n\r\nstatistics - they are too much like  facts  and  too\r\n\r\nlittle  like oratory for him. I would  point  out,\r\n\r\nhowever,  that  the total mail handled  has  risen\r\n\r\nfrom  47  million items in 1947 to  89,300,000  in\r\n\r\n1955,  constituting an increase  of  over  80  per\r\n\r\ncent.  The savings bank transactions have gone  up\r\n\r\nfrom  167,000 to 305,000, another over 80 per cent\r\n\r\nincrease;  Money  Orders  issued  and  paid   from\r\n\r\n202,000  to 440,000, which is about 117  per  cent\r\n\r\nincrease;  Postal  Orders  issued  and  paid  from\r\n\r\n101,000  to  553,000, a 449 per cent increase.  If\r\n\r\nthe  hon.

Whereas I  have\r\n\r\ngiven you figures of anything from nearly 450  per\r\n\r\ncent  increase  down to 82 per  cent  increase  in\r\n\r\npostal  business, the actual total staff  increase\r\n\r\nis  in  the nature of 32 or 33 per cent, and  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers will appreciate that this does represent a\r\n\r\nvery  marked achievement on the managerial  level.\r\n\r\nThat you could have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  enormous expansion of business with  a  very\r\n\r\nmoderate  expansion  of staff  is  an  achievement\r\n\r\nwhich  is very greatly to the credit of the senior\r\n\r\nofficials - locally  domiciled and  expatriate - who\r\n\r\nare  running  our very efficient postal  services,\r\n\r\nand   if   it   is  necessary  to  maintain   that\r\n\r\nefficiency,  then  you should  have  a  thoroughly\r\n\r\nadequate and competent managerial level staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point which I think perhaps I\r\n\r\nought  to take and that is, as the hon. Member,  I\r\n\r\nknow  for sure, is very well aware, that the  Post\r\n\r\nOffice  makes  a  very thorough  business  of  its\r\n\r\nemployer/employee   relationship    which    is\r\n\r\nnecessarily  a matter that occupies  the  time  of\r\n\r\npeople  at  the  very  top  level  of  the  postal\r\n\r\nservices.  If  you  are  to  have  competent   and\r\n\r\nresponsible  officials  dealing  with  the  rather\r\n\r\nlengthy discussions and examinations that  go  on,\r\n\r\nand    if   you   are   going   to   ensure   good\r\n\r\nemployer/employee relationships, then they  cannot\r\n\r\nhave  adequate  time for dealing with  the  postal\r\n\r\ntraffic, and this is another new factor which does\r\n\r\nreasonably put up a case for the expansion of  the\r\n\r\ntop-level staff. In my view, if a case  is  to  be\r\n\r\nmade  out,  it  should be made out  for  a  larger\r\n\r\nstaff,  because the set-up is expanding  and  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to expand and the staff at the top  level\r\n\r\nare very heavily worked. We have development plans\r\n\r\nin hand, but they are not yet ready to come before\r\n\r\nthe House, Mr Chairman.

We all recognise\r\n\r\nthat the Member for Tanjong Pagar does arrogate to\r\n\r\nhimself  the position of an efficiency expert  who\r\n\r\nis  fully confident of assessing the need for  any\r\n\r\njob and the emoluments which should be attached to\r\n\r\nthe  job,  and  I  would like to  satisfy  him  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of this Deputy Director post.  The  first\r\n\r\nthing  I would point out is that this is a  simple\r\n\r\nupgrading  which was proposed way  back  in  July,\r\n\r\n1954,  and  it simply brings into line the  Deputy\r\n\r\nDirector of Public Works with two other comparable\r\n\r\nDeputy  Directors. I would ask the hon. Member  to\r\n\r\nlook  at item (2) of sub-head 1 under Head  48  on\r\n\r\npage  164 - \"Deputy Secretary (Schools and Colleges)\r\n\r\nand Deputy Director of Education.\" Similarly under\r\n\r\nMedical  and Health, Head 52, on page  180,  under\r\n\r\n\"Personal   Emoluments - Headquarters - Division   I,\r\n\r\nDeputy  Secretary, Ministry of Health  and  Deputy\r\n\r\nDirector  of  Medical  Services.\"  These  are  two\r\n\r\nDeputy  Director posts comparable  to  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nDirector  of Public Works, and it does  seem  very\r\n\r\nreasonable and proper that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch Deputy Directors should get the same Grade D.\r\n\r\nThat may, however, not satisfy him. It is a simple\r\n\r\nmatter  of  equity in which he takes not  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other points which might be noted are that,\r\n\r\nin  fact, the top-level appointments in the Public\r\n\r\nWorks  Department are decreasing. If I  can  refer\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member again to the Estimates  he  will\r\n\r\nobserve that the appointment of the Chief Drainage\r\n\r\nEngineer - item  5,  sub-head  1  on   page   244 - is\r\n\r\nvanishing  after three months and the  appointment\r\n\r\nof  the Superintending Engineer, Grade F, is  also\r\n\r\nvanishing after six months. The appointment of the\r\n\r\nChief  Engineer at the Airport has already  gone - a\r\n\r\nreduction of three superscale posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the hon. Member has accepted the\r\n\r\nprinciple   that   an  increase   in   work,   and\r\n\r\nconsequently  an increase in responsibility,  does\r\n\r\njustify  an  upgrading. He accepted  that  earlier\r\n\r\nthis  morning and I would point out  to  him  that\r\n\r\nthere  has been something in the nature of  a  300\r\n\r\nper cent increase in the work of the P.W.D. in the\r\n\r\nlast  five years and therefore this very  moderate\r\n\r\nupgrading is related to a very large expansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is this expansion since the\r\n\r\nRitson revision?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I really think the hon.

I propose nothing  more  than  a\r\n\r\nsimple practical operation, the upgrading of a man\r\n\r\nto put him on equality with other similar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeputy  Directors, and that is related to  a  very\r\n\r\nlarge  expansion  in  the work.

May I  enquire\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister why, when the Ritson  revision\r\n\r\ntook  place, it was not found necessary to upgrade\r\n\r\nthis  Deputy Director of Public Works? Why is  it,\r\n\r\nin  spite  of his admission that the expansion  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.W.D. took place before the Ritson revision,\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  only now found necessary to  upgrade\r\n\r\nhim?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am afraid I am\r\n\r\nnot  very clever about Ritsonisation and that kind\r\n\r\nof  thing,  but  the  fact is  that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nconnection between the two.
