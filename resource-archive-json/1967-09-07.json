I\r\n\r\nwould  like to say that members of the public  who\r\n\r\nvisit  the reservoir should be fully conscious  of\r\n\r\nthe   dangers  of  polluting  the  water  in   the\r\n\r\nreservoir  and urge them to cooperate  to  prevent\r\n\r\nsuch contamination from occurring.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out to Members of the\r\n\r\nHouse  that there have been many cases  in  recent\r\n\r\nhistory  when  there were outbreaks of  infectious\r\n\r\nhepatitis, a disease which affects the  liver,  in\r\n\r\nseveral  countries  - Hongkong,  Germany,  Sweden,\r\n\r\nIndia  -  and on investigation it has  been  found\r\n\r\nthat  the source of this epidemic has been  traced\r\n\r\nto  water  being contaminated by sewage either  at\r\n\r\nthe   point  of  intake  of  the  water  from  the\r\n\r\nreservoir or river or in the distribution  system.\r\n\r\nThe worst outbreak of this disease, hepatitis, was\r\n\r\nin  New Delhi in 1955/56 when there were 30,000 to\r\n\r\n50,000  cases.  The  virus  causing  hepatitis  is\r\n\r\nresistant to standard methods of purification used\r\n\r\nby municipalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                  \r\n\r\nTreatment   with  large  doses  of   chlorine   is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  destroy the virus but  this  raises\r\n\r\nenormously the cost of purified water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The possibility of contaminating the reservoirs\r\n\r\nin  Singapore comes from picnickers  who  wash  or\r\n\r\nswim  in the reservoirs. As it is not possible  to\r\n\r\nmake  a complete patrol of the reservoirs, we  can\r\n\r\nonly  appeal  to  the civic consciousness  of  the\r\n\r\npicnickers  and  hikers in the reservoirs  not  to\r\n\r\nbathe  in the reservoirs or to allow dogs to enter\r\n\r\nthe water. As a note of warning to all adventurous\r\n\r\npeople, I would like to add that the reservoir  is\r\n\r\nvery  deep  and  in many parts the bed  is  muddy.\r\n\r\nBathing  and swimming in the reservoir can,  there\r\n\r\nfore, be very dangerous to the swimmer who may get\r\n\r\nstuck in the mud and drown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board is in the process of\r\n\r\ndrawing  up regulations to prevent water pollution\r\n\r\nin  the  MacRitchie Reservoir and  misuse  of  the\r\n\r\nMacRitchie Reservoir Park. These regulations will,\r\n\r\namong  other things, prohibit fishing and  bathing\r\n\r\nin the reservoir or streams, spitting in the park,\r\n\r\neating  or  smoking  on the bridge  in  MacRitchie\r\n\r\nReservoir  Park,  and  litter, rubbish  or  other\r\n\r\nrefuse  must be thrown into receptacles which  are\r\n\r\nspecially provided for them. The Board has  formed\r\n\r\na  MacRitchie  Reservoir Park  Committee  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the  maintenance of the park and to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  visitors  comply  with  the  regulations.  A\r\n\r\nnumber  of patrolmen have been employed to  patrol\r\n\r\nthe  whole area of the park grounds and more  will\r\n\r\nbe  recruited to ensure that the regulations, when\r\n\r\npromulgated, are not violated by visitors.

The reasons for\r\n\r\nthese  price increases are often confused  in  the\r\n\r\npublic  mind. As a result, there have been adverse\r\n\r\ncomments  on  Government's  industrialisation  pro\r\n\r\ngramme  which has been blamed for the increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of  living. I wish  to  go  into  these\r\n\r\nmatters in some detail as it is important that the\r\n\r\nblame  should be attributed to the right quarters.\r\n\r\nThe  real  reason for the widespread concern  over\r\n\r\nthe  increase  in  the cost of living,  especially\r\n\r\namong  the  poorer people, lies in the substantial\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the cost of rice. Over the  last  18\r\n\r\nmonths the price of rice has gone up by 14 cents a\r\n\r\nkatty.  To people with large incomes this increase\r\n\r\nin  price  will  cause  no  hardship.  But  if  we\r\n\r\nconsider  the  effect on a typical working  family\r\n\r\nof, say, a man with a wife and three children,  we\r\n\r\ncan  see  that it bears very harshly  on  them.  A\r\n\r\nfamily  of  five may consume about 100 katties  of\r\n\r\nrice a month, and the price increase means that  a\r\n\r\nwage-earner has to bear the additional expenditure\r\n\r\nof $14 a month. To a family earning $200 a month -\r\n\r\nthis  is  a typical working class family income  -\r\n\r\nthis represents a very substantial increase.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  is  nearly equivalent to a pay cut  of  $14  a\r\n\r\nmonth,  and the extensive grumbling that  goes  on\r\n\r\nnow is the consequence of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can Government do about the price of rice?\r\n\r\nFirst, we must find out why the price has gone up.\r\n\r\nIs  it  due to profiteering by our rice merchants,\r\n\r\nor  is  it  because the world price  of  rice  has\r\n\r\nincreased?  If price increases are the  result  of\r\n\r\nprofiteering,  then  Government  action  to  lower\r\n\r\nprices  can  be  taken by taking measures  against\r\n\r\nprofiteering. But there is rio evidence  that  our\r\n\r\nrice  merchants are profiteering. The real  reason\r\n\r\nis  that  there has been an increase in the  world\r\n\r\nprice  of rice because of the general shortage  of\r\n\r\nsupply. Rice exports from Burma have gone down  in\r\n\r\nrecent   years.  Thailand  is  suffering  from   a\r\n\r\ndrought.  The  war in Vietnam has  not  helped  to\r\n\r\nincrease  rice  production in  that  country.  And\r\n\r\nindonesia  continues to be a large  buyer  in  the\r\n\r\nworld  market.  So the increase  in  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving due to the increase in the price of rice is\r\n\r\ndue to external factors beyond our control and has\r\n\r\nnothing    to    do    with    the    Government's\r\n\r\nindustrialisaton programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as people want to eat rice, they must\r\n\r\npay for the extra cost. But they can economise  by\r\n\r\neating less rice and more wheat products, such  as\r\n\r\nbread  and  noodles, as our Deputy Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  been  advocating. Wheat flour, of course,  is\r\n\r\nhalf the price of rice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has also been a substantial increase in\r\n\r\nthe  price  of  canned meat imported  from  China.\r\n\r\nChinese exporters have increased their prices, and\r\n\r\nthere is statistical evidence that this has happened. Here again the reasons lie outside our country\r\n\r\nand beyond our control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards day-to-day food supplies, certain\r\n\r\nitems have gone up in price, such as cabbages  and\r\n\r\npotatoes,  while others have gone down  in  price,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  red chillies, onions, spinach, chai  sim\r\n\r\nand  1ong beans. These are normal fluctuations  in\r\n\r\nthe market and are not of great significance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some months ago there was an attempt made to\r\n\r\nspeculate   in  matches  and  sugar.  When   these\r\n\r\ncommodities  were  produced in  Singapore,  import\r\n\r\nduties  were imposed on foreign products  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  local manufacturer could capture the domestic\r\n\r\nmarket. Some people, thinking that they could make\r\n\r\nmoney,  tried  to raise the prices  of  sugar  and\r\n\r\nmatches.   But  it  was  soon  found  that   local\r\n\r\nsuppliers were adequate to meet the market  demand\r\n\r\nand  prices reverted to normal. So while  imported\r\n\r\nmatches are more expensive, the price of the local\r\n\r\nproduct  remains the same. If people want  to  buy\r\n\r\nimported  matches at twice the price of the  local\r\n\r\nproduct, there is nothing one can do about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the subject of Government's\r\n\r\npolicy on industrialisation and its effect on  the\r\n\r\nprices   of  goods.  We  must  assure  the   local\r\n\r\nmanufacturer a substantial portion of the domestic\r\n\r\nmarket for the products he is manufacturing. To do\r\n\r\nthis,   import  duties  are  imposed  on   foreign\r\n\r\nproducts. Naturally thit means that the prices  of\r\n\r\nimported articles go up. The Trade Division of the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Finance keeps a continuing survey  on\r\n\r\nprices  of locally-manufactured goods. When  local\r\n\r\nmanufacturers   commence  production,   they   are\r\n\r\ndirected not to increase their prices unless there\r\n\r\nis  good  reason  to do so, as,  for  example,  an\r\n\r\nincrease in the price of raw materials. In  nearly\r\n\r\nall  cases, the local manufacturers have  accepted\r\n\r\ntheir obligation in good faith and have maintained\r\n\r\ngood  quality  and reasonable prices.  Here  again\r\n\r\nsome local consumers are attached to the brands of\r\n\r\ngoods  which  they are used to buying,  and  these\r\n\r\nimported goods definitely cost more than the local\r\n\r\nproducts.  If  you want to pay more  for  imported\r\n\r\ncondensed milk, mosquito coils, chocolates, toilet\r\n\r\nsoap,  singlets  and matches, you cannot  complain\r\n\r\nabout  the increase in the cost of living, because\r\n\r\nyou  can  buy local products at the same price  as\r\n\r\nbefore  and  of comparable quality. For  instance,\r\n\r\nCadbury chocolates used to cost 35 cents a bar. As\r\n\r\na  result of import duties, they now cost 50 cents\r\n\r\na bar. Van Houten\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nchocolates,  which  are  produced  in   Singapore,\r\n\r\ncontinue  to be priced at 35 cents a bar.  If  you\r\n\r\nare  very  fond  of  Cadbury chocolates,  you  may\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  buy them. You will  then  be  contributing  \r\n\r\nto  the revenue of the Customs Department.\r\n\r\nIf you buy the local product, you do not make this\r\n\r\ncontribution but you will be contributing  to  the\r\n\r\nincome and employment of your fellow citizens.

The cure here,  in  the  first\r\n\r\ninstance, is to improve management efficiency.  In\r\n\r\nthe second case, it is to ask the manufacturer  to\r\n\r\nreduce  his  prices.  The  sanction  that  can  be\r\n\r\napplied  in  both  instances is the  reduction  or\r\n\r\nabolition of import duties on these commodities. I\r\n\r\nwill  not  hesitate to apply this sanction  should\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances of the situation  justify  such\r\n\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

However,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think  this is a very good  idea.  First,\r\n\r\nthere  are countless shops and departmental stores\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  Implementation  of  this  proposal\r\n\r\nwould,  therefore, cost a lot of money. The  large\r\n\r\nvariety  of  locally-manufactured goods,  together\r\n\r\nwith  the large numbers and sizes of shops selling\r\n\r\nthem,  would  make  it almost impossible  to  have\r\n\r\norderly  legislation and effective implementation.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot, for instance, legislate that all shops\r\n\r\ndisplay  all  types  of  locally-made  goods.  The\r\n\r\nvariety is too large. There may be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninadequate space in some shops. On the other hand,\r\n\r\nif  it  is  provided that not all the locally-made\r\n\r\ngoods need be displayed, a shop could display only\r\n\r\none  product and claim to have complied  with  the\r\n\r\nlaw.   This  would  defeat  the  purpose  of  such\r\n\r\nlegislation.  To specify a minimum  variety  would\r\n\r\nalso  be difficult, as shops vary so much in size.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  adequate for one shop  is  probably  not\r\n\r\nadequate for another. These are only a few of  the\r\n\r\nproblems that we will encounter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that compulsory display of\r\n\r\nlocally-made  goods will not necessarily  increase\r\n\r\nsales.  The Singapore consumer is a discriminating\r\n\r\nbuyer  and  purchases on the basis  of  price  and\r\n\r\nquality.   As   competition  is  extremely   keen,\r\n\r\ndepartmental stores and retail shops cannot afford\r\n\r\nto  be  without lines which sell. In other  words,\r\n\r\nthe  availability of consumer goods is not  a  pro\r\n\r\nblem. The manufacturer will have to compete on the\r\n\r\nbasis  of price and quality rather than depend  on\r\n\r\ncompulsory display to push sales.

For  some  time,  the\r\n\r\nimportation  of  some of these fresh  fruits  from\r\n\r\ncertain  countries  came  under  the  control   of\r\n\r\nimporters' committees.

We\r\n\r\nintend    to   bring   home   to   all   Singapore\r\n\r\nhouseholders, whether living in kampongs or  urban\r\n\r\nareas, that every householder is required to  have\r\n\r\nhis  own  dust-bin  (not a  dust-bin  provided  by\r\n\r\nGovernment) with a proper lid (not one  without  a\r\n\r\nlid)  to contain his household refuse.

What is  needed  is\r\n\r\nmore  reorganisation  within  the  department  and\r\n\r\ncloser supervision and reallocation of duties,  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  work can be more equitably  distributed\r\n\r\namongst workers.

A  mass   vaccination\r\n\r\ncampaign has been and is still being carried  out,\r\n\r\nand  so far about 113,000 pigs at 1,485 farms have\r\n\r\nbeen vaccinated.

The reasons for  this  Bill  stem\r\n\r\nfrom  recent  disturbances in the Republic,  which\r\n\r\nhad  led  to the arrest of a few hundred offenders\r\n\r\naccused of rioting and other cognate offences. The\r\n\r\nsubsequent proceedings in court and the  behaviour\r\n\r\nof  the accused persons when produced in court had\r\n\r\nemphasised  certain inadequacies in  our  Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure Code, especially in regard to the powers\r\n\r\nof   a   subordinate  court  exercising   criminal\r\n\r\njurisdiction  to  punish  offenders  for   alleged\r\n\r\ncontempt of court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The particular case which hon. Members are no\r\n\r\ndoubt  familiar with relates to the occasion  when\r\n\r\nthe  alleged  offenders, when  produced  in  court\r\n\r\nbeing jointly\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharged  for  committing the same offence  at  the\r\n\r\nsame time and place, had misbehaved in so unruly a\r\n\r\nmanner as to have destroyed furniture in the court\r\n\r\nitself.   This   extraordinary  behaviour,   quite\r\n\r\nunprecedented  in the history of our  courts,  had\r\n\r\nbrought  to  the fore the inadequacies of  certain\r\n\r\nportions   of  our  Code  of  Procedure  governing\r\n\r\nproceedings in our Magistrates' Courts, especially\r\n\r\nso  with  regard  to the powers of  the  court  to\r\n\r\ncommit for contempt even where the acts complained\r\n\r\nof  are  committed in the presence  of  the  court\r\n\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law now stands, Sir, the sole provision -\r\n\r\nsection 368 of the Criminal Procedure Code - under\r\n\r\nwhich a subordinate court may summarily punish  an\r\n\r\noffender  for contempt only permits the  court  to\r\n\r\nimpose a fine not exceeding $50. And it is only in\r\n\r\ncases  where default in payment of the fine occurs\r\n\r\nthat  imprisonment for a term which may extend  to\r\n\r\ntwo  months may be imposed by the court.  Even  in\r\n\r\nsuch  circumstances the period of imprisonment  is\r\n\r\nterminated the moment the fine is paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the only summary power which a magistrate\r\n\r\nhas  in imposing his will or in attempting to  lay\r\n\r\ndown law and order in his court. The authority and\r\n\r\ndignity of the court, it may be said, depend  very\r\n\r\nmuch  on the traditional respect normally accorded\r\n\r\nto  members  of  the judiciary. Indeed,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\noccasion where a magistrate has felt the desire to\r\n\r\ncall  in  the  aid  of  such  provisions  as   are\r\n\r\ncontained  in Chapter 32 of the Criminal Procedure\r\n\r\nCode in order to maintain the dignity and order of\r\n\r\nproceedings in court, limited though these  powers\r\n\r\nare,  have  been  quite  uncommon.  But  what  had\r\n\r\ntranspired in the course of the morning  when  the\r\n\r\ncases  of the rioters were mentioned in the  Ninth\r\n\r\nMagistrate's  Court  in June last  emphasises  the\r\n\r\nneed  to  enhance the powers of the magistrate  in\r\n\r\nthis  regard.  Hon. Members will agree  that  this\r\n\r\nmust  be so, especially when flagrant insults  and\r\n\r\ndeliberate acts of unruly behaviour calculated  to\r\n\r\nbring  the courts into contempt and ridicule  must\r\n\r\nbe met with means to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimpose sufficient deterrents. In order, therefore,\r\n\r\nthat the administration of criminal justice in our\r\n\r\nsubordinate  courts  may not be  solely  dependent\r\n\r\nupon  traditional respect and in  order  that  the\r\n\r\nsmooth functioning of the machinery of justice may\r\n\r\nnot be in any way impaired, even though these acts\r\n\r\nof  hooliganism are very much the exception rather\r\n\r\nthan the general rule, the Government have thought\r\n\r\nit necessary to introduce this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the proposed amendments to section 368 of our\r\n\r\nCriminal Procedure Code, adequate powers  will  be\r\n\r\nconferred  upon a subordinate court  to  safeguard\r\n\r\nits   dignity   and  to  ensure  its   proper   ad\r\n\r\nministration  of  law  and  order.  Thus  the  new\r\n\r\nsection  368 will empower a subordinate  court  to\r\n\r\nimpose  sentences  of imprisonment  in  the  first\r\n\r\ninstance, should the need arise, for the court  to\r\n\r\nexercise  its  summary powers, to commit  for  con\r\n\r\ntempt. Furthermore, the maximum fine has also been\r\n\r\nraised ten times to $500. The court will now  have\r\n\r\na  discretion  of  imposing  either  sentences  of\r\n\r\nimprisonment in the first instance or  a  fine  or\r\n\r\nimpose   a   sentence  combining  both  forms   of\r\n\r\npunishment.  The Bill which I am  now  seeking  to\r\n\r\nmove  has  been  introduced on  a  Certificate  of\r\n\r\nUrgency  because  of  recent events  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwhich are well known to Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want\r\n\r\nto  make  a general comment on the Bill introduced\r\n\r\nby  the Minister of Defence. As far as I know, the\r\n\r\nCriminal Procedure Code has been in existence  for\r\n\r\nmany   years,  both  in  Singapore  and   in   our\r\n\r\nneighbouring  country,  Malaysia.  In  the   past,\r\n\r\nmagistrates and district judges were held in  high\r\n\r\nesteem  by whoever appeared in court. But nowadays\r\n\r\nconditions have changed and anti-national elements\r\n\r\nwho are misled by their leaders go around flouting\r\n\r\nthe law\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nand   destroying  public  property,  for  example,\r\n\r\nbreaking   traffic  lights,  street   lights   and\r\n\r\ndefacing   decorative,   colourful   arches    and\r\n\r\nscribbling   anti-national   slogans   on   public\r\n\r\nbuildings and so on. Therefore, not only  do  they\r\n\r\nmake  a nuisance of themselves but they also cause\r\n\r\nserious damage to public property by way of public\r\n\r\nfunds.  However,  those caught in  such  acts  are\r\n\r\nsubsequently  charged  in court.  But  when  these\r\n\r\nculprits  are produced in court, they even  behave\r\n\r\nin  an  unruly manner and they do not even respect\r\n\r\nthe court of law. All that the magistrate could do\r\n\r\nis  to  impose  a  fine, a mere sum  of  $50,  for\r\n\r\ncontempt  of  court or, in default of payment,  to\r\n\r\nimprisonment  for a term which may extend  to  two\r\n\r\nmonths  unless  such  fine is  sooner  paid.  This\r\n\r\nmeasure,  I  think,  would  not  be  a  sufficient\r\n\r\ndeterrent. Therefore, with the amendment  of  this\r\n\r\nBill,  the magistrate is given the necessary power\r\n\r\nto increase the fine ten times, as the Minister of\r\n\r\nDefence  has  said, that is, $500,  and  impose  a\r\n\r\nsentence  of  three months. This is an  essential\r\n\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is universally known that the judiciary\r\n\r\nis  independent, in which case, in exercising  its\r\n\r\npowers,  it makes its authority felt. It therefore\r\n\r\nupholds  the  respect for law and, therefore,  the\r\n\r\nflouting  of  the  laws of  a  country  cannot  be\r\n\r\ncondoned. This is not a lawless society  and  when\r\n\r\nthose  charged under the appropriate  sections  of\r\n\r\nthe  law  of the country persist in showing  utter\r\n\r\ncontempt for the sanctity of the law, they must be\r\n\r\nseverely dealt with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, if I may, if I were to be the\r\n\r\nMinister of Defence, I would seek heavier terms of\r\n\r\npunishment,  such as flogging. One stroke  of  the\r\n\r\ncane  would do these anti-national elements a  lot\r\n\r\nof good and, if not, three would definitely do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   I   fully   support  this  amendment   Bill\r\n\r\nintroduced  by  the Minister.

In order  to  uphold\r\n\r\nthe  dignity  of our courts and maintain  law  and\r\n\r\norder  so  that  our  country  may  march  forward\r\n\r\nprogressively and become an industrialised country\r\n\r\nand thus provide a better life for our people,  we\r\n\r\nmust   deal  with  these  anti-national   elements\r\n\r\nseverely  and  prevent them  from  committing  any\r\n\r\nmalicious   acts.  Recently  these   anti-national\r\n\r\nelements openly flouted the law. They carried  out\r\n\r\nillegal  parades  and demonstrations  and  damaged\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres, breaking traffic lights,  etc.\r\n\r\nThey  have openly shown their contempt of the  law\r\n\r\nin  court. They have entirely disregarded law  and\r\n\r\norder. They have caused a lot of inconvenience  to\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public. They have  also  brought\r\n\r\nabout  disrepute and great losses to  our  country\r\n\r\ninternationally.   Ours  is  a   newly-independent\r\n\r\ncountry.  We  are now proceeding with our  nation-\r\n\r\nbuilding.  In  the  past  two  years,   with   the\r\n\r\nharmonious co-operation of the various  races  and\r\n\r\nunder  the judicious leadership of our Government,\r\n\r\nconstruction activities have been going on in many\r\n\r\nflelds,  and,  as  a result, we  have  made  great\r\n\r\nprogress.  But  it is regretted that  these  anti-\r\n\r\nnational  elements are trying every means  to  des\r\n\r\ntroy our nation and prevent our progress. They are\r\n\r\nable to do so because ours is a democratic country\r\n\r\nand our law is rather lax. It is not strict enough\r\n\r\nto deal with them. If such acts had been committed\r\n\r\nin  any Communist country, the culprits would have\r\n\r\nbeen  severely dealt with. For example, they would\r\n\r\nhave  been  sent  to  a  labour  reform  camp   or\r\n\r\nsentenced to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So today it is very timely that this Bill is\r\n\r\nintroduced in this House. I feel that it  will  be\r\n\r\nvery effective in dealing with such people. At the\r\n\r\nsame time, I hope that it will also help those who\r\n\r\nhave gone astray to wake up. I hope they will turn\r\n\r\nover  a  new  leaf  and  become  good  and  useful\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that the anti-national elements are\r\n\r\nalready  bankrupt in political theories. This  can\r\n\r\nbe  shown  by  the  statements  made  by  the  ex-\r\n\r\ndetainees over T.V. Singapura. I hope these  anti-\r\n\r\nnational  elements will learn from the experiences\r\n\r\nand  the new thinking of their elder brothers.  If\r\n\r\nwe want to prevent effectively these illegal acts,\r\n\r\nin  my  opinion, other than this Bill,  public  \r\n\r\ncooperation  and  Press  editorials  are  also  very\r\n\r\neffective  means in achieving this  purpose.  With\r\n\r\nall  of them applying their pressure on the  anti-\r\n\r\nnational  elements, they will achieve  the  effect\r\n\r\ndesired.

If  law  and\r\n\r\norder is to be maintained in the country, there is\r\n\r\na  necessity  for  strict laws. According  to  the\r\n\r\nexisting  legal provisions, there  is  a  possible\r\n\r\nimposition of a fine of $50 and up to two  months'\r\n\r\nimprisonment.  The  proposed amendment  imposes  a\r\n\r\n$500   fine   and  a  maximum  of  three   months'\r\n\r\nimprisonment, or both. Even this increase in  fine\r\n\r\nand  the  term  of  imprisonment  is  not,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  sufficient. The fine has been  increased\r\n\r\nten  times, but the imprisonment period  has  been\r\n\r\nincreased  by  only  50  per  cent.  The  Minister\r\n\r\napparently  has  done this with consideration.  In\r\n\r\nthe present circumstances, it is not difficult for\r\n\r\na person to pay a fine of $500. Those who have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe intention of repeating the same offences would\r\n\r\nbe  quite willing to pay a fine of $500.  But  if,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  a  bigger fine, a  longer  period  of\r\n\r\nimprisonment  is to be imposed, then  people  will\r\n\r\nthink  twice about committing an offence.  In  any\r\n\r\ncase,  this  amended  provision  is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nmaintain   law.  Normally  we  do  not  bring   in\r\n\r\namendments  to  the law unless  it  is  absolutely\r\n\r\nnecessary. In view of the trouble and difficulties\r\n\r\ncreated  by certain people, the amended  provision\r\n\r\nis really welcome and I fully support it. Further,\r\n\r\nif  we  do not bring in this amendment, it is  not\r\n\r\npossible to maintain law and order. Justice cannot\r\n\r\nsurvive without stricter legal provisions. The law\r\n\r\nmust help people and people must help the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, I praise the Minister\r\n\r\nand give my support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  support this amendment and endorse  fully\r\n\r\nthe  words spoken by the Minister of Defence  when\r\n\r\nhe moved the Second Reading of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old section 368 of the Criminal Procedure\r\n\r\nCode   would  have  been  satisfactory  in  normal\r\n\r\ncircumstances  when the politics of Singapore  ran\r\n\r\non  an  even tenor. Unfortunately for us,  certain\r\n\r\ngroups  of  people  in  Singapore  have  of   late\r\n\r\ndeliberately  taken to the path  of  bringing  the\r\n\r\nadministration   of  justice  in  Singapore   into\r\n\r\nhatred,  ridicule  and contempt.  I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nimperative and important indeed that the hands  of\r\n\r\nour  judicial  officers are strengthened  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  able  to deal with situations  of  this\r\n\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have in mind, Mr Speaker, Sir, certain events\r\n\r\nthat   occurred  in  the  9th  Magistrate's  Court\r\n\r\nrecently where, on the magistrate coming into  his\r\n\r\ncourt, certain persons stood up on the benches and\r\n\r\nshowed  their  rears  to  him  -  a  very  serious\r\n\r\nbusiness indeed. I believe that the amendment,  as\r\n\r\nit  stands,  goes a long way towards acting  as  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent against this kind of behaviour. We will,\r\n\r\nhowever,  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nhave to watch the working of this amendment\r\n\r\nand the efficacy with which it acts as a deterrent\r\n\r\nto  see if any further extensions become necessary\r\n\r\nin  the future, because I personally believe  that\r\n\r\nthese actions are politically motivated. They  are\r\n\r\nnot  the  actions of criminally motivated  people;\r\n\r\nthey    are    politically   motivated.   Provided\r\n\r\nsufficient  funds are forthcoming, they  would  do\r\n\r\nthe same thing in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise one or two points of a\r\n\r\nmore  technical nature, Mr Speaker, Sir.  Section\r\n\r\n368  of  the  Criminal Procedure Code  provides  a\r\n\r\nsanction  for  offences defined by  sections  175,\r\n\r\n178,  179, 180 and 228 of the Penal Code. For  our\r\n\r\npurposes  the  most  relevant  section  is  really\r\n\r\nsection  228. If I may briefly refer to the  other\r\n\r\nsections,  section  175  refers  to  omission   to\r\n\r\nproduce  a document required to be produced  by  a\r\n\r\npublic officer. Section 178 deals with refusing to\r\n\r\ntake  an oath. Section 179 deals with refusing  to\r\n\r\nanswer questions by a public servant. Section  180\r\n\r\ndeals  with  refusing  to sign  a  statement,  and\r\n\r\nsection 228, which is the relevant one, deals with\r\n\r\nintentionally insulting or interrupting  a  public\r\n\r\nservant   sitting  in  any  stage  of  a  judicial\r\n\r\nproceeding. I fear that section 228 may not go far\r\n\r\nenough. The ambit of section 228 may not cover the\r\n\r\nspecific  situations that we are  faced  with,  be\r\n\r\ncause  it  says, \"- a public servant... sitting  in\r\n\r\nany  stage of a judicial proceeding\". It could  be\r\n\r\nargued  by  any  lawyer that persons  standing  on\r\n\r\nbenches and showing their rears to a magistrate as\r\n\r\nhe  came  into his court were not covered  by  the\r\n\r\nwords  of  section 228. If this  is  so,  then  of\r\n\r\ncourse  the  amended section 368 of  the  Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure Code will not come into play. This would\r\n\r\nstultify what we are trying to do and I would urge\r\n\r\nthat  section  228  of the Penal  Code  itself  be\r\n\r\nlooked into by the officials concerned with a view\r\n\r\nto extending its ambit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say that it is\r\n\r\nvery  important  indeed that  the  procedures  and\r\n\r\nprocesses of the judiciary, being one of the three\r\n\r\nmain pillars on which the democratic structure  of\r\n\r\nthe Republic of Singapore rests,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  not brought into ridicule and contempt, which\r\n\r\nis  what certain political groups have been trying\r\n\r\nto  do  to  show the people of Singapore that  the\r\n\r\ninstitutions of our State are not worth supporting\r\n\r\nand  that they do not represent the people at all.\r\n\r\nThese  groups  seek to subvert and jeopardise  the\r\n\r\nwhole fabric of political life in our Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  has just introduced this  amendment\r\n\r\nBill  and  I lend my full support to it. First  of\r\n\r\nall,  one  must  know that the Criminal  Procedure\r\n\r\nCode is one of the basic laws of our country. This\r\n\r\nis  not  a  minor  Act,  unlike  other  subsidiary\r\n\r\nlegislation. So this law should be made  effective\r\n\r\nin  order to achieve the purpose for which  it  is\r\n\r\nintended.  It is possible that in other  countries\r\n\r\nwhere  there  is a different but ideal  system  to\r\n\r\nachieve  the purposes intended, there is  no  need\r\n\r\nfor such a law. They may have precedents and other\r\n\r\nsystems. They can still import some legal  aspects\r\n\r\ninto  their  systems,  but  they  are  limited  in\r\n\r\npersonnel to implement the same law. But Singapore\r\n\r\nis  in a different situation. We have a democratic\r\n\r\nsystem  and our laws are based on long traditions.\r\n\r\nWe  should  try to help the Minister  perfect  our\r\n\r\nexisting laws to suit our present situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent past, certain anti-national\r\n\r\nelements tried to disrupt law and order, but  they\r\n\r\ncould  not achieve their purpose. The laws of  our\r\n\r\ncountry are intended to benefit the people but not\r\n\r\nto  restrict  or suppress them unreasonably.  This\r\n\r\namendment Bill imposes only a minor penalty on the\r\n\r\nanti-national elements. What is important  in  law\r\n\r\nis  that  there should be a clear-cut  demarcation\r\n\r\nbetween penalty and reward\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n-  what  merits penalty and what merits reward.  A\r\n\r\n$50  fine  may  be  too small a sum  to  have  any\r\n\r\ndeterrent  effect. We have read in the  newspapers\r\n\r\nof  events  taking  place in  Hongkong  and  other\r\n\r\nplaces. When a riot or civil commotion is  at  its\r\n\r\nheight,  the people involved will go to the  court\r\n\r\nand  write slogans on the walls. Of course, we are\r\n\r\nnot involved\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  this at the moment, but we should take  action\r\n\r\nto  forestall such incidents taking place  in  our\r\n\r\ncountry.  There  should be certain  limits  within\r\n\r\nwhich  activities can be carried out  outside  the\r\n\r\ncourts.  The  law  should not allow  anti-national\r\n\r\nelements  to go beyond these limits. So  they  now\r\n\r\nturn  on the law itself. This is a situation  that\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  allow to be perpetuated. We should  at\r\n\r\nleast  improve our present law in order to prevent\r\n\r\nsuch occurrences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress one point. Singapore is a\r\n\r\ndemocratic country, but it does not mean  that  we\r\n\r\nshould weaken the rule of law. That is not what we\r\n\r\nwant,  if the anti-national elements want to avail\r\n\r\nthemselves  of  our democratic system  to  further\r\n\r\ntheir  nefarious ends, then I stress that the  law\r\n\r\nshould  not allow them opportunities to do  things\r\n\r\nfor  their  own enjoyment. What is wrong  must  be\r\n\r\nwrong.  There must be a clear demarcation  between\r\n\r\nright  and  wrong.  We must  first  lay  a  strong\r\n\r\nfoundation  in our task of nation building.  Every\r\n\r\nnail  should  be  hammered down  securely  in  its\r\n\r\nproper place. So now and then we must keep an  eye\r\n\r\non  our  law  and adjust it to meet  any  possible\r\n\r\nsituation. It does not mean that an increase of  a\r\n\r\n$50  fine  to a $500 fine is the imposition  of  a\r\n\r\nvery  heavy  penalty. The fine  is  increased  ten\r\n\r\ntimes. This ratio indicates that the demand is now\r\n\r\ntenfold for more perfect laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of what I have said, I give my full\r\n\r\nsupport to this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose\r\n\r\nof this amendment Bill is to increase the power of\r\n\r\nthe  Subordinate  Courts to punish  offenders  for\r\n\r\ncontempt  committed  in the  face  of  the  court.\r\n\r\nSection 368 of the Criminal Procedure Code,  which\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  now  seeks to amend,  confers  special\r\n\r\npowers  on the Courts, other than the High  Court,\r\n\r\nto  deal  summarily  with five kinds  of  contempt\r\n\r\nunder the Penal Code. These five kinds of contempt\r\n\r\nhave been briefly referred to by my colleague, the\r\n\r\nMember  for Bukit Panjang, and I need not go  into\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to draw the Minister's attention\r\n\r\nto  section  228 of the Penal Code which  provides\r\n\r\nfor  the  punishment of intentional insults  to  a\r\n\r\npublic  servant sitting in any stage of a judicial\r\n\r\nproceeding.  If  the Minister's  intention  is  to\r\n\r\nprevent a recurrence of what took place in one  of\r\n\r\nour  Courts in June this year, section 228 of  the\r\n\r\nPenal  Code  may have to be looked  into  and,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary,  amended. What happened  in  the  Ninth\r\n\r\nMagistrate's  Court in June this year  was,  as  I\r\n\r\ngather  from  the Press, that the accused  persons\r\n\r\ndeliberately  insulted the Magistrate  by  turning\r\n\r\ntheir  backs towards him when he entered the court\r\n\r\nroom  to  start the proceedings. If that was  what\r\n\r\nhappened, the present wording of section  228  may\r\n\r\ngive  rise  to legal arguments as to whether  such\r\n\r\ninsults  were  offered while  the  Magistrate  was\r\n\r\nsitting in any stage of a judicial proceeding. The\r\n\r\nwords of section 228 of the Penal Code are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Whoever intentionally offers any insult or\r\n\r\ncauses  any  interruption to any  public  servant,\r\n\r\nwhile  such public servant is sitting in any stage\r\n\r\nof  a  judicial proceeding shall be punished  with\r\n\r\nimprisonment  for a term which may extend  to  six\r\n\r\nmonths,  or  with  fine which may  extend  to  one\r\n\r\nthousand\r\n\r\ndollars, or with both.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  operative words are \"is sitting in any  stage\r\n\r\nof  a judicial proceeding\". Does the very entrance\r\n\r\nof a Magistrate into the court house constitute  a\r\n\r\nsitting  in  any  stage of a judicial  proceeding?\r\n\r\nThese  are  the thoughts I have on this  amendment\r\n\r\nBill  -  thoughts  that came to my  mind  in  what\r\n\r\nlittle  time  I  had during the  tea-break  to  do\r\n\r\nresearch. I am glad that my colleague, the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Bukit Panjang, agrees with me and appears  to\r\n\r\nhave  the  same thoughts. I commend these thoughts\r\n\r\nto the Minister for his consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that the purpose\r\n\r\nof  this  amendment is to prevent a recurrence  of\r\n\r\nthe  disgraceful spectacle that took place in  our\r\n\r\nlower Court in June this year. This is a necessary\r\n\r\nmeasure and I am sure that nobody either inside or\r\n\r\noutside   this  House  will  disagree   with   it.\r\n\r\nConsequently, Mr\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I support this amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think there\r\n\r\nis  a  consensus of opinion among Members of  this\r\n\r\nHouse   that  we  should  bring  about  sufficient\r\n\r\ndeterrent   to   prevent  any  contempt   of   the\r\n\r\njudiciary. In fact, some Members have gone so  far\r\n\r\nas to say that the penalties should be increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think that not only Members\r\n\r\nof  this  House  feel that we should  prevent  any\r\n\r\ncontempt  or ridicule of the judiciary,  but  also\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public do feel the same about  it,\r\n\r\nbecause, as has been said by the Member for  Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang, this attempt to ridicule the court is not\r\n\r\nthe  result  of  a  desire to  commit  a  criminal\r\n\r\noffence  but  is purely for political motives.  At\r\n\r\nthis  stage  when all of us are concentrating  our\r\n\r\nenergies  on our work and the public has  accepted\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  we  must, in  order  to  survive,\r\n\r\ndiscipline  ourselves, it therefore  goes  against\r\n\r\npublic  sentiment  to allow a small  anti-national\r\n\r\ngroup to bring ridicule into our courts of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the technical points referred to by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Bukit Pan jang and the Member  for\r\n\r\nChoa Chu Kang, I can only say that, as a layman, I\r\n\r\nwill  give  this amendment a trial. I feel  I  can\r\n\r\ndepend  on  the wisdom of the magistrates  in  the\r\n\r\nsubordinate  courts to apply the law and  that  it\r\n\r\nwould  not be difficult -- here again, I will  not\r\n\r\nget into a legal argument with the Member for Choa\r\n\r\nChu  Kang - for a magistrate to call the  court  to\r\n\r\norder,  if that is the right term, as soon  as  he\r\n\r\ncomes  in.  But  if these people still  insist  on\r\n\r\nbehaving as before, the court could be said to  be\r\n\r\nsitting  in  proceeding when he enters the  court,\r\n\r\nand the law will be put into effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Mr Lim Kim San].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee: reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>STAMP (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.48 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Stamp Ordinance (Chapter\r\n\r\n170 of the Revised Edition)\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>recommendation of President signified (Mr Lim Kim San); \r\n\r\npresented by the Parliamentary Secretary  to the Minister for Finance (Mr Ramaswamy); read the\r\n\r\nFirst  time, to be read a Second time on the  next\r\n\r\navailable  sitting  of  Parliament,  and   to   be\r\n\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE ARMY</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Singapore Army Act, 1965 (No. 13 of 1965)\",\r\n\r\n<br><br>presented by Mr Lim Kim San; read the\r\n\r\nFirst time, to be read a Second time on the next\r\n\r\navailable sitting of Parliament, and to be\r\n\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>POLICE FORCE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Police Force Ordinance, 1958 (No. 32 of 1958)\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>presented by Mr Lim Kim San; read the First time,\r\n\r\nto be read a Second time on the next available\r\n\r\nsitting of Parliament, and to be printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MONEYLENDERS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.51 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

The Bill before the House\r\n\r\naccordingly gives effect to Government's\r\n\r\nintentions in this regard,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, exemptions have been granted under\r\n\r\nsection 2 of the Moneylenders Ordinance, 1959, far\r\n\r\ntoo  freely to any body corporate or society which\r\n\r\napplied to be exempted from the provisions of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  This  practice has been  found  to  be\r\n\r\nundesirable  and will be discontinued.  Clauses  2\r\n\r\nand  9  accordingly empower the Minister to impose\r\n\r\nconditions when granting exemptions in future  and\r\n\r\ninitially restrict the period of exemption  for  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  three years. Any body corporate  which\r\n\r\nhas  been  exempted  up  to  the  time  that  this\r\n\r\nlegislation comes into force will continue  to  be\r\n\r\nso  exempted until the end of this year. Thereupon\r\n\r\nit follows that such bodies corporate will have to\r\n\r\napply for future exemptions to the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many borrowers complain that they receive from\r\n\r\ntheir moneylenders smaller sums of money than  the\r\n\r\namounts  they  were  made  to  sign  for  on   the\r\n\r\npromissory notes. Subsection (2) of section 16  of\r\n\r\nthe   Ordinance,  which  attempts  to  remedy  the\r\n\r\nsituation by requiring the moneylender to issue  a\r\n\r\ncrossed  cheque,  a  crossed postal  order,  or  a\r\n\r\ncrossed  money order niade payable to the borrower\r\n\r\nif the loan is $100 or above, has been found to be\r\n\r\ninadequate,  as  moneylenders can  with  a  little\r\n\r\ningenuity evade the provisions of the subsection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 proposes to remedy the situation by\r\n\r\nrequiring moneylenders to make a loan of $100 or\r\n\r\nabove in the form of a crossed cheque with the\r\n\r\nwords \"Licensed Moneylender\" endorsed thereon. Any\r\n\r\nmoneylender or his agent shall not present to any\r\n\r\nbank account any crossed cheque drawn by another\r\n\r\nmoneylender or his agent and made payable to a\r\n\r\nborrower - sub-clause (3) . By sub-clause (4) a\r\n\r\nperson who is not a moneylender shall not present\r\n\r\nto any bank more than two of such crossed cheques\r\n\r\nin any one month. A bank manager may be required\r\n\r\nto furnish information to the Public Prosecutor to\r\n\r\nfacilitate the identification of any person\r\n\r\nsuspected of having committed an offence under\r\n\r\nthis clause, having an account with his bank -\r\n\r\nsubclause (5).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 requires a moneylender to afford the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  access  to the cheques  issued  by  him\r\n\r\nwhich  have  been  cleared  and  to  any  note  or\r\n\r\nmemorandum  setting out a contract  in  which  the\r\n\r\nmoneylender is or has been concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 is an important provision, for it\r\n\r\nrequires   moneylenders  to   endorse   on   their\r\n\r\npromissory notes the amounts of money they receive\r\n\r\nfrom  their borrowers immediately after  receiving\r\n\r\nsuch  repayments.  A penalty is provided  for  con\r\n\r\ntravention of this provision. This clause seeks to\r\n\r\nremedy  the  usual complaint that moneylenders  do\r\n\r\nnot  give receipts for or make any records of  the\r\n\r\nsums  they receive from their borrowers on account\r\n\r\nof  principal or interest. And it further provides\r\n\r\nthat  if a moneylender has been convicted of  such\r\n\r\nan  offence,  he  will be unable  to  enforce  the\r\n\r\ncontract for the recovery of any monies due to him\r\n\r\nfrom the borrower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, by sub-clause (6) , the court is\r\n\r\nempowered to endorse details of such conviction on\r\n\r\nthe  note  or  memorandum.

The  object  of  the  repeal  was   to\r\n\r\nassimilate   the  law  applicable  to  proceedings\r\n\r\nagainst public authorities with that applicable in\r\n\r\nother   cases,   with  the  result   that   public\r\n\r\nauthorities   ceased  to  enjoy   any   privileged\r\n\r\nposition  in  litigation.

But, nevertheless, it is  a  matter\r\n\r\nand  a  problem which most people face and  suffer\r\n\r\ndaily.  I  refer  to  the  filthy  and  unhygienic\r\n\r\nconditions of the toilet facilities in most of the\r\n\r\nRepublic's    coffee   shops,    eating    houses,\r\n\r\nrestaurants  and  public conveniences  which  have\r\n\r\nbeen  allowed  to  continue under  such  unhealthy\r\n\r\nconditions for such a long time. Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis will certainly not attract tourism. Are we to\r\n\r\nremain complacent and tolerate such filthy and unhygienic    conditions   indefinitely?    It    is\r\n\r\nacknowledged  that  we  have  one  of   the   best\r\n\r\nstandards of health in this part of the world. Are\r\n\r\nwe   not  going  to  maintain  and  improve   this\r\n\r\nstandard?  Toilet  facilities  are  one   of   the\r\n\r\nessential  items  which is being used  daily.  Yet\r\n\r\nmost  coffee  shops, eating houses and  restaurant\r\n\r\nowners   pay   very  little  concern   for   their\r\n\r\ncleanliness.   In   quite  a   number   of   these\r\n\r\nestablishments,  the  water  closets   have   been\r\n\r\ndeliberately  jammed and spoilt in order  to  save\r\n\r\nwater expenses. I need not describe the untidiness\r\n\r\nof  the  water  closets  in these  public  places.\r\n\r\nMembers will undoubtedly have faced the situation.\r\n\r\nIn  quite a number of these public places, food is\r\n\r\nalso  being  prepared for consumption adjacent  to\r\n\r\nthese  filthy lavatories. So far the Public Health\r\n\r\nDivision  has  had no effective  control  of  this\r\n\r\nproblem. It is appreciated that effective  control\r\n\r\nmay  be  difficult because it would need  a  large\r\n\r\nforce to police these establishments. But are they\r\n\r\nnot operating on licences issued by the Health\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMinistry  under regulations with which they  would\r\n\r\nhave  to  comply?

A\r\n\r\nposter   competition   is   being   organised   in\r\n\r\nconjunction  with the campaign.

He  has,\r\n\r\nhowever,  been  fair  to  indicate  that   it   is\r\n\r\nacknowledged  that  we  do  have  a  fairly   high\r\n\r\nstandard  of  health in this country  as  compared\r\n\r\nwith  that of neighbouring territories - not  that\r\n\r\nwe  should  be satisfied and complacent with  that\r\n\r\nstatement,  because  we  can  always  improve   on\r\n\r\npresent standards to bring them to a higher level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must, however, indicate certain difficulties\r\n\r\nwhich  are  being encountered in the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth. Perhaps much more can be done and a higher\r\n\r\nstandard  of  cleanliness  can  be  maintained  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  if the social habits of our people  are\r\n\r\nof  a  high order. I think it is well known  that,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, such a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstandard of social behaviour is certainly  lacking\r\n\r\namongst  large sections of the public.  Take,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  public places like parks, the  Esplanade\r\n\r\nand places where people congregate together. There\r\n\r\nis  a  very  shocking  lack of  dustbins  in  such\r\n\r\nplaces.  We  do  not  even see  a  single  dustbin\r\n\r\naround.  Nowhere  else in the world  does  such  a\r\n\r\nsituation exist. This means that the thousands who\r\n\r\ndo  go to these places for entertainment are liter\r\n\r\nally  being  invited  to throw  their  litter  and\r\n\r\nrubbish on the ground and make it a filthy  place.\r\n\r\nIf  it  is an accepted form of behaviour  just  to\r\n\r\nthrow  litter  around, then when they  go  to  the\r\n\r\nwater  closet, especially if it is a public  water\r\n\r\ncloset,  they just do their business anywhere  and\r\n\r\ncare nothing about it. It is very difficult indeed\r\n\r\nto  get  public health inspectors prowling  around\r\n\r\nparks to catch people throwing litter, or prowling\r\n\r\nnear  water closets to make sure that the man  who\r\n\r\nhas  gone in to do his business will go on  to  do\r\n\r\nthe needful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say, Sir, that it may take some time to\r\n\r\neducate   our  population  to  behave  themselves.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  we  will  have  to  start  off  with  our\r\n\r\nchildren in schools and teach them to have  better\r\n\r\nhealth  habits  - habits of personal  hygiene  and\r\n\r\ngood  habits  of  not throwing litter  around.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, we should have more litter bins, and  this\r\n\r\nis going to be done very soon. We shall be placing\r\n\r\nat  least 2,500 litter bins in bus shelters and in\r\n\r\nparks. That is the first lesson. We cannot provide\r\n\r\n20,000   litter   bins  because  the   expenditure\r\n\r\ninvolved will be considerable. But we are making a\r\n\r\nstart and it is very likely that very soon we will\r\n\r\nbe able to maintain a campaign of higher standards\r\n\r\nof  public  health with poster competitions,  with\r\n\r\npublic  health lessons being introduced  into  the\r\n\r\nschools  curriculum and so on, so that  ultimately\r\n\r\nwe will have not only young children playing their\r\n\r\npart  but  they will be telling their  elders  who\r\n\r\nhave filthy habits to behave themselves at home as\r\n\r\nwell as in public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this will take some time. But that is not an\r\n\r\nexcuse.  If  the  Ministry's officials  should  be\r\n\r\nfailing   in  their  duties  to  inspect  licensed\r\n\r\npremises, as stated by the Member for River Valley -  here  again  there are problems concerning  the\r\n\r\nvolume  of  work involved. There are in  Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday  close  to  1,900  licensed  eating  houses,\r\n\r\nrestaurants  and coffee shops. We  have  a  Public\r\n\r\nHealth  Inspectorate  of  under  100.  They   are,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  expected to inspect licensed  premises\r\n\r\nonce  a month. For the first eight months of  this\r\n\r\nyear,  as many as 12,738 visits have been made  by\r\n\r\nthe Public Health Inspectorate. Of this number, on\r\n\r\n344  occasions - three per cent of their visits  - they  did  find  that  the toilets  of  the  1,900\r\n\r\nlicensed  premises were in a filthy condition.  It\r\n\r\nis then the duty of the Public Health Inspector to\r\n\r\ntell  the  proprietor  to do something  about  his\r\n\r\ntoilet, to keep it in a clean state, flush it, and\r\n\r\nso  on, and to return a few days later to see that\r\n\r\nthe  work is done. It has been found that in  most\r\n\r\ncases  the proprietors do comply. It has not  been\r\n\r\nfound  necessary so far to cancel any licence  for\r\n\r\nfailure to clean the toilets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for River Valley has indicated that\r\n\r\nthere   has  been  deliberate  jamming  of   water\r\n\r\nconnections in water closets. When this arises and\r\n\r\nif  a  specific report is made to us, we shall  be\r\n\r\nable  to  follow it up and put matters right.  But\r\n\r\nwhere  the coffee shop or eating house is situated\r\n\r\nin  a  strategic place, like being close to a bus-stop,  or  near  public places  of  entertainment,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  tendency for gross over-use  of  the\r\n\r\ntoilet  facilities, because members of the  public\r\n\r\njust  walk  into the shops concerned  and  relieve\r\n\r\nthemselves but do nothing about it, and  therefore\r\n\r\nmess up the place. So some shopkeepers have become\r\n\r\nso desperate that they have decided to lock up the\r\n\r\nwater  closets.  When  this  was  brought  to  our\r\n\r\nknowledge, we naturally had to tell the proprietor\r\n\r\nthat   he  could  not  just  lock  up  the  public\r\n\r\nconvenience  and that he should  open  it.  It  is\r\n\r\npossible  that  in certain cases, the  proprietors\r\n\r\nwere  so  desperate  about the over-use  of  their\r\n\r\nwater closets that they thought\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  by closing the water connections the  toilet\r\n\r\nwould be so filthy that people would not make  use\r\n\r\nof  it. But l am afraid that is not exactly what is\r\n\r\nhappening, because people still do their  business\r\n\r\nand make things worse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would prefer that this question be tackled in\r\n\r\na  different  way.  It is no  use  just  making  a\r\n\r\nsweeping  statement that everything is filthy  and\r\n\r\nwhat can we do about it, and so on. Naturally, the\r\n\r\nanswer will be, \"Of course, we will try to do  the\r\n\r\nbest  we  can.\"  But  surely the  problem  can  be\r\n\r\ntackled in this way. If a Member of Parliament  or\r\n\r\na  member  of  the  public  knows  of  the  filthy\r\n\r\nconditions of a particular shop, he can just  give\r\n\r\nus  a note to that effect, and we will be able  to\r\n\r\nfollow  it up and rectify the situation.  We  will\r\n\r\nthen be tackling specific instances, whether it is\r\n\r\nin   the   River   Valley  Constituency,   Punggol\r\n\r\nConstituency or Jurong Constituency, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about Geylang West?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Geylang West is very well\r\n\r\nbehaved, because it is the first constituency that\r\n\r\nhas  had its hawkers licensed and resited. Hawkers\r\n\r\non the five-foot ways have been cleared. About 200\r\n\r\nhawkers  over  a  stretch of 100 yards  outside  a\r\n\r\nmarket  in  Lorong  Taha dispersed  of  their  own\r\n\r\naccord.   They   took   down  their   unauthorised\r\n\r\nstructures  and got everything nicely  reallocated\r\n\r\nin  Lorongs  5  and  7. The drains  were  cleared;\r\n\r\nmosquitoes got less; there were less flies. Surely\r\n\r\nGeylang  West is now a model constituency for  any\r\n\r\nMember of Parliament to come along to see!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one little correction which I have to\r\n\r\nmake.  The  Member for River Valley has said  that\r\n\r\nthere will be a $5 fine for a householder who  has\r\n\r\nno  dustbin. I am afraid he has got it all  wrong.\r\n\r\nThe  penalty will not be just $5 - it will be very\r\n\r\npunitive.  What  we say is this. We  expect  every\r\n\r\nhouseholder, whether he stays in the  kampongs  of\r\n\r\nSembawang  or  urban areas like  Geylang  West  or\r\n\r\nAnson  or Tanjong Pagar, to provide a dust-bin  of\r\n\r\nhis own. But should some\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nhouseholders be found without a dustbin,  we  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  give them adequate notice saying,  \"Look\r\n\r\nhere,  we find that you have no dust-bin. Can  you\r\n\r\nplease  provide a dust-bin within seven days,  let\r\n\r\nus  say, or else we will provide you with one  and\r\n\r\ncharge you for it? It might be $5, or it might  be\r\n\r\n$10  for  the dustbin.\" But we are going to  amend\r\n\r\nour legislation so that there will be a very heavy\r\n\r\npenalty  for  people who just throw  rubbish  from\r\n\r\ntheir  houses on to the roads and into the drains.\r\n\r\nThe  first offence will be $150, not $5  which  is\r\n\r\nchicken feed. The second offence will be $500. The\r\n\r\nthird one will be $1,000. The social habits of our\r\n\r\npeople - mainly the hawkers - are bad because they\r\n\r\nare  irresponsible, and that is what is  happening\r\n\r\ntoday.  Hawkers  are  only  interested  in  making\r\n\r\nmoney.  We  like  them  to  be  able  to  earn   a\r\n\r\nlivelihood, but the way in which they throw  their\r\n\r\nrefuse  on to the roads and into the drains  is  a\r\n\r\nridiculous state of affairs which has  got  to  be\r\n\r\nstopped.  When  we go along the  streets,  we  see\r\n\r\npeople  sweeping refuse into the drains as if  the\r\n\r\ndrains  are  dust-bins.  We  have  to  stop   this\r\n\r\nnonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with this new legislation, we will be able to\r\n\r\nbring  home to our people the fact that they  have\r\n\r\nto  learn how to dispose of their refuse properly,\r\n\r\nby placing it in a dust-bin with a proper lid. Our\r\n\r\nworkers  will then be expected to perform a  daily\r\n\r\ncleansing  service,  and if  that  does  not  come\r\n\r\nabout,  please  give us a report and  disciplinary\r\n\r\naction   will  be  taken  against  the  particular\r\n\r\ncleansing worker who fails to do his duty. We will\r\n\r\ntherefore  have,  as a first  stage,  to  get  our\r\n\r\nworkers in the Public Cleansing Department  to  do\r\n\r\ntheir  work.  I think we have reached  that  stage\r\n\r\nnow.  The second stage is to get the public to  do\r\n\r\ntheir  share of putting their refuse inside proper\r\n\r\ndust-bins,  failing which we will  have  to  be  a\r\n\r\nlittle   hard  on  theni  if  they  cannot  behave\r\n\r\nthemselves. There is every possibility that within\r\n\r\nthe next few months, things will be tightening  up\r\n\r\nand that there will be more cleanliness around the\r\n\r\ncity. In fact, it must be admitted that things are\r\n\r\nlooking  better than before. The city is certainly\r\n\r\nmuch cleaner\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow  than before the February strike.

There  is adequate rice in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe retail price of rice in Singapore, although it\r\n\r\nhas  been  higher  than in  the  past,  is  mainly\r\n\r\ndetermined by the supply and demand of  the  world\r\n\r\nmarket for rice, since Singapore produces no  rice\r\n\r\nof its own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the increase in the price of rice, the\r\n\r\nprices  of  sugar, flour, cooking  oil  and  other\r\n\r\nessential   commodities   have   not   shown   any\r\n\r\nsubstantial increases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is therefore no pressing need to ask\r\n\r\nshopkeepers to display price tags.

One  because  the\r\n\r\nowner fell seriously ill. Several others which are\r\n\r\ntextile  mills  had  to  close  down  because   of\r\n\r\nimposition of textile quotas by the U.K, and  the\r\n\r\nU.S.  Governments and the rest because  the  major\r\n\r\nshareholders could not agree among themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has in its industrial promotion\r\n\r\nefforts  put  particular  emphasis  on  industries\r\n\r\nwhich  show  promise  of high export  performance.\r\n\r\nThus,  in a number of cases more than one  pioneer\r\n\r\ncertificate has been issued in the same  industry.\r\n\r\nIn   most   of  these  cases,  a  minimum   export\r\n\r\nperformance  is  a condition of  the  award  of  a\r\n\r\npioneer  certificate. In the case of  the  plywood\r\n\r\nindustry,  any one of the firms would be  able  to\r\n\r\nsupply  the  entire  local  demand.  However,  the\r\n\r\nexport  potential of this industry is  very  great\r\n\r\nand, therefore, the Government has thought it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfit to award more than one pioneer certificate  in\r\n\r\norder  to encourage this type of export-orientated\r\n\r\nindustry.  Ours  is essentially a free  enterprise\r\n\r\neconomy and if there is no profit to be made in an\r\n\r\nindustry, investors would not be prepared to  risk\r\n\r\ntheir  money in starting a factory when  there  is\r\n\r\nalready  another  factory in  production.
