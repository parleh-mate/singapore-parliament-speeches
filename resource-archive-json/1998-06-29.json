It  accounted  for  18%  of  regional  (Indonesia,\r\n\r\nThailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei) exports and 7.6%\r\n\r\nof Singapore's total non-oil domestic exports in 1997. A falling\r\n\r\nyen  would  raise the prices of imported goods  into  Japan  and\r\n\r\nfurther  dampen  the weak demand for regional imports  including\r\n\r\nthose  from  Singapore. Japan is also an  important  market  for\r\n\r\nSingapore's  services exports. For example,  it  is  our  second\r\n\r\nlargest  single market for tourism, accounting for 15% of  total\r\n\r\nvisitor  arrivals  in 1997. A continuing weakening  of  the  yen\r\n\r\nwould  lead  to  a  further  decline in  Japanese  arrivals  and\r\n\r\naggravate   the  slowdown  in  retail,  restaurant   and   hotel\r\n\r\nbusinesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The region has also been a major recipient of Japanese\r\n\r\nforeign  capital. Direct investments from Japan  have  accounted\r\n\r\nfor  an  increasing  share  of total foreign  direct  investment\r\n\r\napprovals   in  ASEAN-3,  which  are  Indonesia,  Thailand   and\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  from 15% in 1992 to 24% in 1996. In Singapore,  Japan\r\n\r\ncontributed a significant 21.5% of total FDI inflow between 1990-95.  A  weakening  of  the yen would adversely  affect  Japanese\r\n\r\ncompanies' overseas expansion plans. This could have a dampening\r\n\r\neffect on the growth of Japanese investments in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, a weakening of the yen is likely to exacerbate\r\n\r\nthe  weak balance sheet position of Japanese banks, which  would\r\n\r\nlead  to  a  further  consolidation  of  Japanese  international\r\n\r\nbanking  activities, including those in the Asian Dollar  Market\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. This would in turn adversely affect the growth of\r\n\r\nthe financial services sector in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a significant exporter of electronics goods, Japan also\r\n\r\ncompetes with Singapore and some of the other regional economies\r\n\r\nin  major  markets  such as the United States  and  Europe.  The\r\n\r\ncontinued  depreciation of the yen will therefore exert  greater\r\n\r\ncompetitive pressure on regional exports. Finally, as  shown  by\r\n\r\nevents in recent weeks, a weakening of the yen has a tendency to\r\n\r\nunsettle regional financial markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NEW INVESTORS AND INVESTMENTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Inderjit Singh</b> asked the Minister for Trade and\r\n\r\nIndustry (a) if he will indicate the number of new investors and\r\n\r\namount  of  investment Singapore attracted from January  to  May\r\n\r\n1998 and how these figures compare to the projected figures; (b)\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the  outlook for new investments for the rest  of  the\r\n\r\nyear; and (c) whether we lost any investors because of the  high\r\n\r\nproperty  cost and the high land rentals charged by  the  Jurong\r\n\r\nTown Corporation and the Housing and Development Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Second Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, based on the latest figures, 107\r\n\r\nnew  projects  in manufacturing were committed from  January  to\r\n\r\nJune  1998.  These investments are expected to generate a value-added of $2.6 billion and employment of 10,500, of which 41%  of\r\n\r\nthe jobs are for knowledge and skilled workers.  The fixed asset\r\n\r\ninvestments totalled $3.9 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the exportable services sector, 48 projects were\r\n\r\ncommitted as of June this year.  When fully realised, they  will\r\n\r\nyield  a value-added of $823 million and create 2,600 jobs,  66%\r\n\r\nof  which are for knowledge and skilled workers.  These projects\r\n\r\nare  expected  to  record  a  total business  spending  of  $723\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large proportion of investments this year are based on\r\n\r\ndecisions  made last year.  Investments for the  rest  of  1998,\r\n\r\n1999  and  beyond  will depend on further  developments  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation in Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When companies evaluate whether to invest in Singapore,\r\n\r\nland cost or rental is only one out of many factors that  are\r\n\r\ntaken   into   consideration.    Other   factors   such    as\r\n\r\ncapabilities, wage rates, infrastructure support  and  market\r\n\r\npotential  are important considerations as well.   Certainly,\r\n\r\nthe appreciation of the Singapore dollar against the regional\r\n\r\ncurrencies  has  affected our cost competitiveness  vis-a-vis\r\n\r\nother  regional  countries. This may have  been  one  of  the\r\n\r\nfactors that have caused some companies to re-evaluate  their\r\n\r\ninvestment  plans.

We have  not\r\n\r\nyet  reached  agreement on such a broader package of cooperation\r\n\r\nwhich  would include the long-term supply of water to Singapore.\r\n\r\nIf  this  can  be  agreed, there is considerable  potential  for\r\n\r\nmutually  beneficial  cooperation in a wide  variety  of  areas.\r\n\r\nThis  would include the development of the Malayan Railway  Land\r\n\r\nat  Bukit Timah which is not covered by the Points of Agreement.\r\n\r\nMembers will recall that the Prime Minister made this point when\r\n\r\nhe  spoke about the framework of wider cooperation in this House\r\n\r\non 5th June 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at today's sitting, Minister for Finance, Dr Richard\r\n\r\nHu,  will  move  the  Second Reading of the Customs  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.  This amendment has to do with the shifting of Singapore's\r\n\r\nCustoms,  Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) facilities  from  the\r\n\r\nrailway  station at Tanjong Pagar to the new facilities  at  the\r\n\r\ntrain checkpoint in Woodlands on 1st August 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had informed Malaysia of our intention to move to\r\n\r\nWoodlands  as  early  as 1989 and repeated  on  many  subsequent\r\n\r\noccasions.  We have also informed Malaysia that once Singapore's\r\n\r\nCIQ  facilities  move  to Woodlands, Malaysia's  CIQ  operations\r\n\r\ncould  no  longer  continue in Tanjong Pagar because  Malaysia's\r\n\r\nCustoms  and Immigration officials would have no legal authority\r\n\r\nto  exercise such functions in Singapore in the absence of their\r\n\r\nSingapore  counterparts. Moreover, they would be  clearing  rail\r\n\r\npassengers  for entry into Malaysia before they are cleared  for\r\n\r\nexit  from  Singapore by the Singapore CIQ at Woodlands.    This\r\n\r\nsequence  of clearance would not only be illogical and  contrary\r\n\r\nto  international practice but could also present other problems\r\n\r\nsuch as in crime investigation and prosecution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 1993, Malaysia agreed that they relocate their\r\n\r\nCIQ facilities to Woodlands together with Singapore. However, in\r\n\r\nJune 1997, one year ago, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMalaysians told us that they had changed their mind and did  not\r\n\r\nwish  to  co-locate their CIQ facilities with ours at  Woodlands\r\n\r\nafter all, thereby rejecting Singapore's offer to move their CIQ\r\n\r\nto    Woodlands.     Therefore,   the   present   administrative\r\n\r\narrangements  which allow Malaysia to exercise CIQ functions  at\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar will cease after 1st August 1998.  The Malaysians\r\n\r\nwere  informed  of  this  in  July  last  year  and  on  several\r\n\r\nsubsequent occasions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say, Sir, that this does not affect the status of\r\n\r\nthe  Malayan  Railway  Land which is subject  to  the  POA.   As\r\n\r\nMembers  are  aware, the Prime Minister and I  had  briefed  the\r\n\r\nHouse  in June 1997 on the background to the POA.  Members  will\r\n\r\nrecall  it was our decision to relocate our CIQ to Woodlands  in\r\n\r\n1989 which prompted the negotiations culminating in the POA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, Sir, Singapore and Malaysia are bound by a\r\n\r\nmultiplicity  of complex  ties. Any relationship of  such  close\r\n\r\ninterdependence is bound to go through different phases.  It  is\r\n\r\nonly natural that there will be ups and downs. What is important\r\n\r\nis  that we do not lose sight of the central fact of our  inter-twined  destinies.  That was why the Prime Minister went  up  to\r\n\r\nKuala Lumpur in February, and issued a Joint Communique with  Dr\r\n\r\nMahathir to pursue a \"prosper-thy-neighbour\" policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have stated in this House before, after Separation,\r\n\r\nMalaysia and Singapore have become two different societies, each\r\n\r\nhaving  its  own  distinct national character and  culture.   We\r\n\r\ncompete  as  well  as  cooperate to  advance  our  own  national\r\n\r\ninterests.   This too is only natural, as leaders  in  both  our\r\n\r\ncountries   have   recognised.   Singapore   will   manage   our\r\n\r\nrelationship  with  Malaysia on the  basis  of  reciprocity  and\r\n\r\nmutual respect for each other's interests.  We are committed  to\r\n\r\nforging a long-term relationship of mutual benefit with Malaysia\r\n\r\non this basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has said that\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  Government  will,  willy-nilly,  move  the  CIQ\r\n\r\noperations to Woodlands as from 1st\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAugust 1998.

But  if   there   are\r\n\r\ndifficulties  and,  if  further negotiations  are  needed,  then\r\n\r\nobviously  we  have  to  press on, in  good  faith,  beyond  the\r\n\r\ndeadline.   I would not want now to set a clear fixed  deadline.\r\n\r\nWhat  I can say is, as I have mentioned in my main answer,  that\r\n\r\nwe will resume the negotiations when the Malaysian Government is\r\n\r\nready.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister to confirm  that, in international  practice,\r\n\r\nchecks are normally carried out at the nearest checkpoint and  I\r\n\r\nthink  Woodlands checkpoint is the most suitable.   Members  who\r\n\r\nare not aware of the international practice will be glad to know\r\n\r\nthe  Government's position because in most countries it  is  the\r\n\r\nnearest  point  when you enter the country.

I would have thought that  the\r\n\r\ndecision by both countries to resolve an outstanding dispute  on\r\n\r\nPedra  Branca is a very good example to other countries  of  how\r\n\r\nsuch  difficult  issues  can  be resolved  in  an  amicable  and\r\n\r\npeaceful  manner,  in  this  case,  by  resort  to  third  party\r\n\r\njudgement,  ie,  the International Court of Justice.

Other  issues  have  to  be  resolved  by\r\n\r\nnegotiations,  sometimes  protracted negotiations,  by  the  two\r\n\r\ncountries and the two governments themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, according to recent press reports,\r\n\r\nSingapore  motorists  have  been  taken  to  task  by  Malaysian\r\n\r\nauthorities for not paying traffic fines there.

The position of the Singapore  Government  is\r\n\r\nthat  if our citizens go abroad, to whichever country, we expect\r\n\r\nthem to abide by the laws and regulations of that country.   And\r\n\r\nif  indeed  the  facts  are that Singapore motorists  have  been\r\n\r\ndelinquent and not paid up the fines and traffic summonses, then\r\n\r\nthey  will  obviously  have to face the  penalties  just  as  we\r\n\r\nrequire  foreigners coming to Singapore to observe our laws  and\r\n\r\nface the consequences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me also say that this is a problem\r\n\r\nwhich  is  not unique just to Malaysia.  Singapore has the  flip\r\n\r\nside of the problem also, because I am told that the problem  of\r\n\r\nforeign  traffic defaulters not paying up summonses  or  meeting\r\n\r\nwarrants of arrest in Singapore is also quite a big problem.   I\r\n\r\nam   told   that  there  are  some  80,000  outstanding  traffic\r\n\r\nsummonses, most of which, of course, will be Malaysians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RATES OF CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND CONTRIBUTIONS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Reduction)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Manpower, in\r\n\r\nthe   light  of  the  further  deterioration  of  the   economic\r\n\r\nsituation,  whether the rates of CPF contribution in respect  of\r\n\r\nemployers  and/or employees will be cut and if so, by  how  many\r\n\r\npercentage points.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Government  has  indicated that  if  the  preliminary\r\n\r\nestimates for Singapore's second quarter growth shows a  further\r\n\r\nslowdown,  off-Budget  measures to  help  the  economy  will  be\r\n\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Off-Budget measures including raising Government's\r\n\r\nexpenditure for infrastructure projects and cutting the cost  of\r\n\r\ndoing  business  will be announced by the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nlater  today.   A cut in CPF contribution rate  is  one  of  the\r\n\r\noptions  that we had considered in view of the deterioration  of\r\n\r\neconomic prospects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this is a drastic measure, we should not rush into\r\n\r\ncutting  CPF.  The National Wages Council has recently announced\r\n\r\nits  recommendations  urging companies and workers  to  exercise\r\n\r\nwage restraint to tide over the difficult period.  Although  our\r\n\r\neconomy  has  slowed down considerably, we have not  experienced\r\n\r\nnegative growth yet, as in 1985.  The wage structure in 1985 was\r\n\r\nalso  more rigid, leaving little room for adjustments.  However,\r\n\r\nwith the flexi-wage system that is in place today, companies can\r\n\r\nnow  reduce their wage cost by adjusting their variable payment,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  AWS  (or Annual Wage Supplement)  based  on  the\r\n\r\nperformance  of the company.  Reduction of the CPF  contribution\r\n\r\nshould be implemented only if these cost cutting measures need a\r\n\r\nfurther boost.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, do the Minister and the\r\n\r\nGovernment  appreciate  that with the  downturn  in  the  retail\r\n\r\ntrade,  it will be a good thing to put some money back into  the\r\n\r\npockets  of  the consumers?  For that reason, has the Government\r\n\r\nconsidered cutting down the employee's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  the CPF, not the employer's contribution?   We\r\n\r\ncan  maintain  the  employer's contribution  but  cut  down  the\r\n\r\nemployee's contribution to CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if we cut down the\r\n\r\nemployee's CPF contribution rate, then we will also have a  very\r\n\r\nsignificant  impact  on the workers' ability  to  service  their\r\n\r\nmortgage  loan  repayments, because many CPF members  depend  on\r\n\r\ntheir monthly CPF contributions to service their mortgage loans.\r\n\r\nIf  you  cut down on the employee's CPF contribution,  obviously\r\n\r\nmany  CPF members will have to come out with their own  cash  to\r\n\r\nmeet the monthly repayment.  So it may not be of much benefit in\r\n\r\nterms  of boosting the spending power of the consumer.   Cutting\r\n\r\nCPF should be taken as a cost reduction measure rather than as a\r\n\r\nconsumption  stimulation measure.  And if we do eventually  have\r\n\r\nto  cut  the  CPF because the economic situation has got  worse,\r\n\r\nthen  cutting the employer's CPF contribution makes  more  logic\r\n\r\nand  it  is  more  rational  than  cutting  the  employee's  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, in 1985, I believe\r\n\r\nthe  employer's component was cut by 15 percentage points.

This is the highest quarterly figure ever  recorded\r\n\r\nsince  retrenchment  data  was  first  compiled  in  1983.   The\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the retrenched workers were from the manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector,  mainly the electronics, electrical, and  petroleum  and\r\n\r\nchemical products industries.  Survey findings show that 63%  of\r\n\r\nthe  local workers retrenched in the fourth quarter of 1997 were\r\n\r\nre-employed  by March 1998.  This was significantly  lower  than\r\n\r\nthe  72% re-employment rate of those who were retrenched in  the\r\n\r\nprevious two quarters.  Retrenched workers with higher education\r\n\r\nand  skills generally enjoyed better re-employment prospects  as\r\n\r\ncompared to those with lower education and skills.  The Ministry\r\n\r\nwill continue to monitor the retrenchment situation closely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in number of workers being retrenched is not\r\n\r\nunexpected.   In fact, in anticipation of this, my Ministry  had\r\n\r\nin late February set up a Tripartite Panel on Retrenched Workers\r\n\r\nto prepare for this eventuality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panel comprises representatives from the Ministry of\r\n\r\nManpower  (MOM),  EDB,  PSB, NTUC, and  the  Singapore  National\r\n\r\nEmployers' Federation (SNEF).  I am pleased to inform the  House\r\n\r\nthat the Panel has completed its deliberations and has submitted\r\n\r\nits  recommendations.  As announced during a press  briefing  on\r\n\r\n26th   June   1998,  my  Ministry  has  accepted   the   Panel's\r\n\r\nrecommendations  and will implement them with  effect  from  1st\r\n\r\nJuly 1998.  Sir, let me highlight the key recommendations of the\r\n\r\nPanel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to minimise retrenchment, the Panel recommended that a\r\n\r\nRetrenchment Advisory Programme involving MOM, EDB,  PSB,  NTUC,\r\n\r\nand  SNEF be implemented.  Under the Advisory Service Programme,\r\n\r\ncompanies   with   excess   manpower   and   are   contemplating\r\n\r\nretrenchment would be encouraged to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovide  advance  information to any of these agencies  so  that\r\n\r\nappropriate  advice on the various alternatives to  retrenchment\r\n\r\ncould  be  given.  These alternatives include the implementation\r\n\r\nof  shorter  workweek and temporary lay-off, making use  of  the\r\n\r\nflexible  wage system to reduce cost and avoid retrenchment,  as\r\n\r\nwell as sending of their workers for subsidized training through\r\n\r\nthe Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP) during the lull period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Retrenchment Advisory Programme, companies with\r\n\r\nsurplus  manpower  can approach any of the participating  agency\r\n\r\nwhich  they are most comfortable in dealing with, so  that  they\r\n\r\ncould  be  better informed of the alternatives to  retrenchment,\r\n\r\nincluding the training grants available under the SRP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tripartite Panel has also recommended that an\r\n\r\nEmployment  Assistance  Programme  be  implemented   to   assist\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers seeking re-employment as soon  as  possible.\r\n\r\nThe Programme consists of an integrated job placement system  to\r\n\r\nenable various agencies (MOM, EDB, SNEF, NTUC, and companies) to\r\n\r\npool   job  vacancies  into  the  job  bank  of  the  Ministry's\r\n\r\nEmployment Service Department so that the Department would be in\r\n\r\na  better  position  to  assist retrenched  workers  secure  re-employment expeditiously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to help retrenched workers secure alternative\r\n\r\nemployment and at the same time enhance their employability, low-skilled  retrenched workers will be offered appropriate training\r\n\r\nunder  SRP  for higher value-added jobs.  This will enhance  the\r\n\r\nemployability  of such workers and make them less vulnerable  to\r\n\r\nfuture  retrenchments.  To better assist retrenched  workers  in\r\n\r\nsecuring re-employment, companies are therefore urged to  notify\r\n\r\nthe Employment Service Department of their job vacancies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Panel has also recommended that\r\n\r\ninformation  on alternatives to retrenchment and  how  employers\r\n\r\ncould carry out retrenchment responsibly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  made  available  to  companies.   For  workers  affected  by\r\n\r\nretrenchment,  they would need to be advised on how  they  could\r\n\r\nsecure  re-employment expeditiously and cope with the situation.\r\n\r\nFor  this  purpose, the Ministry has produced two pamphlets  for\r\n\r\ndistribution:  one  targeting at  companies  and  the  other  at\r\n\r\nretrenched workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the implementation of the Committee's recommendation\r\n\r\nwill   result   in  more  effective  employment  assistance   to\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers.   Further, low skilled  retrenched  workers\r\n\r\nwill  be  given the opportunity under the SRP to take up  higher\r\n\r\nskilled jobs and this will enhance their employability.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I seek an answer from\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  of  State  to  two questions  that  I  have  been\r\n\r\nattempting  to ask and my Party has asked.  Firstly,  would  the\r\n\r\nMinister tell us in what form the monitoring of retrenchment  of\r\n\r\nworkers  is done or how does it take place?  And secondly,  will\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  tell  us whether his Ministry  is  aware  of  the\r\n\r\npractice  of  some companies to retrench Singapore  workers  and\r\n\r\ntake on foreign workers at much lower wages?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, the first question is\r\n\r\non how retrenchments take place.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> How do you monitor the retrenchment\r\n\r\nsituation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> As I have mentioned earlier\r\n\r\nin my reply, we have set up this Committee.  This Committee will\r\n\r\ngive  advisory notice to the employers to approach  the  various\r\n\r\nagencies which they are comfortable with in dealing with details\r\n\r\nof retrenchments that are being proposed, particularly when they\r\n\r\nhave  excess workers.  And we would expect that these  companies\r\n\r\nwould  then approach any of the agencies which I have mentioned,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  MOM, EDB, SNEF, NTUC, and let  them  know  what\r\n\r\nexcess workers they have and what are their plans, whether there\r\n\r\nare  retrenchments, and we will provide them assistance.  At the\r\n\r\nsame  time, companies sometimes give notice either to the unions\r\n\r\nunder the Collective Agreement when\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey  propose  to undertake retrenchments or they  approach  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Manpower  to seek advice  when  they  have  excess\r\n\r\nworkers and how they want to proceed to deal with them.  This is\r\n\r\nhow we continue to monitor the situation on retrenchments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the second question, I think the retrenchments have\r\n\r\nbeen fairly even and usually retrenchment exercises are done  in\r\n\r\nproportion   to  the  existing  workforce.   That   means,   the\r\n\r\nretrenchment is reflective of the proportion of foreign  workers\r\n\r\nand  local  workers.  So I do not think there is any attempt  to\r\n\r\nreplace  one category with another.  But let me also  say  this,\r\n\r\nSir.   Employers  cannot be expected to  just  lay  off  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  first as most companies need Singaporeans  as  well  as\r\n\r\nforeign workers to remain competitive.  The key issue is  really\r\n\r\nwhether  our companies continue to be competitive.   Because  if\r\n\r\nthey  are competitive, particularly under the current situation,\r\n\r\nthey  will be able to do well.  And if they do well, they create\r\n\r\nmore employment.  In this case, when they do that, they will  be\r\n\r\nable  to attract more workers into their companies.  So I  think\r\n\r\nthere  is no special case of retrenchment of locals in order  to\r\n\r\nrecruit foreign workers.  I think they have retrenched according\r\n\r\nto the proportion of the nationalities in the workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Will the Minister of\r\n\r\nState  publicise the availability of the various training grants\r\n\r\nto the public so as to facilitate people to upgrade themselves?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Yes, we will definitely\r\n\r\npublicise  the availability of training grants.

My question is simply  this.\r\n\r\nIs  the Ministry aware that Singapore workers are being got  rid\r\n\r\nof  and, in their place, foreign workers are being taken in?  It\r\n\r\nis  not  a  question that they do not need them.

Secondly, there\r\n\r\nare  dependency  ceilings in the companies, in  so  far  as  the\r\n\r\nnumber of foreign workers that they can employ.

He says that the retrenchment  of  workers\r\n\r\nwill  be  in  proportion to the nationalities of the  workforce.\r\n\r\nBut not long ago in this House, I heard that the retrenchment of\r\n\r\nworkers  depends on the skills of the workers.  Supposing  there\r\n\r\nare  a  Singaporean worker and a foreign worker.  If the foreign\r\n\r\nworker  is more skilful, the Singapore worker will be retrenched\r\n\r\nfirst.  Is that not the position?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> First, let me clarify.\r\n\r\nWhat I said was that retrenchment has been done in proportion to\r\n\r\nthe  nationalities of the workers in the workforce.  But  coming\r\n\r\nto a more specific situation, when you have a retrenchment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  a  company, the company then decides, within the  dependency\r\n\r\nceiling  and the proportion of the foreign workforce which  they\r\n\r\nhave, who should go first.  And I think the key point is that we\r\n\r\nwant  the companies to continue to be competitive.  If they want\r\n\r\nto  be competitive, they require good and skilled workers and in\r\n\r\nsuch  a  situation, they will want to maintain workers who  have\r\n\r\ngood  skills and work attitudes and, therefore, they will decide\r\n\r\nwhich  of  the two workers should go.  On a specific  case,  the\r\n\r\ncompany  will decide who they want to retain and who should  go.\r\n\r\nIn that case, the position is that they would want to retain the\r\n\r\ngood workers regardless of their nationality.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I get a further clarification? You\r\n\r\nare  talking about a specific instance.

So it  has  to\r\n\r\nkeep  this  dependency ceiling and there is this safeguard.   It\r\n\r\ncannot  have all its workers who are all foreigners  because  it\r\n\r\nwill  then break the dependency ceiling.

In other words,\r\n\r\nif a company were to retrench one Singaporean worker and, by the\r\n\r\ndependency ratio, it may have to retrench three or four  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> It depends, because some\r\n\r\ncompanies  have  foreign workers who are  below  the  dependency\r\n\r\nceiling.   So although the dependency ceiling in some cases  are\r\n\r\n40% - for the services sector it is 25% - but they may have more\r\n\r\nSingapore workers than foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I would like to seek\r\n\r\ntwo  points  of  clarification.  On  this  issue  of  a  company\r\n\r\nretrenching Singaporean workers and replacing them with  cheaper\r\n\r\nforeign  workers, am I right to say that, firstly, if a  company\r\n\r\nwere  to retrench workers and, immediately following that,  were\r\n\r\nto  replace  them  with  workers,  whether  foreign  workers  or\r\n\r\nSingaporean workers, to do the same job, then this will  violate\r\n\r\nthe understanding of retrenchment and that the NTUC can actually\r\n\r\nbring  up  the  case  to the Ministry of Manpower  and  it  will\r\n\r\nactually investigate into these cases?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also like to seek clarification from the Minister that,\r\n\r\naccording  to a previous survey conducted by economic  agencies,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  EDB,  it  was  established  that,  having  taken  into\r\n\r\nconsideration the foreign worker levy and the cost of housing in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the foreign workers, on the average,  will  actually\r\n\r\ncost  20%  more than the Singaporean  workers.  One  reason  why\r\n\r\ncompanies  are  going for more foreign workers  is  not  because\r\n\r\nforeign  workers on the whole are cheaper but rather because  of\r\n\r\nthe  shortage  of Singaporean workers.  I would  appreciate  the\r\n\r\nMinister's confirmation on these two points.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> I can certainly confirm the\r\n\r\ntwo  points.   If  there are cases where  NTUC  feels  that  the\r\n\r\ncompanies are unfair, it can always report the situation to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Manpower.  And I have mentioned earlier, under  the\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Programme, companies will discuss with  us  what  they\r\n\r\nintend  to  do  when they have excess manpower.  So  once  these\r\n\r\nrecommendations are implemented, I think the situation that  the\r\n\r\nMember has described in the first part of his question will  not\r\n\r\narise.   On the second point about the cost of workers, I  agree\r\n\r\nthat, with the various charges and cost of housing, it may  well\r\n\r\nbe more expensive for companies to recruit foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister of State a final\r\n\r\nquestion and that is this: Are we to understand that so long  as\r\n\r\nthe  company  has room for more foreign workers, that  is,  when\r\n\r\nthey  have  not  filled their quota, then the Ministry  turns  a\r\n\r\nblind  eye  to  them dismissing Singapore workers and  replacing\r\n\r\nthem with foreign workers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> If they are within the\r\n\r\ndependency ratio, they can always recruit foreign workers.   But\r\n\r\nunder the Advisory Programme for employers that we are going  to\r\n\r\nimplement,  we  will discuss with them the excess  manpower,  if\r\n\r\nthey have, at the point of retrenchment and to advise them to go\r\n\r\nfor  other  measures other than retrenchment.  So the answer  to\r\n\r\nthe question is that we want to make sure that our companies are\r\n\r\ncompetitive  and, if they are to be competitive, there  must  be\r\n\r\ncertain flexibility given to the companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I would like the Minister of State\r\n\r\nto clarify the clarification that has been given to Mr Lim.  Can\r\n\r\nI  have a clarification that the situation, spoken by Mr Lim, is\r\n\r\nin  fact in the case where there are insufficient workers?  What\r\n\r\nwe  are  talking now is that there are more than enough workers.\r\n\r\nSo  the  situation  of employing foreign workers  who  are  more\r\n\r\nexpensive does not apply.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> I think some companies\r\n\r\nstill need foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Even when it is not competitive?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> It is a question of the\r\n\r\nskills of the workers.  If the workers are skilful, then  it  is\r\n\r\nrelative,  and it is the quality of the workers that they  want.\r\n\r\nAnd  if they do not have this type of workers in Singapore, they\r\n\r\nmay need foreign workers although they may be more expensive.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> We are talking about a case of\r\n\r\nretrenchment.   In  other  words, there  are  more  than  enough\r\n\r\nworkers.   There are not enough jobs to go round.  This  is  the\r\n\r\nsituation we are talking about. Therefore, the situation that Mr\r\n\r\nLim  stated does not apply, because he said that there  are  not\r\n\r\nenough  workers  and  you have to pay 20% more  to  house  these\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.   But our situation now is  different.   Am  I\r\n\r\nright?  So his situation does not apply.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> In fact, under the SRP, we\r\n\r\nare  trying  to get Singapore workers to be trained.   So  those\r\n\r\nworkers  who  are retrenched, they go under the  SRP  programme.\r\n\r\nSome  of  the workers will then be employed by these  companies.\r\n\r\nThere  are  examples where certain companies, like International\r\n\r\nVideo  Products, have retrenched workers and some of  them  went\r\n\r\nunder  the SRP, and they were able to work in wafer fab  plants,\r\n\r\nand  so  on.  But there may be situations, I think we are really\r\n\r\ntalking about hypothetical cases, where they could not get these\r\n\r\nworkers  and  they may still need skilled workers and  therefore\r\n\r\nthey  will continue to recruit.  But with these skilled workers,\r\n\r\nthe  plant is able to operate and it becomes competitive.

I would  like  to  seek\r\n\r\nfurther clarification from the Minister of State.  On this issue\r\n\r\nof  retrenching workers, is it right to say that some  companies\r\n\r\nare  not  able  to focus on retrenching foreign workers  for  at\r\n\r\nleast  two reasons?  Firstly, it is the skills.  As the Minister\r\n\r\nof  State  mentioned,  because there  are  foreign  workers  who\r\n\r\npossess the skill which the local workers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndo  not  have.  Secondly, is it right to say that many companies\r\n\r\nfind that Singaporean workers are not prepared to work in a  12-hour  shift and, as a result, the third shift, ie, the  midnight\r\n\r\nshift,  has to depend a lot on foreign workers?  Even at a  time\r\n\r\nlike  this,  they  have  no choice but to continue  to  retrench\r\n\r\nworkers through a combination of Singaporean workers and foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Yes, I can certainly\r\n\r\nconfirm that.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, can I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  of State whether the dependency ratio can be  adjusted\r\n\r\ndownwards so that we can take in more Singaporeans now that more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are willing to perform that kind of job at a  lower\r\n\r\nwage level?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> For the time being, I do\r\n\r\nnot think we need to do that.

The  review included re-examining the  role  of  the\r\n\r\nMonetary  Authority of Singapore (MAS) and that of its Board  of\r\n\r\nDirectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Financial Sector Promotion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, MAS has focused on promoting monetary stability\r\n\r\nfor sustainable economic growth, regulating the financial sector\r\n\r\nto   ensure  its  soundness,  and  acting  as  the  Government's\r\n\r\nfinancial  agent.  It has also played a developmental role  with\r\n\r\nregard   to  the  financial  sector.   Under  MAS'  stewardship,\r\n\r\nSingapore's financial sector has seen dramatic growth  over  the\r\n\r\nlast 25 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we cannot simply extrapolate this success into the\r\n\r\nfuture.   The global financial industry is in ferment.   Falling\r\n\r\nregulatory  barriers, advances in information technology  and  a\r\n\r\ntidal   wave  of  mergers  are  integrating  financial  markets.\r\n\r\nFinancial  activities are consolidating in  fewer  centres,  and\r\n\r\ncompetition is intense.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To thrive and grow in this bracing environment, we need a\r\n\r\nchange  in  approach.  MAS needs to build  up  a  much  stronger\r\n\r\npromotion  capability.  To this end, MAS has formed  a  separate\r\n\r\nFinancial  Sector Promotion Department to focus its  efforts  in\r\n\r\ndeveloping  the  financial  industry.   Besides  attracting  new\r\n\r\nactivities, players and products, this department will carry out\r\n\r\nmanpower  and IT planning for the financial sector  as  well  as\r\n\r\ndesign and implement incentive schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to include financial sector promotion as\r\n\r\none  of  MAS'  principal  objects.  This  is  to  recognise  the\r\n\r\nimportance of this function, and signal to  the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nindustry  MAS'  commitment  to  a proactive  role  in  promoting\r\n\r\nSingapore's financial services sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Size of the MAS Board</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS Act currently limits the size of the MAS Board to\r\n\r\nseven  directors. At the moment, there are six directors serving\r\n\r\non  the Board, and one more will be appointed on 1st July, in  a\r\n\r\nfew  days' time.  It would be useful to have the flexibility  to\r\n\r\nappoint  a slightly larger Board, in order to benefit  from  the\r\n\r\nexperience  of  a  wider  group  of  individuals.   This   would\r\n\r\nstrengthen  MAS  as an organisation and support its  efforts  to\r\n\r\npromote Singapore as a world-class financial centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to raise the maximum number of directors\r\n\r\nfrom  seven to 10.  In line with this enlargement, the Bill also\r\n\r\nrecommends redefining the quorum for Board meetings so that  the\r\n\r\nquorum would at least constitute a simple majority of the number\r\n\r\nof directors serving on the Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Criteria for MAS Board Members</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its founding in 1971, MAS has assumed oversight of\r\n\r\nvarious  segments of the financial services industry,  including\r\n\r\ninsurance  in  1977 and securities in 1984.   In  addition,  new\r\n\r\nactivities   such  as  financial  futures  trading   have   been\r\n\r\nintroduced, which now come under MAS' purview.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS Act currently disqualifies directors and salaried\r\n\r\nofficials  of banks from serving on the MAS Board.  However,  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  disqualify  those involved in  the  other  activities\r\n\r\nsupervised by MAS from serving on the Board.  The Bill  proposes\r\n\r\nto  rectify  this  omission and extend the  disqualification  to\r\n\r\ndirectors  and salaried officials of all financial  institutions\r\n\r\nlicensed or approved by MAS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, for giving me this opportunity.  Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal aim of the MAS has been and will always be to\r\n\r\nact  as  a  central bank of Singapore, as well as the  financial\r\n\r\nagent of the Government.  And it is to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncredit  of  this body that we have sound fiscal policies,  sound\r\n\r\nmonetary  management and Members would welcome,  as  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  has pointed out, to include  one  more  mission\r\n\r\nstatement, which is to foster a sound and progressive  financial\r\n\r\nservices sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two areas which I would like to raise. When\r\n\r\nthe first Bill was read a Second time in this House in September\r\n\r\n1970,  the then Finance Minister said that the issue of currency\r\n\r\nnotes would be left to the Currency Board.  I wonder whether the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  going  to change this and  bring  the  issue  of\r\n\r\ncurrency notes within the purview of the MAS in the near future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern that I have is this. I support the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  move to increase  the membership of the  Board  of\r\n\r\nDirectors, but I am a little worried on one count.  There is now\r\n\r\na  new requirement of a minimum of four members.   I think  four\r\n\r\nis  too  few.   I  think we should be a bit more  flexible.   We\r\n\r\nshould  have a minimum of six to a maximum of nine, and I  would\r\n\r\nurge  the  Deputy  Prime Minister to consider  appointing  Board\r\n\r\nmembers  from the private sector.  It is very important to  have\r\n\r\nprivate sector inputs in our financial management.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I applaud the Government's move to appoint Mr J. Y.\r\n\r\nPillay  from  1st July.  I think he would, with his  experience,\r\n\r\ncontribute immensely to the MAS.  And as I have said earlier,  I\r\n\r\nhope   the  Government  will  consider  appointing  people  from\r\n\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I am concerned with is this. There\r\n\r\nis no definition of \"financial institution\" in the Bill.  I know\r\n\r\nit  will  take into consideration financial managers.  Would  it\r\n\r\ninclude insurance brokers, moneylenders, pawnbrokers, because it\r\n\r\nis  a very wide definition?  I think it would be wise if the DPM\r\n\r\ncould state to the House what are the institutions that will  be\r\n\r\ncovered.   In any case, I applaud the DPM because it shows  that\r\n\r\nwe  are  very  transparent and we do not  want  people  who  are\r\n\r\ninvolved in this sector to sit in judgment as a Board member.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our financial sector has grown considerably. Our\r\n\r\nforeign  exchange  dealings per day are in the  tune  of  US$190\r\n\r\nbillion.   The fund management is also on the increase  and  the\r\n\r\nBill  before the House is timely, especially in view of the fact\r\n\r\nthat the recommendations have been made by a Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, and with the questions that I have raised\r\n\r\nearlier, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, if I may respond to the\r\n\r\npoints.   First,  on  the  issue of  currency  notes.   No,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has no plans to transfer this responsibility from the\r\n\r\nBoard  of  Commissioners of Currency to MAS.   The  MAS  remains\r\n\r\ntechnically not quite a central bank, because it does not  issue\r\n\r\ncurrency and we have a currency board system which has served us\r\n\r\nwell.  I think there is no reason to change it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Board Members, the Member has suggested that we should\r\n\r\nlook  for  some more members from the private sector.   I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  him.   It  was  precisely with this  in  mind  that  I  am\r\n\r\nproposing to increase the size of the Board.  The difficulty, of\r\n\r\ncourse, is finding the right persons to serve on the Board,  but\r\n\r\nwe are actively looking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on definition of \"financial institutions\", I\r\n\r\nbelieve there is no definition in the Bill, but basically  these\r\n\r\nare  the institutions which are regulated and supervised by MAS.\r\n\r\nSo  if  we  supervise the insurance industry or the stockbroking\r\n\r\nindustry,  executives in those companies which  come  under  our\r\n\r\njurisdiction will be excluded from sitting.  I think it  is  not\r\n\r\nquite  straightforward to pin down exactly where the  boundaries\r\n\r\nof  financial services are.  The field is growing very  rapidly.\r\n\r\nThings  like futures exchanges, for example, did not exist  when\r\n\r\nwe last amended the Act, and we have had to include them.  So  I\r\n\r\nthink we just leave it as financial institutions and it will  be\r\n\r\nclear which are the ones which come under MAS' purview.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill.

Disturbances in one market are  transmitted\r\n\r\nrapidly  to other markets, as the spread of the Asian  financial\r\n\r\ncrisis  in the last year illustrated.  Large banks and financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions are managing their exposures and risks on a  global\r\n\r\nbasis, wherever they operate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trend towards increased globalisation in financial\r\n\r\nactivity  underscores  the  need for  closer  cooperation  among\r\n\r\nsupervisory   authorities  in  protecting  the   integrity   and\r\n\r\nsoundness  of  their  financial  markets,  as  well  as  of  the\r\n\r\ninternational financial system.  This is all the more  important\r\n\r\nfor Singapore, which as an international financial centre, has a\r\n\r\nlarge  number of foreign banks.  The MAS must therefore be  able\r\n\r\nto   engage   in  coordinated,  global  supervision   with   its\r\n\r\ncounterparts  in other countries, to strengthen the  supervision\r\n\r\nof  large international banks and safeguard the stability of the\r\n\r\nfinancial system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Inspection by Foreign Supervisory Authorities</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banking Act was amended in 1996 to include a new\r\n\r\nsection  45A to allow foreign supervisory authorities to inspect\r\n\r\ntheir  banks' operations in Singapore, which was until then  not\r\n\r\npermitted.   This was to enable home supervisory authorities  to\r\n\r\nexercise  effective consolidated supervision over  their  banks'\r\n\r\nglobal operations. To safeguard the confidentiality of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncustomer information, a foreign supervisory authority is allowed\r\n\r\nto  inspect  its banks' operations if it provides  MAS  with  an\r\n\r\nundertaking not to divulge the information to other parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several supervisory authorities have been unable to\r\n\r\nundertake  to  MAS  that they will not divulge  the  information\r\n\r\nobtained to a third party under any circumstances, as they could\r\n\r\nbe  compelled under their domestic laws to disclose  information\r\n\r\nheld  by  them to their courts or legislature. Hence, under  the\r\n\r\ncurrent Act, they cannot inspect their banks here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major international financial centres, such as the US,\r\n\r\nthe   UK,   Hong  Kong  and  Australia  allow  home  supervisory\r\n\r\nauthorities  to  inspect  foreign  banks  operating   in   their\r\n\r\njurisdictions.  These countries impose conditions which are less\r\n\r\nstringent than Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banking (Amendment) Bill proposes to amend section 45A\r\n\r\nto  enable  foreign supervisory authorities, or bodies appointed\r\n\r\nby  them,  to inspect the Singapore branches of their  banks  if\r\n\r\nthey   provide   a   written   undertaking   to   maintain   the\r\n\r\nconfidentiality  of the information obtained, as  determined  by\r\n\r\nMAS.    This  will  allow  inspections  by  foreign  supervisory\r\n\r\nauthorities which are conducted solely for supervisory purposes.\r\n\r\nThe  written  undertaking is to ensure that foreign  supervisory\r\n\r\nauthorities do not disclose information obtained from inspecting\r\n\r\ntheir banks here, unless compelled by their laws. The Bill  will\r\n\r\nalso amend the conditions under which foreign banks in Singapore\r\n\r\nmay disclose to their parent supervisory authorities information\r\n\r\non  credit facilities granted. Currently they may do so only  if\r\n\r\nthe  supervisory authority does not divulge the  information  to\r\n\r\nany third party.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign supervisory authorities will, however, still be\r\n\r\nprohibited  from accessing information on deposits  and  private\r\n\r\nbanking accounts during the on-site examinations.  Also, foreign\r\n\r\nbanks  will  still be disallowed from disclosing information  on\r\n\r\ndeposits   and   private  banking  accounts  to   their   parent\r\n\r\nsupervisory authorities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Disclosure of information on borrowers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, the Banking Act allows MAS to provide\r\n\r\ninformation  on the operations of a foreign bank to  the  parent\r\n\r\nsupervisory  authority, but not the particulars of a  customer's\r\n\r\naccount.  This Bill proposes to allow MAS to provide information\r\n\r\non  particulars  of credit facilities granted by  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nbranch,   to   parent   supervisory  authorities,   solely   for\r\n\r\nsupervisory  purposes.  Such information on credit  exposure  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  foreign supervisory authorities  to  assess  the\r\n\r\nasset  quality  of their banks on a global basis.   However,  no\r\n\r\ninformation on deposit and private banking accounts  of  foreign\r\n\r\nbanks  in  Singapore  will  be provided  to  parent  supervisory\r\n\r\nauthorities, even with the amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Real-Time Gross Settlement System</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second main amendment proposed in the Bill is to\r\n\r\nprovide  for the introduction of the Real-Time Gross  Settlement\r\n\r\n(RTGS)   system.   Every  day,  large  amounts  of   money   are\r\n\r\ntransferred through interbank payment systems around the  world.\r\n\r\nIt  is  estimated  that in the G-10 countries  alone  the  daily\r\n\r\nturnover of the main payment systems is more than US$5 trillion.\r\n\r\nMany   of   these  payments  are  to  settle  financial   market\r\n\r\ntransactions  between the banks themselves,  such  as  interbank\r\n\r\nloans or foreign exchange deals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, there has been increased recognition that\r\n\r\nthe   way  many  of  the  payment  systems  worked  exposed  the\r\n\r\nparticipating banks to large risks, with potential repercussions\r\n\r\nfor the financial system as a whole. If one bank were to fail to\r\n\r\nmeet  its  obligations for whatever reason, other banks  in  the\r\n\r\nsystem  could  face  liquidity  problems  or  even  fail  as   a\r\n\r\nconsequence  of  these interbank exposures.   Because  of  these\r\n\r\nconcerns,  countries  have  been taking  action  to  make  their\r\n\r\npayment   systems  more  robust.  The  Bank  for   International\r\n\r\nSettlements (BIS), an international institution which  seeks  to\r\n\r\npromote   central  bank  cooperation  and  foster  international\r\n\r\nfinancial  stability, has strongly encouraged all  countries  to\r\n\r\nintroduce RTGS systems.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to allow MAS to establish and operate an\r\n\r\nRTGS  system  in Singapore.  The RTGS system will be implemented\r\n\r\non  13th  July.  It will replace the existing interbank  payment\r\n\r\nsystem called SHIFT which was established in 1985.  SHIFT is  an\r\n\r\nelectronic payment system that settles interbank payments  on  a\r\n\r\nnet  basis  at the end of the day.  This means that all  payment\r\n\r\ninstructions are accumulated throughout the day and at  the  end\r\n\r\nof  day,  the  net  obligation for each  bank  is  computed  and\r\n\r\nsettled.  This gives rise to a risk to the whole banking system.\r\n\r\nShould   one  bank  not  have  sufficient  funds  to  meet   its\r\n\r\nobligations  at the end of the day, all the payments  that  have\r\n\r\nbeen  accumulated  during the day may have to  be  unwound,  and\r\n\r\nother banks may be affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the RTGS system, payment instructions between banks\r\n\r\nare  processed  and settled individually and continually  during\r\n\r\nthe  day, subject to the paying bank having sufficient funds  in\r\n\r\nits current account maintained with MAS.  Once settled, the Bill\r\n\r\nprovides  that  the  payment  is  final  and  irrevocable.   The\r\n\r\nreceiving  bank is thus assured of good value for the funds  and\r\n\r\ncan  use  the funds immediately without being exposed  to  risk.\r\n\r\nThe  RTGS  system  therefore reduces the chances  of  settlement\r\n\r\nfailure in one bank affecting other banks, thereby also reducing\r\n\r\nsystemic risk. The Bill also contains provisions to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe  stability  of  the  system is not unduly  affected  by  the\r\n\r\ninsolvency of any single bank.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RTGS system will thus enhance the stability of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  financial system. RTGS systems  have  been  or  are\r\n\r\nbeing implemented in many developed financial markets, including\r\n\r\nthe  US,  the  UK, Switzerland, Germany, Japan,  Hong  Kong  and\r\n\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common for central banks to own and operate interbank\r\n\r\npayment  systems  as they have responsibility for  ensuring  the\r\n\r\nefficient  operation of payment systems, which is  critical  for\r\n\r\nthe  smooth  functioning of the financial system.  Some  central\r\n\r\nbanks  that operate their respective countries' payment  systems\r\n\r\nare the US Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, German\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBundesbank, Banque de France and Bank of Italy.  Others such  as\r\n\r\nHong  Kong and the United Kingdom have set up separate companies\r\n\r\nto operate their RTGS systems, but under central bank control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, MAS will be protected from liability\r\n\r\narising from operating the RTGS system, except where it involves\r\n\r\na  reckless  act or omission, or intentional misconduct  on  the\r\n\r\npart  of MAS.  This is similar to the RTGS systems in Hong  Kong\r\n\r\nand  the  United  Kingdom.  The RTGS system will  apply  to  the\r\n\r\ntransfer  and  settlement  of book-entry  securities  and  other\r\n\r\ninstruments in addition to payment obligations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Priority of Repayment of Balance of Stored Value Cards</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another proposed amendment concerns the issue of stored\r\n\r\nvalue  cards,  such as the CashCard, by banks.  Presently  under\r\n\r\nthe  Banking Act, in the event a bank winds up, non-bank deposit\r\n\r\nliabilities  which  are subject to maintenance  of  reserve  and\r\n\r\nliquidity  requirements  are  accorded  first  priority  in  the\r\n\r\nrepayment of the bank's unsecured liabilities.  As the  proceeds\r\n\r\nreceived by a bank from the issue of stored value cards are akin\r\n\r\nto deposits, the Bill proposes to accord similar priority to the\r\n\r\nbalance of such proceeds as well. Stored value card holders will\r\n\r\ntherefore   receive  first  priority,  together  with   non-bank\r\n\r\ndepositors, for repayment in the event of a winding up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the very\r\n\r\nadequate  explanation, I do not think I want to speak.

It  also  amends the Customs  Act  to  include  Tuas\r\n\r\nCheckpoint as an additional customs station.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rationale</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Customs Act provides for Singapore customs\r\n\r\nclearance  of dutiable goods by rail to be carried  out  at  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Railway  Station at Keppel Road.  The  Bill  replaces\r\n\r\nthis with a general provision for Singapore customs clearance by\r\n\r\nrail to be carried out at a station to be designated.  This will\r\n\r\nprovide flexibility in the designation of a customs station  and\r\n\r\nobviate  the need to change the Customs Act for such a  purpose.\r\n\r\nFurther,  as  the Customs Act already allows the flexibility  to\r\n\r\ndesignate  the customs station for import and export by  air  or\r\n\r\nsea,  this change will also rationalize the expressions for  the\r\n\r\nplace of import and export by the various modes of transport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st August 1998, the Singapore Customs, Immigration\r\n\r\nand Quarantine (CIQ) clearance facilities will be relocated from\r\n\r\nthe Keppel Road Train Station to the Woodlands Train Checkpoint.\r\n\r\nFollowing  the amendment to the Customs Act, we will proceed  to\r\n\r\ndesignate and gazette the Woodlands Train Checkpoint as the  new\r\n\r\ncustoms station for Singapore customs clearance in lieu  of  the\r\n\r\nKeppel Road Train Station.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Customs (Amendment) Bill also provides for an\r\n\r\nadditional customs station at Tuas for the import and export  by\r\n\r\nroad,  which can be done only via the road checkpoints,  namely,\r\n\r\nthe Woodlands Checkpoint and Tuas Checkpoint.\r\n\r\nProposed Amendments\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill makes the following amendments to the Customs Act:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to amend sections 3, 31, 34, 37, 39, 41, 45 and 52 to\r\n\r\nprovide that dutiable goods must be imported or exported by rail\r\n\r\nat  a  customs  station along the railway to be designated,  and\r\n\r\nthat  goods on arrival at that customs station cannot be removed\r\n\r\nexcept  in  accordance  with a permit issued  by  the  Director-General.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to amend sections 34 and 37 to provide for an\r\n\r\nadditional  customs  station  at  Tuas  for  goods  imported  or\r\n\r\nexported by road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MOTOR VEHICLES (THIRD PARTY RISKS AND</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>COMPENSATION) (AMENDMENT) BILL</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Aim</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the aim of this Bill is to amend the Motor Vehicles\r\n\r\n(Third-Party  Risks  and  Compensation)  Act  to   ensure   that\r\n\r\nSingapore  registered and insured vehicles travelling into  West\r\n\r\nMalaysia  are  covered for third party liability  insurance  and\r\n\r\nthat  the  benefits  of third party victims  of  road  accidents\r\n\r\ncaused  by  the use of Singapore vehicles in West  Malaysia  are\r\n\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Background</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and\r\n\r\nCompensation) Act, victims of accidents have a right to look  to\r\n\r\nthe  insured's  insurers  if  the insured  fails  to  satisfy  a\r\n\r\njudgement  entered against him.

Where a motor  accident  occurs  in  West\r\n\r\nMalaysia, the benefits provided for in the Act do not extend  to\r\n\r\nvictims  of such accidents.  The benefits in the Act only  apply\r\n\r\nto motor accidents occurring in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Implications of the Court's Ruling</i>\r\n\r\n<br><i>Recovery against insurers</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Court has ruled that the passenger has no\r\n\r\nright to sue the insurer under the Act, the Court's ruling  does\r\n\r\nnot  affect  the victim's right to recover indirectly  from  the\r\n\r\ninsurer  if  the policy is valid as a contract at  the  date  of\r\n\r\njudgement.  This indirect recovery route means that the  insured\r\n\r\ndriver  will  have to sue the insurer on the contract  of  motor\r\n\r\ninsurance  and  any  monies recovered by the  insured  from  the\r\n\r\ninsurer will then become available for payment by the insured to\r\n\r\nthe victim.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Nippon's case, the policy that was issued covered the\r\n\r\nuse  of  the  Singapore-registered and insured vehicle  in  West\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  However, as the insured driver is now a bankrupt, the\r\n\r\npassenger  must  rely  on  the  Official  Assignee  to  make   a\r\n\r\ncontractual claim against the insurer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Court of Appeal's ruling not only\r\n\r\napplies  to  passengers  but also to every  victim  of  a  motor\r\n\r\naccident  on  a  Malaysian road involving a car  registered  and\r\n\r\ninsured  in Singapore.  Such victims would, as a consequence  of\r\n\r\nthe  Court's ruling, have no right to sue the Singapore insurers\r\n\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Court's ruling is not in the public\r\n\r\ninterest  as  it means that victims of motor accidents  have  to\r\n\r\nresort to indirect means in order to claim against the insurers.\r\n\r\nThis  will  cause  victims and the estates of  deceased  victims\r\n\r\nunnecessary  expense  and  delay.  In Nippon's  case,  it  would\r\n\r\nreduce  the  amount of damages payable to the injured  passenger\r\n\r\nbecause  the insurance monies will have to be shared with  other\r\n\r\ncreditors of the bankrupt insured.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Extraterritorial scope of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap. 189)</i>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, historically, when the Act was first\r\n\r\nenacted  in  1938,  it was intended to cover the  use  of  motor\r\n\r\nvehicles  in  Singapore and Malaysia when  both  countries  were\r\n\r\ntreated as a single territory under the British administration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, the scope of our Act has not changed even after\r\n\r\nthe constitutional changes which occurred during the period 1959\r\n\r\nto  1965.  In fact, the Act still retains section 19(1)(f) which\r\n\r\nindicates  that  the  legislative  intent  was  to  provide  for\r\n\r\ncompulsory  third  party liability insurance whenever  Singapore\r\n\r\nregistered motor vehicles are used in Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice of Singapore insurers has always been to issue\r\n\r\ninsurance  policies which cover the use of Singapore  registered\r\n\r\nvehicles  in  West  Malaysia.  The effect of such  an  insurance\r\n\r\npolicy  is to contractually extend the insurance coverage beyond\r\n\r\nSingapore  in order to provide protection to third  parties  who\r\n\r\nmight  be  injured or killed by the use of the insured  vehicle.\r\n\r\nIn  this  way,  the practice is consistent with the  legislative\r\n\r\nintent  to  provide the benefits of the Act to victims  of  road\r\n\r\naccidents occurring in West Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is clear that the spirit and intent of the Act was\r\n\r\nto  cover  the use of Singapore registered vehicles within  West\r\n\r\nMalaysia.   Any  other interpretation would lead to  undesirable\r\n\r\nconsequences  and  subject innocent victims  of  road  accidents\r\n\r\noccurring in West Malaysia to unnecessary expense and  delay  in\r\n\r\nobtaining compensation for the injuries caused to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore necessary for the law to be amended to\r\n\r\nrestore  to victims of road traffic accidents caused by the  use\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  vehicles in West Malaysia, the right  to  make  a\r\n\r\ndirect  claim against the insurers.  Nothing is served by making\r\n\r\nan  injured  party or a deceased's estate go through unnecessary\r\n\r\nlegal  rigmarole  just  to get the insurers  to  pay  what  they\r\n\r\ncontractually have to pay under their insurance policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have therefore decided that these\r\n\r\nissues should be put right by amending the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) (Amendment) Act.  As Malaysia  has\r\n\r\nsimilar  legislation,  we have sought the  co-operation  of  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  authorities  in  Malaysia  to  similarly  amend  their\r\n\r\nlegislation.   I  have  written to  the  Malaysian  Minister  of\r\n\r\nTransport, Tan Sri Dr Ling Liong Sik, and he has agreed that our\r\n\r\nlegislation  should be harmonised to safeguard the interests  of\r\n\r\nmotorists  and  do  not impede the movement of vehicles  between\r\n\r\nMalaysia and Singapore.  Our officials will be meeting  soon  to\r\n\r\nwork out the details.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Provisions of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) (Amendment) Act 1998</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now highlight the key provisions of the Motor\r\n\r\nVehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill introduces new provisions and amends existing\r\n\r\nprovisions  to  the  Motor  Vehicles  (Third-Party   Risks   and\r\n\r\nCompensation) Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 3(1) to extend the\r\n\r\nextraterritorial  effect to motor insurance policies  issued  by\r\n\r\nSingapore insurers to any territory specified in the Schedule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 also prohibits persons from using a motor vehicle\r\n\r\nwhich  is  registered in Singapore unless the person is  covered\r\n\r\nfor  third-party risks which may be incurred by him  when  using\r\n\r\nthe motor vehicle in any territory specified in the Schedule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill introduces 2 new subsections, and\r\n\r\nthese are (1A) and (1B).\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (1A) deems any policy of insurance: issued on or\r\n\r\nbefore  the  commencement of the Bill  by  an  insurer  who  was\r\n\r\nlawfully carrying on motor insurance business in Singapore;  and\r\n\r\nwhich  insures any person specified in the policy against third-party  risks  which may be incurred by him when  using  a  motor\r\n\r\nvehicle in any territory specified in the Schedule, to have been\r\n\r\na  policy  of insurance issued for the purposes of the  Act  and\r\n\r\nunder which, third parties are conferred benefits by the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (1A) reverses the Court of Appeal's ruling in\r\n\r\nNippon  Fire  &  Marine Insurance Co Ltd v.  Sim  Jin  Hwee  and\r\n\r\nretrospectively confers the right of all affected persons to sue\r\n\r\nSingapore insurers under the Act if a motor accident involving a\r\n\r\nSingapore  registered  and  insured  vehicle  occurs   in   West\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the new subsection (1B) provides that this\r\n\r\nbenefit,  or  the retrospective effect, does not extend  to  any\r\n\r\nperson  whose claim has, prior to the passing of the Bill,  been\r\n\r\nheld  by a Singapore Court not to give rise to an action against\r\n\r\na  Singapore  insurer.  What this does is that it preserves  the\r\n\r\ndecision of the Court of Appeal in Nippon's case and other cases\r\n\r\nthat the Courts have decided since that decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 of the Bill inserts a new Schedule which specifies\r\n\r\nthe territory outside Singapore to which the new subsection (1A)\r\n\r\nand  the  amended  section 3(1) apply.   West  Malaysia  is  the\r\n\r\nterritory  specified  in the Schedule and this  means  that  any\r\n\r\nperson  using  a Singapore registered vehicle in  West  Malaysia\r\n\r\nmust be covered by an insurance policy in respect of third party\r\n\r\nrisks as complies with the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill restores the law governing motor insurance\r\n\r\ncoverage and the rights of road accident victims to the  way  it\r\n\r\nwas prior to the ruling of the Court of Appeal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NATIONAL COMPUTER BOARD (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will amend the National Computer Board Act, which\r\n\r\nI  will  refer  to as the NCB Act in short.

NCB is now also tasked to  develop  the  IT\r\n\r\nindustry  and  to harness IT to improve the performance  of  our\r\n\r\neconomic sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapid evolution in the IT environment has placed new\r\n\r\ndemands  on  NCB.  This is particularly evident in  the  rapidly\r\n\r\ngrowing  area  of electronic commerce, where the marketplace  is\r\n\r\nbeing  transformed and new enabling infrastructures and services\r\n\r\nare needed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One new role of NCB is that of the Controller of\r\n\r\nCertification  Authorities,  as  set  forth  in   the   proposed\r\n\r\nElectronic  Transactions Bill, which is also  before  the  House\r\n\r\ntoday.  Clause 3 of the Bill amends\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsection 11 of the Act to reflect NCB's enlarged role, and  other\r\n\r\nnew functions which it may assume in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>NCB's Board Composition</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To allow for greater flexibility in Board appointments,\r\n\r\nclause  2 of the Bill amends section 5 of the Act to remove  the\r\n\r\nrequirement  that certain members of the Board be  appointed  to\r\n\r\nrepresent specific Ministries or agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  proposed Amendment Bill on NCB's charter, at first  glance,\r\n\r\nlooks  innocently simple and, that is, NCB is  now  to  promote,\r\n\r\nwith  the  amendment, Information Technology instead of computer\r\n\r\nscience.    As  the  Minister  has  rightly  pointed  out,   the\r\n\r\ndefinition of Information Technology now is very wide.  As such,\r\n\r\nthe  amendment  would open up tremendously the  scope  of  NCB's\r\n\r\nmission.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term \"Information Technology\" nowadays encompasses a\r\n\r\nwhole  lot  of  technologies.   It  can  be  telecommunications,\r\n\r\ncomputer software, mass media, Internet-related innovations,  e-commerce, etc.  Such convergence of technologies makes the  term\r\n\r\n\"Information Technology\" very much generic in nature.  Hence,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  question whether NCB is  embarking  on  such  a\r\n\r\nchallenging  task  of covering the wide range  of  technologies,\r\n\r\nespecially in this amendment, it is stated that it is  doing  it\r\n\r\nwithout budget implication.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that, currently, the National Science and\r\n\r\nTechnology Board (NSTB) and Economic Development Board (EDB) are\r\n\r\nall  involved in the promotion of IT industry.  To many  people,\r\n\r\nit  appears  that there is much overlapping between these  three\r\n\r\nagencies.  Any interested investor or entrepreneur in IT may  be\r\n\r\nconfused  about  whom  to approach.  With  this  amendment,  the\r\n\r\npresumption  would be NCB would be playing the key  role  in  IT\r\n\r\npromotion and development, while NSTB would be focusing on other\r\n\r\nnon-IT R&D, and EDB\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould  be  concentrating on the manufacturing aspect of  the  IT\r\n\r\nindustry.  I hope the Minister can clarify this point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think Singapore, on many counts, should\r\n\r\nhave a vibrant IT industry.  Some countries, including the small\r\n\r\nones,  like Taiwan and Israel, are experiencing strong  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  partly  because they have built  up  their  IT  industry\r\n\r\nearlier  than  we  did.  The need to diversify  our  traditional\r\n\r\nbusiness  is  a  must,  as highlighted by  BG  Yeo,  the  Second\r\n\r\nMinister for Trade and Industry, not too long ago.  And there is\r\n\r\nno  dispute  that  NCB has done a superb job  in  promoting  and\r\n\r\ndeveloping  world-class applications.  But this is  not  enough.\r\n\r\nWith  NCB  amending its charter, it can help to set priority  by\r\n\r\nhaving  a  coordinating one-stop body to focus on  the  task  of\r\n\r\ndeveloping IT industry through working closely with the  venture\r\n\r\ncommunity,   research  laboratories,  industries   and   various\r\n\r\nMinistries  and to identify what is lacking and take  aggressive\r\n\r\nsteps  to help develop the IT industry.  Although we are a  good\r\n\r\ndeal  away from having the critical mass, we can emulate  Israel\r\n\r\nwhich has achieved amazing results in just a few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, NCB, with its new charter, should take up the\r\n\r\nchallenge to create an environment for our IT industry  to  grow\r\n\r\nand prosper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr Chuang Shaw\r\n\r\nPeng  for  supporting the Bill and for making some very relevant\r\n\r\npoints.   It  is  true that IT is very wide; it is  generic  and\r\n\r\ncovers  a lot of areas, and it is also growing very fast.   That\r\n\r\nis  why  the  Government  has  in fact  adopted  a  multi-agency\r\n\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Bill is really to give NCB the powers to\r\n\r\nbe more involved in the promotion of IT, especially in the areas\r\n\r\nof setting up the IT infrastructure, developing software, and so\r\n\r\non.   But the task will not just be for NCB alone, but also EDB,\r\n\r\nNSTB and others.  For example, EDB is involved in promoting  the\r\n\r\ncomputer manufacturing sector, disk drives, and so on.   So  all\r\n\r\nthe hardware, that basically is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunder  EDB.  And increasingly, EDB is also approaching companies\r\n\r\nto  do software and they have got all the offices overseas.   So\r\n\r\nby  having  both  NCB and EDB under my Ministry, it  facilitates\r\n\r\ncoordination.  At a higher level, there is a Committee known  as\r\n\r\nthe  National IT Committee, chaired by Minister Teo  Chee  Hean,\r\n\r\nand  this  coordinates policies at the broad level.   Also,  the\r\n\r\nagencies  hold  regular  dialogues  and  exchanges  among  their\r\n\r\nworking level committees to coordinate issues at the operational\r\n\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned the National Science and\r\n\r\nTechnology  Board.  NSTB also plays a role in  this  area.   But\r\n\r\nNSTB's role is mainly to do with R&D on a very broad basis.   So\r\n\r\nwhere  it  concerns IT, they are of course involved in  the  R&D\r\n\r\naspects.  NSTB is under my Ministry.  So there is no problem  of\r\n\r\ncoordination.  The essential point of this change is to  broaden\r\n\r\nthe  scope of NCB so that it is not just a provider of  computer\r\n\r\nservices to the Government, which was its original role, but  to\r\n\r\nbroaden it and recognise that IT is a very big industry, and  to\r\n\r\nput  the  focus  on  development  of  mainly  the  software  and\r\n\r\ninfrastructural  aspects on NCB.  In  so  doing,  they  will  of\r\n\r\ncourse  have  to work with all the relevant agencies,  including\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry   of  Communications,  on  the  telecommunication\r\n\r\naspects.   NCB  and  the other agencies will  be  provided  with\r\n\r\nadequate  funding  for their purposes.  Already  the  funds  are\r\n\r\nprovided  in  the budget and, if need be, there could  be  other\r\n\r\nfunds provided.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Mr Lee Yock Suan].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of electronic commerce, or e-commerce for\r\n\r\nshort,   is   transforming  the  way  businesses  are  conducted\r\n\r\nglobally.   The  possibilities and opportunities are  limitless.\r\n\r\nLeading  Internet research companies such as ActivMedia and  IDC\r\n\r\nhave  projected worldwide Internet sales to reach the  order  of\r\n\r\nUS$200-300 billion by the year 2001.  There is little doubt that\r\n\r\ne-commerce  will become an important engine of  growth  for  the\r\n\r\nglobal economy in the next millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to be plugged into this global development and\r\n\r\nposition Singapore as an international e-commerce hub.  The  aim\r\n\r\nis  for Singapore to play the role of a secure and trusted  node\r\n\r\nwhere  e-commerce transactions from the region  and  around  the\r\n\r\nworld are processed.  To do so, a pre-requisite is to provide  a\r\n\r\nconducive  legal  and policy framework.  We need  to  create  an\r\n\r\nenvironment  of  trust,  predictability  and  certainty  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  system, with good arbitration and good  jurisdiction,\r\n\r\nfor e-commerce to flourish.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advent of e-commerce and the increasing use of the\r\n\r\ndigital medium have created some novel legal issues where  there\r\n\r\nare  yet  no clear answers.  In the physical world today,  there\r\n\r\nare  requirements for documents to be in writing and  for  hand-written  signatures.  Such requirements need  to  be  translated\r\n\r\ninto  the  electronic realm.  For communication and transactions\r\n\r\noccurring over a faceless network, there is a need for  reliable\r\n\r\nmethods  to  authenticate a person's identity and to ensure  the\r\n\r\nintegrity  of  the  electronically transmitted  documents.   The\r\n\r\nElectronic  Transactions  Bill aims to address  these  important\r\n\r\nissues   and  to  create  the  legal  framework  for  e-commerce\r\n\r\ntransactions in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in drafting the Electronic Transactions\r\n\r\nBill, the following guiding principles were adopted:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The need to conform to international standards and\r\n\r\ninternational models in order to be integrated with the global e-commerce framework;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The need to avoid over regulation;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The need to be flexible and technologically neutral to\r\n\r\nadapt quickly to a fluid global environment; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The need for transparency and predictability in our\r\n\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broadly, the Bill seeks to do the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Enact a Commercial Code to support e-commerce\r\n\r\ntransactions;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Provide for a Public Key Infrastructure;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Enable Electronic Applications and Licences for the\r\n\r\nPublic Sector; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Clarify Network Service Providers' liability for third\r\n\r\nparty content.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will describe each of these four objectives in turn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Commercial Code for E-commerce Transactions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To clearly define the rights and obligations of transacting\r\n\r\nparties,  we  need  a  commercial  code  to  support  e-commerce\r\n\r\ntransactions.  The first objective of the Bill is  thus  to  set\r\n\r\nout  a  commercial  code  that combines  the  best  features  of\r\n\r\ninternational  models such as the United Nations  Commission  on\r\n\r\nInternational Trade Law's Model Law on Electronic  Commerce  and\r\n\r\nthe   Illinois  Electronic  Commerce  Security  Act.   The  Bill\r\n\r\ncontains  provisions dealing with how a contract can  be  formed\r\n\r\nelectronically, and the status and use of electronic  signatures\r\n\r\nand records.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Electronic Contracts</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on electronic contracts in general. While rules on\r\n\r\nthe  formation  of  contracts are clear in the  physical  world,\r\n\r\nthere  are  significant  ambiguities in  the  electronic  world.\r\n\r\nThere  is  therefore a need to enact legislative  provisions  to\r\n\r\nclarify the rules of formation of electronic contracts.  Part IV\r\n\r\nof the Bill clarifies that contracts can be made electronically.\r\n\r\nIt  also deals with the issues of time and place of sending  and\r\n\r\nreceipt of electronic messages.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Electronic Records and Signatures</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on electronic records and signatures. Part II of\r\n\r\nthe Bill clarifies that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nelectronic signatures have the same legal binding effect as that\r\n\r\nof written signatures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transactions and submissions that are currently done and\r\n\r\nsigned  in  written  form can also be done in  electronic  form.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  in  the generating and processing  of  electronic\r\n\r\nrecords,  Parts II and IV of the Bill can be varied by agreement\r\n\r\nbetween the parties to a transaction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As e-commerce is still in an early stage of development, we\r\n\r\nforesee  a period of time before the international scene settles\r\n\r\ndown.   As such, the provisions of the Bill should not  at  this\r\n\r\ntime   go  so  far  as  to  require  recognition  of  electronic\r\n\r\nsignatures  and  documents in place of physical forms  entirely.\r\n\r\nThere are certain classes of documents or transactions that  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  ready for such an immediate change.  Hence, insofar  as\r\n\r\nPart II and Part IV of the Bill are concerned, it is provided in\r\n\r\nclause 4 that in certain matters such as wills and documents  of\r\n\r\ntitle,   the   electronic  records,  signatures   and   contract\r\n\r\nprovisions  do not apply.  This does not, however,  prevent  the\r\n\r\ncourts from recognising the use of electronic documents in these\r\n\r\nmatters  on  a  case-by-case  basis.   Eventually,  when  public\r\n\r\nconfidence  in electronic transactions grows, the  Bill  may  be\r\n\r\nwidened to include such documents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Secure Electronic Records and Signatures</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on secure electronic records and signatures. We\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  in the digital world, there is no  face-to-face\r\n\r\ninteraction.    As   a   result,  issues  concerning   identity,\r\n\r\nauthenticity  and integrity arise.  One solution that  has  been\r\n\r\ngaining popular support is the digital signature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A digital signature, when affixed to an electronic\r\n\r\ndocument,  has  two essential properties.  It  confirms  that  a\r\n\r\ndocument has not been tampered with since the time the signature\r\n\r\nwas  fixed.   It  also  identifies  the  person  who  fixed  the\r\n\r\nsignature.   Traditional hand-written signatures do not  perform\r\n\r\nthese  functions  with  the same degree  of  certainty.   It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore justifiable to afford some evidentiary presumptions on\r\n\r\ndigital  signatures and the documents on which they are affixed,\r\n\r\nif  these  signatures are created in accordance  with  a  secure\r\n\r\nprocedure.  The Bill\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovides for this legal effect.  The use of such signatures will\r\n\r\nsupplement  the electronic contract rules that I have  described\r\n\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Bill provides for the circumstances and\r\n\r\nconditions under which electronic records and signatures are  to\r\n\r\nbe  treated as secure.  Parts VI and VII of the Bill  go  beyond\r\n\r\nelectronic  signatures to describe the legal effect  of  digital\r\n\r\nsignatures and the general duties relating to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Public Key Infrastructure</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now move on to the second objective\r\n\r\nof the Bill which is to provide for a Public Key Infrastructure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generation and verification of digital signatures are\r\n\r\ndone  through cryptographic algorithms using a pair  of  private\r\n\r\nand   public  keys  unique  to  an  individual.   A  Public  Key\r\n\r\nInfrastructure,  consisting  of  Certification  Authorities   as\r\n\r\ntrusted third parties, needs to be set up to enable public  keys\r\n\r\nto   be  issued  in  a  reliable  manner.   Singapore  has  been\r\n\r\ndeveloping such an infrastructure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this infrastructure, the Certification Authority\r\n\r\n(CA),  certifies  that a given public key is associated  with  a\r\n\r\ngiven  individual.  A CA may perform a face-to-face verification\r\n\r\nof  the individual before such a certification is given, in  the\r\n\r\nform   of   a   digital  certificate.   This   certificate   can\r\n\r\nsubsequently be used to confirm the public key of an individual,\r\n\r\nand  verify  the signature that is generated by the  individual.\r\n\r\nNetrust  is the first CA in Singapore to issue keys for  digital\r\n\r\nsignatures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CA, being in a position of trust, needs to be subject\r\n\r\nto  some  standards and controls, so that there will  be  public\r\n\r\nconfidence in the services it offers.  These are set out in  the\r\n\r\ngeneral duties of the CAs prescribed in Part VIII of the Bill\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also corresponding duties on the subscribers of\r\n\r\nsuch  CA  services.  These are set out in Part IX of  the  Bill.\r\n\r\nThese  duties will not create criminal offences, but  will  form\r\n\r\nthe basis on which courts may attach civil liabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>CA Licensing Scheme and Controller of CA</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voluntary licensing scheme is proposed in the Bill. Only\r\n\r\nlicensed  and  approved  CAs  will enjoy  the  benefits  of  the\r\n\r\nevidentiary presumptions that I described earlier for signatures\r\n\r\ngenerated from the certificates issued.  The exception  to  this\r\n\r\nis  where parties agree to be bound by signatures created  by  a\r\n\r\ncommercially reasonable procedure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closed networks may continue to use unlicensed CAs for\r\n\r\ntheir own purposes.  They may, however, also be licensed to gain\r\n\r\nthe full benefit of the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides in clause 41 for the appointment of a\r\n\r\nController  of CAs.  The Controller will, amongst other  duties,\r\n\r\nlicense, certify, monitor and oversee the activities of CAs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 42 further provides for regulations to be made\r\n\r\nconcerning  the  licensing and regulation  of  CAs  and  when  a\r\n\r\ndigital  signature  qualifies as a secure electronic  signature.\r\n\r\nThe Bill provides for different consequences in situations where\r\n\r\na CA is licensed as opposed to one where the CA is not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 45 of the Bill also provides for licensed CAs to\r\n\r\nenjoy  the  limitation of liability for any loss caused  by  the\r\n\r\nreliance on a false or forged digital signature of a subscriber,\r\n\r\nas  long as the CA has complied with the requirements under  the\r\n\r\nAct.   Foreign  CAs  recognised by  the  Controller  will  enjoy\r\n\r\nsimilar  benefits.   This is known in the  industry  as  \"cross-certification\" and will facilitate cross-boundary e-commerce.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Electronic Applications and Licences for the Public  Sector</i>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to now go on to the third\r\n\r\nobjective of the Bill, which is to provide for the acceptance of\r\n\r\nelectronic documents by the public sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote the use of the electronic medium in the public\r\n\r\nsector,  the Bill will contain an omnibus provision in  Part  XI\r\n\r\nfor  Government  departments  and  statutory  boards  to  accept\r\n\r\nelectronic filing without having to amend their respective\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nActs.   It  also  allows  public bodies  to  issue  permits  and\r\n\r\nlicences electronically.  It is an \"opt-in\" provision,  so  that\r\n\r\nthose agencies that are not yet ready to go \"paperless\" are  not\r\n\r\ncompelled  to  do so.  However, the Government is  committed  to\r\n\r\nmaking  available counter services in the electronic  medium  as\r\n\r\nfar as possible and where it is cost-effective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 63 of the Bill makes a related amendment to the\r\n\r\nInterpretation Act (Cap. 1) to allow regulations on  the  manner\r\n\r\nand method of electronic filing and issuance to be made by these\r\n\r\npublic  bodies  under their respective Acts.  The amendments  to\r\n\r\nthe  definition  of \"Gazette\" and \"Government  Gazette\"  in  the\r\n\r\nInterpretation  Act is to enable the Government to  publish  the\r\n\r\nGazette electronically on the Internet, in addition to the  hard\r\n\r\ncopies printed by the Government Printers.  The Government  will\r\n\r\ntake  advantage of Internet technology to enable the Gazette  to\r\n\r\nbe  published  electronically on a daily basis instead  of  only\r\n\r\nonce  a  week.  Details of the plans are currently being  worked\r\n\r\nout and will be announced in due course by MITA.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Network Providers' Liability</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now touch on the final objective of\r\n\r\nthe Bill regarding Network Providers' Liability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is essential for the growth of a national information\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  that we manage the exposure of  network  service\r\n\r\nproviders  to the risks of liabilities for third party  content.\r\n\r\nFor  example, an Internet Service Provider (ISP) should  not  be\r\n\r\nheld  liable for objectionable contents or defamatory statements\r\n\r\non  the thousands of web sites that are accessed daily, and over\r\n\r\nwhich the ISP has no control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 of Part III of the Bill provides that a network\r\n\r\nservice  provider is not subject to criminal or civil  liability\r\n\r\nfor  third party material for which the provider merely provides\r\n\r\naccess.   Where  network service providers engage in  activities\r\n\r\nwhich  are indistinguishable from those of common carriers  such\r\n\r\nas  telephone companies and post offices, they should  be  given\r\n\r\nthe  assurance  that they will be treated in  the  same  way  in\r\n\r\nrespect of such activities.  The clause, however, will not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naffect  the obligations of a network service provider under  any\r\n\r\nlicensing or other regulatory regime established under the  law,\r\n\r\neg,  Singapore Broadcasting Authority's class licences.  It will\r\n\r\nalso  not  affect  any obligation founded  on  contract  or  any\r\n\r\nobligation  imposed  under any written law  or  by  a  court  to\r\n\r\nremove, block or deny access to any material.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Network service providers will of course continue to be\r\n\r\nliable  for their own content, or third party content that  they\r\n\r\nadopt or approve of.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this Bill will have a significant impact on the growth\r\n\r\nof electronic commerce in Singapore, the views of the public and\r\n\r\nof  experts in this field have been solicited when drafting  the\r\n\r\nBill.  Ministries, statutory boards, academics from the NUS  Law\r\n\r\nFaculty,  as well as practising lawyers who are known for  their\r\n\r\nexpertise  in  technology  law were consulted.   Their  valuable\r\n\r\ncomments   and   inputs   have,   wherever   appropriate,   been\r\n\r\nincorporated into the final version of the Bill now  before  the\r\n\r\nHouse.  The National Computer Board also conducted a Round Table\r\n\r\nSession for chief executives from the industry to brief them  on\r\n\r\nthe  salient features of the Bill and to gather their  feedback.\r\n\r\nIn  general, the feedback has been favourable and supportive  of\r\n\r\nthe new legal framework.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill sets the basic\r\n\r\nlegislative    framework   for   e-commerce    and    electronic\r\n\r\ntransactions.    It  removes  existing  legal  impediments   and\r\n\r\ninstills confidence in businesses and individuals to engage in e-commerce.   This Bill will bring Singapore to the  forefront  of\r\n\r\ninternational e-commerce developments.  It will help us  achieve\r\n\r\nour vision of turning Singapore into an international e-commerce\r\n\r\nhub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to express my\r\n\r\nsupport for this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of this Bill is both opportune and\r\n\r\nnecessary.   It is opportune because Singapore has aimed  to  be\r\n\r\nwired\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nup  nation-wide  under the Singapore One programme  as  a  fully\r\n\r\nintegrated and networked nation, striving to be one of the  most\r\n\r\nprogressive nations in the area of information technology in the\r\n\r\n21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary because with the advent of widespread use\r\n\r\nof  the world-wide web and the Internet for electronic commerce,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be a need to set rules and regulations  to  protect\r\n\r\nboth  the  providers and users of goods and services offered  on\r\n\r\nthe Internet.  The future market place is in the Internet or the\r\n\r\nso-called  cyberspace.  This cyberspace market is  a  burgeoning\r\n\r\nmarket  where the volume and value of transactions will explode.\r\n\r\nAs  the Minister has stated, by the year 2001, it is expected to\r\n\r\ngrow  to  S$200  billion.  Hence, it is  imperative  that  there\r\n\r\nshould be proper rules to govern this market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have three main points to raise with regard to this\r\n\r\nBill.    First,  on  publicity  programme.   This   concept   of\r\n\r\nelectronic commerce is still very new to many people.  Most  are\r\n\r\nnot  aware of the full implications; how it works; what are  the\r\n\r\nrisks and responsibilities; what is an electronic signature; and\r\n\r\nhow  do  the certification authorities such as Netrust  operate.\r\n\r\nHence,   I   feel  that  the  Government  should   undertake   a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive publicity programme to educate the public  on  the\r\n\r\nentire concept and the system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on the protection of the users. I wish to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister whether the present level of controls and penalties are\r\n\r\nadequate to protect the users, particularly the small consumers.\r\n\r\nElectronic commerce is very vulnerable to computer frauds.  When\r\n\r\na  hacker  gains access into a computer, he can get the  account\r\n\r\nnumbers  and  signature  codes of  users.   Thereafter,  he  can\r\n\r\nwithdraw large sums of money or use another person's account and\r\n\r\nelectronic signature to purchase goods in the cyberspace market.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a user of a service has to provide his account number\r\n\r\nand  signature  code.   Hence, there is an  inherent  risk  that\r\n\r\nothers can get unauthorised access, and use the information  for\r\n\r\nfraudulent purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the sums of money involved in computer frauds can be\r\n\r\nlarge,  I wish to ask the Minister whether the present level  of\r\n\r\npenalties  proposed  in  the Bill is  adequate  to  serve  as  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is on foreign participation. I wish to ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister whether foreign-based individuals and companies can\r\n\r\nregister  with the certification authorities and participate  in\r\n\r\nthe  electronic commerce in Singapore.  On the one hand,  if  we\r\n\r\nlimit  the participants to just Singapore-based individuals  and\r\n\r\ncompanies,  we  are  also limiting the size  and  scope  of  the\r\n\r\nmarket.  On the other hand, if we were to extend the coverage to\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore, there are many legal and physical  problems.\r\n\r\nLegally, do our laws have extra-territorial coverage?  How do we\r\n\r\npolice  and  exercise  controls?  How do we  handle  claims  and\r\n\r\nsuits?  Do we have the capacity to deal with the volume?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the many issues and complications of the\r\n\r\ncyberspace.   Essentially, the question is: who has the  rights,\r\n\r\nthe means and the clout to become the \"government\" in cyberspace\r\n\r\nwhere there are no physical boundaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister will enlighten us on these\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, given\r\n\r\nthe  increasingly  large  role  that  technology  plays  in  our\r\n\r\neveryday  lives, the introduction of this Bill is  timely.   The\r\n\r\nBill   provides   a  comprehensive  framework   for   electronic\r\n\r\ntransactions in general and focuses on electronic commerce.   An\r\n\r\nimportant  feature of this Bill is that electronic  transactions\r\n\r\nwill  be  given  their  due  legal  effect,  and  a  transaction\r\n\r\nconducted electronically, for example, over the Internet, is now\r\n\r\ndeemed to be a valid and enforceable contract, as provided   for\r\n\r\nin clause 11.  However, I would like the Minister to clarify the\r\n\r\nfollowing  issues, especially those pertaining  to  transactions\r\n\r\ninvolving the individual as an end consumer who is a party to an\r\n\r\nelectronic transaction.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Scope of coverage, especially cross border transactions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister seems to imply that not all cross border\r\n\r\ntransactions involving a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nparty  outside Singapore would fall within this legal framework.\r\n\r\nIf  so,  would the public know how to differentiate between  the\r\n\r\ntransactions  that  are and those that  are  not  covered?   For\r\n\r\nexample, when the Act comes into effect, will an individual, who\r\n\r\nruns  into  a problem with his purchase from a company overseas,\r\n\r\nhave any legal recourse?  Will he know that, even before he puts\r\n\r\nhis  order  across?  On a broader scale, will  there  be  enough\r\n\r\npublic education on matters that are excluded, as elaborated  in\r\n\r\nclause  4, for example, the creation or execution of a will,  or\r\n\r\nany  contract for the sale of immovable property?   This  is  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  public  will  not  be  misled  by  fraudulent\r\n\r\nrepresentations.   The  importance  of  a  comprehensive  public\r\n\r\neducation programme cannot be overstated.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Understanding the legality of an electronic transaction</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When electronic commerce takes on greater significance,\r\n\r\nmore  individuals are likely to transact through  the  Internet.\r\n\r\nDoing  one's  shopping  over the Net would  soon  become  common\r\n\r\nplace.   However, will there be enough education to help  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  public  understands the legality of  such  electronic\r\n\r\ntransactions?   That, once the transaction has  been  completed,\r\n\r\nneither  the  purchaser nor the supplier may change their  minds\r\n\r\nand  rescind  from the contract nor vary the terms unilaterally.\r\n\r\nEven though one may never have met the other party with whom one\r\n\r\nis  signing  this  contract, the clicking of the  mouse  or  the\r\n\r\nkeying  in of the credit card details and the necessary  digital\r\n\r\nsignatures  will have the same effect as putting  one's  pen  to\r\n\r\npaper.   This  brings  to  mind  the  question:  which  is   the\r\n\r\nappropriate body to turn to when one has enquiries or complaints\r\n\r\nwith  regards to electronic transactions?  Does one turn to CASE\r\n\r\nor  the  Small Claims Tribunal or the Certification  Authorities\r\n\r\nfor answers to one's questions?\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Responsibility of a subscriber</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public must note that once they have registered\r\n\r\nthemselves  as subscribers, they have a legal duty under  clause\r\n\r\n39 \"to exercise reasonable care to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nretain control of the private key and prevent its disclosure  to\r\n\r\na  person  not  authorised  to create the  subscriber's  digital\r\n\r\nsignature.\"    As no specific penalty was prescribed,  it  would\r\n\r\nappear that contravention of this will render them liable  under\r\n\r\nclause  56  to  a  maximum fine of $20,000 or a maximum  of  six\r\n\r\nmonths'  imprisonment or both.  For electronic  commerce  to  be\r\n\r\ntruly  successful and effective, it would appear that  the  more\r\n\r\nusers,   and   therefore  subscribers,  we  have,  the   better.\r\n\r\nUnderstandably,  there do not appear to be  stringent  statutory\r\n\r\nnor  other  specific requirements to be met before  one  can  be\r\n\r\nregistered as a subscriber.  This brings me back to the point of\r\n\r\neducation again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will subscribers understand the obligations upon\r\n\r\nregistration or the significance of digital signatures?  Or will\r\n\r\nthis result in unwanted transactions by a family member who  has\r\n\r\nbeen entrusted with the subscriber's private key?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the above points raised, the introduction\r\n\r\nof    the   Bill   also   presents   some   important   economic\r\n\r\nconsiderations.   Now  that the Government  has  lent  its  full\r\n\r\nsupport  to electronic commerce, what impact will this  have  on\r\n\r\nour local economy, particularly the small and medium businesses?\r\n\r\nDoes this mean that more business will be diverted to those  who\r\n\r\nhave the presence on their net, or who can facilitate electronic\r\n\r\ntransactions or even to suppliers overseas?  There is no looking\r\n\r\nback  now.   On the other hand, the signal is not for businesses\r\n\r\nto  jump on to the Internet band wagon.  How best can we prepare\r\n\r\ncompanies, especially the small and medium businesses, for  such\r\n\r\nnew but inevitable developments?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the advent of electronic commerce, middlemen of any\r\n\r\nsize  will potentially be squeezed out.  They may then be forced\r\n\r\nto  concentrate  on  the one area which they  triumph  over  the\r\n\r\nelectronic  medium, ie, the human factor.    You  cannot  put  a\r\n\r\nfriendly  human touch across electronically.  In contrast  to  a\r\n\r\ncomputer   screen,  non-electronic  services   can   provide   a\r\n\r\npersonalised  touch, a friendly smile and a generally  feel-good\r\n\r\nsentiment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, the introduction of this Bill is\r\n\r\ntimely,  as it anticipates the legal issues that may arise  with\r\n\r\nan  increasing undertaking of electronic commerce.   However,  a\r\n\r\ngreat deal of attention must be paid to educating the public and\r\n\r\nbusiness  community on the effects and economic implications  of\r\n\r\nsuch transactions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, public communication\r\n\r\nnetworks  such as Intenet are becoming vital business tools  for\r\n\r\norganisations that wish to implement electronic transactions.  A\r\n\r\nkey factor which has prevented many  organisations from engaging\r\n\r\nin   this   type  of  services  is  security.   Unsecured   data\r\n\r\ntransmitted  over  an  untrusted public network  is  vulnerable.\r\n\r\nData  is  subject  to  interception,  vandalism,  mutation   and\r\n\r\nunauthorized  access  to an organisation's network  by  unknown,\r\n\r\nunauthorised and sometimes hostile users.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enable companies to take advantage of business\r\n\r\nopportunities created by the Internet while avoiding the  risks,\r\n\r\nthere  must  be  technology to provide secure  transactions  and\r\n\r\nthere  must  be  the legal framework to ensure  that  electronic\r\n\r\ntransactions are safe and valid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technology to provide secure electronic transactions is\r\n\r\nreadily  available  now.   In Singapore,  Internet  banking  has\r\n\r\nalready  been  piloted  or implemented in  several  banks.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment has led the push for Internet commerce by introducing\r\n\r\nseveral  initiatives  such as Singapore One,  coupled  with  the\r\n\r\navailability  of  key  technologies such  as  secure  electronic\r\n\r\ntransaction  protocol, Internet commerce is poised to  take  off\r\n\r\nrapidly in Singapore in the next few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An IDC Asia-Pacific Report recently indicated that in\r\n\r\nSingapore  the number of users accessing the Net will grow  from\r\n\r\n62,529  at  year-end 1996 to 1.3 million by year-end 2001.   The\r\n\r\npercentage  of users buying goods and services on the  web  will\r\n\r\ngrow  significantly  from  8.1% in December  1996  to  34.3%  by\r\n\r\nDecember  2001.  The same report also forecasts  the  amount  of\r\n\r\nelectronic commerce in Singapore to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngrow  dramatically  from US$1.07 million  at  year-end  1996  to\r\n\r\nUS$883  million  by  year-end 2001.  Other  countries  are  also\r\n\r\nmoving  on to electronic commerce fast.  Japan is giving  a  big\r\n\r\npush  for  electronic  commerce.  Their Ministry  of  Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry (MITI) has since 1995 committed an equivalent of  S$486\r\n\r\nmillion  as  seed  venture  capital  to  finance  50  electronic\r\n\r\ncommerce projects.  The Minister has also given an indication of\r\n\r\nelectronic  commerce  in  the  United  States.   The  electronic\r\n\r\ncommerce  in the US is expected to exceed US$500 billion  within\r\n\r\nthis  year and is expected to increase by US$70 billion per year\r\n\r\nthrough the end of the decade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of electronic commerce is transforming the\r\n\r\nway  business is conducted globally.  The possibilities for  new\r\n\r\nbusiness opportunities are practically limitless.  Singapore has\r\n\r\nalways been in the forefront of IT development and usage in this\r\n\r\nregion.   With  our IT infrastructure, we are able  to  position\r\n\r\nourselves as an international electronic commerce hub.  We  have\r\n\r\nthe  capability  to play the role of a secure and  trusted  node\r\n\r\nwhere  electronic  commerce transactions from  anywhere  can  be\r\n\r\nprocessed.  To do so, we need to provide a conducive  legal  and\r\n\r\npolicy  framework  to facilitate the development  of  electronic\r\n\r\ncommerce.   Sir, we have that environment now.  The Bill  before\r\n\r\nthe  House  today  seeks  to provide the  legal  regulatory  and\r\n\r\nenforcement  framework.  It is a timely Bill with  a  tremendous\r\n\r\nimpact on our economic development.  I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, business in cyberspace is a whole new faceless and\r\n\r\nintangible  world  fraught with risks and  uncertainties.   This\r\n\r\nBill  defines the rights and obligations of transacting parties.\r\n\r\nBut  how  does this Bill provide the protection of the different\r\n\r\nplayers  in  an  electronic  transaction?   Then  there  is  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  tax  which  is silent  in  this  Bill.   Different\r\n\r\ncountries have different views on the question of tax.   On  the\r\n\r\none  hand, the European Community is concerned that the Internet\r\n\r\nwill create a black market that cannot be taxed, which will mean\r\n\r\na  loss  of  revenue  to  the government.   The  United  States,\r\n\r\nhowever,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nadvocates that no new tax be applied to Internet commerce.  Sir,\r\n\r\nis our 3% GST applicable to electronic transactions?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the development of electronic commerce in Singapore\r\n\r\nmust  have consistency with international regime.  International\r\n\r\ncooperation  and  inter-operability  are  necessary.   Will  the\r\n\r\ncertification  authorities specified in this  Bill  be  globally\r\n\r\ninter-operable?   Perhaps  the area  where  electronic  commerce\r\n\r\ncauses  the greatest problem is jurisdiction of tax.  Cyberspace\r\n\r\nis  a  borderless and yet cross border transactions will  become\r\n\r\nmore popular.  Identifying which country has jurisdiction to tax\r\n\r\nthe  proceeds from the new form of commerce is a significant and\r\n\r\ndifficult  issue.   How  does the Bill  apply  to  cross  border\r\n\r\ntransactions,  tax and legal issues, when there  is  a  lack  of\r\n\r\ngeography  in determining the place of formation and performance\r\n\r\nof contracts?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies in the United States have shown that electronic\r\n\r\ncommerce  brings big and small organisations to an even  footing\r\n\r\nas  the entry barrier to a presence in the virtual shopping mall\r\n\r\nis very low.  There are some 91,000 small and medium enterprises\r\n\r\nin   Singapore  employing  more  than  half  of  the   country's\r\n\r\nworkforce.   They  will  benefit most from electronic  commerce.\r\n\r\nBut  SMEs  are  today  predominantly  concerned  with  the  more\r\n\r\nimmediate  and  fundamental  issues like  staying  in  business,\r\n\r\ntrying  to  make  a  profit, and overcoming  competition.   SMEs\r\n\r\ngenerally   do   not  perceive  that  electronic  commerce   can\r\n\r\nsubstantially assist them with these primary concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of appreciation of SMEs today on the potentials\r\n\r\nfor   electronic  commerce  to  provide  competitive  advantage,\r\n\r\nencourage  and support export opportunities, is still relatively\r\n\r\nlow.   There is an urgent need for Government and their agencies\r\n\r\nto  set  up  programmes to assist SMEs in coming to  terms  with\r\n\r\nelectronic  commerce  more quickly.  This can  be  done  through\r\n\r\nextensive  education and training.  NCB perhaps could  establish\r\n\r\nan  electronic commerce resource centre which will help SMEs  to\r\n\r\naccelerate  adoption  and implementation of relevant  electronic\r\n\r\ncommerce technologies for business\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbenefits.   The  Government can help SMEs to avoid uncoordinated\r\n\r\ndevelopment   of   underlying  technology  which   could   cause\r\n\r\nincompatibility  resulting in problems  of  integration  in  the\r\n\r\nglobal  market.   Assistance in the form  of  funding  could  be\r\n\r\nprovided  for  projects that encourage SMEs to  be  involved  in\r\n\r\nelectronic  commerce.   SMEs usually do not  have  the  in-house\r\n\r\nexpertise  for  system integration and many will  need  to  seek\r\n\r\nexternal  advice  and  assistance.   Perhaps  Government  should\r\n\r\nconsider grants for SMEs to engage consultants to advise on  how\r\n\r\nto implement electronic commerce strategies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, electronic commerce will be the next lap for\r\n\r\nbusiness  growth.  With this Bill, the legal safeguards  are  in\r\n\r\nplace.   The  Government  should  now  encourage  and  help  all\r\n\r\nbusinesses  to  formulate a coherent and  integrated  electronic\r\n\r\ncommerce   strategy   as   a  basis  for  sustainable   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  to  speak in general support of the Bill.  May I just  say\r\n\r\nfirst  that I was in fact consulted earlier as a member  of  the\r\n\r\nNUS  Law  Faculty regarding this Bill, but I did  not  make  any\r\n\r\nrepresentations  on the issues that I will raise  today.   So  I\r\n\r\nhope that I am not estopped from speaking on them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it necessary to draw the attention of Members to a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  issues that this Bill raises but are not  adequately\r\n\r\ndealt  with.   Sir, the Bill, in its intention, is to facilitate\r\n\r\nelectronic  transactions,  especially  commercial  transactions.\r\n\r\nThat such a Bill is necessary, there can be no doubt.  Among the\r\n\r\nstated  purposes is the security of communications as  well  as,\r\n\r\nand  I quote, \"to promote public confidence in the integrity and\r\n\r\nreliability  of  electronic  records and  electronic  commerce.\"\r\n\r\nThese are aims that we can all support.  The question is whether\r\n\r\nthe Bill, as it stands, achieves these purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with a couple of preliminary issues. First,\r\n\r\ndespite what the Minister indicated just now, it should be noted\r\n\r\nthat  the Bill is not technology neutral.  It deals in the  main\r\n\r\nwith digital signature systems.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nOf course, there are other security systems that are in frequent\r\n\r\nuse.  For example, certain US companies are using secure  socket\r\n\r\nlayers, avoiding the need for the rather more cumbersome process\r\n\r\nof certification and digital signatures. The Bill does not cover\r\n\r\nthis  type  of  secure  transactions even  though  for  ordinary\r\n\r\nelectronic  commerce, such methods are perfectly acceptable  and\r\n\r\nefficient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Bill adopts somewhat confusing terminology. I\r\n\r\nrefer,  in  particular,  to the use of the  term  \"certification\r\n\r\nauthority\".  In Singapore, we use the word \"authority\" to  refer\r\n\r\nto Government agencies and regulatory bodies.  Frankly, what the\r\n\r\nBill  is  seeking to refer to are actually certification service\r\n\r\nproviders  who  are  in  turn  subject  to  the  control  of  an\r\n\r\nauthority,   in   this   case,  the  so-called   Controller   of\r\n\r\nCertification  Authorities.   To call  a  certification  service\r\n\r\nprovider  a  certification authority may be  misleading  to  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  public and I would hope that the term be  redefined  to\r\n\r\nits proper form, that is to say, certification service provider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Bill is very technically drafted. If one of its\r\n\r\nobjectives  is  to  promote  public confidence  in  the  use  of\r\n\r\nelectronic transactions, it will take a very serious attempt  to\r\n\r\nmake the general public understand the complexities contemplated\r\n\r\nin  the public key infrastructure.  In particular, I would  draw\r\n\r\nattention  to  the technical definition of  \"digital  signature\"\r\n\r\nwhich   in   turn  depends  on  the  definition  of  \"electronic\r\n\r\nsignature\"  -  two definitions.  Both these definitions  do  not\r\n\r\nseem  to  convey  the  idea  to the general  public  that  these\r\n\r\nsignatures  are meant to be unique links to the signatory,  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  capable of identifying the signatory and are presumed\r\n\r\nto  be  under the signatory's control.  It is also necessary  to\r\n\r\nassure the signatory, the public, that subsequent alteration  of\r\n\r\ndata would not be possible using such a system.  This simple but\r\n\r\nimportant reassuring element is not found anywhere in the  Bill.\r\n\r\nFrankly,  the  Bill needs to be less technical  and  technology-specific  if  it  were to achieve its purpose of raising  public\r\n\r\nconfidence in the use of electronic transactions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I turn to the very serious issues concerning liability\r\n\r\nin  the  electronic world.  There are at least  three  areas  of\r\n\r\nconcern  here  for  me.   The first  has  to  do  with  consumer\r\n\r\nprotection in the world of electronic commerce; the second,  the\r\n\r\nliability  of  network service providers,  and  the  third,  the\r\n\r\nliability of certification service providers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take consumer protection first, and the importance\r\n\r\nof  realising  that  electronic  contracts  are  very  different\r\n\r\nanimals from paper-based contracts that most of us are used  to.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  sign  a  paper-based contract, we  are  appending  our\r\n\r\nsignature  to  a document that is frozen in print and  for  that\r\n\r\nmatter  in  time.  Any dispute arising out of the  contract  can\r\n\r\nthen  be referred to the document containing the terms.  Usually\r\n\r\nboth  contracting parties would have a copy.  In the  electronic\r\n\r\nworld, contract is a dynamic entity that is capable of change in\r\n\r\nmicroseconds.  To take a simple example, in the law of contract,\r\n\r\nit  is  possible  to  incorporate by reference  terms  found  in\r\n\r\nanother  document.   However, such terms would  not  be  binding\r\n\r\nunless  the contracting parties know of their existence  at  the\r\n\r\ntime  of  the  contract.   In  the electronic  environment,  the\r\n\r\nprovision of hyperlinks is commonplace.  What is also likely  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  person who posted a document can change a hyperlinked\r\n\r\ndocument at will.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My worry is that in electronic commerce, trading partners\r\n\r\nmay  change  terms, say, regarding time for payment or  interest\r\n\r\nrates  without the knowledge of the other party. This  would  be\r\n\r\nvery serious indeed because if a dispute were to arise, it would\r\n\r\nbe  by  no  means clear that the consumer would have a  specific\r\n\r\ncontract  to  refer to.  There is no such thing as  an  original\r\n\r\ncontract  and  a copy in the electronic world.  How  this  issue\r\n\r\nshould be tackled is not readily apparent in this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In passing on this subject on certainty of terms, I should\r\n\r\nalso mention that the effect of the provision in clause 7, where\r\n\r\nthe law provides that certain contracts should be in writing and\r\n\r\nelectronic  version  can also be acceptable,  is  a  very,  very\r\n\r\nserious one, because it means that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontracts  of guarantee which are required to be in writing  can\r\n\r\nnow  be  in  electronic form.  They are not excluded  under  the\r\n\r\nBill.   Contracts  of  guarantee impose secondary  liability  on\r\n\r\nguarantors and usually it is absolutely essential to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  terms  of  the guarantee are clear and that the  guarantors\r\n\r\nknow  what  they  are letting themselves in for.   This  section\r\n\r\n(clause 7) seems to allow electronic guarantees.  I am not  sure\r\n\r\nwhether  this  is intended for it can have serious repercussions\r\n\r\non those who are guarantors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I turn to a provision that is both imprecise and\r\n\r\nperhaps  too wide.  I refer to clause 10 - liability of  network\r\n\r\nservice providers.  First of all, there is no definition of what\r\n\r\na  network service provider is.  As the exemption from liability\r\n\r\nis extremely wide for network service providers, they are exempt\r\n\r\nfrom  both  civil and criminal liability in certain  situations.\r\n\r\nIt  seems to me to be a serious omission not to have defined the\r\n\r\nterm  \"network  service provider\" in the Bill.  Leaving  such  a\r\n\r\ntechnical  term  for  the  judges  to  define  may  be  to  risk\r\n\r\nimprecision  and create uncertainty.  Unscrupulous organisations\r\n\r\nmay  also  be able to use the wide exemption from liability  for\r\n\r\nundesirable purposes as the provision also can exempt them  from\r\n\r\ncriminal liability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take a simple example. Organisation X may set up a\r\n\r\nstring  of  servers  to  allow  users  to  upload  copyright  or\r\n\r\ndefamatory materials.  When prosecuted for such offences, it may\r\n\r\nclaim that it is a network service provider, thus attracting the\r\n\r\nexemption  of  some liability under clause 10. Frankly,  it  may\r\n\r\nwell succeed.  Surely this cannot be intended.  So if we were to\r\n\r\nhave  such a wide provision for exemption of liability, I  would\r\n\r\nrespectfully suggest that the definition of a  \"network  service\r\n\r\nprovider\"  be provided in the legislation.  In contrast  to  the\r\n\r\nwide  exemption  for  liability of  network  service  providers,\r\n\r\ncertification service providers seem to be provided for only  in\r\n\r\nterms  of forged digital signatures and misrepresentation.   One\r\n\r\nshould  have thought that it is necessary to include a provision\r\n\r\nto   exempt   certification  service  providers  from  liability\r\n\r\nrelating  to  inaccurate  facts given  to  them  by  subscribers\r\n\r\nprovided the certification service provider\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhas  taken  reasonable steps to verify them.   Similarly,  there\r\n\r\nshould be some limitation to liability with regard to the use of\r\n\r\ncertificates for purposes that were not intended by the  service\r\n\r\nproviders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have raised the issues above not because I am\r\n\r\nagainst  the Bill.  I am strongly in support of such legislation\r\n\r\nbut I think that more careful consideration needs to be given to\r\n\r\nits  provisions.  I hope that sufficient time will be given  for\r\n\r\nconsideration of these provisions.  As it stands,  the  Bill  is\r\n\r\ntechnical and the content gaps should be plugged.  Frankly,  the\r\n\r\nBill  is seeking to facilitate electronic commerce.  We  can  in\r\n\r\nprinciple support such an effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I just say that we must realise that there\r\n\r\nwill  also  be social costs involved.  Member of Parliament  Mrs\r\n\r\nLim  Hwee  Hua  has  already  made reference  to  these.   I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned  in particular about the ease with which  trading  can\r\n\r\ntake  place  on the Net.  Indeed, the whole family can  now  sit\r\n\r\ndown  comfortably  in front of the computer and  shop  to  their\r\n\r\nhearts'  content.   I can see that many may be  tempted  by  the\r\n\r\noffers  that may come through the Net and be persuaded to  spend\r\n\r\neven  more than they should.  I hope that the relevant  agencies\r\n\r\nwill  closely monitor this new phenomenon of cyber shopping  and\r\n\r\nto  regulate it more carefully if the need arises.       Sir,  I\r\n\r\nsupport the Bill subject to the comments I have made.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I am the Chairman of CommerceNet Singapore\r\n\r\nLimited which is a grouping of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommercial companies that has been set up to promote e-commerce,\r\n\r\nto  set  standards, to provide feedback on laws and policies  to\r\n\r\nthe Government, and as a self-regulatory business association.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have to say too that I have been involved\r\n\r\nfrom the early days of this Bill because I was fortunate to have\r\n\r\nbeen invited on the Drafting Committee and I have also given  my\r\n\r\nfeedback  at  various times to the various agencies involved  in\r\n\r\nthis.   Still, as with all committees, there are certain  things\r\n\r\nwhich  of  course  I  feel  have to be addressed  but  were  not\r\n\r\naddressed  satisfactorily or, as with  committees,  I  get  out-voted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to raise these issues publicly in this House\r\n\r\nfor  clarification and also to have these aired so  that  others\r\n\r\ncan  join  in the debate.  As has been evident from the speeches\r\n\r\nof the Members earlier on before the break, there are many, many\r\n\r\nmore issues which have to be addressed and these may have to  be\r\n\r\ntaken  up  at a different time.  This is why even though  I  was\r\n\r\nminded to move some amendments to this Bill, I have decided that\r\n\r\nwe should not put barriers in the path of this Bill, but have it\r\n\r\ngo through and then work at refining and fine-tuning it later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in support of this motion, particularly, the four\r\n\r\nguiding principles that the Minister has stated.  These are  the\r\n\r\nprinciples  that, firstly, the Bill must be technology  neutral.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  it  must be light regulation.  Thirdly,  it  must  be\r\n\r\ncertain  and  transparent.  And, fourthly,  it  must  track  the\r\n\r\nglobal developments in this area: Because if Singapore tries  to\r\n\r\nrun too far ahead of the crowd, it could say that it is a leader\r\n\r\nbut  there is no point in being a leader when it turns back  and\r\n\r\nsee  that  the  rest  of the field has actually  turned  off  or\r\n\r\nsidetracked and gone off in a different direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now address the specific points of these four\r\n\r\nguiding  principles.  First of all, I do share some reservations\r\n\r\nabout  its  total  neutrality, as Prof. Chin mentioned  earlier.\r\n\r\nThere is, for example, in clause 3, an over-emphasis on the word\r\n\r\n\"electronic\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nClause    3   talks   about   electronic   records,   electronic\r\n\r\ncommunications, etc. The medium of electronic communications  is\r\n\r\nnot  the only communication channel for e-commerce, particularly\r\n\r\nif   technology  in  optical  communications  and   radio   wave\r\n\r\ncommunications  is  considered.  Like Prof.  Chin,  I  think  it\r\n\r\nappears  to  be  a  Bill which gives overdue  treatment  to  the\r\n\r\ndigital  signature.  I have raised this several times throughout\r\n\r\nthe  course of this drafting and I know that efforts  have  been\r\n\r\nput  in  to  make  sure  that there is  a  set:  the  electronic\r\n\r\nsignature - which means any procedure that you can have,  it  is\r\n\r\ntechnology  neutral.  And with digital signature,  it  is  meant\r\n\r\nonly  to  be  a  sub-set  which gives the  law  certainty.   The\r\n\r\nintention is good and it is there but, as I will point out later\r\n\r\nin my speech, does not come through all that well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, which is a guiding principle, is that it\r\n\r\nmust be light regulation.  In other words, we should try and  be\r\n\r\nas sparing with new rules as we can until we are sure that these\r\n\r\nare  necessary.   In  this context, I would  like  to  highlight\r\n\r\nclause  9  which  aims to make all electronic records  generally\r\n\r\nrecognised  in law.  Prof. Chin has reservations in that  if  we\r\n\r\nmake  this  too wide, it could cover a lot of transactions  that\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  on  paper yet, like consumer transactions,  for\r\n\r\nexample.  Again, I will raise that in a while.  But clause 9 has\r\n\r\nthis  intention that if the law allows for an electronic record,\r\n\r\nthen  the Electronic Transactions Bill should carry on with  it.\r\n\r\nBut  where  the law is silent, the intention is that  this  Bill\r\n\r\nwill  make  it possible.  The proviso, however, I feel  is  like\r\n\r\ngiving  with  one hand and taking away with the other.   We  say\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  possible to have electronic records  provided  the\r\n\r\napproval of the department or ministry of the Government,  organ\r\n\r\nof  State  or  the statutory corporation, which has  supervision\r\n\r\nover  the  requirement for the retention  of  such  records,  is\r\n\r\nmandatory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister how would a\r\n\r\nbusinessman  who wants to do e-commerce know whose  approval  he\r\n\r\nneeds  from  the thousands of Government agencies around.   Most\r\n\r\nwould  of course clear with the known regulators, like the  MAS,\r\n\r\nIRAS, Customs and Excise, RCB and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Stock  Exchange  of Singapore Ltd (SES).   What  if,  after\r\n\r\nclearing  all these points with the agencies involved, one  fine\r\n\r\nday  down  the road, some obscure Government agency says,  \"Hey,\r\n\r\nyou  didn't  check  with me and therefore the  whole  record  is\r\n\r\ninvalid.\"   This  proviso  should be removed  in  future.   This\r\n\r\nproviso  in  clause 9(1)(d), particularly, should  be  tolerated\r\n\r\ntemporarily to give Government agencies time to put in place the\r\n\r\ncontrol and security measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an illustration, a quick reading of the Companies Act\r\n\r\nwould give confidence that company books, accounts and registers\r\n\r\nare  expressly permitted to be electronic, for example, sections\r\n\r\n199  and  395 of the Companies Act.  But the average businessman\r\n\r\nis still not sure if his contractual documents and other papers,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  invoices,  for  which  he  needs  to  verify  his  tax\r\n\r\nliability,  can be paperless till the taxmen say so.   And  this\r\n\r\nmeans nobody would convert his papers to electronic records with\r\n\r\nclear  confidence.  So you have the regulation, but I think  the\r\n\r\nproviso in clause 9(1)(d) has gone too far.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, the Minister could take the opportunity to clarify\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  agencies fully support  the  use  of  IT,\r\n\r\ndocument processing systems and e-commerce systems and will  not\r\n\r\nplace unnecessary burdens in the way of businesses which wish to\r\n\r\nexecute  and convert electronic documents, especially  if  these\r\n\r\ndocuments  are  electronic  from the  outset  of  the  creation.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, businessmen would be asked impliedly to maintain  two\r\n\r\nseparate systems, ie, paper and electronic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of certainty and transparency, great efforts have\r\n\r\nbeen  made  to clarify.  But like what they say on the  Internet\r\n\r\nwebsites, \"This site is under construction.\"  I would  say  that\r\n\r\nthis  Act  is  under construction.  It is still something  which\r\n\r\nneeds to be further worked on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention has been made to clause 4. Clause 4 says that we\r\n\r\nare  trying to do some incremental  changes here and  we  should\r\n\r\nnot be too broad and sweep out all the paper immediately.  There\r\n\r\nare  some things that still require paper, for example, as Prof.\r\n\r\nChin has pointed out, consumer\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntransactions.  We need to protect the consumers, we need to keep\r\n\r\ncertain  seriousness  and  certain  warning  procedures   inside\r\n\r\ncontracts that deal with consumers.  At various stages,  I  have\r\n\r\nactually  raised this issue.  Again, as I said, because  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  an  issue  on  which  I have been  out-voted,  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nemphasise again that consumer transactions, for example, such as\r\n\r\nthose dealing with guarantees, money lending, hire purchase  and\r\n\r\neven  the  provisions of the Unfair Contract  Terms  Act,  which\r\n\r\nProf.  Chin  has alluded to, should be included in the  list  of\r\n\r\nexclusions in clause 4.  And obviously, the Minister has got the\r\n\r\npower  in the subsidiary legislation to introduce this if he  is\r\n\r\nso minded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 too deals with documents of title. This is a\r\n\r\nclause  which is one thing to businessmen and another  thing  to\r\n\r\nlawyers  because the meaning differs.  It is probably useful  to\r\n\r\nclarify  that the meaning here is that of law, which means  that\r\n\r\nessentially title deeds which are documents of title to land and\r\n\r\nnegotiable  bills of lading which are truly in law  only  quasi-negotiable and these would have to be specially and specifically\r\n\r\ncovered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 is another clause needing certainty. Prof. Chin\r\n\r\nhas said that this is a clause which is too wide because network\r\n\r\nservice  providers cover the whole world.  Sir, I beg to  differ\r\n\r\nand because I beg to differ, maybe it is not clear after all.  I\r\n\r\nthink  this clause is too narrow in scope.  Seemingly, it covers\r\n\r\nonly  Internet  service providers (ISPs).   It  does  not  cover\r\n\r\nresellers  of  network  services,  such  as  Singapore   Network\r\n\r\nServices, for example, or America Online.  And it does not cover\r\n\r\noperators of cybermalls, such as, perhaps, locally, we have Silk\r\n\r\nRoute ventures.  It does not cover search engine operators, such\r\n\r\nas  Yahoo  and  Alta Vista, and other providers of  services  or\r\n\r\nnetworks whose service may be used to disseminate defamatory and\r\n\r\ninfringing  works of copyright even when these are beyond  their\r\n\r\ncontrol.  If the intention is only to cover ISPs, then  I  think\r\n\r\nit is too narrow because there are certain commercial operations\r\n\r\nlike  this  that  also need that protection from defamation  and\r\n\r\ncopyright  infringement  for things that  they  cannot  control,\r\n\r\nunless the Minister says that this particular clause is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  provision only limited to protection of ISPs from hackers and\r\n\r\nnon-subscribers.   If so, this is a very restrictive  protection\r\n\r\nand does not give much comfort for e-commerce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10(3) deals with third parties over which the\r\n\r\nservice  provider has \"no effective control\".   What  does  this\r\n\r\nmean?  Most service providers can put in their service contracts\r\n\r\nthat the subscribers must not use the service to post illegal or\r\n\r\noffensive  material.  They can reserve the rights  to  terminate\r\n\r\nservices  and pull out or block objectionable content  and  they\r\n\r\ncan   indemnify   themselves  from  the  consequences   of   the\r\n\r\nsubscribers' breaches of contract.  They can also add,  if  they\r\n\r\nso  wish,  a  clause to prohibit the subscribers  from  defaming\r\n\r\nothers  but  they  cannot prevent such people from  deliberately\r\n\r\nbreaching the rules and the agreement.  They can only do so by a\r\n\r\nlengthy  court proceeding.  This, however, may still be seen  to\r\n\r\nbe  \"effective control\" and thus the service provider's immunity\r\n\r\nwould  be  removed, and that is why I say this  provision  would\r\n\r\nonly  protect the service provider against incursions by hackers\r\n\r\nand  non-subscribers.   If this is not  the  case,  I  wish  the\r\n\r\nMinister could clarify that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going on to clause 13(3)(b), it deals with relationships\r\n\r\nand  it  says  that if the relationship to the originator  of  a\r\n\r\nmessage  is  close  enough,  then  it  is  the  message  of  the\r\n\r\noriginator.   Is  this  relationship  contractual,   social   or\r\n\r\nfiduciary?   Does it mean a degree of proximity as in  marriage,\r\n\r\nin  kinship?   In  other  words, does it cover  parents,  child,\r\n\r\nsiblings,  in-laws?   Or is it wider than that,  covering  legal\r\n\r\nrelationships,  such  as  employer/employee,  licenser/licensee,\r\n\r\nlandlord/tenant?  I think this can be clarified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13(4)(c) says that it may be unconscionable to rely\r\n\r\non  an  electronic  record.  This is a big word.   What  is  the\r\n\r\nmeaning of \"unconscionable\"?  Perhaps the Minister could clarify\r\n\r\nthis too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15(1) deals with despatch and it says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`. despatch of an electronic record occurs when it enters\r\n\r\nan information system outside the control of the originator .'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThis  is  not applicable obviously when an Intranet owner  or  a\r\n\r\nservice  provider sends messages to its own subscribers, because\r\n\r\neverything  is within its control.  It does not go  out  of  its\r\n\r\ncontrol.   So, what rules of sending and receipt would apply  in\r\n\r\nthis case?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15(2)(a) says that there is a designated information\r\n\r\nsystem  that you can send documents to.  Should this  designated\r\n\r\ninformation system be expressly designated?  If not, is the mere\r\n\r\nmention  of  an  e-mail address on my name  card  sufficient  to\r\n\r\ndesignate  that  I  intended  to receive  contractually  binding\r\n\r\ndocuments at that mail box?  This cannot be so, as I could  well\r\n\r\nmean it as a means of social communication only.  I give you  my\r\n\r\ne-mail  address to chit chat with me, not to send me a contract.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I may not necessarily be indicating an \"information\r\n\r\nsystem\", but essentially a messaging system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, there is this question of designated information\r\n\r\nsystem   designated by whom and to whom.  If I tell X my  e-mail\r\n\r\naddress  and Z comes along and takes that address from X without\r\n\r\nmy  knowledge and consent, am I designating to Z?    What  if  I\r\n\r\nhave it on my name card which I give only to X without intending\r\n\r\nand not expecting that he should pass it on to Z?  And what if I\r\n\r\nhave  my  professional  card and my  CASE  card  and  they  both\r\n\r\ndesignate different e-mail addresses, as they do, can a document\r\n\r\nbinding on my law firm, in this case, be sent to my CASE  e-mail\r\n\r\naddress?   This  is not satisfactory.  I hope the  Minister  can\r\n\r\nalso clarify this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neatest rule in an electronic system is really to have\r\n\r\na  rule  which requires actual receipt.  This can mean  in  most\r\n\r\ncases  the  actual retrieving or opening of the message  by  the\r\n\r\nrecipient,  and  it  is up to the sender  to  stipulate  to  the\r\n\r\nrecipient that arrival in the latter's mail box is sufficient by\r\n\r\nprior  arrangement or by agreement, if that is  what  he  wants.\r\n\r\nThis is the same as the rules for receipt of messages by fax  or\r\n\r\ntelex,  except that in situations where a mail box is  expressly\r\n\r\nstipulated  as a place of receipt of legally binding  documents,\r\n\r\nthen this express designation moves the time of actual\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreceipt  to the time when the message is deposited or is capable\r\n\r\nof being retrieved from the designated mail box.  And so I would\r\n\r\nhope  that in future there is a clarification, and mail box  can\r\n\r\nbe defined as referring to the server or the system on which the\r\n\r\nmail service is run.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to clause 23, there is, I think, a need to have\r\n\r\nmore  direct  language in this provision.   As  it  stands,  the\r\n\r\nclause can mean one of two things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It can mean that it is foreseeable that a relier on\r\n\r\ndigital  signature will also rely on a valid  certificate.   And\r\n\r\nhence,  if the issuer has issued a false certificate,  there  is\r\n\r\nnegligence straightaway without further proof, as foreseeability\r\n\r\nis a test of the existence of a duty of care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) It can refer to the fact that it is foreseeable that a\r\n\r\nrelier  on  a digital signature should also go on to  check  the\r\n\r\nvalidity  of the certificate issued, failing which he  would  be\r\n\r\nheld to be negligent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which meaning is it (a) or (b)? Or perhaps the law is\r\n\r\nspeaking  with  a forked tongue!  We should be more  precise  in\r\n\r\nthis respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim has mentioned a problem with clause 39. It is the\r\n\r\nsame problem with clause 40 also.  Here, the subscriber has  got\r\n\r\ncertain obligations, eg, to keep the keys safe and to inform the\r\n\r\ncertification  authority  (CA) when the  private  key  has  been\r\n\r\ncompromised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no clear provision in these two clauses as to\r\n\r\nwhether a breach of this is a criminal offence or it gives  rise\r\n\r\nto  civil  liability.   Mrs Lim seems to think  that  clause  56\r\n\r\napplies because it is a criminal offence, but I do not think  it\r\n\r\nis all that clear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of offences, are the penalties for violation\r\n\r\nof  clauses  25, 26 and 42 sufficient?  Cheating under  sections\r\n\r\n419 and 420 of the Penal Code are subject to penalties of up  to\r\n\r\nthree to seven years in jail respectively.  Under clauses 25, 26\r\n\r\nand  42,  the penalties are not that serious.  Should electronic\r\n\r\ncheating  warrant any less protection?  As has been pointed  out\r\n\r\nby  Prof. Chin, the instances of consumers being cheated on  the\r\n\r\nNet would be immense, and immensely possible too.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth guiding principle that the Minister has\r\n\r\nmentioned  about  this  Bill is that it hopes  to  track  global\r\n\r\ndevelopments  in this area, and there are many model  laws,  for\r\n\r\nexample, that have been drafted by different countries.  Some of\r\n\r\nthese are already existing legislation.  And I do know that  the\r\n\r\ncommittee in drafting this Bill referred to provisions as varied\r\n\r\nas  the Utah Digital Signature Act, the Illinois Act, German Act\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have raised this point that it is good and\r\n\r\nfine  for us to have a law which deals with electronic commerce.\r\n\r\nBut  as with all laws, it is territorial in nature.  It can only\r\n\r\napply to Singapore transactions and to transactions in which the\r\n\r\nparties  stipulate the use of Singapore law.  When  you  have  a\r\n\r\ncross-border transaction as e-commerce is wont to be, then it is\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  say that Singapore law applies and therefore  the\r\n\r\nconsumer must not be lulled into thinking that now he can  trade\r\n\r\non all these cyber stores in the United States, Germany or Italy\r\n\r\nwith  clear laws.  The whole idea of tracking international laws\r\n\r\nand  developments  in this area, especially the  United  Nations\r\n\r\nCommission for International Trade Law model provisions, is that\r\n\r\nwe  are able to achieve total harmonisation of the laws when all\r\n\r\ncountries  in  the  world  accept  the  model  laws.    This  is\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  a  United  Nations  Convention  where  all  the\r\n\r\nsignatory   parties  would  sign  and  the  law  is  immediately\r\n\r\neffective   once   the  different  Parliaments   pass   domestic\r\n\r\nlegislation to accept those laws.  But the model law is meant to\r\n\r\nbe  something that you can follow at your own pace, at your  own\r\n\r\ntime.   And  so we have actually followed some of the provisions\r\n\r\nbut not all of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for consumers and business dealings all\r\n\r\naround  the  world, across borders, that there must  be  maximum\r\n\r\nharmonisation of laws in different countries, just as  there  is\r\n\r\nharmonisation  of laws for letters of credit.  The International\r\n\r\nChamber  of  Commerce  has a set of model provisions  which  are\r\n\r\nincorporated  into letters of credit contracts  by  bankers  and\r\n\r\ntraders all around the world.  And different courts, even though\r\n\r\nthey have different ways of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlooking  at  these model provisions, nonetheless,  have  adopted\r\n\r\nsimilar  approaches.  We hope that if the model laws are adopted\r\n\r\nall  around the world, then the fact that ours is the first  Act\r\n\r\nin this area, it is not going to be too significant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point of harmonisation, I have argued that the\r\n\r\nelectronic  commerce  provisions of the Electronic  Transactions\r\n\r\nBill are separate from the digital signature provisions.  I have\r\n\r\nargued  that the two sets of provisions should be kept  separate\r\n\r\nas  two  separate pieces of legislation.  Prof. Chin has earlier\r\n\r\non  alluded to some of the difficulties in this: Because of  all\r\n\r\nthe  digital  signature provisions, this Bill  has  become  very\r\n\r\ntechnical  and  loaded down with details  which  should  not  be\r\n\r\nthere.   I  feel that in the spirit of the United Nations  model\r\n\r\nlaws,  for example, they have two separate model laws;  one  for\r\n\r\nelectronic commerce and one for digital signature.  Because when\r\n\r\nyou   talk   about   contractual   principles   and   rules   of\r\n\r\ncommunication, you are talking about concepts.  You are  talking\r\n\r\nabout  principles and you are not bogged down by the  technology\r\n\r\nand  it  does not matter what technology is used as long as  the\r\n\r\nprocedures are there.  Firstly, the technology itself  is  going\r\n\r\nto  change  very  fast and very soon digital  signatures  within\r\n\r\nthree  to five years might actually be obsolete.  And we  should\r\n\r\nnot entrench these provisions into a general Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the contractual rule gives rise to civil\r\n\r\nliability,  but  most of the digital signature  framework  gives\r\n\r\nrise  to  regulatory and prescriptive provisions,  a  breach  of\r\n\r\nwhich  gives  rise  to criminal liability, and  this  is  really\r\n\r\ntrying to mix everything and be all things to all men, which  is\r\n\r\nnot very good for clarity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the EC Policy Committee has argued that this\r\n\r\ncombining of two different laws into one would aid retrieval and\r\n\r\nreference,  but  I think, with respect, this  is  not  a  strong\r\n\r\nargument  because digital signature is a state  of  art  set  of\r\n\r\nwords and people who want to look for laws on digital signatures\r\n\r\ncan look for them under that title.  And if they are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlooking for laws on electronic commerce, I suspect there are not\r\n\r\ntoo  many  laws in our statute books that have got an electronic\r\n\r\ntitle,  and  I  do  not think therefore it is  going  to  be  so\r\n\r\ndifficult to chase.  Nonetheless, if they become two Bills, they\r\n\r\ncould  cross  refer  to  each other and, ultimately,  electronic\r\n\r\nsearches are possible in Singapore, since we have statutes on CD-ROMs.  Then, a good search engine is really all that you need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would agree that we cannot burden an electronic\r\n\r\ntransaction Bill with all these technical provisions, but it  is\r\n\r\nnow  a fact and I would hope that eventually we can rethink this\r\n\r\nand in the next set of rules, try to separate the technical from\r\n\r\nthe  clearly conceptual and the legal principles.  I think  this\r\n\r\nis possible and I look forward to that day.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I rise in support of\r\n\r\nthis Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only important and necessary in our growing IT\r\n\r\noriented society but timely as we and the world move quickly  to\r\n\r\nembrace electronic commerce.  This Bill will give legal standing\r\n\r\nto  electronic transactions which will be the basis of a growing\r\n\r\nnumber  of  commercial exchanges.  However, I am concerned  with\r\n\r\nthe  wide  scope  of  clause 48(1) that appears  to  taint  with\r\n\r\nillegality  innocent  acts  like the forwarding  of  e-mail  and\r\n\r\ninformation   obtained   from  the  Internet.    We   must   not\r\n\r\ninadvertently set obstacles to curtail the usefulness, potential\r\n\r\nand  growth of a medium of communication of the future.  I would\r\n\r\nlike the Minister's assurances that the provision and others  in\r\n\r\nthis Bill do not inadvertently taint innocent exchanges and acts\r\n\r\nbetween parties on the Internet.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank all the\r\n\r\nMembers  who  have spoken for their support of  the  Bill,  even\r\n\r\nthough some of them have reservations about very specific  legal\r\n\r\nor  technical aspects of this Bill.  I will try and  respond  to\r\n\r\nthe  main  points that have been raised.  I can  assure  Members\r\n\r\nthat  my officers have been listening very carefully to all  the\r\n\r\npoints  made and they will refer them to the relevant Ministries\r\n\r\nand agencies to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfurther study this matter.  This Bill really represents the best\r\n\r\neffort  up  to  this point in time by the officers concerned  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with a very complicated area which is fast evolving.  Like\r\n\r\nHong  Kong,  Australia, US and so on, we are trying to  position\r\n\r\nourselves  at the forefront of this fast developing field  which\r\n\r\nholds  great  potential  for  us.   I  think  there  is  a  good\r\n\r\npossibility for us to become an electronic commerce hub  and  to\r\n\r\nbe a place where people have confidence in doing business on the\r\n\r\nNet,  making use of our trustee services and so on,  because  of\r\n\r\nour  record of reliability, transparency and the high regard  of\r\n\r\nthe  international  community for  our  laws  and  the  judicial\r\n\r\nprocess.  This is an area we want to position ourselves  quickly\r\n\r\nto  try  and  take advantage of what is fast evolving.   In  the\r\n\r\nprocess,  they  have  come  out  with  a  Bill  which  is  quite\r\n\r\ntechnical.   They have assured me that they have tried  to  make\r\n\r\nthis Bill neutral so that later on when there are other kinds of\r\n\r\ntechnology  they  can  be  incorporated  fairly  readily.   This\r\n\r\nremains to be seen. But there is no big problem because, if need\r\n\r\nbe, the Bill can be refined and further improved upon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Members that public education is very\r\n\r\nimportant.   It  is not just a question of investing  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney into Singapore One, infrastructure and so on.  We must get\r\n\r\npeople  to  use it.  This means changing the habits  of  people.\r\n\r\nThey  may  prefer to go shopping and make it a day's outing  for\r\n\r\nthe  family.  We are trying to make it convenient for people  to\r\n\r\nshop on the Net and also to do business, especially cross border\r\n\r\nbusiness.  We are not trying to cater just for Singaporeans.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, Singaporeans, being so used to changes in the way we  do\r\n\r\nthings, are a good test bed, as it were.  Once we have wired  up\r\n\r\nthe  whole island into an intelligent island, we can try out new\r\n\r\nservices,  video-on-demand, education and of course  e-commerce.\r\n\r\nThat is an area where a lot of people are putting in effort  and\r\n\r\nwe  ourselves  are  involved in the  international  arena.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  in  APEC, we are working with Australia.  We  co-chair\r\n\r\nthis  APEC  Task  Force on E-Commerce.  So we  have  raised  the\r\n\r\nprofile of Singapore to be one of the key players in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important that we have this education programme,\r\n\r\nwhich has to be an on-going effort, to bring the public on board\r\n\r\nand to make them confident of what we are trying to do.  So this\r\n\r\nwhole  law is to give confidence to consumers and businesses  to\r\n\r\nmake use of the systems that have been developed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the systems that NCB has developed is the digital\r\n\r\nsignature system which makes use of a dual key system where  one\r\n\r\nparty  holds  a  private  key  and the  so-called  certification\r\n\r\nauthority certifies that this is indeed the person and there  is\r\n\r\na  public key that can be matched with this private key  through\r\n\r\nsome computer process so that it can assure the two parties that\r\n\r\nin fact they are dealing with the people they profess to be.  So\r\n\r\nthis process of identification comes in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This system also helps to ensure that the documents are not\r\n\r\naltered once they have been signed.  I have been told that  this\r\n\r\nprocess actually does that.  This will give extra confidence  to\r\n\r\nthe businesses and the consumers.  Even without this system,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  a  lot  of business has already been done.  For  example,\r\n\r\nthose who order on mail service or order on the Internet and you\r\n\r\ngive  your  credit  card  numbers.  In fact,  you  are  exposing\r\n\r\nyourself to misuse of the credit card numbers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas if people were to use this system here, at least\r\n\r\nthey  have the assurance.  For example, if you trade shares  and\r\n\r\nyou bid COEs or other big transactions, the parties involved are\r\n\r\nreally the parties they claim to be, and there is assurance that\r\n\r\nthe  documents  are secure and the process is  safe,  and  where\r\n\r\nthere  are disputes the law tries to provide for those disputes.\r\n\r\nIt  has  to  be read together with other kinds of laws governing\r\n\r\nfraud,  contracts  and  so on.  This is to  make  it  such  that\r\n\r\ntransactions done on the Net electronically can also be accepted\r\n\r\nin  a  court.   Government ministries and departments  like  the\r\n\r\nInland  Revenue  Authority  are  gradually  moving  on  to  this\r\n\r\npaperless world on an opt-in system.  Not everything can be done\r\n\r\npaperless.   There are certain areas like wills and title  deeds\r\n\r\nwhere you still need\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npaper. The Bill provides for those areas to be exempted.   Later\r\n\r\non, when we are ready we can bring them in.  So to answer Dr Toh\r\n\r\nSee Kiat's point about businessmen being confused, I think there\r\n\r\nshould be no confusion here because it depends on what area  you\r\n\r\nare  involved  with.   It  is  for the  Government  ministry  or\r\n\r\ndepartment  to  say,  \"Okay, from now  on,  we  can  accept  the\r\n\r\nelectronic  documents for this purpose.\"   So  businessmen  will\r\n\r\nhave  to know what are the areas they need to look into and,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary, clarify with the departments concerned.  There is  no\r\n\r\ncentral  body  responsible for this.  It is up to the  different\r\n\r\nMinistries  and agencies to come on board as and when  they  are\r\n\r\nready. Even when they come on board, they may still insist  that\r\n\r\ncertain documents be kept on paper form.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In using this system, of course, there are responsibilities\r\n\r\nof  the  parties involved, not only the certification authority,\r\n\r\nbut also the holder of the private key.  Just like you would not\r\n\r\nallow your ATM card to be used by your family members, you  must\r\n\r\nalso  be careful that you do not allow your family members  easy\r\n\r\naccess to these keys and misuse them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, following this Bill, there is another Bill\r\n\r\nknown  as  the  Computer Misuse (Amendment) Bill which  will  be\r\n\r\nenhancing penalties for different kinds of fraud or hacking  and\r\n\r\nso  on.  So we are trying to do all these things to provide  the\r\n\r\ntechnical and legal infrastructure, enhance the penalties and so\r\n\r\non,  to make sure that we are in a position to make use of  this\r\n\r\ntechnology  and  take advantage of this new and  exciting  field\r\n\r\nthat  opens  up  vast  opportunities for  us  in  the  field  of\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point about the use of the term \"certification\r\n\r\nauthorities\",  I have been told that in fact this  is  the  term\r\n\r\nthat has been internationally recognised and used in the USA and\r\n\r\nother  OECD countries.  I agree with the Member that in  reading\r\n\r\nthis Bill, one gets the impression that \"authority\" often refers\r\n\r\nin  our case to Government.  But it is a matter of getting  used\r\n\r\nto the term and, if need be, we can of course make changes later\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua asked how this would apply to cross border\r\n\r\nsituations.  What are the liabilities and so on?  This Bill does\r\n\r\nprovide  for  the  possibility  of  cross  certification.    For\r\n\r\nexample,  the NCB has signed a memorandum of understanding  with\r\n\r\nits counterpart in Canada to recognise each other's certificate.\r\n\r\nThrough this process, we can extend the coverage of this law  to\r\n\r\nalso  the  other parties, or the contracting parties  themselves\r\n\r\ncan  opt  to  be  covered by certain laws.  So those  situations\r\n\r\ncould be provided for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new technology provides a lot of scope for the small\r\n\r\nbusinesses because through this means they are able, for example\r\n\r\nto  create  their web page, which can then allow them to  access\r\n\r\nthe   international  market.   There  have  been  instances   of\r\n\r\ncompanies which are very small, for example in Australia,  which\r\n\r\nare  able  to  grow  their business through making  use  of  the\r\n\r\nsystem.  So we have to help our small industries through various\r\n\r\nmeans,  through funding support for example, in computerisation,\r\n\r\nthrough helping them to hire consultants and so on, to get  them\r\n\r\non  to  this  new  process.   So my Ministry  and  the  relevant\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards will work together with the  SMEs  to  educate\r\n\r\nthem  and  help them in this process.  I think this is  a  great\r\n\r\nopportunity  for them because it levels the field.   It  is  not\r\n\r\nonly the big players who are able to make use of this electronic\r\n\r\ncommerce   but   also   the  small  firms.    There   could   be\r\n\r\npossibilities,  for  example, of central bureaus  which  provide\r\n\r\nservice to these companies so that it is not too costly for them\r\n\r\nto  develop their own systems.  So they can make use of a common\r\n\r\nsystem to get on to the world markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in the process, it may also cut out certain\r\n\r\nmiddleman roles. There will be certain businesses which will  be\r\n\r\naffected,  because when the seller can reach the buyer directly,\r\n\r\nthey  do  not need the middleman.  This  may be true  in  theory\r\n\r\nbut,  in  practice,  for big deals you still  want  to  see  the\r\n\r\nperson.   It  is  a matter of trust.  So it is unavoidable  that\r\n\r\nthere must still be person to person contacts and there will  be\r\n\r\na  role  for  the  middleman in marrying these parties.   So  it\r\n\r\ncannot displace this middleman role in that situation.  It might\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  more useful in cases like where you are trying to sell books\r\n\r\nor relatively small items.  There again, because of our physical\r\n\r\nlocation and our shipping and airport facilities and so  on,  we\r\n\r\ncan  combine  the  commerce  area, the  Internet,  the  ease  of\r\n\r\ncommunication,   the  trust  and  so  on,  with   our   physical\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  to position ourselves so that  we  are  able  to\r\n\r\nservice  the region and they are able to place their orders  for\r\n\r\nproducts  which  are  then kept here, whether  it  is  books  or\r\n\r\nconsumer  items  or  spare parts.  There  again,  combining  the\r\n\r\nInternet  possibilities with all the logistic  possibilities,  I\r\n\r\nthink, will open up a great new area for us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin touched on quite a few legal points. As I said,\r\n\r\nI  will  ask  my  officers to look further into  them.   He  was\r\n\r\nconcerned   that  the  exemptions  given  to  Internet   service\r\n\r\nproviders are too broad and so forth.  This is an area which has\r\n\r\nbeen   looked   into  very  carefully.   The  Attorney-General's\r\n\r\nChambers  have  been involved in this area and perhaps  I  could\r\n\r\njust read out to Members their comments on this point:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Clause 10 was drafted after very careful consideration of\r\n\r\nthe  scope  of  protection that should  be  granted  to  network\r\n\r\nservice  providers.  Special attention should be  given  to  the\r\n\r\nwords \"merely provides access\".  These words are in a sense  the\r\n\r\nlinch-pin  of  the section.  Protection is only available  where\r\n\r\nthe  network service providers merely provide access.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords, where the service provider is merely fulfilling a conduit\r\n\r\nrole  in the transmission of content from the originator to  the\r\n\r\nend user.  This conduit-only role would occur, for example, when\r\n\r\nInternet  access service providers provide connectivity services\r\n\r\nthat  allow their subscribers to access web sites in  far  flung\r\n\r\ncorners  of the globe.  In such a case, these companies are  not\r\n\r\naware  of,  have  no  control  over,  and  should  not  be  held\r\n\r\nresponsible for the content that the user obtains from these web\r\n\r\nsites.   This  type of protection is similar to  the  protection\r\n\r\nenjoyed  by  the  postal service in respect of  the  content  in\r\n\r\npostal  mail.    However, if the network service  provider  does\r\n\r\nanything more than merely provide access, then the protection is\r\n\r\nnot available to him.  Two examples are:\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) where the network service provider hosts on its servers\r\n\r\nor servers under its control the content in question.  In such a\r\n\r\nscenario,  the  service provider has direct and  actual  control\r\n\r\nover  the content and cannot in respect of the content be merely\r\n\r\nproviding access; and\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) where the network service provider does not host but adopts\r\n\r\nby  reference or hyperlinking the content of a third party.   In\r\n\r\nsuch  a scenario, the network service provider may, by endorsing\r\n\r\nit, be deemed to have adopted the content as its own.  Hence, if\r\n\r\na network service provider recommends or points users\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  content which infringes intellectual property rights, he may\r\n\r\nbe deemed to have adopted such content to be his own, and may be\r\n\r\nheld  responsible  for contributing to the infringement  of  the\r\n\r\ncopyright owner's rights.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to emphasise that clause 10 is not\r\n\r\nintended  to impose or create liability when there is  currently\r\n\r\nno liability under common law.  What it does is to make it clear\r\n\r\nthat   there   is   no   liability  within  certain   restricted\r\n\r\ncircumstances  where  the  provider does  no  more  than  merely\r\n\r\nprovide access.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much would depend on the facts of each particular case.\r\n\r\nClause  10  leaves  it  to a court to decide  in  each  instance\r\n\r\nwhether the network service provider has in fact done more  than\r\n\r\nmerely provide access.  I would like to point out that clause 10\r\n\r\ndoes  not  absolve the network service providers from regulatory\r\n\r\nregimes  such  as  the Singapore Broadcasting Authority's  Class\r\n\r\nLicence Scheme which requires some service providers to prohibit\r\n\r\naccess to certain objectionable material.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to assure the Member that we are\r\n\r\nfollowing international trends very closely.  If there is a need\r\n\r\nto  fine-tune clause 10 in the light of the experience of  other\r\n\r\ncountries or other international developments, we will do so.'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.So this is the response from the Attorney-General's\r\n\r\nChambers on this particular point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered most of the points.

Members are going to be disappointed.   I  am\r\n\r\nnot going to defer the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read\r\n\r\na Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Central Provident Fund (Amendment) Bill before the\r\n\r\nHouse  today  seeks to amend the Central Provident Fund  Act  to\r\n\r\nenable  the  implementation of CPF policies regarding  voluntary\r\n\r\ncontributions,  intra-account  transfers  and   the   CPF   Home\r\n\r\nProtection  Scheme.   The  Bill also  seeks  to  streamline  the\r\n\r\nenforcement  and  recovery of CPF contributions.   I  shall  now\r\n\r\nhighlight the major changes introduced by this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Voluntary contributions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on voluntary contributions. Clause 2 of the Bill\r\n\r\namends  the CPF Act to expand the definition of \"member  of  the\r\n\r\nFund\"  or \"member\" to include any person who contributes to  the\r\n\r\nCPF  Fund  voluntarily.  Examples of such persons are housewives\r\n\r\nand Singaporeans working overseas.  To encourage such persons to\r\n\r\nsave  for  their retirement and medical care, a new section  13B\r\n\r\nwill  be  introduced  in  the CPF Act  to  empower  the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund Board to receive voluntary CPF contributions from\r\n\r\nsuch persons.  This amendment is in clause 3 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Intra-account transfers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on intra-account transfers, the Finance Minister had\r\n\r\nannounced  in February 1998 that CPF savings in the Special  and\r\n\r\nRetirement  Accounts  will  earn  higher  interest  rate.    The\r\n\r\ninterest rate will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  1.5%  more than the Ordinary and Medisave Accounts' interest\r\n\r\nrate  with effect from 1st July 1998.  In addition, CPF  members\r\n\r\nare allowed to transfer their savings in the Ordinary Account to\r\n\r\nthe  Special  Account  up  to a cap of $40,000  in  the  Special\r\n\r\nAccount,  with no option of reversal of the moneys  transferred.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words,  once you transfer savings  into  the  Special\r\n\r\nAccount, they will remain locked up in the Special Account until\r\n\r\nage 55.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 4 of the Bill inserts a new section 18B to\r\n\r\nallow  a  CPF  member to apply to the CPF Board  to  transfer  a\r\n\r\nportion  of his Ordinary Account savings to his Special Account,\r\n\r\nand to provide the limit on the amount which may be transferred.\r\n\r\nThis is to allow the CPF member to receive a higher interest  on\r\n\r\nhis  CPF  savings  and  to  build  up  his  cash  component  for\r\n\r\nretirement  purposes.   The transfer is only  permitted  if  the\r\n\r\namount of savings in the CPF member's Special Account is below a\r\n\r\nprescribed  amount.  This prescribed amount is  set  at  $40,000\r\n\r\ncurrently, in line with the eventual cash component of  the  CPF\r\n\r\nMinimum Sum Scheme in the year 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Home Protection Scheme</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Home Protection Scheme, or otherwise known as HPS,\r\n\r\nwas introduced in 1981 to protect CPF members and their families\r\n\r\nfrom  losing  their  HDB flats should a  member  die  or  become\r\n\r\nincapacitated permanently before the housing loan is fully  paid\r\n\r\nup.   Under normal circumstances, a member can only own one  HDB\r\n\r\nflat  at  any  one time.  However, HDB gives upgraders  a  grace\r\n\r\nperiod of six months to sell off their old flats after they have\r\n\r\npurchased  and  been allocated their new flats.  In  fact,  this\r\n\r\ngrace period may even be extended if the upgrader has difficulty\r\n\r\nselling  his  old flat and HDB will consider such  appeals.   So\r\n\r\nthere  are  occasions where HDB flat owners and CPF members  are\r\n\r\nactually owning two HDB flats for more than six months.  HPS  is\r\n\r\na  compulsory mortgage reducing term insurance for  CPF  members\r\n\r\nwho  use  their CPF savings to service HDB loans.  Hence  during\r\n\r\nthis transitional period, a CPF\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmember  legally owns two HDB flats and has to pay  the  premiums\r\n\r\nfor two HPS insurance policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not the intention of the HPS to pay insurance\r\n\r\nclaims  on  two HDB flats for one CPF member should  he  die  or\r\n\r\nbecome  incapacitated permanently before  the  housing  loan  is\r\n\r\nfully  paid  up.  Clause 5 of the Bill therefore  enacts  a  new\r\n\r\nsection  30A to provide that no person may be insured under  the\r\n\r\nHPS  for more than one HDB flat at any one time.  This provision\r\n\r\nallows  the CPF Board to automatically terminate the  HPS  cover\r\n\r\nfor  a  CPF member's existing HDB flat upon the commencement  of\r\n\r\nHPS  cover for his new HDB flat.  The CPF Board will refund  the\r\n\r\nsurrender  value of the HPS cover for the existing flat  to  the\r\n\r\nmember upon cessation of the cover.  With this amendment, should\r\n\r\na  CPF member die or become permanently incapacitated during the\r\n\r\ntransitional period when he legally owns two HDB flats, the  HPS\r\n\r\nwill  pay the insurance claim on the new flat while the member's\r\n\r\nfamily  can  proceed to sell the existing flat and  receive  the\r\n\r\nproceeds  of the sale after discharging the outstanding  housing\r\n\r\nloan for the old flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhancing the enforcement and recovery of CPF contributions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I next turn to the amendment concerning the\r\n\r\nenforcement  and  recovery of CPF contributions.   Currently  it\r\n\r\ntakes  about 100 days to prosecute employers who have  defaulted\r\n\r\non  CPF payments.  That is more than three months to trace up on\r\n\r\nan   employer   who  is  in  arrears  to  his   employee's   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution.  This long period results in employers owing  more\r\n\r\nCPF contributions to their employees because of the delay in the\r\n\r\nprosecution  action.   This  delay is  mainly  due  to  existing\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  the CPF Act which stipulate the procedures  that\r\n\r\nthe CPF Board has to follow when recovering CPF arrears from the\r\n\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, CPF contributions form part of employees' salary.\r\n\r\nEmployees use their CPF savings for various commitments such  as\r\n\r\nhousing,  healthcare and insurance, apart from savings  for  old\r\n\r\nage.   Hence, there is a need to ensure that the CPF Board deals\r\n\r\neffectively and promptly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  employers  who  have failed to pay CPF  contributions  for\r\n\r\ntheir  employees within the prescribed time, and the Board  also\r\n\r\nhas  to  speedily  recover  these contributions  which  are  now\r\n\r\noverdue.   A slow and protracted recovery process may  encourage\r\n\r\nsome employers to chalk up larger arrears at the expense of  the\r\n\r\nemployees.   The CPF Board's role is to safeguard  CPF  members'\r\n\r\ninterests  and  enforce  CPF payments to  ensure  that  members'\r\n\r\ncontributions are paid promptly.  Hence it is necessary to amend\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  Act  to  expedite the recovery of  CPF  arrears.   The\r\n\r\nproposed  amendments in four areas will reduce the total  number\r\n\r\nof  days  taken  to  recover CPF arrears to  about  60  days,  a\r\n\r\nreduction of about 40 days.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Public Prosecutor's sanction</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first area is on the Public Prosecutor's sanction.\r\n\r\nThe existing provision in the CPF Act requires the CPF Board  to\r\n\r\nget  the  Public  Prosecutor's sanction before the  Board  could\r\n\r\ncommence prosecution action against employers who have defaulted\r\n\r\nin  CPF contributions.  Since the CPF Board has always and  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  discharge its powers fairly and  impartially,  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Prosecutor has agreed that such prior  approval  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary.   Hence,  clause 6 of the Bill repeals  the  existing\r\n\r\nsection  62  to remove the requirement of obtaining  the  Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor's  sanction before initiating prosecution  under  the\r\n\r\nCPF Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Notice to Attend Court</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 also inserts new sections 62 and 62A. The new\r\n\r\nsection  62  empowers a CPF Board officer to issue a  prescribed\r\n\r\nnotice to a defaulting employer requiring him to attend court in\r\n\r\nlieu  of applying for a summons of court.  This amendment  would\r\n\r\nallow  the  CPF Board officers to issue Notices to Attend  Court\r\n\r\nsimilar  to  those  issued by the Traffic Police.   The  Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice  found that this provision had worked well for  them  and\r\n\r\n80%  to  85%  of  the  offenders have paid their  fines  by  the\r\n\r\ncomposition date.  Currently, Notices to Attend Court  are  also\r\n\r\nissued  by agencies such as the Ministry of the Environment  and\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Health for offences\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuch   as   littering,  breeding  of  disease  bearing  insects,\r\n\r\noperating  as a hawker without licence, and many other offences.\r\n\r\nThis  amendment  would  shorten  the  recovery  of  CPF  arrears\r\n\r\nsignificantly, hence benefiting employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Service of Notice to Attend Court/Summons</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new section 62A sets out the manner in which a\r\n\r\nNotice  to  Attend Court issued under the new section  62  or  a\r\n\r\nsummons  issued  by a court may be served.  Under  the  existing\r\n\r\nprovision, summonses must be served on employers personally.  It\r\n\r\nis  difficult  to locate the employers in most  of  the  default\r\n\r\ncases,  hence  usually  many attempts have  to  be  made  before\r\n\r\nsubstituted  service,  such  as  affixing  the  summons  at  the\r\n\r\nemployers'  premises  or advertisements in  the  newspapers,  is\r\n\r\nallowed by the court.  Allowing the service of Notice to  Attend\r\n\r\nCourt  and summons, for example, by registered post would reduce\r\n\r\nthe  time  taken to serve such notices or summons from  about  3\r\n\r\nweeks to only 2 to 3 days.  I would like to point out that other\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards  such as the HDB, URA  and  LTA  already  have\r\n\r\nsimilar provisions in their respective legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Composition of offences</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at present, the CPF Board is empowered to compound any\r\n\r\noffence under the Act for a sum not exceeding $200.  Composition\r\n\r\nhas  proven  to  be an effective way to deal with employers  who\r\n\r\nhave defaulted in CPF payments.  To enhance the effectiveness of\r\n\r\nthis  enforcement option, the Ministry proposes that the maximum\r\n\r\ncomposition fine be raised to $500.  This amendment is reflected\r\n\r\nin clause 7 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Certification of Board on non-payment of contributions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 of the Bill introduces a new section 66A to\r\n\r\nprovide  that a certificate issued by the CPF Board stating  the\r\n\r\namount  of  contributions  and interest  that  is  due  from  an\r\n\r\nemployer  is  to  be  treated as prima facie evidence  of  those\r\n\r\nfacts.  This is to replace the need for every\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naffected  employee  to attend court as a witness.   The  use  of\r\n\r\ncertified  documents as prima facie evidence  can  be  found  in\r\n\r\nother  legislation such as the Sale of Food Act and the  Patents\r\n\r\nAct.   Under  the  Patents Act, for example, attendance  of  the\r\n\r\nwitness  is not necessary to prove authenticity of documents  or\r\n\r\nentries authorised by the said Act.  A certificate signed by the\r\n\r\nRegistrar   can   be   admitted   as   prima   facie   evidence.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  should the Court so require, the CPF  Board  will\r\n\r\nensure that affected members attend court as witnesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the removal of the need to seek Public Prosecutor's\r\n\r\nsanction, issue of Notice to Attend Court, new service of Notice\r\n\r\nto  Attend  Court  and the certification of Board  on  the  non-payment  of  contributions will save 40 days  from  the  arrears\r\n\r\nrecovery  process.   It  will  help to  prevent  employers  from\r\n\r\ndelaying payment of their employees' CPF contributions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Priority of Claims</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently the CPF Act gives the Board priority over\r\n\r\nexecution creditors who have taken out Writs of Seizure and Sale\r\n\r\nagainst  the assets of employers.  However, the Board  does  not\r\n\r\nhave priority when creditors attach employers' bank accounts  or\r\n\r\nseize  their  movable properties.  This had  resulted  in  cases\r\n\r\nwhere  employees' CPF arrears could not be recovered.  Clause  9\r\n\r\nof  the Bill therefore amends section 68 of the Act to allow the\r\n\r\nCPF  Board  to have priority for CPF arrears over landlords  who\r\n\r\nhave taken a Writ of Distress against defaulting employers.  The\r\n\r\nsame clause also extends the Board's priority of claims to cover\r\n\r\ngarnishee order in cases where creditors have attached the  bank\r\n\r\naccounts of the defaulting employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, the amendments proposed in this Bill\r\n\r\nwill ensure that the provisions of the CPF Act will continue  to\r\n\r\nbe  relevant and in line with the objectives of the CPF  system.\r\n\r\nThe  amendments  will also remove existing rigidities  and  thus\r\n\r\nbetter safeguard employees' interests by ensuring that their CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions are promptly paid.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  support  this  Amendment Bill.  I welcome  the  further\r\n\r\nopening of the door to  voluntary contributions of CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past few years, our economy has\r\n\r\nenjoyed rapid  growth and the Government had accumulated  a  lot\r\n\r\nof surpluses.  To share  the fruits of our economic success with\r\n\r\nthe people, the Government initiated the CPF Top-Up Scheme which\r\n\r\nhas  enabled  a  lot of people in Singapore to  have  their  CPF\r\n\r\naccounts  topped  up  so  as to enjoy  better  benefits  as  CPF\r\n\r\nmembers, such as MediShield and all kinds of protection schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our present economic situation, it is unlikely\r\n\r\nthat the Government will continue to top-up our CPF accounts  in\r\n\r\nthe next two years or so.   On this perspective, I must say that\r\n\r\nthis Amendment Bill is very timely.  It provides for people  who\r\n\r\ndo  not  have a regular employment or fixed income to  have  the\r\n\r\nopportunity of enjoying the benefits provided by the CPF  scheme\r\n\r\nthrough  voluntary contributions, especially  for  temporary  or\r\n\r\ncasual  workers and self-employed people who do not have regular\r\n\r\nincomes,  such  as  private  tutors and  housewives.   With  the\r\n\r\namended  provisions  in  this Bill,  they  can  make   voluntary\r\n\r\ncontributions to their CPF accounts according to their own  free\r\n\r\nwill.   They  will  not  be excluded from the  CPF  scheme  just\r\n\r\nbecause  they  are  unable  to submit  certified  statements  to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate their incomes.  By so doing, these people enjoy the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  being covered by the MediShield scheme for  medical\r\n\r\nprotection,  not  only for themselves but for  their  dependants\r\n\r\ntoo.  With medical cost rising all the time, I think it is  very\r\n\r\nimportant to have this kind of protection, particularly when the\r\n\r\ncoverage  of MediShield or MediShield Plus is being extended  to\r\n\r\n75 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the amendment to provide for those people\r\n\r\nwho  are in  arrears in contributing to their employees' CPF  to\r\n\r\nbe summoned directly to court.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThis  would  improve our enforcement efficiency and shorten  the\r\n\r\nlegal  procedure to make sure that the employees will get  their\r\n\r\nCPF due to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceiling for composition fine is increased from $200 to\r\n\r\n$500.  This  will have a better deterrent effect.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  ask  the  Minister  whether it  is  because  the  number  of\r\n\r\noffenders has been increasing to such a great extent that it had\r\n\r\nprompted   the  Government  to  raise  the  maximum  amount   of\r\n\r\ncomposition  fine.   If  that  is  the  case,  will   the   $500\r\n\r\ncomposition  fine  be  enough to achieve the  desired  deterrent\r\n\r\neffect?   At  the same time, will the CPF Board   exercise  some\r\n\r\nflexibility in their enforcement  by first allowing  the  errant\r\n\r\nemployers  the  opportunity to explain  the  reasons  for  their\r\n\r\ndefault  in payment, before an appropriate composition  fine  is\r\n\r\noffered?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing inter-account transfer by members is a measure to\r\n\r\nbe welcomed.  But I do not understand why it has to be done only\r\n\r\nunder  certain   circumstances.  Can we not allow  all  the  CPF\r\n\r\nmembers to transfer their money from Ordinary account to Special\r\n\r\naccount  at  their  own  time,  at  their  own  convenience  and\r\n\r\naccording to their own wishes?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the amendment to Section 9 of the Act which gives\r\n\r\npriority  to claims for any sum due to the Fund so as to  better\r\n\r\nprotect the CPF members' interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, I support the Amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall be\r\n\r\nshort and sharp.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the relevant amendments\r\n\r\nthat  have been made.  They are useful amendments because,  with\r\n\r\nthe  aging  population and many of those  who  have  very  small\r\n\r\naccounts  in  their CPF, such a move for voluntary  contribution\r\n\r\nwould  help to provide support for them.  This is indeed  timely\r\n\r\nbecause they can meet their old age needs, in terms of provision\r\n\r\nof  social  security.  Sir, we need to provide a boost  to  make\r\n\r\nthis  scheme  more  successful because  voluntary  contributions\r\n\r\nbetween account holders may be helpful to an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nextent, but there are others who like to make cash contributions\r\n\r\nto their family members and friends.  For such contributions, it\r\n\r\nmay  be  necessary  to  provide some incentives  for  those  who\r\n\r\ncontribute under this scheme by way of tax deduction.  This will\r\n\r\nperhaps  encourage  more  people to transfer  savings  in  their\r\n\r\naccounts to help others who are in need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a lot of them, who are not covered, have very low CPF\r\n\r\naccounts.  The question is whether voluntary contribution itself\r\n\r\nis  going to make any significant difference.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nask the Minister whether there are any other efforts or plans in\r\n\r\nwhich he would boost or reinforce this voluntary contribution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect is the Special Account, Sir. The transfer\r\n\r\nor top-up of $40,000 in the Special Account is very useful.  But\r\n\r\nwhat is of most concern to many people is that they need medical\r\n\r\nsupport for their old age.  And to lock in such an amount in the\r\n\r\naccount  which  cannot  be  moved, is  not  in  a  way  helpful,\r\n\r\nparticularly  to  those  who are old  and  who  require  medical\r\n\r\ntreatment.   I  would  like  to  ask  whether  people  who   are\r\n\r\nparticipating in this scheme by topping up their Special Account\r\n\r\ncan  be  allowed  to move some of their money  to  the  Medisave\r\n\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> May I get some clarification from the\r\n\r\nMinister?  Sir, this is in regard to clause 3 of the Bill.   The\r\n\r\nMinister  says  that voluntary contributions  can  be  given  by\r\n\r\nhousewives and people who are employed abroad.  I can  think  of\r\n\r\nother  categories  of persons in Singapore who  will  be  making\r\n\r\nvoluntary  contributions,  such  as  the  self-employed,   small\r\n\r\nbusinessmen, like the hawkers and shopkeepers, and of course big\r\n\r\nbusinessmen who are well-off, and professionals.  I suppose that\r\n\r\nfor  small business people who make voluntary contributions,  it\r\n\r\ncan be said that they are in fact saving for their old age.  But\r\n\r\nin  the  case of people who are well-off, who may own their  own\r\n\r\nhomes and in fact own one or two other investment properties and\r\n\r\nwho have a regular  income, not only from their employment but\r\n\r\nfrom  their investments, \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthese   people  may  want   to   make   voluntary contributions\r\n\r\nnot for the purpose for which  the  CPF  Act  was enacted.   In\r\n\r\nother words, they have got no worry about  saving for  their\r\n\r\nold  age.  They are quite well-off already.   So  if these people\r\n\r\nmake voluntary contributions, they may be doing  it for other\r\n\r\nreasons, probably to save on their income tax.  So  if they really\r\n\r\ndo that, and they also want to enjoy their Medisave, in  case\r\n\r\nthere is a worse scenario situation, they  are  taking advantage\r\n\r\nof  the  CPF  system.    The  CPF  Act  was  set   up specifically\r\n\r\nto make provision for workers to save for their old age.   So  if\r\n\r\nthis  group of people takes  advantage  of  these voluntary\r\n\r\ncontributions, they may do it for their own  purpose, as I said,\r\n\r\nlike tax savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like the Minister to clarify what he means by\r\n\r\ndifferent  classes of members in the new section 13B.   Are  the\r\n\r\npeople  who  make voluntary contributions a class by itself,  or\r\n\r\nare  they  different  from  the regular  workers  who  make  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions?  Maybe the Minister could clarify.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This point about the lock-in to the Special Account has\r\n\r\nbeen  mentioned by Dr Vasoo.  It says here with  a  strong  word\r\n\r\n\"irrevocable\".   In other words, if he agrees  to  put  in  this\r\n\r\nmoney  up to a maximum of $40,000, he cannot take it out anymore\r\n\r\nuntil  he  probably reaches 55 years old.  Is there  any  escape\r\n\r\nclause here where there is a real difficulty he could just  take\r\n\r\nsome funds out?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I know time is very\r\n\r\nshort  and  I have to rush through my response.  But,  first,  I\r\n\r\nhave  to  thank  the  hon. Members, Mr Yeo  and  Dr  Vasoo,  for\r\n\r\nsupporting this Amendment Bill.  I would address the  points  as\r\n\r\nthey have raised them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo asked whether there are more and more cases of\r\n\r\nemployers  committing offences under the Central Provident  Fund\r\n\r\nAct.  While the number of such cases has not risen sharply as to\r\n\r\nattract  special attention, the point is that the $200  compound\r\n\r\nfine  limit had been set many years ago, and I think it is  time\r\n\r\nto make an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nadjustment.  If we do not do so, there may be some employers who\r\n\r\nwill  say,  \"Since the fine is so little and my  employee's  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution is so large and the interest rates being what  they\r\n\r\nare  at  the  bank,  I  can  always defer  payment  of  the  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution.   I will wait until I receive a Notice  to  Attend\r\n\r\nCourt,  then rush and pay. It is still worth my while to  be  in\r\n\r\narrears from time to time.\"  But I do not think that is  a  good\r\n\r\nsituation.   We should not encourage that.  We want to  serve  a\r\n\r\nreminder  to  all  employers that they should  pay  up  the  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution of their employees on time rather than wait.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the $500 compound fine enough? I would say at this\r\n\r\njuncture,  yes, because it was set at $200 some years  ago.   We\r\n\r\nare making a revision now.  If in the years to come, we discover\r\n\r\nthat,  again, it is not adequate as a deterrent, we  are  always\r\n\r\nprepared to review it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will we give the employers an opportunity to explain their\r\n\r\npredicament  if they are unable to pay?  Yes, the CPF  Board  is\r\n\r\nalways  ready  to  listen  to  an employer  if  they  have  some\r\n\r\ndifficulty.   It  is  up to the employer  to  make  a  firm  and\r\n\r\nconcrete  proposal  to the CPF Board to repay  all  the  arrears\r\n\r\nwithin  a certain timeframe, including the interests accumulated\r\n\r\non  the  arrears, so that the employees are not worse off.   The\r\n\r\nBoard will take into consideration such appeal but it has got to\r\n\r\nbe  assured that there is some payment coming because the  Board\r\n\r\nwill certainly want to safeguard the interest of the members  to\r\n\r\nensure  that it does not just allow the employer to prolong  the\r\n\r\nprocess and, at the end of the day, there is nothing to claim on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of  the  employees.   I  think  that  would  be  a  very\r\n\r\nundesirable situation.  While we are sympathetic, we  also  have\r\n\r\nto remember that our first responsibility is really to safeguard\r\n\r\nthe interest of the CPF members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo has asked whether there could be a tax deduction\r\n\r\nto  encourage  more people to contribute voluntarily.   Firstly,\r\n\r\nlet me point out that most employed Singaporeans actually do not\r\n\r\npay  income  tax  already.   I think nearly  about  70%  of  the\r\n\r\nemployed  Singaporeans do not pay any personal income tax.   So,\r\n\r\nincome tax may\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  be  that effective as an incentive.  Voluntary contribution\r\n\r\nis  targeted at a group of people who are not working either  as\r\n\r\nan employee or as a self-employed.  They do not have any taxable\r\n\r\nincome.  So tax incentive is also not applicable in this  sense.\r\n\r\nVoluntary contribution is a totally free choice on the part of a\r\n\r\nSingaporean who wants to put some money aside for his  old  age,\r\n\r\nand who looks at the CPF as a very safe long-term investment, as\r\n\r\na  very secure place where he can put aside his old age savings,\r\n\r\nknowing that the interests are guaranteed and that, in fact,  if\r\n\r\nhe  puts  the  money in the Special Account,  he  would  earn  a\r\n\r\npremium interest of 1\ufffd% above the normal CPF interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which Dr Vasoo raised was, if I got it\r\n\r\ncorrectly,  what  else would the Board do  to  help  members  to\r\n\r\nincrease  their  old-age savings.  This  move  to  increase  the\r\n\r\ninterest  that  is  being paid for the balance  in  the  Special\r\n\r\nAccount is one such effort on the part of the Board.  By  paying\r\n\r\n1\ufffd%   interest  over and above the interest in the Ordinary  and\r\n\r\nMedisave Accounts, it will in fact help many members to save  up\r\n\r\nmuch more money in the Special Account for their old age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam and Dr Vasoo also mentioned the same point about\r\n\r\nirreversibility or irrevocable decision to transfer  money  from\r\n\r\nthe Ordinary Account into the Special Accounts.  Members have to\r\n\r\nunderstand  that the Special Account represents  very  long-term\r\n\r\nsavings.  A CPF member cannot withdraw the money in the  Special\r\n\r\nAccount  until  he reaches the age of 55.  So  he  is  making  a\r\n\r\ncommitment to leave this money for a fairly long term, which  is\r\n\r\nwhy  the  Government can guarantee that we will pay 1\ufffd% interest\r\n\r\nabove  the  normal interest rate.  The normal interest  rate  is\r\n\r\ncalculated  on the basis of an average interest rate  of  banks'\r\n\r\nsavings  accounts  and one year term deposit accounts.   So  CPF\r\n\r\nmembers  are  getting higher interest than  what  they  normally\r\n\r\nwould  get  if  they place their savings in a bank.   We  cannot\r\n\r\nallow  a situation where people transfer money from the Ordinary\r\n\r\nAccount into the Special Account and then transfer it out as and\r\n\r\nwhen they need it, ie, earn the extra interest and then take  it\r\n\r\nout.  That would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndefeat  the  whole purpose and the basis on which the  long-term\r\n\r\ninterest rate has been calculated to offer this additional 1\ufffd%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members must remember that the Ordinary Account is actually\r\n\r\nmoney  available  on  demand for most CPF members.   It  is  not\r\n\r\nlocked  up  to the age of 55.  A CPF member uses the savings  in\r\n\r\nhis  Ordinary Account to pay his home mortgage as  and  when  he\r\n\r\nneeds  it.  He can use his Medisave to meet his medical expenses\r\n\r\nas  and when he needs it.  He can even draw the savings from his\r\n\r\nOrdinary  Account to invest in shares.  He can take it  out  and\r\n\r\nput it into a bank as a fixed deposit if he thinks that the rate\r\n\r\nthere is better.  So there are many options for a CPF member  to\r\n\r\ndraw from his Ordinary Account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting the money in the Special Account is only one of the\r\n\r\noptions,  but  this  option carries with it certain  conditions.\r\n\r\nAnd  one  of the conditions is that a CPF member cannot withdraw\r\n\r\nit  at will until he reaches the age of 55.  I think we have  to\r\n\r\nkeep  it that way.  Otherwise, we lose the basis for paying  the\r\n\r\nadditional interest on the balance in the Special Account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam raised another point about different classes of\r\n\r\nmembers.    Yes,  I  think  different  classes  of  members  are\r\n\r\nnecessary because we have employees who are  CPF members.   They\r\n\r\ncontribute  20% plus 20%.  We have the self-employed people  who\r\n\r\nhave  to  make  mandatory  Medisave contribution  but  voluntary\r\n\r\ncontribution for the Ordinary Account or Special Account.  So we\r\n\r\nhave  totally voluntary contributors who can contribute  as  and\r\n\r\nwhen  they  want  and with whatever amount that  they  want  to.\r\n\r\nThere is no minimum contribution that they must comply with.  So\r\n\r\nwe need to create these different classes of members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His other point is about people who contribute to CPF for\r\n\r\nother  reasons  to take advantage of income tax.   Today,  self-employed people can already make voluntary contribution.   They,\r\n\r\nof course, have to make mandatory contribution to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  Medisave accounts.  But the self-employed already  enjoys\r\n\r\ntax benefit from the CPF contribution up to 20% of his income or $14,400  per annum, whichever is the lower.  So there is already\r\n\r\na  provision  and,  in fact, it is an incentive  for  the  self-employed to make CPF contributions and to enjoy the tax  benefit\r\n\r\nwhich  all employees enjoy.  And we should also not discriminate\r\n\r\nagainst  the higher income people for wanting to put some  money\r\n\r\ninto  their CPF accounts, because Members have to remember  that\r\n\r\neven the highest income employee also makes CPF contributions of\r\n\r\na  portion  of  his salary, ie, up to $6,000.  A person  may  be\r\n\r\nearning tens of thousands of dollars but he also contributes CPF\r\n\r\nup to a maximum of $6,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Per month?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Per month. $6,000 of his salary per\r\n\r\nmonth.   This is already allowed.  So we should not deny anybody\r\n\r\nwho wants to make voluntary contribution into a newly opened CPF\r\n\r\naccount  to put aside some money for his old age.  I  think,  on\r\n\r\nbalance, we should allow and welcome voluntary contributions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill.

I announced several tax concessions and other measures to\r\n\r\nhelp  ease business costs during this economic slowdown, and  to\r\n\r\nhelp  local businesses obtain working capital in a situation  of\r\n\r\ntight liquidity.   I also said that the Government would monitor\r\n\r\nthe  state  of the economy closely and stood ready to  implement\r\n\r\nappropriate  off-budget  measures  if  the  economy  slows  down\r\n\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, the external economic environment has\r\n\r\ndeteriorated significantly.  The US and the EU are still growing\r\n\r\nrobustly,  but Japan has slipped into recession.   Closer  home,\r\n\r\nthe  regional  economic outlook has also  worsened.   After  the\r\n\r\nchange  of  government in May, Indonesia  is  now  undergoing  a\r\n\r\ndifficult   process   of  political  transition   and   economic\r\n\r\nreconstruction.   The negative growth rates  registered  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst quarter of 1998 in Malaysia, Hong Kong and South Korea are\r\n\r\nindications of tougher times for Asian economies in  the  months\r\n\r\nahead.  The weakening Yen has also led to fears of another round\r\n\r\nof  currency contagion.  Regional currencies have therefore come\r\n\r\nunder pressure.   The prospects are for continued turbulence and\r\n\r\nuncertainty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's financial and economic fundamentals are good.\r\n\r\nBut   this  deteriorating  external  environment  has  adversely\r\n\r\naffected  us.   This is inevitable, given the  openness  of  our\r\n\r\neconomy  and  our  close linkages with the region.   The  latest\r\n\r\nfigures  confirm  that growth momentum in Singapore  has  indeed\r\n\r\nslowed significantly.  GDP growth moderated to 5.9% in the first\r\n\r\nquarter  of 1998, from 7.8% in 1997.  MTI's preliminary estimate\r\n\r\nfor  the second quarter, based on figures for April and May,  is\r\n\r\nthat  growth  has  slowed further to 1.9%, with  the  seasonally\r\n\r\nadjusted annualised figure at 0.2%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing sector has slowed down, due to weaker\r\n\r\nglobal demand and the regional economic crisis.  The outlook for\r\n\r\nthe  worldwide  electronics industry has turned  less  sanguine.\r\n\r\nProducers  are  cautious  about demand  and  wary  about  rising\r\n\r\ninventories.   The commerce sector continues to be  affected  by\r\n\r\nthe decline in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade,  slower tourist arrivals  and  weaker  domestic\r\n\r\nconsumer spending.  This has in turn affected the transport  and\r\n\r\ncommunications sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial services sector has also slowed considerably\r\n\r\nas  activity  in  the Asian Dollar Market and  foreign  exchange\r\n\r\nmarket  remains  weak,  and domestic bank lending  continues  to\r\n\r\nslacken.   The  construction sector is still  supported  by  the\r\n\r\nhealthy  pipeline  of  major  public sector  projects,  although\r\n\r\nprivate construction activity has slowed down drastically.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Composite Leading Index, which leads economic activity\r\n\r\nby  about three quarters, has continued to fall since the fourth\r\n\r\nquarter of 1997.  The latest survey of business expectations  in\r\n\r\nMarch  1998  also showed that the outlook for most  sectors  had\r\n\r\ndeteriorated, especially the commerce and services sectors which\r\n\r\nare more exposed to the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade figures confirm the growth estimates. Our trade\r\n\r\nperformance has been weak. Non-oil domestic exports in  the  two\r\n\r\nmonths  of  April and May fell by 3.2% compared to a  year  ago.\r\n\r\nElectronics exports contracted by 4.8%, while non-oil re-exports\r\n\r\nfell by 2.4% due to a reduction in regional demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the pessimistic external environment and domestic\r\n\r\nsentiments,  MTI expects economic growth in the second  half  of\r\n\r\nthe year to remain very weak, and possibly even become negative.\r\n\r\nHowever, for the full year of 1998, we should still see positive\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI's previous GDP growth forecast of 2.5% to 4.5% for 1998\r\n\r\nwas  made  in  February  this  year.   After  factoring  in  the\r\n\r\nsubstantial  regional developments that have arisen since  then,\r\n\r\nas   well   as   possible  future  downsides  in  the   external\r\n\r\nenvironment,  MTI  has revised this forecast down,  to  0.5%  to\r\n\r\n1.5%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Additional measures</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax and budgetary measures announced in my FY98 Budget\r\n\r\nStatement  were  based  on  the economic  outlook  in  February,\r\n\r\nagainst  a  volatile  regional setting.   Rather  than  reacting\r\n\r\nprematurely, the Government decided first to watch\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhow  external  events would unfold, and ascertain the  pace  and\r\n\r\nextent of the economic slowdown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that developments are clearer, and we have revised our\r\n\r\ngrowth  forecast downwards, we are ready to act to mitigate  the\r\n\r\nimpact  of the regional troubles on our economy.  The Government\r\n\r\nhas  therefore  decided  to implement a  package  of  additional\r\n\r\nmeasures  worth a total of $2 billion to cut business costs  and\r\n\r\nstimulate the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In carrying out this package of additional measures, we\r\n\r\nshould  recognize that the primary cause of Singapore's  current\r\n\r\neconomic  slowdown  is  the  sharp  fall  in  external   demand,\r\n\r\nespecially regional demand. It is not domestic problems inherent\r\n\r\nin our own economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in contrast to the 1985/86 recession where the\r\n\r\nprimary  cause was the loss of competitiveness of the  Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy.   In  particular,  in  the  early  1980s,  labour  cost\r\n\r\nincreases  had exceeded productivity growth significantly.    As\r\n\r\nthese  were internal problems, we could rectify them swiftly  by\r\n\r\nchanging policies and making our own adjustments.  Together with\r\n\r\nthe  quick recovery of global demand, the Singapore economy  was\r\n\r\nable to bounce back within one year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, our export competitiveness position has not been\r\n\r\ntoo  adversely  affected, although we cannot be  complacent  and\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  monitor the situation for specific sectors.  Our\r\n\r\nunit  labour cost and unit business cost have been stable. While\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  dollar  has  indeed  appreciated  substantially\r\n\r\nagainst  the  baht, ringgit, rupiah, and won, it has depreciated\r\n\r\nagainst most OECD currencies. On a trade weighted basket  basis,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore dollar has appreciated only slightly. Furthermore\r\n\r\nour  inflation  has been low, whereas several of these  regional\r\n\r\ncountries are suffering from high inflation and cost of  capital\r\n\r\nas a result of their weaker currencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems we face this time are largely outside our\r\n\r\ncontrol.    We  cannot  change  the  external  environment,   or\r\n\r\ndetermine the course of events in the region.  However,  we  can\r\n\r\ncushion the fallout from the regional economic slowdown  on  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  economy.   We  should also  use  the  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nconsolidate  our strengths and further enhance our capabilities.\r\n\r\nIn  this  respect, the package (Cols. 359 - 360)  of  additional\r\n\r\nbudget  measures  has three broad objectives  :  (i)  to  reduce\r\n\r\nbusiness  costs;  (ii)  to  build  economic  infrastructure  and\r\n\r\ncapabilities;  and (iii) to help stabilize specific  sectors  of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1998/19980629/19980629-HA-0690359.htm\">Package - OFF-BUDGET PACKAGE (Cols. 359 - 360)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Land - Rentals and Charges</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our limited land resource, land-related costs like\r\n\r\nrentals are a significant proportion of business cost.  To  help\r\n\r\nease   the   pressures  of  land-related  business  costs,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will implement the following measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Additional Property Tax Rebate</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in addition to the 15% property tax rebate which was\r\n\r\nannounced during the FY98 Budget Statement, the Government  will\r\n\r\ngrant  an  additional 40% property tax rebate on commercial  and\r\n\r\nindustrial properties for the year commencing 1st July 1998  for\r\n\r\na  total  of 55%.  The additional revenue loss to Government  is\r\n\r\nestimated at $400 million.  HDB and JTC will pass on all of this\r\n\r\nrebate  to  their tenants and lessees.  Likewise, the Government\r\n\r\nstrongly urges private sector landlords to pass on at least half\r\n\r\nof this rebate to their tenants.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rental rebates by JTC & HDB</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, JTC and HDB will increase the rental concessions to\r\n\r\ntheir tenants and lessees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of JTC's continuing efforts to adjust its rents to\r\n\r\nvarying  market conditions, JTC will reduce its posted rents  by\r\n\r\nup  to  12%.   This  will benefit new tenants  and  those  whose\r\n\r\ntenancies come up for renewal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, JTC will also grant enhanced rental rebates of\r\n\r\nup  to  20%,  depending on how far the existing rents  are  from\r\n\r\nJTC's  posted  rents.  About three quarters of JTC  tenants  and\r\n\r\nlessees,  who are currently paying more than 80% of  the  posted\r\n\r\nrent,  will enjoy the full reduction of 20%.  Those paying  less\r\n\r\nthan  30%  of  posted rent, about 2% of the total,  will  get  a\r\n\r\nfreeze in rents.  The rest of the tenants and lessees will enjoy\r\n\r\npro-rated   net  reductions.  These  measures  supersede   those\r\n\r\nannounced at the FY98 Budget, and are estimated to cost  JTC  an\r\n\r\nadditional $200 million over a 12-month period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, HDB will reduce its posted rents in line with\r\n\r\nmarket rents.  For industrial properties, HDB revises its posted\r\n\r\nrents  every  quarter in line with the market.  It  has  already\r\n\r\nreduced posted rents by 10% in the first half of this year,  and\r\n\r\nwill  implement  a  further reduction of up to  5%  in  the  3rd\r\n\r\nquarter.  In addition, HDB will also grant a net rebate  on  its\r\n\r\nindustrial  land leases of up to 20%.  Tenants of HDB industrial\r\n\r\nand commercial space will enjoy a flat 10% rebate on their gross\r\n\r\nrents.  These rebates are estimated to cost about $80 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC and HDB will be releasing more details on these\r\n\r\nadditional concessions shortly.\r\n\r\nRental rebates by Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS)\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAAS will also extend a 15% rebate on the rentals for its\r\n\r\noffice,  warehouse and retail tenants for 12 months with  effect\r\n\r\nfrom  1st  July  1998.  In addition, it will continue  with  the\r\n\r\nrebate  on airport concession fees which was given in the  first\r\n\r\nhalf  of 1998.  These additional measures are estimated to  cost\r\n\r\nCAAS $54 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Labour Costs</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labour costs form a significant proportion of business cost\r\n\r\nin Singapore.   Appropriate wage restraint will be a key measure\r\n\r\nto  keep  labour costs down.  The priority must  be  to  protect\r\n\r\njobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cutting wage costs was also a key response during the 1985\r\n\r\nrecession.   However, at that time our wage system\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwas  too rigid.  To trim wage costs, we had no choice but to cut\r\n\r\nthe  employers' CPF contribution rate.  After the recession,  we\r\n\r\nset  up the flexible wage system.  Over the years, we have built\r\n\r\nup a variable component of wages which can serve as a buffer and\r\n\r\nbe  reduced during difficult times.  Today, in the civil service\r\n\r\nthe  variable  component has increased to  over  20%  of  annual\r\n\r\nwages,  while the corresponding figure in the private sector  is\r\n\r\nabout 16%.  This sizeable variable wage component will provide a\r\n\r\nuseful  first  line  of defence to reduce wage  costs.   As  the\r\n\r\nNational  Wages  Council has pointed out, wage restraint  is  an\r\n\r\nintegral part of our response to the current problems, for  both\r\n\r\nthe private and public sectors.  The civil service will take the\r\n\r\nlead in this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February, the Government announced a freeze on salaries\r\n\r\nof  Ministers and senior civil servants this year.  In line with\r\n\r\nNWC recommendations, the civil service also reduced the mid-year\r\n\r\nportion of the Annual Variable Component (AVC) to \ufffd month,  from\r\n\r\nthe  usual  _ month.  At the same time, the Government indicated\r\n\r\nthat  the  end-of-year AVC would be reviewed when  the  economic\r\n\r\nsituation and outlook became clearer. The deteriorating  outlook\r\n\r\nhas made it more probable that we will have to reduce the end-of-year  AVC.   We will decide on the actual adjustment nearer  the\r\n\r\nend  of  the  year, taking into account the economic  conditions\r\n\r\nprevailing at that time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wage restraint will complement Government's ongoing efforts\r\n\r\nand  new  initiatives  for  worker training,  job  matching  and\r\n\r\nupgrading  the  employability  of  Singaporean  workers.   These\r\n\r\ninclude   the  Education  Training  Fund  and  various  manpower\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and  training  initiatives  under  EDB's   Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Assistance Scheme (EDAS).  Recently, the  Government\r\n\r\nand  SDF  contributed  $50 million each  to  expand  the  Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment  Programme  (SRP).   The  SRP  provides   training\r\n\r\ncourses  to raise the employability of less educated  and  older\r\n\r\nworkers by equipping them with certifiable skills, so that  they\r\n\r\ncan find suitable employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will extend an additional $20 million grant\r\n\r\nto  expand  the training facilities and capacity to support  the\r\n\r\nSRP.  This includes establishing a new Skills Development Centre\r\n\r\nto  cater to growing demand for training places, and expand  the\r\n\r\nrange  of  courses  through  the  Singapore  National  Employers\r\n\r\nFederation  and  the  network  of  industry  associations.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Manpower will be announcing further  details  when\r\n\r\nthey are finalised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Costs of Capital</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The availability and cost of capital to support business\r\n\r\nactivities  are  a  third  area of concern  amongst  businessmen\r\n\r\nduring  this period of uncertainty.  Interest rates have  indeed\r\n\r\nrisen in recent months, but this is largely a reflection of  the\r\n\r\nrising  risk  premium  in Asia.  In fact,  Singapore's  interest\r\n\r\nrates remain relatively low, compared to other countries in Asia\r\n\r\nwith perhaps the exception of Japan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been calls from the public for the Government to\r\n\r\nreduce  interest  rates  and  to  encourage  banks  to  be  more\r\n\r\nforthcoming in their lending.  However, the scope for doing this\r\n\r\nis  very  limited.  Given the openness of our financial  system,\r\n\r\nMAS  can  only manage the exchange rate.  The level of  interest\r\n\r\nrates  is  set by market forces based on foreign interest  rates\r\n\r\nand  market  expectation of the movement of our  exchange  rate.\r\n\r\nFor  individual  loans, banks set the interest  rates  based  on\r\n\r\ntheir cost of funds and their assessment of the credit risks  of\r\n\r\nindividual borrowers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the MAS were to start pumping in liquidity to bring down\r\n\r\ninterest  rates,  foreign  investors  would  move  out  of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollar.  And then, we will end up  with  even  higher\r\n\r\ninterest  rates because investors will start demanding a  higher\r\n\r\npremium  to hold Singapore dollar deposits.  The banks would  in\r\n\r\nturn  have  to raise their lending rates because their  cost  of\r\n\r\nfunds would have gone up.  So it is better for interest rates to\r\n\r\nbe determined by the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither can Government instruct the banks to extend loans\r\n\r\nto  companies.  These are commercial decisions which  the  banks\r\n\r\nthemselves have to take.  The Government is not in a position to\r\n\r\nsecond guess their judgments, or to take responsibility for  the\r\n\r\nconsequences if the loans turn bad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what the Government can do to help local\r\n\r\nbusinesses  continue to have sufficient working  capital  is  to\r\n\r\nprovide  support  through the Local Enterprise Financing  Scheme\r\n\r\n(LEFS).  Under this scheme, banks undertake the necessary credit\r\n\r\nassessment, while the Government co-shares the risks with  them.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a practical way to help local enterprises address  the\r\n\r\nproblem of credit availability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the FY98 Budget the Government enhanced the LEFS scheme,\r\n\r\nto increase the loan line to $1.1 billion. We also increased the\r\n\r\nco-sharing of risks by Government and the maximum loan quantums,\r\n\r\nand  extended  the scheme to cover more local enterprises.   The\r\n\r\nresponse   so  far  to  the  enhanced  LEFS  scheme   has   been\r\n\r\nencouraging.   The Government will now increase  the  LEFS  loan\r\n\r\nline  further, to $2 billion and more if necessary. We will also\r\n\r\nstudy  further enhancements to the scheme to respond to  changes\r\n\r\nin the credit situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Services Charges</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fees and service charges are a fourth area of business\r\n\r\ncosts containment which Government will address.\r\n\r\nSuspension of Parking Surcharge Scheme\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a surcharge of $60 per lot per month is levied\r\n\r\non all non-residential car parks with at least 5 parking lots in\r\n\r\nand  around the Restricted Zone (RZ).  The surcharge supplements\r\n\r\nthe  Area  Licensing  Scheme (ALS) as  a  road  usage  restraint\r\n\r\nmeasure to keep traffic free flowing within the CBD.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retailers have been asking the Government to suspend\r\n\r\nthis Parking Surcharge Scheme for some time.  We were unable  to\r\n\r\ndo  so  earlier  because  the Parking Surcharge  Scheme  was  an\r\n\r\nimportant  component  of  the total  traffic  management  system\r\n\r\nwithin the CBD.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nElectronic Road Pricing (ERP) scheme will be a more flexible and\r\n\r\neffective  way to control traffic congestion. With the extension\r\n\r\nof  the ERP to the Restricted Zone from 1st September 1998,  the\r\n\r\nLand  Transport Authority (LTA) will be suspending  the  Parking\r\n\r\nSurcharge Scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suspension will benefit the owners of car parks\r\n\r\ncurrently under surcharge.  The Government urges these owners to\r\n\r\npass  on  their savings in the form of lower parking charges  to\r\n\r\nbenefit  their tenants, retailers, and motorists who  use  their\r\n\r\ncar  parks.   This measure is estimated to cost  $37  million  a\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retailers in the CBD have also requested that ALS hours be\r\n\r\nshortened on Saturdays to encourage shoppers to drive  into  the\r\n\r\nCBD.   With the implementation of the ERP for the CBD,  the  LTA\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to make this adjustment as well. The Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunications  will release the details in a few  weeks'  time,\r\n\r\nwhen it announces full details of the new ERP charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Port-Related Tariffs</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to market conditions and customer requirements\r\n\r\non  an  on-going  basis, PSA Corporation  has  already  extended\r\n\r\nvarious rebates to its shipping customers through its customised\r\n\r\nagreements.   Similarly,  it  has  reduced  its  distripark  and\r\n\r\nwarehouse rentals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For shippers who use Jurong Port, JTC will also offer a 20%\r\n\r\nrebate  on  Jurong Port tariffs with effect from 1st July  1998.\r\n\r\nThis is estimated to save $20 million for some 1,000 companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Telecommunications Tariffs</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, as part of its regular schedule of tariff\r\n\r\nreductions, Singapore Telecoms has informed the Government  that\r\n\r\nit will be offering further rate reductions on its International\r\n\r\nDirect   Dialling,  Subscriber  Trunk  Dialling,  Local   Leased\r\n\r\nCircuit,  International Leased Circuit, and Frame Relay services\r\n\r\nbeginning  the  second  half of this year.   These  changes  are\r\n\r\nexpected to result in customer savings totalling $100 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Electricity Tariffs</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since corporatisation, Singapore Power has made substantial\r\n\r\nproductivity  gains,  reducing  costs  and  improving  financial\r\n\r\nreturns.  It  will give a one-off 3.5% rebate  on  the  non-fuel\r\n\r\ncomponent of electricity tariff for 1 year with effect from  1st\r\n\r\nJuly  1998.   This is equivalent to a 2.6% reduction in  average\r\n\r\nelectricity tariff and is estimated to result in cost savings of\r\n\r\nabout  $81  million  for all users.  This is separate  from  any\r\n\r\nadjustments  which  will  be  made  on  the  fuel  component  of\r\n\r\nelectricity  tariffs in line with movements in fuel  cost  every\r\n\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Water Tariffs</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will not hold back or reduce the PUB water\r\n\r\ntariff  increases for households, scheduled for  1st  July.  The\r\n\r\nincreases are a long term strategic move to get water tariffs to\r\n\r\nreflect  the true scarcity value of water in Singapore,  and  to\r\n\r\nmake   Singaporeans  conscious  of  the  vital   importance   of\r\n\r\nconserving water.  The increases will not cause any hardship  to\r\n\r\nlower income households, as they will be fully offset by the PUB\r\n\r\nrebates and service and conservancy charge grants for the HDB 1-4 room flat dwellers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Economic Infrastructure/Capabilities Building</i>\r\n\r\n<br><i>Public Sector Projects</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the open nature of our economy, it is difficult to\r\n\r\nstimulate  domestic economic activity through  pump  priming  or\r\n\r\nboosting consumption.  However, even as we seek to reduce  costs\r\n\r\nto  maintain our competitiveness, there are projects  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  undertake  which  contribute  to  building  our\r\n\r\neconomic infrastructure and enhancing our capabilities  for  the\r\n\r\nlonger  term.  To put in place such economic infrastructure  and\r\n\r\ncapabilities for the future, Government will speed up several on-going  public sector infra-structure projects as well  as  bring\r\n\r\nforward  suitable new development projects.  In total, close  to\r\n\r\n$1.9  billion  worth  of  new  development  projects  have  been\r\n\r\napproved.   Together with the on-going projects  which  will  be\r\n\r\nspeeded  up,  it  will  result in an estimated  additional  $670\r\n\r\nmillion in new disbursements in FY98 alone.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education will continue to be the key focus, accounting for\r\n\r\nover  40% of the newly approved projects.  Human talent  remains\r\n\r\nour  most  precious resource and we want to develop  it  to  the\r\n\r\nmaximum.   Major  projects  brought  forward  will  include  the\r\n\r\nexpansion  of our Primary School Building Programme to  increase\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  Primary schools to be built in new  and  mature\r\n\r\ntowns  from  18 to 27; the incorporation of IT into Primary  and\r\n\r\nSecondary Schools under construction; upgrading of NUS and  NTU;\r\n\r\nand  enhanced computer facilities at our polytechnics.  MOE will\r\n\r\nalso   expand   its  recruitment  of  teachers  to   raise   the\r\n\r\neffectiveness of the education system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic infrastructure will be the other area of focus.\r\n\r\nKey projects include increased investment for commercial rollout\r\n\r\nof  Singapore One; Jurong Island development; and development of\r\n\r\nindustrial  land.   We  will also provide additional  funds  for\r\n\r\nEDB's  Economic  Development Assistance Scheme Phase  III  which\r\n\r\nprovides  loans  and grants support for companies  and  manpower\r\n\r\ninitiatives,  and for TDB to undertake more trade promotion  and\r\n\r\nfacilitation work.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Measures For Specific Sectors</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from cost reduction and infrastructure enhancement\r\n\r\nmeasures, the Government will adopt several specific measures to\r\n\r\nhelp  stabilise and strengthen certain sectors of  the  economy.\r\n\r\nThis  is  to ensure that such sectors, whose health affects  the\r\n\r\nrest of the economy, are not subject to severe stress.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Property Market</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property market is one area of particular concern. A\r\n\r\nweak property market can affect confidence and asset values, and\r\n\r\nalso have repercussions on the financial sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1997 and again during the FY98 Budget\r\n\r\nStatement,  Government  made  adjustments  to  its  land   sales\r\n\r\nprogramme, to avoid aggravating the excess supply in the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last review, the property market situation has\r\n\r\ncontinued  to  weaken.   To  help  stabilise  the  market,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will adopt the following additional measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will suspend sale of sites for private\r\n\r\nresidential,  executive condominiums and commercial  development\r\n\r\nfor the rest of 1998 and 1999, except for the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Sengkang site to tie in with the development of the\r\n\r\nMRT/LRT station and bus interchange in Sengkang New Town.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Clarke Quay MRT site to tie in with the development of\r\n\r\nthe North-East MRT line.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Four small infill sites within the Chinatown\r\n\r\nConservation Area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will resume selling a steady supply of\r\n\r\nland  when  the  property market recovers. We  will  review  the\r\n\r\nsituation  at the end of 1999 to decide whether to  resume  land\r\n\r\nsales in the year 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we will suspend the 5% per annum premium that is\r\n\r\ncurrently levied on developers of private residential properties\r\n\r\nfor  every year of extension of their Project Completion  Period\r\n\r\n(PCP).   Developers can now apply for extension of PCP up  to  8\r\n\r\nyears   without   penalty.   The  suspension   will   apply   to\r\n\r\napplications made before the end of 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we will allow the reassignment of government land\r\n\r\nsale  parcels, as a temporary measure, until the  end  of  1999.\r\n\r\nThis  will  allow consolidation within the property  development\r\n\r\nindustry,  as some successful tenderers may no longer  be  in  a\r\n\r\nfinancial position to complete the development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we will defer payment of stamp duty by purchasers\r\n\r\nof  uncompleted properties until TOP or time of subsequent sale,\r\n\r\nwhichever is earlier.  This will also apply to subsequent buyers\r\n\r\nof  an  uncompleted property. It will help to improve  the  cash\r\n\r\nflow  of  property  purchasers.  This is  a  refinement  of  the\r\n\r\nmeasure  introduced  during the May 1996  property  curbs.   The\r\n\r\nestimated revenue impact on Government is $85 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of National Development will be announcing\r\n\r\nmore details of these measures separately.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Financial Sector</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tax Deduction for Bank Provisions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the property market, another key area is our\r\n\r\nfinancial  sector.   Our banking system  is  strong  and  sound.\r\n\r\nHowever, to encourage banks to make adequate provisions for loan\r\n\r\nexposure to the region and to further promote stability  in  the\r\n\r\nbanking  sector, the Government has decided to lift the  current\r\n\r\n3%  limit on tax deduction for general provisions made by  banks\r\n\r\nand  merchant  banks for Year of Assessment 1999, provided  such\r\n\r\nprovisions  exceeding 3% are approved by the Monetary  Authority\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General provisions exceeding 3% will be brought to tax when\r\n\r\nthey are written back to the bank's Profit & Loss Account later.\r\n\r\nThe  tax rate to be applied will be the tax rate prevailing when\r\n\r\nthe provisions were made.  If at the end of 5 years, the general\r\n\r\nprovisions still exceed 3%, the provisions in excess of 3%  will\r\n\r\nbe  brought back to tax.  Again, the tax rate to apply  will  be\r\n\r\nthat prevailing at the time when the provisions were made.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Stamp Duty for Contract Notes</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Government has also decided to\r\n\r\nsuspend  the stamp duty on contract notes for share transactions\r\n\r\nfor  one  year,  with effect from 30th June 1998.   This  is  in\r\n\r\nrecognition   of  the  marked  weakness  in  the   stock-broking\r\n\r\nindustry.   Compared to the average monthly  turnover  in  1997,\r\n\r\nstock market turnover in the month of May 1998 declined by  over\r\n\r\n40% in value terms.  Consequently, earnings for stockbrokers  as\r\n\r\na group have also fallen sharply.  The immediate outlook for the\r\n\r\nindustry  also remains weak.  The suspension of stamp duty  will\r\n\r\nhelp  to lower transaction costs.  This measure is estimated  to\r\n\r\ncost the Government about $50 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Hotel Sector</i>\r\n\r\n<br><i>Refurbishment Of Hotels</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospitality sector has been one of the most severely\r\n\r\nhit.   Tourist arrivals have declined by about 17% in the  first\r\n\r\nfive  months  of  this year.  Hotel occupancy has  also  fallen.\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  give  a  tax  allowance  of  up  to  150%  for\r\n\r\nqualifying expenditure incurred in the refurbishment of  hotels,\r\n\r\nto  encourage  hotels to upgrade during this lull period.   This\r\n\r\nincentive is applicable for a period of 5 years and focused more\r\n\r\non hotels in the core zone.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole package of measures will inject an estimated $2\r\n\r\nbillion  into  the  economy.  Of this,  about  $1.6  billion  is\r\n\r\nexpected  to  affect  the  Budget balance  directly.   Based  on\r\n\r\nrevised  revenue and expenditure estimates, the introduction  of\r\n\r\nthe  package  will  result in a budget  deficit  of  about  $800\r\n\r\nmillion  for FY98.  The Government believes that this  level  of\r\n\r\nbudget  deficit, relative to the size of our economy  and  at  a\r\n\r\ndifficult  time  like this, is still in line  with  our  prudent\r\n\r\napproach towards fiscal policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a small open economy with extensive links to the region,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  generate  strong economic  growth  through  our  own\r\n\r\nactions, so long as the regional environment and external demand\r\n\r\nremains depressed.  Sustained resumption of economic growth  can\r\n\r\nonly  come  about  with the stabilisation and  recovery  of  the\r\n\r\nregional economies and increased global demand for the goods and\r\n\r\nservices we produce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must brace ourselves for slower economic growth during\r\n\r\nthe  next  few years of regional transition and recovery.   Some\r\n\r\nindustries  and companies will feel the fall in business  demand\r\n\r\nand profits more acutely than others.  Some may have to merge or\r\n\r\nrelocate.  Retrenchments will increase as businesses consolidate\r\n\r\nand  re-structure themselves.  This process will be painful  but\r\n\r\nwe  must  accept  it  as the only way to adapt  to  the  changed\r\n\r\neconomic conditions and resume growth again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to monitor the external and\r\n\r\ndomestic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomic situation closely and take additional suitable measures\r\n\r\nwhere necessary to maintain the framework for economic activity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more retrenchments this year, workers should have more\r\n\r\nrealistic  expectations,  accept  wage  restraint  and   retrain\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  acquire new capabilities and remain  employable.\r\n\r\nNew  jobs  are being created, but Singaporeans must acquire  the\r\n\r\nnecessary skills and knowledge to perform these jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their part, companies should streamline their\r\n\r\noperations,  improve  their  efficiency  and  productivity,  and\r\n\r\nupgrade  their  workers.   They too should  make  the  necessary\r\n\r\nadjustments  to  stay  the  course and  position  themselves  to\r\n\r\ncapitalise on the opportunities when the region recovers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional economic crisis poses us a formidable\r\n\r\nchallenge.    But  there  is  no  reason  to   be   daunted   or\r\n\r\ndisheartened.   Our  financial  and  economic  fundamentals  are\r\n\r\nsound. We do not suffer from the problems which beset some other\r\n\r\nregional countries.  Analysts and investors know this. To  quote\r\n\r\na   recent  report  by  SG  Securities  Research,  \"Overall  the\r\n\r\nSingapore economy will face a difficult environment but, like  a\r\n\r\nwell  maintained  ship with plenty of ballast,  state-of-the-art\r\n\r\nnavigational  facilities and a good crew, will  safely  navigate\r\n\r\nthe  choppy  waters  and not only stay afloat  but  slowly  move\r\n\r\nagainst  the  storm\".   By taking appropriate  measures  now  to\r\n\r\ncounter  the  adverse conditions, and to develop our  long  term\r\n\r\npotential,  we  will emerge more resilient and competitive  when\r\n\r\nthe region recovers.  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I like to take this\r\n\r\noccasion  to ask the Minister a few questions.  First,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  congratulate him for having presented a  comprehensive\r\n\r\nand  a  well-done  Off-Budget Budget.  Reading  his  speech,  it\r\n\r\nsounds  really like a Budget session to us.  And I  believe  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  put in a lot of thoughts by introducing  measures\r\n\r\nthat are able to stimulate the economy and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbring us back to a good footing.  I am particularly impressed by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister's coverage on how he intends to cut down corporate\r\n\r\nexpenses and costs.  In this respect, I like to congratulate the\r\n\r\nMinister  for having introduced many new cost-cutting  measures,\r\n\r\nespecially by JTC, HDB, CAAS and various other quarters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister a few questions. First,\r\n\r\non   the  proposed  property  tax  rebate  for  commercial   and\r\n\r\nindustrial properties, which is a very substantial 40%.  Why  is\r\n\r\nit that the Minister did not also include the residential sector\r\n\r\nas a component to enjoy this rebate?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister mentioned that for this entire Budget package,\r\n\r\nthere will be a negative budget of $800 million.  It seems to be\r\n\r\na  very prime pumping Budget.  May he explain whether this  $800\r\n\r\nmillion  negative is just for operating budget or does  it  also\r\n\r\ninclude the capital expenditure of the Government?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of interest rates, of course, the Minister\r\n\r\nexplained  that  the  Government cannot ask  banks  to  be  more\r\n\r\naccommodating.   But  I think the Government revenue  collection\r\n\r\nagencies  can  be  more accommodating.  In their  collection  of\r\n\r\nrates,  fees,  various  payments,  perhaps  the  Government  can\r\n\r\ninstruct  the  Government agencies like JTC, HDB, PSA  and  even\r\n\r\nIRAS  to be more accommodating.  Since times are difficult, many\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  individuals are facing difficulties  in  meeting\r\n\r\ncash flow requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that the Minister has come out with a\r\n\r\ngood  package  for  a  specific sector, which  is  the  property\r\n\r\nsector.   I  note that the measures are very well conceived  and\r\n\r\nwell  thought through.  Once again, we would like to appeal that\r\n\r\nthis  80-20%  payment between the bank and the individual  might\r\n\r\nalso be a point that the Minister would like to review, since it\r\n\r\nis an item that can help purchasers in their cash flow.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthey  can  use their CPF savings for that 20%.  This might  help\r\n\r\nthem  to  buy  properties,  especially for  first-time  property\r\n\r\npurchasers who may find that this is the time for them to  enter\r\n\r\nthe market if they are able to find the finances.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Leong, may I remind you that you are\r\n\r\nnot allowed to make a speech.  Please ask your questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Yes, I will ask two more questions, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask the Minister how come he did not consider the\r\n\r\nforeign worker levy and the foreign maid levy as components  for\r\n\r\ncost  cutting.  These are very heavy costs to the employers  and\r\n\r\nthey  have  to incur substantial costs to employ some  of  these\r\n\r\nforeign workers.  For families which employ foreign maids,  they\r\n\r\nalso can look for some form of relief for their households.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I note the Minister has not provided any\r\n\r\nparticular incentive for the individual.  Could he also  explain\r\n\r\nwhy in this case he has not considered giving, say,  an increase\r\n\r\nin  the tax relief from 5% to 10% that was given last year.   In\r\n\r\nthis  particular  package,  I  do  not  see  any  provision  for\r\n\r\nindividuals  to  improve  on their own cash  flow  and  increase\r\n\r\nspending, so as to help stimulate the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, like\r\n\r\nmy  colleague before me, I would like to thank the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  for the very comprehensive off-Budget measures.   I  am\r\n\r\nsure they will be welcomed by a lot of corporate business people\r\n\r\nas  well  as property developers.   But I would like to ask  why\r\n\r\nthe  Minister has not considered measures to stimulate  domestic\r\n\r\nconsumption, because I notice most of them are more cost cutting\r\n\r\nmeasures for companies.  There are not enough measures given  to\r\n\r\nthe individuals to put more disposable income into their pockets\r\n\r\nand  help to stimulate consumption.  For example, I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhether the Minister would like to consider giving more time  to\r\n\r\nthe  taxpayers to pay their income tax over a longer  period  of\r\n\r\ntime  and  also,  for example, the domestic and  foreign  worker\r\n\r\nlevies  could  perhaps be reduced, so that there  will  be  more\r\n\r\ndisposable income for people to spend.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of property purchase, the Minister may want to\r\n\r\ntake a look again at this 20% which is now to be paid for in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncash when one buys a property.  Perhaps the Minister may want to\r\n\r\nconsider allowing both CPF and cash to be used to help stimulate\r\n\r\nthe property market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is common\r\n\r\nknowledge  that the bank interest rates will affect the  ability\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans  to  service their loans  and  the  ability  of\r\n\r\nbusinesses  to stay afloat under the current economic situation.\r\n\r\nI  wonder  why the Government has not introduced any measure  to\r\n\r\ninfluence the banks to reduce interest rates so as to  ease  the\r\n\r\nburden of borrowers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I applaud\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance for some of the measures he  announced\r\n\r\ntoday.  I have a number of questions for him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the projection of our economic growth of 0.5-1.5%, has\r\n\r\nthe  $2  billion  package, which has just been  announced,  been\r\n\r\ntaken  into  account in the projection?  The $2 billion  package\r\n\r\nwould have some stimulative effect on the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the budget deficit of $800 million, I would like\r\n\r\nthe Minister to explain whether this will have a negative impact\r\n\r\non the Singapore dollar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my colleagues have already mentioned measures to\r\n\r\nstimulate consumption.  I hope the Minister would not  take  too\r\n\r\nsevere  a  stand on the Annual Variable Component (AVC),  ie,  a\r\n\r\nfurther substantial cut in the AVC which he intends to do if the\r\n\r\neconomy  worsens,  because this will  only  make  the  situation\r\n\r\nworse.  So I hope the Annual Variable Component will not be  cut\r\n\r\nsubstantially.  If we send a wrong message that the AVC will  be\r\n\r\ncut,  we will end up like the situation in Japan whereby a  one-off tax rebate had no effect on their economy at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have another question on interest rates. The Minister\r\n\r\nhas  mentioned  that  the Government has no  control  on  banks'\r\n\r\ncredit.  But,  unfortunately, there are many small  and  medium-sized  companies today which are actually facing a credit crunch\r\n\r\nfrom   banks,   all   because  bankers  are  afraid   to   lend.\r\n\r\nIrrespective of whether the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompanies are good or bad, banks take a very blunt approach  and\r\n\r\nI  think the Minister should address this issue to see how  this\r\n\r\ncredit  crunch  can be eased for many of the small  and  medium-sized companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Minister said that we have no control on\r\n\r\ninterest  rates and yet just a few days ago, the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia, at the UMNO general assembly, indicated  that  the\r\n\r\neconomy  in Malaysia would have a speedier recovery if  interest\r\n\r\nrates  in Singapore were reduced.  It was reported in the  press\r\n\r\nthat he said, \"If interest rates rise, there would be an outflow\r\n\r\nof  money  from this country [meaning Malaysia].\"  Sir,  if  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister of Malaysia says that, should we not be  a  good\r\n\r\nneighbour and find ways to reduce interest rates?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister mentioned\r\n\r\nthat  the new forecast for this year will be 0.5%-1.5%.   If  we\r\n\r\nassume  a  productivity growth of 2% and the workforce expansion\r\n\r\nof  1%,  it  means that the unemployment rate in Singapore  this\r\n\r\nyear is likely to reach between 3-5%.  Next year, if we continue\r\n\r\nto  grow at a slower pace of about 1%, then it is possible  that\r\n\r\nunemployment may reach as high as 5-7% by the end of next  year.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to ask the Minister in what way  the  off-Budget\r\n\r\nmeasures  will help us not just to contain the slowdown  on  the\r\n\r\nloss  of  jobs  today but, more importantly, contribute  to  the\r\n\r\nspeeding  up  of the creation of new jobs in 1998 and  1999,  so\r\n\r\nthat,  hopefully, unemployment would not get out of  control  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Hu, would you like to give your answers to\r\n\r\nthe questions raised?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, I will answer the questions in\r\n\r\nturn.   Mr Leong Horn Kee asked why the property tax rebate  has\r\n\r\nnot been extended to the private residential sector.  The answer\r\n\r\nis  fairly  straightforward.  The private residential sector  is\r\n\r\nalready  paying very low property tax of 4%.  In addition,  with\r\n\r\nthe GST rebates introduced over the last few years and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nother  offsets,  about  70% of the population  of  Singapore  no\r\n\r\nlonger pay property tax, particularly the HDB sector.  So  there\r\n\r\nis really little reason to give them further rebates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to know why the Government should not be more\r\n\r\naccommodative on interest rates and fees charged.  I  think  the\r\n\r\nimpact  of interest rates on fee collections is that the amounts\r\n\r\nare  so  small  and  I do not think it is going  to  affect  the\r\n\r\neconomy  very  much.  But I will ask our officials  to  be  more\r\n\r\nreasonable in pressing people who find difficulty in  paying  on\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked why we have not reduced the amount of\r\n\r\ncash  required to purchase properties from 80% to 70%.  We  have\r\n\r\nsaid  many  times that this is undesirable.  The last  thing  we\r\n\r\nwant  to do in a situation of an economic downturn is to  induce\r\n\r\npeople to increase their debt liabilities which, if uncontrolled\r\n\r\nand  later if they should lose their jobs, would have  a  severe\r\n\r\nrepercussion not only on the individual but on the  banks  which\r\n\r\nlend such money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also wants to know why we have not cut the foreign\r\n\r\nworker  levy.   This was explained in the earlier  question  and\r\n\r\nanswer  session because a reduction of foreign worker levy  will\r\n\r\nmerely  induce  companies to increase their  intake  of  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers which we do not want at this point of time.  In the case\r\n\r\nof  the domestic maid levy, even at the current rate, demand has\r\n\r\nnot  slackened.   So  a cut at this time would  merely  increase\r\n\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had anticipated the question why nothing has been done\r\n\r\nfor  the  individual.  I would like to remind him that I started\r\n\r\noff by saying that the package of measures we are introducing is\r\n\r\nfocused entirely, in this present case, on getting companies  to\r\n\r\nbe  viable.  Our main objective is to reduce costs so that  they\r\n\r\ncan   remain   in   business  and  ensure  employment.    Giving\r\n\r\nconcessions  to individuals to stimulate the economy  will  have\r\n\r\nvery  marginal  value  at  this point  of  time.   For  example,\r\n\r\nincreased private consumption is not going to help companies  in\r\n\r\nthe  export sector.  Our priority is to help the businesses stay\r\n\r\nviable so that they can preserve jobs for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also answers the question raised by Mr Lew Syn Pau on\r\n\r\nwhy  we have done nothing for the individual.  I would point out\r\n\r\nthat  we have, in fact, done something for the individual in  my\r\n\r\nearlier  Budget  in  March where we gave 5% rebate  on  personal\r\n\r\nincome  tax and rebates on HDB rents and S&C charges.   For  the\r\n\r\ntime  being,  we do not consider it necessary to increase  these\r\n\r\nrebates  because  its  effect on domestic  consumption  will  be\r\n\r\nmarginal in helping us recover from our present dilemma.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew also asked about the domestic maid levy and the\r\n\r\nanswer is what I have just said to Mr Leong.  On the use of  CPF\r\n\r\nfor  housing,  we do not want to increase the individual's  debt\r\n\r\nburden this time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has asked why Government is not doing\r\n\r\nanything  to reduce interest rates.  I will answer this question\r\n\r\ntogether with the question raised by Mr Chng Hee Kok on interest\r\n\r\nrates in general.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Swee Say has asked what Government is going to do to\r\n\r\nstimulate  the  recovery  so as not  to  allow  unemployment  to\r\n\r\nincrease.  There are several ways we have proposed to  do  this.\r\n\r\nFirstly,   by   reducing  business  costs.   This   will   allow\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  which  may face difficulties  keeping  their  staff\r\n\r\nbecause  they  are  unprofitable,  to  remain  in  business  and\r\n\r\ntherefore   protecting   jobs.    Our   investments    in    new\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  are also to ensure that we continue  to  attract\r\n\r\nforeign  investments.  And we have large programmes through  the\r\n\r\nEDB  to  co-invest in new ventures and EDB is actively  scouring\r\n\r\nthe  world  for new investments.  And through the generation  of\r\n\r\nnew types of industries, particularly high-tech ones, we hope to\r\n\r\nprotect future jobs or generate new jobs for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok has asked whether the $800 million deficit\r\n\r\nwill  affect  the  Singapore dollar.  I would hardly  think  so,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have  very large reserves.  As Members  know,  $800\r\n\r\nmillion  deficit is a small percentage of our total  GDP  and  I\r\n\r\ndoubt it will have any influence at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked why there have been complaints from the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Prime\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinister  and  from  the  Malaysian media  in  general  on  high\r\n\r\ninterest  rates  for ringgit in Singapore.  The  problem  arises\r\n\r\nfrom  a  misunderstanding of the nature  of  interest  rates  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  Malaysian media have reported  that  Singapore\r\n\r\nbanks  are  offering  very high interest  rates  which  tend  to\r\n\r\nattract  the  outflow  of  ringgit  into  Singapore,  therefore,\r\n\r\nreducing the liquidity in Malaysia and affecting their business.\r\n\r\nSome even suggest that this might be a deliberate attempt by the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government to damage the Malaysian economy.   I  would\r\n\r\nsay categorically that this is not the case. We have to remember\r\n\r\nthat Malaysia is Singapore's second largest trading partner, and\r\n\r\nSingapore is also one of the largest investors in Malaysia.   So\r\n\r\nthe  continuing  welfare of the Malaysian economy  is  of  vital\r\n\r\ninterest  to Singapore.  It is not in our interest  to  try  and\r\n\r\nundermine their economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS has also earlier issued a statement that it does\r\n\r\nnot regulate or influence the interest rates of bank deposits in\r\n\r\nSingapore, whether the money is in Singapore dollars or  in  any\r\n\r\nother  foreign currencies.  Although it has been said before,  I\r\n\r\nthink at this point of time it will be useful if I elaborate  on\r\n\r\nthe principles which have been announced earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks in Singapore are free to set interest rates on\r\n\r\ndeposits  in  a  wide range of foreign currencies.    Currently,\r\n\r\ndeposit  accounts for over 25 currencies are readily offered  in\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  Asian  Dollar  Market,  covering  all  the  G-7\r\n\r\ncountries'  currencies, and most Asian and European  currencies.\r\n\r\nInterest rates quoted for these deposits in these currencies are\r\n\r\nbased  on  market supply and demand.  Singapore  is  the  fourth\r\n\r\nlargest  foreign exchange trading centre in the world, following\r\n\r\nLondon,  New  York  and  Tokyo.  Of  necessity,  therefore,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  cannot  interfere in the foreign  exchange  markets.\r\n\r\nAll  currencies enter and leave Singapore freely,  depending  on\r\n\r\ndemand for such currencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent months, interest rates for off-shore Malaysian\r\n\r\nringgit  deposits have been very volatile, and have on  occasion\r\n\r\nrisen as high as 30% to 40%.  Such high\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninterest rates for the ringgit have naturally raised concerns in\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  but it should be emphasised that the high rates  were\r\n\r\ndetermined by market conditions and have always been  of  fairly\r\n\r\nshort duration.  In normal times, ringgit interest rates offered\r\n\r\nby banks in Singapore are not significantly different from those\r\n\r\nquoted by banks in Malaysia.  The difference is probably  a  few\r\n\r\npercent. Today, the difference is probably about 4% to 5%, based\r\n\r\non  the risk premium, but no more than that.  When spikes in the\r\n\r\nrates  on  ringgit  do  occur,  they  therefore  reflect  severe\r\n\r\nshortages of supply, suggesting that on those occasions currency\r\n\r\nspeculators have been caught covering short positions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out that the globalization of\r\n\r\ncapital markets allows currencies to move freely world wide.  As\r\n\r\nlong  as  there  is an offshore demand for ringgit,  whether  by\r\n\r\nMalaysians or foreigners, any attempt to restrict the trading of\r\n\r\nsuch  currencies will merely induce the traders to  shift  their\r\n\r\nactivities to another foreign exchange centre  such as Hong Kong\r\n\r\nor London.  Even the Singapore dollar is traded actively in both\r\n\r\nHong  Kong  and  London, and this explains why  even  after  our\r\n\r\nforeign  exchange  market  closes in  Singapore,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\ndollar exchange rate still moves because of trading in the other\r\n\r\ncentres.   It  merely  moves from one time  zone  to  the  other\r\n\r\nelectronically.   This  can just take place  at  any  time.   So\r\n\r\ntrying  to  restrict  such  trading  activities  of  ringgit  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is simply not feasible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said in the Ministerial Statement, the Government does\r\n\r\nnot  and cannot manipulate the level of interest rates even  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollar loans and deposits.  Many laymen,  whether  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  or elsewhere, believe erroneously that the Government\r\n\r\nplays  a part in setting interest rates, but this is simply  not\r\n\r\nso.  Their belief arises because many governments, including the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  government, directly intervene in the  interest  rate\r\n\r\nmarkets,  quite  legitimately, of course, as  an  instrument  of\r\n\r\nmonetary policy.  I think  many may assume that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsince  other countries do it, we must also be doing it.  But  in\r\n\r\nour  case  we  do  not  do it.  Because of the  small  size  and\r\n\r\nopenness  of  our  economy, Singapore cannot and  does  not  use\r\n\r\ninterest  rates as an instrument of monetary policy.   Banks  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are free to set interest rates in response to  market\r\n\r\nconditions.   MAS  monetary policy is centred  in  managing  the\r\n\r\nexchange rate and not on domestic interest rates.  The Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment,  therefore, has no policy either to raise  or  lower\r\n\r\ninterest  rates in Singapore on the Singapore dollar or  on  any\r\n\r\nother foreign currency.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, in the interest of keeping\r\n\r\ninvestors in Singapore in the long term, would it not be  better\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  consider a permanent reduction in the  JTC  or  HDB\r\n\r\nrental, rather than a one-year rebate, as has been proposed?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The one year rebate, of course, can\r\n\r\nbe   extended,  depending  on  conditions.

So  in  making the assessment of whether  to  keep  the\r\n\r\ninvestment  here in Singapore or to move out to our neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries,  they  may want to look at a more permanent  solution\r\n\r\nrather than a year-to-year solution that has been proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Under present conditions, the\r\n\r\nlikelihood is that if things continue to deteriorate, there will\r\n\r\nbe  further reductions rather than remaining fixed at any single\r\n\r\nrate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Sir, I have two questions. First, can\r\n\r\nthe  Minister explain why is the suspension of land sales  given\r\n\r\nsuch  a  relatively  long period, ie, 1\ufffd years?   Why  cannot  a\r\n\r\nreview  by  made, say, during the next Budget session?   Second,\r\n\r\nhow confident is the Government that this off-Budget package can\r\n\r\ncushion the economy from sliding into a recession, say,  in  the\r\n\r\nsecond half of this year or the first half of next year?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The suspension is for a fairly\r\n\r\nlengthy period because property investments take a long time  to\r\n\r\nmature,  and currently there is an over supply of about  20,000-odd  residential units already in the market.  According to  URA\r\n\r\nstatistics,  the take-up in the first quarter of  this  year  is\r\n\r\nprobably  1,500 units.  So the overhang is huge.  Assuming  that\r\n\r\nthings  do not deteriorate, the present overhang would  probably\r\n\r\nlast  several  years.  So the projection is that any  change  we\r\n\r\nmake must be over a substantial period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether we can assure that the present package will help us\r\n\r\navoid a recession is something which I cannot guarantee nor  can\r\n\r\nanyone.   We  will  simply  have to review  the  situation.   If\r\n\r\nconditions  deteriorate sharply, we will always be  prepared  to\r\n\r\ncome back with more measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Can I ask the Minister, although it is\r\n\r\ndifficult to stimulate the local market demand, and perhaps also\r\n\r\nthe  regional  market  demand, why have we  not  considered  the\r\n\r\nprovision of incentives to tap overseas markets which  are  non-traditional?   These are areas which are still there  and  which\r\n\r\ncan  provide us with growth.  In the past, because the  regional\r\n\r\nmarket tended to be accessible, is it not time now for us to tap\r\n\r\ninto  these  markets?  The reluctance to go overseas  into  more\r\n\r\ndifficult markets is something which can be overcome now.

I  do not know what other  countries  he  is\r\n\r\ntalking about.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> What about South America, for example?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> South America has its own share of\r\n\r\nproblems  and  I doubt that it would provide a major  source  of\r\n\r\ninvestment either for us or for exports into the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I could use an example. To use a medical analogy,\r\n\r\nthe present problem\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  are  facing is like a healthy person suddenly being attacked\r\n\r\nby a viral flu.  As everybody knows, a viral flu cannot be cured\r\n\r\nby  a large injection of antibiotics.  It is simply this: if you\r\n\r\nhave  a  healthy body, the doctor will treat the symptoms,  give\r\n\r\nyou  panadol for your headaches and give you a lot of  vitamins.\r\n\r\nIf  you are basically healthy, sooner or later you will recover.\r\n\r\nSo do not expect a magic bullet.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, one short question.\r\n\r\nI  think  a lot of lay people, individuals and small and  medium\r\n\r\nsized  businesses,  will be asking why  the  Government  is  not\r\n\r\nconsidering  suspending  GST because  this  has  the  most  far-reaching impact on one's cash flow.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Choo talks about GST having a far-reaching impact on the cash flow. It is only 3%. It is already\r\n\r\nfully offset for all the lower income people.  So removing it is\r\n\r\nnot  really going to stimulate the growth of the economy.  As  I\r\n\r\nhave  said  earlier, our main objective in this exercise  is  to\r\n\r\nreduce  cost  so  that companies which are in  difficulties  can\r\n\r\nremain in business and continue to employ Singaporeans.  That is\r\n\r\nwhat  we  are trying to do.  Trying to artificially  give  money\r\n\r\nback,  hoping  that the individual would then go and  spend  it,\r\n\r\ndoes  not really help, because the bulk of the industry we  want\r\n\r\nto support should be exporting.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, while it is really\r\n\r\nlaudable that the Minister for Finance has announced a  host  of\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  lower  the business cost and preserve  jobs  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  that,  the fact still remains that  there  are  many\r\n\r\nindividuals  in distress, especially individuals who  have  lost\r\n\r\ntheir jobs and those who may be losing their jobs.  The question\r\n\r\nI  have  is this: why has the Minister not considered using  the\r\n\r\nCPF  mechanism?  For instance, I know that many individuals  are\r\n\r\nprematurely  redeeming their insurance policies and  individuals\r\n\r\nwho  have  difficulties  paying for their children's  education.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the Minister could consider using the CPF mechanism  to\r\n\r\nallow  the usage of their CPF funds to temporarily at least  pay\r\n\r\nfor some of these costs that individuals have to incur.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have\r\n\r\ntwo  questions to raise here.

I hope that three months later, he will review this\r\n\r\npackage and make the necessary adjustment to it.  I believe most\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will  be disappointed with the package  introduced\r\n\r\ntoday,  because the people have high expectations.   The  higher\r\n\r\nthe    expectations,    the    greater    the    disappointment.\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurs in Singapore know that the Singapore Government is\r\n\r\nprudent, and  very conservative, especially in time of  crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Just a few pills  will not solve the  problem.   Mr\r\n\r\nLeong  Horn  Kee has made some useful suggestions just  now.   I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Minister  can consider them more  seriously.

He  has\r\n\r\nincreased  the  amount  from $1.1 billion  to  $2  billion.   My\r\n\r\nquestion  to the Minister is, of the $1.1 billion set  aside  so\r\n\r\nfar,  how  much of it has already been utilised?   And  does  he\r\n\r\nthink that $2 billion would be enough?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Questions have come so fast and\r\n\r\nfurious, I do not think I can respond individually by name.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First question is: why do we not allow the use of CPF for\r\n\r\nthose  who are in trouble?  Of course, that is the easiest thing\r\n\r\nto  do.   But do not forget that CPF is, in fact, for  old  age.\r\n\r\nAnd  if  we deplete it now, how are you going to top it up?   We\r\n\r\nhave,  in  fact, from time to time, in the past, introduced  CPF\r\n\r\ntop-ups.   But to open the door to use CPF for these  particular\r\n\r\nsituations,  I  think is a step which we are very  reluctant  to\r\n\r\nmove at this time, unless things get really, really bad.  And  I\r\n\r\nwould recommend against it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Minister for Manpower had earlier on during\r\n\r\nQuestion  Time already responded to this question that the  bulk\r\n\r\nof money is, in fact, used for mortgage payments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was suggested that the problem we are facing now is more\r\n\r\nsevere  than a flu.  Well, it is a severe form of flu.   What  I\r\n\r\nwas really saying is: do not expect the magic bullet to cure it.\r\n\r\nYou  have  to take tough measures.  But if you are fundamentally\r\n\r\nsound,   like   a  healthy  Singapore  economy  or   a   healthy\r\n\r\nSingaporean, sooner or later, you will recover.  But you  cannot\r\n\r\ncure  it  with antibiotics, just as we cannot cure  it  by  pure\r\n\r\ndomestic stimulation.  The causes are external to us. So we have\r\n\r\nto wait for demand to pick up before we can hope to recover.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMEs, indeed, I agree they are not all exporters and\r\n\r\nequally  the  cost-cutting measures will be  of  help  to  them,\r\n\r\nbecause  they  will be able to stay in business  and  they  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be  able to employ.  So the cost-cutting  measures\r\n\r\naffect  everybody, not just exporters.  But  we  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nexporters are the important components because they are the ones\r\n\r\ngenerating foreign income and foreign exchange for us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On measures to help unemployment, the question has been\r\n\r\naddressed  earlier this morning during Question Time in  that  a\r\n\r\nTripartite  Committee  has  been  set  up  between   the   NTUC,\r\n\r\nGovernment and the Employers' Federation in which people who are\r\n\r\nunemployed  will  be  helped  to  re-acquire  jobs  as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible.   If they cannot acquire jobs, they can be  helped  to\r\n\r\nretrain.   So  at this stage, I do not think we have  reached  a\r\n\r\nstage  where  there is mass unemployment.  There  are  selective\r\n\r\nareas  where people will be redundant and this Committee is  set\r\n\r\nup precisely for this purpose.  Government will continue to help\r\n\r\nfund  all  the  programmes necessary to  re-employ  or  re-train\r\n\r\nworkers.  There is no shortage of funds.  What we need are  good\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ker has suggested that we should show more sympathy for\r\n\r\nindividuals who own two properties.  I am afraid that  I  cannot\r\n\r\nshow much sympathy.  If you already own two properties, you  are\r\n\r\nquite rich.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok has asked whether we are confident that the\r\n\r\nprogrammes  are going to restore confidence.   I  hope  so.   It\r\n\r\ncertainly  should be.  Let me just start from  square  one.   We\r\n\r\nhave all the resources necessary.  I just do not want to splurge\r\n\r\nit  unnecessarily.  If necessary, we will continue to  introduce\r\n\r\nwhatever  measures are required to restore the  economy  but  we\r\n\r\ncannot  influence external demand.  So we need  to  do  all  the\r\n\r\nthings necessary to keep our economy going during this difficult\r\n\r\nperiod,  which basically are cost-reduction, retraining and  re-investment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of Dr Mahathir, I think he is expressing, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  a  concern from the Malaysian point of  view  which  we\r\n\r\nfully\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nappreciate.   If  money  continues to leave  Malaysia,  interest\r\n\r\nrates  will rise because of liquidity problems.  But we are  not\r\n\r\nthe  ones responsible for that.  I think that is the difference.\r\n\r\nHe,  of course, is very worried.  Quite rightly, he should.  But\r\n\r\nwe do not influence the outflow of money.  It is a problem which\r\n\r\nis  not  peculiar  to Malaysia but also affects other  countries\r\n\r\nwhich  face  economic problems.  I hope you understand  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  no  incentive  to  undermine the  Malaysian  economy.   If\r\n\r\nMalaysia  recovers as quickly as possible, all  our  investments\r\n\r\nwill increase in value, and that is really the only test.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a final question on GST, whether we should not\r\n\r\nmake  a  gesture.  Although the percentage is small, the  amount\r\n\r\ncollected  is  not small.  GST is 3%, but the  total  amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney  collected is not small and therefore if there is no  need\r\n\r\nto change it, we should not do it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Under what circumstances should we\r\n\r\nchange?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> We will see when the moment arises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau has asked about LEFS.

But  we  will  increase  the  amount  available  from\r\n\r\n$1.1billion to $2 billion, and any amount necessary if  we  need\r\n\r\nto.   Shortage  of funds is not a problem.

But whatever that\r\n\r\ncan   be  brought  forward  will  be  brought  forward  on   the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure side.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we use new methods of attracting foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments?  I think the EDB is actively doing that.  They  are\r\n\r\nstepping up their programmes and trying their level best to  try\r\n\r\nto  attract as many new investments as possible.  This is why we\r\n\r\nare  continuing to reclaim new lands in Jurong Island which will\r\n\r\naccommodate  all  the  new  industries  in  petrochemicals   and\r\n\r\nrefineries  and so forth.  So we will not stint  and  hold  back\r\n\r\ninvestments   which   are  necessary  to   provide   the   basic\r\n\r\ninfrastructure to attract new investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of additional grants for voluntary welfare\r\n\r\norganisations, we can consider this but each case will  have  to\r\n\r\nbe looked at on its own merits.

The Singapore dollar has since bounced back.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the MAS manages the Singapore dollar against a\r\n\r\nweighted  basket  of  currencies  of  Singapore's  main  trading\r\n\r\npartners,  and  not  against  any single  currency.   While  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   dollar   has  weakened  against   the   US   dollar,\r\n\r\nDeutschemark  and  Sterling,  it has  appreciated  substantially\r\n\r\nagainst the Ringgit, Rupiah and Baht.  On a trade weighted basis\r\n\r\ntherefore,   the  value  of  Singapore  dollar  has  appreciated\r\n\r\nslightly. This is in line with the long-term fundamentals of the\r\n\r\nSingapore economy - high savings rates and low inflation, fiscal\r\n\r\nand  current account surpluses, large foreign reserves  and  low\r\n\r\nforeign debt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding our fundamentals, some volatility in the\r\n\r\nS$  exchange  rate  is unavoidable in the midst  of  the  large\r\n\r\nfluctuations  in  the  other  Asian  currencies.   Any  further\r\n\r\ndecline  in regional currencies would affect the value  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollar  vis-\ufffd-vis the US$, as  these  economies  are\r\n\r\nSingapore's important trading partners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS will continue to allow market forces to determine\r\n\r\nthe  value  of  the  S$,  consistent with Singapore's  economic\r\n\r\nfundamentals.   However, market excesses in overly  pessimistic\r\n\r\nconditions will have to be checked by central bank intervention\r\n\r\nas  was  illustrated in the US-Japan joint intervention in  the\r\n\r\nforeign exchange markets on 17th June 1998 to correct the sharp\r\n\r\ndecline  in the Yen.  MAS will take the necessary steps against\r\n\r\nany  unduly  steep  fall  in the S$ and  stands  ready  to  act\r\n\r\ndecisively  against any unwarranted speculative attack  on  the\r\n\r\nSingapore dollar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How has the decline in value of Japanese yen affected our\r\n\r\ndollar and trade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Minister for Finance, Dr Richard Hu, will reply orally to\r\n\r\na  similar Question from Mr Ang Mong Seng, MP for Bukit  Gombak,\r\n\r\nin Parliament.)\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan is a significant export market for the regional\r\n\r\neconomies including Singapore.  It accounted for 18% of regional\r\n\r\n(Indonesia,  Thailand,  Malaysia, the  Philippines  and  Brunei)\r\n\r\nexports  and 7.6% of Singapore's total non-oil domestic  exports\r\n\r\nin  1997. A falling yen would raise the prices of imported goods\r\n\r\nand   further  dampen  the  weak  demand  for  regional  imports\r\n\r\nincluding from Singapore. Japan is also an important market  for\r\n\r\nSingapore's  services exports. For example,  it  is  our  second\r\n\r\nlargest  single market for tourism, accounting for 15% of  total\r\n\r\nvisitor  arrivals  in 1997. A continuing weakening  of  the  yen\r\n\r\nwould  lead  to  a  further  decline in  Japanese  arrivals  and\r\n\r\naggravate  the  slowdown  in the retail,  restaurant  and  hotel\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The region has also been a major recipient of Japanese\r\n\r\nforeign  capital. Direct investments from Japan  have  accounted\r\n\r\nfor  an  increasing  share  of total FDI  approvals  in  ASEAN-3\r\n\r\n(Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia), from 15% in 1992 to  24%  in\r\n\r\n1996.  In Singapore, Japan contributed a significant\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n21.5%  of total FDI inflow between 1990-95. A weakening of  the\r\n\r\nyen   would  adversely  affect  Japanese  companies'   overseas\r\n\r\nexpansion  plans.  This could have a dampening  effect  on  the\r\n\r\ngrowth of Japanese investments in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, a weakening of the yen is likely to exacerbate\r\n\r\nthe  weak balance sheet position of Japanese banks, which would\r\n\r\nlead  to  a  further  consolidation of  Japanese  international\r\n\r\nbanking activities, including those in the Asian Dollar Market.\r\n\r\nThis would in turn adversely affect the growth of the financial\r\n\r\nservices sector in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a significant exporter of electronic goods, Japan also\r\n\r\ncompetes with Singapore and some of the other regional economies\r\n\r\nin   major  markets  such  as  the  US  and  EU.  The  continued\r\n\r\ndepreciation of the yen will therefore exert greater competitive\r\n\r\npressure  on  regional exports. Finally, as shown by  events  in\r\n\r\nrecent  weeks, a weakening of the yen has a tendency to unsettle\r\n\r\nregional financial markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION OF LEASES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for Law if he will\r\n\r\nconsider  allowing  leases  of up to  10  years  exemption  from\r\n\r\nregistration.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S.
