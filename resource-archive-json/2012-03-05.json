First, Lift Upgrading\r\nProgramme (LUP). The LUP is a Government programme where the bulk\r\nof the cost is to be borne by the Government with the balance co-shared\r\nbetween residents and Town Councils, each paying between 5% and\r\n12.5%. However, based on the accounting used by HDB, the Town Councils\r\nare paying much more and are subsidising HDB's share. This is because\r\nHDB's definition of LUP costs is different from what a common person\r\nunderstands. HDB defines LUP costs as \"the total cost of lift upgrading minus\r\nthe Town Council's share of the lift overhaul costs\".</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a4b4cb5e-3463-4638-b7fb-fe9f50d178a6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a4b4cb5e-3463-4638-b7fb-fe9f50d178a6\"><!--a--></a>What then is lift overhaul?\r\nDuring LUP, new lift shafts are erected. Once operational, HDB requires\r\none or two of the existing lifts to be shut down. According to HDB's\r\nlogic, the shutting down of these lifts is deemed an overhaul. The\r\nTown Councils have to pay HDB the overhaul costs, as overhauls are\r\ncyclical works to be done by the Town Councils. The overhaul cost\r\nis based on a 28-year life span for a lift. If the lift is 24 years old\r\nnow, the Town Council has to pay the depreciated portion, that is,\r\n24 out of 28 years of value based on HDB's costings, which cannot\r\nbe challenged. This could easily work out to about $100,000 for\r\neach lift. For 10 blocks, the Town Council would be required to pay\r\na substantial amount of $1 million, just for the shutting down of\r\nlifts.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cb491683-9b02-4706-8d9a-d1bcb6dfe606\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-cb491683-9b02-4706-8d9a-d1bcb6dfe606\"><!--a--></a>There are several issues\r\nhere. First, use of the word \"overhaul\" to cover shutting down is\r\nconvenient to HDB but does not square with the usual meaning of\r\noverhaul. Second,\r\nfrom the Town Councils' perspective, it is unjustifiable to pay\r\nHDB $100,000 per lift when no physical overhaul work was done but\r\nthe lift instead became extinct. What HDB is bearing is not based\r\non the total bill of the LUP but a lesser amount after first making\r\nthe Town Council pay to HDB part of the total LUP bill through such\r\nlift overhaul costs. This results in a significant drain on the\r\nTown Councils' sinking funds, way above the one-off LUP assistance\r\nprovided by HDB. How does HDB justify such accounting?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1860</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading\" id=\"id-58ec9b8c-565b-41f1-b5dc-17d37577982e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-58ec9b8c-565b-41f1-b5dc-17d37577982e\"><!--a--></a>Car Parking for HDB Residents</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d3ad5e10-fdd3-49d4-afb0-85832d1d45c5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d3ad5e10-fdd3-49d4-afb0-85832d1d45c5\"><!--a--></a>My next cut, Sir.

Many of these\r\ndesignated parking spaces are located far away from residential\r\nhomes of drivers of heavy vehicles. For example, they could be located\r\nin the industrial estates. On the roads, I have seen prime movers\r\nwith bicycles mounted at the back of the vehicles as an innovative\r\nway to cycle home after the drivers have parked their vehicles in\r\nthe industrial parks. For many of these drivers, getting home after\r\nduty can be a challenge, especially when they start work early and\r\nthey end work late. They have to travel long distances back to their homes\r\nand there are also no public transport vehicles available at those\r\nearly hours.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d7251214-37f5-4b61-b20e-13accdd64dfe\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d7251214-37f5-4b61-b20e-13accdd64dfe\"><!--a--></a>As a result, some resort\r\nto illegal parking along public streets near their homes.

Currently, such parking sites are available,\r\nlocated near to residential areas such as those in Bishan and Ang\r\nMo Kio Ave 1. These parking sites are conveniently located under\r\nthe MRT tracks or near to HDB housing estates. These are heavily\r\nsought after by drivers of heavy vehicles and often have a long\r\nwait list. It demonstrates that the practicality and needs of such\r\nparking sites. Currently, there are also many empty plots of land\r\nunder MRT tracks which are not utilised, such as the space next\r\nto Yio Chu Kang MRT Station. These plots of land can offer temporary parking\r\nspaces for heavy vehicles. Will MND be able to identify more of\r\nsuch sites to bring relief to residents and drivers, so that drivers\r\nof heavy vehicles need not park illegally or find other means to\r\nget home after work?

Whilst\r\none should be mindful of the need to have amenities, there is also\r\na need to balance the void deck space available. I thought it would\r\nbe a good idea to reserve the second floors of new HDB precincts\r\nthat are being built for amenities, such as elderly day care centres,\r\nsenior activity centres, facilities for the disabled or childcare\r\ncentres. There is precedence for this \u2013 Block 118 at Bukit Merah View\r\nin my constituency has the Moral Neighbourhood Link, a VWO which\r\nserves the residents in that area.

I thought that\r\nthe idea of having a sports stack, meaning set aside some land away\r\nfrom the main blocks but still part of the precinct. One level could\r\nbe used for football; another level could be used for ball games like\r\nbasketball or netball; another level more for the senior-type games\r\nlike gateball; and another for racquet games like badminton, table\r\ntennis and things like that.

The 2-km long\r\nroad across the cemetery will replace Lornie Road \u2013 we are looking\r\nat replacing Lornie Road with a stretch that will cut across Bukit\r\nBrown. This is part of the Outer Ring Road System. It is not a new\r\nthing. This Outer Ring Road System has been around since the British\r\ndays. What it does is it enables motorists to bypass the city. There\r\nis already a traffic jam at Lornie Road during peak hours, and the\r\nnew road is urgently needed, not simply for future developments\r\nbut it is needed because housing is also being developed in the\r\nnortheast and northern part of Singapore.

We considered widening Lornie Road\r\nbut that would have encroached into the Central Catchment Nature\r\nReserve, and it would also have entailed land acquisition which where\r\nwe can, we try to minimise and avoid. A viaduct: that was something\r\nthat we had considered but it would also have had similar impact.\r\nFor example, road diversion would have been required during the\r\nprocess of building some of these viaducts. Tunnelling \u2013 a tunnel\r\nwould have caused more damage to the cemetery as major tunnels are\r\ntypically constructed by the cut-and-cover approach, meaning you\r\ncut a hole for the tunnel and then you cover over it. Boring \u2013 if\r\nyou were to bore the tunnel, you do not have a bore that is large\r\nenough to create this eight-lane road. You would have to create three\r\nseparate tunnels in order to create that. You would have to go deep\r\nbut at the ends, again, you would have the cut-and-cover method\r\nto provide for the exit points.

The sales agents told them that that there were some couples\r\nthinking of doing this, that is, they are actually not divorcing\r\nbut they intend to file a divorce, so that they can have two flats.\r\nTheir plan is to rent out one flat, while continuing to stay together\r\nin another.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4d01df00-440e-47f2-a630-9f7bb9ced57a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-4d01df00-440e-47f2-a630-9f7bb9ced57a\"><!--a--></a>So, let us not be naive\r\nand think that everybody is honest. The vast majority are, but there\r\nare cases of abuse like these. And that is why the policy was put\r\nin. Without the time bar, each party who has custody of the child\r\ncould then apply for a subsidised flat immediately after divorce,\r\nthus resulting in two subsidised flats. The time bar ensures that\r\na divorced couple is not treated better off than a married couple.\r\nHowever, the time bar is waived if a divorcee buys a subsidised\r\nflat with his or her parents or a new spouse. In other words, the\r\nfamily unit is different from the original one.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-aee68e57-239d-4399-97b5-4b64c8c1c8dc\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-aee68e57-239d-4399-97b5-4b64c8c1c8dc\"><!--a--></a>As I said, it was introduced\r\nin response to some abuses. I must say it is not a common occurrence\r\nbut it is not uncommon either. It is not a common occurrence, perhaps, because\r\nof the rule. Because without this rule, it may then become common,\r\nwhich is what we are trying to avoid. As only A or B is allowed\r\nto have one subsidised flat, we need the other party's consent to\r\ngive up the right during this five-year debarment period. Because\r\nwe are in no position to decide whether A or B is more deserving\r\nof a subsidised flat, in the case where the kids are split between\r\nthem. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1883</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a19af6d1-e0ce-427b-8e66-28d97349c771\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a19af6d1-e0ce-427b-8e66-28d97349c771\"><!--a--></a>But as I heard from you and my own experience\r\nat MPS, the rules have, , created problems for many genuine divorcees.\r\nTherefore, what I have told HDB is to be sympathetic to genuine\r\ndivorcees.

That is why it has to be on a case-by-case basis.\r\nHowever, over the weekend , as I thought through what had been raised\r\nby Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, and after many e-mails with my staff, I told\r\nthem, let us do this: if A and B divorced, and A has custody of\r\nall the children who are young \u2013 let us say the settlement between\r\nthe two is that one of them has full custody of all the young children\r\n\u2212 then in cases like this, we shall, henceforth, immediately waive\r\nthe time bar for A without the need to seek consent from B. But\r\nthe time bar must continue to apply to B who has no kids in custody.\r\nIn this way, we put the interest of the young kids uppermost. In\r\naddition, given the MPs' feedback, I will also review whether the\r\ntime bar of five years is a little bit too long. I think to waive\r\nit, or to make it zero, is unwise. But I want to mull over this\r\none \u2013 whether five years is too long \u2212 and we will try to balance\r\nbetween deterrence against abuse and minimising hardship on divorcees. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-dc1b67a3-2b92-4b28-a882-9b4b93a905ec\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-dc1b67a3-2b92-4b28-a882-9b4b93a905ec\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c878eb10-8d5e-4538-93dc-054ab6e97c34\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-c878eb10-8d5e-4538-93dc-054ab6e97c34\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>\r\n                  </span>: May I seek\r\nsome clarification from Minister of State Lee Yi Shyan concerning\r\nmy cut on Lift Upgrading Programme?

The second clarification is on HDB's definition\r\nof lift upgrading cost, which is a net of the actual lift upgrading\r\ncost minus away Town Council's contribution towards the overhaul cost.\r\nDoes this actually mean that the Town Council is subsidising the\r\ncost of the LUP, in particular the Government's portion of the LUP?\r\nThe third clarification: I agree with Minister of State Lee that\r\ncyclical works such as lift overhaul are part and parcel of Town Council's\r\nwork and, of course, Town Councils do accumulate sinking funds for\r\nthat. But does he also not agree that if Town Councils were to do\r\nthese cyclical works on our own, we could determine the timing and\r\nalso the costing of the works? And we note that HDB's costing is\r\nrather higher compared to our own estimates. The fourth clarification: two\r\nyears ago, during the COS of MND 2010, it was announced that HDB\r\nwould provide one-off LUP assistance to Town Councils. If we looked\r\nat the debate there, there was a recognition by MND that LUP does\r\ncause a strain on Town Councils when it comes to sinking fund usage;\r\nin other words, more than above the cyclical funds that Town Council\r\naccumulates. As usual, LUP does cause a burden, so that is why the\r\nLUP Assistance (LUPA) was provided. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ae6fe229-cd24-4bd1-9797-4398fa2b171d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-ae6fe229-cd24-4bd1-9797-4398fa2b171d\"><!--a--></a>We have looked at some\r\nof the LUPA provided by some of our clusters for LUP and we find\r\nthat in a particular cluster \u2212 if I can just give an example of,\r\nsay, about 11 flats which are largely 3- to 4-room flats \u2212 the Town\r\nCouncil's share of the LUP cost is supposed to be about 7%. But\r\nincluding the overhaul cost which we have to pay, it becomes about\r\n16%. Despite the LUPA being provided of half a million dollars,\r\nwe are still paying about 12%, which is much higher than the roughly\r\n7% we are supposed to pay.

I also want to commend her for knowing the\r\nmathematics very well. Sir, if you want to take a step back on the\r\nLUP programme, this is a programme that was added on in year 2001,\r\nto give access to all the residents in different floors. We know\r\nback in the older days when HDB flats were first built, there were\r\nlift landings, and residents actually shied away from those units\r\nbecause it meant noise and loss of privacy, and so on. So actually,\r\npeople wanted to stay away from lift landings. Anyway, fast forward,\r\ndecades later, we find that people are requiring that facility,\r\nespecially when they are getting older, and there is no question\r\nabout the need. So, the LUP programme comes in and, as I have mentioned, this\r\nis a $5.5 billion programme over a period of 15 years or so. As\r\nyou can imagine, when this programme was introduced, the estates\r\nare at different ages. Some were maybe 15 years old; some may be\r\n20 years old; and some may be very near the lift replacement cycle\r\nwhich is 28 years. As part of the discipline of the Town Councils,\r\nand I mean all Town Councils, they always set aside a portion of\r\ntheir S&amp;CC charges into a sinking fund. And one of the biggest\r\nitems of the sinking fund usage is actually for lift replacement.\r\nSo, at the 28th year, if you have been saving regularly, conscientiously, you\r\nwould be able to have, say, $100,000 to replace each of the lifts\r\nthat is \"retiring\". </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-5b897ebf-6f7e-48c8-94e0-d392d46ce1f8\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-5b897ebf-6f7e-48c8-94e0-d392d46ce1f8\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading hcTime\" id=\"id-3d46bc53-0697-4339-916e-3d6032e3245a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-3d46bc53-0697-4339-916e-3d6032e3245a\"><!--a--></a>12.45 pm</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1a81a80d-87fa-4b43-be56-a13ebfd3e653\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-1a81a80d-87fa-4b43-be56-a13ebfd3e653\"><!--a--></a> Since LUP was introduced\r\nhalfway, some of the lifts may be 20 years old, some may be 22,\r\n25 years. What the Government is saying is that for this portion\r\nof the money that they have saved up, \"Don't worry, you know, we\r\nknow you haven't saved for the 28 but you saved for the 22, that\r\nis fine. We give you a new lift, and you pay for the 22 years and\r\nthe new lift will start from there.\" I think this is fair because\r\nthis is something that the Town Councils have been anticipating\r\nto spend on. So, it is fair to draw down this amount from the Town\r\nCouncil's sinking fund.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-89a84ce6-038e-425f-9078-e63e151625bf\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-89a84ce6-038e-425f-9078-e63e151625bf\"><!--a--></a> Likewise, the formula\r\nwill apply to other lifts of different ages. However, the costs associated\r\nwith replacing the lift is not just the lift carriage or the lift\r\ncar. In most cases where we need to build new lift shafts, across\r\nthe slab block, let us say, there will be costs incurred in the\r\nbuilding of lift shafts, diverting the service lines below the lift\r\nshafts, putting in power and so on. These are additional costs that\r\nthe programme will bear. Also, using analogy A and B, so A, Town\r\nCouncils will pay for a portion of the lift costs, X over 28 and\r\nthen for the other component of the costs, let us say, call it B,\r\nHDB will pay up to 90%. When it was introduced in 2001, many Town\r\nCouncils said, \"If we charge 10% to the residents, maybe it is too\r\nhigh. Town Councils will be happy to chip in the 5%.\" That is why\r\nwe have the formula \u2013 90% by HDB; 5% from Town Councils; 5% from residents\r\non the component B. A and B together, we are able to roll out this\r\nprogramme quite successfully and we expect to complete by 2014.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-06e30cad-b65f-49d6-aae8-47c5aacfa74f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-06e30cad-b65f-49d6-aae8-47c5aacfa74f\"><!--a--></a> There is no doubt that\r\nthe drawdown for lift replacements will be the highest item in the\r\ncyclical work of the Town Councils because the other cyclical works,\r\nsuch as painting, water tanks and so on, will occur in shorter intervals\r\nbut the cost is much lower. Therefore, I think, going forward, it\r\nwill be prudent for Town Councils to review what will be needed\r\nin another 28 years' time and then to adjust S&amp;CC charges accordingly.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-41147f38-6aa4-4fae-a77b-3c41df1a5165\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-41147f38-6aa4-4fae-a77b-3c41df1a5165\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3a3af96e-f137-4a29-8778-2aa6434e2aac\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-3a3af96e-f137-4a29-8778-2aa6434e2aac\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim\r\n(Nee Soon)</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir, I am happy that the Minister mentioned\r\nthat MND is helping Singaporeans who are in distress with regards to\r\ntheir housing matters.

Income security is a key concern for them. The\r\neconomic development of Singapore was achieved in an incredibly\r\nshort time \u2013 it means that older women today are less likely than\r\ntheir counterparts in the developed world to have gone to university.\r\nThis has implications for their late-life employment.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-01475305-1c9d-41ec-88cf-c0b45414aeda\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-01475305-1c9d-41ec-88cf-c0b45414aeda\"><!--a--></a>Women are often the caregivers,\r\nnot just of infants, but also of the elderly and the sick. Sometimes\r\nthey are forced by circumstances to stop work in formal employment to\r\ndevote themselves entirely to care-giving. Our retirement policies\r\nfor this group of women seem to imply they are to depend on their\r\nhusbands and children to support them in old age. But if they are\r\nunmarried, widowed, or have no children, there will be no one to\r\ncare for them. Furthermore, women have longer life expectancies\r\nthan men. That is\r\nwhy in my speech at the Budget debate, I proposed the idea of pension\r\ncredits in Singapore as an example of an instrument that may be\r\nmore effective in protecting older women financially compared to\r\nlabour market policies.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1890</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4918f694-f5f6-4014-90f5-211501479622\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-4918f694-f5f6-4014-90f5-211501479622\"><!--a--></a>In countries like Sweden\r\nand Germany, pension credits or care-giver credits may be earned\r\nduring time taken off from work for maternity leave or for the care\r\nof the elderly and the sick. These would be used to help women qualify\r\nfor full pension and retirement benefits. There are various formulae\r\nto work out the exact benefits, but they usually take the woman's\r\nlast drawn salary and compute a supplement based on it for their\r\npension accounts. In Singapore, we may not want to adopt the idea\r\nof pension credits for women care-givers on a full scale. But currently\r\nno semblance of such scheme exists at all, and this is not sustainable.\r\nOtherwise, it is a contradiction that the Government encourages women\r\nto have more babies, but also expect them to remain in the workforce. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-51a27d4f-7e37-4a57-afbe-dc49e47a4822\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-51a27d4f-7e37-4a57-afbe-dc49e47a4822\"><!--a--></a>Other issues affecting\r\nolder women also affect retirees in general, including men.

The Singapore Council of Women's\r\nAssociation has also successfully pioneered the Women's Register\r\nto mentor women needing help in the workplace. However, these many\r\noutreach programmes need support in order to succeed, especially\r\nto reaching out to the women who need help, and especially for older\r\nwomen who may not be that Internet savvy. These women's groups are\r\nrun by full-time working mothers like me who have limited time and\r\nresources and, hence, in order for them to be more effective, they\r\nneed funding, administrative and execution support for their various\r\ninitiatives. They will also need some time and some help in advertising some\r\nof their good work that they can do, in order to reach out to a\r\nwider audience and in order to place more women in the right sector\r\nand in the right jobs.

I would like to just focus on a few as I have highlighted\r\nthe others during the Budget debate. Firstly, we need to have a\r\nbetter and deeper appreciation of the issues, challenges and opportunities\r\nfacing PMEs. For a start, we need to know potential PME jobs within\r\nthe intermediate term. Our current students and future PMEs are\r\nparticularly concerned about their future job prospects. For example,\r\nin the latest NTU Career Fair in February 2012, it is widely reported\r\nthat the number of job vacancies had dropped from 4,500 to 3,000.\r\nI believe for many of them securing a job first may be all that\r\nmatters. All PME segments in whichever life stage would also like\r\nto understand where the future growth sectors are and whether the remuneration\r\nwill commensurate with the investment of time and efforts in the\r\narea of discipline\r\nthat they have taken on for their education, continuing education\r\nand work experiences.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1913</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3e5f02e5-a7be-40ca-9939-d302bc6736e2\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-3e5f02e5-a7be-40ca-9939-d302bc6736e2\"><!--a--></a>By the same token, the\r\nissues and challenges facing PMEs are varied and sometimes complex.\r\nIt is therefore appropriate we set up a PME taskforce to examine\r\nthe specific concerns and issues involving and concerning PMEs and\r\npossibly at a tripartite level especially for issues revolving around\r\nunemployment, employment, under-employment and employability.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d1c8ce80-4c3f-431b-8c25-01cd2cdfdffc\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d1c8ce80-4c3f-431b-8c25-01cd2cdfdffc\"><!--a--></a>On the vulnerability of\r\nolder PMEs, those above 40 years of age, what can we do to help\r\n\"future-proof\" their jobs? I foresee that more and more of them\r\nwill be affected by layoffs during restructuring exercises. They\r\nmay have top qualifications such as Masters or even First Class\r\nHonours. Nonetheless, once retrenched, they take a long time to\r\nfind the next job. It is not uncommon that they will take at least\r\nhalf a year to one year to do so. Some are forced to go overseas\r\nto look for greener pastures whilst others have to take on significantly\r\nlower-skilled jobs or embark on a freelance career. Speaking to some\r\nof these PMEs online and offline, we should not just look at the\r\nemployment of these PMEs but also the quality and pay of their new\r\njobs. The current approach to scaling up career fairs for PMEs is\r\nbut one approach. I feel we should also try to change the perception\r\nof employers about older PMEs. I would like to therefore propose\r\na three-pronged pre-emptive approach to disprove such a perception\r\nthat older PMEs are not as valuable \u2013 namely, conversion, placement\r\nand employee-cum-employer education.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6f7181fa-9ba0-4ae2-8e9b-21e7ec17047e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-6f7181fa-9ba0-4ae2-8e9b-21e7ec17047e\"><!--a--></a>On conversion, the Government\r\ncan first work with the private sector by promoting better career\r\nmobility through different tracks for PMEs. For companies who are prepared\r\nto hire PMEs from a different industry, there has to be greater\r\nfunding for a career conversion programme in terms of both training\r\nand wages on a once-off basis. We should embark on a drive to get\r\nour employers to support this programme. On placement, the public\r\nsector should lead by example in setting a better rate in hiring PMEs\r\nwho are aged 40 and above. The current rate is about 1,200 per year\r\nwhich is about 9% of new hires. To signify a change in paradigm,\r\nI feel the public sector should take the lead and raise this hiring\r\npercentage and perhaps even raise it higher during times of economic\r\nuncertainties. On employer and employee education, we should promote\r\nthe hiring of older PMEs, investigate any discriminatory practices\r\nand provide a formal mechanism for the aggrieved to seek redress,\r\nand older PMEs should be equipped with the knowledge of the employment\r\nlandscape and opportunities.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a98076c5-148b-47dc-afd9-69d2aa092bc3\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a98076c5-148b-47dc-afd9-69d2aa092bc3\"><!--a--></a>I would like to seek further\r\nclarifications on how a better link for our Continuing Education\r\nand Training and Skills Training for Excellence Programme, the CET\r\nand STEP systems, can correspond to the life stages of a PME. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ed502ce1-9805-4890-a99b-df01a3161db2\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-ed502ce1-9805-4890-a99b-df01a3161db2\"><!--a--></a>First, when a typical\r\nPolytechnic or University graduate seeks to land his or her first job,\r\ntheir concerns will be usually on the pay, career prospects and\r\ndevelopment of their job. I mention job and not career as the former\r\nis defined by a financial need which is understandable as the graduates\r\nneed to pay off their study loans. Our current approach is to provide\r\nthe maximum catchment of prospective employers for the graduates\r\nto embark on their first job. I would therefore like to suggest\r\na closer collaboration between the educational institutions and\r\nWDA on a more proactive approach. This can be a start to map out\r\nthe career needs and history of the individual PME. The State's\r\ninvolvement in this is important as prospective employers can have\r\naccess to a ready pool of PMEs with different expertise for the\r\nvarious vacancies. From the PMEs' perspective, they can have a more detailed\r\nunderstanding of the employers they are working for since this is a\r\nnational database. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1914</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-033aa20e-35bf-4a5b-a354-f24f871377bf\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-033aa20e-35bf-4a5b-a354-f24f871377bf\"><!--a--></a>Second, continuing with\r\nthe life stage, after five to 10 years of working, the individual PME\r\nmay have at least one or two job switches. He or she may have a\r\nclearer sense of the longer- term career that they want to be involved\r\nin and the particular industry they want to be in. We ought to find\r\na mechanism to capture this information as well on a participation\r\nbasis by the PMEs. This is important as it will help to cut down\r\non funds invested into unnecessary training, studying or skills\r\nupgrading if there is a clear job profile that the PME is going\r\nfor. There has to be a clearer link to the qualifications obtained,\r\nhow it has helped to raise productivity and thereby leading to a\r\nreal wage increase. Coupled with other life stage needs at this\r\ntime such as setting up a family, our PMEs need a national training\r\ninfrastructure to be future-ready. Many years ago you could learn\r\nsomething in school and use it for the rest of your life. This has\r\nchanged. The entire landscape has changed. Previously, we used to\r\nlearn, work and then retire. Now it will be: learn, work, learn,\r\nwork, learn, work and then retire. Second-skilling is now ever more\r\ncrucial to ensure employability especially during uncertain times.\r\nIn order to motivate the individual to take a larger interest in\r\nhis or her own skills and capabilities, I would also like to urge\r\nthe Government to study the successful lifelong learning models\r\nin Scandinavian countries such as Denmark and Sweden. This is in\r\nterms of how public spending in adult education can help to enhance\r\nthe creativity and innovation of our workforce, adding value to\r\nthem and helping them to raise their pay. I further suggest that\r\nwhatever amount the individual has invested into his or her upgrading should\r\nbe eligible for tax relief as well and that the current tax relief\r\nlimits should be reviewed. Similarly, there also ought to be a tighter\r\nframework and subvention for students and adult learners who are\r\nenrolled in private universities. Can we consider establishing even\r\nmore adult education colleges so that our PMEs can undertake study sabbaticals\r\nif needed and supported by the employers? </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-140f4a8b-9154-488d-9189-b94c1d8e7529\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-140f4a8b-9154-488d-9189-b94c1d8e7529\"><!--a--></a>In the third life stage,\r\nwhere our PMEs are 40 years old and above and have their own families,\r\nfuture proofing their jobs becomes a top priority. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e9670b04-e84b-4935-b8bd-f4def15b4449\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-e9670b04-e84b-4935-b8bd-f4def15b4449\"><!--a--></a>To sum up on the three\r\nlife stages that I have outlined, I hope to see the Government play\r\nan even bigger role to support PMEs in their career development\r\nbeyond what we see today. Are there plans to set up a national PME\r\njobs databank? For our local PMEs, I have mooted previously for\r\na PME Capability Development Fund. There is an entire train of activities\r\nin enhancing the employment and employability of PMEs. It is not merely\r\nplacing them in a job but in the right job. Before we land them\r\na job, there is a need for proper career counselling and even professional\r\ncoaching. Some PMEs I spoke to said all they need is for us to connect\r\nthem with prospective hirers and they are more than able to do the\r\nrest. Unlike traditional job fairs utilising a one-to-many approach, PMEs\r\nwill require one-to-one or one-to-a-few approach as the types and\r\nrange of PME jobs, requisite capabilities and development opportunities\r\nare extremely diverse and vacancies are mostly one to a few in a\r\nsingle company. Efforts needed are thus more extensive. Are we able\r\nto develop new capabilities to train, equip, re-design, counsel, coach,\r\nplace, retain, and nurture our PMEs? Resources required are going\r\nto be huge. This PME Capability Development Fund can well be for\r\nthe tripartite partners to tap on to train and equip PMEs including\r\nsecond-skilling them and also rolling out initiatives and programmes\r\nidentified by the PME taskforce. There is also the possibility of\r\nsetting up a \"one-stop shop\" to meet and serve the needs of PMEs.\r\nIt could well be a comprehensive resource portal for PMEs with updated\r\ninformation and pointers and also\r\nlink to job search engines including coaching and pre- and post-job\r\nplacement career counselling.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1915</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d60c7039-34b2-4e62-8ea2-735787634c14\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d60c7039-34b2-4e62-8ea2-735787634c14\"><!--a--></a>In continuing the theme\r\non PMEs, my final area of concern is with regard to strengthening\r\nmeasures to help female PMEs cope better with the challenges of managing\r\ntheir careers and raising their families. The lack of family-friendly\r\nwork practices and flexible work arrangements is forcing many women\r\nto delay starting their families or, even worse, give up their careers.\r\nMay I ask the Minister what more could be done to introduce a more\r\nconducive working environment for back-to-work women, in particular,\r\nfemale PMEs who wish to re-join the workforce after an extended\r\nperiod away from work? Without flexible work arrangements, it would\r\nbe difficult to encourage our families to have more children. I\r\nam aware MCYS is aggressively developing our childcare services\r\nand providing support from various angles. However, we also need\r\nto get employers to provide better work-life balance as this is\r\ncritical to support women with families.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-cc6deb14-b76f-495a-b742-ebf9f070b9ff\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-cc6deb14-b76f-495a-b742-ebf9f070b9ff\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading\" id=\"id-8cd52f0a-cc22-471b-987d-7e968ca7d9bc\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-8cd52f0a-cc22-471b-987d-7e968ca7d9bc\"><!--a--></a>Talent Development</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3ef5d559-cdd7-4b41-9271-2805503f2cd8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-3ef5d559-cdd7-4b41-9271-2805503f2cd8\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast)</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nMr Chairman, unlike the US and many of the economies in Europe,\r\nSingapore has had economic growth, a strong job creation and low\r\nunemployment.

Start-ups and \"micro companies\", like HDB neighbourhood\r\nshops and shops in Chinatown, Little India and the Malay Village,\r\ncannot meet the application criteria because they are simply too\r\nsmall.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-510e7361-183a-46d9-8aea-dcb53106926f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-510e7361-183a-46d9-8aea-dcb53106926f\"><!--a--></a>EDC@SCCCI holds regular\r\nbriefings or workshops in Mandarin to explain Government policies\r\nto businessmen. When our EDC staff make calls inviting them to participate\r\nin these sessions, they get this standard response: \"I don't need\r\nto listen. In any case, our company is too small and can never qualify.\"\r\nGoing forward, Government and associations need to look into improving\r\nthe promotional outreach, and simplify the application procedures.\r\nThis is to ensure that more SMEs could really take good advantage\r\nof these schemes. This is truly the challenge faced by the Chamber\r\nand the government agencies. As Deputy Prime Minister Tharman has\r\nsaid, the Government is prepared to go out of its way to help the\r\nSMEs, and hold their hands to help them improve productivity.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6896ffb9-2c0e-49fa-ac98-02c8ebb9ca98\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-6896ffb9-2c0e-49fa-ac98-02c8ebb9ca98\"><!--a--></a>There is a Chinese saying:\r\n\"A capable man needs three helping hands to do a good job.\" Every\r\nsuccessful entrepreneur would go through an initial phase. He may\r\nbe full of ambition and passion. If he cannot find workers, he would\r\nbe fighting a lonely battle. At such a time, any solution would\r\nbe most encouraging and gratifying. Hence, I would like to suggest\r\nbroadening manpower sources and adjusting the management process\r\nand remuneration for part-time workers. This would encourage students,\r\nhousewives and older individuals to re-enter the workforce by working\r\npart-time. This would relieve the labour shortage for \"micro companies\"\r\nand SMEs. This year, the Ministry of Manpower has relaxed the policy to allow foreign\r\nspouses to apply for employment under the Long-term Social Visit\r\nPass-Plus. This move would also help to relieve the acute manpower shortage.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1917</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-50ffb30a-a3bf-427e-a6de-8a2189925dae\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-50ffb30a-a3bf-427e-a6de-8a2189925dae\"><!--a--></a>One of the Chamber's members\r\nhas indicated that part-time workers prefer to be paid in cash upfront.\r\nIf we were to let go one foreign worker, the company needs to recruit two\r\nor more part-time staff to fill the vacancy. If the Ministry of\r\nManpower could allow employers to pay part-time workers like housewives\r\nin cash and waive CPF, these part-time workers could have more ready\r\ncash. Employers could cut down on administrative work and this could\r\nbe one way of raising productivity.

Engineers, professionals, managers\r\nand other older middle-income workers would be affected by the economic restructuring.\r\nUnder the SEC, employers who employ older workers earning $3,000\r\nor lower, could get 8% wage subsidy. For workers with a monthly\r\nwage of between $3,000 and $4,000, the SEC would be lower. For those\r\nearning more than $4,000, SEC would not apply. However, the older\r\nworkers who earn more than $4,000 are also the people whose service\r\ncompanies would like to retain. Thus, I would suggest that the Government\r\nraise the salary level for SEC, to include this group of middle\r\nincome workers.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-97519a2d-c8c8-44c2-ada0-2580df621793\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-97519a2d-c8c8-44c2-ada0-2580df621793\"><!--a--></a>Finally, I would like\r\nto emphasise that foreign workers are an important component of\r\nthe Singapore labour force, and they have also made great contributions\r\nto Singapore's economic development.

Firstly, our local workforce\r\nis ageing. According to the annual reports on labour force in Singapore,\r\nabout 18% of our workforce was more than 50 years old in 2001. In\r\n2011, 10 years later, more than 30% was above 50 years old. The\r\nmedian age of our workforce had also increased from 38 years old\r\nin 2001 to 42 years old in 2011. In view of this, how can the Government\r\nhelp companies to change the way they operate to take into account\r\nthe ageing workforce besides providing Special Employment Credit?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ca2fc9dd-9633-455f-8d13-8f25fcbab403\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-ca2fc9dd-9633-455f-8d13-8f25fcbab403\"><!--a--></a>Secondly, as we transform\r\nour economy to be less reliant on foreign workers and seek expansion\r\nin new growth areas, how do we ensure that our CET system can stay relevant\r\nfor the workers and employers? I understand that MOE is also pumping\r\nmore resources into CET. Thus, how does MOM plan to coordinate with\r\nMOE in CET for better synergy?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-41ada59e-6768-4ced-8f8f-8affb3936588\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-41ada59e-6768-4ced-8f8f-8affb3936588\"><!--a--></a>Thirdly, MOE is working very hard to provide\r\nvocational training to Persons with Disabilities (PWDs).

However, we cannot assume that the vocational training\r\nfor the PWDs will last them a lifetime. PWDs need CET like any other\r\nworkers.

People are increasingly coming to terms and understanding\r\nthe impact of living longer and the need to adequately prepare for\r\nan extended period in retirement. These changes in demographics\r\nrepresent a squeeze on those of working age, as well as on the Government,\r\nas we look to provide retirement incomes and healthcare for the\r\nageing population. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9d3cd590-9662-4b90-973d-eef0b00dea63\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9d3cd590-9662-4b90-973d-eef0b00dea63\"><!--a--></a>The economic benefits\r\nof prolonging working lives should not be underestimated. There\r\nis a key link between health and productivity. If you have a population\r\nthat is healthy\r\nand productive later into life, not only do they contribute longer\r\nto the economy, but they also help to lessen the burden on the society.\r\nEmployers must prepare for a new employment landscape of an ageing\r\nsociety with a growing pool of older workers. This entails a change\r\nof mindset as to how employers perceive our senior workers who are and\r\nwill get much fitter and able to work much longer than 65. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1922</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f8282f2f-d57f-4b8c-af38-7e251ef12dc7\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-f8282f2f-d57f-4b8c-af38-7e251ef12dc7\"><!--a--></a>Sir, allow me to relate\r\ntwo real life cases to illustrate my point. Albert, aged 62, is\r\nnow working as a Property Officer.

He wants to continue\r\nworking in the same job that he believes he is good at. He knows\r\nthat if he were asked to retire, it would be difficult for him to\r\nfind a similar job. Albert feels that his performance is on par\r\nwith his younger colleagues and if not better, considering his richer\r\nwork experience and ability to relate better with people of all\r\nages. He wonders why an older worker is viewed and treated differently. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-fb9b7d55-0c0f-49b1-9f47-36578cd24558\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-fb9b7d55-0c0f-49b1-9f47-36578cd24558\"><!--a--></a>My second example relates\r\nto Michael, aged 65, who will retire end of this month.

He is still able to work well with no let up\r\nin age, ability and agility. He receives good appraisals for his performance\r\nyearly and he is still able to contribute at the same level for\r\nanother few more years. However, he now has to take on a lesser\r\nrole in the same organisation. In fact, it is a waste for someone\r\nwith a vast experience who is able to work and want to work, but\r\nhas to retire or redeployed once he reaches retirement age.

The Government\r\ncan continue to actively support companies and older workers with\r\ntraining, job re-design and workplace restructuring. So, instead\r\nof justifying their employment purely from a cost and renewal angle,\r\nit is time employers recognise their contribution, loyalty, seniority\r\nand experience with a pay that is fair and just. There should not\r\nbe any age discrimination where we have to make older workers cheaper\r\nto be employable. The concept of a \"retirement age\" is becoming irrelevant,\r\nwhether it is a desire to stay connected or active at work, reach\r\na certain nest-egg number, dealing with health-care costs, or grappling\r\nwith mortgage debt, more workers are deciding to delay retirement. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4125645e-7e6f-4800-abcb-8975b5603e0e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-4125645e-7e6f-4800-abcb-8975b5603e0e\"><!--a--></a>Although the Government\r\ncan help and support employers with various schemes to retain older\r\nworkers, both public and private employers need to change their\r\nperception and attitudes on how we treat our older workers.

I would like to state that traditionally we have reported\r\nour manpower statistics based on the resident workforce as this\r\nis in line with international norms and reflects the labour market\r\nattributes and outcomes by differentiating the permanent pool of\r\nworkers, which largely comprises Singaporeans, PRs and the non-transient\r\npopulation. Nonetheless, we also recognise that going forward, there\r\nis increasing public interest over how Singaporeans particularly\r\nare faring and how they are performing. So we complement our statistical\r\npublications on residents with occasional papers on Singaporeans\r\nin the workforce. For example, in October last year, we provided\r\nanalysis and statistics on the employment rate, unemployment rate,\r\nand incomes of Singapore citizens. In addition, we are now regularly\r\nreleasing key labour market outcomes for Singaporeans \u2013 for example, unemployment\r\nrate on a quarterly basis, median and 20th percentile incomes annually in\r\nour regular statistical releases. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b548ee1a-9035-4abb-b35b-dadbc4f81a11\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-b548ee1a-9035-4abb-b35b-dadbc4f81a11\"><!--a--></a>To Ms Tan Su Shan's question,\r\nI think what is important is for us to look at the actual outcomes\r\nfor Singaporeans \u2013 in terms of their income and employability because\r\nthat ultimately is where the rubber hits the road. Despite going\r\nthrough three downturns in the last decade \u2013 at the turn of the\r\ncentury with the dotcom bubble burst, the SARS crisis and then the\r\n2008 crisis \u2013 the median full-time Singaporean worker has done reasonably well.\r\nReal median income gains averaged 2% per annum in the last five\r\nyears from 2006 to 2011. This is real median income. Including employer's\r\nCPF contributions, this would average about 2.5% per annum.

In 2011,\r\n90% of low-wage workers said they performed better at work as a\r\nresult of the training. This is from the low-wage workers' perspective.\r\nThis is not a feedback on the courses itself but after they have\r\nre-joined the workforce. Ninety-five percent of companies surveyed\r\nalso agreed that the training improved the performance of their low-wage\r\nemployees. In addition, 88% of low-wage trainees indicated that\r\nthey will continue to take up other WSQ courses.

There are three reasons to highlight. Firstly, we\r\nneed to achieve an overall reduction in the growth of foreign workers\r\nbut most industries that we speak to \u2013 the companies, in the emails\r\nthey send us and when they come to speak to us at the various dialogues,\r\nsay that they are different, they cannot find Singaporeans, they\r\nneed to have more foreign workers. Almost consistently, many of\r\nthem will say that they need more foreign workers. In fact, the\r\nindustries calling for more foreign workers are the same ones that\r\ncontributed most to the foreign workforce growth in the past five\r\nyears. Mr Low's point about easing the DRCs in sectors such as these\r\nwhere they find it difficult to hire Singaporeans, would have the\r\neffect of opening the floodgates further because many of these companies\r\nthemselves are already hiring many foreign workers. So, it is something\r\nwe need to be very careful about.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-0d5e8120-5d5b-437f-9657-3aef7825a460\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-0d5e8120-5d5b-437f-9657-3aef7825a460\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading hcTime\" id=\"id-4c9f6341-2f96-4efe-89c9-b858d9fb6d86\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-4c9f6341-2f96-4efe-89c9-b858d9fb6d86\"><!--a--></a>4.15 pm</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-40046728-a09a-422c-9af9-f0170c00dab4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-40046728-a09a-422c-9af9-f0170c00dab4\"><!--a--></a>Furthermore, these companies\r\nalso have much lower productivity levels as compared to their counterparts\r\nin developed countries. So the construction industry is one which\r\nI highlighted earlier. I would acknowledge that it is not easy to\r\nbring in young Singaporeans into that sector but it is a very large\r\nindustry. There are some of the more professional jobs which we\r\nbelieve, by a change in job scope, by change in the income levels\r\nor the wage levels, young Singaporeans could be attracted to move\r\nin. But, importantly, in terms of the reliance on foreign workers,\r\nit is an industry that has way too many foreign workers when you\r\ncompare to the construction industry, say, in Australia, and some\r\nof the developed countries, say, in Japan. So we believe that by tightening\r\nthis in some of these sectors, it will force productivity improvements\r\nand that, in turn, would have a significant impact on the overall\r\nnumbers of foreign workers in Singapore.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-98590186-db99-467b-a7c0-b214a37819ff\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-98590186-db99-467b-a7c0-b214a37819ff\"><!--a--></a>To give more liberal DRCs\r\nto some of these industries will actually lead to fairly perverse\r\noutcomes. They will constrain the growth of high-productivity industries, because\r\nremember, the overall objective is to bring down and to manage the\r\noverall numbers. As we liberalise in some of these sectors, which\r\nactually draw on many foreign workers, it will mean that some of\r\nthe high-productivity industries, we will need to tighten it and\r\nactually that will affect them more significantly. So it will be\r\nactually counter-intuitive because it will constrain the growth\r\nof high-productivity industries while we incentivise some of the\r\nlow-productivity industries. And this will also affect their capacity\r\nto create more jobs and good jobs for Singaporeans.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1936</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9d3977f2-2dc5-4a7f-b6ff-e1574b3643a9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9d3977f2-2dc5-4a7f-b6ff-e1574b3643a9\"><!--a--></a>Secondly, we cannot and should not take\r\nit as a given that it is difficult to hire Singaporeans today and\r\ntherefore it will remain so. I think if we look at many of the developed\r\ncountries in Europe, for example; and Germany is a good example,\r\nsome of the jobs that Singaporeans seem to shun here \u2013 educated,\r\ncompetent Germans are undertaking those jobs. In the same way, we\r\nbelieve that a lot of it has got to do with how we re-design the\r\nwork and the work environment, and wages also have to move. So if\r\nwe continue to give such industries more foreign workers, they will\r\nnot have any incentive to improve productivity and change the nature\r\nof work in order to draw in Singaporeans into these areas. These\r\ngood jobs can be created. And I totally agree with Ms Denise Phua\r\nwho raised that we need to re-design jobs and the environment. In developed\r\ncountries, we see that happening and we believe that this can be\r\ndone in Singapore as well. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e55f2293-a36d-4813-bff0-d4a9f1fb8e01\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-e55f2293-a36d-4813-bff0-d4a9f1fb8e01\"><!--a--></a>Several industries experiencing\r\nmanpower shortages have conceded that remuneration, job image and\r\nwork conditions are, in fact, important factors which need to be\r\naddressed to attract local workers.

You will find\r\nin industry one company complaining about how difficult it is, but\r\nin the same industry, a rival competitor took everything on board,\r\nbegan to change and actually began to thrive. How do we manage the\r\nexchange of good practices and ideas? It is not easy but it is something\r\nthat we should endeavour to do and that is where associations and\r\nfederations come in. My Ministry has already started work with the\r\nSingapore Retail Association and the Singapore Hotel Association on\r\ninitiatives to attract locals and to increase productivity, including\r\nindustry benchmarking and job re-design. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0e5dc196-f37d-4fb0-8eca-3eb08e0e7b34\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-0e5dc196-f37d-4fb0-8eca-3eb08e0e7b34\"><!--a--></a>Thirdly, industry-specific\r\nDRCs are difficult to implement in reality.

And it is precisely because\r\nit is complex that it is very difficult to then go in and start\r\ndifferentiating every industry because every one is fairly unique\r\nin their own way and will have their arguments about why they should benefit\r\nfrom more liberal DRCs. It is important to also highlight this point\r\nwith regard to the DRC that, actually, most companies in Singapore\r\nare not maximising their DRCs. There is still space for them to\r\nhire Singaporeans and to hire foreign workers, if they need to. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-29c487a5-b881-4638-a711-40c105f38dbf\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-29c487a5-b881-4638-a711-40c105f38dbf\"><!--a--></a>The boundaries between\r\nindustries are not clear-cut.

For some of these companies, you actually provide\r\nthem an advantage over the very SMEs that some of the Members have\r\nraised about why we should look after them.

It will become very difficult\r\nfor the Government to be constantly tweaking the system to allocate\r\nforeign workers differently, as industry and work conditions change. This\r\nhas a tremendous impact in terms of uncertainty for businesses and\r\nit will affect their\r\nlong-term planning and investments. Firms would not know whether\r\nto invest in productivity to try to attract locals or not, or to\r\nwait for more liberal DRC.

It is precisely because it is complex\r\nthat we need to adapt for this. Our foreign labour framework basically\r\noperates as such: there is a DRC and there is a foreign worker levy.\r\nThe DRC system, we look at the context, the nature of the different\r\nsectors, and we define broadly the different DRCs for the work space\r\nat large. These define the boundaries. The foreign worker levy will then\r\nbe the precise tool that will delve into the details and into this\r\ncomplex world. It is transparent, everybody knows what the foreign\r\nworker levy is, and companies will then decide how much they are\r\nprepared to pay. If they are not prepared to pay, then they re-engineer\r\nand change the process. We believe that this system has worked well\r\nfor Singapore. This is why, in terms of our basic approach, we believe\r\nthat having this combination of the DRCs, which is differentiated\r\nacross the broad sectors, and the levy, will be the mechanism that\r\nmakes sense for us. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3c65fa35-c22c-4f72-ab7e-20d9dcc76fe1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-3c65fa35-c22c-4f72-ab7e-20d9dcc76fe1\"><!--a--></a>Mr Low also suggested\r\nthat differentiated DRCs would help low-wage workers. We are quite\r\nconcerned about this because having liberal DRCs in some of these\r\nindustries which we assume Singaporeans would not be interested\r\nin, may actually have the opposite effect. For example, allowing\r\nmore low-cost foreign workers in the cleaning industry would actually\r\nundo many of the initiatives we are taking to encourage companies\r\nto best-source. We believe that even in the cleaning industry, there\r\nare good jobs for Singaporeans. Liberalising the DRCs will permanently\r\nkeep out the older and low-wage Singaporeans who may find relevant\r\nemployment in these industries. Those who remain, more likely than\r\nnot, will continue to see stagnant wages and poor working conditions\r\nbecause firms are not pressured to restructure. These jobs, we believe,\r\nlike many other jobs, have the potential to be good jobs, and it\r\nis possible to make them so for Singaporeans in the industry.

While\r\nthe CPF is important, what many of these older workers really need\r\nis cash-in-hand to deal with immediate needs of the day, that is,\r\nthe rising costs of living in stagnant wages.

For example, one false impression is that CPF contributions\r\nare not mandatory for part-timers and casual workers, such as restaurant\r\nworkers who only work on weekends or are only called up to help\r\nout at large events. This is incorrect.

Second, MOM and CPF Board will ramp up enforcement\r\nefforts. We have increased the number of inspections since the start\r\nof this year, and we will step this up sharply over the next five\r\nyears.

This may form a large portion\r\nof what workers receive as take-home pay. Valid reimbursements do\r\nnot attract CPF. However, many of the expenses may not be valid\r\nreimbursements. This is how some employers circumvent their obligations\r\nto pay CPF. For example, cleaners and security officers receive\r\nlarge and regular payments as laundry reimbursements. But they typically\r\nwash their uniforms at home, rather than incur laundry expenses.\r\nWe recently encountered a case where the security guard earned a\r\nbasic pay of $745 but received a monthly laundry reimbursement of\r\n$182, based on an income of $745. The laundry reimbursement was\r\nclose to a quarter of the security guard's basic pay, but the worker did\r\nnot receive any CPF on it. There are other examples. We will therefore\r\ntighten up on enforcement to reduce instances of employers trying\r\nto circumvent their obligations under the CPF Act with such malpractices.\r\nWorkers play an important role in our enforcement efforts.

I would like to inform Mr\r\nZainudin Nordin, who earlier talked about creativity, that now with\r\nthe Special Employment Credit (SEC), we will now also have older\r\nphantom workers being introduced into the landscape, as companies\r\nseek to not only just have phantom workers, but older phantom workers,\r\nto benefit from the Special Employment Credit. So we are not short\r\non creativity, certainly not on this front. With that, we are aware\r\nthat this will invariably happen, and we will tighten our work pass\r\nframework, and we know that the temptation for employers to cut\r\ncorners and bend rules will increase, but the price will have to\r\nbe paid. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9e2a21ff-ae59-48d3-a97c-04dd19088582\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9e2a21ff-ae59-48d3-a97c-04dd19088582\"><!--a--></a>We have a duty to the\r\nmajority of responsible employers to be tough on errant employers\r\nwho flout the rules and the system in order to get more than their\r\nfair share of foreign labour.

We also need to take firm action\r\nagainst foreign workers who themselves also try to get around the\r\nsystem to get employed here.

Some new stand-alone EFMA contraventions\r\nwe intend to create include the collection of kickbacks from foreign\r\nworkers, the use of local phantom workers to artificially boost\r\ntheir foreign worker quota as well as the submission for forged educational\r\ncertificates. Secondly, we will boost deterrence by increasing the\r\npenalties for serious contraventions, such as the collection of\r\nkickbacks. Our current maximum penalties for breaching the Work\r\nPermit conditions are a $5,000 fine and/or six months' imprisonment.\r\nThis is inadequate. They do not reflect the egregious nature of\r\nsuch acts. Under the revised EFMA, we intend for unscrupulous employers\r\nwho collect monies from their foreign workers to get or retain a\r\njob here to be subject to appropriately heavier penalties. Thirdly,\r\nwe are designing an appropriate mechanism to complement criminal\r\nprosecution. This should allow the authorities to have a timely\r\nand proportionate response for regulatory breaches of the EFMA.\r\nFinally, we are seeking to expand our powers of investigation to\r\ncrack increasingly complex syndicate operations.

Foreign\r\nworkers play an important role in building our infrastructure, caring\r\nfor our families and making a difference to our lives in different ways.\r\nWe should treat them in a manner that reflects our Singaporean values\r\nof fairness, of\r\ndecency and respect for all workers. We have found that, by and\r\nlarge, the majority of our employers are responsible in fulfilling\r\ntheir obligations, and that most foreign workers in Singapore are\r\ngenerally happy and treated fairly. We conducted a fairly extensive\r\nsurvey in 2011 with 3,000 foreign workers and they indicated that\r\nworkers are generally satisfied with working in Singapore, with\r\nthe majority intending to continue working in Singapore after their\r\nexisting contracts expire. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1957</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-95bd9dd5-a037-4754-bffb-5c0c16a93153\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-95bd9dd5-a037-4754-bffb-5c0c16a93153\"><!--a--></a>There are also stories\r\nof exemplary employers who go the extra mile for their staff. For\r\nexample, Sing Moh Electrical Engineering maintains its own dormitory\r\nwith good conditions for their foreign workers. They provide free\r\nmodem and wireless Internet for workers to tap on. They also celebrate\r\nspecial occasions with their foreign workers, making the efforts\r\nto throw Chinese New Year and Deepavali parties complete with tentages\r\nand entertainers. However, as with every system, there will be a\r\nminority of people who are irresponsible, and we have irresponsible\r\nemployers who flout the rules and mistreat their foreign workers.\r\nIt is important to understand these are the minority. Of course,\r\nthese incidents get amplified, whether in mainstream media or social\r\nmedia, but it should not colour the employment environment in Singapore.\r\nBut notwithstanding that, we have to take action against such employers.\r\nFor instance, we will continue to be tough on companies who do not\r\nprovide acceptable housing for their workers. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-621846de-27cf-49d3-bfcd-1d817ec30523\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-621846de-27cf-49d3-bfcd-1d817ec30523\"><!--a--></a>In May 2011, the dormitory\r\noperator ST9 Pte Ltd was found guilty of failing to provide acceptable\r\naccommodation to their workers.

Let us be quite honest here. This debate on whether\r\nto implement a weekly rest day for FDWs has been long standing and\r\ncontentious. Based on a survey conducted by MOM in 2010, the majority\r\nof our employers currently provide at least one rest day a month, but\r\nmany do not. Since Mdm Halimah Yacob raised the issue in June 2011,\r\nwe have consulted stakeholders, including FDW employers and FDWs\r\nthemselves, extensively and considered their feedback carefully.\r\nAnd we received a broad spectrum of views.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0500892c-73ac-4df0-b73c-052cee55a1ce\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-0500892c-73ac-4df0-b73c-052cee55a1ce\"><!--a--></a>I would like to share\r\nwith Members a sample of what some of these views are. A number\r\nof these views have been edited and not included here because they\r\nare fairly extreme but this would give you a sense. Some employers\r\nfelt that their needs should not supersede the needs of their FDW\r\nto rest and recharge, and that they appreciated their FDW more after\r\ntaking over her chores on her rest day. Other employers felt that their\r\nFDWs do not need a rest day because they have enough rest on a daily\r\nbasis, or that giving FDWs weekly rest day will make it difficult\r\nfor employers to cope when they themselves need a break during their\r\nown days off. Fears were raised about forming relationships or potential\r\ncomparison of employment terms with other FDWs when the FDWs have\r\ntheir days off. One oft-repeated concern is the fear that FDWs will\r\nmisbehave or become less compliant as a result. Some have claimed\r\nthat married couples' relationships would be negatively affected\r\nif the FDW took time off, and that this would lead to a rise in\r\ndivorce rates or reluctance to have children. There are many other\r\nemails that we have not talked about here. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cf0a56a8-59de-4e99-8d2a-97c53b02d1ae\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-cf0a56a8-59de-4e99-8d2a-97c53b02d1ae\"><!--a--></a>It is very clear from\r\nthe robust debate that FDWs play an important role in the lives\r\nof many families in Singapore. Improving FDWs' well-being has a\r\ndirect impact on the quality of care that their loved ones receive.\r\nWe need to ask ourselves: how should foreign domestic workers, who\r\nmake significant contributions to many of our households, be treated?\r\nHow does this reflect on us as a society? </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b442b2fb-d846-4a69-8d1d-1437787cc5fd\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-b442b2fb-d846-4a69-8d1d-1437787cc5fd\"><!--a--></a>A weekly rest day is regarded\r\ninternationally as a basic labour right.

We are currently\r\none of the very few foreign domestic worker destination countries\r\nworldwide lacking in provisions for weekly rest days. This has led to\r\nus becoming less attractive to FDWs compared to other destinations\r\nin the region that provide weekly rest days, such as Hong Kong and\r\nTaiwan.

Even in\r\nextreme cases where the foreign domestic worker absconds and cannot\r\nbe located, only half the security bond will be forfeited if the\r\nemployer has made reasonable effort to locate the foreign domestic\r\nworker.

This hopes to encourage employers who need foreign\r\nworkers to hire those with better qualifications and skills as far\r\nas possible. We believe that is on the right track, but imposing\r\nWSQ as a pre-condition for the renewal of work permit will impose\r\nunnecessary rigidity on employers.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2ff7913e-af17-4fcc-91cd-746f62c2e3ed\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-2ff7913e-af17-4fcc-91cd-746f62c2e3ed\"><!--a--></a>To conclude, the measures\r\nto be put in place by my Ministry this year will help us manage\r\nour foreign workforce better and to preserve the integrity of our\r\nwork pass system. I reiterate again that it is important to do this\r\nfor two main reasons. First, by making sure that it works correctly\r\nto ensure that Singaporeans have the correct opportunities at work.\r\nIf companies bypass the rules, basically, they get more foreign workers\r\nthan they are entitled to and, therefore, deprive Singaporeans of\r\njobs which would otherwise have gone to them. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-da862ff1-e358-4d1f-aba8-3f6daec0fe36\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-da862ff1-e358-4d1f-aba8-3f6daec0fe36\"><!--a--></a>Second, I think by enforcing\r\nand making sure that the system works correctly, we will look after\r\nthe workers properly.

First of all, the Minister of State said my suggestion\r\nto relax the dependency ratio ceiling (DRC) in some industries where jobs\r\nare shunned by Singaporeans, will open the flood gates. I think\r\nhe conveniently forgot that I also proposed that in some industries\r\nwhere Singaporeans would want to do the jobs, we should tighten\r\nthe DRC. And this calibration is done in the national framework\r\nof a target, which the Minister of State is saying that one third\r\nof the foreign workforce will supplement the Singaporean workforce.\r\nWhat I am asking is to recalibrate the dependency ratio ceiling\r\nand redistribute the quota based on industry specifics and the productivity\r\nlevel as well as the level at which they are able to restructure\r\nto minimise the fallout.</span>\r\n               </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1962</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e7e62392-95ce-4c17-ae6d-298a0844f0e5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-e7e62392-95ce-4c17-ae6d-298a0844f0e5\"><!--a--></a>Sir, my second clarification is: would\r\nthe Minister of State be concerned that with the current process\r\nof restructuring in which we have a foreign worker dependency ratio, the\r\nlevy plus the quota at the macro level, by using such a macro tool\r\nto tighten the supply of manpower to the industries, it would inadvertently\r\nincrease the wage cost of the various industries? Would this eventually\r\nlead to a higher cost of living for all Singaporeans, because the\r\nwage cost will eventually be passed on to the consumers? For instance,\r\nif we continue to tighten the construction industry's dependency\r\nratio and quota, it will result in one of the sub industries, like\r\nrenovation, having manpower supply problems. It will lead to higher\r\nrenovation costs for younger Singaporeans who got a flat and want\r\nto renovate their flat. I think it was the hon. Member Mr Heng,\r\nwho was concerned that if we continued to tighten the supply of\r\nworkers in the cleaning industry, then the tender costs will go\r\nup.

I think why I raised the point\r\nwas that Mr Low did mention that for certain industries where we\r\nfeel that perhaps it would be difficult to draw in Singaporeans,\r\nwe might think about easing off the dependency ratio ceiling instead\r\nof tightening it. What I highlighted in my speech was that in many\r\nof these industries that claim that they find it difficult to hire\r\nSingaporeans, are the same industries which contribute to a very\r\nlarge consumption of foreign workers. The construction industry\r\nis a case in point. By easing off the DRCs in these sectors, it\r\nwould lead to having more foreign workers coming in, especially\r\nin these industries which require many foreign workers.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-02ec2709-7dad-43f2-880a-4e08ecf3f4d5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-02ec2709-7dad-43f2-880a-4e08ecf3f4d5\"><!--a--></a>We feel that the system\r\nthat we adopt makes sense. Because by comparison, when we look at\r\nthe same industry in another country, the productivity level is\r\ncompletely different. The Member will be correct to say that if\r\nwe were to increase the levies and no productivity takes place,\r\ncost would go up. But the key focus of a lot of these efforts really\r\nis about increasing productivity. We have been speaking very closely\r\nwith all the different industries in the various sectors, and they\r\nhave all fully taken on board the fact that there is space to increase\r\nproductivity. They acknowledge that there are things that can be\r\ndone. However, having operated for many years with fairly low cost\r\nforeign labour, they have become quite used to it. So, this step\r\nis going to be painful but we think it is necessary.

Largely, there\r\nare two parts to this question. The first I will address is on the\r\nstructure of our workforce. We have basically the Work Permit and\r\nthe S Pass which forms the rank-and-file of the workforce. Then,\r\nwe have Employment Pass, which is treated slightly differently.\r\nAs I highlighted earlier, the Work Pass framework basically operates\r\non a system of DRCs and also levies as a pricing mechanism to manage\r\nthe numbers. The Employment Pass framework operates slightly differently,\r\nas we specify the qualifying salaries. We have restructured it quite\r\nsignificantly last year. Essentially, we have entry level at $3,000,\r\nbut it does not remain there. This level of salary will move with\r\nage, meaning that a PME from another country coming in, say, at\r\n40 or 45 years, will not be operating at $3,000. We would expect,\r\nat the equivalent level for a particular industry, his salary would\r\nhave to be much higher. That is a fundamental change to the Employment\r\nPass framework. This would have an impact. In the past, when we\r\ndid not have this, we could end up having engineers coming in from\r\nthe Philippines who are in their 40s, very experienced, but yet\r\nearning $3,000, $3,100, $3,200. That actually sets our local PMEs\r\nat that same equivalent age at a disadvantage. This was a very fundamental change. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-28ea28fa-1189-43da-a7c8-d5443176fd33\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-28ea28fa-1189-43da-a7c8-d5443176fd33\"><!--a--></a>Secondly, we have also\r\ntightened quite considerably the qualifications criteria, meaning\r\nthat for the Employment Pass level, we do want people to come in\r\nwho will complement our workforce. We all recognise that we do need\r\nan open and diverse workforce, not just at the Work Permit and S\r\nPass level, but at the Employment Pass level as well. There are\r\nskill sets that they bring to bear. There are competencies which\r\nwe are either short of or sometimes do not have the same level of\r\nmaturity in that area or, in some cases, to supplement because we\r\ndo need the numbers. The key thing is that even as the Employment\r\nPass holders come in, what they do is that they create a very dynamic\r\nand attractive labour environment where companies see that it makes\r\nsense to invest here. Because companies come here, they set up their\r\nheadquarters here. Because it is a diverse workforce, it makes sense\r\nto have regional headquarters here, and when these companies set\r\nup shop here, they create jobs directly for Singaporeans and also\r\nindirectly because of all the supporting industries that operate\r\nin order to support these companies that are here. So they create\r\njobs. That is how the system works. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7f2fcf29-5289-4612-be41-1bc79fcd309e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-7f2fcf29-5289-4612-be41-1bc79fcd309e\"><!--a--></a>The second part of the\r\nquestion is about how then do we make sure that companies give priority\r\nto local PMEs who are equally qualified. The adjustment to the salary\r\nlevel will make a difference so that when companies calculate the\r\ncosts involved, they would have to calculate the salary levels that\r\nare expected for a particular PME coming in from abroad because\r\nhe needs to qualify at that level. For many of these foreign talents\r\nwho come here, there are also other allowances that need to be put\r\nin place in their remuneration packages, for example, housing, other\r\nallowances and so on. All these things have to be factored in and\r\ncompanies will have to decide. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-bae42acc-9c21-447b-a37e-851785941abd\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-bae42acc-9c21-447b-a37e-851785941abd\"><!--a--></a>The approach that we are\r\ntaking is highlighted through the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment\r\nPractices (TAFEP) which is basically to encourage positive work\r\nspaces, for companies to be much more aware of their hiring practices,\r\nto make sure that, at all times,\r\nwe need to have a core of Singaporeans here because Singaporeans\r\nremain here.

Mr\r\nLow's contention is that the Government should be paying for the\r\nservices, for the higher wages of cleaners, that we consume their\r\nservices and we are concerned about their welfare, but we are passing\r\nthe costs on to the Government to pay for them.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-27dff1eb-e27a-4b23-9a40-a0713945a67b\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-27dff1eb-e27a-4b23-9a40-a0713945a67b\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9cee96fa-28cf-4ae9-ba64-0c3142613460\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9cee96fa-28cf-4ae9-ba64-0c3142613460\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">BG [NS] Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>\r\n                  </span>: For\r\nthe cleaners working in MOM, as their wages increase, MOM will pick\r\nup the tab to pay and we will be very happy to do so, both for our\r\ncleaners and our security guards.

That effort will\r\ngo a long way. Today, some PMEs have given us feedback that they\r\nfind it difficult. But a lot of it is finding where the gaps are\r\nand to see whether we can match them. This is where, in a sense,\r\nas the middleman, we provide not just training opportunities but\r\nwe are now moving into the space of trying to facilitate employment.\r\nThis can go quite a long way. Sometimes, companies may not know\r\nwhere to find the\r\nPMEs.

Even the Minister's\r\nown example, for instance, of the aerospace industry which, on one\r\nend, you probably need more high skilled labour, on the other end,\r\nyou probably need more foreign workers as it is labour intensive.\r\nFor the part of industry which we are producing enough skilled workers\r\nor engineers to do the work, that is the part where you can tighten\r\nthe dependency ratio.

I am also concerned with the speed of tightening.\r\nOf course, I am not saying that we should not do that. I agree that\r\nwe should move towards the direction of tightening the supply of\r\nforeign labour and improved productivity. But at the rate that we\r\nare looking at, and for certain industries, I am concerned. Yes,\r\nif they are low-productivity industries, you want to push it up,\r\nbut at the same time, you cannot do it suddenly. Because, eventually, we\r\nwill end up with high cost of living. The low-wage workers' wages\r\nmay be increased because of this productivity drive, tightening\r\nof foreign workers, but at the same time, they also end up with\r\na higher cost of living.

In fact, then your position \u2212 which you\r\nshould come out with quite openly - is that in those areas of the\r\neconomy which already have done a good job of becoming less labour-intensive\r\nand depending less on foreign workers, you want them to go even further.\r\nBut by the way, it will have to be much, much further because, to\r\nexplain to you the arithmetic again, the least productive sectors\r\nare the ones that are leading to a very large increase in foreign\r\nworkers.

But it is a mindset\r\nshift that we need to see happen. It is probably a good thing to\r\nstart discussing this because it is about how we ought to treat\r\nothers, and how we should look after the people who are working\r\nfor us and working with us, living with us. And while nine months,\r\nI agree, is not a very long time, I think we expect to see good\r\nconversations taking place and, hopefully, that in itself would\r\nhelp employers socialise themselves to get ready.

When we talk about the foreign\r\nworker, we refer to the whole group of foreign workers. I wonder\r\nwhether the Employment Pass is a loophole which will allow foreign\r\nmanpower to come in to compete with Singaporeans. Employment Pass\r\njobs are the types of jobs that many Singaporeans can perform and\r\nwould like to do. There have been complaints in the past that the\r\nGovernment has allowed Employment Pass holders to be engineers and\r\ndepressed the local engineers' wages. I also wonder whether the Employment\r\nPass framework is within the radar of the Government's economic restructuring\r\nframework with the view of increasing productivity to improve the\r\noverall economic performance of Singapore. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-c8fe3aa4-e74f-433f-b216-4e8d38e9699b\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-c8fe3aa4-e74f-433f-b216-4e8d38e9699b\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-85667cc5-45b3-4c8e-8bae-d1ee631d9a07\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-85667cc5-45b3-4c8e-8bae-d1ee631d9a07\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">BG [NS] Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>\r\n                  </span>: I\r\nwould like to thank Mr Low for the question. I would agree that\r\nthat is one area that we are looking at. Fixing the wage levels\r\nto qualify for Employment Pass is critical. For example, like I\r\nexplained, we raised the Employment Pass entry level to $3,000.\r\nPart of that whole change in framework is not just at the entry level\r\nbut at different ages. The issue the Member raised about whether\r\nit is a loophole, whether we can then have cheap engineers coming\r\nin and therefore depressing the wages: that is something that we\r\nwill counter through these adjustments. Over time, we will not be\r\naverse to increasing those levels. For example, if we find that\r\nour graduates' entry level pay is increasing, we will take corresponding\r\nsteps to raise the entry level for the Employment Pass as well.\r\nThe loopholes can also be exploited by employers who then jack up\r\nor claim that they are paying the S Pass or the Work Permit holder\r\na certain level of pay to qualify for Employment Pass because it\r\nis not subject to the same kind of criteria, and then after that\r\nclaw back from a different source. That is why we talked earlier\r\non about tightening the whole pass framework so that these abuses\r\nwill not take place. The measures will be punitive so that companies\r\nwill be deterred.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-882fbf52-7403-4b4f-b817-da55bb73a880\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-882fbf52-7403-4b4f-b817-da55bb73a880\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1972</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-dd545204-94ec-4988-99e3-bc1acbee5f55\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-dd545204-94ec-4988-99e3-bc1acbee5f55\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">The\r\nChairman</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Final clarification, Mr Low.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-667f6f8e-0dfe-42bd-92cb-616000a77d2d\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-667f6f8e-0dfe-42bd-92cb-616000a77d2d\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f4a92628-c3c3-433d-8da1-f30fc15d3a09\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-f4a92628-c3c3-433d-8da1-f30fc15d3a09\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Low Thia Khiang</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir,\r\nbesides the qualifications and wage level criteria for the Employment\r\nPass, would the Ministry consider putting in place something like\r\na dependency ratio or a ceiling for certain sectors of the economy\r\nor certain companies, for Employment Pass applications?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-ab382021-ee68-4285-8868-79f1aa90b08c\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-ab382021-ee68-4285-8868-79f1aa90b08c\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e559a1a5-5825-470a-8839-dd845fae27d8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-e559a1a5-5825-470a-8839-dd845fae27d8\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">BG [NS] Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>\r\n                  </span>: In\r\nterms of whether we want to implement DRCs for the Employment Pass\r\nholders, I would say that as we move the entry level pay higher\r\n\u2013 for example, previously this level was lower than $3,000 \u2013 but\r\nas we move it up, what it means is that some of the jobs that previously\r\nwere drawing $3,000 or those in the range of $3,200, $3,300, $3,500,\r\nif one day we were to raise it to $3,500, it would mean that some\r\nof those jobs that today are deemed as Employment Pass holders,\r\nwould then be subject to the S Pass regulations which will be subject\r\nto DRCs. At the lower end, as I have said, that is something we\r\nwill track very carefully based on the wages that we expect Singaporeans\r\nto be earning at the entry level when they graduate. We will then use\r\nit as a basis to gauge. If that is required to be increased, we\r\nwill increase that.

But at the moment,\r\nwe do not envisage ourselves using the DRC across the board for\r\nthe Employment Pass levels.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4c1f0d46-af64-49f1-ac36-508859105a56\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-4c1f0d46-af64-49f1-ac36-508859105a56\"><!--a--></a>I would like to emphasise\r\nalso that for this segment of the population, the Employment Pass\r\ndoes bring in workers with certain skill-sets, that both supplement and\r\ncomplement our workforce. We feel it is quite critical because it\r\nbrings in good companies because it provides a very diverse, competitive\r\nworkforce. This attracts not only foreign companies here, but also\r\nkeep our own good local companies here. By doing that, they generate\r\njobs for Singaporeans. These companies are, by nature of being prepared\r\nto pay that level of wages, productive companies. This is important\r\nfor us because if we are not careful, exactly as the concerns that\r\nthe Member has raised, we could end up losing competitiveness and\r\nhave companies exiting.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-38aaacee-40cb-4a89-b598-bd35f25da9e7\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-38aaacee-40cb-4a89-b598-bd35f25da9e7\"><!--a--></a>It is important for us\r\nto be mindful. Operating costs in Singapore are not cheap. However,\r\ncompanies choose to come here, and they come here because of the infrastructure,\r\nthey come here because we have an open, diverse, competitive workforce.\r\nIt still makes sense, despite the costs, to be here. When they are\r\nhere, they generate jobs for us. It does not take much for companies\r\nto re-evaluate and go somewhere else. Which is why in the whole\r\ncalibration of the Work Pass framework, the Employment Pass framework,\r\nit is very critical to get it right. We need to make sure that the\r\nsteps that need to be taken ought to be done. For us, whether at\r\nthe Work Permit level or the Employment Pass level, productivity\r\nis one big area that we need to emphasise.
