This is sought to be achieved by deleting\r\n\r\nthe proviso to sub-section (1) of section 50, which\r\n\r\nimposes this restriction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House is aware with the conferment of the\r\n\r\nenlarged  powers  of  the Criminal  Law  (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions) (Amendment No. 2) Ordinance,  1959,  to\r\n\r\nprovide for the alternative of imposing supervision\r\n\r\norders  some  nine  months ago, the  activities  of\r\n\r\nsecret  societies  have been contained  and  secret\r\n\r\nsociety  incidents have been reduced  considerably.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,   the  situation  requires   constant\r\n\r\nvigilance and no effort can be spared in waging the\r\n\r\nrelentless campaign against them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law now stands, some of those detained\r\n\r\nunder   the  Criminal  Law  (Temporary  Provisions)\r\n\r\nOrdinance, consisting of general headmen,  headmen,\r\n\r\nassistant  headmen  and  hard-core  secret  society\r\n\r\ngroups  will be due for release in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe  making  of  Supervision  Orders  against  such\r\n\r\npersons  will  not  suffice to prevent  them,  upon\r\n\r\ntheir  release,  from exercising  their  pernicious\r\n\r\ninfluence   over  their  followers,   and   it   is\r\n\r\nanticipated that their release from detention  even\r\n\r\nunder  police  supervision will definitely  restore\r\n\r\nand  refresh the ranks of their followers, so  that\r\n\r\nit  is likely that there will be an increase in the\r\n\r\nincidence of their vicious crimes against society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure Members of the House will agree with me\r\n\r\nthat  the  danger to society of releasing a  fairly\r\n\r\nlarge number of high-ranking secret society members\r\n\r\nsuddenly  without  having  undergone  any  form  of\r\n\r\nrehabilitation  is  very real indeed.  In  fact,  I\r\n\r\nmight inform Members of the House that some of  the\r\n\r\nleaders\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  present  kidnapping gangs  were  convicted\r\n\r\nprisoners  who  have  been released  only  recently\r\n\r\nwithout undergoing any form of rehabilitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government in seeking to increase the powers\r\n\r\nof  detention of these criminal elements  is  fully\r\n\r\nconscious  of  the  fact  that  mere  detention  of\r\n\r\ncriminal gangsters without any attempt to reeducate\r\n\r\nand  rehabilitate them is a negative  and  wasteful\r\n\r\napproach to the problem. The Government is  of  the\r\n\r\nview   that  detention  should  not  be  purely   a\r\n\r\npreventive  measure  of keeping hardcore  criminals\r\n\r\naway  from society, but also that detention  should\r\n\r\nbe  a  rehabilitative process with  the  object  of\r\n\r\nconverting  the  criminal  detainees  into   useful\r\n\r\nmembers of the society. It is with this end in view\r\n\r\nthat  the Government has recently launched a scheme\r\n\r\nfor  the  re-education and rehabilitation of  these\r\n\r\ncriminal  detainees at Pulau Senang. Obviously,  no\r\n\r\none  can forecast how long it takes to rehabilitate\r\n\r\neach individual. Some may respond more quickly than\r\n\r\nothers, while some may take a longer period. If the\r\n\r\nPulau  Senang rehabilitation scheme is to have  its\r\n\r\nfull  effect,  the  period  of  detention  of   any\r\n\r\ncriminal  must  not  be restricted  to  a  definite\r\n\r\nperiod. For this reason the ad-hoc committee  which\r\n\r\ndrew up the Pulau Senang scheme recommended that an\r\n\r\namendment   should   be  made   in   the   existing\r\n\r\nlegislation  to  enable the  Minister  to  make  an\r\n\r\nindeterminate detention order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government has no wish to see any\r\n\r\ncriminal  detainees remaining  one  day  longer  in\r\n\r\ndetention  than  is  necessary.  Accordingly,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment intends in the next few days to  appoint\r\n\r\na  Review  and  Rehabilitation Committee  to  begin\r\n\r\nreviewing  the cases of detainees at Pulau  Senang,\r\n\r\nwith  the view to recommending their early release.\r\n\r\nAt  the  same  time the Government is  also  making\r\n\r\narrangements to offer gainful employment  to  those\r\n\r\nreformed criminal detainees, so that when they  are\r\n\r\nreleased,  they can start life anew without  having\r\n\r\nto fall back on their old ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, with the powers conferred by the\r\n\r\namendment,   two  objectives  are  sought   to   be\r\n\r\nachieved;   namely  (1)  the  negative  object   of\r\n\r\npreventing  the  in-crease  of  violent  crimes  by\r\n\r\nkeeping   hard-core  criminal  gangsters   out   of\r\n\r\ncirculation  for a longer period of time;  and  (2)\r\n\r\nthe  constructive object of equipping them  through\r\n\r\nwork  and  re-education during  the  rehabilitative\r\n\r\nprocess  towards  becoming  loyal  and  law-abiding\r\n\r\nmembers of the community capable of wanting to earn\r\n\r\nan  honest and productive livelihood and who  above\r\n\r\nall  will  not  consider that  resort  to  violence\r\n\r\nprovides an alternative means of livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill-[Mr Ong Pang Boon].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.18 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That clause 2 stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister\r\n\r\nin  his  speech  just now said that the  Government\r\n\r\nproposed to appoint a committee to review the cases\r\n\r\nof the detainees at Pulau Senang.

Or will there\r\n\r\nbe  growing  agitation, ferment,  unrest,  talk  of\r\n\r\nreopening  constitutional discussions for immediate\r\n\r\nindependence  with  consequent  inability  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  maintain stability,  no  expansion,\r\n\r\neither  economic or industrial, to  take  place  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the growing unemployment and the con-comitant\r\n\r\nsocial    problems   that   failure   to    resolve\r\n\r\nunemployment must bring?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my duty to give an objective and\r\n\r\ndispassionate  review  of  the  past  year  and   a\r\n\r\nforecast  of  the  trends  and  tendencies  in  the\r\n\r\nimmediate future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An analysis of the forces at work in the past\r\n\r\nyear  discloses that there are no new factors which\r\n\r\nhave entered the political arena to bedevil us\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  to  rescue  us  from the perennial  intractable\r\n\r\npolitical and economic problems. Against the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nand  what it stands for - an independent, democratic,\r\n\r\nnon-Communist Malaya - there is only one organisation\r\n\r\nto  contend  with  us,  to  challenge  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment in a bid for ultimate power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Right-wing forces, such as they are,\r\n\r\nrepresented by the Liberal-Socialists,  the  S.P.A.\r\n\r\nand  whatever  new Parties that may  register  from\r\n\r\ntime to time, are inert and ineffective. And it was\r\n\r\nwith  some  sadness that I read the notice  of  the\r\n\r\nfeeble  amendments to this motion  that  have  been\r\n\r\ntabled  by  the Members for Tanglin and Joo  Chiat.\r\n\r\nAfter 14 months in which crucial issues facing  the\r\n\r\nsurvival  of  the democratic system in Malaya  have\r\n\r\nbeen  intensely  debated,  all  that  the  official\r\n\r\nOpposition in this Assembly can do is to  think  of\r\n\r\nthe   restoration   of   paycuts,   worries   about\r\n\r\nkidnapping and the re-employment of civil  servants\r\n\r\nwho  have  left the Government service prematurely.\r\n\r\nThese  are the world-shaking events which  comprise\r\n\r\nthe  horizon  of  our  official Opposition - eloquent\r\n\r\ntestimony  of  their  purblind  approach   to   our\r\n\r\nproblems.   For  they  can  only  see   peace   and\r\n\r\nprosperity in relation to the restoration of  their\r\n\r\nlittle  social  world  which envelops  their  whole\r\n\r\nbeing.   They  refuse  to  see - perhaps   they   are\r\n\r\nincapable  of  seeing - the  bigger  problems   which\r\n\r\nconfront us, problems which go to the very root  of\r\n\r\nthe survival of our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in any drama there must be comic relief.

But to put up  these  secondary\r\n\r\nissues  when  the primary question of  survival  is\r\n\r\nstaring  us in the face, is an example of political\r\n\r\nmyopia  which has only been equaled by  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Tanglin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add that by dismissing the Right-wing in this light-hearted manner, it is not to say\r\n\r\nthere  are no Right-wing forces in Singapore. Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  the  British  whose  extensive  economic  and\r\n\r\nmilitary  interests not only in  Singapore  but  in\r\n\r\nthis  whole  region are obvious,  there  are  local\r\n\r\nadherents of the K.M.T. and a whole host  of  other\r\n\r\nreactionary diehards who would stop at  nothing  to\r\n\r\nbring the present Government down in the hope  that\r\n\r\nthey  could go back to the good old days to exploit\r\n\r\nthe  country  for  their benefit.  We  had  defined\r\n\r\n\"subversion\" and defined it before the elections to\r\n\r\nmake  it  an issue of confidence and made it  quite\r\n\r\nclear  what  we meant by that term - that whether  it\r\n\r\ncomes  from  the  Right  or  from  the  Left,   any\r\n\r\nsubordination  of the interests of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  outside interests,  we  consider  an\r\n\r\nundermining of the authority and integrity of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState, and we shall resist. Extremism, either  from\r\n\r\nthe Right or from the Left, will have to be smacked\r\n\r\ndown good and hard. If we allow one, acute reaction\r\n\r\non  the  other side is inevitable. Our duty  is  to\r\n\r\nsquash both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened in the last 14 months? Have we,\r\n\r\nas  a  Government, stood up to our responsibilities\r\n\r\nand  the test of power? Has this Government  proved\r\n\r\nitself adequate to meet the stresses and strains of\r\n\r\nan internally self-governing State with an Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity Council, with foreign affairs and  defence\r\n\r\nout of its hands?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past year the momentum of the P.A.P. after\r\n\r\nits  massive  victory  in the  last  elections  was\r\n\r\nstupendous.  There were exuberance and  zeal  which\r\n\r\ntook  a  lot of tempering. Minor mistakes of haste,\r\n\r\nborn out of impatience to put the world right, were\r\n\r\ncommitted. They were errors, not of the rashness or\r\n\r\nwisdom of the policy to be implemented, but of  the\r\n\r\nintemperate  haste which resulted  in  insufficient\r\n\r\npreparation and the carrying of the opinion of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  which  could have been done  by  prolonged\r\n\r\nconsultation and public discussion. It is also true\r\n\r\nthat  power  accentuated the weaknesses  latent  in\r\n\r\nsome   of   the   individuals  in   the   political\r\n\r\nleadership.    The   emotional    immaturity    and\r\n\r\ninstability  of  certain  individuals  caused  more\r\n\r\ntrouble  than had been anticipated. The process  of\r\n\r\nrectification,  which  started  some  three  months\r\n\r\nafter  the Party came into power, had to go  on  to\r\n\r\nits logical conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Communist sympathisers and activists,\r\n\r\nwho  had scattered and gone under cover before  the\r\n\r\nlast  elections, began the work of  regrouping  and\r\n\r\nreorganisation. Over the last 14 months, a build-up\r\n\r\nof  their  ground  strength through  ground  cadres\r\n\r\nworking on the workers has been taking place in the\r\n\r\ntrade union movement. These pro-C.P. activists have\r\n\r\nworked  hard to secure the support of the rank  and\r\n\r\nfile.   The  Government  is  realistic  enough   to\r\n\r\nacknowledge that there must be a certain amount  of\r\n\r\nfree play on the ground, provided the authority  of\r\n\r\nthe State is never challenged, and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleadership of the trade union movement remains non-Communist, as it must be in a non-Communist  State.\r\n\r\nAnd, despite the regrouping and reorganisation,  it\r\n\r\nis  quite clear that the absence of tension and the\r\n\r\nabsence   of  deep  and  abiding  grievances   have\r\n\r\nprevented  a  mass  unrest  and  hysteria  and  the\r\n\r\ntendency  to  man barricades. There is literally  a\r\n\r\ndearth  of issues upon which to bait the Government\r\n\r\nand  work  up  feelings of antipathy and  hostility\r\n\r\nfrom the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By any test, the P.A.P. Government is admitted to\r\n\r\nbe  a  progressive  government with  a  small  \"p\".\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  is  difficult  to  denounce  it  as\r\n\r\nreactionary.  By no stretch of the imagination  can\r\n\r\nit  be  said to be anti-worker or an enemy  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  But,  of  course,  being  a  non-Communist\r\n\r\ngovernment, although it is progressive, it is  said\r\n\r\nby  the  pro-C.P. orthodoxists that the  Government\r\n\r\nconsists  of waverers (the traditional  concept  of\r\n\r\nthe bourgeois revolutionary in Marx's term), always\r\n\r\nstopping short of ultimate revolution, compromising\r\n\r\nwith the enemy, selling out on the long-term rights\r\n\r\nand  interests  of  the people to  the  reactionary\r\n\r\ncolonialist  imperialists of the  British,  or  the\r\n\r\nreactionary feudalists of the Federation. These are\r\n\r\nthe terms and the language of the doctrinaire. As I\r\n\r\nsee  it,  the  danger is not that the  P.A.P. will\r\n\r\ndeviate  from its declared policy, but  that  these\r\n\r\nLeft-wing  adventurers, unable  to  manipulate  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to  abandon  its non-Communist  principles,\r\n\r\nwill  begin  a  fight with a government  which,  by\r\n\r\ntheir own admission, is progressive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, the events arising out of the\r\n\r\nexpulsion  of  the  Member for Hong  Lim  from  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. provide us with a wealth of material  as  to\r\n\r\nthe  thinking  and the tactics of  these  Left-wing\r\n\r\nadventurers.   Once  the  P.A.P. discovered   the\r\n\r\nweaknesses  of  its  individual  adherents  in  the\r\n\r\npolitical  leadership, it had either to rectify  or\r\n\r\nto  go  down as a result of, these weaknesses.  And\r\n\r\nrectification   started   not   with   the   recent\r\n\r\nexpulsions, but with the immediate systematic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconscribing of the capacity for harm together  with\r\n\r\nthe  putting right of what had been done wrong. The\r\n\r\nopportunist   elements  within   the   Party   were\r\n\r\ncontained and conscribed. In an open society  where\r\n\r\nno  secret  disappearances can take  place,  it  is\r\n\r\ninevitable   that  rectification   would   have   a\r\n\r\ntemporary  unsettling effect.  When  criticism  and\r\n\r\nrectification   of  those  individuals   were   not\r\n\r\nsuccessful,  then  suspension  and  expulsion   was\r\n\r\ninevitable.  And  it  also  provided  us  with, a\r\n\r\ndemonstration in miniature of the forces  that  are\r\n\r\nagainst  us.  The whole business of suspension  and\r\n\r\nexpulsion  was allowed to run its full  course,  so\r\n\r\nthat the full extent of the weak points within  the\r\n\r\nParty, and the threats from without the Party,  can\r\n\r\nbe  brought into the open and clearly seen.  Within\r\n\r\nand  around  the Party, it was a test of  loyalties\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  on  an occasion of  a  minor  crisis,\r\n\r\namply  giving proof of the loyalty or otherwise  of\r\n\r\nthose  who  subscribe to the P.A.P. The  weaknesses\r\n\r\nwithin the Party will have to be rectified and  the\r\n\r\nchallenge from outside will have to be met. What is\r\n\r\nworthy of note is that there has been no change  in\r\n\r\nthe  basic  forces at work. But it  did  bring  out\r\n\r\nvividly  in  a  controlled  test  the  tactics  and\r\n\r\npolicies  of  those  who,  for  want  of  a  better\r\n\r\ndescription, we have called Left-wing adventurers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me clarify the' distinction that we make\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Communist Party and  these  Left-wing\r\n\r\nadventurers. The policy of the Communist Party,  so\r\n\r\nfar   as   we  can  decipher  from  their  declared\r\n\r\nstatements issued both here and abroad, is to unite\r\n\r\nwith all progressive forces, of which the P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nacknowledged as one, to struggle against the forces\r\n\r\nof   reaction  viz,  colonialism,  imperialism  and\r\n\r\nfeudalism.  But  because  the  Communist  Party  is\r\n\r\nproscribed and inhibited, its followers and  cadres\r\n\r\nlack  positive  leadership; they lack  an  official\r\n\r\nline set out with the speed which an open party can\r\n\r\ngive  to its followers. Therefore, the policies  of\r\n\r\nsuch  an underground organisation have to be freely\r\n\r\ninterpreted in any given situation on the basis  of\r\n\r\nbroad  general principles laid down  by  the  Party\r\n\r\nbeforehand.  And the less adept of these  followers\r\n\r\nwho want to out-left\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Left and take on battles before they are ready\r\n\r\nfor  them,  we term \"Left-wing adventurers\".

We\r\n\r\nhave  nothing to do with the Member for  Hong  Lim.\r\n\r\nAll  I was doing was to recount their practice. All\r\n\r\nthose who have followed the newspapers in the  last\r\n\r\nfew weeks, including you, Mr Speaker, will bear me\r\n\r\nout,  I think, when I say that I am only recounting\r\n\r\nwhat  they  said  and the issues  upon  which  they\r\n\r\nwished  to take up the cudgels with the Government.\r\n\r\nWhat   they  said,  quite  simply,  is  that   they\r\n\r\ndismissed  the  Member  for  Hong  Lim,  but   they\r\n\r\nsupported the so-called 16 resolutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this is important. What they are admitting\r\n\r\nis  that it is true that the man who proposed these\r\n\r\nresolutions was in their opinion unworthy, but they\r\n\r\nwanted   to  support  the  worthiness  of  the   16\r\n\r\nresolutions  which they said contained  progressive\r\n\r\nmaterial.  In other words, they were all in  favour\r\n\r\nof trying to fish in P.A.P. troubled waters - what we\r\n\r\nhave  often  demonstrated in  the  past  to  be  an\r\n\r\nextremely unprofitable profession.

Whatever\r\n\r\nour  weaknesses, lack of courage of our convictions\r\n\r\nis  not  one, nor do we lack understanding  of  the\r\n\r\ntechniques  of  these Left-wing  adventurers.  Were\r\n\r\nthey  really interested in the 16 resolutions? Were\r\n\r\nthey  interested in 5 of those resolutions  turning\r\n\r\nupon the internal cadre organisation of the P.A.P.,\r\n\r\ndesigned to prevent the party from being controlled\r\n\r\nother  than by those who are loyal to the long-term\r\n\r\naims and objectives of the party? Did they want  to\r\n\r\nbe  cadre members of the P.A.P. when they supported\r\n\r\n5  out of those 16 resolutions? And since when  did\r\n\r\nthey  decide  that  tobacco and petrol  taxes  were\r\n\r\nunsocialist  moves?  And the Betting  Bill.  Nobody\r\n\r\npassed  any resolution or sent any memorandum  from\r\n\r\nthe First to the Third Reading of the Bill and then\r\n\r\nnot until after the P.A.P. conference. Let them  be\r\n\r\nhonest.

The issue  then\r\n\r\nwas,  and  still it seems now is, independence  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  by  itself  as  a  practical,   feasible\r\n\r\npolitical  objective, or independence for Singapore\r\n\r\nonly   through  merger  with  a  larger  entity - the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya -  from whom its  water  supply\r\n\r\ncomes  and  on whose hinterland Singapore's  trade,\r\n\r\ncommerce and industry depend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems for these pro-C.P. forces\r\n\r\nduring the past year has been the absence of issues\r\n\r\nwhich  would  agitate and excite  their  followers.\r\n\r\nThey  could not, when they supported the  so-called\r\n\r\n16   resolutions,  have  put  much  faith  on   the\r\n\r\npracticability of independence for Singapore alone.\r\n\r\nAll  they  were  concerned with was  to  find  some\r\n\r\nslogans to keep their supporters excited, something\r\n\r\non  which  to get tensions to mount, to  create  an\r\n\r\natmosphere  of  uncertainty in which no  industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion  will  take place, so that  economic  and\r\n\r\nsocial  conditions will deteriorate  and  therefore\r\n\r\ntheir  forces  of  recklessness will  increase  and\r\n\r\nstrengthen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for good measure, there were two other\r\n\r\nissues - release  all  political  detainees  arrested\r\n\r\nbefore  the P.A.P. came into power. The P.A.P. had\r\n\r\nalready decided on this principle and has made  its\r\n\r\nstand  clear,  both in public and in  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity Council. But of course they claim that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. bourgeois revolutionary party was weak  and\r\n\r\nvacillating, yielding to the forces of reaction  in\r\n\r\nthe Internal Security Council! And the cancellation\r\n\r\nof  the  registration of the federation  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had  registered but had  de-registered,\r\n\r\nagain because the Government, so they claimed,  was\r\n\r\neither weak in the face of reactionary strength, or\r\n\r\nleaning to the Right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were contradictions between the Left-wing\r\n\r\ngovernment of Singapore, and the British  and  what\r\n\r\nthe'  Federation Government itself calls  a  Right-wing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngovernment of the Federation, contradictions  which\r\n\r\nwe  must normally expect Communists to exploit, but\r\n\r\nmany  of  these contradictions they did not exploit\r\n\r\nbecause  it would have redounded to the  credit  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Let me give a small illustration but  a\r\n\r\nvivid one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody knows that the P.A.P. Government is\r\n\r\ngoing  to stand or fall on its policy of industrial\r\n\r\npeace  with justice, to secure industrial expansion\r\n\r\nto  resolve the economic problems. And  it  is  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  of a non-Communist government to  explore\r\n\r\nall  avenues  and  all  channels  conceivable,  for\r\n\r\nassistance and economic aid to resolve our economic\r\n\r\nproblems.  And  do they not know,  these  Left-wing\r\n\r\nadventurers from reading the newspapers, that  even\r\n\r\nthe   presence  of  a  Russian  delegation  to   an\r\n\r\nE.C.A.F.E.  Conference in Singapore on  small-scale\r\n\r\nindustries was viewed with suspicion and disfavour?\r\n\r\nAre  they unaware from Press reports that even  the\r\n\r\ngiving  of  a  residence  visa  for  more  than   a\r\n\r\ntransitory  visit  to a Russian representative  had\r\n\r\ncaused  excitement  and  brought  opposition?   The\r\n\r\nBritish  interests in Singapore  are  obvious.  The\r\n\r\nFederation has to ensure that Communist activity in\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  is  not  aided  from   bases   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  One would have thought that intelligent\r\n\r\nCommunists  would have found this a good  united  front  issue.  But  on the contrary  the  Left-wing\r\n\r\nadventurers kept silent. They only chose to exploit\r\n\r\nthe  issues  which are of no benefit to the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nbut of benefit only to their pro-C.P. forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me pose the contradictions between the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nand  the  pro-C.P. forces. I say pro-C.P. advisedly\r\n\r\nbecause the M.C.P. is underground and is unable  to\r\n\r\nevince its collective will itself, and there is  no\r\n\r\nway  of  preventing  several  different  lines   of\r\n\r\nvarious  pro-C.P. groups, all being issued  in  the\r\n\r\nname  of the C.P. The P.A.P. is a progressive force\r\n\r\nand  will  remain one - a force for change towards  a\r\n\r\nmore equal and just society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three possible situations in which we\r\n\r\ncan find ourselves as a Party. First, where what is\r\n\r\ngood  for the people and for the P.A.P. may be  bad\r\n\r\nfor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Communists.  Secondly, what is  good  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  the P.A.P. may also be  good  for  the\r\n\r\nCommunists. And third, what is bad for  the  people\r\n\r\nand the P.A.P. may be good for the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all these cases, we are prepared to proceed\r\n\r\naccording  to  the dictates of our  interests,  our\r\n\r\nconscience and our judgment. Whether it is bad  for\r\n\r\nthe  C.P. or good for the C.P. is irrelevant.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government is prepared  to  carry  out  all\r\n\r\npolicies which are for the benefit of the aims  and\r\n\r\nobjectives which the P.A.P. stands for,  and  which\r\n\r\nthe  people  voted for. But it is not  prepared  to\r\n\r\nfight  for, nor is it going to carry out  policies,\r\n\r\nwhich  are bad for the P.A.P. but are good for  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  To try and coerce the  P.A.P. into  a\r\n\r\nunited  front on the third of these premises  is  a\r\n\r\nfutile and fruitless business which will aggravate,\r\n\r\nexacerbate  and stiffen the attitude of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nWe  are  not  going  to  promise  independence  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  for the immediate future, first  because\r\n\r\nwe  believe  it is a fraud on the people  to  claim\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore can be independent alone, not  only\r\n\r\nbecause it is not viable, but because it can be  so\r\n\r\neasily  captured and destroyed. Have they forgotten\r\n\r\nthat some 80,000 British troops had to surrender in\r\n\r\nSingapore  10  days  after  the  Japanese  captured\r\n\r\nSingapore's  water supply situated  in  Johore?  Do\r\n\r\nthey  believe  that an island with 1\ufffd million  souls\r\n\r\nbut  with no natural resources, can be independent?\r\n\r\nWe  credit them with intelligence and therefore  we\r\n\r\nbelieve that they can see these facts as well as we\r\n\r\ncan. And the conclusion we can come to is that they\r\n\r\nare  deliberately  arousing false expectations  and\r\n\r\nhopes in the people and in their supporters for the\r\n\r\nselfish purpose of creating excitement and tension,\r\n\r\nand  an  atmosphere  of what  they  hope  would  be\r\n\r\nuncertainty upon which the growth of their strength\r\n\r\ndepends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to restate in simple language for\r\n\r\nthe  benefit of the Opposition, both in this  House\r\n\r\nand,  equally important, outside this House,  that\r\n\r\nthe  policies of the P.A.P. were evolved out of its\r\n\r\nown  experience of struggle under local conditions,\r\n\r\nnot  out of doctrinaire principles. And it has been\r\n\r\nsuccessful\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup  to  date and will continue to be successful  so\r\n\r\nlong  as  it adheres not to doctrinaire principles,\r\n\r\nin   complete   disregard  of   local   facts   and\r\n\r\nconditions,  but to the principles evolved  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext of the Malayan revolutionary situation.  We\r\n\r\nbelieve   in   an  independent,  democratic,   non-communist,   socialist   Malaya.   What   is    the\r\n\r\nalternative for all Left-wing forces in Malaya?  To\r\n\r\nthis   affirmation  of  our  faith,  does   anybody\r\n\r\nseriously stand up to say that they believe in  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  an independent Communist  Soviet\r\n\r\nRepublic  of Malaya? In the context of the  present\r\n\r\nsituation, do they hope to carry with them the mass\r\n\r\nof  the  Muslim  Malays, the English-educated,  the\r\n\r\nIndian-educated?  Surely  all  have  conceded  that\r\n\r\nthere can be no Communist Singapore until there  is\r\n\r\na  Communist  Malaya and there can be no  Communist\r\n\r\nMalays  unless the Malays are sufficiently softened\r\n\r\nfrom neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must ask the House to forgive me for having\r\n\r\ntaken  so much of its time on what would appear  to\r\n\r\nbe  a theoretical dissertation of the inter-play of\r\n\r\npolitical  forces in Singapore. But it  is  because\r\n\r\nwhat  I  have discussed are the factors  that  will\r\n\r\ndecide  whether Singapore ticks for better  or  for\r\n\r\nworse  that  I  have  spent time  discussing  these\r\n\r\nfactors. I am sorry that after 14 months of  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  the  English  language  newspapers  are\r\n\r\nstill allowed to confuse and delude the public. The\r\n\r\nirony  of it is that basically anti-Communist local\r\n\r\njournalists,    through    European    imperialist,\r\n\r\ncolonialist    newspapers - they   are    long-winded\r\n\r\nhyphened words, but they are terms of art and  have\r\n\r\ncertain  marks with circles, and I have sought  .to\r\n\r\nuse  these  terms advisedly - these journalists  have\r\n\r\nhelped  to build up confusion in the minds  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.   All  this  talk  of  absolute  democratic\r\n\r\nrights, laissez-faire liberalism, freedom and human\r\n\r\nrights,  in the face of the stark realities  of  an\r\n\r\nunderground  struggle for power, can  only  confuse\r\n\r\nthe English-educated world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem that we are confronted with is not a\r\n\r\nsimple  one  of  allowing absolute  liberalism  and\r\n\r\ndemocratic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrights  to prevail, but of exerting that amount  of\r\n\r\nrestriction on absolute rights so that a reasonably\r\n\r\ntolerant  democratic  society  can  endure  without\r\n\r\nturning  or  yielding to a totalitarian  state.  In\r\n\r\nother   words,  the  government  can,   and   where\r\n\r\nnecessary must, restrict the rights of individuals,\r\n\r\nbut  if  it does so to a point where it,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nmakes the whole system a totalitarian society, then\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of  the restriction would  have  been\r\n\r\nnegated.   These  restrictions  are  only  bearable\r\n\r\nbecause without them a more intolerant system would\r\n\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech to this Assembly the Yang di-Pertuan Negara has listed out in detail the things\r\n\r\nthat  will  be  done for the people in  the  coming\r\n\r\nyear.   They  include  mundane  things  as   roads,\r\n\r\nfootpaths,   drains,  sanitation  and  stand-pipes.\r\n\r\nSince  the  integration  of  the  organs  of  local\r\n\r\ngovernment  with  those of the  Ministries  of  the\r\n\r\ncentral  Government, all these things  have  become\r\n\r\nthe  concern of this Assembly. These are the things\r\n\r\nwhich intimately concern the people and their daily\r\n\r\nlives. It is right that a government that seeks  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  lives  of the vast  majority  of  its\r\n\r\npeople - the workers and the farmers - should spend  so\r\n\r\nmuch  time  and  effort  and  money  to  make   the\r\n\r\nadministration  respond to these  social  problems.\r\n\r\nAfter  14 months we can say that the organs of  the\r\n\r\nState   of   Singapore  are  well  maintained   and\r\n\r\nfunctioning with a reasonable degree of sensitivity\r\n\r\nto the problems of the people. But we have to admit\r\n\r\nthat  a  lot  of ground has still to be covered  in\r\n\r\nmaking the administration more alert, and equal  to\r\n\r\nthe  political  challenge we are confronted  with - a\r\n\r\nchallenge  of  rapid change, rapid progress,  rapid\r\n\r\nimprovement   which  the  political   ferment   and\r\n\r\nrevolution  in Asia has aroused in the  hearts  and\r\n\r\nminds of its peoples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the chances of success in our struggle\r\n\r\nto achieve these objectives - changes of the economic\r\n\r\nbasis of our livelihood and the social structure of\r\n\r\nour population through the democratic process? What\r\n\r\nkind  of  political weather are we in for?  Running\r\n\r\nthe risk of all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nweather  forecasters  to be  proved  wrong  in  the\r\n\r\nevent,  I  would  still  go  on  to  say  that  the\r\n\r\nindications are that we will have reasonably decent\r\n\r\nweather  with fair periods, wet patches and  sudden\r\n\r\nsqualls. It is the sudden squalls that we  must  be\r\n\r\ncareful of. For the worst that can happen - and it is\r\n\r\nimportant  that we remember this - is the failure  of\r\n\r\nthis little experiment in the democratic process of\r\n\r\none  man one vote to bring some improvement in  the\r\n\r\nlot  of the people. If we are unable to face  these\r\n\r\nsudden  squalls,  then we shall go  under  and  the\r\n\r\nexperiment will have to be restarted all over again\r\n\r\non some other occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is useful if we can put these things in\r\n\r\nperspective, in terms of the ultimate, of the worst\r\n\r\nand  the best, that is possible. What is the  worst\r\n\r\nthat can happen in the immediate future for us as a\r\n\r\nGovernment?  It  is  that the Government  may  find\r\n\r\nitself out-manoeuvred and out-propagandaed by these\r\n\r\nLeft-wing  adventurers, in which  case  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwill have to take the count in this fight, and  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  will be counted out for many  years  to\r\n\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not unaware that with the Communists on\r\n\r\none  side of us and the British colonialists on the\r\n\r\nother, each side will want to pull us to its  side.\r\n\r\nWe  are also aware that failing this, each of these\r\n\r\ntwo  contending extremes are quite prepared to  use\r\n\r\nus  as  buffers in their machinations against  each\r\n\r\nother.  The British want to preserve their economic\r\n\r\nand  military interests in Singapore  and  in  this\r\n\r\nwhole   region   for  as  long  as  possible.   The\r\n\r\nCommunists  want  to  set up a Soviet  Republic  of\r\n\r\nMalaya. To them let me say this: we are fully alive\r\n\r\nto the realities of this political situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the business of a government to govern, and\r\n\r\nwhilst  we  are the Government we must ensure  that\r\n\r\nthis  Government's  authority prevails  within  the\r\n\r\nlimits  of  its jurisdiction. But it  is  also  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  of  the Government to ensure  that  if  a\r\n\r\ncollision has to take place between these Left-wing\r\n\r\nadventurers  and the colonialist imperialists,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. should let them break their heads\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  each other. For we are confident that whatever\r\n\r\nthe temporary maneuverings and ups and downs, we as\r\n\r\na  non-C. P. socialist force have a historic  role'\r\n\r\nto play in the political struggle of Malaya in this\r\n\r\ncrucial  stage  of  our history.  Our  duty  is  to\r\n\r\npreserve the integrity and effectiveness of our non-Communist  socialist movement, not to  be  used  in\r\n\r\nother peoples' plots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best that we must strive for is to succeed in\r\n\r\nsettling the economic and political problems of the\r\n\r\npeople and succeed in maintaining industrial  peace\r\n\r\nwith  justice  to  the workers,  whilst  industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion takes place to alleviate the unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem  and  create optimistic prospects  for  the\r\n\r\nyears   beyond  1964.  The  economic   and   social\r\n\r\nconditions of poverty and distress must be  removed\r\n\r\nby  the  efforts of the people and the  Government.\r\n\r\nThere must be enough success to ensure a reasonable\r\n\r\nequilibrium for peace and prosperity in this  phase\r\n\r\nof our struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to emphasise that in a speech made by the Hon. Prime Minister\r\n\r\nrecently,   there  was  one  point   raised   which\r\n\r\nattracted  my attention. If I am not mistaken,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, it can be said that in the debate  on  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Yang di-Pertuan Negara's Address,  I  was\r\n\r\nseverely  criticised.  But, today,  it  seems  that\r\n\r\nthere   are  more  dangerous  elements   than   the\r\n\r\naccusations levelled against me as a communalist. I\r\n\r\ndo   not  and  cannot  for  a  moment  accept  that\r\n\r\nstatement,  either  today or  at  any  other  time.\r\n\r\nWhether in the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nin  the present session or in the elucidations made\r\n\r\nby   the   Prime   Minister  on  a   self-governing\r\n\r\nSingapore, I am of the opinion that the major issue\r\n\r\nis  not  on  domestic  problems.  Since  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  who holds the reins of Government,  does\r\n\r\nnot  wish to achieve independence for Singapore,  I\r\n\r\nwill  extend  my hand to him if he is  prepared  to\r\n\r\nchange his attitude to that of anti-Communist,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  that  we could save the people of Singapore  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  and Malaya as a whole. These  are  the\r\n\r\nfindings  of  the  political organisation  which  I\r\n\r\nrepresent.  My  findings  may  be  wrong  and   the\r\n\r\nfindings of the Prime Minister may be right.  Today\r\n\r\nwe  call  our Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan  Yew  or\r\n\r\n\"Lee  Hsien  Sheng\",  but if he  really  wishes  to\r\n\r\nstruggle  to prevent a Soviet Republic  from  being\r\n\r\nestablished in Malaya, then we hope that he may  be\r\n\r\nconferred a title by the Federation Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to praise the Member for Cairnhill,\r\n\r\nbut  what  I can see today posing as a major  issue\r\n\r\nare  the  Communists or Communist sympathisers  and\r\n\r\ntheir  followers in Singapore. The  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nsaid  that  only if the Malays were  weak  and  the\r\n\r\nposition  of the surrounding territories  was  weak\r\n\r\nwould   the  whole  of  the  neighbouring  islands,\r\n\r\nincluding Malaya, become a Communist State.  But  I\r\n\r\nam  fully confident that this would not come about,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, and I would not mind being accused  of\r\n\r\nbeing communal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malays founded Singapore and not Sir Stamford\r\n\r\nRaffles. I would like to stress that my great-great-grandfathers founded Singapore. Whether Mr Speaker\r\n\r\nor other Members of the Assembly believe it or not,\r\n\r\nI  am  taking  this opportunity today  to  have  it\r\n\r\nrecorded in the history of Singapore that I do  not\r\n\r\nadmit  or accept Sir Stamford Raffles as being  the\r\n\r\nfounder   of   Singapore.  We  are   fighting   the\r\n\r\ncolonialists and we consider the Prime Minister  as\r\n\r\none   who  has  buried  colonialism  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   Mr   Speaker,  I   am   taking   this\r\n\r\nopportunity  today  to  stress  that  history  will\r\n\r\nreveal  that  in our struggle, be it in  any  form,\r\n\r\nincluding the political struggle, we must  bear  in\r\n\r\nmind that Singapore was founded by the Malays, and,\r\n\r\nas  the  indigenous people, we ask that our special\r\n\r\nrights be preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Malay history, Mr Speaker, there is mention\r\n\r\nof this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Sang Nila Utama accompanied by his Ministers and\r\n\r\npeople, went hunting and many game was found.  They\r\n\r\npassed a deer which Sang Nila Utama chased. It  was\r\n\r\nlater  killed  by  His Majesty's spear.  Sang  Nila\r\n\r\nUtama\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwent to a rock and looked out to the horizon. He\r\n\r\nfound  that  the shore across the sea  was  very\r\n\r\nfair and white. He was told that the mainland on\r\n\r\nthe   horizon  which  he  could  see  was  named\r\n\r\n\"Temasek\".  He then commanded `Let  us  go  over\r\n\r\nthere.'  Whilst  at sea, there  was  a  terrific\r\n\r\nstorm,  and  he could only reach Telok  Blangah.\r\n\r\nAll  the luggage was thrown overboard except the\r\n\r\ncrown.  But  still the storm raged on  and  Sang\r\n\r\nNila  Utama then finally ordered that the  crown\r\n\r\nshould also be jettisoned, as he felt that  this\r\n\r\nact  would abate the fury of the storm  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  boat  would remain afloat. After the  crown\r\n\r\nhad been jettisoned, the storm abated. The party\r\n\r\nproceeded  and then finally landed on the  shore\r\n\r\nwhere  they found people playing by the  seaside\r\n\r\nat the mouth of the River Temasek.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon.

It  is\r\n\r\nmentioned  in the speech by the Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara that the Malays will be given aid, and  I\r\n\r\nhope that it will be implemented in the light of\r\n\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of the\r\n\r\nspecial position of the Malays, as long as there\r\n\r\nare  U.M.N.O. representatives  sitting  in  the\r\n\r\nOpposition, it follows that we will not agree on\r\n\r\nall\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npoints  submitted by Government as  regards  the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  what  is  contained  in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution,  as we do not wish to  be  branded\r\n\r\npolitically  that  U.M.N.O. (Singapore)  is  not\r\n\r\nfighting for what it should be fighting  for  in\r\n\r\nthe interest of the Malays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the introduction of the\r\n\r\nspeech  of  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  it  is\r\n\r\nstated - to  cut it short - that it is not  easy  to\r\n\r\nestablish a socialist State quickly and  that  a\r\n\r\nfully  developed socialist economy could not  be\r\n\r\nachieved as long as Singapore is separated  from\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. As I have said earlier on,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  we know that the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  has faced militant Communism since  1948\r\n\r\nand that the shooting war between the people who\r\n\r\nlove democracy and militant Communism came to an\r\n\r\nend  on  31st  July,  1960. We  are  aware  that\r\n\r\nthousands of lives and property were lost in the\r\n\r\nFederation.  Perhaps  the  Minister   for   Home\r\n\r\nAffairs here could enlighten us as to the  true\r\n\r\nstate' of affairs: how many Communist agents are\r\n\r\nthere in Singapore? Why I ask this, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  is that from the speech made by the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, it would appear to me that this is not\r\n\r\nonly a problem for the P.A.P. to face alone, but\r\n\r\nit  is also a problem which should be considered\r\n\r\nby  all  Members  of  this Assembly.  There  are\r\n\r\npeople  who have been expelled from that  Party.\r\n\r\nThere  are  genuine Socialists,  Communists  and\r\n\r\nRightists in the P.A.P., but we do not know  how\r\n\r\nmany  of these elements there are in this  Party\r\n\r\nor  in  Singapore. However, if it is  true  that\r\n\r\nsuch  elements  do  exist, then  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  take  the opportunity to eliminate  them\r\n\r\nonce  and  for  all, as they  have  always  been\r\n\r\nsaying  that they want to create a non-Communist\r\n\r\nSingapore, so that Singapore can then merge with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. This is a fact  and  we  cannot\r\n\r\ndeny it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, we come to the social\r\n\r\nconditions that exist today. If I were to  speak\r\n\r\non this subject, I might be accused of agitating\r\n\r\ncommunalism;  but I am able to speak  factually.\r\n\r\nEvery help and encouragement should be given  to\r\n\r\nthe Malays so that they will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe pioneers in the achievement of a merger between\r\n\r\nSingapore   and  the  Federation.  I   have   every\r\n\r\nconfidence  that  only  the  Malays  or  the  Malay\r\n\r\nleaders   in  Singapore  could  plead  with   their\r\n\r\nbrothers in the Federation to accept Singapore as a\r\n\r\nunit of the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we go any further, Mr Speaker, Sir, there\r\n\r\nare  many  responsibilities which we must  shoulder\r\n\r\ntogether. Is it sufficient only to build houses for\r\n\r\nthe Malays in the Malay settlements? In my opinion,\r\n\r\nthey should be helped in the matter of education. I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know the programme that have been launched\r\n\r\nby  the  Ministry of Education. But  I  have  heard\r\n\r\nrumours - I  do  not know how far they are  true - that\r\n\r\nfrom this month onwards the Malays will be exempted\r\n\r\nfrom paying any school fees in Singapore. I do  not\r\n\r\nknow  whether  that is true, but it is  up  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Education to enlighten  me  on  this\r\n\r\npoint. Why is it not possible to give such help  to\r\n\r\nthe  Malays?  We  do not want independence  if  the\r\n\r\nMalays  in  Singapore cannot be free in  their  own\r\n\r\nthoughts.  Give this opportunity to the  Malays  so\r\n\r\nthat  they will be able to compete with their  non-Malay  friends  on  equal terms  in  the  field  of\r\n\r\nemployment,  and so on. But we do not  wish  to  be\r\n\r\nspoon-fed  forever. We wish to  stand  on  our  own\r\n\r\nfeet. However, such opportunities were not given to\r\n\r\nus  during the past 14 months and we ask that  they\r\n\r\nbe  given  to  us.  I hope that this  will  receive\r\n\r\nserious consideration by the Ministry concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would refer to my speech on education made\r\n\r\nearlier.  Apart from giving exemption from  payment\r\n\r\nof school fees to Malay pupils, if the past British\r\n\r\ngovernment  could  do this,  why  is  it  that  the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  the people's  government,  who\r\n\r\nwere  elected  by  the  people,  and  who  went  to\r\n\r\nWhitehall -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I apologize, Mr Speaker, Sir. But these are my views and I hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government will give us the opportunity.\r\n\r\nWe will not ask for anything else outside except in\r\n\r\nthis    Assembly.   There   may    be    a    wrong\r\n\r\ninterpretation - that if we are unsuccessful in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  we will use force. But I would  like  to\r\n\r\nemphasise that whatever we ask for should be given,\r\n\r\nor  we  are  obliged to withdraw,  so  that  a  new\r\n\r\nConstitution could be promulgated in Singapore.  If\r\n\r\nthe  British  government, I again emphasise,  could\r\n\r\nhelp the Malays who were considered fit only to  be\r\n\r\npeons  or  policemen, then I hope  this  government\r\n\r\nwill continue to render assistance to the Malays in\r\n\r\nthe  form  of  free textbooks and other  facilities\r\n\r\nwhich are vital for the improvement of the standard\r\n\r\nof education of the Malays in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another point to which I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  draw  the attention of the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  is  that we, the Malays,  cannot  accept\r\n\r\nCommunism. We need moral education. It has been our\r\n\r\ncustom,  as is known, to incline towards  religion.\r\n\r\nWhile  talking  on the subject of schools,  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  religious education could be  taught  to  all\r\n\r\npupils,  especially Malays who embrace  the  Muslim\r\n\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, I will go on to the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs.  I  would like to get  clarification\r\n\r\nfrom  the Minister, and I hope that he will fulfill\r\n\r\nmy  request. Could he give a guarantee to  take  on\r\n\r\nMalays  as constables possessing Std. VII education\r\n\r\nfrom  a  Malay  school? If not, I  will  very  much\r\n\r\nregret  it, and it seems that there is no guarantee\r\n\r\nof  a  future for leavers from these lower  schools\r\n\r\nand  they are fit only to be labourers who  at  the\r\n\r\npresent moment are difficult to get. Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nwould  also  like to ask whether or not all  vacant\r\n\r\nposts  in  the  Police Force or in  any  department\r\n\r\nunder  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  have  been\r\n\r\nfilled.  How  is promotion given to them!  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  further about the  position  of  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Guard and Escort Unit.  Have  they\r\n\r\nbeen given equal treatment with other members of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Police Force? I believe that provision has been\r\n\r\nmade  in the Budget for fair treatment to be  given\r\n\r\nto members of the Guard and Escort Unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further point, Mr Speaker, is that concerning\r\n\r\nrelations  with Indonesia. Mention is made  in  the\r\n\r\nHansard  of  20th July, 1960, that  relations  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia  have  been on a much better  level.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  what  kind  of  friendly  relations  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia  have been maintained by the  Government?\r\n\r\nThe  matters that are of benefit to our people have\r\n\r\nbeen   omitted  in  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's\r\n\r\nspeech. Is this cordial relationship connected with\r\n\r\nnewspaper  reports  concerning  the  visit  of  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nNational   Development  to   Indonesia   to   study\r\n\r\neducation  methods in Indonesia? I have read  these\r\n\r\nreports  but cannot find anything that will improve\r\n\r\nthe  standard  of education in Singapore.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  clarification on this matter. Or is  it  that\r\n\r\nthe visit was made purely to sound the views of the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Government  as  to  whether  the  Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage could be made the official language  which\r\n\r\ncould  be  used  at  all  levels?  Or  whether  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian Government will give au assurance in the\r\n\r\nway of trade between Indonesia and Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, mention is also made on rural development. In this matter, I would like `to\r\n\r\nreceive  clarification from  the  Government.  Many\r\n\r\nstandpipes  have been installed by the  Government.\r\n\r\nThe   building  of  roads  and  bridges   and   the\r\n\r\ninstallation  of telephones, and so  on  have  also\r\n\r\nbeen  done  by the Government. These projects  have\r\n\r\nbeen implemented during the past 14 months, but one\r\n\r\nthing that astounds me is this, Mr Speaker. I  did\r\n\r\nsend  a request to the former Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment, the Member for Hong Lim, when  he  was\r\n\r\nin  charge  of the Ministry, concerning  mosquitoes\r\n\r\nbreeding  in  stagnant water in the  drains  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency.  My request was met-workers  went  to\r\n\r\nthe  area  and cleared it of mosquitoes. But  since\r\n\r\nthen  I  regret to say that the kampong  folks  are\r\n\r\nvery  angry  with  me  as  the  representative  `of\r\n\r\nKampong Kembangan. I told them that I had already\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwritten letters to the Government, and that it  was\r\n\r\nnow  left  to them to rectify the state of affairs.\r\n\r\nIf  the Member for Hong Lim, as the former Minister\r\n\r\nfor  National  Development, could undertake  to  do\r\n\r\nthis,  why could the present Minister not do  this?\r\n\r\nIf I am telling a lie, please send a delegate and I\r\n\r\nam  prepared to accompany him and his party to  the\r\n\r\nsite.  The mosquitoes breed in the stagnant  water.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, I do not wish to elaborate  on  small\r\n\r\npoints  like this. This, in short, depends  on  the\r\n\r\nMinistry concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to talk further on the many standpipes installed in my area. The\r\n\r\npopulation there is dense, and consists not only of\r\n\r\nMalays  but  also  of Chinese. In  this  particular\r\n\r\nplace, I am realty sorry to see that the Malays and\r\n\r\nChinese  drink well water; and there are plenty  of\r\n\r\nempty  tins  lying around and mosquitoes  breed  in\r\n\r\nthem.  In  Teo  Kim Eng Road, there  is  no  public\r\n\r\nstandpipe   installed  there,  and   I   hope   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will help me. If they do  not  wish  to\r\n\r\nhelp  me  as  an Opposition Member, at  least  they\r\n\r\nshould help the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, there is another point to which I should like to draw the\r\n\r\nattention  of the Government. This is the  question\r\n\r\nof the rural areas - our request for particular areas\r\n\r\nor  general areas. I do not wish to give credit  to\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Hong Lim, but  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nemphasise that at one time I did appeal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  him for the cemetery grounds, in Teyban  to  be\r\n\r\nmade  use  of  by  lorries,  and  my  request   was\r\n\r\nfulfilled satisfactorily and without delay. I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  difficulties  in  the  rural  areas  could  be\r\n\r\nresolved  in  the interest of the population  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker, concerns the\r\n\r\namenities in the rural areas. Having regard to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment programme to make roads in the kampongs,\r\n\r\nI  sent in my request to the authorities concerned,\r\n\r\nstating  that the kampong people were  prepared  to\r\n\r\ncooperate with the Government if they were provided\r\n\r\nwith  materials, earth and other equipment to  make\r\n\r\nroads in the rural areas. However, I regret to  say\r\n\r\nthat  up  to  today there are still  roads  in  the\r\n\r\nconstituency which I represent - and I would like  to\r\n\r\nmention a particular road, Jalan Lapang, which is a\r\n\r\nmajor  road - which are flooded whenever it rains.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to bring home to the Government the fact\r\n\r\nthat  it  is important not to treat the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore as being second-class citizens or  first-class    citizens.   Rural   amenities   are    the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  the Government.  Such  problems\r\n\r\ncould  be  overcome.  From the  point  of  view  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  the  money spent on  Hong  Lim  Green\r\n\r\ncould  be  better used for the development  of  the\r\n\r\nrural areas. I do not know whether this is a tactic\r\n\r\nor  manoeuvre  with  regard to personalities.  This\r\n\r\nwill be judged by the masses. I urge the Government\r\n\r\nto  develop the rural areas in the interest of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Government has said that in its rural programme, the farms especially the Malay\r\n\r\nfarms,   are   considered  private  property,   and\r\n\r\ntherefore the Government does not wish to waste its\r\n\r\nmoney  on  helping to improve the living conditions\r\n\r\nof  the  people in that area. However, the previous\r\n\r\nGovernment opened up roads and made improvements to\r\n\r\nthe  rural  areas, in spite of the fact  that  they\r\n\r\nwere  considered private property. But the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment, I know, has made newspaper releases  to\r\n\r\nthe  effect  that it is private property  and  that\r\n\r\nnothing  could be done about it. I cannot see  why,\r\n\r\nif   the   previous  Government  under  the  Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitution\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould  undertake  this job, the present  Government\r\n\r\nelected  by the people could not undertake the  job\r\n\r\nin the interest of the people. Is it because of the\r\n\r\nshortage  of  money? As I have said earlier,  money\r\n\r\nsaved,  for instance, on the Hong Lim Green project\r\n\r\ncould  be  usefully utilized in the development  of\r\n\r\nthe rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another big problem, Mr Speaker, Sir, is the\r\n\r\nsubject  of the national language which appears  in\r\n\r\ncol. 19 of the Hansard dated 20th July, 1960:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In implementing the policy of Malay as the\r\n\r\nNational  Language,  the task of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  has been to provide training  facilities\r\n\r\nfor  the  teaching  of  the language  in  non-Malay\r\n\r\nschools.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In   this  matter,  Mr  Speaker,  I  merely   seek\r\n\r\nclarification   again   because   I   am   not    a\r\n\r\nconstitutional lawyer. What I know is that  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation   of  Malaya  the  Malay   language   is\r\n\r\nacknowledged   as   the   national   and   official\r\n\r\nlanguage - the  sole national language - after  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen   written   into  the  Constitution   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya. In Singapore  today  is  the\r\n\r\nMalay  language - the  national language - official  or\r\n\r\nnot?  Will  the  Government table a  Bill  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  so that Malay will become officially  the\r\n\r\nnational language, or do we have to go back to  the\r\n\r\nColonial Office and have them accept Malay  as  the\r\n\r\nnational  language? From many points of view,  this\r\n\r\nwill  not be a satisfactory answer to the political\r\n\r\norganisation which I represent. So I hope it  could\r\n\r\nbe  clarified whether the Malay language, which  is\r\n\r\nacknowledged  as  the national language,  could  be\r\n\r\nconsidered as an official language according to the\r\n\r\nrules of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of language is a\r\n\r\nvery  big one and the responsibility facing  us  is\r\n\r\nheavy.  I,  for  one,  do not say  that  the  Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage  cannot  become the national  language  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  the official language to be used  at  all\r\n\r\nlevels,  although  there are certain  quarters  who\r\n\r\nmaintain  that  not  only  must  Malay  become  the\r\n\r\nnational and official language but that it must  be\r\n\r\nimplemented forthwith as the national and  official\r\n\r\nlanguage.  The Government has failed to state  when\r\n\r\nMalay  could  become the official  language.  Hence\r\n\r\nthis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nposes  a question. This should be made clear to  us\r\n\r\nso that we could give our support, and it will also\r\n\r\nbe  a  source  of  inspiration to  people  who  are\r\n\r\ninterested in promoting the national language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, Mr Speaker, there is this\r\n\r\nmatter  of culture. I hope the Minister for Culture\r\n\r\nwill   clarify  the  appeal  forwarded   by   Malay\r\n\r\norganisations  and  which appeared  in  the  Berita\r\n\r\nHarian. This is to make Malay culture the basis  of\r\n\r\na  Malayan  culture. I refer to the issue  of  30th\r\n\r\nJuly  of the Berita Harian. The news item says that\r\n\r\nthe  permanent Malay Literary Congress of Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  been asked to implement a resolution taken  by\r\n\r\nthe  25 youth associations which held a meeting  on\r\n\r\nthe  17th  July at the Geylang Community Centre.  I\r\n\r\nwould add, Mr Speaker, that this resolution reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That this Conference calls upon the Congress to\r\n\r\nhold  a  delegates conference of all Malay cultural\r\n\r\nbodies   to  discuss  the  implementation  of   the\r\n\r\nstruggle  of this permanent Congress in the  matter\r\n\r\nof making Malay as the base of a national culture.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the appeal has been submitted by the non-political cultural and arts bodies to see\r\n\r\nwhether  their  proposal could be accepted  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  its  attempt to evolve  a  national\r\n\r\nculture,  but until today we have not received  any\r\n\r\nconfirmation from the Government that Malay culture\r\n\r\nwill  be made the basis of a national culture.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, on the question of culture, perhaps  there\r\n\r\nare  many Members in this Assembly who are experts.\r\n\r\nWill  this  proposal have the support of those  who\r\n\r\nare responding to Malay culture, Chinese culture or\r\n\r\nany  other  culture, and can the demand that  Malay\r\n\r\nculture be made the basis of a national culture  be\r\n\r\naccepted as logical? I am not surprised at all if I\r\n\r\nam  accused of being illogical and out of place  by\r\n\r\nbringing   this  matter  up,  because   the   Malay\r\n\r\npopulation  represents only 13  per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  population.  Would it be  possible  for  the\r\n\r\nculture of a small percentage of the population  to\r\n\r\nbe  made  the  basis  of  a national  culture?  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  if  the Government could  accept  such  a\r\n\r\nsuggestion,   then,   although   there    may    be\r\n\r\ndifficulties, ways and means could be devised of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\novercoming  them. I am not coercing the  Government\r\n\r\nto accept this suggestion, but by encouraging Malay\r\n\r\nculture - whether it is accepted as  a  basis  for  a\r\n\r\nMalayan culture or otherwise - we would then not only\r\n\r\nlook  after  the special privileges of  the  Malays\r\n\r\nprovided for in the Constitution, but it would also\r\n\r\nbe  a method whereby we could demonstrate and prove\r\n\r\nour loyalty to the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the people of Singapore could accept\r\n\r\nthe  contents of the Constitution of the Federation\r\n\r\nof Malaya. So today, Mr Speaker, as one who at one\r\n\r\ntime opposed and fought against colonialism, I hope\r\n\r\nI  will  not be a stumbling block towards Singapore\r\n\r\nattaining  independence. We have to choose  between\r\n\r\nCommunism and British colonialism. It depends  upon\r\n\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I admit that the speech of the Prime Minister of\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  revealed that  he  is  prepared  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  the fight against pro-Communist elements;\r\n\r\nbut  I  ask  once again, why is he not prepared  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to fight for an anti-Communist policy,  if\r\n\r\nwe  are to resolve the problem of independence  for\r\n\r\nSingapore? It is a fact that today `the  island  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  become a front.  Whether  it  is  a\r\n\r\nCommunist  or a colonial front depends on  us,  the\r\n\r\nindigenous  people, whether they  comprise  Malays,\r\n\r\nChinese, Indians, Eurasians or others. Why must  we\r\n\r\nbe  afraid  of pro-Communist or Communist elements,\r\n\r\nor be afraid of the British colonialists or British\r\n\r\nArmy  which we find in Singapore? We are not afraid\r\n\r\nof  arms  that are in the possession of  the  Army.\r\n\r\nSingapore'   was   handed  over  to   the   British\r\n\r\nGovernment by Sir Stamford Raffles by a  stroke  of\r\n\r\nthe pen. And it is up to us to declare war on them,\r\n\r\nparticularly the colonialists, by means of pen  and\r\n\r\npaper.  It is not difficult for us to resolve  this\r\n\r\nproblem  if we are bold enough to come forward  and\r\n\r\ndeclare  our  stand. I am sure that  if  today  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party could be courageous enough to\r\n\r\ndeclare  its anti-Communist policy, then  it  would\r\n\r\nget  the support of the Malay organisation  that  I\r\n\r\nrepresent.  Regardless of what party it represents,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is going to be a coalition  government\r\n\r\nafter 1964, the Government of the day must face\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficulties. It is a fact that nobody can  fulfill\r\n\r\nthe needs of the whole population of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not know whether trade will increase, but\r\n\r\nthe  problem is, how are we going to meet the needs\r\n\r\nof   the   people?  I  can  say  that  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot meet the needs of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  100  per cent. The Prime  Minister  said\r\n\r\njust  now  that 80,000 British and Indian  soldiers\r\n\r\nsurrendered to the Japanese army after the Japanese\r\n\r\nhad  captured  the  reservoir in  Johore.  This  is\r\n\r\ntangible   proof  to  us  that  if  we  know   that\r\n\r\nconditions  in Singapore at present are  difficult,\r\n\r\nthen  why are we hesitating to use one method which\r\n\r\nwill get the blessing of the Federation `of Malaya?\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, the Federation of Malaya, I would like\r\n\r\nto   say,  looks  upon  Singapore  with  suspicion,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  number of Malays here as compared  to\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  are  very few. If Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation  are united and they have this  one  man\r\n\r\none vote, then the Federation of Malaya will become\r\n\r\na republic and its constitution changed. We will be\r\n\r\nloyal and faithful to our motherland and we will be\r\n\r\nprepared  to defend her in any way. Let  us  today,\r\n\r\nwhen  we  know that militant Communism is  not  yet\r\n\r\nfinished  in the Federation of Malaya, declare  our\r\n\r\nstand.  Whether this is right or wrong,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  alone  knows. I do not know  whether  the\r\n\r\nCommunists receive aid from Singapore,  but  it  is\r\n\r\nour responsibility to see that they do not. How are\r\n\r\nwe  going  to create a new peaceful and  prosperous\r\n\r\nnation  if  we  are ideologically opposed  to  each\r\n\r\nother?  So, Mr Speaker, I sincerely hope that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will overcome these dangerous  elements.\r\n\r\nWhether these elements are dangerous or not  it  is\r\n\r\nleft  to the people to assess. It is hoped  that  a\r\n\r\nmore  intensive campaign will be launched  to  kill\r\n\r\nthe Communist elements or their supporters and that\r\n\r\ntogether  we  will eliminate Communist elements  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I  am  here to support  fully  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's motion  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  thanks to the Yang di.Pertuan Negara  for\r\n\r\nhis speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member on the opposite side made a\r\n\r\nvery  lengthy  speech containing many  accusations.\r\n\r\nAfterwards  my  colleagues  here  will  give  clear\r\n\r\nreplies to the accusations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to reply to some of the accusations\r\n\r\nregarding the rural area levelled by him.  We  know\r\n\r\nthat in Singapore the rural area is larger than the\r\n\r\nCity  area. Because of this, care of the rural area\r\n\r\nis  especially difficult. The former Government did\r\n\r\nnot  take  good care of the rural area.  Since  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has only come into power for a short period\r\n\r\nof over one year, it is impossible for it to take a\r\n\r\n100  per  cent good care of the rural area. Whether\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.,  since it came into power,  has  taken\r\n\r\ncare of the rural area, it is a question which  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore can clearly answer.  The  fact\r\n\r\nhas  been observed by the people of Singapore  with\r\n\r\nopen eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kampong Kembangan area which the hon. Member\r\n\r\nmentioned is near the City area and is so small, so\r\n\r\nthe  work involved there may not be entirely as  he\r\n\r\nhas said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the Member for the Jurong constituency which\r\n\r\nis  quite  big in area. Some of the people  in  the\r\n\r\nremote parts of `that area have to walk one or  two\r\n\r\ntrifles  to get to the nearest standpipe. Owing  to\r\n\r\npast  negligence,  care is not well  given  at  the\r\n\r\npresent  moment. It is not that we do not  want  to\r\n\r\ngive  care.  First  of all, we  must  consider  the\r\n\r\nfinances  of  the  State. If the  State's  finances\r\n\r\npermit,  we  will  do our best. I  believe  that  a\r\n\r\nresponsible Government has to look after a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmatters,  not  just  a few, and  there  will  arise\r\n\r\nvarious problems. We have the faith and the ability\r\n\r\nto  overcome  some of those problems  in  the  near\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding other problems, my colleagues will give\r\n\r\nmore exhaustive and clear answers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

What I mean is\r\n\r\nthat  the  people of Singapore, although comprising\r\n\r\nvarious  origins,  have come to  realise  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has been able to bring about  unity  in\r\n\r\nthe  field of education, as stated in column 20  of\r\n\r\nthe Hansard (Volume 13, No. 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past various schools\r\n\r\nwere proud of the opportunities given to them,  but\r\n\r\nnow they realise that the advantages enjoyed before\r\n\r\ncannot  hold good any more, because the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  given  equal status to all the four  media  of\r\n\r\neducation, from primary school to secondary  school\r\n\r\nand  then  to  university level.  Furthermore,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  when  pupils  study  in  the   same\r\n\r\nbuilding  and  play together, the realisation  will\r\n\r\nnaturally  come  about that they  are  Malayans.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that the unification of these schools  will\r\n\r\nbe further carried out in 1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan has stated that\r\n\r\nthere  are  rumours that free education  is  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  Malay children in Singapore.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand,  Mr Speaker, Sir, why the hon.  Member\r\n\r\nis still unable to follow what has been achieved by\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  It is possible  that  he  has  no\r\n\r\nchildren  of  his own and is therefore ignorant  of\r\n\r\nthe  steps  which have already been  taken  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in giving free education. Even  if  the\r\n\r\nhon. Member does have children, he, in his capacity\r\n\r\nas  a  representative of the people, should realise\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government has taken steps to give  free\r\n\r\neducation   to   the  children.  As  regards   free\r\n\r\neducation to Malay children, Mr Speaker, Sir, this\r\n\r\nmatter  was widely publicised in the papers on  6th\r\n\r\nFebruary, 1960 stating that all children\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nborn  in  Singapore or whose parents are  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  attending Government or  Government-aided\r\n\r\nschools   will   be  given  free   education.   The\r\n\r\nnewspapers  have published this fact; so  also  has\r\n\r\nthe  radio  announced that free education  will  be\r\n\r\ngiven  as  from  the month of February.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand,  therefore, why the Member for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan,   representing   the   people   of   his\r\n\r\nconstituency, cannot follow what has  already  been\r\n\r\nannounced by the Government. The P.A.P. Government is\r\n\r\nunlike  the  former Government which merely  stated\r\n\r\nthings  but  did  not  carry them  out.  When  this\r\n\r\nGovernment says something, it will carry it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards free textbooks, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nequally  surprised  that  the  Member  for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan cannot follow what has been stated by the\r\n\r\nGovernment - that free textbooks will be given to the\r\n\r\nchildren.  In column 406 of the Hansard  dated  2nd\r\n\r\nMarch,  1960,  the  Minister for Education  gave  a\r\n\r\nreply to a question raised by an hon. Member,  that\r\n\r\nthe total allocation for free textbooks for 1960 is\r\n\r\n$150,000 and that the allocation for Malay children\r\n\r\nis  double  that for non-Malay children. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthis  means,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that  if  non-Malay\r\n\r\nchildren  are  allocated $300, then Malay  children\r\n\r\nare allocated $600, which is double that figure. It\r\n\r\nis  clear, therefore, that free textbooks have been\r\n\r\ngiven  to  all  strata of the Malay  population  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also succeeded in giving free\r\n\r\neducation  to  over-aged  children.  Just  as  free\r\n\r\neducation   is   given  from  primary   school   to\r\n\r\nuniversity level, likewise Malay children who  have\r\n\r\npassed the Higher School Certificate Examination in\r\n\r\nthe  past  year are now' attending the  University.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Member for Kampong Kembangan is unaware\r\n\r\nof  this,  because his own child has  not  attained\r\n\r\nthat  status  yet, but I believe that  children  in\r\n\r\nsecondary   schools  are  given   free   education.\r\n\r\nLikewise,  Malay students attending the  University\r\n\r\nare given assistance to get free education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  on 1st July, 1959, His Excellency Sir William\r\n\r\nGoode   read  the  first  policy  speech   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.

Not  only  did\r\n\r\nthe  building projects prove to be still-born,  but\r\n\r\nthe education plans have thrown the whole education\r\n\r\nsystem  into  a chaotic mess. At this time  of  the\r\n\r\nyear,  Sir, teachers are moved from one  school  to\r\n\r\nanother  like  pawns  on  a  chessboard.  Only  two\r\n\r\nprimary  schools  were built;  none  completed.  No\r\n\r\nsecondary  or  technical schools  were  built.  The\r\n\r\nprevious government, in their first year of office,\r\n\r\nstarted  building 30 schools; completed  9,  and  7\r\n\r\nwere  in  an  advanced stage of  construction.  The\r\n\r\nstandard  of education has deteriorated  miserably,\r\n\r\nas  proved  by  the poor results of  the  Cambridge\r\n\r\nExamination  last  year. Now, there  are  talks  of\r\n\r\nlowering the standard in the University of  Malaya.\r\n\r\nSir I would like\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  read  to  you the impression of  one  \"M.B.B.S.\r\n\r\n(Malaya).\"  He said, in the Straits Times  of  23rd\r\n\r\nJuly, 1960:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In fact, some doctors whose alma mater is the\r\n\r\nlocal medical school are very worried that if  this\r\n\r\nstate  of  affairs  continues the  General  Medical\r\n\r\nCouncil  may withdraw recognition of local  medical\r\n\r\ndegrees as so many departments are understaffed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are living on' our old reputation, that is\r\n\r\nall. It is time we woke up to this grim reality.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  I  am  no doctor; neither do I know  anything\r\n\r\nabout  this. When I read this, I felt that if there\r\n\r\nwas  any  truth in it, then it would be  a  serious\r\n\r\nstate of affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrangement for teaching of the various\r\n\r\nvernacular  languages in schools is gaily  muddling\r\n\r\nalong.  Something  must  be  done  to  prevent  the\r\n\r\nsuccesses  of  the  past becoming undone.  Hansard,\r\n\r\nVol. 13, No. 1, col. 5 says this Government:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"cannot permit itself the luxury of changing\r\n\r\nwith every puff of wind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>But  the Government has changed its aims and policy\r\n\r\nwith every puff of wind, Sir. When the P.A.P. first\r\n\r\ncame  into power, the civil servants were described\r\n\r\nby  the  Hon. the  Prime Minister as  devitalised,\r\n\r\nemasculated and deculturised. And when I  stood  up\r\n\r\nhere and defended them in my Adjournment speech,  I\r\n\r\nwas  mocked  by  the Government. Then,  one  bright\r\n\r\nmorning about a week later, with one puff of  wind,\r\n\r\nthe  civil  servants  were changed  by  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  from being an emasculated, deculturised\r\n\r\nand devitalised lot into the best civil service  in\r\n\r\nthe  Far  East. Another puff of wind seems to  have\r\n\r\nblown the P.A.P. Government from the masses to  the\r\n\r\npawnbrokers. And another puff of wind blew in about\r\n\r\n45  amendments to the Trade Unions Bill on the  day\r\n\r\nafter it was presented in this House. Something has\r\n\r\ngone wrong somewhere, Sir, if the Government is  to\r\n\r\nbe swayed like this with every puff of wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policies governing youth clubs and community\r\n\r\ncentres  were changed so often that civil  servants\r\n\r\nwere  unable  to get any activity in the  community\r\n\r\ncentres   until  quite  recently.  This   lull   of\r\n\r\ninactivity, I understand in many cases,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas driven away the original or old members who, in\r\n\r\nsome  cases, have been replaced by gangsters. There\r\n\r\nhave   been  instances  of  P.A.P.  Assemblymen\r\n\r\ncomplaining that these youth centres have been used\r\n\r\nby  the  gangsters as their dens. The  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational Development, needless to say, has been the\r\n\r\nmost  successful half-way house and  transit  camp,\r\n\r\nwhere no policy ever remains for long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's inconsistency, Sir, creates this\r\n\r\nquestion in the minds of the public - was the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment born under an inconsistent star, or  are\r\n\r\nthey  cooking  in a pressurised cooker?  After  the\r\n\r\nbravado  in  last  year's speech, Sir,  the  public\r\n\r\nexpected  to  hear the Government crow  about  the\r\n\r\nfulfilment of last year's promises in the speech of\r\n\r\nHis  Excellency  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  this\r\n\r\nyear. But there was no crowing, because cocks  only\r\n\r\ncrow  when  there is daylight. And  daylight  never\r\n\r\ncame. It never came from the time the P.A.P. came\r\n\r\ninto  power.  We have been living in 13  months  of\r\n\r\ndarkness, and are still living in darkness. So  the\r\n\r\ncock  never crowed. Instead, the Government had  to\r\n\r\nhumiliate  itself  into giving nonsensical  excuses\r\n\r\nsuch as \"Singapore is a small island\". Sir, we need\r\n\r\nno  Minister to tell us that. Surely we  all  learn\r\n\r\nthat in school, The Government's misdeeds, such  as\r\n\r\nthe  slashing of the salaries of the civil servants\r\n\r\nwithout  notice - believed by many to be a punishment\r\n\r\nto   them  because  they  did  not  vote  for   the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. - the  victimisation of people, especially  of\r\n\r\ncivil servants, who hold views different from those\r\n\r\nheld  by the P.A.P.; the waging of war against  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated for some time; the  steamrollering\r\n\r\nof Bills in this House without giving the public or\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition an opportunity to study them: these\r\n\r\nare so blatantly obvious, Sir, that the Government\r\n\r\nhas  been  forced  to admit them in  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's  speech and  to  promise  not  to\r\n\r\ncommit the same offences again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public would have forgiven the Government for\r\n\r\ntheir  past  sins  had they been sincere  in  their\r\n\r\napology  and promise. But, instead of any signs  of\r\n\r\nsincerity, Government tried to repeat their attempt\r\n\r\nto mislead the public. In,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHansard  of 20th July, 1960, col. 5, line  10,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  very  proudly declared that  \"Singapore\r\n\r\nhas   enjoyed   greater  political   and   economic\r\n\r\nstability  that  it has known during  the  last  15\r\n\r\nyears.\"  The Opposition challenges the statement - we\r\n\r\nmaintain  ,that  this  statement  is  a  deliberate\r\n\r\nattempt  to mislead the public. Government is  well\r\n\r\naware  that  there has neither been  political  nor\r\n\r\neconomic  stability in Singapore  since  they  came\r\n\r\ninto  power.  Even the collective leadership  which\r\n\r\nthey  boasted  has now splintered  officially  into\r\n\r\ntwo, perhaps virtually three, groups. The expulsion\r\n\r\nof three Members has not remedied the situation. It\r\n\r\nis  easy  to dismiss from their minds the existence\r\n\r\nof three Members whom they wish to forget. But, may\r\n\r\nI  remind  the Government, Sir, and ask them:  what\r\n\r\nabout  the  10,000  odd people  who  supported  the\r\n\r\nexpelled  Members  at  the Badminton  Stadium  last\r\n\r\nmonth?  How many thousands more might support  them\r\n\r\nif  Government gave them permission to hold a rally\r\n\r\nat  Hong  Lim? Can they just dismiss them all  from\r\n\r\nmemory  and  pretend they do not exist,  and  shout\r\n\r\nout,   \"We   are  enjoying  political   stability!\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, according to the Government, the split is\r\n\r\n40 against 3. If there is any truth in the speeches\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P. Assemblymen and Branch leaders at the\r\n\r\nBadminton Stadium last month, then the ratio of  40\r\n\r\nagainst  3  may  not last for long.  Can  there  be\r\n\r\npolitical stability, Sir? I do not know whether the\r\n\r\nMinisters  themselves  can  assure  us   how   many\r\n\r\nBackbenchers  are really and truly  with  them,  or\r\n\r\nwhether  they are ruling supreme. Perhaps time  can\r\n\r\ntell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State of Singapore has become so unsafe, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  millionaires  had  to  be  warned  to  employ\r\n\r\nbodyguards,  and school-children had  to  be  given\r\n\r\nanti-kidnap drill. A Judge admitted in  Court  that\r\n\r\ncrime has become a national past-time in Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  one  of the leaders in the Straits Times  said\r\n\r\nthat  hardly  a day passed without a serious  crime\r\n\r\nbeing  committed in Singapore. This,  Sir,  is  the\r\n\r\n\"stability\"  that Singapore is enjoying  under  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the economic stability that Singapore is\r\n\r\nenjoying under the Government, it comprises capital\r\n\r\nflying  away from Singapore. This has been admitted\r\n\r\nby Government several times. Of course, they blamed\r\n\r\nthe Opposition and said that it was because of what\r\n\r\nthey  called  our  stupid  utterances  at  election\r\n\r\ncampaigns  that  had  been  responsible  for  this.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, capital has flown away. They admitted\r\n\r\nit.  Factories  and  firms are  closing  down,  Big\r\n\r\ncommercial  firms have moved their headquarters  to\r\n\r\nKuala   Lumpur.   Building  projects   are   at   a\r\n\r\nstandstill,  and small businesses are  folding  up.\r\n\r\nTaxis are plying round and round without any fare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Maybe the Opposition went for joy\r\n\r\nrides!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Unemployment is increasing\r\n\r\nat  an accelerating speed to the big figure that we\r\n\r\nheard  this morning.

The   sense   of\r\n\r\noppression,  humiliation and resentment  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  created by the P.A.P.

All that\r\n\r\nwe have seen in the steps that they have taken were\r\n\r\nto  get  rid  of  the experts and specialists  from\r\n\r\nseveral Government departments. And, continuing, it\r\n\r\nseems  \"the  Government does not wish to  give  the\r\n\r\nimpression  that there have not been  mistakes  and\r\n\r\nshortcomings during the past year.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow  could they, Sir? The mistakes and shortcomings\r\n\r\nwere so blatantly obvious. It claimed that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is aware that some of its measures should\r\n\r\nhave  been  more  carefully  planned  and  expertly\r\n\r\nexecuted. In some instances, it moved too fast  and\r\n\r\nwithout preparing public opinion adequately for the\r\n\r\nchanges,  Some  of  the  legislation  resulted   in\r\n\r\ninconveniences  or  misunderstandings  which  could\r\n\r\nhave  been  avoided by a little more  foresight,  a\r\n\r\nlittle  more consultation, discussion and a  little\r\n\r\nmore explanation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  if they were aware of this, then why did they\r\n\r\nmock   and   insult  us,  and  even  threaten   the\r\n\r\nOpposition when the Opposition tried to point  this\r\n\r\nout  to them some time ago? You will remember, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat on two occasions you had to intervene when the\r\n\r\nHon, the Prime Minister attempted to threaten  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin. The Government say  that  the\r\n\r\nerrors  arose from the zeal and impatience  to  get\r\n\r\nthings  done. May I suggest that in some  cases,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  they  were  the result  of  vengeance  and\r\n\r\nvictimization too? Government now promise to temper\r\n\r\nzeal with understanding. Let us hope that they will\r\n\r\nkeep their promise this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same Hansard, Sir, of this year, the\r\n\r\nparagraph  on  Finance stated  that  \"there  was  a\r\n\r\ndeficit  looming  on the horizon\" - talking  of  last\r\n\r\nyear.  This  is one of the false alarms with  which\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government has been trying to  frighten\r\n\r\nthe  people. They hoped that by so doing they could\r\n\r\nlay   the   blame   of  all  their   failures   and\r\n\r\nshortcomings  on the previous Government.  This  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  straight  deal with the  public,  Sir.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is aware that the Budgets for the last  few\r\n\r\nyears have shown a deficit but have ended up with a\r\n\r\nsurplus. But the P.A.P. Government prefers  to  use\r\n\r\nthe  deficit  shown  in last year's  Budget  as  an\r\n\r\nexcuse  to  slash  the salaries of  the  Government\r\n\r\nservants. This slash, Sir, has to a certain  extent\r\n\r\nbeen   responsible   for   the   present   economic\r\n\r\ndepression  in  Singapore, while the Federation  is\r\n\r\nenjoying a boom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government believe that there has been\r\n\r\nconsiderable uncertainty as to the stability of the\r\n\r\npolitical  foundation of the State, and this,  they\r\n\r\nsay, has led to hesitation on the part of potential\r\n\r\ninvestors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  can assure you, Sir, that potential investors do\r\n\r\nnot  hesitate any more. They have gone into  action\r\n\r\nnow.  They  have  flown from this country.  Malaya,\r\n\r\nsays  Government, \"then looked upon the  events  in\r\n\r\nSingapore with some reservation.\" Are we sure, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  Malaya is not still looking upon us with some\r\n\r\nreservation?  If  not,  then  why  did  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  have  to say over a radio programme,  and\r\n\r\nagain this morning I believe, that merger will  not\r\n\r\ntake place in the immediate foreseeable future?  It\r\n\r\nis because he realises that Malaya is still looking\r\n\r\nupon  us  with  some  reservation.  The  Government\r\n\r\nboasted  that  the  \"far-sighted  policies  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment announced last year were firmly  carried\r\n\r\nout  and in 12 short months we have seen a complete\r\n\r\nreversal   of  position.\"  The  only  reversal   of\r\n\r\nposition  that  the public has seen,  Sir,  is  the\r\n\r\nreversal of the economic stability of the past into\r\n\r\nthe  present economic depression; the living in the\r\n\r\nfreedom  of the past into the living of the  terror\r\n\r\nof  today; the atmosphere of friendliness into  the\r\n\r\natmosphere of suspicion and hate of today. We  have\r\n\r\nnow,  I  am afraid almost gone back to life  during\r\n\r\nthe  Japanese  Occupation. The Government  declared\r\n\r\nthat: \"The atmosphere of uncertainty and hesitation\r\n\r\nin  the field of private investment was replaced by\r\n\r\na  climate of confidence.\" May I ask, Sir, how much\r\n\r\nof  the capital that has flown away has come  back?\r\n\r\nAnd if any has come back, why are we having so many\r\n\r\nunemployed?  Government  gave  as  proof  of   this\r\n\r\nclimate  of  confidence the substantial  volume  of\r\n\r\nprivate   investment  now  seeking  permission   to\r\n\r\noperate in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in last year's Hansard, Vol. 11, No. 1,\r\n\r\ncolumn 7, it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government has in the few brief weeks of\r\n\r\noffice received numerous enquiries from foreign and\r\n\r\nlocal  firms  who want to' set up new factories  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  now  they are still wanting, and I  hope  they\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  still in the wanting stage  by  next\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government promises the extension of economic\r\n\r\nservices,   such  as  power,  water,  gas   supply,\r\n\r\nconstruction of roads, improvement to the port  and\r\n\r\nairport  and  the Singapore river,  enlargement  of\r\n\r\ntelecommunications facilities, provision of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustrial   sites  and  so  forth,  as   well   as\r\n\r\ninvestment in the social services, the main item of\r\n\r\nwhich will be housing. As I have said before,  Sir,\r\n\r\nlast  year they promised to make an all-out  effort\r\n\r\nto ease the housing problem, and all that they have\r\n\r\nbuilt were 124 houses compared with 6,734 built  in\r\n\r\n1955, the first year of the previous Government. If\r\n\r\nthis  promise  is  as  bottomless  as  last  year's\r\n\r\npromise,  I am sure the public will lose confidence\r\n\r\nin Government,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government also warned that they would exercise\r\n\r\nstrict  economy in annually recurrent  expenditure.\r\n\r\nThe  last  time these words were uttered, Sir,  the\r\n\r\ncivil   servants   suffered  a   slash   in   their\r\n\r\nallowances,  I am sure they will be very  happy  if\r\n\r\nthe  Government will assure them that this  is  not\r\n\r\nanother such warning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of the factors which generate\r\n\r\nconfidence and stimulate industrial expansion  must\r\n\r\nbe  a  firm and stable government whose policy  and\r\n\r\nactions  are  consistent and  predictable.  Another\r\n\r\nprecious   philosophy  of   the   P.A.P.!   It   is\r\n\r\nincredible,  Sir,  that  they  are  known  as   the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party, and yet I do not find  their\r\n\r\nphilosophy being put into action, For example, they\r\n\r\nsay  that Government policy must be consistent  and\r\n\r\npredictable. And yet while preaching against yellow\r\n\r\nculture,   they  encourage  gambling;  and   whilst\r\n\r\ntelling millionaires to have bodyguards because  of\r\n\r\nthe  danger of frequent kidnappings today,  in  the\r\n\r\nsame  breath they say that times are so much better\r\n\r\nthat they are going to withdraw small firearms from\r\n\r\nthe  people.  Then  while the  civil  servants  are\r\n\r\nsuffering  from  pay cuts and the public  from  the\r\n\r\nshortage  of schools, hospitals, teachers, doctors,\r\n\r\nnurses;   over   50,000  people   are   unemployed;\r\n\r\nthousands  are living in the slums; and  while  the\r\n\r\nState  of  Singapore  is experiencing  an  economic\r\n\r\ndepression;  and  whilst crime and  kidnapping  are\r\n\r\nrampant,  the Government is concentrating  on  such\r\n\r\nfrivolous  projects  as  amusement  and  recreation\r\n\r\nparks  at Kallang and Hong Lim, and on a first-rate\r\n\r\ntheatre to compete with Rome and a first-class bowl\r\n\r\nto  compete  with  Hollywood, and the  Aneka  Ragam\r\n\r\nRa'ayat to entertain the hungry.

How  can  we  hope  to  attract\r\n\r\ninvestors  with  such  a  frivolous  programme   of\r\n\r\nactivity? It is Government's belief that a  further\r\n\r\nimportant  factor  is  the  stability  in   labour-employer relationship. It is our belief, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthis  cannot  be  achieved by Government-controlled\r\n\r\ntrade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Government continues to promise \"to avoid\r\n\r\ntaking any action that will damage our trade.\" Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  are  afraid that this action has  already  been\r\n\r\ntaken.  Trade  has already receded to  an  alarming\r\n\r\nextent  in  Singapore.  There  has  been  no  trade\r\n\r\nrecession, generally speaking, in the areas  around\r\n\r\nSingapore.   As  a  matter  of  fact,   Malaya   is\r\n\r\nexperiencing a boom. Why is Singapore going through\r\n\r\nan  economic depression? The answer is, of  course,\r\n\r\npeople  have  no  confidence in the Government,  as\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  deprived  the  minority  of  their\r\n\r\nrights,  and speaks in proud, haughty and  arrogant\r\n\r\nterms,  as  were used last year in the speeches  on\r\n\r\n21st  July,  1959. In Hansard, Volume  11,  No.  6,\r\n\r\ncolumns  355  and 356, speaking of the  Opposition,\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...we are not really concerned with them...they have\r\n\r\nceased  to  matter.they are there like  gunny-bags,\r\n\r\nwhich I used to see in Japanese-occupied Singapore,\r\n\r\nstrung across the field for Japanese soldiers to do\r\n\r\nbayonet  practices.

The\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members  have  not  been  appointed  by\r\n\r\nGovernment.  They  too have  been  elected  by  the\r\n\r\npeople who, though in the minority, are citizens of\r\n\r\nSingapore and who have the right to cast their vote\r\n\r\nand  the right to choose their own representatives,\r\n\r\nand  to  have  their representatives recognised  by\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Now, how can they have any  confidence\r\n\r\nin  a  Government which ignores the rights  of  the\r\n\r\nminority, which declares that their representatives\r\n\r\nhave  ceased to matter, and that the Government  is\r\n\r\nnot  concerned  with  them?  How  can  people  have\r\n\r\nconfidence   in  a  Government  that   makes   such\r\n\r\ndeclarations? Sir, after what\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  appeared in the papers and in the Petir  about\r\n\r\nthe  quarrel or the split in the P.A.P.,  you  will\r\n\r\nremember  that it is these \"dead ducks  and  gunny-bags\"  on the Opposition Bench that tried  to  warn\r\n\r\nGovernment of the suicide that the ex-Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational  Development was plunging Singapore  into.\r\n\r\nAnd  the Government deliberately misled the  public\r\n\r\nby  shielding  him. They themselves  have  admitted\r\n\r\nthis, Sir, in their Party organ. And now Government\r\n\r\nhave made exactly the same charges as those made by\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition. Sir, the \"dead ducks\" were not  so\r\n\r\ndead  after all! Not as dead as the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\ntried to make them out to be. The \"gunny-bags\" were\r\n\r\nright.  And  it was the Government which  tried  to\r\n\r\nconceal  from the public the shortcomings of  their\r\n\r\nParty  member  and which had used the strongest  of\r\n\r\nterms  against the Opposition in order  to  silence\r\n\r\nthem.   The  Government  have  now  revealed  their\r\n\r\ninsincerity,  and  the public  has  no  longer  any\r\n\r\nconfidence  in them. If they are sincere,  Sir,  in\r\n\r\ntheir promise to avoid taking any action that  will\r\n\r\ndamage  the trade of Singapore, they will endeavour\r\n\r\nto   behave  in  a  manner  befitting  sincere  and\r\n\r\ndignified statesmen and avoid employing the tactics\r\n\r\nof cheap politicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government have assured us that during the year\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Telephone Board proposes to  connect\r\n\r\ntelephones  to kampongs and villages in  the  urban\r\n\r\nand   rural  areas.  Sir,  in  view  of  the   many\r\n\r\naccusations  flung by one Minister  at  another  of\r\n\r\nfavouritism,  we, the Opposition, hope  that  these\r\n\r\nvillages  and kampongs do not mean P.A.P. villages\r\n\r\nand P.A.P. kampongs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Board is said to have given out\r\n\r\ncontracts  for the construction of 4,000 units.  It\r\n\r\nis  said  to  have  drawn up a  five-year  building\r\n\r\nprogramme providing for the construction of  52,000\r\n\r\nunits  at  an estimated total cost of $210  million\r\n\r\nover  the  period  1960-1964, and 1,811  units,  it\r\n\r\nseems,  will be completed by the end of this  year.\r\n\r\nSir, we have been hearing so much\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  contracts and construction costs, and  units\r\n\r\nto  be  completed ever since the P.A.P.

We\r\n\r\nhope  that  1960  will  not  be  another  year   of\r\n\r\nstill-borns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been promised that stand-pipes will be\r\n\r\ninstalled  in  remote areas. May I  make  a  humble\r\n\r\nsuggestion, Sir? I have seen how the water from the\r\n\r\nstandpipes on roads has been allowed to run without\r\n\r\nstop.  I  am  sure the poor people  would  be  much\r\n\r\nhappier  if  Government would bring the pipes  into\r\n\r\ntheir  houses.  It  would also serve  to  ease  the\r\n\r\nstrain  on the reservoir during the drought.  I  am\r\n\r\nquite  sure, Sir, that the poor people  prefer  the\r\n\r\nstandpipes  to  be in their houses. Standpipes  are\r\n\r\ngood, no doubt, but it is better if they are in the\r\n\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. M.

They are\r\n\r\nbetter  than  standpipes on the road,  because  the\r\n\r\npeople will not have to go to the standpipes to get\r\n\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, we are told, will reintroduce the\r\n\r\nWomen's Charter Bill. Sir, the Opposition wishes to\r\n\r\nreiterate  its stand. We support the  principle  of\r\n\r\nmonogamous marriage. But we say that the method  of\r\n\r\nimplementing  it  must be practical  and  must  not\r\n\r\ncause hardship to the public. The Charter must  not\r\n\r\nbe  used as a means to bring extra revenue  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment at the expense of the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said, Sir, that the periodical joint\r\n\r\ndiscussions   between  Assemblymen,  the   people's\r\n\r\nrepresentatives,  and  the divisional  police  have\r\n\r\nproved to be a step in the right direction. I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  point out that Members of the  Opposition\r\n\r\nhave   received  one  invitation  to   meet   their\r\n\r\ndivisional  police  officer,  but  we  know  of  no\r\n\r\nperiodical  joint  discussions between  Assemblymen\r\n\r\nand their divisional police officer. Privileges and\r\n\r\nopportunities  offered  to  P.A.P.  Assemblymen  at\r\n\r\npublic expense should, do you not think so, Sir, be\r\n\r\nafforded to Opposition Assemblymen also?

Community centres  are\r\n\r\nrun  on  public  funds, Sir,  I  repeat - not  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nfunds.  We  have no objection if they  are  run  on\r\n\r\nP.A.P. funds, Seeing that they are run  on  public\r\n\r\nfunds,  Sir, what right has the Government  to  use\r\n\r\npublic funds against public wishes? In areas  where\r\n\r\nnon-P.A.P. candidates have been elected,  it  is  a\r\n\r\nfact that the people in that area do not want to be\r\n\r\nrepresented by a P.A.P. member. And typical of  the\r\n\r\nunilateral  policy of the P.A.P.  Government,  they\r\n\r\nforce  the people to accept P.A.P. members as their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  and to ignore  the  representative\r\n\r\nthat  the  electorate in that area has  chosen.  In\r\n\r\nseveral instances, Sir, where a registered  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommunity  association  already   exists,\r\n\r\nGovernment, with just one single unilateral  sweep,\r\n\r\nhave  brushed aside hundreds of members  who  could\r\n\r\nhave  formed a nucleus of the new association.  And\r\n\r\nif  the group is not a pre-dominantly P.A.P. group,\r\n\r\nGovernment would manoeuvre it so that the community\r\n\r\nis  forced to accept selected P.A.P. members as the\r\n\r\nleaders,  in order to enjoy the facilities provided\r\n\r\nby   Government   in   community   centres.   These\r\n\r\nfacilities are provided at public expense, and the'\r\n\r\npublic  should  not be educated to  feel  that  the\r\n\r\nfacilities are charities dished out to  them  by  a\r\n\r\ncharitable  government. The public  have  paid  for\r\n\r\nthese facilities through their taxes and should not\r\n\r\nbe  treated  like beggars who are  not  allowed  to\r\n\r\nchoose their leaders and their representatives.  To\r\n\r\nexploit the electorate by using the taxes they  pay\r\n\r\nfor  party  propaganda, for  building  up  defeated\r\n\r\ncandidates   and   for  protecting   their   future\r\n\r\ncandidates  can  only  be  described  as  political\r\n\r\ncorruption  at  its highest level, played  only  by\r\n\r\npolitical  adventurers.  Now,  surely,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment does not claim to be one!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government claims, Sir, that it is aware that\r\n\r\nbribery  and  corruption have yet to be  completely\r\n\r\neliminated. We are not at all surprised, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  not been  able  to  eliminate\r\n\r\ncorruption  when we read Press editorials  such  as\r\n\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straits Times, 16th July, 1960:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The thought did occur at the time to some who\r\n\r\nwere not in P.A.P.'s ranks that Mr Ong was less of\r\n\r\na  success than he and P.A.P. claimed, The  party's\r\n\r\ndilemma,  for it was aware of the damage the  Mayor\r\n\r\nwas   doing,  was  obvious  and  painful,  and  the\r\n\r\nrecollection  of  it  finds early  mention  in  the\r\n\r\ncurrent issue of Petir...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`When finally the Labour Front or (S.P.A.)\r\n\r\nGovernment wanted to expose the Mayor, says Petir's\r\n\r\neditorial, \"it was the Party's stalwarts  who  came\r\n\r\nout and defended him and prevented his exposure  as\r\n\r\na  petty  pocket  Hitler.\" Personal  quarrels  with\r\n\r\nOpposition    Councillors   and   petty    personal\r\n\r\nintrigues,  the  editorial admits, were  among  the\r\n\r\nMayor's  \"stupidities.\" How much  better  it  would\r\n\r\nhave been if the party stalwarts had said so at the\r\n\r\ntime, and how much better for Singapore if when the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. government was formed, Mr  Ong's  peculiar\r\n\r\nqualities and weaknesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad been borne more carefully in mind...

Not  of  dwelling  houses,\r\n\r\nflats,   tenements,  factories,  business   houses,\r\n\r\nschools,  hospitals,  or  economic,  political   or\r\n\r\nindustrial development.

Government start\r\n\r\nusing  public funds for the good of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   and  not  for  P.A.P. propaganda   for\r\n\r\ndefeated candidates or possible future candidates,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would like to make this six-point recommendation:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. That Government gets down to the task of\r\n\r\nbuilding  houses  for the poor people.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  has built 124 in their  first  year  of\r\n\r\noffice  against  6,734  permanent  dwellings  built\r\n\r\nunder  the previous Government in their first  year\r\n\r\nof office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. That Government takes advantage of every means\r\n\r\nof  solving the unemployment problem. The  rate  of\r\n\r\nunemployment  has been accelerated at  an  alarming\r\n\r\nrate by Government inefficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. That Government utilises every available\r\n\r\nresource to combat crime in Singapore. Today  there\r\n\r\nis   no  sense  of  personal  safety.  Gangsterism,\r\n\r\nextortion, kidnapping, robbery and hooliganism have\r\n\r\nbecome national pastimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. That Government employs every method of\r\n\r\nfostering  among  the public a sense  of  security.\r\n\r\nToday there is no security of any type. Favouritism\r\n\r\nand victimisation seem to be the policy of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, look at this headline. This is what I mean\r\n\r\nby favouritism and victimisation. In big headlines,\r\n\r\nof the Straits Times of 28th July, 1960, it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"`I'm P.A.P.: Even officer with crown is scared\r\n\r\nof me' CONSTABLE: TAXI DRIVER TRIED TO MURDER ME\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  such things go on. This may be the only  case\r\n\r\nthat  has been given publicity. But everyone  knows\r\n\r\nthat  such types of cases take place every  day  at\r\n\r\nall levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. That Government does everything within its\r\n\r\npower to ensure political peace in Singapore.  What\r\n\r\npeace can the public have when two of the strongest\r\n\r\nmen  in Government are bitterly fighting each other\r\n\r\nfor  power?  Even if one can be forced out  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly, the fight may still go on, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. That Government restores to the State of\r\n\r\nSingapore  its  prosperity.  What  prosperity   can\r\n\r\nSingapore  enjoy, when capital has been driven  out\r\n\r\nof  the State by bad government policies, when  the\r\n\r\nchances  of  merger with the Federation  have  been\r\n\r\njeopardized by the extreme Leftist policy and  non-Communist  stand  of  the  P.A.P.  Government?  The\r\n\r\nspeech  of  Tungku Abdul Rahman, according  to  the\r\n\r\nStraits Times of the 1st of August, 1960, reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is not sufficient to be anti-Communist, and far\r\n\r\nless  to  be  non-Communist, as  some  weak  people\r\n\r\nprofess.  We  must  also stand up  and  be  staunch\r\n\r\nbelievers in Malayan democracy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  the  S.P.A. and U.M.N.O. Opposition  entirely\r\n\r\nagree  with  the  Tunku and give him  our  support.\r\n\r\nAfter  all, it is a Malayan nation based on Malayan\r\n\r\ndemocracy  that we want to build, and  not  a  non-Communist   nation  built  around  a  non-Communist\r\n\r\nideology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government will give this six-point\r\n\r\nrecommendation  its careful consideration  and  not\r\n\r\nuse  them as the Japanese used the gunny bags  just\r\n\r\nbecause they were suggested by the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff (Anson)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in support of the\r\n\r\nexpression of thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara\r\n\r\nfor the speech which he delivered at the opening of\r\n\r\nthe Second Session of this Assembly, I wish to take\r\n\r\nthis opportunity to comment on the speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the speech covers all\r\n\r\nMinistries and the programme which will be  carried\r\n\r\nout  as  policies of the P.A.P. Government  in  its\r\n\r\nsecond  year of office. In other words,  Sir,  this\r\n\r\nyear will be a year of construction. No longer will\r\n\r\nit  be  a year of re-organisation as it was in  the\r\n\r\npast.  I  believe  the Opposition  will  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  attack or  to  criticise  a  small\r\n\r\nsection  of  this  Government - I  repeat  \"a   small\r\n\r\nsection\" - for  the actions or the errors  that  have\r\n\r\nbeen committed during the past year. As a result of\r\n\r\nthis awakening, Sir, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  in\r\n\r\nhis  speech  has stated that the P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\ndoes  make  mistakes and commit  errors,  but  that\r\n\r\nthese mistakes and errors arose out of its zeal and\r\n\r\nimpatience  to get things done. But,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, let not the Opposition, or those people who do\r\n\r\nnot subscribe to or do not agree with the views  of\r\n\r\nthe  present  Government, close their eyes  to  the\r\n\r\nexcellent services that have been provided  in  the\r\n\r\nnational interest by the Government since  it  came\r\n\r\ninto  power. I am sure - and my colleagues will agree\r\n\r\nwith  me - that the Opposition Parties welcomed  many\r\n\r\nof  the Bills which have been passed. I have  often\r\n\r\nheard the Opposition praising the work done by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government. For instance, in the matter  of\r\n\r\ntrade, commerce, education, and the introduction of\r\n\r\nBills  in  this Assembly, the steps  taken  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment were not to meet the requirements  of  a\r\n\r\ncertain section of the population but to cater  for\r\n\r\nthe  entire  population as a whole,  including  the\r\n\r\nMalays - a subject which has been harped upon by some\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members, If they had taken the  trouble\r\n\r\nto  read  the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,\r\n\r\nthey  would have seen that the special position  of\r\n\r\nthe Malays was touched upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of finance which was raised by\r\n\r\nsome Members of the Opposition, it cannot be denied\r\n\r\nthat  the method of administration adopted  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government has resulted in a saving  of  $9\r\n\r\nmillion.  When  this Government took office,  there\r\n\r\nwas  not  a single cent in the coffers, but  now  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  sum  of  money has  been  saved.  The\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Finance  has  stated   on   several\r\n\r\noccasions  that  this is in the national  interest.\r\n\r\nThis cannot be denied by Members of the Opposition.\r\n\r\nWe  can criticise the ways and means or the methods\r\n\r\nby  which  we  have achieved this surplus,  but  we\r\n\r\ncannot  deny all the same that $9 million has  been\r\n\r\nsaved.   There   are  many  achievements   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that I could cite here,  but  it  would\r\n\r\ntake me too long to deal with them one by one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are many matters on which I would\r\n\r\nlike to touch upon here. On the question of helping\r\n\r\nthe  Malays,  there  is mention  in  column  13  of\r\n\r\nHansard dated 20th July, 1960, of assistance to  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to Malay fishermen. We are helping  them  to\r\n\r\nraise their standard of living. In column 14 of the\r\n\r\nsame Hansard, there is also mention of Muslim law:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government will introduce comprehensive\r\n\r\nlegislation  for the regulation of Muslim  marriage\r\n\r\nand  divorce  and Muslim religious affairs  on  the\r\n\r\nlines   of  legislation  in  the  States   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  have  personally  received letters  from  Malays\r\n\r\nexpressing  the commendability of such a  step  and\r\n\r\nadvising that such legislation should be undertaken\r\n\r\nforthwith  for  the regulation of Muslim  marriages\r\n\r\nand divorces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a very important subject which\r\n\r\nhas received great support is the implementation of\r\n\r\nMalay  as the national language. The P.A.P. is  not\r\n\r\nafraid to declare boldly that the national language\r\n\r\nin  Singapore is Malay. We believe that language is\r\n\r\nlike  a tree, because it is a means by which  human\r\n\r\nbeings  convey  their thoughts to  one  another.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to repeat that language is like a tree,\r\n\r\nand  in this connection the Ministry of Culture  is\r\n\r\nconfident  that the present policy of unifying  the\r\n\r\nexisting cultures in Singapore could\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  achieved.  This,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant,  because  the existence  of  a  national\r\n\r\nlanguage  will  not  only  integrate  the  existing\r\n\r\nvarious  cultures, but it will also be a  means  by\r\n\r\nwhich  the  various  races in  Singapore  could  be\r\n\r\nunited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Opposition Member has said that Raffles was\r\n\r\nnot  the founder of Singapore as he was a foreigner\r\n\r\nand  a  newcomer. Why did he not say  this  to  the\r\n\r\nMember for Geylang Serai before the latter went  on\r\n\r\na  mission to London? In my opinion, Sir, there  is\r\n\r\nno necessity to belabour this point. The problem in\r\n\r\nfront of us is to unify the various races and  weld\r\n\r\nthem  into one Malayan nation. I am a Malay. I have\r\n\r\nbeen here for many years, but as a member `of a non-communal party, I feel that the various races  must\r\n\r\nwork  together  so that a Malayan nation  could  be\r\n\r\nevolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of culture, Mr Speaker, Sir - I am\r\n\r\nattached to the Ministry of Culture - I would like to\r\n\r\nsay  that the programme carried out since last year\r\n\r\nwere  for the sole purpose of unifying the  various\r\n\r\nraces in Singapore to make them feel that they  are\r\n\r\ntrue  Malayans. There are many programme  which  we\r\n\r\nwould  like  to carry out in the future;  similarly\r\n\r\nthe programme which were carried out last year will\r\n\r\nbe  continued this year. For instance, in regard to\r\n\r\nthe  Aneka Ragam Ra'ayat, we will add a new feature\r\n\r\nto  our  programme as enunciated in  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's  speech on the  national  service\r\n\r\nnetwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Mr Speaker, the Member for Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan  has  said that there are  many  cultural\r\n\r\norganisations which have called upon  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Culture  to  accept Malay as the  basis  for  a\r\n\r\nMalayan  culture. I think the Member has  not  been\r\n\r\nfollowing closely what is meant by the basis for  a\r\n\r\nMalayan  culture. In April this year, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nthe  representatives  of  an  arts  group  had   an\r\n\r\ninterview  with  the  Minister  for  Culture.  They\r\n\r\nsubmitted  a  memorandum. At the same  time,  views\r\n\r\nwere exchanged in a cordial manner to find out what\r\n\r\nwas  the  object  of  the  arts  group.  After  the\r\n\r\ndiscussion, I was told by a member of the committee\r\n\r\nof the arts group that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresults  of  the discussion were very  satisfactory\r\n\r\nindeed. I would like to say here, Mr Speaker, that\r\n\r\nthe   representatives  of  the  arts   group   were\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with  the  answers  obtained  from   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture.  I am  surprised  that  the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Kampong  Kembangan  has   cause   for\r\n\r\ncomplaint. The contents of the letter, inter  alia,\r\n\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government will encourage and will give\r\n\r\nevery  support  to  Malay culture  and  will  cause\r\n\r\ninvestigations to be made on Malay culture.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So,  Mr  Speaker,  in  that way,  they  could  say\r\n\r\nfrankly  that the definition of \"basis\" means  that\r\n\r\nit  will take the form of a Malayan basis. It  does\r\n\r\nnot  mean  that joget modern could be  put  on  the\r\n\r\nstage  and called Malayan culture. That is not  the\r\n\r\ndefinition  given by the arts group. This  question\r\n\r\nshould  be asked together and the background should\r\n\r\nhave  a Malayan content. That is the interpretation\r\n\r\nof  the  \"basis\"  of  Malayan  culture.  There  are\r\n\r\nexperts  who say that Malayan culture  is  a  mixed\r\n\r\nculture and that the core of Malay culture has  its\r\n\r\nsource  from  Hindu culture, So, Mr  Speaker,  the\r\n\r\nobject  of  creating a Malayan culture through  the\r\n\r\nmedium  of the national language, which is  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  aims  of  the Government, will be achieved  in\r\n\r\nthis  manner.  Mr  Speaker,  if  this  is  made  a\r\n\r\ncommunal issue, 2,000 years working on it will  not\r\n\r\nbring  any result. Mr Speaker, this is a  part  of\r\n\r\nour  findings and we need to do a lot  of  research\r\n\r\ninto culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech [Hansard,\r\n\r\n20th July, 1960, col. 23], there is mention that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government has also plans to inaugurate a\r\n\r\nNational  Service  network.  At  the  moment  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore  broadcasts four language  programmes.The\r\n\r\nNational  Service  would  be  identified  with   no\r\n\r\nparticular language or cultural group. It will  try\r\n\r\nto reflect a Malayan outlook and content.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This, Mr Speaker, is an achievement of the present\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which is important in regard to\r\n\r\nculture   is   contained  in  the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's  speech  [Hansard, 20th July,  1960,  col.\r\n\r\n22]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government plans to establish, a National\r\n\r\nCultural  Brigade  in order to  give  positive  and\r\n\r\ncreative  impulse to Malayan art, music, drama  and\r\n\r\nso on. Members of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Brigade  will  consist of  artists,  painters,\r\n\r\nmusicians, dramatists and all those involved in the\r\n\r\narts  and  they will perform as well as  teach  and\r\n\r\norganise  dramatic,  musical and  dance  groups  in\r\n\r\ncommunity centres and cultural associations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr   Speaker,  this  has  been  welcomed  by  arts associations and I am sure that such schemes as are\r\n\r\nput up by the Government will be implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if it was our intention not to give our co-operation to create a Malayan culture, then\r\n\r\nI  believe  we  would not be able  to  achieve  our\r\n\r\nobjective,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe,  my colleagues and I, are sitting here on  this\r\n\r\nside  of the House today because the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhas  forced  us  to  sit here. He  has  evicted  us\r\n\r\nunconstitutionally  and  by  force,  and  that   is\r\n\r\nbecause  at  the moment he controls the Government.\r\n\r\nAnd  that is also because at the moment he controls\r\n\r\nthe  Police  and the whole machinery of the  State.\r\n\r\nOtherwise  the  position  today  could   be   quite\r\n\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, while I sat listening to the Government's policy speech delivered in this\r\n\r\nAssembly two weeks ago, I asked myself whether this\r\n\r\npolicy  statement  could have come  from  a  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Between  this policy  speech  and  the\r\n\r\npolicy  speeches delivered by Marshall's government\r\n\r\nand  the Lim Yew Hock government, I am sorry to say\r\n\r\nthat   I   can   hardly  notice   any   fundamental\r\n\r\ndifference. Mr Speaker, here [Indicating] are huge\r\n\r\nvolumes  of  the  Hansard.  Perusing  through   the\r\n\r\nspeeches made by the P.A.P. representatives in this\r\n\r\nvery  Assembly during the Labour Front  Government,\r\n\r\nyou  will  notice  the fundamental  differences  in\r\n\r\npolicy which distinguish the present policy of a so-called  P.A.P.  Government  from  the  real  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npronouncements in this very Assembly made from time\r\n\r\nto  time  before the general elections, and  before\r\n\r\nthe time the P.A.P. formed the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone are the days when the utterances of P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleaders captured the hearts and imagination of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Gone  are the days when the people  waited\r\n\r\neagerly for the morning papers to find out what had\r\n\r\nbeen  said  in this Assembly by P.A.P. leaders.  At\r\n\r\nthe  opening of the present session of the Assembly\r\n\r\na  fortnight ago, it was necessary for the  present\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership - there are only two of them,  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister and the Minister for Finance, as the\r\n\r\nothers do not make decisions and are still my  good\r\n\r\nold  friends - to  direct six  lorry  loads  of  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade  members  and scores of Party  workers  and\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre workers to stand at  the  Supreme\r\n\r\nCourt  building  to represent the so-called  masses\r\n\r\nand  to  give a cheer to the leaders as they  filed\r\n\r\npast the Supreme Court building from the City Hall.\r\n\r\nThe  organising  secretary  of  the  Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nBranch  led the shout of \"Merdeka\", but the workers\r\n\r\ndid  not  cheer  at all. Mr Speaker,  as  the  old\r\n\r\nproverb  says, you can lead a horse to  the  water,\r\n\r\nbut  you  cannot force it to drink. What a sad  and\r\n\r\nsorry spectacle!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the policy speech, nothing has been said about colonialism, about Malayanisation,\r\n\r\nabout  the  detainees, about the social revolution,\r\n\r\nand  many  other  important and pertinent  subjects\r\n\r\nwhich  can  be  found in the pages of  the  Hansard\r\n\r\nhere.  The  Government is not interested  in  these\r\n\r\nthings  any  more.  The  Secretary-General  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., who is now the Prime Minister, commented on\r\n\r\nthe  Labour  Front policy speech on 5th  September,\r\n\r\n1956, col. 56 of the Hansard, and this was what  he\r\n\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"As a statement of the policy of the Labour Front\r\n\r\nGovernment for the second session of this Assembly,\r\n\r\nthe  Governor's Address was poor and feeble.

I must\r\n\r\nalso  say,  Mr Speaker, that this is also  a  true\r\n\r\ndescription  of this policy statement. This  policy\r\n\r\nstatement  is not a policy statement  of  a  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment, definitely not a policy statement of  a\r\n\r\nreal P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

It   is  hypocrisy   to   say   that\r\n\r\ncolonialism  is  now  no more.  The  policy  speech\r\n\r\ndelivered two weeks ago said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The sense of oppression, humiliation and\r\n\r\nresentment which people experienced under  colonial\r\n\r\nrule  has  slowly given way to feelings of national\r\n\r\npride and self-confidence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What  does  this  sentence mean by implication?  It\r\n\r\nmeans  that  we have no more colonialism  here.  It\r\n\r\nmeans that now we have national pride, and national\r\n\r\npride can only be achieved in a country where there\r\n\r\nis  national  independence. No doubt, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nthe  1958  Constitution is an  improvement  on  the\r\n\r\nRendel  Constitution.  But  this  statement,  which\r\n\r\nimplies  that  we  are now no more  under  colonial\r\n\r\nrule,  is  far from being the truth. The  political\r\n\r\ncomplex of our society and our present Constitution\r\n\r\nis  still  predominantly colonial in character  and\r\n\r\ncontent.   Our   economy  is  still   predominantly\r\n\r\ncolonial. These are hard facts which we cannot  get\r\n\r\naway  from.  And listen to this. This is  what  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. manifesto said in 1954:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"All the constitutional concessions granted so\r\n\r\nfar  have been particularly careful to protect  and\r\n\r\nperpetuate   the  basic  economic   and   political\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the colonial power, The retention  of\r\n\r\nbasic   colonial   interests   runs   through   all\r\n\r\nconstitutional    re-arrangements     since     the\r\n\r\nreoccupation in 1945.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This is what the P.A.P. manifesto said. And what we\r\n\r\nhave   said.  It  is  equally  true  of  the   1958\r\n\r\nConstitution. At its best Singapore today remains a\r\n\r\nsemi-colony.   The   P.A.P. having   formed   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, it does not mean that the fight against\r\n\r\ncolonialism  is  over.  The Progressive  Party,  as\r\n\r\nrepresented here in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis Chamber by the Member for Farrer Park, at  one\r\n\r\ntime   had   intimated  to  us:   \"Do   not   fight\r\n\r\nColonialism.  The British will suspend  the  Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitution.\" Now we are being told the  same  old\r\n\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Petir dated 14th July, there is an article\r\n\r\npurported to be written by S.

He  always writes the articles  and  just\r\n\r\ngets  them out using other people's names.

But may I refresh you as to what the Prime Minister said when\r\n\r\nhe was Secretary-General of the P.A.P.?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim):</b> He is still now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> \"There are three things that\r\n\r\nthe  British Government can do: \", he said  in  the\r\n\r\nHansard,  Volume 1, No, 28, dated 4th April,  1956,\r\n\r\ncolumn  1796. That was four years ago, it  was  in\r\n\r\nconnection    with    the   discussion    on    the\r\n\r\nconstitutional question. At column 1794, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Freedom is the birthright of all peoples\r\n\r\neverywhere  in this world. Because my  fore-fathers\r\n\r\nmigrated  for  purely selfish economic  reasons  to\r\n\r\nwhat  they  call the South Seas, a whole generation\r\n\r\nof  some  two  million Chinese are  today  left  in\r\n\r\nMalaya   with  Malaya  as  their  only  home   and,\r\n\r\nnecessarily  thereby,  the  sole  object  of  their\r\n\r\nloyalty.  The generation that I belong to  grew  up\r\n\r\nunder  British colonial rule. It is always easy  to\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Let us forget the past. After all, that  was\r\n\r\ncolonialism.  It  was a mistake. Now,  let  us  get\r\n\r\ntogether   and  let  us  be  friends.\"  Commendable\r\n\r\nsentiment, Sir, and one to which I would  subscribe\r\n\r\nif  I found that there was sufficient sincerity  on\r\n\r\nthe  other side. If I believe that the British  are\r\n\r\nno  longer interested in either economic, political\r\n\r\nor  military advantages to themselves more than  to\r\n\r\nme,  then  there  would be a  basis  for  friendly,\r\n\r\ncomradely  cooperation. That is the  problem  which\r\n\r\nfaces  Britain  and  the people  of  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaya.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The Secretary-General continues:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It was only recently that the constitution of\r\n\r\nBritish  Guiana  was suspended. It  was  said  that\r\n\r\nthere, a great error had been made.

The long-term  consequences - I would not  say  the  immediate\r\n\r\nconsequences,  for  those  can  be  controlled  and\r\n\r\ncontained - of such a policy would be catastrophic to\r\n\r\nthe British.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Remember, Mr Speaker, what was said in April 1956:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...the British Government must be prepared to\r\n\r\nrevoke  the  constitution and  run  Singapore  once\r\n\r\nagain as a Crown colony in every sense of the word.\r\n\r\nThe  long-term consequences.of such a policy  would\r\n\r\nbe catastrophic to the British.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now  the  story  is different. Now if  there  is  a\r\n\r\nrevocation of the constitution, then the  long-term\r\n\r\nconsequences will be \"catastrophic\" to the  present\r\n\r\nleadership of the P.A.P. No more being Ministers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there are other theories being put up by the present leadership of the P.A.P. Just now\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister has said in his speech that  we\r\n\r\nin  Singapore are dependent on Johore for water. By\r\n\r\nimplication it means, \"Do not fight too hard. If we\r\n\r\ndo,  the British will ask the Federation Government\r\n\r\nto  cut off our water supply.\" And this is what the\r\n\r\nex-Assemblyman for Changi, Mr Lim Cher Kheng, said\r\n\r\non  22nd April, 1958, Volume 3, No. 2, col.  89  of\r\n\r\nthe Hansard:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"And I want to see how the adviser to the Naval\r\n\r\nBase  Workers'  Union and the Member for  Sembawang\r\n\r\n(Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim)-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExplanatory note - presently the Minister for Health -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"who is the Secretary of that union are going to\r\n\r\nprovide their workers with new jobs.

Who is going to\r\n\r\nengage  the  40,000 workers employed by  the  Armed\r\n\r\nServices?\" Now we are being told, \"Do not fight too\r\n\r\nhard.  Tomorrow, when you turn on  the  water  tap,\r\n\r\nthere will be no water forthcoming.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Volume 1, No. 2 of the Hansard dated 26th\r\n\r\nApril, 1955, the Secretary-General said at col. 67:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...we are not afraid to say that we are one\r\n\r\nhundred per cent against colonialism\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now he does not say those words any more. Now these\r\n\r\nsame  people,  after  forming the  Government,  are\r\n\r\nputting  up  the  same theories as the  Progressive\r\n\r\nParty and Labour Front had once done. They now say,\r\n\r\n\"To   fight  colonialism  means  to  fight  British\r\n\r\ntroops.\"  That  was  the speech of  the  Secretary-General  made  at  a  special Party  Conference  on\r\n\r\nSaturday,  18th June. If this theory is true,  then\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. has not been fighting colonialism during\r\n\r\nthe  past  five  years, because in  the  past  five\r\n\r\nyears,  before it came into power, the  P.A.P. had\r\n\r\nnot  fought British troops. If this theory is true,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, then the political fighting that took\r\n\r\nplace  during the past five years was  between  our\r\n\r\ngroup  and  the Lim Yew Hock group as to  who  were\r\n\r\ngoing to become tile Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of colonialism is manifested in two\r\n\r\nforms  in  this island. The open which is the  less\r\n\r\ndangerous  form,  and the covert and  subtle  form,\r\n\r\nwhich   is  the  more  dangerous.  I  shall   quote\r\n\r\ninstances  to distinguish between the two.  In  the\r\n\r\nopen  form.  British political power  lies  in  its\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  defence and external affairs,  in  the\r\n\r\npowers of the Internal Security Council, and in the\r\n\r\nmany provisions of the 1958 Singapore Constitution,\r\n\r\nwhich allow the British Government to intrude  into\r\n\r\nmany   spheres   of  Singapore's   internal   self-government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But British trade and influence do not rest\r\n\r\nthere.  They exercise their influences more tightly\r\n\r\nby  controlling key positions in our political  and\r\n\r\neconomic complex, and these influences are far more\r\n\r\nimportant and far-reaching in consequence than  the\r\n\r\nopen  control  which  they  exercise  through   the\r\n\r\nlegality of the 1958 Singapore Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have often said that the forces of colonialism\r\n\r\nare  now  stronger than ever. The fight has  merely\r\n\r\nentered  a  new  and more subtle  phase.  We  stand\r\n\r\ndeterminedly  for  the  completion  of  the   anti-colonial struggle which has now been betrayed. Just\r\n\r\nnow,  Mr  Speaker,  when the  Prime  Minister  was\r\n\r\ndelivering  his opening address on the debate,  his\r\n\r\nmethod  was  very  simple.  On  the  one  hand,  he\r\n\r\ncondemns, for the first time in the past 14 months,\r\n\r\nthe  British colonialists, the Straits  Times,  and\r\n\r\nK.M.T. sub-version. That is to convince the people\r\n\r\nif  they  can that they are on the left  of  these,\r\n\r\nThey  find  that our exposure that  they  have  not\r\n\r\ntalked  about colonialism during the past one  year\r\n\r\nis  being effective and accepted by the masses,  so\r\n\r\nfor   the  first  time  they  start  with  lukewarm\r\n\r\ncondemnation  if the British colonialists  and  the\r\n\r\nStraits Timer. Since the crisis in the P.A.P.,  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  have written no less  than  two  or\r\n\r\nthree editorials supporting the present leadership,\r\n\r\nthe   so-called  Russian  trade  visa,  the  K,M.T.\r\n\r\nsubversion (that is, the so-called detention of the\r\n\r\ntwo    journalists,   that   they   called   K.M.T.\r\n\r\nsubversion).  We  do  not  interpret  the   present\r\n\r\npolitical struggle in those terms. We interpret the\r\n\r\npresent  political struggle as it  was  interpreted\r\n\r\nbefore  the P.A.P. formed the Government: that  the\r\n\r\nfight  is a fight of the pro-colonialists,  led  by\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister and his erstwhile colleague, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance, and the  anti-colonialists.\r\n\r\nThis is what the Secretary-General said in Vol.  1,\r\n\r\ncol. 1798 of the Hansard, dated 4th April, 1956:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"As long as the British are here - the common\r\n\r\ntarget, the common foe are the British.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, could anybody deny that the British are still here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No word is mentioned in the policy speech about\r\n\r\nthe  presence  of  key  expatriate  officials,  the\r\n\r\ncolonial die-hards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  remnants  of colonial forces working  for  the\r\n\r\nprolongation  of  the  colonial  system  which   at\r\n\r\npresent  exists  in Singapore. Mr George  Thomson,\r\n\r\nwhom the P.A.P. had pledged to dismiss when it came\r\n\r\ninto  power,  is  still at large  and,  ironically,\r\n\r\nholding  a more important position than before.  In\r\n\r\naddition  to  his primary duties of  indoctrinating\r\n\r\nand  brain-washing civil servants, headmasters, and\r\n\r\npolice personnel at the Political Study Centre,  we\r\n\r\ncan also note his erstwhile and strange presence in\r\n\r\ndiscussions   on   tourist  promotion,   television\r\n\r\ndiscussions,  appearing  when  the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\naddresses    head-masters   of   middle    schools,\r\n\r\ndelivering  speeches,  appearing  at  forums,   and\r\n\r\nwriting articles; and only yesterday, appearing  in\r\n\r\nthe  Nanyang Siang Pao was a long article he  wrote\r\n\r\nfor  the  Police  Force, propounding  his  colonial\r\n\r\npolitical  philosophy. What an irony! That  article\r\n\r\nof  his contains at least 2,500 Chinese characters.\r\n\r\nMy  speech  was treated differently.  I  understand\r\n\r\nthat  the  vernacular Press in particular  and  the\r\n\r\nPress in general were asked, or instructed, to back-out  or censor my speeches on instructions from the\r\n\r\nGovernment. George Thomson was allowed 2,500 words.\r\n\r\nBut  the  speeches  of 10 to  15  speakers  at  the\r\n\r\nBadminton  Hall  rally? They rang  up  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nSiang  Pao  and  the  Sin  Chew  fit  Poh  to  say,\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, this is an order - 500 words.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, Mr Speaker, that another of\r\n\r\nThomson's main functions is to prepare material for\r\n\r\nMinisters and Assemblymen who might require it  for\r\n\r\ntheir speeches. I never used it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Thomson, we have Blades with other\r\n\r\nexpatriates  who are still controlling  the  police\r\n\r\nforce as it was in the good old days. After Blades,\r\n\r\nthere  is  P.H.  Meadows,  who  controls  all   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments under the Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nOffice,  namely, the Singapore Harbour  Board,  the\r\n\r\nCity Council, the Rural Board, the Land Office, the\r\n\r\nPlanning  Department,  the Survey  Department,  the\r\n\r\nRegistry of Deeds and the Registry of Titles, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Planning Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> In addition to the Big Three,\r\n\r\nthere  are  also  many other expatriates  in  other\r\n\r\nGovernment departments and Boards, where they  hold\r\n\r\nkey  positions  (Mr Speaker, these are  facts  and\r\n\r\ncannot  be  laughed  off) in the Singapore  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard,   the   Singapore   Telephone   Board,   the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications   Department,   and    so    on.\r\n\r\nExpatriates  who  have been malayanised  have  been\r\n\r\nasked  to  come  back. In the City  Council,  three\r\n\r\nexpatriates  who had taken their compensation  were\r\n\r\nasked to come back, and a local senior officer, Mr\r\n\r\nOwen,  whom  I have known from my own knowledge  of\r\n\r\naccountancy   to  be  a  brilliant   and   original\r\n\r\naccountant, has been forced to leave the country to\r\n\r\nfind   employment   overseas.   Fortunately,    his\r\n\r\naccounting   knowledge   is   recognised   by   the\r\n\r\nAustralians and he is now having a very  well  paid\r\n\r\njob  in  Australia. On the question of expatriates,\r\n\r\nit  is  necessary to remember two points.  Firstly,\r\n\r\noften  it  is  the work that these  expatriates  do\r\n\r\nwhich  is  not  known to the public  that  is  more\r\n\r\nimportant and of a more vital nature than the  work\r\n\r\nthat is generally known to the public. Secondly, it\r\n\r\nis  not  so  much the numbers but the key positions\r\n\r\nthat  the expatriates hold that really matters.  As\r\n\r\nfar  as the colonial power is concerned, it is  far\r\n\r\nbetter  to  have one expatriate officer controlling\r\n\r\nthe  departments under the Prime Minister's  office\r\n\r\nthan  to have, say, 30 expatriate officers  in  the\r\n\r\nPublic Works Department, as happened under the  Lim\r\n\r\nYew  Hock  Government. To show what this  means,  I\r\n\r\nseconded a local officer, Mr Estrop, to be  Deputy\r\n\r\nSuperintendent of the Pasir Panjang Power  Station,\r\n\r\nso  that  when the post of the expatriate head  was\r\n\r\nmalayanised,  there would be a local officer  ready\r\n\r\nto  take  his place. After the taking-over  of  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council  by  the Prime Minister,  Estrop  was\r\n\r\nimmediately  removed.  We know  that  many  of  the\r\n\r\nexpatriates deliberately do not want to train local\r\n\r\nofficers,   so   that  when  their  term   expires,\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  be forced to  re-engage  them  at\r\n\r\nfantastic salaries. Too many Government departments\r\n\r\nand  statutory  bodies are under direct  expatriate\r\n\r\ncontrol. The rest can be influenced by them in like\r\n\r\nmanner  through the colonial octopus.

Are  they  mistakes   on\r\n\r\nfundamental principles or mistakes on trivialities?\r\n\r\nWhat  I  can  gather from this policy  speech,  the\r\n\r\nrecent  Petir  editorial, and the Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\naddress this morning, which sounded like the  voice\r\n\r\nof Lim Yew Hock delivering it, is that the Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Labour  and  Law,  who  is  another  possible\r\n\r\nscapegoat,  went ahead with too many  laws  in  the\r\n\r\npast  year. The mistakes are not so much  with  the\r\n\r\nlaws  themselves as with the speed with which  they\r\n\r\nwere  passed.  We  are not so worried  about  these\r\n\r\nlittle mistakes, trivialities and forms, because no\r\n\r\nperson  running a Ministry can avoid them.

Repeal   the\r\n\r\ngambling  Bills  and reverse your present  taxation\r\n\r\npolicy  which is to tax the poor and subsidise  the\r\n\r\nrich.  It  should be to tax the rich and  subsidise\r\n\r\nthe  poor.  Rectify  all those  mistakes  that  are\r\n\r\nenumerated in the Hong Lim resolutions. You  cannot\r\n\r\nfight   this   political  issue  by   intimidation,\r\n\r\nsuppression   and  temptation.  You   cannot,   for\r\n\r\ninstance, just ring up the vernacular Press,  after\r\n\r\nthe Badminton Hall rally, and order them to \"black-out\"  the speeches, and after protestations,  order\r\n\r\nthem  to  limit all the speeches to 500 words.  You\r\n\r\ncannot  win  the political struggle by detaining  a\r\n\r\njournalist 15 minutes after he attended\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmy  Press  conference while he was on  his  way  to\r\n\r\ncable  my Press releases to Kuala Lumpur,  so  that\r\n\r\nyou  can  use  him to intimidate other journalists.\r\n\r\nYou  cannot win by sending C.I.D. and other  people\r\n\r\nto  the houses of Party members to intimidate them.\r\n\r\nYou  cannot win by intimidating the printing  press\r\n\r\nwhich  printed my speeches, which were  blacked-out\r\n\r\nby  the local Press according to your instructions.\r\n\r\nYou  cannot  win  by offering back  jobs  to  those\r\n\r\nP.A.P. members whom you have sacked from the S.I.T.\r\n\r\nYou can only win by going back to pre-May 1959,  if\r\n\r\nthat is ever possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as I have said just now, we are sitting here on this side because we have been\r\n\r\nforced to sit here, and because the Prime Minister -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.
