He has set out\r\n\r\nsuccinctly  the course of economic development  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  during the last decade. What  impresses\r\n\r\nme  most,  and perhaps every Singaporean,  in  his\r\n\r\npresentation  of the 50-page Budget  statement  is\r\n\r\nnot just that it is a well-prepared statement with\r\n\r\na  great deal of scholarly thought behind it,  but\r\n\r\nthat it exudes a quiet note of confidence for  the\r\n\r\nfuture   against  the  background  story  of   the\r\n\r\neconomic   development  and   success   story   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  the  face of  great  adversity  and\r\n\r\nagainst overwhelming odds. A great tribute must be\r\n\r\npaid   to  the  Finance  Minister  who  has   been\r\n\r\npersonally  responsible for  Singapore's  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and planning during the greater  part\r\n\r\nof the past decade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson that we are to draw from Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomic  progress  in the last  decade  is  that,\r\n\r\ndespite our lack of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnatural  resources  and the  presence  of  adverse\r\n\r\nfactors,  we  can not only survive but  also  make\r\n\r\nsignificant  improvements in our economic,  social\r\n\r\nand   political  fields  if  we  Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  sweat and toil for it.  This  lesson\r\n\r\nshould  undoubtedly give us added  confidence  and\r\n\r\ndetermination to work harder if we are to win  for\r\n\r\nourselves greater prosperity and greater  progress\r\n\r\nin the coming decade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing that we must bear in mind is\r\n\r\nthe  timely  warning  given by  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance that we must not be complacent if  we  are\r\n\r\nnot  to fritter away all that we have achieved  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  decade, and if we are  successfully  to\r\n\r\nmeet the challenge that we have to face at the end\r\n\r\nof 1971 when the British completely withdraw their\r\n\r\nforces  from  Singapore, thereby aggravating  both\r\n\r\nour security and economic problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the acceleration and expansion of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  programmes   as   planned   and\r\n\r\ncarried  out by the Economic Development Board  up\r\n\r\nto  date  have  helped to increase the  number  of\r\n\r\npersons  employed in the manufacturing  industries\r\n\r\nto  87,128,  and while we are confident  that  the\r\n\r\nfull economic impact of the complete British pull-out  at  the end of 1971 can be cushioned  through\r\n\r\nfurther   expansion   of   the   industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  it is envisaged that this  will  give\r\n\r\nrise to attendant problems, the chief of which  is\r\n\r\nlikely  to  be a shortage of engineers, management and\r\n\r\ntechnical  personnel.  This  problem  is   further\r\n\r\naggravated by such personnel being required to  do\r\n\r\nnational service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has proposed, as a way of\r\n\r\nminimising  the  problem  of  shortage   of   such\r\n\r\npersonnel,  to  relax  our  immigration  and  work\r\n\r\npermit   restrictions  on  the  in-flow  of   such\r\n\r\npersonnel. The Government, after weighing the pros\r\n\r\nand  cons, considers it advantageous to liberalise\r\n\r\nthe conditions under which such people can qualify\r\n\r\nfor   permanent   residence   in   Singapore   and\r\n\r\neventually citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While such a proposal appears to be logically\r\n\r\nnecessary as a solution to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblem  of  our  envisaged  shortage  of  trained\r\n\r\npersonnel  with  technical and management  skills,\r\n\r\nand  while in principle it has my support, I must,\r\n\r\nhowever,  ask  the  Government to  exercise  great\r\n\r\ncaution in its implementation as it may result  in\r\n\r\nthe  creation  of other and greater  problems.  My\r\n\r\nfear  is that the persons who may avail themselves\r\n\r\nof the relaxed conditions for entry into Singapore\r\n\r\nand   swarm  into  our  factories  and  industrial\r\n\r\nenterprises  may not necessarily be  of  the  best\r\n\r\ncalibre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shortage of men with skills in management and\r\n\r\ntechnical fields is a problem all over the  world,\r\n\r\nparticularly  with the developing countries.  With\r\n\r\nsuch  demand for the services of trained technical\r\n\r\npersonnel,   Singapore's   offer   of    permanent\r\n\r\nresidence  and citizenship in addition to  a  wide\r\n\r\nrange of incentives in terms of money or otherwise\r\n\r\nmay  not  necessarily attract  the  best  type  of\r\n\r\nworkers  who  may  prefer  to  emigrate  to  other\r\n\r\ncountries,  more  developed  and  prosperous  than\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  point I wish  to  make  is  that,\r\n\r\nsupposing  we have managed to attract only  third-rate   personnel  with  management  and  technical\r\n\r\nskills, we may be creating a situation which  will\r\n\r\nhave  an  adverse effect on, and ramifications  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to,  the  long-term  objectives  of  our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programmes. The  end  result  is\r\n\r\nthat  our production cost and quality control  may\r\n\r\nbe  seriously  affected. It is a  matter  of  time\r\n\r\nbefore   the  need  of  technical  and  management\r\n\r\npersonnel  can  be  met locally.  When  that  time\r\n\r\ncomes,  the  import  of management  and  technical\r\n\r\npersonnel  from  abroad may cause  a  demoralizing\r\n\r\neffect on local management and technical personnel\r\n\r\nwho  will thereby be deprived of promotion avenues\r\n\r\nto that extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the incentives given to expatriate\r\n\r\npersonnel besides permanent residence and eventual\r\n\r\ncitizenship will serve to increase their take-home\r\n\r\npay.  Situations  may  arise  where  citizen   and\r\n\r\nexpatriate personnel working side by side  on  the\r\n\r\nsame  job  and  possessing the same qualifications\r\n\r\nenjoy two entirely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifferent terms and conditions of service. It will\r\n\r\nnot  be  surprising  if a feeling  of  unhappiness\r\n\r\nresults  from such disparities in pay and  working\r\n\r\nconditions.  It  is, therefore not  likely  to  be\r\n\r\nconducive  to a congenial atmosphere in the  place\r\n\r\nof  work, and to assist our efforts to educate and\r\n\r\ntrain   our  own  local  personnel  to   man   our\r\n\r\nindustries and industrial enterprises. It may well\r\n\r\nbe,  to  quote the extreme case, that our citizens\r\n\r\nwith  managerial and technical skills may find  it\r\n\r\nmore  attractive and lucrative to migrate to other\r\n\r\nlands  where  they are likely to find greater  job\r\n\r\nsatisfaction for the skills that they possess.  If\r\n\r\nthis happens, it would indeed be a paradox to  our\r\n\r\ndetriment. This feeling of unhappiness is all  the\r\n\r\nmore acute in cases where expatriate personnel are\r\n\r\nplaced  in  positions above our citizen  personnel\r\n\r\nwho  subsequently obtain equivalent, if not higher\r\n\r\nqualifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is the situation today in\r\n\r\nMalaysia-Singapore   Airlines.   The    expatriate\r\n\r\nmanagement of M.S.A. gives the impression that  it\r\n\r\nhas   adopted   a   policy  of  recruiting   white\r\n\r\nexpatriates  irrespective of the  availability  of\r\n\r\nlocal    personnel   with   similar   or    better\r\n\r\nqualifications.   The  Singapore   Air   Transport\r\n\r\nWorkers'   Union  has  over  the   years   battled\r\n\r\nstrenuously    for    a    concrete    plan    for\r\n\r\nnationalisation  and  a  training  programme   for\r\n\r\nsuitably qualified national staff to be groomed to\r\n\r\nreplace  expatriates. But with the recent  changes\r\n\r\nin   the   structure   of  the  management,   more\r\n\r\nexpatriates  are being brought in. And  now  under\r\n\r\nthe so-called scientific expatriate management  of\r\n\r\nM.S.A.,   all   kinds   of   dubiously   qualified\r\n\r\nexpatriates   have   been   recruited;    existing\r\n\r\nexpatriates who have been scheduled to  leave  are\r\n\r\npromoted  over the more qualified national  staff.\r\n\r\nExperienced national staff are switched around  to\r\n\r\ntheir    disadvantage   under   the    guise    of\r\n\r\nreorganisation  in  order  to  pave  the  way  for\r\n\r\nestablishing  expatriate  footholds.   All   these\r\n\r\nnefarious  activities have lowered the  morale  of\r\n\r\nthe  M.S.A. staff  and have  created  deep-seated\r\n\r\nfrustration and disillusionment among the national\r\n\r\nstaff  who feel that qualifications and efficiency\r\n\r\nare not the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprerequisites  for promotion. This attitude  could\r\n\r\nhave far-reaching effects on the national staff if\r\n\r\nsteps are to remedy this situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister, in his speech, paid tribute\r\n\r\nto  the  National Trades Union Congress by stating\r\n\r\nthat    its    success    in   promoting    labour\r\n\r\nresponsibility  was one of the  important  factors\r\n\r\ncreating  a favourable general investment climate.\r\n\r\nIt  is  gratifying for the N.T.U.C. leadership  to\r\n\r\nnote  that its realistic and responsible stand  in\r\n\r\npromoting   labour   responsibility    has    been\r\n\r\nappreciated  by the Government. The leadership  of\r\n\r\nthe N.T.U.C. has always maintained that the labour\r\n\r\nmovement can play a responsible role as a  coequal\r\n\r\nsector  in  the tripartite partnership of  Labour,\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  Management  in  the  social   and\r\n\r\neconomic development of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of the Employment Act on\r\n\r\n15th  August, 1968, the N.T.U.C. has no reason  to\r\n\r\ndoubt  the  bona fide intentions of Government  in\r\n\r\ngiving  vent to the underlying objectives  of  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act. While the N.T.U.C. may  say  the\r\n\r\nsame of the many enlightened employers who have co-operated wholeheartedly and sincerely not only  in\r\n\r\nrefusing  to  take  advantage  of  some   of   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Act, but also in observing  the\r\n\r\nspirit  of  the  Act, the N.T.U.C., unfortunately,\r\n\r\ncannot  say the same of a few employers  who  have\r\n\r\ntaken advantage of the anomalous provisions of the\r\n\r\nAct to the serious detriment of their workers. The\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. will  soon be making representations  to\r\n\r\nthe Government to rectify the anomalous provisions\r\n\r\nof  the  Employment Act so that the Act  will  not\r\n\r\nlend   itself  to  abusive  practices  by  a   few\r\n\r\nunreasonable employers who may be tempted to treat\r\n\r\nthe Employment Act as a licence to exploit labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon. Members will recall that, together with  the\r\n\r\npassing   of  the  Employment  Act,  the   Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund  Ordinance  was  also  amended  to\r\n\r\nincrease  C.P.F. contributions from five per  cent\r\n\r\nto  ten per cent in gradual stages. This was to be\r\n\r\npart and parcel of a package\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeal,  so  to speak, with Labour - that  is,  higher\r\n\r\nC.P.F. contributions for better  work  discipline\r\n\r\nand  efficiency. Workers are to be  given  greater\r\n\r\nC.P.F. savings which, in a very significant  way,\r\n\r\nwill go a long way towards giving them a sense  of\r\n\r\nsecurity  after their retirement from  employment.\r\n\r\nWhile  the  vast majority of workers benefit  from\r\n\r\nthe  increase in C.P.F. contributions,  there  are\r\n\r\nalso, sad to say, some workers who happen to  work\r\n\r\nunder  less  reasonable employers and who  do  not\r\n\r\nbenefit from the increase of C.P.F. contributions.\r\n\r\nThese  are  the unionised workers in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector who are enjoying not less than 10 per  cent\r\n\r\nretirement    benefits   under   the    collective\r\n\r\nagreements. One obtained the impression  that  the\r\n\r\nprimary  objective of the amendment to the  C.P.F.\r\n\r\nOrdinance  was to increase the C.P.F. savings  of\r\n\r\nindividual workers so that when they retire,  they\r\n\r\nwill  be able to find a bigger amount of money  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for their old age after retirement.  But,\r\n\r\nsad  to  say,  this may not be the  case  in  many\r\n\r\nsituations.  Many employees, with the  concurrence\r\n\r\nof  the  Arbitration  Court,  have  the  increased\r\n\r\nC.P.F. contributions offset against their  normal\r\n\r\ngratuity  payments. In effect,  on  retirement,  a\r\n\r\nworker  gets,  on  the one hand, increased  C.P.F.\r\n\r\nsavings,  but  on  the other hand,  he  loses  the\r\n\r\ngreater  portion if not the whole of his  gratuity\r\n\r\npayments,  equivalent  to  his  increased   C.P.F.\r\n\r\ncontributions. The net result is that he does  not\r\n\r\nbenefit from the increase in C.P.F. contributions,\r\n\r\nat least not to the extent that one thinks that he\r\n\r\nshould  get as the result of the amendment to  the\r\n\r\nC.P.F.    Ordinance   to   increase   the   C.P.F.\r\n\r\ncontributions from five per cent to ten per  cent,\r\n\r\nin   conjunction  with  the  amendments   to   the\r\n\r\nEmployment Act. Members will surely understand  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  some feeling of frustration  over  this\r\n\r\nmatter  among  some  workers.  I  hope  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   and   the  N.T.U.C. together   with\r\n\r\nManagement, will be able to iron out the anomalies\r\n\r\narising  out  of  the operation of the  Employment\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of Labour to accept the underlying\r\n\r\nprinciples and objectives of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   recent  Employment  Act  has  begun  to  pay\r\n\r\ndividends.  What  we all must not  forget  is  the\r\n\r\nsound advice of the Finance Minister in his Budget\r\n\r\nstatement that the more difficult period will come\r\n\r\nat  the  end of 1971, with the completion  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish  military withdrawal. We must,  therefore,\r\n\r\nnot  be  complacent  and over-confident.  We  have\r\n\r\novercome   the  difficult  1960s,  and  we   shall\r\n\r\novercome the challenge of the I 970s provided that\r\n\r\nLabour, Government and Management can continue  to\r\n\r\nwork  as  co-equals  in  a tripartite  partnership\r\n\r\nstriving   for   national,  social  and   economic\r\n\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for the reason that Labour must play a\r\n\r\nresponsible  role  as  a  co-equal  partner   with\r\n\r\nGovernment and Management that the Singapore trade\r\n\r\nunion movement has made its momentous decision  to\r\n\r\nmodernize  itself  so as to be a co-equal  partner\r\n\r\nwith  the  Government and Management in  the  very\r\n\r\nsense of the word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.48 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, very few people in Singapore can\r\n\r\nremain   unimpressed  by  the  narration  of   our\r\n\r\neconomic  success  in the last ten  years  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance in his Budget statement. I am\r\n\r\nno exception, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most important factors contributing\r\n\r\ntowards our great leap forward can be found in the\r\n\r\nquality  of our political leadership.  As  such  I\r\n\r\nintend to dwell on this subject a little.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959 when the P.A.P. first took office, our\r\n\r\nPrime Minister did have \"grave reservations\".  His\r\n\r\nreservations  were not unfounded. The  politicians\r\n\r\nthat  held power prior to 1959 were inept, corrupt\r\n\r\nand  made a sham of parliamentary democracy.  They\r\n\r\ndid  not  have the foresight to lead Singapore  to\r\n\r\nindependence.  The  P.A.P. itself   was   finding\r\n\r\ndifficulties with the adventurous opportunists and\r\n\r\ntreacherous   Communists   within    the    party.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Government was confronted with a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfierce  display of anger and disappointment  by  a\r\n\r\nlarge  section of the people in the earlier regime\r\n\r\non   the   one   hand,  and  the   apathetic   and\r\n\r\ndisenchanted    orientation   of   many    average\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  on  the  other.  Thus   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\ngovernment  was  faced with the gigantic  task  of\r\n\r\nreshaping a colonial society for independence, and\r\n\r\nto  set  Singapore on the road to development  and\r\n\r\nmodernization by restoring the faith of the people\r\n\r\nin the principles of parliamentary democracy. This\r\n\r\nwas  by no means an easy task. It calls for strong\r\n\r\ncharacter,  determination and unselfish dedication\r\n\r\non  the part of the political leadership, plus  an\r\n\r\nunyielding  faith in the validity and  workability\r\n\r\nof parliamentary democracy itself. It was the good\r\n\r\nfortune  of the people of Singapore that  they  do\r\n\r\nhave  such a leadership. Patiently, the foundation\r\n\r\nwas laid, as reported by the Finance Minister,  in\r\n\r\nspite of political pre-occupation, to prepare  the\r\n\r\nway  for  economic  progress and  to  provide  the\r\n\r\naverage citizen with a happier life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite situations of tension and crises, the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  socialists, through the  P.A.P.,  have\r\n\r\nproved  that  through persuasion,  convincing  and\r\n\r\nworking  within  the  framework  of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy and not through terror and ruthlessness,\r\n\r\nas  the  Communists would want it,  they  too  can\r\n\r\nachieve progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there was one other factor that\r\n\r\ncontributed towards consolidation of the  people's\r\n\r\nfaith  in  the democratic socialists, and  thereby\r\n\r\nhelped  them to make progress in the country.  The\r\n\r\nCommunists front-men, through their own folly, had\r\n\r\nconvinced   the   people  that  they   were   more\r\n\r\ninterested  in  political gains for the  Communist\r\n\r\ncause  than  in the general welfare of the  people\r\n\r\nand the country as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have gone to great lengths on this subject\r\n\r\nbecause  it  brings  home a crucial  point.  I  am\r\n\r\nconvinced that ultimately our economic well-being,\r\n\r\npolitical  stability  and national  security  will\r\n\r\ndepend to a very large extent on whether or not we\r\n\r\nhave  developed  in  our  younger  generation   an\r\n\r\nunyielding    faith   in   the    principles    of\r\n\r\nparliamentary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  And  this  is determined  to  a  large\r\n\r\nextent  by the quality of the political leadership\r\n\r\nwe  provide and can continue to provide.  In  this\r\n\r\nconnection,  Sir,  I think we cannot,  and  should\r\n\r\nnot,  hope to ignore the possible doubts that  our\r\n\r\npeople might have in the question of succession to\r\n\r\nthe  highly  successful political leadership  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  been accustomed to for  the  last  ten\r\n\r\nyears. Those entering and those who wish to remain\r\n\r\nin  the political arena must pledge to uphold this\r\n\r\ntradition      of      dedication,      sincerity,\r\n\r\ndetermination,   honesty   and   basically    the\r\n\r\nprinciple of parliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fear that our achievements can be\r\n\r\ndestroyed  by a political leadership  of  inferior\r\n\r\nquality  is not unfounded and we must be  vigilant\r\n\r\nat all times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another great transformation the Government has\r\n\r\nbrought about in the last decade has been  in  the\r\n\r\nbureaucracy.  Members  will  recall   the   uneasy\r\n\r\nrelationship  the Government had  with  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants when it first assumed office in 1959.  It\r\n\r\nwas evident in those days that the bureaucracy was\r\n\r\nnot  geared to the changes that were taking place.\r\n\r\nThe bureaucratic system had to be streamlined, and\r\n\r\nnew   talents  brought  into  prominence.  Patient\r\n\r\nsearch  had  to be made to bring in  the  brighter\r\n\r\nsector   of  the  population  to  assist  in   the\r\n\r\nadministration. The Government realised that  with\r\n\r\nmore  and  more institutions set up  for  economic\r\n\r\nexpansion and social services, greater exercise of\r\n\r\ninitiative had to be given to the civil servant. I\r\n\r\nhave   observed  also  that  the  Government   has\r\n\r\ndeliberately  exposed  its  bureaucrats   to   the\r\n\r\nintricacies of the commercial world.  In  many  of\r\n\r\nour  statutory boards and public owned  commercial\r\n\r\nagencies, civil servants are made to work hand  in\r\n\r\nhand with businessmen. The obvious advantage to be\r\n\r\ngained  in  such a set-up is that the  bureaucracy\r\n\r\nwill  have  a better understanding of  our  highly\r\n\r\ncommercialised  society and they  will  invariably\r\n\r\nlearn  a  trick  or two from their  more  seasoned\r\n\r\ncommercial counterparts. But I must raise here the\r\n\r\nfear  of possible erosion of the integrity  of  an\r\n\r\nincorruptible bureaucracy which is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nessential  to  the  successful  operation   of   a\r\n\r\ndemocratic system. It will be time for regrets  if\r\n\r\nwe  should find our public servants succumbing  to\r\n\r\nthe temptation of material gains when they are  so\r\n\r\nexposed. It might be worth while to take note that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will find it really hard  to  forgive\r\n\r\nsuch mistakes if they do occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recruitment of new talents into its\r\n\r\nfold,  the bureaucracy has invariably strengthened\r\n\r\nitself. I do not wish to be a prophet of doom, but\r\n\r\nI  do see signs of gradual erosion of the power of\r\n\r\nthe  politician by the bureaucrat. Having been  in\r\n\r\npower  for  more  than a decade  and  seen  things\r\n\r\ngetting    more    and   more   institutionalised,\r\n\r\nGovernment  leaders may tend to take such  erosion\r\n\r\nwith  extreme  kindness. But, Sir,  being  a  firm\r\n\r\nbeliever  in democracy, it is hard of me to  allow\r\n\r\nthe  creation of a formidable or even near supreme\r\n\r\nbureaucracy.  A closer check must be  made  before\r\n\r\nany great damage is done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, please do not allow what I have just said to\r\n\r\ncarry  to  the House the impression  that  I  have\r\n\r\nruled  out the contribution of the public  service\r\n\r\nto our progress in the last decade. Indeed, Sir, I\r\n\r\nhave made it the second point in my speech to  pay\r\n\r\ntribute  to  these people and to express  my  deep\r\n\r\nappreciation  of  the  grand  work  of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants  as  a  whole. It is to  the  credit  and\r\n\r\nsatisfaction of many that we should  have  such  a\r\n\r\ngenerally honest, hard-working and efficient civil\r\n\r\nservice.  My  point is that the Government  should\r\n\r\nnot  in its preoccupation with problems create out\r\n\r\nof  this  civil  service  a  Frankenstein  to  the\r\n\r\ndisappointment of many, like myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I will turn to our relations with our\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries. Sir, my mind is  disturbed\r\n\r\nand  I  feel  sad that while we in  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nhappy  and proud of our achievements in  the  last\r\n\r\ndecade and grateful to the Government leaders  for\r\n\r\nwhat they have done, there are many of our friends\r\n\r\noutside  of  Singapore who would  have  wished  to\r\n\r\nshare our joy and pride as brothers and equals and\r\n\r\nunable  to do so for reasons beyond their control.\r\n\r\nI refer, Sir, to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany,  known  and  unknown to us,  who  have  been\r\n\r\nsecretly wishing us well since the day we acquired\r\n\r\nindependence as a sovereign republic.  These  kind\r\n\r\npeople,  sharing  our  hopes and  aspirations  and\r\n\r\nknowing our difficulties as an independent  state,\r\n\r\nmust  be searching deep within themselves for  the\r\n\r\nevil curse that disallows them to rejoice with  us\r\n\r\nover our achievements at this very moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our stay in Malaysia was short, but then we\r\n\r\ndid  make  many  friends. We  went  into  Malaysia\r\n\r\nbecause - and I quote the Prime Minister from  his\r\n\r\nbook  The Battle for Merger, a book from  which  I\r\n\r\nhave  derived much political inspiration - he said\r\n\r\n\"if  merger does not come with the consent of  the\r\n\r\npeople of the two territories, then inevitably  it\r\n\r\nwill  come  by  the use of force by one  territory\r\n\r\nover  the other, because each is so vital  to  the\r\n\r\nsurvival of the other.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ironical and inconceivable, in so far as I\r\n\r\nam concerned, as fate would have it, that we after\r\n\r\n4  1/2  years of independence should flourish  and\r\n\r\nprosper, while our friends and relatives should  3\r\n\r\n3/4  years  after  that fateful August  1965  have\r\n\r\nsuffered loss of lives and homes and may soon have\r\n\r\nto  face  the dilemma of a deadly choice.  In  any\r\n\r\ncase, I do not consider it wise to dwell too  long\r\n\r\non  this  subject  except to  make  the  following\r\n\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, during and after Malaysia, one lesson we\r\n\r\ndid learn is that one sure and quick way to impede\r\n\r\nprogress is to have too many people living on  the\r\n\r\ngood-will   and  provisions  of  the   Government.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  contrary to the expectations  of  many,\r\n\r\nour  separation from Malaysia did  not  spell  our\r\n\r\ndeath  warrant. We did manage to continue to  grow\r\n\r\nand  prosper through sheer willpower  of  a  hard-working  people. Thirdly, we have to  explore  new\r\n\r\nfields    of   co-operation   between   the    two\r\n\r\nterritories. New personalities will have  to  meet\r\n\r\nmore  frequently  to  work out  fields  of  common\r\n\r\ninterest.  It is vital to our survival  that  both\r\n\r\nterritories must map\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout possible courses of action so as to face up to\r\n\r\nthe  realities of life after the shock of May last\r\n\r\nyear. On various occasions, our Government leaders\r\n\r\nhave  repeatedly pledged to support any move  that\r\n\r\nwould contribute to uplifting the economic life of\r\n\r\nthe  people in the region. It is on this framework\r\n\r\nthat we can co-operate with our neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, having made very rapid progress in\r\n\r\nindustrialisation, may in future find itself to be\r\n\r\nrelatively  more advanced technologically,  in  so\r\n\r\nfar  as  the region is concerned. There  would  be\r\n\r\nothers  who  would have still to make  headway  in\r\n\r\nindustrialisation. Would it not  be  a  good  idea\r\n\r\nthen  to look into the possibility of arriving  at\r\n\r\nsome kind of a \"common market arrangement\" for the\r\n\r\ndistribution of technological know-how?  The  time\r\n\r\nwill  come when countries that are relatively less\r\n\r\naffluent   in   technological   know-how    should\r\n\r\nconcentrate   on  less  sophisticated  industries,\r\n\r\nwhile  others relatively more advanced can involve\r\n\r\nthemselves  in  industries  that  require  greater\r\n\r\nskill.  In  this way the relatively more  advanced\r\n\r\ncountries  in this region can help the  others  on\r\n\r\nthe road to industrialisation and progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Sir, I wish to join the Government\r\n\r\nin  appealing  for  a better appreciation  of  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of attracting foreign investments.  Quite\r\n\r\napart  from  the  fact  that such  investments  as\r\n\r\nreported  by  the Minister bring in ready  markets\r\n\r\nand technological know-how, they too can bring  us\r\n\r\nstronger backing for our security. If we keep  our\r\n\r\nopen  door  policy, we will be able  to  get  more\r\n\r\npeople  interested in our security to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  go about making money safely  and  that\r\n\r\ntheir  investments  are not harassed!  I  have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that Singaporeans are pragmatic  enough  to\r\n\r\nunderstand that, for all the advantages that  come\r\n\r\nwith  such  investments, a price will have  to  be\r\n\r\npaid!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about paying a price for progress. I take\r\n\r\nthis opportunity to praise the worthy contribution\r\n\r\nof  our  workers. They have worked very  hard  and\r\n\r\nhave  accepted the Employment Act. 1968,  in  good\r\n\r\nspirit. This is a high price they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave to pay for the progress of all Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nincluding the prosperous businessmen,\r\n\r\nindustrialists and other commercial tycoons. The\r\n\r\nlabour movement has had its share of glory in our\r\n\r\nstruggle against the Communists. The workers have\r\n\r\nalways taken the brunt of any change for better or\r\n\r\nfor worse. They deserve our praise and admiration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strike a more materialistic tone, Sir, I have\r\n\r\nto remind the Minister for Labour of his assurance\r\n\r\ngiven on various occasions that if everything goes\r\n\r\nwell, our workers should have their take-home pay\r\n\r\nrevised upwards in two to three years' time. They\r\n\r\ndeserve it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has progressed not because of any\r\n\r\nnatural    resources   or   heaven-sent    riches.\r\n\r\nSingapore's success is due to the iron will of the\r\n\r\npeople led by able political leadership. In  order\r\n\r\nthat our achievements in the last decade will  not\r\n\r\nbe  wasted, we must develop and accept new values,\r\n\r\nnew  ideas, be more achievement-oriented, tolerate\r\n\r\ndifferences, have pride in group performance,  and\r\n\r\nbe  willing  to  expose ourselves to technological\r\n\r\ninnovations.  In short, we must develop  a  modern\r\n\r\noutlook  in life. We must fit ourselves  into  the\r\n\r\nnew   and  challenging  world.  The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nScience  and Technology, after being elected  pro-tem  chairman  of  the P.A.P. on  21st  November,\r\n\r\n1954, said, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A country big or small can only be great if the\r\n\r\nspirit of the people is great.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the spirit of our people as manifested in the\r\n\r\nlast  ten  years  has  been  great,  and  we  must\r\n\r\nnecessarily succeed as a great country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.06 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in admiration of\r\n\r\nthe   way   in  which  the  Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nmasterfully  and coherently presented  the  Budget\r\n\r\nstatement. Clearly, Sir, there are many advantages\r\n\r\nin  having  a distinguished economist as  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance. But to many of us Backbenchers, this\r\n\r\nposes a distinct disadvantage in having to try  to\r\n\r\ncom-prehend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  economic jargon, let  alone  try  to\r\n\r\ntackle the Minister on his home ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a particularly difficult task today, Sir,\r\n\r\nas   my  economist  friends  who  have  read   the\r\n\r\nstatement tell me that the Budget statement  is  a\r\n\r\nmasterly analysis of the exciting economic  events\r\n\r\nof the last decade. Of course, one cannot deny the\r\n\r\nfact  that  the Finance Minister has had  all  the\r\n\r\nadvantages   of   being  at  the  economic   helm.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Sir, I shall have to be satisfied  with\r\n\r\njust  a  few questions, which I hope the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill clarify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it concerns our open door policy. There\r\n\r\nare  two  aspects of this policy on which I  would\r\n\r\nlike to focus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Foreign investment. In his speech the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  pointed out that we do not  really  need\r\n\r\nthe money that comes with foreign investments, but\r\n\r\nrather we want and require foreign investments for\r\n\r\nthe   technology,  the  marketing  and  managerial\r\n\r\nexpertise that come with them. Therefore, first of\r\n\r\nall,  if  we  have  capital of our  own  presently\r\n\r\ninvested  abroad,  should we  not  look  into  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of hiring the managerial  skills  and\r\n\r\nknow-how  but  providing  the  capital  ourselves?\r\n\r\nAlternatively,  should we not  actively  encourage\r\n\r\nmore  joint  ventures in a much  more  significant\r\n\r\nmanner,   whether  wholly-owned  or  partly-owned?\r\n\r\nSecondly,  what  steps are being taken  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  marketing  and managerial  know-how  is\r\n\r\nbeing  transmitted  to  local  personnel  so  that\r\n\r\neventually we will acquire such indigenous skills?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Immigration. The Finance Minister has called\r\n\r\nfor a review of the immigration policy relating to\r\n\r\nthe   inflow  of  skilled  labour  and  managerial\r\n\r\npersonnel. This is the second aspect of  our  open\r\n\r\ndoor  policy on which I would like to focus. As  I\r\n\r\nsee it, the immediate objective of this policy  is\r\n\r\npresumably  to  prevent run-away wage  and  salary\r\n\r\nincreases   so   that   the   momentum   of    our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  plans  is  not   impeded.   The\r\n\r\npolicy, I must say, is well considered, given this\r\n\r\nobjective. However, two other questions need to be\r\n\r\nput forward. First.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsider   the   situation   where   the   foreign\r\n\r\nenterprise is set up with pioneer benefits of  tax\r\n\r\nexemption,    accelerated   depreciation,    lower\r\n\r\nproperty  tax rates, subsidised factory sites  and\r\n\r\nutilities,   and,   lastly,   utilising   imported\r\n\r\npersonnel.  One  may wonder what net  benefit  the\r\n\r\nconcern is to our Republic. Therefore, Sir, if  we\r\n\r\nlook  at the Gross Domestic Product, the sum total\r\n\r\nof  employee  remuneration  and  profits  will  be\r\n\r\nregistered,  but  in terms of the  Gross  National\r\n\r\nProduct -a truer measure of national welfare  -the\r\n\r\naddition   is   negligible,   if   not   negative.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly  one  can  argue for  some  multiplier\r\n\r\neffects   arising  from  the  enterprise's   local\r\n\r\npurchases  as  well  as for eventual  tax  revenue\r\n\r\ngains.  Nevertheless, the point is surely  crucial\r\n\r\nin  that  we need to be aware of net benefits  and\r\n\r\ncosts.  In  this regard, perhaps steps  should  be\r\n\r\ntaken  to  reduce the large item  of  \"Errors  and\r\n\r\nOmissions\" in the balance of payments to enable us\r\n\r\nto get a better picture of the G.N.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, another issue connected with the\r\n\r\nimmigration  policy  is that  we  should  exercise\r\n\r\nextra caution and selectivity. It would not do for\r\n\r\nus   to   erode   legitimate   gains   in   worker\r\n\r\nproductivity by allowing in sufficient numbers  so\r\n\r\nas to keep wages and salaries down. Our dilemma is\r\n\r\nthat, on  the  one hand, wages and  salaries  are\r\n\r\ncontributions  to  the  G.N.P. and  hence,  other\r\n\r\nthings  being equal, maximising wages and salaries\r\n\r\nwould  maximise the G.N.P. And on the other  hand,\r\n\r\nwage   and   salary   increases   unwarranted   by\r\n\r\nproductivity gains can surely hurt us by dampening\r\n\r\ninvestment,  both  local and  foreign.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nSir,  I think some kind of balance in this respect\r\n\r\nwould have to be struck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third point in regard to the immigration policy\r\n\r\nis  the possible political repercussions. As  long\r\n\r\nas  the  flow of such workers is inwards, no  such\r\n\r\nproblem  conceivably  arises,  apart  from   other\r\n\r\nnations'  concern  about a  brain  drain.  In  the\r\n\r\neventuality   of  any  recession   in   Singapore.\r\n\r\nhowever,  the  resulting retrenchment  of  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  could  give  rise to  political  problems\r\n\r\nparticularly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif  the numbers are significant. I must hasten\r\n\r\nto  add,  Sir, that this has not happened as  yet,\r\n\r\nbut we should be prepared for such an eventuality.\r\n\r\nHence,  as I have said earlier, we should exercise\r\n\r\nextra caution and selectivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point concerns the economic growth and\r\n\r\nsocial  fabric.  Mr  Speaker.  Sir,  I  get   the\r\n\r\nimpression,  after  reading the Budget  statement,\r\n\r\nthat our Finance Minister seems rather envious  of\r\n\r\nthe  Japanese  growth and savings  rates.  I  have\r\n\r\nalready pointed out that, in our context,  a  high\r\n\r\nG.D.P. rate   need   not  necessarily   mean   a\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly high G.N.P. growth rate. But  even\r\n\r\nwith  a high G.N.P. growth rate, the danger arises\r\n\r\nin  that  our social fabric might not be  able  to\r\n\r\ncope  with the ensuing rapid changes in  style  of\r\n\r\nliving.  Furthermore,  we would  also  see  severe\r\n\r\nstrains    upon   the   economic   and    physical\r\n\r\ninfrastructure   together   with   the   attendant\r\n\r\nproblems of pollution of air, land and sea. Should\r\n\r\nwe  not then moderate our ambitions and settle for\r\n\r\na  realistic pace of economic change? We certainly\r\n\r\nwould  not  want,  I am sure, any political  shift\r\n\r\nthat   might  attend  rapid  social  and  economic\r\n\r\nchanges?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the subject of the British military\r\n\r\npull-out.  Looking into the immediate future,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance has drawn our attention  to\r\n\r\nthe  expenditure effects of some $250 million  to\r\n\r\n$300  million from the final phase of the British\r\n\r\nwithdrawal. In addition, we face the prospect of a\r\n\r\ndampening  of  world trade. The question  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask is this: have we drawn up plans  for\r\n\r\nmitigating    or    offsetting    the    otherwise\r\n\r\ndeflationary  impact  of  the  two  factors?   The\r\n\r\nFinance Minister mentioned the running down of the\r\n\r\nforeign  exchange reserves. There are,  therefore,\r\n\r\ntwo points that many be worthy of notice. First of\r\n\r\nall,  I  believe  we can reduce the anti-deflation\r\n\r\nexpenditure  somewhat if we  chose  projects  that\r\n\r\nhave  low  import  leakage.  Secondly,  we  should\r\n\r\nresist the temptation to raise taxes. Depending on\r\n\r\nthe incidence of such taxation, the overall effect\r\n\r\nwould be deflationary. Instead, if capital markets\r\n\r\nabroad\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nloosen  up, we should borrow from abroad.  But  in\r\n\r\nany  case, our non-monetary reserves would be more\r\n\r\nthan adequate for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the question of the profitability\r\n\r\nof  Government enterprises. We in this House  have\r\n\r\nhad   on   several   occasions  touched   on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   participation  in   a   number   of\r\n\r\nenterprises, both wholly - and partly-owned.  All\r\n\r\nwe  know  about  them is that  so  much  has  been\r\n\r\ninvested.  Perhaps the Minister  for  Finance  can\r\n\r\nenlighten this House on the profitability of these\r\n\r\nventures,  that  is, the rates of return  we  have\r\n\r\nearned  on  them.  I think in reply  to  questions\r\n\r\nyesterday,  the  Minister threw  little  light  on\r\n\r\nthem. He gave only an example, but then what about\r\n\r\nthe rest?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point arising out of the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister's observations concerns under-employment.\r\n\r\nHe  made an observation on the tight labour market\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to skilled and semi-skilled  labour.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there would appear to be a  category  of\r\n\r\npeople  labelled under-employed. These are  either\r\n\r\nwhite-collar aspirants or else Primary VI rejects,\r\n\r\nand  they  are mostly young, and largely sheltered\r\n\r\nby  familial structures. And yearly we add to  the\r\n\r\nlist,  if  only  via  Primary  VI  rejections.  My\r\n\r\nquestion  is: what can we do about this  category?\r\n\r\nWe  take  care  of those who survive  the  Primary\r\n\r\nSchool  Leaving Examination in either academic  or\r\n\r\ntechnical education. I believe the Government  did\r\n\r\nattempt  to  do  something by  opening  vocational\r\n\r\nschools.  But such schools have now been  replaced\r\n\r\nby Industrial Training Centres. Hence, the problem\r\n\r\nof  this  lot  of under-employed  has  yet  to  be\r\n\r\nsolved. Therefore, something should be done  about\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that the Finance Minister did not\r\n\r\ntouch  on  the Vietnam issue. With the accelerated\r\n\r\nreduction of U.S. military expenditure in Vietnam,\r\n\r\nour trade in that area will be affected. It may be\r\n\r\nthat  the  volume of trade is small, but certainly\r\n\r\none  cannot say that it is negligible. Perhaps the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister would care to comment on  how  it\r\n\r\nwill affect our trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my last point concerns the near standstill\r\n\r\nexpenditure on social services. My question is: is\r\n\r\nthis  justified in view of all the gains  we  have\r\n\r\nmade  in  the  G.N.P. growth? Sir, I  notice  that\r\n\r\nthere  are other Back-benchers who are also  eager\r\n\r\nto  have their say on the Budget statement  and  I\r\n\r\nwould now like to close my remarks by saying  that\r\n\r\nI fully support the motion so moved by the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister. I also hope he will clarify what I  have\r\n\r\njust  raised,  for  I  must admit  that  I  am  no\r\n\r\neconomist  but am just trying to fulfil my  duties\r\n\r\nlike others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we are glad to hear the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  make  the  announcement  in  his  Budget\r\n\r\nstatement for the coming financial year that there\r\n\r\nwill  be no increase in the present taxes  or  the\r\n\r\ncreation  of  new  ones. This is  a  very  welcome\r\n\r\nstatement.  In spite of the fact that our  country\r\n\r\nis  faced with the imminent withdrawal of  British\r\n\r\ntroops  with a consequent increase in our  defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure, our revenue has reached the figure of\r\n\r\n$1,041,200,000. Comparing this figure with that of\r\n\r\n1969,  the  revenue  estimate  has  increased   by\r\n\r\n$106,800,000.  After transferring $40  million  to\r\n\r\nthe  Development Fund and meeting the  expenditure\r\n\r\nof  $1,040,920,780, there is still  a  surplus  of\r\n\r\n$348,220.  There is no deficit.  This  is  a  good\r\n\r\nreflection  of  our  economic  achievements  since\r\n\r\nindependence. Our economic growth has  enabled  us\r\n\r\nto  meet our increased expenditure. It also  shows\r\n\r\nhow,  with preparation, the Government is able  to\r\n\r\nachieve  these results. It has also been  able  to\r\n\r\ncreate  a  mild boom in its economic  development.\r\n\r\nThis  has  injected confidence into our people  in\r\n\r\nthe future of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in discussing this painless budget, allow\r\n\r\nme  to  express  my feelings which come  from  the\r\n\r\nbottom of my heart. First, the economic prosperity\r\n\r\nwe  have achieved seems to have the appearance  of\r\n\r\ndemocratic   socialism.  But   fundamentally   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrealised  the  principle of democratic  socialism.\r\n\r\nSecondly, as regards the livelihood of the people,\r\n\r\nthe  working class has made their contribution  to\r\n\r\nour  economic  development.  Yet  what  they  have\r\n\r\nreceived  in return has been less than  what  they\r\n\r\nhave  paid for in their efforts. To put it simply,\r\n\r\nfrom  what we can see of the economic development\r\n\r\nof our country, the Government has not made a fair\r\n\r\ndistribution   of  the  fruits  of  our   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment, because there is still a gulf between\r\n\r\nthe rich and the poor in our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has pointed out that the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act, 1968, has been supported  by  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. This shows that our people are determined\r\n\r\nto overcome the present difficulties and that they\r\n\r\nare  willing to make sacrifices in order to ensure\r\n\r\na  better future. He has also pointed out that  in\r\n\r\nthis  way  foreign  investors  will  be  able   to\r\n\r\nrecognise  in  our people a trustworthiness  which\r\n\r\ncan  ensure the success of their investments.  The\r\n\r\nworking class has contributed much to the progress\r\n\r\nof  industrialisation, and has sacrificed a lot in\r\n\r\nthe   interest  of  the  country.  However,   some\r\n\r\ncapitalists use the Employment Act to exploit  the\r\n\r\nfundamental interests of the workers in  order  to\r\n\r\nenrich  themselves.  The Government  has  now  and\r\n\r\nagain said that it would take action to deal  with\r\n\r\nthose capitalists who exploit labour. But this  is\r\n\r\nonly  lip-service. From this, we can see that the\r\n\r\nGovernment has not taken any strict measures  to\r\n\r\ncheck  management in order that the  interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  working  class can be safeguarded.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nwelfare   of  the  working  class  is   also   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of the Government.  It  should  be\r\n\r\nsafeguarded.  I  want to stress that  the  working\r\n\r\nclass  is  prepared to meet the challenge  of  the\r\n\r\nage.  They are willing to sacrifice their personal\r\n\r\ninterests in order to help the Government  make  a\r\n\r\nsuccess   of   its  industrialisation   programme.\r\n\r\nHowever,  locally-produced goods are  not  cheaper\r\n\r\nthan  imported  goods. We have strongly  supported\r\n\r\nlocal  industries, and yet locally-produced  goods\r\n\r\nare more expensive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan  imported  goods. For instance, fire-crackers\r\n\r\nare  locally  produced. We can also  get  imported\r\n\r\nfire-crackers which are subject to tax.  But  both\r\n\r\nimported  and  locally-produced fire-crackers  are\r\n\r\nsold at 35 cents per packet. Therefore, we can see\r\n\r\nthat  the  local product is not cheaper  than  the\r\n\r\nimported  crackers. We have made our contributions\r\n\r\nand  sacrifices, and yet we have not  enjoyed  the\r\n\r\nfruits of our sacrifices. When imported goods  can\r\n\r\nbe  sold  cheaper than our locally-produced  goods\r\n\r\neven  after  they have been taxed, we can  see-how\r\n\r\nexpensive  our  local  products  are.   There   is\r\n\r\nsomething wrong here. It seems that the Government\r\n\r\nwants  only our people to make sacrifices. On  the\r\n\r\nother hand, it has been more courteous towards the\r\n\r\ncapitalists.  Sir, I do not mean to frighten  away\r\n\r\nthe capitalists from investing in our country. But\r\n\r\nwhat I want to point out is that the encouragement\r\n\r\nof  foreign  investment in our country  should  be\r\n\r\nbased  on the principle of mutual benefit. If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment were to take a placating and  cringing\r\n\r\nattitude  towards  the capitalists  in  order  to\r\n\r\nencourage  foreign investment here, it would  only\r\n\r\nexpose  the  inability  and  foolishness  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  It  would also show that  it  is  not\r\n\r\nadhering to its principle of democratic socialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the Budget statement, we can see that\r\n\r\nthe  efforts of our people produced $414.3 million\r\n\r\nfor the manufacturing sector in 1965. In 1966,  it\r\n\r\nincreased to $486.8 million - an increase  of  $72\r\n\r\nmillion.  Private sector investment also increased\r\n\r\nfrom $233 million in 1966 to $596 million in 1969,\r\n\r\nshowing  an increase of 156 per cent. I am quoting\r\n\r\nthese  figures in order to show that, as a result\r\n\r\nof the sacrifices and hard work of our people, our\r\n\r\ncountry has been able to overcome its difficulties\r\n\r\nand  has  achieved the present mild  boom  in  our\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this period, the Government has improved the living conditions of a few high-ranking\r\n\r\nGovernment  officers  and  also  increased   their\r\n\r\nallowances.  For  instance,  a  Mercedes  car   is\r\n\r\nprovided  free to every one of these  officers  in\r\n\r\norder that they can better serve the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment. The total cost of seven Mercedes  cars\r\n\r\nis  more  than $110,000. I do not deny that  these\r\n\r\nhigh-ranking Government officers have  contributed\r\n\r\na  great  deal  to the country. In a  way,  it  is\r\n\r\nproper  to give them incentives so that  they  can\r\n\r\nbetter  serve the Government. But the crux of  the\r\n\r\nquestion  is  that  we  should  not  neglect   the\r\n\r\ncontribution  made by the working class  who  have\r\n\r\ntaken part in the building of our country. Why  is\r\n\r\nit  that the living standard of the working  class\r\n\r\nhas  not been raised? Furthermore, Government  has\r\n\r\nnot  introduced  measures to  improve  the  living\r\n\r\nstandard of the working class. Sir, I am sure  you\r\n\r\nwill  agree  with  me  that  if  we  are  to  give\r\n\r\nincentives  to Government servants so  that  they\r\n\r\ncan  serve  the country better and make them  feel\r\n\r\nsecure  in  their posts, we should not forget  the\r\n\r\nlot of the general masses. When these high-ranking\r\n\r\nGovernment   officers  in  air-conditioned   rooms\r\n\r\nformulate  schemes, they have to  depend  on  the\r\n\r\ngeneral masses to carry them out. When the general\r\n\r\nmasses cannot carry out these schemes they will be\r\n\r\nmade scapegoats. And we, as Members of Parliament,\r\n\r\nwill also become scapegoats of these officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about Members of Parliament, our duties\r\n\r\nin the constituencies have increased considerably.\r\n\r\nAfter  a  lapse of ten years and in spite  of  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in our work, our parliamentary allowance\r\n\r\nof   $500   has  not  been  increased.  In   other\r\n\r\ncountries, the M.P.s have ways and means to enrich\r\n\r\nthemselves. But we are a different lot here and we\r\n\r\ndo not think of enriching ourselves. If we compare\r\n\r\nourselves with the M.P.s of other countries, we do\r\n\r\nmore work in the constituencies and we are serving\r\n\r\nthe  masses even though our allowance has not been\r\n\r\nincreased. This is an example for all to  see  and\r\n\r\nemulate.  Sir,  I have given this example  but  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not mean that I am making a request  for  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in  our  allowance.  I  have   no   such\r\n\r\nintention. The main purpose in giving this example\r\n\r\nis  to  compare the M.P.s here with the  M.P.s  of\r\n\r\nother countries. And also to urge all our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM.P.s   to  adhere  to  our  democratic  socialist\r\n\r\nprinciples and march along this path in  order  to\r\n\r\nbuild  a  better and fairer society. In  order  to\r\n\r\nachieve  this ideal, we have to take the necessary\r\n\r\nmeasures.   There   must  be  a  balance   between\r\n\r\nproduction  and consumption. We must also  try  to\r\n\r\nnarrow  the  gap between the rich  and  the  poor.\r\n\r\nThere  should be better safeguards for the working\r\n\r\nclass,  and  production  must  be  increased.  The\r\n\r\nworkers' living standard should be raised so  that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  a  fairer  distribution  of   the\r\n\r\neconomic  fruits. We should aim at these targets,\r\n\r\nand not allow our society to be manipulated by the\r\n\r\nrich.  Only  by  these means can we eliminate  the\r\n\r\nexploitation of the working class and  bridge  the\r\n\r\ngap between the rich and the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will agree with me that the main task of\r\n\r\nthe Government is to look after the welfare of the\r\n\r\npeople  and  to  increase  the  rewards  for  the\r\n\r\nworking  class  so  that they  can  improve  their\r\n\r\nlivelihood  and  also  to  provide  for  the  next\r\n\r\ngeneration. The Government must also take steps to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  purchasing power  of  the  working\r\n\r\nclass. Of course, it will have to proceed with its\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme. But I  feel  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  process, we should synchronize it  with  our\r\n\r\npolicy  of  democratic  socialism  in  order   to\r\n\r\nincrease  the benefits of production so that  they\r\n\r\ncan be shared equally by all the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I do not advocate that the\r\n\r\nGovernment should do away with private enterprise.\r\n\r\nAll  private enterprises, in so far as they do not\r\n\r\nact  against  the interest of the people  and  the\r\n\r\nnation,   should  receive  assistance   from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in order to increase production  and\r\n\r\nefficiency.  The rich are still in an advantageous\r\n\r\nposition.  For instance, we have heard  from  many\r\n\r\nhawkers   complaining  that  they  have   suffered\r\n\r\nconsiderably  under the urban renewal  scheme.  I\r\n\r\nfully  support  the  redevelopment  of  the  urban\r\n\r\nareas, but we should also realise that some people\r\n\r\nwould be affected as a result of the urban renewal\r\n\r\nscheme. Redevelopment affects different people  in\r\n\r\ndifferent  ways. On the one hand,  some  investors\r\n\r\nwould\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreap  huge profits, but, on the other hand,  small\r\n\r\nmerchants would sustain severe losses. Some  might\r\n\r\neven  go bankrupt. This is because they are unable\r\n\r\nto   adapt   to  their  new  situation   and   new\r\n\r\nenvironment. I am sure the Government can get  all\r\n\r\nthese  facts from the Ministry of Law and National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.   Though   the   Government    awards\r\n\r\ncompensation to the people affected, it should be\r\n\r\nstressed  that  the  amount of compensation  given\r\n\r\ncannot  make  up  for their suffering.  The  high-ranking Government officers who stay in their air-conditioned rooms cannot appreciate the extent  of\r\n\r\ntheir sufferings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the concessions given to those who are\r\n\r\nforced  to  remove, the actual fact is  that  they\r\n\r\nhave no choice. Though they are given concessions,\r\n\r\nthe  type  of dwellings or shophouses,  the  cruel\r\n\r\nfact is that everything boils down to money in the\r\n\r\nfinal  analysis. What the Government cares for  is\r\n\r\nalso  money. Small merchants have not been successful  in  competing  with larger  capitalists  when\r\n\r\ntendering for premises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about small hawkers, this question again\r\n\r\nmakes  us  realise  that  the  Government  is  not\r\n\r\ndealing  with  matters  based  on  the  spirit  of\r\n\r\ndemocratic socialism. First of all, I should point\r\n\r\nout  that  as  our Government is  elected  by  the\r\n\r\npeople,  we should act according to the manifesto\r\n\r\nwe  put up during the elections. We must have  the\r\n\r\nagreement  of the people first before we implement\r\n\r\nany  new policy. In this way we can be true to our\r\n\r\npeople.  They  will therefore support  us  because\r\n\r\nthey feel that we have fulfilled our promises. How\r\n\r\nare  we  going to explain to the people in  great\r\n\r\ndetail  that we could not fulfil all our promises,\r\n\r\nas  pledged,  because of the  changing  times?  We\r\n\r\nshould  make  ourselves clear to  the  people  and\r\n\r\nexplain  the present changes to them. We are  duty\r\n\r\nbound to explain to the people who have elected us\r\n\r\nto this House why certain measures are impractical\r\n\r\nand cannot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  implemented. In my view the Government has not\r\n\r\nacted according to the spirit and principle of its\r\n\r\nmanifesto, in dealing with the hawkers.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  hardship  of the  hawkers  has  been\r\n\r\nresolved to some extent. However, they still  face\r\n\r\nsome  problems,  for  instance,  the  increase  in\r\n\r\nhawkers' licence fees. The Government's policy  on\r\n\r\nhawkers needs to be changed so that they  may  be\r\n\r\nbetter  treated.  When we increase  their  licence\r\n\r\nfees,  we  are imposing a greater burden on  them,\r\n\r\nthough  the additional sum extracted from them  is\r\n\r\nto  be used for health and environmental services.\r\n\r\nWhy  do  the  Government not think of measures  to\r\n\r\nprevent  the evasion of tax by the \"big fish\"?  It\r\n\r\nis  an  open  secret that rich  people  have  been\r\n\r\nevading   taxes.   Instead,  the   Government   is\r\n\r\nincreasing the tax on hawkers' licences. This kind\r\n\r\nof  action  is  not  appropriate.  I  believe  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  by  paying attention to  this  point,\r\n\r\nwill  be able to get more revenue from people  who\r\n\r\nhave been evading taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge the Government to take note that to\r\n\r\ntax  the hawkers would only increase their  burden\r\n\r\nand   suffering.  They  are  already  finding   it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  make ends meet. In  the  end,  they\r\n\r\nwould  form the habit of borrowing from  chit-fund\r\n\r\ncompanies,  which  are now flourishing, to  solve\r\n\r\ntheir   financial  difficulties.   The   chit-fund\r\n\r\ncompanies thus become blood-sucking vampires.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, when  small merchants remove  to  other\r\n\r\naccommodation because of the urban renewal scheme,\r\n\r\nthey  will have to pay a lot of money like initial\r\n\r\ndown-payment, rentals and other necessities. Since\r\n\r\nthey  have  no ready cash, they will have  to  get\r\n\r\nsome  sort of a loan from the chit-fund companies.\r\n\r\nThey will have to pay very high interest rates. In\r\n\r\nthis  way, the poor becomes poorer and  the  rich\r\n\r\nbecomes  richer. Thus the rich would  be  able  to\r\n\r\nexploit  the poor. This has always been the  case.\r\n\r\nThe  legislation  of chit-fund  companies  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will lead to the result  I  have  just\r\n\r\nmentioned. I would like to ask the Government  why\r\n\r\nit  cannot provide the same kind of service as the\r\n\r\nchit-fund\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompanies do for these citizens in order  to  help\r\n\r\nthem improve their livelihood. The Government  can\r\n\r\ncharge  a  low  rate  of interest  as  maintenance\r\n\r\ncharges. In this way, it can help the poor  people\r\n\r\nwhen they need money urgently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Budget statement, we can see that our\r\n\r\nGross  Domestic Product has increased from  $1,968\r\n\r\nmillion in 1959 to $4,833 million in 1969. The per\r\n\r\ncapita  income in 1959 was $1,262 whereas in  1969\r\n\r\nit  was  $2,437.  This goes to show  the  economic\r\n\r\nprogress  of  our country in the past  ten  years.\r\n\r\nHowever,  this rate of economic progress does  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  mean that the standard of  living  of\r\n\r\neveryone in Singapore has gone up, that we are now\r\n\r\nvery well off. Even though about ten years ago the\r\n\r\nper  capita  income  was about  $1,200,  the  poor\r\n\r\npeople  could still put some savings in the  bank,\r\n\r\nbut  now  they do not have enough to live on  even\r\n\r\nthough the per capita income has risen to $2,400.\r\n\r\nThey have to borrow from the chit-fund companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Government to impose a more\r\n\r\nprogressive  tax on the rich people so  that  they\r\n\r\nwill  be taxed more. This is not improper. In this\r\n\r\nway, we can close the gap between the rich and the\r\n\r\npoor people of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to come down to the root of the matter. If\r\n\r\nthe  Government  wants  to realise  its  aims  and\r\n\r\nobjectives  of  democratic  socialism,  it  should\r\n\r\nprovide a fairer and more equal redistribution  of\r\n\r\nwealth.  Though at the beginning this  might  call\r\n\r\nfor  a  small sacrifice from the people,  we  have\r\n\r\nreason  to believe that in the long run they  will\r\n\r\nresolve  to  march forward in order to  achieve  a\r\n\r\nbetter  and a more prosperous future. In this  way\r\n\r\nwe  will be able to instil in our people hopes and\r\n\r\nprospects  for  a  better  future.  Otherwise  the\r\n\r\npolitical  ideas which we have spent much  thought\r\n\r\nin formulating and which we have struggled hard to\r\n\r\nrealise will have no significance. If there is  no\r\n\r\npolitical idealism in our work here in Parliament,\r\n\r\nthen, Sir, may I ask, how can the Government still\r\n\r\nexpect  to receive the support of the masses?  Now\r\n\r\nis the time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor   the   Government  to  implement   a   fairer\r\n\r\ndistribution of wealth for the whole society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, last year when the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  tabled his budget, many new tax proposals\r\n\r\nwere made. However, under his expert guidance,  he\r\n\r\npresented on the 9th of this month a budget  which\r\n\r\ndoes  not  contain  any new  tax  proposals.  This\r\n\r\nbrings  great delight and relief to the people.  I\r\n\r\nfully  support this painless budget,  and  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the next few budgets will be as painless  as\r\n\r\nthis one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Minister, the reason for the\r\n\r\nfavourable balance between revenue and expenditure\r\n\r\nis  due  to \"fast economic expansion and  improved\r\n\r\ntax  administration to provide increased revenue\".\r\n\r\nThe  Government has put in much effort  to  expand\r\n\r\nthe  economy of our country so as to arrive  at  a\r\n\r\nbalanced budget. This is an ideal policy. However,\r\n\r\nwhether  our economic expansion will be  sustained\r\n\r\nis  the  crux of the problem. Whether the  present\r\n\r\neconomic  boom will only be transient  or  whether\r\n\r\nthere   will   be   economic   crises   are    the\r\n\r\nuncertainties of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we should not be complacent\r\n\r\nabout  what  we  have  achieved  in  our  economic\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  The  complete withdrawal  of  British\r\n\r\nforces  by  the  end  of 1971 and  the  world-wide\r\n\r\neconomic   recession  will  affect  the   economic\r\n\r\nprogress of our country. This was clearly  pointed\r\n\r\nout  in the Minister's Budget statement. It  is  a\r\n\r\nwarning signal to our people - that if we  do  not\r\n\r\ntake   steps  now  to  prepare  for  such  adverse\r\n\r\neventualities, we shall be faced with all sorts of\r\n\r\nthreats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no doubt we have experienced an economic\r\n\r\nexpansion  over the last decade. But whether  this\r\n\r\nwill  be sustained is a problem into which we must\r\n\r\nlook.  Investors have taken advantage of  all  the\r\n\r\nincentives and concessions that the Government has\r\n\r\noffered them. But they are only concerned with the\r\n\r\nshort-term returns and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterest  on  their  investments.  This  can  only\r\n\r\nresult in the poor quality of their products. Such\r\n\r\nventures  and  enterprises will  not  be  able  to\r\n\r\nsurvive  for long. They are a source of disruption\r\n\r\nto   our   economy.   Sir,  such   investors   and\r\n\r\nenterprises should be controlled by the Government\r\n\r\nso  that  they will not misuse the incentives  and\r\n\r\nconcessions offered to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.09 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has\r\n\r\ntaken  about  two  hours  to  deliver  his  Budget\r\n\r\nstatement. It reveals in great detail the progress\r\n\r\nof  our  economy  over  the  past  ten  years.  It\r\n\r\nanalyses   the  various  stages  of  our  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment over the last decade, and has  arrived\r\n\r\nat   a  very  logical  conclusion.  Obviously  the\r\n\r\nMinister has taken much time in its preparation in\r\n\r\norder  to  draw up such a comprehensive statement.\r\n\r\nThe   spirit  shown  by  the  Minister  is  really\r\n\r\npraiseworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past ten years we have experienced\r\n\r\nvarious  difficulties and drawbacks. For instance,\r\n\r\nin  1961-63 there were political disturbances when\r\n\r\nanti-national elements created trouble everywhere,\r\n\r\ntrying  to  destroy  our  national  existence.  In\r\n\r\n1963-65  there  was  the Indonesian  confrontation\r\n\r\nwhich  made the Indonesians stop trading with  us.\r\n\r\nThis period slowed down our economic progress. But\r\n\r\nunder  the  able  leadership  and  policy  of  our\r\n\r\nGovernment, together with the joint efforts of our\r\n\r\npeople  of all races and classes, we were able  to\r\n\r\novercome  these  difficulties  and  we  now  march\r\n\r\nsteadily on to economic construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these grand economic and social achievements,\r\n\r\nit  is necessary to mention the following: (1) the\r\n\r\nachievements  in building construction.  Over  the\r\n\r\npast ten years we have built 100,000 units of low-cost  housing.  This  has  solved  our  housing  shortage  problem. (2) The building of industries.\r\n\r\nOver  the  past  eight years we have  successfully\r\n\r\nlaid a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsound foundation to our industries, and industrial\r\n\r\nproduce  has increased. For instance, in 1959  the\r\n\r\nindustrial  sector's  contribution  to  our  Gross\r\n\r\nDomestic  Product  was $256 million.  However,  by\r\n\r\n1969 this increased to $1,154 million. There was a\r\n\r\ngreat  increase  in the number of jobs  available.\r\n\r\nAccording to statistics, by the end of 1969  about\r\n\r\n87,000   jobs  were  created.  This   solved   our\r\n\r\nunemployment problem to a great extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the high rate of our economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment, we have also made achievements in the\r\n\r\nfields  of  education  and  social  services.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, we have successfully maintained our free\r\n\r\nuniversal primary education, and have done well in\r\n\r\nour   eradication  of  illiteracy.  We  have  also\r\n\r\nimproved    our   technological   and   scientific\r\n\r\neducation.  This stream of education will  provide\r\n\r\nhigh calibre personnel in large numbers needed for\r\n\r\nour  nation building. Moreover, as a result of our\r\n\r\nimproved educational programmes, more and more  of\r\n\r\nour  people  will be better educated and  equipped\r\n\r\nwith  modern  technological knowledge. Undoubtedly\r\n\r\nthey   will  become  the  future  elite   of   our\r\n\r\ncitizenry.  Further,  over  the  past  few  years,\r\n\r\nbecause of a nation-wide family planning campaign,\r\n\r\nour  population growth has decreased from  40  per\r\n\r\n1,000 to the present 18 per 1,000. As a result  of\r\n\r\nthe  judicious planning of the Ministry of  Health\r\n\r\nover  the  past two years, a nation-wide  cleaning\r\n\r\ncampaign  was launched, and with the joint  effort\r\n\r\nof  the  people  we  have,  in  fact,  become  the\r\n\r\ncleanest country in the whole of Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these good performances clearly show that, in\r\n\r\nspite   of  the  various  political  and  economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties,  we have been able to overcome  them\r\n\r\nand,  in  fact, have even achieved  much  in  the\r\n\r\nl960s.  These achievements have been greater  than\r\n\r\nanything  obtained in other countries in Southeast\r\n\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the Minister for Finance that\r\n\r\nin  our  society there is greater social  cohesion\r\n\r\nand a higher degree of social discipline and self-reliance.

For instance, the members of the various\r\n\r\nCitizens'  Consultative Committees, the  community\r\n\r\ncentre  managements,  and the  committees  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  city  organisations, give  very  concrete\r\n\r\nexamples of their dedicated service to our country\r\n\r\nand  our  people. All this shows that  our  people\r\n\r\nhave  good qualities of character. Another example\r\n\r\nis that during the confrontation period our people\r\n\r\nquickly rallied round the Government when the call\r\n\r\nfor  national  defence was made. They  immediately\r\n\r\njoined  the  Vigilante  Corps.  The  present  good\r\n\r\nresponse  of  our  youths to national  service  is\r\n\r\nanother concrete example of the dedication of  our\r\n\r\npeople.  This  shows  that the  character  of  our\r\n\r\npeople  has  been  lifted to a higher  plane  -  a\r\n\r\nnecessary  quality  for nation  building  and  one\r\n\r\nwhich will ensure success for our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are an emigrant society. During the colonial\r\n\r\nperiod we lacked a sense of group living. However,\r\n\r\nsince  our  independence, we  have  been  able  to\r\n\r\ninculcate  this  good quality in our  people.  Our\r\n\r\nsuccess  so  far  has  been due  mainly  to  three\r\n\r\nfactors. First, the Government's intimate  contact\r\n\r\nwith the people. The national leaders are able  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss   with   the   people   various   problems\r\n\r\nconfronting the country and thus inculcate in them\r\n\r\na  sense  of patriotism. Secondly, the educational\r\n\r\nand  cultural  levels  of  the  people  have  been\r\n\r\ngenerally raised. They have a deeper understanding\r\n\r\nof  the problems confronting our country. Thirdly,\r\n\r\ngreater   use   has   been  made   of   the   mass\r\n\r\ncommunication media, such as the newspapers,  T.V.\r\n\r\nand  the  radio. This has increased the  sense  of\r\n\r\npatriotism of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read the Budget statement many times and I\r\n\r\nam  sure the Finance Minister has made an accurate\r\n\r\nanalysis  of our economic situation and  that  our\r\n\r\nfuture   is  bright.  Of  course,  we  have   been\r\n\r\nstressing  the  fact that the  1970s  will  be  a\r\n\r\nperiod of trial and challenge to us in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nview of the British withdrawal by the end of 1971.\r\n\r\nWe  have to bear the full brunt of maintaining our\r\n\r\nown  defence and security and their effects on our\r\n\r\neconomic  development. We are confident of  facing\r\n\r\nthe  future, because it is an undeniable fact that\r\n\r\nwe have various factors in our favour. Our foreign\r\n\r\nreserves  stand  at  $2,445 million,  a  four-fold\r\n\r\nincrease in four years. This will ensure that  our\r\n\r\ncurrency  is stable and consequently international\r\n\r\ninvestors  will  have greater  confidence  in  our\r\n\r\ncountry. We have also done well in developing  our\r\n\r\ninternal economy; for instance, the development of\r\n\r\nnew      industries,     shipbuilding,     housing\r\n\r\nconstruction,  tourism, an  increase  in  external\r\n\r\ntrade   and  the  undertaking  of  urban   renewal\r\n\r\nprojects. We have progressed in all these  fields.\r\n\r\nIf  present  conditions  continue  in  the  coming\r\n\r\nyears,  we  will be able to maintain our  economic\r\n\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present budget, the estimate for defence is\r\n\r\n$328,670,000.  Next comes social  services,  which\r\n\r\ntakes  up $319 million. Following these two  items\r\n\r\nis  the estimated expenditure for statutory boards\r\n\r\nand other economic services which cost a large sum\r\n\r\nof  money.  Every year the Development  Fund  will\r\n\r\nreceive  about  $30 million to $40  million  which\r\n\r\nwill   ensure   the  success  of  our  development\r\n\r\nprogrammes. Defence has taken the biggest  cut  in\r\n\r\nour  budget.  This  is because the  Government  is\r\n\r\ntaking  immediate steps to strengthen our  defence\r\n\r\nin  order  to  meet the situation created  by  the\r\n\r\nwithdrawal of British troops in 1971. This  is  to\r\n\r\nensure that we are able to exist as an independent\r\n\r\ncountry. This is the correct action to take, and I\r\n\r\nam   sure   all   our  people  will   give   their\r\n\r\nwholehearted support to the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in spite of the increased expenditure on\r\n\r\ndefence,  the  Government has  not  neglected  its\r\n\r\nresponsibilities on education. In the  budget  for\r\n\r\nnext  year,  $3.9  million  is  allocated  to  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Singapore, Nanyang University,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Polytechnic and Ngee Ann College.  There\r\n\r\nis  thus  a  nine per cent increase in expenditure\r\n\r\nover  that  of  last  year in the  development  of\r\n\r\nhigher\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducation.  This is to ensure that we can  produce\r\n\r\npeople  of  high  calibre to help  in  our  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding. This is a good measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of immigration and\r\n\r\nthe  granting  of  citizenship, the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  has said that the Government  will  relax\r\n\r\nthe regulations for the granting of citizenship. I\r\n\r\nagree  with this measure as it is in the  interest\r\n\r\nof  the country. I hope those who have been living\r\n\r\nin  Singapore for a long time and who possess blue\r\n\r\nidentity cards will be given some consideration in\r\n\r\ntheir applications for Singapore citizenship. They\r\n\r\nhave families in our country who are willing to be\r\n\r\nloyal  citizens. We should grant them  citizenship\r\n\r\nso  that they can make a positive contribution  to\r\n\r\nour country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also necessary to mention that, although\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  increase in taxation,  there  is  a\r\n\r\ncredit  balance  of  about $300,000.  This  speaks\r\n\r\nvolumes  for our Minister for Finance  because  it\r\n\r\nshows his ability and economic acumen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, this is a lively budget. I believe\r\n\r\nthat  with  the present stable political situation\r\n\r\nand  with  continuing prosperity in  our  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  our  Republic will  enjoy  a  better\r\n\r\nyear.  With the joint effort of the people, a  new\r\n\r\nand prosperous era will begin in the 1970s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.23 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have something to say on the\r\n\r\nbudget  for  the  coming year. On the  subject  of\r\n\r\ndefence,  I  must  say that I am not  against  the\r\n\r\ndefence  of  the  country as such,  because  every\r\n\r\ncountry has to defend itself. Every country  needs\r\n\r\nits own armed forces to protect its people. In the\r\n\r\npast,  education has always taken the largest  sum\r\n\r\nof  money.  But  this year defence has  taken  the\r\n\r\nlargest cut, a sum of almost $300 million. This is\r\n\r\ntoo big a burden for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have said that I am not against defence as such.\r\n\r\nBut  the  way we are going about it is  wrong.  We\r\n\r\nhave called up our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyouths for training and the reason why we have  to\r\n\r\nspend   so  much  is  that  national  service   is\r\n\r\ncompulsory.  We should start training  our  youths\r\n\r\nwhen  they are in Secondary I or Secondary II.  All\r\n\r\nSecondary school students should undergo  military\r\n\r\ntraining.  In  this way we can carry out  military\r\n\r\ntraining  free of charge. We do not have to  incur\r\n\r\nsuch  large sums of money on defence. What I  mean\r\n\r\nis that training for national defence should start\r\n\r\nwith  secondary  school  students.  We  must  also\r\n\r\ninduct female students into national service. This\r\n\r\nis  only fair, otherwise we may one day find  that\r\n\r\nall our male citizens are engaged in a war and all\r\n\r\nof them might perhaps be killed. What will be left\r\n\r\nwill  be  only females. Can they produce  children\r\n\r\nwithout  the men! This is wrong. We should  induct\r\n\r\nboth males and females into national service. This\r\n\r\nis  my  opinion. Unfortunately, the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nDefence  is  not  here. But I would  like  him  to\r\n\r\nrevise  his policy on national defence. Only  then\r\n\r\ncan we save a great deal of money. Other countries\r\n\r\nare also doing this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next I come to the question of foreign affairs.\r\n\r\nIn   the  past  we  have  followed  a  policy   of\r\n\r\nneutrality and non-alignment. But now  we  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger neutral. This is wrong. Take, for instance,\r\n\r\nthe  tight rope in the circus. Can the rope  swing\r\n\r\nto the left or to the right during the act? No, it\r\n\r\ncannot.  It  must be firm and straight,  otherwise\r\n\r\nthe  tight-rope walker will fall down. So we  must\r\n\r\nbe  neutral  in order to be safe. We must  not  go\r\n\r\neither to the left or to the right. Whoever  comes\r\n\r\nto  attack  us, let us die together. What  are  we\r\n\r\nafraid  of? If you are afraid, you should  resign.\r\n\r\nNo  one  should  influence our  stand.  We  should\r\n\r\nmaintain  our  neutral and independent  stand.  In\r\n\r\nthis  way,  our economy will prosper and  we  will\r\n\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have changed our policy towards the Bank of\r\n\r\nChina.  This is a failure in our policy. What  are\r\n\r\nwe  afraid of? We are not going on the lines  that\r\n\r\nChina is going on. We should not follow the policy\r\n\r\nof  going  either to the left or to the right  as\r\n\r\nlong as there is money. We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  adopt  a  policy  of  perfect  neutrality,\r\n\r\notherwise  in  the end we are going to  suffer.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  remind the Minister  for  Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs  that  we should be neutral, otherwise  we\r\n\r\nwould be like the man walking on the tight rope in\r\n\r\nthe  circus  who will fall down if the tight  rope\r\n\r\nswings  to  the  left  or to  the  right.  What  a\r\n\r\ndisgrace it will then be. If we go to the left  or\r\n\r\nto  the  right, we  will fall down.  We  must  be\r\n\r\nneutral  and remain in the centre so that  in  the\r\n\r\nend we will reach our objective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  was  in full support of the Government's policy\r\n\r\non the acquisition of land. But now the Government\r\n\r\nseems  to  be  taking over land on the  cheap  and\r\n\r\nselling  it at high prices. Let us have a  bit  of\r\n\r\nfairness in this matter. Without fairness, all the\r\n\r\npeople  will  complain. Let  us  be  fair  to  the\r\n\r\npeople. We cannot suppress the people too much, or\r\n\r\nthey  will rise in rebellion against us. At  least\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers can take an aeroplane  and  fly  to\r\n\r\nsome  other country. But where can I go? For those\r\n\r\nof  us  who  cannot afford to take  an  aeroplane,\r\n\r\nwhere can we go? If we go back to China, what will\r\n\r\nhappen   to  us?  What  about  those  Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament  and the rest of the people who  cannot\r\n\r\ntake aeroplanes and fly to some other country?  So\r\n\r\nwe  must adopt a neutral policy. Only then can our\r\n\r\nfuture be secure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the acquisition of land also,\r\n\r\npeople  are saying that the People's Action  Party\r\n\r\nis  now operating a bean curd shop, and that it is\r\n\r\nselling things. They have said that Singapore  has\r\n\r\nsold  Christmas Island but they dare not say  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. has sold Singapore island!  They  are\r\n\r\nsaying  that the P.A.P. is operating a  bean  curd\r\n\r\nshop.  Mr  Speaker. Sir, you may not  know  about\r\n\r\nbuying  bean curd. Previously bean curd  was  sold\r\n\r\npiece  by piece. How about the P.A.P.? The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nis  also selling bean curd piece by piece. How can\r\n\r\nthis  go on? We cannot allow this state of affairs\r\n\r\nto  go  on. We must be fair, otherwise the  people\r\n\r\nwill  not  be satisfied with our performance.  The\r\n\r\nland that we acquire from our people should not be\r\n\r\nsold to foreigners. Otherwise it would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  similar to the concessions in Shanghai,  where\r\n\r\nplots   of   land  were  divided  up   among   the\r\n\r\nforeigners. We should not do this. We should  sell\r\n\r\nacquired land only to our citizens. If we sell  to\r\n\r\nforeigners,  what are we to do if we are  attacked\r\n\r\nby  foreign  troops? This shows that  we  are  not\r\n\r\npatriotic  enough. I came from China  and  I  know\r\n\r\nwhat imperialism is like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Delta spoke about\r\n\r\nresettlement. She was wrong. How can  we  resettle\r\n\r\npeople?  We should have pity on them. We  must  be\r\n\r\nfair  to them. We must not force them to move from\r\n\r\nplace  to place. As an M.P., I was scolded by people\r\n\r\nwho  were evicted from their houses. It is because\r\n\r\nthey  had a genuine grouse. Last December, as  the\r\n\r\npeople  were  getting ready to celebrate  the  New\r\n\r\nYear, they  were  ordered to  move  out.  If  the\r\n\r\nauthorities wanted them to move out, a few months'\r\n\r\nnotice  should have been given to them. How  could\r\n\r\nthey  celebrate the New Year when they had to move\r\n\r\nout? It was not a Happy New Year for them. Some of\r\n\r\nthe  officers are getting a few thousand  dollars,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  more  than what our Prime  Minister  is\r\n\r\ngetting. This is not the way to do things.How  can\r\n\r\nthe  people tolerate this sort of treatment?  They\r\n\r\ncannot take it any more. They are angry, and  when\r\n\r\nthe  demolition gangs are about to pull down their\r\n\r\nhouses, they arm themselves with weapons. How  can\r\n\r\nwe cope with the situation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of arrears of rent, I must say\r\n\r\nthat  everyone owes rent. But we should not  force\r\n\r\nthem to move out just like that. Our Government is\r\n\r\na  democratic  government and  we  should  not  do\r\n\r\nthings  in  this  way.  The Minister  gets  a  few\r\n\r\nthousand  dollars a month. How much does  he  save\r\n\r\nfrom  this sum? How can people with a few  hundred\r\n\r\ndollars  support  their  families  and  pay   rent\r\n\r\nregularly?  They should be given time  to  pay  up\r\n\r\ntheir  arrears of rent. They should not be  forced\r\n\r\nto  move out. It they are forced to move out, then\r\n\r\ndemocracy becomes suppression and tyranny.  People\r\n\r\nwould rise and rebel against our Government.  What\r\n\r\nare we going to do then? I have seen many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthings.  Where  can we go? Are  we  going  to  the\r\n\r\nhills? Therefore, we must consider the question of\r\n\r\npayment  of arrears of rent. We should  have  pity\r\n\r\nand  look  after  those people who  owe  rent.  We\r\n\r\nshould  not evict those who cannot afford  to  pay\r\n\r\nup.  They just simply cannot afford to pay up. The\r\n\r\nMinister should be more sympathetic. He should see\r\n\r\nfor  himself the circumstances of the  people  who\r\n\r\nare in arrears of rent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  must  also  say that there is no corruption  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,    but   there   is   an   unreasonable\r\n\r\nbureaucracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, congratulations to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  on  his  highly satisfactory  Budget\r\n\r\nstatement. During the last ten years, despite  the\r\n\r\nmany   unexpected  setbacks,  such  as  Indonesian\r\n\r\nconfrontation and the accelerated British military\r\n\r\nwithdrawal,    and    despite    the    apparently\r\n\r\ninsurmountable  problems such as the  unemployment\r\n\r\nsituation, our economic strength has continued  to\r\n\r\nimprove.  Credit must therefore be  given  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and, in particular, the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance   for  having  successfully  steered   our\r\n\r\ncountry  through one of the most difficult periods\r\n\r\nin our history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while the Minister reported considerable\r\n\r\nimprovement in our standard of living and  in  our\r\n\r\neconomic position, I wish to draw his attention to\r\n\r\nsome important matters which affect the livelihood\r\n\r\nof  our  farmers in particular, and  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving of the general public in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will disagree that our industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme,  which  has been a great  success,  has\r\n\r\nbroken  the back of our unemployment problem,  but\r\n\r\nwhile we concentrate on industrialisation, we must\r\n\r\nnot   forget  that  we  should  try  to  be  self-sufficient  as far as possible in food production.\r\n\r\nThrough  the  efforts  of the  Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment in the past few years, we are now  able\r\n\r\nto  produce all the eggs and pork needed  for  our\r\n\r\nhome consumption. I understand that the prices  of\r\n\r\neggs  and pork sold by farmers to wholesalers  are\r\n\r\nvery   much   lower  than  the  prices   paid   by\r\n\r\nhouseholders  in  the  market.  Our  farmers   are\r\n\r\ncomplaining  that, because of the  low  prices  of\r\n\r\neggs  and  pigs  sold  to the  wholesalers,  their\r\n\r\nincome  is hardly sufficient to pay for the  feed-stuff for their hens and pigs. Yet housewives have\r\n\r\nto  pay  high  prices  for pork  bought  from  the\r\n\r\nmarket.  This  situation  affects  not  only   the\r\n\r\nfarmers, but the general public as well, for  when\r\n\r\nthe   prices  of  eggs  and  pork  go  up,   other\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs also follow suit, resulting in an  all-round increase in our cost of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the solution lies in the formation of\r\n\r\nfarmers'  co-operatives. The  farmers  sell  their\r\n\r\nproduce  to the cooperatives which, in turn,  sell\r\n\r\nit  to  the retailers in the market. If the prices\r\n\r\nof  eggs  and  pork are to remain at  the  present\r\n\r\nlevel, and if the public accepts these prices,  at\r\n\r\nleast   the   benefit   goes   to   the   farmers.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if the farmers' selling prices  are\r\n\r\nto  remain, at least the general public benefit by\r\n\r\nhaving  to  pay less for their eggs and pork,  and\r\n\r\nthere  would be a general lowering of our cost  of\r\n\r\nliving.  At present, neither the farmers  nor  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  public  benefit; only the middlemen,  the\r\n\r\nwholesalers,  who  seem to  have  a  grip  on  the\r\n\r\nmarket, benefit. I therefore urge the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  or  the  Minister  responsible  for   co-operative societies to look into this problem  and\r\n\r\nconsider  the formation of farmers' co-operatives.\r\n\r\nThis  will not only be an incentive to the farmers\r\n\r\nto improve their economic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconditions, but also enable the people with  lower\r\n\r\nincome to buy food at cheaper prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n505 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): At the beginning of the l970s and in the midst of\r\n\r\nthe  withdrawal of the British Armed  Forces,  the\r\n\r\nwise  and  resourceful Minister  for  Finance  has\r\n\r\npresented  a  painless Budget, without introducing\r\n\r\nany  new taxes or any increase in the rate of  old\r\n\r\ntaxes.  Needless  to  say,  this  budget  will  be\r\n\r\nwelcomed  with great joy by people from all  walks\r\n\r\nof life. He has given us encouragement, as we step\r\n\r\ninto  the  l970s. He has also given us  a  greater\r\n\r\ndegree of confidence in the future of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are glad and proud of is that about four\r\n\r\nyears ago, after we were forced to leave Malaysia,\r\n\r\nall the people managed to pull themselves together\r\n\r\nand, in a concerted effort, put in a great deal of\r\n\r\nhard  work,  thereby producing the fruits  of  the\r\n\r\nlabour   we  see  today.  We  have  laid  a   firm\r\n\r\nfoundation for our permanent survival. Our economy\r\n\r\nhas  progressed by leaps and bounds each year. Our\r\n\r\nGross  Domestic Product has increased every  year.\r\n\r\nOur  industries have thrived. In fact, what we are\r\n\r\nfacing  now  is  not the problem of creating  more\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities, but the problem  of  the\r\n\r\nshortage  of  labour. In short, the  task  of  our\r\n\r\nnation   building   has  had  a  very   favourable\r\n\r\nbeginning.  As  long  as we  all  learn  from  the\r\n\r\nexperience of our predecessors and work hard,  the\r\n\r\nprosperity  we  enjoy now will be  maintained  and\r\n\r\nfurther  enhanced. However, we should  not  forget\r\n\r\nthat  there  are some people around us  who  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  see us fail. For this reason, we  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to  be  careless in the least.  We  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to  relax.  We  must  stand  firm  in  our\r\n\r\nposition and progress from strength to strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has told the House that\r\n\r\nthe financial policy of the Government is based on\r\n\r\nthe rapid economic growth and relies on the im\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproved  administration to increase the revenue  of\r\n\r\nthe  country. It does not depend on new  taxes  or\r\n\r\nhigher taxes for its revenue. This is a very  wise\r\n\r\nand praiseworthy move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that the Minister, in order to improve\r\n\r\nthe efficiency of tax collection, has set up a new\r\n\r\nAnti-Evasion  Unit with 52 posts.  This  makes  me\r\n\r\nthink that the number of tax evaders must be quite\r\n\r\nconsiderable, otherwise it would not be  necessary\r\n\r\nto  expand  this Unit. I would like  to  tell  the\r\n\r\npeople who evade taxes that paying taxes is  their\r\n\r\nduty.  To  evade  paying taxes is  despicable  and\r\n\r\nimmoral  conduct. There is a Chinese saying  which\r\n\r\ngoes  something  like this: \"What we  obtain  from\r\n\r\nsociety  should be used for the good of  society.\"\r\n\r\nThe  monetary  wealth  that  people  acquire  from\r\n\r\nsociety  should not be exclusively for  their  own\r\n\r\nuse.  Part  of  it should be used to  improve  the\r\n\r\nliving  conditions of the poorer sections  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.  It would be very selfish  of  them  to\r\n\r\nkeep it for their private use. I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthese  people  to think again and to abandon  this\r\n\r\nform  of selfish conduct. I would like to ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister to punish severely those who evade  taxes\r\n\r\nconstantly, because, if nobody attempts  to  evade\r\n\r\ntaxes,  it would not be necessary for the Minister\r\n\r\nto   set  up  this  Anti-Evasion  Unit,  and   the\r\n\r\nexpenditure  for  it could be utilised  for  other\r\n\r\nprojects  which would be beneficial to our  people\r\n\r\nand our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, from the Budget speech of the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance, we all  know  that,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the rapid expansion of our industries,\r\n\r\nthere   is   a   severe  shortage  of   engineers,\r\n\r\ntechnicians  and  skilled  labour.  In  order   to\r\n\r\nsupport  the  expansion  of  our  industries,  the\r\n\r\nauthorities  have decided to relax the immigration\r\n\r\nlaws  so  that  those  with specialised  technical\r\n\r\nskills could come and live in our country and look\r\n\r\nfor  jobs, whereas in the past they had to  get  a\r\n\r\njob  first before they could be allowed to  settle\r\n\r\ndown  here.  On  the one hand,  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance has provided for a larger amount of  money\r\n\r\nto impose stricter immigration laws,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhereas,   on  the  other  hand,  he  is  relaxing\r\n\r\nimmigration   laws.  Is  this  not  a  paradoxical\r\n\r\nsituation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some young people in our country who,\r\n\r\nbecause they are afraid of national service or for\r\n\r\nother  reasons, go overseas to study,  and,  after\r\n\r\nthe  completion of their studies, they do not come\r\n\r\nback.   This  is  a  form  of  brain  drain.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  do  something  to  make  these\r\n\r\npeople come back and play their part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have noticed that the vote\r\n\r\nfor the Ministry of Health has shown a significant\r\n\r\nincrease. The increased provision will, of course,\r\n\r\nmean  that  the  people will  get  better  medical\r\n\r\nservices.  This is most commendable. I would  like\r\n\r\nto  make  use  of  this  opportunity  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance what has  happened  to  his\r\n\r\npromise  that  he would consider the extension  of\r\n\r\nmedical  benefits to the staff of Government-aided\r\n\r\nschools?  When  is  this  extension  going  to  be\r\n\r\nimplemented? I would like to remind  him  that  on\r\n\r\nthe  11th  June  of last year in this  House, the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary, in reply to  a  question\r\n\r\nput by me, said that the question of the extension\r\n\r\nof  medical  benefits to the staff in  Government-aided   schools  was  under  discussion   by   the\r\n\r\nMinistries of Finance, Health and Education at the\r\n\r\nbeginning of 1969. The Parliamentary Secretary had\r\n\r\npromised  that the question would be given  speedy\r\n\r\nconsideration.  This could be  found  in  Hansard,\r\n\r\nVol.  29,  No. 1 (cols. 6-7). Fifteen months  have\r\n\r\nalready passed since the discussions were started.\r\n\r\nI  would  ask  the Minister not to  delay  further\r\n\r\nconsideration of this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.13 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Budget address given by the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  on 9th March, 1970, is a painless  budget\r\n\r\nand  is  a  source of joy and happiness to  people\r\n\r\nfrom  every  stratum of society.  Indeed,  in  the\r\n\r\nmidst  of the imminent run-down of British  forces\r\n\r\nand the decline in British military expenditure,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   the   consequent  increase  in  our  defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  our Government has  not  thought  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  propose new taxes. This  is  indeed\r\n\r\ngood news to the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I would like to point out\r\n\r\nis  that in the vote for Education, I notice  that\r\n\r\nthere is a ratio of three to one between technical\r\n\r\neducation and general education. I feel that  this\r\n\r\npreponderance  in  favour of  technical  education\r\n\r\nshould not be maintained for too long. It is  true\r\n\r\nthat  the  implementation of our industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme requires an army of skilled personnel to\r\n\r\nstaff  all  the factories. But we must admit  that\r\n\r\nthe  boom  and prosperity that we are experiencing\r\n\r\nat  present  is not due to our preoccupation  with\r\n\r\nscientific and technical education alone.  To  put\r\n\r\nit simply, in addition to scientific and technical\r\n\r\neducation, we must also see to it that our  social\r\n\r\nsciences  advance at an equal pace.  Otherwise  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  faced with the prospect of many  of  our\r\n\r\ncitizens   being   merely   tools   for   economic\r\n\r\nproduction,  without a corps of economic  planners\r\n\r\nat  the  helm to guide our economic destiny.  This\r\n\r\nwill  bring about political instability and social\r\n\r\ninsecurity.  And  finally  we  will  come   to   a\r\n\r\ncatastrophic end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me cite an example. Take\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers in the Cabinet. None of them is the\r\n\r\nproduct  of  pure  scientific and technical  education.  Yet  they are able to transform this  small\r\n\r\nisland  of  ours,  without any natural  resources,\r\n\r\ninto  a  land  of prosperity and plenty.  This  is\r\n\r\nindisputable  proof that the study of  the  social\r\n\r\nsciences should not be neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I have noted that the\r\n\r\nprovision  for Social Welfare has been reduced  by\r\n\r\nthe amount of $4 million. This is bad news for the\r\n\r\npoor   section  of  our  population,  and   is   a\r\n\r\nretrogressive  step.  Everyone  knows   that   the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action  Party has  the  support  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  and  was  given a  mandate  to  rule  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  One  of the reasons for its  success  is\r\n\r\nthat   it   runs   a  very  honest,   clean,   and\r\n\r\nincorruptible administration. But more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportant,  the  P.A.P., has all along  been  looking\r\n\r\nafter the welfare of the poor, and its achievement\r\n\r\nin  social welfare services is unrivalled in  this\r\n\r\npart  of the world. Although we know that we  must\r\n\r\nincur  a greater amount of expenditure for Defence\r\n\r\nso  as to enhance our defence capability, it  does\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily mean that we have to cut down our\r\n\r\nprovision  for the poor section of our  community.\r\n\r\nThis  reduced  expenditure  is  particularly  felt\r\n\r\nsince existing private charity organisations  have\r\n\r\nnot  spread  out enough or have not been  able  to\r\n\r\ntake  over  the functions of Government in  social\r\n\r\nwelfare  work?  We  must  not  neglect  the   less\r\n\r\nfortunate sections of our people and allow them to\r\n\r\ndrift   along,  as  this  will  result  in  social\r\n\r\ninsecurity  and  unrest. I am sure the  Government\r\n\r\ncan  easily find this meagre sum of $4 million  to\r\n\r\nprovide for our social welfare services by levying\r\n\r\na  higher  rate  of duty on luxury items  such  as\r\n\r\ncosmetics,  liquor, and tobacco. The poor  section\r\n\r\nof  the  people who will benefit from this measure\r\n\r\nwill then express their boundless gratitude to the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Moreover, by taking this measure,  the\r\n\r\nsocial conditions will be more healthy, and  there\r\n\r\nwill  be less scope for criminal activity  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past years many of us\r\n\r\nin  this House have lavished praise on the  wisdom\r\n\r\nand  far-sightedness  of  our  Finance  Minister's\r\n\r\nbudgets.  Even in those years when an  M.P.'s  life\r\n\r\nwas   made   very  uncomfortable  by  constituency\r\n\r\nqueries and criticisms of new taxation, many of us\r\n\r\ncould  not but have a sneaking admiration for  the\r\n\r\nway  money  was raised, disbursed, and hidden.  I,\r\n\r\nfor one, had this suspicion that total expenditure\r\n\r\ndid not absorb all the taxes collected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is all for the better. Now we are told that\r\n\r\nshould  lean  times really come, we  have  put  on\r\n\r\nsufficient fat to last it out. Looking around  the\r\n\r\ncity. I cannot but agree that the economic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninfrastructure is there. Jurong is  thriving.  New\r\n\r\nindustrial  estates are fully occupied  and  newer\r\n\r\nones are planned and provided for. Never has there\r\n\r\nbeen  so  much money in the bank and  in  people's\r\n\r\npockets.  Unemployment  has  turned  into   labour\r\n\r\nshortage.  And the final proof is this  budget  --which,  in spite of larger demands for development\r\n\r\nand  defence,  relies on increased  prosperity  to\r\n\r\nbring in increased revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The years of belt-tightening have been proved\r\n\r\ntimely and necessary. Now we are able to meet  the\r\n\r\neconomic  consequences of the  British  withdrawal\r\n\r\nwith the confidence derived from a vastly expanded\r\n\r\neconomic  stability  and  a  comfortable   savings\r\n\r\nhoard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have but two observations to make on the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  financial policy for  the  year.  We\r\n\r\nhave large amounts of money stashed away abroad. I\r\n\r\nknow some of it has to be so in order to meet  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of our currency backing. I understand  also\r\n\r\nthat  when we ask for foreign investments in  this\r\n\r\ncountry,  we  ask for technological  know-how  and\r\n\r\ninternational connections just as much as  we  ask\r\n\r\nfor  foreign cash. But are we making the best  out\r\n\r\nof our funds?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the estimate for Interest and\r\n\r\nDividend  income for l969-70 was in the region  of\r\n\r\n$30  million,  and that the estimate  for  the  12\r\n\r\nmonths from 1970-71, instead of 15 months, is over\r\n\r\n$43 million. Taking 12 months for comparison, this\r\n\r\nrevenue is estimated to increase by nearly 90  per\r\n\r\ncent  from these two items. As nearly 70 per  cent\r\n\r\nof  these  two  items  were derived  from  foreign\r\n\r\nsources,  we must have staggering amounts invested\r\n\r\nabroad  in  stocks  and bonds,  probably  more  in\r\n\r\nbonds, as the 1970-71 Estimates show Dividends  at\r\n\r\nabout  5  per cent of interest. Can some of  these\r\n\r\nsums be more profitably used here?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past years the Government has quite\r\n\r\nrightly  placed  a  great  deal  of  interest   in\r\n\r\ninvestments  in  shipbuilding  and  the   shipping\r\n\r\nindustry. Neptune Orient Lines Ltd, has got off to\r\n\r\na good start, and more money is to be lent to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit.  What  I hope the Government has not forgotten\r\n\r\nis  the fishing industry. Just as it was futile to\r\n\r\nwait  until  a big shipbuilder came  here,  it  is\r\n\r\nequally  unrealistic to wait until a  big  fishing\r\n\r\nenterprise decides to establish an industry  here.\r\n\r\nI   would   like  to  recommend  for  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister's consideration the need to start off  as\r\n\r\na  joint  venture or alone, if necessary, a  large\r\n\r\nfishing  industry. In 1968 we imported  nearly  80\r\n\r\nper  cent  of  our fish requirements.  Our  annual\r\n\r\nconsumption   exceeds  60,000  tons.   There   is\r\n\r\ntherefore,  a  fairly substantial home  market  to\r\n\r\nstart  off  with.  But a modern  fishing  industry\r\n\r\nrequires  enormous capital. The Government  should\r\n\r\nstep  in and take the lead, otherwise it will take\r\n\r\na long time before a local firm grows sufficiently\r\n\r\nlarge to be able to afford the capital. And as  no\r\n\r\nforeign  firm  has  shown signs of  investing  the\r\n\r\nlarge sums needed, it would appear that we have to\r\n\r\nfinance  it  ourselves. Just as we  are  financing\r\n\r\nNeptune  Orient Lines, I think we should similarly\r\n\r\nstart our own fishing company. This is perhaps one\r\n\r\nof  the many possible ways in which our funds  can\r\n\r\nbe better used for ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second observation I would like to make is\r\n\r\nthat   there   do  not  appear  to  be  sufficient\r\n\r\nallocations to make Singapore a greener and a more\r\n\r\ngracious  place to live in. I quite  realise  that\r\n\r\nthis  is not the time to spend large sums of money\r\n\r\nfor  parks  and gardens. But follow the  model  of\r\n\r\nJurong Aviary, where a public amenity is entrusted\r\n\r\nto  an incorporated trading company. I would  like\r\n\r\nto  suggest a way in which we can have  a  greener\r\n\r\nand  more  graceful Singapore,  without  too  much\r\n\r\npublic  expenditure. There are  large  numbers  of\r\n\r\npeople  in Singapore who grow orchids as a  hobby.\r\n\r\nBut  there are only a few orchid exporters, and  a\r\n\r\nrather   large  international  market  is   hardly\r\n\r\ntouched.  Hawaii has ceased to be a  major  orchid\r\n\r\nexporter because of prohibitive labour costs. More\r\n\r\npeople in Singapore will grow orchids if an outlet\r\n\r\nis found. Orchid growing can be a profitable hobby\r\n\r\nand if more people take up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norchid  growing, Singapore will be that much  more\r\n\r\nattractive,  It  would  appear,  therefore,   that\r\n\r\norchid  exporting, since it is inadequately served\r\n\r\nby   private  enterprise,  is  a  good  field  for\r\n\r\nGovernment to step in, not only to increase export\r\n\r\nearnings but also to encourage people to like  and\r\n\r\ngrow flowers. I think the Government should set up\r\n\r\na   cooperative  to  promote  the  export  of  our\r\n\r\norchids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I followed with great enthusiasm\r\n\r\nthe  presentation of the budget for the  financial\r\n\r\nyear  1970-71 by the Finance Minister. At the very\r\n\r\noutset,  he  referred  to  \"motion  picture\"   and\r\n\r\n\"snapshots\" while directing the House through  the\r\n\r\nturbulent l960s. In this respect, I would like  to\r\n\r\nassociate  myself with the sentiments and  similes\r\n\r\nexpressed  by  him, and point out  that  both  the\r\n\r\nDirector  and  Producer of this technicolour  film\r\n\r\nhad   made  it  rather  attractive  as  could   be\r\n\r\nvisualised from the \"curvaceous figures\" displayed\r\n\r\nby  the Treasury. To borrow an expression from the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance, the  \"doubling\"  of  Gross\r\n\r\nDomestic  Product  during  the  sixties  is   well\r\n\r\nappreciated, and I am quite confident that  if  we\r\n\r\ncontinue  to compare our performance with  nations\r\n\r\nof  more  or less similar size and population,  it\r\n\r\nwill  provide the necessary stimulus to accelerate\r\n\r\nthe pace during the more challenging seventies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is perfectly true, as mentioned by the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister, that human effort has to a large  extent\r\n\r\ncontributed    to   this   economic    phenomenon.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we can hardly afford to de-emphasise\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that,  apart from  human  endeavour,  a\r\n\r\nstrong   currency,  political  stability   and   a\r\n\r\nresponsible  trade union movement have contributed\r\n\r\na  proportionate share in realising to  a  limited\r\n\r\nextent  the short-run targets of our economy.  The\r\n\r\nnext  decade is likely to be less turbulent  since\r\n\r\nwe have already dealt with the labour pains during\r\n\r\nthe sixties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In analysing the budget in detail, Sir, I have no\r\n\r\nhesitation  in  stating  that  all  sectors   have\r\n\r\nreceived adequate attention, although I might wish\r\n\r\nthat  one  or two sectors perhaps deserve  special\r\n\r\nattention.

From  the  figures  given  by  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister - I am referring to Table 14* - I\r\n\r\nnotice  that  during 1969, the  33  pioneer  firms\r\n\r\nwhich  came  into existence provided 14,200  jobs,\r\n\r\nwhile  in the preceding year, 1968, in the pioneer\r\n\r\nsection,  as a result of the addition  of  44  new\r\n\r\nfirms,  the employment opportunities were only  to\r\n\r\nthe tune of 4,105.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* See Cols. 527-8.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the same period, i.e., 1968, the performance\r\n\r\nof   all   manufacturing  industries  was   rather\r\n\r\nastounding in terms of employment figures. In 1968\r\n\r\napproximately 15,000 workers were absorbed by  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing   sector.  A   close   scrutiny   of\r\n\r\nemployment    figures   for   all    manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustries  during the years 1968 and  1969,  with\r\n\r\nspecial emphasis on the pioneering section for the\r\n\r\nsame  period,  reveals a strange phenomenon.  When\r\n\r\nthe   manufacturing  industries  in  general   are\r\n\r\nexpanding at a very fast pace, the pioneer section\r\n\r\nis  moving in slow motion. On the other hand, for\r\n\r\nthe  year under study, namely, 1969, when  pioneer\r\n\r\nfirms have moved up both in number and employment,\r\n\r\nthe  manufacturing industries (excluding pioneers)\r\n\r\nhave slowed down again in pace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I am not mistaken, from a casual glance\r\n\r\nat  the figures of employment for pioneer firms in\r\n\r\n1968  and 1969, we might conclude that more labour\r\n\r\nintensive  industries  are  entering  the   Jurong\r\n\r\ncomplex.   Perhaps  the  Finance   Minister   will\r\n\r\nconsider it necessary  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  assist  us further in  appreciating  the\r\n\r\ndirection in which the industrialisation programme\r\n\r\nis moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister has not overlooked the fact\r\n\r\nthat   the   phased  programme  of   the   British\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  would  necessarily  have  a   negative\r\n\r\nimpact  on  the economy and measures have  already\r\n\r\nbeen   taken   to  cushion  off  the  effects.   A\r\n\r\nflourishing       entrepot      trade,       rapid\r\n\r\nindustrialisation   with   expansion    of    port\r\n\r\nfacilities,  and  further improvement  in  tourism\r\n\r\ncould form a positive catalyst. The budget for the\r\n\r\nfinancial  year  and  the  analysis  of  our  past\r\n\r\nperformance seem to indicate that the  nation  is moving in the right direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total cargo handled at our port during the\r\n\r\ndecade  has increased nearly two and a half times,\r\n\r\nfrom  14.21 million freight tons in 1959 to  37.90\r\n\r\nmillion  freight tons in 1969, although there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a fall of nearly three million freight  tons\r\n\r\nin  1964  from  the previous year,  apparently,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  due  to  Indonesian confrontation.  But  a\r\n\r\nsignificant   feature  of  the  total  cargo trade\r\n\r\nshowed  that  general cargo handled  at  the  port\r\n\r\nmoved  at  a slow pace over the past decade,  from\r\n\r\n6.40  million freight tons in 1959 to 8.30 million\r\n\r\nfreight  tons in 1969. On the other hand, for  the\r\n\r\nsame  period  the  cargo of  mineral  oil,  mostly\r\n\r\npetroleum,  increased  from 7.74  million  freight\r\n\r\ntons  in  l959  to 29.20 million freight  tons  in\r\n\r\n1969.  Thus,  the lion's share of the total  cargo\r\n\r\ntrade  was taken up by oil, and this pattern might\r\n\r\ncontinue,  especially with, oil exploration  going\r\n\r\non  in neighbouring countries and more refineries.\r\n\r\nspringing   up   in  and  around  Singapore.   But\r\n\r\nsimultaneously with the oil boom, if the  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  continues to flourish and the manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector   responds   to   the  Finance   Minister's\r\n\r\ntreatment,  the  total tonnage  of  general  cargo\r\n\r\nhandled  at the port might rise at a faster  pace.\r\n\r\nIn  this  regard, the expansion of port facilities\r\n\r\nmust  be  planned  even now to meet  the  expected\r\n\r\nrequirements, failing which the Port of  Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority's problems might\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmultiply  manifold and the situation may be  worse\r\n\r\nthan  that which Port Swettenham is facing  today.\r\n\r\nAs  I  can observe from the figures -- I am referring\r\n\r\nto  Table 13* -- during 1966 to 1969 there  was  an\r\n\r\nincrease of 10 million freight tons of mineral oil\r\n\r\nalone,  while the increased general cargo  handled\r\n\r\nfor the same period was 1.86 million freight tons.\r\n\r\nThe  general  cargo handled at  our  port  is  not\r\n\r\nlikely  to remain at the same pace if the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister's   approach  towards   the   challenging\r\n\r\nseventies  bears fruit. Under such  circumstances,\r\n\r\nthe  present facilities will be inadequate. I hope\r\n\r\nthe  Finance  Minister and the Port  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority will take all the necessary factors into\r\n\r\nconsideration to improve the port facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* See Col. 526)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Finance Minister has also\r\n\r\nlaid  sufficient emphasis on education and in this\r\n\r\nregard the expenditure involved could be perfectly\r\n\r\njustified. But I am more concerned to know whether\r\n\r\nthe manpower will be sufficiently tailored to meet\r\n\r\nthe   requirements  of  industrialisation  in  the\r\n\r\nseventies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A casual glance at the statistics provided by the\r\n\r\nFinance   Minister  with  regard  to   the   total\r\n\r\nenrolment  in the educational institutions  during\r\n\r\nthe  last  decade indicates that  in  the  primary\r\n\r\nschools the teacher/student ratio of approximately\r\n\r\n1  to  30 has been consistently maintained  during\r\n\r\nthe  last 10 years. In the secondary schools, too,\r\n\r\nthe ratio is approximately one teacher to every 27\r\n\r\nstudents.  This  also has not changed  during  the\r\n\r\nlast   decade.   In  tertiary  education   it   is\r\n\r\ngratifying  to note that staff/student  ratio  for\r\n\r\n1969  has come up to the level of 1 to 16.  If  we\r\n\r\nmake  a comparative study of other Asian countries\r\n\r\nwith regard to the enrolment of students and staff\r\n\r\nrequirements at tertiary level, I might  say  that\r\n\r\nthe  staff/student ratio in the case of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncan be better appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the primary and secondary school\r\n\r\nteachers in general, I am afraid that of late they\r\n\r\nappear to have been over-burdened with duties  and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities     which,      under      normal\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  should  not  fall   within   their\r\n\r\npurview. It is too much to expect teachers to  pay\r\n\r\nindividual attention to the health problems of the\r\n\r\nstudents,  as  it is not our intention  to  create\r\n\r\nquack  doctors among the teachers. I might suggest\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry  of Education,  with  the  co-operation of the Ministry of Health, should  think\r\n\r\nin  terms  of  establishing first-aid  centres  or\r\n\r\nhealth     clinics    within    the    educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions, preferably with a qualified nurse in\r\n\r\ncharge,  if the Government feels that there  is  a\r\n\r\nnecessity to pay adequate attention to the  health\r\n\r\nproblems  of the pupils during school hours.  Sir,\r\n\r\nif  this suggestion of mine can be implemented, it\r\n\r\nwill solve the unemployment problem of the nursing\r\n\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to comment\r\n\r\non  the  Minister's passing reference to organized\r\n\r\nlabour,  especially  the  National  Trades   Union\r\n\r\nCongress,  for  its co-operation extended  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Sir, I would say that it augurs  well\r\n\r\nfor  a nation in the take-off stage to be able  to\r\n\r\noffer  employment opportunities  to  the  tune  of\r\n\r\napproximately  30,000  jobs  within   two   years!\r\n\r\nIndustries require skilled and semi-skilled labour\r\n\r\nand  both  our Prime Minister and Finance Minister\r\n\r\nhave  emphasised  the  fact  that  our  tempo   of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation has reached  a  stage  where  we\r\n\r\nmight have to think in terms of attracting skilled\r\n\r\nlabour  from  abroad with all  perks  which  could\r\n\r\ncreate the necessary incentives. But, at the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  if  you look at the Monthly Report  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Labour for December 1969 and  January\r\n\r\n1970,   you  will  see  that  approximately  4,800\r\n\r\nskilled   and   semi-skilled   unemployed   labour\r\n\r\ncontinue  to be in the register of the  Employment\r\n\r\nExchange.  Of  course,  I  do  not  rule  out  the\r\n\r\npossibility that the skills that we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequire  for  the  emerging  industries  might  be\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  the  skills  possessed  by  these\r\n\r\npeople  in  the  register of the Labour  Ministry.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we can hardly afford  to  permit  a\r\n\r\nsituation  where  these  categories  of   workers,\r\n\r\nhowever  small they may be, continue to remain  in\r\n\r\nthe register of the Labour Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, I might, with great regret, also\r\n\r\nrefer  to  the  high rate of industrial  accidents\r\n\r\nwhich prevail in our factories today. According to\r\n\r\nthe  Monthly Report of the Ministry of Labour  for\r\n\r\nthe   month  of  January  1970, there  were   136\r\n\r\naccidents reported to the Factory Inspectorate. Of\r\n\r\nthese,   two   were  fatal,  seven   resulted   in\r\n\r\namputation  of  the  workers'  fingers,  and   the\r\n\r\nremaining  127  resulted  in  minor  flesh   cuts,\r\n\r\nbruises, abrasions and burns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is perfectly true that when, in a matter of\r\n\r\ntwo  years,  you have 30,000 workers  put  in  the\r\n\r\nfactory  floor along with the machinery, accidents\r\n\r\nare  bound  to  increase in geometric progression!\r\n\r\nBut  it  need not necessarily mean that we  should\r\n\r\nignore  the situation, because there are  adequate\r\n\r\nprovisions   under   the  Workmen's   Compensation\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I might suggest that the\r\n\r\nfollowing measures could form a basis to cope with\r\n\r\nthe  situation.  The observance  of  International\r\n\r\nLabour  Organisation conventions and their  strict\r\n\r\napplication  to  industrial safety  could  be  the\r\n\r\nfirst  step.  Secondly, it is  possible  that  the\r\n\r\nsudden spurt in industries might have resulted  in\r\n\r\nsidestepping  the necessity to provide  sufficient\r\n\r\nfloor  space  for easy movement. In this  respect,\r\n\r\nearly  inspection  and periodic  checking  by  the\r\n\r\nLabour Ministry might ease the situation. Thirdly,\r\n\r\nindustrialists  should  be encouraged  to  install\r\n\r\nmodern  machinery with automatic  built-in  safety\r\n\r\ndevices  although the cost might be  on  the  high\r\n\r\nside.  Economy  in  such cases  might  cost  human\r\n\r\nlives.  Fourthly,  there  should  be  proper   co-ordination  among  the labour unions,  the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry  and management for a periodic review  of\r\n\r\nthe situation. Fifthly, workers should be educated\r\n\r\nin industrial safety. Lastly,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfirst  aid equipment with qualified nurses  should\r\n\r\nbe  introduced  in  medium-sized  and  large-scale\r\n\r\nfactories  as early as possible. Sir, I  am  quite\r\n\r\nconfident  that  if  the  above  suggestions   are\r\n\r\nimplemented, it could possibly minimise industrial\r\n\r\naccidents so that factories would not present  sad\r\n\r\nspectacles of crippled young workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like  to\r\n\r\nassociate myself with the sentiments expressed  by\r\n\r\nthe    Finance    Minister    with    regard    to\r\n\r\nindustrialisation in the seventies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I thank Back-benchers for\r\n\r\ntheir   various   comments  on  the   Government's\r\n\r\nfinancial  policy? Whether they are in  praise  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government's policy or in criticism of it,  I\r\n\r\nthink  they  have made a valuable contribution  to\r\n\r\nthe  many  important aspects of our  economic  and\r\n\r\nfinancial policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to deal in detail with the points\r\n\r\nraised  by Members. First, the Member for Moulmein\r\n\r\nhas  some reservations about the usefulness of our\r\n\r\npolicy  in  relaxing immigration and  work  permit\r\n\r\nrequirements for certain grades of workers as well\r\n\r\nas  professional personnel. He thinks that we  may\r\n\r\nget third-rate workers and that differences in pay\r\n\r\nbetween local personnel and expatriate staff would\r\n\r\nlead  to discontent. Of course, these dangers  are\r\n\r\ninherent  in  any scheme of relaxing  controls  on\r\n\r\nentry  of  workers. That does, not  mean  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  not try to increase the supply of  workers\r\n\r\nwhich   industry  now  needs  and  will  need   in\r\n\r\nincreasing  measure. Unless we  do  so,  we  shall\r\n\r\nbring  about  a sudden halt in economic  expansion\r\n\r\nand  I  do not think the Member for Moulmein  will\r\n\r\nthink that that is the price that we should pay in\r\n\r\norder  to avoid some dangers. I agree that  these\r\n\r\ndangers exist, but they can be guarded against  by\r\n\r\nother measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's other point is that in some cases\r\n\r\nwhere employees are already\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngetting  very  generous retirement  benefits,  the\r\n\r\nincrease  of  the employer's contribution  to  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Provident  Fund has  not  benefited  them\r\n\r\nbecause   this  increased  contribution   by   the\r\n\r\nemployer offsets the gratuities payable. He thinks\r\n\r\nthat  this  is a bad thing. I am not at  all  sure\r\n\r\nwhether  this is a bad thing. If the employer  has\r\n\r\nbeen  giving  generous retirement  benefits,  then\r\n\r\nobviously  when  we  are  raising  the  level   of\r\n\r\nretirement  benefits, which  is  really  what  the\r\n\r\nProvident Fund contributions amount to, why should\r\n\r\nthese enlightened employers be penalised by having\r\n\r\nto  pay,  by  way of retirement benefits,  amounts\r\n\r\nadditional to what they already have been  paying?\r\n\r\nIt  is  one of the misfortunes or negative aspects\r\n\r\nof  Singapore's  labour/management relations  that\r\n\r\nthe  good  employer  who makes  profits  is  often\r\n\r\npenalised  by  having to pay better  than  average\r\n\r\nlevels  of  pay  and  fringe  benefits  than   the\r\n\r\ninefficient  employer who cannot make profits  and\r\n\r\ncan  only afford to pay low wages and provide poor\r\n\r\nworking   conditions   to   his   employees.    An\r\n\r\nenlightened policy on this matter would not punish\r\n\r\nthe  efficient  employer at  the  expense  of  the\r\n\r\ninefficient one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has made a number of\r\n\r\nuseful  observations  on  the  general  policy  of\r\n\r\nGovernment. I will go a long way with him on  most\r\n\r\nof what he said. But I will take issue with him on\r\n\r\nsome  of the points he raised. First, he asks why,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  giving free entry  to  all  kinds  of\r\n\r\nforeign investors, we should not hire experts from\r\n\r\nabroad and use our own money\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If necessary bring back our reserves from\r\n\r\noverseas  - and invest it in our enterprises  here\r\n\r\nand not allow foreigners to make these profits? Of\r\n\r\ncourse, in theory, this is all right. In practice,\r\n\r\nwhom do you hire and in what industry? How do  you\r\n\r\njudge  whether that is the right line of  industry\r\n\r\nto  put  your money in? Where you have  investors,\r\n\r\nwhether in Singapore or abroad, who are willing to\r\n\r\nput their money in whatever industry it is, either\r\n\r\nmaking\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmicrophones  or  fountain pens, these  are  people\r\n\r\nwith  experience in these lines. They  think  that\r\n\r\nthere  is an opportunity to make money. They  have\r\n\r\nthe expertise, the confidence, and they do it.  If\r\n\r\nwe do not have this expertise and we go into it  - we  can  hire  management all right; we  can  hire\r\n\r\nengineers - we may find that we have gone into the\r\n\r\nwrong  line.  We have put in a lot of  money.  The\r\n\r\nindustry goes bankrupt. Or we may be in the  right\r\n\r\nline and we may have hired the wrong people. It is\r\n\r\nnot  all  that easy to say that so and so, because\r\n\r\nof his paper qualifications or because of his experience, should be able to manage the enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the difference between the Gross\r\n\r\nDomestic  Product and the Gross National  Product,\r\n\r\nthere is something in what he says. But I think he\r\n\r\nhas  not  quite grasped this essential fact,  that\r\n\r\nour Gross National Product, far from being smaller\r\n\r\nthan  our  Gross Domestic Product,  is,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nlarger. This is rather technical and perhaps I can\r\n\r\nexplain   the  relationship  between   the   Gross\r\n\r\nDomestic Product and the Gross National Product in\r\n\r\nterms   which   a   layman  can  understand.   The\r\n\r\ndifference  is, in broad terms, made  up  by  what\r\n\r\nforeigners earn in Singapore by way of, profits on\r\n\r\ntheir investments, know-how fees, technical trade-mark  arrangements and so on - what they earn  and\r\n\r\ntake  out  and what Singaporeans earn by investing\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore. In the case of  Singapore,  we\r\n\r\nget more earnings from our investments abroad than\r\n\r\nthe  profits we pay to foreign investors.  We  are\r\n\r\nrather  unique  in  that respect among  developing\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards plans to offset the deflationary\r\n\r\nimpact  of reduced military expenditure, what  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Punggol says is quite true.  He  says\r\n\r\nthat  we should have plans in which money is spent\r\n\r\nmostly  on projects which do not require a lot  of\r\n\r\nimported  goods  so that most of the  money  would\r\n\r\nthen  generate income and employment. That is  the\r\n\r\ncorrect  strategy.  Secondly, he  thinks  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  raise taxes but instead  borrow  from\r\n\r\nabroad. I agree with this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  the  event  that we are faced  with  a  rather\r\n\r\nserious  deflationary impact this year, next  year\r\n\r\nor  the year after, the correct thing would be  to\r\n\r\nrun down our balances. In fact, I did hint at this\r\n\r\npossibility in my Budget speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta is not very happy about the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  socialist  content  of  our  policies.\r\n\r\nNeither is the Member for Ulu Pandan. Both of them\r\n\r\nthink that the common people should have a greater\r\n\r\nshare  in  this prosperity. Of course, one  cannot\r\n\r\nbut  agree with them that the common people should\r\n\r\nshare  in this prosperity and everybody should  be\r\n\r\nas  equal as possible. But, unfortunately, in this\r\n\r\nworld  things are not quite that way. People  have\r\n\r\nto  be  paid according to their worth. If you  are\r\n\r\nclever and hard-working and qualified in the right\r\n\r\nlines,  such  as  a  lawyer or  a  surgeon  or  an\r\n\r\nengineer, then, of course, you make more money. If\r\n\r\nall  you  can do is to hawk vegetables,  then  you\r\n\r\ncannot  expect to make as much money as a  surgeon\r\n\r\nor an engineer. I do not think we can improve the\r\n\r\nsituation by just taxing the rich to pay the poor.\r\n\r\nMany under-developed countries have done this sort\r\n\r\nof thing and they have found to their astonishment\r\n\r\nthat, far from making everybody richer, they  have\r\n\r\nmade  everybody poorer. And the country goes  into\r\n\r\nbankruptcy at an alarming rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest to the Members for Delta and Ulu Pandan\r\n\r\nthat   the   common  people  do  share   in   this\r\n\r\nprosperity. They share in having more than 100,000\r\n\r\nflats, whereas before they had none. They share in\r\n\r\nhaving  better  education for their children,  not\r\n\r\nonly  primary  education but  also  secondary  and\r\n\r\ntechnical  education. And one hopes  that  in  the\r\n\r\ncoming decade, education in our Universities  will\r\n\r\nbe  open  to  more and more people  who  otherwise\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  able to get there. Their  children\r\n\r\nwill have more jobs. More or less 30,000 jobs will\r\n\r\nbe  created and the benefits, of course, go to the\r\n\r\ncommon people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf  course,  the rich get richer.  I  will  not  pretend to deny that the rich do not get richer or\r\n\r\nat least some of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrich  do  not  get richer. This again  is  in  the\r\n\r\nnature of things. In the upswing of a boom, if you\r\n\r\nare in the right line, if you find oil or whatever\r\n\r\nit  is,  you  are prosperous. You make  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney.  Of  course, one hopes that  the  rich  pay\r\n\r\ntaxes. We strengthen the Inland Revenue Department\r\n\r\nwith   what   I   hope  will  be   an   effective\r\n\r\ninvestigation bureau so that if the  rich  do  not\r\n\r\npay  taxes, then they will suffer accordingly. But\r\n\r\nhere  we  are placed in a rather curious situation\r\n\r\nand Members must always remember this: that we are\r\n\r\nnot  a  closed economy. We are the fourth  largest\r\n\r\nport  in  the  world. Airlines come  in.  We  have\r\n\r\ntrading connections and banking services with  all\r\n\r\nparts  of  the  world.  Therefore,  this  has  two\r\n\r\nconsequences.  Firstly,  if  we  do  not  pay  our\r\n\r\nqualified  men  well, they will leave  and  go  to\r\n\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one of the tragedies of underdeveloped\r\n\r\ncountries  that they have been providing  some  of\r\n\r\nthe   best  brains  in  technology  to  the   rich\r\n\r\ncountries.  I was told by our Prime Minister,  who\r\n\r\nhas  done  some research in this matter, that  one\r\n\r\nunder-developed country alone- India - provides no\r\n\r\nless  than 50,000 Ph.D.s in science and technology\r\n\r\nto  the  western world. This is an enormous  brain\r\n\r\ndrain.  We cannot afford to do this. Being  a  big\r\n\r\ncontinent,   and   having  several   hundreds   of\r\n\r\nthousands  of Ph.D.s, a loss of 50,000 Ph.D.s  may\r\n\r\nnot be fatal to India, but we cannot afford such a\r\n\r\nbrain drain. The standards of pay which we have to\r\n\r\nprovide for our professionals, whether in business\r\n\r\nor  in  the civil service, are determined  by  the\r\n\r\ninternational rates which these people can command\r\n\r\nin  the world. So this means that you have got  to\r\n\r\npay  your  qualified men well. If you do  not  pay\r\n\r\nthem  well  in the civil service, they will  leave\r\n\r\nand   go   into  private  enterprise.  If  private\r\n\r\nenterprise is not prepared to pay them well,  they\r\n\r\nwill  go to other countries. If we want to improve\r\n\r\nour  industry  and  our  economy,  we  need  these\r\n\r\npeople.  We have to pay for them. That is  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  constraints under which we have to  work  and\r\n\r\nwhich  nullifies this egalitarian principle  which\r\n\r\nsocial democrats like to practise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect is just as bad. It is this. When\r\n\r\nyou   want  to  attract  industries,  particularly\r\n\r\nduring  the first stage of industrialisation,  you\r\n\r\nhave  to  get  people with the  know  how  or  the\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  or  the  technology   from   the\r\n\r\nadvanced countries - America, Japan, Europe and so\r\n\r\non  -  and these do not have to come to Singapore.\r\n\r\nThey compare Singapore with Hong Kong, Taiwan  and\r\n\r\nSouth Korea. These are our front-line competitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to clarify certain points. I\r\n\r\nfeel  that the Minister has been stressing on  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  providing sufficient  salaries  to\r\n\r\nattract  highly qualified personnel, but this  can\r\n\r\nbe easily resolved. If we provide in our laws that\r\n\r\nif  highly qualified personnel after having worked\r\n\r\nhere for some time should go abroad and work, then\r\n\r\ntheir  citizenship  will be withdrawn.  We  would,\r\n\r\ntherefore, not experience a brain drain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that if our workers cannot enjoy\r\n\r\nthe fruits of their efforts, then all I can say is\r\n\r\nthat the Government's promises are empty promises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if we have this kind of policy,\r\n\r\nthen  it is unlikely that we shall be able to send\r\n\r\nanybody  abroad, because once he goes  abroad,  he\r\n\r\nwill  never come back. These controls are counter-productive. They look quite simple at first sight,\r\n\r\nbut  they  have been tried by other countries  and\r\n\r\nthey just would not work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards paying our workers good rates of pay,\r\n\r\nmay I ask the Member for Delta to compare the wage\r\n\r\nrates  in  Singapore with those paid in developing\r\n\r\ncountries?  Unfortunately, I am not in a  position\r\n\r\nto  give chapter and verse because these countries\r\n\r\nare  often  very sensitive and they  do  not  like\r\n\r\ncomparisons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan has a lot of\r\n\r\nextraordinary  ideas whereby we can save  hundreds\r\n\r\nof millions of dollars in our defence expenditure.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that my colleague, the Minister for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefence, is not here. The Member says that  if  we\r\n\r\nwere to train school boys and also school girls in\r\n\r\nthe  gentle  art of war, then we do  not  have  to\r\n\r\nspend 31 per cent of our budget on defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  assure him that even if we do it, we will still\r\n\r\nhave to spend this amount of money. Modern war  is\r\n\r\nnot  fought with bows and arrows. Once you have  a\r\n\r\nmissile system, you just pay for it. A sum of  $35\r\n\r\nmillion cash down, and then $10 million each year.\r\n\r\nI  hope  the Member will go and see the  exercises\r\n\r\nwhich our infantry battalions put up from time  to\r\n\r\ntime for V.I.P.s like him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Let me explain what I have said. I would like to\r\n\r\ntell  the Minister that he has allotted a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney on defence. Whom are we going to fight  with\r\n\r\nmissiles?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I can assure the Member for Ulu Pandan that we do\r\n\r\nnot want to fight with anybody. That is why we are\r\n\r\npreparing for our defence. If we do not  have  any\r\n\r\ndefence,  then we can be sure that in no  time  at\r\n\r\nall  we  will be eaten up. As I said,  the  Member\r\n\r\nshould  see the defence exercises at the Singapore\r\n\r\nArmed  Forces  Training Institute. Every  time  he\r\n\r\nsees  a soldier putting down a mortar bomb - I  am\r\n\r\ntold  they let fly about ten mortar bombs a minute\r\n\r\n- he should remember that each bomb costs $60. And\r\n\r\nwe have several dozen of these soldiers letting go\r\n\r\nwith  their mortars. And this is the cheapest part\r\n\r\nof our defence expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan thinks that we should\r\n\r\nallow tenants of the Housing and Development Board\r\n\r\nsome  leeway in payment of rents. I am quite  sure\r\n\r\nthat  my  colleague,  the  Minister  for  Law  and\r\n\r\nNational  Development, is not a heartless  person,\r\n\r\nand if people really want an extension of time  to\r\n\r\npay  rents, I am sure they will be allowed  to  do\r\n\r\nso.  At the same time, if they cannot pay rent and\r\n\r\nit  is obvious that they are in no position to pay\r\n\r\nrent,  then  they have to leave. The  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Board   is   not   a   philanthropic\r\n\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been some rather interesting\r\n\r\nsuggestions  about improving the agricultural  and\r\n\r\nfishing  sectors. The Member for Havelock and  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson have put forward some ideas about\r\n\r\nthe  development of animal husbandry and  fishing.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Anson says that we should have co-operative  societies  for  pigs  and  poultry.  If\r\n\r\nsetting  up  these co-operatives  means  that  the\r\n\r\nfarmers  will be better off, then why is  it  that\r\n\r\nthe farmers have not organised them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> They have an association, Sir. I think the\r\n\r\nassociation  is  not working well. The  Government\r\n\r\nmust  take  the initiative to form a farmers'  co-operative  society. In this way, the  farmers  can\r\n\r\nsell  their  produce  to this society.  They  will\r\n\r\ntherefore   not  suffer  at  the  hands   of   the\r\n\r\nmiddlemen.  The  middleman will  always  sell  his\r\n\r\ngoods  at  higher  prices than those  of  the  co-operative  society because he is  out  to  make  a\r\n\r\nprofit.   That   is  why  the  Government   should\r\n\r\nencourage the formation of a farmers' co-operative\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member has greater confidence in the efficacy\r\n\r\nof  Government  servants than I have.  I  remember\r\n\r\nsome  years ago fishermen organised a co-operative\r\n\r\nsociety  and  they were doing quite  well  because\r\n\r\nthat  part of the fishing industry was monopolised\r\n\r\nby  some middlemen. However, a storm broke out one\r\n\r\nday  and their boats were swept away by the north-east  monsoon.  They  lost their  gear  and  their\r\n\r\nboats, and they had no money. So they went to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  -  this was before our time.  At  that\r\n\r\ntime  it was not the Finance Minister who  was  in\r\n\r\ncharge, but the Financial Secretary, and he  asked\r\n\r\nthis question: \"Is the storm an act of God? If  it\r\n\r\nis  an  act  of  God, then the Government  has  no\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to  reimburse  these   fishermen.\"\r\n\r\nEventually, it was decided that the storm  was  an\r\n\r\nact  of  God and therefore the Government  had  no\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to  pay  for  the  loss   of   the\r\n\r\nfishermen's  boats and gear. So the fishermen  had\r\n\r\nto go to their former dealers who used to advance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  money. But the dealers said. \"Look, you  are\r\n\r\nno  longer our customers. Why should we  lend  you\r\n\r\nany money?\" That was the sad end of the fishing co-operative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own belief is that so long as there is\r\n\r\ncompetition  among  middlemen, then  the  farmers,\r\n\r\nwhether they are selling pigs or poultry, will get\r\n\r\nthe  best  prices. But then Singapore  is  such  a\r\n\r\nsmall  place. Our communications are so  excellent\r\n\r\nthat   it   is  not  possible  for  middlemen   to\r\n\r\nmonopolise and have a grip on the farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the fishing industry, here again I\r\n\r\nreally  wonder  why,  if  this  is  such  a   good\r\n\r\nproposition,  it  has  not  flourished.  Obviously\r\n\r\nthere  must  be  some snag in  it,  otherwise  the\r\n\r\npeople will go and catch fish and make money.  Why\r\n\r\nhave  they  not  done so? I am not sure  what  the\r\n\r\nanswer is, but I am quite sure the solution is not\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government  to go into  something  which\r\n\r\nprivate enterprise is not willing to engage in.  I\r\n\r\nsuspect  what  will  happen  is  that,  if,   say,\r\n\r\nGovernment were to start a fishing fleet  as  they\r\n\r\nhave started the mercantile marine fleet, it would\r\n\r\nbe  very difficult to get our young men to go  out\r\n\r\nin  these  fishing boats because they  like  shore\r\n\r\njobs.  I remember talking to Dr Tham Ah Kow about\r\n\r\ngetting jobs for boys on fishing vessels. After  a\r\n\r\nlot of work, he managed to get some of our boys on\r\n\r\nthis  fishing  fleet. But after one journey,  they\r\n\r\nall  packed  up and said, \"We have had  enough  of\r\n\r\nit.\" So obviously this is not an industry on which\r\n\r\nwe should risk the taxpayer's money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong raised a point about health\r\n\r\nservices  for aided-school teachers. My colleague,\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Education, will look into what he\r\n\r\nhas said. I remember vaguely that this subject was\r\n\r\nraised some months ago, and we came to a decision;\r\n\r\nbut I cannot recollect what it was.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Member for Bras Basah made some\r\n\r\ninteresting  contribution to  the  debate.  He  is\r\n\r\nquite  correct,  of  course, in  saying  that  the\r\n\r\nincrease in pioneer industries in 1969 was due  to\r\n\r\nthe  growth of labour-intensive industries, A  lot\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  new electronic firms were established in  the\r\n\r\nlast one and a half years. This accounted for  the\r\n\r\nvery substantial increase in the number of workers\r\n\r\nin pioneer industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also right in saying that the growth of\r\n\r\ncargo has been greatest in the oil business.  This\r\n\r\nis  accounted  for by the rapid expansion  in  oil\r\n\r\nrefineries in the Republic, as oil seems to be and\r\n\r\nprobably is now the No. I entrepot trade product.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  also  agree  with him that health  services  in\r\n\r\nschools  should be improved. In fact, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Education, the Minister for Health, and I have\r\n\r\nagreed  that  we should provide more  doctors  and\r\n\r\nmore dentists for school children. Of course,  one\r\n\r\nhopes that this service will improve as time  goes\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also raised the point about 4,800\r\n\r\nskilled   and   semi-skilled   workers   in    the\r\n\r\nunemployment register of the Ministry of Labour. I\r\n\r\nsuspect that these 4,800 names are really bogus so\r\n\r\nfar  as  unemployment goes. They  are  either  not\r\n\r\nskilled, or they are not unemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Perhaps they are looking for better jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, they are probably looking for better jobs.

This is, of course,\r\n\r\nthe  problem  of  my colleague, the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour.  The  Minister  wants  more  staff,   more\r\n\r\nexpertise,  or  whatever it  is,  to  handle  this\r\n\r\nsubject.  This  problem is  of  great  concern  to\r\n\r\neverybody, because having trained workers at great\r\n\r\nexpense  and  then just to have them  put  out  of\r\n\r\naction  through accidents is, I think, a monstrous\r\n\r\nwaste of resources which we cannot afford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of\r\n\r\nthe  Government for the financial year 1st  April,\r\n\r\n1970 to 31st March, 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\nResolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" -[Dr Goh Keng Swee.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Twenty-one minutes past Six o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1970/19700318/19700318-HA-0290663.pdf\"\">Appendix to Mr. Speaker's announcement(Col. 602)(Cols 0663-0666)</a><br>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
