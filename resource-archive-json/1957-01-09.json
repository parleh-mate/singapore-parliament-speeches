It can  only\r\n\r\nbe  satisfactorily  answered if I  explain  briefly\r\n\r\nwhat  our  aim is and how far we have succeeded  in\r\n\r\nachieving  it.  The  first object  we  set  out  to\r\n\r\nachieve was to provide enough schools and to  train\r\n\r\nenough  teachers  to give every  child  a  six-year\r\n\r\nprimary education. As the primary age group is  now\r\n\r\nincreasing at the rate of some 20,000 a year,  this\r\n\r\nmeant  that 20,000 extra places a year  had  to  be\r\n\r\nprovided  even  to  maintain the existing  position\r\n\r\nwith  the  age  of admission to Government  schools\r\n\r\nseven  plus.  In fact, more than 20,000  additional\r\n\r\nplaces  are being provided each year, most of  them\r\n\r\nin  new  Government schools, so that  it  has  been\r\n\r\npossible to lower the age of admission to about six\r\n\r\nyears  eight  months. Parents of children  born  in\r\n\r\n1949,  that  is,  seven years old on  1st  January,\r\n\r\n1957, and 1950 six-year olds were asked to register\r\n\r\nin  August last year. Of 11,715 seven-year olds who\r\n\r\nwere  registered, every single one has been offered\r\n\r\na  place. Of 15,685 six-year olds, 6,610 have  been\r\n\r\noffered  places. The others will be given  priority\r\n\r\nof   admission,  according  to  age  and  place  of\r\n\r\nresidence,  to schools which will be  opened  later\r\n\r\nthis  year. Those who are not so admitted  will  be\r\n\r\nguaranteed places in 1958. The position  this  year\r\n\r\nhas  been complicated by late registrations and  by\r\n\r\nthe  need to use some of the new Government primary\r\n\r\nschool  buildings  to house Chinese  middle  school\r\n\r\npupils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) it is impossible to give a definite answer to\r\n\r\nthis  question. Obviously it is easier for children\r\n\r\nto  find  places in some localities  than  others.\r\n\r\nThere  are  too few schools in some of the  crowded\r\n\r\ncity areas and too few sites available for building\r\n\r\nnew ones. On the other hand, it is not possible  to\r\n\r\nbuild schools easily accessible to all children  in\r\n\r\nrural areas. In general, however, the large numbers\r\n\r\nof  children aged six and even five years  old  who\r\n\r\nare admitted to Chinese schools show that there  is\r\n\r\nno  real  shortage  of places. Fully-aided  schools\r\n\r\nwill, however, be required to follow the Government\r\n\r\npractice  of giving priority of admission to  older\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>KUOYU LANGUAGE FOR DRIVING TESTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following question for oral answer stood in the\r\n\r\nname of Mr Lee Choon Eng -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.

Some  of  these\r\n\r\nreports,  however,  were of a  speculative  nature.\r\n\r\nEvery time I was seen or interviewed by members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Press, I had a smile for them and I  had  been\r\n\r\nable  to  laugh  my  way through  many  an  awkward\r\n\r\nquestion.  This  might  have  accounted   for   the\r\n\r\noptimistic  tone  of the reports  which  have  been\r\n\r\ncoming  through  from London. I am not  striking  a\r\n\r\npessimistic note at all, but I do wish to strike  a\r\n\r\nnote  of  caution, that, unless all the ingredients\r\n\r\nare  there, the cake of Merdeka cannot be well  and\r\n\r\ntruly  baked.  I am, however, quite satisfied  with\r\n\r\nthe  trend  of the informal talks and can  honestly\r\n\r\nsay that the prospects are good and that success is\r\n\r\nwithin  reach; but we can only achieve this  if  we\r\n\r\nlay  our  plans  well and if we all make  strenuous\r\n\r\nefforts  to see to it that nothing happens  in  the\r\n\r\nmeantime  to jeopardise our chances. Let  us  march\r\n\r\ntowards  Merdeka in the full realisation that  this\r\n\r\nmeans  increasing  responsibilities  demanding  the\r\n\r\nbest that is in us in the fulfilment of the destiny\r\n\r\nof  our people towards a better and a fuller  life.\r\n\r\nThis is a national issue and in this national issue\r\n\r\nlet us not allow side issues to mar its success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Sir, let me turn to the agreed agenda\r\n\r\nwhich reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To take note of the items in the\r\n\r\nConstitutional Proposal by the United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nGovernment  as  set  out  in  Appendix  8   of\r\n\r\nCommand  Paper  9777  (Annexure  L. to   the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly Sessional Paper No.  Cmd.\r\n\r\n31  of  1956), which have already been  agreed\r\n\r\nto in principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Internal Security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. External Relations and External Defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Designation of Her Majesty's Representative\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Date of coming into force of the new\r\n\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Position of civilian employees in the Armed\r\n\r\nForces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Any other business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 1 means that what the Marshall delegation has\r\n\r\ngained during the last talks would remain, and this\r\n\r\nincludes  citizenship status for the many thousands\r\n\r\nof   non-locally-born  persons.  I  have  heard  it\r\n\r\nexpressed in some quarters that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  was  willing to accept less than what  has  been\r\n\r\noffered to the Marshall delegation, and I hope this\r\n\r\ninformation will put an end to their loose talk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 2, Sir, is an important one - a very important\r\n\r\none.  It  refers  to the extent to  which  the  new\r\n\r\nconstitution  would  permit  interference  in   our\r\n\r\ninternal   security  problem.  Hon.  Members   will\r\n\r\nrecollect that the Marshall delegation asked for  a\r\n\r\nMalayan  to  be  the Chairman of  the  Defence  and\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council proposed by the Colonial  Office,\r\n\r\nbut   this  was  turned  down.  Failure  to   reach\r\n\r\nagreement  on this question was the main  cause  of\r\n\r\nthe  breakdown of the last talks. Since I took over\r\n\r\noffice  as  Chief Minister last June, I  have  been\r\n\r\ngiving this matter considerable thought and I  have\r\n\r\nalso  had informal discussions with my friend Tunku\r\n\r\nAbdul Rahman. The proposal which I submitted to the\r\n\r\nColonial  Office under this heading  calls  for  an\r\n\r\nInternal  Security Council to be composed of  equal\r\n\r\nrepresentation by the Singapore Government and  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's  Government  and  a  Minister  from   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, under the chairmanship of the\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of Her Majesty's Government.  Under\r\n\r\nthe  proposed set-up, it will be seen that the vote\r\n\r\nof  the Federation member is the deciding factor in\r\n\r\nthe Internal Security Council. My proposal is based\r\n\r\non  the  fact  that the Federation is more  closely\r\n\r\nlinked with us vis-a-vis internal security than the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom. In this connection, the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore remember with gratitude the assistance of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation during our October riots. As to  be\r\n\r\nexpected,  Sir,  the  Colonial  Office   had   some\r\n\r\nmisgivings about this proposal. The opportunity was\r\n\r\ntaken  of  the  presence in London of  Tunku  Abdul\r\n\r\nRahman,  and there was a joint informal  discussion\r\n\r\nof the three parties - the Federation Chief Minister,\r\n\r\nthe  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Colonies,  and\r\n\r\nmyself.  I am again indebted to Tunku Abdul  Rahman\r\n\r\nfor his fine and continued co-operation as a result\r\n\r\nof  which  the  Colonial Office now considers  that\r\n\r\nthere is a basis for agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 3 on External Relations and External Defence\r\n\r\nis to be further discussed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the light of my proposal under item 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 4 refers to the designation of Her Majesty's\r\n\r\nrepresentative as apart from the representative  of\r\n\r\nHer  Majesty's  Government.  I  pressed  on  for  a\r\n\r\nMalayan Governor-General, and from the trend of the\r\n\r\ninformal   talks,  I  take  heart  that   the   new\r\n\r\nconstitution may yet see a Malayan as  the  Queen's\r\n\r\nrepresentative in a new State of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 5, Sir, refers to the date of coming into\r\n\r\nforce of the new constitution, and hon. Members are\r\n\r\nalready aware of the intention of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 6, Sir, brings in for discussion the position\r\n\r\nof  the many thousands of civilian employees in the\r\n\r\nArmed Services. This is a matter on which I will be\r\n\r\nholding   discussions   with   the   trade    union\r\n\r\norganisations that represent them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the question that crops up in\r\n\r\nthe  mind  of  everyone,  inside  and  outside  the\r\n\r\nAssembly,   is,  \"Will  the  delegation   for   the\r\n\r\nresumption  of  talks with the Colonial  Office  in\r\n\r\nMarch be an All-Party one or a Government one?\" The\r\n\r\nanswer to this question, Sir, is obvious. To ensure\r\n\r\nsuccess,  I must first of all ensure that there  is\r\n\r\nunity in the delegation. I mean to ensure that  the\r\n\r\nperformance of the last delegation is not repeated.\r\n\r\nI  want to bring a united force to London, a  force\r\n\r\nthat  can  be relied upon to bring the  cake  home.\r\n\r\nAnother failure will be too much for the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  bear. Another failure  will  mean  a\r\n\r\ngrave  blow  to the democratic forces in  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  will  make  the ground fertile for  subversive\r\n\r\nforces  to  operate. I propose to call as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible a conference of all Parties represented in\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly, after which I will be  in  a  better\r\n\r\nposition  to  make up my mind as to the composition\r\n\r\nof the delegation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during my meetings with the\r\n\r\nSecretary  of  State and with his officials,  there\r\n\r\nwas an air of cordiality and goodwill, and this has\r\n\r\nhelped  much  to bring about a better understanding\r\n\r\nof   the  position.  I  hope  the  same  spirit  of\r\n\r\ncordiality  and goodwill will prevail in  March.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like,  Sir,  to  take  this  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nexpress my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks to Her Majesty's Government for their\r\n\r\nhospitality during my stay in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir.

Members anything  more  than\r\n\r\nshort  notice of the contents of the Bill. I  hope,\r\n\r\nhowever, Sir, that the arrangements which have been\r\n\r\nmade  to give them as much notice as possible  have\r\n\r\nafforded them sufficient time in which to study the\r\n\r\nproposed legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is unusual in the sense that it\r\n\r\nrelates  particularly to the position on  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  the five Members of this Assembly  who\r\n\r\nare referred to in the Bill by name. It relates  to\r\n\r\nthose  Members  particularly, Sir,  because  within\r\n\r\nrecent  weeks  doubts about their qualification  to\r\n\r\nact  as  City Councillors have arisen. These doubts\r\n\r\nhave been considered and, as a result of the advice\r\n\r\nwhich   has   been  given  on  the  question,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment takes the view that it is most desirable\r\n\r\nthat  the  position of the hon. Members in question\r\n\r\non  the City Council should be put beyond doubt  at\r\n\r\nthe  earliest  opportunity.  This  Bill.  Sir,  has\r\n\r\naccordingly  been  introduced  to  put  the  matter\r\n\r\nbeyond doubt so far as the past is concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the doubts about the position on the City\r\n\r\nCouncil  of the hon. Members in question arise  out\r\n\r\nof  that provision of the Municipal Ordinance which\r\n\r\nprovides  that the seat of a City Councillor  shall\r\n\r\nbecome  vacant if he becomes a holder of an  office\r\n\r\nof emolument under the Crown. Hon. Members will,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  be aware that three of the five Members  in\r\n\r\nquestion   have  been  appointed  to  be  Assistant\r\n\r\nMinisters while on the City Council and there seems\r\n\r\nto be little doubt that when they were so appointed\r\n\r\nthey  became holders of offices of emolument  under\r\n\r\nthe   Crown.  So  far  as  the  remaining  two  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,   Sir,  it  is  considered  that   their\r\n\r\nposition on the City Council is doubtful.  In  this\r\n\r\nconnection,  Sir, the provisions of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nColony  Order in Council are relevant because  they\r\n\r\nexpressly  provide that, for the purposes  of  that\r\n\r\nOrder - I would emphasise those words \"for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurposes  of that Order\" - a person is not considered\r\n\r\nto  hold  office of emolument under  the  Crown  by\r\n\r\nreason  only that he is in receipt of a  salary  or\r\n\r\nother  emoluments in respect of his tenure, amongst\r\n\r\nothers,  of the office of Member of the Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly. The resulting implication, of course,  is\r\n\r\nthat  for other purposes \"Member of the Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly\"  may come within the category of  persons\r\n\r\nwho hold office of emolument under the Crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must now, I think, refer briefly to the\r\n\r\nconsequences  which follow, or  which  may  follow,\r\n\r\nwhere  a  person  has acted as  a  City  Councillor\r\n\r\nwhilst   disqualified,   because   it   is    those\r\n\r\nconsequences which make this Bill in  the  view  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government necessary. These consequences, Sir,\r\n\r\nare  two-fold. The first consequence, Sir, is  that\r\n\r\nproceedings may be instituted against such a person\r\n\r\nin  the  High  Court, and if they are  successfully\r\n\r\ninstituted,  the  Court has  power,  amongst  other\r\n\r\nthings, to order him to pay a penalty of up to $500\r\n\r\na day in respect of each occasion on which he acted\r\n\r\nwhilst  disqualified. The second consequence,  Sir,\r\n\r\nis  that  the  proceedings of the City  Council  in\r\n\r\nwhich a disqualified representative has taken  part\r\n\r\nmay  be  open to challenge. Accordingly,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\npurpose of this Bill, and I think it is clear  from\r\n\r\nits   title,  is  to  remove  the  possibility   of\r\n\r\nproceedings of the kind which I have just described\r\n\r\nbeing  taken in the High Court, and also to  remove\r\n\r\nthe  possibility of the validity of the proceedings\r\n\r\nof  the City Council on which the hon. Members have\r\n\r\ntaken part being challenged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, that before concluding I should also\r\n\r\nrefer  to  the provisions of clause 4 of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  it  has  been thought wise to include.  This\r\n\r\nclause,  Sir, completes the matter by covering  the\r\n\r\nposition  of  City  Councillors who  are  Municipal\r\n\r\nCommissioners  and  who were also  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nformer Legislative Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Sir, that Members on the opposite side of\r\n\r\nthe   House  will  agree  with  the  view  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment that, in the circumstances which I  have\r\n\r\noutlined, it is very desirable that the position so\r\n\r\nfar as the past is concerned should be put\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeyond doubt, and accordingly give their support to\r\n\r\nthis motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the future is concerned, the\r\n\r\nGovernment's proposals are contained  in  the  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  comes next in the Order Paper, and it is,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  unnecessary for me to say anything more  on\r\n\r\nthat aspect of the matter at this stage. Sir, I beg\r\n\r\nto move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.48 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  have  now  got used to Government giving  short\r\n\r\nnotice  for  important motions or  Bills.  We  have\r\n\r\nalready  passed  that stage, and whether  the  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  is now before the House was given to us  two\r\n\r\nweeks  ago or even two days ago or even right  now,\r\n\r\nSir,  it makes no difference. We are now quite used\r\n\r\nto   the   Government  tactic.  When  the   present\r\n\r\nGovernment took over office sometime in 1955, there\r\n\r\nwas  talk  of  a City Council re-election.  It  was\r\n\r\nstressed  that that institution should  be  changed\r\n\r\nand  they wanted to change it very quickly. We were\r\n\r\nfoolish enough to rise to that bait, thinking  that\r\n\r\nthat  would  be so, but after a long  time  we  are\r\n\r\nstill waiting for the Government to take action  to\r\n\r\nhold early election to the City Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were also then informed that the life of the\r\n\r\nCity  Council  would be short, and  that  therefore\r\n\r\nthere   was   no  necessity  of  asking   Assistant\r\n\r\nMinisters then to resign from the City Council.  We\r\n\r\nwere  informed  that the life of the  City  Council\r\n\r\nwould  only last for a few months. It is not a  few\r\n\r\nmonths;  it is now two years! We are still  waiting\r\n\r\nfor the elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any democratic country I think all laws must\r\n\r\noperate   equally  for  individuals  as   well   as\r\n\r\ninstitutions. We must be fair to everybody. Here is\r\n\r\na  case where somebody has blundered, somebody  has\r\n\r\nshown grave inefficiency. We may say that they have\r\n\r\noverlooked  this, but this is a very important  and\r\n\r\nserious  matter. We make the laws here, and  we  go\r\n\r\nagainst   them.   I  think  the  Attorney-General's\r\n\r\nDepartment is responsible for this, and perhaps the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Local Government, Lands and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHousing too. If an individual should go against the\r\n\r\nlaw, I do not think the Court will say, \"Well,  you\r\n\r\nhave  overlooked that, but we will let you off very\r\n\r\nlightly.\" I do not think if an individual who  made\r\n\r\nsuch  an  error, and came to this Assembly  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  he  overlooked  it, the Assembly  would  say,\r\n\r\n\"Well, you will be excused.\" No, Sir, it must  say,\r\n\r\n\"The  law  must  work  impartially.  You  must   be\r\n\r\npunished for your mistake, whether you have made it\r\n\r\nknowingly or unknowingly.\" But, of course,  we  are\r\n\r\nnow talking about a set of people whom we would say\r\n\r\nare privileged. They sit in this Assembly. They are\r\n\r\nthe  members of the ruling Party, and this Assembly\r\n\r\nis  therefore asked to pass legislation in order to\r\n\r\nprotect them! I think anybody who is sick must take\r\n\r\nhis  medicine, if he wants to get well. If  anybody\r\n\r\nmakes  a mistake knowingly or unknowingly, he  must\r\n\r\npay the penalty. If it is $500 a day, let it be so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are other aspects to consider. In\r\n\r\nall  probability they have taken part in  making  a\r\n\r\nlot of decisions, and if they are punished now, the\r\n\r\nwhole   machinery  of  local  government  will   be\r\n\r\njeopardised,  all because of Government's  mistake,\r\n\r\nand the people will suffer. But there is one decent\r\n\r\nthing  that the Assistant Ministers could  do,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  to  resign  straightaway  from  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil and stop making further mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have pointed out to Government that a person\r\n\r\ncannot be expected to do two jobs at the same  time\r\n\r\nand do them well. The Assistant Ministers are being\r\n\r\npaid  handsomely for doing the job of an  Assistant\r\n\r\nMinister in addition to being a City Councillor. So\r\n\r\none job must suffer. We have informed them that  if\r\n\r\nthey are of the opinion that their work in the City\r\n\r\nCouncil is not all-absorbing, then that institution\r\n\r\nbecomes  an  unimportant one. If they  think  that,\r\n\r\nbeing Assistant Ministers, they need not devote all\r\n\r\ntheir  time  to that office, then they are  wasting\r\n\r\npublic  money  because they are being overpaid  for\r\n\r\ntheir jobs. In fact, Sir, I consider this to  be  a\r\n\r\nvery  bad blunder on the part of the Government  to\r\n\r\nmake such an error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.55 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, every now and\r\n\r\nthen,  since this Government took office, a  sordid\r\n\r\nscandal  comes  to light, and of all the  scandals,\r\n\r\nthis  is  the most sordid of them all!  It  is  one\r\n\r\nbrought to light in circumstances of which I  think\r\n\r\nthe Member for Serangoon may not be fully aware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember reading in the papers - and I think no\r\n\r\none  has  contradicted  the  reports  yet-that  the\r\n\r\nPresident of the City Council, Mr Rea, stated that\r\n\r\nif  these  men  whose  acts we  are  now  asked  to\r\n\r\nvalidate  had not wanted to question the  propriety\r\n\r\nof  the City Council giving a cinema licence to one\r\n\r\nMr Loke Wan Tho, a spirited gentleman whom we will\r\n\r\nall  remember as the television applicant, then  he\r\n\r\nwould not have questioned their right to sit in the\r\n\r\nCity  Council. But since these unwise men, who have\r\n\r\ntheir hands in two pockets - one in the City Council,\r\n\r\nand the other in the Assembly (I am told it is $200\r\n\r\nand  $500  respectively) - did  question  the  cinema\r\n\r\nlicence he would question their right to be  there.\r\n\r\nSo  we  have the unholy spectacle of the  Attorney-General coming before this Assembly to put the  law\r\n\r\nright for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there is one humorous note in this Bill,\r\n\r\nit  is  this attempt to blur the lines between  the\r\n\r\nAssistant  Ministers  and the ordinary  Members  of\r\n\r\nthis   Assembly.  In  his  explanatory  note,   the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General said it would appear that a person\r\n\r\nwho  is an Assistant Minister is the holder  of  an\r\n\r\noffice  of emolument under the Crown. I am sure  he\r\n\r\nhas sound legal authority for that. But he goes  on\r\n\r\nto  say  that  a  person who is  a  Member  of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly may also be the holder of such\r\n\r\nan  office.  What office? Presumably an  office  of\r\n\r\nemolument  under the Crown. I would be grateful  if\r\n\r\nwe  could know his authority for that statement.  I\r\n\r\nhave  never considered myself as the holder  of  an\r\n\r\noffice  of emolument under the Crown. I have  never\r\n\r\nthought that I am in the same category as the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Minister and his colleagues,  including\r\n\r\nthe  permanent civil servants who sit with us.  But\r\n\r\nnow we are told that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  melodious  names as Anthony Rebairo  Lazarous\r\n\r\nand  Lee  Choon  Eng  are in the  same  category  as\r\n\r\nJumabhoy Mohamed Jumabhoy and Mak Pak Shee!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not want to go into the niceties of all\r\n\r\nthis.  This  Bill will go through, if  for  nothing\r\n\r\nelse  because,  as  the Member  for  Serangoon  has\r\n\r\npointed out, if they had to pay the penalty of $500\r\n\r\na   day  or  thereabouts,  they  would  all  become\r\n\r\nbankrupt and would be disqualified from sitting  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly--  except perhaps the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommerce and Industry who sports a Humber Hawk! But\r\n\r\nlet them take note of this: the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nare  not  so politically illiterate as not to  know\r\n\r\nwhen a person is holding office and profiting. They\r\n\r\nare  not so stupid as not to be able to distinguish\r\n\r\nbetween  those  who have assumed public  office  to\r\n\r\nserve the people, and those who have assumed public\r\n\r\noffice  to  serve themselves while they  serve  the\r\n\r\npeople.  We  will  say no more at this  stage.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment can do what it likes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are against this Bill on principle. On\r\n\r\nprinciple  we say it is a scandal that an Assistant\r\n\r\nMinister of a Government should sit on all kinds of\r\n\r\npetty tribunals-on City Council committees that are\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  giving  bus  routes  and  hawking\r\n\r\nlicences  and  all  the other  machinery  of  local\r\n\r\ngovernment  which,  so I am  told,  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore    constantly   find   frustrating    and\r\n\r\noppressive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if\r\n\r\nwe  pass  this Bill today I will be led to  believe\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese idioms that \"money can move mountains\"\r\n\r\nand  also that \"money can engage the devil to  work\r\n\r\nfor you\".

I wish the Government  would\r\n\r\nshow  more faith in the intelligence of the  people\r\n\r\nand withdraw this most deplorable Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.03 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker.

I am afraid of incurring your  wrath  in\r\n\r\nusing the right word for it, Sir, but perhaps it is\r\n\r\ndue  to  his  proximity to the Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  who, incidentally, called him \"my colleague\"\r\n\r\njust now. That was a surprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The delay in elections to the City Council, Sir,\r\n\r\nis  not  the  fault of this Government.  The  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment  Bill  is  a  very  important  piece  of\r\n\r\nlegislation and requires careful consideration.  We\r\n\r\ndo  not  want to put up a Bill in a haphazard  form\r\n\r\nwhich  might require a lot of amendments and  might\r\n\r\nbe  found to be unworkable later on.

It  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  admitted, Sir, that the five Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  who are also City Councillors  have\r\n\r\nindeed  committed a penal offence.  It  is  only  a\r\n\r\ndoubt that has been raised and this Bill intends to\r\n\r\nsettle the matter beyond doubt, so that the work of\r\n\r\nthe City Council may be carried on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as has been stated by the Member for Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru and by other Members of the Opposition,  this\r\n\r\nmatter first came to light at a meeting of the City\r\n\r\nCouncil  on the 21st December when a motion  before\r\n\r\nit  had to be withdrawn because the position of the\r\n\r\nCouncillor moving that motion was, according to the\r\n\r\nPresident of the City Council, in doubt. Therefore,\r\n\r\nif  this Bill is not proceeded with throughout  all\r\n\r\nits  stages  today, it would mean that  that  doubt\r\n\r\nwould  still remain and the City Council would  not\r\n\r\nbe able to carry on its work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do sport a Humber Hawk but it looks a\r\n\r\nmiserable creature beside the Studebaker  owned  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tanjong Pagar! In fact,  only  this\r\n\r\nmorning  I had occasion to mention to him that  he\r\n\r\nowns a capitalist car and he said, \"Why not?\"!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.11 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the  Member for  Serangoon  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech made some remarks about the delay in holding\r\n\r\nelections to the City Council and he said that this\r\n\r\nwas  inefficiency and that it was due either to the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's Department or  my  Ministry.  If\r\n\r\nthe   Member  for  Serangoon  will  recollect   the\r\n\r\nGovernor's  Address delivered at the first  sitting\r\n\r\nof  the  previous session of this Assembly, it  was\r\n\r\nstated  therein that the then Government was  going\r\n\r\nto  introduce  legislation immediately  to  have  a\r\n\r\nfully  elected Island and City Council. Only  after\r\n\r\ntaking office, Sir, did we have the opportunity  of\r\n\r\ngoing through a ready-made Bill for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelections to the City Council prepared by the  then\r\n\r\nProgressive Party and only then did we realise that\r\n\r\nit  was impossible to carry out the recommendations\r\n\r\nof  the Rendel Constitution which were embodied  in\r\n\r\nthat Bill. We therefore thought it wiser to appoint\r\n\r\na  Committee on Local Government and to  await  its\r\n\r\nReport.  When  the Report came out,  we  eventually\r\n\r\ndecided  to  adopt  the  recommendations   of   the\r\n\r\nCommittee on Local Government. So, soon after that,\r\n\r\nwe  drew up legislation and, as you are well aware,\r\n\r\nSir,  this  legislation  is  now  before  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee of the Assembly. Therefore, Sir, I  think\r\n\r\nit  is  unwise  on  the  part  of  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  to  accuse either the Attorney-General's\r\n\r\nDepartment  or my Ministry of any delay in  holding\r\n\r\nelections to the City Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> A rash promise!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Quite so, Sir, it was somewhat\r\n\r\nrash  but then one must also remember that in April\r\n\r\n1955  we  all  were very young in  politics  and  I\r\n\r\nshould  say  the Members on the Opposition  Benches\r\n\r\nwere also in the same category.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other point which was raised by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Serangoon - that it is impossible for a  man  to\r\n\r\nserve  two  masters: in the ease  of  an  Assistant\r\n\r\nMinister, he has to serve not only his Ministry but\r\n\r\nalso the City Council. Sir, the same situation also\r\n\r\narises in the case of the Member for Serangoon. Not\r\n\r\nonly is he an Assemblyman, but he is also a school-teacher, and I wonder who suffer most, the  school-boys or this Assembly!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.14 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir, the\r\n\r\nconduct  of  the President of the City Council  has\r\n\r\nbeen called in question. I should like to endeavour\r\n\r\nto  explain as well as I can his position  in  this\r\n\r\nmatter. I understand it was this. Sir, the validity\r\n\r\nof   the  seats  in  the  City  Council  of   those\r\n\r\nCouncillors  who are either Assistant Ministers  or\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this  Assembly had been  brought  into\r\n\r\nquestion.  The  question  had  not  been  resolved.\r\n\r\nBefore  the  last  ordinary  meeting  of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil, notices had been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven  of,  I think it was, two motions which  were\r\n\r\nsponsored   by   members  whose   eligibility   for\r\n\r\nmembership was in doubt. The President had  reasons\r\n\r\nto  believe  that if those motions were  moved,  he\r\n\r\nwould  be  asked, as President of the City Council,\r\n\r\nto  give a ruling whether the motions were in order\r\n\r\nbecause they had been moved by persons who were not\r\n\r\nentitled to be Members of the City Council.  Having\r\n\r\nobtained such legal advice as he could, he was then\r\n\r\nin a position of having, in conscience, to reply to\r\n\r\nthat  question,  that the advice he  had  was  that\r\n\r\nthose   Members  were  not  properly  Members   and\r\n\r\ntherefore the motions were out of order. Now, if he\r\n\r\nhad  to  do that, it would immediately have brought\r\n\r\ninto  doubt the rest of the proceedings of the City\r\n\r\nCouncil  in  which  these Councillors  were  taking\r\n\r\npart.  He knew that the Government and the Minister\r\n\r\nwere achieving a solution of this doubt and that if\r\n\r\nlegislation  was  required,  it  would  be  brought\r\n\r\nforward, as it has been today. In order, therefore,\r\n\r\nnot  to frustrate the business of the City Council,\r\n\r\nhe  took,  the course of suggesting that these  two\r\n\r\nmotions  which  would  raise the  doubt  should  be\r\n\r\npostponed until a later meeting of the Council when\r\n\r\nthe doubt would not arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.

I do  agree\r\n\r\nthat  the President had been in doubt, and  if  so,\r\n\r\nall  decisions made by me in the Council would  not\r\n\r\nhave  been valid.

I  would,\r\n\r\nhowever, like to add this, Mr Speaker, Sir, in  reply  to  the Member for Serangoon. I think  on  two\r\n\r\noccasions  certainly  it was  suggested  that  this\r\n\r\nlegislation  was  designed to  prevent  proceedings\r\n\r\nbeing  taken  against  persons  because  they   had\r\n\r\ncommitted some sort of crime. I would like to  make\r\n\r\nit  clear now that there is no question of that  at\r\n\r\nall.  The provisions of section 8A of the Municipal\r\n\r\nOrdinance merely provide, in circumstances where it\r\n\r\nis  thought  that a person sat as a City Councillor\r\n\r\nwhilst he was disqualified, for proceedings in  the\r\n\r\nHigh  Court for a declaration, that his  office  is\r\n\r\nvacant, and empowers the High Court to require  him\r\n\r\nto  pay a forfeiture on account of his conduct.  So\r\n\r\nthere  is no question now of saying, by this  Bill,\r\n\r\nthat  what was a crime shall not be regarded  as  a\r\n\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar stressed, I think,\r\n\r\none   particular  point.  He  said  that   in   the\r\n\r\nexplanatory note the lines between the position  of\r\n\r\nan   Assistant  Minister  and  a  Member   of   the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly have become blurred.  I  think\r\n\r\nhe  is  probably right when he says that so far  as\r\n\r\nthe  explanatory note is concerned, but I  think  I\r\n\r\ndid  make  it  clear when I was moving  the  Second\r\n\r\nReading - and  I think at that stage the hon.  Member\r\n\r\nwas not present - that there was a distinction so far\r\n\r\nas we are concerned on this side of the House, that\r\n\r\nwhereas the position of an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssistant  Minister appears to be  clear,  that  of\r\n\r\nMembers of the Assembly appears to be doubtful, and\r\n\r\nI  gave  the  reasons when I was moving the  Second\r\n\r\nReading. I am sorry if the hon. Member was not here\r\n\r\nat the time. I did try to explain the matter and  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  would be tiresome to the House  if  they\r\n\r\nwere to listen to me doing it again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to follow at all the remarks made\r\n\r\nby the Member for Queenstown, but I think the Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary did cover the ground on those points  and\r\n\r\nI accordingly beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div align=\"center\"><b>Committee</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Members will have appreciated\r\n\r\nfrom  the  debate on the Bill which has  just  been\r\n\r\npassed by this Assembly that the future position on\r\n\r\nthe City Council of persons who are Members of this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  whether they be Assistant  Ministers  or\r\n\r\nnot,  will  be  uncertain unless some amendment  is\r\n\r\nmade   to  the  Municipal  Ordinance  which   makes\r\n\r\nprovision   for   the   qualifications   of    City\r\n\r\nCouncillors.   This  Bill,  Sir,   is   accordingly\r\n\r\ndesigned to remove that uncertainty and it does  so\r\n\r\nby amendments to the law which, in the first place,\r\n\r\nprovide in effect that a person holding the  office\r\n\r\nof  Assistant  Minister or Member of  the  Assembly\r\n\r\nshall   not   be  disqualified  from  election   or\r\n\r\nappointment  as  a  City Councillor;  and,  in  the\r\n\r\nsecond  place,  that the seat of a City  Councillor\r\n\r\nwill not become vacant in the event of his becoming\r\n\r\nan Assistant Minister or Member of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a further amendment, Sir, proposed by\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  to  which I think I  should  refer.  It\r\n\r\nshould be made abundantly clear that the provisions\r\n\r\nof  the  Municipal Ordinance under which the holder\r\n\r\nof  an  office  of  emolument under  the  Crown  is\r\n\r\ndisqualified  from  acting  as  a  City  Councillor\r\n\r\nrelate only to cases where the office is under  the\r\n\r\nCrown  in the Colony and not where it is an  office\r\n\r\nunder the Crown in respect of the Government of the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, since under the Municipal Ordinance\r\n\r\npersons  are  disqualified  from  acting  as   City\r\n\r\nCouncillors  if  they hold an office  of  emolument\r\n\r\nunder the City Council, it has been thought prudent\r\n\r\nto  include  a  provision  on  the  lines  of  that\r\n\r\nproposed  by clause 4 which, in effect,  says  that\r\n\r\nthe  receipt of an allowance from acting as a  City\r\n\r\nCouncillor is not a disqualification. I think, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  hon.  Members will already  have  received  a\r\n\r\nnotice  of an amendment which I propose to move  to\r\n\r\nthat   clause  at  the  Committee  stage  and  that\r\n\r\namendment, Sir, is designed to substitute  for  the\r\n\r\nproposed  new  section 8B one  which  is  more  comprehensive in its effect. I think, Sir, I shall not\r\n\r\nsay  anything  more on that now, and I  accordingly\r\n\r\nbeg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.30 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had hoped\r\n\r\nthat   the  mover  of  this  Bill  would  give   an\r\n\r\nindication  whether  or not the Assistant  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour and Welfare would resign from the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil,  but  by his not making any  statement,  I\r\n\r\npresume the intention is that he will stay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think this amendment should be treated\r\n\r\nunder   two   parts - one,  the  position   of   City\r\n\r\nCouncillors,  and  the  second,  the  position   of\r\n\r\nAssistant Ministers. Where the City Councillors are\r\n\r\nconcerned, they only draw an allowance  of  $200  a\r\n\r\nmonth. This allowance is meant to compensate a City\r\n\r\nCouncillor  for  his  transport  and  the  clerical\r\n\r\nservices  which  he would have to  employ  for  the\r\n\r\nperformance  of  his duties on  the  City  Council.\r\n\r\nWhere  the Assistant Minister is concerned,  it  is\r\n\r\nentirely a different proposition. One can say  that\r\n\r\nan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallowance  is  not  an emolument under  the  Crown,\r\n\r\nbecause  all of us in this Assembly draw allowances\r\n\r\nand  I  should hate o be treated also as  a  person\r\n\r\nholding  an  office of emolument under  the  Crown,\r\n\r\nthereby  having  to assume the mantle  of  Caesar's\r\n\r\nwife.  There may be arguments whether an  allowance\r\n\r\nis  or  is  not an emolument under the  Crown,  but\r\n\r\nthere is no shadow of doubt that where a person  is\r\n\r\nan  Assistant Minister and is drawing  a  very  fat\r\n\r\nsalary from the Government, he must be regarded  as\r\n\r\nbeing  in  the service of the Crown. I  cannot  see\r\n\r\nlegally  how  he  can  avoid being  treated  as  an\r\n\r\nofficer under the Crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another objection to the Assistant\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour and Welfare being on the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil. Not only is he fully paid for his job, but\r\n\r\nat the present moment he is doing\r\n\r\npractically all the work of the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nand   Welfare,  because  we  know  that  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  is holding two jobs - his own job as  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  and his other job as Minister for  Labour\r\n\r\nand Welfare. Since the Chief Minister's time is  so\r\n\r\nmuch  taken  up  with  the work  of  the  Assembly,\r\n\r\nguiding the Government and in negotiations with the\r\n\r\nColonial  Office for merdeka, how can the Assistant\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Welfare justify taking away\r\n\r\nhis  time  from  doing the work  not  only  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour and Welfare but also  his  own\r\n\r\nwork as Assistant Minister? If he can do both jobs,\r\n\r\nit  means that the office of Assistant Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour and Welfare is not necessary. If he wants to\r\n\r\ndraw the pay of an Assistant Minister, then we feel\r\n\r\nthat  he  must  resign from his seat  on  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil. Therefore, Sir, we object to this Bill  on\r\n\r\nthe  ground  that an Assistant Minister should  not\r\n\r\nsit on the City Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.35 a.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the debate\r\n\r\nthis  morning  seems to have cast  a  doubt  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether  a  Member of the Legislative  Assembly  is\r\n\r\nalso   a  Government  servant.  In  fact,  I  think\r\n\r\nGovernment has never regarded it in that light.  In\r\n\r\nso   far  as  amenities  are  concerned,  I   think\r\n\r\nAssemblymen are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntreated  as  private citizens. There are  no  such\r\n\r\nthings as a pension, free medical service and  all\r\n\r\nthe  other  privileges  that  come  from  being  a\r\n\r\ngovernment servant. Furthermore we have been  told\r\n\r\nthat  the $500 which an Assemblyman gets is not  a\r\n\r\nsalary but just an allowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am connected with many sports organisations and\r\n\r\nthese  pay a transport allowance to their coaches,\r\n\r\nbut the coaches are not treated as people in their\r\n\r\nemploy and paid salaries. They still retain  their\r\n\r\namateur status. I would really hate to be regarded\r\n\r\nas  a  government servant and subject to the wrong\r\n\r\nside of General Orders and not benefiting from the\r\n\r\nfact  of  being  a  government servant.  There  is\r\n\r\nabsolutely  no  doubt, Sir, that Members  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly, if they are not receiving salaries, such\r\n\r\nas Assistant Ministers or Ministers, should not be\r\n\r\nregarded as government servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the Assistant Minister being\r\n\r\nprovided  for in this Bill and being  exempted,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it is very unfair to create this situation,\r\n\r\nthen rectify it and then make sure that the Labour\r\n\r\nFront has an extra vote in the City Council. I put\r\n\r\nit  to  you, Sir, that they have power to  appoint\r\n\r\nanybody they like in the City Council, and even if\r\n\r\nthis  Labour  Fronter  chose  to  leave  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  and thereby vacate his seat,  they  could\r\n\r\nstill  appoint another Labour Fronter to take  his\r\n\r\nplace.  They  have done it before.  There  is  one\r\n\r\nnominated City Councillor by the name of Miss  Wee\r\n\r\nKiat  Neo.  I  think she is the Assistant  General\r\n\r\nSecretary of the Labour Front. .1 think this is  a\r\n\r\ndirect  appointment of a Party  member  and  is  a\r\n\r\nParty bias -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

In reply, Sir, I think\r\n\r\nI  shall be very brief and I shall deal only  with\r\n\r\ntwo  points which have been raised. The  first,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  was  made  by the Member  for  Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nwhen - I  think  I am right in saying - he  said  that\r\n\r\nthere could be no doubt that an Assistant Minister\r\n\r\nis  the holder of an office of emolument under the\r\n\r\nCrown  and is therefore disqualified. All I  would\r\n\r\nsay  in  answer to that is, because that point  is\r\n\r\nappreciated, that the amendments to the  Municipal\r\n\r\nOrdinance are now proposed by this Bill  in  order\r\n\r\nto provide that he will not be disqualified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the observations made by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Serangoon, I did try to explain in moving the\r\n\r\nBill  which  preceded this one in the Order  Paper\r\n\r\nthat  so  far  as the position of Members  of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly is concerned, the point is  a\r\n\r\ntechnical  one. I have referred to the  provisions\r\n\r\nin  the  Colony Order in Council and I have stated\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  doubtful, and it is because  of  the\r\n\r\ndoubts   which   some   of  us   responsible   for\r\n\r\nconsidering  questions of this kind  entertain  on\r\n\r\nthe  matter  that  the  provisions  of  this  Bill\r\n\r\nprovide, in effect, that there shall no longer  be\r\n\r\nany doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> On a point of information, Sir.\r\n\r\nI  take  it that, from this remark, the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General agrees with me that the Assistant\r\n\r\nMinister is disqualified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> What I have said is that, because\r\n\r\nof  the view which I have expressed in moving  the\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading  of the other Bill that  Assistant\r\n\r\nMinisters are disqualified under the existing law,\r\n\r\nlegislation has now been introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

I promised\r\n\r\nthen  that I will bring up as soon as possible  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  legislation to this House to set  up  an\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Promotion Board. The need to  establish\r\n\r\nsuch  a  Board  was felt by the International  Bank\r\n\r\nMission and formed one of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  recommendations  in  their  Report  on   the\r\n\r\neconomic development of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we want to encourage new capital to come in\r\n\r\nand  set up new industries, we must not forget that\r\n\r\nwe  can  accelerate in this sphere of expansion  if\r\n\r\nexisting  industries could be helped to expand  and\r\n\r\nif  existing  small factories could be assisted  in\r\n\r\nmodernising,  so  that  they can  manufacture  more\r\n\r\ncompetitively,  thereby,  enabling  them  to  widen\r\n\r\ntheir  market  and consequently to  increase  their\r\n\r\nproduction.  In  fact,  if  we  can  produce   more\r\n\r\ncompetitively,  we may be able to  overcome,  to  a\r\n\r\ncertain    extent,   the   tariff   obstacles    in\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries. In Singapore, Sir, we  have\r\n\r\nmany  small  factories and some of these  factories\r\n\r\ncould  so  expand if they had the necessary  funds.\r\n\r\nThis Board will become the instrument through which\r\n\r\nGovernment  could  give  the  necessary   financial\r\n\r\nassistance to such deserving enterprises.  It  does\r\n\r\nnot  follow,  however,  that  the  Board  will   be\r\n\r\nrestricted  to  assist  only industries  which  are\r\n\r\nexisting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would invite the attention of hon. Members to\r\n\r\nclause  4 of the Bill which gives the Board  powers\r\n\r\nto  promote and manage new undertakings in case  of\r\n\r\nneed.  It  is proposed, Sir, that the Board  should\r\n\r\nstart off with a revolving fund of $1 million.  All\r\n\r\napplications  for loans will be considered  by  the\r\n\r\nBoard on their merits and the Board will decide  on\r\n\r\nthe terms and conditions attached to every loan  it\r\n\r\nadvances.  The Board will be a body corporate  with\r\n\r\nperpetual   succession  and  a  common  seal.   Its\r\n\r\nmembership    will   comprise   a    Chairman,    a\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of  the  Financial   Secretary,   a\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of  my  Ministry  and   two   other\r\n\r\nMembers, all of whom will be appointed by  me  with\r\n\r\nthe  prior approval of the Governor in Council. The\r\n\r\nChairman and the two Members already mentioned will\r\n\r\nbe   appointed   from  persons   having   practical\r\n\r\nexperience of matters relating to banking, finance,\r\n\r\nindustry  and trade administration. The Board  will\r\n\r\nbe  responsible for its own day-to-day transactions\r\n\r\nbut  may  be given broad directives by the Governor\r\n\r\nin  Council on matters appearing to them to concern\r\n\r\nthe public interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure, Sir, that this Bill will be welcomed\r\n\r\nby hon.

Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  objects  of the Board,  as  defined  in\r\n\r\nclause 4 of the Bill, appear to be wholly laudable\r\n\r\nand  cover a very wide field and the powers of the\r\n\r\nBoard, as defined in clause 5, are themselves very\r\n\r\nwide  and  high-sounding but I take  it  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Industrial Promotion Board, when  it  is\r\n\r\nestablished,  will, in fact, be,  as  it  were,  a\r\n\r\npilot   plant  for  a  larger  industrial   credit\r\n\r\ncorporation such as the Federation Government  has\r\n\r\nin  mind to establish. The Explanatory Note states\r\n\r\nthat the Industrial Promotion Board will have -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...at its disposal a revolving fund to enable\r\n\r\nloans to be made to local industrialists who  lack\r\n\r\nthe capital to acquire the equipment necessary for\r\n\r\nexpanding   their   production   on    the    most\r\n\r\nadvantageous economic basis.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Apparently,  this sum is to be $1  million  which,\r\n\r\npresumably,  will  be voted  by  the  Assembly  as\r\n\r\nindicated  in clause 6. Now, $1 million  does  not\r\n\r\nstrike me as being a very large sum to dispose  of\r\n\r\nand  I  shall  be  obliged  if  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommerce and industry will indicate what is  meant\r\n\r\nby  \"a revolving fund?\" I myself have a fair  idea\r\n\r\nin  banking  circles what is meant by  \"revolving\"\r\n\r\nbut  this  type  of loan would be granted  by  the\r\n\r\nBoard, almost certainly, on a long-term basis  and\r\n\r\nI  shall  like to know, when the full  amount  has\r\n\r\nbeen  absorbed, whether a further $1 million  will\r\n\r\nbe  voted for the disposal of the Board or  is  it\r\n\r\nthe  intention that as advances are repaid  which,\r\n\r\npresumably,  will  take  a  very  long  time,  the\r\n\r\namounts  that  have been repaid will  then  become\r\n\r\navailable as part of the revolving loan. I  should\r\n\r\nlike some clarification on that point, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe welcome this Bill. If we are to criticise it at\r\n\r\nall,  it  will be only to say that perhaps  it  is\r\n\r\nlong  overdue and the amount allocated for  it  is\r\n\r\nnot sufficient to meet the needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past year, I have been greatly\r\n\r\ndisturbed  by  the  difficulties  met   by   small\r\n\r\nindustries  throughout the  country,  and  due  to\r\n\r\nfactories  having  to close down,  more  and  more\r\n\r\npeople are being thrown out of employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do hope that as soon as the $1 million which we\r\n\r\nare  asked to vote today is absorbed in  loans  to\r\n\r\nfinance  and  promote industries, Government  will\r\n\r\ncome forward to request further replenishments  of\r\n\r\nthis amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  support  this Bill. This is a good  Bill.  The\r\n\r\nprinciples  are that it will help local industries\r\n\r\nand  small factories to improve their products and\r\n\r\nmodernise  their  plants.  However,  having   been\r\n\r\ninformed that the amount of money that is going to\r\n\r\nbe allotted to help industries here is $1 million,\r\n\r\nI  ask:  how much help will these small industries\r\n\r\nbe  getting?  I had a talk with the office-bearers\r\n\r\nof  the  bee-hoon  manufacturing industry  who,  I\r\n\r\nthink, closed down their factories some time  last\r\n\r\nyear  and they have, since then, been seeking  the\r\n\r\nassistance of the Government. The talk revealed to\r\n\r\nme  that they will require somewhere in the region\r\n\r\nof  $300,000 to help them buy machinery, modernise\r\n\r\ntheir  plant  and produce goods that will  compete\r\n\r\nfairly  with imports from other countries. Now  if\r\n\r\nwe  have  $1 million and if we are going  to  help\r\n\r\nthis  class of manufacturers to the full, we  will\r\n\r\nthen  be expending about one-third of that  money.\r\n\r\nProbably, the  next  category  of  industrialists\r\n\r\ncoming along for assistance will be those of  soap\r\n\r\nfactories  and that might absorb another one-third\r\n\r\nof  that  $1 million. Again, recently, we had  the\r\n\r\nbiscuit  factories closing down with some of  them\r\n\r\nmoving  into the Federation and that might  absorb\r\n\r\nanother one-third. Therefore, we will have all the\r\n\r\nthree-thirds absorbed and if one will not revolve,\r\n\r\nit will come to a standstill. I think that if help\r\n\r\nis  going to come from Government, we must try  to\r\n\r\nhelp  these people even more. I do not think  that\r\n\r\nassistance in the matter of loaning them money  is\r\n\r\nall the answer. If you are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngoing  to manufacture goods for local consumption,\r\n\r\nthe population of Singapore is only over a million\r\n\r\nand  no  matter how much food you can  produce  to\r\n\r\nfeed the people, it will only be on a small scale.\r\n\r\nThe  aim  that  we  must  have  is  that  we  must\r\n\r\nmanufacture goods not only for our own consumption\r\n\r\nbut  also  for  export. Now, if we  are  going  to\r\n\r\nmanufacture  goods for export, then I  think  that\r\n\r\nthe  most  important thing is to find markets  for\r\n\r\nthe  outlet of our goods. I have said this  before\r\n\r\nand  I am repeating it again. Singapore is a small\r\n\r\nisland  with the Federation of Malaya as its  main\r\n\r\nhinterland. Taxation by the Federation  of  Malaya\r\n\r\nis  hitting us hard. Industries are not  going  to\r\n\r\nexpand  in Singapore but they are going  to  shift\r\n\r\nover  to the Federation. One of the industrialists\r\n\r\nof the soap factories recently said that they will\r\n\r\nsave  roughly $150,000 in tax a year. If  this  be\r\n\r\nthe  case,  no matter how much help  we  can  give\r\n\r\nthem,   we  will  find  expansion  of  industries,\r\n\r\nwhether  light or heavy, not in Singapore  but  in\r\n\r\nSouth Johore, probably around Johore Bahru. If  we\r\n\r\nhave  been considering ourselves as being part  of\r\n\r\nMalaya,  it will be the duty of the Government  to\r\n\r\ncome to a better understanding with the Federation\r\n\r\nand if we must be taxed, at least it could be made\r\n\r\nmore  preferential  than the  Empire  rates  as  a\r\n\r\ngesture  of  good neighbourliness  and  our  close\r\n\r\nconnection  with  the  Federation.  However,   the\r\n\r\nFederation Government is not the only market which\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  been having all  these  years.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  we  trade a great deal more with  countries\r\n\r\nlike Indonesia, Siam and Burma. It is not possible\r\n\r\nto   ask   businessmen  to  help   themselves   in\r\n\r\nnegotiating with the various Governments  on  ways\r\n\r\nand means of improving trade. Here is a case where\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  try its very  best  to  see  that\r\n\r\nconditions  for our traders will be  improved.  No\r\n\r\ndoubt,  the  answer  will be, \"These  are  foreign\r\n\r\ncountries;  they are independent states;  they  do\r\n\r\nnot  depend on us for anything; and whatever  they\r\n\r\ndo,  they are responsible to themselves, and  they\r\n\r\nlook  after  their own interests.\" But  I  suggest\r\n\r\nthat no matter what, Government must find\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  way whereby trade between these territories can\r\n\r\nbe  made  more  favourable for Singapore  and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  even if we find a market, we  must  still\r\n\r\nremember  that  we will be faced  with  very  keen\r\n\r\ncompetition  from such manufacturing countries  as\r\n\r\nHongkong and Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of the Singapore Industrial Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard  should  be to help industries  to  such  an\r\n\r\nextent  that they can produce goods at a cost,  if\r\n\r\nnot  comparable with that of goods  imported  from\r\n\r\nother countries, at least at the same price as what we\r\n\r\npay  for  them. I think that if these methods  are\r\n\r\nadopted and sincerely carried out, then there is a\r\n\r\nhope that this Board will be able to do much more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\neveryone of us has read through clause 4  of  this\r\n\r\nBill; it reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Board may in order to facilitate the\r\n\r\nindustrial and economic development of the  Colony\r\n\r\npromote  and  assist in the financing, management,\r\n\r\nor establishment of -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) new undertakings;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) schemes for the better organisation and\r\n\r\nmodernisation  of  and  the  more   efficient\r\n\r\ncarrying out of any undertaking; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the conduct of research into the industrial\r\n\r\npotentialities of the Colony.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the project is so nice and imaginative and\r\n\r\nit  looks so practical and enchanting.

So now the Government introduces  this\r\n\r\nBill  but, to me, it looks like a mockery  to  our\r\n\r\nlocal industrialists. They will simply laugh at us\r\n\r\nand  say, \"What are these crazy Assemblymen  doing\r\n\r\nthis  for? We are faced with the danger of closing\r\n\r\ndown our industries and yet they talk of doing  so\r\n\r\nmany  nice things and thinking up wonderful  plans\r\n\r\nin   connection  with  this  Singapore  Industrial\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board.\" Therefore, I wish to  put  this\r\n\r\nsuggestion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  Government that, if they sincerely believe\r\n\r\nthat  this Bill is essential and important  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore, they should try to have  very\r\n\r\nclose  co-ordination with the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\nI  understand that they have a similar organisation\r\n\r\nthere  and  so  the  Singapore Government  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation   of  Malaya  can  have  a   pan-Malayan\r\n\r\nIndustrial Promotion Board, otherwise we can  plead\r\n\r\nwith   the  Federation  Government  not  to  impose\r\n\r\nunreasonable import duties on certain articles  for\r\n\r\ncertain industries which they promised us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see no reason to support this Bill and\r\n\r\nwaste our time discussing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.48 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a pilot\r\n\r\nscheme,  we  do not oppose this Bill. We  face  the\r\n\r\nproblem of an entrepot economy if we view Singapore\r\n\r\nby  itself.  In fact, in the long run, if  we  take\r\n\r\nSingapore just by itself, there is really no  point\r\n\r\nin  having this Industrial Promotion Board.  But  I\r\n\r\nnotice in the Explanatory Note given at the end  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill, it reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Report of the International Bank Mission on\r\n\r\nthe Economic Development of Malaya recommended that\r\n\r\nconsideration  should be given to the establishment\r\n\r\nof a\r\n\r\npan-Malayan institute of industrial research and  a\r\n\r\npan-Malayan industrial credit institution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think for many years to come, even\r\n\r\ntaking  Malaya as a whole, that it is  possible  to\r\n\r\nhave  complete  State ownership of capital  and  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  potentials. Hence,  in  our  desire  in\r\n\r\ncommon  with  all other Asian countries  to  expand\r\n\r\nindustrially  and rapidly, we have to  attempt  all\r\n\r\nkinds  of  not quite orthodox socialist schemes  to\r\n\r\ntry  to  do  in  ten or twenty years what  European\r\n\r\nnations have taken about a hundred years to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are however two dangers in this scheme. As\r\n\r\nI  see  it, there are two difficulties: first,  the\r\n\r\nBoard   should   act  as  an  industrial   research\r\n\r\ninstitute.   Now,   is  this  industrial   research\r\n\r\ninstitute  going  to  carry out  research  only  on\r\n\r\nSingapore potentials or on a pan-Malayan basis?  If\r\n\r\nit  is  to  carry  out research only  on  Singapore\r\n\r\npotentialities,  then I suggest that  we  send  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Promotion Board to Hongkong where  they\r\n\r\ncarry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non,  I  am  told, a very lucrative, if  perhaps  an\r\n\r\nephemeral  entrepot trade, and that is the  end  of\r\n\r\nthe  matter.  If  we are to carry out  research  of\r\n\r\nlasting  value,  then it must be on  a  pan-Malayan\r\n\r\nbasis  and  there  must be co-ordination  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation. I think that the latter view of  a  one\r\n\r\nMalaya   has  become  accepted  in  the   political\r\n\r\nthinking  of  all political Parties  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthough   once   upon  a  time,   we   had   curious\r\n\r\n\"organisations\"  like the Progressive  Party  which\r\n\r\nbelieved that Singapore should go it alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second difficulty - this is an even graver\r\n\r\none - is  that as an industrial credit institute,  it\r\n\r\nbecomes  a sort of a jackpot into which friends  of\r\n\r\ninfluential  politicians could dip  their  fingers.\r\n\r\nSome  countries in South-East Asia have tried  this\r\n\r\ntechnique.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if a proposition is a sound one, whether to\r\n\r\nstart  a new industry or to expand an existing  one\r\n\r\nor  to  modernise it, there will always  be  sound,\r\n\r\nhardheaded, if somewhat ruthless businessmen,  like\r\n\r\nMr Sutherland, who will advance that money-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Not so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What is not so: that he is\r\n\r\nruthless or that he is a sound business-man?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> He has decided obviously to\r\n\r\npack up from South-East Asia and advisedly so\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> On the contrary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - because people like him, I\r\n\r\nthink,  will find it very difficult to get on  with\r\n\r\nthe  national industrial plants that may spring  up\r\n\r\nas  a  result of such Industrial Promotion  Boards.\r\n\r\nBut, as a matter of logical argument, I do not  see\r\n\r\nhow  we can explain this.

On the other  hand,\r\n\r\nas  the  first necessity to produce or manufacture\r\n\r\nanything,  you must have low costs  of  labour  or\r\n\r\nhandling  charges which you have not in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThen you have to compete with other countries from\r\n\r\nall over the world.

We have at present no hinterland which  can\r\n\r\ntake our products without imposing any duty. Where\r\n\r\nare  we  then to sell except to Singapore  and  to\r\n\r\noutside  countries? In Singapore itself,  we  have\r\n\r\nplenty   of   competition  from  foreign   imports\r\n\r\nproduced  on a scientific basis and mass-produced.\r\n\r\nI   can   visualise  one  thing  good  that   this\r\n\r\nIndustrial Promotion Board can do to this City and\r\n\r\nthat  is  to  promote  small-scale  industries  or\r\n\r\ncottage-industries.\r\n\r\nYou  can  employ our idle population  who  sit  at\r\n\r\nhome, possibly the ladies who do not want to  come\r\n\r\nout  and work in factories or the children  during\r\n\r\ntheir  leisure  hours. This lesson can  be  learnt\r\n\r\nvery easily-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. J.

Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to assure this House that this scheme,\r\n\r\nat  the  moment, is a pilot scheme  and  the  part\r\n\r\nwhere  it is considered a pilot scheme appears  in\r\n\r\nthe  footnote at the end of the Bill where it says\r\n\r\nthat $1,000,000 will be provided for the Board and\r\n\r\nI  did  mention also that to start the Board  off,\r\n\r\nthe  Government propose to provide $1,000,000. The\r\n\r\nlegislation  need  not  be  considered  as   pilot\r\n\r\nlegislation because as and when the Board requires\r\n\r\nmore  funds and as and when this Assembly provides\r\n\r\nthe Board with such more funds, the scheme can  be\r\n\r\nexpanded. It is my intention, when I find that  $1\r\n\r\nmillion  is  not sufficient, to come  up  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse  and  ask  for more funds.  I  am  glad  the\r\n\r\nreaction of Members of the Opposition is that they\r\n\r\nconsider  that $1 million is not enough  and  that\r\n\r\nmakes it easier for me to approach this House  for\r\n\r\nmore  funds when needed but I would like to  draw\r\n\r\nhon. Members' attention to clause 6 which states:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...the Minister may make advances to the\r\n\r\nBoard  from such moneys as are voted for  the\r\n\r\npurpose by the Legislative Assembly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Therefore, the Board is not tied up with  just  a\r\n\r\nmillion dollars which I am proposing to provide in\r\n\r\nthe first instance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  I  understand that the resolution to  provide\r\n\r\nthis  $1  million will be coming up  in  the  next\r\n\r\nsitting  and  will  be  moved  by  the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What is a revolving fund?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

You will notice  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill that a rough system is provided  on  how\r\n\r\nthe Board will grant the loans. Clause 4 (2) says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...the Board shall have due regard to the\r\n\r\neconomic  and commercial merits of any undertaking\r\n\r\nit  promotes,  assists, finances  or  manages  and\r\n\r\nshall  also take into consideration in considering\r\n\r\nsuch  economic and commercial merits, the economic\r\n\r\nmerits of any other undertaking in which it has an\r\n\r\ninterest  and  the  economic requirements  of  the\r\n\r\nColony as a whole.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for the Board to advance a loan, the major\r\n\r\nconsiderations   are:  What   are   the   economic\r\n\r\nrequirements of the Colony;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether  the  applicant fits in with the  economic\r\n\r\nrequirements of the Colony as a whole; if he does,\r\n\r\nwhether  he  has a proper business proposition  or\r\n\r\nnot? Also the Board can appoint one of its members\r\n\r\nto  sit on the managerial board of the undertaking\r\n\r\nit  finances to keep an eye on its activities. Now\r\n\r\nI  think that also deals with the question  raised\r\n\r\nby  the  Member  for Tanjong Pagar (Mr  Lee  Kuan\r\n\r\nYew).  He  mentioned  that the  Board  will  be  a\r\n\r\njackpot   into   which  friends   of   influential\r\n\r\npoliticians  could  dip their fingers,  etc.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat was one of my worries too because I have seen\r\n\r\nthat  happening in other countries and I have been\r\n\r\nvery  careful here to see that the powers  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  are minimised and that more  powers  are\r\n\r\ngiven  to the Governor in Council, so that if  you\r\n\r\nhave  a  Minister who may probably try to use  his\r\n\r\ninfluence, you will find that the matter  will  go\r\n\r\nto  all  the  other Ministers in  the  Council  of\r\n\r\nMinisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> They share it equally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

That question, Sir, has been referred  to\r\n\r\nin  this  House many, many times in the  last  two\r\n\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> It is very important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I admit that it is\r\n\r\nimportant. I have spoken on that question  myself,\r\n\r\nSir,  in this House and even this morning,  I  did\r\n\r\nmention  it  when  questioned by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown (Mr Lee Choon Eng). Sir, I have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid  before  that the adverse effect  of  these\r\n\r\nduties  is  causing me grave  worries.  We  have\r\n\r\ntaken  the  matter  up at the  highest  possible\r\n\r\nlevel  with the Federation Government  and  they\r\n\r\nhave promised consideration but beyond that, you\r\n\r\ncannot  force  their hand. It is absurd  to  say\r\n\r\nthat you can force another Government to do what\r\n\r\nyou  want them to do but what you can do  is  to\r\n\r\nmake   an   approach,  make  them  realise   our\r\n\r\ndifficulties and, as good neighbours, hope  that\r\n\r\nthey will co-operate with us. They have promised\r\n\r\nto  consider  the  matter. The  Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  and  the Minister for Finance  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation are not here at the moment; they  are\r\n\r\nboth  in London, and I hope again to pursue  the\r\n\r\nmatter  further  when both  of  them  return.  I\r\n\r\nadmit,  Sir,  that  some of our  industries  are\r\n\r\nbadly  affected  and some of them  may  have  to\r\n\r\nclose  down. Probably, some of them are thinking\r\n\r\nof going across to the Federation but I say that\r\n\r\nif  any  industry  wants to  go  across  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  it  is having a shortsighted  view.\r\n\r\nWe, Sir, in Singapore offer port facilities that\r\n\r\nare  the  best  in the East. We  have  a  highly\r\n\r\ndeveloped banking and insurance system. We  have\r\n\r\nhighly developed business skills here and though\r\n\r\nan  industry,  in Singapore, may  find  that  it\r\n\r\ncomes  up  against  tariff barriers  across  the\r\n\r\nCauseway, it can more effectively deal with  the\r\n\r\nexport  market outside Malaya. That  is  what  I\r\n\r\nsaid in my introductory speech to this Bill:  if\r\n\r\nwe can bring down the cost of our production and\r\n\r\nif  we  can produce more competitively, then  we\r\n\r\nhave a chance to survive and overcome the tariff\r\n\r\nobstacles.  It  is  no use  taking  a  defeatist\r\n\r\nattitude  and saying that just because  of  this\r\n\r\ntariff  policy of the Federation, we should  sit\r\n\r\nback  and  do  nothing  about  it.  That  is   a\r\n\r\ndefeatist attitude, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon mentioned about\r\n\r\ntrading with Indonesia. Sir, he is not aware  of\r\n\r\nwhat my Ministry has been doing in the past. Two\r\n\r\nmonths  ago - I believe, in September - certain  new\r\n\r\nregulations  came  up  regarding  barter  trade,\r\n\r\nrestriction on shipping, and so on, and we  took\r\n\r\nthe  matter  up strongly through the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nConsulate here. Within a week, I am glad to say,\r\n\r\nwe managed to put matters right and to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrevert  the position back to its level where  it\r\n\r\nwas  before the new regulations had come  in.  I\r\n\r\nhave  not publicised these things because  I  do\r\n\r\nnot consider it will be any good publicising all\r\n\r\nthese things. We are dealing with foreign Governments  and  we must be very circumspect  in  our\r\n\r\nreferences to them. We want to maintain friendly\r\n\r\nrelations  with them and, as has been  mentioned\r\n\r\nby  the Member for Telok Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy),\r\n\r\nwe have nothing of our own as we are an entrep\ufffdt\r\n\r\ntrading   community.  In  order  to   get   more\r\n\r\nemployment for our people, we are now trying  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  our industries but we have to  be  very\r\n\r\ncareful how we talk about other Governments  and\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  see  that we maintain  a  friendly\r\n\r\nattitude  towards them, so that  we  can  go  on\r\n\r\ntrading with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say, Sir, that this Bill is not a\r\n\r\nmockery  as  what  the Member for  Changi  said.\r\n\r\nProbably,   you  can  call  this  Bill   \"timely\r\n\r\nsuccour\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was mention of \"curious organisations\"\r\n\r\nlike  the Progressive Party. Well, Sir, we  have\r\n\r\nto thank this curious organisation a lot for the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  we experience with the  Federation\r\n\r\nnow! If the Labour Front had been in power,  you\r\n\r\nwould not have had this, probably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the clause that provides for the Board to\r\n\r\ncarry out research is clause 4 (1) (c). That  is\r\n\r\na  provision made in this Bill just in  case  we\r\n\r\nfind  it  necessary that the Board should  carry\r\n\r\nout  research into the industrial potentialities\r\n\r\nof  the  Colony.  It is to give the  Board  more\r\n\r\npower.  It does not necessarily follow that  the\r\n\r\npower  will  be  used. It is possible  that  the\r\n\r\nresearch  may  be  carried  out  by  a  separate\r\n\r\norganisation entirely but in case we  find  that\r\n\r\nwe  are limited in scope and we want to do it on\r\n\r\na small scale, it is possible that the Board can\r\n\r\ndo  it  then.  That is why we have  given  this\r\n\r\npower to the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the International Bank Mission on\r\n\r\nthe  Economic Development of Malaya  recommended\r\n\r\nthe establishment of a pan-Malayan institute  of\r\n\r\nindustrial research and a pan-Malayan industrial\r\n\r\ncredit institution. Sir, my colleagues and I  on\r\n\r\nthis  side  of  the House will be the  first  to\r\n\r\nadmit that the ideal approach to the economy  of\r\n\r\nthe Malay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeninsula  as  a whole would be on  a  pan-Malayan\r\n\r\nbasis but we have found that we have not been able\r\n\r\nto  get agreement on a pan-Malayan basis from  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government and therefore we have to  do\r\n\r\nit  now  on  our own. But this does not close  the\r\n\r\ndoor  to  a  future  merger of two  such  separate\r\n\r\ninstitutes in Singapore and in the Federation  if,\r\n\r\nat  a  later  date, we find that we come  to  some\r\n\r\npolitical  agreement. The answer to all this  pan-Malayan approach is that it is a political  answer\r\n\r\nand not an economic answer. Economics are dictated\r\n\r\nby political ideologies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was reference made, Sir, to cottage\r\n\r\nindustries. Personally, I am not convinced that we\r\n\r\ncan  have much cottage industries here because  we\r\n\r\ndo  not  produce anything much that would go  into\r\n\r\nthese industries, but that is something to which I\r\n\r\nhave  never closed my eyes and which we will  have\r\n\r\nto  investigate. If we do come across any sort  of\r\n\r\npossibility of establishing cottage industries, we\r\n\r\nwill not hesitate to give it our full attention. I\r\n\r\ncan give that assurance to this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Committee</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

The  general\r\n\r\nposition  of Governments under the Crown  is  that\r\n\r\nthe  income of one such Government arising in  the\r\n\r\nterritory of another is exempt from tax imposed by\r\n\r\nthe   second  Government  unless  the  income   is\r\n\r\nexpressly charged to tax in the taxation  code  of\r\n\r\nthe second Government. For example, in the absence\r\n\r\nof  any  specific imposition in the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nlaw,  funds  of  this Government invested  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom are free from United Kingdom income\r\n\r\ntax.  There is some doubt in the minds of the  law\r\n\r\nofficers whether this immunity from tax which does\r\n\r\nnot   appear   to  rest  on  statute  extends   to\r\n\r\nterritories  under Her Majesty's  protection;  for\r\n\r\nexample,  the  protected state of Brunei.  In  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances,   it  is  usual  to   exempt   such\r\n\r\nprotected territories specifically from tax.  This\r\n\r\ncan be done by including the territory in question\r\n\r\nin   the  First  Schedule  of  the  Ordinance   by\r\n\r\nresolution  of the Assembly under section  106  of\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need not stress, Sir, the material advantages of\r\n\r\nexempting investments of the Brunei Government  in\r\n\r\nthe Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment or City Council stock from tax.

Those of us who look forward to  a\r\n\r\nspirited  service  from  our  civil  service   are\r\n\r\ndelighted  to see that their leaders  are  men  of\r\n\r\ncalibre,  men  who understand that, with  merdeka,\r\n\r\ncomes the opportunity for greater service and  not\r\n\r\ngreater  loot.  I am sure though  that  not  every\r\n\r\nmember  of the civil service who is either  hoping\r\n\r\nnow or, at some future date, to become a Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary  and  enjoy  the  sum  of  $1,950   plus\r\n\r\nVariable  Allowance, Travelling  Allowance,  etc.,\r\n\r\nmay  be  in agreement with the proposal  of  their\r\n\r\nAssociation's President and Secretary that  $1,770\r\n\r\nwould  be  quite adequate and that, in  fact,  the\r\n\r\ntrend  should be downwards, not upwards.  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nare   inheriting  a  false  standard,  a  standard\r\n\r\ncreated by our white mandarinate who came overseas\r\n\r\nbecause  they  could not do as well \"at  home\"  in\r\n\r\nEngland.  As  we  take  over  these  positions  of\r\n\r\ncontrol,  we  must understand that the  difficulty\r\n\r\nfacing  us  is not the difficulty of getting  more\r\n\r\nloot because whilst we are in control, we can fill\r\n\r\nour pockets. The difficulty is one of remaining in\r\n\r\nthe saddle and of preventing the whole system from\r\n\r\ncollapsing. There is what in Marxist terminology\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  be  called  a  revolutionary  situation  in\r\n\r\nMalaya.   There  is  a  state  of  unrest.   Men's\r\n\r\nattitudes  and  minds  are  undergoing  a  violent\r\n\r\nchange. Before the war, we might have found  peons\r\n\r\nquite  happy and contented; the officer whose  car\r\n\r\ndoor he opens every morning as he faithfully waits\r\n\r\nin  the  rain for him earns in one month  what  he\r\n\r\nearns  in  20  months. Even today, a peon  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  service gets somewhere around  $120  a\r\n\r\nmonth,  compared  to the Permanent  Secretary  who\r\n\r\ngets  somewhere around $2,400 a month. Anyone  who\r\n\r\nis familiar with peons, not when they are in their\r\n\r\nlivened uniform, now minus red stripes despite the\r\n\r\ndesire of the Hon. the Chief Secretary to put them\r\n\r\nin  livery,  know that they are not happy  at  the\r\n\r\nthought that they earn 1/20th of what is earned by\r\n\r\nthe  men whom they have to answer to when the bell\r\n\r\nrings. What he earns in one month, the peon  earns\r\n\r\nin  20  months.  Hence, this desire  for  a  rapid\r\n\r\ntransformation  in society. I was  glad  to  note\r\n\r\nthat  one  of  the  serving officers  in  a  Press\r\n\r\nstatement  said  that  the  trend  is  towards  an\r\n\r\negalitarian society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are some Members of this Assembly who,\r\n\r\nwhen they got elected, thought that the purpose of\r\n\r\ntheir  coming into this Assembly was to put  up  a\r\n\r\nbadge on their cars and inform the world that they\r\n\r\nwere above everybody else and that they should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  the right of way. Some have even suggested\r\n\r\nthat Ministers should have little pennants just as\r\n\r\nthe   Governor  has  the  Union  Jack,  the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary   has   the  flag  of   Singapore,   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of Police has a little blue  pennant\r\n\r\nand  the  Vice-Chancellor  of  the  University  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  has an enormous blue flag with a tiger  on\r\n\r\nit. Nowhere in the world have we a Vice-Chancellor\r\n\r\nflying  a  pennant.  It  is  like  those  Japanese\r\n\r\noccupation   days   when  every  colonel,   major,\r\n\r\nbrigadier flew either a blue, red or yellow  flag.\r\n\r\nIf  we  try  to maintain positions of  privileges,\r\n\r\nthen the whole system will collapse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways in which we move towards an\r\n\r\negalitarian society: one: we ease ourselves gently\r\n\r\nas  those  who have given and those who  have  not\r\n\r\ntaken and evolve a new society; two: where the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhole   social   order  crumbles   and   a   tight\r\n\r\nrevolutionary dictatorship takes over and  creates\r\n\r\nby  force, if necessary, the new order of  things.\r\n\r\nThere  are some societies in this world that  have\r\n\r\navoided  such a violent and a painful  revolutionary  process.

Of course, he might be\r\n\r\nfaced   with   having  to  obtain  the  Governor's\r\n\r\nrecommendation or consent, but I do not think that\r\n\r\nhe  is entitled to assume that he will not get the\r\n\r\nrecommendation or consent of the Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I have, on one previous\r\n\r\noccasion, sought the Governor's consent to discuss\r\n\r\nconditions  of service of some class  of  officers\r\n\r\nwhich I have now forgotten. It was connected  with\r\n\r\nthe emoluments of the civil service. It was flatly\r\n\r\nturned down and those were in the days when we had\r\n\r\na Chief Minister who was very keen on exposing the\r\n\r\nwhite civil service and all their misdeeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may just wind up my argument: I was\r\n\r\npointing  out  that the Director  of  the  Swedish\r\n\r\nRailways  earns 3,200 krone as against 1,800  krone\r\n\r\nfor his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nengine-drivers.  In other words, the  Director  of\r\n\r\nMalayan  Railways should get under twice what  his\r\n\r\nengine-driver gets. I do not know what  the  exact\r\n\r\nfigures  are  but I am quite sure that  it  is  in\r\n\r\nmultiples of ten that the Director compares to the\r\n\r\nengine-driver.  I think that if the  Labour  Front\r\n\r\nMembers  had met - as the Chief Minister met - a  very\r\n\r\ndistinguished Israeli, Mr Moshe Sharett,  Foreign\r\n\r\nMinister  and  Acting Prime Minister,  they  would\r\n\r\nhave  discovered that the highest paid man in  the\r\n\r\nIsraeli  Government cannot be paid more  than  six\r\n\r\ntimes  the lowest paid man. On that basis,  I  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to review the adoption  of  false\r\n\r\nEuropean  standards, superimposing them  over  our\r\n\r\nlocal mandarinate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

I understand, Sir, that  in  at\r\n\r\nleast  one neighbouring country, when they reached\r\n\r\nindependence,   they   did   introduce   a    very\r\n\r\nconsiderable cut in the salaries which, no  doubt,\r\n\r\nthey  had inherited from their particular type  of\r\n\r\n\"mandarinate\" - I think that is the  word - and  I  am\r\n\r\nadvised,  Sir, that the result of that, no  doubt,\r\n\r\npatriotic  gesture at that time, was very  adverse\r\n\r\nto  the interest of the country. I mention that by\r\n\r\nway  of  starting to comment on the  remarks  made\r\n\r\nbecause  I  would like Members of the Assembly  to\r\n\r\nregard this proposal to reduce the salaries of the\r\n\r\ncivil   service  as  one  that  has   considerable\r\n\r\ncomplications and one that should be treated  with\r\n\r\ncaution and with due consideration. Do not  please\r\n\r\nget led away into a quick decision by two or three\r\n\r\n\"men  of  calibre\" who have given  tongue  in  the\r\n\r\nPress  but  have not yet thought fit to  make  any\r\n\r\nrepresentations  to the Government.  There  are  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of points which have got to be taken  into\r\n\r\naccount  in  dealing with what may, at first  sight,\r\n\r\nseem  a very attractive suggestion, that there  is\r\n\r\nthe  local  man  to  take over from  the  overseas\r\n\r\nofficer  and that it is patriotic and  right  that\r\n\r\nthe  rates of pay should be reduced. First of all,\r\n\r\nof  course,  there is already a reduction  between\r\n\r\nwhat the local man gets and what the overseas  man\r\n\r\ngets.  The overseas man still draws that wonderful\r\n\r\nand  much  discussed  extra pay - expatriation  pay.\r\n\r\nNow,  local  officers do not  get  that  and  that\r\n\r\nshould  be  remembered when  you  are  considering\r\n\r\nrelative  salaries.  But  there  are  other   very\r\n\r\nimportant   questions  which  you  have   got   to\r\n\r\nconsider. First of all, you must relate  what  you\r\n\r\nare going to pay the top men in your civil service\r\n\r\nto the structure of the service as a whole. Two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears ago, we revised the superscale structure  of\r\n\r\nthe civil service and when we were doing that,  it\r\n\r\nwas  my very keen desire personally to reduce  the\r\n\r\nnumber of superscale grades. I thought we had  far\r\n\r\ntoo many and I made a great effort at that time to\r\n\r\ntry  and reduce the number of grades down to about\r\n\r\nthree. Well, I found I could not do it. So we have\r\n\r\nnow  got five grades running from the top  of  the\r\n\r\ntimescale  to these posts of Permanent  Secretary.\r\n\r\nNow,  if  you  are going to reduce your  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretaries down to $1,770 a month, then obviously\r\n\r\nyou  have  got to do one of two things:  you  have\r\n\r\neither  got to reduce the number of grades or  you\r\n\r\nhave  got  to  downgrade every  grade  below  them\r\n\r\nincluding the top of your timescale. Now,  it  may\r\n\r\nbe that that would be a good thing to do and it is\r\n\r\npossible that the top of the ordinary timescale is\r\n\r\ntoo  high. If you start reducing the top  of  your\r\n\r\ntimescale, then you may have to consider  reducing\r\n\r\nthe  bottom of your timescale and you are involved\r\n\r\nin a very complex business of revising your salary\r\n\r\nscales throughout the whole Government service.  I\r\n\r\ndo not think that you can change one series of top\r\n\r\nposts    without   getting   involved   in   those\r\n\r\ncomplexities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another very important point is that you must\r\n\r\nbear  in mind the comparable rates of remuneration\r\n\r\nwhich  can  be obtained by local people  in  doing\r\n\r\nsimilar    type    of   work   in   non-Government\r\n\r\nestablishments. You must relate the remuneration a\r\n\r\nman  can  get in the Government service  with  the\r\n\r\nremuneration  he  can probably  get  in  your  big\r\n\r\nindustrial  business concern. If  you  do  not  do\r\n\r\nthat,  then you only get a second-rate  man  going\r\n\r\ninto  your public service and, of course, you must\r\n\r\nconsider  very carefully the rewards that  can  be\r\n\r\nobtained in the professions. Now we have  a  legal\r\n\r\nservice in the public service and we must  have  a\r\n\r\ngood legal service. In order to recruit your legal\r\n\r\nservice, you have got to compete with the  rewards\r\n\r\nthat  are  won  by people at the Bar  and  if  the\r\n\r\nrewards   cannot  possibly  be  commensurate   and\r\n\r\nreasonably  related, then you  will  not  get  the\r\n\r\nright type of man to be your legal adviser and you\r\n\r\nwill not get\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  right  type of men eventually  to  fill  your\r\n\r\nposts of Attorney-General and on the Bench.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need say any more but I would\r\n\r\njust  stress that while, at first sight, it  seems\r\n\r\nattractive,  we  should  not  jump  to   a   hasty\r\n\r\nconclusion,  that  because  a  certain  number  of\r\n\r\nindividuals have made a gesture - no doubt,  a  very\r\n\r\nfine gesture - of having their salaries reduced,  we\r\n\r\nshould  at  once accept the offer. It  is  a  more\r\n\r\ncomplicated business than that and if the view  is\r\n\r\nheld that the salary scales throughout the service\r\n\r\nthat  are inherited are too high, then the  simple\r\n\r\nremedy  is to reduce the variable allowance  which\r\n\r\nis provided for that express purpose and leave the\r\n\r\nmain  structure  unaltered,  unless  you  wish  to\r\n\r\nbecome   involved   in  a  very  complicated   and\r\n\r\nprolonged business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.44 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, it is rather\r\n\r\ninteresting  to hear the Member for Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\ncite as examples what happens in Sweden and Israel\r\n\r\nas  a  pattern  upon  which  we  should  base  the\r\n\r\nsalaries  of our Government service.

A  flying\r\n\r\nclub is a club which helps people to fly and it is\r\n\r\nvery  valuable  in Singapore that we  should  have\r\n\r\nmany  people  who  are interested  in  flying  and\r\n\r\ncompetent  to fly. It forms a reservoir of  flying\r\n\r\ntalent and an encouragement to the young men to go\r\n\r\ninto  civil aviation careers. We are hoping  that,\r\n\r\nin  the  next  few  years, we  shall  get  a  very\r\n\r\nsignificant expansion of civil aviation  here  and\r\n\r\nit  will  be a sad story if we have to import  the\r\n\r\nexpatriates,  who  so  irritate  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  and the Member for Serangoon  too,\r\n\r\ninstead  of using our own local boys. It  is  with\r\n\r\nthe   idea  that  the  Flying  Club  can  make   a\r\n\r\nsignificant contribution to the ab initio training\r\n\r\nin  certain  cases and perhaps, more valuably,  to\r\n\r\nthe general air-mindedness of Singapore, that this\r\n\r\ncontribution is proposed.
