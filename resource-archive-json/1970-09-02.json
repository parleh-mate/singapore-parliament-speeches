Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthough  I  agree  with the hon. Member  that  rapid\r\n\r\nchanges  are taking place in Southeast Asia,  there\r\n\r\nappears to be no change as yet on the part  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Republic of China towards the Republic  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. Members of the House are no doubt  aware\r\n\r\nthat  the policy of the People's Republic of  China\r\n\r\ntowards Singapore is that it does not exist  as  an\r\n\r\nindependent state and that it is, as far as  it  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  a  part of what the Chinese  Government\r\n\r\nrefers to as Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being so, I do not see how Singapore could\r\n\r\nconsider   a   \"more   realistic   reappraisal   of\r\n\r\nrelations\" with a country which, for reasons of its\r\n\r\nown, considers that the State of Singapore does not\r\n\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the policy of the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nhas been, as has constantly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen   reiterated,   to  be   friendly   with   all\r\n\r\ngovernments which are ready to be friendly with it.\r\n\r\nBut it is extremely difficult to be friendly with a\r\n\r\ngovernment which appears to believe that the  State\r\n\r\nof Singapore does not exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker. Sir, I have two supplementary questions to\r\n\r\nraise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has said\r\n\r\nthat   basically  the  attitude  of  the   People's\r\n\r\nRepublic  of China towards us has not changed.  But\r\n\r\nif we continue to do things like letting the Taiwan\r\n\r\nGovernment's  trade representatives  conduct  their\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  Singapore,  how  can  we  expect  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Republic of China to change its  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards us?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, what kind of attitude will our\r\n\r\nrepresentatives in the United Nations adopt towards\r\n\r\nthe  question of admission of the People's Republic\r\n\r\nof China?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I think the Member is aware that\r\n\r\nin  regard to trade between countries, the question\r\n\r\nof  recognition does not enter into the picture. We\r\n\r\ndo  trade  with  the  People's  Republic  of  China\r\n\r\ndespite  the  fact that it does not  recognise  us.\r\n\r\nSimilarly  we  do trade with the Taiwan  Government\r\n\r\ndespite  the  fact  that  it  does  recognise   our\r\n\r\nexistence. So I think trade has nothing to do  with\r\n\r\nthe question of recognition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to our attitude towards the People's\r\n\r\nRepublic  of  China in the United Nations,  if  the\r\n\r\nMember will read the back numbers of newspapers, he\r\n\r\nwill see that we have made our position clear -that\r\n\r\nwe  are  for  the admission of China to the  United\r\n\r\nNations. But, unfortunately, in the United  Nations\r\n\r\nthis  question is not decided on its merits.  There\r\n\r\nis  a lot of political manoeuvring going on. So the\r\n\r\nquestions are invariably phrased in such a  way  as\r\n\r\nto  compel us to take sides on what are essentially\r\n\r\nbig   power  political  struggles  in  the   United\r\n\r\nNations. So we always say that in principle we  are\r\n\r\nquite   prepared  to  support,  as  we  have,   the\r\n\r\nadmission  of  China  to the United  Nations.  Once\r\n\r\nhaving  decided  on  that, we  shall  consider  the\r\n\r\nquestion of the status of Formosa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  a further supplementary question. The Foreign\r\n\r\nMinister   has  said  that  trade  and   diplomatic\r\n\r\nrecognition are two separate matters. But  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to know this. We have trade contacts with  the\r\n\r\nTaiwan Government in the five years since we became\r\n\r\nindependent.   But  have  we  any  trade   contacts\r\n\r\nofficially with the People's Republic of China?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like the Foreign\r\n\r\nMinister to clarify is this. In the United Nations,\r\n\r\ndo  we  adopt  the  attitude that,  as  a  tactical\r\n\r\nmeasure, we avoid facing the important question  of\r\n\r\nrecognition  of  the People's Republic  of  China's\r\n\r\nright  of representation?

As explained by the Minister\r\n\r\nof  Defence  in a press statement issued  in  March\r\n\r\n1967, the Government adopted this requirement  with\r\n\r\ntwo objectives in mind.

The primary consideration for admission\r\n\r\nto   a  higher  institution  of  learning  is   the\r\n\r\npossession of academic standards acceptable to  the\r\n\r\ninstitution  concerned. This implies that  not  all\r\n\r\nstudents  who  seek admission can be admitted  even\r\n\r\nthough  they  may  have the minimum qualifications.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  the number of students  that  can  be\r\n\r\nadmitted  to  an  institution  of  higher  learning\r\n\r\ndepends   on   a   number  of  factors,   such   as\r\n\r\naccommodation, staffing and finance, which in  turn\r\n\r\ndepend  on  the  economy of  the  country  and  its\r\n\r\nmanpower requirements. There can, therefore, be  no\r\n\r\ninherent right to higher education for anybody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the \"students' inherent right to\r\n\r\nhigher  education\" is a stirring  slogan  which  is\r\n\r\noften used by politicians and political parties  in\r\n\r\ntheir  struggle for political power. However,  once\r\n\r\npower  is seized, no party ever honours it, whether\r\n\r\nit  be in a western democracy or a Communist state,\r\n\r\nfor  the  simple reason that it is only  an  empty,\r\n\r\nalbeit catching, slogan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent sitting of Parliament, the Member for\r\n\r\nCrawford  made a pertinent point that the  days  of\r\n\r\nslogan  shouting  were over. I am  afraid  the  so-called   \"students'  inherent   right   to   higher\r\n\r\neducation\"  is  precisely the  type  of  empty  and\r\n\r\nmeaningless  slogan  shouting so  deplored  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Crawford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I\r\n\r\nask  my  supplementary questions, I would  like  to\r\n\r\npoint  out  that  I do not shout empty  slogans.

In regard  to\r\n\r\nport  operations,  the present Act  is  silent  and\r\n\r\nwhile  the  Jurong Town Corporation  has  power  to\r\n\r\nborrow  by the creation of debentures, this  method\r\n\r\nis  not  acceptable to both the World Bank and  the\r\n\r\nAsian  Development Bank which do  not  wish  to  be\r\n\r\ninvolved as debenture holders. Therefore, power  to\r\n\r\nborrow direct must be provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jurong Port, with its five berths, started\r\n\r\noperation  in early 1966 and the cargo handled  has\r\n\r\nnow passed the one million-ton mark. It is expected\r\n\r\nthat, with the rapid development of Jurong Town and\r\n\r\nwith    the   increasing   number   of   industries\r\n\r\nestablished,  the  cargo handled will  increase  by\r\n\r\nabout  20 per cent per year for the next ten years.\r\n\r\nThe  Port  has  now reached full occupancy.  It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  necessary that it be  expanded  to  cope\r\n\r\nwith  the  future  demand. The expansion  which  is\r\n\r\nplanned  involves the reclamation of Pulau  Chichir\r\n\r\nto  make  available 40 acres of land, extension  of\r\n\r\nBerth  No. 5 from its present 465 feet to its  full\r\n\r\nlength  of about 900 feet, and connection of  Berth\r\n\r\nNo. 1 to Pulau Chichir by a causeway to provide for\r\n\r\n2.400  feet  of additional deep-water wharves.  The\r\n\r\ntotal cost of this expansion is about $30 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the large sum involved, the Jurong\r\n\r\nTown   Corporation  has  applied   to   the   Asian\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Bank for a loan of about $25  million.\r\n\r\nNegotiations   for   this  loan   have   now   been\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  concluded, and the President  of  the\r\n\r\nAsian Development Bank will be in Singapore to sign\r\n\r\nthe  Loan Agreement on the 4th September, 1970.

There is, amongst other things,\r\n\r\nspecific  prohibition on the  investment  of  trust\r\n\r\nfunds  in  the  form of loans to a company,  unless\r\n\r\nthat company is an approved company which satisfies\r\n\r\nthree conditions, namely:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) its ordinary share capital is not less\r\n\r\nthan S$5 million;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) it has paid a dividend at the rate of not\r\n\r\nless than 5 per cent per annum for each of  the\r\n\r\nlast  three  years prior to  the  time  of  the\r\n\r\ninvestment; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the total amount of the borrowings of the\r\n\r\napproved  company  from all  sources  does  not\r\n\r\nexceed  two-thirds of the amount for  the  time\r\n\r\nbeing secured to the approved company from  its\r\n\r\nborrowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It follows, therefore, that in order to qualify as\r\n\r\nsuch, a company must have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  in  existence  as  a  Singapore  incorporated\r\n\r\ncompany for not less than three years prior to  the\r\n\r\ntime  of the investment, assuming, of course,  that\r\n\r\nit  has  straightaway paid a dividend of  not  less\r\n\r\nthan  5  per centum for the very first year of  its\r\n\r\nincorporation.   Indeed   a   company   which   has\r\n\r\nreconstructed itself for the sole reason of seeking\r\n\r\nto qualify as an approved company, or a new company\r\n\r\nwhich  has taken over another company qualified  as\r\n\r\nan approved company, may be caught by reason of the\r\n\r\nexclusionary  provisions. In order,  therefore,  to\r\n\r\naccommodate  such  companies which  may  heretofore\r\n\r\nhave  been properly enjoying the status of  trustee\r\n\r\ninvestment companies and have been excluded  merely\r\n\r\nbecause of the technical requirements of section  3\r\n\r\nof  the Act in respect of the status of an approved\r\n\r\ncompany, the proviso in section 4 (2) (b) has  been\r\n\r\nintroduced. The Government recognises the need  for\r\n\r\nthe  prohibition at present contained in section  4\r\n\r\n(2)  (b) ,  the  object of which  provision  is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  to ensure that such a company is  a  going\r\n\r\nconcern  and has made profits sufficient enough  to\r\n\r\nallow  it  to declare a reasonable rate of  return.\r\n\r\nThis  general  rule  is  thus  preserved,  but  the\r\n\r\nproviso accords a flexibility which was missing and\r\n\r\nwhich was not envisaged in the Act of 1967. It  may\r\n\r\nbe  said,  therefore,  that the  present  amendment\r\n\r\nproposed  in the Bill merely removes the  technical\r\n\r\nimpediments  in  the  way of  former  reconstructed\r\n\r\ncompanies   but  leaves  untouched  the  safeguards\r\n\r\ncontained in the Act of 1967. Companies which  have\r\n\r\nbeen  amalgamated or been subject to reconstruction\r\n\r\nbut  which are essentially the same as their former\r\n\r\nselves,  as  it  were, will not  be  thus  unfairly\r\n\r\nprejudiced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Barker].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 1, to leave out lines 12 to 18 inclusive\r\n\r\nand insert -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\" Provided that where an approved company is or\r\n\r\nhas  been  reconstructed  and  amalgamates  with  a\r\n\r\ncompany or has taken over the whole of the business\r\n\r\nand  the  assets of a company, which has  satisfied\r\n\r\nthe   conditions  of  this  paragraph,   the   said\r\n\r\nconditions  shall be deemed to have  been  complied\r\n\r\nwith  by  the approved company, unless it fails  to\r\n\r\npay  a  dividend at the rate of not less than  five\r\n\r\nper  centum in respect of its first full  financial\r\n\r\nyear  of  operations or in respect of  any  of  its\r\n\r\nsubsequent financial years; and\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment as now proposed is to remove\r\n\r\nany  doubt whatsoever that a company which has been\r\n\r\nreconstructed  and amalgamates with another,  which\r\n\r\nother company has heretofore enjoyed the status  of\r\n\r\nan approved company, or has taken over the whole of\r\n\r\nthe  business and assets of a company which on  its\r\n\r\nown has attained the status of an approved company,\r\n\r\nwould  after  such reconstruction and amalgamation,\r\n\r\nor   taking-over  or  merger,  be  deemed  to  have\r\n\r\nsatisfied   the   principal  conditions   of   this\r\n\r\nparagraph.

I  propose,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   to  confine  myself   to   the   major\r\n\r\namendments proposed therein. These amendments  are,\r\n\r\nin  the main, designed to bring more lands that are\r\n\r\napproved for development under the Ordinance and to\r\n\r\nbring  the  Ordinance into line with the provisions\r\n\r\nof  the  Land  Titles (Strata) Act, 1967,  and  the\r\n\r\nPlanning Ordinance, 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill is designed to hasten the\r\n\r\npace  generally of conversion to the Torrens System\r\n\r\nof land registration by empowering the Registrar of\r\n\r\nTitles  to  bring unregistered land, in respect  of\r\n\r\nwhich  permission to develop has been granted under\r\n\r\nthe Planning Ordinance, 1959, under the control  of\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance by issuing a qualified certificate of\r\n\r\ntitle  in  respect  thereof.  The  registration  of\r\n\r\nconveyances  can  thus  be  effected  more  quickly\r\n\r\nwithout survey being finalised. This provision will\r\n\r\nhave  the  beneficial effect of enabling purchasers\r\n\r\nof  units  of new housing estates and,  in  certain\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  owners  of flats  to  obtain  their\r\n\r\ntitle   deeds   with  a  minimum  of   delay,   and\r\n\r\nimmeasurably  assist landowners  who  wish  to  use\r\n\r\ntheir  title deeds as security for loans to finance\r\n\r\ncommercial or industrial undertakings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 deals with implied easements for the\r\n\r\npassage  of water, electricity, drainage,  gas  and\r\n\r\nsewerage  in each lot of land forming part  of  the\r\n\r\nsame  housing estate. The purpose of this amendment\r\n\r\nis  to  resolve the difficulty in carrying out  the\r\n\r\nexisting  provisions of the Ordinance  relating  to\r\n\r\nnotification of easements on certificates of titles\r\n\r\nwhere cross-easements in respect of all lots  in  a\r\n\r\nhousing  estate  are  required  to  be  created.  A\r\n\r\nsimilar  provision  appears  in  the  Land   Titles\r\n\r\n(Strata) Act, 1967, which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas satisfactorily solved the difficulty under that\r\n\r\nAct with regard to flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 amends section 112 of the Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThe  existing provision in section 112 (4)  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  does  not  specify the  cases  where  an\r\n\r\napplication to remove a restriction could  be  made\r\n\r\nto  the land. The applicant, therefore, has to rely\r\n\r\non  common law cases. The provision now under  this\r\n\r\nclause  will enable the court to remove restrictive\r\n\r\ncovenants   on  the  application  of   any   person\r\n\r\ninterested  in land where, by reason of the  change\r\n\r\nof  user  of  such  land, the  continuance  of  the\r\n\r\nrestriction will impede development for  public  or\r\n\r\nprivate purposes, or where the removal thereof will\r\n\r\nnot  materially injure the person entitled  to  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of the restrictive covenant. Provision  is\r\n\r\nalso  made  for  compensation to  be  paid  by  the\r\n\r\napplicant to any person entitled to the benefit  of\r\n\r\nthe restriction. This will thus allow landowners  a\r\n\r\nreasonable opportunity of developing their land  in\r\n\r\nline  with  any  planning user that is  imposed  by\r\n\r\nGovernment.  This  amendment  will  meet  in   some\r\n\r\nmeasure the representations of the Law Society  for\r\n\r\nthe  enactment of legislation for the discharge  or\r\n\r\nmodification of restrictive covenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 amends section 127 of the Ordinance and\r\n\r\nprovides  that  claims may be brought  against  the\r\n\r\nassurance fund constituted under section 123 of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  only if the Registrar or any  member  of\r\n\r\nhis  staff  can  be held liable for  any  omission,\r\n\r\nmistake or misfeasance in the bringing of such land\r\n\r\nunder  the  provisions  of  the  Ordinance  or   in\r\n\r\nregistering any instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment that relates to the assurance\r\n\r\nfund occurs in clause 7 which amends section 33  of\r\n\r\nthe   Ordinance   dealing  with  applications   for\r\n\r\npossessory titles. Under the existing provisions of\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance, any applicant for a possessory title\r\n\r\nmay be required to contribute to the assurance fund\r\n\r\nsuch fee by way of indemnity, not greater than  two\r\n\r\nper  cent  of  the  value of  the  land.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nExplanatory Statement to the Bill is incorrect  and\r\n\r\nmisleading to the extent that it suggests that an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplicant  is required to contribute. This  should,\r\n\r\nof  course,  read \"may be required to  contribute\".\r\n\r\nThe  issue of a title to a possessory owner of land\r\n\r\nexposes  the Government to claims for the  recovery\r\n\r\nof  damages against the assurance fund under clause\r\n\r\n17 of the Bill. Such claims will normally depend on\r\n\r\nthe  prevailing  market value of the  land.  It  is\r\n\r\nconsidered  that the present rate of two  per  cent\r\n\r\nmay be inadequate. In certifying a title that rests\r\n\r\non   adverse  possession,  the  assurance  fund  is\r\n\r\nexposed  to  a  greater degree of  risk  than  with\r\n\r\nregard  to  other  forms of  certification.  It  is\r\n\r\nrelevant that a person with a possessory title  is,\r\n\r\nby  virtue of subsection (6) of section 33  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  deemed to be a purchaser of  value  who\r\n\r\nthus acquires many of the benefits conferred by the\r\n\r\nprovisions   of   the   Ordinance   dealing    with\r\n\r\nindefeasibility  of  title.  It  is   proposed   to\r\n\r\nincrease this rate to five per centum which is  the\r\n\r\npresent rate required to be paid under Rule  43  of\r\n\r\nthe Land Titles Rules, 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 confers power upon the court to rectify\r\n\r\nthe land-register in certain circumstances, that is\r\n\r\nto  say,  where two or more persons have by mistake\r\n\r\nbeen   registered  as  proprietor   of   the   same\r\n\r\nregistered estate or interest in the land  that  is\r\n\r\nregistered,  or  where the court is satisfied  that\r\n\r\nany  registration or notification has been obtained\r\n\r\nthrough  fraud,  omission or  mistake.  At  present\r\n\r\nthere  is  provision  under  section  131  of   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  for rectification only by the  Registrar\r\n\r\nwhere errors have occurred in the land-register.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments to which I have referred up\r\n\r\nto  this  point  cover the new  concepts  of  major\r\n\r\nimportance  that  are sought to be introduced  into\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance. The other amendments which are  not\r\n\r\nwithout  importance are intended either  to  remove\r\n\r\nanomalies, for example, clause 19, or to strengthen\r\n\r\nand  improve  the administration of  the  Ordinance\r\n\r\n(clauses  3,  4,  5, 8 and 16), or to  protect  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the Government (clause  12),  or  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the legal profession (clause  9).

Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Constitution in\r\n\r\norder  to ensure that Bills affecting \"the  defence\r\n\r\nor  security of Singapore or which relate to public\r\n\r\nsafety,  peace or good order in Singapore\"  can  be\r\n\r\nintroduced into this House and made law without the\r\n\r\nneed   of  further  scrutiny  by  the  Presidential\r\n\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law now stands, Money Bills (as defined by\r\n\r\nthe Constitution) and Bills certified as urgent  by\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister may be made law without  prior\r\n\r\nconsideration thereof by the Council. In respect of\r\n\r\nMoney  Bills, provisions in the Constitution itself\r\n\r\nexclude  their consideration by the Council.  Bills\r\n\r\ncertified  as  urgent  by the Prime  Minister  are,\r\n\r\nafter  their having been made law, referred to  the\r\n\r\nCouncil for its opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members may therefore ask why the  need  for\r\n\r\nthis  amendment. Recently the Presidential  Council\r\n\r\nconsidered the Enlistment Bill (Bill No. 17/70).  I\r\n\r\nunderstand that among other arguments against  some\r\n\r\nof  the  provisions, there was one that Ministerial\r\n\r\ndiscretion  was  so  wide  as  to  be  possible  of\r\n\r\ndiscrimination.  In this case, a  majority  of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil upheld an interpretation of the legislation\r\n\r\nwhich did not cause the Bill to be referred back to\r\n\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it brought home to the Government the\r\n\r\nrealisation  that  it  could  have  been  extremely\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  explain, either to the  Presidential\r\n\r\nCouncil, or in this House, sensitive issues  as  to\r\n\r\nwhy  exemption  or  deferment of  call-up  for  any\r\n\r\nperson  or  group of persons would not  be  in  the\r\n\r\nnational  interests.  On  matters  of  defence   or\r\n\r\nsecurity,  there  are times when a Minister  cannot\r\n\r\ngive  his  reasons. For example, a person aged  18,\r\n\r\notherwise fit and eligible, might have to  be  left\r\n\r\nout of the armed forces because he is known to have\r\n\r\npro-Communist  or  other extremist  tendencies,  or\r\n\r\nthat he comes from such a family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had envisaged these teething problems when the\r\n\r\nPresidential  Council  Act  was  passed.  When  the\r\n\r\nPresident formally swore in members of the Council,\r\n\r\nhe had this to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`From the experience of the workings of your\r\n\r\nCouncil  and  of  any teething  problems  that  may\r\n\r\narise,   amendments  to  the  law   governing   the\r\n\r\nPresidential Council may be necessary.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  has  been  found to be the  case  in  a  Bill\r\n\r\nrelating to defence and security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally it would have been the President who\r\n\r\nwould  certify such a Bill. But as the Presidential\r\n\r\nCouncil  advises the President, it has been thought\r\n\r\nmore appropriate that the Prime Minister should  so\r\n\r\ncertify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps in conclusion, Sir, it may be useful if I\r\n\r\nwere to recall what was said in this House when the\r\n\r\nprinciple of a Presidential Council was agreed  to,\r\n\r\nnamely,   that  this  Council  cannot   limit   the\r\n\r\nsovereignty  of  Parliament. It  is  not  a  supra-Parliamentary body overseeing this Parliament. Only\r\n\r\nthe  Courts can interpret what has been legislated,\r\n\r\nand only the electorate can bring about a change in\r\n\r\nthe legislative policies of this Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Barker].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee: reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HEALTH (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House will recall that in\r\n\r\nDecember  1968 the Environmental Public Health  Act\r\n\r\nwas passed. This Act was brought into operation  on\r\n\r\nthe  2nd January. 1969. Since its enactment,  great\r\n\r\nstrides  have  been  made  by  the  Public   Health\r\n\r\nDivision  of  the Ministry of Health to  raise  the\r\n\r\nenvironmental health standards in our Republic and,\r\n\r\nin particular, the problems of public cleansing and\r\n\r\nlittering  in public places have to a large  extent\r\n\r\nbeen resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have now before you a Bill seeking to amend\r\n\r\nthe  Environmental Public Health Act of 1968.  This\r\n\r\nBill  is  the  result of a thorough review  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  provisions  of the Act  and  is  aimed  at\r\n\r\nstrengthening  some of the existing provisions,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  providing for some newer health  problems\r\n\r\nwhich were not envisaged during the drafting of the\r\n\r\nprincipal   Act.  The  primary  purpose   of   this\r\n\r\namendment Bill is to effect further improvements in\r\n\r\nthe  field of environmental health based  upon  the\r\n\r\nexperience gained since the Act came into operation\r\n\r\nsome 20 months ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a determined effort put in both by the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the people, Singapore has attained a\r\n\r\nhigh  standard  of environmental health.  Singapore\r\n\r\nnow  enjoys  the  reputation of being  one  of  the\r\n\r\ncleanest  cities in the world - a  fact  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen acknowledged and acclaimed by various visitors\r\n\r\nto Singapore. However, Singapore has a highly built-up urban environment where living space is becoming\r\n\r\nmore  and  more congested as we build  upwards.  We\r\n\r\ncannot  therefore  afford to  relax  standards.  We\r\n\r\nshould strive for even higher standards so that our\r\n\r\npeople can enjoy even better living conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important amendment in the Bill is clause 11\r\n\r\nwhich  seeks to repeal the existing section  56  of\r\n\r\nthe  principal  Act to enable the  Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nPublic  Health or the Director of Public  Works  to\r\n\r\nrequire  the  owner or occupier  of  any  house  or\r\n\r\nbuilding  or  such parts thereof, which  is  in  an\r\n\r\nunclean,  grimy, neglected, unkempt  or  insanitary\r\n\r\ncondition, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncleanse  and  paint  or  lime-wash  internally   or\r\n\r\nexternally  or both internally and externally  such\r\n\r\nhouse  or  building.  A  new  section  56A  further\r\n\r\nprovides,  in the case of rent-controlled premises,\r\n\r\nfor  the owner to recover from the tenant the costs\r\n\r\nand  expenses incurred in executing any work within\r\n\r\nthe  interior of the controlled premises  in  equal\r\n\r\ninstalments  over  a  period of  24  months.  These\r\n\r\nprovisions are necessary if some of the older parts\r\n\r\nof  Singapore not yet designated for urban  renewal\r\n\r\nor  redevelopment  are not to  deteriorate  further\r\n\r\ninto unsightly slums. This is particularly true  of\r\n\r\nthe  rent-controlled premises whose owners  do  not\r\n\r\ndeem  it  economic nor have any desire  to  prevent\r\n\r\nthem   from  becoming  dilapidated,  resulting   in\r\n\r\nugliness and insanitation. This is contrary to  our\r\n\r\nobjective of making Singapore a clean and beautiful\r\n\r\ncity. Under the new provisions, such buildings will\r\n\r\nhave  to  spruce up for both aesthetic and sanitary\r\n\r\nreasons.  Some may consider that this is an  unfair\r\n\r\nrequirement on the part of Government being imposed\r\n\r\non  owners  of  property; but in  a  compact  urban\r\n\r\nsociety, certain norms of conduct will have  to  be\r\n\r\nobserved for the greater good of the members of the\r\n\r\ncommunity  as a whole. I wish, however,  to  assure\r\n\r\nhon.  Members  of this House that the powers  given\r\n\r\nunder   this   section  will  be   exercised   with\r\n\r\ndiscretion and in a reasonable manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of problems, such as the removal of\r\n\r\nnightsoil  and  domestic  refuse  in  new   housing\r\n\r\nestates,  have  been  encountered  when  developers\r\n\r\nallowed the occupation of these estates before they\r\n\r\nhad   completed  the  sewerage,  drainage  or  road\r\n\r\nfacilities. This can now be dealt with under clause\r\n\r\n4  whereby  the Commissioner of Public  Health  can\r\n\r\nrequire  the  developer to provide at  his  expense\r\n\r\nsuch   services   as  may  be   required   by   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner for a specified period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 seeks to prohibit the use of human\r\n\r\nexcreta  for the purpose of manuring potted  plants\r\n\r\nin  domestic  premises, as this practice  not  only\r\n\r\nresults in creating a smell nuisance, but can  also\r\n\r\nspread disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our declared policy on the control of water\r\n\r\npollution  and  its  eventual  elimination,  closer\r\n\r\nattention  must  be  directed  to  the  problem  of\r\n\r\ndumping  refuse  and garbage into streams,  rivers,\r\n\r\ncanals  and  drains, as well as  the  pollution  of\r\n\r\nreservoirs, lakes and catchment areas. This will no\r\n\r\nlonger  be  dealt with by the issue of notices  and\r\n\r\nsummonses as formerly provided under subsection (2)\r\n\r\n(c) and subsection (3) (d) to (g) of section 50  of\r\n\r\nthe  principal Act which is an extremely cumbersome\r\n\r\nprocedure. The amendment proposed by clause 6  will\r\n\r\nbring  this problem within the ambit of section  26\r\n\r\nto  enable speedier enforcement action by means  of\r\n\r\n\"ticketing\". Further, enabling provisions have been\r\n\r\nincorporated so that \"ticketing\" action may also be\r\n\r\ntaken   against   any   person   contravening   any\r\n\r\nrequirements in respect of public cleansing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summons action against hawkers operating in\r\n\r\nprohibited areas provided under section 38 will now\r\n\r\nbe  amended  to \"ticketing\" action similar  to  the\r\n\r\nexisting  provisions of sections 40 and 41  of  the\r\n\r\nAct  which  are  applicable  to  unlicensed  stall-holders and itinerant hawkers. This is provided  in\r\n\r\nclause 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medical Officers of Health and Public Health\r\n\r\nEngineers  will  be empowered by  an  amendment  to\r\n\r\nsection  57  to  deal with the  problem  of  wasps,\r\n\r\nhornets  and  other insects which  are  capable  of\r\n\r\nstinging.  This  is laid down in  clause  12.  This\r\n\r\nproblem will now be handled by my Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 deals with the problem of stagnant\r\n\r\nwater  due  to  inadequate  drainage  arising  from\r\n\r\nexisting  subdivision of land without  the  setting\r\n\r\naside  of  drainage  reserves with  its  consequent\r\n\r\nhealth  hazards.  This  will  be  resolved  by  the\r\n\r\nproposed amendment to section 76 which will  enable\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner of Public Health  or  the  Public\r\n\r\nHealth  Engineer to require owners to  provide  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  drains and, if necessary, to carry  such\r\n\r\ndrains through adjoining lands or lots which happen\r\n\r\nto lie in the line of natural drainage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 empowers the Commissioner or any\r\n\r\nMedical   Officer  of  Health  or   public   health\r\n\r\nauxiliary  at any time to enter into,  inspect  and\r\n\r\nsearch any premises used or believed to be used for\r\n\r\nthe purpose of offensive trades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have tried to highlight all the important clauses in the amendment Bill. I have no doubt of the necessity of these proposed amendments to strengthen the hands of Government in dealing with the problems of environmental health. However, what is more important is the people's\r\n\r\nunderstanding   of   these   provisions   and   the\r\n\r\nobjectives of a better environment which they  seek\r\n\r\nto  achieve.  I  have every confidence  that,  with\r\n\r\nunderstanding,  our people will  again  give  their\r\n\r\nactive    support   and   co-operation    in    the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  the  measures  that   will   be\r\n\r\nundertaken  under the amended Bill,  and  we  shall\r\n\r\nadvance  a  step  further  towards  improving   the\r\n\r\nquality of our environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Chua Sian Chin].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BANKING BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.17 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law regulating banking in Singapore at\r\n\r\npresent   is  substantially  the  Malayan   Banking\r\n\r\nOrdinance of 1958 which was modified in April  1967\r\n\r\nonly  to  empower  the  Singapore  Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nBanking to administer this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlaw.  At  that time, a draft Banking Bill had  been\r\n\r\nprepared  by  the International Monetary  Fund  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  but it was considered that, in  view  of\r\n\r\nthe  impending change in the monetary system caused\r\n\r\nby  the  redemption of the Malayan dollar  and  the\r\n\r\nissue of the Singapore dollar, there would be  some\r\n\r\nadvantage in avoiding unnecessary changes in  other\r\n\r\nparts  of the system and, therefore, in maintaining\r\n\r\nthe  status  quo of banking in Singapore  vis-a-vis\r\n\r\nMalaysia. Now the redemption of currency issued  by\r\n\r\nthe  Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and\r\n\r\nBritish Borneo, has all but been completed, and the\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollar is firmly and fully  established.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  the banking legislation in Malaysia  has\r\n\r\nalso been amended. It is therefore appropriate that\r\n\r\nwe  should now enact our own legislation to include\r\n\r\nmodifications which would overcome the shortcomings\r\n\r\nof the present legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banking Bill now before Members incorporates\r\n\r\nthe   basic   features  of  the   current   Banking\r\n\r\nOrdinance, but it also introduces a number  of  new\r\n\r\nprovisions,  the  most  important  of   which   are\r\n\r\ndesigned  to  ensure  better  and  sounder  banking\r\n\r\npractices   and  to  better  safeguard  depositors'\r\n\r\ninterests. They include restrictions on the  amount\r\n\r\na   bank   can  grant  to  a  single  customer,   a\r\n\r\nprohibition from engaging in trade, restrictions on\r\n\r\nthe  extent  a bank can acquire equity capital  and\r\n\r\nimmovable  property,  and on the  amount  of  loans\r\n\r\nextended   for   the  purpose  of  purchasing   and\r\n\r\nimproving immovable properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More comprehensive definitions appear for \"bank\"\r\n\r\nand  \"banking business\". A new concept of  \"capital\r\n\r\nfunds\"  has  been  introduced  so  that  a  healthy\r\n\r\nrelationship between a bank's lending power and its\r\n\r\nnet  worth  in  Singapore is  maintained.  \"Capital\r\n\r\nfunds\"  mean,  for  a  bank whose  head  office  is\r\n\r\nsituated  in  Singapore, its  paid-up  capital  and\r\n\r\nreserves  and,  for  a bank whose  head  office  is\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore, the net head office  funds  and\r\n\r\nsuch  other  liabilities as  the  Commissioner  may\r\n\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the current legislation, the operation of a\r\n\r\nbank in Singapore requires\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na licence. The minimum capital requirement has been\r\n\r\nraised  from $2 million to $3 million. In the  case\r\n\r\nof  a  foreign bank, this has been raised  from  $5\r\n\r\nmillion  to $6 million with a requirement that  the\r\n\r\nnet  head  office funds in Singapore should  be  at\r\n\r\nleast  $3  million.  At present foreign  banks  are\r\n\r\nrequired   to  hold  $2  million  approved   assets\r\n\r\nlocally.   It   is   not  considered   that   these\r\n\r\nrequirements  will  cause any difficulty  to  banks\r\n\r\nalready licensed, but a transitional period of  two\r\n\r\nyears, which can be further extended by approval of\r\n\r\nthe Minister, is being provided for compliance with\r\n\r\nthe requirements. It is further proposed to require\r\n\r\nbanks  and  their  branches  to  pay  licence  fees\r\n\r\nannually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at present, certain statistical statements\r\n\r\nwill   be   required   to  be  furnished   to   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner and the Chief Statistician. Every bank\r\n\r\nshall also send to the Commissioner particulars  of\r\n\r\nall  advances, loans and credit facilities  granted\r\n\r\nto  any of its Directors, any firm in which any  of\r\n\r\nits  Directors  is  a partner, or  to  any  related\r\n\r\ncorporation,  etc.  The Commissioner  may  prohibit\r\n\r\nsuch  further grants of advances, loans  or  credit\r\n\r\nfacilities  or  impose restrictions on  the  grants\r\n\r\nunless  he  is  satisfied that these would  not  be\r\n\r\nagainst  the  interests of the  depositors  of  the\r\n\r\nbank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Banking Bill spells out\r\n\r\nrestrictions  on  certain  types  of  business  and\r\n\r\nprohibitions  on others. These prohibiting  clauses\r\n\r\nare  new  and are designed to safeguard depositors'\r\n\r\ninterests.  They  have  been  recommended  by   the\r\n\r\nInternational Monetary Fund, and are found  in  the\r\n\r\nbanking  laws  of  a  number  of  other  countries.\r\n\r\nBriefly,  they are that no bank will be allowed  to\r\n\r\ngrant  to  any single customer any credit  facility\r\n\r\nwhich  is at any time more than 60 per cent of  its\r\n\r\ncapital funds, though this can be increased to  100\r\n\r\nper  cent  with  the approval of the  Commissioner.\r\n\r\nAgain,  no  bank shall grant any advance or  credit\r\n\r\nfacility  against the security of its  own  shares.\r\n\r\nUnsecured facilities to any Director, any  firm  in\r\n\r\nwhich any of its Directors is a partner, or to  any\r\n\r\nrelated  corporation, etc.,  would  be  limited  to\r\n\r\n$5,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnsecured facilities to its employees would also be\r\n\r\nlimited,  nor will a bank be allowed to acquire  or\r\n\r\nhold equity capital or other undertakings exceeding\r\n\r\nin  the aggregate 40 per cent of its capital funds.\r\n\r\nProvision is made, however, for the Commissioner to\r\n\r\napprove any shareholding in any corporation set  up\r\n\r\nfor   the  purpose  of  promoting  development   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  To prevent speculation on  property,  a\r\n\r\nprovision  has  been  made  that,  apart  from  the\r\n\r\nproperties used as banking offices and for  housing\r\n\r\nits employees, no bank shall be allowed to purchase\r\n\r\nor  acquire immovable properties exceeding  40  per\r\n\r\ncent  of its capital funds. Loans extended for  the\r\n\r\npurpose   of  purchasing  or  improving   immovable\r\n\r\nproperties are limited to 30 per cent of its  local\r\n\r\ndeposits   and,   with   the   approval   of    the\r\n\r\nCommissioner, up to 60 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No bank will be allowed to do trading on its own\r\n\r\naccount.   Whilst  this  provision  has  not   been\r\n\r\nspecifically  spelt out in the present legislation,\r\n\r\nbanks in Singapore do not in fact undertake trading\r\n\r\non  their own account and it is envisaged  that  no\r\n\r\ndifficulty will be encountered with this  provision\r\n\r\nwhich is common to most other banking laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are transitional provisions to enable banks\r\n\r\nwhich have, before the date of coming into force of\r\n\r\nthe    legislation,   entered   into   transactions\r\n\r\nprohibited  under  this  law,  to  liquidate   such\r\n\r\ntransactions or bring them within the law. In order\r\n\r\nto   allow  some  banks  time  to  adjust  to   the\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  the  new  Banking   Act,   I   am\r\n\r\nintroducing  an  amendment to the Bill  which  will\r\n\r\nenable  the  Commissioner, if he is satisfied  that\r\n\r\nsuch  time is required for adjustments, to grant  a\r\n\r\ngrace  period  not  exceeding  two  years  to   any\r\n\r\nparticular  bank  from the provisions  of  sections\r\n\r\n25,27  and  28  of  this Bill  (i.e.,  restrictions\r\n\r\ncovering   loans  to  a  single  borrower,   equity\r\n\r\ninvestment and immovable property).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the current legislation, there will be\r\n\r\nprovisions to require banks to keep minimum  liquid\r\n\r\nassets  in  Singapore  and  to  maintain  statutory\r\n\r\nreserves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith   the   Accountant-General.  There   is   also\r\n\r\nprovision  to  allow  control  over  banks  on  the\r\n\r\nregulation of interest rates, discount, commission,\r\n\r\nand  other  charges of banks. The Commissioner  may\r\n\r\nalso make recommendations on credit policy and,  if\r\n\r\nthese  are  not  complied with,  the  Minister  may\r\n\r\nimpose  such  directions as may  be  necessary  for\r\n\r\ntheir implementation. Inspection of books, accounts\r\n\r\nand  transactions  of  a bank under  conditions  of\r\n\r\nsecrecy  is  also  provided for. The  Minister  may\r\n\r\ndirect the Commissioner to make an investigation of\r\n\r\nany  books, accounts, and transactions of any  bank\r\n\r\nif  he  believes  the bank is carrying  on  unsound\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner and the Minister are provided\r\n\r\nwith  the necessary powers to take over the control\r\n\r\nof  a  bank if it is unable to meet its obligations\r\n\r\nor  is conducting its business to the detriment  of\r\n\r\nits  depositors.  The duration of control  is  laid\r\n\r\ndown and within this period the bank is required to\r\n\r\nco-operate with the Commissioner. The Commissioner,\r\n\r\nwith   the  approval  of  the  Minister,  may  also\r\n\r\nprohibit any bank from carrying on banking business\r\n\r\nif   he  considers  it  in  the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\ndepositors of the bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill introduces the concept of numbered\r\n\r\naccounts,  that is, accounts which are identifiable\r\n\r\nonly  by number or code word. No bank shall operate\r\n\r\nnumbered accounts except with the approval  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  who may attach conditions, qualifications\r\n\r\nand  limitations.  The owners of numbered  accounts\r\n\r\nshall only be known to senior officers of the bank.\r\n\r\nProvisions  are  made for absolute secrecy  on  the\r\n\r\npart   of   bank   officials  and  no   information\r\n\r\nconcerning the identity of the owner of a  numbered\r\n\r\naccount shall, be given, unless the account  holder\r\n\r\npermits it or he is declared a bankrupt or  a  suit\r\n\r\narises between him and the bank or when the account\r\n\r\nholder  is required to do so by order of  the  High\r\n\r\nCourt  made  for  special cause  in  any  civil  or\r\n\r\ncriminal proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new provision has been added prohibiting\r\n\r\ndisclosure  of information relating to the  affairs\r\n\r\nof  the  bank's customers to any person or body  of\r\n\r\npersons who are not resident in Singapore or to any\r\n\r\nforeign  Government  or organisations,  unless  the\r\n\r\ncustomer permits it or he is declared a bankrupt or\r\n\r\nthe information is for the purpose of assessing the\r\n\r\ncredit-worthiness of the customer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for the appointment of\r\n\r\napproved    auditors   and   their   duties,    the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of a Clearing House, bank  holidays,\r\n\r\npriority  of  deposit liabilities, disqualification\r\n\r\nof  Directors and employees of banks,  offences  by\r\n\r\nDirectors, and power to compound offences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also provided that the operation of the\r\n\r\nCompanies Act, 1967, shall not be affected by  this\r\n\r\nlegislation  though,  in  case  of  conflict,  this\r\n\r\nlegislation will prevail. The legislation will also\r\n\r\nnot  apply  to  the  Post Office  Savings  Bank,  a\r\n\r\nregistered  co-operative society, a licensed  pawn-broker, or a licensed finance company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I should like, in conclusion of my explanatory remarks, to say that this Banking Bill has received consideration over a considerable period of time, that consultations have been held during its preparation with the Association of Banks and others interested regarding its\r\n\r\nprovisions, but responsibility for the Bill in  its\r\n\r\nfinal  form  of  course remains with  my  Ministry.\r\n\r\nSince  its publication, a number of representations\r\n\r\nfrom banks have been received and I can assure them\r\n\r\nthat  every consideration has been given  to  their\r\n\r\nrepresentations and that it is not  my  purpose  to\r\n\r\nadminister  the law in any way which  will  curtail\r\n\r\nthe  effectiveness of the banking system. While the\r\n\r\nBill  would provide powers for the Commissioner  to\r\n\r\nhave   tighter   control  over  banks   and   their\r\n\r\nactivities,  the modernisation of the  banking  law\r\n\r\nshould  cut down unsound practices and so  work  to\r\n\r\nthe  general  interests of depositors, the  banking\r\n\r\nsystem and the public at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I will ask only one or two questions.

Sir, under the law\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  is empowered to issue new  licences.\r\n\r\nThe  practice over the last few years has been  not\r\n\r\nto  issue any further licences because obviously we\r\n\r\nhave too many banks in Singapore. If there are very\r\n\r\ngood  and  sound reasons why more banks  should  be\r\n\r\nlicensed - if, for example, in certain branches  of\r\n\r\nbanking  there  is any inadequacy - then  obviously\r\n\r\nsuch applications will be entertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not consider that the present minimum\r\n\r\nrequirement  of  $3  million  is  a  very  adequate\r\n\r\nqualification for banks in Singapore.  It  will  be\r\n\r\nimposed on the present banks and there should be no\r\n\r\ndifficulty  for most of them to meet  this  capital\r\n\r\nrequirement.

Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of this clause is to provide relaxation from the provisions of clauses 25, 27 and 28' which are based upon the capital funds concept; that is to bring in\r\n\r\nrestrictions  related  to  the  head  office  funds\r\n\r\nrather  than  the paid-up capital and  reserves,  a\r\n\r\nconcept more common in other legislation elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn  my  view,  there  should be  no  difficulty  in\r\n\r\nforeign  banks transferring, if necessary, some  of\r\n\r\ntheir-working capital funds as additional funds  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  in order to continue their  business  in\r\n\r\nSingapore in conformity with the provisions of  the\r\n\r\nclauses I have mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have received representations from the\r\n\r\nAssociation of Banks and the International  Chamber\r\n\r\nof Commerce on behalf of some of their members that\r\n\r\nthese   clauses  are  unduly  restrictive  in   the\r\n\r\ncarrying  on of their banking business. One  answer\r\n\r\nto  this,  may  well be that the local  banks  will\r\n\r\nwelcome  the  opportunity to take on  the  business\r\n\r\nwhich  they  are  unwilling to do  by  bringing  in\r\n\r\nadditional funds. It can be contended by the  local\r\n\r\nbanks that the amendment I have introduced can lead\r\n\r\nto   unfair  discrimination  against  them  because\r\n\r\nforeign banks can, on the face of it, expand  their\r\n\r\nbusiness  to the detriment of the business  of  the\r\n\r\nlocal banks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, because of the fragile climate in\r\n\r\nwhich  I  am  told  the industrial  and  commercial\r\n\r\ngrowth  is  nurtured,  I  have  by  this  amendment\r\n\r\nallowed  for  relief to be considered  on  specific\r\n\r\napplication  by  any  bank  whose  head  office  is\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore,  but only  for  the  first  two\r\n\r\nyears.  The bank must, however, show that any  such\r\n\r\nrelaxation is, really necessary and will not be  to\r\n\r\nthe detriment of depositors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause read a Second time and added to the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 34 to 72 inclusive ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedules 1 to 4 inclusive ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported with amendments; read a Third time\r\n\r\nand passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MONETARY AUTHORITY OF</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, as a result of historical factors,\r\n\r\nthe  various monetary functions normally associated\r\n\r\nwith  a  Central Bank are currently being performed\r\n\r\nby   a   number  of  Government  departments   ;and\r\n\r\nagencies. For instance, the responsibility for  the\r\n\r\ncurrency issue lies with the Currency Board,  which\r\n\r\nis a statutory authority. Then, the Commissioner of\r\n\r\nBanking  and the Commissioner of Finance  Companies\r\n\r\nis  responsible for the regulation and  supervision\r\n\r\nof banks and finance companies, whilst the Exchange\r\n\r\nControl  Department is responsible for all  matters\r\n\r\nconcerning    foreign   exchange.   Finally,    the\r\n\r\nDepartment  of Overseas Investment in  my  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Division  is  responsible   for   the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  the Government's  external  assets,\r\n\r\nwhile the Accountant-General is responsible for the\r\n\r\nsale of Treasury Bills to banks and other financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions, the raising of domestic loans and the\r\n\r\nmanagement of the clearing house system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite clearly, the task of co-ordinating and\r\n\r\ndirecting    the    policy   of   these    .diverse\r\n\r\norganisations makes for a full-time occupation  and\r\n\r\nwhile  the  present  system of ad  hoc  control  by\r\n\r\ncommittee has worked reasonably well up to now, the\r\n\r\nincreasing   complexity  of  modern   banking   and\r\n\r\nmonetary   management   makes   it   necessary   to\r\n\r\nstreamline the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem. Apart from rationalising the structure  and\r\n\r\norganisation of the system, the bringing  together,\r\n\r\nunder  one single authority, of all these different\r\n\r\norganisations  will enable a coherent  and  uniform\r\n\r\npolicy to be developed for all monetary matters. In\r\n\r\naddition, it is hoped that with the passage of time\r\n\r\nwill  come  the development of greater professional\r\n\r\nexpertise.   This  is  vital  for   the   efficient\r\n\r\nfunctioning of a modern monetary system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore proposed in the Bill now before\r\n\r\nthe  House  that  there  should  be  established  a\r\n\r\nMonetary  Authority  of Singapore,  comprising  the\r\n\r\ndepartments  I  have  mentioned  with  the   single\r\n\r\nexception  of the Currency Board. It is considered,\r\n\r\nfor  the  time  being,  that  the  currency-issuing\r\n\r\nfunctions  of the Board should remain with  it  and\r\n\r\nthat  the  Board should continue as an  independent\r\n\r\nand  separate  statutory authority.  The  automatic\r\n\r\nmechanism  of the Currency Board with its  100  per\r\n\r\ncent  external assets backing has been and will  be\r\n\r\nof  great  psychological importance in  maintaining\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  the  Singapore  Dollar.  Thus   the\r\n\r\noperations  and  the  assets backing  the  Currency\r\n\r\nissue  will be unaffected and will continue  to  be\r\n\r\nclearly  identified.  The Monetary  Authority  will\r\n\r\ntherefore  for the time being have no  note-issuing\r\n\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to discuss in some detail the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Bill for the establishment of the\r\n\r\nMonetary  Authority of Singapore. Part  II  of  the\r\n\r\nBill provides for the establishment, capitalisation\r\n\r\nand  administration of the Authority. Clause 3 sets\r\n\r\nup   the   Authority  as  a  body  corporate.   The\r\n\r\nauthorised  capital of the Authority  will  be  $30\r\n\r\nmillion,  while the paid-up capital  will  be  such\r\n\r\namounts  as may be approved by the Government  from\r\n\r\ntime to time. This is laid down in clause 5. Clause\r\n\r\n8   provides   for  a  Board  of  seven   directors\r\n\r\ncomprising  the Minister for Finance, who  will  be\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman,  the  Permanent Secretary  (Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment) of the Ministry of Finance,  who  will\r\n\r\nbe  the Deputy Chairman, the Accountant-General and\r\n\r\nfour other members who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  be  appointed by the President. Of  the  four\r\n\r\nmembers   appointed,  one  will  be  the   Managing\r\n\r\nDirector  of  the Authority. The Managing  Director\r\n\r\nwill    be    entrusted   with    the    day-to-day\r\n\r\nadministration  of  the  Authority  and   will   be\r\n\r\nanswerable to the Board for his acts and decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is envisaged that the staff of the departments\r\n\r\nwhich  I have named earlier will be transferred  to\r\n\r\nthe  Monetary Authority. Clauses 17 to  20  of  the\r\n\r\nBill   provide  for  this.  It  is  intended   that\r\n\r\nemployees from these Government departments will be\r\n\r\ntransferred to the Monetary Authority on  terms  no\r\n\r\nless  favourable than those that they are  enjoying\r\n\r\nwith  the  Government. The value of  their  pension\r\n\r\nrights will be safeguarded in any Authority pension\r\n\r\nor  provident fund schemes, The Authority shall act\r\n\r\non  the advice of the Public Service Commission  in\r\n\r\nregard  to appointments, promotions and termination\r\n\r\nof  employment, dismissal and disciplinary  control\r\n\r\nof its employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 (1) will enable the Authority to take\r\n\r\nover  the  powers  of  the  Government  under   the\r\n\r\nBanking,  Finance  Companies and  Exchange  Control\r\n\r\nOrdinances. It is further envisaged that it may  be\r\n\r\nnecessary in future for the Authority to administer\r\n\r\nother  functions in any specified law  relating  to\r\n\r\nbanking, investment or other financial matters, and\r\n\r\nprovision for this is made in clause 21(2) .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be necessary to transfer to the Authority\r\n\r\ncertain  assets  and liabilities of the  Government\r\n\r\narising  out  of  statutory  requirements  in   the\r\n\r\nbanking  and  finance companies legislation.  Banks\r\n\r\nand finance companies are required to maintain,  as\r\n\r\npart of liquidity requirements, a statutory reserve\r\n\r\nwith the Accountant-General based on 3\ufffd per cent of\r\n\r\ntheir   deposit   liabilities.  This   amounts   to\r\n\r\napproximately  $120 million. As the Authority  will\r\n\r\nnow be responsible for these matters, clause 21 (3)\r\n\r\nprovides  for the transfer of liabilities  together\r\n\r\nwith their matching assets to the Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 outlines in detail the powers of the\r\n\r\nAuthority, e.g., it may accept deposits  of  money;\r\n\r\nissue  demand  drafts; purchase and sell  gold  and\r\n\r\nforeign  currencies; purchase  and  sell  Treasury'\r\n\r\nBills  and  Government securities, etc.  Clause  23\r\n\r\nlays  down the general principles under `which  the\r\n\r\nAuthority's funds may be invested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Authority in its functions as banker and\r\n\r\nfinancial  agent to the Government will  mainly  be\r\n\r\nresponsible for the managing of the external assets\r\n\r\nof   the  Government,  undertaking  the-issue   and\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  Government loans  and  of  Treasury\r\n\r\nBills.

Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  establishment of' a  Monetary  Authority\r\n\r\nrepresents    a   welcome   tidying-up   operation,\r\n\r\ngathering  together a number of important  monetary\r\n\r\nand  exchange  activities  hitherto  exercised   by\r\n\r\ndisparate   authorities.  The  inclusion   of   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance as Chairman of the  Board  of\r\n\r\nDirectors  will ensure close co-ordination  between\r\n\r\nfiscal  and  monetary policies. The'  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance   is   also  Chairman  of  the   Board   of\r\n\r\nCommissioners of Currency. It is not quite clear to\r\n\r\nme  why the functions of the Currency Board are not\r\n\r\nbeing  brought within the purview of  the  Monetary\r\n\r\nAuthority  or vice versa. The Finance Minister  has\r\n\r\nmentioned\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat it is desirable to maintain confidence in  the\r\n\r\ncurrency  that we have at present. But I  do  think\r\n\r\nthat we can still retain the automatic features  of\r\n\r\na   currency  issue  while  yet  unifying   matters\r\n\r\nrelating to monetary policy, since control  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrency  issue is intimately related  to  monetary\r\n\r\npolicy in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general comment, I think Singapore has been\r\n\r\neminently  sensible in not following slavishly  the\r\n\r\nadoption   of  institutions  elsewhere.   In   most\r\n\r\ncountries,  the  Central  Bank  exercises  monetary\r\n\r\nauthority  autonomously and often not synchronously\r\n\r\nwith fiscal policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to welcome the establishment of a Monetary Authority of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know\r\n\r\nwhether  I  need answer the Member for Whampoa!

His remarks on the automatic  mechanism\r\n\r\nbeing  possible  also under the Authority  are,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  accepted. This is quite  possible.

It would  be  a\r\n\r\nmild  statement if I say that the White  Paper  had\r\n\r\nstirred   some  public  interest  and   discussion.\r\n\r\nReorganisation   of   any   kind   is   disturbing,\r\n\r\nespecially  for those who will be affected  by  its\r\n\r\nrecommendations  and will be  required  to  make  a\r\n\r\nchange  or  an  adjustment to their former  way  of\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I wish to express my thanks and\r\n\r\nappreciation  to  my Parliamentary  Secretary,  the\r\n\r\nMember   for   Tampines,  and   the   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Culture, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember  for Stamford, for their kind assistance  in\r\n\r\nproducing, at short notice, the Chinese translation\r\n\r\nof  the White Paper, the official version of  which\r\n\r\nwas printed in English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was thus possible for Members of Parliament,\r\n\r\nwho  are more conversant with the Chinese language,\r\n\r\nto be supplied with a proper Chinese translation of\r\n\r\nthe  contents  of the White Paper, as  well  as  to\r\n\r\nobviate the possibility of confusion in the Chinese\r\n\r\npress,  which may occur through variations  in  the\r\n\r\ninterpretation   of   the   text    by    different\r\n\r\ntranslators.

This\r\n\r\nresponsible   action,   of   which   I   am    most\r\n\r\nappreciative, on the part of the Chinese press  has\r\n\r\nensured  that the large Chinese reading public  are\r\n\r\naware  of  the actual contents of the White  Paper,\r\n\r\nand  thus puts a stop to those who, for reasons  of\r\n\r\ntheir  own  selfish interests, are opposed  to  the\r\n\r\nprinciples  of the White Paper and are bent  either\r\n\r\non  misinterpreting, confusing or  frustrating  the\r\n\r\npublic outcry for a long-overdue reorganisation  of\r\n\r\nthe public transport service of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That reorganisation will proceed is clear. As to\r\n\r\ndetails of implementation, some adjustments can, of\r\n\r\ncourse, be made provided there are good reasons  or\r\n\r\nany  new  information is brought to light, when  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  foolish and unreasonable not  to  accept\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite many press reports of supposed\r\n\r\nunhappiness  over  the implications  of  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper,  only  four petitions have been received  so\r\n\r\nfar, and will be given due consideration:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Singapore Lorry Owners Association\r\n\r\nof 1lB, New Bridge Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a letter dated 8th August, 1970, the then\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nFinance, and now Minister of State for Finance,  in\r\n\r\nhis capacity as legal adviser, forwarded a petition\r\n\r\nfrom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Lorry  Owners Association  claiming\r\n\r\nthat  \"70  per  cent of the vehicles owned  by  the\r\n\r\nmembers are over 15 years old\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Singapore School Transport Association of 40B Lorong 17, Geylang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their appeal was dated 14th August, 1970, and I\r\n\r\nhave  agreed  to meet their representatives  in  my\r\n\r\noffice on Saturday, the 5th of September.

This  Paper,  which  contains   several\r\n\r\nthousand  words,  enumerates the  various  problems\r\n\r\nfacing  our public transport service. It also  very\r\n\r\nfrankly  discloses  the various shortcomings  which\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Communications has faced  in  the\r\n\r\npast.  For  instance,  in its foreword,  the  Paper\r\n\r\ngives   three  possible  reasons  for  the  present\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory   state  of  our  public   transport\r\n\r\nservice, namely:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(a) Lack of definite policy in the past, with ad-hoc decisions being made as and when problems\r\n\r\narise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Lack of continuity in the incumbent of the\r\n\r\nimportant post of Registrar of Vehicles  (ROV).\r\n\r\nSince  1959  (11  years ago)  there  have  been\r\n\r\neight  officials filling this post. This  state\r\n\r\nof   affairs  is  certainly  not  conducive  to\r\n\r\nproper management of the Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) More financial support is needed to recruit an\r\n\r\nadequate number of qualified staff, to  provide\r\n\r\nproper  facilities and equipment to enable  ROV\r\n\r\nto   perform,  implement  and  to  enforce  its\r\n\r\nmultifarious duties.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>On this point the White Paper specifically mentions\r\n\r\nthat   the  income  of  the  Registry  of  Vehicles\r\n\r\ntotalled   $60   million  in  1969,   whereas   the\r\n\r\nexpenditure was only $1.2 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the three reasons given. In fact,\r\n\r\nthe  situation in the R.O.V, in the past was rather\r\n\r\nchaotic.  At the same time, it is only a branch  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Communications which  has  control\r\n\r\nover it. The Ministry of Communications was set  up\r\n\r\nonly in\r\n\r\n1968.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This White Paper also proposes several measures\r\n\r\nto  rectify  the situation, the most  important  of\r\n\r\nwhich  are to improve the services of buses, taxis,\r\n\r\nschool taxis and school buses, the amalgamation  of\r\n\r\nbus companies, and the eradication of pirate taxis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important measure is the anti-pollution\r\n\r\ncampaign  which is aimed at maintaining the  health\r\n\r\nof  our  two million people. This should merit  our\r\n\r\nsupport and attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper also proposes to impose an age\r\n\r\nlimit for various kinds of public vehicles, and  to\r\n\r\npurchase  a  further number of  buses,  taxis,  and\r\n\r\nother vehicles which will involve an expenditure of\r\n\r\n$50 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all these measures we can see that the White\r\n\r\nPaper  is  a significant and historic step  in  the\r\n\r\nreorganisation  of  our public  transport  service.\r\n\r\nSir,  these measures will have far-reaching effects\r\n\r\non  those who are engaged in the transport service.\r\n\r\nThe reorganisation plan is expected to be completed\r\n\r\nin   three  years,  and  as  it  will  affect   the\r\n\r\nlivelihood  of tens of thousands of our  people,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest that the Minister should carry it out  with\r\n\r\nthe  utmost care and tact. In implementing  it,  he\r\n\r\nshould formulate good, practical and proper methods\r\n\r\nand  regulations  in  order to improve  the  public\r\n\r\ntransport  system. At the same time, he should  try\r\n\r\nto  bring about a better transport system that will\r\n\r\nhelp  our  people  and promote our  industrial  and\r\n\r\ncommercial     development.    Furthermore,     the\r\n\r\nreorganisation plan should not adversely affect the\r\n\r\nlivelihood  of  the  workers  and  others  who  are\r\n\r\nengaged  in the transport service. If it is carried\r\n\r\nout   in  this  way,  everyone  will  support   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   in  its  far-reaching  and  farsighted\r\n\r\nreorganisation of the public transport system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to touch on the introduction of\r\n\r\nthe  age  limit of taxis. According  to  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper's proposals, the age limit of taxis is set at\r\n\r\nseven  years.  In other words, if  taxis  are  over\r\n\r\nseven years old, they will be delicensed. With this\r\n\r\nstipulation,   within  the  three  years   of   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the plan, about 30  per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthe  present 3,800 taxis, or 1,200 taxis, will have\r\n\r\nto  be replaced. Undoubtedly this measure will have\r\n\r\nvery  serious  consequences  for  taxi  owners  and\r\n\r\ndrivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have received a memorandum from the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Taxi Drivers' Association,  representing\r\n\r\nthe  labour  side, and also a memorandum  from  the\r\n\r\nTaxi  Transport Association, representing the  taxi\r\n\r\nowners,  complaining  about  their  problems.   The\r\n\r\nSingapore Taxi Drivers' Association thinks that the\r\n\r\nage  limit  of  taxis should be set at  ten  years,\r\n\r\nbecause taxis are better cared for and looked after\r\n\r\nthan   private   vehicles.   The   Taxi   Transport\r\n\r\nAssociation  also holds the same opinion,  and  has\r\n\r\nadvanced  very good reasons to support  this  view.\r\n\r\nThe  first  reason is the cost of a  taxi.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  the  majority of taxis are of  the  Morris\r\n\r\nOxford  model.  The  cost of a taxi  together  with\r\n\r\naccessories is $9,500. On top of it, there will  be\r\n\r\nan  expenditure  of  at least  $5,000  to  pay  for\r\n\r\nlicence  fees,  tyres,  insurance,  inspection  and\r\n\r\nrepair charges, etc. And the yearly income is about\r\n\r\n$6,000.  Balancing out, the yearly profit  will  be\r\n\r\nnot  more  than  $2,000. If a taxi  is  de-licensed\r\n\r\naccording to the seven-year stipulation, then after\r\n\r\ndepreciation  of  $1,000 per year  and  payment  of\r\n\r\ninterest,  if it is acquired on hire purchase,  how\r\n\r\ncan  a  taxi owner or driver make a profit  in  the\r\n\r\nend?  There  are  also some taxis of Mercedes-make.\r\n\r\nThe  cost  of such a taxi and accessories  is  more\r\n\r\nthan  $15,000. If we set a seven-year limit on this\r\n\r\nmake  of taxi, it means that every year there  will\r\n\r\nbe  a  depreciation loss of $2,000. Thus these taxi\r\n\r\nowners  will  not be able to make a profit  out  of\r\n\r\ntheir cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is the emission of excessive\r\n\r\nsmoke.  According  to figures given  in  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper, out of 1,413 buses, there were 515 cases  of\r\n\r\nsmoky\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexhausts.  Of the 6,652 lorries, there  were  1,828\r\n\r\ncases  of smoky exhausts. Of the 3,816 taxis, there\r\n\r\nwere 894 cases of smoky exhausts. From a comparison\r\n\r\nof  these figures, we can see that there were fewer\r\n\r\ncases  of  taxis with smoky exhausts than buses  or\r\n\r\nlorries.  This goes to prove that taxis are  better\r\n\r\nmaintained than other public transport vehicles. In\r\n\r\naddition, taxis have to undergo inspection twice  a\r\n\r\nyear.  If  a taxi is found to be in poor condition,\r\n\r\nit  will  not be allowed to operate. From this,  we\r\n\r\ncan  see  that  taxis are subject  to  very  strict\r\n\r\ncontrols.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the complaints by these Associations concern\r\n\r\nthe   livelihood   of  several   thousand   people.\r\n\r\nAccording to statistics, 4bout 1,000 new taxis will\r\n\r\nbe  made available to taxi drivers to own their own\r\n\r\nvehicles.  For  instance, recently  the  Government\r\n\r\nlicensed  600 taxis which belong to this  category,\r\n\r\nand they were bought on hire-purchase terms or from\r\n\r\nloans from finance companies. If the seven-year age\r\n\r\nlimit  is imposed, then the taxi owners will  incur\r\n\r\nan  unnecessary loss. At the same time,  this  will\r\n\r\nalso   adversely   affect  the  proposed   Workers'\r\n\r\nTransport Co-operative, to which the Government has\r\n\r\ngiven a $6 million loan. In the end, the Government\r\n\r\nmay  not be able to get back the money loaned  out.\r\n\r\nWho then is going to pay for it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is the saving in foreign exchange.\r\n\r\nAt  the  moment, there are no locally  produced  or\r\n\r\nassembled taxis. So the purchase of every new  taxi\r\n\r\nwill  incur a loss in foreign exchange. If  we  can\r\n\r\nextend  the age limit, we will not lose any foreign\r\n\r\nexchange  but instead will be able to provide  jobs\r\n\r\nfor those people in the taxi business. In addition,\r\n\r\naccording   to  the  White  Paper,  the   Transport\r\n\r\nAdvisory Board has proposed the age limit of  taxis\r\n\r\nto  be  set  at 10 years. Of course, this  has  the\r\n\r\nconcurrence  of the representatives of  the  people\r\n\r\nconcerned. I believe this proposal is of  practical\r\n\r\nvalue,  and in view of the valid reasons  given.  I\r\n\r\nthink the Minister should carefully reconsider  and\r\n\r\nchange the age limit to ten years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to touch upon the increase in\r\n\r\nthe  number of taxis. According to the White Paper,\r\n\r\nthe Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintends  to issue 1,200 new taxi licences,  200  of\r\n\r\nwhich  will be for special taxis. On this  question\r\n\r\nthe   Taxi   Drivers'  Association  has,   in   its\r\n\r\nmemorandum,  put  forward a different  proposition.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Association, our transport  system\r\n\r\nat  the  moment is already in a state of confusion.\r\n\r\nThere  are  various  kinds of taxis,  for  example,\r\n\r\nordinary taxis and SZ taxis. And if there is to  be\r\n\r\nanother  kind of special taxi, then it will  create\r\n\r\nfurther  confusion,  especially  to  tourists  from\r\n\r\nabroad.  Therefore, the Association  suggests  that\r\n\r\nthese  200  taxis should also be allocated  to  the\r\n\r\nproposed  Workers' Transport Co-operative.  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment decides to increase the number of  these\r\n\r\nspecial  taxis to serve passengers, then,  in  that\r\n\r\ncase,  the marking of this type of taxis should  be\r\n\r\ndifferent. For instance, a different colour  should\r\n\r\nbe  painted on the top of these taxis in order  not\r\n\r\nto mislead the passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Taxi Drivers' Association is also of the\r\n\r\nopinion  that  at the present stage no  more  taxi-driver licences should be issued because there  are\r\n\r\nnow more taxi-driver licences than taxis. There are\r\n\r\n14,000 taxi-driver licences, whereas the number  of\r\n\r\ntaxis is only 3,800. Hence, many taxi drivers  with\r\n\r\nlicences  do  not  have any taxis  to  drive.  They\r\n\r\ncannot   do   anything  but  stay  at   home.   The\r\n\r\nAssociation proposes that in the process of setting\r\n\r\nup   a   Workers'   Transport   Co-operative,   the\r\n\r\nauthorities  should  take  into  consideration  the\r\n\r\nratio  of the number of taxi drivers to the  number\r\n\r\nof taxis before any decision is made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association has also made a new proposition\r\n\r\nregarding  the  retiring age of  taxi  drivers.  It\r\n\r\nthinks that any taxi driver on reaching 60 years of\r\n\r\nage   should  be  allowed  to  continue  with   his\r\n\r\noccupation provided he is certified by a Government\r\n\r\ndoctor to be healthy and fit for his job. There  is\r\n\r\nno need for a grace period of three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think most of the propositions have merit. The\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  is  aimed  at  improving  the  public\r\n\r\ntransport service of Singapore. On the other  hand,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  the  duty  to  safeguard  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood of the taxi-drivers. It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  try  to  avoid causing any difficulties  to\r\n\r\ntheir   livelihood  when  the  new   measures   are\r\n\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to touch upon the replacement of\r\n\r\noverage  goods vehicles. According to the Table  of\r\n\r\nStatistics  in the White Paper, of the 6,652  goods\r\n\r\nvehicles, about 30 per cent of them, namely, 2,200,\r\n\r\nare  already  15  years old and  they  need  to  be\r\n\r\nreplaced.  On this point, I am of the opinion  that\r\n\r\nthe  replacement should be carried out  in  stages,\r\n\r\nbecause  goods vehicles are very important  to  the\r\n\r\ntransport  industry,  to  our  prosperous  building\r\n\r\nindustry, and the Port of Singapore Authority. They\r\n\r\nare also necessary to importers and exporters. They\r\n\r\ncannot carry on their business without them. At the\r\n\r\nmoment,  there  is  no plant for locally  assembled\r\n\r\ngoods  vehicles. Therefore, the new  vehicles  will\r\n\r\nhave to be bought from abroad. As a result, we will\r\n\r\nlose a lot of foreign exchange. I therefore suggest\r\n\r\nthat  the  replacement of goods vehicles should  be\r\n\r\ncarried  Out progressively so as not to affect  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  of  those sectors in industry  which  use\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next I come to the setting up of vehicle\r\n\r\nfactories,   either   Government-owned   or   joint\r\n\r\nventures. According to the White Paper, in  the  3-Year  Plan, it is necessary to buy 900 buses  at  a\r\n\r\ncost of $31.5 million, and 2,400 taxis at a cost of\r\n\r\n$20.7  million. The total equipment cost  is  about\r\n\r\n$50 million. In addition, there will be an increase\r\n\r\nof  450  school buses, and a total of  2,200  goods\r\n\r\nvehicles  will  need to be replaced. Undoubtedly  a\r\n\r\nvery large sum of investment will be involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its conclusion, the White Paper also points\r\n\r\nout that this is a great challenge to the people in\r\n\r\nthe transport industry. First, there is a very good\r\n\r\nopportunity for investment in the transport service\r\n\r\nand,  as  a  result, the drivers and  other  people\r\n\r\ninvolved will have better jobs. If the White  Paper\r\n\r\nis  not  wrong, there will be about 6,500 new  jobs\r\n\r\ncreated. Second, the motor industry, especially the\r\n\r\nlocally-assembled  vehicle  industry,   will   have\r\n\r\ngreater opportunities open to it. Third, the  local\r\n\r\nbanks, finance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompanies and the Development Bank of Singapore can\r\n\r\nalso  avail themselves of the opportunity to  enter\r\n\r\nthis field. It is correct to say that it is a great\r\n\r\nchallenge  to  all  of  them.  I  feel  that  given\r\n\r\ndetermination and spirit, the commercial firms  and\r\n\r\nthe  industrialists should be  able  to  set  up  a\r\n\r\nvehicle  assembly plant. It can be  set  up  either\r\n\r\nwith   private   capital  or   capital   from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. The Government can even set up its  own\r\n\r\nlocal  vehicle assembly plant. In partnership  with\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector, it can set up a jointly-owned\r\n\r\ncar  manufacturing factory which  can  assemble  or\r\n\r\nmake  various kinds of vehicles. It is  no  problem\r\n\r\nfor  the Government to get the money to do  so.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, we have people with the  necessary\r\n\r\nexpertise  to set up such a factory and manage  it.\r\n\r\nThis     will    provide    long-term    investment\r\n\r\nopportunities  which will save  a  lot  of  foreign\r\n\r\nexchange  and also provide more jobs for our  local\r\n\r\ncitizens. So it is like killing two birds with  one\r\n\r\nstone.  I hope the Minister will seriously consider\r\n\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next I come to the question of the administrative\r\n\r\nsystem  in the Ministry of Communications. I  think\r\n\r\nit   should   be  unified.  In  addition   to   the\r\n\r\nreorganisation of the public transport service  and\r\n\r\nthe purchase of more vehicles, there is also a need\r\n\r\nto   have   enough  public  officers  and  adequate\r\n\r\nequipment to cope with our requirements.  The  most\r\n\r\nimportant  point is that the administrative  system\r\n\r\nshould  be unified. At present the system works  on\r\n\r\nthis  basis.  The  R.O.V, is  responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nissuance  of vehicular licences and the  collection\r\n\r\nof vehicular taxes. The Traffic Police is in charge\r\n\r\nof  traffic regulations and the testing of drivers.\r\n\r\nThe  Car  Parks Division is in charge of car  parks\r\n\r\nand  taxi stations. But this division is under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of National Development. This triumvirate\r\n\r\nset-up will necessarily give rise to confusion  and\r\n\r\nwill  affect the efficiency of the public transport\r\n\r\nservice.  The three departments should  be  unified\r\n\r\ninto  one  in  order to do away with the  confusion\r\n\r\nobtaining at the moment in the various departments.\r\n\r\nI  feel that all matters relating to transport  and\r\n\r\ncommunications should be under the Ministry of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunications. Not very long ago  I  suggested  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  that  these  departments  should  be\r\n\r\nmerged  into one and the Minister took a favourable\r\n\r\nview  of my suggestion. Now I will repeat here that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister should merge together all the various\r\n\r\ndepartments   which  now  deal  with   the   public\r\n\r\ntransport  service. Hence, the R.O.V., the  Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice,  the  Car  Parks  Division  and  the   road\r\n\r\nbuilding  section should come under one department.\r\n\r\nUnder  a  unified management, a unified  policy  on\r\n\r\npublic transport will not only be achieved but,  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, it can also better cope  with  the\r\n\r\nproblem of public transport in our country. We  can\r\n\r\nachieve a double result with less effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the increase in taxis, I feel that the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Communications should  lay  out  more\r\n\r\nparking  lots for them in order to enable the  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers   to   pick   up  their   passengers   more\r\n\r\nconveniently. I also feel that all car parks should\r\n\r\nbe open to taxis as well. This will enable the taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  to take their lunch or to rest  there.  At\r\n\r\nthe  moment, foreign imported cars and other  kinds\r\n\r\nof  vehicles  can park in the car parks.  Only  the\r\n\r\ntaxis   cannot.  What  is  the  reason   for   this\r\n\r\ndiscrimination? If the taxis are allowed to park in\r\n\r\nthe  car  parks, they are prepared to  pay  parking\r\n\r\nfees. After all, they are also local citizens.  Why\r\n\r\nshould   there   be  discrimination  against   taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers? It is really difficult to comprehend  this\r\n\r\nsituation.  I  hope  the  Minister  will,  in   the\r\n\r\nreorganisation  of  the public  transport  service,\r\n\r\ntake   the   necessary  measures  to  remedy   this\r\n\r\nunreasonable situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, the various proposals enumerated in\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper not only create a new task for the\r\n\r\npeople in the transport industry but they also pose\r\n\r\na  new challenge to all the people. They will  have\r\n\r\nto  adapt  themselves to the new situation  brought\r\n\r\nabout   by  this  reorganisation.  Of  course,   to\r\n\r\nreorganise in tow the public transport service is a\r\n\r\nvery  onerous task. However, I believe  that  under\r\n\r\nthe  spirited  and  experienced leadership  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Communications, the programme will  be\r\n\r\nsmoothly carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, like to remind the Minister of\r\n\r\nseveral points. First, the reorganisation should be\r\n\r\ncarried  out  with the utmost care, and sympathetic\r\n\r\nconsideration should be given to the livelihood and\r\n\r\ndifficulties   of  the  people  affected   by   the\r\n\r\nreorganisation. The reorganisation should also  not\r\n\r\nadversely  affect the development of  our  commerce\r\n\r\nand  industry and the livelihood of the  people  in\r\n\r\nthe transport industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, there is the attitude of\r\n\r\nGovernment  servants. Recently, I received  certain\r\n\r\ncomplaints  about  the  discourteous  and  arrogant\r\n\r\nattitude of public servants towards members of  the\r\n\r\npublic.  If  this is true, I urge the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nlook  into  this  problem and see to  it  that  the\r\n\r\nofficers    concerned   carry   out   their    work\r\n\r\nefficiently. Public officers should understand that\r\n\r\nthey  are servants of the people and their salaries\r\n\r\ncome  from the taxes paid by the people. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthey  should  serve  the people  courteously.  They\r\n\r\nshould  not  abuse  their powers and  embarrass  or\r\n\r\noppress  the  people, especially now  that  we  are\r\n\r\ncarrying  out a large-scale reorganisation  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  transport service. Public  servants  should\r\n\r\nmaintain  a fair and just attitude in carrying  out\r\n\r\ntheir   duties.  Only  thus  can  this  large-scale\r\n\r\nexercise  receive the full support and co-operation\r\n\r\nof  the  people, and the objectives  of  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper achieved, so that in the 1970s we can have  a\r\n\r\ncompletely  new  and  efficient  system  of  public\r\n\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.16 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the\r\n\r\npublication  of the White Paper, quite considerable\r\n\r\npublic  interest  and concern  have  been  aroused.\r\n\r\nApart  from the proposed age limits of the  various\r\n\r\ntypes of vehicles, two other areas have caused most\r\n\r\nconcern. One of these is the all-out action against\r\n\r\nthe  pirate  taxis  and  the  other  is  the  total\r\n\r\nabolition  of  SCH taxis. Whilst it may  be  argued\r\n\r\nthat  it is not the duty of the law to protect  the\r\n\r\nillegal,  one cannot help but sympathise  with  the\r\n\r\nplight   of  those  who  have  been  compelled   by\r\n\r\ncircumstances to resort to pirating  on  the  road.\r\n\r\nThese so-called pirates, I submit, Sir, have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  the  by-products of our own  restrictive  and\r\n\r\nunrealistic  taxi licensing system  and  a  totally\r\n\r\ninefficient  public  transport  system  which   has\r\n\r\nfailed  miserably  to cater for the  needs  of  the\r\n\r\ntravelling  public and, as a result, has encouraged\r\n\r\nthe  growth of the pirates. Now that the ills  have\r\n\r\nbeen  diagnosed  and the cures prescribed,  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  we  should not ignore altogether  the  useful\r\n\r\nalbeit  illegitimate,  contribution  made  by   the\r\n\r\npirates and the legitimate contribution from  those\r\n\r\noperating  SCH  taxis.  Accordingly.  I  feel  that\r\n\r\ncertain  special arrangements ought to be  made  to\r\n\r\ncommence  registration of all those who  have  been\r\n\r\nengaged  in  pirating and in the operation  of  SCH\r\n\r\ntaxis   with  a  view  to  finding  them   suitable\r\n\r\nalternative employment opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Member for Sembawang, I am concerned,\r\n\r\nSir,  about  the  fate of the 2,200  goods-carrying\r\n\r\nvehicles  which  are more than 15 years  old.  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhilst  a grace period will be allowed in the  case\r\n\r\nof  other  vehicles that are to be  phased  out  on\r\n\r\naccount  of age, there is no indication as  to  how\r\n\r\nthe 2,200 overage goods-carrying vehicles are to be\r\n\r\nphased out. There is no recommendation anywhere  in\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper. Sir, I do hope that this does not\r\n\r\nsuggest immediate replacement and that a reasonable\r\n\r\ngrace  period  will  be allowed  during  which  the\r\n\r\nvehicles should preferably be submitted to  regular\r\n\r\nstringent inspection by the authorities in view  of\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  these vehicles  are  the  greatest\r\n\r\noffenders  on  the road in terms of air  pollution.\r\n\r\nWhatever the grace period finally decided upon,  it\r\n\r\nshould  be sufficiently long to allow for  adequate\r\n\r\nreplacement so as not to disrupt our commercial and\r\n\r\nindustrial activities. The tremendous expansion  in\r\n\r\nboth   sectors,  I  understand,  has   considerably\r\n\r\nincreased the demand for lorry service. Calculating\r\n\r\non  the  basis of an average price of  $20,000  per\r\n\r\nlorry - although some lorries may cost a lot more a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  $44 million is required to  finance  the\r\n\r\nreplacement  of  our  complete  fleet  of   overage\r\n\r\nlorries.  Bearing in mind that a  great  number  of\r\n\r\nthese lorries are owned by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindividuals of no substantial means, I am  doubtful\r\n\r\nwhether   they  will  be  able  to  find   adequate\r\n\r\nfinancial   support   to   effect   the   necessary\r\n\r\nreplacement within a short period. I feel sure that\r\n\r\nthis  point  has not escaped the attention  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  and that the programme drawn up to  phase\r\n\r\nout   these   goods-carrying   vehicles   will   be\r\n\r\nreasonable  and sufficiently flexible to  ensure  a\r\n\r\nsmooth change-over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, I would like to touch upon\r\n\r\nthe proposed merger of the 10 Chinese bus companies\r\n\r\nand  the establishment of three separate companies.\r\n\r\nSir,  the  ultimate  success of  the  comprehensive\r\n\r\nchanges  proposed  for the entire public  transport\r\n\r\nsystem hinges largely upon the successful operation\r\n\r\nof  the three new companies. Their performance will\r\n\r\ntherefore be watched most closely by all concerned.\r\n\r\nAnd  as it must be the first occasion locally where\r\n\r\na  fairly large number of companies go into  merger\r\n\r\ntogether, their success will inspire others both in\r\n\r\ncommerce   and   industry  to   undertake   similar\r\n\r\nexercises  in  order  to  obtain  the  benefits  of\r\n\r\neconomies  of  scale. I sincerely hope,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthat in structuring the management of the three new\r\n\r\ncompanies,  those  concerned at the  top  will  not\r\n\r\nhesitate to introduce modern management techniques.\r\n\r\nIn particular, it is important that they appreciate\r\n\r\nand accept the need for professional managership to\r\n\r\nensure efficiency in management.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a sound management without the co-operation\r\n\r\nof   the  workers  will  however  not  give  us  an\r\n\r\nefficient  bus  service. And  as  far  as  this  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,   I   have-no  doubt  that   our   union\r\n\r\ncolleagues  will see to it that union  members  are\r\n\r\nmade  to realise their responsibility to the public\r\n\r\nand   will  co-operate  to  the  utmost  with   the\r\n\r\nmanagement  in  bringing  about  an  efficient  bus\r\n\r\nservice to the people of Singapore. Speaking of the\r\n\r\nunion,   Sir,  I  am  reminded  that  the  proposed\r\n\r\nTransport   Co-operative  will  be  given   certain\r\n\r\nprivileges and will therefore be playing  a  fairly\r\n\r\nimportant  part  in  helping  to  bring  about  the\r\n\r\nchanges   envisaged.  As  such,  they   should   be\r\n\r\norganisationally   prepared   and   competent    to\r\n\r\nundertake\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  task  ahead.  May  I  ask  the  Minister  what\r\n\r\narrangements or preparations are being made by  the\r\n\r\nunion in this connection?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.23 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Phua Bah Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications (Mr Phua Bah Lee)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, since our independence, owing  to\r\n\r\nthe  growth of our economy and the increase in  the\r\n\r\nindices  of  income  of  our  nationals,  the  high\r\n\r\npurchasing   power  of  the  people  has   directly\r\n\r\nstimulated   the   prosperity  of   our   transport\r\n\r\nindustry. Therefore, more effective control of  the\r\n\r\nincreasing number of motor vehicles has become  our\r\n\r\npressing task at the moment. Certain parts  of  the\r\n\r\nregulations and laws are no longer adequate to meet\r\n\r\nthe  present  transport conditions.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand, in order to match urban renewal, there is the\r\n\r\nneed   systematically  to  link  up   the   various\r\n\r\nsatellite  towns, industrial districts and  housing\r\n\r\nestates.   This  entails  the  reorganisation   and\r\n\r\nreadjustment  of  the public transport  service.  I\r\n\r\nquote paragraph 1.1 of the White Paper:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Good and efficient communications form the life-blood of any modern economy. As Singapore takes\r\n\r\njustifiable pride in being the fourth busiest  port\r\n\r\nof  the world, we must not allow its progress to be\r\n\r\nretarded by a lagging Public Transport system.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This correctly explains the important position  the\r\n\r\npublic  transport industry occupies in our national\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the White Paper proposes certain\r\n\r\nmeasures which will not only help solve the present\r\n\r\nproblem of public transportation, but also, at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  serve  as guiding principles  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture  in  this  field.  From  the  ratio  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation  to  vehicles, it can be seen  that  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of our people are making use of buses  as\r\n\r\ntheir  chief means of communication. But what  kind\r\n\r\nof  service is now being rendered by the present 11\r\n\r\nbus  companies to our people? There are buses  from\r\n\r\nthree  or  four bus companies running on  the  same\r\n\r\nservice routes, whereas on other service routes the\r\n\r\npassengers  have to wait for a solid half  an  hour\r\n\r\nbefore a bus comes along.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there is an inadequate number of\r\n\r\nvehicles  whose  service  is  irregular   and   not\r\n\r\npunctual,   causing   long   queues   of    waiting\r\n\r\npassengers.  We can read many complaints  from  the\r\n\r\npublic   in   the  newspapers  about  this.   This,\r\n\r\ntherefore, has indirectly helped the development of\r\n\r\npirate taxis. Bus companies and taxi operators have\r\n\r\ncomplained   about  pirate  taxis   robbing   their\r\n\r\nbusiness.  But  they  themselves  will   not   take\r\n\r\npositive  steps to improve their own services.  The\r\n\r\ncause  of this situation lies in the fact that  the\r\n\r\n11  bus  companies lack a unified organisation  and\r\n\r\nmanagement and they do not show the common sense of\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  They  manage  their  own   affairs\r\n\r\nseparately  and  their business is based  on  their\r\n\r\npersonal  interest.  As for the  safety,  time  and\r\n\r\nconvenience   of  passengers,  it  is   not   their\r\n\r\nbusiness.  Thus, on the one hand, they  are  making\r\n\r\nuse  of  overage  vehicles to extract  the  maximum\r\n\r\npossible  profit, and, on the other hand, they  are\r\n\r\ncausing  unnecessary  waste  by  duplicating  their\r\n\r\nservices along some service routes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this situation, the Government\r\n\r\nproposes  to reorganise the 11 bus companies.  This\r\n\r\nhas become an important subject in the White Paper.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  proposes  to  amalgamate  the   10\r\n\r\nChinese  bus  companies  into  three  district   or\r\n\r\nregional  companies.  It  also  proposes  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Traction Company should also  reorganise\r\n\r\nand  readjust itself and be turned into the  fourth\r\n\r\ndistrict company so that, through division of  work\r\n\r\nand co-operation, the various bus routes throughout\r\n\r\nour  country will form a complete link-up. Thus  in\r\n\r\nthe  fields of management and service, it  will  be\r\n\r\neasier  to  adjust, rectify and  organise.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment, the 10 Chinese bus companies have completed\r\n\r\ntheir  initial  stages of amalgamation.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthis  exercise  will soon be completed.  I  welcome\r\n\r\nvery  much  the  judicious  decision  and  the  co-operation of the Chinese bus companies to help  the\r\n\r\nGovernment carry out this reorganisation plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next come taxis which occupy the second position\r\n\r\nin  our  public transport service. According  to  a\r\n\r\nconservative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassessment, the total intake for taxis  every  year\r\n\r\nis  not less than that for buses. From this we  can\r\n\r\nsee  that  the profit for taxis is quite  high.  At\r\n\r\npresent, the number of taxi licences is limited  to\r\n\r\n3,800. This limitation has become fatal to the taxi\r\n\r\nindustry,   because   it  has   not   only   caused\r\n\r\nspeculators to hoard taxi licences by various means\r\n\r\nin  order  to fetch better prices on selling  them,\r\n\r\nbut  also,  at  the  same time, it  has  indirectly\r\n\r\nfostered   the   development   of   pirate   taxis.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in order to remove the anomalies that at\r\n\r\npresent exist with the taxis, we should assess  the\r\n\r\nservices rendered by them and adjust their number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we come to the school taxis and pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis.  First,  the school taxis. They  are  pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis  in  a  different form. The main  reason  for\r\n\r\ntheir  existence is the poor bus service,  and  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  school buses are not  widely  used.  In\r\n\r\norder to ensure the safety of school children,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment decided to legalise such \"pirate\"  taxis\r\n\r\nin  the  past. In this way school taxis  have  come\r\n\r\ninto  being. They are marked differently  with  SCH\r\n\r\nplates  and  have to pay S24 a year in addition  to\r\n\r\nthe  fee  paid by private cars. However, they  make\r\n\r\nuse  of this legal cover illegally to accept  fares\r\n\r\nalong  the  road, Their practice is to  take  other\r\n\r\npassengers in addition to school children. This  is\r\n\r\nagainst  the  original intention of the  Government\r\n\r\nwhen  it legalised this kind of taxis. The SCH taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers   themselves   have  also   infringed   the\r\n\r\nprinciples and the conditions under which they were\r\n\r\nregistered.  Therefore,  the  Government   has   no\r\n\r\nalternative but to take strict measures to  replace\r\n\r\nthem with school buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pirate taxis pose a serious problem in our public\r\n\r\ntransport service. The operators are infringing the\r\n\r\nlaw  by accepting fares along the road. Even  their\r\n\r\ncar discs are secured through illegal means. At the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  they are using overage  cars  in  poor\r\n\r\ncondition  to serve the passengers. What they  want\r\n\r\nis  only to get fares from the passengers. They  do\r\n\r\nnot care for their safety. It has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshown that the passengers of pirate taxis who  lost\r\n\r\ntheir  lives as a result of accidents did  not  get\r\n\r\nany   compensation.  This  is  very  pitiful.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment allows free competition in commerce, but\r\n\r\npirate taxi operators and school taxi operators are\r\n\r\nengaged in unequal competition. The Government  has\r\n\r\na duty to protect the interest of taxpayers just as\r\n\r\nit  has  the  duty to take measures to protect  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of legitimate businessmen from smugglers.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  has tried its  best  to  eradicate\r\n\r\npirate  taxis, but the anomalies and ills  existing\r\n\r\nin  the public transport service plus the fact that\r\n\r\npeople  want a quicker and more convenient  service\r\n\r\nhave   created   favourable  conditions   for   the\r\n\r\nexistence of the pirate taxis. Their operators make\r\n\r\nuse  of  this need as a pretext for their legality.\r\n\r\nif  we legalise pirate taxis, the existence and the\r\n\r\nservice  rendered by buses and ordinary taxis  will\r\n\r\nbecome  meaningless.  Also,  public  transport  and\r\n\r\norder  on  the  road will become  unmanageable  and\r\n\r\nchaotic.  The eradication of pirate taxis not  only\r\n\r\nensures   the  safety  of  passengers,   but   also\r\n\r\nsafeguards  the  rights of people who  are  legally\r\n\r\noperating buses and taxis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards anti-air pollution, this is a problem\r\n\r\nthat we will have to face seriously in view of  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  the anti-air pollution  campaign.\r\n\r\nAll  engines  emit some kind of waste  gases  which\r\n\r\nwill  directly  affect the health of human  beings.\r\n\r\nThis   matter   does   not   have   any   political\r\n\r\nimplications. Whoever you are, your health will not\r\n\r\nbe  less  affected  by the air  pollution,  In  our\r\n\r\ncountry,  air  pollution  is  caused  less  by  the\r\n\r\nexisting new factories than by the exhaust of motor\r\n\r\nvehicles. In busy commercial districts and  densely\r\n\r\npopulated  areas,  the  problem  is  more   serious\r\n\r\nbecause  the  smoke emitted by motor  vehicles  has\r\n\r\neven impeded the growth of trees and plants. We can\r\n\r\ntherefore  gauge the degree of its seriousness.  In\r\n\r\nthe final analysis, the cause of this situation  is\r\n\r\nmainly due to diesel cars. Not all cars emit  black\r\n\r\nsmoke. Of the diesel cars, the worst offenders  are\r\n\r\npublic transport vehicles and overage vehicles.  In\r\n\r\nthe case of the former, for example,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuses  and lorries, the cause is excessive loading.\r\n\r\nIn  the  case of the latter, it is their  unlimited\r\n\r\nperiod  of use. The latter include pirate  and  SCH\r\n\r\ntaxis, taxis, and some other vehicles. The emission\r\n\r\nof  black smoke is obviously due to lack of  proper\r\n\r\nmaintenance. This should be attended to. To control\r\n\r\nthis  situation,  we  have stipulated  that  public\r\n\r\ntransport  vehicles  should be inspected  regularly\r\n\r\nand  should  keep up to the required standards.  We\r\n\r\nwill  also  raise the tax on private  diesel  cars,\r\n\r\nwhich include SCH cars. On the one hand, this is to\r\n\r\ndiscourage  the purchase of diesel cars as  private\r\n\r\ncars.  On  the  other hand, this  is  to  curb  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of pirate taxis as well  as  keep  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of diesel vehicles to a minimum. The  fines\r\n\r\non  vehicles emitting smoke will also be increased.\r\n\r\nThis  will  make  car owners pay attention  to  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of their vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, all laws and stipulations should be\r\n\r\neffectively carried out by executive organisations.\r\n\r\nWithout  them,  there will be no  achievement.  The\r\n\r\nefficiency of the Registry of Vehicles is not up to\r\n\r\nthe  required  standard. The  R.O.V, is  weak  and\r\n\r\nineffective.   Many  tasks  properly   within   the\r\n\r\nprovince  of the R.O.V, have not been carried  out.\r\n\r\nSome  other  departments are carrying out  some  of\r\n\r\nthese  tasks. Even some minor tasks are not carried\r\n\r\nout.  In this way, the authority of the R.O.V, does\r\n\r\nnot go beyond its threshold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the R.O.V, there is a lot of confusion and\r\n\r\ninefficiency. This is mainly due to a  shortage  of\r\n\r\nstaff  and  equipment.  In order  that  the  R.O.V.\r\n\r\nshould play an effective role, we should strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  staffing  position and also give  it  adequate\r\n\r\nauthority  and  equipment. Only  thus  will  it  be\r\n\r\npossible   to   help  in  the  reorganisation   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment   of  the  public  transport   service.\r\n\r\nJudging  from  the  above, we  can  arrive  at  one\r\n\r\nconclusion;  that is to legislate and, through  the\r\n\r\nexecutive  bodies, to implement the  reorganisation\r\n\r\nof  the  public transport service. The  results  of\r\n\r\nthis will, of course, be:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Better organisation and more regular working\r\n\r\nconditions for those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  engaged  in  the public transport  service.\r\n\r\nThis will provide more jobs for our citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) After the reorganisation, more vehicles will\r\n\r\nbe needed for the transport service, thus providing\r\n\r\nmore   investment  opportunities  in   the   public\r\n\r\ntransport  service which, in turn, will generate  a\r\n\r\nnew   source   of   strength   for   our   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Improvement in our environmental hygiene and\r\n\r\nthe  safeguard of our health will be an  undeniable\r\n\r\nfact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) A better, more direct and time-saving public\r\n\r\ntransport  service  for the  broad  masses  of  our\r\n\r\npeople will emerge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nin  recent  years the public transport  service  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  posed  a very serious  problem.  In\r\n\r\norder  to  solve it and to ensure that there  is  a\r\n\r\nsmooth flow of traffic in our streets in Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  set up a  Transport  Advisory\r\n\r\nBoard  for a comprehensive survey and study of  the\r\n\r\ntransport service system in Singapore. The  efforts\r\n\r\nof this Board have culminated in the White Paper on\r\n\r\nthe  Reorganisation of the Motor Transport  Service\r\n\r\nin Singapore. From the aims and views of this White\r\n\r\nPaper,  we  all agree that the premises  have  been\r\n\r\nwell established and most encouraging and worthy of\r\n\r\nour  support.  On the one hand, the proposals  will\r\n\r\nensure  that traffic will flow freely and  smoothly\r\n\r\nin Singapore so that it does not become a hindrance\r\n\r\nto  our  economic development and progress. On  the\r\n\r\nother hand, the proposals will also ensure that the\r\n\r\npublic  will be given a time-saving and  convenient\r\n\r\nmeans of transport to move around. Indirectly,  the\r\n\r\nproposals  will  ensure control  of  air  pollution\r\n\r\ncaused  by  public transport vehicles.  There  are,\r\n\r\nhowever,  certain provisions which are  either  too\r\n\r\nstrict  or far from being perfect. These  will  not\r\n\r\nonly  affect those who are involved, but will  also\r\n\r\ncause  the  people  affected  to  make  unnecessary\r\n\r\nsacrifices. Therefore, careful consideration should\r\n\r\nbe given to see that proper adjustments are made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to deal with the\r\n\r\nquestion of school taxis. Some four years ago,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  in view of the growing  problem  of\r\n\r\npirate  taxis in Singapore and the fact that pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis   do   play  an  important  role  in   public\r\n\r\ntransport,  the Government decided to issue  school\r\n\r\ntaxi  licences for these vehicles in order to  make\r\n\r\ngood  the inadequacies of transport for our  school\r\n\r\nchildren.  Accordingly a lot of people applied  for\r\n\r\nthese licences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From statistics released by the R.O.V, in June\r\n\r\nthis  year,  of the various classes  and  types  of\r\n\r\nvehicles  registered, there are 1,127 school  taxis\r\n\r\nand school buses, the majority of them being school\r\n\r\ntaxis.  This figure is more than double the  number\r\n\r\nof  buses  owned by the Singapore Traction Company.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it can be seen that so long as there are\r\n\r\nsolutions,  popular  support  is  certain.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  we  cannot simply write off  the  licences\r\n\r\nthat  were  issued four years ago and  require  the\r\n\r\nlicence  holders  to  switch  over  to  mini  buses\r\n\r\novernight, or within the time of 11 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain illogical restrictions\r\n\r\nmentioned  in the White Paper. For example,  school\r\n\r\ntaxis  are not to be transferred. At the time  when\r\n\r\nthese  licences were issued, the applicants had  to\r\n\r\ngo  round  raising  money to  buy  their  vehicles,\r\n\r\ndiesel cars for example. And up to now many of them\r\n\r\nhave still not yet paid up their loans. But now the\r\n\r\nGovernment  require them to raise another  loan  to\r\n\r\nbuy  a  new mini bus. The previous loan not  having\r\n\r\nbeen  fully paid up, who in their right senses will\r\n\r\nlend  more money to these people? Furthermore,  the\r\n\r\nexisting  school  taxis will  be  given  the  death\r\n\r\nsentence because of the increase in diesel tax. Who\r\n\r\nwill buy diesel vehicles for private use?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the passengers of school taxis are mainly school children. Because there is a limit to the fares from school children, school taxi drivers are only able to make enough money to keep body and soul together, quite apart from having to maintain their vehicles. Little did they\r\n\r\nrealise in the early days\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat,  by the 1st of December this year, they would\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay 50 per cent more in diesel  tax,  and\r\n\r\nanother  50 per cent by the 1st of July next  year.\r\n\r\nThis increase in diesel tax will undoubtedly be  an\r\n\r\nunbearable  burden on them. This-is quite  a  cruel\r\n\r\nand heartless measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the question of pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis.  The  existence of pirate taxis  is  a  fait\r\n\r\naccompli.   The  Government  has  been  continually\r\n\r\ntaking action against them. But I think that in the\r\n\r\ncourse of such action they have adopted a policy of\r\n\r\nclosing  one  eye to it. This-could not  be  denied\r\n\r\nbecause  we can see that over the years the  public\r\n\r\ntransport  system in Singapore has worsened.  There\r\n\r\nhave been complaints about the inadequacies and the\r\n\r\nchaotic  state  of public transport.  And  what  is\r\n\r\npreposterous  is the claim by a bus company,  which\r\n\r\noperates in busy city areas, that it is running  at\r\n\r\na  great  loss, to the tune-of millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nAnd  this  claim is made at a time when many,  many\r\n\r\npassengers have to queue up for a long time for its\r\n\r\nbuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These inadequacies and the unsatisfactory state\r\n\r\nof  affairs  give rise to the existence  of  pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis.  To some extent, these pirate taxis help  to\r\n\r\nsolve-the   transport  problem  of   commuters   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  people  have  been  served   quite\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily  by  these pirate  taxis  which  ply\r\n\r\nbetween  housing  estates and  industrial  estates.\r\n\r\nRain  or  shine, the people get the  services  they\r\n\r\nneed  at very moderate rates of fares. Judging from\r\n\r\nthe  present  situation, buses do get  crowded  and\r\n\r\noverflow  with passengers at some time.  There  are\r\n\r\npeople who are not prepared to wait for a long time\r\n\r\nfor buses during the rush hours. So they take taxis\r\n\r\nor  pirate  taxis  which normally  operate  between\r\n\r\nhousing  estates  and industrial estates.  Although\r\n\r\nthe fare of pirate-taxis is slightly more than that\r\n\r\nfor a bus, that is to say, a difference of 5 or  10\r\n\r\ncents,   on  the  whole,  pirate  taxis  play   the\r\n\r\nintermediary  role  between  taxis  and  buses   in\r\n\r\nserving  the  need of passengers. So while  we  are\r\n\r\ndiversifying our public transport system,  I  think\r\n\r\nthere is room for the pirate taxis. Plans\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  proper control can be executed to legalise the\r\n\r\nexistence  of  pirate  taxis,  which  are  a   fait\r\n\r\naccompli. Operators or drivers of pirate taxis  and\r\n\r\nschool  taxis  have taken loans  at  high  interest\r\n\r\nrates  to  buy their diesel vehicles  in  order  to\r\n\r\nprovide  this  wonderful service to people  in  all\r\n\r\nwalks of life. They have to sweat and toil to  earn\r\n\r\ntheir living and to look after their families. Over\r\n\r\nthe years of operation, they have gained experience\r\n\r\nand know their business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conscionable people have full sympathy for this\r\n\r\nkind  of  illegal operation. Why cannot we  try  to\r\n\r\nhelp  them  solve  their  problem?  Why  cannot  we\r\n\r\ndiscuss with them to find a proper solution? It  is\r\n\r\nregrettable that this is not being done. And to  do\r\n\r\naway with all this illegal operation by persecution\r\n\r\nand  police action will not solve the problem.  The\r\n\r\nmore  you arrest them, the more you will find  them\r\n\r\non  the road. And if you take stricter action,  you\r\n\r\nwill  probably drive them to desperation, and  that\r\n\r\nwill  lead  to  unthinkable  social  problems   and\r\n\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, my view that certain routes\r\n\r\nshould  be  designated for the operation  of  these\r\n\r\npirate  taxis,  so  as to give  the  operators  and\r\n\r\ndrivers  a  means of livelihood. This will  be  the\r\n\r\nbest  method. Alternatively, we can classify pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis  as  second-class taxis.  I  think  they  are\r\n\r\nprepared to talk things over, and are also prepared\r\n\r\nto  accept all reasonable arrangements that we  can\r\n\r\nsuggest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, next I would like to deal with taxis. In the White Paper the Government has decided to issue 1,200 new taxi licences. At the moment, there are about 14,000 taxi drivers to 5,000 taxis. This ratio, I think, is a comfortable one, and taxi drivers do not have to worry about\r\n\r\nhaving  no  taxis  to  drive.  They  will  not   be\r\n\r\nunemployed   in  view  of  the  number   of   taxis\r\n\r\navailable. Undoubtedly this decision is  good  news\r\n\r\nfor many taxi drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately the White Paper also proposes to\r\n\r\nimpose an age limit of seven years for taxis.  This\r\n\r\nmeans that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  taxi  has  to be replaced every seven  years.  I\r\n\r\nthink this is a waste of money. If we assume that a\r\n\r\nnew taxi costs $12,000 and the money is obtained by\r\n\r\nway  of a loan at the rate of, say, 10 per cent per\r\n\r\nannum,  the  interest  will amount  to  $1,200  per\r\n\r\nannum,  capital  and interest to be payable  within\r\n\r\nseven  years.  This  means  that  every  month  the\r\n\r\ninstalment will come to more than $200, quite apart\r\n\r\nfrom  expenses on maintenance, road tax, insurance,\r\n\r\nand  other incidentals. With all these items  taken\r\n\r\ninto  account, every month a sum of more than  $300\r\n\r\nwill  be  involved. And if after  seven  years  the\r\n\r\nvehicle  is still in good and serviceable condition\r\n\r\nand  yet  has to be replaced, will that  not  be  a\r\n\r\nloss?  If  the vehicle is -to be sold as a  private\r\n\r\ncar,  I  think  very few people will be  interested\r\n\r\nbecause  of the increased tax on diesel  cars.  Why\r\n\r\ncannot  we extend the age limit of taxis? By  doing\r\n\r\nso  we can, on the one hand, save a lot of money in\r\n\r\nforeign exchange for the country, and, on the other\r\n\r\nhand,  we will enable the taxi operators to earn  a\r\n\r\nfew  dollars more, so that they will be in a better\r\n\r\nposition to buy a new vehicle the next time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also stated in the White Paper that because\r\n\r\na  taxi  is put to hard use, it is on the  run  for\r\n\r\nalmost  24  hours in two shifts. I  think  this  is\r\n\r\npurely  guesswork.  As far as we  understand,  most\r\n\r\ntaxis  do  not run about in the streets after  1.00\r\n\r\na.m.  They are all parked in petrol kiosks or  such\r\n\r\nother  places  until at least 6.00  a.m, or  later\r\n\r\nbefore  they are on the road again. And during  the\r\n\r\nperiod  when  they are supposed to be in  use,  the\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers also take time off for rest.  You  do\r\n\r\nnot expect them to keep on driving for 12 hours  on\r\n\r\nend. It is, therefore, clear that the actual time a\r\n\r\ntaxi is being used is between 12 and 15 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of buses which are to serve the same\r\n\r\npurpose,  an  age  limit of 17  years  is  proposed\r\n\r\nwithout any good reason being given. Why cannot the\r\n\r\nage of a taxi be about half that set for a bus?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is clear that the public transport service of Singapore is in a very serious state. While we agree to the proposals in the White Paper for a comprehensive reorganisation, the Minister for Communications should emulate the Housing and Development Board, which has\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  solved the housing  problem,  in  the\r\n\r\nsolution of the public transport problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.02 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, permit me\r\n\r\nto  comment  on certain points emanating  from  the\r\n\r\nstatement by the Minister for Communications on the\r\n\r\nsubject   of  the  reorganisation  of   the   motor\r\n\r\ntransport service of Singapore consequent upon  the\r\n\r\npresentation  of the White Paper to  Parliament  on\r\n\r\n21st July, 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst agreeing that the broad outline of the\r\n\r\nprinciples   in   the   White   Paper   is    sound\r\n\r\ntheoretically,  I do not think certain  details  of\r\n\r\nthe  plan  are near enough to what I would  call  a\r\n\r\nrealistic approach. The Minister for Communications\r\n\r\nhas  emphasised,  as one of the guiding  principles\r\n\r\nunder  which the White Paper is drawn up,  that  it\r\n\r\nwould be a simple yet workable plan and capable  of\r\n\r\nimmediate  implementation. But from what  I  gather\r\n\r\nfrom  the existing condition in our motor transport\r\n\r\nsystem,  I  would rather say that the dimension  of\r\n\r\nthe  problem is far greater than what the  plan  is\r\n\r\nable  to  solve and certain proposed steps  do  not\r\n\r\ndeal realistically with the existing problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper aims at weeding out all pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis within a period of one year, and in order  to\r\n\r\ntake the full brunt of the unemployment problem due\r\n\r\nto this measure, it has proposed to create over the\r\n\r\nnext   three   years  not  less  than   6,500   job\r\n\r\nopportunities  under the plan. If my estimation  is\r\n\r\nnot  wrong,  there  are  at least  7,000  to  8.000\r\n\r\ngenuine  pirate taxi drivers in Singapore.  When  I\r\n\r\nsay  genuine drivers, I mean those whose livelihood\r\n\r\ndepends\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsolely  on driving pirate taxis. I understand  that\r\n\r\nthere are some drivers who drive pirate taxis  only\r\n\r\npart-time. The question now is this. How  can  this\r\n\r\ntremendously large number of drivers,  whose  means\r\n\r\nof earning their livelihood is suddenly terminated,\r\n\r\nfind  alternative employment? The White  Paper  has\r\n\r\nproposed to create 4,150 job opportunities  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  year of the plan. In respect of numbers,  it\r\n\r\nwill  not  solve the problem. It will be  worse  in\r\n\r\nterms of vocation and the suitability of these  men\r\n\r\nto fit into new jobs. These men who have spent many\r\n\r\nyears behind the steering wheel will be faced  with\r\n\r\ndifficulty   in  getting  adapted  to   their   new\r\n\r\nemployment. Does the White Paper include a training\r\n\r\nprogramme  for these people similar to  that  which\r\n\r\nthe  Naval Base workers are now undergoing?  Whilst\r\n\r\nwe  all  believe in the benefits of a  law-abiding,\r\n\r\ndisciplined, tightly-knit and organised society, we\r\n\r\nmust  not  achieve  this object by non-humanitarian\r\n\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to raise is with\r\n\r\nregard   to  taxis.  Anyone  with  some  power   of\r\n\r\nobservation  can  easily see that the  increase  of\r\n\r\n1,200  taxis, of which 200 will be special  tourist\r\n\r\ntaxis,  is  far  too small a number to  offset  the\r\n\r\nshortage in our public transport system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imposition of the age limit for taxis at\r\n\r\nseven  years appears to me to be too short a period\r\n\r\nto  be  justified economically. Any taxi owner  can\r\n\r\ntell you that running a taxi at, present is not  as\r\n\r\nprofitable a business as it is thought to be,  with\r\n\r\nthe  present high rate of road tax to be paid every\r\n\r\nyear and owners having to spend a considerable  sum\r\n\r\nof  money  on  repair  bills in  order  that  their\r\n\r\nvehicles  can pass the inspection of the  Registrar\r\n\r\nof  Vehicles. If every owner has to make  plans  to\r\n\r\nreplace his vehicle every seven years, he will find\r\n\r\nthat  it  will be unprofitable to run  a  taxi  any\r\n\r\nmore. In order to continue his business he may have\r\n\r\nto  demand  extremely high charges from the  driver\r\n\r\nwho hires his taxi. The final result is that it  is\r\n\r\nthe  public who ultimately pays the bill. If  every\r\n\r\ntaxi has to undergo a mechanical inspection at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Registry of Vehicles annually and  has  to  be\r\n\r\nproved  serviceable and safe. I do not see  why  an\r\n\r\nunrealistic  age  limit should be  set  for  taxis.\r\n\r\nAfter  all, even a three-year old vehicle  can  be\r\n\r\nfound  unserviceable if the owner does not properly\r\n\r\nmaintain  and service it. I would like  to  propose\r\n\r\nthat  this  age  limit  be  lengthened  to  a  more\r\n\r\nrealistic period and that the mechanical inspection\r\n\r\nof  public  transport vehicles at the  Registry  of\r\n\r\nVehicles be strictly enforced. In this way, I think\r\n\r\nwe will come nearer to a more realistic approach to\r\n\r\nensure that the public transport vehicles are  safe\r\n\r\nfor use and that they are economically feasible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Communications has already pointed out that these measures will affect the livelihood of a few thousand people. Owing to their wide social and economic repercussions, we would like him to give more careful thought and consideration before\r\n\r\nimplementing them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as there are\r\n\r\nquite  a number of other Members who wish to  speak\r\n\r\non the White Paper, may I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business under\r\n\r\nconsideration  be  exempted at this  day's  sitting\r\n\r\nfrom the provisions of Standing Order No. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business under\r\n\r\nconsideration  be  exempted at this  day's  sitting\r\n\r\nfrom the provisions of Standing Order No. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>REORGANISATION OF MOTOR</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TRANSPORT SERVICE OF</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

I do not think anyone can quarrel\r\n\r\nwith   this  objective.  This  principle  is  quite\r\n\r\nirrefutable.   But   some   of   the   details   of\r\n\r\nimplementation leave room for some comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In discussing this matter with some of my\r\n\r\nconstituents  one  feature  that  seems  to   evoke\r\n\r\nobjection  is  the  age  limit  to  be  imposed  on\r\n\r\nvehicles. That there is some public consensus  with\r\n\r\nregard to this has been indicated by the number  of\r\n\r\ntimes  this  matter has been adverted to  by  other\r\n\r\nMembers in, this House. Many people are of the view\r\n\r\nthat  the road reliability of a vehicle depends  as\r\n\r\nmuch  on  how  it is used and looked  after  as  on\r\n\r\nsimply  its age. It could be agreed that  we  would\r\n\r\nlike  to encourage owners and the drivers of public\r\n\r\nservice  vehicles  to  keep  their  vehicles  in  a\r\n\r\nconstant  condition of roadworthiness.  This  being\r\n\r\nso,  stress should be laid on periodical inspection\r\n\r\nof  vehicles  on  the basis of reasonably  exacting\r\n\r\nstandards.  Therefore,  if  vehicles  fulfil  these\r\n\r\nstandards, it may be possible to extend  their  age\r\n\r\nlimit  to  the  number  of years,  where  relevant,\r\n\r\noriginally  recommended by the  Transport  Advisory\r\n\r\nBoard.  In  other words, it would  be  possible  to\r\n\r\nextend  the  lease of life of vehicles  beyond  the\r\n\r\nlimit  decided upon by the White Paper  up  to  the\r\n\r\nlimit  recommended by the Transport Advisory Board,\r\n\r\nprovided  that  such  vehicles  pass  the  required\r\n\r\ninspection  test.  I wonder if the  Minister  would\r\n\r\ndeem  it feasible to have a lower and an upper  age\r\n\r\nlimit  for  vehicles,  a lower  limit  after  which\r\n\r\ninspection  is more stringent, and an  upper  limit\r\n\r\nbeyond which the type of vehicle concerned will not\r\n\r\nbe allowed to operate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to refer to is the\r\n\r\nposition  of  school and pirate taxi drivers.  This\r\n\r\nagain  is another matter that has been referred  to\r\n\r\nfrequently in debate. Whatever the moral strictures-one  may  level  at the pirate taxi drivers,  they,\r\n\r\ntogether with the school taxi drivers, still pose a\r\n\r\nsocial  problem.  We  note in  the  White  Paper  a\r\n\r\ncomment that those associated with pirate taxi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noperations  are  well  advised!  to  contemplate  a\r\n\r\nmeaningful  change  of occupation.  May  I  add  my\r\n\r\nappeal to that of the Member for Jalan Kayu and the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson that it might  be  possible  for\r\n\r\nadditional help, counselling and registration to be\r\n\r\ngiven  to such people so that they may be relocated\r\n\r\nto useful occupations?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find the White Paper's reference to \"the\r\n\r\nRepublic's   aim   of  building  a   law   abiding,\r\n\r\ndisciplined, tightly knit and organised society for\r\n\r\nSingapore\"  most gratifying indeed. I think  it  is\r\n\r\nessential  to  link this concept  with  traffic  on\r\n\r\nSingapore roads. I would like to emphasise  a  view\r\n\r\nthat  has been expressed in this House before, that\r\n\r\nseemingly the highways in Singapore constitute  the\r\n\r\nlast  bastion of a buccaneering disregard  for  the\r\n\r\nlaw. This disregard is not confined to pirate taxis\r\n\r\n-   the  highways  generally  remaining  the   last\r\n\r\nstronghold  of  indiscipline,  disorganisation  and\r\n\r\nindifference to others. May I express the hope that\r\n\r\nthe  problem  of  the standard of driving  will  be\r\n\r\nattended   to  with  due  regard  being  given   to\r\n\r\nenforcement  of the rules of the road.  It  may  be\r\n\r\nuseful if this White Paper is followed by a no less\r\n\r\nsignificant declaration really to clean up  traffic\r\n\r\nconditions   resulting  from  a  low  standard   of\r\n\r\ndriving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.14 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker.

I would like  give  two\r\n\r\nreasons  for  the  abolition of these  taxi  stops.\r\n\r\nFirst, it would only inconvenience\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npassengers  if  they are to alight at  these  stops\r\n\r\nwhen  they are carrying large sums of money to  and\r\n\r\nfrom  banks.  Similarly, it would cause unnecessary\r\n\r\ninconvenience to the old, young and  the  sick  and\r\n\r\nalso  to  those who carry bulky parcels.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nthe  system is bound to cause confusion to tourists\r\n\r\nwho visit our country for the first time. Sir, taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  are from time to time asked to  give  good\r\n\r\nservice  to the tourists. I submit that  taxis  are\r\n\r\nnot the only vehicles which cause congestion on the\r\n\r\nstreets. Privately-owned vehicles equally create  a\r\n\r\nnuisance  by picking up and discharging  passengers\r\n\r\nat places convenient to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in page 19 of the White Paper, paragraph\r\n\r\n6.12   concerns  the  age  limit  for   taxis.   My\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Member for Sembawang, has taken  the\r\n\r\ntrouble  to go through the memorandum of  the  Taxi\r\n\r\nTransport  Association and I wish to support  their\r\n\r\nclaim  that  the  age  limit  of  taxis  should  be\r\n\r\nextended to 10 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister to clarify another\r\n\r\npoint. What will happen to the licence of an  owner\r\n\r\ntaxi  driver who dies or has passed the  retirement\r\n\r\nage?  Can  the licence be passed on to the next-of-kin  so  as  to  ensure that no disruption  in  the\r\n\r\nfamily's livelihood takes place?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope that the above suggestions and queries will be considered and answered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.18 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, with urban development and the growth\r\n\r\nof  population, it is quite natural that  transport\r\n\r\nwill  become an attendant problem. Big  cities  all\r\n\r\nover  the  world  face transport problems  of  this\r\n\r\nnature.  We  all  know  that transportation  is  an\r\n\r\nessential factor in our daily routine. Everyone has\r\n\r\nto  travel  daily.  So the earlier  we  solve  this\r\n\r\ntransport problem, the better it is for our people.\r\n\r\nIt means that they will be able to enjoy the fruits\r\n\r\nof  a  comprehensive  and well-organised  transport\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the problems facing Singapore at\r\n\r\nthe moment as a big city are quite natural.  As early as \r\n\r\nten years ago when the Government started  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplanning  for urban renewal, adequate thinking  was\r\n\r\nnot given to the question of transport. That is the\r\n\r\nreason  why  we have traffic jams at  present.  The\r\n\r\ntransport  service  is  not  satisfactory.   Public\r\n\r\ntransport  is inadequate and this has  led  to  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  pirate  taxis. This  situation  is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  an  anomaly and should be  rectified.  The\r\n\r\nbold  and  far-sighted Minister for  Communications\r\n\r\npresented  to  this  House a  White  Paper  on  the\r\n\r\nReorganisation  of the Motor Transport  Service  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  last month. The White Paper  shows  that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Communications is  determined  to\r\n\r\noverhaul the public transport system within a short\r\n\r\nperiod of three years so that a lot of time will be\r\n\r\nsaved  for  the  public.  The  intentions  and  the\r\n\r\ndetermination of the Minister are praiseworthy.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,   the  present  transport  system   is   an\r\n\r\naccumulation  of  past ills and a  continuation  of\r\n\r\npast   maladministration.  The  reorganisation   is\r\n\r\ntherefore timely and necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this plan of reorganisation, I am afraid that\r\n\r\nthe  people  who will be greatly affected  are  the\r\n\r\n5,000  pirate and school taxi drivers. If  each  of\r\n\r\nthem has to support four persons, then about 20,000\r\n\r\npeople  will be affected by the reorganisation.  On\r\n\r\nthe other hand, the White Paper also shows that  in\r\n\r\nthe    reorganisation,   about   6,500   new    job\r\n\r\nopportunities will be created. On the face  of  it,\r\n\r\nit  is not difficult for the pirate taxi drivers to\r\n\r\nswitch  employment,  but there are  other  problems\r\n\r\nwhich  require consideration and solution. Sir,  it\r\n\r\nis  a fact that pirate taxis have been in existence\r\n\r\nfor  more than a decade. This shows that they serve\r\n\r\na  public  need and that there is value  for  their\r\n\r\nexistence. All these years, pirate taxis have  been\r\n\r\nproviding  an  essential transport service  to  our\r\n\r\npeople,  particularly the middle, and  lower-middle\r\n\r\nclasses. The fares they charge are reasonable. They\r\n\r\ntake  our workers to factories and offices, and  in\r\n\r\nthe newly-developed housing estates, they perform a\r\n\r\nvery important service. In new housing estates,  it\r\n\r\ntakes  time  before  buses can operate.  So  pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis  provide the only reasonable and  cheap  form\r\n\r\nof transport for the estate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresidents.  Furthermore,  they  have  also  made  a\r\n\r\nvaluable  contribution to our city  and  industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   Take,   for  example,   the   Jurong\r\n\r\nindustrial town. In the early days, there  were  no\r\n\r\nbuses  and  there  were very  few  factories  which\r\n\r\nprovided  transport for their workers.  The  pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis  were  the  only means of transport  for  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  It  is undeniable that they have  made  a\r\n\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper says that after July next year\r\n\r\npirate taxis will not be allowed on the roads. What\r\n\r\nwill  happen  to the 5,000 pirate and  school  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers? The employment and livelihood problems  of\r\n\r\nthese  people should receive priority consideration\r\n\r\nof our popularly elected Government. Sir, all human\r\n\r\nbeings have their own dignity and self-respect.  If\r\n\r\nthere are other ways out, they will not take to  an\r\n\r\noccupation  which  is  considered  illegal.  So  in\r\n\r\nhandling  the pirate taxi problem, the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunications  must not only look into  the  legal\r\n\r\naspect  but also the humanitarian aspect. Tolerance\r\n\r\nis  the key word to a problem of this nature.  When\r\n\r\nour  country  is  prospering, we must  ensure  that\r\n\r\neverybody has a share in the prosperity. We do  not\r\n\r\nwish to see part of our population living below the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  the majority of the  people.  We  are\r\n\r\npractising democracy and our Government is  elected\r\n\r\nby  the people. So the livelihood of the people  is\r\n\r\nthe   responsibility  and  the  obligation  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I propose that the Ministry of Communications should set up a special committee for the conversion of the employment of pirate and school taxi drivers. All these problems are worthy of consideration. The people concerned should not just be written off. This is not the way for an\r\n\r\nelected  government  to do  things.  We  must  take\r\n\r\npositive  steps and adopt a positive  attitude  and\r\n\r\nregard   pirate  taxi  drivers  as  part   of   our\r\n\r\ncitizenry.  So for the conversion of the employment\r\n\r\nof  pirate and school taxi drivers, I think we  can\r\n\r\ngive  them special priority for the application  of\r\n\r\nlegal taxi licences or bus drivers' licences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister for Communications will\r\n\r\ngive consideration to my proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.26 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to make some observations on the proposals set\r\n\r\nout in the White Paper on the Reorganisation of the\r\n\r\nMotor  Transport Service of Singapore as  contained\r\n\r\nin Paper Cmd. 21 of 1970 and for which the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Communications  has moved  this  Motion.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthough  I share many of the views expressed  by  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues,  the Backbenchers, however,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nagree with quite a number of them. The question  of\r\n\r\npublic  transportation  is indeed  a  very  complex\r\n\r\nproblem  and, therefore, this White Paper  is  most\r\n\r\nwelcome and a move in the right direction if we are\r\n\r\nto have a more meaningful and more efficient public\r\n\r\ntransport service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I refer to bus services? I think the\r\n\r\namalgamation  of the 10 Chinese bus companies  into\r\n\r\nthree regional groupings is a correct move, because\r\n\r\nmany  of these bus companies have a fleet of  buses\r\n\r\nranging  from  slightly more than 10 to  more  than\r\n\r\n100,  and they ply along a multiplicity of  routes.\r\n\r\nSo  I hope this amalgamation will not duplicate the\r\n\r\nroutes, as I note that such routes will have to  be\r\n\r\nrearranged.  I  feel there should  be  several  bus\r\n\r\ntermini  in  the  city at which the  commuters  can\r\n\r\ncatch a bus home. In other words, those buses going\r\n\r\nto  the  city  will  have their  terminus  at  such\r\n\r\ntermini.  This, Sir, I believe, will help  to  ease\r\n\r\ntraffic  congestion during the peak hours, although\r\n\r\nI  admit that this may entail some inconvenience to\r\n\r\nthose commuters who have to rely on the buses. This\r\n\r\nis   a  possibility  into  which  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunications can look, because I have  seen  such\r\n\r\narrangements  carried  out  quite  successfully  in\r\n\r\nseveral European countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the increase in the bus fleet from\r\n\r\nthe  present number of 1,339 to 2,000  by  1973,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincrease  will not be sufficient to meet the  needs\r\n\r\nby  1973, because the number of commuters will have\r\n\r\nincreased  by  then. Therefore,  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that there be a yearly assessment  of  the\r\n\r\nimmediate  needs rather than that  an  estimate  be\r\n\r\nmade  of how many buses will be needed in the  next\r\n\r\nthree  years. I think it is quite necessary to  set\r\n\r\nup  a  Road  Transport Authority, as  mentioned  in\r\n\r\nparagraph  13.3  (g)  on page  30  of  the  Report.\r\n\r\nParagraph 13.3 (g) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Omnibus Services Licensing Authority\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  1956  is  to  be  amended  to  give  it\r\n\r\nadditional  and wider powers like a Road  Transport\r\n\r\nAuthority so that the reorganisation of our  Public\r\n\r\nTransport service can be a success.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  fully  agree  with  this,  Sir,  and  hope  this\r\n\r\nAuthority,  when  set up, will provide  the  public\r\n\r\nwith an efficient public transport service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the chapter in the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper that deals with Mini School Buses. This\r\n\r\nis  on page 16, paragraph 5.5. I would like to seek\r\n\r\nclarification  from the Minister for Communications\r\n\r\non  the  type  of such buses and how many  students\r\n\r\neach  can  carry. I bring up this point  because  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that the scrapping of SCH taxis, which have\r\n\r\nbeen  carrying children to and from school,  is  an\r\n\r\nunwise move. As far as I know, these SCH taxis have\r\n\r\nbeen  per, forming a social service for  the  many\r\n\r\nparents  whose children are in the primary schools.\r\n\r\nThese  children  cannot, like the secondary  school\r\n\r\nstudents, queue up for the buses. Therefore, it  is\r\n\r\nonly  right  that such mini buses replace  the  SCH\r\n\r\ntaxis.  In  other words, the holders  of  SCH  taxi\r\n\r\nlicences and drivers be given the priority to  own,\r\n\r\nand  be  encouraged to own, mini buses  instead  of\r\n\r\nletting  the bus companies operate both the  school\r\n\r\nbuses and the mini school buses. Whilst I agree  to\r\n\r\nthe scrapping of the SCH taxis, I would like to see\r\n\r\nthat they be replaced by mini school buses, because\r\n\r\nthe  mini  school buses will be able to carry  more\r\n\r\nchildren  than  the  ordinary SCH  taxis.  This,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  will be most welcome to the many  parents\r\n\r\nwho have to rely on SCH taxis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the subject of pirate taxis. It is\r\n\r\ninteresting to note from the White Paper that  \"the\r\n\r\nmajority  of the 6,800 private diesel vehicles  are\r\n\r\nbelieved to be operating as `Pirate' taxis.\" It  is\r\n\r\nalso  pointed out in paragraph 7.8 that \"all  those\r\n\r\nnow associated with `Pirate' taxi operations for  a\r\n\r\nliving are well advised to contemplate a meaningful\r\n\r\nchange of occupation, over the next eleven months .\r\n\r\n. .\". I must repeat this, that I share the views of\r\n\r\nseveral  Members  on this matter.  Although  it  is\r\n\r\nstated  in  paragraph 7.7 that there  will  be  job\r\n\r\nopportunities numbering no less than 6,500, I  fail\r\n\r\nto  see the point that before 1st July, 1971, these\r\n\r\npirate  taxis  would have to be off the  road,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  the operators would have to rehabilitate\r\n\r\nthemselves  in  a  much more meaningful  change  of\r\n\r\noccupation,  because it cannot be denied  that  the\r\n\r\nprojection  of  6,500 jobs to be  created  will  be\r\n\r\nspread over three years, and in 11 months more than\r\n\r\n5,000  illegal operators will be off the road.  How\r\n\r\ndoes  one equate the two? In this instance, I would\r\n\r\nbe most grateful if the Minister for Communications\r\n\r\nwould care to clarify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some other points to be considered. One\r\n\r\nis  that if these pirate taxi drivers should choose\r\n\r\nto become bus drivers or lorry drivers, and if they\r\n\r\ndo  not  possess the necessary licence to  drive  a\r\n\r\nheavier  class  of  vehicles, they  would  have  to\r\n\r\nundergo and pass that examination. Should they wish\r\n\r\nto apply for a taxi driver's licence, they ought to\r\n\r\nbe  successful in the application. Here I am  happy\r\n\r\nto  note  that  the White Paper clearly  sees  that\r\n\r\n\"there  is no reason why licences for taxi  drivers\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  freely  issued  hereafter  to  any\r\n\r\ncitizen who is competent and able enough to qualify\r\n\r\nfor  such licence.\" But even if such issuance  were\r\n\r\nto  be  relaxed,  I  believe it  would  undoubtedly\r\n\r\nincrease  the number of taxi drivers.  Here  again,\r\n\r\nanother  problem will be faced, and that is whether\r\n\r\nor  not we will have sufficient taxis for them.  It\r\n\r\nis noted that the number of taxis will be increased\r\n\r\nfrom  the present fleet of 3,800 to 5,000.  Of  the\r\n\r\n1,200  taxi  licences  to be issued,  200  will  be\r\n\r\nreserved for special taxis. I do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink  this  number of 1,000 taxi  licences  to  be\r\n\r\nissued  to  the  N.T.U.C.'s Transport  Co-operative\r\n\r\nwill be adequate to meet the needs, since 5,000  or\r\n\r\nmore  pirate  taxis will have to be  off  the  road\r\n\r\nbefore 1st July, 1971, and if they decide to switch\r\n\r\nto  the  occupations which I mentioned just now.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to refer the Minister for Communications\r\n\r\nto  the  statement  he made in this  House  on  9th\r\n\r\nApril,  1969. This was in reply to the question  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Bukit Panjang, who is not here. The\r\n\r\nMinister agreed \"that pirate taxis, though  running\r\n\r\nillegally, are performing a form of social function\r\n\r\nin   providing  an  element  of  public   transport\r\n\r\nservice.\"  This is contained in Hansard,  Vol.  28,\r\n\r\nNo.  12, col. 940. Sir, I think his Ministry should\r\n\r\nassist in the rehabilitation of pirate taxi drivers\r\n\r\nin  this respect. But let me hasten to add, lest  I\r\n\r\nbe misconstrued as being mischievous by quoting the\r\n\r\nreply out of context, that I wish to reiterate that\r\n\r\nI  am firm in my view, because the Minister further\r\n\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As the adequacy and efficiency of the public\r\n\r\ntransport  services  improve,  there  should  be  a\r\n\r\nconsequent  decrease in the number of pirate  taxis\r\n\r\nrunning on the road.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In my view, Sir, the position has not changed since\r\n\r\nthen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the stipulation that the taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers'  age  limit be 60 years with  a  grace  of\r\n\r\nthree  years, I would make a humble request to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to consider extending it to  65.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nmake this request because I have been approached by\r\n\r\nsome  elderly taxi drivers who have pointed out  to\r\n\r\nme  that  they have large families and  that  their\r\n\r\nchildren  are either in school or are  not  earning\r\n\r\nenough   to  help  maintain  their  families,   and\r\n\r\ntherefore,  they drive taxis in order to supplement\r\n\r\ntheir  income. I earnestly hope that  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill  sympathetically consider  my  request.  These\r\n\r\ndrivers  have  also emphasised that if  they  could\r\n\r\nafford it, they would not want to work beyond  that\r\n\r\nage,   but   it  is  because  of  their   financial\r\n\r\ncircumstances  that they have to  continue  driving\r\n\r\ntaxis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several of my colleagues have made the point that\r\n\r\nthe  age limit for taxis should be set at ten years\r\n\r\nas recommended by the Transport Advisory Board, the\r\n\r\nChairman of which is the Parliamentary Secretary to\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Communications. Instead, the White\r\n\r\nPaper  has accepted the recommendation of the  1966\r\n\r\nCommittee  of Review, i.e., that the age  limit  be\r\n\r\nset  at  seven years. Sir, I just wish to know  the\r\n\r\ncriterion  behind this decision,  and  perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister can enlighten this House on how the figure\r\n\r\n\"7\"  has  been  decided upon. Sir, I am  told  that\r\n\r\nseven  years is an insufficient period  to  recover\r\n\r\nthe   high  costs  involved  in  buying   a   taxi,\r\n\r\nmaintaining  it, paying due taxes, etc.  The  limit\r\n\r\nneed to be extended to ten years, which would be  a\r\n\r\nsufficient period, so that by the eleventh  year  a\r\n\r\nnew  taxi  could  be purchased.  Otherwise  in  the\r\n\r\neighth  year  a new taxi may probably  have  to  be\r\n\r\nacquired  through hire purchase. Sir, I am positive\r\n\r\nthat  some transport associations have made written\r\n\r\nrepresentations to the Minister on this matter, and\r\n\r\nI  can  only  hope that he will carefully  consider\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noted that the age limit for public service\r\n\r\nbuses   and  school  buses  is  17  and  20   years\r\n\r\nrespectively.  It is perfectly pertinent  to  point\r\n\r\nout  here that the statement \"subject to change  of\r\n\r\nengine  every five years\" in respect of such  buses\r\n\r\nis,  I  think, ambiguous.

He has mentioned  that\r\n\r\nfor  a bus service to be efficient, there must  not\r\n\r\nonly be sound professional management but also  the\r\n\r\nco-operation  of  the  bus workers.  I  would  have\r\n\r\nthought  that  to improve the bus  service  and  to\r\n\r\nincrease the comfort of the travelling public it is\r\n\r\nnot  only  necessary to have sound management  with\r\n\r\nthe  full  co-operation of labour, but that  it  is\r\n\r\nalso important that the travelling public should co-operate by showing more orderly behaviour, such  as\r\n\r\nqueueing up for a bus and not scrambling for places\r\n\r\nin   the   bus  when  it  stops  at  the  terminus,\r\n\r\nparticularly during peak hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the co-operation and conduct of\r\n\r\nworkers  necessary  to  ensure  an  efficient   bus\r\n\r\nservice, the Member for Jalan Kayu can rest assured\r\n\r\nthat  the N.T.U.C, is always conscious of its  role\r\n\r\nto  exhort  the  bus  workers to demonstrate  their\r\n\r\ncourtesy to the travelling public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon.

As I have mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier this evening, any plan of reorganisation is\r\n\r\nsomewhat  disturbing because it  upsets  people  in\r\n\r\ntheir  usual  way  of  life. But  the  business  of\r\n\r\ngovernment  is  to  govern, not  harshly  but  with\r\n\r\nfirmness and reasonableness, and many Members  have\r\n\r\nindicated that we should also be sympathetic. I see\r\n\r\nno  reason  why in the reorganisation consideration\r\n\r\nshould  not  be given to problems which  may  arise\r\n\r\ntherefrom  or which may not have been  foreseen  in\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper. I think .a man must be a fool  if\r\n\r\nhe  thinks  he has the answers to all the problems.\r\n\r\nBut it was necessary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto table this White Paper to make it known  to\r\n\r\nall  and sundry that something at last is going  to\r\n\r\nbe done about road transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall attempt, to the best of my ability, to cover all the points that have been raised today by no less than 11 Members. I shall follow the order in which the points have appeared in the White Paper, beginning with the bus service, and followed by a discussion of the other subjects.\r\n\r\nI  think  it  is useful to touch, first,  upon  the\r\n\r\npoint  raised by the Member for Jalan Kayu when  he\r\n\r\nsaid that he welcomed the proposed amalgamation  of\r\n\r\nthe  10  Chinese bus companies into three companies\r\n\r\nas  a  step  in  the  right direction  for  merging\r\n\r\nsmaller  companies  into  larger  units,  and   the\r\n\r\nimportance    of   introducing   modem   management\r\n\r\ntechnique.  He ended up with the hope that  similar\r\n\r\ncontributions would come from the workers,  a  hope\r\n\r\nto  which  the  Member for Moulmein responded  very\r\n\r\nwell.  We  do have to get the co-operation  of  the\r\n\r\nmanagement,  labour  and  members  of  the  public,\r\n\r\nbecause  in any change of system or reorganisation,\r\n\r\nthere will be some upset here and there during  the\r\n\r\ntransition period, but with a little give and take,\r\n\r\nan  understanding of the larger interests, and  the\r\n\r\nability to withstand certain inconveniences  for  a\r\n\r\ntime, all will ultimately enjoy the benefits  of  a\r\n\r\nmuch improved public transport service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on to the Member for Punggol's comment\r\n\r\non   the  establishment  of  more  bus  termini  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. May I draw his attention to page  11  of\r\n\r\nthe   White  Paper,  paragraph  4.5  Study  to   be\r\n\r\nconducted  on co-ordination and rationalisation  of\r\n\r\nbus routes. The White Paper has been tabled for one\r\n\r\nmonth  now. There is a paragraph which says that  a\r\n\r\n\"transport consultant has been appointed . . , with\r\n\r\nthe  following terms of reference: -\". If  he  will\r\n\r\nlook at sub-paragraph (f) , this is one of his terms\r\n\r\nof reference:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Determine locations and number of bus terminus\r\n\r\nreported;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> On a point of clarification,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> The terminus I referred to is\r\n\r\none   where  all  buses  would  forgather  and  all\r\n\r\ncommuters would go to that place.

I hope that clarifies  my\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Both the Member for Punggol\r\n\r\nand  I  are laymen. I think we can leave it to  the\r\n\r\nexperts  to  suggest  how  we  can  implement   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations. What I wanted to say was that this\r\n\r\npoint   has  not  been  forgotten.  It   is   being\r\n\r\nconsidered,  and when the report is  available,  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  tabled for discussion, if necessary.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Punggol then dwelt upon the  necessity\r\n\r\nfor  the  establishment of  a  road  authority.  He\r\n\r\nreferred  in  this case to page 30, paragraph  13.3\r\n\r\n(g) :\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Omnibus Services Licensing Authority\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  1956  is  to  be  amended  to  give  it\r\n\r\nadditional  and wider powers like a Road  Transport\r\n\r\nAuthority so that the reorganisation of our  Public\r\n\r\nTransport service can be a success.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Work is going on in the Ministry to suggest various\r\n\r\namendments  to the legislation and a Bill  will  be\r\n\r\nforthcoming before this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member enquired further whether a change of\r\n\r\nengine  for  a bus every five years as required  in\r\n\r\nparagraph  3.9 (e) meant a new engine.  The  answer\r\n\r\nis,  of course, yes. I believe that covers most  of\r\n\r\nthe points on the bus services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now come to taxis which seem to have been\r\n\r\ngiven  considerable attention. The point  that  has\r\n\r\ngenerated considerable interest, as I can  see,  is\r\n\r\nthe  imposition of the age limit for taxis at seven\r\n\r\nyears.  First of all, I would like to reply to  the\r\n\r\ncomment by the Member for Whampoa when he said that\r\n\r\nit  would be fair to pass the cost of paying  close\r\n\r\nattention to air pollution to the public by raising\r\n\r\ntaxi  fares.  I  think we should be  very  hesitant\r\n\r\nabout raising fares, because it will, in turn, mean\r\n\r\na\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrise  in  the cost of living all round. We actually\r\n\r\ndid  that when we increased the taxi fare  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  mile from 40 to 60 cents on the 1st of July.\r\n\r\nI  think that is about as far as we can go  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment.  A  good  many  Members  the  Members   for\r\n\r\nSembawang, Paya Lebar, Anson, Punggol, and Katong -\r\n\r\nall say that this limit of seven years seems to  be\r\n\r\nsomewhat hard. They suggest, why not go back to  10\r\n\r\nyears  as  recommended  by the  Transport  Advisory\r\n\r\nBoard?  As  the Transport Advisory Board  has  done\r\n\r\nvery  good  work and has assisted me in  this  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  task  of trying to put the  Ministry  in\r\n\r\ngood  shape, I would be very hesitant not to accept\r\n\r\nits  recommendation  in this respect.  But  if  the\r\n\r\nMembers  will be good enough to refer  to  page  8,\r\n\r\nparagraph 3.9 of the White Paper, I have given  the\r\n\r\nreason  why  we  have put the age  limit  at  seven\r\n\r\nyears,  although the Transport Advisory  Board  did\r\n\r\nrecommend ten years for the life of a taxi. The sub-paragraph reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As TAB's [Transport Advisory Board's]\r\n\r\nrecommendations were made one month before the Anti-pollution  campaign  was  launched  by  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  it will be necessary to make adjustments\r\n\r\nto  the recommendations of TAB in order to meet the\r\n\r\nhigher  standards  of performance  and  maintenance\r\n\r\ndemanded under the Anti-pollution campaign. It  has\r\n\r\ntherefore  been  decided that TAB's recommendations\r\n\r\nbe accepted with.variations: --`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Why  seven years? There was already a committee  as\r\n\r\nfar back as 1966 which recommended that the life of\r\n\r\na  taxi  should be seven years. We are  already  in\r\n\r\n1970.  I think we should have the courage to accept\r\n\r\nthe  recommendation of four years  ago  that  seven\r\n\r\nyears  is adequate. In fact, if we go back to 1959,\r\n\r\nno  taxis which were more than five years old  were\r\n\r\nallowed  on  the  road.  So  there  is  already   a\r\n\r\nconcession made to taxi owners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the economics of it, I will just give\r\n\r\na  simple arithmetical calculation to show  whether\r\n\r\nthe  owners of taxis are really made to pay such  a\r\n\r\nheavy  price  to  replace their taxis  after  seven\r\n\r\nyears. I believe it is generally accepted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat a taxi is let out on hire for about $25 a  day\r\n\r\n- one morning shift and one night shift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> It is about $22.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Let us say $25 for easier\r\n\r\ncalculation,  otherwise it might be  a  little  bit\r\n\r\ndifficult. If it is $25 a day, then for one year  -\r\n\r\nlet us say, instead of 365 days it is 350 days - it\r\n\r\nmeans that if my calculation is correct, it will be\r\n\r\n$8,750. In other words, the capital cost of a  taxi\r\n\r\nis  recovered in one year and the owner is  allowed\r\n\r\nto use it for seven years. I do not think I need go\r\n\r\nany further on that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, it is just common sense that the older\r\n\r\nthe  vehicle, the more the repair bill, and it will\r\n\r\nnot be worth while having an old taxi that will not\r\n\r\nbe  on  the road earning money but in the workshop,\r\n\r\nand  the  owner  has to pay $400 or  $500  for  the\r\n\r\nrepair bill. It is cheaper to sell it and get a new\r\n\r\nvehicle  and  earn money. I am afraid Members  have\r\n\r\nforgotten the economics of the proposition and have\r\n\r\nnot checked the calculations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on now to the special tourist taxis. I\r\n\r\nbelieve the Member for Sembawang has suggested that\r\n\r\nthe  200 taxis should not be farmed out but  should\r\n\r\ngo  to  the N.T.U.C.'s Transport Co-operative.  The\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C, will  have its hands full  looking  after\r\n\r\n1,000 taxis. So it is better to allow the other 200\r\n\r\ntaxis  to be let out on tender. May I say that  the\r\n\r\nspecial  tourist taxis will be of a more  luxurious\r\n\r\ntype, air-conditioned, bigger in size, with a 2,000\r\n\r\nc.c, engine,  and probably costing not  less  than\r\n\r\n$10,000  per taxi. Fifty of these taxis  will  cost\r\n\r\nhalf a million dollars and 200 taxis will be a cool\r\n\r\n$2 million investment, so much so that we are going\r\n\r\nto put them out to tender in four separate lots.  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  not so easy to have half  a  million\r\n\r\ndollars  invested in 50 taxis at one time. I  think\r\n\r\nthe  allocation of 1,000 taxis to the  N.T.U.C, is\r\n\r\nenough to keep them busy for some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the age limit for taxi drivers at 60\r\n\r\nyears,  if  the  Member  will  refer  to  page  19,\r\n\r\nparagraph   6.10   of   the   White   Paper,    the\r\n\r\nrecommendation of the Transport Advisory  Board  is\r\n\r\nto  introduce an age limit for taxi drivers  at  60\r\n\r\nyears with a grace period of three years, and  this\r\n\r\nhas  been accepted by me. I think it is a bit  hard\r\n\r\nfor  me to reject this recommendation. Members like\r\n\r\nme  to accept what the Transport Advisory Board has\r\n\r\nsuggested. This is one of the recommendations  that\r\n\r\nit  has suggested and now that I have accepted  it,\r\n\r\nthey  say it is not good enough. I prefer to  stick\r\n\r\nto what is in the White Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has made the suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  taxis should be allowed to use car  parks.  I\r\n\r\nsee no reason why they should not be allowed if the\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers pay for it. Of course, a taxi  driver\r\n\r\ncannot just go to a public car park, parks his taxi\r\n\r\nfor  free, and goes for his meal. But if  he  parks\r\n\r\nhis taxi in the public car park and is prepared  to\r\n\r\npay  the regular 20 or 40 cents, I personally think -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> They are not allowed to do\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I will look into this matter.\r\n\r\nI  cannot  see  the  logic of  it.

In this respect, of course, it\r\n\r\nis  true  that  the  Car Parks  Division  is  in  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  Ministry, and I will have to seek  their\r\n\r\nco-operation to agree to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now answer the question why it is not in\r\n\r\nmy   Ministry  as  proposed  by  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nSembawang. He said that the Traffic Police and  the\r\n\r\nCar  Parks  Division  should also  come  under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Communications. That is the prerogative\r\n\r\nof  the Prime Minister. I am only the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommunications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu asked about the\r\n\r\nprogress of the N.T.U.C.'s\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransport  Co-operative. I  think  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nMoulmein  has  answered him adequately.  Since  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Moulmein has spoken  on  it,  I  shall\r\n\r\nproceed with other matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Changi has raised the question of taxi stops. This is a pilot scheme and, like reorganisation, there are inconveniences arising from it. People are not accustomed to stopping at certain designated places. It is a little upsetting. Originally, it\r\n\r\nwas  intended  to  operate this scheme  along  four\r\n\r\nstreets. This is stated in page 19, paragraph  6.11\r\n\r\nof the White Paper:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n          `(a)    Cecil Street.\r\n\r\n           (b)    Raffles Place.\r\n\r\n           (c)    Robinson Road.\r\n\r\n           (d)    Shenton Way.'\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nSince  then the scheme has been extended to another\r\n\r\nthree streets, i.e., Collyer Quay, Raffles Quay and\r\n\r\nFinlayson  Green. There are, in all, 16 taxi  stops\r\n\r\nin seven streets. It is a matter of opinion whether\r\n\r\nor  not  this  scheme is a success. Those  who  are\r\n\r\ninconvenienced will say that it is not  a  success.\r\n\r\nBut  many people have said that it is a jolly  good\r\n\r\nidea.  They  know  where to get  a  taxi.  Because,\r\n\r\nbelieve  it  or  not, there are some  taxi  drivers\r\n\r\noperating  in  Raffles  Place  who  have  made  our\r\n\r\ncitizens angry. They just cruise around looking for\r\n\r\nforeign  tourists  and  refuse  to  take  our   own\r\n\r\ncitizens  who are prepared to pay for it.  Now  the\r\n\r\npeople  can stand at a taxi stop and jump into  any\r\n\r\ntaxi that comes along. I think it is time that taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers who refuse to take fares and, instead, look\r\n\r\nfor  foreign visitors, should be pulled up and have\r\n\r\ntheir  licences  suspended.  I  have  given  strict\r\n\r\ninstructions  that this should be  followed.  So  I\r\n\r\nthink  this  pilot  scheme  should  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\noperate. Of course, the usual story will be,  \"What\r\n\r\nabout  those who are sick?\" Not every one is  sick.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot take individual cases and put them up as\r\n\r\nexamples. I have been assured by the Traffic Police\r\n\r\nthat if it is a sick person who is being taken by a\r\n\r\ntaxi  to  a dispensary, no action will be taken  by\r\n\r\nthem. Of course,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey will probably take down the number of the taxi\r\n\r\nconcerned,  and  if an explanation  is  given,  the\r\n\r\nincident  is  forgotten. That  assurance  has  been\r\n\r\ngiven  to  me. So I see no reason why,  because  of\r\n\r\nthat,  we  must  do away with taxi stops.  We  must\r\n\r\nthink of the whole and not of the part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards confusion caused to foreign tourists,\r\n\r\nI  do not think it is so. If they come from certain\r\n\r\ncountries  in Europe, this is their system.  It  is\r\n\r\ntime  that  we learned that what is being  done  in\r\n\r\nBritain  or  in the United States need not  be  all\r\n\r\nright  for  Singapore. There are many things  being\r\n\r\ndone   elsewhere,   not  in  the   English-speaking\r\n\r\ncountries, where wonderful ideas can be picked  up.\r\n\r\nWe, in Singapore, should learn from others if it is\r\n\r\na good point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the point of legalised taxis, in case the\r\n\r\nowner  of a taxi retires because of age, how  shall\r\n\r\nwe  deal  with  his  taxi  licence?  I  think  this\r\n\r\nquestion has caused worry to some people, and I  am\r\n\r\nprepared  to consider that the taxi licence  should\r\n\r\ncontinue  with the owner until he dies.  It  should\r\n\r\nnot  be part and parcel of, shall we say, the man's\r\n\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the real meat of the debate is on pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis.  I  think we have to be clear in  our  minds\r\n\r\nwhen  we  talk  about  this  subject  and  not  get\r\n\r\ninvolved  because of sob stories, sympathy  and  so\r\n\r\non.  First  of all, we must get down  to  the  root\r\n\r\ncause  of  this. Surely our approach to  the  whole\r\n\r\nproblem  is  that pirate taxis came into  operation\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  inadequacy of the  bus  services.\r\n\r\nSince  this is a White Paper produced to reorganise\r\n\r\nthe  public  transport service to improve  the  bus\r\n\r\nservices,  our approach should be, \"Yes, how  shall\r\n\r\nwe  go about it to improve the bus services so that\r\n\r\nthere will be less opportunity for the pirate  taxi\r\n\r\ndriver to operate?\" The approach should not  be  to\r\n\r\nlook  at  the  other side of the problem  and  say,\r\n\r\n\"Poor  fellows,  what shall we do with  them?\"  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Paya  Lebar even suggested  that  they\r\n\r\nshould  be  legalised and given special  routes  to\r\n\r\noperate. This is doing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njust  the  opposite. In other  words,  he  wants  a\r\n\r\ncontinuation  of  the present situation  by  giving\r\n\r\nthem the status of legality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  would like to clarify what I said just now. What\r\n\r\nI meant was that we should legalise pirate taxis so\r\n\r\nthat  the  pirate taxis drivers can  still  earn  a\r\n\r\nliving. For instance, the Speaker of the House  was\r\n\r\nan  adviser to the Singapore Ex-political Detainees\r\n\r\nAssociation which looks after the rehabilitation of\r\n\r\nits  members. The White Paper does not provide  for\r\n\r\nthe rehabilitation of pirate taxi drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, 6,500 jobs\r\n\r\nare  being created and pirate taxi drivers will  be\r\n\r\ngiven  an opportunity to take up these jobs. I  see\r\n\r\nno   reason  why  they  should  be  given   special\r\n\r\ntreatment. Here is the opportunity. Here is the way\r\n\r\nout.  Shall  I  put it this way in discussing  this\r\n\r\nproblem  without stirring up emotion?  Supposing  a\r\n\r\nman  gets  cheap cigarettes because they have  been\r\n\r\nsmuggled into Singapore without paying the tax.  Do\r\n\r\nyou  raise a hue and cry if the person who smuggled\r\n\r\nthem in is caught and sentenced? Or if the owner of\r\n\r\na car will not buy petrol from an authorised petrol\r\n\r\nkiosk  but pinches it from the British Army  -  the\r\n\r\npetrol  is blue in colour and he is caught,  fined,\r\n\r\nor  his  car  is confiscated. Do you speak  on  his\r\n\r\nbehalf? Do you pity him because he was only  trying\r\n\r\nto  get cheap petrol? Surely any responsible person\r\n\r\nwill say, \"Well, he asked for it; he got it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this reorganisation, the N.T.U.C, will be\r\n\r\nforming  a  co-operative. They welcome  the  pirate\r\n\r\ntaxi  operator  as a member of the co-operative.  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is $50 a share. Do you mean to say  that\r\n\r\nhis  taxi  is worth less than $50? If he  means  to\r\n\r\nchange,  he should join the co-operative.  Or  even\r\n\r\nthe  SCH  taxi  operators, if they really  want  to\r\n\r\nchange, it can be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bus companies themselves realise that they\r\n\r\nwill have to increase their bus fleet. According to\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper, it is not less than 300 new buses\r\n\r\neach year for the next three years. Each bus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  employ  five people. These bus  companies  are\r\n\r\nprepared to employ any pirate taxi operator or  SCH\r\n\r\ntaxi  driver interested in a legitimate job. So  we\r\n\r\nhave the N.T.U.C, and the bus owners coming forward\r\n\r\nto  say, \"Let us get together to make this  plan  a\r\n\r\nsuccess.\"  This is where I think the suggestion  of\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Jalan Kayu is a sound one.  We  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  register  them  if  they  will   come\r\n\r\nforward.  Not  many  people are  prepared  to  come\r\n\r\nforward   and  say,  \"Yes,  I  am  a  pirate   taxi\r\n\r\noperator.\"  I  hope the Member for Paya  Lebar  can\r\n\r\nassist  in  this  registration.  The  pirate   taxi\r\n\r\noperator should not just turn up and say that he is\r\n\r\na  pirate taxi operator. We want to have more facts\r\n\r\nthan  just  that.  I  am  prepared  to  conduct   a\r\n\r\nregistration campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a bus drivers' training school and are\r\n\r\nprepared  to increase the intake from 50 each  time\r\n\r\nto 150. It is a 5- to 6-week course. Bus companies,\r\n\r\ntoo,  cannot  get  qualified bus  drivers.  We  are\r\n\r\nprepared to step up the enrolment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the point raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nPunggol,  we  will step up the issue of  vocational\r\n\r\nlicences  for  those wishing to  switch  over  from\r\n\r\nillegitimate driving as pirate taxi operators or as\r\n\r\nSCH operators to legitimate employment. We will  do\r\n\r\nall  that. But we cannot concede and give them this\r\n\r\nand  give them that. Some Members say they are poor\r\n\r\nfellows. They are not poor. They may appear  to  be\r\n\r\npoor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol says that the plan is\r\n\r\noffering 6,500 jobs but that it is over a period of\r\n\r\nthree years. Therefore, we appear to be harsh if we\r\n\r\nask  the pirate taxi operators to stop in a  year's\r\n\r\ntime.  But  if the Member will look into the  White\r\n\r\nPaper again at page 23, 4,150 jobs are likely to be\r\n\r\ncreated in the first year. This is no small  number\r\n\r\nof  job opportunities. A good number of pirate taxi\r\n\r\noperators are doing it part-time and earning a  few\r\n\r\nextra  dollars.  But the number of people  who  are\r\n\r\nmaking a living out of it could very well be 4,000.\r\n\r\nI do not know. It has yet to be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of\r\n\r\nclarification.

It is most unfortunate, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthe  SCH  taxis  have got involved in  pirate  taxi\r\n\r\noperations.  They started off quite  well.  When  I\r\n\r\ntook  over the Ministry two years ago, some of them\r\n\r\ncame   to   see   me  because,  as  I   said,   the\r\n\r\nAssociation's  premises are in my constituency.  It\r\n\r\nwas  at the meet-the-people sessions that they came\r\n\r\nto  see  me and I was told that some SCH taxis  had\r\n\r\nbeen nabbed by the police and they asked whether  I\r\n\r\ncould  do  something for them. That was in November\r\n\r\n1968.  My  answer was, \"If the police have  already\r\n\r\nnabbed them, I am sorry I cannot do a thing. But  I\r\n\r\nwill  advise  the Traffic Police  to  lay  off  and\r\n\r\ninstead go after the pirate taxis proper. They have\r\n\r\ngot the SCH licences. Lay off until such time as  I\r\n\r\ncan  decide  on their fate.\" And as stated  in  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper, Sir, at page 21, paragraph  7.3,  you\r\n\r\ncan  see  the  figures of pirate taxi  arrests.  In\r\n\r\n1968,  1.156 pirate taxis were arrested;  in  1969,\r\n\r\n958, which is almost a thousand. But in 1969/70, no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCH  taxis were arrested because I told the Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice  to  leave them alone until a  decision  had\r\n\r\nbeen made. The relevant paragraph reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The absence of arrests of SCH School Taxis for\r\n\r\n1969/70,  was not due to exemplary conduct  of  SCH\r\n\r\nTaxis  but  the  fact  that in  November  1968  the\r\n\r\nMinistry [which is really myself~ requested Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice  not to harass SCH Taxis, pending a decision\r\n\r\nwhich  would  be  decided under this reorganisation\r\n\r\nplan.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Unfortunately,  because of  this,  they  just  took\r\n\r\nadvantage  of the situation and merrily went  about\r\n\r\npirate  taxi-ing proper. The majority of them  were\r\n\r\nnot   taking  school  children.  They  were  openly\r\n\r\ndriving up and down the road. They thought the  SCH\r\n\r\nplate  gave  them  protection.  That  was  a   very\r\n\r\nridiculous  state of affairs. Two weeks ago,  after\r\n\r\nthe White Paper was published in the Chinese press,\r\n\r\nI had to instruct the Traffic Police to carry on as\r\n\r\nthey used to. So the SCH taxis, which are operating\r\n\r\nopenly now as pirate taxis, are being nabbed.  That\r\n\r\nis why we hear of people running around and sending\r\n\r\npetitions here and there supposedly in the name  of\r\n\r\nthe   Committee   for  the  safeguarding   of   the\r\n\r\nlivelihood  of  SCH  drivers'.  They  are  not  SCH\r\n\r\ndrivers.  They are pirate taxis operating  as  such\r\n\r\nbut  with SCH plates. These things have been  going\r\n\r\non,  with  transfers of SCH licences at a  cost  of\r\n\r\n$2,000   a  licence.  By  buying  an  SCH  licence,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  they  have a legal  way  of  conducting\r\n\r\nthemselves as pirate taxi operators. This is  where\r\n\r\nwe  have got to be very clear in our stand. We must\r\n\r\ndifferentiate  between  the  genuine  SCH   drivers\r\n\r\ntaking school children from home to school and from\r\n\r\nschool to home and those who brazenly drive up  and\r\n\r\ndown   the  busy  streets  picking  up  passengers,\r\n\r\nstopping  at bus stops and doing things like  that.\r\n\r\nThis  state  of affairs cannot go on.  The  Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice will pick them up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has asked whether SCH taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers will be encouraged to own and operate  mini\r\n\r\nschool  buses. The answer is \"yes\". In fact,  there\r\n\r\nare  at least 150 of the 900 SCH licences which are\r\n\r\nmini  buses  or  station wagons, and the  operators\r\n\r\nhave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen asked to change their licence to an SCB plate,\r\n\r\nwhich  is a school bus or a mini school bus series,\r\n\r\nand  the  N.T.U.C, is also about  to  operate  such\r\n\r\nbuses.  They are vans and station wagons,  but  not\r\n\r\nordinary  private cars. So long as  they  have  SCB\r\n\r\nplates, we can keep a watch on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the goods vehicles. As I mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier,  we  received a petition  from  the  Lorry\r\n\r\nOwners'  Association.  I  think  the  Members   for\r\n\r\nSembawang  and Jalan Kayu are concerned that  there\r\n\r\nis  no  indication as to how the phasing  out  will\r\n\r\ntake  place. It stands to reason that  it  will  be\r\n\r\nphased  out  gradually  over  a  period  of   time.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the oldest vehicles will first  have  to\r\n\r\nbe  changed to new ones. You find a lot of these 25\r\n\r\nyears  old  rickety vehicles breaking down  in  the\r\n\r\nheart  of town, causing traffic jams and so  forth.\r\n\r\nThere  is no doubt that we do not want an immediate\r\n\r\nchange  of all lorries that are more than 15  years\r\n\r\nold.  We  will  first pick out those that  are  the\r\n\r\noldest, and gradually come to those approaching  15\r\n\r\nyears for the change-over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few miscellaneous questions. I have\r\n\r\nalready  answered the one posed by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang,  that  the Traffic Police  and  the  Car\r\n\r\nParks  Division should come under the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunications. Logically they should, but I am not\r\n\r\nin   charge  of  the  demarcation  of  duties   and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities. That is the responsibility of the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister. Perhaps if the Member for Sembawang\r\n\r\nwill   write   a  letter  to  the  Prime   Minister\r\n\r\nsuggesting this change-over, he might agree, but  I\r\n\r\nthink  I  have  enough on my plate. I would  prefer\r\n\r\nlooking  after my Ministry as it is, for  the  time\r\n\r\nbeing.  This reorganisation plan will give me  more\r\n\r\nwhite hairs than I have now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also raised the question\r\n\r\nof  the  discourtesy of the ROV, staff. Since  1959\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P.   Government   has   never   tolerated\r\n\r\ndiscourtesy  in  Government  departments.   It   is\r\n\r\nsometimes  possible that a member of the staff  may\r\n\r\nhave  had  a bad night, e.g., a scolding  from  his\r\n\r\nwife for going\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhome  late,  and turns up for office the  next  day\r\n\r\nwith  a  sour face. This can happen. It is  humanly\r\n\r\npossible.   As   a  rule,  we  do   not   encourage\r\n\r\ndiscourtesy.  If  a  member of  the  public  has  a\r\n\r\ngenuine  complaint and is able to say that \"I  came\r\n\r\nto  the R.O.V, one day and was treated badly by  so\r\n\r\nand  so\", we will look into it and have the  Public\r\n\r\nService  Commission take action on  it.  There  are\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  rules.  One  must  be  definite   and\r\n\r\nspecific in making a complaint. If it is a  genuine\r\n\r\ncase,  we  will look into it. But it is  not  quite\r\n\r\nfair to tar everybody with the same brush.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol says that he agrees to the\r\n\r\nincrease  of  staff for the R.O.V. I am  very  glad\r\n\r\nthat  he  supports the Ministry's request for  more\r\n\r\nstaff. On the other hand, he says that he does  not\r\n\r\nfeel  that  the increase is adequate.  I  wish  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance thinks the same. I would  like\r\n\r\nto  say  this. If the Member will turn to page  28,\r\n\r\nparagraph 12.2 (b) Enforcement Section of the White\r\n\r\nPaper, he will see that in 1962, the original staff\r\n\r\nof  the  R.O.V. Inspectorate was 45. Lower down  in\r\n\r\nthe third paragraph, it is now suggested to recruit\r\n\r\n\"80  additional men for the Traffic Police  (to  be\r\n\r\nattached  to  ROV.)\". The Member  says  it  is  not\r\n\r\nenough, but 80 additional men represent 50 per cent\r\n\r\nof the present establishment of the Traffic Police.\r\n\r\nThere  are  only 160 men in the Traffic  Police  at\r\n\r\nthis  moment. And asking for 80 men is  asking  for\r\n\r\none-half  of  the  present establishment!  This  is\r\n\r\nalready  a  big  mouthful, and  if  I  can  get  80\r\n\r\nadditional men, I think I am very lucky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol then refers to the report\r\n\r\nof  the  two London Transport officials. He  quotes\r\n\r\nthe  Hansard of 1969, which is a year ago, and also\r\n\r\nmentions the fact that in another reply a  team  of\r\n\r\nU.N, advisers  have  been in the  State  and  City\r\n\r\nPlanning Department for the last two years  working\r\n\r\non a mass rapid transit system. If he will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagain  refer to page 34 of the White Paper, section\r\n\r\nIi, under the title Reports and documents etc.,  he\r\n\r\nwill find item (5) of section II which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Rail Transit Plan for Singapore, May, 1968 by P.\r\n\r\nE.

Since  the\r\n\r\nWorld  Bank has expressed an interest in conducting\r\n\r\na   feasibility  study,  we  hope  that  when  this\r\n\r\nfeasibility   study  is  completed  and   it   does\r\n\r\nrecommend a mass rapid transit system, then perhaps\r\n\r\nby  the  1980s  we  will be able to  travel  either\r\n\r\nunderground or overhead. By then, we will  be  able\r\n\r\nto  have  a  proper  public transport  system  with\r\n\r\nimproved bus services on the road and some form  of\r\n\r\nmass rapid transit either underground or overhead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament approves the proposals of\r\n\r\nthe  Government on the Reorganisation of the  Motor\r\n\r\nTransport Service of Singapore as set out in  Paper\r\n\r\nCommand 21 of 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be\r\n\r\nfixed.\"-[Mr Yong Nyuk Lin].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">at Nineteen minutes to Nine o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
