A dense\r\n\r\ncloud of smoke, haze many times the size of Singapore, has built\r\n\r\nup over Kalimantan. The situation is of grave concern to us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is currently cooperating with and assisting\r\n\r\nIndonesia within the framework of the Regional Haze Action Plan.\r\n\r\nWhile  Indonesia has so far not approached us for any assistance\r\n\r\nbeyond  what  we  are  providing  today,  I  have  informed   my\r\n\r\nIndonesian counterpart that Singapore will be prepared to assist\r\n\r\nwhere we have the necessary technical expertise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Haze held in\r\n\r\nKuching  on  25th February, the Indonesian Environment  Minister\r\n\r\nstated  that  only the onset of rains could put  the  Kalimantan\r\n\r\nfires  out, and current fire-fighting efforts by Indonesia would\r\n\r\nonly  mitigate  the situation.  In view of this assessment,  the\r\n\r\nASEAN Environment Ministers attending the Meeting proposed  that\r\n\r\nMalaysia and Indonesia immediately\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactivate  their  bilateral MOU on joint disaster management  and\r\n\r\nrelief  efforts, and that personnel of the two countries proceed\r\n\r\nto  identify the additional resources that are needed  to  fight\r\n\r\nthe  fires.   Singapore and the other ASEAN countries  can  then\r\n\r\nhelp to provide some of the needed resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministers also called for immediate international help\r\n\r\nto  meet  the  looming  crisis.  Singapore will  work  alongside\r\n\r\ninternational   organisations  such  as   the   United   Nations\r\n\r\nEnvironment   Programme   (UNEP)   to   mobilise   international\r\n\r\nassistance.   We  have met up with UNEP in Kuching  and  are  in\r\n\r\ntouch  with  them.  Singapore will also actively participate  in\r\n\r\nany international effort to help put out the fires.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, the Minister says\r\n\r\nthat  the  chances of preventing the haze coming from Kalimantan\r\n\r\nto  Singapore  are slim.  I want to know why.  Is  there  not  a\r\n\r\ngovernment there?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Yes, there is a government there, as I\r\n\r\nam sure Mr Chiam knows.  However, the fires have now spread to a\r\n\r\nhuge  area,  and the situation has been made worse by  the  long\r\n\r\ndrought  that Kalimantan has been facing because of the El  Nino\r\n\r\neffect.    I  think  Mr  Chiam would realise,  if  he  has  been\r\n\r\nwatching TV on fighting big bush fires, that once the fires  are\r\n\r\nraging, it is very difficult to put them out.  In fact, the fire\r\n\r\nthat we had recently in Singapore involving a pile of waste wood\r\n\r\ntook  us about 3-4 days to put out.  With over 50 people working\r\n\r\nand  with a lot of equipment being put on the job, it still took\r\n\r\nus  quite a few days to put out what is relatively a small fire,\r\n\r\nin  the  context of the big fires that are raging in Kalimantan.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why  we  have  to mobilise international  support  and\r\n\r\nassistance,  because  in  the current  economic  situation  that\r\n\r\nIndonesia is in, I think it would be difficult to expect them to\r\n\r\ndeploy  a  lot  of  resources.  So we must  supplement  whatever\r\n\r\nresources they have through international efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I agree that this is an\r\n\r\ninternational  problem.

The Indonesian Minister has told us, as  I\r\n\r\nhave  reported in my main answer, that in view of the fact  that\r\n\r\nthe  fires have now spread over such a big area, they  can  only\r\n\r\nhope to solve the problem with the help of nature, ie, hope  for\r\n\r\nthe rains to come and for the drought to end.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister then saying that there is\r\n\r\nreally  nothing  anyone is going to do except to  pray  for  the\r\n\r\nrains?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, if he had been listening carefully,\r\n\r\nhe would have heard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat I said that the ASEAN Ministers, realising that there is  a\r\n\r\nbig  crisis looming, have already asked for international  help,\r\n\r\nvery  early  in  the  game, and that UNEP  has  responded  quite\r\n\r\npositively,  and  we  look forward to the international  efforts\r\n\r\ncoming  with  the  active help of UNEP.

They\r\n\r\nare  not bursaries, given to needy students who otherwise  could\r\n\r\nnot  get a university education.  They are not general education\r\n\r\nsubsidies,  which anybody who qualifies to go to  university  is\r\n\r\nentitled  to.   Nor are they academic prizes, merit  awards  for\r\n\r\ngood performance without any strings attached.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of an overseas scholarship is high about $250,000\r\n\r\nper  scholar.  There must be an accountability to the public for\r\n\r\nsuch  a large investment in a single individual.  A scholar  who\r\n\r\nfails  to return to serve his bond has used public funds  merely\r\n\r\nto serve his personal ends.  He has thwarted the State's purpose\r\n\r\nin  investing  in  his  abilities.  More reprehensible,  he  has\r\n\r\ndeprived  another student of the opportunity of studying  at  an\r\n\r\noutstanding university, who would have made more contribution to\r\n\r\nhis sponsor and to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Legal Obligation to Serve</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to compel scholarship recipients to serve,\r\n\r\nif  they have made up their minds not to do so.  The fundamental\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  law is that the courts will not  compel  specific\r\n\r\nperformance of personal service contracts.  This is for a  basic\r\n\r\nreason: if a person does not want to fulfil an obligation he has\r\n\r\nentered  into,  it is beyond the powers of any court  or  anyone\r\n\r\nelse  to  force  him to do so.  This is unlike, for  example,  a\r\n\r\ncontract to buy or sell a property.  Once a person enters into a\r\n\r\nsale  or  purchase agreement, he has to go through and  complete\r\n\r\nthe  deal.  Otherwise, the other party can go to court to compel\r\n\r\nhim to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the remedy for non-performance is payment of\r\n\r\ndamages.  In the case of scholarships, this takes the form of  a\r\n\r\nscholarship bond.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both parties to a scholarship award need to be committed to\r\n\r\nthe  arrangement  which they have embarked upon  together.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and  statutory boards offering  scholarships,  will\r\n\r\nmake  every  effort to offer scholars and other public  officers\r\n\r\nrewarding careers.  They implement good human resource  policies\r\n\r\nand  practices, offer challenging assignments, provide  training\r\n\r\nand   development   opportunities,   maintain   conducive   work\r\n\r\nenvironments,  and  give  timely  recognition  for  effort   and\r\n\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the scholar also has to live up to his end of the deal.\r\n\r\nHe  has  to  make an honest, conscientious effort to fulfil  his\r\n\r\nobligation,  and to serve the organisation which has  given  him\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity,  invested  in  him,  and  expects  in  time  a\r\n\r\ncontribution from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Moral Responsibility to Serve</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But apart from the legal obligation, scholarships also\r\n\r\ncarry  a  moral responsibility.  A scholarship is not  simply  a\r\n\r\nstudy  loan,  with an option to serve in lieu  of  repaying  the\r\n\r\nloan.   Nor  is  it a commercial contract which may  be  settled\r\n\r\npurely by paying liquidated damages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No applicant at a scholarship interview explains that he\r\n\r\nwill  treat  his  scholarship purely as a legal obligation,  and\r\n\r\nthat  he  will  be  off as soon as another opportunity  presents\r\n\r\nitself.   Every one explains how anxious he is to contribute  to\r\n\r\nthe organisation, and why he and not another candidate should be\r\n\r\ngiven the chance to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when a scholar breaks a bond, it is not just a matter of\r\n\r\ncontracts and liquidated damages.  It involves deeper issues  of\r\n\r\nright and wrong, moral integrity, a sense of shame at breaking a\r\n\r\nsolemn personal undertaking.  It is not just a legal, but also a\r\n\r\nmoral obligation.  There is a qualitative difference between the\r\n\r\ntwo.   Without  the moral sense of duty to family,  friends  and\r\n\r\nsociety,  no  society can thrive.  No army can  win  battles  if\r\n\r\nevery  soldier only does his minimum duty.  It is  the  altruism\r\n\r\nand  heroism  of  outstanding leaders  and  soldiers,  from  the\r\n\r\ncommander-in-chief down\r\n\r\nto  the  private soldier, which differentiates the victors  from\r\n\r\nthe vanquished.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students also seek scholarships because of the prestige\r\n\r\nthey  carry.   Some apply for PSC scholarships not because  they\r\n\r\nwant  one  or  need one, but just to measure themselves  against\r\n\r\nPSC's standard.  I believe some parents tell their children that\r\n\r\nthey will pay for their overseas education, but only if they are\r\n\r\ngood enough to be offered a PSC scholarship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools, principals, teachers, relatives, the media, all\r\n\r\nhold up scholars as success stories to be proud of and emulated.\r\n\r\nEven  if it is just one of your 40 pupils who got a scholarship,\r\n\r\nthe   teacher  will,  as  they  say  in  Chinese,   zhan  guang,\r\n\r\n[               ]  share  in his glory.  This public recognition\r\n\r\ncarries with it an obligation to serve.  When the obligation  is\r\n\r\nrefused, shame is brought not only to the scholar, but  also  to\r\n\r\nhis  family,  his  principals, teachers and  everyone  else  who\r\n\r\nshared in his success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I showed a draft of this speech to the Ministers. RAdm Teo\r\n\r\nChee Hean e-mailed me back his views, which I will quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Even in a purely commercial contract, there is an element\r\n\r\nof obligation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose I sign a contract to supply bricks to a housing\r\n\r\ncontractor.  Come the appointed day of delivery, I turn  up  and\r\n\r\nsay  that I am unable to supply the bricks, and he can have  his\r\n\r\nliquidated damages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contractor is not interested in my LD - he wants the\r\n\r\nbricks; his building schedule depends on it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an expectation even in purely commercial deals\r\n\r\nthat contracts will be fulfilled.  The contractor will never buy\r\n\r\nanother  load of bricks from me - and may even tell his  friends\r\n\r\nnot  to  do business with me (so that they will not be similarly\r\n\r\nleft in the lurch).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government debars contractors and publishes their names\r\n\r\nwhen they default for no good reason.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose the contractor found out that I was actually able\r\n\r\nto  deliver the bricks, but had decided to sell them to  someone\r\n\r\nelse  that  day because he had offered me a few cents  more  per\r\n\r\nbrick.  He would blow his top.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think anyone will say that what I did is OK since\r\n\r\nmy bricks are still being used to build houses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone treated commercial contracts that way, that\r\n\r\nperson will soon be out of business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking a scholarship involves even more of an obligation\r\n\r\nthan offering to sell bricks.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is a moral obligation. But this does not mean\r\n\r\nthat  every scholar must always serve till the very last day  of\r\n\r\nhis  bond,  come hell or high water.  Between the award  of  the\r\n\r\nscholarship  and the end of the bond period may be 10  years  or\r\n\r\nmore.   Many unforeseeable events may intervene, which may  make\r\n\r\nit  awkward for the scholar to continue to serve, either for the\r\n\r\nscholar  himself or even for his employer.  In which  case,  the\r\n\r\nbreak clause provides a way out for both parties.  Mr Leong Horn\r\n\r\nKee  was candid in telling this House that he too once paid  off\r\n\r\nhis  scholarship bond.  I know that other MPs have also done so.\r\n\r\nBut  there cannot be a blanket condemnation of all scholars  who\r\n\r\nbreak  their bonds.  But in each case the circumstances have  to\r\n\r\nbe examined, and a judgment made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Flexibility in deploying scholars</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPs and members of the public reported in the media have\r\n\r\nasked  the  Government to administer its scholarships  flexibly,\r\n\r\nand  allow  scholars to fulfill their obligations  in  different\r\n\r\nways.  The Government is keen to develop the scholar talent pool\r\n\r\nto the full, in order to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaximise their contributions to Singapore.  It has gone  out  of\r\n\r\nits  way  to  help  scholars to pursue careers which  fit  their\r\n\r\ninclinations  and aptitudes.  It has often allowed  scholars  to\r\n\r\nproceed  on  Masters and even PhD courses, as well as industrial\r\n\r\nand research attachments.  However, the overriding criterion  is\r\n\r\nalways:  how will Singapore benefit from this further investment\r\n\r\nof time and/or money in the individual?  That the further degree\r\n\r\nbenefits the individual or his faculty is not sufficient reason.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EDB has been particularly flexible with its scholars\r\n\r\nbecause  it  has a wide range of scholarship schemes,  which  it\r\n\r\nawards together with private sector organisations.  For example,\r\n\r\nit   allowed  one  scholar  doing  an  undergraduate  degree  in\r\n\r\nelectrical/electronic  engineering  to  proceed  to  a  master's\r\n\r\ndegree.   It  also  arranged for him to  work  with  an  MNC  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  gain  industrial  experience,  at  the  scholar's\r\n\r\nrequest.   In  another case, it allowed a scholar to  defer  his\r\n\r\nbond  for  three years.  He was accompanying his  wife  who  was\r\n\r\ngoing to the US for a posting.  The scholar arranged to take  up\r\n\r\na  Research Fellowship in the US, so that on his return he would\r\n\r\nbe  able to contribute in the area of research.  I suppose  that\r\n\r\nif  he  had asked for leave of absence for three years to  be  a\r\n\r\nhusband, we would have considered the matter too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, 72 EDB scholars have been placed outside of EDB.\r\n\r\nSome  teach  in  tertiary institutions, others work  in  private\r\n\r\nindustry.    Still   others  serve  in  statutory   boards   and\r\n\r\nMinistries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Naming bond-breakers</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sometimes despite all our efforts, it proves impossible\r\n\r\nto  accommodate the scholar's request.  Or the scholar makes  up\r\n\r\nhis  mind that a career with the Singapore Government is not for\r\n\r\nhim,  and will not be shaken.  This has happened more frequently\r\n\r\nin  recent  years.  Nowadays, scholars receive  many  other  job\r\n\r\noffers,  sometimes before graduating.  Quite a few scholars,  or\r\n\r\ntheir families, also have the means to pay back the bond without\r\n\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bond breaking has therefore become a problem, especially\r\n\r\nwith   the   Singapore  Inc.  scholarships,   awarded   by   the\r\n\r\nparticipating  agencies,  which are  EDB,  NCB,  Civil  Aviation\r\n\r\nAuthority  of Singapore and Singapore Technologies.  Hence,  EDB\r\n\r\nannounced in August last year that it would tighten up the terms\r\n\r\nof  the  bonds  for  the Singapore Inc. scholarships.   It  also\r\n\r\nwarned  that  it  would publicise the names of those  who  broke\r\n\r\ntheir bonds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a precedent for this in America. The US\r\n\r\nGovernment  recently in January published  the  names  of  1,402\r\n\r\nhealth care professionals (doctors, chiropractor, surgeons)  who\r\n\r\nhave  defaulted  on  their  Health Education  Assistance  Loans.\r\n\r\nTheir  names  are posted on a special web page on the  Internet,\r\n\r\ntogether with the amounts they owe, to shame them.  And  if  you\r\n\r\nwant,     you    can    look    up    the    web     page     at\r\n\r\nwww.defaulteddocs.dhhs.gov, and you  can  check  them  by  name,\r\n\r\nfaculty,  university and discipline.  So you  know  who  is  the\r\n\r\ndefaulted doctor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All MPs who spoke have acknowledged that it is wrong to\r\n\r\nbreak  scholarship  bonds.  Dr Tan Cheng Bock  described  it  as\r\n\r\n\"ungentlemanly\",  in  an uncharacteristic  understatement.   But\r\n\r\nthey  questioned whether we should shame such scholars publicly.\r\n\r\nEDB  does not automatically publicise the name of every  scholar\r\n\r\nwho   has   broken   his   bond.   If  there   are   extenuating\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  EDB  will  take  them  into  account.   But   in\r\n\r\negregious  cases, publishing the name lets the public  know  the\r\n\r\nfacts.  If indeed the scholar had good reasons for acting as  he\r\n\r\ndid,  and feels that he has done no wrong in breaking the  bond,\r\n\r\nthen as Mr David Lim said yesterday, he has no  reason to object\r\n\r\nto  having his deed publicised, or even put into his CV.  But if\r\n\r\nhe  has  not  done  the right thing, then the only  question  is\r\n\r\nwhether publishing might be too harsh a punishment in his  case.\r\n\r\nThat is a judgment which the awarding organisations will have to\r\n\r\nmake, and they will have to make their decisions case by case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When EDB and NCB learnt that the three scholars intended to\r\n\r\nbreak  their bonds, they reminded the scholars and their parents\r\n\r\nof the warning EDB had already\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven,  that  the  Government would have to name  them  if  they\r\n\r\nproceeded.   They  asked  them to reconsider.  Regrettably,  the\r\n\r\nscholars did not change their minds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDB and NCB officers deliberated extensively and carefully\r\n\r\nbefore  deciding to proceed to name these three.  It was  not  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  the  three \"incurring the wrath of  some  Government\r\n\r\nofficials\", as Mr Chng Hee Kok put it.  The two statutory boards\r\n\r\nconsulted  PSC,  PSD,  and the other agencies  which  award  and\r\n\r\nhandle  scholarships.  Unfortunately, there were no  extenuating\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  All three were still studying, and had not  even\r\n\r\nstarted  work. They had no difficulties with their  courses,  or\r\n\r\nmedical  problems, or family difficulties.  They made no  effort\r\n\r\nto try to serve EDB or NCB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So finally, EDB and NCB decided that these three scholars\r\n\r\nhad to be named.  I vetted and approved the press statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>PSC scholars</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been very few cases of students on overseas PSC\r\n\r\nscholarships breaking their bonds.  This may partly  be  because\r\n\r\nthe  men  have  to return to complete their full  time  National\r\n\r\nService, unlike the statutory board scholars, many of whom  have\r\n\r\ncompleted  their NSF before going overseas.  In  the  last  five\r\n\r\nyears,  only  0.3%  of PSC overseas scholars broke  their  bonds\r\n\r\nbefore  they started work.  However, as and when cases arise  of\r\n\r\nscholars breaking bonds, PSD will study them, and decide whether\r\n\r\nit  is  necessary to publish their names.  We expect these cases\r\n\r\nto continue to be few.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Hector Yee</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hector Yee's case has been widely publicised in the media.\r\n\r\nQuestions have been raised whether the Government was too  rigid\r\n\r\nin  handling  his case.  Hence, I shall provide a chronology  of\r\n\r\nthe  discussions between Hector Yee and NCB. If I  can  ask  the\r\n\r\nClerk  to  hand  out  No. 1 (Cols. 985-988) Handout  [Copies  of\r\n\r\nHandout distributed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  hon.

The chronology shows that  NCB  made  every\r\n\r\neffort  to accommodate Hector Yee's requests, and was  taken  by\r\n\r\nsurprise when Hector Yee decided to break his bond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1998/19980311/19980311-HA-0680985.htm\">hand out No.  1  -  HECTOR  YEE YANG LI - CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS (Cols. 985 - 988)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hector Yee is studying Computer Science at Cornell\r\n\r\nUniversity  in  the  US.  He requested to  continue  beyond  his\r\n\r\nundergraduate  degree,  to  do  a Master's  degree  in  computer\r\n\r\ngraphics.  He  wanted to spend five years, longer than  the  4.5\r\n\r\nyears  which  NCB normally allows.  But after deliberation,  NCB\r\n\r\nagreed to five years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 9th January this year, NCB met Hector Yee, and told him\r\n\r\nthat  it  had  approved extension of his  stay  to  five  years.\r\n\r\nHector Yee said that he was considering a PhD after his Master's\r\n\r\ndegree.   NCB  Human Resources advised him to get  some  working\r\n\r\nexperience before pursuing his PhD.  Past NCB scholars had found\r\n\r\nit useful to get some working experience first.  Hector Yee said\r\n\r\nthat he had been offered a fully funded place in Cornell, and if\r\n\r\nhe  obtained a PhD, he would want to pursue an academic  career.\r\n\r\nAt  the meeting, he did not request NCB to allow him to continue\r\n\r\nto  complete his PhD without a break.  Nor did he enquire  about\r\n\r\npostings to research institutes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one week later, on 17th January 1998, Hector Yee e-mailed NCB Human Resources to say that he had decided to break\r\n\r\nhis  bond.   It was only now, after he had made up his  mind  to\r\n\r\nquit  that  he told NCB for the first time that he thought  that\r\n\r\nhis  field  of  study, ie, computer graphics,  was  \"not  really\r\n\r\nrelevant to the focus of NCB\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, on 26th January 1998, Hector Yee sent an e-mail to NCB Human Resources, explaining his desire to do\r\n\r\nresearch in computer graphics.  I attach the e-mail in the hand-out on the next page.  It reads:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I believe it would be a great evil to deprive the world of\r\n\r\nresearch whose by- products could significantly change  the  way\r\n\r\nwe   live.   I  work  to  benefit  all  humanity,  not  any  one\r\n\r\norganisation or group of people.. Thus I'm saddened that NCB has\r\n\r\nreacted  in  this  way, but I cannot deprive the  world  of  the\r\n\r\npotential benefits that can be derived from my research.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was only after Hector Yee had decided to break his\r\n\r\nbond  that  he told NCB he wanted to do research, and  that  NCB\r\n\r\ncould  not accommodate the career that he had in mind.   It  was\r\n\r\nnot  the case of his trying to persuade NCB to let him do  this,\r\n\r\nand NCB refusing to do so, thus forcing him to quit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saddened to read Hector Yee's e-mail. Despite his\r\n\r\nunquestioned intelligence and academic brilliance,  he  has  not\r\n\r\nunderstood one simple fact: that Singapore gave him this  chance\r\n\r\nto  study in Cornell and that he owed something to the  rest  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, to strengthen Singapore's chances for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Duty to Singapore</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is not China. China has millions of talented\r\n\r\nyoung  people.  It can afford to lose tens of thousands of  them\r\n\r\noverseas,  and  yet have many more to spare.  It has  to  accept\r\n\r\nthis  as  the price of modernisation to send people overseas  to\r\n\r\nlearn about technology, economics, finance, and to come back and\r\n\r\npull  China  up and in the process lose many abroad.   Singapore\r\n\r\nneeds all the talent we can find.  We do all we can to help each\r\n\r\none  achieve the best he can, within the resources we have.  But\r\n\r\nthis investment is for the advancement of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many of our scholars, going overseas to study is a\r\n\r\nheady  experience.   They do brilliantly  academically,  because\r\n\r\nthey  are  extremely bright and well prepared.  Their professors\r\n\r\nsee them as star pupils, and strongly encourage them to continue\r\n\r\nin  an academic career.  Hector Yee is not the first Singaporean\r\n\r\nto have been made such an offer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without Singapore and the Singapore system, our scholars\r\n\r\nwould never have had the opportunities which made them what they\r\n\r\nwere, took them to the top universities in the world, and opened\r\n\r\nthe  door  to  fascinating  careers  in  research,  finance,  or\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes maturity for scholars to remember why they were\r\n\r\nsent  overseas in the first place, and to feel the pull of their\r\n\r\nobligations  and  responsibilities  back  home.   They  need  to\r\n\r\nunderstand that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndespite   having   all   these   boundless   opportunities,   as\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  their  first duty is to  Singapore.   Fortunately\r\n\r\nmost  scholars do return, and soon adjust back to  life  in  the\r\n\r\nreal world.  And as they grow older and their views mature, they\r\n\r\ncome  to realise where their youthful ideas of what is important\r\n\r\nand what they hope to achieve in life were naive or mistaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Mr Chng Hee Kok's meeting with Mr Philip Yeo</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One extraneous issue which has been introduced into this\r\n\r\ndebate is the meeting between Mr Chng Hee Kok and Mr Philip  Yeo\r\n\r\non the question of bond breakers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have heard Mr Chng's account of the meeting. Other\r\n\r\nMembers too have commented on the matter, although they were not\r\n\r\npresent at the meeting, notably Dr Tan Cheng Bock.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge Members to exercise restraint in criticising civil\r\n\r\nservants, especially in this House.  The civil servants are  not\r\n\r\nhere  to  defend themselves, nor can they answer back.   If  MPs\r\n\r\nhave  problems with individual civil servants, they should  take\r\n\r\nthe  matter  up with the Minister in charge.  And  if  they  are\r\n\r\nstill  not  satisfied, they can raise it with me  or  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.   MPs  and  civil  servants  both  play  crucial   but\r\n\r\ndifferent roles in our body politic.  Without mutual respect and\r\n\r\nappreciation between them, the Government cannot work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng had spoken to me earlier about his meeting with Mr\r\n\r\nPhilip Yeo.  He had complained about Mr Philip Yeo asking him to\r\n\r\nresign.  I therefore called for the file note of the meeting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a breakfast meeting, which took place on 19th\r\n\r\nJanuary  1998.  Besides Mr Chng and Mr Philip Yeo,  four  others\r\n\r\nwere  present:  Mr  Ho Meng Kit, Managing Director  of  EDB;  Mr\r\n\r\nStephen  Yeo, Chief Executive of NCB; Mrs Shirley  Chen  and  Mr\r\n\r\nTimothy  Sebastian, both EDB staff.  The file note was  recorded\r\n\r\nby  Mr  Timothy  Sebastian,  vetted by  Mrs  Shirley  Chen,  and\r\n\r\napproved   by   Mr  Ho  Meng  Kit.   The  note  was   classified\r\n\r\nConfidential,  because EDB had no intention of  publicising  the\r\n\r\nmeeting  with  Mr Chng.  But since Mr Chng has made  the  matter\r\n\r\npublic, I am releasing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  to  Members.  Can we have Handout 2 (Cols. 989-996), please?\r\n\r\n[Copies of Handout distributed to hon. Members.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1998/19980311/19980311-HA-0680989.htm\">Handout 2 (Cols. 989 - 996)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also releasing the letter which EDB wrote to Mr Chng\r\n\r\nafter  the breakfast meeting, inviting Mr Chng to say  who  were\r\n\r\nthe  MPs who had views different from Mr Yeo's, so that  Mr  Yeo\r\n\r\ncould  arrange a meeting with them to discuss the issue further.\r\n\r\nIt  is  the  first  page  of the handout.   Dr  Tan  Cheng  Bock\r\n\r\ndescribed  this as EDB trying \"to summon MPs for  a  meeting  to\r\n\r\nanswer  to him why they disagree\".  He will see that  it  is  in\r\n\r\nfact  a  very  courteous  letter, which  unfortunately  did  not\r\n\r\nreceive a reply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo did indeed tell Mr Chng that MPs who held such views\r\n\r\nshould resign.  It was wrong of Mr Yeo to say this.  And I  have\r\n\r\ntold  him  so.   I have reminded him that it is  for  the  party\r\n\r\nleadership  and the Whip, not Chairman EDB, to  take  an  MP  to\r\n\r\ntask.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this exchange between Mr Chng and Mr Yeo did not take\r\n\r\nplace  out  of the blue.  It is relevant to read the  discussion\r\n\r\nbetween  Mr  Chng and Mr Yeo which preceded this.  And  I  refer\r\n\r\nMembers to the file note.  Let us look at paragraphs 4 and 5:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Taking up the point of honour and integrity, Mr Chng said\r\n\r\nthat he did not agree that scholars who broke their bonds lacked\r\n\r\nthese  qualities.  He said that so long as they  paid  what  was\r\n\r\nowed  to the organisation, they had fulfilled their obligations.\r\n\r\nChmn  disagreed.  He said that as an MP, Mr Chng  should  uphold\r\n\r\nvalues  such  as honour, integrity and commitment.   By  putting\r\n\r\nforth  his  views publicly on this issue, scholars  would  think\r\n\r\nthat  it  was all right to break their bonds.  He was  therefore\r\n\r\ndoing a disservice to young Singaporeans who would take this  to\r\n\r\nmean  that scholarships were mere legal contracts that could  be\r\n\r\nentered into lightly and broken easily.  Chmn said that  it  was\r\n\r\nincumbent on MPs and public leaders to set the right example and\r\n\r\nto  send  the  right messages.  Mr Chng retorted that  this  was\r\n\r\nChmn's view, and that it was not necessarily a correct one.   He\r\n\r\nreiterated that he did not see anything wrong with scholars  who\r\n\r\nbroke their bonds without serving a single day, so long as  they\r\n\r\npaid  up  their  liquidated damages.  He added that  there  were\r\n\r\ninstances where MPs do not agree with the government's  position\r\n\r\non various issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chmn cited the example of his son, Eugene, who had asked\r\n\r\nabout  taking  up a scholarship prior to entering university  in\r\n\r\nUSA.  Chmn advised him to do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  only if he was genuinely committed to returning to serve his\r\n\r\nbond.   If not, he was not only taking away an opportunity  from\r\n\r\nanother  good  student,  but he was also  being  unfair  to  his\r\n\r\nsponsor.   Upon consideration, Eugene decided not to take  up  a\r\n\r\nscholarship.   Chmn asked Mr Chng whether he  would  advise  his\r\n\r\ndaughter who was studying in Yale any differently.  Mr Chng said\r\n\r\nthat  if  his  daughter wanted to break bond, he  would  not  be\r\n\r\nagainst it.'\r\n\r\nAnd  at  this point, according to the note, \"Chmn said that  MPs\r\n\r\nwho held such views should resign as they were sending the wrong\r\n\r\nsignal to young Singaporeans\", and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the issue was not whether or not we should\r\n\r\npublish  the  names of the bond breakers, which is a  matter  on\r\n\r\nwhich  we  may reasonably disagree.  The issue was a fundamental\r\n\r\none:  whether  or  not there is anything wrong with  breaking  a\r\n\r\nscholarship bond, especially without making the slightest effort\r\n\r\nto  fulfil it.  It is clear from the file note that Mr Chng  had\r\n\r\nargued that it was quite all right to break a scholarship  bond,\r\n\r\nbecause  it was just a matter of a legal contract and liquidated\r\n\r\ndamages, and this is what provoked the dispute with Mr Yeo.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No MP has argued in Parliament that there is nothing wrong\r\n\r\nwith  breaking  a  bond.  On Monday, Mr Chng  Hee  Kok,  to  his\r\n\r\ncredit,  no  longer  maintained that there  was  nothing  wrong.\r\n\r\nInstead, he argued, and I quote from his speech:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Certainly, scholars do have an obligation other than legal\r\n\r\nto serve their bonds.  We cannot encourage scholars to terminate\r\n\r\ntheir  bonds.  Moreover, a scholarship in Singapore brings  much\r\n\r\nhonour  and  prestige  to the scholar  and  the  family.   Hence\r\n\r\nterminating a bond must bring with it some dishonour.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng has told me that he had thought the matter over and\r\n\r\nmodified  his  stand.  Had Mr Chng taken this  more  responsible\r\n\r\nline  in his meeting with Mr Philip Yeo on 19th January 1998,  I\r\n\r\ndoubt  if he would have provoked the reaction that he did.   The\r\n\r\nview that he actually expressed in his meeting with Mr Yeo,  and\r\n\r\nrecorded in the file note, is wrong, and dangerous if it becomes\r\n\r\nwidely held.  MPs are opinion leaders.  The views they propagate\r\n\r\nin public speeches set the tone for society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a bond does not enslave a scholar. It\r\n\r\ndevelops  his potential to the maximum.  By his early  30s,  his\r\n\r\nbond is over and he can decide on a change of careers.  However,\r\n\r\nthe  training, the discipline and the moral values that  he  has\r\n\r\nimbibed in the years working out his bond will remain with  him:\r\n\r\nthat  sense  of  the  larger mission  in  life,  and  the  basic\r\n\r\ninstincts  and values to do the right thing by his  country  and\r\n\r\nhis  community.   These will enable him to do well  in  whatever\r\n\r\nfield he chooses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scholars had no problem with bonds for over three decades,\r\n\r\nfrom the 1950s to the middle 1980s.  This flow of trained talent\r\n\r\ninto  the  public  sector carried Singapore up  to  its  present\r\n\r\nlevels,  the  least bureaucratic government in the  region,  the\r\n\r\nleading  container  port,  airport, airline,  telecommunications\r\n\r\ncentre,  and so on.  These scholars include Lee Yock  Suan,  Lim\r\n\r\nBoon  Heng,  George Yeo, Lim Hng Kiang, Teo Chee  Hean,  Kishore\r\n\r\nMahbubani,  Lim Siong Guan, Philip Yeo, and many others.   Among\r\n\r\nthe  younger generations of scholars we can count several MPs  - David Lim, Lim Swee Say, and S. Iswaran, I believe, the youngest\r\n\r\nMember of the House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the 1980s, with increasing affluence, the sense of\r\n\r\nurgency for Singapore's future has dissipated.  More parents and\r\n\r\nstudents  are  now  driven by self-interest rather  than  public\r\n\r\nduty.   Unless we check this tendency, Singapore cannot maintain\r\n\r\nits  present  standards of excellence.  We need  that  sense  of\r\n\r\ndedication among our brightest and best, that commitment  beyond\r\n\r\nthemselves  and  their  families, to the  larger  community  and\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our scholars owe their academic success to the system that\r\n\r\naffords everybody an equal chance to achieve this maximum.  They\r\n\r\nowe a duty to preserve and sustain the system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just\r\n\r\nhave  your  indulgence  to speak on the  Ministerial  Statement.\r\n\r\nInstead of couching all the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npoints I made in the form of questions, I just want to say a few\r\n\r\nwords about what transpired.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I was invited to this breakfast meeting, I\r\n\r\nthought  it  was a social breakfast.  No sooner did we  get  the\r\n\r\nfood  from  the  buffet  table, EDB Chairman  gave  me  a  draft\r\n\r\nannouncement of three scholars who were terminating their bonds.\r\n\r\nHe showed me a copy of The Straits Times' report of 13th October\r\n\r\non the table.  Yes, I admitted I said I agreed that I had spoken\r\n\r\nagainst him.  My views remained what was reported.  Without much\r\n\r\npreamble,  he  accused me of sharing the values of  those  three\r\n\r\nscholars  who were breaking their bonds.  And because  I  shared\r\n\r\ntheir  values,  I  should resign.  I was completely  caught  off\r\n\r\nguard by this response of EDB Chairman and two very senior civil\r\n\r\nservants.   I  was  definitely very surprised.   Of  course,  my\r\n\r\nimmediate reaction was to question his standing in asking me  to\r\n\r\nresign.  Elected representative - resign!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I told EDB Chairman that he should not take the matter\r\n\r\npersonally.  His is a Government's position.  I have  spoken  up\r\n\r\nagainst Government policies several times before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can imagine the atmosphere after this came about. I\r\n\r\nsat  down  for  breakfast,  and I  was  asked  to  resign.   And\r\n\r\ncertainly the discussion got a bit awry.  The sequence  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant.  The file note says in paragraph 6 that he then asked\r\n\r\nme to resign.  But the starting point was he asked me to resign.\r\n\r\nAnd  later on, in the middle, when I confirmed that a number  of\r\n\r\nmy  colleagues  shared  similar  views  about  naming  scholars,\r\n\r\nbecause  I had a lunch discussion in Parliament and a number  of\r\n\r\npeople  do  express that there is no need to name scholars,  EDB\r\n\r\nChairman said that they should do likewise.  This was not in the\r\n\r\nfile note.  A number of points I made   two days ago in reply to\r\n\r\nDr  Tan  -  I stick by what I said - were not in the file  note.\r\n\r\nBut these are not important points.  The most important point is\r\n\r\nthat he did ask me to resign.  The question is: Which stage  did\r\n\r\nhe ask me to resign?  Will I, as a guest of very important civil\r\n\r\nservants go out of my way to the meeting and start to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovoke  them?  Would I do that?  These are very powerful  civil\r\n\r\nservants.  I went to the meeting with a very open mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some provocation, which is why the EDB Chairman\r\n\r\nsaid that he reacted accordingly.  That provocation was about my\r\n\r\ndaughter.  At that stage, the discussion went awry.  It  was  no\r\n\r\ngood  anymore.  He posed a hypothetical question and  he  got  a\r\n\r\nhypothetical  answer.  Perhaps this is Mr David Lim's  half-told\r\n\r\nstory, I think.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not intend to prolong this whole episode. I\r\n\r\nthink  the point to be made is that the meeting went  awry.   In\r\n\r\nthe  first  place,  I  still  do not  understand  what  was  the\r\n\r\nobjective of that meeting.   EDB Chairman made a public  speech.\r\n\r\nA PAP MP has spoken out that there was no need to do what he was\r\n\r\ngoing  to  do.  I was invited to breakfast.  Three  very  senior\r\n\r\nofficials  in the civil service spent a lot of time  and  effort\r\n\r\nand,  up  to  today, I still do not know the  objective  of  the\r\n\r\nmeeting.   It was not started in the way it was put in paragraph\r\n\r\n1,  ie, it was explained to me  the overall  picture and why  we\r\n\r\nare not supposed to do what I did, and when the press should ask\r\n\r\nme, please support.  Nothing was mentioned about the press.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  I  told DPM before I came to this Chamber that  had  that\r\n\r\nbeen  the  approach, I would have supported the  Government.   I\r\n\r\nwant to make it very clear to the DPM, the Prime Minister and to\r\n\r\nthis Chamber that, as a Government MP, I have never  never acted\r\n\r\nagainst  Government's  policy.   Since  the  Government  is  now\r\n\r\nstating  that breaking a bond is wrong, it is not in  line  with\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy, I wish to state for the record that I shall\r\n\r\nnot  have my children act against this policy.  If they  have  a\r\n\r\nscholarship,  they will fulfill it.  If not, they  will  not  go\r\n\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, this does not mean that PAP MPs should not\r\n\r\nspeak  on issues against naming of scholars.  There is long-term\r\n\r\nrepercussion.   It  can be a very traumatic experience.   Unless\r\n\r\nthe  Government  thinks through very carefully, this  policy  of\r\n\r\nnaming scholars may not be the right approach.  That is all I am\r\n\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my name\r\n\r\nwas mentioned.  I would like to ask a question but I do not know\r\n\r\nwhether  to direct it to the Minister or Chng Hee Kok.  Maybe  I\r\n\r\nshould  address  it  to Chng Hee Kok.  If  it  was  a  breakfast\r\n\r\nmeeting, I would expect all the participants at this meeting  to\r\n\r\nbe given minutes of this meeting.  So I want to ask Chng Hee Kok\r\n\r\nwhether  he  received the minutes of this meeting.  Because  the\r\n\r\npersons  who were present at the meeting must verify the minutes\r\n\r\nand  make corrections, if necessary.  So I just want to ask Chng\r\n\r\nHee Kok whether he received the minutes of this meeting.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, quite obviously, no, and\r\n\r\nI  was  caught  by surprise that the sequence of events  in  the\r\n\r\nminutes  sounds most reasonable.  Sir, as I said, I cannot  find\r\n\r\nanywhere  in  the minutes which mentioned about a number  of  my\r\n\r\nparliamentary colleagues who share similar views and yet at  the\r\n\r\nsame time, there was a follow-up letter to me on 2nd February on\r\n\r\nthat very same topic.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me put the\r\n\r\nposition  quite clearly.  This is not minutes of meeting.   This\r\n\r\nis  a  file note.  There was an informal discussion and the  EDB\r\n\r\nofficers  jotted down points.  There was, to put  it  mildly,  a\r\n\r\nstrong divergence of views.  The meeting broke up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr Chng raised the matter with me, I asked EDB whether\r\n\r\nthey  had the record.  They prepared this and gave me this  from\r\n\r\nthe points which they jotted down.  As you can see, Ho Meng Kit,\r\n\r\nShirley  Chen, Timothy Sebastian, three EDB officers,  prepared,\r\n\r\nvetted  and approved the file note, not Philip Yeo.  Philip  Yeo\r\n\r\nwas  away.   Philip Yeo came back and I asked whether  the  file\r\n\r\nnote was a complete account.  EDB wanted to add more to the file\r\n\r\nnote.   I  said,  \"No, you leave it.  This is what  is  written.\r\n\r\nGive  me a supplementary note.\" Because Mr Chng had told me that\r\n\r\nhe had asked the other MPs to resign,  I would read the relevant\r\n\r\nparagraph from the supplementary note:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Going back to the issue of his daughter, Chairman asked Mr\r\n\r\nChng  whether  he would encourage her to break bond prematurely.\r\n\r\nMr Chng replied loud and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclear,  \"Yes.\"  Chairman was really shocked.  Chairman told  him\r\n\r\nthat  he showed a bad moral example for an elected MP.  Mr  Chng\r\n\r\nargued  that  the bond was a mere contract and it had  no  moral\r\n\r\nvalue.  Chairman then suggested that he should resign as an  MP.\r\n\r\nMr  Chng defiantly said that there were many other MPs who share\r\n\r\nhis  value system.  Chairman then similarly said that  they  all\r\n\r\nshould resign.  However, Chairman said that he would be glad  to\r\n\r\nmeet  them  to  know  who they are, to explain  and  hear  their\r\n\r\nviews.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not meant to be a blow-by-blow\r\n\r\ncourt  room  reconstruction or forensic examination.   A  strong\r\n\r\ndivergence of views has led to a personal clash.  Mr Philip  Yeo\r\n\r\ndid  wrong  in telling MPs to resign.  I think Mr Chng  did  not\r\n\r\ntake  the correct attitude either in the argument which he  made\r\n\r\nthat  it is perfectly all right to break bonds as it is  just  a\r\n\r\nlegal  obligation.  There is nothing we can do about  the  past.\r\n\r\nThe  matter has come up, so  I have produced the facts  which  I\r\n\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I am glad the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister has made this Ministerial Statement.    It\r\n\r\ngives  us  a chance to hear the Government's position  and  also\r\n\r\ngives  the  Backbenchers a chance to pose a couple of questions.\r\n\r\nI  do  agree  with the Deputy Prime Minister that we  definitely\r\n\r\nvery  much frown upon those scholarship holders who break  their\r\n\r\nbonds, particularly those who do not even serve a single day  of\r\n\r\ntheir  bond.  But  my point really is to ask whether  naming  of\r\n\r\nthe  bond-breakers would serve the purpose.   Because  when  you\r\n\r\nsend  a student overseas, there is a risk that in three to  five\r\n\r\nyears  of  overseas stay, he might be affected by  the  overseas\r\n\r\nenvironment  and there may be other reasons for him not  wanting\r\n\r\nto  serve  his bond.  So I want to ask the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  there  are  other ways of doing it that  can  help  the\r\n\r\nprocess.   For  example, the pre-award procedures  can  help  to\r\n\r\neducate  them.   Maybe  there should be  proper  counselling  or\r\n\r\nnational  education.  Maybe the selection process of scholarship\r\n\r\napplicants  can be a bit more rigid to make sure  that  you  can\r\n\r\nsieve  out  those  who are very mercenary in their  approach  of\r\n\r\ngoing  for  scholarships.  Perhaps that may  be  considered.   I\r\n\r\nthought it was also not quite in line with the new approach that\r\n\r\nwe  are  going to have about the Government's lighter  touch  in\r\n\r\nnaming the bond-breakers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Exempted Business Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the consent of Mr Speaker and the general assent of\r\n\r\nMembers present, Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the Ministerial Statement today by\r\n\r\nthe Deputy Prime Minister be continued beyond 1.30 pm.

My daughter did not go  on  a  Government\r\n\r\nscholarship.  He challenged me, \"Would you ask your daughter  to\r\n\r\nresign?\"  At that stage, the meeting was bad.  Certainly, anyone\r\n\r\nin  my  shoes, with three very senior civil servants challenging\r\n\r\nme,  would say things that one may not respond otherwise.  But I\r\n\r\ntake  the DPM's point that I may not have given the best answers\r\n\r\nat  that  meeting.  I admit it.  But I just  want  to  give  the\r\n\r\ncontext of the atmosphere I was in, and why the reply was given.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B.

But  what\r\n\r\nemerges from all this exchange, and it seems to me, is that  the\r\n\r\nChairman  of the EDB was telling Mr Chng Hee Kok and  making  it\r\n\r\nclear  that it was Government policy to hold these bond  holders\r\n\r\nand  that  if he felt very strongly about this, then perhaps  he\r\n\r\nshould  resign.  I do not see what is wrong with that.  Will  Mr\r\n\r\nChng Hee Kok now consider resigning from the Party?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just to respond to Mr\r\n\r\nLeong Horn Kee on what we do to discourage bond-breakers.  He is\r\n\r\nright  that  if  you  just  toss  a  young  man  into  an  alien\r\n\r\nenvironment  and  leave him there for three, four  years,  after\r\n\r\nquite  a short while, his views will be influenced and you  will\r\n\r\nfind  you  have a different person on your hands.  Many  parents\r\n\r\nhave  found that when they send their children overseas.  So  we\r\n\r\ntake a lot of trouble to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmake  sure that, firstly, we choose the right people.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nwe explain to them the nature of their obligation which they are\r\n\r\nentering  into.  Thirdly, to keep in touch with them while  they\r\n\r\nare overseas.  And finally, if they have particular problems  or\r\n\r\nneeds,  to address these, and do our utmost to accommodate  them\r\n\r\nso that there is a fit for them and a fit for the organisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not just take scholarship applicants off the streets.\r\n\r\nPSC  organises  a scholarship seminar every year in  January  or\r\n\r\nFebruary  for  JC 2 students and their parents, because  parents\r\n\r\nare  a  critical part of this.  And at the seminar, PSC scholars\r\n\r\nwho  have  started work, we will brief them about their  careers\r\n\r\nand  the different PSC scholarships.  In other words, the  older\r\n\r\ngeneration  of  scholars will come and explain  to  the  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration what they can expect.  And the larger Ministries  are\r\n\r\nalso  invited to set up information booths at the  seminar.   So\r\n\r\nyou get a sense before you apply, what it is about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally before a scholar accepts a PSC scholarship, PSC\r\n\r\nstaff  will meet him or her to answer any queries he or she  has\r\n\r\nabout  the  public sector career.  And where it is  appropriate,\r\n\r\nPSC  will ask some officers from the relevant Ministry  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe  scholar,  normally  to  provide further  information.   And\r\n\r\nstudents are advised to think very carefully before accepting  a\r\n\r\nscholarship offer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, PSC runs a mid-course scholarship programme for\r\n\r\nscholars  in their second or third year.  The programme includes\r\n\r\na  two-week attachment with the potential Ministry.  In the case\r\n\r\nof  Mr  Hector  Yee,  you will see from the chronology,  he  was\r\n\r\nawarded the scholarship in 1995, 2.5 years ago.  In 1996, he  was\r\n\r\nattached  for a summer attachment to NCB and it was in  November\r\n\r\n1997  when  the idea of continuing on to graduate school  arose.\r\n\r\nSo  we do make the utmost effort in order to manage the scholars\r\n\r\non a constructive and proper path, but unfortunately it does not\r\n\r\nalways work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the lighter touch, we are looking for a softer touch\r\n\r\nin our hands, not gone soft in our heads.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> May I ask the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  for clarification on more  general  points.   I\r\n\r\nthink  this  has  wider implications.  The  first  clarification\r\n\r\nrelates  to the third line, third paragraph of Hector  Yee's  e-mail.  If I may, Mr Speaker, read out the line:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With the departure of ITI and the restructuring of NCB\r\n\r\nfrom  \"builder\" to \"architect\", I realized that my goal of doing\r\n\r\nresearch can no longer be properly fulfilled.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask the Deputy Prime Minister to clarify whether this\r\n\r\nis  true  that the organisational mission of the NCB has changed\r\n\r\nfrom  the  time of scholarship to the time of the bond  breaking\r\n\r\nand,  if  so,  the  more general point is  that  the  Government\r\n\r\nagency's  mission has changed.  Does he see this as a legitimate\r\n\r\nground  for  the  scholar  to  change  his  mind?   I  ask  this\r\n\r\nparticularly  because the Deputy Prime Minister earlier  on  had\r\n\r\nsaid there were legitimate and not legitimate reasons to break a\r\n\r\nbond, which is why not all scholars are named.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second general point I wish to ask the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister to clarify is how far this condemnation of morality and\r\n\r\nintegrity runs.  Naming the bond-breakers is one thing.   May  I\r\n\r\nask  the  Government to clarify if, beyond naming, there  is  in\r\n\r\nfact  a black list that people who are viewed in this way should\r\n\r\nforget the prospects of joining Government agencies in future or\r\n\r\nseek Government jobs?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, on the ITI and\r\n\r\nthe mission change.  I am not a lawyer, but it is a principle of\r\n\r\nlaw that you never answer hypothetical questions.  In this case,\r\n\r\nit  does  not apply because NCB has always had its role  as  the\r\n\r\n\"architect\"  with  ITI as a separate arm under NCB,  responsible\r\n\r\nfor  \"building\".  ITI was just one of the places where Mr Hector\r\n\r\nYee could have been deployed.  It had not been discussed but  it\r\n\r\nwas  possible, or he could have gone to ISS, a separate research\r\n\r\ninstitute which is not in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNCB,  or  he could have gone to university, for which there  are\r\n\r\nalso precedents.  So the fact that ITI has been moved out of NCB\r\n\r\nand  merged  with  ISS  in  no way constrains  the  universe  of\r\n\r\npossibilities which were open to Mr Hector Yee when  he  returns\r\n\r\nto Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you go on a scholarship to learn to become a doctor and\r\n\r\nserve  the Ministry of Health, and you find that when  you  come\r\n\r\nhome,  it has turned into the Ministry of Community Development,\r\n\r\nthat  is  another matter.  When it comes, we will  have  another\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for what we do with scholars who have broken their\r\n\r\nbonds,  the  answer is: in general, we will not  re-employ  them\r\n\r\nwithin  the  bond  period,  unless  there  are  exceptional   or\r\n\r\nextenuating   circumstances.   Because  the  non-fulfilment   of\r\n\r\nobligatory  service  suggests a lack of responsibility,  but  we\r\n\r\nwill study each case carefully on its own merits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for scholars from statutory boards and other\r\n\r\norganisations,  including those from  the  private  sector,  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service will not recruit candidates under a bond  without\r\n\r\nthe  agreement of the organisation to transfer the bond  to  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service.  For example, there was one case where Singapore\r\n\r\nTechnologies  agreed to transfer the bond to the  Administrative\r\n\r\nService.   In  another  case,  DBS Bank  refused  to  allow  the\r\n\r\ntransfer for one of its scholars.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I think the examples the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  brought up, DBS Bank and Singapore Technologies,  both\r\n\r\nrelated  to  scholars  who  were presently  under  bond  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies.  Perhaps I was not clear the  first  time.\r\n\r\nMy question relates more to those who actually break their bonds\r\n\r\nin  ways  the  Government agencies do not accept or illegitimate\r\n\r\nbond  breakers.   Earlier, the Deputy Prime Minister  said  that\r\n\r\nthere  may  be  good reasons for people to break  bonds.

These bond breakers  are\r\n\r\nscholars.   They are the cream of the population, and they  have\r\n\r\nundergone  perhaps 12 years of our education  system.  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether   something has gone wrong somewhere  in  our  education\r\n\r\nsystem,  bringing up end products such as students who blatantly\r\n\r\nbreak their bonds.  One would imagine that they would have  some\r\n\r\nvalues, to think the matter over seriously before breaking their\r\n\r\nbonds.  Despite many meetings and warnings, they still break the\r\n\r\nbonds.  It shows clearly that there is something basically wrong\r\n\r\nwith  our education system.  The right values are not inculcated\r\n\r\nin our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Chiam has a valid\r\n\r\npoint, but he overstates it.  We have to work harder at national\r\n\r\neducation, moral education, inculcating in our young people, not\r\n\r\njust  facts  but  values, so that they know what  is  right  and\r\n\r\nwrong.   We  have  tried hard to do this, especially  in  recent\r\n\r\nyears.   We do not always succeed.  There is always a  range  of\r\n\r\nresponses,  and  even  in the most ideal system,  not  everybody\r\n\r\nresponds to enlightened precepts, because they just do not  sink\r\n\r\nin.   Also,  it is the mood of the times.  If you are  facing  a\r\n\r\ngreat upheaval and tumult, and your stomach is hungry, as is the\r\n\r\ncase  in  some  countries in this region now, you  will  not  be\r\n\r\nthinking of doing computer graphics or something like that.  You\r\n\r\nwill  be  thinking of the family back home and how to  fend  for\r\n\r\nthem, not just family but friends, relatives, your country.   We\r\n\r\nare  no  longer  in  that position, but we have  to  keep  these\r\n\r\nvalues,  the sense of service and moral obligation, so  that  we\r\n\r\ncan hold together as one nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I was a school teacher for over 10\r\n\r\nyears.  What I learned was that the best way to teach the  right\r\n\r\nvalues  to  the  students is by example.  I think  the  teachers\r\n\r\nthemselves have to set\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  example  and the tone.  I wonder whether our Ministers  are\r\n\r\nsetting the right examples and the right tone.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if Mr Chiam thinks\r\n\r\nthat  he  can  produce  a  better team of  Ministers  either  in\r\n\r\nSingapore or anywhere else in the region or in the world, it  is\r\n\r\nup to him to  try to do it and convince the population.  Anybody\r\n\r\nwhom  we  bring  into the leadership team is  somebody  whom  we\r\n\r\nbelieve  can make more than that, many times over, outside.   We\r\n\r\nhave to bring them in and they have to be willing to serve.  And\r\n\r\nif  they were not willing to serve, you could pay them a million\r\n\r\ndollars and they would not be here today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Chiam should stick to his original point. He\r\n\r\nhas been a teacher.  He knows that not all his students pass his\r\n\r\nexaminations.   But  this is a very serious matter  and  one  on\r\n\r\nwhich,   not   just   the   political   leadership,   but    the\r\n\r\nadministration, the civil service, the teachers  and  the  young\r\n\r\npeople  must understand where they stand, and what is right  and\r\n\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SUPPLY AND SUPPLEMENTARY SUPPLY BILLS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Business Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, notwithstanding the Standing Orders, the second and\r\n\r\nthird  readings  of  the  Supply  Bill  for  FY  98/99  and  the\r\n\r\nSupplementary  Supply Bill for FY 97/98 may  be  proceeded  with\r\n\r\nimmediately after the conclusion of the proceedings on the  Main\r\n\r\nand  Development  Estimates for FY 98/99.

It is to continue to develop Singapore  into  a\r\n\r\ndynamic, vibrant city state, an important node in the network of\r\n\r\nglobal  cities  such  as  New York  and  London.   However,  the\r\n\r\nannouncement  of  the foreign talent policy  has  set  off  some\r\n\r\ndisquiet  in  Singapore.  Concerns expressed range from  whether\r\n\r\nforeigners will take away our jobs, or our children's  jobs,  to\r\n\r\nwhether this will result in landed property and cars being  even\r\n\r\nmore out of reach of the ordinary Singaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the importance of attracting foreign talent\r\n\r\ninto   Singapore  and  they  will  augment  our  limited   human\r\n\r\nresources.  This policy has benefited us in the past,  and  will\r\n\r\nbenefit us in the future.  Some of the foreign talent will leave\r\n\r\nafter a short stay while others will sink their roots here\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  obtain either permanent residence or Singapore citizenship.\r\n\r\nWhen  they  adopt citizenship, they are every bit a Singaporean,\r\n\r\nas those of us who are born and who grew up here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that part of this disquiet stems from uncertainty\r\n\r\nas  to  what  it  means to be a Singaporean as distinct  from  a\r\n\r\nforeigner  in Singapore.  What are the rights and privileges  of\r\n\r\nSingapore citizenship?  Is it merely the right to vote?   Is  it\r\n\r\neligibility  for subsidized HDB housing?  But what  about  those\r\n\r\nwhose  income  levels are above the ceiling and do not  qualify?\r\n\r\nDoes  it  include  the promise of Government funding  for  basic\r\n\r\neducation  and retraining so that local talent can be  developed\r\n\r\nand  fulfilled, utilized to its maximum potential?  What are the\r\n\r\nobligations  and  responsibilities  of  citizenship?    National\r\n\r\nservice for men?  Is it more than that?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Government to define the parameters in\r\n\r\norder  to  give the discussion a better focus.  While  welcoming\r\n\r\nforeign  talent and making it easier for them to work  and  live\r\n\r\nhere, the  Government should also spell out at the same time the\r\n\r\nprivileges   and  responsibilities  of  Singapore   citizenship.\r\n\r\nForeign  talent and citizenship are two sides of the same  coin.\r\n\r\nBoth   have   important  contributions  to  make  to  Singapore,\r\n\r\neconomically, socially and culturally. Both define  the  essence\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, its cosmopolitanism, its ancientness, that  which\r\n\r\nmakes our country and culture uniquely Singapore.  The Singapore 21  \r\n\r\nCommittee, of which I am a member, will consider this issue.\r\n\r\nBut  it  would be good if the Government could, at  some  point,\r\n\r\nelaborate on what it means to be a Singaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> The importance of overseeing the\r\n\r\nnational   talent  pool  by  ensuring  continuous   inflow   and\r\n\r\nintegration of desirable foreign talent and retention  of  local\r\n\r\ntalent  cannot  be  overstated.   For  a  country  with  limited\r\n\r\nresources, it is even more urgent, as in Singapore.  Thus, I  am\r\n\r\nmost glad to see PMO spending more on its PSD's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  in  particular, its talent  management  programmes.\r\n\r\nThe  holistic approach in terms of attracting and retaining  the\r\n\r\nright talent, the SDU in promoting marriage among graduates  and\r\n\r\nformation of families, and the Personnel Guidance Unit's work in\r\n\r\nconducting  psychometric  and  other  assessment  procedures  to\r\n\r\nassist the civil service in selection, placement and development\r\n\r\nof  staff, is commendable.  It is very relevant to what we  just\r\n\r\ndiscussed  in  terms of scholars and bonds.  It should  help  to\r\n\r\nminimise the problem of attrition and enhance retention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But PSD must be aware of the growing competition for such\r\n\r\ntalents  from  other  countries.   As  globalisation  grows   in\r\n\r\nimportance  and Asia's economy gets plugged in a bigger  way  to\r\n\r\nthe  west,  particularly the US, the latter will be looking  for\r\n\r\nmore  Asian  talent.  Prime talent from Singapore will  be  much\r\n\r\nmore  in  demand.   In fact, it comes with a premium.   For  our\r\n\r\nscholars keen on R&D, our budding R&D facilities may not be able\r\n\r\nto  match.   Bill  Gates and his type will be  hungry  for  such\r\n\r\ntalents,  as  his giant business grows.  That is our  challenge.\r\n\r\nHow  does  the  PMO  and PSD intend to meet that  challenge  and\r\n\r\ncompetition for talent?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSD should look into possible strategic and collaborative\r\n\r\nalliances  in the competition for that limited talent worldwide.\r\n\r\nWhile  the  more  than  18% increase in  the  talent  management\r\n\r\nprogramme  is impressive, it may not be sufficient to match  the\r\n\r\ngrowing competition.  Expose more of our better brains with  the\r\n\r\nbest  in the world to allow better flexibility in retaining  the\r\n\r\nmuch  needed  brains trust for the civil service  and  even  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector through the statutory boards and the GLCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I want to speak on bond breakers. When I\r\n\r\nfiled  this  amendment, Sir, I did not realise that  this  topic\r\n\r\nwill  be  so  hotly debated in this House and  I  also  did  not\r\n\r\nrealise that some Members were bond breakers themselves and they\r\n\r\nseem  to have some personal interest in it.  We also heard  this\r\n\r\nafternoon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na lengthy Ministerial Statement on this issue.  The question is:\r\n\r\nare the bond breakers wrong in doing so?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purely, from the legal point of view, they have committed\r\n\r\nno  wrong.   They just have to pay damages, as has been  pointed\r\n\r\nout.   Like  other  Members,  I  think  they  do  have  a  moral\r\n\r\nobligation.  They are morally obligated to carry out their bond.\r\n\r\nOn  the other hand, I would also stress that, in fact, the  bond\r\n\r\ngivers themselves also have a moral responsibility.  They should\r\n\r\nnot  impose  harsh and onerous terms on the scholars.   We  have\r\n\r\nheard  the  hon. Member for Bishan-Toa Payoh that he  served  10\r\n\r\nyears  of  the  bond before he broke it.  I  take  it  that  the\r\n\r\nMember's  bond  lasted  longer than 10 years.   I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nutterly  wrong to be tied down for 10 years.  A 10-year bond  is\r\n\r\ndefinitely  too  long.  Such a contract is  harsh  and  onerous.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances, I can understand why scholars want  to\r\n\r\nbreak their bonds.  It is said that in every action there  is  a\r\n\r\nreaction.    If  harsh  and  onerous  terms  were  imposed,  the\r\n\r\nreaction  of scholars would be to try to get out of the contract\r\n\r\nat  the first opportunity.  The givers of scholarship have  also\r\n\r\nto be fair and equitable in their attempts to bind recipients of\r\n\r\nthe scholarship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time, a scholar had to serve a bond period\r\n\r\nequivalent to the number of years he spent overseas to  complete\r\n\r\nhis  course.  I believe this can be a criterion, but subject  to\r\n\r\nnot  more  than  four  years' bonding of scholars.   I  think  a\r\n\r\nmaximum bond period should not exceed four years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue is: why do our scholars break their bond?\r\n\r\nAs  I  have mentioned, they are the cream of the population.   I\r\n\r\nwould urge the Government to look into our education system  and\r\n\r\nalso  the  Ministers themselves should look at  what  they  have\r\n\r\ndone, whether they have set a high standard for our young people\r\n\r\nto follow.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will\r\n\r\nallow  me,  I  just would like to share a few comments  from  my\r\n\r\nperspective as a scholar or one who had the privilege of  taking\r\n\r\na Government scholarship.  I think DPM has given a very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nextensive  account and I believe that the force of his arguments\r\n\r\nis   particularly  strong  in  the  context  of  civil   service\r\n\r\nscholarships.   We  need  to invoke  the  spirit  and  value  of\r\n\r\nnoblesse oblige  that privilege entails responsibility, and with\r\n\r\nGovernment scholarships, I firmly believe this is true for three\r\n\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, they are funded by tax dollars contributed by DREs\r\n\r\nthrough  to  CEOs.  Second, because it is a privilege  that  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore are bestowing on a scholar, it is not just a\r\n\r\nmanpower  recruitment  device.  Third,  it  is  given  with  the\r\n\r\nexpectation and hope that the scholars will come back and  serve\r\n\r\nin the long term for Singapore's interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this cannot be a simple financial calculation. It\r\n\r\nwould  do  Singapore or Singaporeans no good,  in  my  view,  if\r\n\r\nsomeone  comes back to serve simply because he cannot afford  to\r\n\r\nbreak  his  bond.  Today, it may be a cost-benefit  analysis  of\r\n\r\nwhether  they come back to serve an organisation.  Tomorrow,  it\r\n\r\nmay  be an economic analysis of whether it is worthwhile staying\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  But if a scholar has truly imbibed the value  of\r\n\r\nnoblesse  oblige, of wanting to serve, I think we would  have  a\r\n\r\nreal  national  asset in that individual, for  that  person  who\r\n\r\nserves  Singapore and Singaporeans.  In that spirit, I have  two\r\n\r\nsuggestions for the Deputy Prime Minister to consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, can more be done to imbue scholars with the values\r\n\r\nand  culture  of the civil service?  When I was a  scholar,  the\r\n\r\nfirst  contact I had was a note telling me I had been given  the\r\n\r\nscholarship  and  intermittent, during my study  period,  I  got\r\n\r\nletters asking for my results and progress.  And that was  about\r\n\r\nit.  I understand from the Deputy Prime Minister that things are\r\n\r\nmore  enlightened now.  Nevertheless, I think more can  be  done\r\n\r\nand, in particular, scholars would benefit immensely during  the\r\n\r\nperiod  of  study  if they have regular dialogue  sessions   and\r\n\r\ndiscussions with senior civil servants and Ministers.   I  think\r\n\r\nthis would give them a chance to appreciate first hand and learn\r\n\r\nfrom  role models what the civil service stands for and why they\r\n\r\nhave been selected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Sir, whilst we talk about bond breakers and\r\n\r\nhighlighting their questionable actions, I think it  is  equally\r\n\r\nimportant that we highlight the good role models. The focus  has\r\n\r\nbeen on a minority and a balance must be restored in this debate\r\n\r\nand  in  public  perception.  The best way is to demonstrate  by\r\n\r\nexample.   I  would urge the civil service and the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister to consider highlighting the many others who have  come\r\n\r\nback  and  who  have also had attractive alternatives  at  their\r\n\r\ndisposal,  but  they  have come back to  serve,  and  they  have\r\n\r\nsucceeded in their careers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> With your indulgence, Sir, I have\r\n\r\nthe  privilege of working with some of the senior and top  civil\r\n\r\nservants,  including Mr Lim Siong Guan and the Director  of  the\r\n\r\nCivil  Service  College,  Ms Lim Soo Hoon.   I  find  them  very\r\n\r\nbright,  very enlightened and very open-minded. The  development\r\n\r\nof  the higher echelon of the civil service, in fact, is in good\r\n\r\nhands.   But my attention is drawn to the question of  how  much\r\n\r\nattention is given to the lower echelon of the civil service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the privilege also of attending a joint seminar\r\n\r\nbetween  PSD  and  the public sector unions at  Batam  recently.\r\n\r\nThere  again, the experience was rewarding because it  gave  the\r\n\r\nopportunity between the higher echelon of the civil  service  to\r\n\r\ninteract  and  have  a  better  understanding  with  the   union\r\n\r\nrepresentatives.   So I would like to ask PMO  whether  in  fact\r\n\r\nmore  of  such opportunities could be provided so  as  to  allow\r\n\r\nbetter  interaction  and better understanding  of  each  other's\r\n\r\naspirations and also to allow the members of the civil  service,\r\n\r\nespecially those of the lower echelons, to feel that they are an\r\n\r\nimportant and an integrative part of the civil service, which we\r\n\r\nall  know  is  one  of  the  pillars of  the  success  story  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I would be\r\n\r\nmuch obliged if I can take the three cuts together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> The Government had earlier announced that\r\n\r\nthe retirement age will be raised from 60 to 62 from 1st January\r\n\r\n1999.   Sir,  before  legislation comes into effect,  there  are\r\n\r\nimportant  concerns  and issues in the civil service  employment\r\n\r\nand  salary structure that need to be addressed.  The  NTUC  and\r\n\r\nthe  unions have been discussing some of these concerns  and  we\r\n\r\nwould  like to raise some of these concerns for the Government's\r\n\r\nconsideration.  Basically, there are four main concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The principles which should be used on the wage cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The mode in which the wage cut should take place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Job out-placement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Alternative health care scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the first point. Given the Tripartite Committee on\r\n\r\nthe  Extension of Retirement Age guidelines, the  NTUC  and  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service unions would like to propose that the  Government\r\n\r\nadopts  a  wage  cut  for all officers, as  recommended  by  the\r\n\r\nTripartite  Committee.   This  may have  to  include  Superscale\r\n\r\nofficers.   However,  exceptions could be  given  based  on  the\r\n\r\nfollowing three broad principles:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Whether base-up wage system is already in place. Where\r\n\r\nwages reflect the actual job worth, then there may not be a need\r\n\r\nfor a wage cut; and this may apply to higher scales in the Upper\r\n\r\nTimescale and Superscale grades.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The supply of and demand for the services of the\r\n\r\nofficers concerned.  Where demand exceeds supply, implementing a\r\n\r\nwage cut would only aggravate the vacancy situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The changes in job responsibilities, before and after the\r\n\r\nage of 60.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in considering pay cuts, it must be noted that the up\r\n\r\nto  10% wage cut does not include the 3.5% cut in CPF.  In other\r\n\r\nwords,  it  is  actually up to 13.5% in  wage  cut.   The  civil\r\n\r\nservice  unions do not strongly object to this principle because\r\n\r\nthey know that it is costly for an employer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  employ  someone beyond the age of 60 when they can  actually\r\n\r\nemploy a much younger entrant into the workforce at lower  cost.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  unions  feel that the  cut  in  wages  should  be\r\n\r\neffected  through  the  annual wage component  rather  than  the\r\n\r\nmonthly  salaries.  However, the caveat is that if  one  resigns\r\n\r\nbefore the year is out, then pro-rated annual wage cuts must  be\r\n\r\nmade from the last drawn monthly salaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next, job out-placement. On job placement, the\r\n\r\nTripartite  Committee recommendations should  be  followed.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  I would like to urge the civil service to participate\r\n\r\nactively in the Skills Redevelopment Programme, an initiative of\r\n\r\nthe  NTUC.   However,  the   issue of  paying  for  payroll  and\r\n\r\ntraining costs from INTECH funds may have to be adjusted to suit\r\n\r\nthe financial procedures of the civil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already some very good initiatives have been made by the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  the  Environment  which  has  started  reskilling\r\n\r\nprogrammes for DRE workers, through the insistence of NTUC,  and\r\n\r\nusing  the  SRP funds.  But the fund principles may need  to  be\r\n\r\nfurther refined.  I urge that other Ministries be encouraged  to\r\n\r\nparticipate in the SRP actively for workers up to the age of 62.\r\n\r\nThis should especially be so because Dr Richard Hu had announced\r\n\r\nyesterday  that the SRP may be considered to become  a  national\r\n\r\nprogramme,  and when it becomes a national programme  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice must take the lead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the last point, the Alternate Healthcare Scheme,\r\n\r\nthe  unions  suggest  that  new employees  under  the  Alternate\r\n\r\nHealthcare  Scheme be given Medisave top-up of an additional  1%\r\n\r\nof  salary,  subject to a minimum of $15 and a maximum  of  $70.\r\n\r\nThe  MSO currently has a maximum of $70 but there is no minimum.\r\n\r\nI  would like to urge that a minimum of $15 be set, particularly\r\n\r\nto help the DRE workers whose pay is generally very, very low.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I just want to end by saying that I would like to\r\n\r\nemphasise that until we are able to resolve these issues, it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult for the public sector or the civil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice to raise the retirement age before 1st January 1999.  We\r\n\r\nneed to step up the pace of the union-management discussion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second cut is on union representation. While\r\n\r\nunion membership is declining in most parts of the world, it  is\r\n\r\nincreasing  steadily  in  Singapore.  This  is  because  of  the\r\n\r\npragmatic approach and the right kind of leadership and policies\r\n\r\nadopted  by  the  Singapore NTUC.  It is  also  because  of  the\r\n\r\nrecognition by the PAP Government of the positive role  of  NTUC\r\n\r\nand  its  affiliated  unions.  In many  other  countries,  union\r\n\r\nleaders  and  Government  leaders  or  the  union  leaders   and\r\n\r\nemployers  will never sit down together and have a peaceful  cup\r\n\r\nof  coffee.  However, in Singapore, union leaders, employers and\r\n\r\nGovernment  leaders  meet very frequently  in  both  formal  and\r\n\r\ninformal settings and discuss and resolve issues that arise from\r\n\r\ntime to time in a spirit of mutual trust and cooperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The profile of our workforce has changed rapidly in\r\n\r\nSingapore  because  of  rapid improvements  in  education.   For\r\n\r\nexample, 20% of each cohort attains a university education;  40%\r\n\r\na  polytechnic education; and 25% a post-secondary education  at\r\n\r\nITE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the profile of the workforce who can join\r\n\r\nunions  has  altered somewhat over the years.  To address  this,\r\n\r\nthe  NTUC  introduced the General Branch Membership.   The  NTUC\r\n\r\nleadership has also set a rule of thumb that at least 80% of the\r\n\r\nworkforce  can  join  the union as an ordinary  member  and  the\r\n\r\nremaining 20% can join as a General Branch member, depending  on\r\n\r\nthe  position that they hold in the organisation.  For  example,\r\n\r\nvery  confidential senior staff in a company may choose  not  to\r\n\r\njoin  as  a General Branch member because, from the management's\r\n\r\nperspective, it might be seen as inappropriate.  And rightly so,\r\n\r\nit is their prerogative.

BG Lee.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, Members have raised several\r\n\r\npoints.  First, Dr Lee Tsao Yuan asks what does it mean to be  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think what it means to be a Singaporean can be\r\n\r\nreduced to dollars and cents, subsidy here, grant there, shares,\r\n\r\nasset  top-up, or whatever, therefore so many thousand  dollars.\r\n\r\nIt  is an identification with Singapore.  You belong here,  this\r\n\r\nis  your  country,  you  will fight for it,  you  determine  its\r\n\r\nfuture,  together with other citizens.  That is how we became  a\r\n\r\ncountry,  fighting for independence, first, during the  Japanese\r\n\r\noccupation;  then  the  British  colonial  government;  then  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia;  now  out.  And that is how you have  to  survive,  by\r\n\r\nidentifying yourself with the country and feeling that  this  is\r\n\r\nwhere  you  belong and this is where your responsibilities  are.\r\n\r\nWe  have  a very long discussion on this just now and I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink we need to go into\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  lot more details again.  I think that many Singaporeans  know\r\n\r\nthat whilst foreigners will come and compete with them for cars,\r\n\r\nhouses  and  jobs,  we  are still better off  having  them  here\r\n\r\nworking with us, than not having them here, and having Singapore\r\n\r\na  thinner  talent pool, a less vibrant economy.  You  can  have\r\n\r\ncheap land, but your incomes are going to be low and you are not\r\n\r\ngoing to be able to afford cars or grand houses either.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is not a matter of dollars and cents. It is a matter\r\n\r\nof  intangibles,  of  rooted-ness and  feel.   And  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  21 Committee, which is looking into this issue,  will\r\n\r\ntake such an approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on talent management. Mr Zainul Abidin has asked\r\n\r\nwhat  we  do  to  work harder to attract talent into  our  civil\r\n\r\nservice.  First, we must have competitive terms, challenging job\r\n\r\nopportunities,  good  work environment,  and  systematic  talent\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  So good people will come, they will stay, and they\r\n\r\nwill  rise.  And we will develop them as they go.  We will  make\r\n\r\nsure  that our terms and conditions are competitive, and we make\r\n\r\nsure  that  this  applies not just to a  small  elite  group  of\r\n\r\nscholars  or  administrative officers but  to  the  whole  civil\r\n\r\nservice,  whether  you  are  an  administrative  officer  or   a\r\n\r\nprofessional  officer, a clerk, or somebody looking  after  some\r\n\r\nother  responsibilities.  We will make sure we  treat  each  one\r\n\r\nindividually  well,  feedback on performance,  and  give  timely\r\n\r\nrecognition in terms of promotions, bonuses, national awards, in\r\n\r\naccordance with performance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul Abidin also asks about improving the quality of\r\n\r\ncivil  service.  Continuous learning and training is indeed  one\r\n\r\nof our priorities and not just at the top, but all the way down.\r\n\r\nAnd  we  have made a special effort to make sure that  we  reach\r\n\r\ndown with programmes which are relevant to Division II, Division\r\n\r\nIII,  and Division IV officers.  For example, over the last  six\r\n\r\nmonths  it  has  introduced four new programmes  for  the  lower\r\n\r\ndivision   staff,  including  English,  writing   and   personal\r\n\r\neffectiveness courses aimed at Division III and IV officers.  We\r\n\r\nare now working on a programme to complement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITs  and the Staff Suggestions Scheme to bring out the creative\r\n\r\nspirit amongst the civil servants, to encourage them to open  up\r\n\r\nand  speak  up,  and  contribute.  And we are  also  working  on\r\n\r\nanother  language programme to help Division IV officers achieve\r\n\r\n`N'  and  `O'  level English standards.  Both the  creative  and\r\n\r\nlanguage programmes should be ready in the next financial  year.\r\n\r\nSo we are working on developing more opportunities for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On scholars and bonds raised by Mr Chiam and Mr Iswaran, I\r\n\r\ndo  not propose to respond in any detail.  Indeed, scholars have\r\n\r\nto  be morally obliged to serve and their sponsors have to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that the terms are not onerous.  And indeed that has  been\r\n\r\nour  policy  -  to make sure that pay is competitive,  that  the\r\n\r\nopportunities are competitive, and it is not just money, but you\r\n\r\ncome in, you have a fulfilling career and standing, and you  are\r\n\r\ndoing something which you are proud of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular dialogues, highlighting role models, imbuing people\r\n\r\nwith  the correct values and cultures, as Mr Iswaran has pointed\r\n\r\nout,  we have improved, but we can do still better, and we  will\r\n\r\ntry to improve further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan's point, first, on extension of the\r\n\r\nretirement  age.   Mr Sinnakaruppan has explained  many  of  the\r\n\r\nthings  being  done  by the Tripartite Committee  studying  this\r\n\r\nmatter.   It is a very complex subject.  In principle,  we  have\r\n\r\ndecided to extend to 62.  In practice, when you want to work out\r\n\r\nthe  implementation details, it becomes very, very  complicated.\r\n\r\nHow  do you implement a pay cut?  It cannot be across the board,\r\n\r\nwithout  modulation,  because it depends on  the  circumstances,\r\n\r\nwhat  are  the principles by which you will vary it,  and  these\r\n\r\nhave  to  be worked out, not just academically but in  agreement\r\n\r\nwith  the  unions, so all parties acknowledge that the basis  is\r\n\r\nfair and workable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are studying the proposals and we are currently\r\n\r\ndiscussing with the unions how to implement it.  If we can do it\r\n\r\nbefore  1st January 1999, we will do so.  But I am not confident\r\n\r\nthat we will be able to do it very easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On union membership, I have told this House before that\r\n\r\ncivil  servants are allowed to take up union membership as  long\r\n\r\nas they meet the membership rules of unions, and there is no bar\r\n\r\non Division I officers joining civil service unions, unless they\r\n\r\nhave been specifically designated as such.  There are staff  who\r\n\r\nare handling sensitive and confidential personnel portfolios, or\r\n\r\nwho have direct influence and authority over personnel decision-making,  or  are  involved  in  labour-management  actions   and\r\n\r\npolicies  and may hesitate over the propriety of becoming  union\r\n\r\nmembers.  Because you have to act entirely impartially,  and  it\r\n\r\nhas yet to be tested whether if you are a union member and there\r\n\r\nis  a fellow union member, it is going to be workable for one to\r\n\r\ndiscipline  the  other.   It  could  be  an  awkward  situation,\r\n\r\nresulting in potential conflict of interests or divided  loyalty\r\n\r\nand  representing  the  employers when dealing  with  unions  on\r\n\r\nspecific  issues.  We are now working out the rules  to  clarify\r\n\r\nthe   position  of  this  group  of  officers  to  minimise  the\r\n\r\nlikelihood of conflicting duties and interests.  I can be candid\r\n\r\nand  explain to the Member that one of the areas where  this  is\r\n\r\nmost  tricky to do is the teaching service because traditionally\r\n\r\nteachers  and  principals have been union members.   But  as  we\r\n\r\ndevolve  more and more powers to school clusters and to schools,\r\n\r\nand to principals, more and more principals who used just to  be\r\n\r\nadministering,    now    have    management    and     personnel\r\n\r\nresponsibilities over the teachers in their schools.   And  this\r\n\r\nwill  cause  some difficulty.  We are studying the  matter.   We\r\n\r\nhave not quite decided, but we will do.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sinnakaruppan, your third amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, this base-up wage system has been\r\n\r\nrecommended  to  address the problems caused by  the  seniority-based wage system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the civil service already has many features of the\r\n\r\nbase-up  wage  system in its present day salary structure.   But\r\n\r\nthere are still some areas that need to be addressed.

The  desirable  minimum-maximum  ratios  would, in general, be different  for  different\r\n\r\njobs.   One possibility is to have different ratios for jobs  at\r\n\r\nthe different Division or job grade as follows: for Division  I,\r\n\r\nit  could  be  1.8; for Division II, it could be  1.6;  and  for\r\n\r\nDivisions  III and IV, it could be 1.5.  The exact ratios  would\r\n\r\nhave  to  be ascertained from job evaluation or market  surveys.\r\n\r\nBut  this  is  the proposal that the civil service unions  would\r\n\r\nlike to put up to PMO.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I will be very short. While credit\r\n\r\nmust  go to the political leaders for our achievements, I  think\r\n\r\nthe  role  of civil servants in assisting Ministers in achieving\r\n\r\nGovernment's  promise cannot be understated.  I would  urge  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister to try to get more people from outside  to  join\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service for two to three years.

His conclusion:\r\n\r\n\"The  first  way  for  a state to lose its  independence  is  to\r\n\r\nneglect  its  defences.\"  And his advice: \"The foundation  of  a\r\n\r\nstate  is  a good military organisation.\"  In other words,  Sir,\r\n\r\nneglect  defence at your own peril, especially for  small  city-states like Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is Machiavelli from the West. And from the East, we\r\n\r\nhave Sun Tzu who wrote The Art of War in the fourth century B.C.\r\n\r\nAnd  in  the opening paragraph of his book, he proclaimed  that:\r\n\r\n\"Defence  is  a  matter of vital importance to  the  state,  the\r\n\r\nprovince  of life or death; the road to survival or ruin.\"   Sun\r\n\r\nTzu's  formula is not for going into battle per se, but to build\r\n\r\nup  our defences in peacetime, and deploy them in such a way  as\r\n\r\nto  prevail, overwhelm or deter the enemy by strategic  planning\r\n\r\nand  deployment, or what we will call today, deterrence, balance\r\n\r\nof power or the indirect approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are in the tail-end of the 20th century. It is a\r\n\r\ntime  of  changes and uncertainties in Asia Pacific, a  time  of\r\n\r\nparadigm  shifts in the strategic environment.  It is  the  most\r\n\r\nchallenging of times; it is the most unsettling.  It is as if we\r\n\r\nwere\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  birth  pangs  of  a new era.  The  point  is  that  the\r\n\r\nunexpected  does  happen in history.  Few  predicted,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\ncollapse of the Berlin Wall or the collapse of the Soviet  Union\r\n\r\nor the outbreak of the Gulf War.  We must therefore in Singapore\r\n\r\nprepare ourselves for the worst turn of events, while hoping for\r\n\r\nthe best.  We must expect the unexpected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will do well, Sir, to remember Athens, which despite its\r\n\r\naffluence  and  excellence, lost to Sparta in the  Peloponnesian\r\n\r\nWar.   A  democratic and commercial Athens was vanquished  by  a\r\n\r\nmilitaristic  Sparta.   Athens  fell  because  of  the  lack  of\r\n\r\nmilitary  preparation.  We, in Singapore, should draw  a  lesson\r\n\r\nfrom  the city states like Florence and Athens.  We should avoid\r\n\r\nbeing  driven  or consumed by materialism and we  should  never,\r\n\r\nnever neglect defence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can also draw a lesson from World War II with regard to\r\n\r\ndefence closer to home.  We know that on 15th February 1942,  it\r\n\r\nwas  a  day of infamy for the British.  On that day, the British\r\n\r\nsurrendered to the Japanese at the Ford factory at Bukit  Timah.\r\n\r\nAs  Winston  Churchill, the British Prime Minister  declared  at\r\n\r\nthat  time, it was the `worst disaster'.  It was too  late,  too\r\n\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Government in Singapore is giving high\r\n\r\npriority   to  defence.   My  question  is:  in  view   of   the\r\n\r\nuncertainties in the region and the unpredictable turn of events\r\n\r\nand  the  nature of events, are the funds allocated for  defence\r\n\r\nsufficient?   If the Minister considers they are inadequate,  we\r\n\r\nwill  be happy to oblige and support his appeal for more  funds.\r\n\r\nAfter  all, the defence allocations will amount to 4.6%  of  the\r\n\r\nGDP,  still well below the cap of 6% of GDP declared earlier  by\r\n\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Chinese proverb puts it:\r\n\r\n(yang  bing  qian ri, yong zai yi zhao) \"Train  an  army  for  a\r\n\r\nthousand days, for use on the day of need of crisis.\"   We  just\r\n\r\ncannot wait for the crisis to happen and then pour our resources\r\n\r\nor  funds  in.   We  cannot  build and  train  an  armed  forces\r\n\r\novernight.  It will be too little and too late.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are all for defence. But we also want to know that\r\n\r\nthe  defence dollars, or indeed the taxpayers' dollars  will  be\r\n\r\nwell spent.  We want to know whether the defence expenditure  is\r\n\r\ncost  effective,  whether  we are getting  good  value  for  the\r\n\r\nhardware  we  purchased.  I wish therefore to ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  he would elaborate on the measures to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\ndefence  funds are maximised in terms of cost effectiveness  and\r\n\r\nthe judicious mix and selection of hardware.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, as mentioned by the\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the GPC for Defence, our long standing  policy  on\r\n\r\ndefence  expenditure has been to cap it at 6% of our GDP.   This\r\n\r\nwould  have  been  an  adequate level as  long  as  the  economy\r\n\r\ncontinues  its healthy growth enabling our expenditure  to  keep\r\n\r\npace  with  inflationary  increases  without  compromising   the\r\n\r\nquality of training and equipment of our armed forces.  However,\r\n\r\nwith  the economy now facing uncertainty as a result of regional\r\n\r\ncrisis,  our GDP growth is projected to slow down.   This  would\r\n\r\nhave  a  direct and immediate impact on our defence  expenditure\r\n\r\nwhich will decline correspondingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, development of a well-trained and competent defence\r\n\r\nforce  and  the acquisition of defence assets are usually  long-term  processes.  If we subject our defence expenditure  to  the\r\n\r\nmercy   of   economic  cycles,  we  may  be   compromising   the\r\n\r\neffectiveness  of the SAF in building up and maintaining  itself\r\n\r\nas  a credible defence force.  Having a strong defence force  is\r\n\r\nessential not only for our national sovereignty but also for our\r\n\r\ncontinued  economic  well-being.   Foreign  investors  are  here\r\n\r\nbecause we offer them a safe, secure and stable haven for  their\r\n\r\nmulti-million dollar investments.  The relationship between  our\r\n\r\nsovereignty, our prosperity and our stability is an  indivisible\r\n\r\none and a strong SAF is the linchpin in this situation.  Because\r\n\r\nwithout  a strong SAF to protect our sovereignty, stability  and\r\n\r\nprosperity  all  talk  about  more  money  being  allocated   to\r\n\r\neducation, workers' training, healthcare, social welfare or even\r\n\r\nhelping the businesses would merely be academic.

But  the  best  defence technology,  equipment  and\r\n\r\ntraining do not come cheap.  However, in order to ensure that we\r\n\r\ncontinue to live in peace with everybody, we must be prepared to\r\n\r\ndefend  ourselves against anybody and that nobody  should  doubt\r\n\r\nthat  Singaporeans have the capability and the  will  to  defend\r\n\r\nthemselves  if  the  need arises.    I would therefore  like  to\r\n\r\nrequest the Minister for Defence to review the 6% of GDP cap  on\r\n\r\nour defence expenditure to ensure that the SAF will continue  to\r\n\r\nhave  the  best defence technology, equipment and training  even\r\n\r\nduring economically troubled times and especially during periods\r\n\r\nof uncertainty.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have always\r\n\r\nunderstood  our  defence  philosophy  to  be  premised  on   the\r\n\r\nprinciple  that the best assurance for peace and  stability  and\r\n\r\nsafety  in our country is deterrence.  Although we are  a  small\r\n\r\ncountry,  we have over the years invested much of our  resources\r\n\r\nin  developing  the SAF into an effective and credible  fighting\r\n\r\nforce.   The SAF today is a modern, balanced and well-integrated\r\n\r\ntri-service  armed force that is capable and willing  to  defend\r\n\r\nSingapore  when called upon.  To use an analogy  shared  by  our\r\n\r\nPrime Minister some time ago, although we may be a small shrimp,\r\n\r\nwe  are  at least a very poisonous one.  Any potential aggressor\r\n\r\nwill  have to think twice or many times over when taking us  on.\r\n\r\nAnd   our   defence  philosophy  has  served   us   well   since\r\n\r\nIndependence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note that in the Budget this year, we have increased\r\n\r\nour  spending  on defence.  To many, it seems strange  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  spending so much on defence when  faced  with  a\r\n\r\ndifficult economic climate ahead.  Is it prudent that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  should be maintaining our defence expenditure at this  level\r\n\r\nwhen we should be cutting back and saving our resources?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say at the onset that I do not subscribe to the view\r\n\r\nthat we should cut back on defence spending.  In fact, I support\r\n\r\nour  proposed expenditure on defence for the coming fiscal year.\r\n\r\nIt  is no argument when it comes to security and defence to  say\r\n\r\nthat  we  should be cutting back on defence expenditure  in  the\r\n\r\nface  of  a  rough road ahead, especially when the  economy  can\r\n\r\nstill  afford it. Whether in good times or bad times, the  issue\r\n\r\nof   our   vulnerability  as  a  small  state  remains.   Steady\r\n\r\nexpenditure on defence is to be seen as an insurance premium for\r\n\r\nsecurity and survival.  We have seen how vulnerable small states\r\n\r\ncan be.  We cannot depend on other people's goodwill or largesse\r\n\r\nto come to our assistance.  On the contrary, we have to stand on\r\n\r\nour own when it comes to the crunch.  Events can quickly take  a\r\n\r\nrapid  turn  for  the worse and we have to  be  ready  for  such\r\n\r\neventualities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, modern warfares are a contest of technology. Military\r\n\r\nhardware  built on the latest technology determines to  a  large\r\n\r\nextent the outcome of any battle.  Modern weapons are not cheap.\r\n\r\nIt  takes  time and money to maintain the SAF at a high standard\r\n\r\nof operational readiness.  There should be no compromises on the\r\n\r\nstate  of  its  men, weapons and machines.  Without  maintaining\r\n\r\nthis  necessary expenditure, the ability of the SAF  to  perform\r\n\r\nits  role  will be seriously compromised.  The issue is  a  very\r\n\r\nsimple one.  Would you rather have your son go to battle with  a\r\n\r\nbazooka  that is a relic of Second World War or with the  latest\r\n\r\nguided  anti tank missile?  The choice is obvious.  In order  to\r\n\r\nstay  effective, the SAF must continue to update  its  equipment\r\n\r\nand   acquire  a  new  state-of-the-art  equipment   and,   more\r\n\r\nimportantly,  be led by capable men even if it means  continuing\r\n\r\nto pour resources in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that although this year's defence budget has\r\n\r\nincreased  in  real  terms, the sum total expenditure  is  still\r\n\r\nwithin  our  cap on defence spending at 6% of our GDP.   As  our\r\n\r\neconomy  continues to grow, the 6% cap on GDP will also continue\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrow in absolute numbers.  Maintaining defence expenditure at 6%\r\n\r\nof  GDP  gives  us the assurance that the economy  is  not  over\r\n\r\nburdened as a result.  The SAF has built up its credibility as a\r\n\r\nfighting force over the last two decades and must continue to do\r\n\r\nso in the coming years to remain effective.  Having said that, I\r\n\r\nam  confident that the SAF will at the same time recognise  that\r\n\r\nin  the  face  of  the  softening economy, it  would  make  some\r\n\r\nadjustments  to  its  programme by consolidating  its  resources\r\n\r\nwithout sacrificing its effectiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While supporting an increase in the budget for defence is\r\n\r\nnot,  to  me, an issue, I believe the people would like to  know\r\n\r\nwhether  the Ministry would be making adjustments to its defence\r\n\r\nspending  and, if so, what these adjustments are.  Additionally,\r\n\r\nI  share  the  concern of my colleague, Dr Ong  Chit  Chung,  in\r\n\r\nasking  for assurance from the Minister that the money allocated\r\n\r\nto defence will be well spent.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, after hearing the last three speakers,\r\n\r\nI  am  sure what I am going to say must sound treasonable.  But,\r\n\r\nnevertheless,  I  propose to say what I  wish  to  say  on  this\r\n\r\nsubject.  But, first of all, may I assure the House, although  I\r\n\r\ndo not think it needs any assurance, the Workers' Party does not\r\n\r\nfor one minute suggest that we should compromise on our defences\r\n\r\nand  our  capabilities.  But the question is:   has  there  been\r\n\r\nclear  thinking  about what the objectives  are  and  where  the\r\n\r\nthreat  is  coming  from and how best  it  could  be  met?   The\r\n\r\nMinister  says  in his Budget Statement that the  Government  is\r\n\r\nprepared to commit up to 6% of its GDP on defence expenditure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have made a study of 167 countries on their\r\n\r\nexpenditure  and  the ratio it bears to the GDP.   I  find  that\r\n\r\namong these 167 countries, only 25 spent more than Singapore  on\r\n\r\ntheir defence expenditure as a proportion of the GDP. May I  say\r\n\r\nthat these figures are for 1996.  But these countries where they\r\n\r\nspend  more  are in what has been known as troubled  spots,  the\r\n\r\nMiddle East, in Central Asia and in other countries where it  is\r\n\r\nrecognised that  troubles are brewing.  Is this region a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntroubled  spot?   We must, first of all, try and formulate  what\r\n\r\nare  our objectives in our defence.   What are the threats  that\r\n\r\nwe may encounter and where will they come from?\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of countries whose spending on defence is much\r\n\r\nless  than  Singapore are committed to peace-keeping  operations\r\n\r\nwhich  require  them to send their troops outside  to  keep  the\r\n\r\npeace.  I do not see Singapore has ever been called upon to send\r\n\r\nits  troops on peace-keeping operations. So what do we  see  the\r\n\r\nneed  in  Singapore?   Do we see a need  to  keep  ourselves  in\r\n\r\nreadiness  for  threats  from  our neighbours  or  threats  from\r\n\r\nelsewhere?  And if so, what would be the nature of the  threats?\r\n\r\nI  think there should be clear discussion on these subjects.   I\r\n\r\ndo not know why it is not possible for the Ministry to put out a\r\n\r\nWhite Paper on the defence of Singapore, so that these questions\r\n\r\nthat I have asked are discussed openly and that the people could\r\n\r\nsee  the need for spending what we are spending.  It is already,\r\n\r\nas  I  said, much higher than almost all other countries in  the\r\n\r\nworld, except for 25 countries.  I would urge the Minister  that\r\n\r\nwe  should not just follow what may have been our policy in  the\r\n\r\n1960s  and a little beyond that.  Times have changed.  The world\r\n\r\nhas  become  a safer place, and this region has become  a  safer\r\n\r\nplace.   Where  it  used  to  be  a  troubled  area,  there  is,\r\n\r\ncomparatively, now peace in this area.  So what are we preparing\r\n\r\nfor?   Should we not, first of all, outline what our  objectives\r\n\r\nare in our defence expenditure?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the 1998\r\n\r\nBudget  is  a prudent one.  However, despite the shadow  of  the\r\n\r\nregional  financial crisis, our defence spending is not  reduced\r\n\r\nbut  increased.  It accounts for 4.6% of our GDP, up  0.2%  from\r\n\r\nlast year.   In other words, defence spending has increased from\r\n\r\nlast  year's  figure  of  $6.445 billion to this  year's  $7.228\r\n\r\nbillion,  an  increase of $830 million, or  12.8%.   This  is  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: why are we increasing this spending? The\r\n\r\nNCMP has been  asking\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  same  question again and again.  There is peace around  the\r\n\r\nregion, why should we spend more money on defence?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the NCMP is English educated. He is not quite\r\n\r\nfamiliar with the Chinese history.   Let me enlighten him with a\r\n\r\nstory  from  Chinese  history.  During the warring  periods,  in\r\n\r\norder  to show  appreciation to the state of Jin for helping  it\r\n\r\nto  negotiate for peace with the other states, thereby  avoiding\r\n\r\na  conflict, the state of Zheng gave a  lot of chariots, musical\r\n\r\ninstruments,  musicians and songstresses  to the  king  of  Jin.\r\n\r\nThe  king  offered  to  share these gifts with  his  meritorious\r\n\r\nminister, Wei Jiang.  Wei Jiang declined the offer, and  instead\r\n\r\nturned  to  advise the king that he should think of the  dangers\r\n\r\nahead  and  be  prepared, even when he was  enjoying  peace  and\r\n\r\nprosperity.   So  I hope the NCMP can appreciate  that  national\r\n\r\ndefence is the basic foundation and most important role  for  an\r\n\r\nindependent  and  sovereign Singapore to guard against  external\r\n\r\naggression,  to protect the lives and properties of the  people,\r\n\r\nand to ensure security, stability and prosperity of our country.\r\n\r\nAt  the  same  time, it will boost  confidence of  our   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors in us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now my colleague mentioned that it takes a thousand\r\n\r\ndays  to  raise  an army to be used one day.  So a  well-trained\r\n\r\narmy  cannot be produced overnight.  In the present  context  of\r\n\r\nscience  and technology, apart from a well-trained armed forces,\r\n\r\nwe  must  also  ensure that our armed forces are  equipped  with\r\n\r\nadvanced military hardware.  We can learn from the Gulf war  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of the supremacy of advanced military hardware.   So\r\n\r\neven  in  peace,  we must also make sure that we  have  a  well-trained,  well-armed  and well-equipped  armed  forces,  and  be\r\n\r\nprepared at all times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are enjoying peace and security, we tend to forget\r\n\r\nthe hardship of nation building, especially the young people who\r\n\r\nhave not gone through the experience of disorders in the 50s and\r\n\r\n60s.   We have to remind them time and again of events that  are\r\n\r\nhappening  all over the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworld.    Take the lesson from the Gulf war.  Kuwait was invaded\r\n\r\novernight by Iraq.  For a small country like Singapore, I  think\r\n\r\nwe  can  learn  a  good lesson from that.   Our  defence  is  to\r\n\r\nmaintain our stability and security, especially in this time  of\r\n\r\nuncertainties.  We cannot afford to be  complacent.   We  should\r\n\r\nrestore  the  confidence of investors and make every  effort  to\r\n\r\npromote peace and security in this region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This regional financial crisis teaches us a lesson and\r\n\r\nmakes  us realise that the future is very unpredictable.  It  is\r\n\r\nonly  when we live in peace and do not forget to anticipate  the\r\n\r\ndangers ahead, be prepared at all times that we will be able  to\r\n\r\ntackle the problems as they come along, in order to continue  to\r\n\r\nenjoy peace and prosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, our huge defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure  has  been  well  accepted  by  Singaporeans.    The\r\n\r\ninvestment  over  the  years  in  equipment  and  personnel  has\r\n\r\ncontributed  immensely  to our strong, credible  defence  force.\r\n\r\nThe best time to invest in our defence capability is surely when\r\n\r\nwe  are  doing  well  economically,  so  that  Singaporeans  can\r\n\r\ncontinue  to enjoy better life with a greater sense of security.\r\n\r\nSurely  that  sense of security is also based on  the  state  of\r\n\r\nsecurity  in the region we live in  Southeast Asia and the  Asia\r\n\r\nPacific  in  general.  My question is: what  is  the  Ministry's\r\n\r\nassessment of the state of security in the two regions?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our enhanced defence capability through the investment in\r\n\r\nhardware and training must surely mean that our armed forces are\r\n\r\noperationally ready to defend Singapore's territorial  integrity\r\n\r\nand  sovereignty.   Given that our armed  forces  consist  of  a\r\n\r\ncitizens  army, their ability to train safely during peace  time\r\n\r\nwill  enhance the sense of confidence of our soldiers' families,\r\n\r\nparticularly  because  our soldiers train  locally  as  well  as\r\n\r\noverseas in realistic live-firing exercises.  The SAF does  have\r\n\r\na  very  good record of safety in training and safety is not  an\r\n\r\nissue  here.  What I would like to know is how the SAF tries  to\r\n\r\nimprove further its safety record\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  training  and ensure the high quality of safety standard  of\r\n\r\nthe equipment and weapons that it has purchased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is one other area of investment for security\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  must  continue  to  enhance,  ie,   in  defence\r\n\r\nrelations with neigbouring and friendly countries.  Some foreign\r\n\r\nobservers  tend to look at the defence expenditures of countries\r\n\r\nin the region as a reflection of the arms race.  I look at it as\r\n\r\nindividual  building  blocks  of  regional  defence.   In   this\r\n\r\nrespect,  we should build on further bilateral defence relations\r\n\r\nwith  other  countries.  My question is: how are we  progressing\r\n\r\nhere?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence (Dr Tony</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Tan Keng Yam):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I would like to reply to some\r\n\r\nof  the  points  which  have  been  brought  up  by  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the region today faces economic gloom. The scale of\r\n\r\nthe  financial and economic crisis which has hit Southeast  Asia\r\n\r\nis unprecedented.  In the months ahead, perhaps even in the next\r\n\r\nfew  years,  economic  growth in the  region  will  be  severely\r\n\r\naffected.    This gloomy prospect is a far cry from the  outlook\r\n\r\nless  than  a  year ago when Asia was deemed to  be  the  global\r\n\r\npowerhouse.   Investments then flooded into Asia  in  search  of\r\n\r\nopportunities.   No  one  could have foretold  how  drastic  the\r\n\r\neconomic plunge would be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, serious as the economic crisis is, my intention today\r\n\r\nis not to discuss the crisis, but to highlight the lessons which\r\n\r\nwe  can  learn  from  the  crisis for Singapore's  security  and\r\n\r\ndefence.    The  economic crisis which has hit  Southeast  Asian\r\n\r\ncountries  is another stark reminder of how quickly a favourable\r\n\r\nsituation can turn bad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson is clear. We must never take our success,\r\n\r\nstability and security for granted.  As I have said many  times,\r\n\r\nit  takes many years of hard work to attain economic growth  and\r\n\r\nprosperity  but  it does not take very long   sometimes  only  a\r\n\r\nmatter of weeks   for the situation to deteriorate rapidly.   We\r\n\r\nmust therefore never assume that prosperity and plenty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  be  ours to enjoy forever.  The lesson which  we  have  to\r\n\r\nlearn from the economic crisis is that our prosperity depends on\r\n\r\nour having sound policies, always being prepared and never being\r\n\r\ncomplacent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's security, like our economic prosperity, is also\r\n\r\nnot  something  which we should assume will  be  ours  to  enjoy\r\n\r\nforever  without  the  need for sound  policies,  to  be  always\r\n\r\nprepared   and  never  be  complacent.    As  a  small  country,\r\n\r\nSingapore's  security, like our economy, is very  vulnerable  to\r\n\r\nthe  influences of the external environment. We have  seen  time\r\n\r\nand  again  in the Asia-Pacific region over the past  few  years\r\n\r\njust  how  quickly tension and threats to stability and security\r\n\r\ncan  develop. In 1996, the tension in the Taiwan Straits  was  a\r\n\r\ncause   of   grave  concern  throughout  the  region,  including\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Last  year, there was a crisis in  Cambodia.    But,\r\n\r\nfortunately both these crises were defused in time and the  rest\r\n\r\nof the region could go on with their pursuit of economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, we have an economic crisis. The link between\r\n\r\neconomics  and  security is inescapable.   Today,  the  economic\r\n\r\nturmoil  which  has engulfed much of the region brings  with  it\r\n\r\npossible repercussions for stability and security as well.   One\r\n\r\nof the most striking features of our region over the last couple\r\n\r\nof  decades has been the level of cooperation among the  various\r\n\r\ncountries    both  bilaterally  with  each  other  and   through\r\n\r\nmultilateral  arrangements, and in a wide range of  sectors  and\r\n\r\nactivities.    Regional countries blessed with  economic  growth\r\n\r\nand  prosperity found it in their interest and to  their  mutual\r\n\r\nbenefit to cooperate.  Such cooperation in both the economic and\r\n\r\nsecurity sectors in turn underpinned the tremendous progress  in\r\n\r\nthe  Asia-Pacific  region.   If the economic  downturn  is  very\r\n\r\nsevere  and  there are attendant political and social  problems,\r\n\r\nthe  stability  and  security which we now enjoy  may  start  to\r\n\r\nunravel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Dr Ong Chit Chung has said, it is imperative that\r\n\r\nSingapore is prepared for any challenges to our stability and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecurity  that  may  arise in an uncertain regional  environment\r\n\r\ncomplicated by the present economic turmoil.  Newsweek  magazine\r\n\r\nlast  November advanced three fundamental reasons why  Singapore\r\n\r\nhad  emerged  relatively  unscathed from  the  currency  crisis.\r\n\r\nFirst,  we  are  vigilant  and always  prepared    for  trouble;\r\n\r\nsecond, we have a preoccupation with efficiency;  and, third, we\r\n\r\nemphasize   strategic   planning.    Newsweek   concluded   that\r\n\r\nSingapore  had  kept  its balance because we  always  took  into\r\n\r\naccount possible dangers over the horizon, and when the troubles\r\n\r\narrived, the preparations were already in place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same factors apply to our efforts to build a defence\r\n\r\ncapability  to  protect  Singaporeans,  and  to  safeguard   our\r\n\r\nsovereignty  and  territorial  integrity.   Ensuring  peace  and\r\n\r\nsecurity   requires   constant  vigilance,   a   commitment   to\r\n\r\nefficiency,  and strategic planning.  Building a strong  defence\r\n\r\ncapability  requires  sustained  effort  and  the  support   and\r\n\r\ncommitment  of  our  people  to  the  defence  of  our   nation.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  must always be mindful that there may  be  dangers\r\n\r\nover  the horizon, and unless we have a defence capability which\r\n\r\nis  credible enough to deter a threat, and to defeat that threat\r\n\r\nif the need arises, we will pay very heavily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paying the price now to build up our armed forces will\r\n\r\nspare  us the much bigger price that we will have to pay  if  we\r\n\r\nget caught unprepared and unvigilant.  In the economic sphere if\r\n\r\nthings  fall apart, you will still have future opportunities  to\r\n\r\nrebuild  again,  and to prosper, but we will not  get  a  second\r\n\r\nchance  if we cannot defend ourselves.  A security threat  could\r\n\r\nmean the loss of lives and the end of Singapore. So, just as the\r\n\r\nright  economic policies have enabled us to weather the regional\r\n\r\neconomic turmoil, we must have the right policies in defence  to\r\n\r\nhelp us ensure our security and survival.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, building a credible defence force is a long term\r\n\r\nprocess.   I  have  made this point in Parliament  before.   The\r\n\r\nmodern  battlefield is a fast evolving one.  We have  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat our armed forces do not have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyesterday's  capabilities to fight today's wars.  This  requires\r\n\r\nconstant   investment   in   training   in   new   skills    and\r\n\r\ntechnologically-advanced weapons.  Technology is also  important\r\n\r\nto give us the multiplier to overcome our manpower constraints.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building up a credible defence capability therefore\r\n\r\nrequires prudent and steady investments over many years.  Feast-and-famine  budgets will only result in sub-optimal \"start-stop\"\r\n\r\nimplementation  of programmes.  You cannot build  a  strong  and\r\n\r\neffective  defence capability using such an approach.   We  must\r\n\r\nplan  our  defence spending carefully, over many years  and  not\r\n\r\nyear  by  year  in  fits and starts. We must always  maintain  a\r\n\r\nsuitable  level of defence spending each year.  Our policy  has,\r\n\r\nfor  a long time, been to set a cap of 6% of the GDP for defence\r\n\r\nspending.  This policy has served us well.  I am  encouraged  by\r\n\r\nthe comments from Dr Ong Chit Chung and Mr Charles Chong that we\r\n\r\nshould review this 6% cap to see whether it is sufficient.  Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  have  actually spent well below 6% for the last  few  years.\r\n\r\nFor  this financial year, the Defence Ministry is spending 4.62%\r\n\r\nof our GDP.  But I think the 6% cap is valuable because it is  a\r\n\r\ncommitment  which facilitates planning and a smooth  development\r\n\r\nof capabilities.  Equally important, the 6%  is an expression of\r\n\r\nthe  importance we place on ensuring Singapore's defence.    Our\r\n\r\nfate  as  a  people and as a nation hangs on  this.   If  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to review the 6% cap, we will certainly do so, but for\r\n\r\nthe time being, that is sufficient for our defence needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam has brought up the point as to why\r\n\r\nSingapore is spending so  much on defence.   I am sorry that  he\r\n\r\nis not here now to listen to my reply.   But let us consider the\r\n\r\nconsequences  of  spending less on defence. Sir,  with  a  small\r\n\r\npopulation,  the SAF needs high technology systems  to  overcome\r\n\r\nour  manpower constraints.  In fact, it is fortunate that we are\r\n\r\nable to use technology to overcome our shortage of manpower.  In\r\n\r\nthe  days  when  sheer  numbers counted for  everything  on  the\r\n\r\nbattlefield, there could have been little that we  could  do  to\r\n\r\nfight back against an enemy who has vastly more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmen than Singapore that our small population could ever hope  to\r\n\r\nmuster.  Singapore is also land scarce which means that much  of\r\n\r\nour  training has to be done overseas.   This is more costly  -- although  we must not forget that the benefits of more effective\r\n\r\ntraining  and  the  opportunities to interact with  other  armed\r\n\r\nforces often more than make up for the extra cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cutting back on defence expenditure will mean slower\r\n\r\nmodernisation, less defence R&D and therefore not as big an edge\r\n\r\nover a potential enemy, and fewer training opportunities for our\r\n\r\nsoldiers, sailors and airmen.  What this means is that  it  will\r\n\r\ntranslate into a degradation of our defence capability  and  our\r\n\r\noperational  readiness.   Our  deterrence  level  will  then  be\r\n\r\nlowered.   And  our security policy is based on the  concept  of\r\n\r\ndeterrence.  Sir, we are not looking for a fight with anyone. We\r\n\r\npay  great attention to maintain good defence relations with our\r\n\r\nneighbours and with other countries.  I would like to assure  Mr\r\n\r\nHawazi  Daipi that this is given daily attention by both  myself\r\n\r\nand  my colleagues in the Ministry of Defence.  But, Sir,  where\r\n\r\ndefence relations fail and in case anyone has hostile intentions\r\n\r\ntowards Singapore, he must know that it will be extremely costly\r\n\r\nfor him to carry it through, and it would be best for him not to\r\n\r\ncontemplate  such a venture.  If our defence capability  is  not\r\n\r\ncredible,  a  potential aggressor might well reach  a  different\r\n\r\nconclusion  and  feel bold enough to go on a military  adventure\r\n\r\nagainst  Singapore. A weaker defence capability also means  that\r\n\r\nthe  SAF may have to fight at a disadvantage against the  enemy.\r\n\r\nSo, cutting back on defence expenditure would amount not only to\r\n\r\nhigher  risks  for  our nation but also, more directly,  to  the\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who have to fight to defend Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Mr Sin Boon Ann has said, defence expenditure\r\n\r\nshould  be  seen as our national insurance policy for peace  and\r\n\r\nprosperity.  You have to continue to pay the premiums,  in  good\r\n\r\ntimes and in bad times.  The greatest return we can have on  our\r\n\r\ninvestment is never to have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  go to war.  We are already collecting on our policy in terms\r\n\r\nof  the  peace of mind that the people of Singapore and  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors  have as a direct consequence of knowing that  we  are\r\n\r\nready and willing to make all necessary commitments in resources\r\n\r\nand money to ensure the security of our nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are our objectives in spending on defence. The\r\n\r\nSAF  that we have today is the result of years of investment  in\r\n\r\nthe  best  people,  equipment, doctrines and tactics.   The  SAF\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  its  operational readiness and effectiveness  when\r\n\r\nevents  in Cambodia took a turn for the worse last year and  the\r\n\r\nSAF  was called upon to bring Singaporeans home.  More recently,\r\n\r\nthe SAF responded promptly and effectively to provide assistance\r\n\r\nin  the  search and rescue and recovery efforts after the tragic\r\n\r\nSilkAir  crash  in the Musi River.  The SAF must  constantly  be\r\n\r\nprepared   for   all  contingencies,  including  providing   the\r\n\r\nnecessary  response  should there be  a  threat  to  Singapore's\r\n\r\nsovereignty  and  territorial  integrity.   We  must   therefore\r\n\r\nattract  the  best talents to serve in the SAF, and augment  our\r\n\r\nlimited manpower resources with high technology weapon systems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MINDEF will continue to invest in the necessary\r\n\r\nequipment and weapon systems and exploit technology as  a  force\r\n\r\nmultiplier to compensate for our limitations in manpower and  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  our technological edge.  In the future, the  challenge\r\n\r\nwill  be  to broaden the scope and quality of defence technology\r\n\r\nthat  is used by the SAF.   This will increase its effectiveness\r\n\r\nmanifold.    To achieve this, MINDEF will continue to  emphasise\r\n\r\ngreater integration among the SAF, the Defence Technology  Group\r\n\r\nand  our  defence industries, as well as optimise our scientific\r\n\r\nand  engineering talent.  The most vital element is good people.\r\n\r\nWe  need  motivated and professional officers and  men  who  are\r\n\r\nwilling  to  take on an onerous career in the SAF  and  who  are\r\n\r\nprepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for our country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has come a long way, and a strong and\r\n\r\ncredible SAF is a key\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfundamental   which  has  contributed  to  our  success.    More\r\n\r\nimportant,  a strong SAF will determine whether we can  preserve\r\n\r\nthat success or whether we or future generations of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwill  have to stand by helplessly while our country comes  under\r\n\r\nattack  and we lose everything we have built up, or worse,  lose\r\n\r\nour freedom as a people and a nation. Sir, this is a point which\r\n\r\nhas  been  aptly brought up by Dr Wang Kai Yuen.  Our  long-term\r\n\r\ninvestment in defence will allow us to face any uncertainty with\r\n\r\nconfidence.  Even in difficult times such as those we face  now,\r\n\r\nwe  must  continue  to  be committed to building  a  strong  and\r\n\r\ncredible  defence  force.   This  is  the  best  guarantee   for\r\n\r\nSingapore's continued peace, stability and prosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleagues, the Second Minister for Defence and the\r\n\r\nMinister  of State for Defence, will reply to some of the  other\r\n\r\npoints brought up by Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, it is a time of changes and\r\n\r\nuncertainties in Asia Pacific, a time of paradigm shifts in  the\r\n\r\nstrategic environment in the region.  In such circumstances,  we\r\n\r\nmust be single-minded and focus on the operational readiness  of\r\n\r\nthe SAF.  We want to be certain that the SAF is ever ready, when\r\n\r\nthe chips are down, to discharge its missions in any scenario.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Sir, we read in the Parameters, a quarterly\r\n\r\njournal of the United States Army College, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore's ground forces are considerably more competent\r\n\r\ntactically  than  those  of  its  neighbours  .  .   Singapore's\r\n\r\nequipment,  personnel,  training,  and  overall  readiness   are\r\n\r\nconsidered the best in Southeast Asia.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, I came across the Australian Strategic Policy, a\r\n\r\npaper  published  by Australian Department of  Defence.   And  I\r\n\r\nquote from this paper:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore's forces are the most advanced and effective in\r\n\r\nthis  region,  making it a valuable partner for  the  Australian\r\n\r\nDefence Force in terms of peace time interaction.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister care to comment on these external\r\n\r\nassessments,  and whether the SAF is operationally  ready,  come\r\n\r\nwhat  may,  and  that the SAF is more than equal to  its  tasks?\r\n\r\nThat  having invested substantially in the SAF, we can count  on\r\n\r\nthe SAF in a crunch.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I am reassured having heard Dr Tony\r\n\r\nTan's  reply.  We have come a long way from the days of  Dr  Goh\r\n\r\nKeng  Swee  to that of Dr Tony Tan's.  The fact that  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has given three Ministers the responsibility of defence\r\n\r\nshows the priority the Government has.  I would like to urge the\r\n\r\nMinister,  and I share the sentiments shown by Dr  Wang  and  Mr\r\n\r\nCharles  Chong, that the fact that 6% is the upper limit  should\r\n\r\nnot  deter  us from reviewing this upper limit should  the  time\r\n\r\narise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our defence, our peace, will ensure the quality of\r\n\r\nlife  that Singaporeans are going to enjoy.  The fact that  your\r\n\r\narea has not been burgled does not mean that you keep your house\r\n\r\nopen.   There is an Indian saying: in order to have  peace,  you\r\n\r\nhave  to  defend it at a price.  The fact that we  do  not  have\r\n\r\nenemies  around us is a good sign.  But the fact  still  remains\r\n\r\nthat  we  live in a very turbulent world, and we must build  our\r\n\r\ndefence  capability.  Sir, it is reassuring  that  none  of  the\r\n\r\nMembers,  when  the debate on the Budget Statement  took  place,\r\n\r\nquestioned the spending on defence, and I think that is right.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on another area which I think has\r\n\r\nequal  priority,  and  that  is, the people  must  realise  that\r\n\r\ndefence  is part and parcel of their life.  It is not  just  our\r\n\r\narmed forces.  Every Singaporean must realise that he has a role\r\n\r\nto  play.   And I urge the Government to reconsider  giving  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  a right perspective of our defence.  And I would  urge\r\n\r\nthe  Minister, in collaboration with the Minister for Education,\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that every school child in Singapore  shall  realise\r\n\r\nthat  the defence of Singapore is also his responsibility.   His\r\n\r\nparents must tell him how we must nurture ourselves in the world\r\n\r\nwe are living in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the employers must realise the important\r\n\r\ncontribution that their employees do when they perform  National\r\n\r\nService.   And I will go one step further, that those  employees\r\n\r\nwho  have  done  outstandingly well in  their  National  Service\r\n\r\nshould be considered as a plus point for promotion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot overstate the fact that the defence of\r\n\r\nSingapore is the responsibility of everyone of us, including the\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this  House,  some of  whom  are  actively  serving\r\n\r\nNational Service now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to have a good armed forces, we have to have\r\n\r\nmoney  invested both in machines as well as men.   And  I  would\r\n\r\nurge  the  Government to second some of the best brains  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry into the armed forces, which I think the Government  has\r\n\r\nbeen  doing.   I  think it is gratifying to  note  that  we  are\r\n\r\ndeveloping defence ties with other countries, like Sweden.   The\r\n\r\nfact  that they are prepared to have defence ties with us  shows\r\n\r\nthe capability and efficiency of our armed forces.  I would urge\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to go and explore and have defence  relationships\r\n\r\nwith as many countries as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many Members who are going to speak. I will\r\n\r\njust  touch on only one point which is of importance to us.   We\r\n\r\nalways  think in terms of production, in terms of money, dollars\r\n\r\nand cents.  The defence personnel may not be helping in GDP, but\r\n\r\nlet  us bear this in mind.  Without them, we would have no  GDP.\r\n\r\nSo,  please  give them their dues, and I think we should  salute\r\n\r\nthese men who have helped in defending Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Each and every National Serviceman must know what he\r\n\r\nis  fighting  for,  why the sacrifices, why  we  hold  dear  our\r\n\r\nsovereignty,  integrity  and  independence  and  our  hopes  and\r\n\r\nvisions for the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our National Servicemen should have, through national\r\n\r\neducation,  a  sense of history, an abiding  commitment  to  our\r\n\r\nhomeland,   an  appreciation  of  our  strength   as   well   as\r\n\r\nvulnerabilities,  and an unshakeable faith in our  own  national\r\n\r\ndefence.   Through national education, our National  Servicemen,\r\n\r\nindeed all Singaporeans, will be rooted in our own homeland.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our National Servicemen have their hearts in the right\r\n\r\nplaces,  Sir, we will win every battle.

We cannot rely on mass manpower.\r\n\r\nOur  competitive edge lies in high technology, in firepower  and\r\n\r\nmobility, in other words, in quality rather than quantity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same applies in the area of training. As a national\r\n\r\nservice  armed forces, we have limited time frames to train  our\r\n\r\nown  men.  We also face the limitation of space in a city state.\r\n\r\nWith the constraints of numbers, time and space, our answer must\r\n\r\nlie  in high-tech.  This is very much so in training.  We should\r\n\r\nharness  high-tech to train our National Servicemen,  maximising\r\n\r\nthe  returns  in  terms  of manpower and  space.   High-tech  in\r\n\r\ntraining  would also make training more relevant, realistic  and\r\n\r\ninteresting to our younger National Servicemen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I request the Minister to elaborate on the use of high-tech\r\n\r\nin  training and whether he would consider expanding the role of\r\n\r\nhigh-tech in more areas of training, locally and overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, unfortunately, there were a series of\r\n\r\naccidents  and  fatalities in the SAF training, both  local  and\r\n\r\noverseas.   It  raised much concern amongst parents  and  family\r\n\r\nmembers.   I  am  glad  that MINDEF took  safety  seriously  and\r\n\r\ninstituted a thorough review of training procedures.  Safety  in\r\n\r\ntraining is the order of the day in the SAF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish therefore to ask the Minister on the current state\r\n\r\nof  safety  in  training and whether he is  satisfied  with  the\r\n\r\nsafety  measures  in  place and what are the  responses  of  the\r\n\r\ntroops in the field to such measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, in his Budget speech last year, the\r\n\r\nMinister gave his assurance that the SAF placed most priority on\r\n\r\ntraining safety.  To achieve this, would the Minister point  out\r\n\r\nthat  the  SAF  has focused on three main areas.  Firstly,  risk\r\n\r\nassessment  and management.  Secondly, close range  supervision,\r\n\r\nand thirdly, safety education.  We have no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoubt that the SAF takes training safety very seriously and that\r\n\r\nno effort has been spared in this regard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you will recall, these assurances came fresh from\r\n\r\nthe tragic aftermath of the explosion of the artillery shell  in\r\n\r\nNew  Zealand  which killed two of our servicemen.   Despite  the\r\n\r\nassurances  given by the SAF, accidents still  do  happen.   The\r\n\r\npublic,  I  believe,  has come to accept  that  this  is  to  be\r\n\r\nexpected  in  organisations as large as the  SAF.   Foremost  in\r\n\r\npeople's mind is whether there has been any improvement  in  the\r\n\r\nsafety  training  record  since last year.   Will  the  Minister\r\n\r\nplease supply this House of the training safety record to-date?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Second Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Defence (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  SAF that we have today is the result of years of investment\r\n\r\nin  people,  equipment and doctrine.  It is a modern  and  well-integrated fighting force, operationally ready to deal with  any\r\n\r\ncontingencies   that   involve  our  national   interest.    Its\r\n\r\noperational    readiness   is   maintained   through    frequent\r\n\r\nmobilization practices and realistic training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong has mentioned two articles, one, Parameters and\r\n\r\nanother, Australian Strategic Policy that have complimented  the\r\n\r\nSAF   on  its  readiness.   Those  armed  forces  that  we  have\r\n\r\ninteracted and trained with have also found that the  SAF  is  a\r\n\r\nprofessional and proficient outfit.  As I said last year, we  do\r\n\r\nnot  just  depend  on magazines, reports and foreign  forces  to\r\n\r\nassess  our readiness.  We conduct regular readiness checks  and\r\n\r\nexercises.  Also when the SAF has been called upon to carry  out\r\n\r\nmissions at short notice, it has performed well.  This is a test\r\n\r\nto the high operational readiness of the SAF.  Recently, the SAF\r\n\r\nwas called upon to evacuate Singaporeans caught in the midst  of\r\n\r\nfactional fighting in Cambodia in July 1997 and to carry  out  a\r\n\r\nmonth-long  search and recovery mission in Palembang, Indonesia,\r\n\r\nin  December 1997.  If we delve further back into history,  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will remember the role that our commandos played in\r\n\r\nensuring the successful resolution of the SQ 117 hijack in 1991,\r\n\r\nor  our  air  force executing the dramatic cable car  rescue  in\r\n\r\n1983.  The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment will continue to ensure that the SAF is operationally\r\n\r\nready to deal with any contingency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Ong, Mr Sin Boon Ann and Mr Hawazi Daipi have asked\r\n\r\nabout safety training in the SAF.  The SAF has taken great pains\r\n\r\nto  ensure that whilst we train hard and well, no compromise  is\r\n\r\nmade to the safety of our servicemen.  Nothing is more important\r\n\r\nthan the safety of our troops.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training safety in the SAF is overseen by a high-level\r\n\r\ncommittee chaired by the Chief of Defence Forces.  The Committee\r\n\r\nmeets regularly to review safety efforts undertaken by the  SAF.\r\n\r\nWe  have in place a safety management system that systematically\r\n\r\nseeks to minimise all conceivable risks to our servicemen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, there are detailed safety procedures for every\r\n\r\nactivity  our  soldiers undertake.  These  procedures  are  well\r\n\r\ndocumented  and  widely disseminated to  all  our  officers  and\r\n\r\nspecialists.   They  are updated whenever valuable  lessons  are\r\n\r\nlearnt  either from our own experiences or from the  experiences\r\n\r\nof other armed forces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All officers and specialists are required to pass training\r\n\r\nsafety regulation tests as part of their training.  The SAF also\r\n\r\nregularly  conducts Safety Education and Awareness seminars  for\r\n\r\nall our officers and servicemen to remind them of the importance\r\n\r\nof safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safety officers are appointed whenever major exercises or\r\n\r\nlive firings are conducted.  Commanders are also required before\r\n\r\neach  exercise  or training to review the risks associated  with\r\n\r\nthe exercise or training and take steps to minimise these risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the more established armed forces, the SAF also has\r\n\r\nsafety  agencies whose primary aim is to audit all SAF  training\r\n\r\nactivities  at  every  level to ensure that  all  the  necessary\r\n\r\nsafety  training measures are implemented fully.   These  safety\r\n\r\nagencies  also  investigate  all training  incidents,  including\r\n\r\nthose that do not result in any bodily harm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also established an electronics training safety\r\n\r\nbulletin where every serviceman can access and share the  latest\r\n\r\nin safety developments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the SAF recognises that any training accident is one\r\n\r\naccident too many.  No effort is therefore spared to ensure that\r\n\r\nour servicemen can train safely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong asked about the use of technology in training. Sir,\r\n\r\nless  than one-tenth of the Singapore land area is used for  SAF\r\n\r\ntraining and MINDEF recognises that the area available  for  SAF\r\n\r\ntraining will shrink with time as we face competing demands  for\r\n\r\nland  to  meet  our housing and economic needs.   A  two-pronged\r\n\r\napproach  is  adopted to deal with this.  Firstly, we  look  for\r\n\r\ntraining areas overseas and today, the SAF conducts large  scale\r\n\r\ntraining  in several countries.  The SAF will continue  to  look\r\n\r\nfor  suitable  training areas overseas.  Second,  the  SAF  uses\r\n\r\ntechnology  to make up for the shortfall on land and air  space.\r\n\r\nFor example, emphasis is placed on the use of simulators.  High-end   simulators  can  provide  extremely  realistic  and   safe\r\n\r\ntraining.   It  reduces  the need for live  firing  and  is  not\r\n\r\nconstrained  by  the  lack  of space.   Examples  of  simulators\r\n\r\ndeveloped  for  SAF  training  are the  air  combat  manoeuvring\r\n\r\ninstrumentation  system,  the  air defence  complete  engagement\r\n\r\nsimulator, naval tactical simulators, flight simulators and  the\r\n\r\ntank  and  training systems.  The SAF will continue to look  for\r\n\r\ninnovative training methods using high technology to make up for\r\n\r\nthe shortfall of training areas in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Shriniwas Rai and Dr Ong spoke about national\r\n\r\neducation  and  reminding our citizens about the  importance  of\r\n\r\ndefence.   I  could not agree more with Dr Ong and Mr  Shriniwas\r\n\r\nRai  that  it  is  very important for all Singaporeans  to  take\r\n\r\ndefence  seriously.   MINDEF introduced  the  concept  of  total\r\n\r\ndefence  in  1984.  Since then, MINDEF has, in conjunction  with\r\n\r\nrelevant  Ministries  and  other agencies,  implemented  various\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to  enhance public awareness of  the  importance  of\r\n\r\ntotal  defence.  These programmes reach out to all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nMost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecently,  the Total Defence Heroes exhibition at  Fort  Canning\r\n\r\nwhich  commemorated Total Defence Day on 15th February was aimed\r\n\r\nat increasing the awareness of Singaporeans about the roles that\r\n\r\nthey can play in Total Defence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the SAF, we have for many years had national education\r\n\r\nprogrammes  which reach out to NSmen, regulars and non-uniformed\r\n\r\npersonnel.    These   programmes   serve   to   strengthen   the\r\n\r\nservicemen's commitment to Singapore and to explain the need for\r\n\r\na  defence capability.  MINDEF also contributes actively to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Education's  national  education  programme   and\r\n\r\nconducts  its  own  national  education  programme  for   school\r\n\r\nchildren  aimed at creating a greater awareness of  defence  and\r\n\r\nsecurity  issues.   I  can assure Mr Rai that  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nDefence  and Ministry of Education are well coordinated on  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the Ministry of Education is developing a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  and  extensive national education  programme  for\r\n\r\nyoung Singaporeans reaching all the way from primary schools  to\r\n\r\nthe   tertiary  institutions,  MINDEF  has  adjusted  its  focus\r\n\r\nslightly  to  provide  national  education  in  a  cohesive  and\r\n\r\nsystematic  manner  for  all  SAF  servicemen  and  women  which\r\n\r\ncomplements  and reinforces the national education programme  in\r\n\r\nschools.   The  SAF's programme covers many  levels  from  basic\r\n\r\nmilitary training to specialist and officer cadet schools.   The\r\n\r\nnational  education packages stress the importance  of  national\r\n\r\nservice  and the roles our servicemen play in providing for  the\r\n\r\nsecurity   of  our  country.   MINDEF  also  conducts   national\r\n\r\neducation  courses and seminars for middle echelon officers  and\r\n\r\nspecialists both for regulars and national servicemen during in-camp  training on specific issues as well as to remind  them  of\r\n\r\nthe important role they play in defence.  I would like to assure\r\n\r\nMembers of this House that MINDEF is fully committed to ensuring\r\n\r\nthat  servicemen and Singaporeans at large, especially  the  men\r\n\r\nand  women  who serve in the defence of our country,  understand\r\n\r\nwhy we cannot take our security for granted and why\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neach  and  every one of them has an important role  to  play  in\r\n\r\nensuring the security of our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, the SAF, like any organisation,\r\n\r\nrequires  good  and capable men to manage and to lead.   Without\r\n\r\nthese men having the most sophisticated weapons that are at  the\r\n\r\ncutting  edge  of technology would not have served any  purpose.\r\n\r\nAccordingly  and,  quite rightly, the SAF has never  spared  any\r\n\r\neffort  in paying competitive salaries in order to get  men  and\r\n\r\nperhaps,  in this day and age, women into service.  As a  result\r\n\r\nof the intensive recruitment exercises conducted over the years,\r\n\r\nthe  SAF  has  had a fair amount of success in getting  men  and\r\n\r\nwomen  of the right quality to make a career out of serving  the\r\n\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last two decades, we have seen the transformation of\r\n\r\nthe  SAF  into a credible and effective armed force  capable  of\r\n\r\ndefending the security interest of Singapore.  Whether it is the\r\n\r\nnavy,  air  force or the army, there is very little  doubt  that\r\n\r\nthese  military services are very highly regarded, not  just  by\r\n\r\nour  own people as we have heard earlier, but also by those  who\r\n\r\nhave had the opportunity to work with them.  This transformation\r\n\r\nis  in  no small way attributable to the men and women who  have\r\n\r\nmade sacrifices to bring the SAF to where it is today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that it is the policy of the SAF to keep\r\n\r\nits  organisation young.  Accordingly, very often,  in the  SAF,\r\n\r\nwe  see  officers who are put in very senior command  positions.\r\n\r\nThese  men  have been challenged by the very high  demands  that\r\n\r\nthese  appointments require.  It is not unusual to find  men  in\r\n\r\ntheir  early  30s occupying senior staff positions in  the  SAF.\r\n\r\nWith younger officers, the organisation will reduce the risk  of\r\n\r\nbeing  encrusted  in  complacence.  Younger officers  with  more\r\n\r\nenergy  and perhaps with fresher ideas would provide the impetus\r\n\r\nfor advancing the organisation forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping the organisation young does have its price. I\r\n\r\nwould like to touch on two broad areas.  First, officers in  the\r\n\r\nSAF  would  have  to vacate their appointments at  a  relatively\r\n\r\nyoung age in order to allow  younger officers to take over.   In\r\n\r\nmany  cases,  the  retiring officers are  still  young  and  are\r\n\r\ncapable  of  carrying  on.  For them,  because  they  are  still\r\n\r\neconomically  active,  they are compelled  to  look  for  second\r\n\r\ncareers and starting life afresh there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the SAF has a programme of preparing its officers\r\n\r\nand  men  for a second career in advance.  In this regard,  much\r\n\r\ncredit must go to MINDEF in making the effort to look after  the\r\n\r\nwell-being  of  its  employees.  While the  soldiers  are  being\r\n\r\nreturned  to civilian life through these courses, I  wonder  how\r\n\r\nmany  of  these  soldiers have been successful in  reintegrating\r\n\r\nthemselves in society.  Will the Minister please tell this House\r\n\r\nhow many ex-servicemen have been able to find jobs, for example,\r\n\r\nin  the private sector, what kind of jobs these are, and whether\r\n\r\nany  study  has  been  done  on the  morale  of  these  retiring\r\n\r\nsoldiers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second concern arises from the fact that the early\r\n\r\nretirement  officers  will  lead to  the  question  of  relative\r\n\r\nexperience  of those who come to succeed them.  One would  agree\r\n\r\nthat  no  matter  how  bright a soldier is, intelligence  is  no\r\n\r\nsubstitute for experience.  What assurance can the Minister give\r\n\r\nto  this  House  that  in appointing young  officers  to  senior\r\n\r\ncommand positions in place of the retiring officers,  the output\r\n\r\nfrom  the  offices  that  these  officers  occupy  will  not  be\r\n\r\ncompromised for lack of experience?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, defence relations with other\r\n\r\ncountries constitute an important function of MINDEF and is part\r\n\r\nof  our overall defence strategy.  Good  defence relations among\r\n\r\nArmed   Forces  Chiefs  and  personnel  will  enhance  bilateral\r\n\r\ncommunication   and  relationship,  and   help   us   to   avoid\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding and tide over difficult periods of time.   Good\r\n\r\ndefence relations, I believe, will yield good dividends,  giving\r\n\r\nus  access  to  overseas training, facilities,  enabling  us  to\r\n\r\nconduct bilateral and multi-lateral defence exercises, giving us\r\n\r\nthe opportunity to test\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  doctrines  and  measure ourselves against  the  best  armed\r\n\r\nforces in the world or in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister has earlier said, we are short of local\r\n\r\ntraining  areas.   The  overseas  training  facilities  will,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve, provide us with good alternative areas and terrain  for\r\n\r\nhands-on  training.  I would therefore like to ask the  Minister\r\n\r\nto  update us on our defence relations with the other countries,\r\n\r\nthe  joint  military exercises that we have and whether  we  are\r\n\r\nhaving more access to overseas training facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, the topic that I am going to raise,\r\n\r\nI  believe,  has been raised earlier.  I am suggesting  that  we\r\n\r\nconsider  the  proposition to allow  our  girls  to  serve  some\r\n\r\nnational  service  or  what you call community  service,  for  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  three   to  six months.  I do this  in  seriousness,\r\n\r\nbecause some Members felt that this matter should not have  been\r\n\r\nbrought up.  I think we are being unfair to our girls.   We  are\r\n\r\ndiscriminating  against  them.   They  should   be   given   the\r\n\r\nopportunity also to serve the country.  Some of them are already\r\n\r\nserving in the non-uniformed branches.  May I urge the Minister,\r\n\r\nas  a  long-term policy,  to consider my suggestion.  He may  be\r\n\r\naware that some other countries are having national service  for\r\n\r\ngirls.  They have a longer period  which I do not agree.   I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  girls should serve the same period as the  boys.   I\r\n\r\nthink  anything  from  three  months  to  six  months  would  be\r\n\r\nsufficient,  and  they could be a contributing factor,  both  in\r\n\r\ntime of peace and in time of crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, boys who have served national service have developed a\r\n\r\nsense  of  camaraderie, a bond which only the  school  days  can\r\n\r\nrival.   Similarly,  the  girls too can  benefit.   I  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister to give some consideration to this matter in the  long-term interest of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that we are having a declining\r\n\r\nworkforce.  If we could allow girls to serve from three  to  six\r\n\r\nmonths,  then we may want to consider   I am not saying that  we\r\n\r\nshould   reducing the period for the boys from two  and  a  half\r\n\r\nyears to two years and three months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\npropose    to   the   Minister   for   Defence   to    introduce\r\n\r\ninstitutionalised programmes for key appointment holders  in  NS\r\n\r\nunits  to meet with employers directly, both during and  outside\r\n\r\nin-camp training, to improve community relations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers' support is extremely important. We must\r\n\r\nrecognise  their contribution.  We can do more to overcome  some\r\n\r\nof  the perception gaps and frustrations that sometimes confront\r\n\r\nemployers  when  they  communicate  with  the  SAF.   The   most\r\n\r\nimportant  and  frequent  reasons why employers  would  want  to\r\n\r\ncommunicate  with  the  SAF is to ask for deferment  of  in-camp\r\n\r\ntraining  for  their staff.  Usually this happens a  little  too\r\n\r\nlate,   but,  quite  understandably,  business  unpredictability\r\n\r\nsometimes  makes  it difficult to plan one's  in-camp  training,\r\n\r\neven  when  notices  are  given  six  months  ahead.   Sometimes\r\n\r\nemployers  get  the feeling that their problems  are  not  being\r\n\r\nunderstood or appreciated adequately, especially when they  deal\r\n\r\nwith  some  unknown officials either in writing or  through  the\r\n\r\nphone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think NS units can play a very important role here. They\r\n\r\nput  a  human face and touch when dealing with employers.   Such\r\n\r\ninstitutionalised  programmes can lead to  more  meaningful  and\r\n\r\nstrong  relationship between NSmen  and employers,  and  thereby\r\n\r\neffectively  enlarging the SAF community.   Who  but  the  NSmen\r\n\r\nthemselves  can better demonstrate that when employers  ask  for\r\n\r\ndeferment on behalf of their employees, they are actually asking\r\n\r\nother  NSmen  to  shoulder  additional responsibilities  brought\r\n\r\nabout by the absence of one soldier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF, like any other forces for that matter, is\r\n\r\norganised such that the absence of one member in a unit or group\r\n\r\ncan  seriously affect training and handicap the capability of  a\r\n\r\nunit  as  a fighting force.   I ask for a new focus and emphasis\r\n\r\nto  establish and enhance the relationship between employers and\r\n\r\nthe  respective units to complement the roles already played  by\r\n\r\nSAF public relations unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the NS units have grown from just being\r\n\r\noperationally   ready   and  competent  to   undertaking   other\r\n\r\nadministrative responsibilities.  NS units, given the  necessary\r\n\r\nresources  and  assistance, can and are ready to play  a  larger\r\n\r\nrole in community relations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih (Minister of State, Ministry of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence (Mr Matthias Yao Chih):</b>\r\n\r\nSir,  Mr Sin Boon Ann asked about early retirement from the  SAF\r\n\r\nand also how these retired servicemen are faring in the civilian\r\n\r\nworld.   MINDEF  has a policy of keeping the  SAF  young.   This\r\n\r\nensures  that the SAF is always fighting fit and effective.   It\r\n\r\nalso  allows  a  healthy renewal of leadership, and  a  constant\r\n\r\ninfusion of new ideas at all levels of the SAF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF recognises that transition to a second career is\r\n\r\nnever   easy.    Preparations  for  a  serviceman's   retirement\r\n\r\ntherefore  start well before his actual retirement.   About  one\r\n\r\nand  a half to two years before their retirement, servicemen are\r\n\r\ninvited to attend special workshops and seminars to help prepare\r\n\r\nthem for their retirement and second careers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in service, MINDEF provides ample opportunities for\r\n\r\nservicemen to upgrade themselves.  Many sponsorships are offered\r\n\r\nfor  diploma, undergraduate and post-graduate courses.  We  also\r\n\r\nsponsor  servicemen  for  certified supervisory  and  management\r\n\r\nprogrammes offered by the Singapore Institute of Management  and\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Productivity and Standards Board.   The  training\r\n\r\nprovided will not only enable the servicemen to contribute  more\r\n\r\nto  the  SAF  but also better prepare them for a second  career.\r\n\r\nThere is also a scheme to subsidise retiring servicemen who wish\r\n\r\nto  take  up  training to prepare themselves  for  their  second\r\n\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF also helps retiring servicemen to look for suitable\r\n\r\njobs  in  the public and private sectors.  Furthermore, retiring\r\n\r\nservicemen  may start work with their new employers  up  to  six\r\n\r\nmonths  before their retirement from the SAF.  And  during  this\r\n\r\nperiod, the SAF pays them half their pay and allows them to keep\r\n\r\nwhatever their new employers will pay them.  Sir, these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasures  will  help  the  SAF  servicemen  to  make  a   smooth\r\n\r\ntransition into their second careers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no specific numbers as to who have gone to what jobs\r\n\r\nbut,  anecdotally, we know that our retired servicemen are  well\r\n\r\nlooked  after  in their new careers by their new employers.   We\r\n\r\nknow  that  there  is a network of retiring and retired  regular\r\n\r\nofficers  with  national  servicemen who  form  the  network  of\r\n\r\nemployers  and employees in the civilian sector.   And  we  know\r\n\r\nthat  they constantly keep in touch with each other to find  out\r\n\r\nwho  is  retiring  and who they can hire and can  contribute  to\r\n\r\ntheir companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other aspect of moving young officers up very\r\n\r\nquickly  within the SAF hierarchy will not compromise  on  their\r\n\r\nability  and expertise, because we have a well planned route  of\r\n\r\nadvancement  where  we prepare junior officers  to  take  senior\r\n\r\nappointments.  We train them and properly prepare  them  through\r\n\r\ncourses and expose them to experiences, command appointments and\r\n\r\nexercises   to  ensure  that  when  they  get  to   the   higher\r\n\r\nappointments, they will be able to perform well in their jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung, Mr Hawazi Daipi and Mr Shriniwas Rai\r\n\r\nasked about defence relations with other countries.  Our defence\r\n\r\npolicy   is  based  on  deterrence  and  diplomacy.   Therefore,\r\n\r\ndiplomacy  is  a  key pillar of our defence  policy.   Singapore\r\n\r\nplaces great emphasis on developing good defence relations  with\r\n\r\nother  countries, both within and outside of our  region.   Over\r\n\r\nthe  years,  we  have  developed a  network  of  strong  defence\r\n\r\nrelations  with many countries, and we will continue  to  invest\r\n\r\neffort  and  resources to strengthen existing relationships  and\r\n\r\ndevelop new ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our defence relations with ASEAN and FPDA countries are\r\n\r\ngood.  The SAF trains and exercises with their armed forces on a\r\n\r\nbilateral  or  multi-lateral basis.  We also send  officers  for\r\n\r\ntraining  in  each other's military academies and colleges.   We\r\n\r\norganise  regular  visits and exchanges  for  all  ranks.   Such\r\n\r\ninteractions  enable us to learn from each other  professionally\r\n\r\nand promote mutual understanding and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconfidence   building.   Such  exchanges  also  facilitate   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of rapport at various levels between SAF  personnel\r\n\r\nand their foreign counterparts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the Pacific, our defence relations with the US are\r\n\r\nstrong and warm. This relationship has been steadily growing  in\r\n\r\ndepth  and  scope.  The Air Force continues to  have  access  to\r\n\r\nvaluable training facilities in America.  Exercises with the  US\r\n\r\nconducted  locally have grown in complexity and scope  over  the\r\n\r\nyears.  These exercises and access to facilities testify to  the\r\n\r\nvalue  both  sides derive from such interaction.  We  have  also\r\n\r\nrecently  signed a Memorandum of Understanding which allows  the\r\n\r\nAir Force to do flying training in Canada.  Defence interactions\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore and European countries, in particular  France\r\n\r\nand   Sweden,  are  increasing.   Our  Navy  conducts  submarine\r\n\r\ntraining  in  Sweden.  The Air Force had their  first  bilateral\r\n\r\nexercise  with  their French counterparts recently.   MINDEF  is\r\n\r\nworking  towards more cooperation between the SAF  and  European\r\n\r\narmed forces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past year, we have also stepped up defence\r\n\r\ninteractions  with  countries such as South  Africa,  China  and\r\n\r\nJapan.   We  would like to see this continue.  As  for  training\r\n\r\nareas,  these  are  limited in Singapore.   While  the  SAF  has\r\n\r\ninvested  heavily  in simulators and other  forms  of  high-tech\r\n\r\ntraining  aids to overcome our constraints, there are limits  to\r\n\r\nwhat  technology can provide.  There is no substitute for actual\r\n\r\nflying  and  on-ground manoeuvres.  Hence, the  SAF  has  little\r\n\r\nchoice  but to conduct more of its training overseas.   The  SAF\r\n\r\nhas  access  to  training facilities in 16  countries.   We  are\r\n\r\ngrateful for these opportunities.  We will continue to look  for\r\n\r\nnew  training  areas overseas to meet the growing needs  of  the\r\n\r\nSAF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai asked whether girls should do some form of\r\n\r\nnational  service.   As  far as military duties  are  concerned,\r\n\r\nMINDEF has no immediate need to consider the option of enlisting\r\n\r\nwomen  by way of national service.  The number of males enlisted\r\n\r\nfor national service is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindeed  dwindling because of falling birth rates.  This has  led\r\n\r\nto  a squeeze on national service manpower for the SAF.  But  so\r\n\r\nfar  the  measures, such as making better use of technology  and\r\n\r\ncommercialisation  of  non-essential  support  functions,   have\r\n\r\nenabled  MINDEF  to cope with the squeeze. These  measures  have\r\n\r\nallowed  us  to  free  up  more manpower  resources  for  combat\r\n\r\nvocations or we can do more with fewer men.  However,  Mr  Rai's\r\n\r\nquestion touches on cohesion and bonding among women and perhaps\r\n\r\nalso non-combat duties for them.  If that is so, then perhaps  I\r\n\r\nshould  pass  this  question  to other  relevant  Ministries  to\r\n\r\nconsider for further study.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked whether or not we should consider reducing\r\n\r\nthe  period of training for boys in full-time national  service.\r\n\r\nSir, as explained by the Minister and the Second Minister before\r\n\r\nme,   we  are  increasingly  going  into  high  technology   and\r\n\r\nsophisticated equipment and these equipment require a long  time\r\n\r\nfor  the  boys  to get familiar with and to be operational  with\r\n\r\nthem.  The sophisticated weapon systems and equipment require  a\r\n\r\nlong   period  of  basic  training,  first,  for  the   soldiers\r\n\r\nthemselves to understand their own personal weapons and how they\r\n\r\nshould  react  on  the battlefield and slowly move  on  to  team\r\n\r\nbuilding  and then get to operate those sophisticated equipment.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  Sir, the training is not by way of small  sections\r\n\r\nof  10,  20  or 50 men.  They have to increasingly also  operate\r\n\r\nwith  larger  formations such as the battalion, the  brigade  or\r\n\r\neven  the division. Therefore, because of these two reasons,  we\r\n\r\nneed  a long time to prepare a young boy, coming in as a recruit\r\n\r\ntill the time he is operationally ready, to operate within a far\r\n\r\nlarger  formation and to operate very sophisticated weapons  and\r\n\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli Baharudin asked about community relations and,\r\n\r\nin  particular, interaction with employers.  I thank him for his\r\n\r\nsuggestion.  MINDEF has always regarded our relations  with  the\r\n\r\ncommunity as very important, especially given that the SAF is  a\r\n\r\ncitizen armed force.  Families and employers, all have a keen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterest  in  what the SAF is doing.  MINDEF is  also  conscious\r\n\r\nthat in a small country like Singapore, military activities will\r\n\r\ninevitably result in some inconvenience to the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF set up the Advisory Council on Community Relations\r\n\r\nin  Defence  (ACCORD) in 1984 as a means to keep  the  community\r\n\r\ninformed of developments in the SAF and to obtain feedback.  The\r\n\r\nACCORD  members  represent employers, trade  unions,  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations, schools and institutions of higher  learning  and\r\n\r\nalso Members of Parliament.  We have found ACCORD most valuable,\r\n\r\nas it helps MINDEF to explain its policies and activities to the\r\n\r\ncommunity  and  to  garner the support of Singaporeans  for  our\r\n\r\ndefence effort.  The feedback from ACCORD also helps us to fine-tune  MINDEF's policies and programmes to take the  concerns  of\r\n\r\nthe  community into consideration.  MINDEF also conducts regular\r\n\r\ndialogue  sessions with various groups, including employers  and\r\n\r\ngrassroots leaders.  At the same time, we organise visits to the\r\n\r\nSAF  units for them so that they have a better idea of the SAF's\r\n\r\ncapabilities to defend our country and a better understanding of\r\n\r\nwhat  it  is  that  our young men do when they perform  national\r\n\r\nservice.  Our three services, ie, Air Force, Army and Navy, also\r\n\r\nhold   open  houses  for  members  of  the  public.   SAF  units\r\n\r\nthemselves invite members of the public to such events  such  as\r\n\r\npassing  out  parades,  unit anniversary  celebrations  and  the\r\n\r\nCommanders'  Evening  so  that the members  of  the  public  and\r\n\r\nemployers can interact with the officers of the individual unit.\r\n\r\nSo  I assure the hon. Member that this has already been done and\r\n\r\nthe  unit  commanders are encouraged to organise  more  of  such\r\n\r\nactivities wherever possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I wish to thank the Ministers for\r\n\r\ntheir full and comprehensive replies and I beg leave to withdraw\r\n\r\nthe amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head K of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code KA 1500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Sir, the Ministry of Defence is a very important Ministry\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, especially for a small nation like Singapore that\r\n\r\nis  surrounded  by the big countries in Southeast  Asia  without\r\n\r\nmuch  breathing  space.  Most information  relating  to  defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure  are  sensitive and cannot be  disclosed.   Although\r\n\r\ndefence expenditure is necessary, we must still be   prudent  in\r\n\r\nour spending.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1997 Auditor-General's Report, I saw a lot of\r\n\r\nshortcomings  in  the  Ministry  of  Defence's  expenditure  and\r\n\r\nadministrative  procedures.   For  example,  in  the   tendering\r\n\r\nprocedure, the tender boxes were opened before the closing date.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  some  tenders that were submitted after  the  closing\r\n\r\ndate  were  also  accepted  and considered.   Thirdly,  the  fax\r\n\r\nmachine  was not installed at a proper place, and some of  these\r\n\r\ndocuments  and  quotations can be read by other  people  in  the\r\n\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also an incident when the tender price was\r\n\r\nnegotiated  down by $630,000 after the tender was closed.   Yet,\r\n\r\nwhen payment was made to the successful tenderer, the amount  of\r\n\r\n$630,000  was not deducted from the original tender  price.    I\r\n\r\nwonder what the Ministry is doing about the matter. How did this\r\n\r\nhappen?  Has any investigation been conducted, and what  is  the\r\n\r\nresult  of  the investigation?  How can the Ministry of  Defence\r\n\r\nensure  that this type of mistake will not occur again?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, I assure the Member that MINDEF\r\n\r\ntakes  the Auditor-General's Report very seriously.  Indeed,  we\r\n\r\nare  very conscious of the need to spend the budget given to  us\r\n\r\nwisely  and  ensure that there are no biases in the tenders  nor\r\n\r\nany discrepancies in the tender system.  There is no mystery  as\r\n\r\nto  what  happened.   The  Member read these  reports  from  the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General's Report.  Let me explain what has happened with\r\n\r\nregard to what he told us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of tender boxes being opened, on average,\r\n\r\nabout 50 MINDEF tenders are outstanding at any one time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  other words, as of today, there are 50 or more tenders which\r\n\r\nare  currently open.  The tender periods for the different types\r\n\r\nof  tenders range from three weeks to four months, depending  on\r\n\r\nthe  complexity  of  the requirements.   But  as  tenderers  are\r\n\r\nallowed to submit their offers any time before the closing date,\r\n\r\nit  is  possible  for  MINDEF to receive offers  from  different\r\n\r\ntenderers at any one time.  It is not practical to set aside one\r\n\r\nbox  for each tender.  MINDEF therefore sets aside eight  tender\r\n\r\nboxes and, as far as possible, tries to consolidate tenders with\r\n\r\nsimilar closing dates over a two-week period in the same  tender\r\n\r\nbox.   Otherwise, if we have 50 or more boxes and tenderers  put\r\n\r\ntheir tender documents in the wrong box, it will result in a lot\r\n\r\nof confusion and unnecessary extra work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenders submitted more than two weeks before the closing\r\n\r\ndate  are also allowed to be submitted into the eight boxes that\r\n\r\nwe   have   kept  open.   Hence,  when  the  boxes  are   opened\r\n\r\nperiodically  to  take out tenders which have closed,  the  same\r\n\r\nboxes  may  contain other tenders which have not  closed.   This\r\n\r\npractice, admittedly, was not consistent with the provisions  in\r\n\r\nthe  Instruction Manual.  The Auditor-General has  pointed  this\r\n\r\nout.  MINDEF raised this matter with the Ministry of Finance and\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Finance has recognised the problem  faced  by\r\n\r\nMINDEF.   It has subsequently agreed to allow MINDEF to continue\r\n\r\nwith the current practice.  Meanwhile, MINDEF will explore other\r\n\r\nways to improve the practice further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low said that there were 13 late tenders which were\r\n\r\nconsidered  after  the tender dates have  closed.  That  is  not\r\n\r\ncorrect.   The  point at issue here is that  none  of  the  late\r\n\r\noffers  were  accepted.  But it does not serve the  Government's\r\n\r\ninterest to completely disregard the late offers and not look at\r\n\r\nthem when they can be used to evaluate the reasonableness of the\r\n\r\nvalid offer.  Following the Auditor-General's Report, MINDEF has\r\n\r\nconsulted  the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry  has  agreed\r\n\r\nthat  there is no reason to return late offers to the tenderers.\r\n\r\nThe revised Instruction Manual now allows the procurement agency\r\n\r\nto retain late offers for reference, but it still requires the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurchasing agency to inform the supplier concerned that his late\r\n\r\noffer is not valid and will not be considered for award.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the location of the fax machines, tenderers are advised\r\n\r\nin the documents that if they want to send their tenders by fax,\r\n\r\nit  is  at  their  own risk.  Nevertheless, in MINDEF,  the  fax\r\n\r\nmachines are always located in restricted areas, for example, in\r\n\r\nthe  registry  or  in  the tender office, and  access  to  these\r\n\r\nmachines is tightly controlled and has been further tightened so\r\n\r\nthat  the office would not be left unattended and will be locked\r\n\r\nat  all times.  In addition, we have implemented a system  which\r\n\r\nelectronically  directs the faxes coming  in  to  the  recipient\r\n\r\nthrough  an e-mail system, thereby reducing the risk of exposure\r\n\r\ninherent  in the manual way of delivering faxes to the  desk  of\r\n\r\nthe recipient.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, how about the question of $630,000\r\n\r\nwhich was offered by the tenderer after negotiation and was  not\r\n\r\ndeducted in the main contract?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, I am aware of this case. After\r\n\r\nan  investigation it was found that there was a mistake made  by\r\n\r\nthe  officer concerned and the supplier was asked to refund that\r\n\r\n$630,000.\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek a clarification. How\r\n\r\nwas  the  mistake made?  Apparently, MINDEF negotiated with  the\r\n\r\ncontractor  and a discount was offered. Why was this  offer  not\r\n\r\nreflected in the contract awarded, in terms of the amount?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I do not think that MINDEF has given any\r\n\r\nassurance  that  a  tender box should not be opened  before  the\r\n\r\ntender  is  closed.   Should  MINDEF  not  have  any  innovative\r\n\r\nsolution,  instead of saying that the Ministry  of  Finance  has\r\n\r\nallowed  them  to  carry  on with the practice  because  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent situation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, regarding the $630,000, it was\r\n\r\nnot captured in the original tender document and therefore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere was a discrepancy.  Later on, this was pointed out and the\r\n\r\nmoney had been recovered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the tender boxes are concerned, the issue is not\r\n\r\nwhether  the tender boxes remain open or closed.  The  issue  is\r\n\r\nwhether  every  tender that comes in is properly kept,  properly\r\n\r\nregistered,  and not opened before the proper time.   And  under\r\n\r\nthe  system as it exists, when the tender boxes are opened,  all\r\n\r\nthe tenders which are meant to be opened or due for opening will\r\n\r\nbe set aside and given to the officers in charge for processing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tender documents for other tenders which are not due for\r\n\r\nopening are then properly registered in a register and put  back\r\n\r\ninto  the box.  And this procedure is properly witnessed so that\r\n\r\nnobody can claim later on that he has submitted a tender and  it\r\n\r\nis  not  in  the box or that the box was opened and  the  tender\r\n\r\ndocument was taken away.  Nor somebody can claim that he put the\r\n\r\ndocument in the box before the time was up when actually he  did\r\n\r\nso after the period had closed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the issue is not whether the box is opened or closed.\r\n\r\nThe  issue  is whether every document that comes in is  properly\r\n\r\nregistered and properly processed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Further clarification, Sir.

For example, the integrity of the electronic system,\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the  liability for wrong filing, and what  happens  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  a fraudulent filing by somebody on behalf of  another\r\n\r\ntaxpayer.   Where  is  the applicable law  when  filing  through\r\n\r\nelectronic means, through the Internet, which can be done from a\r\n\r\npoint outside Singapore? The source of the filing may not be  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many questions related to this issue, as\r\n\r\ntechnology is in fact moving at a much faster pace than what  we\r\n\r\nall  can  imagine.  The question really is this: do we  need  to\r\n\r\nupdate  our laws more regularly, and which other areas  the  law\r\n\r\nneed  to  be  updated?  May I ask the Minister that  perhaps  he\r\n\r\nshould  look into the setting up of a Review Committee,  and  to\r\n\r\ninclude   technical  consultants  or  experts  in  this   Review\r\n\r\nCommittee,  to  review laws that need to be  amended  so  as  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  we are up to date.  Having a Committee  will  also\r\n\r\nenable some form of uniformity of the law because we do not want\r\n\r\nto  have the same set of laws on different issues with different\r\n\r\npenalties, if they are for the same offence, for example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, will the Minister consider setting up a Law Review\r\n\r\nCommittee  to make sure that our laws will be reviewed  in  line\r\n\r\nwith technological changes?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, our legal\r\n\r\nsystem  is  much respected and admired.  It is due in  no  small\r\n\r\npart  to the various institutions that make up the system -  our\r\n\r\nJudiciary, Legal Service and the professions.  Our laws too have\r\n\r\nbeen   much  admired.   We  have  had  many  visits  from  legal\r\n\r\nprofessionals in the region who are interested in our  laws  and\r\n\r\nour  legal system.  We are looked upon as a country where  every\r\n\r\nlaw  is  thought through carefully, where once it is enacted  is\r\n\r\nenforced.   These  visitors will probably be surprised  to  hear\r\n\r\nthat  currently our law reform is not centralised.  We have  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Academy of Law Committee on Law Reform that  has  done\r\n\r\nan  excellent  job  in specific cases.  We  have  the  Attorney-General's  Chambers'  Legislation  Division,  and  we  have  the\r\n\r\nvarious Ministries each proposing laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be time to take a more holistic view to law reform.\r\n\r\nWe may also need to speed up reforms of the law in relation to a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  areas.   We need to keep up with the  fast  pace  of\r\n\r\nchange,  for  example, in areas of cyber laws.  We need  studies\r\n\r\nalso  to  be  made in relation to a number of legal institutions\r\n\r\nsuch  as  sentencing  policies.  I am sure that  they  are  done\r\n\r\ncurrently  by  a number of agencies, but that is  precisely  the\r\n\r\npoint  why  we need to have a Law Reform agency capable  of  and\r\n\r\nable  to  respond  quickly  and  a singleness  of  mind  to  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  of  coming up with modern and well  thought-out  laws.\r\n\r\nThe  time  surely  has  come  to think  of  a  full-time  agency\r\n\r\ndedicated  to  law  reform.   Such an  agency  can  be  used  to\r\n\r\nrecommend and draft new laws and to study the impact of existing\r\n\r\nlaws  to see whether they are working well and, if not, how they\r\n\r\ncan be improved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can think of at least three areas where such an agency\r\n\r\nmay  help.  Firstly, in the area of substantive law, there  need\r\n\r\nto  be  more  coordinated  efforts, for  example,  in  the  laws\r\n\r\nrelating  to the media, especially electronic media, integrating\r\n\r\nintellectual\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproperty  laws,  and laws relating to electronic  commerce.   In\r\n\r\nprocedural  law,  the  time  has  really  come  to  review   the\r\n\r\nantiquated  codes of procedure evidence, such  as  the  Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure Code and the Evidence Act.  In legal institutions,  we\r\n\r\nneed  studies done, for example, on the operation of the various\r\n\r\nnew   ways   of  dispute  settlement,  such  as  mediation   and\r\n\r\nconciliation,   on  the  relationship  between   mediation   and\r\n\r\nadjudication.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in today's modern societies and fast paced economies,\r\n\r\nwe may need to have an efficient and effective law reform agency\r\n\r\nthat  can not only keep pace with developments but enable us  to\r\n\r\nplan ahead.  That is part and parcel of being Singapore.  And  I\r\n\r\nhope that in the not too distant future, we can have this agency\r\n\r\nto  help  make  the  legal system even  much  more  admired  and\r\n\r\nrespected.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David T. E. Lim (Aljunied):</b> Sir, many small businesses\r\n\r\nare  heavily  dependent  on trade with regional  countries.   In\r\n\r\ntoday's  economic climate, many are stuck with inventories  they\r\n\r\ncannot  sell and debts they cannot collect. I am told  that  the\r\n\r\nnumber of bankruptcies in 1997 has risen some 30% compared  with\r\n\r\nthe year before.  No doubt this number is likely to increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These business failures bring with them some unexpected\r\n\r\nproblems.   Recently,  for  example,  I  was  approached  by   a\r\n\r\nbusinessman  who  had  left the running  of  a  company  to  his\r\n\r\nbusiness  partner.   His business partner  disappeared  together\r\n\r\nwith  all the books and business records.  As the only remaining\r\n\r\ndirector, he is now responsible for the company but is unable to\r\n\r\nfile any reports or conduct any business.  He does not know  who\r\n\r\nhis  debtors  or creditors are, who has paid, or  who  has  been\r\n\r\npaid.   He  is  afraid  that  the  Registry  of  Companies   and\r\n\r\nBusinesses  (RCB)  would impose a fine on  him  for  failing  to\r\n\r\nsubmit  his annual accounts.  But at the same time, he does  not\r\n\r\nwant to wind up the company for fear that he may be disqualified\r\n\r\nfrom  being a director of another company he owns.   And  if  he\r\n\r\ndoes nothing, he may still become disqualified\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non the grounds that he has repeatedly been fined by the RCB.   I\r\n\r\nam  told  by fellow MPs that they have encountered other similar\r\n\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laws which govern business failures and the obligations\r\n\r\nof  directors  are  not  confined to just  one  Statute  or  one\r\n\r\nMinistry.   To  the small businessmen, they can be very  complex\r\n\r\nand complicated.  Not knowing exactly what they are required  to\r\n\r\ndo by law in such circumstances adds considerable anxiety to the\r\n\r\nanxiety  of  businesses  which  are  already  in  trouble.   And\r\n\r\nhurrying lawyers to figure out a particular situation is  costly\r\n\r\nat a time when they are trying to conserve cash.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest three measures for the Ministry to\r\n\r\nconsider  to help in this particular time.  Firstly, I hope  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Law  would be alert to such problems  and  unusual\r\n\r\nsituations  as  the  years  wear on.   The  Ministry  should  be\r\n\r\nproactive  and  prod  further when early and  unusual  signs  of\r\n\r\ndistress  are  seen.  We should take the lead  to  coordinate  a\r\n\r\nthorough  response to deal with the situation,  especially  when\r\n\r\nthe rules and regulations cut across a number of Ministries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, where appropriate, the Ministry could perhaps\r\n\r\nissue  guidelines for small businesses on how to deal  with  the\r\n\r\nunusual  situations  such as the one I have  described  earlier.\r\n\r\nThis would save businessmen a lot of time and costs figuring out\r\n\r\nwhat to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I also hope that in situations when businessmen\r\n\r\nare  caught  through  no fault of their  own  by  the  technical\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  the  law,  the Ministry  would  adopt  a  more\r\n\r\nsympathetic   interpretation   of   the   rules   or    initiate\r\n\r\nmodifications to the relevant laws to help the businessmen cope.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the Bankruptcy Act was amended last\r\n\r\nyear  to  raise the limit by which bankrupts may be  discharged.\r\n\r\nIn  view  of the fact that the economy, because of the  regional\r\n\r\ncurrency  crisis, is due to slow down, there is likelihood  that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  more  bankruptcies.  As my colleague  has  just\r\n\r\nmentioned, bankruptcies have gone up by 30% last year.   I  want\r\n\r\nto ask the Minister,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  view  of  the  changes in the Bankruptcy Act  and  that  the\r\n\r\neconomy  may  go  through a more difficult period,  whether  the\r\n\r\nOfficial  Assignee  and  Public Trustee  (OAPT)  has  sufficient\r\n\r\nmanpower  to cope with the workload to make sure that those  who\r\n\r\nare  in  need  of  help  to be discharged  will  be  discharged.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  more  can  be done in this area  and  how  bad  is  the\r\n\r\nsituation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, may I take both cuts together?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Much obliged, Sir. First, I will deal\r\n\r\nwith  the  Official Assignee and Public Trustee.  The Office  of\r\n\r\nPublic  Trustee is a very important legal office.   The  present\r\n\r\nholder  of the office, Dr Chandra Mohan, besides being a  Public\r\n\r\nTrustee  and  Official Assignee, also acts as the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nMoneylenders,   Commissioner   for   Charities,   Registrar   of\r\n\r\nPawnbrokers,  amongst other things.  He administers  all  monies\r\n\r\ncollected  under  road  accident cases.   As  the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nPawnbrokers, he has reorganised the auction of pawned goods  for\r\n\r\nthe  benefit of the public.  There is greater transparency  now.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, the public has benefited.  The public is getting  more\r\n\r\nout  of  these auctions.  I commend him and his men for doing  a\r\n\r\nfine job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another area which I would like the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider,  and  that is, the Office of the Public Trustee.  With\r\n\r\ngrowing affluence, more people are leaving properties behind and\r\n\r\nwe  should  consider increasing the jurisdiction of  the  Public\r\n\r\nTrustee.  As Members may be aware, the Public Trustee is allowed\r\n\r\nunder  the  Act  to administer estate with a certain  limit.   I\r\n\r\nthink  it will be beneficial to the community at large  if  this\r\n\r\nwas increased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, Sir, we should think of corporatisation of this\r\n\r\naspect  of  the  Public Trustee.  When I visited Australia,  the\r\n\r\nState of New South Wales has got this and it offers its service,\r\n\r\nas lawyers do, to administer estates.  Sir, I am suggesting this\r\n\r\nbecause in normal cases, the court takes about six months to get\r\n\r\nthe proper documents for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadministration.   The  Public Trustee  takes  a  shorter  period\r\n\r\nbecause  he  does not have to go to court and I would  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister, for the benefit of our people, to look afresh  at  the\r\n\r\nlegislation and amend it, if necessary,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to commend the Public Trustee because,\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to  time,  whenever lawyers,  and  I  myself,  avail\r\n\r\nthemselves  of  the service, and we feel that clients  would  be\r\n\r\nbetter  served  by  the Public Trustee, the Public  Trustee  has\r\n\r\nunstintingly  obliged and has done a good  job.   I  think  this\r\n\r\nHouse should be aware of this fact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I be permitted to move to land titles, Sir. When the\r\n\r\nBritish  started the settlement of Singapore,  we  had  what  we\r\n\r\nlawyers  call \"common law titles\".  Sir, I would at  this  stage\r\n\r\nlike  to  declare  my  interest.  I am the owner  of  a  private\r\n\r\nproperty and I have made an application for conversion  of  this\r\n\r\nproperty to land title.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the common law title started, and many Members\r\n\r\nwho  have  bought properties would have known each  document  is\r\n\r\nadded  after  each transfer and it becomes very  cumbersome  and\r\n\r\ndifficult.  Sometimes it is difficult even for lawyers  to  read\r\n\r\none title from the other.  And rightly, the law was changed.  We\r\n\r\nhave what is called the Registry of Titles and they have done  a\r\n\r\ngood  job over the years.  I stand corrected, but I think  there\r\n\r\nis  a plan to have all of Singapore under the title deeds.  I am\r\n\r\nconcerned,  and feel perhaps the Minister may want to  enlighten\r\n\r\nthe  House  as  to how long it would take before  the  whole  of\r\n\r\nSingapore is governed by this Torrens system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we are moving very fast and the Registry has\r\n\r\nnow  been computerised.  I think Members and the public will  be\r\n\r\ninterested  to  know when the Land Titles Registry  expects   to\r\n\r\nconvert the common law title to that of land titles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be in the interest of Singapore lawyers as\r\n\r\nwell  as the business community and property developers to  have\r\n\r\nthe entire Singapore under this title deed as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, it is known\r\n\r\nby  now  that  the  property market in Singapore  is  bad.   The\r\n\r\nchances  are  property  prices will continue  to  fall  further.\r\n\r\nQuite  a  few  property developers had halted their construction\r\n\r\nprojects.  If the situation persists, it is not unimaginable for\r\n\r\nsome property developers to go under and the bank will take over\r\n\r\ntheir building and land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under such circumstances, the professionals, the\r\n\r\nbuilders,  the suppliers and the workers working on the  project\r\n\r\nwill suffer greatly.  And this is because under our current law,\r\n\r\nit is stated that whatever sits on the land belongs to the land.\r\n\r\nIf  the  land  has  been mortgaged to the  bank,  then  whatever\r\n\r\ncontribution that the builders, the professionals, the suppliers\r\n\r\nand  the workers had made during their building process will  go\r\n\r\nwith  the  land.  The CPF of course has the first  charge.   The\r\n\r\nresidual  amount would be first taken by the lending  bank  with\r\n\r\nwhatever remaining distributed to other creditors, such  as  the\r\n\r\nsuppliers, professionals, builders and workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not unusual for an ailing developer to slow or stop\r\n\r\npayment to the builder months ahead of their collapse.  Hence, a\r\n\r\nlot  of  values,  contributed  by the  professionals,  builders,\r\n\r\nsuppliers, workers, etc. are not paid for and yet they are taken\r\n\r\naway by the bank.  What makes it worse is that under the law the\r\n\r\nbuilder  has no statutory right to stop work even if it  is  not\r\n\r\npaid.   Therefore, it is very inequitable under the present  law\r\n\r\nto  protect the banks and not the others who by right should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  a  lien  on  the property or on the  project  account  to\r\n\r\nprotect their interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to cite the UK practice on statutory right to\r\n\r\nsuspend work.  In 1996, they enacted a law to give builders  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  right  to  suspend work in the event  of  non-payment\r\n\r\nunder   section   113   of  Housing  Grants  (Construction   and\r\n\r\nRegeneration)  Act  1996.  That means a  contractor  can,  after\r\n\r\ngiving   seven   days'  notice,  suspend  performance   of   its\r\n\r\nobligations  for  non-payment.   There  is  also  provision  for\r\n\r\nautomatic time extension for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompletion for the period during which their employer remains in\r\n\r\ndefault of his payment obligation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to study this biased\r\n\r\nand  unfair practice and provide an equitable protection to  the\r\n\r\nparties involved in the building process.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, the Legal Aid\r\n\r\nDepartment  is  providing an invaluable  service  to  those  who\r\n\r\ncannot  afford to seek help from the private lawyers.   However,\r\n\r\ndue  to  the educational background of those who seek assistance\r\n\r\nplus  the  fact that most speak only dialects or mother  tongue,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  Malay  and Tamil, sometimes there may be  problems  in\r\n\r\ncommunication  between the officers and the  clients.   Although\r\n\r\nthe Department does provide translators, but because legal cases\r\n\r\noften involve legal terminology, many have complained that  they\r\n\r\ncould  not quite follow what has transpired between the  various\r\n\r\nparties  involved, especially when they receive official letters\r\n\r\nin English.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another common problem is that after they have received the\r\n\r\ncourt  ruling,  the  officer involved often  consider  the  case\r\n\r\nclosed.   However, there may be follow-up action  to  be  taken.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  a  divorcee may have problems in  collecting  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance or receiving the proceeds after the common  property\r\n\r\nhas  been  sold.  They are often at a loss as to what to  do  as\r\n\r\nthey  would  be told that as far as the Legal Aid Department  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, they have obtained the court ruling and the  case  is\r\n\r\nconsidered closed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to request the Minister to look into\r\n\r\nthese two problems, and perhaps assign more bilingual lawyers to\r\n\r\nthe  Department and alert the translators to be more patient and\r\n\r\ntake  greater care in explaining every detail to the users.   As\r\n\r\nfor follow-up action, the officers can explain to those who seek\r\n\r\ntheir  help that they will be attended to even after  the  court\r\n\r\nruling and that they will be provided with continuous assistance\r\n\r\nshould they encounter any further problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to request the Minister to look into the\r\n\r\nexisting  $800 ceiling for anyone who is qualified to seek  help\r\n\r\nfrom the Legal Aid Department.  For example, a wife with two  or\r\n\r\nthree kids and earning around $1,000 wants to seek legal aid for\r\n\r\nwhatever reason will never be able to afford to engage a  lawyer\r\n\r\nfrom  the private practice.  Nor can a breadwinner with a family\r\n\r\nearning the same amount and who encounter any legal problems  do\r\n\r\nthe  same.   They  would  have  no  option  but  to  seek  legal\r\n\r\nassistance from the Legal Aid Department.  Therefore, I  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  certain  flexibilities be exercised  to  deal  with  these\r\n\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.40 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, my subject is how we treat or deal\r\n\r\nwith those members of our community who fall foul of the law and\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  dealt with.  And of course, I am speaking  of  our\r\n\r\nsentencing  policy in Singapore.  Under our present  provisions,\r\n\r\nthere  is an increasing number of offences which carry mandatory\r\n\r\nsentences that are determined by the legislature.  I can see the\r\n\r\nneed  for a mandatory minimum sentence in some cases.  But  this\r\n\r\nshould  be  left or kept to a minimum.  For one thing, mandatory\r\n\r\nsentences  take  away  the  function  of  the  Judiciary   whose\r\n\r\nfunctions it is to determine what the proper sentence is.  So  I\r\n\r\nwould  urge  the Ministry to consider whether they  are  perhaps\r\n\r\ngoing  over  board in trying to provide mandatory sentences  for\r\n\r\nvery  many offences.  But a more particular concern of  mine  is\r\n\r\nthe  sentence of caning that is now being inflicted on  a  great\r\n\r\nnumber  of  our  offenders and even where  they  have  committed\r\n\r\noffences of which violence was not a major part or even a  minor\r\n\r\npart.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mankind has come a long way from the time when it treated\r\n\r\nits  prisoners inhumanely and cruelly.  There was  a  time  when\r\n\r\nthey were put on the rack.  There was a time when they were made\r\n\r\nto do hard labour and we even had hard labour in our laws at one\r\n\r\ntime.   But  as I said, we have moved on.  And it has been  said\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none  indicia of a civilised society is to see how it treats\r\n\r\nits prisoners and people who have fallen foul of the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caning that we carry out, as I am sure everyone knows,\r\n\r\nis  not  the  caning that is carried out in schools or  even  in\r\n\r\nboys'  institutions where boys are kept.  This  caning  that  is\r\n\r\ncarried  out in the prisons is designed to inflict as much  hurt\r\n\r\nas  possible upon the individual and to leave scars.   This  has\r\n\r\nbeen acknowledged as being the aim of the caning sentence.   May\r\n\r\nI say, Sir, it brutalises the society to see that caning of this\r\n\r\nnature is one of the policies of the Government.  Advocates  who\r\n\r\nare  urging the abolition of the death sentence have called  the\r\n\r\ndeath  sentence \"state murder\".  Similarly, this  imposition  of\r\n\r\ncaning  by  the  state may be characterised as \"state  violence\"\r\n\r\nupon the individual.  As I said, it brutalises our citizens.  It\r\n\r\nlowers  their resistance to resorting to violence in  their  own\r\n\r\nrelationships with others.  And I did not inform the House  that\r\n\r\nunder  the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and  under\r\n\r\nthe  covenants,  caning  is  not encouraged  or  is  prohibited.\r\n\r\nGovernments are urged not to resort to caning or to any  violent\r\n\r\npunishment.  And indeed the European Court of Human  Rights  has\r\n\r\ntaken it much further.  It has declared corporal punishment, not\r\n\r\nonly of persons who fall foul of the law but even of schoolboys,\r\n\r\nillegal as it violates the human rights of the child or person.\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said in a number of other things, there should be\r\n\r\ngreater public awareness of what should our policy be on caning.\r\n\r\nI  think  it is time that we moved on and not stick to  the  old\r\n\r\nidea  of  punishment, but to see whether our present  system  of\r\n\r\npunishment is fit for a civilised society and whether it  serves\r\n\r\nthe  purpose.  I hope the Ministry will take steps  to  initiate\r\n\r\npublic discussion among our citizens on the punishments that are\r\n\r\nbeing  carried  out,  because it is  very  much  a  matter  that\r\n\r\nconcerns our people.  If that is not possible, will the Ministry\r\n\r\nconsider  setting up a committee to study the whole question  of\r\n\r\nsentencing  policy that we adopt in this country? It  is  not  a\r\n\r\nmatter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat should be just left to one or two Ministers or even to  the\r\n\r\nCabinet.  It is a matter on which the public should state  their\r\n\r\nviews and a national policy on sentencing reached.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, Singapore, in recent\r\n\r\nyears,  has  been introducing new methods of dispute settlement.\r\n\r\nThese  have  gained much attention, acceptance and  favour.   In\r\n\r\nparticular,  the  setting  up of the first  Community  Mediation\r\n\r\nCentre  was  well received.  Residents now have  recourse  to  a\r\n\r\nCentre  where they can settle disputes among themselves  instead\r\n\r\nof complaining or quarrelling  or calling for the police.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister how well this centre has\r\n\r\noperated.   Has  there been a good response among the  residents\r\n\r\nand  grassroots leaders towards this centre?  In particular, how\r\n\r\nhas the Centre coped with the disputes sent to it, whether these\r\n\r\ndisputes  have been settled amicably and what lessons have  been\r\n\r\nlearned from its operations?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, in relation to the recruitment of mediators, last\r\n\r\nyear,  I  spoke about the need to involve the grassroots leaders\r\n\r\nin  the  mediation process in any neighbour dispute.   I  should\r\n\r\nlike  to  know  whether action has been taken  to  involve  more\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders  in the mediation process.   Are  there  any\r\n\r\nfacilities set up to train such mediators?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these days of economic stringency, I am concerned that\r\n\r\nthe  mediation programme may be  set back.  I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister whether there will be more centres in the pipeline,\r\n\r\nespecially as mediation is now growing in importance, and social\r\n\r\ndisputes are becoming more in number when economic circumstances\r\n\r\nare less favourable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from community mediation, I understand that there has\r\n\r\nalso been mediation undertaken by the Singapore Mediation Centre\r\n\r\nset up by the Academy of Law for commercial disputes.  I am sure\r\n\r\nthis  is most welcome as parties who contract, of course, intend\r\n\r\ntheir contracts to be kept and that they should remain in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   business  relationship.   Going  to  trial  usually  sours\r\n\r\nrelations and adds to transactional cost.  I hope that gradually\r\n\r\nparties going to courts for relief will consider mediation as  a\r\n\r\nprecursor to any court action that they may wish to pursue.   At\r\n\r\nthe  moment, it seems that mediation is an unfamiliar method  of\r\n\r\ndispute  settlement.  I wonder whether more  could  be  done  to\r\n\r\npromote  this  method before parties take on the  more  familiar\r\n\r\nroute of fighting it out in the courts.  Litigants will need  to\r\n\r\nunderstand that mediation is, in most instances, a better way of\r\n\r\nresolving   disputes  than  adjudication.   Will  the   Minister\r\n\r\nconsider ways in which the mediation process can be promoted  at\r\n\r\nall  levels of society, between neighbours, between businessmen,\r\n\r\nindeed between Government agencies and the people?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, responding\r\n\r\nto the various comments that have been made, may I start with Mr\r\n\r\nChng Hee Kok and Prof. Chin Tet Yung's remarks on law reform.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, let me say that different countries have diverse\r\n\r\napproaches to the way in which they undertake law reform.   Some\r\n\r\ncountries  have  more than one instrument of law  reform.   Some\r\n\r\nhave,  as  Prof. Chin has said, a centralised body to  undertake\r\n\r\nlaw  reform.  Whatever the approaches, I think we can agree that\r\n\r\nlaw reform is important in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By law reform, we need to be clear what we mean. It\r\n\r\nincludes,  first, the updating of laws, to make sure  that  they\r\n\r\nare   not  out  of  tune  with  latest  developments  in   other\r\n\r\njurisdictions.  It also means examination of the laws to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat modern problems, previously not anticipated, are adequately\r\n\r\ndealt  with under our laws  information technology, the  example\r\n\r\nthat he mentioned is a good illustration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, Prof. Chin is right that we do not have a\r\n\r\ncentralised  body.   What is the present  system?   Our  present\r\n\r\nsystem is that there is a Law Reform Committee under the Academy\r\n\r\nof  Law.   The  Committee has inputs from the Attorney-General's\r\n\r\nChambers  as well as the Ministry of Law.  The Ministry  of  Law\r\n\r\nacts, in effect, as a coordinating body, whether\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere are consultations needed with other Ministries or economic\r\n\r\nagencies, such as EDB, TDB and other agencies.  The Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLaw,  on  its own, also initiates and embarks on law review  and\r\n\r\nlaw reform processes.  A good example is the recent exercise  on\r\n\r\nintellectual   property  rights  where  we   introduced   fairly\r\n\r\ncomprehensive amendments to the Copyright Act.  And there is  an\r\n\r\non-going  exercise  to review trade marks,  industrial  designs,\r\n\r\nintegrated circuits and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the future, while we may not immediately proceed to one\r\n\r\ncentralised agency, I can assure both Mr Chng and Prof. Chin Tet\r\n\r\nYung  that  the  Ministry of Law, together  with  the  Attorney-General,  will set up a special unit to coordinate  and  promote\r\n\r\nlaw  reform and law review at the national level.  Such  a  unit\r\n\r\nwill   work   closely  with  relevant  agencies  in  the   legal\r\n\r\nfraternity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the areas that such a unit might usefully focus\r\n\r\non?   I  can  think of three areas which should  have  priority.\r\n\r\nFirst,  the  full range of intellectual property laws  and  laws\r\n\r\nconcerning  information technology.  This includes some  of  the\r\n\r\npoints  that have been made by Prof. Chin and Mr  Chng Hee  Kok.\r\n\r\nThis would also include laws that support the development of the\r\n\r\nemerging sciences in the medical field and biotechnology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area is to study, together with the economic\r\n\r\nagencies,  what  changes have to be made to legislation  in  the\r\n\r\nfields  of  business, banking, finance and  commerce.   In  this\r\n\r\nregard, I think we should realise that law reform is not just an\r\n\r\nacademic  exercise.  We should view laws, the legal institutions\r\n\r\nand  legal procedures as an important infrastructure to  support\r\n\r\nour  overall objective of establishing ourselves as a  financial\r\n\r\nand commercial centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been spoken about the need to be competitive in\r\n\r\nthese  areas.  In that context of being competitive,  laws,  the\r\n\r\neffectiveness of legal procedures and legal institutions must be\r\n\r\nconsidered  as part and parcel of the infrastructure to  support\r\n\r\nour commercial competitiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we will consult relevant agencies on what should be done\r\n\r\nto  update  and make changes to laws such as the Companies  Act,\r\n\r\nTrustees  Act,  Bankruptcy Act, Bill  of  Sales  Act  and  other\r\n\r\ncurrent laws in the areas of banking and securities.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe aim of the Ministry of Law in setting up this unit is to  be\r\n\r\nable to support economic Ministries like the Ministry of Finance\r\n\r\nand  the Ministry of Trade and Industry, to ensure that our laws\r\n\r\nkeep in pace with changes which are vital to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that the third area where we will work closely\r\n\r\nwith   other   Ministries  such  as  Home   Affairs,   Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  and  Health is to review laws to improve  community\r\n\r\nrelations  and to increase social peace and security.   In  this\r\n\r\narea,  we  will  continue to evolve our  own  laws  on  ADR  and\r\n\r\nmediation,  which  will be touched on in greater  detail  by  my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the Minister of State.  What I should  emphasise  is\r\n\r\nthat  whatever  method we have to review our laws  and  whatever\r\n\r\ninstrument  we  have for law reform, it cannot be  done  by  one\r\n\r\nagency  acting alone.  It has to tap available resources in  the\r\n\r\nAcademy of Law, the Attorney-General's Chambers, the Law Society\r\n\r\nand,  of  course, the academic talents and brains that exist  in\r\n\r\nthe University of Singapore's Law Faculty.  In this way, I think\r\n\r\nwe  can ensure that our laws keep in pace with the rapid changes\r\n\r\nthat  are  taking  place both in Singapore  and  in  the  global\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the specific points that have been raised by Mr Chng\r\n\r\nHee  Kok  and Prof. Chin, let me say that the Attorney-General's\r\n\r\nChambers currently chairs a committee which examines the  legal,\r\n\r\nregulatory   and   enforcement  issues  concerning   information\r\n\r\ntechnology  and electronic processes.  Actually, we are  already\r\n\r\nlooking  at  a  number of draft legislation,  including  one  on\r\n\r\nelectronic  transactions which will regulate digital signatures,\r\n\r\na  point  which  Mr Chng Hee Kok alluded to when  he  asked  for\r\n\r\nsafeguards in the context of IRAS' latest requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments may also have to be made to the Computer Misuse\r\n\r\nAct, the Rules of Court and other existing intellectual\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproperty  legislation, and we will do so in  close  consultation\r\n\r\nwith agencies like the NCB, MTI and MHA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the reply to Prof. Chin's point, the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's Chambers are looking into the review  of  the\r\n\r\nCriminal  Procedure  Code  to  streamline  and  update  criminal\r\n\r\nprocedure and police powers, to review also the Penal  Code,  to\r\n\r\nupdate penalties and to modernise code.   And, if I may say  so,\r\n\r\nwe  are also looking at various aspects of the Evidence Act  and\r\n\r\nthe  Criminal Procedure Code to examine, for example, the  scope\r\n\r\nof the hearsay rule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, on law reform, it is under control. It may not\r\n\r\nbe  exactly  in  the  shape and form that  Prof.  Chin  wants  a\r\n\r\ncentralised  agency,  but  we  have  to  constantly  review  the\r\n\r\nmechanism.   What is important is to ensure that the law  reform\r\n\r\nactually does take place.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr David Lim, and related points were made by Mr Chng Hee\r\n\r\nKok, touched on the plight of directors who find themselves in a\r\n\r\nsituation where they are the remaining directors and may have to\r\n\r\ncomply  with  obligations to file the statement of  affairs.   I\r\n\r\nwill  focus really on the role of the Official Receiver and  the\r\n\r\nduties of the Official Assignee and Public Trustee's Office.  He\r\n\r\nwants  us  to be sympathetic and I take note of his point.   But\r\n\r\nlet me also say that obviously each case has to be considered on\r\n\r\nits own merits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to balance the difficulties and plight of\r\n\r\ninactive  directors  with  the loss suffered  by  creditors  and\r\n\r\ninvestors of those wound-up companies whom the law is duty bound\r\n\r\nto  protect.   Because when one becomes a director,  say,  as  a\r\n\r\nfavour  to a sibling or friend, he must be aware that there  are\r\n\r\ncertain responsibilities.  There is a duty towards a company and\r\n\r\none  is  accountable for its affairs.  The statement of  affairs\r\n\r\nwhich a director of a wound-up company is required to file  with\r\n\r\nthe  Official  Receiver  is  an important  document  because  it\r\n\r\nenables the Official Receiver to inquire\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto  the extent of a company's assets and liabilities.  In  the\r\n\r\npast, it is a fact that the Official Receiver faced considerable\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in  getting directors to  file  the  statement  of\r\n\r\naffairs.   The situation improved after 1993 when  a  number  of\r\n\r\nthem  were  convicted in court and fined.  But fewer  and  fewer\r\n\r\nsummonses are now issued against company directors.  I  am  told\r\n\r\nthere  were 56 in 1992, 38 in 1995 and 31 in 1997.   I  am  also\r\n\r\ntold that to-date, no director has been disqualified because  of\r\n\r\nconvictions or failure to file his statement of affairs.  Let me\r\n\r\nalso  add  that  before  the Official  Receiver  applies  for  a\r\n\r\nsummons,  at  least  three  reminders are  sent  and  extensions\r\n\r\ngranted to him to submit the statement of affairs.  The Official\r\n\r\nReceiver also gives guidance and advice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Chng Hee Kok's question, let me say that in 1997,\r\n\r\nthere  were 1,694 new bankruptcies as compared to 1,252 in 1996,\r\n\r\nwhich   represents  some  35%  increase.   But  in  an  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn,  it  is not unexpected.  From our viewpoint,  what  is\r\n\r\nimportant is that the bankrupts have the opportunity to get  out\r\n\r\nof  bankruptcy  as  quickly  as possible.   This  is  where  the\r\n\r\nOfficial Assignee comes in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case the impression is given that the Official Assignee\r\n\r\ndoes not have in mind the plight of the individuals concerned, I\r\n\r\nshould  remind the House that in fact it was due to the Official\r\n\r\nAssignee's initiative that we amended the law in  September last\r\n\r\nyear  to  enable bankrupts who have been in bankruptcy for  more\r\n\r\nthan  five  years  and  with debts  of  up  to  $250,000  to  be\r\n\r\ndischarged  by  certification of the Official Assignee.   Before\r\n\r\nthe  amendment, the ceiling was $100,000.  The point I am making\r\n\r\nis  that  following the amendments to the law, a  large  number,\r\n\r\nsome  6,500  bankrupts,  became eligible for  consideration  for\r\n\r\ndischarge.   In fact, 3,400 bankrupts, or 52%, have already been\r\n\r\ndischarged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the high volume of bankrupts, the bankruptcy\r\n\r\nclearance  rate, ie, the number of cases discharged compared  to\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  new  cases  rose to  a  record  high  of  161%.\r\n\r\nCreditors  too have had their interests served receiving  record\r\n\r\ndividend payments of $30.7 million in 1997, which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  29% higher than what was received in 1996.  So the Official\r\n\r\nAssignee, through laws and through the administration, has tried\r\n\r\nto   serve  both  the  interest  of  individual  bankrupts,  not\r\n\r\nforgetting  the interest of the creditors, which are two  duties\r\n\r\nthat he has to bear in mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai asked about increasing the jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nWe  have to examine what has happened in other countries and see\r\n\r\nwhether it is appropriate for our own system.  I would say  that\r\n\r\ncomment  also  applies  to  his suggestion  for  corporatisation\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Official Assignee and Public Trustee's  Office  is\r\n\r\nalready  an autonomous agency since 1st August 1997.   This  has\r\n\r\nenabled  it  to  manage  its  resources  more  effectively   and\r\n\r\nefficiently.   Whether  we  should  go  one  step  further   and\r\n\r\ncorporatise  it, I do not rule it out, but I would say  we  will\r\n\r\nhave  it  under  review and take that step if  and  when  it  is\r\n\r\nabsolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Chuang Shaw Peng's question, I hope he would\r\n\r\nunderstand that I will not be able to give a very specific reply\r\n\r\nto  his point at this stage because it is a matter that I  would\r\n\r\nhave  to  consult  with  other agencies  like  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational Development, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and so\r\n\r\non.   After  getting  the necessary inputs from  them,  we  will\r\n\r\nrespond to Mr Chuang.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My understanding is that the position in the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nis  pretty  much  the  same as in Singapore  on  the  rights  of\r\n\r\nmortgagees of land, ie, builders have no special lien in respect\r\n\r\nof  materials they provide for the construction of the building.\r\n\r\nBut  he has referred to certain specific subsidiary legislation.\r\n\r\nI have taken note of it and we will look into that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen talked about legal aid. He has made three\r\n\r\npoints.  One is about the problem of translation.  Let me assure\r\n\r\nhim  that  in my discussions with the Director of Legal  Aid,  I\r\n\r\nhave been assured that they have adequate translators, but I  do\r\n\r\ntake  note  of his point that if it is not sufficient we  should\r\n\r\nensure that whatever resources are necessary are made available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two more substantive points were the closure of files.\r\n\r\nI  must assure him and the House that it is not true that once a\r\n\r\ndecree  nisi  is obtained the file is closed.  On the  contrary.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau informs the applicant of the progress of the case and\r\n\r\nthe  file  is  not closed till the decree absolute is  obtained.\r\n\r\nWhen  an  order  of court on ancillary issues  is  obtained,  an\r\n\r\napplicant faces problems.  For example, with regard to  division\r\n\r\nof  matrimonial property, the Bureau still advises  and  assists\r\n\r\nthe individual to deal with these problems and will continue  to\r\n\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the means test, let me also assure the Member that\r\n\r\nthe  income  ceiling was increased only two years ago.   But  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  look  just at the increase in  the  income  ceiling\r\n\r\nbecause, in addition to the quantum and the deductions which are\r\n\r\nmade  for  HDB flat or CPF and so on, people who have more  than\r\n\r\nthe  income ceiling qualify for legal aid.  In fact, the present\r\n\r\nsystem  is that nearly 80% of those who apply for legal  aid  do\r\n\r\nqualify  for  legal  aid.  I think that is not  an  unimpressive\r\n\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will stop here to enable the Minister of State to\r\n\r\nrespond to the other two questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister a clarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, there is very little time\r\n\r\nleft.  Can you allow the Minister of State to reply first.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It is just a question. But it is all right.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>\r\n\r\nLet  me  reply  to Mr Jeyaretnam.  Mr Jeyaretnam  shows  concern\r\n\r\nabout  our  tough punishment regime, focusing in  particular  on\r\n\r\nmandatory minimum sentences and caning.  Sir, first, let me  say\r\n\r\nthat  our tough stand against crime and all those who perpetrate\r\n\r\nit is well known.  Deterrence is a key pillar of our tough penal\r\n\r\nregime.  This has resulted in Singapore being a safe city,  well\r\n\r\nknown  around the world and as a place where even ladies can  be\r\n\r\nout  at  night.  In 1997, we enjoyed the lowest crime rates  for\r\n\r\nnine years.  This approach\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  worked  well for Singapore.  Having said this, let  me  add\r\n\r\nthat imprisonment and caning are not the only punishment options\r\n\r\navailable  here.  As a lawyer, Mr Jeyaretnam will know  that  in\r\n\r\nour  law  books there are also other options that are available,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  granting of probation to juveniles and even to adults,\r\n\r\nmandating payment of compensation by the offender to the victim,\r\n\r\nsuspension  of  licences and even making  the  offender  perform\r\n\r\nCorrective  Work Orders.  In other words, there is  a  range  of\r\n\r\npunishment  which  is  available to the  courts  to  choose  the\r\n\r\npunishment that fits the crime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me focus on Mr Jeyaretnam's two concerns. His first\r\n\r\nconcern is minimum mandatory sentences.  Mr Jeyaretnam should be\r\n\r\nassured  that we do not use it willy-nilly.  Indeed, we  use  it\r\n\r\nquite sparingly.  In the Penal Code, for example, there are only\r\n\r\nabout  25  out  of  the 230-odd offences there  that  have  this\r\n\r\nminimum mandatory requirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> There are other Acts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> But it is mainly in the Penal\r\n\r\nCode.    These  are  all  serious  offences:  aggravated   rape,\r\n\r\naggravated  extortion, aggravated molest.  In other words,  when\r\n\r\nwe have minimum mandatory sentences, it is sending a signal that\r\n\r\nthese  are serious offences and they should not be trifled with.\r\n\r\nAnyone who perpetrates the offence will be dealt with in a tough\r\n\r\nway.   Again, as I said, it has played a part in helping to keep\r\n\r\nSingapore safe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time the Penal Code was amended in a relatively\r\n\r\nbigger  way  to incorporate mandatory minimum sentences  was  in\r\n\r\n1984.   In  fact,  I was reading the Hansard  just  now  and  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  also participated in the debate.  That  was  already\r\n\r\nsome  time ago.  Having said this, minimum mandatory sentencing,\r\n\r\nquite  contrary to what Mr Jeyaretnam says, does not remove  the\r\n\r\ncourt's  discretion  entirely.  Because beyond  that,  there  is\r\n\r\nstill  a  maximum  tariff and the court can still  decide    the\r\n\r\nsentence to fit the crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern of Mr Jeyaretnam is caning. All of us\r\n\r\nknow  that  caning  is  indeed  an  effective  deterrent.   Even\r\n\r\nhardened  criminals  fear  caning.  We  know  this  because,  as\r\n\r\nMembers  know,  the  Ministry of Home  Affairs  is  planning  to\r\n\r\ntoughen  the  drug regime to have caning for hard core  addicts.\r\n\r\nOur agencies on the ground tell us that this already has had  an\r\n\r\neffect on the ground, both anecdotal as well as in numbers.   So\r\n\r\nthe  point  to note is, what works.  Again, here we do  not  use\r\n\r\ncaning  willy-nilly.  It is carefully considered whether  caning\r\n\r\nis  required,  looking  at the nature of  the  offence  and  the\r\n\r\nincidence of occurrence and then caning as an option is put into\r\n\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam talks about other jurisdictions like Europe\r\n\r\nand  other places.  In terms of penal philosophy, every  society\r\n\r\nhas  to decide for itself.  What are the punishments that should\r\n\r\nbe imposed?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> That is what I am asking.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> So I am saying that in the\r\n\r\nSingapore context, this is what we have.  We decide what is best\r\n\r\nfor us and it works.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Can we have a public discussion? That is\r\n\r\nwhat I am asking.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> We are thinking about it all the\r\n\r\ntime.  The Ministry of Law together with the other Ministries is\r\n\r\nalways  looking  at  ways  in which  our  legal  system  can  be\r\n\r\nimproved.  Just now, we heard praises from various Members here.\r\n\r\nAssoc.  Prof.  Chin talked about international  praise  for  our\r\n\r\nlegal  and  judicial  systems and our  laws.   Mr  Kenneth  Chen\r\n\r\npraised  the Legal Aid Bureau.   Mr Rai praised the OAPT.   That\r\n\r\nis  the mindset that we have.  So we are continually looking  at\r\n\r\nhow  our  legal  system,  including  our  punishments,  can   be\r\n\r\nimproved.   This is not something that is cast in  stone.   They\r\n\r\ncan evolve over time.\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. \"Guillotine\" time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $204,696,350 for Head T ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $418,568,400 for Head T ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head E -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head E - Judicature.

The\r\n\r\nabolition  of the Privy Council has led to the establishment  of\r\n\r\nour  own  Supreme Court.  When the Privy Council was  abolished,\r\n\r\nthere  were a lot of concerns.  I had spoken, in fact, to  Prof.\r\n\r\nJayakumar long before the abolition.  I appealed to him to  have\r\n\r\nit  abolished,  and I am happy that after the abolition  of  the\r\n\r\nPrivy  Council, our Judiciary has come of age.  In fact,  it  is\r\n\r\ndue to our judicial system that one of the judgments, the famous\r\n\r\nPertamina  case,  that  was  heard  by  Justice  Lai  Kew  Chai,\r\n\r\ndisagreed with the Privy Council's earlier decision, and it  was\r\n\r\na  very  bold  decision, and the Privy Council was persuaded  by\r\n\r\nJustice Lai's decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am suggesting to this House that we should look\r\n\r\nafresh  at  our  judicial system especially.  In the  last  five\r\n\r\nyears,  the  Supreme Court and Subordinate Courts have  achieved\r\n\r\noutstanding  results  and  it is to  the  credit  of  the  Chief\r\n\r\nJustice,  the  Judges of the High Court, the Registrar  and  his\r\n\r\nofficials,  as well as the Subordinate Court Judges in  bringing\r\n\r\nthis  about.   The  Court  is  moving  from  a  long-established\r\n\r\nadversarial system, which is the British practice, to one  which\r\n\r\nis  keeping  with our Asian tradition - mediation,  conciliation\r\n\r\nand  arbitration.  In fact, in the High Court of Singapore, less\r\n\r\nand  less  cases go to trial.  Most cases get settled either  by\r\n\r\nthe court officials or through the intervention of the Singapore\r\n\r\nMediation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCentre  set  up  by  the  Singapore Academy  of  Law.   In  many\r\n\r\nCommonwealth countries, Sir, the courts are crowded with  cases.\r\n\r\nWe are very fortunate.  We do not have such a situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the quorum of the Court of Appeal, as it is now, in\r\n\r\nmost cases, only three Judges sit on the Court of Appeal.  I  am\r\n\r\nsuggesting  to  the  Minister to consider whether  in  important\r\n\r\ncases  - I know that from time to time we have five Judges,  but\r\n\r\nthat  is  very  rare  -  we could have five  Judges  sitting  in\r\n\r\nimportant  cases,  whether it is criminal law or  constitutional\r\n\r\nlaw.  In this way, Sir, we would have greater participation  and\r\n\r\nI  think  the public interest will be served.  I have  discussed\r\n\r\nthis  matter with senior lawyers and they are supportive of this\r\n\r\nmove.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move to another area of concern, and I know I am\r\n\r\ngoing  to touch on a very sensitive issue.  Drug offences, which\r\n\r\nnow  carry a capital offence, are heard in the High Court whilst\r\n\r\ncases  which  carry  20 years' imprisonment  are  heard  in  the\r\n\r\nDistrict  Court.   I am suggesting that these  cases  should  be\r\n\r\ntransferred to a Special Court which could be headed  by  either\r\n\r\nSenior District Judges or senior members of the Bar.  I say this\r\n\r\nbecause  it  costs the public immense amounts of money  to  hear\r\n\r\nthese   cases.    And  after  all,  our  District   Judges   are\r\n\r\ninterpreting  the  law (Misuse of Drugs  Act)  every  day.   The\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  law is the same.  Unlike murder and  treason  and\r\n\r\nother  capital  cases which are heard in High Court,  crimes  of\r\n\r\npassion, I call it, you have the mens rea, you have all sorts of\r\n\r\ndefences, and the Judges have to be experienced.  But I  see  no\r\n\r\nreason why the law which is applied in the District Court cannot\r\n\r\nbe  applied to these cases.  For the benefit of Members, let  me\r\n\r\nsay  this.  I was in India recently.  In India, for a long time,\r\n\r\nmurder  cases are heard by District Judges, and a single  Judge.\r\n\r\nI  think  this  is, of course, a very radical departure,  but  I\r\n\r\nthink we ought to look into it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area which I would like the Minister to consider,\r\n\r\nSir,  is this.  We have landlord/tenant cases and accident cases\r\n\r\nstill  being  heard by the High Court, although the jurisdiction\r\n\r\nof the District Court has been increased considerably, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$250,000 now.  I think it would be better to have it transferred\r\n\r\nto  the  District Court, as we have done in the case  of  family\r\n\r\nlaw.  And I think family law is more important than landlord and\r\n\r\ntenant cases.  I urge the Minister to consider this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is running short. Sir, I will just be very brief on\r\n\r\nthe subject of mediation, since Prof. Chin has touched on it.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  urge  the Minister, in  private  summons  cases\r\n\r\ninvolving neighbours and family members, we have a different set\r\n\r\nof  hearing.   Instead of going to the court, let  us  create  a\r\n\r\nCommunity  Tribunal,  and we could do justice.   Because  in  my\r\n\r\nexperience as a member of the Maintenance of Parents Tribunal, I\r\n\r\nhave  found it very conducive to have a hearing where no lawyers\r\n\r\nare  involved, no press is involved.  And I think the  Community\r\n\r\nTribunal  could  be a proper forum to hear cases,  and  not  the\r\n\r\nDistrict  Court  where  the atmosphere is intimidating  and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, lawyers are always involved.  As a lawyer, I would  urge\r\n\r\nthe House and the Minister to reconsider the position and try to\r\n\r\nuse  mediation  even  on  small-scale  private  summonses  which\r\n\r\ninvolve members of the same family as well as the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, Mr Rai has correctly\r\n\r\nobserved  that  our  courts  have been  proactive,  making  many\r\n\r\ninnovations  to improve the system whenever it has seen  a  need\r\n\r\nfor  such changes.  Here, in this House, Mr Rai has made several\r\n\r\nsuggestions for further changes.  The question is whether  there\r\n\r\nis a need for these changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, he has suggested setting up Special District Courts\r\n\r\nto  hear  certain types of cases, like drug cases, landlord  and\r\n\r\ntenant  cases.   Presently, the District and  Magistrate  Courts\r\n\r\nalready   hear  all  these  cases,  except,  of  course,   those\r\n\r\npunishable  by  death  for drug cases, and within  the  monetary\r\n\r\nlimit  of  $250,000 for the other cases that he  has  mentioned.\r\n\r\nSome  are  heard  in  the High Court which,  I  understand,  the\r\n\r\nwaiting  period, in fact, is very short, just a few weeks.   And\r\n\r\nthe waiting periods are also constantly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonitored by the High Court.  So we feel that there is  no  need\r\n\r\nto transfer everything to the Special District Courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The division of jurisdiction and cases between the High\r\n\r\nCourt  and  Subordinate Courts, in fact, has been  effective  in\r\n\r\nadjudicating   these  matters  that  Mr  Rai   mentions.    Case\r\n\r\nprecedents  have been developed over a period of time  in  these\r\n\r\ncases.   Mr  Rai mentions the Family District Court.  Indeed,  a\r\n\r\nSpecial  Court  was  set up in the District  Court,  called  the\r\n\r\nFamily  District Court, and matters which were originally  heard\r\n\r\nin  the  High  Court were transferred down.  But he would  agree\r\n\r\nthat  family  matters are quite different.  Family,  matrimonial\r\n\r\nmatters,  with its complexity involve not just legal issues  but\r\n\r\nalso social issues.  And indeed having a Special Court set up at\r\n\r\na District Court level has allowed the Court to be very creative\r\n\r\nin  using  counselling  resources, community  resources  in  the\r\n\r\nfamily justice process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other suggestion of Mr Rai is whether or not our Court\r\n\r\nof  Appeal could have five Judges hearing the appeals.  In fact,\r\n\r\nas  he himself has mentioned, currently under section 30 of  the\r\n\r\nSupreme Court of Judicature Act, the provision is already  there\r\n\r\nfor  the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the Court of  Appeal\r\n\r\nto  be exercised by three or any greater uneven number of Judges\r\n\r\nof  Appeal.  Appeals are generally heard by a three-Judge  Court\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, which is adequate.  But there have been cases  in\r\n\r\nthe  past,  important  cases, where  the Chief  Justice  in  his\r\n\r\ndiscretion  had constituted a five-man Court of Appeal  to  hear\r\n\r\nsuch cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the point is that there is no need really to\r\n\r\ninstitutionalise  it,  because then you have  five  Judges,  and\r\n\r\nresources are used up in a Court of Appeal hearing just appeals.\r\n\r\nSo  I  think the current position is good enough where you  have\r\n\r\nthis  flexibility reposed in the Chief Justice to  constitute  a\r\n\r\nfive-man Court of Appeal when the need arises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point that Mr Rai mentions is whether or not\r\n\r\ncriminal  matters  involving private  summons  and  other  minor\r\n\r\noffences  should  not,  in fact, be mediated  at  the  community\r\n\r\nlevel.  With the setting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup  of  the  Community Mediation Centres, indeed this  is  being\r\n\r\ndone.   Because  there is one rule, under  the  CMC  Act,  which\r\n\r\nspells out the powers of the Community Mediation Centres whereby\r\n\r\nin  a suitable case, a Magistrate hearing a complaint of a minor\r\n\r\ndispute  involving a criminal nature - it could  be  voluntarily\r\n\r\ncausing hurt or mischief - could ask the parties to go to a  CMC\r\n\r\nto  settle the dispute, but, of course, with their consent.   So\r\n\r\nthe process is there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CMCs are fairly new. We have just set up our first\r\n\r\nCommunity  Mediation Centre at Marine Parade, which  has  worked\r\n\r\nwell.   And  10  or so of such cases were, in a sense,  diverted\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Magistrate  Courts to be heard before  the  Community\r\n\r\nMediation Centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say a few words about the development of the CMC\r\n\r\nwhich is something of interest to Mr Rai and also to Prof. Chin.\r\n\r\nThe first centre was set up in Marine Parade CDC in January.  We\r\n\r\nare targeting to set up a second centre somewhere in the central\r\n\r\npart  of Singapore, probably in the Ang Mo Kio/Cheng San CDC  to\r\n\r\nbe  operational  by the end of this year.  Thereafter,  we  will\r\n\r\nassess. We plan to set up two more centres to serve the northern\r\n\r\nand  western regions of Singapore, probably by the  end  of  the\r\n\r\nyear 2000.  So that is our game plan.  Four centres in the east,\r\n\r\ncentral, north and west.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin talks about the need to have trained mediators.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, this is the heart of mediation, and much efforts  have\r\n\r\nbeen  expended  by  the  Ministry of Law's  Alternative  Dispute\r\n\r\nResolution  Division in this matter.  As a  foundation,  a  core\r\n\r\ngroup  of  trained  mediators has  been  assembled.   These  are\r\n\r\nexperienced  mediators who are lawyers and other  professionals,\r\n\r\nas  well  as mediators from the Singapore Mediation Centre.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  suitable grassroots leaders from diverse  backgrounds\r\n\r\nhave   been  assembled  and  trained.   They  include  a  school\r\n\r\nprincipal, a retiree, a doctor and two managers.  So  this  core\r\n\r\ngroup  is  the first group that will do mediation at the  Marine\r\n\r\nParade CDC, comprising about 30 in number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first CMC at Marine Parade has made a good start. So\r\n\r\nfar, 14 cases have been successfully mediated, and 20 more cases\r\n\r\nare  scheduled  to be mediated over the next  few  months.   And\r\n\r\nfeedback   from   residents  have  shown  they  appreciate   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  they  now  have  to have  their  disputes  resolved\r\n\r\namicably  at  the  CMC.   So  as more  CMCs  are  set  up,  more\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders will be identified for  the  task.   As  you\r\n\r\nknow, the plan is to co-locate CMCs with Small Claims Tribunals.\r\n\r\nSo over time, Singaporeans will find convenient one-stop centres\r\n\r\nwhere  they  can  have small claims as well  as  minor  disputes\r\n\r\nsettled at one location.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> \"Guillotine\" time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $63,564,790 for Head E ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $23,924,900 for Head E ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head B -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head B Attorney-General's Chambers.

I am sure  Members  are\r\n\r\naware  that  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  most  of  the  other\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  countries, the Attorney-General  is  a  Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament.   He is appointed from Parliament upon  election  of\r\n\r\nthe  new government and he holds office for the duration of that\r\n\r\ngovernment.  That is not the situation in Singapore, although  I\r\n\r\nstand corrected on this, I think the Constitution does allow for\r\n\r\nsomeone from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  elected Members to be appointed as Attorney-General and for\r\n\r\nhim to vacate his office upon the dissolution of Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have an Attorney-General appointed outside\r\n\r\nParliament.   So  the Attorney-General is not in  Parliament  to\r\n\r\nanswer questions and any questions on his decisions are answered\r\n\r\nat second hand by the Minister.  The Attorney-General, as Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor,   serves   a   very  important   function   in   the\r\n\r\nadministration  of  justice.  He is, no less  than  the  judges,\r\n\r\nadministering  justice  and ensuring that  justice  is  done  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   And he is therefore accountable in respect  of  his\r\n\r\ndecisions as Public Prosecutor, just as judges are.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said more than once that when judges try a\r\n\r\ncase,  they themselves are on trial by the public watching  over\r\n\r\nthe conduct of the case and the reasons that they give for their\r\n\r\ndecisions.   So should the Public Prosecutor not be  accountable\r\n\r\nto  the public through Parliament for any decisions he makes  in\r\n\r\nhis  capacity as the Public Prosecutor?  It cannot be said  that\r\n\r\nbecause  the  prosecutions are vested in him and it  is  in  his\r\n\r\ndiscretion  that  he  is not therefore accountable  to  anybody.\r\n\r\nThis was somewhat the answer given by the Minster of State, when\r\n\r\nI   asked  about  the  directors  of  Keppel,  that  the  Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor decides in his discretion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two matters lately on which the decision of the\r\n\r\nPublic  Prosecutor has been called into question.  One of course\r\n\r\nwas  his  refusing to prosecute the Prime Minister and  the  two\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Ministers and the other Members of the ruling Party\r\n\r\nfor   having,  what  we  say,  violated  the  section   in   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Elections Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, there are three more\r\n\r\nspeakers after you.  You have got three more minutes left.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes, I will be very brief. I must finish\r\n\r\nthis.  For me, it is an important subject.  Of course, the other\r\n\r\nwas  his not prosecuting the directors of Keppel.  In the  first\r\n\r\ninstance, we had a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwritten  explanation.   But  may I  say  I  found  that  written\r\n\r\nexplanation  most unsatisfactory.  May I say that a  great  many\r\n\r\nmembers   of   the   public  did  not  find   that   explanation\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.  In the case of the directors, there was  even  no\r\n\r\nwritten explanation.  All we had was the explanation, as a guess\r\n\r\nby  the Minister of State, as to what may have guided the Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor.  May I ask whether we can have the Public Prosecutor\r\n\r\ndevise  a  system or machinery whereby the Public Prosecutor  is\r\n\r\nmade  to  explain  in public the reasons for  his  decisions  as\r\n\r\nPublic Prosecutor where they are called into question?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment is the separation of functions. May I\r\n\r\nsuggest  to  the  Minister that there is a lot to  be  said  for\r\n\r\nseparating  the  functions of the AG and the Public  Prosecutor.\r\n\r\nThe AG is the chief legal advisor of the Government.  The Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor has a different role to play.  In the United Kingdom,\r\n\r\nwe  have  a  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  who  makes  the\r\n\r\ndecisions.   No  doubt,  he  is made accountable  to  Parliament\r\n\r\nthrough  the  Attorney-General.  Is it not possible  for  us  to\r\n\r\nconsider now separating the functions of the Attorney-General as\r\n\r\nchief  legal advisor from his functions as the Public Prosecutor\r\n\r\nby appointment of a Director of Public Prosecutions?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I am rather surprised that Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  should  question the right of the Attorney-General's\r\n\r\noffice.  He himself is a trained lawyer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Are you answering?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I am giving my views. Would you bear\r\n\r\npatience with me?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is not much time left, so just proceed\r\n\r\nwith your speech, please.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, the office of the Attorney-General\r\n\r\nis  a  constitutional appointment and he has the sole discretion\r\n\r\nto  prosecute or not to prosecute.  And we in this House  should\r\n\r\nnever question it.  To do so would be to undermine the office of\r\n\r\nthe  Attorney-General.  The Attorney-General is assisted by  the\r\n\r\nSolicitor-General, and I will come to that later.  What I  would\r\n\r\nlike to say is that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  many  countries the office of the Attorney-General has  been\r\n\r\npoliticised but, here, it is separate from the Executive.  He is\r\n\r\nnot  accountable  to Parliament and we should  not  in  any  way\r\n\r\nquestion the discretion vested in the office.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the Solicitor-General, Sir. The Solicitor-General is the next senior person in the most important office\r\n\r\nof  the  land  and,  regrettably, I see no appointment  to  this\r\n\r\noffice  after the retirement of the last Solicitor-General.   It\r\n\r\nis  indeed  a  sad reflection and I think there is  no  lack  of\r\n\r\nchallenge either in the legal service or outside.  To have  this\r\n\r\nimportant office vacant for such a long time does not speak well\r\n\r\nfor our judicial and legal system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other topic I would like to touch on is plea\r\n\r\nbargaining.   Sir, whether it is white crime or any crime  under\r\n\r\nthe  Penal  Code,  the accused person may be prepared  to  plead\r\n\r\nguilty  or to plea bargain with the Attorney-General's Chambers.\r\n\r\nI  am  suggesting  that we should do away with  our  traditional\r\n\r\nBritish  practice  and  follow the American  practice.   If  the\r\n\r\nprosecution  and  the defence can work out a  bargain,  then  it\r\n\r\nwould be in the interest of the community.  Money could be saved\r\n\r\nand  the poor accused will know exactly what he is going to meet\r\n\r\nat  the end of the day.  As it now stands, he does not know what\r\n\r\nsentence  the judge is going to give to him.  So I am suggesting\r\n\r\nthat  we  should look afresh.  I know a lot of lawyers, who  are\r\n\r\nconservative, are not in favour of this.  But I would urge  that\r\n\r\nwe should introduce a new system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of mediation, I know the Attorney-General is committed to sending disputes for mediation. But\r\n\r\nwhat I am suggesting is that whenever the Attorney-General is  a\r\n\r\nparty, either as plaintiff or potential defendant, the Attorney-General's  Chambers should first look at the option of mediation\r\n\r\nand  not wait for a writ to be filed in the court and then  talk\r\n\r\nterms.  I think it would save a lot of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I would like to touch on is the legal\r\n\r\nofficers.   It  would be in the interest of the country  if  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's Chambers pass some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  its  work  to the members of the Bar.  This is practised  in\r\n\r\nother  Commonwealth countries.  In this way, we could save  some\r\n\r\nfunds.  In this way, he could also benefit from seeking opinions\r\n\r\nfrom  members of the Bar on important issues, whether  it  is  a\r\n\r\nconstitutional issue or other issues.  Once again, Sir, I  think\r\n\r\nwe  should  be  loath to question the Attorney-General's  office\r\n\r\nand,  as I have said earlier, it is a constitutional appointment\r\n\r\nand,  as  a  practising member of the Bar,  I  say  let  us  not\r\n\r\nundermine the confidence that the Constitution has given him.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I will respond to Mr Jeyaretnam's\r\n\r\npoints and my colleague, the Minister of State, will respond  to\r\n\r\nMr Shriniwas Rai.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the two points raised by Mr Jeyaretnam, let me first\r\n\r\ndeal with his second point, that is, the point of accountability\r\n\r\nof  Attorney-General as Public Prosecutor.  His  proposition  is\r\n\r\nthat   the  Attorney-General  as  Public  Prosecutor   must   be\r\n\r\naccountable and answerable to this House for his decisions  when\r\n\r\nhis  decisions are queried or called into question with  respect\r\n\r\nto  prosecution.  I think I want to make it clear, Sir,  that  I\r\n\r\ncompletely disagree with his proposition and I would say that it\r\n\r\nwould  be  wholly  wrong  and improper for  us  to  subject  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's prosecutorial decisions to scrutiny  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate. First, let us recapitulate the two key\r\n\r\nfunctions  of  the  Attorney-General under  Article  35  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.   Under Article 35, clause 7, of the Constitution,\r\n\r\nhe  has  two key functions.  One is to advise the Government  on\r\n\r\nsuch legal matters that are referred to him.  The second is  the\r\n\r\nprosecution  function.   The  Attorney-General  shall  have  the\r\n\r\npower,  exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct  or\r\n\r\ndiscontinue  any  proceedings  for  any  offence.    What   does\r\n\r\n\"exercisable at his discretion\" mean?  It surely means  what  it\r\n\r\nsays,  that  he  has,  as holder of that office,  discretion  to\r\n\r\nconduct  or  discontinue any proceedings, whether  to  charge  a\r\n\r\nperson for an offence, under what provision of the Penal Code or\r\n\r\nsome other Act of Parliament for a lesser offence, for a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  serious  offence, and when the trial is on, if  convicted,\r\n\r\nwhat  kind  of  punishment to press the courts.  These  are  all\r\n\r\nprosecutorial  decisions exercisable in his discretion.   He  is\r\n\r\nnot subject to requirements of acting on advice or consultation.\r\n\r\nDoes he mean that he must give an explanation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> On a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> He can clarify later.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, will you resume your seat?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Does the Member mean that after the AG has\r\n\r\ntaken  a  decision, he is answerable to this Chamber  about  his\r\n\r\ndecisions, why he prosecutes in one case and not the other,  why\r\n\r\nhe  appeals in one case and not the other?  I think it  will  be\r\n\r\nwholly   wrong  and  improper  to  proceed  along   the   course\r\n\r\nrecommended by Mr Jeyaretnam.  And  I think we can cite  several\r\n\r\nother reasons.  Apart from the fact that it will be contrary  to\r\n\r\nthe  express provision of Article 35, because we cannot  say  in\r\n\r\none  breath  that the Attorney-General has power exercisable  in\r\n\r\nhis  discretion  and, in the same breath, ask him  to  have  his\r\n\r\ndecisions subject to legislative scrutiny, questioning or debate\r\n\r\nin this Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that it is in the public interest that\r\n\r\nthe  Attorney-General should make his decisions on such  matters\r\n\r\nunencumbered, without any fear or worry that the matter will  be\r\n\r\nsubject to scrutiny in this Chamber.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, let us recall that when the Attorney-General\r\n\r\ndecides to prosecute in any particular matter, he does so on two\r\n\r\nmain  principles:  (a) whether there is sufficient  evidence  to\r\n\r\nproceed;   (b)  whether  there  is  a  prima  facie   case   for\r\n\r\nprosecution.   If  there is a prima facie case for  prosecution,\r\n\r\nwhether there is some public interest element against it.  These\r\n\r\nare two considerations that are generally\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecognised    in    Commonwealth   jurisdictions.     In    both\r\n\r\nconsiderations, there is a host of factors which he has to  take\r\n\r\ninto  consideration and evaluate.  He has to make  judgments  on\r\n\r\neach of these factors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, because of these considerations, the Constitution\r\n\r\nhas  placed  the  office of the Attorney-General  on  a  special\r\n\r\nfooting.   I would say on a footing analogous with the  position\r\n\r\nof  Judges.  For example, the Attorney-General's appointment  is\r\n\r\nsubject  to  the safeguard of the President's  veto.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nsafeguarded appointment.  Then Article 35 also has safeguards to\r\n\r\nensure  that he cannot be removed arbitrarily.  The  grounds  on\r\n\r\nwhich  he  can be removed are narrowly framed and the  procedure\r\n\r\nfor  his removal calls for a tribunal of judges, chaired by  the\r\n\r\nChief Justice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, it is not surprising, therefore, that it is an\r\n\r\nestablished  practice in all common law jurisdictions  that  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General will not publish his detailed reasons  for  any\r\n\r\nprosecutorial decisions.  There are very good reasons  for  this\r\n\r\npractice, because if reasons are given in detail, surely it must\r\n\r\nlead to public debate in this House and outside this House about\r\n\r\nthe  case and on the guilt or innocence of the suspect.  It must\r\n\r\nresult  in that.  And it is best that such questions be  decided\r\n\r\nin  the courts and not be subject for trial by public debate  in\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber just because a Member of the House or a Member  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  is  unable to agree with the  legal  advice  or\r\n\r\ndecision of the Attorney-General.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have followed this practice in Singapore for the\r\n\r\npast  30 years, and I think this system has worked well.  If the\r\n\r\nprosecutorial  system  in Singapore is not  to  break  down,  we\r\n\r\nshould continue with this practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point made by Mr Jeyaretnam is that we should\r\n\r\nseparate the functions of the Attorney-General as legal  adviser\r\n\r\nand  Attorney-General as public prosecutor.  I would commend  to\r\n\r\nMr  Jeyaretnam  to  read  a paper called \"Emerging  Problems  in\r\n\r\nDefining  the  Modern Role of the Office of Attorney-General  in\r\n\r\nCommonwealth Countries\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  memorandum prepared for the Commonwealth Secretariat by Prof.\r\n\r\nEdwards  of  Canada,  where he surveyed  Commonwealth  practice.\r\n\r\nThere is no lack of models for us to follow.  In some countries,\r\n\r\nthe  model  is  that the Attorney-General is distinct  from  the\r\n\r\npublic  prosecutor.  In some cases, the public prosecutor  is  a\r\n\r\npublic  officer  and the Attorney-General is  a  member  of  the\r\n\r\nCabinet  or  member of the Legislature.   Where it is  distinct,\r\n\r\nthe  public  prosecutor  is answerable to the  Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  in  most  of the Commonwealth jurisdictions  where  the\r\n\r\nofficers  are  different,  the  public  prosecutor's  role   and\r\n\r\nfunction are answerable to the Attorney-General.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have this system where the Attorney-General has two functions, but this is a system we have had ever\r\n\r\nsince we were independent, and even before independence.  It was\r\n\r\nas  a result of a recommendation, and I have been advised by the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General,  which finds its roots in the  Report  of  the\r\n\r\nReid Commission, 1957.  The Reid Commission then recommended  as\r\n\r\nfollows and I quote from paragraph 127:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`. Some Commonwealth countries, the Attorney-General holds\r\n\r\na political office.  In others, the political functions normally\r\n\r\nexercised by a political Attorney-General exercised by  Minister\r\n\r\nof  Justice  or  Minister for Law.  While  the  Attorney-General\r\n\r\nexercises  the more professional functions of giving independent\r\n\r\nlegal  advice to the government, representing the government  in\r\n\r\nthe  courts  and  perhaps  assuming  responsibility  for  public\r\n\r\nprosecution.  On the whole, we prefer the latter.'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a system we have had since independence and before\r\n\r\nindependence.   It has worked well and I see no  reason  why  we\r\n\r\nshould change it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that, ultimately, it boils down to the strength\r\n\r\nof  character and personal integrity of the holder of the office\r\n\r\nthat is of paramount importance when we look at the position  of\r\n\r\nthe Attorney-General.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that there is no accountability. The\r\n\r\nAttorney-General  is  a constitutional  office.   I  reject  the\r\n\r\nnotion  of Mr Jeyaretnam that his individual decisions  must  be\r\n\r\nsubject  to  scrutiny  in this Parliament.   But  the  Attorney-General  is  accountable to the Government  in  discharging  the\r\n\r\nfunctions of his office,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Constitution provides that he may be removed  from\r\n\r\noffice by the President if he, acting in his discretion, concurs\r\n\r\nwith the advice of the Prime Minister.  Under Article 35 of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution,  there are grounds for removal  of  the  Attorney-General.  And as I have mentioned, he may be removed from office\r\n\r\nonly  on  narrow  grounds and similar to  the  grounds  and  the\r\n\r\nprocedure provided for Judges of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also add that the office of the Attorney-General\r\n\r\ncarries with it very important functions and powers which cannot\r\n\r\nbe  abused.  If there is any abuse and any infraction, it  will,\r\n\r\nof   course,  carry  with  it  consequences  if  allegations  of\r\n\r\nimpropriety are substantiated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members have forgotten, in 1988, the example to drive\r\n\r\nhome   the  point  that  holders  of  public  office  will  have\r\n\r\nallegations of impropriety examined has been firmly established.\r\n\r\nBecause in January 1988, the then Prime Minister, in respect  of\r\n\r\nrumours and allegations of impropriety of the previous Attorney-General, categorically stated and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Every allegation made against any official of corrupt,\r\n\r\nillegal or improper conduct or action will be investigated.  The\r\n\r\nfact  that  the  official complained against  is  the  Attorney-General,  the highest legal officer in charge of investigations,\r\n\r\nwill not prevent such investigations.'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The allegations in that particular case had been\r\n\r\ninvestigated and they were unfounded.'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add what the then Prime Minister said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If they had been substantiated, the Attorney-General would\r\n\r\nhave had to face the consequences.'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\nThe point I am making, Sir, is that the holder of the office  of\r\n\r\nAttorney-General  has important functions  and  duties.   If  he\r\n\r\nexercises  his functions and duties in a manner that amounts  to\r\n\r\nabuse  or impropriety, there will be a proper investigation  and\r\n\r\nconsequences.  But that is separate from the point  made  by  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  that  just  because  he  disagrees  with  individual\r\n\r\ndecisions of the Attorney-General on particular cases that  that\r\n\r\ndecision must then be subject to scrutiny\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  this Chamber, and the Attorney-General has to be accountable\r\n\r\nand answerable and to give reasons for his decision.  As I said,\r\n\r\nthat  will be wholly improper and unwise to do so.  We have  not\r\n\r\ndone  it  for some 30 years and I commend to the House  that  we\r\n\r\ncontinue to stay that course.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Ho.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, may I, by way of clarification\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Let us give other Members a chance to have\r\n\r\ntheir answers first.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I think I should respond to\r\n\r\nMr  Rai  who has made a few points.  His first point is on  plea\r\n\r\nbargaining.  Plea bargaining or charge bargaining involving  the\r\n\r\nprosecution  is well established in Singapore.  But  as  Mr  Rai\r\n\r\nexplained,  what  he has in mind is the American  form  of  plea\r\n\r\nbargaining which involves not only the prosecution but the judge\r\n\r\nas  well.  The procedure is for the parties to appear before the\r\n\r\njudge  and  seek his views on the type or spectrum of  sentences\r\n\r\nthat  the judge will impose if the accused person were to  plead\r\n\r\nguilty  on   a  set  of facts given to the judge.   The  accused\r\n\r\nperson  will then decide whether or not to plead guilty  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis of the judge's indication.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have studied this alternative approach carefully\r\n\r\nbut have concluded that there is no need for plea bargaining  of\r\n\r\nthis  nature.  It is not superior to the present system.   There\r\n\r\nare  advantages and disadvantages.  As Mr Rai has mentioned, the\r\n\r\nmain advantage is that it may save the State time and effort, in\r\n\r\nhaving to prepare for the case only to find out that the accused\r\n\r\nperson  would have pleaded guilty much earlier if  he  had  been\r\n\r\ntold  what  the  sentence  would be.  However,  there  are  also\r\n\r\ndisadvantages which, in our view, outweigh this advantage.   The\r\n\r\nmain  one  is that the whole process can go to waste  where  the\r\n\r\naccused  person  does  not accept the indication  given  by  the\r\n\r\njudge,  resulting  in the case having to be postponed,  so  that\r\n\r\nanother judge can take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover the case.  In Singapore, it may not be possible to insulate\r\n\r\nother  judges  from knowing that the accused person  had  sought\r\n\r\nplea  bargaining.  So this could prejudice the accused if he  is\r\n\r\ntried before another judge who is aware of the failed attempt at\r\n\r\nplea bargaining.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that Mr Rai mentions is mediation. The\r\n\r\nAttorney-General is, by law, the nominal defendant in all  civil\r\n\r\nsuits  against  the Government.  Not all actions,  however,  are\r\n\r\nsuitable for mediation.  If they are, the AG's intention  is  to\r\n\r\nadvise Ministries concerned to proceed to mediation first before\r\n\r\ntrial.   In  addition, the AG's Chambers support the initiatives\r\n\r\npresently under way to expand mediation.  As a general rule, the\r\n\r\nChambers will propose mediation in all disputes where  it  is  a\r\n\r\nparty.   In  fact,  the  Chambers advise Ministries  to  include\r\n\r\nmediation clauses in all Government contracts where mediation is\r\n\r\nappropriate.  These clauses provide for parties to first attempt\r\n\r\nto  resolve  their differences in accordance with the procedures\r\n\r\nof the Singapore Mediation Centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point Mr Rai raises is why not AG farm out work to\r\n\r\nprivate  practitioners.   The AG's Chambers  have  a  system  of\r\n\r\nemploying legal officers on contract when there is a need.

In  the\r\n\r\nlast  one  year, the Singapore dollar exchange rate has weakened\r\n\r\nfrom  about 1.42 to the US dollar in mid-1997 to a low of nearly\r\n\r\n1.8  towards the end of 1997.  Now, it is hovering at about 1.62\r\n\r\nto  1.65.  The Singapore dollar has depreciated some 13% against\r\n\r\nthe US dollar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Singapore dollar has weakened against the US\r\n\r\ndollar,  it  has  strengthened against the regional  currencies.\r\n\r\nCompared  to  the  Thai baht, Malaysian ringgit  and  Indonesian\r\n\r\nrupiah, the Singapore dollar has appreciated by between 20%  and\r\n\r\n50%.   My  question to the Minister is: what is the Government's\r\n\r\nshort to medium term strategy for the Singapore dollar?  On  the\r\n\r\none  hand,  a  strong  Singapore dollar  will  enable  Singapore\r\n\r\ncompanies to purchase foreign goods at low prices.  It will help\r\n\r\nto  keep  domestic inflation low.  On the other hand,  a  strong\r\n\r\nSingapore dollar will cost Singapore to lose its competitiveness\r\n\r\nagainst  the  neighbouring countries.   Our  manufacturers  will\r\n\r\nsuffer  a disadvantage.  Their products will now be dearer  than\r\n\r\nproducts in the neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this period of great volatility, it may be difficult\r\n\r\nfor  the Government to stabilise the Singapore dollar.  However,\r\n\r\nin  view  of  the  sudden shifts in the exchange  rates  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  currencies against the Singapore dollar, the Government\r\n\r\nmay need to do a review of its exchange rate policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister enlighten the House on how the\r\n\r\nGovernment  intend  to balance the conflicting  effects  of  the\r\n\r\nstrength of the Singapore dollar?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, one year ago, the\r\n\r\nSingapore dollar was strengthening against the US dollar and  to\r\n\r\nsome  extent  against  the regional currencies  and  this  badly\r\n\r\nimpacted the cost of doing business in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToday,  the  regional  currencies  have  devalued  substantially\r\n\r\nagainst the US dollar and against the Singapore dollar while our\r\n\r\ndollar remains relatively strong against most OECD countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister the following\r\n\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, just as Mr Leong has asked, can the Singapore\r\n\r\ndollar  remain  strong at the current level for our  economy  to\r\n\r\ncontinue   to   be   competitive  or   will   this   erode   our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  against our neighbours  and  also  against  the\r\n\r\ncountries in North Asia?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent report in the Business Times, it was argued\r\n\r\nthat  the  Singapore dollar needed to be around $1.83  (at  that\r\n\r\ntime   comparing  against  the  value  of  other   North   Asian\r\n\r\ncurrencies)  for our exports to the west to remain  competitive.\r\n\r\nIn   fact,  the  report  suggested  the  sensitivity  of  export\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  to  the  value of the  North  Asian  currencies\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Singapore dollar and should these currencies  fall\r\n\r\nsome more, the Singapore dollar will have to devalue accordingly\r\n\r\nto  remain  competitive.  I would  like to  ask  the  Minister's\r\n\r\nopinion on this report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, what can the Monetary Authority of Singapore or\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Finance do to moderate interest rate  increases\r\n\r\nwhich have risen three times in the past six months?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do believe that the Ministry or the MAS should set a\r\n\r\nstrategic  direction  for  both  the  dollar  strength  and  the\r\n\r\ninterest  rates while it minimises interferences in other  areas\r\n\r\nby  letting  market forces rule.  Of course, certain fundamental\r\n\r\nparameters of the economy must still be the instruments that the\r\n\r\nGovernment can handle, to turn the knobs to set the general long\r\n\r\nterm of the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I feel that the strength of the dollar and the\r\n\r\ninterest rates are something that the Minister should moderate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, my two other colleagues, Mr Leong\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Inderjit Singh, have already spoken on this matter.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to ask the Minister two questions.  First  of  all,\r\n\r\nwhether  he is happy with the present arrangement in our  basket\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncurrencies  or  whether we should change the  composition.   The\r\n\r\nother  concern  is that lots of Singaporeans have  this  nagging\r\n\r\nquestion:  what  would  be the exchange rate  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\ndollar in months to come?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike other countries, Singaporeans have faith in their\r\n\r\ncurrency.  They have not gone to the money changers to change or\r\n\r\nput  their  money  in fixed deposits.  This shows  the  inherent\r\n\r\nstrength  of  the Singapore dollar.  But, as Mr  Inderjit  Singh\r\n\r\npointed  out  earlier, we have to also look at the  exports  and\r\n\r\nsince the regional currencies have actually fluctuated and  gone\r\n\r\ndown  considerably, what are the Minister's options in case  the\r\n\r\nregional currencies go further down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I would like the Minister to answer is:\r\n\r\nwhat  would MAS do to see that the interest rate does not go  on\r\n\r\nrising?   In fact, we have three increases within the  last  few\r\n\r\nmonths.   It  is important that doing business does  not  become\r\n\r\nexpensive,  and  mortgage loan does not become expensive,  which\r\n\r\nwill affect the man at large.  Even a quarter point increase  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  quite painful.  So I would urge the  Minister  to\r\n\r\naddress these issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim Swee Say is not speaking. Mr Sin.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, the Companies Act presently seeks to\r\n\r\nprotect members of the public by requiring any public invitation\r\n\r\nto  apply  for  shares or similar instruments to be  distributed\r\n\r\ntogether  with  the  prospectus, a  copy  of  which  has  to  be\r\n\r\nregistered with the Registrar. The prospectus referred to in the\r\n\r\nAct  is  a statement containing very detailed disclosures  about\r\n\r\nthe  company. These are matters which directors are required  by\r\n\r\nstatute to be disclosed.  These disclosures range, for instance,\r\n\r\nfrom a description of the directors of the company, its property\r\n\r\ntransactions to the interest of the directors in a property that\r\n\r\nthe company may have an interest in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not my intention to go into a complete\r\n\r\ndescription  of  the  requirements of  a  prospectus  under  the\r\n\r\nCompanies  Act.  Suffice it to note that doing a  due  diligence\r\n\r\nwith  the  company  directors  to ensure  the  accuracy  of  the\r\n\r\nstatements  in  the prospectus is a tedious and  time  consuming\r\n\r\nexercise.  However, the effort put to the exercise provides  the\r\n\r\ninvestors  some  assurance  that the statements  are  reasonably\r\n\r\naccurate  and it helps the investors to make informed  decisions\r\n\r\nabout  their  investments.   For the directors  who  make  false\r\n\r\nstatements  or statements which they do not have  any  basis  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  in,  they  face  the prospect of criminal  prosecution.\r\n\r\nThis   is  sufficient  deterrent  to  most  directors  who   may\r\n\r\ncontemplate such acts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unfortunately, the standard of protection which the\r\n\r\nlaw  affords  to  members of the public does not  appear  to  be\r\n\r\nuniform.  In the interest of time, let me just cite one example.\r\n\r\nWhile  a promoter who invites members of the public to subscribe\r\n\r\nfor  shares  in his company is required, among other things,  to\r\n\r\nfile  a  prospectus giving a detailed account about the company,\r\n\r\nits  accounts and its directors, the same standard of disclosure\r\n\r\nis  not  applied  to  property developers.   Presently,  foreign\r\n\r\ndevelopers  promoting properties overseas in  Singapore  do  not\r\n\r\ncome under the same regime of regulation as would a promoter  of\r\n\r\nshares.   As far as I am aware, the property developer, once  he\r\n\r\nregisters  his  business,  is practically  free  to  launch  his\r\n\r\nproject  and  sells such developments to members of the  public.\r\n\r\nIf  a  foreign promoter seeks the assistance of a local property\r\n\r\nagent, the Inland Revenue Authority places the responsibility on\r\n\r\nthe  property  agent to check the credentials of the  developer.\r\n\r\nEven  then  such checks may be publicly qualified  and  it  then\r\n\r\nbecomes caveat emptor for the buyer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens then is that the foreign developers of\r\n\r\ndifferent shades of honesty sell projects in Singapore.   Unwary\r\n\r\nSingapore buyers who have not done their due diligence may  well\r\n\r\nend  up buying a property which is a lemon of an investment, and\r\n\r\nwith limited recourse against the promoter who probably by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  has either disappeared or is insolvent.  We have seen such\r\n\r\nfailures  in recent months with respect to property projects  in\r\n\r\nChina.    Singaporeans  who  have  invested  in  some  of  these\r\n\r\ndevelopments  have been sent on a wild goose  chase  to  recover\r\n\r\ntheir  investments.  Property purchasers are just  one  example.\r\n\r\nIn  recent years, some other forms of investments have surfaced,\r\n\r\nwhich raise basic questions of adequacy of regulations under our\r\n\r\npresent   system  of  laws.   I  refer  to  time-share  schemes,\r\n\r\ninvestments in ostrich farms and other soft commodities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems strange to me that the law should provide one\r\n\r\nstandard  of  protection for one type of investors  and  another\r\n\r\nstandard or an absence thereof for another type of investor.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  ask the Minister whether the  Government  would\r\n\r\nconsider  bringing the regulatory standards for such  investment\r\n\r\npromotions  to  be in line with or surpass that which  presently\r\n\r\napply  to  the offer of shares to members of the public.   I  am\r\n\r\naware  that  the Government is looking at regulating  time-share\r\n\r\nschemes.   I wonder if the Minister can at the same time  hasten\r\n\r\nthe review.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, the Minister for Trade and Industry\r\n\r\nrecently  announced that the future twin engines  of  growth  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  economy will be the manufacturing  sector  and  the\r\n\r\nservices sector.  I support this strategy.  A major component of\r\n\r\nthe  services  sector is the banking industry.  The Government's\r\n\r\ndesire  is  to  firmly establish Singapore as a  financial  hub.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the financial and business sector now contributes  to\r\n\r\nabout  30.9%  of  the total GDP, as compared to  24.3%  for  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional turmoil shows the frailty of the smaller banks\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  When hit by bad or doubtful loans, the provisions\r\n\r\nmade  by  them  have a heavy impact on their profits  and  total\r\n\r\nassets base.  The larger banks are better placed to weather  the\r\n\r\nimpact.   Hence,  I would like to ask the Minister  whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment intends to foster the mergers of local banks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table shows a comparison of the sizes of\r\n\r\nlocal  banks as compared to the major international banks.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  our  big four banks, DBS, OCBC, UOB and  OUB,  have  a\r\n\r\ntotal  shareholders' fund of between $3 billion and $7  billion.\r\n\r\nThe  big  banks  around the world, for example,  HSBC  has  S$47\r\n\r\nbillion, Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi has S$46 billion, Group Credit\r\n\r\nAgricole has S$37 billion, Chase Manhattan has S$34 billion  and\r\n\r\nCiticorp  has S$33.5 billion.  The above comparison  shows  that\r\n\r\nour  largest local banks are only about one-fifth to one-seventh\r\n\r\nof  the  size  of the world's largest foreign banks.   If  local\r\n\r\nbanks  were  to  merge, they will be better  placed  to  compete\r\n\r\ninternationally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another topic, Sir, the Government has announced the\r\n\r\nreduction  of  the  total  qualifying non-resident  funds  under\r\n\r\nmanagement for preferential tax treatment from $10 billion to $5\r\n\r\nbillion.   I understand that most local banks  are not  able  to\r\n\r\nqualify  because they do not manage offshore funds  of  over  $5\r\n\r\nbillion. I would like to ask the Minister to consider whether it\r\n\r\ncould  adopt a two-tier approach.  For example, to keep  the  $5\r\n\r\nbillion   qualifying  level  for  foreign  banks  and  a   lower\r\n\r\nqualifying level of, say, $2.5 billion for local fund managers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, the banking sector is an important\r\n\r\npart of our GDP.  Our banking sector has growth potentiality. Mr\r\n\r\nLeong  has urged for mergers of local banks and DPM had  earlier\r\n\r\nindicated to this House that he would encourage mergers.  But  I\r\n\r\nthink  the   Government may have to take a  lead  in  persuading\r\n\r\nthese  banks  to merge earlier than planned so that  they  could\r\n\r\ntake  advantage  of the regional opportunities  that  are  being\r\n\r\noffered,  like  what DBS has done by going into Thailand,  which\r\n\r\nother banks may want to consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other points which I would like to make is this. Banks\r\n\r\nare  an important part of our institution. They should regularly\r\n\r\npublish  their results and I would urge that they should  do  so\r\n\r\nevery three months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  would be very transparent and transparency will help  both\r\n\r\nthe  shareholders  as  well as the public  in  knowing  how  the\r\n\r\nparticular bank is doing.\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern which I would like to raise is this. In\r\n\r\nthe past, the banks in Singapore have been also allowed to trade\r\n\r\nin  shares.   In view of the opening of fund management  to  the\r\n\r\noutside  world,  should  we also encourage  and  give  different\r\n\r\ncriteria  to  our  banks, but not as high as required  for  fund\r\n\r\nmanagers?   I  think  the banks should also seriously  think  of\r\n\r\nthese  areas  if  they want to compete with other  international\r\n\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I will answer the points on the\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollar  and  the  banking  issues,  and  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  will  take the point from Mr Sin Boon  Ann  concerning\r\n\r\ninvestment disclosure rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the Singapore dollar. As Members know, we manage\r\n\r\nit  flexibly  against  a  trade-weighted basket  of  currencies,\r\n\r\ncomprising  Singapore's major trading partners.  We  revise  the\r\n\r\nbasket from time to time.  We believe it is reasonable, in  line\r\n\r\nwith  our  trade  patterns now.  We have no immediate  plans  to\r\n\r\nchange  it.   We have strengthened against the ASEAN  currencies\r\n\r\nsignificantly but, as you know, we have weakened against the  US\r\n\r\ndollar  and other major currencies.  So on a trade-weight basis,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore dollar has been relatively stable.  In  fact,  it\r\n\r\nhas  appreciated slightly since July last year when the  trouble\r\n\r\nstarted.   It has enabled Singapore to maintain price  stability\r\n\r\nwhile  protecting  the  overall competitiveness  of  the  export\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will happen if our neighbouring currencies go down\r\n\r\nfurther?   Will  we drive down, do we need to go down  to  match\r\n\r\ntheir competitiveness?  As I have explained, I think in the last\r\n\r\nsitting, the countries whose currencies have depreciated against\r\n\r\nus,  we  expect  will experience high inflation, and  this  will\r\n\r\nerode their competitiveness over time.  We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  already  seeing this in Indonesia - very high inflation  in\r\n\r\nJanuary, even higher in February.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is the real effective exchange rate which matters and\r\n\r\nnot  the nominal effective exchange rate.  Therefore, I  do  not\r\n\r\nsee  us  having  to make major adjustments to our  policy  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of regional currency movements.  As we have said, in MAS,\r\n\r\nour  policy is not on auto-pilot.  There is a trade weight which\r\n\r\nwe  monitor, but we exercise judgment in deciding how closely to\r\n\r\nfollow it over the short term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for interest rates, both Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Rai\r\n\r\nexpressed concern over high interest rates.  Interest rates have\r\n\r\nto  follow  market  trends, market forces and reflect  liquidity\r\n\r\nconditions  in  the  market and risks, and also  interest  rates\r\n\r\noverseas.   We are a very open economy.  So we do not  have  the\r\n\r\nluxury  of  setting  our own independent interest  rate  policy,\r\n\r\napart from what happens overseas and apart from what happens  to\r\n\r\nour   exchange   rate  policy.   They  are  inter-related.    If\r\n\r\nconditions  are tight and banks judge that they  need  a  higher\r\n\r\ninterest  rate  to compensate for the risk of lending,  interest\r\n\r\nrates  will  go up, and the banks will hold more cash.   If  the\r\n\r\nbanks feel more confident of economic circumstances and they are\r\n\r\nprepared to accept a lower margin, then interest rates will tend\r\n\r\nto  be  lower, other things being equal.  So it is not something\r\n\r\nwhich  MAS has a luxury of directly manipulating or influencing.\r\n\r\nI  think we have to accept that.  As I have said, many countries\r\n\r\nhave  got  into  serious trouble because they try  to  influence\r\n\r\ntheir  interest rates one way and their exchange  rates  another\r\n\r\nway.  And when the two policies were incompatible, they crashed,\r\n\r\nand they took a long time to unwind the pieces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think in Singapore, the interest rates are not very high.\r\n\r\nThey went up to 14% briefly, short-term rates, went down back to\r\n\r\n4+%.   Now they are 6+%.  I can understand that companies  which\r\n\r\nhave  borrowed  will worry about every quarter  point  in  their\r\n\r\ninterest  payments.  But we have to accept that.  For the  small\r\n\r\ncompanies,  we have the Local Enterprises Financing Scheme,  and\r\n\r\nthe Finance Minister has announced we are improving\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Scheme and expanding it and putting more capital into it, so\r\n\r\nthat we can lend more to the local companies.  I think that will\r\n\r\nmake a difference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for banking mergers, as I explained on14th January in\r\n\r\nthis  House  soon after Keppel Bank and Tat Lee  Bank  announced\r\n\r\ntheir  intention  to  merge, the Government will  encourage  our\r\n\r\nlocal  banks to merge and will support them bringing in  foreign\r\n\r\nminority  partners  if  they can add technology  and  expertise.\r\n\r\nEach of the banks is financially sound and indeed they are among\r\n\r\nthe soundest in Asia, according to Moody's and according to many\r\n\r\nother  assessment  agencies.  But they add to their  competitive\r\n\r\nstrength  by  merging, as Members have pointed  out.   And  also\r\n\r\nthere  is a question of POSBank and what its role should  be  in\r\n\r\nthe banking system.  That is a policy, but whether they merge or\r\n\r\nthey do not merge, I think the shareholders have to decide.  And\r\n\r\nyou have seen some of the statements made by two of the banks, I\r\n\r\nthink,  in  yesterday's Business Times.  So I believe that  they\r\n\r\nunderstand the imperatives but they want to judge the best time.\r\n\r\nSo we will continue to encourage them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for fund management incentives, Mr Leong asked about the\r\n\r\n$5  billion offshore management incentive and whether we  should\r\n\r\nmake it lower.  I think, if I remember rightly, when the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  announced this incentive, $5 billion  is  not  a  hard\r\n\r\nlower bound.  In other words, even if you do not have $5 billion\r\n\r\nto  manage, you have less, but you are going to do substantially\r\n\r\nmore  than  you  did  before, you can come to  MAS  and  MAS  is\r\n\r\nprepared  to consider giving you tax-free status on your  income\r\n\r\nfrom managing these funds, perhaps not for five years but for  a\r\n\r\nshorter  period.  So the door is not completely closed, even  if\r\n\r\nyou  have  not reached $5 billion.  We know that it is  quite  a\r\n\r\nhigh  target, but I think psychologically that is  not  what  we\r\n\r\nwant to aim for, and it is achievable over a period of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for having two tiers, one tier for local fund managers\r\n\r\nand the other for foreign companies managing funds in Singapore,\r\n\r\nI do not think that is desirable.  I think we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  have  an  even playing field and the same  rules  should\r\n\r\napply, whether you are a local company or a foreign company.  We\r\n\r\noperated  like that with manufacturing.  I think that is  right.\r\n\r\nAnd we should operate it similarly, increasingly, in the case of\r\n\r\nthe finance industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for publishing banks' results quarterly and having more\r\n\r\ntransparency, I think the banks have a Committee under Elizabeth\r\n\r\nSam  now  working on disclosure standards.  I am not  sure  that\r\n\r\nthey  are looking into the question of quarterly publication  of\r\n\r\nresults.   But  it is something which we will  put  to  them  to\r\n\r\nconsider.   There are pros and cons.  The Americans do  it.   It\r\n\r\nused  to  be  thought  that this is too  much  of  a  short-term\r\n\r\napproach  because  everybody  was watching  the  share  pricing.\r\n\r\nEvery wiggle up or down causes great anxiety amongst managements\r\n\r\nwho  have  share options.  So you may have a fixation  with  the\r\n\r\nshort  term rather than the long term.  But since the countries,\r\n\r\nwhich  have  a long term view, ran into some difficulties,  like\r\n\r\nJapan,  this criticism has not been heard so often.  I think  we\r\n\r\nhave  not  been working on quarterly results, but we  have  been\r\n\r\nreasonably  successful.   I would be hesitant  to  change  in  a\r\n\r\nhurry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for banks doing fund management and being encouraged to\r\n\r\ndo so, they already do, not in a very big scale but they do, and\r\n\r\nthere  is  potential for them to build up further.   It  depends\r\n\r\nmainly  on their finding the right team to do this.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  same  sort  of skill or mindset as managing other  people's\r\n\r\nmoney,  deposits, loans.  You need a different set of  instincts\r\n\r\nand  aptitudes, but it is something which we can build  up  over\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Sir, Mr\r\n\r\nSin  Boon  Ann  has  expressed  concern  over  the  variety   of\r\n\r\ninvestment  schemes which have been promoted to the  public  and\r\n\r\nwhether  sufficient protection can be offered  to  them.   As  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  rule,  investment schemes offered by  banks,  insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies   and  other  financial  institutions  are   regulated\r\n\r\ndirectly  or  indirectly by the Monetary Authority of  Singapore\r\n\r\n(MAS) which licenses the institutions.  MAS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nensures  that  the  institutions  are  financially  sound,  that\r\n\r\ninvestors' rights are protected under the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other investment schemes which fall outside the purview of\r\n\r\nMAS are subject to the basic anti-fraud provisions contained  in\r\n\r\nthe Companies Act and the Penal Code.  Members of the public who\r\n\r\nsuspect  fraudulent activity of purveyors of these  schemes  can\r\n\r\nget  in  touch  with  the Commercial Affairs Department  or  the\r\n\r\nPolice.   In  addition, the Consumers Association  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nhelps aggrieved members of the public to seek redress over false\r\n\r\nor misleading advertising and marketing practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is re-examining legislation in certain\r\n\r\nareas.  For example, time-share schemes and schemes run by  soft\r\n\r\ncommodity  brokers.   Relevant  Government  bodies  and   agency\r\n\r\npractitioners  will  be consulted and comparable  provisions  in\r\n\r\nother  countries' legislation will be adopted if they are  found\r\n\r\nappropriate.   This  would  include  the  promotion  of  foreign\r\n\r\nproperties.  And we are now considering the establishment of  an\r\n\r\nEstate Agents Bill which will regulate the sale and promotion of\r\n\r\nforeign properties, although this particular problem is probably\r\n\r\nno longer an issue now that the market is very quiet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress, however, that no regulatory system\r\n\r\ncan  completely  protect  investors  from  making  losses.   And\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  advised  to stay  away  from  any  investment\r\n\r\nschemes   which   are  dubious,  particularly  if   they   offer\r\n\r\nunrealistically  high  returns.   That  is  probably  the   best\r\n\r\nprotection  that I can offer.  Any scheme which  offers  returns\r\n\r\nwhich are unreasonable or even absurd cannot be safe.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I go on to my next cut. In\r\n\r\nSingapore, the tax authorities do not allow the group offsetting\r\n\r\nand  relief  of losses incurred by subsidiaries of  a  group  of\r\n\r\ncompanies.  I understand that the group offsetting of losses  is\r\n\r\nnot  allowed because of concerns on tax loopholes being created.\r\n\r\nHowever, group\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noffsetting is now allowed in some developed countries,  such  as\r\n\r\nthe  United  Kingdom.   In  recent years,  many  companies  have\r\n\r\nanswered the Government's call to venture out regionally.   They\r\n\r\nhave  invested  heavily in the region.  Some of  them  could  be\r\n\r\nencountering  losses because of the regional  knock-down.   They\r\n\r\nare  facing problems of higher overheads, higher manpower costs,\r\n\r\nlower selling prices and larger bad debts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether he could consider\r\n\r\ngroup  offsetting  of  losses as a short-term  measure  to  help\r\n\r\ncompanies  tide over their difficult period.  To  alleviate  the\r\n\r\nrisk  of large tax loopholes, perhaps partial offsetting of  50%\r\n\r\nof their losses could be considered.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng:</b> Sir, in this year's Budget, the\r\n\r\nfinancial sector seems to get the giant share of the incentives.\r\n\r\nIn  a  time of tight credit and falling business volume,  it  is\r\n\r\nonly  fair that some of those tax incentives given to the  banks\r\n\r\nwill  also be given to the non-bank taxpayers.  For example,  an\r\n\r\nadministrative  incentive  has  been  given  to  the  banks   to\r\n\r\neffectively allow tax deductions for unrealised foreign exchange\r\n\r\nlosses  and  tax  unrealised  foreign  exchange  gains.   In  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  a similar concession can also be given to the non-bank\r\n\r\ntaxpayers  such as manufacturers.  Also, the Thai and Indonesian\r\n\r\ngovernments had recently announced changes to their tax  law  to\r\n\r\neven   allow  a  five-year  amortisation  of  exchange   losses.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in this regard, Sir, I hope the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\ncan look into such incentives to help Singapore companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area I wish to bring up is similar to what Mr\r\n\r\nLeong  has  just  pointed out, and that is, on  the  group  loss\r\n\r\nrelief.  At this point, I would like to add that not only UK has\r\n\r\nthis  provision, USA and Australia also have this provision  for\r\n\r\ngroup  loss relief, and it is commercially sound for a group  of\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  be  set  up  for whatever  reasons,  usually  for\r\n\r\ncommercial  and  strategic reasons so  that  they  can  position\r\n\r\nthemselves in the best position to do business.  But  with  this\r\n\r\ncurrency crisis, some companies would be in a loss position  and\r\n\r\nother companies would be in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  tax-paying position.  With this group loss relief, it removes\r\n\r\nthe  unnecessary tax burden on the other members of  the  group.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  hope the Minister for Finance would seriously look  into\r\n\r\nthe possibility of offering such relief to the companies.\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, the point I wish to\r\n\r\nraise  has  somewhat  been covered by Mr Leong  and  Mr  Chuang.\r\n\r\nHowever, it pertains more to SMEs who have gone regional.   Many\r\n\r\nlocal  SMEs were encouraged by the Government in the  course  of\r\n\r\nthe  last  five  years or so to regionalise, to help  create  an\r\n\r\nexternal wing for our economy as a means to sustain growth.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance  has over the  years  also  introduced  a\r\n\r\nvariety  of  tax  measures, such as unilateral  tax  credit  for\r\n\r\ndividend  income, tax exemption schemes for venture capital  and\r\n\r\nregional funds to encourage investments in the Asia Pacific  and\r\n\r\nalso    the    overseas   enterprise   incentive   to    promote\r\n\r\nregionalisation.   The  Government's active  promotion,  coupled\r\n\r\nwith  a  host  of attractive incentives, motivated many  of  our\r\n\r\nlocal SMEs to jump on the bandwagon and set up operations in our\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries.  Unfortunately,  as  a  result  of  the\r\n\r\nunforeseen  currency  crisis, they are  now  finding  themselves\r\n\r\nexposed  and  are  incurring heavy losses  due  to  the  drastic\r\n\r\nexchange rate depreciation, particularly that of the rupiah  and\r\n\r\nthe Thai baht and, to some extent, the Malaysian ringgit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of this fact, I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance to consider the feasibility of allowing  a  one-off\r\n\r\ntax   deduction  or  offset  strictly  arising  from  unrealised\r\n\r\nexchange  losses  for  Singapore  companies  operating  in   the\r\n\r\ncountries  affected  by  the currency  crisis.   The  unrealised\r\n\r\ndeduction  allowed  could  be  monitored  perhaps  by  the   tax\r\n\r\nauthorities and whatever gains, if any, realised at the time the\r\n\r\ntransactions  mature could be recovered back by the  authorities\r\n\r\nin  the  next  accounting period.  Such allowances  will  enable\r\n\r\ncompanies  exposed  to  the region to improve  their  cash  flow\r\n\r\nduring the period of the financial crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, many Members in the last few days\r\n\r\nhave  spoken  about  the critical cash flow problems  that  many\r\n\r\nbusinesses are facing due to the overall slowdown in the region.\r\n\r\nWhile  I  can  understand the Minister's  reluctance  to  reduce\r\n\r\ncorporate  tax by 1% to 2% because we cannot change the  overall\r\n\r\nlong-term  strategy due to transient problems, we therefore  are\r\n\r\nnot  asking  for such changes but rather a one-off extraordinary\r\n\r\naction  like some of the Members have already proposed  for  the\r\n\r\nnext two to three years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to propose the following measures.\r\n\r\nThe  first  one is not new, a one-off 10% to 15% tax rebate  for\r\n\r\nthe  next two years for our businesses.  The second proposal  is\r\n\r\nrelated  to tax deductibility on a group level.  And  the  third\r\n\r\none, to ease cash flow problems, is the allowance for businesses\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  to pay their income tax in instalments  over  the\r\n\r\nnext  two years.  So hopefully, we can have some short-term cash\r\n\r\nflow problems resolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I take the second cut now?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> While I know there have been calls by\r\n\r\nsome  quarters and some Members in this House to reduce the  GST\r\n\r\nby  about 1 or 2 percentage points, I disagree with this because\r\n\r\nthere  are no clear reasons for this at this stage and also  the\r\n\r\n3% that was set some years ago is a realistic level.  My request\r\n\r\nis a very specific one for the purpose of helping the very small\r\n\r\nbusinesses  that cannot afford the resources needed  to  process\r\n\r\nand  keep track of GST collections.  This then becomes a  hassle\r\n\r\nfor  them.   While the $1 million level set as a  threshold  for\r\n\r\nbusinesses that have to apply the GST ruling some four years ago\r\n\r\nmight have been all right, but now, as our economy has grown,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve we can review this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this in mind, I would like to propose the following\r\n\r\ntwo suggestions:  First of all, can the threshold be raised from\r\n\r\n$1 million to $2 million?  For companies that do sales less than\r\n\r\n$2 million per year, I suggest that we no longer need to process\r\n\r\nGST.  This will help them reduce the processing and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanpower  cost, especially for the smaller companies,  and  also\r\n\r\nhopefully  result in lower cost which will be passed on  to  the\r\n\r\nconsumers in the long term.  Secondly, can the GST collection be\r\n\r\ndelayed by about one to two quarters so that the short-term cash\r\n\r\nflow problems can be resolved?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, over the past few years, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has been reducing the property tax rates from  about\r\n\r\n16%  to  12%.   These  reductions  have  helped  those  who  own\r\n\r\ncommercial properties and residential properties which are  held\r\n\r\nas investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, about 90% of Singaporeans own their own homes and\r\n\r\nlive in them.  They pay a lower owner-occupied property tax rate\r\n\r\nof 4%.  This 4% concession has not been reduced for a long time.\r\n\r\nThe  effect  then  is that while people who own  properties  for\r\n\r\ninvestments  have benefited from the reduction of  property  tax\r\n\r\nrate  over  the  years,  the majority of  Singaporeans  are  not\r\n\r\nenjoying  any  property tax reduction for  their  owner-occupied\r\n\r\nproperties.  On the other hand, they are actually paying  higher\r\n\r\nproperty taxes due to higher property tax assessments made  over\r\n\r\nthe  years.   I  would like to ask the Government  whether  they\r\n\r\nwould wish to consider reducing the owner-occupied property  tax\r\n\r\nconcession  by, say, even \ufffd% to 1% so as to give some concession\r\n\r\nto property owners who are owner-occupied.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I would like to ask the Finance Minister\r\n\r\nas  to  why the Government has, for this year's Budget, given  a\r\n\r\n15%  rebate to commercial and industrial properties  only.   Why\r\n\r\nhas  he not decided to include residential properties, at  least\r\n\r\nfor  residential  properties which are held as investments,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  apartments  for lease, rented  apartments  or  service\r\n\r\napartments?  For that matter, why is the rebate of 15% not given\r\n\r\nto   residential  properties  which  are  owner-occupied?    The\r\n\r\nMinister may wish to explain the rationale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Chuang\r\n\r\nShaw  Peng  have  asked for group relief for  companies.   I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  that we are not in favour of the idea of allowing  group\r\n\r\nrelief for companies as it will have grave implications for  our\r\n\r\ntax  revenue.   Under group relief, profitable companies  within\r\n\r\nthe  group  will not have to pay tax on their profits  if  these\r\n\r\ncould  be offset by the losses of other companies in the  group.\r\n\r\nThis means that group relief will open up opportunities for  tax\r\n\r\nplanning and abuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience of other tax administrations which allow\r\n\r\ngroup relief has been that complex tax rules have to be drawn up\r\n\r\nto   prevent   abuse,  thus  creating  complications   for   tax\r\n\r\nadministration.  This has been the experience of countries  like\r\n\r\nthe US, UK and Australia who allow group relief.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our tax regime in Singapore is such that losses incurred by\r\n\r\na  company  can  be carried forward indefinitely  to  be  offset\r\n\r\nagainst  future  profits  earned and we  believe  that  this  is\r\n\r\nsufficient.  The majority of countries in the region do  not  in\r\n\r\nfact  allow  group  relief, for example,  Hong  Kong  does  not,\r\n\r\nneither  does  Malaysia,  nor Japan,  or  Canada.  Outside  this\r\n\r\nregion, Italy and Belgium do not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Ahmad Magad and Mr Chuang Shaw Peng\r\n\r\nhave asked whether we could provide relief or tax deduction  for\r\n\r\nlosses  suffered by companies arising from the regional currency\r\n\r\nturmoil.   Mr  Chuang has further suggested that the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  extend  tax deduction given to banks for  their  foreign\r\n\r\nexchange  losses to companies as well.  I should point out  that\r\n\r\nforeign exchange losses incurred by companies could be either on\r\n\r\nthe  capital account or on the revenue account.  For items under\r\n\r\ncapital account, such as loans or equity investments in overseas\r\n\r\noperations,  we  do  not allow tax deduction  for  such  losses,\r\n\r\nwhether realised or unrealised, as we do not tax capital  gains.\r\n\r\nIn  the  case  of items on the revenue account,  such  as  trade\r\n\r\nreceivable from foreign customers, tax deduction is allowed  for\r\n\r\nrealised  foreign exchange losses.  Paper losses or  translation\r\n\r\nlosses, whether due\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  exchange  rate  differences or for other  reasons,  are  not\r\n\r\nallowed  for tax deduction as they are not realised  losses  and\r\n\r\nmay be reversed at any time prior to disposal of the assets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chuang has also suggested that the administrative\r\n\r\nconcession for banks in respect of their foreign exchange losses\r\n\r\nbe  extended to companies in general.  Under this administrative\r\n\r\nconcession,  banks  are  allowed tax  deduction  for  unrealised\r\n\r\nforeign   exchange  losses  on  their  trading   account.    The\r\n\r\nconcession  was granted  mainly to facilitate tax compliance  by\r\n\r\nthe banks in view of the nature of their operations and the mark\r\n\r\nto  market  basis commonly used by them to recognise profits  or\r\n\r\nlosses  in  their books.  Under this administrative  concession,\r\n\r\nunrealised  losses  may be allowed but unrealised  profits  will\r\n\r\nalso  be  subject to tax.  The operations of other companies  do\r\n\r\nnot require a similar administrative concession.  Companies also\r\n\r\nmay not want to have their unrealised profits subject to tax  as\r\n\r\nin the case of the administrative concession for banks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has asked for corporate tax rebate of 10%\r\n\r\nto  15%  over  the  next two years to assist companies  who  are\r\n\r\nfacing problems in this difficult period.  I would like to point\r\n\r\nout   that  Singapore's  tax  regime  currently  is  still  very\r\n\r\ncompetitive and I believe, based on what I said yesterday,  that\r\n\r\na tax rebate of this size is not really necessary at this stage.\r\n\r\nOur  corporate income tax was recently reduced from 27%  to  26%\r\n\r\nand  took effect from Year of Assessment 1997.  We also  have  a\r\n\r\nwide  variety of tax incentives targeted at selected  industries\r\n\r\nand  activities  which  we want to promote.   This  means  that,\r\n\r\neffectively, our tax rate is lower than the corporate  tax  rate\r\n\r\nof  26%.   We also have a comprehensive network of tax treaties,\r\n\r\nnumbering 36 at the moment, which helps to reduce the tax burden\r\n\r\nof  companies in Singapore.  Nevertheless, I recognise that  the\r\n\r\neconomic  outlook  is uncertain and if developments require,  we\r\n\r\nwill be prepared to take further action to help companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has also asked that companies be allowed\r\n\r\nto  pay their tax by instalment over the next two years to  help\r\n\r\nease cash flow.  Currently, companies are already allowed to pay\r\n\r\ntheir income tax by instalments if they arrange for the payments\r\n\r\nto  be made through GIRO.  The instalment plan is interest-free.\r\n\r\nIf necessary, IRAS is prepared to, on a case-by-case basis, look\r\n\r\ninto  further  adjustments  to  this  instalment  plan  to  help\r\n\r\ncompanies  which face particular cash flow problems in arranging\r\n\r\ntheir tax schedules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has also suggested that we change the GST\r\n\r\nthreshold  for  companies which register from $1 million  to  $2\r\n\r\nmillion  and to delay collection of GST by one quarter  to  help\r\n\r\ncompanies  in  their cash flow problems.  We  believe  that  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  GST  annual  turnover limit of $1  million  is  already\r\n\r\nsufficiently  high to exclude most, if not, all small  business.\r\n\r\nWith  this high turnover threshold, almost all small businesses,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  provision  shops, market and coffeeshop  stallholders,\r\n\r\nhawkers, HDB shopkeepers are already exempt from GST.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
