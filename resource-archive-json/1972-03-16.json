It is natural  that,\r\n\r\nwith  increasing  economic prosperity,  there  should\r\n\r\nfollow a rising level of our expectations which  have\r\n\r\nmanifested themselves in, for instance, the desire to\r\n\r\nown  the house or flat in which we live, and also the\r\n\r\ndesire   for   more   and   better   facilities   for\r\n\r\nrecreational and cultural pursuits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of the National Wages Council, in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Government,  the  National  Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress, and the employers are equally represented,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the purpose of formulating guidelines on  wages,\r\n\r\nindicates an awareness of the need for workers to  be\r\n\r\ngiven  an  equitable  stake  in  the  fruits  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic  development and progress of  Singapore.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same time it is vitally important for the future\r\n\r\nof  the  Republic that wage increases should  not  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to get out of hand or it would result  in  a\r\n\r\nvicious spiral of inflation which can only damage the\r\n\r\ninterest of the Republic. The National Wages Council,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  has assumed a role of utmost significance\r\n\r\nnot  only to the workers but also to the rest of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore, in that it serves as a regulator\r\n\r\nfor  the economic health of the Republic. In relation\r\n\r\nto the economy of Singapore itself and in relation to\r\n\r\nthe  competition among the developing nations of  the\r\n\r\nworld   for  foreign  capital  and  investment,   the\r\n\r\ndifference  between  a rational and  a  chaotic  wage\r\n\r\npolicy  can  spell the difference between  prosperity\r\n\r\nand disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the recent statement on the wage policy of\r\n\r\nthe  Government and other indications point to an era\r\n\r\nof greater affluence for the workers of the Republic,\r\n\r\nthe fear that wage increases for the workers would be\r\n\r\nmore  than swallowed up by price increases  is  still\r\n\r\nvalid. Legislation for price controls may seem to  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  in  order  to  eliminate  profiteering  by\r\n\r\ntraders, but there are other practical considerations\r\n\r\nwhich  are  likely to stultify such legislation.  For\r\n\r\nthis  reason,  the N.T.U.C, has decided  to  initiate\r\n\r\nmeasures,  which  are  compatible  with  the  limited\r\n\r\nresources  at  its disposal, to protect  the  workers\r\n\r\nagainst  the  ravages of profiteering by unscrupulous\r\n\r\ntraders.  One  such measure is the  establishment  of\r\n\r\nCASE (Consumers' Association of Singapore) to promote\r\n\r\na   greater   consciousness  among   the   individual\r\n\r\nconsumers   in  Singapore  against  exploitation   by\r\n\r\ntraders   in   respect  of  prices,   qualities   and\r\n\r\nquantities of goods and services offered for sale  to\r\n\r\nthe public. Another measure is the proposal to set up\r\n\r\na Consumers' Co-operative which, by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noffering   goods   and  services  to   consumers   at\r\n\r\nreasonable   prices,  will  place  the   unscrupulous\r\n\r\ntraders who charge extortionate prices at great risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nstated  that steps are being taken to streamline  the\r\n\r\nImmigration procedures to ensure that persons who can\r\n\r\npositively contribute to the economy of Singapore are\r\n\r\npermitted  entry into the Republic. It  also  appears\r\n\r\nthat the Government is encouraging employers, both in\r\n\r\nthe  public and private sectors, to establish schemes\r\n\r\nfor  the  training of workers within the industry  as\r\n\r\npart  of  a  scheme to develop and  to  use  our  own\r\n\r\nmanpower resources to its maximum so as to reduce our\r\n\r\ndependence on foreign labour. On the face of it,  the\r\n\r\npolicies  of the Government in this area seem  to  be\r\n\r\ncorrect. I must, however, draw the attention  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to the difference between the formulation\r\n\r\nof  a policy and its actual implementation. While the\r\n\r\ngrounds for formulating a policy have been given  the\r\n\r\nmost careful consideration, the manner in which it is\r\n\r\nimplemented is, however, not given the same amount of\r\n\r\ndetailed consideration, and is consequently likely to\r\n\r\nbe fraught with abuses, some flagrant, some petty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the applicants are technicians and possess\r\n\r\ntechnical  or  scientific  qualifications,  no  great\r\n\r\ndifficulty  is  entailed in  the  evaluation  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic  significance of their  talents.  But  where\r\n\r\nthey  possess skills which are based on aesthetic  or\r\n\r\npopular  taste,  or fashion, for which  there  is  no\r\n\r\nobjective criterion, it frequently appears  that  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of the Government on the control of entry  of\r\n\r\nforeign labour into the Republic is open to abuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is the employment of foreign\r\n\r\nmusicians.  With  the help of the  Tourist  Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard,  some  hoteliers and impresarios, have,  under\r\n\r\nthe  pretext  of  promoting  tourism,  succeeded   in\r\n\r\nobtaining  entry  permits for foreign  musicians  who\r\n\r\nare,  in  fact,  no better than our local  musicians.\r\n\r\nMany  such foreign musicians, who have not been  able\r\n\r\nto  make a name in their own countries or have yet to\r\n\r\ngain inter-national\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnational experience and reputation, are  willing  to\r\n\r\ntake on jobs at very low wages. It is hard to believe\r\n\r\nthat  tourists who come to Singapore from  the  three\r\n\r\nmain tourist countries, the United States, Japan  and\r\n\r\nAustralia,  where their own artistes are  of  a  much\r\n\r\nhigher   standard,  are  likely  to  return   to   be\r\n\r\nentertained with such inferior musical talent.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult, there is resentment and frustration among the\r\n\r\nlocal musicians for being unable to earn a living  in\r\n\r\nthis  trade  or to obtain an opportunity  to  improve\r\n\r\ntheir  skills  for  employment in  the  international\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, when it became apparently necessary for\r\n\r\nan   advertising   firm  to  effect  a   retrenchment\r\n\r\nexercise, a local executive, not a foreign executive,\r\n\r\nwas  given the walking certificate, regardless of the\r\n\r\nfact   that  the  local  executive  was  much  better\r\n\r\nqualified. In such a situation, it would be extremely\r\n\r\ndifficult for the Immigration Department to  form  an\r\n\r\nopinion  as  to whether the advertising  firm  should\r\n\r\nhave  dispensed  with  the services  of  the  foreign\r\n\r\nexecutive  rather  than  the  local  executive.   The\r\n\r\ntalents  of  a good advertising executive  cannot  be\r\n\r\nreadily measured by any objective criteria. My  point\r\n\r\nis  that  if an employer wishes to employ  a  foreign\r\n\r\nexecutive  in  preference to a  local  executive,  it\r\n\r\nwould not be difficult for him to advance one pretext\r\n\r\nor  another to convince the Immigration Department of\r\n\r\nthe   need  for  an  entry  permit  for  the  foreign\r\n\r\nexecutive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the abuses resulting from the present mode of\r\n\r\nimplementation of Government's immigration policy  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  foreign personnel, if left  unremedied,\r\n\r\nwould surely bring about a demoralising effect on the\r\n\r\nlocal  personnel  who are qualified to  replace  such\r\n\r\nforeign personnel. It is not only in the interests of\r\n\r\nour  local technicians or executives but also in  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the  Republic  as  a  whole  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's immigration policy should be implemented\r\n\r\nin a constructive manner so as to give a fair balance\r\n\r\nbetween the need for foreign expertise and skill  and\r\n\r\nthe need to give our local citizens every opportunity\r\n\r\nto acquire such expertise and skill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my hope that the Government will be able to\r\n\r\ntake   the   necessary  steps   to   streamline   our\r\n\r\nimmigration procedures so as to eradicate the  abuses\r\n\r\nin respect of the employment of foreign personnel. In\r\n\r\nmy  view, it will be a step in the right direction if\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is  able to set up  a  \"consultative\r\n\r\nmachinery\"  whereby the Immigration Department  could\r\n\r\nform a reasonably correct judgment as to whether  the\r\n\r\nskill of any foreigner is of any use to the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the\r\n\r\npresent Budget is not only the third painless  Budget\r\n\r\nin  the last three years but it also provides six tax\r\n\r\nreliefs,  especially in a situation of  international\r\n\r\nmonetary  instability  and the  final  phase  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish   military   withdrawal.   This   undoubtedly\r\n\r\nreflects our strong economic position and it provides\r\n\r\na  boost for the attraction of investment, both  from\r\n\r\nSingapore and abroad. Obviously, the emphasis of  the\r\n\r\nBudget  is  to meet the problems and the consequences\r\n\r\nof  industrialisation and commercial  development  in\r\n\r\nthe  coming  years. As the Minister for  Finance  has\r\n\r\nsaid, our aim is to transform Singapore which has  an\r\n\r\neconomic  growth rate of 15 per cent into a  regional\r\n\r\ncentre   for   brain  services  and   brain   service\r\n\r\nindustries within 10 years. This aim is very  fitting\r\n\r\nto  a  country like ours. We should make full use  of\r\n\r\nthe good qualities of our people and try our best  to\r\n\r\ndevelop   industries  which  do  not   occupy   large\r\n\r\nstretches  of  land,  so  that  we  may  achieve  and\r\n\r\nmaintain  an annual economic growth rate  of  15  per\r\n\r\ncent.   This   will  also  help  to  complement   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our neighbouring countries which  have\r\n\r\nlarge expanses of territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Minister, earnings from tourism\r\n\r\ncontinued to grow and showed an increase of 17.2  per\r\n\r\ncent  in  1971 as compared with that for the previous\r\n\r\nyear, 1970. However, the Minister also said that  the\r\n\r\nhotel occupancy rate has fallen from 73.5 per cent in\r\n\r\n1969  to  70.7 per cent in 1970 and down to 65.4  per\r\n\r\ncent in 1971. This\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshows  that  the hotel occupancy rate is  going  down\r\n\r\nwhile  the number of tourists coming to Singapore  is\r\n\r\nincreasing.  The Tourist Promotion Board should  work\r\n\r\nout   a   solution,  otherwise  its  expenditure   on\r\n\r\npublicity  and  promotional efforts to  attract  more\r\n\r\ntourists will not be justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the six tax relief measures, that for\r\n\r\naccelerated   depreciation   for   industrial   anti-pollution  devices  is  the most  meaningful  to  the\r\n\r\nhealth  of  our  people. The other reliefs  will  not\r\n\r\nbenefit  our people as much as this one. Our  people,\r\n\r\nbe  they property owners or otherwise, have the right\r\n\r\nto   enjoy  a  clean  and  healthy  environment.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  expecting a loss of $3.5  million  in\r\n\r\nrevenue by implementing these tax reliefs. This shows\r\n\r\nthat the interest of the masses is not forgotten.  If\r\n\r\nthe  factory owners delay the installation  of  anti-pollution  devices  in  their  factories,  then   the\r\n\r\nDepartment  concerned will have  the  right  to  take\r\n\r\nenforcement measures against them forthwith.  As  the\r\n\r\nMinister has said, these six tax reliefs are meant to\r\n\r\nassist Government's economic and social policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has all along been trying to promote\r\n\r\nand to preserve the good cultural characteristics and\r\n\r\nheritage of our people and also to uphold the  family\r\n\r\nlink  and  good  tradition  of  piety  towards  one's\r\n\r\nelders.  All this is worth preserving. We can achieve\r\n\r\nthis if we encourage our people to do it through  our\r\n\r\ntaxation policies and measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will consider providing tax\r\n\r\nreliefs for taxpayers who maintain their parents.  At\r\n\r\nthe  moment  there is tax relief for  the  taxpayer's\r\n\r\nwife and children. Since we are going to increase the\r\n\r\nremission  of income tax from $100 to $300 per  annum\r\n\r\nfor  expenditure  on maintenance of gardens,  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  at  the  proper time the Government  will  also\r\n\r\nallow  taxpayers a certain relief for the maintenance\r\n\r\nof their parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The painless Budget for the third year presented\r\n\r\nduring  a situation of international monetary  crisis\r\n\r\nis most\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  to  all.

H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,   I  rise  to  offer   my   heartiest\r\n\r\ncongratulations to the Minister for Finance  for  his\r\n\r\nvery lucid presentation of the Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of greater consequence than the Budget details for\r\n\r\nnext  year is the ambitious development plan for this\r\n\r\ndecade   revealed  by  the  Minister.  The   policies\r\n\r\noutlined  are far-reaching in scope and are  designed\r\n\r\nto implement vast economic and social changes in this\r\n\r\ndecade.  The economic changes targeted are tremendous\r\n\r\nfor,  at  the  rate of 15 per cent a year  growth  in\r\n\r\nGross  National  Product, our G.N.P, will  double  in\r\n\r\nfive years and quadruple within a decade!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate question that comes to mind is\r\n\r\nwhether  the  rate  of  15 per cent  is  feasible.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  it is attainable because the technology  gap\r\n\r\nis  still  large  and we can bring in  the  necessary\r\n\r\nexpertise and manpower. Moreover, the strategy is  to\r\n\r\nproduce  for  world  markets and  to  increase  local\r\n\r\nskills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has outlined five basic areas of\r\n\r\npolicy,  namely,  manpower, science  and  technology,\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, taxation and promotion. I would  like\r\n\r\nto  draw attention to four policy areas, two of which\r\n\r\nare not covered by the Minister's speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Wage Policy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first concerns wage policy. The key terms of\r\n\r\nreference of the National Wages Council is to  assist\r\n\r\nin  the  development of a wage structure,  consistent\r\n\r\nwith long-term economic and social development. There\r\n\r\nare four aspects here that need attention:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Major wage changes will occur if demand greatly\r\n\r\nexceeds  supply  of labour. To prevent  this,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to co-ordinate manpower supply and  demand\r\n\r\nand to recommend appropriate\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimmigration  and  increased supply of  local  skills.\r\n\r\nThis   is,  by  far,  the  most  critical   task   in\r\n\r\nformulating wage policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Increases in wage rates in the leading sectors\r\n\r\naffect  adversely  the  supply  of  labour  to  other\r\n\r\nsectors.  Wage  adjustments  in  these  sectors   are\r\n\r\nnecessary  and  can lead to closure of  firms  unless\r\n\r\nincreases   in  productivity  are  made  via   better\r\n\r\norganisation,  modernisation  or  incentive  schemes.\r\n\r\nHere  is  where the National Productivity Centre  can\r\n\r\nplay a decisive role.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) From time to time, wage adjustments are also\r\n\r\nrequired  in the public sector to prevent a drain  of\r\n\r\nmanpower  and expertise. Here, the Wages Council  can\r\n\r\nhelp via regular surveys of wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In a rapidly growing economy, the income gap\r\n\r\nbetween  the haves and the have-nots tends to  widen,\r\n\r\nunless  a  conscious effort is made  to  prevent  it.\r\n\r\nHere,  the  Government  can set  a  good  example  by\r\n\r\nallowing  a higher percentage increase in  wages  for\r\n\r\nlow-wage  earners  and  a  lower  one  for  high-wage\r\n\r\nearners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rentals and Land Policy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from wage policy, attention must be paid to\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of a coherent land and property  policy.\r\n\r\nAppreciation in property values leads to higher rents\r\n\r\nwhich  are  passed  on  to consumers  through  higher\r\n\r\nretail  prices. More crucially, production costs  are\r\n\r\nincreased,  affecting  our  competitive  position  in\r\n\r\nworld  markets. Long leases on industrial  land  give\r\n\r\nwindfall  gains  for  some.  Quite  clearly,  in  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of equity and efficiency, a coherent  land\r\n\r\nand property policy needs to be defined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Pricing of Public Goods and Services</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further point I wish to discuss is the pricing of\r\n\r\npublic   goods   and   services,  especially   public\r\n\r\nutilities.  These  are  public monopolies  and  their\r\n\r\npricing  policy affects producers and  consumers.  At\r\n\r\npresent,  each statutory board sets its  own  pricing\r\n\r\npolicy,  whether to cover costs only  or  to  make  a\r\n\r\nprofit. I believe an overall advisory body to develop\r\n\r\na  consistent  pricing policy for  public  goods  and\r\n\r\nservices is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Capital Market</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech the Minister referred to the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  developing  a  capital  market.   The\r\n\r\nabolition of stamp duties on credit instruments is  a\r\n\r\nright  step.  I believe some thought should  also  be\r\n\r\ngiven   to  the  development  of  a  secondary  stock\r\n\r\nexchange  to  deal with securities which are  riskier\r\n\r\nand  do  not meet present Stock Exchange regulations.\r\n\r\nThe  development  of  a capital market  is  important\r\n\r\nbecause modern corporations require more capital than\r\n\r\nthe traditional family enterprises can provide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Social Adjustments</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area which the Minister could not cover in his\r\n\r\nlong   Budget  speech  is  the  problem   of   social\r\n\r\nadjustments to rapid economic development. On  recent\r\n\r\noccasions  I  have talked about the tensions  arising\r\n\r\nfrom  urban  renewal, a growing income  gap  and  the\r\n\r\ndemonstration  effects of spending  by  the  rich  on\r\n\r\nluxury  goods. Immigration of workers will give  rise\r\n\r\nto  social frictions, since non-citizens do not enjoy\r\n\r\nthe  same housing, health and educational privileges.\r\n\r\nRecently, Government announced the provision of  some\r\n\r\nhousing   for  immigrant  workers.  Nevertheless,   I\r\n\r\nforesee  pressures  developing  for  the  easing   of\r\n\r\npermanent residence and citizenship qualifications as\r\n\r\nyoung  immigrant workers get married to Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nI am fully confident that the Government will be able\r\n\r\nto  deal  with these social problems. There  is  much\r\n\r\nmore  room  for  adjustment in an  economy  which  is\r\n\r\nexpanding!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome Government's move to narrow the wage-gap\r\n\r\nbetween the public and private sectors and to  narrow\r\n\r\nthe  income-gap.  In particular,  the  increased  tax\r\n\r\nrelief  for  low income taxpayers and remission  from\r\n\r\nestate duty on small estates deserve our full support\r\n\r\nbecause they are steps towards a more just and  equal\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 12 years the Government has worked\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore's long-term viability.  It  has  never\r\n\r\nmade  empty election promises and has never hesitated\r\n\r\nto   take  strong  and  painful  measures  to  secure\r\n\r\nSingapore's future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere  is  great  concern for equity  as  the  Budget\r\n\r\nshows,  but  not  at the expense of  our  future.  If\r\n\r\nSingapore is to achieve the bold targets laid down in\r\n\r\nthe Budget in the next ten years, we have to ensure a\r\n\r\ncontinuing political stability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Government's\r\n\r\npolicy as presented in the Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  on  the  7th  of this month  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  announced  his Budget  proposals,  in  which\r\n\r\nthere  are  no  tax increases or new taxes.  Instead,\r\n\r\nthere  are  increased tax reliefs which  benefit  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  the  middle and the lower income  groups.\r\n\r\nThis is a far-sighted and satisfactory budget. It  is\r\n\r\nmost welcome and has the support of all the people in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tremendous progress and stability and peace in\r\n\r\nSingapore  can  be attributed to the enlightened  and\r\n\r\nable leadership of our Prime Minister and his Cabinet\r\n\r\ncolleagues, together with the co-operation  and  hard\r\n\r\nwork  of  our  people. Over the  past  decade,  these\r\n\r\npeople  have taken great steps and concerted  efforts\r\n\r\nto  ensure  the success of our industrialisation  and\r\n\r\ncontinuing prosperity of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us take a look at the\r\n\r\ncountries  around  us, far and near.  Their  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment is not as good as we would imagine. Every\r\n\r\nyear  they have to increase taxes in varying degrees.\r\n\r\nBut the people of Singapore on the contrary have been\r\n\r\nfortunate  to  enjoy painless budgets over  the  past\r\n\r\nthree  years.  These are clear indications  that  our\r\n\r\neconomy is very sound, evidenced by a surplus in  our\r\n\r\nbudget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is already modernised. However, our\r\n\r\npeople  should  not be complacent  with  the  present\r\n\r\nprosperity  and  success. They  must  take  concerted\r\n\r\nefforts  to  continue the hard work  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  continuing economic growth for  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  that there is always a great deal of surplus  in\r\n\r\nour Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us now look at the advanced\r\n\r\ncountries,  such  as  the  United  States  and  Great\r\n\r\nBritain. At one time they had peace at home, and they\r\n\r\nenjoyed the greatest riches of the world. But because\r\n\r\nof  the social indiscipline, lack of organisation and\r\n\r\nhard  work  on the part of their people  in  general,\r\n\r\ntheir  economy  is on the decline, resulting  in  the\r\n\r\ndevaluation  of  the  U.S, dollar  and   the   Pound\r\n\r\nsterling. Therefore, what happened to them can  serve\r\n\r\nas  an object lesson to us. We must continue with our\r\n\r\nhard  work and frugality. This is of great importance\r\n\r\nto a small country like Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the advancement of science and technology and\r\n\r\nindustrialisation in Singapore, other  problems  come\r\n\r\ninto  evidence. There are tendencies among our people\r\n\r\nto  take  life easy and to enjoy the good  things  of\r\n\r\nlife.  They  tend  to be more concerned  with  making\r\n\r\nmoney  than  with  getting themselves  interested  in\r\n\r\nmatters  of national importance. They even resort  to\r\n\r\ndegenerating and corrosive habits. As a result, there\r\n\r\nis  a  mounting wave of crime and some form of social\r\n\r\nunrest and disorder in Singapore. For example, we can\r\n\r\nsee  that  there  is  an increase in  secret  society\r\n\r\nactivities,  and  that  crimes like  rape,  gambling,\r\n\r\nmurder, kidnapping, blackmail, traffic offences,  and\r\n\r\ntax evasion, are being committed in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is also subject to the degenerating\r\n\r\ninfluence of the West. Some of our young people  take\r\n\r\nto  \"with-it-ism\". They turn to drugs and  keep  long\r\n\r\nhair,  thereby creating very serious social problems.\r\n\r\nThese   are  the  by-products  of  prosperity.   This\r\n\r\ndegenerating   influence  has   come   from   Western\r\n\r\ncountries  which, although industrially advanced,  do\r\n\r\nnot care much about the welfare and problems of their\r\n\r\nyouths.   Instead  of  finding  solutions  to   these\r\n\r\nproblems,  they resort to permissiveness.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  must  be very careful about our youths. Half  our\r\n\r\npopulation consists of young people under the age  of\r\n\r\n21 years. We must take immediate steps to ensure that\r\n\r\nour  social  discipline does not  suffer  or  is  not\r\n\r\naffected by such influences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Government must continue in its economic\r\n\r\nand  social  construction, it must at the  same  time\r\n\r\nensure  that such corrosive influence from  the  West\r\n\r\ndoes  not  become too much of a problem in Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  are  a  small country without natural  resources.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have some cultural ballast inherited from\r\n\r\nthe  past, we must make sure that this poisonous  and\r\n\r\ncorrosive  influence  from  the  West  shall  not  be\r\n\r\nallowed to gain a hold in Singapore, particularly  to\r\n\r\naffect  the youths. We must not allow our  youths  to\r\n\r\ndegenerate as did the youths in the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that in this direction the\r\n\r\nGovernment has set up the Central Narcotics Bureau to\r\n\r\ntake  effective and immediate action to combat  drug-taking.  At  the  same time the Government  has  also\r\n\r\ndeclared  \"war\" against long hair. But  in  spite  of\r\n\r\nthis  action, we can still see people with long  hair\r\n\r\nmoving  around  in  Singapore.  They  are  still  \"at\r\n\r\nlarge\". They claim to be \"progressive\", and are \"with\r\n\r\nit\". They even ignore the advice of the Government. I\r\n\r\nwould  therefore  suggest that  the  Government  take\r\n\r\nlegislative action against the keeping of long  hair.\r\n\r\nWe  should not be afraid of criticisms against us for\r\n\r\nbeing  undemocratic and for interfering with personal\r\n\r\nliberty. I am sure that the people of Singapore  will\r\n\r\nunderstand  and  will be on our  side.  In  order  to\r\n\r\nensure  that there is a fine and proper social ethos,\r\n\r\nthe   Government  should  also  take  steps  in   the\r\n\r\nfollowing direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, yellow culture should be banned. To ensure\r\n\r\nthat  our  young people and our work  force  are  not\r\n\r\ncorroded  by  this Western influence, the  Government\r\n\r\nmust  take immediate steps to ban yellow publications\r\n\r\nand  stop  their  circulation in Singapore.  Instead,\r\n\r\nencouragement should be given to good and  beneficial\r\n\r\npublications and film shows. The educational level of\r\n\r\nthe people should be raised, and made fully aware  of\r\n\r\nthe   evils  of  yellow  culture.  Healthy   cultural\r\n\r\nactivities shou1d be encouraged and conducted in  the\r\n\r\nvarious  sections of the society. In  this  way,  the\r\n\r\npeople  will  have beneficial and healthy recreations\r\n\r\nto counter the corrosive Western influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, low-taste films should be banned in\r\n\r\nSingapore. At present, there are far too many  sword-fighting movies This is bad for our young people.  We\r\n\r\nmust  further  tighten  the film  censorship  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of our country. Films or movies which have a\r\n\r\nbad effect on our citizens should be banned. Instead,\r\n\r\nencouragement  should be given to  the  screening  of\r\n\r\nbeneficial  films in the cinemas. In this  way,  more\r\n\r\neducational films will be shown, and the people  will\r\n\r\nlearn through them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would urge the Government to take\r\n\r\nstringent   measures  against  the  importation   and\r\n\r\ncirculation  of undesirable gramophone  records  from\r\n\r\noverseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the social ethos should be reformed. To\r\n\r\ndo  this,  it is necessary to begin at home.  Parents\r\n\r\nmust  set good examples to their children, and should\r\n\r\nnot  concern  themselves merely  with  making  money.\r\n\r\nOtherwise they would neglect the education  of  their\r\n\r\nchildren,  which is equally important. Children  will\r\n\r\nbe  well-educated only if they receive education both\r\n\r\nat home and in school Then they will be patriotic and\r\n\r\nable  to  resist  the  corrosive Western  influence..\r\n\r\nTherefore, I urge that, our economy permitting, there\r\n\r\nshould  be  a  whole-day session at secondary  school\r\n\r\nlevel, so that students will be able to spend more of\r\n\r\ntheir time usefully in schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in short, the rise or fall of a\r\n\r\ncountry  depends on the social ethos  prevailing.  No\r\n\r\ndoubt,  we  must  do all we can to  ensure  that  our\r\n\r\nnational economy is properly maintained. Moreover, we\r\n\r\nshould  remove  all  undesirable  influences  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety.  The people should be urged to work together\r\n\r\nand  to work hard for the national interest. In  this\r\n\r\nway, a bright future for Singapore is then assured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on behalf of the people of Thomson, I\r\n\r\nsupport this Budget policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  four hon. Members who spoke before me have aptly\r\n\r\ncommended the Minister for Finance for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis  Budget Statement. I think this is the first time\r\n\r\nthat any Finance Minister in any country has not only\r\n\r\npresented a Budget without new taxation measures  but\r\n\r\nhas also given away revenue amounting to $3.5 million\r\n\r\napproximately.  I  may be wrong.  The  historians  in\r\n\r\nParliament can clarify this. Any benefits to anybody,\r\n\r\nalthough  the benefits given by the Finance  Minister\r\n\r\nwould  not  be for the lower income group, should  be\r\n\r\napplauded. In fact, at the end of his speech, Members\r\n\r\nof the House did applaud in complete disregard of the\r\n\r\nStanding Orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are grateful to the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nwho acknowledged the efforts of the workers for their\r\n\r\ncontributions  for a very successful year.  With  the\r\n\r\nrapid  withdrawal of the British military  forces  in\r\r\n\r\n1971,  never in the wildest dreams did the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore expect a 14 per cent increase in our  Gross\r\n\r\nNational  Product. However, this has  been  achieved,\r\n\r\nand  the credit goes to the Government as well as  to\r\n\r\nour   workers   for  their  hard  work,   dedication,\r\n\r\nrestraint  and co-operation. When I say \"workers\",  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  confine  it only to workers in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  and  lower ranks of the public  service,  but\r\n\r\nalso  include  our  top  civil  servants  and  senior\r\n\r\nstatutory board employees. People who work with their\r\n\r\nbrain  are  as much a worker as those who  work  with\r\n\r\ntheir brawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion our economic progress in the past few\r\n\r\nyears   has  also  been  the  result  of  the  unique\r\n\r\npolitical situation obtainable in Singapore  today  -\r\n\r\nwithout any official parliamentary opposition  as  we\r\n\r\nhave  in this Chamber today. Sir, being a responsible\r\n\r\nGovernment, we have been able to plan and execute our\r\n\r\npolicies  with the object of obtaining what  is  good\r\n\r\nfor  our people. Our actions have been geared to what\r\n\r\nwe  can  do  best  for the people  to  improve  their\r\n\r\nmaterial,  cultural, educational and aesthetic  well-being,   without  always  worrying  about  what   the\r\n\r\nOpposition Members of Parliament would say. In  other\r\n\r\nwords, as Back-benchers, we do not have the slightest\r\n\r\ndesire to make\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  noise in Parliament just for the sake of it, so as\r\n\r\nto  be able to subserve the purpose of getting votes.\r\n\r\nThe   time  of  the  Ministers,  Minister  of  State,\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretaries, Members of Parliament  and\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  has not been wasted in  unnecessary,\r\n\r\nirrelevant, or hair-splitting arguments in  order  to\r\n\r\nscore   points  and  win  votes  for  the  Opposition\r\n\r\npolitical   party,  but  rather  spent  usefully   in\r\n\r\nplanning for a better life for our citizens.  If  the\r\n\r\ncomposition of this House were different, if  we  had\r\n\r\nrepresentatives   from  any  of   the   irresponsible\r\n\r\npolitical  parties  that have  mushroomed  in  recent\r\n\r\nmonths,  we would have squandered a lot of time  with\r\n\r\narguments   designed  to  catch  the   ear   of   the\r\n\r\nelectorate, rather than to safeguard the interest  or\r\n\r\nwelfare of Singaporeans. Members on this side of  the\r\n\r\nHouse   have  criticised  the  Government  and   will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to do so not to score points, but  to  make\r\n\r\nconstructive  and  objective  criticisms.  Very   few\r\n\r\npeople in Singapore realise that our achievements  in\r\n\r\nthe  past few years, with odds against us, have  been\r\n\r\nthe  result  of all 58 Members of this  House  coming\r\n\r\nfrom  the  same Party, and that Parliament  has  been\r\n\r\nable to initiate necessary action with the minimum of\r\n\r\nfuss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one newspaper has described our Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance, after his Budget speech, by saying  that  he\r\n\r\nhas scored \"first a hat-trick and then a Six\". May  I\r\n\r\nextend  the analogy of the cricket language by adding\r\n\r\nthat  he  has also played his way into the  pages  of\r\n\r\n\"Wisdens\".  In  fact,  I have been  waiting  to  hear\r\n\r\ncriticisms  from Opposition parties on the  Financial\r\n\r\nStatement. Not a squeak has been heard, which goes to\r\n\r\nprove   that   our  Budget  has  not  been   a   mean\r\n\r\nachievement. Any Opposition party would be  hard  put\r\n\r\nto  improve  it. Sir, the increase in  earned  income\r\n\r\nrelief  will  benefit  about  33,000  taxpayers.  The\r\n\r\nincrease  in the exemption from $6,000 to $12,000  in\r\n\r\nthe net annual value of owner-occupied residences for\r\n\r\nincome   tax   purposes  will  benefit  house-owners,\r\n\r\nincluding those who live in palatial homes. Remission\r\n\r\nfrom  Estate  Duty  on  estates between  $10,000  and\r\n\r\n$25,000  will benefit house and land-owning citizens,\r\n\r\nincluding Housing and Development\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard flat owners. Good luck to them. Except for\r\n\r\nthe  $1,000  income tax exemption, I have  looked  in\r\n\r\nvain  in  our financial policy for benefits  for  our\r\n\r\nlower  income  group of workers, i.e, the  one-  room\r\n\r\nHousing   Board   flat  dwellers,   the   unfortunate\r\n\r\nunemployable persons. Every citizen has a right to  a\r\n\r\nshare of whatever prosperity the Republic enjoys. The\r\n\r\nannual allowance of one month's salary for workers in\r\n\r\nthe public sector is a welcome gesture. They now look\r\n\r\nforward  to  the Wages Council's recommendations.  We\r\n\r\nhope this will provide some additional benefit in the\r\n\r\nform of an increase in wages for wage-earners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I am pointing out is that the lower income\r\n\r\ngroup  will not benefit from the exemptions that  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister has outlined. We have to find  ways\r\n\r\nand  means of raising the standard of living of  this\r\n\r\ngroup. One aspect of this is the anomaly found in the\r\n\r\nPublic   Utilities   Board   charges   for   use   of\r\n\r\nelectricity. Sir, the rich and the well-to-do live in\r\n\r\ncomfortable air-conditioned rooms and pay at the rate\r\n\r\nof  7 cents per unit for electricity consumed. On the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  the  poor, who cannot  afford  an  air-conditioner, have to be contented with a ceiling  fan\r\n\r\nwhich  only circulates the hot air in the  room,  and\r\n\r\nthey  have  to pay 18 cents per unit. I should  think\r\n\r\nthat  the charge should be the other way round.  This\r\n\r\nis  one  way of giving indirect relief to  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  group.  I  am sure our able Finance  Minister\r\n\r\nwill  find means of distributing our fortune a little\r\n\r\nmore  in  favour of the lower income  group  than  it\r\n\r\nappears in his Budget speech for this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.44 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, on behalf of the people  of  the  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar  constituency, may I express my admiration  for\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  proposals  for the  new  financial  year\r\n\r\nannounced by the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if we look at past history and at\r\n\r\nconditions  prevailing in the surrounding  countries,\r\n\r\nwe  will  find  that  if the financial  policy  of  a\r\n\r\ncountry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  to  allow  a small number of people  to  enjoy  a\r\n\r\nbetter life and to force the majority of - the people\r\n\r\nto  go  through  a more difficult and  hard  life  or\r\n\r\nsuffer  greater hardships, then the economy  of  that\r\n\r\ncountry  will go from bad to worse. It might even  go\r\n\r\nto a point beyond redemption. We all know that in any\r\n\r\nsociety  the middle and lower income groups form  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of the people. If they have a better  life,\r\n\r\nthen  they will form the base of a motivational force\r\n\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this Budget for the new\r\n\r\nfinancial year, there is provision made for an  extra\r\n\r\none  month's  salary  as annual allowance  for  civil\r\n\r\nservants  and  also  for  those  working  in   quasi-Government bodies as announced by the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nearlier.  The Government also intends to  review  the\r\n\r\nsalary scales of the public service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Budget also there are no new taxes. On the\r\n\r\ncontrary,  there  are  six  tax  reliefs.  There  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, no additional burden on the workers in the\r\n\r\nmiddle and lower income groups. This a wise and  far-sighted  move  on the part of our Government.  It  is\r\n\r\nalso  in line with our Government's policy to  strive\r\n\r\nfor  a  more equitable distribution of wealth amongst\r\n\r\nthe  people. It has been the Government's policy  all\r\n\r\nalong  that the income gap between the rich  and  the\r\n\r\npoor  should be narrowed. The standard of  living  of\r\n\r\nthe  people should be raised. There should be greater\r\n\r\nequality among the various classes of people  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety. Therefore, in this respect, this Budget is a\r\n\r\nmost  outstanding one and we welcome it.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nonly a \"painless\" one but is also far-sighted. It  is\r\n\r\na  positive  contribution to the development  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry. If we analyse carefully the economy  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry, we can see that the economic development  of\r\n\r\nSingapore is well advanced. However, there are  still\r\n\r\nmany  difficult  problems  which  will  require   our\r\n\r\nrenewed efforts to overcome them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this Budget, there is a\r\n\r\nprovision   of  $209,700,000  for  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation. This represents an increase of $18 million\r\n\r\nover that for 1971. However, if we consider our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducation  policy as a whole, we will  see  that  the\r\n\r\nincreased  provision for this Ministry is mainly  for\r\n\r\nthe expansion of technical education in order to meet\r\n\r\nthe  increased  demand for skilled  workers  for  our\r\n\r\nindustries. Under the present circumstances, in order\r\n\r\nto  cope with the industrialisation programme of  our\r\n\r\ncountry,  there  is a pressing need  to  train  large\r\n\r\nnumbers of workers to acquire the necessary technical\r\n\r\nskills within a short space of time. This is indeed a\r\n\r\nstep in the right direction. It is, therefore, beyond\r\n\r\nreproach. However, from the long-term point of  view,\r\n\r\nif we over-emphasise technical education to the point\r\n\r\nwhere  we  overlook or omit education in  the  social\r\n\r\nsciences  and  the  other arts, then,  I  think  this\r\n\r\npolicy cannot be a perfect one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me quote an example. Today\r\n\r\nSingapore is going through a period of prosperity. It\r\n\r\nhas been brought about through the able leadership of\r\n\r\nour political leaders, from the Prime Minister to the\r\n\r\nMinisters,  Ministers  of  State,  and  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretaries. All of them are not specialists  in  the\r\n\r\ntechnical  field.  Therefore, I  think  that  in  our\r\n\r\nefforts to train more and more people in the field of\r\n\r\ntechnical  education, we should  not  overlook  their\r\n\r\ntraining  in the field of social sciences  and  other\r\n\r\narts.  We should not neglect this field of education,\r\n\r\notherwise  we will one day be faced with a  situation\r\n\r\nwhere  we do not have the people well trained in  the\r\n\r\nsocial sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L.

The  former requisite may be  achieved  by\r\n\r\nproper  planning,  stimulation  and  organisation  of\r\n\r\nhuman  resources.  The latter, however,  is  a  human\r\n\r\nattribute  determined  by genetic  endowment,  values\r\n\r\nacquired  in  the  family  during  growth   and   the\r\n\r\npersuasions of the social and cultural environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, a new generation in our society, born after\r\n\r\nthe  last  World War, is bursting into adulthood  and\r\n\r\nconstitutes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntutes the new manpower of the nation. While expecting\r\n\r\nthe  different social and intellectual responses  and\r\n\r\nlife-styles  of a new generation, our survival  as  a\r\n\r\nnation   demands  that  our  human  resources  remain\r\n\r\nindustrious, disciplined and relentlessly striving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not enough to ensure the continuation of this\r\n\r\nhuman  resource  with the promise of  personal  gain.\r\n\r\nPersonal  gain is a strong motivation, but by  itself\r\n\r\nit  is  socially disintegrative. And as we move  into\r\n\r\nthe  era of the multi-national corporation and as our\r\n\r\ncity  shapes into a global city with global exposure,\r\n\r\nthe  problems  of  social  integration  and  national\r\n\r\ncohesion become correspondingly more acute.  In  this\r\n\r\nsituation, social discipline becomes a critical need.\r\n\r\nBut  at  the same time discipline provokes resistance\r\n\r\nbecause,  on  the  one  hand,  youth  today  is  more\r\n\r\nenlightened  and independent and, on the other  hand,\r\n\r\nit  is more intensely exposed to the liberal norms of\r\n\r\nbehaviour  of  other  societies.  Indeed,  Sir,   the\r\n\r\nproblems  of  a new and youthful generation  are  now\r\n\r\nonly just emerging and will require our attention and\r\n\r\nenergies  in the immediate future despite - in  fact,\r\n\r\nit  is because of - the high growth rate which all of\r\n\r\nus hope will be achieved in the years ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have pleasure in supporting the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, on behalf of the people of  Sembawang,\r\n\r\nmay I express my support for this Budget for the next\r\n\r\nfinancial  year which was presented by  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  on  the 7th of this month.  His  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement contained very good news. For example,  not\r\n\r\nonly  will there be no new taxes, but there will also\r\n\r\nbe  no  increases in the rates of existing taxes.  On\r\n\r\nthe  contrary, six items of tax reliefs are  granted;\r\n\r\nthus  the  benefits to the people are  increased.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, these measures are for the welfare  of\r\n\r\nour  people.  The  good start that  we  have  at  the\r\n\r\nbeginning  of  this year is, I am sure, conducive  to\r\n\r\neconomic  expansion. It will be  a  stimulus  to  our\r\n\r\nplans for further industrialisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has made a detailed\r\n\r\nstatement  on  the international monetary  situation,\r\n\r\nand  touched  on, for example, the upward revaluation\r\n\r\nof  the  German Mark, the devaluation of the American\r\n\r\nDollar,  and  the 10 per cent surcharge on  all  U.S.\r\n\r\nimports  levied by the American Government  in  1971.\r\n\r\nThe  effects  of these measures on the  rest  of  the\r\n\r\nworld, more particularly South-east Asia, are severe.\r\n\r\nThey  have  led to a recession in trade.  However,  a\r\n\r\ncomforting thought is that, despite the international\r\n\r\ntrade   recession,  we  have  been  able  to  survive\r\n\r\neconomically,  and above that we have  been  able  to\r\n\r\nachieve a growth rate of 14 per cent. This is a  rare\r\n\r\nachievement. It goes to show that the economy of  our\r\n\r\ncountry  is  strong,  and  that  in  spite  of  these\r\n\r\ndifficulties and recurrent problems we have been able\r\n\r\nto achieve this high growth rate. We are thus able to\r\n\r\nenjoy the prosperity of our stringent economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has also mentioned\r\n\r\nthat  our  per  capita  Gross  National  Product  has\r\n\r\nincreased from $2,960 in 1970 to $3,317 in 1971. As a\r\n\r\nresult,  the purchasing power of our people has  also\r\n\r\nincreased.  This  is  an  important  factor  in   our\r\n\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the success of our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  programme  is  dependent  on  good\r\n\r\nleadership   and  planning  on  the   part   of   our\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The  departments  concerned  have   been\r\n\r\nplaying a leading role in this respect. However,  our\r\n\r\nworkers  have  also  put in their  efforts.  The  co-operation  between employers and employees  has  also\r\n\r\ncontributed  to  our success. Many of  our  factories\r\n\r\nhave  increased their production. Industrial disputes\r\n\r\nhave been reduced to the minimum. In fact, the number\r\n\r\nof strikes has been minimal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of all this, our Gross Domestic Product has\r\n\r\nincreased  substantially  and  the  standing  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry  is very high in the international scene.  We\r\n\r\nhave attracted more and more investors from overseas.\r\n\r\nThis,  in  turn,  will  lead to  a  higher  level  of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  and economic  expansion.  We  know\r\n\r\nthat  this  success  is the result  of  the  combined\r\n\r\neffort  of  all  our  people.  We  must  ensure   the\r\n\r\nqualities of perseverance and industry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntry  of  our  people are maintained, so that  in  the\r\n\r\ncoming years we can achieve yet greater objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch on the need for public\r\n\r\nhealth. As everybody knows, the medical care  in  our\r\n\r\ncountry has enjoyed a very good reputation. Following\r\n\r\nthe  rapid  economic  expansion of  our  country  and\r\n\r\npopulation  growth,  the Ministry  of  Health  has  a\r\n\r\ngreater  and  more important role  to  play.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  we  have three big hospitals. We have  taken\r\n\r\nover  the Sembawang and Alexandra Hospitals from  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Armed  Forces.  These  two  hospitals   will\r\n\r\ncontribute greatly to the well-being of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have achieved a great deal, there are\r\n\r\ncertain  areas  for improvement. On the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth,  I  would  like to put  forward  two  points.\r\n\r\nFirst,  I  hope  that the Minister  for  Health  will\r\n\r\nconsider providing in the hospitals beds for  parents\r\n\r\nwhose children are hospitalised so that they can look\r\n\r\nafter  their children. Secondly, I hope the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill  consider increasing the number of  surgeons  in\r\n\r\nour hospitals so that cases which require surgery can\r\n\r\nbe dealt with speedily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our policy is to build more hawker centres for\r\n\r\nthe benefit of the hawkers, so that their standard of\r\n\r\nliving will be gradually improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch on the question of rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  We  know that our Government  has  been\r\n\r\nworking hard to provide facilities for the people  in\r\n\r\nthe   rural   areas.  A  good  example  is  Sembawang\r\n\r\nconstituency.  Through the efforts of the  Urban  and\r\n\r\nRural Services Committee, the Government has provided\r\n\r\nmore  than  a million dollars for the Sembawang  area\r\n\r\nfor   various   public   services,   such   as   road\r\n\r\nconstruction, drainage, rural electrification (Street\r\n\r\nlighting and domestic electricity) and water  supply.\r\n\r\nAll  these  projects have improved the appearance  of\r\n\r\nSembawang constituency. Of course, the Government has\r\n\r\nbeen  working  not  only to benefit  constituents  in\r\n\r\nSembawang   but  also  those  in  the   other   rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies. The Government has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaken these measures to improve the lot of the people\r\n\r\nin  the  rural  areas.  It  goes  to  show  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  believes  in the  fundamental  tenets  of\r\n\r\ndemocratic socialism. It is also trying to reduce the\r\n\r\ngap  in the standard of living between the people  in\r\n\r\nthe  city and the people in the rural areas, so  that\r\n\r\neveryone can enjoy the fruits of our economic growth.\r\n\r\nFor  the next financial year, the provision for urban\r\n\r\nand  rural services is $3.25 million, as compared  to\r\n\r\n52.5  million for last year. There is an increase  of\r\n\r\nabout  $700,000. This is, in fact, good news for  the\r\n\r\npeople   in   the  rural  areas.  I  am  sure   rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment from now on will continue to improve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very happy to note that the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  has  emphasised in his Budget Statement  the\r\n\r\nneed  for defence and national security. There  is  a\r\n\r\nneed for administrative skills in matters of national\r\n\r\ndefence,  and the training of personnel  in  all  the\r\n\r\nvarious  fields can play an important part in raising\r\n\r\nthe  educational  level of our  Armed  Forces.  These\r\n\r\nmeasures are important for the strengthening  of  our\r\n\r\narmed forces. In addition, I think that there is also\r\n\r\na  need  to  inculcate  a  sense  of  patriotism  and\r\n\r\nnational  consciousness in our  youths,  so  that  in\r\n\r\ntimes  of  crisis  they  will  be  prepared  to  make\r\n\r\nsacrifices for the country and for their homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all in all, the Budget for the next financial\r\n\r\nyear  certainly meets the approval of all the  people\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. Let me express my full support for the\r\n\r\nMinister and for his words of praise for the  workers\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. Because of the spirit of dedication of\r\n\r\nour  workers,  our country has survived  the  various\r\n\r\ninternational crises, and our economy is  stable  and\r\n\r\nprosperous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to call upon all the people\r\n\r\nin  our country, irrespective of colour or class,  to\r\n\r\ncome  together and, in a united effort, take part  in\r\n\r\nnation-building  and  to  strive  for   yet   greater\r\n\r\nachievements in the next financial year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Finance Minister's Budget\r\n\r\nproposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  in spite of the difficulties  arising\r\n\r\nout  of  an international economic recession and  the\r\n\r\nBritish  military withdrawal, resulting in a loss  of\r\n\r\n$400 million in British military expenditure, we  are\r\n\r\npresented  with  yet  another  painless  Budget.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance informed  us  that  our  Gross\r\n\r\nNational  Product  has reached $7,000.8  million,  an\r\n\r\nincrease of 14 per cent over the previous year.  This\r\n\r\nis a clear indication of the correct economic policy,\r\n\r\nour  political and social stability and the diligence\r\n\r\nand   verve   of   the  people  of   Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nannouncement by the Prime Minister on the payment  of\r\n\r\nan   annual  allowance  of  one  month's  salary   to\r\n\r\nGovernment  servants  and  the  promise   of   salary\r\n\r\nadjustments  in the next financial year is  really  a\r\n\r\npiece of good news to the civil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been a tremendous inflow of foreign\r\n\r\ncapital  into  Singapore, coupled with  a  growth  in\r\n\r\nconstruction,   industrialisation  and  urbanisation,\r\n\r\nthus   resulting  in  a  rise  in   the   prices   of\r\n\r\ncommodities.  The  cost  of  living  is,   therefore,\r\n\r\nrising,  and this gives the situation in which  wages\r\n\r\nand the cost of living are racing against each other,\r\n\r\nsomewhat  like  a race between the tortoise  and  the\r\n\r\nhare.  Therefore,  the  wage-earners  are  always  in\r\n\r\ndifficulty in the face of a rising cost of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our productivity is progressing, our economy\r\n\r\nis  developing steadily, and our national  income  is\r\n\r\nincreasing every year. As the Prime Minister and  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour have recently said, the fruits of\r\n\r\nprosperity  and  economic  growth  should  be  shared\r\n\r\nequitably  amongst all the people and should  not  be\r\n\r\nmonopolised by a minority at the expense of the  hard\r\n\r\nwork  done by the workers. The adjustments  of  wages\r\n\r\nand  the rationalisation of conditions of work should\r\n\r\nbe  carried out now. We must raise their income,  for\r\n\r\nin  this  way the working class will have a sense  of\r\n\r\nsecurity,  and  will feel proud that  they  are  also\r\n\r\ncontributing to the economic growth and prosperity of\r\n\r\nSingapore by their efforts. This will give\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  further  impetus  to  face  the  challenge   to\r\n\r\nincrease  their  productivity.  They  will  also   be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  meet  new changes and  to  continue  to\r\n\r\ncontribute to nation-building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having achieved political, economic and social\r\n\r\nstability, we should now have a look at our  society.\r\n\r\nA  new or reasonable society does not mean that it is\r\n\r\nfaultless  or without failings. There are aspects  of\r\n\r\nsome of our people inclined to the darker side of our\r\n\r\nsociety.  We  must  bring them round  to  the  proper\r\n\r\ntrack,  so that they can correct themselves. We  must\r\n\r\nhave  the  courage  and the confidence  to  plan  for\r\n\r\nfurther progress towards greater equality of all  the\r\n\r\npeople.  We must think of ways and means to help  the\r\n\r\npoor  and aged people with big families, particularly\r\n\r\nthe  daily-rated  employees.  Because  of  their  low\r\n\r\nwages,  they have to take up part-time employment  or\r\n\r\neven  part-time peddling as unlicensed hawkers. Under\r\n\r\nthe  heavy  burden and great pressure, they  have  to\r\n\r\nwork  day-in and day-out and most of them are  plying\r\n\r\ntheir  goods along the roadside to earn their  living\r\n\r\nagainst  the law. Therefore, we must try  and  devise\r\n\r\nsome ways to assist these poor people. Perhaps we can\r\n\r\ngrant  them  temporary licences or even give  them  a\r\n\r\nrent   subsidy   to   help  them  tide   over   their\r\n\r\ndifficulties  arising out of low  wages  until  their\r\n\r\nsons or daughters are able to work to supplement  the\r\n\r\nincome of their family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we should also build more cr\ufffdches in\r\n\r\nindustrial  or Housing and Development Board  estates\r\n\r\nin  order  to allow the wives of people of middle  or\r\n\r\nlower  age group from this section to enter into  the\r\n\r\nlabour  market,  so that the total  income  of  their\r\n\r\nfamily  will  increase and be able to meet  the  high\r\n\r\ncost  of living. In this way, our work force will  be\r\n\r\nincreased to meet the needs of our industrialisation.\r\n\r\nWe  may  make use of the community centres as cr\ufffdches\r\n\r\nby  improving and providing more facilities  for  the\r\n\r\nchildren.  The  cr\ufffdches  will  also  bring   together\r\n\r\nchildren  of various walks of life and ensure  social\r\n\r\nintegration at a very tender age. The children put in\r\n\r\nthese  cr\ufffdches  will benefit much from the  education\r\n\r\nprovided\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere. And with better education for the  poor\r\n\r\nchildren,  the  vicious  cycle  of  the  poor  people\r\n\r\nremaining  poor forever from generation to generation\r\n\r\ncan be broken down, and we shall be able to bring  up\r\n\r\na better generation for our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as in other industrial countries, Singapore is\r\n\r\nalso confronted with the shortage of labour. This  is\r\n\r\ninevitable.  According to the statistics provided  by\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Labour, we have already issued 60,000\r\n\r\nwork  permits.  This  serious  labour  shortage   has\r\n\r\nbrought  about an immigration of foreign labour  from\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries and even from  countries  far\r\n\r\naway. With this influx of foreign labour, we run  the\r\n\r\nrisk of having city slums and social problems. Unless\r\n\r\nwe  are  prepared  to build low-cost  houses  and  to\r\n\r\nprovide  education  for their children,  our  present\r\n\r\nstandard of living and our economic objectives may be\r\n\r\nendangered by the influx of foreign labour. We should\r\n\r\nbe  aware  of our own situation in dealing with  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must set up a plan for our long-term\r\n\r\neconomic   development  in   the   context   of   our\r\n\r\ngeographical  position,  population  potential,  land\r\n\r\narea   and   other  relevant  factors.  Our  national\r\n\r\ndevelopment  must  be determined  by  these  factors.\r\n\r\nAlthough  we have achieved full employment,  we  must\r\n\r\ntry to prevent our workers from being over-selective,\r\n\r\nleading to great mobility in labour, wastage,  and  a\r\n\r\nreduction  of  our  national  productivity,   thereby\r\n\r\nslowing down our economic expansion. Through the  co-operative efforts of employers and employees and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the  workers must  be  told  that  their\r\n\r\ninterests  and  the  interests  of  the  nation   are\r\n\r\ninterdependent.  In  fact, their  interests  and  the\r\n\r\nproductivity of the country in relation to a  greater\r\n\r\nmarket  are closely interlinked, because demands  for\r\n\r\nproducts are dependent upon the purchasing power  and\r\n\r\nit  will  increase with the benefit of larger profits\r\n\r\nwhich   come  from  higher  productivity  and  bigger\r\n\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now touch on the question of urban\r\n\r\nrenewal  and  the  problems  brought  about  by   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of numerous high-rise  flats.  We  know\r\n\r\nthat  land is a scarce commodity in our country,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  there is a great need to build higher  and\r\n\r\nstill  higher blocks of buildings. This is, in  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  only  option  open  to us.  However,  we  should\r\n\r\ncarefully investigate the problems brought  about  by\r\n\r\nthese  high-rise flats and the high concentration  of\r\n\r\npopulation in small areas. We cannot allow factories,\r\n\r\nschools, shopping centres, supermarkets, and  private\r\n\r\nfirms to decide freely what their working or business\r\n\r\nhours should be, because this will create the problem\r\n\r\nof  traffic  congestion. Because of the  shortage  of\r\n\r\nland   and   the   exorbitant   costs   involved   in\r\n\r\nimplementing  the Mass Rapid Transit System,  whether\r\n\r\nit  be monorails or underground trains, we cannot  at\r\n\r\nthe  moment  carry  out  these  projects.  We  should\r\n\r\ninvestigate to see whether there is a need to stagger\r\n\r\ntheir  working hours, so that the problem of  traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion  will  not arise. Perhaps  some  of  these\r\n\r\nshops and firms should be diverted or resited in less\r\n\r\ncongested areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the urban renewal programme, many so-called\r\n\r\nhigh-class shopping centres have sprung up  recently.\r\n\r\nThey have been given a great deal of publicity. It is\r\n\r\nthe  hope  of the people that these shopping  centres\r\n\r\nwill provide some sort of service to our society but,\r\n\r\nin  point of fact, they are an \"abnormal development\"\r\n\r\nof  our society, because their prices are very  high.\r\n\r\nThese  high-class shopping centres  are  supposed  to\r\n\r\ncater  specially for the rich and the  tourists,  but\r\n\r\nthere  are only a few tourists. The majority  of  the\r\n\r\nconsumers  are, in fact, local people, and  they  are\r\n\r\nattracted   by   the   expensive   decorations    and\r\n\r\nadvertising  gimmicks put up by local businessmen  of\r\n\r\nthese  shops. Many of these shops have been attracted\r\n\r\nto  site  in  shopping centres, but, in  fact,  their\r\n\r\nbusiness is not all that good, because of the lack of\r\n\r\nsupport  from the local clientele. What  little  they\r\n\r\nearn goes to pay for the high rentals. It is only the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbig   developers   who  stand  to   gain   from   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of these so-called high-class  shopping\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Government should take a more\r\n\r\nconcerted  effort  to  establish  the  needs  for   a\r\n\r\nsatellite  town  before we carry out such  plans.  We\r\n\r\nneed to have more up to-date statistics to study  the\r\n\r\npopulation  trend,  the urgent needs  of  the  people\r\n\r\nwhich  follow  the  progress of  society.  We  should\r\n\r\nconsider   building   modern  multi-storey   shopping\r\n\r\ncomplexes  so  as  to  provide  better  services  and\r\n\r\namenities in our housing estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the construction by the Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board and the Jurong Town Corporation  of\r\n\r\nshopping  complexes which are let out  at  reasonable\r\n\r\nrentals,   the  shops  should  be  able  to   provide\r\n\r\ncommodities at reasonable prices, so that the  people\r\n\r\nin  these  satellite towns may be  able  to  purchase\r\n\r\ngoods  at  a fairly reasonable price. These  measures\r\n\r\nwill also help to divert the crowd and to reduce  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of traffic congestion in the city areas.  We\r\n\r\nhave  to construct shopping complexes to provide  the\r\n\r\npeople  in the satellite towns with various amenities\r\n\r\nand  services, so that their cost of living  will  be\r\n\r\nreduced.  We  should not consider providing  services\r\n\r\nwithout  caring  for  the  purchasing  power  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Sir,  we  know that we are a  small  country\r\n\r\nwithout  any  natural resources, but so far  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen able to achieve great economic expansion in  the\r\n\r\nface  of international uncertainties and disruptions.\r\n\r\nThe  payment  of  an annual allowance  to  Government\r\n\r\nservants  is  a rare step in this direction.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat with greater efforts we shall be able to achieve\r\n\r\neven greater things in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a representative of the people of Kampong Kapor,\r\n\r\nI   support  the  Finance  Minister  in  his   Budget\r\n\r\nproposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Ramaswamy (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nfinancial policy of the Government enunciated by  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister gives a picture of quiet confidence\r\n\r\nand  visions of Singapore marching forward  into  the\r\n\r\nfuture full of promise. The fact is that, in spite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the effects of the British military withdrawal and\r\n\r\nthe  international monetary crisis, which for a  time\r\n\r\nthreatened  to  slow down our economic progress,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  ridden  the crest  and  attained  an\r\n\r\nadvance  in 1971 of about 12.1 per cent for  the  per\r\n\r\ncapita  G.N.P, at current market prices.  This  is  a\r\n\r\ncreditable achievement for which the Government  must\r\n\r\nbe congratulated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of points, however, arise-when considering\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  speech as a whole. A matter that  should\r\n\r\ncause-concern is the increasing use of direct, trade\r\n\r\npolicies   by  our  neighbours.  It  is,  I  suggest,\r\n\r\ntherefore, necessary for us to-formulate a policy  to\r\n\r\ngradually minimise our dependence on traditional  re-export commodities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tourism is another economic earner and, despite the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the number of tourists and in  earnings\r\n\r\n(about  ten  times  higher than 1960),  there  is  a.\r\n\r\ndecline in the occupancy rate of hotels since 1969. A\r\n\r\nquestion  that naturally poses itself is whether  our\r\n\r\nTourist Promotion Board has done enough in the  past.\r\n\r\nThough  greater efforts must be-made to attract  more\r\n\r\ntourists from Japan, Australia, and the rich European\r\n\r\ncountries like the U.S.A., I think it will be prudent\r\n\r\nto  step  up efforts and projects to attract tourists\r\n\r\nfrom  the  less affluent countries also, so that  the\r\n\r\ntourist industry could reap additional earnings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The announcement that measures are being taken to\r\n\r\nreorganise the civil service and to restructure their\r\n\r\nsalary  scales is most welcome. The annual  grant  of\r\n\r\none month's pay as a non-, pensionable allowance will\r\n\r\ngo  a long way towards narrowing the differences, in\r\n\r\nwages   between  the  public  and  private   sectors.\r\n\r\nHowever,  these  measures  in, themselves  are   not\r\n\r\nsufficient  to curb the flow of experienced  officers\r\n\r\ninto  the  private sector. I suggest that  Government\r\n\r\nService  could  be made more attractive  by  offering\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  more  liberal terms  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nhousing,  car loans, and so on. To prevent a  further\r\n\r\nflow  of  officers into the private  sector  existing\r\n\r\nmeasures should be tightened. Such measures would  be\r\n\r\njustifiable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause,  by  and large, those who leave for  greener\r\n\r\npastures  use the knowledge, experience, and training\r\n\r\nthat they have gained in Government Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the private sector would\r\n\r\nvery  soon  also  see wage increases when  the  Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil makes its recommendations. The picture is one\r\n\r\nof  promise  and  joy to our working population.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  lurks  in the background is creeping  inflation\r\n\r\nand  spiralling  prices  in the  wake  of  a  general\r\n\r\nincrease  in  wages. If this is not controlled,  then\r\n\r\nwage increases will prove futile and barren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property Tax has of late been a subject of much\r\n\r\ndiscussion  by house owners. Following an upsurge  in\r\n\r\nrentals  in 1970 and 1971, annual values were raised.\r\n\r\nThe  position is somewhat different now,  as  rentals\r\n\r\nhave  dropped  significantly and  the  annual  values\r\n\r\nfixed  previously would now appear to have no bearing\r\n\r\non the present rentals. I would, therefore, urge that\r\n\r\na further review of annual values be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to increase Defence expenditure is\r\n\r\nrecognised  when we are continuing to  build  up  our\r\n\r\nArmed Forces. No good and true Singapore citizen will\r\n\r\nargue  about  this,  hut  one  can  legitimately  ask\r\n\r\nwhether a sudden increase of 16.5 per cent over  last\r\n\r\nyear's expenditure is really necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A matter that has of late been receiving the close\r\n\r\nattention  of Government, trade unions and  employers\r\n\r\nis industrial safety. The recent explosion in a barge\r\n\r\nin  Jurong, in which five people lost their lives and\r\n\r\nanother  five seriously injured, is a tragic reminder\r\n\r\nthat with new methods of work, new machinery and  new\r\n\r\nworking  environments  which come  with  progress  in\r\n\r\nindustrialisation,  new  dangers  lurk   behind   the\r\n\r\nunsuspecting worker. It is, therefore, vital that the\r\n\r\nproblems  of industrial safety should be  studied  in\r\n\r\ngreater depth, so that a comprehensive programme  can\r\n\r\nbe  devised to meet not only known dangers  but  also\r\n\r\npossible dangers of which little or nothing is  known\r\n\r\nnow. Apart from the sorrow and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuffering  that  industrial accidents  cause  to  the\r\n\r\ninjured  worker and his family, the loss of  workers,\r\n\r\nparticularly  skilled workers, in the  context  of  a\r\n\r\nfull-employment situation, is something that  we  can\r\n\r\nill-afford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to our road transport, the traffic\r\n\r\nsystem  is  now in a chaotic state. Though steps  are\r\n\r\nbeing  taken  to educate the public, to  control  the\r\n\r\ntraffic, and to widen roads, and so on, unless a mass\r\n\r\ntransport system is introduced in the next few  years\r\n\r\nthe problem will become unmanageable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If subways are to be introduced, this is the\r\n\r\nopportune  time  because while the  Central  area  is\r\n\r\nbeing  reconstructed  and  with  high-rise  buildings\r\n\r\ncoming  up,  subways can be constructed with  minimum\r\n\r\ndislocation to the traffic system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that a Commission be appointed to\r\n\r\nlook into the problem and to report on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  like my colleagues, I would like to express  my\r\n\r\nsupport and convey my congratulations to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance for announcing his third painless Budget\r\n\r\nin  this House. Sir, although we are not entirely out\r\n\r\nof  the woods yet, our economy has all the time  been\r\n\r\ngoing up instead of declining. This is largely due to\r\n\r\nthe  able leadership of the Government, combined with\r\n\r\nthe  strong will and determination of the  people  to\r\n\r\novercome obstacles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, despite increases in expenditure\r\n\r\nfor  Defence, Education, Social Services, and others,\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance has been able to balance his\r\n\r\nBudget  without having to increase existing taxes  or\r\n\r\nintroducing new taxes. On the contrary, he  has  been\r\n\r\nable   to   introduce  six  tax   reliefs.   I   must\r\n\r\ncongratulate the Minister for Finance on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must also echo the disappointment of the\r\n\r\nrural  people.  There  is no mention  in  the  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement  of any change in the policy on agriculture\r\n\r\nand  fisheries. I am not an economist, and so I  will\r\n\r\nnot be able to say\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhow much profit can be made out of agriculture and\r\n\r\nfisheries  as compared to industry, for  the  same\r\n\r\namount of land that is being used. However, I know\r\n\r\nthat   some   land   should   be   allocated   for\r\n\r\nagricultural  purposes.  I  am  sure  most  of  us\r\n\r\nremember  that  during the Japanese occupation  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, almost every family planted tapioca  or\r\n\r\npotatoes for their own consumption. But now  there\r\n\r\nis  no  land available in the city to grow even  a\r\n\r\nplot of potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of our farmers are engaged in the production\r\n\r\nof supplementary food. Due to lack of proper care,\r\n\r\nthey  are left entirely on their own for survival.\r\n\r\nAgricultural land is continually being diminished.\r\n\r\nIf,  for  any reason, there is further decline  in\r\n\r\nthe production of supplementary food, we will have\r\n\r\nto spend a great deal on foreign exchange in order\r\n\r\nto  import  food from other countries, and  should\r\n\r\nthis supply be cut off for any reason, we will all\r\n\r\nbe  starved  to  death.  I, therefore,  feel  that\r\n\r\ndefinite policies must be formulated for fisheries\r\n\r\nand  agriculture,  in  order  to  look  after  the\r\n\r\ninterests of our farmers in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are about 23,000 families\r\n\r\nengaged  in  agricultural or  fishing  activities.\r\n\r\nTogether   with  relatives  and  allied   workers,\r\n\r\nmerchants    and    hawkers,   I    think    about\r\n\r\n200,000-300,000    people   are    dependent    on\r\n\r\nagriculture  and  fisheries for their  livelihood.\r\n\r\nThis  constitutes more than one-tenth of our total\r\n\r\npopulation.  So their contribution to our  economy\r\n\r\ncannot be completely ignored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are signs that agriculture and\r\n\r\nfisheries are on the decline. We can see from  the\r\n\r\nannual   reports   of   the   Primary   Production\r\n\r\nDepartment that farming and fishing activities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore are declining at a tremendous speed.  We\r\n\r\nmust  do  something to stop or check the  decline.\r\n\r\nBecause  land is scarce in Singapore, we  have  to\r\n\r\nfind  ways  and  means to make  the  best  use  of\r\n\r\nwhatever     land    we    have     and,     after\r\n\r\nindustrialisation, allocate some land  to  farmers\r\n\r\nfor  agricultural pursuits. However, the  tendency\r\n\r\nis  towards urbanisation and industrialisation. As\r\n\r\na result,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is understood that agricultural land available\r\n\r\namounts  to  only  a small area of  33.000  acres.\r\n\r\nApart  from the small portion of private  land,  a\r\n\r\ngreater  part  of  it  is State  land,  leased  to\r\n\r\nfarmers   under  Temporary  Occupation   Licences.\r\n\r\nBecause they have to farm under T.O.Ls they always\r\n\r\nhave the sense of insecurity and are convinced  by\r\n\r\nthe  fact that they are often resettled from  time\r\n\r\nto time. After resettlement a few unfortunate ones\r\n\r\nhave  to  move again. As a result of resettlement,\r\n\r\nfarmers experience great inconvenience and losses.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  should therefore  take  steps  to\r\n\r\navoid resettling the farmers more than once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, farmers require land just as fish require\r\n\r\nwater.  Since land is leased to them under T.O.Ls,\r\n\r\nthey   are   always  liable  to  resettlement   or\r\n\r\neviction.  Psychologically, this has a bad  effect\r\n\r\non them. Because of this, they tend to take things\r\n\r\neasy, instead of trying to find permanent ways and\r\n\r\nmeans  to  increase their production.  This  is  a\r\n\r\ngreat blow to our agricultural activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although we are not in a\r\n\r\nposition   to  implement  \"Land  to  the  Tillers\"\r\n\r\nscheme, we should designate agricultural areas and\r\n\r\ngrant  longer leases of, say, 30 to 50  years,  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  will be able to till the  land  for  a\r\n\r\nfixed  period,  so  that they can  also  plan  for\r\n\r\nimprovement and expansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Minister for Finance may probably be\r\n\r\naware,   the   prices  of  primary  farm   produce\r\n\r\nespecially  of  pigs  and  eggs,  have  gone  down\r\n\r\nrecently.  In some cases, the prices have  dropped\r\n\r\nto  below  cost.  Some  farmers  are  experiencing\r\n\r\nconsiderable  hardships and are on  the  brink  of\r\n\r\nbankruptcy.  This  shows  the  weakness   of   our\r\n\r\nagricultural  economics. Farmers  are  engaged  in\r\n\r\nthese activities for a living and they only manage\r\n\r\nto make ends meet. But with the small returns they\r\n\r\nget,  they  cannot be sure of even three  meals  a\r\n\r\nday.  This is the case not only in times when  the\r\n\r\nharvest  is  poor, but also when  the  harvest  is\r\n\r\ngood.  This is the result of the rising  costs  of\r\n\r\nfertilisers  and  animal feeds.  Farmers  normally\r\n\r\nobtain  animal  feeds and fertilisers  on  credit.\r\n\r\nThey repay the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuppliers  for their fertilisers and  animal  feeds\r\n\r\nwhen they have a rich harvest. The suppliers act as\r\n\r\na sort of middlemen and moneylenders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in spite of the rising costs of\r\n\r\nfertilisers and animal feeds, the prices of primary\r\n\r\nfarm  produce are going down. We can see from  this\r\n\r\nthat  a bad relationship exists between the primary\r\n\r\nproducers  and the middlemen. I can  only  use  the\r\n\r\nword  \"exploitation\" to describe the  relationship,\r\n\r\nin  the absence of a better term. Sir, farmers  are\r\n\r\nnot  rich. They do not even have the money  to  buy\r\n\r\nthings  on cash terms. They have to purchase  their\r\n\r\nsupplies on credit. It is only when their livestock\r\n\r\nare  big enough for sale and sold will they be able\r\n\r\nto  raise  some  money to pay for the  supplies  of\r\n\r\nanimal feeds and fertilisers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another difficulty which the farmers face is that\r\n\r\nwhen  the harvest is plentiful, there is an  excess\r\n\r\nof  supply over demand. Again the poor farmers will\r\n\r\nbe  exploited by the middlemen and the suppliers of\r\n\r\ntheir  animal feeds and fertilisers. As  a  result,\r\n\r\nthe  prices  of their products dropped.  They  will\r\n\r\nthen  again  experience difficulty in repaying  the\r\n\r\ndebts  that they have incurred. This is an  unusual\r\n\r\nphenomenon  which  should be removed.  A  socialist\r\n\r\nGovernment   cannot   continue   to   ignore    the\r\n\r\nunreasonable acts of the middlemen who exploit  the\r\n\r\nprimary producers. Government must do something  to\r\n\r\nensure that everybody gets the fruit of his labour.\r\n\r\nAll along their interests have been looked after by\r\n\r\nthe Primary Production Department by providing them\r\n\r\nwith  technical  aids. If the Government  does  not\r\n\r\ngive  further help to the farmers in  the  form  of\r\n\r\nfinancial aid, planning, marketing and sales,  then\r\n\r\nwhatever  benefits they may get  from  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction   Department  will  be  cancelled   out,\r\n\r\nbecause  of the low prices of their produce.  There\r\n\r\nwill  then be no profit to the farmers despite  all\r\n\r\nthe technical aid provided to ensure good harvests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at this time last year\r\n\r\nI asked the Minister for Finance about\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  establishment of an agricultural  bank.  After\r\n\r\none  year's  deliberation, may I know what  is  the\r\n\r\ndecision  of  the Minister? Even  if  there  is  no\r\n\r\nintention to set up an agricultural bank,  I  think\r\n\r\nthe   Minister   should  consider  setting   up   a\r\n\r\ndepartment in the Development Bank of Singapore  to\r\n\r\ndeal with financial matters relating to farmers and\r\n\r\nto  provide low-interest loans. It is only  through\r\n\r\nthe granting of low-interest loans that farmers can\r\n\r\nrid   themselves   of  the  exploitation   by   the\r\n\r\nmiddlemen. This move will improve their well-being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the question of over-production is due\r\n\r\nto the farmers' lack of ability to analyse markets.\r\n\r\nThey  produce without any proper planning.  But  we\r\n\r\ncannot  blame them for this, because  they  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  either  the  knowledge,  the  data,  or   the\r\n\r\nmachinery  for  analysis of the market.  This  work\r\n\r\nshould,  in fact, be done by the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment,  so that the problem of over-production\r\n\r\ncan be solved. In addition to this, I think Intraco\r\n\r\nshould  also  assist farmers to  explore  and  open\r\n\r\nmarkets  overseas so that the agricultural  surplus\r\n\r\nproducts  can  be exported. I think the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  also encourage the setting up of industries\r\n\r\nand factories processing agricultural produce. This\r\n\r\nwill absorb the surplus farm produce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to eliminate the exploitation of\r\n\r\nfarmers by middlemen, it is necessary to set  up  a\r\n\r\nco-operative for farmers. The Government  has  been\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in  the implementation of co-operatives\r\n\r\nfor  transport  and insurance for the  workers.  So\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  reason  why  the  Government  cannot\r\n\r\nsucceed in the field of agriculture. It is  no  use\r\n\r\nfor  Government officials to sit in air-conditioned\r\n\r\nrooms,  expecting  farmers  to  come  forward   and\r\n\r\nregister  themselves  to form a  co-operative.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment should take a positive step to help the\r\n\r\nfarmers,  because they are usually  very  busy  and\r\n\r\nthey  lack  the necessary experience and knowledge.\r\n\r\nIf the Government does this, great benefits will be\r\n\r\nshared  not  only  by  the  farmers  but  also  the\r\n\r\nconsumers at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would now like to touch on\r\n\r\nfisheries. We know that Singapore is surrounded  by\r\n\r\nthe four seas. But our fishermen can only catch one-quarter  of  our  total consumption  of  fish.  The\r\n\r\nMinister for Law and National Development has  said\r\n\r\nthat  this  is a shame. According to a  survey  our\r\n\r\nconsumption  of fish is the highest  in  Asia.  The\r\n\r\nfigure  comes  to 35.6 kilos per person  per  year.\r\n\r\nFollowing  the  increase  in  our  population,  the\r\n\r\nconsumption  of  fish is bound to increase.  It  is\r\n\r\nestimated that by 1975, our consumption will  reach\r\n\r\nthe  figure of 82,000 tons. On the other  hand,  we\r\n\r\ncan  see  from  the annual reports of  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department that if  fishing  activities\r\n\r\nare  declining and if allowed to continue, we would\r\n\r\nhave  to import more and more fish. Then this  will\r\n\r\nnot only lead to a loss in foreign exchange but, if\r\n\r\nthere  is  any external factor, also to an increase\r\n\r\nin  the price of fish. The people who stand to lose\r\n\r\nwill  be our home consumers. Sir, we know that  the\r\n\r\nSouth  China  Sea  and  the Indian  Ocean  have  an\r\n\r\nabundant  supply  of fish, and  there  is  a  great\r\n\r\npotential  for deep-sea fishing. There are  fishing\r\n\r\ntrawlers from Taiwan and Japan catching the Tuna in\r\n\r\nthe  Indian Ocean, and they are exporting  them  to\r\n\r\nEurope.  Why cannot we do the same thing? In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe distance from Singapore to the Indian Ocean  is\r\n\r\nonly  half that from Taiwan or Japan. In  the  same\r\n\r\nway, there is no reason why we should not succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep-sea fishing has not been developed to any\r\n\r\nsignificant  extent  in the  last  few  years.  The\r\n\r\nsetting  up of a Fisheries Training School  is  not\r\n\r\nsufficient  by itself. Deep-sea fishing requires  a\r\n\r\nlarge  amount  of  capital and  it  involves  great\r\n\r\nrisks.   Without   the  active   participation   of\r\n\r\nGovernment, there is not much prospect of  deep-sea\r\n\r\nfishing  developing as an industry. The  Government\r\n\r\nhas  already withdrawn the pioneer industry  status\r\n\r\nfor  deep-sea  fishing.  However,  other  kinds  of\r\n\r\npreferential treatment should be given to encourage\r\n\r\nlocal  and overseas businessmen to develop deep-sea\r\n\r\nfishing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no conflict of interests\r\n\r\nbetween  deep-sea  fishing and  off-shore  fishing.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  Government should also  encourage\r\n\r\noff-shore  fishing. It is a fact  that  during  the\r\n\r\nlast  few  years the Government has  neglected  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of off-shore fishing. In fact,  it  has\r\n\r\nregarded off-shore fishing as an archaic or useless\r\n\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we must also look after the sea-beds from which large quantities of fresh fish are\r\n\r\nobtained. I am referring now to the small  trawlers\r\n\r\nwhich operate near the off-shore areas, and in  the\r\n\r\nprocess they affect the natural environment of  the\r\n\r\nsea. The presence of these small trawlers makes the\r\n\r\nsea  more choppy and, as a result, the fish and the\r\n\r\nprawns do not reproduce in large numbers. We should\r\n\r\nimpose  a total ban on the operation of these-small\r\n\r\ntrawlers in the off-shore areas. The Marine  police\r\n\r\nand  the  Primary Production Department should  co-operate in this respect. During the last year, only\r\n\r\neight trawlers were arrested and we-cannot help but\r\n\r\nhave  some  doubts on the efficiency of the  Marine\r\n\r\nPolice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall now touch on the question\r\n\r\nof   reclamation.  We-know  that  the   large-scale\r\n\r\nreclamation  of  land  has  led  to  land  and  sea\r\n\r\npollution. This has an adverse effect on the catch\r\n\r\nof  the  kelongs in various areas.  Of  course,  we\r\n\r\ncannot   criticise   the-Government's   reclamation\r\n\r\nschemes. However, we must consider the question  of\r\n\r\ngiving  assistance  to these kelongs  so  that  the\r\n\r\nfishermen can carry on with their livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that in the last few\r\n\r\nyears  there  were  many cases of  fishermen  being\r\n\r\nrobbed  by pirates. Some of them were also arrested\r\n\r\nby  foreign governments. Sometimes they  were  also\r\n\r\nkidnapped and were released only after the  payment\r\n\r\nof  a  few  thousand dollars. I am  sure  that  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  all  the  people  are  sympathetic\r\n\r\ntowards these fishermen for their hardship. I  hope\r\n\r\nthe Government will think of some adequate measures-to reduce, if not altogether eliminate,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  incidents. For example, our  Government  can\r\n\r\nenter  into  an  agreement with  our  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries  on  the question of fishing  rights  so\r\n\r\nthat  our  fishermen will be allowed  to  fish  in\r\n\r\ntheir  territorial waters without  fear  of  being\r\n\r\narrested,  tortured  or  prosecuted.  The   Marine\r\n\r\nPolice  should  also increase their vigilance  and\r\n\r\nprevent  plundering by sea pirates.  I  have  also\r\n\r\nbeen informed that some of these pirates have even\r\n\r\ncome  to  our  kelongs to rob  our  fishermen.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,  the  personal  safety  of   these\r\n\r\nfishermen must be protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance knows better than I do\r\n\r\nof   the   contributions  that   agriculture   and\r\n\r\nfisheries make to our economy. I only hope that he\r\n\r\nwill  spend some time considering in depth how  to\r\n\r\ndevelop our agriculture and fisheries and  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  in  his  next Budget speech he would  devote\r\n\r\nmore  time to agriculture and fisheries. I am sure\r\n\r\nthe  200,000  or 300,000 people of  Singapore  who\r\n\r\ndepend  on  agriculture and fishing will  be  very\r\n\r\ngrateful to him. I support the Budget presented by\r\n\r\nthe Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.51 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I wish to thank the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance for presenting his Budget and to say a few\r\n\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The happy Budget announced on the 7th of this\r\n\r\nmonth  in  this House by our Finance Minister  has\r\n\r\ncaught  nearly  all Singaporeans by surprise,  not\r\n\r\nonly because there are no new taxes but there  are\r\n\r\nsimply no taxes at all. There are instead six  tax\r\n\r\nreliefs  which will benefit most of the people  in\r\n\r\none  way or another. We can boast that we are  one\r\n\r\nof  the  very few countries in the world which  do\r\n\r\nnot  have to introduce new taxes but instead grant\r\n\r\ntax  reliefs for the current financial year.  This\r\n\r\nis  one  of  the happiest moments in our  nation's\r\n\r\nhistory.    Let    me    -offer    my    heartiest\r\n\r\ncongratulations to the Minister for Finance on his\r\n\r\nvery illuminating Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Singapore's performance has contradicted\r\n\r\nthe World Bank's predictions made a few years ago.\r\n\r\nExperts  from  the  World Bank  had  then  made  a\r\n\r\nforecast  that our country would face a  recession\r\n\r\nand  unemployment. However, the  reverse  has  now\r\n\r\nhappened.  We  have virtually full employment  and\r\n\r\nthe  talk  of recession has disappeared, with  the\r\n\r\nboom condition continuing throughout last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I note from the Budget Statement that\r\n\r\nour  port  is being used less for entrepot  trade.\r\n\r\nThat may be a cause for concern, but I am sure the\r\n\r\nPort  of  Singapore Authority would  by  now  have\r\n\r\nthought of alternative forms of raising income.  I\r\n\r\nalso  notice  that  there is  no  mention  of  the\r\n\r\ncontainerisation of our port or of its  facilities\r\n\r\nfor  which  a great sum of money has already  been\r\n\r\nspent.  How much of this expenditure is worthy  of\r\n\r\nproducing  an income for the port is a matter  for\r\n\r\nconjecture.  Do  we  have a sufficient  number  of\r\n\r\nships  coming  here to make use of  our  container\r\n\r\nfacilities?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our national shipping line, the Neptune Orient\r\n\r\nLines, has been rather shabbily treated by the Far\r\n\r\nEast  Freight  Conference. When are  we  going  to\r\n\r\nbreak  the  monopolistic and arbitrary control  of\r\n\r\nour shipping by this foreign-based F. E. F. C.? We\r\n\r\nare  an independent country and we should be  able\r\n\r\nto  trade  with  any  country  and  with  as  many\r\n\r\ncountries  as  possible. The F.E.F.C, should  not\r\n\r\ndictate  the  terms  of trade carried  on  by  our\r\n\r\nnational carriers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since China is giving us a helping hand to break\r\n\r\nthe  monopoly of the F.E.F.C., we should carry  on\r\n\r\nmore trade with her and with other countries which\r\n\r\nshow a concern for our economic survival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our urban renewal programmes over the past few\r\n\r\nyears  have been going on at too fast a pace,  and\r\n\r\nthis  has  resulted in a shortage of workmen,  and\r\n\r\nabove  all  the shortage of cement. It seems  that\r\n\r\nour  cement factories are not producing enough  to\r\n\r\nmeet  local requirements. There seems to be a good\r\n\r\nreason for opening\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanother   cement   factory  in  view   of   further\r\n\r\ndevelopment  that will take place in the  years  to\r\n\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister recently announced the proposed\r\n\r\npayment  of  a non-pensionable annual allowance  to\r\n\r\nall  civil  servants. This is a good  idea  and  is\r\n\r\nwelcomed  by  all. However, let me point  out  that\r\n\r\nthose  who deserve a further increase in wages  are\r\n\r\nreally those in the low income groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Wages Council make their recommendations\r\n\r\nfor  a  minimum wage for our workers, we only  hope\r\n\r\nthat  shopkeepers  and hawkers will  not  have  any\r\n\r\nexcuse  for  profiteering. In the  past,  upon  the\r\n\r\nslightest   excuse   the   capitalist   monopolists\r\n\r\nincreased their prices unnecessarily. It  is  hoped\r\n\r\nthat  in  this  connection, the  NTUC's  Consumers'\r\n\r\nAssociation of Singapore will prove to  be  a  more\r\n\r\neffective organisation than it is now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our per capita income has again been assessed as\r\n\r\nthe second highest in Asia. This is largely due  to\r\n\r\nthe  Finance  Minister's wise calculations  in  the\r\n\r\npast,  our  Government's  ceaseless  drive  towards\r\n\r\nindustrialisation and, above all, to the success of\r\n\r\nour family planning programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years we have seen an enormous\r\n\r\nincrease   in   the   number  of  quality   hotels.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, for this same reason  the  occupancy\r\n\r\nrate  is only 70 per cent and in some hotels it  is\r\n\r\neven  less than that. To help the rate go up, there\r\n\r\nshould be more intensive tourist promotion efforts,\r\n\r\nand  other  means should also be explored  so  that\r\n\r\nmany more tourists will be attracted to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these words, Sir, I thank the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance   for  his  Budget  and  express  my   deep\r\n\r\nappreciation and my congratulations to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I am sure most  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  in Singapore from workers to employers  are\r\n\r\nhappy  that  there are no new taxes. Not  only  are\r\n\r\nthere  no  new taxes, but the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nhas kindly introduced six tax reliefs in his Budget\r\n\r\nStatement,  which will give satisfaction  to  those\r\n\r\nwho benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our present rate of economic and industrial\r\n\r\ngrowth,  I  sincerely hope that eventually  workers\r\n\r\nwill  be exempted from paying income tax. I believe\r\n\r\nthat  income  tax  should  be  paid  by  employers,\r\n\r\ninvestors and industrialists only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt that the\r\n\r\nworkers  in  Singapore  have  done  their  part  in\r\n\r\nresponse  to  the Government's appeal for  national\r\n\r\nsurvival  and nation-building. Through their  toil,\r\n\r\nsweat  and  sacrifice, they have  helped  to  bring\r\n\r\neconomic   boom   and   industrial   progress   and\r\n\r\nprosperity  to the Republic of Singapore.  Although\r\n\r\nthey  stand  to  benefit in the present  successful\r\n\r\neconomic  growth  and  industrial  expansion,   the\r\n\r\nemployers,  investors  and  industrialists  benefit\r\n\r\nmany times more than workers. To the workers, wages\r\n\r\nand  bonus  are always limited, but profit  to  the\r\n\r\nemployers is unlimited. Whatever wage increases  or\r\n\r\nbonus  given to the workers will be taken  back  by\r\n\r\nthe  businessmen because the workers  have  to  pay\r\n\r\nhigh  prices for edible and non-edible commodities.\r\n\r\nYet the employers are unwilling to give the workers\r\n\r\nany  high  cost-of-living  allowance  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nfrequent  increase of prices of goods.  Businessmen\r\n\r\ncan  increase the prices of the goods anytime  they\r\n\r\nlike,  but  workers cannot ask for an  increase  in\r\n\r\nwages anytime they like. The workers must abide  by\r\n\r\nthe collective agreement. Where is the fairness?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do appreciate that frequent\r\n\r\nwage  increases  will never stop the  increase  in\r\n\r\nprices  of  commodities and will cause  inflation,\r\n\r\nbut  the Government must, at least, put a stop  to\r\n\r\nunjustifiable increases in prices of commodities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers are prepared to continue the\r\n\r\ntripartite   co-operation  and  to  maintain   the\r\n\r\npresent industrial peace. We give our assurance to\r\n\r\nthe  Government that we will maintain our  present\r\n\r\npolitical  and economic stability. We are  willing\r\n\r\nto  work  harder to achieve greater  economic  and\r\n\r\nindustrial  growth for the Republic  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nfor  the benefit of all workers, employers and the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  But please do not ask us to  continue\r\n\r\ngiving sacrifices all the time. The benefits  most\r\n\r\nemployers  derive  from  the  enforcement  of  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act  and Industrial Relations  Act  of\r\n\r\n1968  have  been tremendous, especially on  longer\r\n\r\nworking  hours, lesser number of public  holidays,\r\n\r\nrestriction  of overtime work, limitation  to  the\r\n\r\nannual bonus to one month only, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, most employers have benefited\r\n\r\nfrom the toil, sweat and sacrifices of the workers\r\n\r\nsince  1968 and they have already made substantial\r\n\r\nprofits    together   with   business   expansion.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the time has come for  them  to  share\r\n\r\ntheir profits sincerely with the workers by giving\r\n\r\nthem   bigger  bonus,  adjustment  of  wages   and\r\n\r\nimprovement in fringe benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 5th March, 1972, the Prime Minister announced\r\n\r\nat  the  N.T.U.C.  Delegates Conference  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would pay its employees an  allowance\r\n\r\nof  an  extra month's salary at the end of  March,\r\n\r\n1972,  and  would increase the C.P.F, contribution\r\n\r\nfrom 10 per cent to 12 per cent. He also said that\r\n\r\nthe  Government would review the salaries  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment employees in Divisions I to IV, as well\r\n\r\nas the public daily-rated workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers in Singapore welcome the good news\r\n\r\nannounced  by  the  Government  that  the   C.P.F.\r\n\r\ncontribution for the workers in the private sector\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  also increase from 10 per cent  to  12  per\r\n\r\ncent  as from July, 1972, and it will be increased\r\n\r\ngradually to 15 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope all employers will follow the good example\r\n\r\nset   by  the  Government.  The  workers  are  not\r\n\r\ndemanding  fantastic bonuses or wage  adjustments.\r\n\r\nWe  only ask the employers to give a bonus if they\r\n\r\nmake a profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a well known fact that annual bonus has\r\n\r\nbeen  paid by Chinese employers as well as Western\r\n\r\nemployers since pre-war days. When employers  make\r\n\r\nprofit  they  must pay bonus to the  workers.  The\r\n\r\nworkers  are  the ones that help the employers  to\r\n\r\nmake  profit  in  their business. Therefore,  they\r\n\r\nmust share their profit with the workers by paying\r\n\r\nthem  bonus. Mr Speaker, Sir, annual  bonus  is  a\r\n\r\nnecessity  to  the workers. Bonus is  indeed  very\r\n\r\nhelpful to the workers especially to pay for their\r\n\r\nchildren's school textbooks, school uniforms,  new\r\n\r\nclothing's for the new year celebration;  to  meet\r\n\r\nadditional  expenses on new year,  such  as  food,\r\n\r\ndrinks  and  ang-pows;  to settle  all  the  debts\r\n\r\nincurred and, if possible, to put something  aside\r\n\r\nfor  saving.  Bonus is a necessity to the  workers\r\n\r\nespecially the lower and middle income  groups.  I\r\n\r\nam  sure  all  managerial and executive  employees\r\n\r\nwould like to get an annual increment of salary as\r\n\r\nwell  as  bonus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite understandable that\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  not giving bonus to its  employees\r\n\r\nbut  an  additional  extra month's  salary  as  an\r\n\r\nallowance  is  just  as  good  as  a  bonus.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  employees really  deserve  this  extra\r\n\r\nallowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the N.T.U.C, held its Ordinary\r\n\r\nDelegates Conference from 3rd to 5th March,  1972,\r\n\r\nand   the   Industrial  Policy   and   Resolutions\r\n\r\nCommittee's  recommendation on the  bonus  payment\r\n\r\nwas  unanimously  adopted  by  the  Delegates   as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Committee agreed that the statutory limit of\r\n\r\none  month  is unrealistic and is further  of  the\r\n\r\nopinion that there should be no blanket ban on the\r\n\r\npayment  of  bonus.  Hence the Committee  strongly\r\n\r\nrecommends  that  bonus be made a negotiable  item\r\n\r\nwithout any ceiling on the quantum of bonus.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the restriction to only one month's salary\r\n\r\nas a bonus payment through negotiation was imposed\r\n\r\nby  the Government under the Employment Act, 1968.\r\n\r\nWith the present economic boom most employers  are\r\n\r\nmaking very good profits, and I strongly appeal to\r\n\r\nthe  Government to allow the workers to  negotiate\r\n\r\nbonus with their employers up to three months.  If\r\n\r\nthis proposal is agreed to by the Government,  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C, will be prepared to accept it although we\r\n\r\nprefer  that  there should be no  ceiling  on  the\r\n\r\nquantum of bonus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance in his\r\n\r\nBudget Statement in Parliament on 7th March, 1972,\r\n\r\npaid  tribute  to  the workers  for  changing  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties and uncertainties caused by the  loss\r\n\r\nof   neighbouring  markets  upon  separation  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  loss  of unemployment  and  foreign\r\n\r\nexchange  upon the British military rundown,  into\r\n\r\neconomic opportunities, o opportunities which have\r\n\r\nnow   produced   our  present  healthy   financial\r\n\r\nsituation.  Yet it is most regrettable that  there\r\n\r\nare  still  some  unscrupulous employers  who  are\r\n\r\nagainst the formation of trade unions to represent\r\n\r\nthe workers and victimise the union organisers  by\r\n\r\ndismissal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the N.T.U.C, is forming a union\r\n\r\nfor the managerial and executive employees. We are\r\n\r\nnow  drafting its constitution. The response  from\r\n\r\none  oil  company  is very good.  Out  of  its  25\r\n\r\nmanagerial   and   executive  employees   covering\r\n\r\nsecretary,  superintendent,  auditor,  accountant,\r\n\r\nchemist, engineer, etc., 24 have already signed in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  forming a union. They have officially\r\n\r\nwritten to the N.T.U.C. Secretary for Organisation\r\n\r\nand   Administration  to  join   this   union.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand   one  of  its  management   expatriate\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  had said hostile  and  anti-union\r\n\r\nremarks  about  their 24 managerial and  executive\r\n\r\nemployees  for  signing in support  of  forming  a\r\n\r\nunion.  I  hope  the management representative  of\r\n\r\nthis   oil  company  will  appreciate  that  their\r\n\r\nmanagerial and executive employees have the  right\r\n\r\nto  join  a  union to protect their job  security,\r\n\r\nbetter wages, bonus and conditions of service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the petroleum workers' union, i.e., the\r\n\r\nUnited  Workers of Petroleum Industry, is watching\r\n\r\nthe  development closely on this oil company,  and\r\n\r\nwe  fully  support  its managerial  and  executive\r\n\r\nemployees  to join the union to be formed  by  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. It was reported by the N.T.U.C. Secretary\r\n\r\nfor  Industrial  Disputes that a  good  number  of\r\n\r\ndismissals took place while the union was awaiting\r\n\r\nrecognition,  pending  a ballot  to  be  taken  by\r\n\r\nmembers  of the union. In fairness to the  workers\r\n\r\nand to stop the tendency of employers to abuse the\r\n\r\nvarious  prerogatives so conferred  upon  them,  1\r\n\r\nrequest the Government to amend section 17 (2) of\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Relations Act (Cap. 124  of  1970)\r\n\r\nand remove such prerogatives immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the N.T.U.C is preparing a brief to the\r\n\r\nGovernment on alleged victimisation of workers  by\r\n\r\nemployers  who  are anti-union,  and  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will not hesitate to use the big  stick\r\n\r\non  them. I would suggest that employers  who  are\r\n\r\nhostile  or  against trade unionism, or  victimise\r\n\r\ntrade  union organisers, should be packed  into  a\r\n\r\nbox  and  despatched back to their own  countries,\r\n\r\nand  the sooner we do it the better it will be.  I\r\n\r\nam  glad  the Prime Minister has stated  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would not allow workers to be  bullied\r\n\r\nor coerced by employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under the amendments to the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations  Act, 1968,  employers  were\r\n\r\ngiven  the  power of hiring and firing, promotion,\r\n\r\ntransfer   and   retrenchment.  There   are   some\r\n\r\nunscrupulous  employers  using  these   managerial\r\n\r\nprerogatives to victimise workers as well as union\r\n\r\norganisers.   It  has  been  proven   that   these\r\n\r\nemployers    have    abused    their    managerial\r\n\r\nprerogatives.  Therefore,  I  request  that  these\r\n\r\nmanagerial prerogatives should be deleted from the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Act immediately.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, with regard to the existence  of\r\n\r\nthe  Wages  Council, of which  N.T.U.C, is  being\r\n\r\nrepresented by our President, Mr Phey  Yew  Kok,\r\n\r\nMr  Devan  Nair,  our  Secretary-General  and  our\r\n\r\nAdviser, Prof. Tom H. Elliott, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  full  confidence in them. I hope this  Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil will be helpful to the workers and not  be\r\n\r\nrestrictive to the reasonable wage increase demand\r\n\r\nby  the workers. I hope the Wages Council will see\r\n\r\nthat   the  bonus  payment  system  will  not   be\r\n\r\nabolished. Perhaps, I may say the workers have the\r\n\r\nright to demand bonus payment if the employers are\r\n\r\nmaking good profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the Government's policies as\r\n\r\npresented in the Budget Statement of the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a week has passed\r\n\r\nsince  the  Minister  for  Finance  delivered  his\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement,  but the  benign  and  cheerful\r\n\r\neffect  of the Minister's words is still with  us.\r\n\r\nThe  Budget  has indicated correctly the  relative\r\n\r\nwell-being  of our people, and holds out  a  happy\r\n\r\nexpectation  for  the future, if  we  harbour  our\r\n\r\nresources  as prudently today and tomorrow  as  we\r\n\r\ndid  yesterday. The keynote of the  Budget  speech\r\n\r\nseems  to  be one of prudent confidence  based  on\r\n\r\ncommendable achievement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is no warrant for complacence. We\r\n\r\nhave  to do better. One aspect to look at  in  our\r\n\r\nstriving  to  improve is the  question  of  labour\r\n\r\nproductivity. The Minister has admitted that rapid\r\n\r\nindustrial expansion has been wholly dependent  on\r\n\r\na  growing labour input. For the future,  however,\r\n\r\nthere   can   be  no  industrial  growth   without\r\n\r\nproductivity. Therefore, a vigorous programme  for\r\n\r\nthe  up-grading of our manpower skills has  to  be\r\n\r\nembarked on energetically, to increase the average\r\n\r\nproductivity of our workers. In this connection, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  urge also that more  co-ordinated\r\n\r\nefforts  be spent on making people more  conscious\r\n\r\nof  the  necessity for quality in our products.  I\r\n\r\nsuggest that there will be a grave potential waste\r\n\r\nif  proper attention is not given to developing  a\r\n\r\npride in workmanship, pride in contributing  to  a\r\n\r\nfinished  product of high quality. There seems  to\r\n\r\nbe a mistaken\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbelief prevailing in certain quarters that quality\r\n\r\nis   equated  with,  so  to  speak,  Rolls   Royce\r\n\r\nstandards  therefore appealing only to a  few  and\r\n\r\nhence  possessing  limited marketability.  Nothing\r\n\r\ncould  be  more disadvantageous to our  industrial\r\n\r\ngrowth than this mistaken concept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have therefore to stress, with manufacturers\r\n\r\nand  workers alike, a right view of quality  which\r\n\r\nimplies conformity to standards set in relation to\r\n\r\nreliability  of performance. And the criterion  of\r\n\r\nreliability  has  to be what is  expected  by  the\r\n\r\nbuyers  of  our goods. If we cannot fulfil  market\r\n\r\nexpectations    of    the    standard    of    our\r\n\r\ngoods-obviously good-bye markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that, when the Minister talks of \"new markets\r\n\r\n.., found for the products manufactured by  local\r\n\r\nindustries\" and \"increasing promotional efforts  .\r\n\r\nbeing  made to establish new markets overseas\",  I\r\n\r\nam sure he will remember that this will result not\r\n\r\nonly from increasing management sophistication and\r\n\r\ngreatly  improved skills of workers but also  from\r\n\r\nbetter  quality of goods. I do not think that  the\r\n\r\nlast factor will, of necessity, and automatically,\r\n\r\nbe  an  outcome of a combination of the first  two\r\n\r\nfactors.  I  do not think that simply  because  we\r\n\r\nhave excellent management and skilful workers, our\r\n\r\ngoods  will  automatically be of the best  quality\r\n\r\nSteps must be taken to ensure that all three  come\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these steps is, of course, what the\r\n\r\nMinister himself has mentioned, namely, that there\r\n\r\nmust  be  an  equitable sharing of the  fruits  of\r\n\r\ngreater  efficiency (and this must include  better\r\n\r\nquality). The difficulty is how to determine this;\r\n\r\nand  the National Wages Council will have its work\r\n\r\ncut   out   to   solve  this  problem.   But   the\r\n\r\ndetermination of incentives to workers to  improve\r\n\r\nquality, as well as the assessment of rewards  for\r\n\r\nhigher  productivity should be an urgent  part  of\r\n\r\nthe task of the Council,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way there is also the difficulty of\r\n\r\ndetermining  in  what way quality may  be  ensured\r\n\r\nthrough incentives to manufacturers. Generally,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof course, there could be accelerated depreciation\r\n\r\nfor   capital   investment  in   quality   control\r\n\r\nequipment. I would like to imagine that  the  only\r\n\r\nreason why the Minister did not add this (seventh)\r\n\r\ntax  relief  item to the six tax relief  items  he\r\n\r\nlisted, was the difficulty in distinguishing,  for\r\n\r\nexample, quality control equipment from production\r\n\r\nequipment. I hope that Government will not forget,\r\n\r\nhowever, its undertaking given in the addendum  to\r\n\r\nthe  President's  address at the last  opening  of\r\n\r\nParliament  in July, 1971. In the section  of  the\r\n\r\naddendum  relating to the Ministry of Science  and\r\n\r\nTechnology, it was stated that consideration would\r\n\r\nbe  given  to  the  possibility of  providing  tax\r\n\r\nrelief  for expenditure on equipment and technical\r\n\r\nmanpower  used for quality control  also.  At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time if incentives are at all to be  offered\r\n\r\nto  employers  to  improve the  sophistication  of\r\n\r\nworkers  through training schemes,  it  should  be\r\n\r\nhoped  that  incentives will also be  offered  for\r\n\r\ntraining in quality control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Budget Statement it is clear that no\r\n\r\navenue  should  be overlooked that  will  lead  to\r\n\r\nassurance  of higher productivity. This seems  all\r\n\r\nthe more urgent with the reference of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  to  the continuing pressure  on  the\r\n\r\nbalance  of  payments  which  he  hopes  will   be\r\n\r\nrelieved through our industrial growth as well  as\r\n\r\nthrough \"invisible\" earnings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tourism is one important activity that results in\r\n\r\nsuch earnings. The Minister for Finance has stated\r\n\r\nthat,   with  greater  promotional  efforts,   the\r\n\r\ntourist  industry may be expected to increase  its\r\n\r\nearnings.   I   hope,  however,   that   as   much\r\n\r\npromotional   pressure  will  be  applied   inside\r\n\r\nSingapore as outside it to boost tourism. By this,\r\n\r\nI  refer to efforts to make the tourist appreciate\r\n\r\nSingapore   as   a   city  well  worth   visiting.\r\n\r\nSingapore's  cleanness and greenness are  features\r\n\r\nfavourably  commented upon by  visitors.  But  the\r\n\r\npeople  with  whom  tourists  normally  come  into\r\n\r\ncontact  should be encouraged to treat the tourist\r\n\r\nwell  and further give him a favourable impression\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, one category of people tourists meet\r\n\r\noften  is the taxi-driver. Some taxi-drivers  have\r\n\r\ncommented   that  previously  foreign  service-men\r\n\r\nstationed  in Singapore represented  a  very  good\r\n\r\nclientele. Now that these service-men are fewer in\r\n\r\nnumbers,  taxi-drivers should realise a  potential\r\n\r\nnew   clientele  that  tourists  could  represent.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the minority of taxi-drivers  who  are\r\n\r\ndisposed  to take tourists for a ride at a  higher\r\n\r\nfare  than the standard rates should be shown that\r\n\r\nthis  is  shortsighted. Tourists are pleased  when\r\n\r\nthey  find that they can get from place  to  place\r\n\r\nwithout fear of being mulcted over fares. And,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,   the   Tourist  Promotion  Board   should\r\n\r\nencourage  the  acts  of  honesty  we  read  about\r\n\r\nsometimes  in  the  papers,  when  taxi  men,  for\r\n\r\nexample, return valuables and money left in  their\r\n\r\nvehicles, and when other forms of help are  given,\r\n\r\neven at the risk of trouble to the taxi-drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another type of people tourists come in contact\r\n\r\nwith  are  shopkeepers.  Recently  I  overheard  a\r\n\r\ntourist  complaining that he  was  unable  to  get\r\n\r\nsmall  change for a dollar note from any of a  row\r\n\r\nof  stores in a shopping complex. He had wanted to\r\n\r\nuse a public telephones, but was unable to do  so\r\n\r\nuntil  another foreigner offered him a  couple  of\r\n\r\nshillings  for this purpose. If this uncooperative\r\n\r\nattitude  is  characteristic of  shopkeepers  this\r\n\r\nwill not do our tourist image much good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another hazard, for example, a visitor to\r\n\r\nSingapore  faces,  is the young  voluntary  worker\r\n\r\nselling  flags  for  charity.  Could  these  well-intentioned young people be advised to leave  non-\r\n\r\nSingaporeans alone? One point worth noting may  be\r\n\r\nthe  rather  high  hotel  charges  prevailing   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Earlier today we heard the Member  for\r\n\r\nPotong Pasir raising the question as to how is  it\r\n\r\nthat  occupancy rates are falling. One may make  a\r\n\r\nshrewd  guess  that hotels with a  high  occupancy\r\n\r\nrate  are  those whose charges are tolerable.  One\r\n\r\npoint  worth  noting  is  that  the  low  rate  of\r\n\r\noccupancy  may  be  due to the rather  high  hotel\r\n\r\ncharges prevailing in Singapore. With\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreater  ease  of air travel, it is not  the  rich\r\n\r\ntraveller who passes through Singapore as often as\r\n\r\nthe  couple  or the person who has  saved  for  an\r\n\r\nearnest  look at a foreign land. And such are  not\r\n\r\nthose  who  necessarily want  plush,  chandeliered\r\n\r\nenvirons  where the charges are commensurate  with\r\n\r\nthe princely setting. A tourist may be disposed to\r\n\r\nstay longer than the average of 3.9 days that  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister has referred to, if he were  less\r\n\r\ndeterred   by   high  hotel  rates.   Could   this\r\n\r\ndeterrence be a significant reason, among  others,\r\n\r\nwhy  the  average stay of visitors has risen  only\r\n\r\nfrom  3.3  to  3.9 days in five years?  Would  the\r\n\r\nTourist Promotion Board be doing reliable research\r\n\r\non this and similar matters?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is useful to note that the Tourist Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard  has  set up a special conventions  unit  to\r\n\r\nencourage  the  holding  of  more  conventions  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. It would be just as useful to note that\r\n\r\nhelp  might  fruitfully  be  extended  to  humbler\r\n\r\ngroups than connectionists, for example, students,\r\n\r\neducational  groups from various countries.  These\r\n\r\nserious-minded people come here to study our  ways\r\n\r\nand our land and institutions. When they return to\r\n\r\ntheir  own countries they play the role of willing\r\n\r\nambassadors  for Singapore, and in  the  long  run\r\n\r\nhelp  to make Singapore better known to their  own\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, it would also be good for the\r\n\r\nTourist   Promotion  Board  to   give   help   and\r\n\r\nencouragement  to  our cultural  ambassadors  like\r\n\r\nmembers  of the recent successful cultural mission\r\n\r\nto  Adelaide when they go abroad. And 1 would also\r\n\r\nimagine  that  it would be realised as  a  serious\r\n\r\nfunction of the Tourist Promotion Board to act  as\r\n\r\npatrons of local art and artistic activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to make brief comments on a\r\n\r\nfew   other  matters  the  Finance  Minister   has\r\n\r\nreferred to. I will keep to the order the Minister\r\n\r\nhimself  has  observed.  With  regard  to   public\r\n\r\nhousing, it is gratifying to note a higher  growth\r\n\r\nrate in 1971. I hope that, with a reduction in the\r\n\r\nrate  of  hotel  construction and construction  of\r\n\r\nshopping\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomplexes as well as of urban renewal projects,  I\r\n\r\nhope  public housing will show an even higher rate\r\n\r\nof  growth, so that tens of thousands of people on\r\n\r\nthe waiting list for Housing and Development Board\r\n\r\nflats will receive their allocations earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Mass Rapid Transit System, we\r\n\r\nwere  told that the feasibility study would  begin\r\n\r\nthis  year. Anyway it will get underway soon. What\r\n\r\nI  am  concerned about is that we do not wait till\r\n\r\nthe  implementation of this system before  we  see\r\n\r\norderly traffic on the roads. Something should  be\r\n\r\ndone   soon  especially  through  persuasion   and\r\n\r\neducation,   initially,  to  make   driving   more\r\n\r\ncharacterised  by consideration and  courtesy  and\r\n\r\nless  by a kind of law of the asphalt jungle. This\r\n\r\nwill  help result in more safety for our children,\r\n\r\npedestrians,  motorists,  and  help   reduce   the\r\n\r\nappalling  toll  of  road deaths  and  injury  and\r\n\r\nmonetary loss through traffic accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another point, the Minister has observed that\r\n\r\nour  success  will depend on the capacity  of  our\r\n\r\npeople  to  improve themselves through  education,\r\n\r\ntraining and experience. What the Minister  means,\r\n\r\nof  course,  is that stress should  be  placed  on\r\n\r\ncontinuing education, or adult education. If  only\r\n\r\nthe   Minister   had  put  it   that   way!   Then\r\n\r\nencouragement  would be given  to  those  agencies\r\n\r\nmaking  continuing  education  provisions,   which\r\n\r\nshould be always ready to orientate themselves  to\r\n\r\nnational objectives. With the bewildering rate  of\r\n\r\naccretion of technical and technological  know-how\r\n\r\na  painful  characteristic of  our  modern  world,\r\n\r\nevery  encouragement should be given to people  to\r\n\r\nmake  them  aware of the necessity for  continuing\r\n\r\neducation.  At the same time because of  the  very\r\n\r\nemphasis, in modern circumstances, on science  and\r\n\r\ntechnology, it is hoped that continuing  education\r\n\r\ncould also provide a much needed cultural or  even\r\n\r\nliberal  and gracious balance against too great  a\r\n\r\npreoccupation with materialistic concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On yet another matter reference has been made to\r\n\r\nthe  appointment  of  the Labour  Adviser  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLabour.  The  principle behind such appointment  -\r\n\r\nthe  utilisation of available consultancy -  is  a\r\n\r\nsound and commendable one. Perhaps there could  be\r\n\r\none  or  two  more of such appointments  to  other\r\n\r\nministries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally may I end on a sylvan note. I am glad\r\n\r\nthat   the  Parks  and  Trees  Division  will   be\r\n\r\nexpanding its area of activity with the opening of\r\n\r\nnew  parks  and wooded areas. The Parks and  Trees\r\n\r\nDivision  has  done a very good job in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nHowever,  apart from the added pleasure  of  these\r\n\r\namenities,  the Parks and Trees Division  may  now\r\n\r\nfeel  less disposed to rip up asphalt and pavement\r\n\r\nin  order  to  plant trees and shrubs and  thereby\r\n\r\noccasionally block the view of motorists  as  well\r\n\r\nas  make the job of someone who wishes to  take  a\r\n\r\nwalk  along  a pavement by the roadside  a  pretty\r\n\r\nadventurous one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to add to those commendatory remarks\r\n\r\nof  other  Members, my own humble commendation  on\r\n\r\nthe Minister's able statement on the Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir originally I thought of speaking  in\r\n\r\nEnglish,  but in view of the fact that the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Whampoa has spoken in Mandarin, I would  like\r\n\r\nto speak in Mandarin also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since independence, Singapore has, in the various\r\n\r\nannual financial budgets, made provisions to  take\r\n\r\ncare   of   its   long-term  economic  development\r\n\r\ninterests.  She  has  never resorted  to  increase\r\n\r\ntaxation suddenly in order to get revenue quickly,\r\n\r\nas  this  would lead to the inevitable  result  of\r\n\r\n\"killing  the  goose that Jays  the  golden  egg\".\r\n\r\nAmong  certain Eastern economic theories  of  long\r\n\r\nstanding,  there is one that says \"when wealth  is\r\n\r\ngathered, the people will scatter, and when wealth\r\n\r\nis scattered, the people will gather\". Now this is\r\n\r\nonly  directed  at the corrupted economic  system,\r\n\r\nand Singapore has nothing to do with this type  of\r\n\r\ndecadent and corrupted economic system. Of course,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  also  pay  attention to  the  accumulation  of\r\n\r\nnational  wealth, but this should not be  done  at\r\n\r\nthe  expense  of the interests of the people.  The\r\n\r\nreason why our national coffers can increase their\r\n\r\nintakes is because of the diligent efforts put  in\r\n\r\nby our people. Under these conditions of increased\r\n\r\nproductivity,  our national G.N.P, has  reached  a\r\n\r\nhigh  peak,  bringing  about  greater  wealth  and\r\n\r\nbetter  living  conditions, to be shared  by  more\r\n\r\npeople  who  have  participated  in  the  economic\r\n\r\nproduction. Thus the interests of the people  have\r\n\r\nnot  declined.  On  the other  hand,  the  average\r\n\r\nindividual's income has been raised. This  is  one\r\n\r\nof   the  main  reasons  for  Singapore's  general\r\n\r\nprosperity.  The  more decisive fact  is  that  we\r\n\r\nhave,  through  industrial development  and  other\r\n\r\nefforts   at  economic  promotion,  overcome   the\r\n\r\nserious unemployment situation that existed before\r\n\r\n1959 when the People's Action Party came to power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Singapore has reached a stage of full\r\n\r\nemployment.  This  is  an  undeniable  fact.  Full\r\n\r\nemployment is what socialists think of as an ideal\r\n\r\nattainment in economic development. A few  decades\r\n\r\nago    some    British   socialists    in    their\r\n\r\n\"Reconstruction Manifesto\" had listed one of their\r\n\r\nimportant   ideals   and   objectives   as    full\r\n\r\nemployment. In their declared manifesto, \"The Four\r\n\r\nPillars  of  the  House of Tomorrow\"  one  of  the\r\n\r\npillars  related to the ideal of full  employment.\r\n\r\nVery  few people could have expected that the good\r\n\r\nthings  of \"tomorrow\" in the dreams and ideals  of\r\n\r\nthose socialists could now become a reality in our\r\n\r\nlittle island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to taxation, of course, any Finance\r\n\r\nMinister who does not declare or envisage any  new\r\n\r\ntaxes will be a popular Minister. However, much as\r\n\r\nwe  want to be free from any taxation or to  enjoy\r\n\r\ntax reliefs we cannot always put this into effect.\r\n\r\nA  nation  is just like an individual.  There  are\r\n\r\ntimes  when  we need to call upon every individual\r\n\r\nto  contribute his part in the form of taxes,  and\r\n\r\nthis   should   receive  the   response   of   all\r\n\r\nconscientious  people. In spite of this,  we  will\r\n\r\nstill  be  glad  to  see  our  industrious  people\r\n\r\nenjoying and sharing the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfruits of our economic progress. The good news that\r\n\r\nthere  will be no new taxes and further tax reliefs\r\n\r\nare    given,   reflects   our   general   economic\r\n\r\nprosperity, and we can all the more realise that on\r\n\r\nthis  occasion, our personal interest matches  with\r\n\r\nour   national  interest.  They  are   not   always\r\n\r\nincompatible with each other. But when the national\r\n\r\ninterest is taken care of, then individual interest\r\n\r\nwill be better safeguarded. This cannot be denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget speech, one important point worth\r\n\r\nnoting  is  the adjustment of the salary scheme  of\r\n\r\nthe   Civil  Service.  The  Civil  Service  is   an\r\n\r\nimportant link in a democratic system. When a party\r\n\r\nforms the government, its policies will have to  be\r\n\r\nimplemented  by the Civil Service. This  processing\r\n\r\nmachinery should, therefore, be reliable and  there\r\n\r\nmust  be  a sense of integrity. In the past  a  few\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  created a bad  impression  of  the\r\n\r\nCivil Service. However, to speak the truth, we have\r\n\r\nnow  many capable and good civil servants,  all  of\r\n\r\nwhom  we  can be proud of. Our Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nwas  one  of  them. Judging them  from  any  angle,\r\n\r\nwhether  it be efficiency or integrity,  our  Civil\r\n\r\nService  can be said to be the best in this region.\r\n\r\nThat our democratic socialist principles can be put\r\n\r\ninto  effect and that our economic growth has  been\r\n\r\nspeeded  up, we owe all this to the Civil  Service.\r\n\r\nThey  have  played an important role; they  are  an\r\n\r\nimportant factor in the whole process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, the Government had been\r\n\r\nable  to re-adjust our economy by various means  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  private  sector  has  benefited  a  lot.\r\n\r\nHowever, the private sector has become a good green\r\n\r\npasture in the eyes of civil servants. Thus if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment does not adjust their salary  scales  so\r\n\r\nas  to reduce the discrepancy in wages between  the\r\n\r\npublic   and  private  sectors,  then  more   civil\r\n\r\nservants  will  resign to join the private  sector.\r\n\r\nAlthough this will not shake the foundation of  our\r\n\r\nCivil  Service, it is necessary for the  Government\r\n\r\nto bring the salary scales of the Civil Service\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  equitable  with those of the private  sector.\r\n\r\nThen this will make working conditions in the Civil\r\n\r\nService   more  attractive.  This  will   also   be\r\n\r\nconducive  to  the  principles  of  democracy.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse, 1 do not wish to relate the good traditions\r\n\r\nof  incorruptibility of the Government  service  to\r\n\r\nthe readjustment of the salary scales. Although the\r\n\r\none  month's salary as an annual allowance may  not\r\n\r\nbe  any  reflection on the integrity of  the  Civil\r\n\r\nService,  even  if an allowance of  less  than  one\r\n\r\nmonth's  salary  would  not  at  all  affect  their\r\n\r\nintegrity.  However, a rational salary system  will\r\n\r\nbe  conducive to the good traditions of  the  Civil\r\n\r\nService. The reputation of our Civil Service as one\r\n\r\nof  integrity and honesty is a national  asset.  We\r\n\r\nshould  try  to  safeguard and  preserve  this.  If\r\n\r\nconducive measures are necessary to safeguard  this\r\n\r\nasset, then we must not neglect them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, some Government departments are undergoing a\r\n\r\nreshuffle   of   personnel  and  changes   to   the\r\n\r\nadministration   as  a  whole  with   a   view   to\r\n\r\nintroducing computerisation and modernisation.  All\r\n\r\nthese  are  meant  to raise the efficiency  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment administrative machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading between the lines of the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister's Budget speech, we can see the reflection\r\n\r\nof  the upward trend and the mood of the people  in\r\n\r\ntheir effort to march forward in the path of nation\r\n\r\nbuilding. I cannot help giving my full support  for\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance's financial policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen  Finance Ministers present surplus budgets  to\r\n\r\nParliaments,  Members  need not  necessarily  offer\r\n\r\nbouquets  to  them since in modern  welfare  states\r\n\r\nsurplus  budgets are considered more as a  pedantic\r\n\r\nluxury which developing nations cannot afford.  But\r\n\r\nin  the  case  of  a  nation like  Singapore  while\r\n\r\nmaintaining   the   high   tempo   of   development\r\n\r\nactivities  with  a 14 per cent increase  in  Gross\r\n\r\nNational  Product,  thus  raising  the  per  capita\r\n\r\nincome\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  $2,960  to  $3,317 in 1971, together  with  a\r\n\r\nsurplus  budget,  we  cannot  help  expressing  our\r\n\r\nappreciation  of the Finance Minister  as  well  as\r\n\r\nthose   who  assisted  him  in  this  task.   While\r\n\r\nsimultaneously stressing the need to  maintain  the\r\n\r\nsame high standard, we should not hesitate to adopt\r\n\r\na  constructive and critical outlook in this Budget\r\n\r\ndebate so that the upward trend is not deflected by\r\n\r\nunforeseen errors, even of an insignificant nature.\r\n\r\nHence,  the Government's financial policy statement\r\n\r\nand  the  Estimates  of Expenditure  for  the  year\r\n\r\n1972-73 presented to the House should be viewed  in\r\n\r\nthis perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, at the outset, state in categorical terms\r\n\r\nbased on my personal experience in this House, that\r\n\r\nI  would  not  hesitate  to  appreciate  the  basic\r\n\r\napproach  of our Finance Minister who has exhibited\r\n\r\nin  the  past  a readiness to listen to  criticisms\r\n\r\nfrom   all   sections  of  this  House,  and   many\r\n\r\nsuggestions which can be implemented were  accepted\r\n\r\nwithout any reservations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, no one will dispute the fact that\r\n\r\nthe   economic   and   political   problems   which\r\n\r\nconfronted the Republic during the past  few  years\r\n\r\nhave  to  form  the backdrop before  we  are  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to view the economic achievement  in  any\r\n\r\nperspective.   As   against   neX1igib1e    natural\r\n\r\nresources,   substantial   reduction   in   British\r\n\r\nmilitary expenditure, the necessity to explore  new\r\n\r\nand  highly competitive international markets,  the\r\n\r\nturbulent  political situation  around  with  extra\r\n\r\ndemand  on  our  defence, and a young  and  restive\r\n\r\npopulation  demanding new horizons  in  development\r\n\r\nplanning   and  employment  along  with  a   highly\r\n\r\nvolatile  international monetary situation,  it  is\r\n\r\nrather a pleasant surprise that our G.N.P, rose  by\r\n\r\n$860.8  million  to  reach  $7,000.8  million-   an\r\n\r\nincrease of 14 per cent- within a period of  twelve\r\n\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister would prefer to call it a non-inflationary growth since, according to him, the\r\n\r\ngeneral  price level has not increased appreciably.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  latest issues of the Monthly  Digest\r\n\r\nof Statistics' for January and February 1972 do not\r\n\r\nappear attractive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  regard to consumer prices. There appeared  to\r\n\r\nbe  an  overall increase of approximately three  to\r\n\r\nfour  per  cent. But in the general context  of  an\r\n\r\noverall  growth  as  related to the  general  price\r\n\r\nlevel,  I  do  agree that there  has  not  been  an\r\n\r\nappreciable increase. Nevertheless, it is  not  out\r\n\r\nof  place to suggest that constant vigilance has to\r\n\r\nbe  kept  with regard to price levels so  that  the\r\n\r\ngrowth is not retarded by inflationary pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated by the Finance Minister, the structural\r\n\r\ntransformation  of  the economy  from  an  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade to an industrial society appears to be moving\r\n\r\nat  a desirable pace. It is rather sheer necessity.\r\n\r\nprevailing   opportunity,  long-term  requirements,\r\n\r\nalong  with  the  spirit of entrepreneurship  which\r\n\r\nhave  accelerated this process. I observe from  the\r\n\r\nfigures  that  over the decade  the  share  of  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector,  as  related  to  the  Gross\r\n\r\nDomestic Product, has increased from 11.2 per  cent\r\n\r\nto  28.5  per cent, while that of the trade  sector\r\n\r\nhas dropped from 70.7 per cent to 55.5 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing sector alone has made\r\n\r\nsubstantial  progress over the decade.  The  sudden\r\n\r\nspurt  appears to have taken place during the  last\r\n\r\nthree  to four years from $716 million in  1968  to\r\n\r\n$1,490.9 million in 1971. The entrepot and domestic\r\n\r\ntrades  together are maintaining an average  growth\r\n\r\nrate  of  approximately 14 to 16  per  cent  during\r\n\r\n1966-71  while there appears to be a  marked  drop,\r\n\r\nthat is, 9.6 per cent in growth rate during 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has maintained that domestic trade\r\n\r\nfared  better and that it was entrepot  which  has,\r\n\r\ndue   to  logical  circumstances,  declined.  Here,\r\n\r\nprogressively   direct  trade   link   improvements\r\n\r\nmaintained by our neighbours had a negative  impact\r\n\r\non   the  entrepot  sector.  Leaving  alone   their\r\n\r\nchanging  role in trade patterns, even our approach\r\n\r\nduring  the  last few years has been to  promote  a\r\n\r\nstructural  transformation and, therefore,  not  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  serve  as  out-posts  of  a  decadent\r\n\r\neconomy  which used to he subjected in the past  to\r\n\r\nviolent fluctuations, depending on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrise  and  fall  in rubber and tin  prices  in  the\r\n\r\ninternational markets. Hence, I might say  that  it\r\n\r\naugurs  well  that a modest rise in domestic  trade\r\n\r\nand  overall  accelerated progress in manufacturing\r\n\r\nand  construction sectors will go  a  long  way  in\r\n\r\nassisting  us in attaining the desirable  objective\r\n\r\nof  full-employment  with one of  the  highest  per\r\n\r\ncapita income in Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, may I also add that those\r\n\r\nemployed in the entrepot sector could be eventually\r\n\r\nabsorbed  into  the growing domestic  trade  sector\r\n\r\nwith  minimum dislocation. From that point of  view\r\n\r\nalso  expanding domestic trade sector is a  healthy\r\n\r\nsign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Mr Speaker, Sir, it appears from\r\n\r\ninformation  furnished  to  this  House  that   the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector  has registered  the  fastest\r\n\r\ngrowth rate, and we cannot rule out the significant\r\n\r\nrole    played   by   the   electronics   industry.\r\n\r\nIncidentally I might say that this industry,  which\r\n\r\nemploys  a very high percentage of labour force  at\r\n\r\ncompetitive  wage  rates, is expanding  its  export\r\n\r\nmarkets substantially. At the moment there is a ban\r\n\r\non  the  exports  of strategic goods  to  Communist\r\n\r\ncountries   by  the  United  States  and   if   the\r\n\r\nprevailing  political  climate  improves  for   the\r\n\r\nbetter   between   East  and  West,   the   further\r\n\r\npossibility of substantial increase in  exports  of\r\n\r\nelectronic goods can be expected in the near future\r\n\r\nwith  Singapore too sharing a part of that boom  in\r\n\r\nterms   of  additional  employment  and  additional\r\n\r\npositive points to our balance of payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making a reference to the manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector,  the  Minister has stated in general  terms\r\n\r\nabout the prospects of multi-national manufacturing\r\n\r\nconcerns.  It  is  perfectly true  that  we  cannot\r\n\r\nexpect  a  complete diversification with regard  to\r\n\r\nthe  establishment of foreign-owned  industries  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  nationality of the industrialists  since\r\n\r\nonly  matured  economies  with  a  high  level   of\r\n\r\ntechnology   and  expertise  can  cope   with   our\r\n\r\nrequirements for industrial expansion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   sophisticated   international   markets   for\r\n\r\nfinished  products.  Nevertheless,  it  has  to  be\r\n\r\nunderstood  if  our  industries  and  manufacturing\r\n\r\nconcerns  are  oriented  in  one  or  two   foreign\r\n\r\ncountries,  then stress and strain  in  the  parent\r\n\r\neconomy might be transposed to a limited extent  to\r\n\r\nour  domestic economy. Leaving economics alone even\r\n\r\nfrom political angle. \"cornering of economy\" by one\r\n\r\nor   two   countries  might  eventually   lead   to\r\n\r\nundesirable  pressures  when  we  are   facing   an\r\n\r\neconomic  turbulence.  Hence,  I  might  say   that\r\n\r\ndiversification  of  industries  on  a  nationality\r\n\r\nbasis should be considered as a healthy sign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While analysing the manufacturing and\r\n\r\nconstruction sectors, we cannot afford to  overlook\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that of late both shipbuilding and  ship\r\n\r\nrepairing  have made substantial strides.  But  the\r\n\r\nshortage  of  skilled manpower continues  to  be  a\r\n\r\nserious   threat  to  accelerated   expansion   and\r\n\r\nalthough   inviting  foreign  nationals  might   be\r\n\r\nconsidered as a temporary measure. I might say that\r\n\r\nwe have to expedite with our programmes relating to\r\n\r\ntraining   within  industry  along  with   overseas\r\n\r\ntraining  with the parent concern. The shortage  of\r\n\r\nlabour,  if  I  am  not mistaken, appears  to  have\r\n\r\ncreated the twin problems, namely, on the one  hand\r\n\r\nit  has pushed up to an appreciable level the  wage\r\n\r\nrates   with  sophisticated  pinching   among   the\r\n\r\ndifferent  groups and, on the other  hand,  it  has\r\n\r\ncreated   minor   bottlenecks  in   the   expansion\r\n\r\nprogramme.  Nevertheless, with all these drawbacks,\r\n\r\nit   is   rather  interesting  to  note  that   the\r\n\r\nshipbuilding  yards  have continued  to  receive  a\r\n\r\nstream  of  orders for tankers as far away  as  the\r\n\r\nContinent  while the repairing yards appear  to  be\r\n\r\nfully booked for a longer period. Incidentally  may\r\n\r\nI  add,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that we must continue  to\r\n\r\nassure our workers employed in this sector and  who\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  our valuable foreign exchange  that\r\n\r\nthe   Labour  Ministry  will  continue  to  enforce\r\n\r\nmaximum  industrial safety so that the  price  paid\r\n\r\nfor  rapid industrialisation will not be that heavy\r\n\r\nin terms of human sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has also referred to\r\n\r\ntrade deficits by the high cost of import of goods.\r\n\r\nI wonder whether the devaluation of the U.S, dollar\r\n\r\nwould, in fact, keep prices down while, at the same\r\n\r\ntime,  pegging down the cost of production of those\r\n\r\ngoods  which require raw materials from the  United\r\n\r\nStates,  especially in the case of the  electronics\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister is thinking in terms of invisible\r\n\r\nitems,  like tourism and insurance, to jack up  the\r\n\r\nbalance  of  trade  accounts  favourably,  then  he\r\n\r\nshould  have  definitely noticed that  tourism  has\r\n\r\nincreased  its share of the Gross Domestic  Product\r\n\r\nfrom $30.5 million in 1960 to $323 million in 1971.\r\n\r\nIt  is  indeed  a general indication that  earnings\r\n\r\nfrom invisibles have increased substantially.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also stated that invisible items\r\n\r\nlike ship repairing might also bring in more on the\r\n\r\ncredit   side.  I  might  also  add  that   freight\r\n\r\ninsurance and building a nucleus of merchant  fleet\r\n\r\nto  transport  our goods as well as  the  cargo  of\r\n\r\nother countries across the seas might add up to the\r\n\r\ninvisible items in the balance of payments accounts\r\n\r\nin  terms of transportation charges. It is a  long-term  approach. There is no necessity to overstress\r\n\r\nthis aspect of the problem since the Government  is\r\n\r\naware  of  the  heated debate in domestic  shipping\r\n\r\ncircles  over the alleged monopoly of some  members\r\n\r\nof  Far  East  Freight Conference who  periodically\r\n\r\nappeared  to  be  increasing their freight  charges\r\n\r\napart from creating problems relating to rights  of\r\n\r\ncargo handling by national shipping lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of tourism and its contribution to\r\n\r\nour   foreign   exchange  earnings  have   received\r\n\r\nsufficient  attention in the  Budget.  But  I  also\r\n\r\nnotice that with regard to the hotel industry,  the\r\n\r\noccupancy  rate has fallen from 73.5  per  cent  in\r\n\r\n1969  to  65.4  per cent in 1971. The expansion  of\r\n\r\nhotels  may have been one of the reasons  for  this\r\n\r\ndecline.  Nevertheless, I am afraid I  cannot  rule\r\n\r\nout   the  possibility  that  sharp  increases   in\r\n\r\naccommodation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharges  and prohibitive prices of other facilities\r\n\r\nto the tourists, including food and beverages, with\r\n\r\nadditional  taxes  over and  above  the  exorbitant\r\n\r\nprices,  might  have had a negative impact  on  the\r\n\r\ninflow  of  tourists especially in the  middle  and\r\n\r\nlower  income  brackets. I  might  add  that  while\r\n\r\nproviding first-class amenities comparable  to  New\r\n\r\nYork  and Tokyo might be a desirable objective,  it\r\n\r\nwould  simultaneously be equally desirable to  keep\r\n\r\nthe  hotel industry under constant check, at  least\r\n\r\nas  a  temporary measure, so that tourism can catch\r\n\r\nup  at  a  faster pace. It is not out of  place  to\r\n\r\nrefer  to  the  spate of criticism  in  the  press,\r\n\r\nincluding  one  from a Hong Kong businessman,  that\r\n\r\neven  a  mild breakfast with coffee in one  of  the\r\n\r\nfirst-class  hotels  in  Singapore   cost   him   a\r\n\r\nsubstantial amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I would also like to stale that a\r\n\r\ncongenial political climate both internally and  in\r\n\r\nthe  surrounding regions is essential for  economic\r\n\r\nadvancement   notwithstanding   all   other    pre-requisites.  Here  too  the domestic  situation  is\r\n\r\ncomparatively calm with a stable Government on  the\r\n\r\nsaddle. On the labour front too, although a  strike\r\n\r\nhere  and  there might be considered as  flexing  a\r\n\r\nmuscle,   by  and  large,  workers  have  responded\r\n\r\nenthusiastically  by maintaining industrial  peace.\r\n\r\nBut  it  need not necessarily mean that  we  should\r\n\r\nhold  on  for  a longer period with regard  to  the\r\n\r\ndivision of the \"National Cake\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection. I welcome the setting up of\r\n\r\nthe   National   Wages  Council   with   tripartite\r\n\r\nrepresentation which will provide assistance in the\r\n\r\nformulation  of general guidelines on wage  policy,\r\n\r\nand   recommend  necessary  adjustments   in   wage\r\n\r\nstructure with a view to developing a coherent wage\r\n\r\nsystem   consistent   with  a  long-term   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, let me express the hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  Finance Minister, who has not held  this\r\n\r\nportfolio for a long period, has acquitted  himself\r\n\r\ncreditably,  and  I hope he will  be  in  the  same\r\n\r\nMinistry to present us next\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear  with  another  painless  Budget  which  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to reflect his ability to take the nation\r\n\r\nalong the highway towards economic progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto   join  my  colleagues  in  congratulating  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance for presenting  a  painless\r\n\r\nBudget.  Hence I fully endorse my support  to  the\r\n\r\nmotion moved by him on 7th March, 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I do not wish to repeat the\r\n\r\nobservations made by my colleagues nor have I  the\r\n\r\nbrilliance  or  intelligence to do  an  analytical\r\n\r\ndissertation  on  the  well  presented   financial\r\n\r\nstatement,  for  much  ground  has  already   been\r\n\r\ncovered by Members of the House. Therefore, I will\r\n\r\nconfine myself to one small observation, i.e., the\r\n\r\ninvolvement of public moneys by Government through\r\n\r\nthe  Economic  Development Board in  what  I  call\r\n\r\n\"adventurous projects\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance must be the most\r\n\r\nelated   man   in   town.  The  success   of   our\r\n\r\nGovernment's  economic  and  industrial   policies\r\n\r\ndeserve not only mere words of praise but  also  a\r\n\r\ndeeper  search  into the causes and factors  which\r\n\r\nhelped to put our economy beyond the stage of  the\r\n\r\nlaunching  pad.  Only cynics and  pessimists  will\r\n\r\nraise  doubts as to the present economic  buoyancy\r\n\r\nof the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I cannot hesitate to commend the Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Board   for  its   achievements   in\r\n\r\nattracting foreign investment into the Republic, I\r\n\r\nam  a little sceptical as to whether the Board has\r\n\r\nall  the information and, even more important, the\r\n\r\nexpertise  to  ensure  the  soundness   of   every\r\n\r\ninvestment.  I  would like to know  what  are  the\r\n\r\nfactors that guide the Board before it decides  to\r\n\r\nparticipate in some industrial ventures.  I  agree\r\n\r\nthat  direct capital involvement by the Government\r\n\r\nwould  lend  great credibility to any  project.  I\r\n\r\nhave  no  doubt  that  many  detailed  feasibility\r\n\r\nstudies  must  have  been made  to  ascertain  the\r\n\r\nviability of each project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  Sir, these  feasibility  studies\r\n\r\nhave  in some cases turned out to he nothing  more\r\n\r\nthan  speculation.  One can  no  longer  take  for\r\n\r\ngranted  that the Economic Development  Board  has\r\n\r\nthe  capacity, in terms of personnel,  to  justify\r\n\r\nits  involvement  in  joint projects  with  either\r\n\r\nforeign or local investors. Of course, one  cannot\r\n\r\nsummarily  dismiss the achievements of the  Board.\r\n\r\nBut  I believe the Government can save itself from\r\n\r\nconsiderable  embarrassment  and  pain   if   more\r\n\r\nmeticulous  studies  are  made  before  Government\r\n\r\ninvests public money in adventurous projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the situation is further aggravated by the\r\n\r\nnomination of Government representatives to  serve\r\n\r\non  the  board of directors of certain  companies.\r\n\r\nThese  representatives, their brilliance in  other\r\n\r\nfields  notwithstanding, may know next to  nothing\r\n\r\nin that particular undertaking. Sir, some Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board officials do not appear to  know\r\n\r\nthe  real  value of money. I hear many a potential\r\n\r\nforeign   investor  smacking  his  lips  when   he\r\n\r\nnegotiates terms with E.D.B, officials -  like  an\r\n\r\nagile  cat  ready  to pounce  upon  and  devour  a\r\n\r\ncanary.  I  would earnestly urge the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the  staff of the E.D.B, before  more\r\n\r\nharm befalls us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it\r\n\r\nis  customary  on Budget day for the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance    to   review   the   nation's   economic\r\n\r\nperformance.  We have been assured  that  we  have\r\n\r\ndone  well  and the common indicator  of  economic\r\n\r\nprogress, the G.N.P., has registered a 14 per cent\r\n\r\nincrease  which, by any standard, is an impressive\r\n\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, to the average man in the street,\r\n\r\nthis  means  very  little. What lie  is  basically\r\n\r\ninterested  is  whether he is  enjoying  a  better\r\n\r\nstandard  of  living today than  a  year  ago  and\r\n\r\nwhether  his take-home pay today can buy  him  the\r\n\r\nsame,  if  not  greater,  quantity  of  goods  and\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Government, I feel that in reviewing the\r\n\r\nnational  economic  progress,  we  should  not   be\r\n\r\nobsessed  by  plus  or minus in percentages  alone.\r\n\r\nSir,  we  should attempt to look behind the figures\r\n\r\nand  see whether we are a step nearer our objective\r\n\r\nof  bringing  about a more just and equal  society.\r\n\r\nHave  we  succeeded  in further  bridging  the  gap\r\n\r\nbetween  the  haves  and  the  have-nots?  Have  we\r\n\r\nsucceeded in improving our physical environment  by\r\n\r\nproviding  a  greener, cleaner and safer  place  to\r\n\r\nwork  and  to play? Have we succeeded in  providing\r\n\r\nbetter  and  equal opportunities for education  and\r\n\r\nfor  employment?  These are some of  the  pertinent\r\n\r\nquestions the average man in the street will ask in\r\n\r\ndeciding  whether,  as  a  Government,   we   have\r\n\r\neffectively  carried out what we  set  out  to  do.\r\n\r\nUnless  we  are able, as we have done  so  far,  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to give satisfactory answers not  only  in\r\n\r\nwords  but in deeds to each of these questions,  we\r\n\r\nshall  lose  the confidence and the  trust  of  the\r\n\r\npeople and whatever impressive statistics are shown\r\n\r\nwill be meaningless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this time last year the question of cost of\r\n\r\nliving   featured  predominantly  in   our   Budget\r\n\r\ndebates.  A  number of us had urged in  this  House\r\n\r\nthat  an up-to-date index of cost of living  should\r\n\r\nbe  introduced  so  as  to provide  a  rather  more\r\n\r\naccurate means to measure any ups and downs in  our\r\n\r\ncost  of  living.  It is, therefore,  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nregret  that  no action has as yet been  taken  to-date. Sir, I would like to take the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nurge   the  Minister  to  give  priority  to   this\r\n\r\nparticular  matter so that in subsequent  years  we\r\n\r\nwill be able to assess more accurately whether  our\r\n\r\nworkers have generally benefited substantially from\r\n\r\nthe  greater economic growth, or whether  they  are\r\n\r\ncaught in a wage and price spiral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, the setting up of the\r\n\r\nNational     Wages    Council    with    tripartite\r\n\r\nrepresentation  from  labour, employers  and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment is to be welcomed. And it is pleasing to\r\n\r\nnote that among other things, the determination  of\r\n\r\nequitable shares will henceforth be the concern  of\r\n\r\nthe Council. It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  to  be hoped, however, that the recommendations\r\n\r\nof  the  Wages  Council will have the whole-hearted\r\n\r\nsupport  of enlightened employers on the  one  hand\r\n\r\nand responsible union leaders on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a representative from a constituency which\r\n\r\nstill  has  a very large number of people depending\r\n\r\non  agriculture for their livelihood, 1  share  the\r\n\r\ndisappointment  of the Member for Jurong  over  the\r\n\r\nabsence of any reference to the agricultural sector\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister in his speech. In the  supporting\r\n\r\nstatistics,  it  is  shown  that  agriculture   and\r\n\r\nfishing have contributed a sum of $188.3 million to\r\n\r\nour total Gross Domestic Product as against that of\r\n\r\n$171.2  million for the preceding year, an increase\r\n\r\nof  4.3  per  cent.  Whilst the  increase  is  only\r\n\r\nmarginal and insignificant, when compared  to  that\r\n\r\nof  25.1  per cent for manufacturing and  quarrying\r\n\r\nand  that  of  22.3 per cent for construction,  the\r\n\r\ntotal sum of $188.3 million is nevertheless a  very\r\n\r\nsubstantial  amount  when  we  consider  that   the\r\n\r\ncontribution of the \"glamour-service\" industries of\r\n\r\nbanking  and  insurance  amounted  to  only  $112.6\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I appreciate that with the tremendous pace\r\n\r\nof industrial expansion and extensive urban renewal\r\n\r\nthe  pressure  upon our limited land  resources  is\r\n\r\nincreasing  day  by  day,  it  is  unrealistic  and\r\n\r\nimpractical  to  talk in terms of  a  comprehensive\r\n\r\npolicy  of agricultural development in the  context\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  It is, however, in my  opinion  not\r\n\r\nimpractical to consider bringing about some  degree\r\n\r\nof  stability  to this particular  sector  of  our\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years most of our farming\r\n\r\nfamilies  have  lived  in a state  of  uncertainty,\r\n\r\nuncertainty over price fluctuations of farm produce\r\n\r\nand    uncertainty   over   the    likelihood    of\r\n\r\nresettlement.  In so far as price  fluctuations  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, as long as there is no price control, it\r\n\r\nis  to be expected that the level of prices will be\r\n\r\ndictated  by supply and demand patterns.  But  what\r\n\r\nconcerns  me  is  that whilst  retail  prices  have\r\n\r\nremained fairly stable over\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  years according to available statistics,  the\r\n\r\nex-farm  prices,  i.e, the  prices  received   by\r\n\r\nfarmers  from  middlemen, vary quite  considerably\r\n\r\nover any one period of 12 months and often bear no\r\n\r\nrelationship to the retail prices paid by ultimate\r\n\r\nconsumers.  This is one area where  some  research\r\n\r\nshould  perhaps  be conducted so as  to  determine\r\n\r\nwhether certain measures can be taken with a  view\r\n\r\nto  providing facilities that will enable  farmers\r\n\r\nto  have  rather more direct excess  to  consumers\r\n\r\nwith resultant lesser dependence on the middlemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of resettlement, here again\r\n\r\nI  appreciate  that this only takes place  when  a\r\n\r\nparticular piece of land is urgently required  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  What I am wondering is  whether,  at\r\n\r\nthis  juncture, it is possible for us to designate\r\n\r\ncertain  areas  in  the Republic  as  agricultural\r\n\r\nareas on a fairly permanent basis. And as and when\r\n\r\nfarmers  are  affected  by development,  they  are\r\n\r\nresettled in such permanent areas without fear  of\r\n\r\nbeing   resettled   once   again   by   subsequent\r\n\r\ndevelopment  projects. This will  go  a  long  way\r\n\r\ntowards  giving greater peace of mind  to  farmers\r\n\r\nand  will also help in more comprehensive planning\r\n\r\nof  infrastructure development in  the  designated\r\n\r\nareas  concerned, As we become more urbanised  and\r\n\r\nindustrialised, there is bound to be a minority of\r\n\r\npeople who will find the pace of life too much for\r\n\r\nthem  and  will  prefer  something  resembling   a\r\n\r\npastoral  way  of life. I do sincerely  hope  that\r\n\r\nthere will still be a place for such people in our\r\n\r\nsociety to live a way of life they prefer and,  at\r\n\r\nthe same time, to contribute economically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, in supporting the motion, I would\r\n\r\nlike to thank the Minister for increasing the vote\r\n\r\nin  respect of urban and rural services under  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates to $3.25  million  for  the\r\n\r\nensuing period. This increase will mean that  more\r\n\r\nroads  and  other facilities can  be  provided  to\r\n\r\npeople living in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  rise  to support the financial policy statement\r\n\r\nmade  by the Minister for Finance in this House  a\r\n\r\nweek ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be greater emphasis placed on\r\n\r\nresearch   and  the  building  up  of   indigenous\r\n\r\ntechnological  capability, not  only  related  to\r\n\r\nhardware engineering and consultancy services  but\r\n\r\nalso,  to  further end-uses of the  raw  materials\r\n\r\nwhich   are  found  in  great  abundance  in   the\r\n\r\ncountries bordering us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1968, soon after the British announced\r\n\r\ntheir  accelerated  military withdrawal  from  our\r\n\r\nRepublic, every effort and inducement was made  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government to promote and attract industries.\r\n\r\nThey were labour-intensive industries with primary\r\n\r\nand  secondary  level skill content  to  meet  our\r\n\r\nunemployment  problems. Today it  is  a  different\r\n\r\npicture.  We  have full employment. Traditionally,\r\n\r\nSingapore has been thriving for the last 150 years\r\n\r\non its entrepot trade with the additional function\r\n\r\nof  a  transhipment and servicing centre. But this\r\n\r\nimportant  sector of the economy is  growing  less\r\n\r\nsignificant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the growing number of school-leavers coming\r\n\r\nout  each  year, our Government has  to  diversify\r\n\r\nfrom the traditional commercial and servicing role\r\n\r\nto  manufacturing, in order to absorb these  young\r\n\r\nmen and women. Therefore, for a start, we have  to\r\n\r\nestablish  labour-intensive  industries.  We  have\r\n\r\nbeen  so  successful  in  the  promotion  of   our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme that we are now placed\r\n\r\nin  a position which has compelled us to relax our\r\n\r\nimmigration laws by opening the employment gate to\r\n\r\nforeign  labour to meet the shortage of industrial\r\n\r\nlabour.  But, unfortunately, this state of affairs\r\n\r\ncannot  carry  on indefinitely. We  may  reach  an\r\n\r\nunmanageable  situation if the number  of  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  keeps on increasing. This may  wreck  the\r\n\r\nfabric  of our social order, which our Government\r\n\r\nhas taken so much planning, effort, and energy  to\r\n\r\nbuild up during the last six years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the above circumstances, it is vital\r\n\r\nand essential that we must give careful thought to\r\n\r\nwhich direction our next step will be, and in what\r\n\r\nkinds  of  industry we should concentrate  on.  We\r\n\r\nhave  limited  manpower, but we have  intelligent,\r\n\r\neducated, disciplined and adaptable workers. If we\r\n\r\nlook  around the countries in Asia, we can emulate\r\n\r\nthe second greatest industrial nation in the world\r\n\r\n-----  Japan.  She has no iron ore, bauxite,  coal\r\n\r\nor   oil,  and  yet  today  she  is  the  greatest\r\n\r\nshipbuilding and car manufacturing nation  in  the\r\n\r\nworld,  owing  to the industry and resourcefulness\r\n\r\nof  her people who are, at the same time, creators\r\n\r\nand   innovators   of  science   and   technology.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  on a smaller scale, our  Republic  can\r\n\r\nfollow the excellent example of Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan gets her iron ore from Australia and oil\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Middle East, and these sources  of  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials  are  thousands of miles away  from  her\r\n\r\nhome  country. We are more fortunately placed, as\r\n\r\nwe  are  right in the centre of one of the richest\r\n\r\nregions in the world waiting to be developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia and Malaysia produce rubber, tin,\r\n\r\ntimber,  and  many other natural resources,  which\r\n\r\nare  raw  materials  for manufactured  goods  like\r\n\r\nrubber   tyres, shoes,   waterproof   raincoats,\r\n\r\nplywood,  veneer, etc. Indonesia,  which  is  less\r\n\r\nthan 30 miles away from us, is now one of the  top\r\n\r\nfive oil producing countries in the world. She  is\r\n\r\nalso   rich  in  minerals.  Therefore,  all  these\r\n\r\ncountries  are  potential manufacturers  of  goods\r\n\r\nwhich are now being imported. Our neighbours  send\r\n\r\ntheir  raw  materials to industrial nations,  like\r\n\r\nJapan  and  the E.E.C, countries which manufacture\r\n\r\nthem  into  finished goods, and imported  back  to\r\n\r\ntheir own countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our country, being so strategically placed, can\r\n\r\nplay  an important role as innovators and creators\r\n\r\nfor   new   industries   for  these   neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries   in  the  region,  if  our   engineers,\r\n\r\nscientists and technicians will devote their  time\r\n\r\nand energy in doing research into the uses\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof these raw materials. After successfully getting\r\n\r\nthe  know-how and expertise of turning  them  into\r\n\r\nnew  useful products, we can pass on our knowledge\r\n\r\nto  our neighbours and establish industries  right\r\n\r\non  the spot where the raw materials are obtained,\r\n\r\nthus  cutting  down the cost of freight,  handling\r\n\r\ncharges,  insurance,  etc. In  this  way,  by  co-operation  in our skilled manpower, expertise  and\r\n\r\nfinance,  and establishing cross-national ventures\r\n\r\nwith  our  neighbouring countries, the concept  of\r\n\r\nregional co-operation would soon become a fact. At\r\n\r\nthe  same time, it will create trust and establish\r\n\r\na  better  friendly relationship between  all  the\r\n\r\ncountries  in the region for their collective  and\r\n\r\nmutual benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now come to another\r\n\r\nsubject.  The  Member for Bukit Ho Swee  has  been\r\n\r\nvery articulate about the high cost of living  and\r\n\r\nthe  restraint  on workers' wages because  of  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act.  As an employer,  I  am  in  full\r\n\r\nsympathy with the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some measures must be seriously considered by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  improve the  earnings  of  workers\r\n\r\nwithout   creating  an  inflationary  trend.   The\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  the National Wages  Council  is\r\n\r\nmost   timely,  and  1  hope  that  some  remedial\r\n\r\nmeasures may result from the deliberations of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil.  At the same time, it must also be  borne\r\n\r\nin mind that without stability in wage rates and a\r\n\r\ndisciplined  labour force, foreign investors  will\r\n\r\nthink  twice before coming to our shores.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  the  minor boom  prevailing  in  all\r\n\r\nsectors  of the economy have been largely  due  to\r\n\r\nthe  efforts  and cooperation of our  hard-working\r\n\r\nand  disciplined  workers  and  responsible  trade\r\n\r\nunions.  To  prevent  an inflationary  trend,  any\r\n\r\nspiralling increase in wages due to union  demands\r\n\r\nwill  create  a situation where productivity  will\r\n\r\nnot in the long run catch up with the increase  in\r\n\r\nwage  rates. It will be a vicious circle and  will\r\n\r\naffect  the workers most, due to the high cost  of\r\n\r\nliving caused by inflation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As pointed out by the Member for Bukit Ho Swee,\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecently  announced the granting  of  one  month's\r\n\r\nextra  pay to all Government servants. The private\r\n\r\nsector  should respond to the clarion call of  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister. I have a proposal  to  make,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  to give a high cost of living  allowance\r\n\r\nequivalent to 10 per cent of the basic pay to  all\r\n\r\nworkers drawing less than a total remuneration  of\r\n\r\n$750  per month. The workers in this wage  bracket\r\n\r\nform  the majority of our working population,  and\r\n\r\nthey  are  affected  most by the  rising  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that Members who are concerned with\r\n\r\ntrade  unions will sound a word of caution to  all\r\n\r\nworkers  to be patient, and to play their part  in\r\n\r\nthe  long-term interest of the nation. I  am  sure\r\n\r\nthat  with  their understanding and  co-operation,\r\n\r\nthe   Republic  will  reach  greater  heights   of\r\n\r\nprosperity in the l970s, which in turn will mean a\r\n\r\nhigher standard of living for everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on that note, I beg to support\r\n\r\nthe financial policy of the Finance Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I am grateful to Members  for  the\r\n\r\nmany  congratulatory  and  approving  remarks   of\r\n\r\nMembers on the financial policy which I dealt with\r\n\r\nin  my policy statement. As the Minister in charge\r\n\r\nof  financial policy, it was my privilege and good\r\n\r\nfortune  to  be  able to present an annual  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement   which  was  entirely   painless,   and\r\n\r\ntherefore  received  the  approval  of   so   many\r\n\r\nMembers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I hasten to disclaim any credit solely for\r\n\r\nthis result, it is quite obviously impossible  for\r\n\r\nany one man, except as a member of a team, to have\r\n\r\nachieved  this result, which has been the  product\r\n\r\nof  a  sustained effort over many years by  people\r\n\r\nfrom  the top leadership of the Government to  the\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament, to the party  and,  above\r\n\r\nall,  as I said in my annual Budget Statement,  to\r\n\r\nthe  workers of all classes and occupations. Apart\r\n\r\nfrom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  remarks,  I would like to say  how  much  I\r\n\r\nappreciate  the many suggestions and  constructive\r\n\r\ncriticisms  I  have  heard today.  They  are  most\r\n\r\nvaluable  and  I  propose  to  give  very  careful\r\n\r\nconsideration when I have the time to  study  them\r\n\r\nin  Hansard. I say so, because many speeches  were\r\n\r\nmade,  some for the first time in a new  language,\r\n\r\nand  there  may  be  some loss in  interpretation.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if I deal with these remarks in  a  way\r\n\r\nwhich  shows some lack of comprehension, I ask  to\r\n\r\nbe  excused.  The  remarks, of course,  vary  very\r\n\r\nconsiderably.   For  example,   the   Member   for\r\n\r\nSerangoon   Gardens  remarked  that  he  obviously\r\n\r\nthought  that  my  Budget  Statement  suited   the\r\n\r\nresidents  of Serangoon Gardens very well  because\r\n\r\nof  the  tax reliefs. On the other hand, my Budget\r\n\r\nStatement was perhaps not quite as welcomed by the\r\n\r\nMember for Jurong, whose problems are farmers, and\r\n\r\nagriculture,  and  fisheries, and  also  by  other\r\n\r\nMembers concerned with adult education. And  there\r\n\r\nwere  also views with a mixture of both  good  and\r\n\r\nbad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard a number of suggestions for further\r\n\r\ntax  reliefs, but while I am prepared to  consider\r\n\r\nthem  for  further  painless budgets.  I  think  I\r\n\r\nshould  say  right  now  that  it  will  be  quite\r\n\r\nimpossible  to  exempt all workers  from  taxation\r\n\r\nmeasures;  if  the definition of \"workers\"  ranges\r\n\r\nfrom  those who are now already exempted from  tax\r\n\r\nto  those  who, as in my definition of workers  in\r\n\r\nall  classes  and occupations, are not  only  just\r\n\r\nmanual  workers  but  also  those  who  use  their\r\n\r\nbrains.  There were some suggestions  for  reliefs\r\n\r\nfor   maintenance  of  parents,  and  others   for\r\n\r\nexpenditure on quality-control equipment.  On  the\r\n\r\nlatter,  there is already a provision in  the  law\r\n\r\nwhereby  accelerated depreciation can  be  allowed\r\n\r\nfor  approved equipment, particularly for research\r\n\r\nand development and methods related to science and\r\n\r\ntechnology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the suggestion from the Member for\r\n\r\nTelok Blangah regarding relief to poor people  who\r\n\r\nuse  electric fans, and are thereby charged  at  a\r\n\r\nhigh rate of electricity for lighting as against\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncheap  domestic power. I believe this matter  will\r\n\r\nbe  resolved  by the Public Utilities  Board  when\r\n\r\nthey adopt a new tariff system in which the supply\r\n\r\nof  both power and lighting will be calibrated  by\r\n\r\nthe  same meter. Consumers will then have  to  pay\r\n\r\nthe same rate for both electricity and power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Will it cost more or less?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> From what I have gathered, it\r\n\r\nwill  cost  the small consumer slightly less.  But\r\n\r\nthis matter is still under examination because  of\r\n\r\nits  effect upon industry. Nevertheless, I believe\r\n\r\na decision will be taken fairly soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to deal with some of the other\r\n\r\ncomments  under  various subject heads.  First  of\r\n\r\nall, I welcome the exhortations which many Members\r\n\r\nhave made regarding the necessity for hard work. I\r\n\r\nthank  the  Members  for Telok Blangah,  Serangoon\r\n\r\nGardens, Sembawang, and River Valley among  others\r\n\r\nfor  bringing this to the attention of workers  in\r\n\r\nall  classes  and  occupations.  The  comments  on\r\n\r\nworkers were made under the various subject  heads\r\n\r\nlike  the National Wages Council. I think quite  a\r\n\r\nnumber of Members touched on this. The Member  for\r\n\r\nMoulmein  stated  that  I  had  not  stressed  the\r\n\r\nimportance of this Council in my Budget Statement.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I thought I had mentioned that this  was\r\n\r\none  of the strategic objectives for the next  10-year  Development Plan. It is one of  the  two  or\r\n\r\nthree most important objectives, and I have placed\r\n\r\ngreat  emphasis on the importance of the  National\r\n\r\nWages  Council, and the deliberations  which  they\r\n\r\nare  going  to make over the next few months.  But\r\n\r\ntheir  first recommendations are important because\r\n\r\nthey  will  set the tone for the whole Council.  I\r\n\r\nhave no doubt that they will pay attention to what\r\n\r\nall  the Members have said in this House and  will\r\n\r\ncertainly consider the four main points which  the\r\n\r\nMember for Moulmein has brought up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Bukit Ho Swee, I have no\r\n\r\ndoubt that the Wages\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCouncil will consider his views in greater detail.\r\n\r\nThe  views on bonuses, fringe benefits, and so on,\r\n\r\nare, really a matter for the Wages Council, and  I\r\n\r\ndo    not   want   to   anticipate   what    their\r\n\r\nrecommendations  will be by saying  anything  here\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some mention of closing the income gap\r\n\r\nbetween the haves and the have-nots. I do not know\r\n\r\nwhether this classification is meaningful  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext   of  Singapore,  where  there  is   great\r\n\r\nmobility  so  that the present-day have-nots  very\r\n\r\nsoon  get into the position where they become  the\r\n\r\nhaves.  Therefore,  what we all  want  is  a  more\r\n\r\negalitarian  society.  At the  same  time,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  stress that rewards  should  go  to\r\n\r\nthose  who  make the effort and not to  those  who\r\n\r\nmerely  think that just because all men are equal,\r\n\r\nthey  should also have a share of the reward.  The\r\n\r\nprinciple  is  that there should be equal  rewards\r\n\r\nfor equal effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great number of Members welcome the annual\r\n\r\nallowance,  or  the 13th payment, which  has  been\r\n\r\nintroduced  by  Government, I have no  doubt  this\r\n\r\nwill  be  taken as a guide for the private  sector\r\n\r\nand will to some extent determine the attitudes to\r\n\r\nbe  taken  as  to whether or not bonus  should  be\r\n\r\npayable.  On the Government side, it is felt  that\r\n\r\nthis  13th payment is necessary in order that some\r\n\r\nextra  funds  will be available  for  the  festive\r\n\r\nseasons,   like  Christmas  and  the   New   Year.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this lump sum payment is very  welcome.\r\n\r\nWhatever  the  decision is as to  whether  or  not\r\n\r\nbonuses  should be paid, I think this 13th payment\r\n\r\nis likely to be welcomed by all parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Wages Council, I need only say that what\r\n\r\nwe  want  to achieve is an orderly and progressive\r\n\r\nincrease in workers' remuneration, in the interest\r\n\r\nof  all parties concerned. The need for industrial\r\n\r\npeace  is  not less important because  of  evident\r\n\r\neconomic  development; rather, we must expect  all\r\n\r\nto  try  their hardest to progress further and  to\r\n\r\nachieve  the  same growth rate  for  the  next  10\r\n\r\nyears.  I  hope the Member for Bukit Ho Swee  will\r\n\r\nnot disagree\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  me  if I say that the tripartite partnership\r\n\r\nbetween  Government,  management  and  labour,  is\r\n\r\nreally  what  we  want to achieve.  It  is  not  a\r\n\r\nconfrontation   we   want   between   labour   and\r\n\r\nmanagement, with Government as a referee,  in  the\r\n\r\nWages Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a number of suggestions on industrial\r\n\r\nsafety,  productivity  and  the  introduction   of\r\n\r\nquality control, in order that workers can improve\r\n\r\non the quality of their products thereby obtaining\r\n\r\na  share  of  the greater profits derived  from  a\r\n\r\nbetter  sale  of these products,  I  am  sure  all\r\n\r\nMembers  will support the suggestions  which  have\r\n\r\nbeen made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A broad range of remarks was related to the\r\n\r\nsocial   adjustments  which  are  likely   to   be\r\n\r\nnecessary in this period of rapid economic  growth\r\n\r\nthat  is  expected for this decade. I welcome  the\r\n\r\ncomments made on the need to make wage adjustments\r\n\r\nso that we have a more egalitarian society. I also\r\n\r\nwelcome  the  remarks on the  improvement  in  the\r\n\r\nquality of life as we go up the economic scale.  I\r\n\r\ndo not necessarily subscribe to the idea suggested\r\n\r\nby  one Member that the economic progress that  we\r\n\r\nare  likely  to  achieve will bring  with  it  the\r\n\r\ndegenerative and corrosive aspects we see  in  the\r\n\r\nWest. These are not necessarily the by-products of\r\n\r\naffluence. If we have regard for the cultural  and\r\n\r\ntraditional  values of the East, I have  no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat we can, by special efforts\r\n\r\n--  and  no  doubt the guiding efforts too  of  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues,  the  Ministers for Home  Affairs  and\r\n\r\nCulture  prevent a decay setting in  our  society,\r\n\r\nsuch as has been experienced in some countries  in\r\n\r\nthe West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also the suggestion by the Member for\r\n\r\nKampong  Kapor that we should try and get more  of\r\n\r\nour  women to work in industry and trade. I  think\r\n\r\nthis is an excellent suggestion. The percentage of\r\n\r\nour  women in our present work-force is rather low\r\n\r\nas compared with some of the industrially advanced\r\n\r\ncountries. The present shortage of labour  can  be\r\n\r\nvery quickly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  easily met if we can increase the  number  of\r\n\r\nour  women who are prepared to work for a  living.\r\n\r\nThis,  of  course,  brings with it  the  attendant\r\n\r\nproblem of providing cr\ufffdches where children can be\r\n\r\ntaken care of while their mothers go to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with another topic which is\r\n\r\napparent  in many comments, i.e., the  problem  of\r\n\r\nprice  increases, which the Members for  Moulmein,\r\n\r\nPotong Pasir, Jurong, Anson, Jalan Kayu, and a few\r\n\r\nothers dwelt upon. With regard to the necessity of\r\n\r\nkeeping  prices down, I should like  to  say  that\r\n\r\nthis question is always uppermost in our minds.  I\r\n\r\nwelcome  the NTUC's initiatives which resulted  in\r\n\r\nthe setting up of CASE, and their consideration of\r\n\r\nforming a Consumers' Co-operative. There seems  to\r\n\r\nbe  a misconception on the part of the Member  for\r\n\r\nJalan  Kayu  that  nothing has been  done  to-date\r\n\r\nabout producing a cost of living index, which will\r\n\r\nbe  considered more satisfactory than the  present\r\n\r\nindex.  The  position is that we  have  started  a\r\n\r\nhousehold expenditure survey, and an index will be\r\n\r\nready  in  course  of time. This  is  because  the\r\n\r\nsurvey  requires  fairly detailed book-keeping  by\r\n\r\nhousewives  who  are invited to help,  and  it  is\r\n\r\nhoped  to be completed by the time the next Budget\r\n\r\nStatement  is made in this House. In the meantime,\r\n\r\nwe  will,  do whatever we can to try and stabilise\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of  living. However, it is  not  always\r\n\r\npossible  to  keep prices down.  If  we  take  the\r\n\r\ninternational  price of sugar as an  example,  our\r\n\r\nhousewives  will have to pay perhaps a price  very\r\n\r\nmuch  higher  than the controlled price  which  we\r\n\r\nhave imposed on our local sugar refineries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another series of remarks were related to\r\n\r\nimmigration    problems.   The    relaxation    of\r\n\r\nimmigration laws brings with it certain  problems.\r\n\r\nWe  should  realise  that if  we  allow  unmarried\r\n\r\nworkers  to  immigrate into  Singapore,  there  is\r\n\r\nbound   to  be  some  social  tension.  But  these\r\n\r\nproblems will have to be dealt with as they arise.\r\n\r\nThere are also difficulties in deciding who are to\r\n\r\nbe allowed in, e.g., whether the foreign musicians\r\n\r\nare\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  aesthetic  grounds better or only  as  good  as\r\n\r\nthose  we have locally. This is very much a  matter\r\n\r\nof  taste. I do not claim to be capable of  judging\r\n\r\nthe  respective merits of those musicians who  make\r\n\r\nsuch  a  lot  of noise in our night spots!  if  the\r\n\r\ncriterion is merely how loud you can play, then  it\r\n\r\nis subject to scientific determination. However,  I\r\n\r\nam reliably told that other values are involved.  I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest  that  if our  local  musicians  are\r\n\r\nreally better than foreign ones who are now allowed\r\n\r\nto  come  in large numbers, then it should soon  be\r\n\r\nevident  to all those who are in the business  that\r\n\r\nin  the end the foreign musicians will, because  of\r\n\r\nthe  high  cost of importation, have to lose  their\r\n\r\nplaces to our local boys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there were some remarks on the various\r\n\r\nMinistries. I do not claim to be able to answer for\r\n\r\nall  of them, hut perhaps I can start by commenting\r\n\r\non  the remarks made on matters within my Ministry.\r\n\r\nA  number  of  Members have touched on  tourism  in\r\n\r\ntheir  speeches. I am grateful to  them  for  their\r\n\r\nsuggestions  for its improvement.  I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\nTourist  Promotion  Board will  take  note  of  the\r\n\r\nexhortations made by the various Members in  regard\r\n\r\nto the Board's effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a few remarks which. I think, were not\r\n\r\nperhaps  quite justified. One was the  question  of\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers  raised by the Member for  Katong.  I\r\n\r\nthink  he  spoke  of  taxi drivers  mulcting  their\r\n\r\nfares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I qualified it by saying \"a\r\n\r\nminority of them\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> In fact, I was going to defend\r\n\r\nthem  by mentioning the reports in the Press  about\r\n\r\ntaxi drivers who had been very honest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> There are more taxi drivers who\r\n\r\nare a credit to Singapore than those who are not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I mentioned that too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> You did? Thank you. There was\r\n\r\nsome  mention about hotel rates being  high.  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  I  do  not  quite follow  the  argument.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that if Members are in-the-know about these\r\n\r\nthings  and  are prepared to ask for rebates,  they\r\n\r\nwill find that our hotel rates can be extremely low\r\n\r\nby   international   standards.   They   are   very\r\n\r\nreasonable.  In fact, the occupancy rate  has  gone\r\n\r\ndown. One Member wondered why the occupancy rate is\r\n\r\nin  reverse  proportion to the number  of  tourists\r\n\r\ncoming  in.  The answer is very simple.  There  are\r\n\r\nmore  rooms than the required proportion  to  cater\r\n\r\nfor the number of tourists coming in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another suggestion that the prices in\r\n\r\nsome of the coffee houses are rather exorbitant.  I\r\n\r\nam  a  bit puzzled by this because, although I have\r\n\r\nalso  read  the same letter in the press concerning\r\n\r\nthis  matter, I believe that quite a number of  our\r\n\r\nyoung boys and girls now make it a custom to go  to\r\n\r\nthese  coffee houses. I cannot understand how  they\r\n\r\ncan   afford  it  if  the  prices  are  very  high.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  this is a matter which  the  Tourist\r\n\r\nPromotion Board may well consider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now go on to the Economic Development\r\n\r\nBoard,   A  very  serious  criticism  against   the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Development Board was made by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Changi, although he did praise its efforts  at\r\n\r\neconomic promotion. He said that they had gone into\r\n\r\nrisky  ventures, and he took exception to  this.  I\r\n\r\nshould  like  to inform him that the E.D.B, itself\r\n\r\ndoes  not  participate in industrial  ventures  any\r\n\r\nlonger. Therefore, I cannot understand his remarks.\r\n\r\nTheir  efforts  are  now  confined  solely  to  the\r\n\r\npromotion  of industrial ventures, while industries\r\n\r\nare  being  financed  by the  Development  Bank  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. The feasibility studies which the E.D.B.\r\n\r\nmake  are  usually for the benefit of entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nso  that they will be encouraged to investigate  in\r\n\r\nfurther detail the various projects that have  been\r\n\r\nstudied.  I  do not think the E.D.B, can  guarantee\r\n\r\nthat any feasibility studies they make will ensure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   anyone   investing  in  the  projects   will\r\n\r\ncertainly  make  money. But  if  his  criticism  is\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Government going into these  ventures\r\n\r\nand  against the competence of our officers in  the\r\n\r\nBoards  of Directors, I should like to say that  in\r\n\r\nsome  of  these ventures the directors have  proved\r\n\r\nthat,  even if the Member considers them  not  very\r\n\r\ncapable,  they  would  at least  be  able  to  make\r\n\r\nprofits  for  the  owner, that is, the  Government.\r\n\r\nThese   profits  are  particularly  good   in   the\r\n\r\nshipyards  that  we  own. I think  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nChangi should know whether this is an industry that\r\n\r\nrequires particular skill in management.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa suggested that we should\r\n\r\nconsider  setting up a secondary Stock Exchange  to\r\n\r\ndeal with shares of ventures which are rather risky\r\n\r\nand  do  not qualify for listing under the  present\r\n\r\nStock  Exchange  Regulations. I am rather  hesitant\r\n\r\nabout  this suggestion. I do not think we  want  to\r\n\r\nencourage our shareholders, who are perhaps not  so\r\n\r\nwell informed about shares, to place their money in\r\n\r\nsuch ventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Merah welcomed the intention\r\n\r\nof the Ministry of Finance to mechanise the various\r\n\r\nGovernment  Ministries  and  departments.  I   will\r\n\r\ncertainly press on with this mechanisation. He  has\r\n\r\nalso  mentioned manufacturing industries,  and  has\r\n\r\nmade a number of suggestions in, for instance,  the\r\n\r\nelectronics,  ship  building  and  ship   repairing\r\n\r\nindustries. He has also made various other  remarks\r\n\r\non  trade  and  tourism. I  have  noted  all  these\r\n\r\nremarks and will give them consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also noted the remarks of the Member for\r\n\r\nRiver   Valley   on   the  development   of   local\r\n\r\ntechnology.  His remarks strike a very  sympathetic\r\n\r\nchord.  It  may  be because I was involved  in  the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of the Industrial Research Unit  which\r\n\r\nhas   now   become  the  Singapore  Institute   for\r\n\r\nStandards and Industrial Research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now deal with the suggestions made about\r\n\r\nthe various Ministries. As I have said, I can do so\r\n\r\nonly on a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery general basis because I am not responsible for\r\n\r\nthem.  The Member for Paya Lebar has said  that  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  education, the  pendulum  has  perhaps\r\n\r\nswung   too  far  in  the  direction  of  technical\r\n\r\neducation.  I myself do not think so, in  fact,  we\r\n\r\ncould  do  with  a  lot  more technical  education.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  accept  the point which  he  no  doubt\r\n\r\nwanted to make, and that is, that in our pursuit of\r\n\r\nscience  and technology, we should not  forget  the\r\n\r\nneed  for a knowledge of the humanities and of  the\r\n\r\nsocial sciences, particularly those which deal with\r\n\r\npolitical  as  well as social leadership.  I  think\r\n\r\namong the many tasks which this Government has been\r\n\r\nfaced,  the  most difficult one - it  may  be  more\r\n\r\ndifficult than promoting a G.N.P, growth rate of 15\r\n\r\nper cent per annum is the promotion of a spirit  of\r\n\r\nnational  consciousness, a sense of  identity  with\r\n\r\nthe country. If we can inculcate this spirit in our\r\n\r\npeople, then many of the other tasks which we  have\r\n\r\nset ourselves will be made that much easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also listened with great sympathy to the\r\n\r\nMember for Jurong's very eloquent address in favour\r\n\r\nof  agriculture and fisheries. The Member for Jalan\r\n\r\nKayu  has  given his wholehearted support  to  this\r\n\r\nmatter.  I  can only say that, although I  did  not\r\n\r\nmake   mention  of  this  subject  in   my   Budget\r\n\r\nStatement,  I am fully conscious that  we  must  do\r\n\r\nwhat   we   can  to  promote  the  development   of\r\n\r\nagriculture and fisheries, as we will have to  keep\r\n\r\nall  our  economic sectors as viable  as  possible.\r\n\r\nHowever, in  the context of Singapore, agriculture\r\n\r\nmust  be of an intensive nature. We simply  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  enough land for the kind of farming  that  is\r\n\r\nvery  extensive and which is in evidence  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong also spoke of our limited\r\n\r\n33,000  acres of agricultural land and about 23,000\r\n\r\nfamilies  who are dependent on farming and fishing.\r\n\r\nOur  agricultural farming must be of the kind which\r\n\r\nproduces  leafy vegetables. We have never  produced\r\n\r\nrice  and Singapore cannot produce any rice. I hope\r\n\r\nthat we would never have to attempt to produce  any\r\n\r\nof the staple commodities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, we have given every encouragement to  the\r\n\r\nways  in  which Singapore can be most  productive.\r\n\r\nThis  is  animal  husbandry,  concerned  with  the\r\n\r\nproduction   of  pigs  and  also  with  industrial\r\n\r\nmethods  of  rearing poultry, i.e., if  you  start\r\n\r\nwith an egg at the top of an industrial or flatted-farm  building,  it should after going  through  a\r\n\r\nspiral  come  out at the end as a  chicken!  These\r\n\r\nprojects  in  animal husbandry,  egg  and  poultry\r\n\r\nproduction,  have pushed its contribution  to  the\r\n\r\nG.D.P, to the very high value, as has been quoted\r\n\r\nby the Member for Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also made a plea for the setting up of an\r\n\r\nagricultural bank, and was very aggrieved that  in\r\n\r\nspite  of having made this suggestion a year  ago,\r\n\r\nthe  matter has not been taken up. I am  afraid  I\r\n\r\nmust  keep on disappointing him because I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  there  is  enough business  to  justify  an\r\n\r\nagricultural bank in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the financing of fisheries, the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Bank  of  Singapore  has  already   a\r\n\r\ndivision of at least several officers to deal with\r\n\r\nloans  to  fishing fleets. Again,  the  amount  of\r\n\r\nbusiness  which they have been able to do  is  not\r\n\r\nvery large. I would suggest to the Member that the\r\n\r\nbest hope for financing is though the Ministry  or\r\n\r\nthe  department concerned with the extension  work\r\n\r\nof  supplying poultry or pigs to the  farmers  for\r\n\r\nrearing. The other method would be by fostering co-operatives, which was also mentioned by him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to fisheries, as pointed out by the\r\n\r\nMember for Jurong, it is true that we produce very\r\n\r\nlittle for our own consumption. As Chairman of the\r\n\r\nEconomic Development Board for a number of  years,\r\n\r\nI  tried to foster deep-sea fishing projects,  but\r\n\r\ndid  not  quite succeed. It does seem  as  if  our\r\n\r\nyoung boys are so accustomed to urban living  that\r\n\r\nthey are unprepared to go for long periods out  to\r\n\r\nsea  to catch fish. The various efforts which have\r\n\r\nbeen  made have not been quite successful. If  our\r\n\r\nlocal  boys and local entrepreneurs have any  real\r\n\r\ninterest  in deep-sea fishing, I think they  would\r\n\r\nget  great  encouragement from both the Government\r\n\r\nand the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment Bank of Singapore. And I am sure  that\r\n\r\nour  Marine Police and other departments will  try\r\n\r\nand  protect our fishermen wherever they can  from\r\n\r\nbeing  arrested,  unless  they  stray  into  other\r\n\r\nterritorial waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu mentioned the\r\n\r\nresettlement of farmers. He seems to consider that\r\n\r\nthe   Government  should,  as  far  as   possible.\r\n\r\nresettle  our  farmers  in permanent  areas  which\r\n\r\nwould  be  kept  for that purpose.  That  is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult in the circumstances of the very limited\r\n\r\nland  available.  Various  Government  departments\r\n\r\nthemselves have had in the past to be resettled in\r\n\r\nfavour of other Ministries. I  remember that  when\r\n\r\nJurong  was being established and we were  pushing\r\n\r\nwestwards,  all of a sudden a few,  hundred  acres\r\n\r\nof  land  were suddenly lopped off for the Defence\r\n\r\nMinistry from the Master Plan for Jurong Town, and\r\n\r\nall  our plans had to come to a dead halt.  If  it\r\n\r\nwas  not  possible in the old days for either  the\r\n\r\nJurong Town Corporation or the E.D.B, to safeguard\r\n\r\ntheir lands, it is very doubtful that the needs of\r\n\r\nfarmers   can   over-ride  those  more   important\r\n\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now come to ports. It was said that T\r\n\r\nhad  not mentioned anywhere in my Budget Statement\r\n\r\nthe progress of our container port. The Member for\r\n\r\nAnson is obviously very interested in this. But  I\r\n\r\nam  riot responsible for ports other than to  make\r\n\r\nfinancial  provision  for it  in  the  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates. However, I am sure that with a vigorous\r\n\r\nChairman  at  the  head of the Port  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority, its development is not lagging. At  the\r\n\r\nlast  World  Bank meeting, we certainly registered\r\n\r\nour  interest  in financing for this subject  with\r\n\r\nthe World Bank directors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One or two Members mentioned the Far East Freight\r\n\r\nConference and the treatment given to the  Neptune\r\n\r\nOrient  Lines.  I do not wish to say  anything  at\r\n\r\nthis  stage about the Far East Freight Conference,\r\n\r\nand  the Neptune Orient lines' claim for a greater\r\n\r\nshare in the cargo trade. I would merely say  that\r\n\r\nfor  some  of the shipping lines in the Conference\r\n\r\nto  make  claims  on our cargo  trade  because  of\r\n\r\nhistorical grounds is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreally  to invite a reply on a political basis.  It\r\n\r\ncertainly smacks of colonialism to speak  of  their\r\n\r\ntraditional right to the cargo trade of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong suggested that it is\r\n\r\ndesirable  to  aim at a higher rate of  growth  for\r\n\r\npublic housing, especially when urban renewal sites\r\n\r\nare  not  being let out for further development.  I\r\n\r\ncan   assure   the  Member  that   any   slack   in\r\n\r\nconstruction activity will certainly be taken up as\r\n\r\na matter of priority for public housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful for the tribute which has been paid\r\n\r\nto  the Parks and Trees Division.
