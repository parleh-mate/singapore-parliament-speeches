Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. \n  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Prime Minister if he will recommend to the President the appointment of a Commission with all necessary terms of reference to inquire fully into the loss of monies belonging to members of Trade Unions between the years 1975 and 1979 and to report in as full a manner as is possible in all the circumstances inter alia on (i) the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> total of all monies lost; (ii) the manner in which or how the monies were taken or lost; (iii) whether all recognized accounting practices and audit procedures had been followed in the keeping of the accounts; (iv) whether any officers in the member Trade Unions or the National Trades Union Congress should be held accountable for the loss/defalcation because of any failure on their part to take corrective measures to prevent any loss of monies and if so what action should be taken against them; and (v) the circumstances in which the former President of the N.T.U.C. Mr Phey Yew Kok was \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> enabled to leave the country after he had been charged in the courts. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot recommend to the President the approval of a Commission to inquire into the matters set out in the question. It is a long question, with five limbs. They cover the six charges standing against Phey Yew Kok in the Criminal District Court - four for criminal breach of trust and two for contravention of the Trade Unions Act. There is a warrant out for his arrest for not answering to bail. I find it difficult to believe that as a lawyer, the Member for Anson is ignorant of the legal improprieties implicit in his suggestion that a Commission of Inquiry to investigate matters which, inter alia, must form part of the evidence on which these charges will rest. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as there are reasonable prospects of bringing Phey Yew Kok to trial, nothing should be done which can be said to jeopardise the process of law. The Member for Anson is inviting me to investigate the facts, or to appoint a Commission to investigate the facts, of a criminal case which is sub judice when, in his own civil suit, pending on appeal to the Privy Council, he took immediate objection to a completely neutral reference I made in this House to the implications of the outcome for him, without touching on the merits of his appeal. However, not to be the Government's own legal officer, I asked for the opinion of the Attorney-General. In a written opinion, he has advised against the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry. I have made copies (Cols. 465 - 472) and handed them to the Clerk of Parliament for circulation to Honourable Members. \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1982/19820303/19820303-HA-0410465.htm\">copies - OPINION (Cols. 465 - 472)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding this, I can state that investigations made by the CPIB disclose that altogether $698,862.68 of monies belonging to SILO, PIEU and the NTUC Travel Services (Pte) Ltd, are unaccounted for. These investigations are not closed. I must add that there were no allegations, nor is there any evidence, of missing or unaccounted funds in the NTUC. There \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> were CBT offences committed on monies belonging to the NTUC Travel Services (Pte) Ltd. This is a private limited company, totally separate from the NTUC. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the CPIB investigations, ten other persons besides Phey Yew Kok were charged - nine convicted, one acquitted. I have made out a list of these persons, marked Annex 2, (Cols. 473 - 480) and handed it to the Clerk for Honourable Members. From the list, Members will see that three were officers of the trade unions SILO/PIEU, three were employees of SILO Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society Ltd, one the general manager of NTUC Travel Services (Pte) Ltd, one a public accountant (No. 10 in Annex 2), and one a Director of Savewell Supermarket (Pte) Ltd (No. 4 in Annex 2). Their charges, brief facts and the results are as set out in Annex 2. One (No. 3 in Annex 2) was acquitted. One (No. 11 in Annex 2) had been dealt with internally by PIEU and dismissed on 10th January 1978. The Attorney-General had advised against prosecution in Case No. 11. Annex 2 (Cols. 473 - 480) \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As monies misappropriated have been traced and found to have been used as part of the purchase price of a house at 53B Lorong Ong Lye, now in the name of Madam Wong Chui Ping (Mrs Phey Yew Kok), a caveat has been entered against this property. Briefly, no wrong-doing has been covered-up, nor has any wrong-doer been let-off, as the question has sought to imply. If the Member for Anson wants to, there can be an inquiry on whether there has been a cover-up. But the inquiry cannot cover the evidence on which the charges against Phey Yew Kok are founded. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Home Affairs will provide the answer in Question No. 10 on what happened to Phey Yew Kok. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indebted to the Prime Minister for the lengthy statement.

That is my experience in the courts. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> We are asked now to get the Attorney-General to withdraw the charges not amounting to an acquittal.

In other words, the Member for Anson, in putting his question which is really to create a smear that there has been a cover-up, knew that he was suggesting something improper and had come prepared for an answer that this was being thwarted because it is sub judice, and therefore he proposes that we withdraw the charge; warrant will lapse; commission of inquiry is held, Phey Yew Kok's trial in effect is held by the commission of inquiry; all the issues involved are prejudged; the commission reports, charges are then reintroduced; warrants for arrest are reissued.

I would ask the Prime Minister not to impute too readily motives to the Opposition Member. The terms of inquiry of the commission can be drafted in such a way as to exclude any inquiry as to the guilt or otherwise of Mr Phey Yew Kok. The inquiry can be directed as to how - I have set out some of the matters on which the inquiry can be conducted, and that is whether accounting and correct accounting and audit practices, procedures, had been followed and whether anybody else was aware of the manner in which these moneys were being taken from the amounts held by these unions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> The commission of inquiry was supposed to have terms of reference which would cover the question set out: to report in as full a manner as possible in all the circumstances, interalia, on (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v).

It must cover the grounds on which the evidence against Phey Yew Kok rest, including the system by which he siphoned off the money. How can we have this elaborate deception of withdrawing the charge, allowing the warrants for arrest to lapse, have a Commission of Inquiry, find out how it was that monies were siphoned off, and then re-institute the charges? If the Member for Anson \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> wants Mr Phey Yew Kok to have a good defence, that is exactly what he would do.

I am prepared to have such a commission without touching the evidence against Phey Yew Kok because such an inquiry will be a credit to the Government. It will show how thoroughly and impartially an investigation was conducted against a very senior and close associate of several Ministers in the Government and of the President, and how it was relentlessly pursued until no evidence was left unturned and that he was not allowed to get away and abscond because the Government was afraid it would open up more horrendous skeletons in the cupboard.

The average number of hours per week spent on homework were as follows:- \n  <pre>\r\n\r\n  Primary School\r\n\r\n  children                  6.8 hours\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Secondary School\r\n\r\n  children                 18.5 hours\r\n\r\n</pre> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82% of primary and secondary pupils and 75% of Pre-U pupils considered the amount of homework assigned by their teachers reasonable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These hours are not excessive by any standard.

But averages conceal variations. There are children who do much less homework than the average and there are others who do much more. Those who do very much more - thereby causing anxiety in the mind of the Member for Chong Boon - could be of two types. First, they could be the more diligent and ambitious children.

It is generally agreed that, with a few honourable exceptions, the standard of physical education instruction is poor. A good PE programme is a combination of curricular gymnastics, track and field activities, games and swimming. But such a programme requires trained PE teachers of whom, unfortunately, we have very few. My Ministry is therefore studying the feasibility of setting up a PE college to produce PE teachers in sufficient numbers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the physical fitness of boys has to be improved to better prepare them for National Service. My Ministry has therefore introduced a pilot swimming programme in six secondary schools, to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> be followed by another 14 schools in 1982, to develop the physical fitness of boys. Under the swimming programme, PE lessons in these schools would be exclusively swimming. Swimming has been selected as a means to develop physical fitness of boys for the following reasons: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) a swimming teacher can be trained in a relatively shorter time than an all-round PE teacher; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) a swimming pool is more effective in terms of space utilization than large playing fields in land-scarce Singapore a swimming pool can be used simultaneously by 80 or so persons in an area less than one-fifth of a playing field; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) swimming is proven as a good exercise for developing aerobic capacity. The swimming programme will be extended to more schools as more teachers are trained as swimming instructors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, my Ministry has deployed the few trained PE teachers we have to 14 secondary schools and junior colleges in 1982 to teach a PE programme consisting of a combination of physical conditioning activities, curricular gymnastics, track and field and games to help improve the physical fitness of students. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>COMPUTER CLUBS IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Teaching of computer programmes)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S.

For example, in Bible Knowledge, the textbook is the synoptic Gospels which are an account of the life of Christ and his teachings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'O' level examination at the end of the two-year course will be based entirely on the context of the set books.

CPIB also made an immediate appeal in the local newspapers for information on Phey Yew Kok's whereabouts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interpol Headquarters was alerted and it notified all Interpol countries to arrest Phey Yew Kok. Should he be arrested in a country which has an extradition treaty with Singapore, his extradition will be sought. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Immigration Department also cancelled both his International Passport and his Restricted Passport for travel to West Malaysia. All Immigration checkpoints have been told to seize his passport and refer him to CPIB if he were to pass through any checkpoint. Our overseas missions have also been informed of the cancellation of his passports and were instructed not to issue any passport to him. They are to immediately inform the Immigration Department if he tries to apply for one. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His present whereabouts are unknown. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Phey Yew Kok eventually returns to Singapore, as he must if he wants to be with his wife and family again, he will have to face the charges against him. Each day he remains a fugitive, is a day of punishment, without it being considered part of the period for remission of any prison \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> sentence he might have received. The Police had not expected him to consider it worth his while to jump bail and be a fugitive for the charges that had been brought. They made an error of judgment in not removing his International and Restricted Passports. It could well be that Phey Yew Kok made a greater error in deciding to jump bail. The question is: does he want to live as a fugitive, on the run and subject to extortion and blackmail for the rest of his miserable life? Or is it not better, like Wee Toon Boon, to face the courts, accept any punishment due, and rebuild his life? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has said that it was an error of judgment in not taking away Mr Phey Yew Kok's passport. Would the Minister say whose error of judgment it was and whether he had asked for any explanation from this man who made the error of judgment as to how he fell into this error of judgment? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a lawyer, the Member for Anson should know that it is not as of right that you can ask for the retention of a passport of a person who has been granted bail. It is a matter for the discretion of the Court whether to allow retention of the passport, and it is not normally given. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the specific question whether the police officer concerned has made an error of judgment, yes, he has made an error of judgment. Of course, in his opinion it was unlikely that a person of Mr Phey's position would jump bail. It is not something which you can blame the police officer in this case. As I have said, it is not normal to ask to impound the passport of a person who is granted bail. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether my supplementary question should be directed to the Minister or to the Member for Anson, but is it not right to say that there had been others who jumped bail even when their passports had been seized? In other words, there are other means of running away from Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is yes, there are also other means \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> by which a person can jump bail even without a passport. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with the benefit of hindsight, it can now be said that there has been an error of judgment. But could I ask the Minister, or perhaps the Member for Anson, that without the benefit of hindsight, was it not quite natural for the officer to consider that it would not be necessary to impound his passport in view of the kind of offence that Phey Yew Kok was charged? My point is that Phey Yew Kok was an honourable Member of this House, and at that point of time the officer made a judgment which, I think, was quite fair. I am asking whether at that point of time that judgment was, in fact, an error of judgment. Of course, now on looking back and with the benefit of hindsight, it was an error of judgment. But who expected Phey Yew Kok to do that, and who expects any honourable Member in this House to do that? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Second Deputy Prime Minister (Foreign Affairs)) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Second Deputy Prime Minister (Foreign Affairs) (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> I can think of one! \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not go around punishing police officers for making an error of judgment. We only punish them if there is negligence on their part. I can assure the Member that there was no negligence on his part, civil or criminal negligence. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, is the Minister not aware that the first thing that the CPIB officers do is to impound passports of persons into whose crimes they are inquiring? I know this, Mr Speaker, from the cases that I have handled, that the first thing the CPIB do is to impound the passport. Would the Minister say whether the officer had asked for directions from the DPP or any other authority before he decided not to make an application to impound Mr Phey Yew Kok's passport? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I answer that question I want a clarification from the Member for Anson. What does he mean by saying that before the officer decided not to impound the pass- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> port of Phey Yew Kok, did he ask for directions from the DPP? As a lawyer, he should know that an officer must complete his investigations before he can consult the DPP. I do not know what the Member means by saying that as soon as a person appears before a CPIB officer, in the course of questioning, his passport is impounded. At that stage, how can the officer ask the DPP whether he should impound the passport? At what stage is the Member referring to? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I answer that question, Sir? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, Mr Jeyaretnam. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Minister talks about impounding of passports after completion of investigations. Mr Phey Yew Kok was produced in court. I should have thought that all investigations were completed by the time he was produced in court. Why was there not an application made to the court to impound his passport? And if the CPIB officer or police officer decided that no application was necessary, did he seek the directions of any superior officer, either from the Attorney-General's Chambers or someone higher up in the police force? Because speaking from my own experience, invariably the CPIB seize passports and this had been a departure from the normal practice. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> A point of clarification, Sir. I am not speaking from any experience. In view of the sneaky proposal that the Member put earlier to the Prime Minister that the charges against Phey Yew Kok should be dropped, is he really serious in pursuing this particular question? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Now the Member's question is clear, and that is whether the officer did ask for directions to impound or not to impound the passport of Phey Yew Kok after he was charged in court. The answer is: yes, he did. The point is this. As I have said just now, it is not normal for the court to impound the passport of a person who has been granted bail and in their opinion, it is not necessary in view of the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> position of Phey Yew Kok. It may be an error of judgment but it is certainly not negligence on their part. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has said that the officer did ask for directions. May we know who he asked for directions from? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> He asked directions from the DPP. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>RAPE AND OTHER SEXUAL OFFENCES</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Deterrent punishments)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. \n  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs if he will give an assurance that punishments under the law for rape and other sexual offences will be sufficiently severe at all times to serve as a deterrent to likely offenders and that the investigative procedures involved in such cases will not discourage victims from reporting to the authorities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar) (for the Minister for Home Affairs): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Jalan Kayu has asked for an assurance that the punishments under the law for rape and other sexual offences will be sufficiently severe to serve as a deterrent. I wish to give him that assurance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The punishment for rape is provided by section 376 of the Penal Code and it is imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and the offender shall further be liable to a fine or caning. The offence of outraging of modesty is provided by section 354 of the Penal Code and it is an offence punishable with imprisonment of up to two years and with fine or caning. The Women's Charter also provides for offences against women and girls such as the offence of carnal connection with any girl under the age of 16 years, except by way of marriage, and the punishment is a term of imprisonment of up to five years and the offender shall also \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> be liable to a fine. There are also other sexual offences such as incest, unnatural offences and outrages on decency. However, the main sexual offences of concern are rape and outraging of modesty. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the offence of rape is a very serious one, it is only the High Court which has jurisdiction to try this offence. The severity of sentences imposed will vary from case to case and it is a matter for judicial discretion. This is not to say that our Courts have been lenient in sentencing rape offenders. Our records show that in all the cases where the accused persons were convicted, sentences meted out to them have been very severe, including sentences of life imprisonment. In appropriate cases, corporal punishment was ordered by the Courts, varying from six strokes to 24 strokes of the cane. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to outraging of modesty, one must bear in mind that this category of offence covers a wide variety of situations. The punishments ranged from 18 months' imprisonment and caning to fines of a few hundred dollars. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will keep the situation under review and, if the situation warrants, we will not hesitate to introduce amendments to the law to enhance punishment, including mandatory caning. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the second part of the question concerning investigative procedures, let me say that adequate safeguards are built into the investigative procedures for sexual offences to ensure that the victim does not suffer undue embarrassment. Investigations are conducted in the privacy of a room and in the presence of a woman police officer at all times. The victim is accompanied by a woman police officer for medical examination where it is necessary. All confidential transactions with the victim are carried out discreetly and expeditiously and all reports and documents are treated as highly confidential. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our laws give ample powers to both the High Court and the Subordinate Courts to order any part of the proceedings of a rape trial to be heard in camera and to prohibit anyone from publishing the name or identity of a victim. Furthermore, it is pro- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> vided for in the Women's Charter that in cases of rape or outraging of modesty where the victim is under 16 years of age, the proceedings shall be held in camera. The Women's Charter also imposes certain prohibitions on the press revealing the names, addresses, photographs or other information which could identify victims of certain offences under the Women's Charter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the heavy sentences meted out to sex offenders and the publicity given to them have deterred would-be offenders. Mr Speaker, let me close by saying that the public has an important role to play in minimizing sexual offences by taking preventive measures. In 1981, 58 cases of rape or 62% of the victims were known to the offenders. 14% of the victims of outraging of modesty cases in 1981 were also known to the offenders. It seems clear from this that a large number of the offences, especially rape, would not have occurred if the victims had been more careful. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>SECRET SOCIETY GANGSTERS AND DRUG TRAFFICKERS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Detention without trial)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. \n  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether the laws providing for detention without trial of secret society gangsters and drug traffickers have had the desired deterrent effect. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Delta is referring to the detention of secret society gangsters and drug traffickers under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act. Under this legislation, where the Minister is satisfied that a person has been associated with activities of a criminal nature, he may, with the consent of the Public Prosecutor, order the detention of that person if he is satisfied that it is necessary that such person be detained in the interests of public safety, peace and good order. As of 15th February 1982, there were 1,019 criminal law detainees. Of this number, 541 were \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> detained for secret society and other criminal activities and 478 for drug trafficking activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act was implemented in the late 1950s when secret society activities were rampant. Those were the days when it was not safe to walk on the streets because of secret society activities which included gang clashes, killings and murders. The number of reported secret society activities and incidents in 1959 was as high as 416. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The normal judicial proceedings which assume that there will be witnesses who will be willing to come forth and give evidence, proved totally ineffective. This was because witnesses were terrified of appearing and testifying in the Courts for fear of swift reprisals. It was found that the only effective way to cope with the situation was to use the powers under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act to detain gangsters and secret society members under preventive detention. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that this legislation has had a significant deterrent effect on secret society gangsters. The number of secret society incidents dropped drastically from 416 in 1959 to 12 in 1981, while the number of secret society killings decreased from 21 in 1959 to three in 1981. The detention of secret society members under the Act, therefore, has succeeded in significantly reducing secret society activities. Where investigation and intelligence indicate the existence of secret society activities and where they cannot be dealt with under the normal processes of the law, these are nipped in the bud by the use of Detention Orders and Supervision Orders under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act. The implementation of this legislation has resulted in fewer incidents and has helped make Singapore a more safe and secure place. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction in the number of secret society incidents does not, however, mean that the problem has been totally eradicated or that such preventive detention is no longer necessary. There is the threat of a potential revival of secret society activities as evidenced by the recent triad ceremonies in South Johore in which there was attendance by a number of Singa- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> poreans. Any slackening of our vigilance will result in a revival of the lawlessness of the 1950s. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to drug traffickers, preventive detention under the same law has been resorted to from 1974 onwards. Again, the Act was used because witnesses were not prepared to come forth to give evidence against drug traffickers who had underworld and international syndicate connections. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of such preventive detention that we have been able to smash the highly organized network of drug traffickers in Singapore. The number of drug traffickers detained has been reducing, from 203 in 1978 to 109 in 1981. The preventive detention of drug traffickers has indisputably had a deterrent effect in disrupting and eliminating major drug syndicates which had been operating. With the disruption of the large scale syndicates, addicts have had to resort to obtaining their drug supplies from smalltime street pushers or themselves have become addict pushers. If we had not taken such action under this law or taken other measures such as the mandatory death penalty for certain drug traffickers, there is no doubt that we would have \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> today drug trafficking and drug addiction problems of alarming proportions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to inform the House that adequate safeguards have been built in to the implementation of the Act to ensure that each case is considered carefully. The consent of the Public Prosecutor is required for a detention order. Each case (after the issue of Detention Order) is referred to an independent Criminal Law Advisory Committee which examines all the evidence, including the representations of the detainee concerned, before arriving at the recommendation as to whether the Order should be confirmed by the President. The detainee is allowed to be represented by counsels at this hearing. Each case is reviewed annually by another Advisory Committee to determine whether the detainee should be released, be placed on Police Supervision Order, placed on the Day Release Scheme or have his period of detention extended. The President's approval is required for all Orders which are to be extended. \n  <br>3.30 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Good government requires not only honest, able and dedicated political leaders, but also a leadership in the Civil Service who can match the political leadership in ability, integrity and commitment. Only then will political decisions be translated into workable plans which can be implemented efficiently and with the minimum of rancour and disaffection. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain its vibrancy and effectiveness the Civil Service must attract each \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> year and retain in service a sufficient number of the brightest and most-balanced of our graduates. In due course they will occupy the higher echelons in the Administrative and Professional services. To do otherwise is to put our future in jeopardy because, when the present stalwarts in the service retire, there will not be the young men and women of excellence to whom they can hand over their responsibilities. This we must never allow to happen. The terms and conditions of service of the Administrative Service and the Professional services must therefore be kept competitive with those offered in the private sector. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Professional Services Review Committee (PSRC), working in close consultation with the Chairman, Public Service Commission, recently completed a review of the salaries and other conditions of service in the Administrative and Professional services. Their views and recommendations were submitted to Cabinet on 4th February, 1982, and have been accepted by Government. I shall now outline the major changes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Salary Revision</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1979 Government made a comprehensive study of the incomes of graduates \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> in the public and private sectors. This study indicated that while the outstanding Administrative Officer was paid much less than the top 5% of the salaried graduates in the private sector, the average officer in the Administrative Service earned as much as the average officer in the private sector. Government therefore decided in 1979 that a salary revision was not necessary and that it was sufficient to create additional promotional grades to reward the outstanding Administrative Officers and professionals. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation today is different. An updated study on incomes of graduates reveals a gross disparity in pay between the graduates in the public and private sectors. The study indicates that the mean annual income of graduates in the private sector is about 42% higher than the corresponding mean annual income of graduates in the public sector. In other words, graduates in the private sector earn on the average 42% more than those in the public sector with comparable years of working experience, field of study, and occupation. The disparity in income between graduates in the private and public sectors is particularly glaring for those in the Time-scale grades in Government service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The counterpart to this disparity in income between graduates in the private and public sectors is reflected in high rates of resignations of officers in the Administrative and Professional services in recent years. In the case of officers in the Time-scale grades, 67 Administrative Officers, 165 engineers, 24 lawyers, 70 dentists and 281 doctors left Government service in the last four years. In 1981 alone, 22 Timescale Administrative Officers resigned, an attrition rate of 14%. The attrition rates for the Engineering, Dental and Medical services were even higher, while the attrition rate for the Legal service was 12%. At the more senior level, five Superscale Administrative Officers resigned last year, more than the total number who had resigned for the past ten years. The Professional services \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> also suffered from a heavy and relentless loss of experienced, highly qualified officers which, if allowed to continue, would lead to a deterioration in the quality of staff in those services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has therefore decided to revise the salaries of Timescale grades in the Administrative Service and Professional services. The additional promotional grades created in 1979, particularly the three Staff grades, have brought salaries of Superscale Officers nearer to remuneration in the private sector and no revision of Superscale salaries is necessary. However, consequent on the salary revision for Timescale grades, slight adjustments have to be made to the Superscale salaries. Can I now ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute to Members one Annex (Cols. 481 - 492) which describes the composition and terms of reference of the PSRC, together with three Schedules and one graph. [Copies of Annex distributed to hon. Members.] \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1982/19820303/19820303-HA-0410481.htm\">Annex - THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVIEW COMMITTEE, SALARY PROGRESSION OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICERS ON NEW SCALE, NEW SALARY SCALES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICE, NEW SALARY SCALES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, NEW SALARY SCALES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICE (FOREIGN) AND FOREIGN SERVICE (Cols. 481 - 492)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Timescale Salaries For The Administrative Service</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Timescale salaries for the Administrative Service are set out in Schedule 1, which is now before Members. These new Timescale salaries were derived from a comparative study of the median incomes of engineering and technology graduates in the private sector. Incomes of engineering and technology graduates in the private sector were selected because: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) For a fair comparison incomes of the self-employed graduates in the private sector had to be excluded, and almost all engineering and technology graduates in this sector were employees; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The engineering and technology graduates in the private sector formed a sizeable group and would be a comparable category of graduates since the majority of recruits into the Administrative Service in recent years were engineering graduates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Timescale salaries have been pitched at a level so that when compared with engineering and technology gradu- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ates in the private sector with the same number of years of working experience:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the income of a good Administrative Officer (who is expected to attain Superscale D in about 15 years) will approximate the 90th percentile income of such graduates; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the income of an outstanding Administrative Officer (who is expected to attain Superscale C in about 15 years) will exceed the 90th percentile income of such graduates. Graph I shows the new Time-scale salaries in comparison with remuneration in the private sector. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Timescale Salaries for the Professional Services</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has also approved new Timescale salaries for the Professional services. These are set out in Schedule 11. While the new scales for Timescale Administrative Officers were determined by external relativity, i.e. in comparison with the incomes of engineering and technology graduates in the private sector, the revised Timescales for the Professional services were fixed by internal relativities within the Civil Service and designed to underline the premier status of the Administrative Service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of the revised Time-scale salaries will cost $1.85 million per year for the Administrative Service and $8.90 million per year for the Professional services (excluding the Foreign and Education Services). \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Reduction of Superscale Grades</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid a multiplicity of Superscale grades in the Civil Service, Government has decided to delete the intermediate Superscale grades of H, F, D1, C1 and B1 from the Administrative Service and C1 and B1 from the Professional services. The intermediate grades of Superscale H, F and D1 will be retained for the Professional services to facilitate promotion since there are fewer Superscale grades in the Professional services, the apex grades in these services being Superscale C or lower. Consequent on the deletion of the intermediate Superscale grades, a special promotion exercise will be held for all Superscale Officers in the Administrative Service \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> as well as Professional services to determine their suitability for promotion to the next higher grade. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Foreign Service</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to maintain good relations with other countries it is vital that our Foreign Affairs machinery should be manned by outstanding and dedicated officers capable of interpreting the complex interplay of national ambitions and puffing forward Singapore's views when necessary. Such officers must be drawn from graduates of excellence and, to attract and retain these graduates, a Foreign Service Branch of the Administrative Service will be created which will be identical in salary structure and recruitment standards with the Administrative Service. Depending on their aptitudes, performance and qualifications, serving officers or fresh graduates will be selected for the Administrative Service (Foreign Service Branch) or for the Foreign Service which will be on par with the other Professional services. Schedule III sets out the new salary scales recommended for the Administrative Service (Foreign Service Branch) and the Foreign Service. Implementation of these scales will cost $0.70 million per year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Date of Implementation</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised salary scales and reduction of Superscale grades for the Administrative and all Professional services will be implemented with effect from 1st April, 1982. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Uniformed Services</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uniformed services do not form part of the terms of reference of the present review but no group of officers is more important to Singapore than the senior officers in the Singapore Armed Forces and the Police Force. Without a tenacious, well-trained and highly motivated SAF, led by able, wholly committed officers, Singapore will be defenceless in time of war and become easy pickings for an aggressor. Similarly, without an efficient and non-corrupt Police Force, led by intelligent, determined officers, law and order will not match the wit and guile of shrewd and ruthless criminal types and the texture of our society will be damaged. The salaries and promotion prospects of the senior \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> echelons of the uniformed services will therefore be reviewed by the Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Home Affairs, in consultation with the Ministry of Finance, to reflect the importance of their contribution to the security and prosperity of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Education Services</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On account of its special features the Education Service will be considered in a separate exercise and the Education Ministry is looking into this matter. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Other Services</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Statement is concerned principally with salaries in the Administrative and Professional services, and this is as it should be since the Administrative and Professional services constitute, in a way, the brain of the Civil Service. However, no matter how brilliant the brain, no organization, least of all the Civil Service, can hope to function effectively unless it has a healthy heart and strong arms and legs. The heart of the Civil Service is team work not only team work between officers in the Administrative and Professional services, whether they are scholars or non-scholars, but also team work between the officers in the senior echelons and the support staff in the Executive service, Clerical service, Nursing service, etc, who collectively make up the arms and legs of the Civil Service. It is only when there is a sense of dedication and common purpose between the Permanent Secretary and the clerical officer that the Civil Service will be able to respond sensitively and quickly to the needs of the public which it serves. While we revise the salaries of officers in the Administrative and Professional services, we should therefore not overlook the need to revise the salaries in the supporting services. This is now being done by the Ministry of Finance in consultation with the Chairman, Public Service Commission. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the large number of other services that have to be reviewed, the Ministry and PSC will have to stagger them. Services which have high turnover of staff and great difficulty in recruiting staff will be given priority over others. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> However, other reviews which have begun in response to proposals submitted by departments or the trade unions will continue. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this review the Ministry will not be bound by existing relativities between services and between grades in the same service. Each service will be examined on its own merits and employees on the same salary scale in different services may not get on to the same (new) salary scale after review. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Other Conditions of Service</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the PSRC and Chairman PSC are of the view that other terms of service such as leave, medical benefits and car loans are generally satisfactory except for the matter of housing and superannuation. These will be looked into in a separate exercise. \n  <br>3.50 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to seek clarification from the Minister for Trade and Industry. It is not my intention to object to Government's move to raise the level of salaries of the Administrative and Professional officers in the Government service. But I would like to ask the Minister whether there is going to be a survey done for the lower ranking officers in Divisions 11,111 and IV and the daily-rated and monthly-rated workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I seek some clarification from the Minister on his statement, could I just very quickly take this opportunity to compliment the Minister and the Professional Services Review Committee for having taken cognizance of the urgency of the problem facing the Government in respect of the terms and conditions of employment in the public sector by putting forward an excellent proposal which the Government has accepted. I hope it is a step in the right direction and not a case of too little being done too late. I also want to compliment the Committee for having taken cognizance of the fact that it is not only the brains, i.e. not only the Administrative and Professional services, that need \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> its attention but also the rest of the civil service. Right now, because of the complex nature and the size of the public service, the review has got to be done step by step. My question is: how long will the negotiations and the study on the revision of the other services be completed? From my experience with the civil service, it normally takes a long time and sometimes they conveniently forget about certain matters. So I would like to press for an answer, at least to be given an indication of the time-frame. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question that I want to ask is this. In view of the complex nature and the time involved in this exercise to revise the salary scales of the other sectors in the civil service, as an interim measure will the Minister recommend to the Committee and to the Government that a 14th month payment be paid? [Laughter]. I make this suggestion in seriousness. Apart from the salary scales, one very important factor that contributes towards the satisfaction of the worker is this question of bonus. I think this is a factor that must also be taken into account. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, for example, a lid was placed on the quantum of bonus to be paid in the private sector, and the lid was that no more than three months' bonus could be paid. But in the present move by the Government to encourage, stimulate and promote greater productivity, the lid has been lifted. In the private sector, including Government-owned companies like Sembawang Shipyard and Keppel Shipyard, they have paid bonus something like five months' salary or more. I think this has made the disparity even more invidious and more envious of the private sector especially when the Government stili sticks to the 13th month payment and also when civil servants retire they are not entitled to the 13th month payment. Thanks to the Minister for Finance! \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 14th month payment as an interim measure to the civil servants will, I think, show them that, apart from giving the Professionals and the Administrative Officers a fairly generous revision - taking into account that the Government is usually very miserly - the Government has also not neglected, right from the start, those who do not belong to this class. I think this \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> move has got particular significance because bonus is an important factor of productivity and so forth. We are often asked to excel and to follow the Japanese - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr E.W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Law (Mr E.W. Barker)</b> \n  <b>rose</b> \n  <b></b> \n  <b><br><br>\n   <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b></b> Mr Sia, will you give way? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong</b> resumed his seat. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I just like to point out to the Member for Moulmein that, after the Ministerial Statement, he is confined to asking questions. He has taken a long time to ask two questions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my questions require a lot of consideration! My questions are not only directed at the Minister for Trade and Industry but also the Finance Ministry, and therefore a little bit more time is necessary for me to state the rationale for my questions. I am about to complete whatever I want to say. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been asked to follow the Japanese example, their work attitude and so forth, and even the Koreans who are noted for their hard work. But I just want to point out that one of the features of management of workers in Korea and Japan is a very sizable amount of bonus. In Japan, it averages between six months and 10 months' pay. In Korea, it is six months. In Singapore, Sembawang Shipyard, Keppel Shipyard and the luckier private companies, it is five months. But for the public sector it is one month. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will ask a question of the Minister for Trade and Industry. May I strongly suggest to the Minister for Trade and Industry that he take seriously the suggestion of my good Friend, the hon. Member for Moulmein, and that is, the payment of 14th month bonus or the 14th month annual wage supplement as an interim measure in recognition of the fact that the arms and legs and the heart of the other part of the civil service do play an equally important role in the overall structure of the entire civil service. Also, should not due recogni- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> tion be given to an upward revision of salaries to all the various services in Divisions II, III and IV down to the daily-rated and the monthly-rated workers? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi (Kampong Kembangan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to share the compliments given by my good Friend, the hon.

May I insist that Standing Orders be adhered to and that Members just ask questions and put them briefly? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, quite right. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> - in complimenting the Minister for Trade and Industry for proposing a good scheme for the Administrative and Professional services. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your question, Mr Mansor? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Sir, is it true that the Public Service Commission only selects graduate scholars for appointment to the Administrative Service at the exclusion of the good graduates who may have Upper II and above but who are non-scholars? If yes, what is the rationale? Does this mean that non-scholar graduates of local universities or even of universities overseas are less able for appointment in the Administrative Service even if they have at least a good Upper II? Should we not open appointments to Administrative Service to these non-scholar graduates who have good degrees? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What really are the reasons for resignaions? At what stage do most of these officers, especially Administrative Service Officers, resign the service? What really is he intolerable or tolerable rate of resignaion? Or to put it differently, what is the minimum core number of top-grade AOs necessary to keep the Government machinery going effectively? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comment on this question: I understand that over the years we have between 15% and 20% of unfilled posts in the Administrative Service. Yet we seem to manage. How certain are we that these salary revisions will effectively check the brain-drain to the private sector? I reckon that the private sector can easily match the Government in improving the terms of service so as to continue to make them more attractive in the private sector. I reckon this can happen. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, besides these salary revisions, are there any schemes to give more specific perks to the Administrative and Professional Officers, and also to the officers who constitute the heart, the hands and legs of the Civil Service? If there are, could the Minister give them in greater detail? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, has the Hon. Minister looked into other causes for the high attrition rate of resignations from the Civil Service, such as low morale due to the undue emphasis on high flyers and returned scholars, motivation, industrial relations and personnel management? Should it not be a matter of concern to him and to this House that Singaporeans are so concerned with monetary rewards? Should we not divert the attention of people, especially the civil servants, to matters like dedication and other non-pecuniary returns? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister agree with me that the real cause of the brain drain from the Civil Service is the high economic growth rate that we have been experiencing, especially over the last couple of years? Would he also not agree with me that this is also linked up with the boom in the property market which has priced many people out of the market and that, therefore, the civil servants have turned to the private sector in search of high salaries in the hope of getting good homes? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have two questions. Does the Minister and the Professional Services Review Committee recognize, as has been said by the last speaker, that it is not just monetary \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> rewards that lure people out of Government service or out of Government employment. There are other areas for discontent, such as conditions of service, especially among professionals employed by the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is this. Would the Government or the Professional Services Review Committee have a hearing to hear complaints from the Professional services in the Government service in the areas in which they feel discontented about their service with the Government? Secondly, would the Government also undertake a revision of salaries or a review of salaries for all those in the Civil Service, that is, Division II and Division III, and not just confine it to the Administrative and Professional services? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank Members for their suggestions in regard to the revision of salaries which I have just announced. Let me take the questions put by the Members in the order in which they were asked. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, with regard to the question by the Member for Khe Bong, I can assure him that, as I have stated in the Ministerial Statement, the Ministry of Finance is looking into the salary scales of the other services, that is, Divisions II, III and IV. In their review of these services, they will take into account all the factors, including disparities of pay between the salary scales in that service and the services outside. That will be done. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein has asked whether I can give a time-frame for the review of the other services. I regret that this is not possible. There are a large number of these services. If the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service Commission are to do a proper job, they must take their time to make sure that any revisions are justified and fair to the people in the services concerned. But I am sure they will try to expedite it. He has also made the suggestion that during the period of the review the Government should consider making a 14th month payment to tide the other services over, so to speak, during the period of the review. This has also been supported by the Member for Punggol. I \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> shall commend this suggestion to the Minister for Finance. I understand that in Japan bonuses are now paid twice a year, one in Spring and another in Autumn. As we are advocating the Japanese style of management here, I am sure that this suggestion will merit consideration by the Ministry of Finance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan has asked a number of questions. First of all, he has asked why the PSC only selects graduate scholars to the Administrative Service. The answer is that, of course, this is not true. Entry into the Administrative Service is open to all good graduates who have at least a Second Class Upper (Honours) degree. However, the difficulty in Singapore in recent years is that it is extremely difficult to find a good graduate who is not a scholar. I remember that when I was the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Singapore, we had a peculiar problem there in that there were a number of scholarships for which we could not find anybody to give to because all those who were qualified to receive them had already been awarded scholarships of one type or another. But if there are any good graduates who happened not to have received a scholarship, then the PSC will certainly be pleased to interview them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to resignations, there are many reasons why people resign from the Civil Service or from any organization. Salary is only one of them. Occasionally they have differences with their superiors. Some people find that after a few years they are not suited for work in the Civil Service. But undoubtedly salary is one of their major concerns. At what stage of their career do most of the Administrative Officers leave the service? We have found out, over a period of time, that they normally leave after they have served between five and eight years in the Administrative Service. This seems to be the most popular period. I believe the answer is quite simple. If they are male graduates and after they have finished their National Service, they would join the Civil Service at the age of either 23, 24 or 25 years. For the first five years they are quite content to remain in the Civil Service because they are receiving training. Besides, during that time their commitments are also not so many. After \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> five years they get married. Some of them will have their first or second child and then the pressure of their commitments will force them to take a closer look at their careers. Moreover, at about this time they would have had enough experience in the Civil Service to know whether they want to make a permanent career in the Civil Service or whether they should seek their fortunes in the private sector. The period between five and eight years is most crucial. That is why the salary revisions are targetted for the middle range of the Time-scales. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what is the number of core Administrative Officers that we need? The Budget Division has authorized a permanent establishment of 299 Administrative Officers. I am sure we all know very well the nature of the Ministry of Finance. We can be assured that they are not over-generous in allocating posts for the Administrative Service. I can say that 299 Administrative Officers will be the number which we need to run the service at a comfortable level. As at 1st January this year, we had 199 Administrative Officers, 131 Timescale Officers and 68 Superscale Officers. So there were 100 vacancies, or approximately one-third of the number of posts in the Administrative Service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered the question as to how effectively the revision of salaries will check the resignations. But let me say that we will never be able to devise a salary scale such that no one will ever resign. If we do that, then we are doing something wrong. It means that we are overpaying our officers. There must be a certain amount of turnover in any service, in any organization. What this revision seeks to achieve is to check the gross disparity in pay between a graduate who works in the private sector and one who works in the public sector so that we can be sure, we hope, that the rate of resignations will slow down and we can also be sure that we can retain a number of Administrative Officers who will, as the years go by, gain experience and will, therefore, be able to take over the top jobs in future when these are available. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the last question is whether there are schemes to give other perks to the Administrative and Professional officers. During the course of its deliberations, the Professional Services Review Committee and the Chairman, Public Service Commission, also looked into the other terms and conditions of service and they discussed these with the Administrative Officers themselves. The feedback they had was that most of the other conditions of service were satisfactory except for housing and superannuation. As I have mentioned in my Statement today, these are being looked into in a separate exercise. I hope I have covered all the questions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa has asked about the causes for the high rate of resignations. I think I have answered that question. He has asked whether there is not an undue emphasis on scholars and also the need for personnel management in the Civil Service. I do not think that within the Civil Service itself there is any undue focus on scholars. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotion within the Civil Service is by performance whether you are or are not a scholar. Perhaps the press has been giving too much attention to a certain category of the Civil Service. But I can assure you that the Permanent Secretaries in the Civil Service are a very hard-headed lot. A scholar may perhaps enter with a certain amount of glory but if he does not perform, he will find that his shortcomings will soon be discovered. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked whether I would agree with him that the real cause of the brain drain from the Civil Service is our high economic growth and connected with that, the high prices of property. I think that it is undoubtedly true. It is because our economy has grown so substantially and in such a diversified way in the last 10 to 15 years that a wealth of employment opportunities has now opened up for our graduates. Whereas 30-40 years ago there were few openings for good people other than perhaps the medical or the legal professions and one or two vacancies that opened each year in the colonial civil service a good graduate can now take his pick of jobs in Manufacturing, Transport or \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> what-have-you. So the Civil service today has to compete with these other economic sectors for the people which it needs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the high prices of properties, I think that this must be of concern not only to the civil servants but also to all Singaporeans. One of the matters which the PSRC would be paying particular attention to would be to see how to improve the housing scheme for Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally the suggestion from the Member for Anson as to whether the PSRC would hold a hearing to hear complaints from the Administrative and Professional officers. The answer is that we have already held hearings and discussed extensively with a number of Administrative and Professional officers in the formulation of these revisions. I see no advantage in reopening this again. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked whether Government would review the terms and conditions of service in the other services. I believe I have answered that, both in the Statement and again in my answers previously. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether the PSC Chairman, in reviewing the salaries of the officers in the Professional and Administrative services, has taken into consideration the fact that, as the top echelons in the Professional and Administrative services, apart from their salaries they also have position, power and prestige. This, no money can buy. So a person cannot expect to have gain and fame. I would like to know whether the PSC Chairman has taken this into consideration. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is yes. Unfortunately, even after taking these other factors into account, the sad fact of life is that the disparity in remuneration between what a good graduate can earn in the public sector and in the private sector is so large that it is not fair to expect civil servants in large measure to make that sacrifice to remain in the Civil Service. No one who makes a career in the Civil Service or in the public sector, whether as a politician or as a civil servant, expects that he or she will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> be able to obtain the high financial rewards which a good graduate can ear in the private sector. But no one who contemplates a career in the Civil Service should be asked to receive a remuneration whereby he has to see his family suffer or whereby he cannot provide adequately and comfortably for his family. I think it is foolish economy for us to withhold what the Civil Service deserves. If we cannot get good people to run the Government, it is Singapore who will be the loser in the long run. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>4.21 p.m. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CURRENCY (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Currency Act (Chapter 64 of the Revised Edition)\", \n  <br>\n  <br>presented by the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education (Dr Goh Keng Swee); read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY SEA</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1972 (No. 30 of 1972)\", \n  <br>\n  <br>presented by the Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam); read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Ngee Ann College was established in 1963 by the Ngee Ann Kongsi and functioned as a private College which offered 4-year degree courses in arts, science and commerce. In 1966 the role of the College in the Singapore educational system was reviewed. The main recommendation was that the College should become a public institution of higher learning offering diploma courses in engineering and commerce similar to that of the Singapore Polytechnic. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This recommendation was accepted and the first important change was implemented in early 1967 when the College stopped enroling new students for the degree courses as a first step in the phasing-out programme. This programme was completed at the end of 1969 when the last batch of degree-course students left the College on graduation. In September, 1967, with the passage in Parliament of the Ngee Ann College Act, the status of the College was changed from a private to a public educational institution. Subsequently in August, 1968, this Act was amended to become the Ngee Ann Technical College Act and the College formally assumed its present name, the Ngee Ann Technical College (NATC). Since then, it has functioned as a polytechnic offering diploma-level courses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ngee Ann Technical College Act spells out the objects and functions of the College and the composition, functions and powers of the Council which is the governing body of the College. In acknowledgement of the role of the Ngee Ann Kongsi, the Act provides for the three representatives of the Kongsi to serve in the Council. The Kongsi continues to provide financial assistance to the College, its annual contribution being 75% of its net annual revenue. Concurrently with these changes, NATC was moved from its borrowed premises in the Ngee Ann Kongsi buildings in Tank Road in 1968 to its present campus in Clementi Road. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a polytechnic, the College had a humble beginning. In 1968, it started with 116 students in its only course, Mechanical Engineering. But its growth has been impressive. By 1981, the student enrolment reached 3,200 in five departments, namely, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering, Ship-building &amp; Repair Technology, Building and Business Studies. This was made possible by the continuous development which, with Government support, the College has carried out over the years. As early as in 1971, the College embarked on its first 5-year expansion programme at a total cost of more than $14 million, including a US$3 million loan from the Asian Development Bank. This project provided for the building of new laboratories, workshops, offices and lecture theatres. Towards the end of the project period, the College carried out two other development projects to establish the Department of Shipbuilding &amp; Repair Technology in April 1975 and the Department of Building in November 1975. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the years, the College has worked closely with the Education Ministry, other government and public bodies and the private sector towards providing full-time training for school leavers to meet the increasing demand for suitably trained manpower. The full-time programme includes 3-year courses for 'O' level holders and 2-year courses for those with 'A' level qualifications, the latter being introduced only in 1980. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recent greater emphasis on the need for continuing education among working people, the College has extended its role to provide a Continuing Education Programme. The programme, which was started in 1978 on a regular basis has introduced a variety of part-time evening diploma courses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest development is the College's second 5-year (1981 - 85) Expansion Project which, when completed, will provide the College with facilities to cater for a full-time enrolment of 8,000 students. Physical facilities will be increased and enhanced; additional support and recreational facilities including a sports complex will be built. The expanded campus will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> cover over 26 hectares. There are also plans to build residential accommodation for foreign staff and students. The total cost of this Project as proposed will be around $200 million. The existing courses of study are subjected to continuous review and modification in accordance with the changing needs of industry and commerce. In this respect, it has been decided that the practical content of the technical courses should be increased. New courses of study relevant to the needs of the country will also be introduced. The first amongst these will be the Diploma in Computer Studies course which will train students to become programmers and systems analysts at the junior level. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parallel to the expansion in enrolment is the need for more and better qualified teaching staff. A staff development scheme is being implemented under which serving staff are given opportunities to obtain locally as well as overseas relevant experience and qualifications. Major recruitment exercises are being carried out, both locally and overseas, to attract suitably qualified professionals to join the College. The College will continue with recruitment vigorously so that it will have the 500 teaching staff required to cater for the 8,000 students in 1985. This will be a major task. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do the graduates of the College perform? Feedback on their performance and the usefulness of their training have been obtained through many surveys. These show that they are easily absorbed in the public and private sectors. Regular graduate employment surveys show that more than 90% of the job seekers had found their first job within the first three months after graduation. A survey on NATC graduates of 1971 to 1979 showed that not only the occupational experience of NATC technical graduates is in many ways similar to that of their Singapore Polytechnic counterparts, they are just as strongly in demand. Like Singapore Polytechnic graduates, most NATC technical graduates are engaged directly in technical or engineering work and almost all hold jobs for which their College training is relevant. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The College has the same aims and objectives as the Singapore Polytechnic; its courses are comparable and its graduates are accepted as equals to those of Singapore Polytechnic. NATC has come of age. At the threshold of its next phase of expansion, it is timely to rename it as the Ngee Ann Polytechnic, or NP for short. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.- [Dr Tay Eng Soon]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <br>5.00 p.m. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year will be changed from \"1981\" to \"1982\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 to 5 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PENSIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>5.02 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, the annual NWC awards are not pensionable under the Pensions Act (Cap. 55). Therefore, officers who are superannuated under the Pensions Scheme cannot have the annual NWC awards included in the computation of their pensions unless the awards are already consolidated into salaries. They \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> are at a disadvantage compared with those non-pensionable officers who are on the full CPF Scheme whose total emoluments, including the annual NWC awards, attract full CPF benefits. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first-tier annual NWC awards supplement wages and salaries should properly be treated as part of such wages and salaries. These awards can only be consolidated into salaries once in four or five years because of the massiveness of each consolidation exercise. Pensionable officers who retire in between consolidation exercises therefore lose out. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This inequity should be removed. This can only be done by amending the Pensions Act. The purpose of the Pensions (Amendment) Bill is to make pensionable the first-tier annual NWC awards which have not been consolidated into salaries. This change is intended to take effect from 1st January 1982. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the Government's move to make NWC wage increases pensionable. This is a move in the right direction. This move also shows that Government has the concern for its employees when they retire, and this is in line with the Government's policy of promoting Confucian ethics - to care and respect our senior citizens who have contributed to our country and community when they worked as civil servants. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Sir, may I ask the Minister this question: since Government is going to make NWC wage increases pensionable, whit about the Annual Wage Supplement? Why has this Annual Wage Supplement been left out? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. Serving officers in the Civil Service, particularly those who are due to retire, will find this Bill a welcome move by the Minister for Finance as they now can look forward to an \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> enhanced quantum of gratuity and monthly pension allowances because the NWC allowances are made pensionable and therefore included in the computation of pensions and gratuities with effect from 1st January 1982. This move (to make NWC allowances pensionable) by the Minister of Finance shows that once in a while, his Ministry is capable of acts of understanding and generosity. On this occasion, I therefore find nothing but praise and support for the Finance Minister for this enlightened move over a matter concerning the pension rights of civil servants. Unfortunately, I cannot find many occasions like this to heap praise on the Minister for Finance. I, together with others, have yet to convince the Finance Minister, for example, over the payment, even part payment, on a pro-rata basis of the 13th month allowance to civil servants in the year of their retirement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the Bill before the House, can I seek a clarification from the Finance Minister whether he would consider making this Bill retrospective to the year when NWC allowances were first introduced, so that officers who retired earlier but whose NWC allowances were not included in the computation of their pensions and gratuities, could have their pensions and gratuities re-computed so that they too can benefit from this move of making the NWC allowances pensionable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I also take this opportunity to ask the Minister for Finance whether he would consider the payment of the first tier NWC allowance on the monthly pension allowance of pensioners. It is a well known fact that the pensioners are finding the value of their pension allowances diminishing because of the continuous trend of high inflation rate in recent years and in the foreseeable future. Many pensioners are finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet. Many of them have to continue working to keep their body and soul together. Those who work are those who are still physically fit and can find employment. Not all are fortunate enough to find suitable employment or physically fit to continue with employment. Even those who are employed now, realize that sooner or later, they too must go on in life without employment. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, one of the main attractions for joining the Civil Service was the pension rights. They were supposed to give security to a retired civil servant until his death. But because the pension benefits have remained the same, and have not been revised to keep up with the growing increase in the cost of living, the pension rights are not considered as an attraction for serving in the Civil Service. It is time the Government did something for the pensioners. For a start, I suggest pay the first tier NWC allowance on the pension allowance. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a pensioner myself I am always sympathetic to all the representations made on their behalf but there are principles in the Ministry of Finance which prevent retrospective effect being given to many of the changes we made. It is not very easy if we went back to the first date when NWC allowances were made. Why should we stop at that particular date? Why not go back to 1959 when the First Deputy Prime Minister was made a pensioner? His pension is now considered to be somewhat derisory. In the same way my own pension goes back to 1965 or 1966. On the other hand, of course, the Minister of Defence has had consolidated salaries calculated for his pension, and therefore he enjoys a much better pension. I think the principle of the Treasury is that if a decision is made it takes effect from that date or the first of the month following. So I am afraid that it would not be possible for me to make this NWC allowance calculation retrospective from the date when it was first granted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the other suggestion by the Member for Moulmein, it is also difficult for revision of pensions to give a greater allowance for pensioners. I think we do what we can from time to time for the hardest hit of the pensioners, and we have revised the allowance (called the New Singapore Allowance) over the years. As to when we will make the next revision, of course, we always have in mind from time to time when circumstances make it necessary for us to revise. Beyond that I do hot think the Government can afford to revise the pensions. For example, in the case of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the most recent pensioners, if we add the NWC first tier on, they may end up almost as well as if they had remained in the civil service. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Sia, may I remind you of Standing Order 44?

There is provision for any allowances to be declared pensionable, but I do not think it is the intention of the Treasury that the AWS will be made pensionable. It is not even considered to be awarded to people who retire during the year. So I think it will be inconsistent if I make the AWS pensionable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Hon Sui Sen]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>5.14 p.m. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year will be altered from \"1981\" to \"1982\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further alteration is necessary: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 1, line 4, after \"shall\" to insert \"be deemed to have\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is purely a grammatical correction necessitated by the lapse of time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>5.15 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill, 1981, is to give legislative authority to the income tax concessions announced in the 1981 Budget Statement. Opportunity is taken at the same time to include amendments to improve and extend some of the provisions in the Income Tax Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the concessions announced in the 1981 Budget Statement was the reduction in personal income tax. In respect of tax payable for the Year of Assessment 1981, a tax rebate of 10% of total tax liability was granted and in respect of tax payable from Year of Assessment 1982, marginal tax rates will be reduced. The tax rebate is effected through a remission of tax under subsection (2) of section 92 of the Act whilst the reduction in marginal rates required an amendment to the Act. Clause 13 of the Bill amends the Second Schedule to the Act to revise the rates \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> according to those announced in the Budget Statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concessions are increased earned income relief for handicapped persons and separate assessment for investment incomes of married women. Clause 10 amends section 39 of the Act to increase the earned income relief for a handicapped person from $1,000 to $2,000. Clause 12 makes the appropriate amendment to section 51 to allow the unearned income of a married woman to be chargeable to tax in her own name if the Comptroller is satisfied that her unearned income is attributable to assets and investments acquired by her from her earned income in the past. These concessions will take effect from Year of Assessment 1982. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on to the other amendments which are made to improve existing legislation. Clause 14 amends the Fifth Schedule to the Act to permit enhanced child relief for specially qualified married women to be granted to women who have more than three children before 1st August, 1973, with effect from Year of Assessment 1981. This was previously limited to qualified married women who have three children or less on or after 1st August, 1973. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accelerated depreciation allowance is currently granted to plant and machinery of industrial enterprises, anti-pollution equipment, computers and plant and machinery for research and development. This is now extended to construction machinery and equipment to encourage greater mechanization in the construction industry. Clause 8 of the Bill makes the necessary amendment to section 19A of the Act to provide for this. The concession will be applicable to construction equipment acquired during the period 1st January, 1981, to 31st December, 1985. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dividends declared out of income of Asian Currency Units and income from insurance and reinsurance of offshore risks, which are subject to tax at the concessionary rate of 10%, are exempt from tax in the hands of the shareholder under section 13B. This section is now amended \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to include dividends declared out of off-shore income from gold transactions which are also taxed at the concessionary 10% rate. Clause 3 makes this amendment which takes effect from the Year of Assessment 1981. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial building allowances will be extended to the first two resort hotels to be built on Sentosa as an incentive for the development of resort hotels on the island. Clauses 6 and 7 amend sections 16 and 18 of the Act to provide for an initial depreciation allowance of 20% and an annual allowance of 2% of the capital expenditure incurred in the construction of the hotels. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy conservation standard set by Building Regulations in 1979 is a maximum Overall Thermal Transfer Value of 45 watts per square metre for airconditioned commercial buildings. To encourage owners of existing airconditioned commercial buildings to take the necessary measures to comply with this standard, approved expenditure on energy conservation incurred by owners of such buildings will be tax deductible against business profits or rental income. Clause 4 incorporates a new section 14G in the Bill to provide for this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management fees paid by investment holding companies to their investment managers are presently not tax deductible expenses. However, to aid the development of fund management activities, 50% of the management fees paid by an approved investment company which includes a unit trust will, from Year of Assessment 1982, be tax deductible. A new section 14F provides for such deduction. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutory bodies under the First Schedule to the Income Tax Act are exempt from tax on their income. This, in effect, means that dividends received from subsidiary companies by the statutory bodies are also exempt from tax. Clause 2 amends paragraph (e) of subsection (1) of section 13 to give the Minister for Finance the discretion to decide whether or not to refund the tax deducted from such dividends. This shall have effect from Year of Assessment 1982. Clause 2 also makes a minor amendment to allow charitable \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> organizations to be exempt from tax only if they expend not less than 80% of their income on charitable activities within Singapore, unless the Comptroller otherwise permits. The amendment will apply from Year of Assessment 1983. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 amends section 26 of the Act to allow insurance companies engaged primarily in the business of export credit insurance to adopt such underwriting accounting method as the Comptroller may approve for tax purposes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Minister for Finance has said, this Amendment Bill is to legislate for certain tax relief measures announced in the Budget statement last year. There is nothing to criticize. This Bill will certainly receive the support of those who will benefit from it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister mentioned that opportunity is also being taken to improve upon certain other provisions in the existing Income Tax Act, But I believe many people will regret that the Bill does not include certain amendments, which are necessary and overdue, to some provisions of the Act. I believe many people will agree with my view that the following points need improvement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the amount for personal reliefs is too low. For several years it has never been increased. Even though Backbenchers have repeatedly spoken for the taxpayers over the past decade or more, the personal relief has been a trite talking point in almost every Parliamentary debate. Yet it is a realistic issue of immediate concern. One needs money for everything. With continual increases in the cost of living, personal expenditure also keeps on increasing. Therefore, personal reliefs should also be increased proportionately and should not remain unchanged. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, CPF contribution is a form of compulsory saving. The employee's \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> contribution has been increasing up to 22%, while CPF interest has remained the lowest in the market, at 61/2%. However, in tax relief, the maximum is $5,000 which also includes insurance premiums paid. All these are not to the advantage of the wage earner. Third, the tax relief of $750 for providing for a parent is really too low. During the debate on the then Budget Statement on 16th March, 1972 I requested the Government to grant certain tax reliefs to taxpayers who looked after their parents, in order to encourage filial piety. The following year, 1973 in the course of the Budget debate the Minister for Finance agreed to a relief of $300 in this respect. This was raised to $750 in the Budget Statement of 1974. Today, eight years hence, it remains at $750. This is a bit unrealistic. Since then prices have gone up, while inflation goes on unabated. Reliefs for providing for parents, wife and children should therefore also be increased. In the past, in order to encourage people to beautify. and maintain their garden, we had allowed tax relief in this respect to be increased from $100 to $300. We have even more reason now to increase the tax relief for providing for parents, as this would positively encourage the keeping of the three-generation family under one roof. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If amendments are made to take in the few points mentioned above, more people will benefit and consequently our Income Tax Act will be a more realistic one. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to join my good Friend, the hon. Member for Delta, in speaking on this Bill, in particular to ask for further income tax reliefs. Income tax legislation is of utmost importance to everyone in Singapore and each year, around Budget time, everyone looks forward to matters concerning income tax to see how generous the Hon. Minister would be. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in formulating these policies not just pertaining to income tax but on all aspects of the Budget, the Minister has always taken into consideration the views of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Members as well as the views expressed by members of the public. Indeed it is gratifying to note that the Hon. Minister for Trade and Industry, who has been charged with the duty of preparing the Budget this year, has taken great pains to meet and to consult various groups of people in the preparation of the Budget. Sir, it is this style of government - being alive and responsive to views and opinions expressed by others, whether it be in this House or outside this House - that has kept our Government in close touch with reality and to changing circumstances that affect the lives and the destinies of Singaporeans. Likewise, Backbenchers have been very vocal in this House in expressing matters that affect our citizens, especially those that affect the pockets of our citizens, and indeed income tax is no exception. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Friend, the Member for Delta, is correct in saying that requests for personal reliefs and earned income reliefs have been talking points in many a Parliamentary debate. A check through Hansard reveals that in the last two years alone this matter was raised nine times. In 1980, the Members for Whampoa, Bedok, Changi and Khe Bong raised this matter. In 1981 the hon. Members for Pasir Panjang, Boon Lay, Henderson, Changi and Punggol also raised this matter. No doubt, if I were to go further back into Hansard, I would not be surprised to discover that practically everyone on the Backbench has raised this matter sometime or other. Similarly, we have on many occasions asked for the limit on the tax relief for CPF contributions and life insurance premiums to be raised. In 1977 I was one of those who spoke on this matter, and subsequently the Member for Punggol also spoke. In 1979 the ceiling was raised to $5,000. I think this is a good illustration that the Government does not turn a deaf ear to the pleas of Members of Parliament. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not intend to go further into the reasons for asking for more reliefs here, as the hon. Member for Delta has already covered that subject. But I think it would not be inappropriate to ask that perhaps, to simplify matters, CPF contributions and life insurance premiums should be fully granted relief from taxation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, requests for further income tax reliefs of various types are topics which have been raised before countless numbers of times in this House. Undoubtedly, I do not expect the Hon. Minister to say \"Yes\". I think he will say \"No\" again today. But he can have the assurance that as long as he keeps saying \"No\", so will the Backbenchers continue to ask him the same question year after year. I have no doubt that in the coming Budget debate some of us will do so. But I am optimistic that, with repetition, the Hon. Minister will concede. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may recall the memory of hon. Members. We had on many occasions asked for CPF contributions to be used for the purchase of private homes. But the Minister, or rather the former Minister for Labour, had insisted that this could not be done. However, with much persistence from the Backbenchers, we can see that the policy has been changed. May I then end on a note that I hope the Hon. Minister for Finance listens as well as did his other Ministerial colleagues to the Backbenchers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, actually the point that I wish to raise has already been adequately covered by my two colleagues. But there is another point that I would like to raise, and that is the application for relief for aged parents. As the Income Tax Act now stands, any applicant who wishes to apply for tax relief for aged parents must have his aged parents living with him, otherwise such relief will not be permitted. I would like to make a request here, that if the taxpayer is able to show proof that he is, in fact, supporting his aged parents, he should be allowed to make his claim for such relief. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Minister has indicated in his speech on the Second Reading of this Bill, this Bill seeks to implement proposals that were mentioned in the Budget Statement for changes in the income tax structure. I do not suppose that anything that I say here or anything that other Members may say here will impede the passage of this Bill tonight. But speak I must on behalf of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> those whose cries have not been heard. We have had references from hon. Members here about the appeals over the past years falling on deaf ears and I propose tonight to lend my support to those who have been making these appeals to the Minister with no success at all. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it must perhaps seem ungracious on my part that I should cavil at the generous impulses of the Minister and his Ministry when they propose to make hand-outs of about $81 million from the revenue. Mr Speaker, Sir, the handouts that are being proposed, as the Minister said in his Budget Statement last year, would, in the main, benefit those who already have enough money in their pocket, whilst denying any relief to people who have very little money in their pocket to meet the rising cost of living, the medical care and various other payments that one has to make today. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 enlarges the separate assessment that was introduced in 1962 for married women. It was a good measure to introduce separate assessment for married women, restricting it to the earned income of these wives. It was a step in the right direction as it encouraged wives who were able to contribute to the economy of the country to go out and work. So I say that was a good measure. But clause 12 now seeks to enlarge it, and it seeks to provide for separate assessment of not only just the earned income of the married women but also of the unearned income of these married women. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it does not need very much thinking to realize that the people who have money to invest are those who, because of their educational qualifications or professional qualifications, which they owe to their parents who were able to give them education or to send them to the universities, are able to command high salaries in the market. So it is these ladies who will be able to invest their spare cash from the earned income on investments, and this relief is primarily directed at them. It is this minority with the spare cash from the earned employment who are being enabled to get a remission of $3 million from the revenue. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hardly supposes that a working class wife, a woman married to a man who is in receipt of an income of $500 or $600 a month, will have any money at all at the end of the month to invest. The main reason why these wives go out to work is to supplement the income of their husbands, not because they wish to invest their earnings. They find that the salaries or wages of their husbands are hardly adequate to maintain the family together. So they go out to work. Very little at all will be available for any investment. So this clause is designed to benefit a minority. This was admitted by the Minister for Trade and Industry when he introduced the last Budget Statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to know is this. Has there been a clamour for this relief? Have these ladies, who have spare cash from their earned income, made a deputation to the Minister urging this relief? Has it been shown that unless this relief is given to this minority of our taxpayers, the economy of the country will suffer, and therefore these taxpayers should be enabled to invest their spare cash? I really do not know why it has suddenly been decided that they should be given relief when there are more crying needs. I shall be coming to these crying needs later. But may I deal with the other clause, that is, clause 13 of the Bill which proposes to change the rate of income tax for the year of assessment 1982. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister, in introducing the Budget last year, spoke, in glowing terms, on the reliefs that taxpayers would benefit by the changes in the rates. However, he spoke in percentages. I am not going to speak on percentages. I am going to give, with your permission, specific examples of how these new rates are going to work. Take the case of a man earning a salary of $600, supporting a wife and two children, which is the model family for Singapore, a family of four. If he has a salary of $600 a month, he will find himself paying $1.04 more in tax under the new rates. This is because, as the Minister has said, there is no change for those in the lowest bracket. But last year there was a 10% rebate given for all taxpayers and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> unless that 10% rebate is repeated this year - and I hardly think it will be as a result of all these changes - this man will be paying $1.04 more in tax. Let us not laugh at this small figure of $1.04. It does still represent an increase of $1.04 that this man will be paying under the new rates. So for him there is no benefit. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us take the case of a man who is earning a salary of $750 per month. I am assuming in both cases that they have no other income. This man, Mr Speaker, Sir, will find himself paying an additional tax of $6.80 under the new rates. Again, it is because the tax payable remains the same for 1981 and 1982, But because there was a 10% rebate in 1981 and unless there is a similar rebate given for 1982, he will lose that and he will find himself paying an additional $6.80 by way of tax. So you have here two cases, persons drawing salaries of $600 and $750 whose taxes are being increased. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to the case of a man earning a salary of $1,000 per month with no other income. He gets a saving of $48. Well, it is still a saving, Mr Speaker, and I would not cavil at that. But I would like to compare it with the savings that will result to our taxpayers at the other end of the scale, Mr Speaker, i.e. those who are paying tax at the highest brackets. Again, I have these figures worked out for me by an accountant, and this is what I find. A businessman who has a chargeable income of $700,000 will get a saving of $45,165. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we move up to the highest bracket, those with chargeable incomes of more than $750,000. Take the case of a man who has a chargeable income of, say, $1 million, and I am sure there must be quite a few in our society today in Singapore who can claim to have a chargeable income of $1 million. And what is the saving he gets? He gets a saving of $76,175, very substantial savings. Again, I ask: has there been a cry or has there been a clamour for changes to the rates from these people who are paying tax presently at 55%? Has the Minister been told that unless he brings down the rate of tax that they are paying they are going to flee the country to other tax havens? If the Minister has been told \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> this, we would like to hear it. I myself have not heard any of these men protesting about the high rates of tax. What we do know, what we have heard - and in this I speak in support of the Members of this House who have referred to it - is over the years the cry from our less well-to-do members of our society, those who find it difficult to make ends meet in this high cost of living that we are facing today, cries from them for reliefs from the burden of income tax. They have asked for their personal reliefs to be increased. They have asked for the relief given for the support of aged parents to be increased. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is commonly assumed that the personal reliefs have remained what they were when income tax was first introduced into this country. That is a fallacy, Mr Speaker. I propose to show that there has been over the years an erosion into the personal reliefs that have been granted to our citizens. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, income tax was first introduced into our country in 1947. I remember at that time there was then some protest about income tax being introduced into the country but nevertheless it became law. And the personal reliefs that were provided by this legislation, Ordinance 39 of 1947, were these, Mr Speaker. The taxpayer got a personal relief of $3,000 and if he maintained a wife in the preceding year, he was given a deduction of $2,000 for the wife. So the two of them got a personal relief of $5,000. This was way back in 1947. I do not have to remind Members of this House of what the purchasing power of money was in those days as compared to these days. But here we have it that in 1947 the government and this was the colonial government, not our people's government, thought it right and proper that a husband and wife should have a relief of $5,000 before they began to pay tax. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This continued, Mr Speaker, right up to 1960. But before 1960 arrived, there was a change of government. In 1959, we took over the government of this place and a party which proclaimed itself to be a socialist party, to be a party for the workers, determined to do something for the poor, to uplift the workers, came to power on the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 3rd of June 1959. And as a socialist government they also affirmed their belief in the redistribution of wealth, so that wealth was more equitably shared among the citizens. But as events will show, this government which came to power in 1959, professedly a socialist government, somehow got its direction of redistribution of wealth wrong. Instead of increasing the flow of wealth to the poor and to the needy, it decreased the flow of wealth to them. In 1960, by Ordinance 77 of 1960 (and this took effect from the 1st of January 1961) the personal relief was reduced from $3,000 to $2,000 for a taxpayer. Of course, it went on to provide an additional relief by way of one-fifth of the earned income of this taxpayer. But simple arithmetic will show, Mr Speaker, that for a man who earned $400 and less and in those days, even in 1960, $300 - $400 was quite a good salary for many of our workers, a man who earned $300 - $400 a month had his personal relief reduced from $3,000 to below $3,000 in spite of the one4ifth earned income that was given in place of the reduction of $1,000. That is not all. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to having his personal relief reduced, he found that the relief, or the deduction that he was allowed, for maintaining his wife, was reduced from $2,000 to $1,000. So the net result, Mr Speaker, is: in 1947 a husband and wife had a $5,000 personal relief. In 1960, with the socialist government in power, this personal relief was reduced to $3,000 with the addition of the one-fifth earned income relief for the taxpayer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, it is a fallacy to suppose that it was a case of the reliefs not being increased. In fact, there has been a decrease. I do not want to go on and refer to the changes that were made for the children because there have been continuous reductions made as regards relief for children as well. But that is perhaps in line with the government's policy to limit families. I do not want to go into them. I merely like to confine myself at the moment, Mr Speaker, Sir, to the personal reliefs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have to go very far to see how other countries treat their poor, the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> working class. You only have to go across the Causeway, Mr Speaker. What do you find there? You find that there the taxpayer (i am talking about the man, the husband) gets a personal relief of $5,000 and his wife gets a relief of $2,000, making in all $7,000 in addition to the reliefs given to the children. Mr Speaker, Sir, may I know why there is this big disparity between our country and our neighbouring country? One would have thought that, except perhaps for the big cities, the cost of living in Malaysia is probably lower than the cost of living in Singapore. So if you were to relate your tax reliefs to the cost of living, the logical thing would be for Singapore citizens to have greater reliefs because of the higher cost of living. I would like to know from the Minister why is it thought sufficient and adequate that Singapore citizens should only have a personal relief (a husband and wife) of $3,000 when across the causeway they get $7,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see, Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will permit me, the reason for punishing wives who do not go out to work. If wives do go out to work, of course, they are separately assessed on their income. But if a wife does not go out to work, then her personal relief is reduced from $2,000 to $1,000. It was $2,000 in 1960. I would like to know why is it thought necessary that a non-working wife should be punished, a wife who elects to stay at home, who perhaps thinks that it is more important for her to look after her own children than to go and earn extra money. Why should she be punished?. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask the Minister to consider these appeals that I have made to him. Even if it does not find any fruit tonight, I hope that the Minister, with the financial year coming to an end very soon, would now withdraw these clauses and allow them to be introduced in the Budget debate for the next financial year. But even if he does not do that, I can only hope that what I have said here, and what other Members have said, will result in some changes being made, in the next Budget statement, to the personal reliefs that are being granted at the moment to our tax-payers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other relief that I wish to talk about, Mr Speaker, and that is the allowance that has been made for the support of aged parents. As has been pointed out, it was at one time $300, then it was increased to $750. $750, Mr Speaker, may sound not a small sum, or is it? But when one breaks it down, it works out to $2 per day. Does the Hon. Minister really think that you can clothe your parent, you can feed him, you can provide for his medical needs and care, you can provide a shelter over his head when he is unemployed, at $2 per day? So there are other areas where the need is far, far greater than the needs of these well-to-do-working wives who, because of their wealth and position, because their parents were able to educate them, have now got surplus cash and would like to earn more on the surplus cash itself. There are far greater needs, and I would appeal to the Minister that he should lend his ear to hearing the cries of those who find life a burden because of the rising cost of living and the other expenses that are now heaped on them in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as I have said, I do not like to look at a gift horse in the mouth and cavil at the generosity of the Minister and his Ministry in making these hand-outs to this minority of our taxpayers. But, as I have said, in duty bound to the majority of our taxpayers, I must vote against these two measures. I do not like to play Scrooge to these people who, it is proposed, should benefit from these changes in the tax structure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would welcome this if, at the same time, Mr Speaker, some relief is given to the poor, the working class, who need the money and need it very badly. Why does this Government always look after the wealthy, the privileged, and the well-to-do? I ask, Mr Speaker, don't other members of our society need looking after? There is, according to the Minister, a loss of revenue of $81 million if these changes are brought about. I can think of far better use for the $81 million than putting it back into the pockets of those who have already got enough money. Something can be done to reduce the medical charges for people who cannot afford to pay; something can be done to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> reduce the rents of HDB flats for those who do not have enough money; something can be done to help them with their transport fares. Let us try and help people who need help. That should be the first principle of a socialist government, Mr Speaker, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would say that I oppose this Bill, not in its entirety, but I certainly oppose the Bill as regards clauses 12 and 13. I have an amendment to one clause but I shall take it later. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I have heard very carefully the remarks of Members on this Bill. I know they represent the sentiments of not only the Members but also the people in the constituencies who speak to them about the personal allowances and other allowances they have under the Income Tax Act. While I would like to be sympathetic, this is not the place nor the time to debate last year's Budget statement. On this Friday's Budget statement, Members will have perhaps enough time to debate these matters. Some of the changes which may be made may make some of the comments quite irrelevant. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will only say that the philosophy of the Government in income tax legislation has been made quite clear in Budget statements over the years - that we hope to extend the tax base, that we hope as many citizens as possible will pay a certain amount of tax; those in the lower brackets pay very little indeed, but it gives them a sense of making a contribution towards the cost of the rights and privileges that they enjoy. For example, they get low cost housing and so on. Someone has to pay for that. It is not only just the rich people who can be taxed. We would like every one to make a contribution even if they do not pay the whole cost of the rights and privileges they enjoy. In the same way when we reduce income tax and are generous with $81 million of taxpayers' money, we are hoping not so much to lose revenue as to gain revenue. We expect that this will provide a greater incentive for people to work hard. We hope that we will not have taxation so high as to cause a disincentive to people from working hard. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These objectives are in all the Budget statements in the last few years, and I \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> commend to the Member for Anson that perhaps, instead of going back to 1947 to colonial days, he should just read the Budget statements for the last few years. This is all I propose to say now. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, on Friday there will be the Budget statement and after that there will be the budget debates during which time I assume some of these points will be made again. Some of them may be trite, as one of the Members has said, but I think the Treasury still listens to everything that is said here. If we cannot always grant allowances that they want, it is not because we are unsympathetic but because there is a fixed philosophy and a fixed policy for our Income Tax legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Teng Cheong):</b> Mr Speaker, just to seek an explanation from the Member for Anson.

I was talking about the income tax reliefs. I was not talking about punishment of our workers. I shall have quite a bit to say about it when we debate the Estimates for the Ministry of Labour. But at the moment I am only talking about the personal reliefs. I think the Minister is perhaps out of order when he says that I have been talking about our workers and their punishments and their conditions. I shall have quite a lot to say about it when the time comes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, the Member for Anson has said a lot just now.

Section 7 of the Property Tax Act is amended to remove the requirement that any claim for a refund of tax on an unoccupied building must be received by the Comptroller not later than six months after the end of the half year in respect of which the claim is made. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owners of existing air-conditioned commercial buildings are required to comply with the energy conservation standard, set at an overall thermal transfer value (OTTV) of 45 watts per square metre or less under the Building Regulations, with effect from 3rd August, 1979. The OTTV is a measure of the ability of a building envelope to keep out external heat. In order to encourage the owner to make the necessary renovations to comply with the energy conservation standard, clause 3 incorporates a new subsection (7A) in the Act to provide for 40% of the cost of renovation to be deductible against the annual property tax. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends section 17 of the Act to require the architect or the building surveyor to report in writing to the Chief Assessor within 15 days when a building is erected, rebuilt, enlarged, altered or improved. It also provides that where an owner fails to give notice, he will be liable to pay interest at 10% per annum on the tax payable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment in clause 5 allows the Chief Assessor to amend, without notice to the owner, the Valuation List for the following year in accordance with the notice, where notice to amend the Valuation List is given after the List for the following year has been closed for inspec- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> tion but before it comes into operation and the owner does not object to the notice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 enables the Comptroller to allot a number to, or alter the number of, any property and to require the owner to fix or replace the number of the property. The Comptroller may also fix or replace the number and charge the cost to the owner. This provision will facilitate the renumbering of highrise buildings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A related amendment in Clause 12 empowers the Minister to make regulations relating to the marking and display of the number allotted to the property. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 amends section 59 of the Act to increase the fine for any offence under the Act or its Regulations, where it is not expressly provided, from $1,000 to $5,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6, 8, 9 and 10 incorporate amendments in the Act which are consequential in nature. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Hon Sui Sen]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <br>6.43 p.m. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year will be altered from \"1981\" to \"1982\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 to 12 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>NATIONAL MARITIME BOARD (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>6.44 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Teng Cheong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the National Maritime Board Act, 1972, by introducing more flexibility in the appointment of Board members.

The ROV is responsible for the testing and licensing of drivers and driving instructors to ensure that drivers possess adequate knowledge of traffic rules and the necessary driving skills. The Traffic Police, on the other hand, identifies bad drivers on the road through enforcement of traffic rules, and if a driver has to be suspended, the ROV is asked to take action. This arrangement is not exactly ideal, especially when the priorities of the two departments do not happen to coincide from time to time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Japan, the Police Agency is responsible, amongst other duties, for all matters concerning drivers - from the day the driver starts his first driving lesson to the day he commits his first traffic offence. Under this system, the Police would come to know of the strengths and weaknesses of the drivers and, with the licensing powers vested in them, the Police would be able to correct bad driving habits. Japan has one of the most impressive records in reducing the number of traffic accidents over the past 10 years. Traffic fatalities in Japan was reduced from a high of 16,000 in 1970 to 8,000 in 1979. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having studied how the Japanese organize their Road Safety Department, we are convinced there is merit in having one single body responsible for regulating driving behaviour, including testing, licensing, education, rehabilitation and enforcement. It would certainly facilitate the formulation of effective programmes for reducing road accidents. For this reason, the Government has decided to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> transfer the testing and licensing functions of the ROV to the Traffic Police. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House proposes to amend the Road Traffic Act to enable the Minister for Home Affairs and the Traffic Police to administer those sections of the Act pertaining to the testing and licensing of drivers and driving instructors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a new section in the Bill which enables the Minister for Home Affairs to make rules for controlling the use of expressways. Expressways are designed to carry a high volume of high speed traffic and it is necessary to govern their use to get maximum value out of them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>6.51 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill standing in the name of the Minister for Communications. The Bill seeks to transfer the responsibility concerning the testing and licensing of drivers and driving instructors to the Minister for Home Affairs. In this connection, I would like to raise with the Hon. Minister a number of questions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to ask the Hon. Minister whether the Ministry of Home Affairs has the manpower to take on this added responsibility. Or is it the decision that the ROV officers responsible for the testing and licensing of drivers and driving instructors be transferred to the Ministry of Home Affairs? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon. Minister mentioned the Japanese system of reward and punishment. I would like to seek clarification whether, in introducing this amendment, there is not also a system of reward for drivers and driving instructors and not just one of punishment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the amendment is to achieve the integration of both regulation \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and enforcement, hopefully to reduce road accidents in Singapore. May I know from the Hon. Minister the number of road accidents including fatalities over the past few years? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I merely rise to ask by way of clarification from the Hon. Minister as to what class of traffic that he proposes to prohibit or restrict from using the expressways. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the first question from the Member for Serangoon Gardens is on the manpower requirement to administer these functions in the Ministry of Home Affairs. He has guessed it correctly that the officers from the ROV, who are presently administering these functions, will be transferred to the Ministry of Home Affairs to help the Traffic Police to carry out these functions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is about the Japanese system. I do not remember mentioning in my speech about reward and punishment, although what he said is true. The Japanese do have a reward and punishment or carrot-and-stick method to encourage drivers to drive more carefully on the roads as a way to reduce traffic accidents. This is currently being looked into by the Traffic Police. I think it is premature for me at this stage to go into details. When the study is completed, I have no doubt that the Minister for Home Affairs or the Traffic Police will be making a public announcement on this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question he asked is about traffic accidents over the past few years. The number of fatal accidents over the past few years are as follows: \n  <pre>\r\n\r\n                          Number of\r\n\r\n      Year             fatal accidents\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      1975                   287\r\n\r\n      1976                   286\r\n\r\n      1977                   271\r\n\r\n      1978                   278\r\n\r\n      1979                   234\r\n\r\n      1980                   259\r\n\r\n      1981                   273\r\n\r\n</pre> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of number of people killed as per 10,000 persons based on population in Singapore, it had reduced from 1.3 per 10,000 persons in 1975 to 1.1 in 1981. It has improved, but this does not mean that there is no room for further improvement. The Traffic Police and the ROV will continue to find ways to make our roads as safe as possible. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson wishes to seek clarification on the types of prohibition that the Minister for Home Affairs would wish to have. I think one example is the stopping and parking of vehicles along the expressways. This will be prohibited unless it is an emergency. Another example is to prohibit pedestrians running across an expressway. This is all for the safety of the users of roads, I hope I have clarified that point. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Ong Teng Cheong]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year will be changed to \"1982\".

Under the Act, the statutory boards can only act as agents for the Urban Redevelopment Authority. All revenues collected from car park operations should, therefore, be credited into URA funds. In practice, the revenues collected are retained by the respective statutory boards who are responsible for maintaining their car parks. This Bill proposes to regularise the practice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently a vehicle owner alleged to have committed a parking offence under the Act is obliged to furnish particulars of the driver at the relevant time. Occasionally, the owners supplied the names of overseas residents and this has made enforcement difficult and impractical. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill proposes to impose the liability on the vehicle owner for the parking offence. However, a number of defences are available to the owner. He can avoid liability if he proves that his vehicle was stolen or illegally taken or used at the material time or if he can satisfy the Superintendent, Car Parks Division, or the court that he was not the driver who actually committed the offence. There is a similar provision in the Road Traffic Act for traffic offences. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to empower the Superintendent to remove any vehicle found abandoned in a parking place to a place of safety. The owner shall pay all expenses incurred in the removal, and the fines and charges for any parking offences. The Superintendent may sell or otherwise dispose of the vehicle if it is not claimed by the owner within a specified period of time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other major aspect of the Bill is to allow the Minister to utilise any land or premises owned or occupied by any statutory board as a parking place on terms and conditions to be agreed upon between the Minister and the statutory board. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>7.04 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to seek some points of clarification from the Hon. Minister with regard to car parking spaces. Under clause 3 of the Amendment Bill, it is proposed to utilize any land or premises which may be lawfully acquired or appropriated for use as parking places and also for the collection of fees. Here, I would like to seek clarification from the Hon. Minister. With the levies collected from the building complexes where inadequate car parking spaces are provided, whether such moneys collected have been used to improve the parking facilities in certain areas where there is extreme traffic congestion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the proposed multi-storey car park within the CBD, could the Minister enlighten the House whether there are any plans to provide more car parks in areas like Coleman Street and along stretches of Balestier Road where owing to inadequate parking spaces vehicles are compelled to park along the roadside? As the Minister will recall, Balestier Road was widened several years ago to provide for a three-lane traffic on either side. But after the widening of the road, at least one lane on either side is used for parking. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to clarify whether there is any proposal to develop areas for heavy vehicle parking. As can be seen from the number of accidents that had occurred, some vehicles collided into the rear of heavy vehicles parked on the main road. With all the levies collected, one would have thought that some of these funds should be channelled into improving car parking facilities, especially in congested areas. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, again I rise to ask the Minister by way of clarification two matters. I see by clause 4 that a new subsection is being added to the Act which provides that: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No licensee shall collect any fees or charges for the use of any private parking place unless the fees or charges have first been approved by the Superintendent.' \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 442</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> May I know what is the rationale for this amendment? Is it perhaps to provide that the licensee of any private parking place will not compete with the Government or the statutory board which provides parking places by charging less than what the Government or statutory board might charge? Why should there be a restriction on what fee the licensee should collect if it is his own land and which he wishes to utilize as a parking place for vehicles? I suspect it is perhaps that he should not compete with the Government in this business. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Speaker, I am at a loss to understand why it is necessary for an owner to furnish, by way of a statutory declaration, to the Superintendent the name and address of the person in charge of the vehicle at the time the offence is committed? Statutory declarations have to be stamped if they are to be used in a court of law unless there is an exemption for this. That means whoever makes a declaration will have to pay a $2 fee for this statutory declaration. I would like to know why it is necessary that there should be a statutory declaration. Would it not be sufficient for the owner to give this information by way of a letter, i.e. give it in writing, and make it punishable if the information is false? I am sure it must be provided in the Act somewhere that whoever furnishes false information shall be subject to prosecution in court. That is sufficient sanction for an owner to give true information. So why the imposition of a statutory declaration at an additional cost of $2 to the owner? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng (in Mandarin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the traffic system and the parking system in Singapore are almost second to none in South-east Asia. This could be attributed to the officers in charge of these matters. Road communication and the parking systems are praised not only by the people of Singapore but also by tourists who are equally impressed by our transport and parking systems. Therefore, if there is anyone who has nothing better to do than to find fault with the systems, it can only be expected of a caviller. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have something to say about the coupon system. There is room for improvement. Sometimes motorists, in using the coupons, unwittingly make mistakes. They may tear the wrong tab from the parking coupon; invariably this is not done on purpose. But when the car park attendant finds anything amiss with the parking coupon, he would invariably not allow the motorist to explain but issues a notice of an offence to the motorist. There should be some flexibility in enforcing any regulations. When Singaporeans are enjoying moderate economic affluence, there should be no need for them to cheat the Government of a small amount. I hope the Minister will take note of this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem is that motorists are obliged to use the coupons when they park their cars. However, these coupons are not available at every car park. Since the URA gets so much revenue from parking and is so affluent, why does it not use this revenue to install parking meters at its car parks? If parking meters are used, firstly, it will obviate the occurrence of making mistakes in parking coupons, and secondly, it will reduce the demand on labour. It is of benefit to Singapore when she is faced with labour shortage. It will economise on the use of labour. Therefore, where possible, parking meters should be installed in car parks. I hope the Minister will consider what I have suggested. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the point raised by the Member for Toa Payoh about using car park levies to build more car parks either in the Central Business District or in areas where there is a shortage of car parks, I would like to inform him that the Urban Redevelopment Authority has proceeded with this policy. For example, in the Central area, several multi-storey car parks have been planned. Piling work is already in progress to provide additional car parks to relieve the parking shortage. In areas outside the CBD where there is a shortage of car parks or where road congestion has been experienced, the URA is looking for suitable places to build additional surface car parks. The URA is also looking into this question of providing parking places for heavy vehicles. In fact, this has been looked into. Sometime ago some of the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> fringe car parks have already been utilized for the parking of heavy vehicles or container trucks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Anson made two points. His first point is why should private car park charges be approved by the Superintendent of Car Parks. I can assure the Member that this is not to prevent the owners from competing with the URA. Rather, it is the other way round. A lot of private car parks in big shopping complexes are owned by the developers. They can therefore charge exorbitant parking fees for utilizing the car parks. The point is that since they own the car parks, and if they were permitted to charge any rate they like, they can raise the parking fee. For example, if a shopping centre is well located, is very popular, and a lot of people patronise the shopping complex, then if the developer is unscrupulous, he will try to get as much revenue as possible from the car park by charging high parking fees. On the other hand, if he wants to get something out of the shopkeepers operating in the shopping complex, he may close the car park at, say, 9.00 p.m., thus preventing the people from parking there. So the need to control private parking fees by the Superintendent is to ensure that car park owners do not take undue advantage by charging high parking fees, thereby making the life of the tenants or owners of the shops very miserable. The Government imposes this requirement to ensure that the Superintendent of Car Parks has a certain measure of control over the management and the parking fees of private car parks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that when an offence has been committed the owner of the vehicle is required to make a statutory declaration. Let me say that it is not in every case that we ask the owners of vehicles to make a statu;ory declaration. But I think the hon. Member for Anson has made a very pertinent point. If the owner provides the particulars of the driver to the Superintendent of Car Parks by means of a letter, instead of making a statutory declaration, it would be very difficult for the URA to take the owner to court because the owner can always claim that he is not the one who wrote the letter. But if he has made a statutory declaration, it would be very \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> difficult for him to say, \"I am not the one who made the statutory declaration. I am not responsible for it.\" I am obliged to the Member for Anson for bringing up this point. It really supports the particular provision that a statutory declaration is, in fact, required. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point raised by the Member for Khe Bong about tearing the wrong tabs from the parking coupon, instruction has been given to the Superintendent of Car Parks to take a very lenient view in such cases. If a genuine mistake has been made, the motorist can always explain it to the URA officer who may decide to reduce or even waive the fine. From the records, in the last few months, of the number of those who went to the URA to explain their mistakes made in the coupons, 60% to 75% of them were given a reduction in the fines. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point about installation of parking meters instead of using parking coupons, we have, in fact, already made a study of parking meters before we introduced coupon parking. From our study we find that parking meters are easily damaged by vandals, or they often malfunction. If I remember correctly, parking meters were used in Penang, but because they were not functioning well the authorities had to remove them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have covered all the points raised by Members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam</b> rose - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, under Standing Order No. 44 you are only allowed to speak once to any question. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> But may I elaborate on what I said about the statutory declaration arising out of the reply given by the Hon. Minister? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right, but make it short. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am indebted to you, Mr Speaker. The Road Traffic Act itself provides for owners to furnish information of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> drivers by letter, and I am not aware of the Police having encountered hundreds of cases of owners claiming, later on, that they did not write that letter. My real point is that in the normal course a statutory declaration must be stamped - I think the Hon. Minister misses that point - and that would mean an additional cost of $2. would the Minister consider exempting the statutory declaration from stamping? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Finance decides on the exemption of a stamp fee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Teh Cheang Wan]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year will be altered from \"1981\" to \"1982\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 to 4 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 4, line 8, to leave out \"lessor\" and insert \"owner\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Attorney-General, this is a technical amendment to standardize the terms used in the Parking Places Act with those of existing law. In the Hire-Purchase Act the person who owns the goods under a hire-purchase agreement is referred to as \"owner\" and not as \"lessor\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 5, line 28, after \"section 3\", to insert\" and to any direction by the Minister\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment involves section 16 which deals with payment of revenue collected from car park operations into the funds of the Urban Redevelopment Authority. The URA manages several fringe car parks on behalf of Government. As the fringe car parks are owned by Government, the revenue collected from these car parks should rightly be paid to Government. The proposed amendment provides for the payment of revenue collected from Government-owned car parks to Government although URA may be operating them on Government's behalf. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported with amendments; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PLANNING (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>7.30 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Teh Cheang Wan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been no comprehensive revision of the Planning Act since it first came into force in February 1960. A thorough review of the Act has, therefore, been carried out to weed out obsolete provisions and to update requirements and procedures so as to facilitate and control physical development in Singapore. The Amendment Bill is intended to clarify \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ambiguities in the existing Act and to streamline planning practices to cater for our rapid pace of development. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major amendment is to empower the Competent Authority to require developers to retain at least 30% of the floor area of any development project under a single owner for a period of 10 years from the date of the latest grant of a temporary occupation licence. During the 10 years, developers will only be allowed to sell this portion en bloc: to a single buyer so that there will be a substantial owner to ensure the proper maintenance and management of the building. This requirement is not expected to cause any hardship to developers but will assist in upgrading the standard of building maintenance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a new requirement as the URA has imposed it as a condition for its sale of land for commercial development. The condition will be applied to large commercial buildings, which are those with total office and shopping floor areas of 5,000 sq metres and above. These include shopping complexes, office buildings, mixed shopping and office buildings and hotel buildings with shops. For mixed office/shopping/residential complexes, the condition will apply to the shops and office units, but not the residential units. For hotel buildings with shops, the condition will apply to the shopping units only if the shopping area exceeds 5,000 sq. metres. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developers or owners will be allowed to indicate, within two years of building plan approval, the areas to be designated under the 30% floor area to be held under one title. Even areas not contiguous to one another can be included under the required 30% floor space for retention under one title. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Amendment Bill also seeks to empower the Competent Authority to defer consideration of an application for planning permission to develop land if, as a result of unavoidable circumstances, the decision on the application cannot be made within the specified period. There are occasions when the Competent Authority is unable to make a definite decision on a planning application because the area \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> concerned is still under study to optimize its development. In such cases the authority concerned will speed up its studies to facilitate an early decision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Competent Authority will also be empowered to grant planning permission for a limited period only. This is necessary in certain cases where permanent permission cannot be granted. For example, temporary permission is necessary for numerous change of use cases where it is not appropriate to grant permanent permission in view of the type of structures for the proposed use, the nature of usage and future developments affecting the areas concerned. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing section 29 of the Act enables the Government to levy a development charge on any appreciation in the value of any land arising from an alteration to the Master Plan made at the request of the developer. The proposed new section 29 (1) (d) is to enable development charges to be collected for alterations to the Master Plan made by the Competent Authority at its five-yearly review of the Master Plan. During the review the Competent Authority may find it necessary to rezone certain areas for more intensive uses, although no applications for such development have yet been received. This would confer a windfall in land appreciation on the land owners unless the Government is able eventually to tax part of the appreciation in the form of development charge. The land owners would be required to pay the development charge only if they subsequently submit applications to develop the land in accordance with the new Master Plan zones. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed section 29 (1) (e) enables development charge to be collected on a modification of the planning permission in respect of an existing development, if such modification permits additional plot ratio or floor area resulting in an appreciation in land value. For example, in the case of a site that has been altered from residential to commercial zone for a development at, say, a plot ratio of 2.5, development charge would have been collected up to the approved plot ratio of 2.5. If the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> developer subsequently proposes additional floor areas which would bring the plot ratio up to, say, 2.8, additional development charge for the floor areas represented by the further increase in plot ratio of 0.3 would be payable. This is equitable since if the developer had proposed a plot ratio of 2.8 in the first instance, he would also have paid development charge up to this amount. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed section 29 (1) (o is to levy development charge for approved development which is not in conformity with the Master Plan when planning permission is granted but does not require a formal alteration to the Master Plan. An example of such a case would be when ancillary shops or other non-residential uses of commercial value are to be allowed within a residential development on Residential Zone land. Another example is when the commercial or office areas are to be allowed to exceed the level prescribed in the Master Plan for industrial or warehouse developments in Industrial or Warehouse Zones. Without such flexibility in the planning process, the proposed developments would not be permissible. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 28 is to empower the Minister to make rules to provide for the payment of a small deposit for early determination of the development charge and initiation of the rezoning process. This is to ensure that the applicant is serious about proceeding with the project. The deposit will form part of the development charge if the project proceeds but will be forfeited if the applicant subsequently abandons the proposal, making the rezoning exercise an abortive one. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 32 empowers the Minister to make rules to provide for the refund, wholly or in part, of the development charge paid by any person under certain circumstances and to prescribe, by notification in the Gazette, the rate of interest for development charges which are paid by instalments.

Such road improvements are vital in order to reduce the accident rate. The PWD road widening programme over the last few years was as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1979. Widening of Yio Chu Kang Road from Sembawang Hills Circus to Track 24. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1980.

However, I have not been able to accede to the request as the Alkaff Mosque is affected by the comprehensive redevelopment of the Kaki Bukit area. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last two decades, the Government has been undertaking extensive redevelopment and renewal programmes. Religious institutions and places of worship including mosques, churches and temples affected by public redevelopment schemes are demolished together with all other structures in the areas concerned. Similarly, the Alkaff Mosque has to be demolished with other structures as the Kaki Bukit area undergoes comprehensive redevelopment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, 70% of the population of Singapore live in HDB new towns and estates. More people will be moving into new towns as redevelopment proceeds. Places of worship and other essential social amenities have to be relocated to the population centres they serve. Consequently, within the new towns, land is set aside for the building of mosques, churches and temples. As the facilities in new towns are all properly planned, the new mosques built, like the new residential buildings, are better than the old ones which they replace. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several discussions with the Muslim MPs and MUIS, my Ministry has agreed to allocate a site for the construction of a new mosque to replace the Alkaff Mosque. This site is at the junction of Bedok North Road and Bedok Reservoir Road. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD FLATS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(FIRE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr J.B.

This, however, does not mean that HDB's buildings do not comply with fire safety requirements for highrise dwelling units. The HDB buildings are designed according to different stringent fire safety standards. For example, the layout of lobbies and staircases allows smoke to disperse quickly. Design features together with the use of non-combustible building materials prevent the spread of fire from one flat to another. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the HDB exercises strict control over renovations and alterations to flats. Good design and construction, stringent management regulations and their effective enforcement together with regular maintenance of the premises combine to make HDB buildings among the safest in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the large number of HDB flats to house 70% of the total population, the outbreak of fire in HDB buildings has been extremely rare. In every case, the fire has been confined to the unit itself. The main causes of fire outbreak are traced to use of faulty gas appliances, unauthorised electrical extension, storage of combustible materials in the flat or carelessness, such as throwing lighted cigarette butts out of the window into the flat below. Where the fire is caused through carelessness or misuse by the flat dwellers, they are responsible for the cost of repairs. Where the cause of fire cannot be traced, the HDB will bear the expenses for restoring the flat to its original condition. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1982/19820303/19820303-HA-0410465.htm\">OPINION, Appendix to Oral Answer to Question No. 1 (Cols. 465 - 480)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 473</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1982/19820303/19820303-HA-0410481.htm\">Annex - THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVIEW COMMITTEE, SALARY PROGRESSION OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICERS ON NEW SCALE, NEW SALARY SCALES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICE, NEW SALARY SCALES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, NEW SALARY SCALES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICE (FOREIGN) AND FOREIGN SERVICE (Cols. 481 - 492)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br>   \n </body>\n</html>", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
