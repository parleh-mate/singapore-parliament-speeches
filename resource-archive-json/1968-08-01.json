Firstly, in his\r\n\r\nMinisterial   statement  yesterday,   the   Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  said  that  the  Government  propose   to\r\n\r\nintroduce  two Superscale posts, 'A' and  'B'  into\r\n\r\nthe  civil service. In the case of Superscale  'B',\r\n\r\nthe salary would be $2,700 a month, and Super-scale\r\n\r\n'A'  $3,000  a month. This salary is  more  than  a\r\n\r\nMinister's  salary, which is only $2,500  a  month.\r\n\r\nGenerally  speaking,  the  responsibilities  of   a\r\n\r\nMinister  are  greater than those  of  a  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary.

I  think\r\n\r\nthey  carry  a  salary  of $100  a  month  and  are\r\n\r\nprobably held part-time by farmers. It would not be\r\n\r\ntrue to say that there is a general upward revision\r\n\r\nof  Division IV salary scales. What has happened is\r\n\r\nthat  the number of salary scales has been reduced,\r\n\r\nwith  the result that some people benefit by having\r\n\r\na longer salary scale so that they will continue to\r\n\r\nenjoy  more increments.

In my view, these Superscale\r\n\r\nofficers  already  have enough  to  live  well  and\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  more properly  look  after  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the lower-income groups. In the case of\r\n\r\nthe  latter,  there  should  be  some  increase  in\r\n\r\nsalary. This is only right and proper because we in\r\n\r\nSingapore practise parliamentary democracy. We must\r\n\r\nrespect these people who are not so well off. Those\r\n\r\nofficers who are getting $2,000 or $3,000  a  month\r\n\r\nalready  have  enough. Many  people  sleep  by  the\r\n\r\nroadside and many do not have enough to eat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can these top civil servants ask for more\r\n\r\npay? We Members of Parliament get only $500 a month\r\n\r\neach  and we have to contribute to the party funds.\r\n\r\nHow can we live on this small pay? Of course, I too\r\n\r\nwant  to  ask  for  a pay rise and  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister will be sympathetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, Members of Parliament do\r\n\r\nnot  get  salaries  or pay.

Let me  give  him  an\r\n\r\nexample  of how pay in the top level of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  compares with pay in commercial  firms.  A\r\n\r\nmanaging   director  of  a  reasonably   prosperous\r\n\r\ncompany in Singapore may get a total pay of $10,000\r\n\r\nper  month  or more, which is four times  what  the\r\n\r\nPermanent  Secretary of a Ministry is getting.  The\r\n\r\nwork  of  the Permanent Secretaries is more onerous\r\n\r\nand more responsible. To say that they are overpaid\r\n\r\nwhen they get only one-quarter of the pay of people\r\n\r\nof  equivalent ability in the private sector is,  I\r\n\r\nthink, completely misleading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases which we are recommending for the\r\n\r\ntop posts in the civil service, in my view, are  in\r\n\r\nthemselves   inadequate  to  do  justice   to   the\r\n\r\nsituation.  But we expect that people will  make  a\r\n\r\ncareer  in the civil service not entirely  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of making money and becoming rich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  I  want to make it clear that  I  do  not\r\n\r\ngrudge   Government's  proposal  to  increase   the\r\n\r\nsalaries of Superscale officers. My point  is  that\r\n\r\nat  this juncture when the Government is asking the\r\n\r\nprivate sector to make a big sacrifice, is it  wise\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government to increase  the  salaries  of\r\n\r\nthose who are well provided?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> If we want to attract and\r\n\r\nretain talent in the civil service, this is what we\r\n\r\nmust do.

Firstly, regarding the mode  of\r\n\r\nsalary conversion, I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  he is aware of the following: One officer,\r\n\r\n\"A\",  who is married and another officer, \"B\",  who\r\n\r\nis not married are now on the same basic salary. As\r\n\r\nofficer  \"A\" is married he draws a higher  variable\r\n\r\nallowance  and  therefore his total emoluments  are\r\n\r\ngreater than those of officer \"B\". According to the\r\n\r\nCommission's mode of conversion, officer  \"A\"  will\r\n\r\nmove to a higher step in the new salary scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should officer \"B\" get married after the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  the  recommendations   of   the\r\n\r\nSalaries Commission Report, he will still be  on  a\r\n\r\nlower  step  vis-a-vis officer \"A\".  How  does  the\r\n\r\nMinister intend to correct this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, may I know the reason why the date of\r\n\r\nimplementation of the recommendations of the Report\r\n\r\nof the Salaries Commission is 1st January, 1969?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I thought I made it clear in\r\n\r\nmy  speech  yesterday that we  do  not  accept  the\r\n\r\nCommission's   recommendation   in    respect    of\r\n\r\nconversion,  having  a  difference  of   conversion\r\n\r\nbetween  the  married and unmarried officers.  They\r\n\r\nwill  all convert on the same basis, that  is,  the\r\n\r\nbachelor  officer will convert in the same  way  as\r\n\r\nthe  married  officer. In effect, he  will  get  an\r\n\r\nincrease in total pay on this exercise costing  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers a quarter of a million dollars a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the date of implementation 1st January,\r\n\r\n1969?  If  we  regard our decisions  as  final  and\r\n\r\nrefuse  to  hear representations, we  can  probably\r\n\r\nimplement it from 1st October, 1968. But we want to\r\n\r\nhear  the  views of unions, associations and  other\r\n\r\npeople and, therefore, we have to give them time to\r\n\r\nmake  their  representations.

In  such  an  event,  the\r\n\r\nemployer  is penalised in that he either loses  the\r\n\r\nservices of his employees for the duration of their\r\n\r\nbusiness for reasons quite unconnected with his own\r\n\r\nestablishment,  or  he incurs additional  costs  by\r\n\r\nhaving  to  employ additional staff  to  cover  the\r\n\r\nduties  of his absent employees. This, it  will  be\r\n\r\nappreciated, is most unsatisfactory.

However, thorough  and  time-consuming  investigations must necessarily  precede\r\n\r\nsuch proceedings. This has caused long delays which\r\n\r\nare  frowned  upon  both  by  the  unions  and  the\r\n\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendments to the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Ordinance, particularly in the\r\n\r\ncontext  of  management rights, have  evoked  fears\r\n\r\namong  some  trade  unionists.  The  principle   of\r\n\r\ncollective  bargaining  is  in  no  way   impinged.\r\n\r\nCollective bargaining is of the essence in  a  free\r\n\r\nand  democratic society but vital management rights\r\n\r\nmust  not  be  eroded  if  we  are  to  create  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  climate of stability  for  investors  to\r\n\r\ncome\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin.  There  are, however, built-in safeguards,  for\r\n\r\nsafeguards  there  must be  if  abuses  are  to  be\r\n\r\nminimised both by employers and trade unions.  Some\r\n\r\nwise  person  has  stated that private  rights  may\r\n\r\nbecome  public  wrongs. There  is,  therefore,  the\r\n\r\nurgent   necessity  for  both   parties   to   make\r\n\r\nresponsible   decisions  - decisions   which    are\r\n\r\ncompatible  with the well-being of the country.  It\r\n\r\nis, therefore, in the interest of all concerned  to\r\n\r\nensure that rights are related to functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers have their functions just as trade\r\n\r\nunions  have,  and  it  is  imperative  that  their\r\n\r\nrespective  rights have a, correlation  with  their\r\n\r\nrespective  functions. The amendments  embodied  in\r\n\r\nthis Bill are obviously designed to correct wrongs,\r\n\r\nbalance    rights   and   functions   and    equate\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  so that an independent  Singapore\r\n\r\ncan  move  through the crucial years ahead  without\r\n\r\ncoming to grief. The Government will, however, keep\r\n\r\na  very  close watch on the workings of the law  on\r\n\r\nindustrial relations in the light of the amendments\r\n\r\nthat  are  being  made. If there  are  abuses,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will not hesitate to make the  necessary\r\n\r\nadjustments. We hope, however, that employers  will\r\n\r\nexercise their rights with responsibility, and that\r\n\r\nthey  will  take a far-sighted view of  their  real\r\n\r\ninterest. It is in their long-term interest not  to\r\n\r\nabuse, as they can, this Bill, because then I think\r\n\r\nthere can be no expectation on their part that  the\r\n\r\ntrade unions themselves will act with the restraint\r\n\r\nand responsibility which they have so far shown. We\r\n\r\nhope, therefore, that employers will exercise their\r\n\r\nrights with responsibility and that it will not  be\r\n\r\nnecessary to take corrective action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objectives of these two pieces of legislation\r\n\r\n-  the  Employment  Bill and the Central  Provident\r\n\r\nFund  (Amendment) Bill - are, as it should be  very\r\n\r\nclear  by  now, to help Singapore as an independent\r\n\r\nnation  not only to meet the storms ahead but  also\r\n\r\nto  ensure that we ride them successfully.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  co-operation  will be  forthcoming  from  the\r\n\r\nemployers in this regard and that the trade  unions\r\n\r\nwill make the necessary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadjustments  in  face  of the  new  situation.  The\r\n\r\ndelineation of management functions and trade union\r\n\r\nfunctions will do away with the \"Heads I win, tails\r\n\r\nyou  lose\" attitude. Let us resolve to replace this\r\n\r\nwith \"Heads we all win, tails we all lose\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\ncomment  on  the  Industrial Relations  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill which is now being read for the Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Secretary-General of the National Trades\r\n\r\nUnion Congress, I am very pleased to note that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has incorporated into the Bill  some  of\r\n\r\nthe  suggestions made by the N.T.U.C. When we  were\r\n\r\nfirst  informed by the Government of its  intention\r\n\r\nto  amend the Industrial Relations Ordinance, 1960,\r\n\r\nwe were very much taken aback by the rather drastic\r\n\r\nscope and extent of the amendments intended by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  We  then strongly represented  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  its  objectives  could  still  be\r\n\r\nachieved by modifying its intended amendments so as\r\n\r\nto  minimise  the adverse effects on  the  workers.\r\n\r\nEvidently,  as  it  appears  from  the  Bill,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has given heed to our representations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n<br><br>3.26 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, it was intended that the power of\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Arbitration Court to  reinstate  in\r\n\r\nemployment  an  employee who  has  been  wrongfully\r\n\r\ndismissed  was  to be confined to cases  where  the\r\n\r\nemployee  had  been allegedly dismissed  for  trade\r\n\r\nunion  activities.  We  pointed  out  that  such  a\r\n\r\nprovision restricting the power of reinstatement in\r\n\r\nemployment would give rise to many malpractices  or\r\n\r\nabuses by unscrupulous employers. At present,  such\r\n\r\nemployers   are  deterred  from  dismissing   their\r\n\r\nemployees  summarily without justification  because\r\n\r\nof  the  protection  given to employees  under  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrdinance.   It   would  have   been   unduly   and\r\n\r\nunnecessarily demoralising to an employee  to  have\r\n\r\nbeen  deprived  of  the  protection  given  to  his\r\n\r\nemployment    under   the   Industrial    Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  Not  every one who has been  wrongfully\r\n\r\ndismissed by his employer can claim to be  a  trade\r\n\r\nunion officer or a member actively engaged in trade\r\n\r\nunion  work. Paragraph (d) of clause 8 of the Bill,\r\n\r\nhowever,  takes care of cases of dismissal  arising\r\n\r\nout   of   circumstances  other   than   those   in\r\n\r\ncontravention  of  section 79 of the  Ordinance  by\r\n\r\namending  section  34 thereof to provide  for  such\r\n\r\ncases  of  dismissal to be referred to the Minister\r\n\r\nwho  may  himself, or through the  Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nLabour,  inquire  into  the dismissal  and  who  is\r\n\r\nempowered to order the reinstatement or payment  of\r\n\r\ncompensation  to an employee who is found  to  have\r\n\r\nbeen wrongfully dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also happy to note that clause 7 of the Bill\r\n\r\nhas  given  effect  to the N.T.U.C, representation\r\n\r\nthat   the   provision  cutting  across  collective\r\n\r\nagreement  should not be unduly wide. The  original\r\n\r\nintention  of the Government was to enact  that  no\r\n\r\ncollective agreement should contain provisions with\r\n\r\nregard  to  terms  and conditions of  service  more\r\n\r\nfavourable  to  employees than those  contained  in\r\n\r\nPart  IV of the Employment Act, 1968. The N.T.U.C.,\r\n\r\nhowever,  pointed out that since the  intention  of\r\n\r\nsuch  an  amendment  was to stimulate  and  promote\r\n\r\nindustrial  expansion in Singapore and  that  since\r\n\r\nthe   existing  collective  agreements  relate   to\r\n\r\nemployees in existing firms and factories,  it  was\r\n\r\nonly  logical  and reasonable that such  a  drastic\r\n\r\namendment should be made applicable only  to  firms\r\n\r\nor  factories  which have not yet been established.\r\n\r\nWe  note  here with satisfaction that an acceptable\r\n\r\ncompromise  has  been  made by  the  Government  in\r\n\r\nproposing  that only employees in certain specified\r\n\r\nindustries  which are established on or  after  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1968, are to come within the scope of  the\r\n\r\nproposed  section  24A.  We  also  note  that   the\r\n\r\nproposed  section  24A provides that  the  proposed\r\n\r\nrestrictions on collective agreements governing the\r\n\r\nemployees within the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspecified industries are to be valid for the  first\r\n\r\nfive  years  of  the  existence  of  the  specified\r\n\r\nindustries. Such measures, though they  may  appear\r\n\r\nto  be  rather drastic to employees engaged in  the\r\n\r\nnew  industries,  are necessary  to  stimulate  new\r\n\r\nindustries  and will then lead to the  creation  of\r\n\r\nmore job opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are happy that the Government has taken\r\n\r\ninto    consideration   our    representation    by\r\n\r\nincorporating  some  of our  suggestions  into  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Bill, as I have just  mentioned,\r\n\r\nwe cannot help noticing that the Bill also contains\r\n\r\nprovisions   which   appear  to  be   unnecessarily\r\n\r\nunfavourable to workers. For instance, in clause  4\r\n\r\nof the Bill, by which a new subsection (3) is to be\r\n\r\nadded  to the existing section 16 of the Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations Ordinance, it is provided that any  trade\r\n\r\nunion  representing  subordinate  staff  may   seek\r\n\r\nrecognition  in respect of employees in  managerial\r\n\r\nor  executive  positions or serve  a  notice  under\r\n\r\nsection  17  of the Ordinance in respect  of  those\r\n\r\nemployees.  We are apprehensive of the position  of\r\n\r\nsuch trade unions at present representing employees\r\n\r\nwho may be considered to be in managerial executive\r\n\r\npositions.  These  unions,  whose  members  consist\r\n\r\nmainly  of  employees  in  non-managerial  or  non-executive positions, have been given recognition in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  employees in managerial  or  executive\r\n\r\npositions  and have concluded collective agreements\r\n\r\non behalf of such employees. If such unions are not\r\n\r\nto be allowed to continue to represent employees in\r\n\r\nmanagerial or executive positions on the expiry  of\r\n\r\nthe  existing  collective  agreements,  then  these\r\n\r\nemployees  would  be  placed in  a  most  untenable\r\n\r\nposition.  It  must  be emphasised  here  that  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Ordinance gives protection  to\r\n\r\nworkers  only if they are members of a trade  union\r\n\r\nwhich has been accorded recognition by an employer.\r\n\r\nWhere  an  employee does not belong  to  any  trade\r\n\r\nunion,  or belongs to a trade union which  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  accorded recognition by his employer, he  has\r\n\r\nno    effective    remedy   or   redress    against\r\n\r\nvictimisation by his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployer under the Industrial Relations Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position is complicated by the fact that\r\n\r\nthere  are few trade unions to cater for managerial\r\n\r\nor  executive employees. In fact, there are, as far\r\n\r\nas  I  know, only two unions catering for employees\r\n\r\nin managerial or executive positions in the private\r\n\r\nsector.  It is inconceivable that these two  unions\r\n\r\nwould  be  in  a  position to  cater  for  all  the\r\n\r\nemployees  in  managerial  or  executive  positions\r\n\r\nengaged  in  the various industries in the  private\r\n\r\nsector in Singapore. Even if they are, there has to\r\n\r\nbe  an inevitable lapse of time before a union  can\r\n\r\nbe  given  recognition in respect of  employees  in\r\n\r\nmanagerial  or  executive positions who  have  been\r\n\r\nformerly  represented by a trade  union  consisting\r\n\r\nmainly    of    non-managerial   or   non-executive\r\n\r\nemployees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we appreciate the principle that employees\r\n\r\nin  supervisory positions should belong  to  unions\r\n\r\ndifferent  from those of the subordinate employees,\r\n\r\nwe are rather apprehensive that, in view of such  a\r\n\r\nradical   change   to  prevailing  practices,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has not made any transitional provisions\r\n\r\nto  safeguard the interests of employees who are in\r\n\r\na  managerial position and who happen to be members\r\n\r\nof  the  trade unions representing mainly employees\r\n\r\nin  non-executive positions. If such managerial  or\r\n\r\nexecutive employees have nothing to fear from their\r\n\r\nemployers, they would never have found it necessary\r\n\r\nto  be  members  of  the trade unions  representing\r\n\r\nemployees   in   non-managerial  or   non-executive\r\n\r\npositions. It is a fact which should be duly  noted\r\n\r\nby  the  Government when implementing tile proposed\r\n\r\namendment to the Industrial Relations Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I wish to comment on\r\n\r\nconcerns clause 5 of the Bill which seeks to  amend\r\n\r\nsection  17  of  the Ordinance. A  new  subsection,\r\n\r\nwhich  seeks  to make certain managerial  functions\r\n\r\nnon-negotiable between an employer  and  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion   representing   his  employees,   has   been\r\n\r\nproposed.  The managerial functions  refer  to  the\r\n\r\nrights of an employer in relation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto (a) promotion, (b) transfer, (c) employment, (d)\r\n\r\nretrenchment, (e) dismissal and reinstatement,  (f)\r\n\r\nassignment  or allocation of duties. We must  point\r\n\r\nout  that  it  seems most dangerously  lopsided  to\r\n\r\nenact   that   such   managerial   functions    are\r\n\r\nexercisable  at  the  absolute  discretion  of  the\r\n\r\nemployer  without providing for adequate safeguards\r\n\r\nfor   the   workers.  In  the  first  place,   such\r\n\r\nmanagerial  functions exist in common  law  and  it\r\n\r\nappears rather unnecessary and superfluous to  give\r\n\r\nstatutory  protection to such managerial functions.\r\n\r\nBut   granted  that  it  is  necessary   from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's viewpoint to give statutory protection\r\n\r\nto  these  managerial  functions,  the  failure  to\r\n\r\nprovide  ample safeguards for the workers does  not\r\n\r\nappear to be justifiable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be more specific, in respect of the management\r\n\r\nfunctions  pertaining to promotion and recruitment,\r\n\r\nno  attempt has been made to spell out the criteria\r\n\r\nor  limits  within which an employer can reasonably\r\n\r\nexercise his rights. Thus it is open to an employer\r\n\r\nto adhere most rigidly to the publicised conditions\r\n\r\nfor  promotion or employment of persons he does not\r\n\r\nlike and to waive such conditions on any pretext in\r\n\r\nrespect of applicants favoured by him. It all boils\r\n\r\ndown  to whether an employer can he relied upon  to\r\n\r\nexercise  his management functions in  good  faith.\r\n\r\nAlthough the provisions pertaining to the rights of\r\n\r\nan employer to transfer, retrench, dismiss or order\r\n\r\nhis  employees contain certain safeguards  for  the\r\n\r\nemployees,  such safeguards are effective  only  if\r\n\r\nthe assumption that an employer always acts in good\r\n\r\nfaith is justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this point, we in the N.T.U.C., being used to\r\n\r\nseeing  the uglier side of the employer's face,  do\r\n\r\nnot  share  the  .optimism of the  Government  that\r\n\r\nemployers  can be depended on to behave responsibly\r\n\r\nand  decently towards their workers. We  are  fully\r\n\r\naware  that  industrial or commercial organisations\r\n\r\nare  profit-making organisations and that it is  in\r\n\r\nthe  own interest of the management, whether it  be\r\n\r\nprofessional management divorced from the ownership\r\n\r\nof tile business or otherwise, to employ the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbest  talents available or to deploy staff  in  the\r\n\r\nmost advantageous manner. But the fact remains that\r\n\r\nemployers  and  managers are  only  human  and  may\r\n\r\noccasionally  behave in an irrational and  perverse\r\n\r\nmanner. Our concern is that such behaviour may have\r\n\r\nadverse repercussions for the workers and that  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance does not seek to safeguard the rights  of\r\n\r\nthe workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour  in  his  speech yesterday referred  to  the\r\n\r\nincidence of 389 work-stoppages involving a loss of\r\n\r\n1,284,029 man-days during the period from  1960  to\r\n\r\n1967.  The impression that appears to be  given  is\r\n\r\nthat    the   trade   union   movement   has   been\r\n\r\nirresponsible in the past and cannot be relied upon\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  work-stoppages of such  magnitude\r\n\r\nwould  not  occur  again so  as  not  to  prejudice\r\n\r\nSingapore's future industrial expansion  programme.\r\n\r\nI  wish  to  point  out  that  work-stoppages  must\r\n\r\nnecessarily arise out of trade disputes and that it\r\n\r\ntakes  two parties to make a trade dispute.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  fair  and  correct to blame the occurrence  of\r\n\r\neach  and every dispute on the union involved.  For\r\n\r\nin  the  first place, if an employer can be trusted\r\n\r\nto  give a fair deal to his workers, it would never\r\n\r\nhave  been  necessary for the Government  to  enact\r\n\r\nemployment   legislation  such  as  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to point out that the reference to\r\n\r\nthe  period,  1960 to 1967, whether intentional  or\r\n\r\notherwise,  was extremely misleading,  to  say  the\r\n\r\nleast.  The  fact is that the Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance was enacted in 1960 to meet the need  for\r\n\r\npromoting  peace  and stability  in  the  field  of\r\n\r\nindustrial relations in Singapore. It takes  a  few\r\n\r\nyears for the Industrial Relations Ordinance to  be\r\n\r\nin  operation  before its effect  becomes  evident.\r\n\r\nThis is substantiated by the published data of  the\r\n\r\nStatistics Department pertaining to work-stoppages.\r\n\r\nFor the period 1964 to 1967, the second half of the\r\n\r\nperiod referred to by the Minister, there were only\r\n\r\n94 world-stoppages involving the loss of 11,715 man-days  which do not amount to even one per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthe total for the whole\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperiod.  The only conclusion I can draw  from  this\r\n\r\ncomparison   of  figures  is  that  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations   Ordinance   has   become   increasingly\r\n\r\neffective  during the last few years  even  without\r\n\r\nthe gift of managerial functions to employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even now as we are discussing this Bill, there\r\n\r\nare  employers  who  are  seeking  to  exploit  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the Bill to their  best  advantage,\r\n\r\nregardless  of  the intention of the Government.  I\r\n\r\nhave  been  given to understand that one commercial\r\n\r\norganisation, which has previously applied for  the\r\n\r\nextension  of a collective agreement to  which  the\r\n\r\ntrade  union concerned has indicated its agreement,\r\n\r\nnow  seeks to oppose its own application before the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration Court. The reason  for  its\r\n\r\naction  appears to be that the employer anticipates\r\n\r\ncertain   provisions  to  be   superfluous   in   a\r\n\r\ncollective  agreement in view of  the  Government's\r\n\r\ngift  of management functions. Such being the case,\r\n\r\nworkers  cannot be blamed for feeling nervous  that\r\n\r\nsome employers are clearing the decks for wholesale\r\n\r\nexploitation of workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is heartening to know that the\r\n\r\nGovernment has given an assurance that it will  not\r\n\r\nhesitate to cane the naughty employers, it  is  our\r\n\r\nhope  that the Government will not be found wanting\r\n\r\nin  decisiveness  and firmness  when  it  comes  to\r\n\r\ndealing  with recalcitrant employers.

But  apparently  the  former\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour has quite  suddenly  come  to\r\n\r\nthink that the workers have gone out of hand and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust be straightened up by harsh administrative and\r\n\r\nlegal  sanctions. It is also apparent that  he  has\r\n\r\nnot  given a factual account of the real situation.\r\n\r\nThose  who  are deeply involved and concerned  with\r\n\r\nindustrial  relations will readily say that  labour\r\n\r\nand  management  have matured since  the  turbulent\r\n\r\nyears of the 1950s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Labour Department sources we gather that\r\n\r\nthere  are  fewer and fewer strikes and  lock-outs.\r\n\r\nThe  number  of work-stoppages for each year  since\r\n\r\n1955 are as follows: -      \r\n\r\n                   \r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n               1955 - 275       1962 - 88\r\n\r\n               1956 -  29       1963 - 47\r\n\r\n               1957 -  27       1964 - 39\r\n\r\n               1958 -  22       1965 - 30\r\n\r\n               1959 -  40       1966 - 14\r\n\r\n               1960 -  45       1967 - 30\r\n\r\n               1961 - 116\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  the  first five months of 1968 there have  been\r\n\r\nonly two work-stoppages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there were 18 more strikes, in 1959 than\r\n\r\nin  1958,  there were fewer man-days lost  in  1959\r\n\r\nthan  in  1958 due to work-stoppages. In the  1950s\r\n\r\nthe    work-stoppages   were   mainly   politically\r\n\r\nmotivated,  and so were those in the  early  l960s.\r\n\r\nWhatever  the laws might have been, they would  not\r\n\r\nhave  made any difference to the trend and line  of\r\n\r\naction  in those years. However, since those  days,\r\n\r\nindustrial relations have gradually progressed  and\r\n\r\nfound their own balance, and restrictive laws  will\r\n\r\nnot  at all be conducive to the further development\r\n\r\nof better industrial relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial relations have made a marked\r\n\r\nimprovement  in  the last few years,  and  this  is\r\n\r\neloquently stated in the Singapore Year Book  1966,\r\n\r\nwhich  is published by authority. In Chapter Eight,\r\n\r\npage 189, it states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The marked improvement in industrial relations\r\n\r\nnoted  in 1965 continued throughout the year. There\r\n\r\nwere  only 14 work stoppages during the year -  the\r\n\r\nlowest since 1961, the peak year for work stoppages\r\n\r\nwhen there were 116 strikes. For the first time, at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  the  year there were  no  outstanding\r\n\r\nstrikes.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same chapter, in page 200, it states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The two noteworthy features in the fields of\r\n\r\nindustrial relations were firstly, that there  were\r\n\r\nonly  14 work stoppages - the lowest since  1961  - and,  secondly, the short duration  of  these  work\r\n\r\nstoppages. Nine stoppages lasted from 1 to 5  days,\r\n\r\nfour from 6 to 40 days and only one lasted for more\r\n\r\nthan  40  days,  which  altogether  involved  1,288\r\n\r\nworkers  as  against 3,374 in 1965  and  43,584  in\r\n\r\n1961.  The  number of man days lost as a result  of\r\n\r\nthe 14 work stoppages was 17,807.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, surely there have been disputes - disputes on union recognition, dismissal and\r\n\r\nretrenchment.   Some   were   settled   by   direct\r\n\r\nnegotiations,  some  were  settled  in  the  Labour\r\n\r\nDepartment, and some were settled in the industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court. The cases  brought  up  to  the\r\n\r\nLabour Department were settled under the very  eyes\r\n\r\nof  the former Minister for Labour, and in some  of\r\n\r\nthe  cases, the employees' objections were  upheld.\r\n\r\nIt  was  true  also that the Industrial Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt  has  ruled in favour of the trade unions  in\r\n\r\nsome   dismissal  and  retrenchment  cases.   These\r\n\r\ndecisions   of  the  Labour  Department   and   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration Court prove the point  that\r\n\r\nemployers   can  abuse  their  powers,   and   that\r\n\r\nemployees  should be allowed to protest, to  object\r\n\r\nand  to  dispute  the actions taken  by  management\r\n\r\nwhich  they consider are prejudicial to  their  own\r\n\r\ninterests. The very fact that an employer can  act,\r\n\r\nintentionally  or  unintentionally,   against   the\r\n\r\npresent or future interests of his employee, should\r\n\r\nbe  convincing enough to any man with common  sense\r\n\r\nand,  more, with a sense of justice, to accept  the\r\n\r\nplea  that an aggrieved employee should be  allowed\r\n\r\nto  have  the  full protection of his  trade  union\r\n\r\nagainst  the  high and heavy-handed action  of  his\r\n\r\nemployer.  If  we  accept the  concept  of  a  free\r\n\r\nsociety,  and a society of law and order,  then  we\r\n\r\nmust accept accordingly the democratic right of  an\r\n\r\nindividual to protest, to object and to dispute  an\r\n\r\naction  which  he  considers  is  against  his  own\r\n\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I firmly believe that an aggrieved employee\r\n\r\nshould be given the right to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseek  justice in the Court, and it would be a shame\r\n\r\nto  clip  the  powers of the Industrial Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt. The Industrial Arbitration Court is a  sound\r\n\r\nindustrial relations procedure, and any attempt  to\r\n\r\ncircumscribe the jurisdiction and function  of  the\r\n\r\ncourt  is  unacceptable. The Industrial Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt  has  obtained  the respect  of  the  workers\r\n\r\nbecause  it operates on sound principles.  In  this\r\n\r\nconnection, I quote Chapter Eight, page 202 of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Year Book, 1966:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The principle upon which the Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court operates is that of offering  to\r\n\r\nemployers and trade unions of employees an award or\r\n\r\ndecision  which will fairly and justly reflect  not\r\n\r\nonly the interests of both parties to an industrial\r\n\r\ndispute  but also to the community as a  whole,  as\r\n\r\nwell as the economy of the Republic.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these words of the Labour Department in\r\n\r\nmind,  it  is hard to understand the move  to  take\r\n\r\naway the powers of the Industrial Arbitration Court\r\n\r\nto  hear  cases on dismissal and retrenchment,  and\r\n\r\nthe  contingent  powers to reinstate  dismissed  or\r\n\r\nretrenched employees and grant suitable reliefs. It\r\n\r\nis   imperative  to  note  that  all  dismissal  or\r\n\r\nretrenchment   cases  that  came  up   before   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration Court were either  disputes\r\n\r\narising   out   of  the  operation  of   collective\r\n\r\nagreements  or  disputes jointly  referred  to  the\r\n\r\ncourt,  or  disputes directed to the court  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister, and included in the latter category would\r\n\r\nbe  cases which his Ministry had failed to  mediate\r\n\r\nsuccessfully. In all these cases, the trade  unions\r\n\r\nhave more than accepted the awards of the Court. In\r\n\r\nfact,  they  have come to respect the  court  as  a\r\n\r\nplace  of wisdom and justice. Notwithstanding  this\r\n\r\nrealisation,  the  trade  unions  have   discreetly\r\n\r\nsettled their disputes out of court. The records of\r\n\r\nthe  court  show this attitude. In 1967, the  Court\r\n\r\nheard four dismissal cases, three union recognition\r\n\r\ncases and five retrenchment cases; and in 1966  the\r\n\r\ncourt   heard  13  dismissal  cases,   five   union\r\n\r\nrecognition cases and two retrenchment cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Department, however, still have the\r\n\r\nmonopoly   of  dismissal  and  retrenchment   cases\r\n\r\nreferred by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrade  unions for conciliation and arbitration.  Of\r\n\r\nthe  702 disputes referred to the Labour Department\r\n\r\nin  1966  for  conciliation,  34.9  per  cent  were\r\n\r\ndismissal  cases; and according to the same  Report\r\n\r\n(Command  7  of 1968), \"Retrenchment  was  again  a\r\n\r\nminor cause amounting to only 6.6 per cent.\" Is the\r\n\r\nformer  Minister for Labour suggesting  that  trade\r\n\r\nunions are also terrorising him, his officials  and\r\n\r\nthe court when they were defending their members in\r\n\r\nthe  Labour  Department and in the  court?  Is  the\r\n\r\nformer Minister for Labour claiming that there is a\r\n\r\nfree-for-all   situation  with  organised   workers\r\n\r\nterrorising the employers? I think it is a  figment\r\n\r\nof his imagination. If anything is true, it is that\r\n\r\nhe  possesses the quality of a fiction story-teller\r\n\r\nquite common among some reporters who rub in highly\r\n\r\nsensational ideas to make a no-story a tall story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to point out to the Minister that the\r\n\r\ngeneral  consensus of opinion of workers, not  just\r\n\r\ntrade union members, is that clause 5 and clause  8\r\n\r\nof  the  Industrial Relations (Amendment)  Bill  to\r\n\r\namend  section 17 and section 34 of the  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations Ordinance, 1960, is an open invitation to\r\n\r\nwield  the  axe. However, much depends on  who  the\r\n\r\nMinister  is,  and if the Bill is passed,  I  think\r\n\r\nworkers will have to cross their fingers, and  wait\r\n\r\nand  see how he plays his hand in dealing with  the\r\n\r\nbully-boys amongst unenlightened employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attitude, rightly or wrongly, arouses the\r\n\r\nhopes  and  fears of workers, because the  proposed\r\n\r\nlabour legislation is brimming with prejudice.  The\r\n\r\nfear  created by the new labour legislation in  the\r\n\r\nworker is that if he is unfortunate to be sick  for\r\n\r\ntoo  long,  he will not get a vacation  leave,  and\r\n\r\nprobably  he  will leave his family destitute.  The\r\n\r\nfear created in the worker is that if he proves, in\r\n\r\nthe  opinion of his employer, to be not  so  useful\r\n\r\nany  more, he will lose his job. The worker is told\r\n\r\nif  the  new  labour legislation is not introduced,\r\n\r\nthere is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprospect  of  a grim future for him, and  when  the\r\n\r\neconomic  situation becomes bad, unlike  money  and\r\n\r\nmanagerial men, he is stuck fast here. It is  fear,\r\n\r\nfear, fear without limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it would be more sensible to invoke the\r\n\r\npatriotic  spirit to work hard to be more efficient\r\n\r\nand   productive,   and  to  make   the   necessary\r\n\r\nsacrifices.  I think the workers must  be  made  to\r\n\r\nfeel  they  are  important,  useful  and  effective\r\n\r\ndigits  in society. They must be allowed to  decide\r\n\r\nthe  future of the country, and feel that  they  do\r\n\r\nnot  get  the worst deal, whether the circumstances\r\n\r\nare  favourable  or poor. Some may be  inclined  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  that the workers in Singapore  have  never\r\n\r\nhad  it so good, and if things are going to be bad,\r\n\r\nthey  must have the worst. This is not the  correct\r\n\r\nattitude  to  take  towards the workers.  I  firmly\r\n\r\nbelieve that there will be greater participation by\r\n\r\nthe  workers in the affairs of the undertakings  if\r\n\r\nthey  are  to understand most clearly, to give  out\r\n\r\nthe most and receive the best in return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common assertion that it is the employers'\r\n\r\nright   to   make  business  decisions  free   from\r\n\r\ncollective bargaining is based on property  rights.\r\n\r\nSuch  a contention is valid as far as the right  to\r\n\r\norganise  and  to direct machinery,  materials  and\r\n\r\nmoney  is concerned, but never men. As far  as  men\r\n\r\nare  concerned,  the property basis  of  management\r\n\r\ncarries  no legal duty, and no legal compulsion  to\r\n\r\nco-operate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An authority on industrial relations has this to\r\n\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'While property rights carry with them a power of\r\n\r\ndisposition  of goods, they do not carry  an  equal\r\n\r\npower  to  use  those goods if the co-operation  of\r\n\r\nothers  is  necessary  to that  use.  Co-operation,\r\n\r\nwithout  which the property right is reduced  to  a\r\n\r\npower  of disposition, cannot be commanded. It  can\r\n\r\nbe  won  only  by consent. And there  is  no  legal\r\n\r\ncompulsion upon the workers to cooperate. There  is\r\n\r\nno  legal  statement  of the  terms  on  which  co-operation must take place. The definition of  those\r\n\r\nterms  is  left directly to those parties involved,\r\n\r\nand  there is nothing in law to stop the union from\r\n\r\ndemanding as the price of the co-operation  of  its\r\n\r\nmembers   a   voice   in  some  matter   previously\r\n\r\nindependently determined by management.  Since  the\r\n\r\nproperty  rights do not mean that one  has  command\r\n\r\nover others, management\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay  find it essential to share its authority as  a\r\n\r\nmeans   of  inducing  co-operation,  in  order   to\r\n\r\nmaintain  the  value of a going  business.  Over  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  time,  it  becomes customary  to  share\r\n\r\nauthority  in order to win co-operation in  certain\r\n\r\nrecognised  areas  of  business  decisions  -   for\r\n\r\nexample,  wages,  hours, or perhaps  the  speed  of\r\n\r\nassembly lines.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  only  institution where a man can be  managed\r\n\r\nand ordered about is the military institution where\r\n\r\nauthoritarian  relationship  exists   by   consent.\r\n\r\nHowever,  a military-like regime can never  run  an\r\n\r\nundertaking successfully for long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have strongly emphasised the need for greater\r\n\r\nparticipation  by  workers  in  the  management  of\r\n\r\nundertakings,   because  this   is   a   world-wide\r\n\r\nphenomenon. The International Labour Organisation's\r\n\r\nRecommendation   130   lays  down   that   workers'\r\n\r\nrepresentatives should participate in  the  framing\r\n\r\nof  personnel  policy and the  solution  of  social\r\n\r\nquestions within the undertaking. The problems that\r\n\r\nrequire the workers' participation cover conditions\r\n\r\nof  work, welfare services, safety, employment  and\r\n\r\ndiscipline,  training  and  a  range   of   matters\r\n\r\ninvolving    the   workers   and   having    social\r\n\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is clear now that the introduction of\r\n\r\nclause  5  to  prohibit  collective  bargaining  on\r\n\r\nprocedures   on  promotion,  transfer,  employment,\r\n\r\ntermination,    dismissal,    re-employment     and\r\n\r\nassignment  of  work is a denial  of  the  workers'\r\n\r\nright   to   participate  in  the   affairs   which\r\n\r\nimmediately  affect his life and that  of  society.\r\n\r\nLet  me be explicitly clear that trade unions  have\r\n\r\nnever   desired  to  arrogate  to  themselves   the\r\n\r\nfunctions of management in directing the affairs of\r\n\r\nthe enterprise. Labour only wants the establishment\r\n\r\nof  rules  for  management to follow in  exercising\r\n\r\ntheir  functions. This must necessarily be so,  for\r\n\r\nworkers  will suffer if the undertaking is  managed\r\n\r\ninefficiently  or  may  have  to  suffer   if   the\r\n\r\nundertaking is to be run more efficiently.  In  the\r\n\r\nformer case, it is clear how all those involved  in\r\n\r\nthe enterprise will suffer, but in the latter case,\r\n\r\nbecause  of the workers' own productivity, some  of\r\n\r\nthem  might  be  dispensed with. Arising  from  the\r\n\r\npoints I have just made, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink  no self-respecting worker and trade unionist\r\n\r\nwill  agree to the matters listed in clause 5 being\r\n\r\nwithdrawn from the field of collective bargaining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 8 of the Bill seeks to\r\n\r\nremove  from the Industrial Arbitration  Court  the\r\n\r\npower to hear and decide upon claims by unions  for\r\n\r\nthe  reinstatement of employees and  to  order  the\r\n\r\nreinstatement where the court is satisfied that the\r\n\r\ndismissal  was wrongful. Perhaps we in  this  House\r\n\r\nshould  try  to trace the events that  led  to  the\r\n\r\namendment that was made to the previous section  38\r\n\r\nof  the Industrial Relations Ordinance (now section\r\n\r\n40  of  the Reprints Supplement). A glance  at  the\r\n\r\noriginal provisions contained in section 38 of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  seems  to indicate that  the  court  had\r\n\r\nextremely  wide powers. Section 38 gave  the  court\r\n\r\nthe  power to make an award on any matter or  thing\r\n\r\nfor  the purpose of settling a trade dispute or  of\r\n\r\npreventing  any further trade dispute  even  though\r\n\r\nthe matter or the thing was not one of the specific\r\n\r\nreliefs claimed by the parties before the Court. My\r\n\r\ntrade  union colleagues, who had occasion to appear\r\n\r\nbefore  the Industrial Arbitration Court  in  cases\r\n\r\nfor  reinstatement, had on every occasion been told\r\n\r\nby  the  senior  representative  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nEmployers  Federation, who had argued  against  the\r\n\r\nunions, that the court did not possess the power to\r\n\r\nreinstate.  His  main argument  was  that,  in  the\r\n\r\nabsence  of  a  specific provision  empowering  the\r\n\r\ncourt  to  order the reinstatement of  a  dismissed\r\n\r\nworker,    the   court   could   not   order    any\r\n\r\nreinstatement. Also, he had, on occasion,  compared\r\n\r\nthe   powers  given  to  industrial  tribunals   in\r\n\r\nAustralia  where  the tribunals  were  specifically\r\n\r\ngiven  the  power to reinstate and he had proceeded\r\n\r\nto  emphasise that without such a power  the  court\r\n\r\ncould not reinstate any dismissed employee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present provision contained in section 40 of\r\n\r\nthe Reprints Supplement of the Industrial Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance  was a direct result of certain proposals\r\n\r\nput  forward by the National Trades Union  Congress\r\n\r\nfollowing  the adoption of a resolution urging  the\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   amend   certain  sections  of  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  Ordinance, particularly those  contained\r\n\r\nin section 38.

There ought to be a provision\r\n\r\nhere  ensuring  that  before the  Court  makes  any\r\n\r\naward,  especially in relation to  a  matter  which\r\n\r\ndoes not come within the specific relief originally\r\n\r\nclaimed by any party, the Court must first bear  in\r\n\r\nopen  Court  the  submissions thereon  of  all  the\r\n\r\nparties  who  are  eventually to be  bound  by  the\r\n\r\naward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A specific clause ought to be included here\r\n\r\nstating  that the Court has the power to order  the\r\n\r\nreinstatement  of  employees  no  matter  for  what\r\n\r\nreason they have been dismissed if for any good and\r\n\r\nsufficient reason the Court thinks it fit that such\r\n\r\nemployees should be reinstated.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was as a result of this proposal that the\r\n\r\nGovernment decided to amend section 38 (now section\r\n\r\n40  of  the  Reprints Supplement) giving the  court\r\n\r\nspecific  powers  to reinstate an employee  who  is\r\n\r\ndismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already stated my objection to clause 5,\r\n\r\nbut my opinion on clause 8 is quite neutral because\r\n\r\nit  does  not  matter  very  much  whether  general\r\n\r\ntermination cases are dealt with in the  Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court  or  the  Ministry  of   Labour.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  give  my support not to  withdraw  the\r\n\r\njurisdiction  of the District Court to  hear  cases\r\n\r\nsubject  to section 79 of the Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at this juncture I wish to make\r\n\r\nan  observation  on the futility of  clause  5  and\r\n\r\nclause  8. Even if the matters listed in  clause  5\r\n\r\nare  non-industrial  matters,  as  defined  in  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations  Ordinance,  there   can   be\r\n\r\ndisputes  not  arising  from  the  terms   of   the\r\n\r\ncollective   agreement.  Such  disputes   are   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  bound to be referred to  the  Minister\r\n\r\nunder  clause 8. That is the defect I wish to point\r\n\r\nout. I come now to the crucial point\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere  it  may be necessary to take extra  remedial\r\n\r\nlegislative  measures to make it unlawful  to  take\r\n\r\nindustrial  action  over \"non-industrial  matters\".\r\n\r\nSad  is  the  day  when more restrictive  laws  are\r\n\r\nadopted. Let there not be such a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill must not\r\n\r\nbe  considered  in isolation. It  is  to  be  taken\r\n\r\ntogether  with the Employment Bill and the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund (Amendment) Bill as each is part and\r\n\r\nparcel  of a deal designed to achieve new norms  in\r\n\r\nindustrial  relations,  terms  and  conditions   of\r\n\r\nservice and to increase domestic savings which will\r\n\r\nbenefit our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already explained fully that,\r\n\r\nin connection with the Employment Bill, the purpose\r\n\r\nis  to strengthen our economy and ready us to  face\r\n\r\nthe economic challenges ahead. The other Members of\r\n\r\nthis  House,  leaders  of  industry,  commerce  and\r\n\r\nlabour have expressed their views. Academicians and\r\n\r\neconomists  have  studied and debated  it  and  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  consensus  of opinion has  been  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  not only right but  indeed  has  no\r\n\r\nother  choice.  It  has to take stringent  measures\r\n\r\neven at the risk of being unpopular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill sets\r\n\r\nindustrial relations in its true perspective.  This\r\n\r\nBill may appear to the superficially minded and the\r\n\r\nsuperficially  inclined  as  a  move  against   the\r\n\r\ninterests of labour, but in reality it is  not  so.\r\n\r\nWhat  it seeks to do is to rationalise the position\r\n\r\nto  prevent in-roads into functions which  properly\r\n\r\nbelong  to management. These inroads, whether  made\r\n\r\nconsciously   or   unconsciously,   have   led   to\r\n\r\naberrations in industrial relations which  in  turn\r\n\r\nhave  dampened the incentive for some employers  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  in  business, have made them hesitate  to\r\n\r\nexpand  business  and, worst  of  all,  discouraged\r\n\r\npotential new investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the function of management is\r\n\r\nto  manage and workers must accept this fact. It is\r\n\r\nonly under\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  conditions that we can hope to  maintain  the\r\n\r\npresent  buoyancy  in  our economy  and  promote  a\r\n\r\nclimate of stability for further expansion  of  our\r\n\r\neconomy so that more jobs can be made available for\r\n\r\nour  people.  The  Government's  measures  are   an\r\n\r\nattempt to establish a balance between the needs of\r\n\r\nthe  workers  and the requirements of entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nin  the  context  of  our  national  interest.  The\r\n\r\nCentral   Provident  Fund  (Amendment)  Bill,   for\r\n\r\nexample, will enable our workers to own houses  and\r\n\r\nhave a stake in our country. Although the employers\r\n\r\nwill have to pay more under the new rate of Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund contributions, I am sure none  will\r\n\r\ngrudge  the extra payment when the money is put  to\r\n\r\ngood use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise not to\r\n\r\noppose  the Industrial Relations (Amendment)  Bill;\r\n\r\nneither  do I completely support it. It is  obvious\r\n\r\nthat  the Government has good intentions for moving\r\n\r\nthe  amendments.  I think the Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill has the same motivations  as  the\r\n\r\nnew  Employment  Bill.  It  would,  therefore,   be\r\n\r\nsuperfluous  for  me  to  go  into  the  whys   and\r\n\r\nwherefores  for the introduction of this  amendment\r\n\r\nBill.  But I will not be discharging my duty  as  a\r\n\r\nMember  for  Parliament with  labour  interests  at\r\n\r\nheart  if  I  do  not  point out the  objectionable\r\n\r\nportions  of the Bill as they appear to  me.  These\r\n\r\namendments seek to vest in the management  absolute\r\n\r\npower  and  a completely free hand in dealing  with\r\n\r\nthe  employees without any real safeguards for  the\r\n\r\ninterests and welfare of the workers. Such are  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  this  Bill  that  even   the   most\r\n\r\nscrupulous of employers would be stupid not to take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  them  to  the  detriment  of   their\r\n\r\nemployees.  In the overall interest of the  working\r\n\r\nclass,  the  dangers  and threats  posed  to  their\r\n\r\nsecurity  by  this amendment Bill must be  squarely\r\n\r\nfaced in the hope that employers would also rise to\r\n\r\nthe  occasion and not abuse the absolute managerial\r\n\r\nfunctions handed to them in this \"silver statute\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to seek a further amendment to this Bill,\r\n\r\nbut it is obviously not possible because neither I,\r\n\r\nnor  my  colleagues  from the  unions,  have  given\r\n\r\nnotice.  However,  I would like  to  bring  to  the\r\n\r\nnotice  of  the Minister the necessity  of  further\r\n\r\nprotective measures in the provisions of  clause  5\r\n\r\nof this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I refer to new subsection (2) (d) of section\r\n\r\n17  of  the Industrial Relations Ordinance relating\r\n\r\nto   termination  of  service  on  the  grounds  of\r\n\r\nredundancy  and reorganisation. I do  not  wish  to\r\n\r\nimply  that all employers are anti-labour;  neither\r\n\r\nare  they pro-labour. It therefore stands to reason\r\n\r\nthat  there  must be some employers  who  will  not\r\n\r\nhesitate  to exploit the provisions quite blatantly\r\n\r\nand,  under  the  guise  of reorganisation,  create\r\n\r\nredundancy  where none exists in order to  retrench\r\n\r\nsome of their employees. Here I would like to quote\r\n\r\nan  example to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour  who  was  an  editor  of   a\r\n\r\nnewspaper before. He knows that if a sub-editor  is\r\n\r\nmade to read the proof, at the stone, there will be\r\n\r\nredundancy  in  the proof-reading department.  That\r\n\r\nkind  of reorganisation cannot be justified.  If  a\r\n\r\npart of the proof-reading job is taken over by  the\r\n\r\n\"stone\"  editor, the proof-readers will lose  their\r\n\r\njobs.  I  do not doubt that the Minister knows  all\r\n\r\nabout  this.  There  is nothing  in  this  Bill  to\r\n\r\nprevent   such   employers  from   engaging   their\r\n\r\nrelatives  or  friends  a few  months  after  their\r\n\r\nalleged   reorganisation  to  fill  the   positions\r\n\r\npreviously held by the retrenched employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no intention to take\r\n\r\nsteps  to  negative this clause, but I do  ask  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to qualify this clause with  protective\r\n\r\nsub-clauses  so  that  no  employer  may  be   able\r\n\r\nunjustly  to exploit it. As the proposed  amendment\r\n\r\nnow  stands,  an employer may effect a retrenchment\r\n\r\nand  the  union  may  only  discuss  the  terms  of\r\n\r\nseverance  pay  for those retrenched employees  who\r\n\r\nhave more than three years' service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Bill, which was read a Third time\r\n\r\nyesterday, makes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovision  for  the  payment of  such  retrenchment\r\n\r\nbenefits should the union and the employer agree on\r\n\r\nthe benefits to be paid. The issue can obviously be\r\n\r\nreferred  to  arbitration. It is the criterion  for\r\n\r\nthe  termination of service which only is precluded\r\n\r\nfrom the purview of negotiation or arbitration.  In\r\n\r\nsome  ways, it may be even cheaper for an  employer\r\n\r\nto retrench his serving employees and save whatever\r\n\r\ncompensation is due to them, because the amount  so\r\n\r\npaid   up  will  be  more  than  recouped  by   the\r\n\r\nsubsequent  savings from employing new and  cheaper\r\n\r\nlabour.  Further, the employer can always  retrench\r\n\r\nemployees  every  two years and eleven  months  and\r\n\r\nthereby pay no severance benefits. Such a situation\r\n\r\nis  not as far-fetched as the Government would have\r\n\r\nus   believe.   It  is  because  of  the   distinct\r\n\r\npossibility of such malpractices and abuses that  I\r\n\r\nurge the Government to provide more safeguards  for\r\n\r\nworkers. The protective clauses I seek are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(1) Where the union feels that the retrenchment is justified, both employer and union make a joint application to the Arbitration Court to determine the issue. This should be determined by the President sitting alone. While the issue is under the Court's jurisdiction, the employer may go ahead with the implementation of the re-organisation or retrenchment. The Court's decision, when handed down, will determine whether the retrenchment was justifiable or not.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, it will neither cost the employer anything nor\r\n\r\nwill  retrenchment be delayed, but such a provision\r\n\r\nwill prevent abuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(2) Where retrenchment has been effected and\r\n\r\nupheld  by  the court or where the  union  has\r\n\r\nagreed  that it was justifiable, the  employer\r\n\r\nis  free  to  engage  new staff  to  fill  the\r\n\r\nvacancies within six months from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndate of  retrenchment. If the employer  finds\r\n\r\nit  necessary to recruit staff, then he  shall\r\n\r\noffer  the  appointments  to  those  who  have\r\n\r\nalready been retrenched.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not believe that any enligtened\r\n\r\nemployer    will   object   to   these   protective\r\n\r\nprovisions,  because he will not abuse  the  powers\r\n\r\nthat  are,  as the Minister has said,  restored  to\r\n\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of dismissal, there is an avenue\r\n\r\nfor  appeal under the pro-visions of the Employment\r\n\r\nBill  when  it becomes law. The dismissed  employee\r\n\r\nmay  appeal to the Minister through his  union.  If\r\n\r\nthe  employer  feels that the dismissal  cannot  be\r\n\r\njustified  and  in  order to obviate  the  risk  of\r\n\r\nministerial  intervention,  he  will   effect   the\r\n\r\ndismissal  as \"retrenchment\" it is only calling  it\r\n\r\nby    another   name   -   on   the   pretext    of\r\n\r\n\"reorganisation\". This can happen. As the amendment\r\n\r\nstands  today, the Minister will be in no  position\r\n\r\nto  intervene  and wield the much  publicised  \"big\r\n\r\nstick\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are my reasons for asking the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to  consider  giving  some   form   of\r\n\r\nprotection  to  workers  by  means  of  restrictive\r\n\r\nclauses designed to prevent abuse of the provisions\r\n\r\nby employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.23 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I am of the view that the introduction of  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations (Amendment) Bill is mainly for\r\n\r\nthe   purposes  of  creating  a  climate  that   is\r\n\r\nconducive to investments in Singapore. It will also\r\n\r\nallay the doubts and fears of foreign investors who\r\n\r\nintend  to  set  up  business  here.  If  a   wrong\r\n\r\nimpression  is  created, it will be detrimental  to\r\n\r\nour policy of encouraging more foreign investors to\r\n\r\ncome here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of our pro-labour policy of\r\n\r\nindustrial   peace  with  justice,  the  industrial\r\n\r\nrelationship between employer and worker  has  been\r\n\r\nvery  good  in  the  last  few  years.  Many  trade\r\n\r\ndisputes  have been resolved by arbitration.  There\r\n\r\nhas  been  a  marked reduction  in  the  number  of\r\n\r\nstrikes and trade disputes. We must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntry  to  maintain  the  present  good  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  employer and worker. This  Bill  is  quite\r\n\r\nfair  to  both  employer  and  worker  because   it\r\n\r\nprovides that the transfer of any employee must not\r\n\r\nbe detrimental to his existing terms and conditions\r\n\r\nof  service. It will therefore prevent unscrupulous\r\n\r\nemployers from exploiting their employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that in the case of an\r\n\r\nemployer  who  abuses  his  rights  by  sacking  an\r\n\r\nemployee, the latter can, within a month, appeal to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Labour for a withdrawal  of  the\r\n\r\nnotice   of   termination  of   service   and   for\r\n\r\nreinstatement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the trade union leaders in the\r\n\r\nNational  Trades  Union  Congress  look  after  not\r\n\r\nmerely the interest of labour but also that of  the\r\n\r\nnation  as  a  whole.  In  doing  so,  they  seldom\r\n\r\ninterfere with the rights of employers. They merely\r\n\r\nadvance advisory opinions and this is not construed\r\n\r\nas interference with the rights of employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the introduction of this Bill will\r\n\r\nnot  affect  our  policy of industrial  peace  with\r\n\r\njustice  and  that this policy will be  maintained.\r\n\r\nThe  present  era is not the time for employers  to\r\n\r\nincrease  their  wealth  at  the  expense  of   the\r\n\r\nworkers.  The employers should treat the  employees\r\n\r\nfairly  and, at the same time, the employees should\r\n\r\nwork  harder. It is only in this way  that  we  can\r\n\r\ncontribute to our economic development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this Bill for all these reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.29 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  with the enactment of the new Employment Bill\r\n\r\ninto  law,  a new chapter in the history of  labour\r\n\r\nlegislation in the Republic will have been  written\r\n\r\nwith  the complete overhaul of three previous  Acts\r\n\r\nwhich  were  legacies  of  the  colonial  past.  It\r\n\r\nengenders   a  fertile  and  attractive  investment\r\n\r\nclimate  for  both local and foreign  capital.  But\r\n\r\neven  with  these  new  terms  and  conditions   of\r\n\r\nemployment as set\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  in the new Bill, investors will still be  wary\r\n\r\nabout  investing  in  our Republic  unless  certain\r\n\r\nmanagement functions such as employment, promotion,\r\n\r\ntransfer, dismissal, retrenchment and reinstatement\r\n\r\nare  restored to the rightful party. These are  the\r\n\r\ninalienable  rights of a company's  management.  In\r\n\r\nother  words, the Industrial Relations  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill,   1968,  is  a  natural  follow-up   of   the\r\n\r\nEmployment Act. These two pieces of legislation are\r\n\r\njust like Siamese twins and cannot be separated  if\r\n\r\nthey  are  to produce the desired objectives  which\r\n\r\nthe Government has in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the years before 1966 when the history of\r\n\r\nour  industrial relations was nothing to  be  proud\r\n\r\nof,  the  unions  encroached  upon  the  management\r\n\r\nfunctions  of commercial and industrial  companies.\r\n\r\nFor  instance,  it was almost impossible  in  those\r\n\r\nyears  to  get rid of a malingering and bad  worker\r\n\r\nbecause he could take shelter and protection  under\r\n\r\nthe  umbrella of his union. Very often if a  single\r\n\r\nworker  was  dismissed  on  strong  and  legitimate\r\n\r\ngrounds, it would result in protracted negotiations\r\n\r\nbetween   union   and  management,   and   if   the\r\n\r\nnegotiations came to nought, it usually ended in  a\r\n\r\nstrike resulting in heavy losses of revenue to  the\r\n\r\ncompany.  Very  often, if it was a foreign  concern\r\n\r\nand  the losses were too heavy to bear, the concern\r\n\r\nwould just fold up and go away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have to remind the trade\r\n\r\nunion  Members of this House that no  sensible  and\r\n\r\nresponsible  management will try to get  rid  of  a\r\n\r\ntrained  and exemplary worker when he is a manpower\r\n\r\nasset  in the viability of the company. The profits\r\n\r\nof the company depend on his productivity and skill\r\n\r\nand  the effort he puts into his work. How then can\r\n\r\nan  employer  afford  to  dismiss  such  a  worker?\r\n\r\nInstead,  management has to think of incentives  to\r\n\r\nreward  his  contribution to  his  company  and  to\r\n\r\ninduce  him  to  work as long as possible  for  the\r\n\r\ncompany,  because a worker takes many years  to  be\r\n\r\ntrained  before  he  is  really  effective  in  his\r\n\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, provisions are incorporated in the Bill\r\n\r\nby  which  wrongful dismissals, as  stated  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister, can be referred to him, and his decisions\r\n\r\nto  redress  any wrong are final. This  is  a  more\r\n\r\nsatisfactory   procedure  to  avoid  time-consuming\r\n\r\ndialogues  between the two parties to justify  each\r\n\r\nother's  actions. Therefore, these two  Bills  will\r\n\r\nprovide  a  solid foundation to woo  local  trading\r\n\r\ncompanies,  which  are  now hesitant,  and  foreign\r\n\r\nindustrialists  to invest in our island  state,  as\r\n\r\ninvestment is necessary for our economic survival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of the British military bases\r\n\r\nprovides almost 20 per cent of our national income.\r\n\r\nThis 20 per cent income comes from abroad. With the\r\n\r\nBritish  withdrawal  by 1971,  the  whole  of  this\r\n\r\nsource  of income will be reduced to zero. We  will\r\n\r\nface  a cruel world which does not owe us a living.\r\n\r\nWe must make up for the loss of this income derived\r\n\r\nfrom  the  presence of the British  military  bases\r\n\r\nhere.   We   also  face  competition   with   other\r\n\r\nindustrial countries in Asia. We must also maintain\r\n\r\nour  present standard of living which is the second\r\n\r\nhighest  in Asia. To succeed in all this,  we  must\r\n\r\nraise  the  quality of our goods  and  improve  the\r\n\r\nefficiency of our services to the maximum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers, like any other Singapore citizen, will\r\n\r\nno longer be in a privileged position. They will be\r\n\r\ncalled  upon  to  make sacrifices in  the  national\r\n\r\ninterest by increasing productivity and efficiency.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the trade unions will now have to play a\r\n\r\nmore  positive role in educating their  members  to\r\n\r\nrespond to these changes of circumstances which are\r\n\r\ncrucial in the years ahead for our existence as  an\r\n\r\nindependent and sovereign nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill, 1968,\r\n\r\nmerely re-establishes the status quo between labour\r\n\r\nand  management which is long overdue in industrial\r\n\r\nrelations.   With  an  enlightened   attitude   and\r\n\r\npositive  co-operation on both  sides,  our  nation\r\n\r\nwill co down in the annals of history that we have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nachieved  the impossible by the enactment of  these\r\n\r\ntwo  Bills.  Our labour will earn the  hallmark  of\r\n\r\nbeing    the    most   hard-working,   intelligent,\r\n\r\nresponsible, skilled and industrious in Asia.  When\r\n\r\nthis  objective  is reached, these two  Bills  will\r\n\r\nhave  generated the establishment of more and  more\r\n\r\nindustries.   This  will  mean  more   avenues   of\r\n\r\nemployment  for  our  citizens.  With   that,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker. Sir, I beg to support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I deal\r\n\r\nwith  some of the points raised by the hon. Members\r\n\r\nopposite,   I   think   I   should   correct    the\r\n\r\nmisapprehension of one of the hon. Members  that  I\r\n\r\nhad  quoted statistics relating to strikes to blame\r\n\r\nthe  workers. If he will re-read my speech, he will\r\n\r\nsee  that that was not the intention. The intention\r\n\r\nwas  to  show that during the period in  the  early\r\n\r\n1960s,  something like 57 per cent of the  disputes\r\n\r\narose  out  of  quarrels  over  management  rights,\r\n\r\nretrenchment, the right to hire workers and so  on.\r\n\r\nThis   was  the  basis  on  which  this  Bill   was\r\n\r\nintroduced, because obviously there is considerable\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  between  workers  and  management\r\n\r\nabout what are management rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill now,\r\n\r\nfor the first time, spells out something which hon.\r\n\r\nMembers, and especially the trade union themselves,\r\n\r\nadmit are common law rights. These rights have been\r\n\r\nthere. They are accepted as such. The rights of the\r\n\r\nmanagement to manage have not been queried,  except\r\n\r\nby  the  Member for Kallang who has suggested  that\r\n\r\nworkers  should also participate in the  management\r\n\r\nof  industries. That is something for  the  future.\r\n\r\nBut,  at  the  moment, there is no dispute  and  no\r\n\r\nquarrel over the essence of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is misgiving is in regard to the\r\n\r\nabuse  of  these  rights by certain  employers.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  if  one  assumes that  all  employers  are\r\n\r\nmadcaps,  then  not only this legislation  but  all\r\n\r\nother  pieces of legislation go by the  board.  But\r\n\r\nemployment laws are normally\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade on the basis that employers are reasonable and\r\n\r\nwe frame legislation to suit reasonable conditions.\r\n\r\nBut  where  it  appears to us that  the  number  of\r\n\r\nmadcap employers becomes very substantial, then, as\r\n\r\nI  made  it  quite  clear in  my  speech,  we  will\r\n\r\nreconsider  amendments to our Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nAct   with   a  view  to  controlling  unreasonable\r\n\r\nemployers. But as things are at the moment, we work\r\n\r\non   the   assumption  that  most   employers   are\r\n\r\nreasonable, as most trade unionists are reasonable.\r\n\r\nIf that feeling prevails and if employers and trade\r\n\r\nunionists  work on the basis that both parties  are\r\n\r\nreasonable men, then I think this Bill, when passed\r\n\r\ninto  law,  will  achieve what we  really  want  to\r\n\r\nachieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the debate not only on this Bill but also on\r\n\r\nthe Employment Bill, there are different objectives\r\n\r\nor  immediate objectives. Naturally for  the  trade\r\n\r\nunionists,  they are only interested in  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions  and the workers. The employer is  concerned\r\n\r\nonly  with  his own sectional interest. But,  as  a\r\n\r\nGovernment,  our  interests are  national.  We  are\r\n\r\ninterested in the welfare of Singapore as a whole - workers, employers and professional men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main objectives of the Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  (Amendment) Bill, as with the Employment\r\n\r\nAct,  is  to  resolve serious and real problems  of\r\n\r\neconomic   expansion,  new  investments,  increased\r\n\r\nproductivity. And the overriding test to  which  we\r\n\r\nsubmit  any legislation is, will it help  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout  these  objectives - economic expansion,  new\r\n\r\ninvestments, increased productivity? If it  can  or\r\n\r\nif  it  gives a reasonable assurance that  it  can,\r\n\r\nthen  the  legislation must over-ride the sectional\r\n\r\ninterests, whether of employers or workers  or  any\r\n\r\nother  groups. And this, I am convinced, will  help\r\n\r\nand  definitely  bring about industrial  expansion,\r\n\r\neconomic expansion, new investments. If we  do  not\r\n\r\nachieve  these objectives soon enough before  1971,\r\n\r\nat least in the 1970s, then the arguments about the\r\n\r\nright  to  hire  and  fire and  retrenchment  would\r\n\r\nbecome superfluous and unreal, because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  would  be  massive  unemployment.  Employers\r\n\r\nwould be checking out and concerns would be closing\r\n\r\ndown  right  and  left,  in  which  case  even  the\r\n\r\nexercise  of  the  need  for  unions  would  become\r\n\r\nproblematical. My colleagues and I, and I am  quite\r\n\r\nsure Members opposite also, are convinced that this\r\n\r\nBill  will, when enacted into law, bring about  new\r\n\r\ninvestments, industrial expansion and, in the  long\r\n\r\nrun, bigger, more prosperous and stronger unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Whilst  the  purpose  of   the\r\n\r\nEmployment   Bill  and  the  Industrial   Relations\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill is to have more  realistic  terms\r\n\r\nand  conditions  of  service and  employer-employee\r\n\r\nrelations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsonant   with   the  need  to   induce   greater\r\n\r\ninvestment,   generate  higher   productivity   and\r\n\r\nemployment,  this  Bill deals with  another  inter-related  problem  --  the marshalling  of  domestic\r\n\r\nsavings for the economic and social benefit of  our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I deal with the Bill itself, hon. Members\r\n\r\nwill  no  doubt  like to have the  air  cleared  in\r\n\r\nregard  to  the Fund itself. At the  end  of  1967,\r\n\r\nthere  were 456,029 members with balances totalling\r\n\r\n$477,315,488. The number of active accounts in 1967\r\n\r\nwas,  however,  299,157 and contributions  received\r\n\r\nduring  the  year  amounted to  $55.8  million.  An\r\n\r\ninteresting  feature of the Fund is that  about  60\r\n\r\nper  cent  of the members earn less than  $200  per\r\n\r\nmonth,  whilst about 31 per cent earn between  $200\r\n\r\nand  $500 per month, and only about 9 per cent earn\r\n\r\nmore  than  $500  per  month.  It  would  also   be\r\n\r\ninteresting to note that about 57 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  membership have a balance of less than $500,\r\n\r\nbut  if  we  were to consider the total  number  of\r\n\r\nmembers  having  a  balance  of  under  $1,000  the\r\n\r\npercentage would be about 71 per cent. The analyses\r\n\r\ngiven here will help hon. Members, in the light  of\r\n\r\nwhat  I  have  to  say later on, to appreciate  the\r\n\r\neffect  the  proposed  amendments  to  the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund  Ordinance will have  on  the  wage\r\n\r\nearning population of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the principal purposes of the\r\n\r\nBill are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to increase the contributions payable to the Central Provident Fund by employers and employees;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to enable arrangements to be made for members of the Fund to use their savings in the Fund for the purchase of houses or flats for their own occupation; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) to enable the provisions of the Central Provident Fund Ordinance to be extended to cover persons who are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nself-employed  and  who do  not  at  present\r\n\r\ncontribute to the Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall first deal with the proposal to increase\r\n\r\nthe  contributions. An amendment  is  made  to  the\r\n\r\nSchedule  to  the Ordinance whereby  new  rates  of\r\n\r\ncontribution payable are prescribed. The effect  of\r\n\r\nthis   amendment  is  that  the  current  rate   of\r\n\r\ncontribution  of  5 per cent each by  employer  and\r\n\r\nemployee is increased by 1\u00bd, per cent to make it 6\u00bd\r\n\r\nper  cent  each,  and the existing  provision  that\r\n\r\nlimits  the employers' and employees' contributions\r\n\r\nto  a maximum of $25 per month from each is removed\r\n\r\nand  a  new maximum of $150 per month from each  is\r\n\r\nsubstituted.  It  should be  noted,  however,  that\r\n\r\nemployees  who earn less than $200 per month,  will\r\n\r\nnot,  as  at present, be required to contribute  to\r\n\r\nthe Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the payment of an additional 1\u00bd\r\n\r\nper  cent by the employer will, in respect of about\r\n\r\n60  per  cent  of  the members of  the  Fund,  mean\r\n\r\ncontributions  only by employers towards  enhancing\r\n\r\nthe savings of workers. In an indirect way it is an\r\n\r\naddition to workers' pay. The same advantages would\r\n\r\nalso  apply to employees in the higher wage groups.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not intended to apply the new  rates\r\n\r\nto  the United Kingdom Government and its employees\r\n\r\nand they will therefore contribute the present rate\r\n\r\nof  5 per cent each. The reason for this is obvious\r\n\r\nas  hon.  Members know that the British are leaving\r\n\r\nand retrenching their employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is given powers to vary the schedule\r\n\r\nof contributions. The intention behind these powers\r\n\r\nis  to increase the rate by another 1\u00bd per cent  in\r\n\r\nthe second stage. Therefore, the total savings each\r\n\r\nmonth  for  the worker as a result of contributions\r\n\r\npayable  both by employer and employee will  be  16\r\n\r\nper  cent - that is 8 per cent each by employer and\r\n\r\nemployee.  In  the  third stage, the  contributions\r\n\r\nwill  be increased by a further 2 per cent to  make\r\n\r\nit  10  per cent from each side, or a total savings\r\n\r\nof  20  per  cent of salary each month.  This  will\r\n\r\nconsiderably increase the savings of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployees and build up their reserves in  the  Fund\r\n\r\nwhich  will  stand  them  in  good  stead  both  by\r\n\r\nenhancing savings and accumulating sufficient money\r\n\r\nto purchase houses or flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very significant departure from the existing\r\n\r\nlaw  are  the  amendments  to  section  25  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  as embodied in clause 14.  This  is  to\r\n\r\nenable members of the Fund to use their savings  in\r\n\r\nthe  Fund  for the purchase of houses or flats  for\r\n\r\ntheir  own  occupation. A reasonable question  that\r\n\r\ncan  be asked in this regard is the basis on  which\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  assessed  the  situation.  I  must\r\n\r\ninform   hon.  Members  that  the  Government   has\r\n\r\nassessed  the  purchase intentions  of  the  people\r\n\r\nthrough  a  feasibility  survey  conducted  by  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Research Centre in conjunction  with  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Board.  This  survey  has\r\n\r\nshown  that  49  per cent, or nearly  half  of  the\r\n\r\nhouseholders in Housing Board flats, expressed  the\r\n\r\nintention  to  buy  them,  10  per  cent  expressed\r\n\r\nuncertainty  and  41  per  cent  did  not  wish  to\r\n\r\npurchase flats. Among those who wish to buy  flats,\r\n\r\n16  per cent live in one-room flats, 30 per cent in\r\n\r\ntwo-room flats and 54 per cent in three-room flats.\r\n\r\n29 per cent of those who expressed uncertainty live\r\n\r\nin  one-room  flats, 35 per cent in two-room  flats\r\n\r\nand 36 per cent in three-room flats. An interesting\r\n\r\nfeature  was that 53 per cent of those who did  not\r\n\r\nwish  to buy flats live in one-room flats,  27  per\r\n\r\ncent  in  two-room flats and 20 per cent in  three-room flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These figures indicate that the proportion of\r\n\r\nhouseholds   wishing  to  purchase   flats   varies\r\n\r\ndirectly with the number of rooms in a flat.  While\r\n\r\nonly  24 per cent of those living in one-room flats\r\n\r\nwish  to  buy, 50 per cent of those living in  two-room flats and 68 per cent of those living in three-\r\n\r\nroom flats have expressed a wish to buy them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to Central Provident Fund balances of\r\n\r\nhouseholds  surveyed, an interesting revelation  is\r\n\r\nthat  about  31  per cent have between  $1,000  and\r\n\r\n$5,000  and 13 per cent above $5,000. About 10  per\r\n\r\ncent have between $500\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  $1,000  and 21 per cent less than $500.  There\r\n\r\nare,  however,  a  good number of people  in  these\r\n\r\nhouseholds  who  do not contribute to  the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund  but who wish to buy  flats.  These\r\n\r\npeople  are  generally self-employed. Hon.  Members\r\n\r\nwill see that there is, therefore, justification in\r\n\r\nenabling  members to make use of their  savings  in\r\n\r\nthe Fund to purchase houses as a sizable proportion\r\n\r\nof  our people, whether in or out of the Fund,  are\r\n\r\nkeen  to own their own homes. This should give  the\r\n\r\nlie  to those who allege that people are forced  to\r\n\r\nbuy  Housing  Board flats. With the enhancement  of\r\n\r\nsavings  through  increased contributions,  it  can\r\n\r\nreasonably be expected that more people  will  have\r\n\r\nenough  funds  in due course to make down  payments\r\n\r\nand pay instalments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Central Provident Fund members who already have\r\n\r\nsufficiently  large balances in the Fund  would  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  use  their balances to purchase  flats\r\n\r\noutright,  while  those who have already  purchased\r\n\r\nflats   will  be  allowed  to  use  their   monthly\r\n\r\ncontributions  to  pay  the  instalments  of  their\r\n\r\nhousing loans, but they will not be allowed to  use\r\n\r\ntheir  balances to settle outstanding  balances  of\r\n\r\nany existing loans. I must inform hon. Members that\r\n\r\nregulations   will  be  introduced  to   make   the\r\n\r\nnecessary arrangements for implementing the housing\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other notable amendment is the provision to\r\n\r\nextend  coverage to self-employed persons, that  is\r\n\r\nto  say, persons who derive income from any  trade,\r\n\r\nprofession  or vocation. Any such person,  however,\r\n\r\nneed  not contribute after he has attained the  age\r\n\r\nof  55  years. Provision is also made to  ascertain\r\n\r\nfrom  the Comptroller of Income Tax the incomes  of\r\n\r\nsuch persons. These are contained in clauses 2  and\r\n\r\n14  which amend sections 2 and 25 of the Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThe  necessary regulations in this regard will also\r\n\r\nbe made in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments to the Central Provident\r\n\r\nFund  Ordinance  are in part consequential  and  in\r\n\r\npart designed to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimprove the drafting and the administration of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  These  amendments, however,  include  a\r\n\r\nnumber of others which are considered necessary for\r\n\r\nother reasons. In particular, provisions have  been\r\n\r\nmade in clause 6 to require employers to contribute\r\n\r\nto the Fund in respect of employees over the age of\r\n\r\n55   years   and  to  require  such  employees   to\r\n\r\ncontribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 7 and 8 of the Bill introduce two new\r\n\r\nsections  designed  to clarify  the  procedure  and\r\n\r\nconditions of withdrawal from the Fund. The  rights\r\n\r\nof   members  of  the  Fund  to  withdraw  will  be\r\n\r\naffected: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) by restricting the right of withdrawal on\r\n\r\nthe  ground that a member is leaving  Malaya\r\n\r\npermanently to persons who are not  citizens\r\n\r\nof Singapore; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) by discontinuing the existing provision\r\n\r\nunder  which  a person who has not  been  an\r\n\r\nemployee  for  more than  two  years  to  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  withdraw if he can satisfy  the Board  that  he  is  not  likely  to  be  an\r\n\r\nemployee again.        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restriction in the case of persons who have\r\n\r\nnot  been  employed  for more  than  two  years  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  in  view of the fact that provision  has\r\n\r\nbeen  made  for self-employed persons to contribute\r\n\r\nto   the  Fund.  The  existing  provision  in   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance that allows such persons to withdraw from\r\n\r\nthe Fund is not compatible with the new requirement\r\n\r\nthat they should contribute to the Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 14 of the Ordinance,\r\n\r\nwhich is embodied in clause 9, enables, firstly,  a\r\n\r\nmember's balance in the Fund to be used as security\r\n\r\nfor  the purposes of purchasing a house or  a  flat\r\n\r\nfor  his  own occupation and, secondly,  deletes  a\r\n\r\ntransitional provision in the Ordinance that ceased\r\n\r\nto have any effect some 10 years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of clause 10 is to make new provision\r\n\r\nto provide penalties for publication of information\r\n\r\nby   an  employee  of  the  Board  to  unauthorised\r\n\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 21 in clause 11 of the\r\n\r\nBill  is  in connection with approved funds.  There\r\n\r\nare  26  such  funds. It is probable that  in  many\r\n\r\ncases  the new rates of contributions payable under\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance  will be of greater benefit  to  the\r\n\r\nemployees who are members of such funds than  their\r\n\r\nexisting  rights as members of approved funds.  The\r\n\r\namendment  will  merely  enable  the  Minister   to\r\n\r\nrequire  employers  who operate approved  funds  to\r\n\r\ncontribute to the Central Provident Fund for  their\r\n\r\nemployees if the Minister so directs. Further,  the\r\n\r\ndeletion  of subsection (8) of section  21  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance   will  affect  between  two  and   three\r\n\r\nthousand employees who have been exempted from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Ordinance by the Board. It is now\r\n\r\nproposed  to  exempt by Regulations to be  gazetted\r\n\r\nemployees  whose  country of  domicile  is  outside\r\n\r\nMalaya  and  Singapore  and  who  are  employed  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  on  an Employment or Professional  Visit\r\n\r\nPass issued by the Controller of Immigration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 of the Bill contains a new section\r\n\r\ndealing with the refund of amounts paid to the Fund\r\n\r\nby  error.  Most of the provisions of the  existing\r\n\r\nsection 24 have been continued, but provisions have\r\n\r\nnow  been made for dealing with contributions  paid\r\n\r\nin error by persons who are not employees, and with\r\n\r\nerrors  made  in  the  payment  of  interest  under\r\n\r\nsection  7A of the Ordinance. The time for claiming\r\n\r\nrefund  of  amounts paid in error has been  reduced\r\n\r\nfrom three years to one year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 introduces a new section 24A which is\r\n\r\ndesigned   to  enable  the  Board  to   engage   in\r\n\r\nactivities    not   directly   related    to    the\r\n\r\nadministration  of  the  Fund  and  to   call   for\r\n\r\ninformation   under  certain  circumstances.

This is an exercise in social innovation\r\n\r\nand social transformation, an attempt to create  as\r\n\r\nlarge a proportion of property-owning population as\r\n\r\npossible so that they would have a deep and abiding\r\n\r\nstake in the country and thereby revolutionise  the\r\n\r\npattern of living of our people for the better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the Central Provident Fund (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.  This  Bill makes a welcome change  from  the\r\n\r\nEmployment   Bill  and  the  Industrial   Relations\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill  in  that it contains  provisions\r\n\r\nmainly for the benefit of workers in Singapore. The\r\n\r\nBill  seeks  to  increase  the  existing  rate   of\r\n\r\ncontribution to the Central Provident Fund  payable\r\n\r\nby both employer and employee from 5 per cent to 6\u00bd\r\n\r\nper  cent,  8 per cent and 10 per cent respectively\r\n\r\nduring  the next three years. It appears to be  the\r\n\r\nintention of the Government that such increases  in\r\n\r\nthe  rate  of  Central Provident Fund contributions\r\n\r\nare to be treated as wage increases. The Government\r\n\r\nis  to be congratulated on moving such an amendment\r\n\r\nto  the  Central  Provider Fund  Ordinance  as  the\r\n\r\nincreased  rate of contribution would,  in  effect,\r\n\r\nincrease the savings of workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with the increased rate of\r\n\r\ncontribution, the Bill also seeks to  provide  that\r\n\r\nthe  amount of existing deposits credited  to  each\r\n\r\nemployee in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Provident Fund can  be  utilised  for\r\n\r\nmaking a down payment for the purchase of a Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board flat and that the subsequent\r\n\r\ncontributions to the Central Provident Fund at  the\r\n\r\nenhanced  rate of contribution can be utilised  for\r\n\r\npaying  the  monthly hire-purchase instalments  for\r\n\r\nthe  purchase of such flats. As I see  it,  such  a\r\n\r\nprovision  would enable many workers to make  their\r\n\r\ndream of owning their own homes come true. This  is\r\n\r\nparticularly  so  when the Central  Provident  Fund\r\n\r\nrate of contribution is increased to 10 per cent in\r\n\r\nthree years' time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I appreciate that the provisions in the\r\n\r\nBill  are  for  the  general  benefit  to  workers,\r\n\r\nhowever,  I  wish  to  draw the  attention  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to the fact that whatever  benefit  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  proposes to give to the  workers  under\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  may be largely negatived by  the  action\r\n\r\nthat  would be taken by most employers. It  is  the\r\n\r\nvalid fear of workers that employers may offset the\r\n\r\nincreased  rate of contribution payable under  this\r\n\r\nBill  against the gratuity benefits payable by them\r\n\r\nunder  a collective agreement. Members of the House\r\n\r\nmay  be  aware that in most collective  agreements,\r\n\r\nprovision  is  made  for the  payment  of  gratuity\r\n\r\nbenefit  to  an  employee  on  his  resignation  or\r\n\r\nretirement  from the service of his  employer.  The\r\n\r\namount  of  this  gratuity benefit depends  on  the\r\n\r\nlength  of  his service. The rate usually  averages\r\n\r\nfive per cent of the last drawn monthly salary  for\r\n\r\neach  year  of service, in addition to the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident   Fund   contribution  payable   by   the\r\n\r\nemployer.  As  it  is proposed under  the  Bill  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  Central Provident Fund  contribution\r\n\r\nultimately  to 10 per cent, and if the employer  is\r\n\r\nallowed   to   offset   the   increased   rate   of\r\n\r\ncontribution against whatever gratuity  benefit  is\r\n\r\npayable  by  him to the worker under the collective\r\n\r\nagreement it would, in effect, mean that the worker\r\n\r\nwould  not obtain the benefit of any wage  increase\r\n\r\nas  envisaged  under this Bill. I  would  therefore\r\n\r\nurge  the Government to look into this problem  and\r\n\r\nensure that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployer  does  not  offset the increased  rate  of\r\n\r\nCentral   Provident   Fund   contribution   against\r\n\r\nwhatever gratuity benefit is payable by him to  his\r\n\r\nworkers   under   the  collective   agreement.   If\r\n\r\nemployers do this, it will defeat the very  purpose\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill  which is to enable the  workers  to\r\n\r\nenjoy any increase in wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish also to comment on an important point\r\n\r\nwhich   seems  to  be  ignored  under  the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund (Amendment) Bill. I  refer  to  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  persons  who  are  unemployed   before\r\n\r\nreaching the age of 55 years, at which age they are\r\n\r\nonly  allowed to withdraw whatever sum of money  is\r\n\r\nstanding  to their credit in the Central  Provident\r\n\r\nFund.  Such persons, particularly those whose  ages\r\n\r\nrange  between  45  and  50,  may  find  themselves\r\n\r\nunemployable  in the labour market which  is  being\r\n\r\nflooded  with young school-leavers. The tragedy  is\r\n\r\ncompounded  by  the  fact  that  such  persons  are\r\n\r\nusually  family men. The result is that  they  find\r\n\r\nthemselves  in  a  most unenviable situation.  They\r\n\r\nhave  no  jobs and no means to support the  family.\r\n\r\nThey  find  that they cannot withdraw some  of  the\r\n\r\nmonies  which  are credited to their names  in  the\r\n\r\nCentral Provident Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, appeal to the Government\r\n\r\nseriously  to  consider allowing  such  persons  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw some of the monies credited to them in the\r\n\r\nCentral  Provident  Fund. I would  suggest  that  a\r\n\r\nperson  who has been unemployed for five years  and\r\n\r\nhas  attained the age of 45 years should be allowed\r\n\r\nto  withdraw  up to 30 per cent of  the  amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney   standing  to  his  credit  in  the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund, and if he still remains unemployed\r\n\r\nat  the age of 50, he should be allowed to withdraw\r\n\r\na  further 30 per cent of the money standing to his\r\n\r\ncredit.  Such a measure will allow him to make  use\r\n\r\nof  the money when he most urgently needs it either\r\n\r\nfor supporting his family or for commencing a small\r\n\r\nbusiness. This measure also allows him\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  retain  40  per cent of the  sum  of  money  so\r\n\r\ndeposited in the Central Provident Fund for use  in\r\n\r\nhis  old  age,  by which time some members  of  his\r\n\r\nfamily  may  be  able  to take  over  the  task  of\r\n\r\nmaintaining the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\na  few  moments  ago, the Minister  said  that  the\r\n\r\nCentral Provident Fund (Amendment) Bill was  to  be\r\n\r\nintroduced in the interest of the workers. He  also\r\n\r\nstated  that there will be 1\u00bd per cent increase  in\r\n\r\nthe amount of contributions and that there will  be\r\n\r\nprovision   to  enable  members  of   the   Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund to utilise money in credit with  the\r\n\r\nFund  to  buy flats. In my view, this  may  not  be\r\n\r\nquite correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important factor is whether or not the\r\n\r\nproducts  of  our factories are cheap and  of  good\r\n\r\nquality. It is only under these circumstances  that\r\n\r\nwe  can compete in the international market. If the\r\n\r\nproducts  of our factories are not of good  quality\r\n\r\nand  are expensive, how can the workers be expected\r\n\r\nto  contribute  1\u00bd  per cent more  to  the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund? The factories will not be  able  to\r\n\r\nsell their goods. They may even have to close down.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in my view this is not a very  practical\r\n\r\nsolution.  Contributions to the  Central  Provident\r\n\r\nFund  should  be  reduced  so  that  the  cost   of\r\n\r\nproduction  to  employees may be  reduced  and  our\r\n\r\ngoods will be more competitive in the international\r\n\r\nmarket. If there are more factories, there will  be\r\n\r\nmore  jobs  created. I am afraid  that  if  workers\r\n\r\nspend their money and their rate of contribution to\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Provident  Fund  is  increased,  many\r\n\r\nfactories will not be able to keep down the cost of\r\n\r\nproduction.  As a result, they may  have  to  close\r\n\r\ndown and unemployment will increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the\r\n\r\nfact that hon.

The  first\r\n\r\npoint  is  about  the question  of  offsetting  the\r\n\r\nincreased   contributions  to   the   new   Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund  against gratuities  payable  under\r\n\r\ncollective  agreements.  I  suggest  this  is   one\r\n\r\ninstance  where  the trade unions can  legitimately\r\n\r\npursue their job of protecting the interest of  the\r\n\r\nworkers by insisting that ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is also good for the\r\n\r\nGovernment!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - the employers do stick by their\r\n\r\nagreements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is the possibility of allowing\r\n\r\npeople who are unemployed before the age of  55  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw     their    Central    Provident     Fund\r\n\r\ncontributions. As hon. Members will  know,  I  gave\r\n\r\nsome statistics which will show that this will  not\r\n\r\nreally  help  anyone who is unemployed  to  set  up\r\n\r\nbusiness.  Something  like  70  per  cent  of   the\r\n\r\ncontributors, as I have indicated, have  a  balance\r\n\r\nof  $1,000 each. Thirty per cent of that  is  about\r\n\r\n$300.  Any man who decides to set up business  with\r\n\r\n$300  is  obviously going to lose that  $300  which\r\n\r\nwill be there if he does not withdraw it when he is\r\n\r\n55.  So I suggest that this Bill will safeguard  at\r\n\r\nleast  many of the younger people. If the  Bill  is\r\n\r\npassed, 20 per cent of their wages every month will\r\n\r\nbe put into a Central Provident Fund which, over  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of 10 or 20 years, will be very substantial\r\n\r\nenough for them to buy a house and perhaps go  into\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Rajaratnam].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HIRE-PURCHASE BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.41 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

It  is  also\r\n\r\ndesigned  to control instalments-sale financing  to\r\n\r\nachieve  certain objects, namely, to curb inflation\r\n\r\nby   restricting  credit  facilities;  to   specify\r\n\r\nclasses  of  goods for particular purposes,  or  to\r\n\r\ndivert  manufacturing activity and the  lending  of\r\n\r\nmoney  to more productive purposes. The legislation\r\n\r\nprovides for the exercise of this control by laying\r\n\r\ndown  minimum deposits on hire-purchase  agreements\r\n\r\nor  by  restricting periods for which  payments  by\r\n\r\ninstalment buyers may be spread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from this, a more pressing reason\r\n\r\nthat  prompts Government to introduce this proposed\r\n\r\nlegislation is the urgent need to confer protection\r\n\r\nupon   the  less  sophisticated  members   of   the\r\n\r\ncommunity  who enter into hire-purchase  agreements\r\n\r\nand  often experience hardship because of the harsh\r\n\r\nand oppressive conditions which sometimes appear in\r\n\r\nthese agreements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill takes, as it were, a middle course\r\n\r\nbetween, on the one hand, the policy adopted by the\r\n\r\nUnited   Kingdom  legislation  (which  limits   the\r\n\r\napplication  of  the legislation  to  hire-purchase\r\n\r\nagreements where the hire-purchase price  does  not\r\n\r\nexceed \u00a32,000 sterling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  applies to all classes of goods) and,  on  the\r\n\r\nother   hand,   the  Australian  and  New   Zealand\r\n\r\nlegislation (which sets no financial limit to hire-purchase  agreements and applies to all classes  of\r\n\r\ngoods).  The policy in our Bill is that  it  should\r\n\r\napply  only  to certain categories of  goods  which\r\n\r\nfrom their nature are normally purchased under hire-purchase   agreements.  No   financial   limit   is\r\n\r\nspecified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with these broad principles in mind that\r\n\r\nthe  present legislation has been drafted and  this\r\n\r\nBill,  like the Malaysian Hire-Purchase Act,  1967,\r\n\r\nincorporates many of the recent concepts that  have\r\n\r\nbeen   written   into  the  existing  hire-purchase\r\n\r\nlegislation  of  the United Kingdom and  Australia.\r\n\r\nThe  Bill  has,  as  its foundation,  three  points\r\n\r\nfundamental  to consumer protection  of  any  kind.\r\n\r\nPart  II  provides adequate disclosure requirements\r\n\r\nin a written statement. Built-in terms in favour of\r\n\r\nthe  buyer  as  to  the title to  goods  and  their\r\n\r\nmerchantable  quality with implied  warranties  and\r\n\r\nconditions are found in Part III. Finally, the Bill\r\n\r\nin  Part VII prohibits contractual provisions  that\r\n\r\nare unconscionable in their purpose or operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term \"hire-purchase agreement\" is defined in\r\n\r\nclause  2 of the Bill. The provisions of this  Bill\r\n\r\nwill cover all hire-purchase agreements relating to\r\n\r\nsuch  goods as may be specified in the Schedule  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister.  The  goods to which  this  proposed\r\n\r\nlegislation  will apply are motor  vehicles,  radio\r\n\r\nsets,   television  sets,  gramophone  sets,   tape\r\n\r\nrecorders    and    any    combination     thereof,\r\n\r\nrefrigerators, deep-freeze food preservers and  any\r\n\r\ncombination  there  of,  air-conditioners,  washing\r\n\r\nmachines  and sewing machines. The effect  of  this\r\n\r\nprovision  is,  on  the  one  hand,  to  limit  the\r\n\r\napplication of the legislation to certain specified\r\n\r\ngoods, and, on the other hand, to enable Government\r\n\r\nto  adapt  this  legislation  to  meet  Singapore's\r\n\r\nchanging economic and social needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must stress, however, that, in the preparation\r\n\r\nof this legislation, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  not overlooked  the  consideration\r\n\r\nthat  protection should also be given to the unpaid\r\n\r\nseller's  interest in the hired goods; he  can  re-possess  the goods 21 days after serving  a  notice\r\n\r\nfor  non-payment of instalments due.  Further,  the\r\n\r\nrights  of third parties who may acquire possession\r\n\r\nof  goods  that  are the subject of a hire-purchase\r\n\r\nagreement have also been taken into account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be observed that in the definitions of\r\n\r\nthe   terms   \"hire-purchase\"  and   \"contract   of\r\n\r\nguarantee\", transactions in which the  hirer  is  a\r\n\r\ndealer of goods have been excluded. The reason  for\r\n\r\nthis  is  that,  being engaged in the  business  of\r\n\r\nhiring, a dealer does not need the protection  that\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  is  designed to give  to  the  ordinary\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public. Stocking arrangements  that\r\n\r\nare  entered  into between a hire-purchase  company\r\n\r\nand  a dealer are accordingly outside the scope  of\r\n\r\nthis Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will also be noted that jurisdiction over\r\n\r\ntransactions in respect of hire-purchase agreements\r\n\r\nis  vested in the High Court except in some matters\r\n\r\narising under clauses 10, 14 and 23 of the Bill. In\r\n\r\nso  providing,  this  Bill  follows  the  statutory\r\n\r\nprovisions   to  be  found  in  most   Commonwealth\r\n\r\ncountries that have legislated on this subject. The\r\n\r\nprincipal reason for this is that questions of  law\r\n\r\narising    from   hire-purchase   agreements    are\r\n\r\ninvariably complex and are, it is considered,  more\r\n\r\nsuitably dealt with by the High Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A novel provision, which does not appear either\r\n\r\nin  Australian  or United Kingdom  legislation,  is\r\n\r\nclause  14 (5) of the Bill which confers protection\r\n\r\nupon the owner where the hirer terminates the hire-purchase agreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statement to the Bill outlines in\r\n\r\na general way the various provisions of the Bill. I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  mention here  that  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nAdvocates and Solicitors Society has been consulted\r\n\r\nin  the  drafting  of this Bill  and  many  of  its\r\n\r\nsuggestions   and   recommendations    have    been\r\n\r\nincorporated in the Bill. In spite of this,  it  is\r\n\r\nthe intention of Government to refer this Bill to a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee so as to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovide  opportunities to other interested  bodies\r\n\r\nand members of the public to present their views on\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  which I commend to Members as  a  useful\r\n\r\nmeasure  for coping with the social and  commercial\r\n\r\nrequirements of our developing nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for a long\r\n\r\ntime  our  society and economy needed and  received\r\n\r\nthe  boost that hire-purchase provides in financing\r\n\r\nwhat consumption and consumer need. But equally for\r\n\r\na  long  time there was no referee, save  a  rather\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory  one  originating  in   the   United\r\n\r\nKingdom,  and even then ill-tailored for the  needs\r\n\r\nhere.  More often than not, the free play of forces\r\n\r\nbetween  the borrower and the lender ended  in  the\r\n\r\nborrower losing to the lender. This must be so, for\r\n\r\nyou  cannot afford to quarrel with the man to  whom\r\n\r\nyou are in debt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this Bill, a new referee has come into the\r\n\r\nring.  The  provisions  in the  Hire-Purchase  Act,\r\n\r\n1968,  as intituled, seek to regulate the form  and\r\n\r\ncontents of hire-purchase agreements and the rights\r\n\r\nand  duties  of  parties  to  such  agreements  and\r\n\r\nmatters connected therewith. Whether the provisions\r\n\r\ncontained  in  the  Bill  will  make  a  good   and\r\n\r\nimpartial referee is something only time can  tell.\r\n\r\nAt   this  moment  the  provisions  appear  to   be\r\n\r\nabsolutely necessary. They also appear to have been\r\n\r\ncarefully  considered and drafted. Even  forms  are\r\n\r\nbeing  prescribed  and the terms and  charges  laid\r\n\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going through the provisions of the Bill, I feel\r\n\r\nthat  the  future  borrower will  have  his  rights\r\n\r\nprotected and the future lender will know precisely\r\n\r\nwhere  his relief lies. The Courts are being  given\r\n\r\nexact  areas of jurisdiction, and I think  everyone\r\n\r\nwill  be happy except the borrower who borrows with\r\n\r\nthe intention to abscond, and the lender .who lends\r\n\r\nwith  the  intention to squeeze the purchaser.  But\r\n\r\nthe regulation and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontrol of hire-purchase is a field in which  there\r\n\r\nis  little experience in this country. It  is  true\r\n\r\nthat  the  Bill  has the benefit of  experience  in\r\n\r\nother  countries. But the experience of  the  other\r\n\r\ncountries  is not necessarily the prescription  for\r\n\r\nus. We are an emerging country. We are beginning to\r\n\r\nproduce   more   and  more  goods   for   our   own\r\n\r\nconsumption. It is essential that while we  try  to\r\n\r\ncurb  abuses in hire-purchase financing, we do  not\r\n\r\nkill such financing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill and I should\r\n\r\nlike  to ask the Minister charged with implementing\r\n\r\nit  to  consider representations carefully  and  to\r\n\r\nintroduce any amendments whenever needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That the Bill be committed to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and\r\n\r\nthe following Members:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Abdul Aziz Karim\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr E.

The proposed amendment will restore\r\n\r\nthe  position to what it was before 1966, and deter\r\n\r\nowners  from making excessive claims and act  as  a\r\n\r\nrestraint  against  an  owner  proceeding  with  an\r\n\r\nappeal regardless of the Collector's award and  the\r\n\r\namount of his own claim, as even if he succeeds  in\r\n\r\nobtaining  a  slight  increase,  he  will  not   be\r\n\r\nentitled to any costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill is merely a re-enactment of\r\n\r\nthe  existing provision of section 32  (3)  of  the\r\n\r\nLand Acquisition Act, 1966. Although it is proposed\r\n\r\nto  repeal  section 32 of the Act, this  particular\r\n\r\nprovision, section 32 (3), is being retained as  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not really deal with costs but with the power\r\n\r\nof  the  Appeals Board to confirm, reduce, increase\r\n\r\nor annul the award made by the Collector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity is also taken, in clause 2 of the\r\n\r\nBill, to amend section 8 of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLand Acquisition Act, 1966, to enable the Collector\r\n\r\nto  require  the  person  interested  in  any  land\r\n\r\nacquisition to furnish information relating to  the\r\n\r\nbasis, or mode of valuation by which the amount  of\r\n\r\ncompensation claimed by such person is arrived  at.\r\n\r\nThis  will enable the Collector to rationalise  the\r\n\r\nbasis of such claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.

The  number of holidays  in  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nalways  been set out in an Ordinance and the number\r\n\r\nof  'public  holidays has from time  to  time  been\r\n\r\nvaried  in such a manner that it would appear  that\r\n\r\neach time there is a change in the number of public\r\n\r\nholidays  in Singapore, this has been,  more  often\r\n\r\nthan  not,  towards an increase in  the  number  of\r\n\r\nholidays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it fair to observe that until we joined\r\n\r\nMalaysia,   the  number  of  holidays  was   fairly\r\n\r\nconstant. Although the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  now\r\n\r\nthe  President  of the Republic,  is  empowered  by\r\n\r\nnotification in the Gazette to appoint\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspecial  days  to  be observed as public  holidays,\r\n\r\nsuch  discretion accorded to him lay only  when  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  number of  holidays  or  when  a\r\n\r\nsubstitution  for  an existing  holiday  was  being\r\n\r\ncontemplated.   When  we  joined   Malaysia,   this\r\n\r\nOrdinance was repealed and in substitution therefor\r\n\r\nthe   Malaysian   legislation  was  introduced   to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In 1966 we re-enacted the Holidays  Act\r\n\r\nsetting out the legality or otherwise in regard  to\r\n\r\ncertain acts which may or may not be done on public\r\n\r\nholidays. By then, of course, the number of  public\r\n\r\nholidays had increased to the present number of  16\r\n\r\nper annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from these holidays, there were\r\n\r\ncertain  rest  days  provided for  in  the  various\r\n\r\nOrdinances  and  Acts  dealing  with  workmen   and\r\n\r\nlabourers.   These  enactments  set   out   certain\r\n\r\ncompulsory  industrial holidays  which  had  to  be\r\n\r\nobserved  and for which certain benefits  would  be\r\n\r\npaid  to workmen who were required to work on these\r\n\r\ndays.   In   the  recent  measures  introduced   by\r\n\r\nGovernment in order to prepare the country for  the\r\n\r\neventual departure of the British Armed Forces  and\r\n\r\nfor  the economic upheavals that may follow in  its\r\n\r\nwake, we have decided that the number of industrial\r\n\r\nholidays should be reduced to 11. At the same time,\r\n\r\nit  was  also  thought proper that  the  number  of\r\n\r\npublic holidays in Singapore should correspondingly\r\n\r\nbe  reduced  to coincide with the total  number  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  holidays per year. Not only then  would\r\n\r\nthe  workers,  but  also  all  those  resident  and\r\n\r\nworking   in   Singapore,  whether  in   Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  or  in the private  sector,  be  given\r\n\r\nevery   opportunity  to  make  their   contribution\r\n\r\ntowards  the  national  effort  to  remain   viable\r\n\r\neconomically,   and  progress   even   during   the\r\n\r\ndifficult years ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would perhaps be appropriate for me, in making\r\n\r\nthis  speech,  to  tell the House  that  Government\r\n\r\nsought   the   views   of  the  various   religious\r\n\r\ncommunities   in  our  society  on   the   proposed\r\n\r\nreduction  of  public  holidays.  The  Hindus,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  given the choice of having  Deepavali  or\r\n\r\nThaipusam as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  public  holiday,  have chosen  the  former.  The\r\n\r\nMuslims  have, after discussions and correspondence\r\n\r\nwith  the Muslim Advisory Board, retained Hari Raya\r\n\r\nPuasa  and Hari Raya Haji to enable members of  our\r\n\r\ncommunity who are of the Muslim faith, to discharge\r\n\r\ntheir   obligations  and  attend  mosque  on  those\r\n\r\nspecific   days.  The  Christians   have   retained\r\n\r\nChristmas  and Good Friday, the two most  important\r\n\r\ndates in the Christian calendar. The Buddhists have\r\n\r\nretained  Vesak Day. Thus it will be seen that  the\r\n\r\nchoice  of  holidays  that  will  be  retained   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  have  had the blessings  of  the  Inter-Religious Organisation, an organisation represented\r\n\r\nby all the religious persuasions in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of this Bill will bring us back to the\r\n\r\nless  playful  conditions which existed  before  we\r\n\r\nstarted  to  add on to our holidays as  we  had  to\r\n\r\nplease  more and more religious and cultural groups\r\n\r\nin  Singapore and Malaysia. I am sure  I  have  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of  hon. Members. In common with  all  the\r\n\r\nmeasures that have been introduced in this House at\r\n\r\nthis  present sitting, the main object of this Bill\r\n\r\nis  to  contribute more towards the national  well-being.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.11 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Moreover,  it  is  a\r\n\r\ntourist  attraction,  as  we  all  must  have  seen\r\n\r\ntourists following the procession and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusily   taking  pictures.  It  will  be  a   great\r\n\r\ndisappointment both to the local people and to  the\r\n\r\ntourists  if  the number of kavadi  processions  is\r\n\r\nreduced  because Thaipusam is not a public  holiday\r\n\r\nand,  therefore, workers will not be able  to  take\r\n\r\npart  in the processions. I therefore propose  that\r\n\r\nGovernment,  in  order  to  encourage  the  tourist\r\n\r\ntrade, should reconsider the deletion of this  very\r\n\r\npopular public holiday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whenever the Government reconsiders the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  public  holidays,  I  hope  Deepavali\r\n\r\nHoliday will not be abolished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.13 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche A.

Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to\r\n\r\nsupport  the  Bill for a somewhat different  reason\r\n\r\nfrom  that  advanced by the Minister  for  Law  and\r\n\r\nNational Development. Of the six days allocated  to\r\n\r\nthe four major religions in Singapore two go to the\r\n\r\nChristians, two to the Muslims, one to  the  Hindus\r\n\r\nand one to the Buddhists. Quite apart from this, we\r\n\r\nhave a responsibility to ourselves, in reaching our\r\n\r\ngoal of nation-building amongst a community made up\r\n\r\nof   so   many   races,  religions,  cultures   and\r\n\r\nlinguistic  groups,  to  look  to  the  other  five\r\n\r\nholidays, examine what they should signify and  how\r\n\r\nwe should celebrate them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Year's Day is, of course, an international\r\n\r\nday  of rejoicing. Whether it is in the West or  in\r\n\r\nthe  East, i.e., in Communist countries or in Japan\r\n\r\nor  China,  the 1st of January is New  Year's  Day.\r\n\r\nThis  is one occasion for rejoicing and celebration\r\n\r\namong  all  races and all communal  and  linguistic\r\n\r\ngroups in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But much more significant than New Year's Day is\r\n\r\nNational Day which is Just around the corner.  This\r\n\r\nis  not  a  day  merely  for  Muslims,  Christians,\r\n\r\nHindus,  Buddhists or the other minority  religious\r\n\r\ngroups  in  Singapore. For that matter, it  is  not\r\n\r\njust for any linguistic or cultural group. It is  a\r\n\r\nday which all Singaporeans celebrate by taking part\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  various  activities organised  in  the  various\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  Just as we used to  celebrate  the\r\n\r\n3rd of June as Constitution Day, you will find that\r\n\r\nin   the   last   three  years  since   we   became\r\n\r\nindependent,  National Day in  Singapore  has  been\r\n\r\ncelebrated   by   people  of  various   races   and\r\n\r\nreligions, and by cultural and linguistic groups as\r\n\r\na  day of national significance, as a day when  we'\r\n\r\nachieved  full  self-government. On 9th  August  we\r\n\r\nwill  celebrate  National Day  as  a  day  when  we\r\n\r\nbrought    independence   and   sovereignty    unto\r\n\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, National Day transcends all other\r\n\r\nreligious  holidays which, in effect, are sectional\r\n\r\ncelebrations, although on these days people who  do\r\n\r\nnot  belong  to these religious denominations  take\r\n\r\npart in the festivities too. For example, Christmas\r\n\r\nis  celebrated  by Christians as well  as  by  non-Christians in Singapore. Likewise, Chinese New Year\r\n\r\nis  also  celebrated by the non-Chinese; Hari  Raya\r\n\r\nPuasa  by the non-Muslims. Yet there is nothing  to\r\n\r\ncompare with National Day. The celebration  of  New\r\n\r\nYear's  Day  and  National Day, besides  the  other\r\n\r\nthree  holidays upon which I do not wish to  dwell,\r\n\r\ntranscends  all races, religions, or  cultural  and\r\n\r\nlinguistic groups. It is for us, the leaders of the\r\n\r\ncountry,  to  help  promote  the  significance   of\r\n\r\nNational Day to an even greater degree amongst  the\r\n\r\npeople. National Day is a day of rejoicing which we\r\n\r\nshould  celebrate  with  even  more  festivity  and\r\n\r\ngreater significance and feeling. Unless and  until\r\n\r\nthis can be brought home to the people, we will  be\r\n\r\nback in the old situation where Christmas, Han Raya\r\n\r\nPuasa  and the other religious festivities  of  the\r\n\r\nother religious groups mean more to these religious\r\n\r\ngroups than does National Day. This, I think, would\r\n\r\nnot be a trend towards progress in nation building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Day in the present context of an\r\n\r\nindependent  and  sovereign  Singapore  is  perhaps\r\n\r\ncomparable  to  the  7th  of  November   which   is\r\n\r\ncelebrated  in  the  U.S.S.R. to  mark  the  Great\r\n\r\nOctober Revolution. This has nothing at all  to  do\r\n\r\nwith Islam, Christianity and all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  other  religions  which exist  in  the  Soviet\r\n\r\nUnion.  Yet in that country and in other  countries\r\n\r\nwith  similar  national days,  the  celebration  of\r\n\r\nIndependence  Day  or National Day,  whichever  you\r\n\r\ncall it, has meant much more to the people over the\r\n\r\nyears  than  just  the  purely religious  festivals\r\n\r\ncelebrated  by  certain sections of the  people.  I\r\n\r\nhope  in  the  years ahead, as we  slowly  grow  to\r\n\r\nunderstand   the   meaning  and   significance   of\r\n\r\nindependence,  the meaning of being  free  to  rule\r\n\r\nourselves,  National Day will  be  celebrated  with\r\n\r\ngreater feeling and significance by people  of  all\r\n\r\nraces in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that Singapore is a multi-racial society and therefore in the provision of\r\n\r\npublic  holidays  we give equal  treatment  to  all\r\n\r\nracial and religious groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise one point. I wonder whether\r\n\r\nthe Minister will consider the addition of one more\r\n\r\nholiday to the Schedule to the Bill so as to enable\r\n\r\nwomen  folk  to  celebrate  a  common  holiday.   I\r\n\r\nrecollect  that  the proposal for a public  holiday\r\n\r\nfor  women  was  raised in 1957. At that  time  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action  Party was not in  power.  It  was\r\n\r\nduring  the  Lim  Yew Hock Administration  and  the\r\n\r\ncolonial  era  that we proposed Women's  Day  as  a\r\n\r\npublic  holiday.  But  we  have  not  achieved  our\r\n\r\npurpose.   The   introduction   of   the   Holidays\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill provides an opportunity. We should\r\n\r\nconsider  the  inclusion of a Women's  Day  in  the\r\n\r\nSchedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe you will agree, Mr Speaker, that in\r\n\r\nthe course of Singapore's history from the colonial\r\n\r\nera  through  the self-government stage  to  today,\r\n\r\nwhen  we  are  independent, women have  contributed\r\n\r\nmuch   towards  Singapore's  history.  There   are,\r\n\r\nhowever,  still many women who are trapped  in  the\r\n\r\ncoils  of family life. While men are able to  enjoy\r\n\r\nholidays  almost  all  the year  round,  women  are\r\n\r\nconfined to the kitchen. Women's Day can be  a  day\r\n\r\nwhen women will be able to enjoy their freedom  and\r\n\r\nequality with men.

The Member  for  Delta  has\r\n\r\nsuggested  the  inclusion  of  another  holiday   - Women's  Day  - saying  that women  are  in  a  less\r\n\r\nadvantageous position.

Both   have\r\n\r\ncontributed towards nation building. Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nmust  not  claim  special rights or privileges  for\r\n\r\neither women or men. I feel that the proposition by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Delta is not appropriate  at  the\r\n\r\npresent  juncture.

What  is\r\n\r\nthe  reason  for this great disparity  in  numbers?\r\n\r\nThis  is because there is no Women's Day for  women\r\n\r\nand  they cannot come out of their kitchen to serve\r\n\r\nthe  nation.

I  can\r\n\r\nassure this House that the subject of holidays does\r\n\r\nnot  come  within the portfolio of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLaw.

The  laws,  however,   have   been\r\n\r\ninadequate to cope with the health problems created\r\n\r\nby  these \"nuisance\" mosquitoes, such as the  Aedes\r\n\r\nand  Culex mosquitoes which are now established  to\r\n\r\nbe  capable of transmitting diseases.  Similarly,\r\n\r\nthe  laws are also found to be inadequate  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  health  problems created  by  disease-bearing\r\n\r\ninsect vectors, like flies, fleas, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Aedes aegypti mosquito, which breeds in\r\n\r\nartificial water-bearing receptacles, is the vector\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  the transmission of  haemorrhagic\r\n\r\nfever, dengue fever and yellow fever. There is also\r\n\r\nthe  danger  of  bancroftian  filariasis  which  is\r\n\r\ntransmitted  by  Culex fatigans, a  mosquito  which\r\n\r\nbreeds   in  polluted  stagnant  water  in  blocked\r\n\r\ndrains.

Factors\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  efficiency of the Health  Ministry's\r\n\r\nwork  force and the quality of the supervision  and\r\n\r\ndiscipline are important but not enough to effect a\r\n\r\nreduction   or  elimination  of  these   nuisances.\r\n\r\nEffective action against all the creators of  these\r\n\r\nnuisances  is  not  possible  under  the   existing\r\n\r\nDestruction  of Mosquitoes Ordinance or  the  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment  Integration Ordinance  because  of  its\r\n\r\nlimited  provisions aimed essentially, despite  its\r\n\r\ntitle,  at malarial control.

I  think  the\r\n\r\nintroduction   of  this  Bill  has   a   particular\r\n\r\nsignificance to the Minister for Health. Only a few\r\n\r\ndays  after he took over the reins of office, there\r\n\r\noccurred several cases of cholera in Singapore.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, according to investigations made later,  it\r\n\r\nwas  discovered that the disease was  brought  into\r\n\r\nSingapore from outside. In any case, the occurrence\r\n\r\nof  this  disease indicated that, on the one  hand,\r\n\r\nthe health of the public was endangered and, on the\r\n\r\nother,  it  posed  a challenge  to  our  young  and\r\n\r\nenergetic  Minister for Health to show  whether  he\r\n\r\nhad the ability to deal with this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.57 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result showed that our young and energetic\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health had the capacity to deal  with\r\n\r\nthis  matter, although he is suffering from a  cold\r\n\r\ntoday! When the cases of cholera came\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   light,  he  immediately  launched  a   counter\r\n\r\noffensive by implementing new health regulations. A\r\n\r\nnation-wide health campaign was launched. With  the\r\n\r\nfull   co-operation  of  all  the  people  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry,  we have officially declared  war  on  all\r\n\r\nharmful  insects. We are determined to  exterminate\r\n\r\nthem entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of \"disease-bearing insect\" in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  is  very  extensive.  In  addition   to\r\n\r\nmosquitoes  and flies, it also includes  the  eggs,\r\n\r\nlarvae and pupae of such insects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is quite meticulous and thorough. Its\r\n\r\naim is to eradicate all sources of harmful insects.\r\n\r\nNo  doubt this is praiseworthy. But the question is\r\n\r\nwhether  its aims can be achieved. This depends  on\r\n\r\nwhether  the  department charged with the  carrying\r\n\r\nout of this work can do its work efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important aspect is the co-operation of\r\n\r\nthe general masses. It is only when they understand\r\n\r\nthe  importance of maintaining hygienic  conditions\r\n\r\nanti comply with health regulations - that is, by not\r\n\r\nthrowing  rubbish on to open spaces  and  into  the\r\n\r\ndrains  - that we can effectively maintain  a  high\r\n\r\nlevel  of  public  health. Towards  this  end,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health has decided to launch a  nation-wide  health campaign in October. This  is  a  very\r\n\r\nappropriate measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, the most pressing problem\r\n\r\nis how to destroy mosquitoes and flies. As we know,\r\n\r\nthe  reason for the breeding and multiplication  of\r\n\r\nmosquitoes  and flies is the existence of  stagnant\r\n\r\nwater  and  the  choking of drains. There  are  two\r\n\r\nfactors  which  have brought about this  situation.\r\n\r\nFirst,  the  inefficiency of the  Public  Cleansing\r\n\r\nDepartment. Second, the indiscriminate throwing  of\r\n\r\nlitter by some people. If this is so, we must apply\r\n\r\nallopathic treatment to hit the nail on  its  head.\r\n\r\nFirst,  we  must  remedy the  inefficiency  in  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Cleansing Department. It must maintain  its\r\n\r\nwork  of  steadily  and  efficiently  clearing  the\r\n\r\ndrains. Second, we must educate our people to abide\r\n\r\nby  the  health regulations and instil  in  them  a\r\n\r\nsense of civic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsciousness.  And  all  this  with  a   view   to\r\n\r\nimpressing   the   tourists,  because   the   first\r\n\r\nimpression of the tourists is the health  condition\r\n\r\nof our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to hawkers, they must be persuaded to\r\n\r\nclear  their  own rubbish after their  business  is\r\n\r\nover.   In  this  respect,  we  hope  the  hawkers'\r\n\r\norganisations will come forward and persuade  their\r\n\r\nmembers to comply with the health regulations. This\r\n\r\nwill very soon make Singapore the cleanest and most\r\n\r\nbeautiful garden city in Southeast Asia in the true\r\n\r\nsense  of  the word. In this way, we  will  have  a\r\n\r\nbetter reputation in the world. Sir, I support  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in rising\r\n\r\nin support of this Bill I have two queries to make.\r\n\r\n(1)  How is the Ministry going to destroy fleas  by\r\n\r\nnot destroying rats? (2) Why is it that cockroaches\r\n\r\nare not included in the Bill?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Minister has rightly pointed out,\r\n\r\nfleas, if infected, can cause plague and I can  see\r\n\r\nno  way  of  getting  rid  of  fleas  by  means  of\r\n\r\ninsecticides unless rats are destroyed at the  same\r\n\r\ntime.  I was hoping that the Minister was going  to\r\n\r\ntell  us  of  a  \"get  rid  of  rats  campaign\"  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. I hope he will do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards cockroaches, they are, as everyone\r\n\r\nknows,  scavengers among the insect world  and  may\r\n\r\neasily be disease-bearing insects. I understand  in\r\n\r\ncertain  medical  quarters,  cockroaches  might  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  to  be  carriers  of  viral  hepatitis.\r\n\r\nEveryone  knows  that viral hepatitis  is  quite  a\r\n\r\nfatal disease. I gather from the Ministry of Health\r\n\r\nstatistics  that there were 700 cases of  hepatitis\r\n\r\nlast  year  of  which 47 were  fatal.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister will find ways and means of telling us how\r\n\r\nhe is going to destroy cockroaches in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, while I welcome the purport of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  I must express my uneasiness  at  what\r\n\r\nappears to be and could be an unbridled enthusiasm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  which  the  provisions of this  Bill  may  be\r\n\r\nimplemented  by the officials of the Ministry  once\r\n\r\nit  becomes law. I note that this is a Bill  of  29\r\n\r\nclauses.  One-third or nine of the  provisions  are\r\n\r\npenal.  In  the  nine  penal clauses  which  impose\r\n\r\nvarious penalties for various offences, one  clause\r\n\r\n-  clause  6  - does not specifically describe  the\r\n\r\noffence  for which a penalty is imposed.  There  is\r\n\r\nanother  clause which encroaches upon the universal\r\n\r\nrule  that a person's body is inviolate and  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  medically  examined unless  he  gives  his\r\n\r\npermission.   There  is  also  one   clause   which\r\n\r\ndisallows compensation for expenses incurred  by  a\r\n\r\nperson for damages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, therefore, that the rigour expressed in\r\n\r\nthis Bill does not herald other Bills that will  be\r\n\r\nissuing  forth  from the Ministry of Health,  since\r\n\r\nthe Minister himself has said recently that this is\r\n\r\nonly the beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\ncomment  briefly in strong support  of  this  Bill.\r\n\r\nThere  seems  to be too many beelzebubs,  lords  of\r\n\r\nflies  and  insects, who, with impunity,  encourage\r\n\r\nthe  breeding  of  insects by  their  irresponsible\r\n\r\nactions.

Flies can  be  seen\r\n\r\nall  over  the  city.  We can  even  see  flies  in\r\n\r\nParliament  House.  All  this  is  because  of  two\r\n\r\nfactors.  The  first  is the  inefficiency  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  cleansing workers. I have  been  told  that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  a thorough reorganisation  of  the\r\n\r\nCleansing  Department.  I  feel  that  the  present\r\n\r\nreorganisation has not been effective.  There  must\r\n\r\nbe  a  thorough reorganisation so that  the  Public\r\n\r\nCleansing Department will be efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second factor is the behaviour of the public.\r\n\r\nThese  two  factors, in my view, must be considered\r\n\r\ntogether.  The  officers of  the  Public  Cleansing\r\n\r\nDepartment must necessarily make an overall  review\r\n\r\nof  their  own position. In respect of the  public,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Health has recently  taken  some\r\n\r\naction  to  inculcate  in them  the  importance  of\r\n\r\nhealth.  In  this respect, I have a  suggestion  to\r\n\r\nmake.  In launching educational campaigns, such  as\r\n\r\nthe  campaign to be launched in October this  year,\r\n\r\naction   should  be  taken  to  rally   all   civic\r\n\r\norganisations  and  form an  anti  harmful  insects\r\n\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, last month there was a seminar\r\n\r\nconducted by the People's Association on  the  role\r\n\r\nof  community centres and environmental health. The\r\n\r\nmain  theme  of the seminar was how  to  promote  a\r\n\r\nhealthy  environment.  The participants  were  from\r\n\r\nvarious civic organisations and they were ready to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nco-operate   with   the   Government   to   improve\r\n\r\nenvironmental health and to turn Singapore into the\r\n\r\nmost beautiful and cleanest city in Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I suggest that the Ministry  of  Health\r\n\r\ncall a meeting of leaders of civic organisations to\r\n\r\ndiscuss the question of improving the environmental\r\n\r\nhealth of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there should be a competition\r\n\r\nto  name  the cleanest streets in Singapore.  These\r\n\r\nshould  be given recognition and rewarded. In  this\r\n\r\nway,   we  can  encourage  our  people  to  improve\r\n\r\nenvironmental    health   more    positively    and\r\n\r\nexpeditiously. This is my humble suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.09 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of\r\n\r\nall,  I wish to thank all the hon. Members who have\r\n\r\nspoken giving ardent support for this Bill. I would\r\n\r\nalso  like  to make some general comments  on  what\r\n\r\nthey have said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to deal with what the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang has stated. He says that the problem\r\n\r\nof  mosquitoes and flies can only be tackled  by  a\r\n\r\ntwo-pronged  attack  on  it.  Firstly,  the  public\r\n\r\nhealth  workers must be a disciplined and efficient\r\n\r\nforce.  Secondly,  there must be co-operation  from\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public. I could not agree with  him\r\n\r\nmore  because  I myself have stated in  this  House\r\n\r\nthat  that is the only way to solve this  very  big\r\n\r\nproblem in our Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the reorganisation of the public\r\n\r\nhealth cleansing force, I wish to tell hon. Members\r\n\r\nthat   this   is   now  nearing   completion.   The\r\n\r\nreorganised  set-up will be in force as  from  15th\r\n\r\nAugust this year. Reorganisation started less  than\r\n\r\nfour  months  ago. But I assure hon.  Members  that\r\n\r\nafter  15th  August, there should be  some  results\r\n\r\nbecause  the  reorganisation will  then  have  been\r\n\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter about which I wish to inform\r\n\r\nhon. Members is that with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe passing of the Employment Bill yesterday, it is\r\n\r\nnow   possible  for  the  Ministry  of  Health   to\r\n\r\nimplement  another very important programme,  i.e.,\r\n\r\nto  get  its public cleansing workers to  work  365\r\n\r\ndays  a  year,  including Sundays and  holidays.  I\r\n\r\nassure  hon. Members that this will also  have  its\r\n\r\neffect on the problem of flies and mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Joo Chiat has mentioned two\r\n\r\nspecific problems posed by rats and cockroaches.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to correct him by saying that although I\r\n\r\ndid  not specifically mention that cockroaches  are\r\n\r\nalso  included  in the Bill, the  Bill  covers  all\r\n\r\ndisease-bearing  insects. If  the  Member  for  Joo\r\n\r\nChiat  says  that  cockroaches are  disease-bearing\r\n\r\ninsects,  then by definition they must come  within\r\n\r\nthe purview of the Bill. He is a medical man and as\r\n\r\nhe has given an expert opinion, I will accept that.\r\n\r\nTherefore, cockroaches are included in the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as rats are concerned, I agree with him\r\n\r\nthat  we must first catch the rats in order to  get\r\n\r\nat the fleas. It is not that the Ministry of Health\r\n\r\nhave  not in mind a rat-catching campaign, but they\r\n\r\nmust  first  deal with the disposal of rubbish.  We\r\n\r\nwill  launch this anti-litter campaign  in  October\r\n\r\nand I assure hon. Members that as soon as we finish\r\n\r\nwith  that, we will go on to cockroaches, rats  and\r\n\r\nso  on.  I am sure many hon. Members here  who  are\r\n\r\nyoung  and energetic will certainly co-operate  and\r\n\r\nsupport us physically in our rat-catching campaign.\r\n\r\nI  also hope that the Member for Ulu Pandan, who is\r\n\r\npast  55  years, will also support us in  the  rat-catching campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens has said that\r\n\r\ncertain  provisions in the Bill, when  implemented,\r\n\r\nmight result in unbridled enthusiasm on the part of\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry's officials. I will be very  happy  if\r\n\r\nthat is the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta, on the other hand, has\r\n\r\nexpressed   some  misgivings  that  this  campaign,\r\n\r\nalthough  announced, might not come off at  all.  I\r\n\r\nassure her and other hon. Members that it will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  conducted with vigour, and this time I hope  we\r\n\r\nshall succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the suggestion by the Member for Delta\r\n\r\nabout  seeking  the aid of all civic organisations,\r\n\r\nthat  is  certainly what we have  in  mind  in  our\r\n\r\nOctober   campaign.  We  will  be   seeking   their\r\n\r\nparticipation and if they have a mass following, we\r\n\r\nshall invite them to participate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta has also another good\r\n\r\nsuggestion  - that we should hold a competition  to\r\n\r\nname the cleanest streets in Singapore. But we have\r\n\r\nan  even better suggestion. We shall not only  name\r\n\r\nthe  ten cleanest streets but also the ten dirtiest\r\n\r\nstreets  in Singapore, and woe betide hon.  Members\r\n\r\nwithin  whose  constituencies  those  ten  dirtiest\r\n\r\nstreets might happen to be!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I say something about the provisions\r\n\r\non  compensation? It is stated in clause 19 of  the\r\n\r\nBill  that  no  compensation will be paid  for  any\r\n\r\nexpense  incurred or damage occasioned by  any  act\r\n\r\ndone  in  pursuance of the provisions of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nunless  such damage has been occasioned maliciously\r\n\r\nor  without  reasonable cause. In such  matters  as\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  mosquitoes, flies and  disease-bearing\r\n\r\ninsects,  such  a  provision is  necessary.  I  can\r\n\r\nassure hon. Members that, in the exercise of  their\r\n\r\nduties,  my officials will be instructed to  handle\r\n\r\nwith  care the property of the occupiers  on  whose\r\n\r\npremises they conduct an inspection, and that  they\r\n\r\nwill  be given strict instructions that they should\r\n\r\nnot take any action which will unnecessarily result\r\n\r\nin damage to property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Chua Sian Chin].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DEPARTMENTAL TITLES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.23 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng) (for the Minister for Social Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nbeg to move the motion* standing in my Minister's\r\n\r\nname on the Order Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* The motion reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 3 of the Departmental Titles (Alteration) Ordinance (Chapter 55), resolves that the Schedule to the said Ordinance be amended by the addition under the headings of \"Old Title or Name of Office\" and \"New Title or Name of Office\" respectively of the following: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Principal Probation Officer.
