Some State banks are\r\n\r\nfor  special purposes, such as to provide credit  to\r\n\r\nfarmers  and  they are called Farmers' Banks.  Again\r\n\r\nsome  other types of State banks provide easy credit\r\n\r\nfacilities for industrial banks, and they are called\r\n\r\nState industrial banks. There are Co-operative State\r\n\r\nbanks  and a whole range of types of State banks.  I\r\n\r\nam  not  trying  to be facetious, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen  I  ask the hon.

Am\r\n\r\nI right in this understanding?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The question is a simple one, Sir.\r\n\r\nIs  the  Government considering the creation of  any\r\n\r\nState bank?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Government already has a\r\n\r\nState bank and that is the Post Office Savings Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Taking it seriously, Sir, is the\r\n\r\nMinister  then  indicating to  the  House  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has no intention to establish any Central\r\n\r\nor other State bank?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Now we come to it, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir. As I said, he was really referring to a Central\r\n\r\nBank.  The  answer  is  \"no\". The  reason  is  quite\r\n\r\nsimple.  I do not know whether I should go into  any\r\n\r\ndetails  on the functions and purposes of a  Central\r\n\r\nBank  and  their role in the financial system  of  a\r\n\r\ncountry.  Perhaps  I  should not.  I  can  give  the\r\n\r\nreasons quite simply. The Federation of Malaya has a\r\n\r\nCentral Bank and, after merger, I have no doubt this\r\n\r\nCentral  Bank  will establish branches in  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the Borneo territories. It is, therefore, quite\r\n\r\nunnecessary for the Singapore Government to consider\r\n\r\nsetting up a Central Bank of its own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Central Bank such as most independent nations\r\n\r\nhave is only worthy of its name and status if it is,\r\n\r\nin addition to performing the necessary functions of\r\n\r\ngovernment bankers and the lender of last resort  to\r\n\r\ncommercial banks, also the authority to control  the\r\n\r\nmonetary  issue of the country, that  is,  the  note\r\n\r\nissue of the country, and as a corollary it acts  as\r\n\r\na   custodian  of  the  nation's  foreign   exchange\r\n\r\nreserve.  We do not have a currency of our own,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  to have a Central Bank of our own,  while\r\n\r\nwe  are  part  of the common currency area  together\r\n\r\nwith  the  Borneo territories and the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya, is quite a meaningless affair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would ask the\r\n\r\nMinister,  accepting his thesis that a Central  Bank\r\n\r\nis   not  necessary  in  the  light  of  the  merger\r\n\r\nproposals, would he not consider that in the context\r\n\r\nof  the  stature of Singapore in the commercial  and\r\n\r\nfinancial   field,  a  State  Commercial   Bank   is\r\n\r\nimperative for our own commercial needs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, my own appraisal is that\r\n\r\nour  banking requirements are adequately met by  the\r\n\r\nprivate commercial banks.

I beg to move,  \"That  the\r\n\r\nBill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members may recall that this Bill  was  first\r\n\r\nintroduced to the Assembly at the June 1961 sitting,\r\n\r\nand since then the Bill has lapsed. The contents  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill before the House now are the same as those\r\n\r\nintroduced in June last year, and except  for  minor\r\n\r\nchanges in dates and in the bringing of the Schedule\r\n\r\nup  to date, there has not been any material change.\r\n\r\nThe  main  purpose of the Bill is to  secure  proper\r\n\r\ncontrol   over  the  activities  of  the  banks   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  to  provide  proper  supervision  to\r\n\r\nensure  a sound basis for banking business which  is\r\n\r\nso important to the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this Bill are modelled on the\r\n\r\nlines of the Banking Ordinance and the Central  Bank\r\n\r\nOrdinance now in force in the Federation of  Malaya.\r\n\r\nIt  is  desirable that Singapore and the  Federation\r\n\r\nshould  have  parallel banking  legislation  as  the\r\n\r\nbanking  system  is common to both territories.  The\r\n\r\nBanking  Bill now before the House has been held  in\r\n\r\nabeyance  since  June 1961, because of  more  urgent\r\n\r\nbusiness  that  has  occupied the  House  since  the\r\n\r\npresent Session began. It is now being re-introduced\r\n\r\non  a  Certificate of Urgency. I am proceeding  with\r\n\r\nthis Bill throughout its three stages because of the\r\n\r\nrecurrence  of  industrial disputes between  certain\r\n\r\nlocal banks and their employees. These disputes have\r\n\r\nresulted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  considerable inconvenience to the public and  to\r\n\r\nthe trading and business community in the inter-bank\r\n\r\nclearance  of  cheques, and ths has interfered  with\r\n\r\nthe efficiency of the banking business in the State.\r\n\r\nAt  the  moment,  the  Malayan  Banking  Association\r\n\r\noperates  a  mutual inter-bank clearing  house  with\r\n\r\nthree of the bigger banks serving as clearing hunks.\r\n\r\nThere is provision in the Bill for the setting up of\r\n\r\na  Clearing  House by the Government  and,  if  this\r\n\r\nClearing  House is set up, on the coming into  force\r\n\r\nof  the Ordinance, the inconvenience that arises out\r\n\r\nof  any industrial dispute will be restricted in its\r\n\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House is a fairly\r\n\r\nstraightforward  one  and  only  a  few   words   of\r\n\r\nexplanation are necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part I makes the necessary definitions. Banking\r\n\r\nbusiness is defined very broadly and is not intended\r\n\r\nto limit any legitimate banking business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II is devoted to the licensing of banks. This\r\n\r\nPart  provides that only banks holding licences from\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  can carry on business  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nProvision  is made for conditions to be attached  to\r\n\r\nlicences and these conditions can be modified as and\r\n\r\nwhen  necessary. The object of this section,  is  to\r\n\r\nensure that banks which operate in the State have  a\r\n\r\nsound  financial structure and that  their  business\r\n\r\nintegrity   is  not  open  to  question.   All   new\r\n\r\nbanks - whether  local  or foreign - have  to  obtain  a\r\n\r\nlicence.  Existing  banks  which  were  incorporated\r\n\r\nbefore  1st January, 1962, will be given a  licence.\r\n\r\nThey  will, however, have to satisfy certain capital\r\n\r\nrequirements. In the case of new banks  incorporated\r\n\r\nafter  1st January, 1962, if its Head Office  is  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, its paid-up capital must be at  least  $2\r\n\r\nmillion.  If  the  Head Office is  situated  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore, its paid-up capital must be at  least  $5\r\n\r\nmillion  and  it must hold at least  $2  million  in\r\n\r\nSingapore in respect of business in Singapore either\r\n\r\nin  the form of immovable property or other approved\r\n\r\nassets.  Existing  banks  incorporated  before   1st\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1962, will be given a period of grace of up\r\n\r\nto 10 years under Part VI to comply with the capital\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III sets out the main duties of licensed\r\n\r\nbanks. Most of the duties set out in this Part  will\r\n\r\nnot  in  any  way  cause well established  banks  to\r\n\r\ndepart  from their existing practices and  policies.\r\n\r\nThere is provision for a licensed bank to inform the\r\n\r\nMinister   of   any   alteration   in   the   Bank's\r\n\r\nconstitution or of any proposed change in ownership.\r\n\r\nEvery  licensed bank is also required to maintain  a\r\n\r\nreserve  fund to be built up out of its  profits  in\r\n\r\nthe  manner prescribed n the Bill. The reserve  fund\r\n\r\nwill of course greatly increase the soundness of the\r\n\r\nbank.  Licensed  banks are also not allowed  to  pay\r\n\r\ndividends until its capitalised expenditure has been\r\n\r\nwritten  off;  nor  can  it  grant  unsecured  loans\r\n\r\nexceeding $5,000 to any of its directors or any firm\r\n\r\nin which the directors are interested. Certain other\r\n\r\nrequirements  are  also  set  out  to   ensure   the\r\n\r\nfinancial  soundness of the bank. Certain statistics\r\n\r\nare  also  required to be furnished to the Inspector\r\n\r\nof  Banks  for the protection of depositors  and  to\r\n\r\nassist  in  the  control  of  banks.  A  bank   that\r\n\r\nconsiders  that  it  is  unable  to  meet  financial\r\n\r\nobligations  is  required to  inform  the  Minister.\r\n\r\nLicensed banks are also required to appoint auditors\r\n\r\nto be approved by the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Bill deals with the powers of the\r\n\r\nMinister. In this Part the Bill differs from that of\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  of  Malaya  Ordinance,  where  the\r\n\r\nCentral Bank exercises the principal functions  laid\r\n\r\ndown  in  their Ordinance. Since we do  not  have  a\r\n\r\nCentral  Bank, it is necessary to set up some  other\r\n\r\nauthority   which   can  perform  these   functions.\r\n\r\nProvision  is made for the Minister to  establish  a\r\n\r\nclearing house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Inspector of Banks is to be appointed to be the\r\n\r\nauthority to undertake investigations of banks  both\r\n\r\non  a routine basis and when the Minister has reason\r\n\r\nto  believe that a licensed bank is carrying on  its\r\n\r\nbusiness in an unsatisfactory way. The Inspector may\r\n\r\nalso,  on the advice of the Minister, assume control\r\n\r\nor  exercise  supervision over  the  business  of  a\r\n\r\nlicensed  bank in certain circumstances  to  protect\r\n\r\nthe interests of depositors and creditors. But these\r\n\r\nare  reserve powers which will be used only when the\r\n\r\nneed  arises. The powers of the Minister, which  can\r\n\r\nbe delegated to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInspector  of  Banks, does not extend,  however,  to\r\n\r\nauthorising enquiries specifically into the  affairs\r\n\r\nof any individual customer of a licensed bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Bill makes general provisions such\r\n\r\nas  barring certain individuals from taking part  in\r\n\r\nthe  management of a licensed bank, for  instance  a\r\n\r\nbankrupt   or  persons  convicted  of   an   offence\r\n\r\ninvolving fraud. Other clauses state the penalty for\r\n\r\noffences and amendments to the Companies Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI makes provisions for the transitional\r\n\r\nperiod.  I  have already referred to  the  provision\r\n\r\nthat existing banks incorporated before 1st January,\r\n\r\n1962, will he granted a licence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 34 (2) allows a period of grace of up to 10\r\n\r\nyears  for  banks with less than $2 million  paid-up\r\n\r\ncapital  or $2 million worth of assets in the  State\r\n\r\nto  adjust their assets to the amount required under\r\n\r\nthis   Bill.  Banks  with  their  Head  Offices   in\r\n\r\nSingapore will not he affected by this provision  as\r\n\r\nnone of them have a paid-up capital of less than  $2\r\n\r\nmillion.  The  position of branch  banks  with  Head\r\n\r\nOffices  abroad will have to he ascertained  in  due\r\n\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should mention here, Mr Speaker, Sir, that\r\n\r\nclause  34 of the Bill, which is modelled on section\r\n\r\n32 of the Federation Banking Ordinance, differs from\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  Ordinance in an important  respect.\r\n\r\nUnder  section 32 (2) (c) of the Federation  Banking\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  banks  which are  principally  owned  by\r\n\r\nforeign governments will not be granted a licence in\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  of  Malaya.  This  part   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Banking Ordinance is omitted from  the\r\n\r\nBill now before the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the main provisions of the Bill. Hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  can see that there is nothing in  the  Bill\r\n\r\nthat   is   meant  to  curtail  legitimate   banking\r\n\r\nbusiness.  To  banks which have  operated  on  sound\r\n\r\nbanking  principles,  this  Bill  should  not  cause\r\n\r\nanxiety or trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards staffing arrangements to administer the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  this Bill, I intend to  appoint  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Controller  of Foreign Exchange  to  be  the\r\n\r\nInspector  of  Banks under clause  17.

It  is  a\r\n\r\nsignificant  commentary on the  irresponsibility  of\r\n\r\nthe   Malayan  Banks  Association  in   seeking   to\r\n\r\ninconvenience  members of the public  by  curtailing\r\n\r\ninter-bank  clearances cheques  when  one  of  their\r\n\r\nmembers  has  an industrial dispute  that  today  we\r\n\r\nshould  have  to deal on the basis of  urgency  with\r\n\r\nthis Bill instead of the normal procedure whereby I,\r\n\r\nfor  one,  would have wished to see that an adequate\r\n\r\nopportunity be given both to the banks  and  to  the\r\n\r\ncommercial community to make representations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one aspect of the Bill. Sir, which I do\r\n\r\nnot  quite  follow.  A radical distinction  is  made\r\n\r\nbetween  those banks which are in existence now  and\r\n\r\nthose  who seek fresh licences. Under the provisions\r\n\r\nof  clause  3  (4), the Minister may grant  licences\r\n\r\nwith or without conditions, or refuse a licence. But\r\n\r\nunder clause 34 (1), which over-rules the provisions\r\n\r\nof sub-clause 4, it says that the banks specified in\r\n\r\nthe Third Schedule, which are the banks in existence\r\n\r\nnow,  shall  be  granted a licence subject  to  such\r\n\r\nconditions as are contained in any licence which  is\r\n\r\nin  existence. So that, Sir, we cannot  impose  more\r\n\r\nconditions than are in existence, nor can we  impose\r\n\r\nany\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconditions in the licence if, in fact, there are  no\r\n\r\nconditions  in any existing licence or no conditions\r\n\r\nat  all.  I am sure there must he some valid  reason\r\n\r\nfor   this  distinction  and  particularly  for  the\r\n\r\nlimitation  of  the  Minister's  powers   to   place\r\n\r\nconditions  in respect of the issue of  licenses  to\r\n\r\nbanks which are in existence and which are listed in\r\n\r\nthe  Schedule.  I would appreciate an indication  of\r\n\r\nthe  reasons which underlie the distinction  between\r\n\r\nlicences  granted to new banks and licences  granted\r\n\r\nto  existing banks. I do not know, Sir, but I should\r\n\r\nimagine  there  are banks in existence  today  which\r\n\r\nhave  no conditions attached to any licence, and  in\r\n\r\nso  far  as  I read clause 34 (1), it precludes  the\r\n\r\nMinister from imposing any conditions on the licence\r\n\r\nthat  he  issues  to those banks,  tying  his  hands\r\n\r\ncompletely.  I would ask whether, in fact,  that  is\r\n\r\nintentional  or inadvertent, and if intentional  the\r\n\r\nreason   therefor.  I  would  also   appreciate   an\r\n\r\nassurance   that  this  Clearing  House  which   the\r\n\r\nGovernment is setting up with such commendable speed\r\n\r\nwill,  in  fact,  be  adequately organised  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of meeting inter-bank cheque clearances  to\r\n\r\navoid  the  type  of inconvenience  which  has  been\r\n\r\nimposed  upon the public by members of  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nBanks Association recently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a\r\n\r\nBill  of  such a nature would, in my opinion,  be  a\r\n\r\nstep in the right direction to protect the interests\r\n\r\nof  depositors  although  I  feel  that  it  is  not\r\n\r\nadequate  enough. Sir, we have seen in this  country\r\n\r\ntoo  many mushroom bogus employment agencies,  bogus\r\n\r\ninsurance companies, and I feel that unless  such  a\r\n\r\nBill  is passed, we may also see in the near future,\r\n\r\nbogus banking companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in my opinion the Bill is not\r\n\r\nadequate  because,  although the Minister  is  given\r\n\r\nsufficient powers to investigate into the affairs of\r\n\r\nthe  banks,  yet the depositors and  the  public  at\r\n\r\nlarge do not know the results of such investigations\r\n\r\nuntil  the situation has worsened so badly that  the\r\n\r\nMinister or the Inspector has to take action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the details given by the banks to the\r\n\r\nMinister  as  set  out in the First Schedule  should\r\n\r\nalso  be  disclosed in the banking premises so  that\r\n\r\nthe depositors will know what happens to the banks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the bank in theory belongs to the\r\n\r\ndirectors,  and  also, to a lesser  extent,  to  the\r\n\r\nshareholders  who do not play a large  part  in  its\r\n\r\ndirection,  the depositors have as much a  stake  in\r\n\r\nthe  bank  as,  and sometimes even  more  than,  the\r\n\r\ndirectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another point to which I wish to\r\n\r\ndraw the attention of the Minister is that he should\r\n\r\nbe  given powers so that he can direct the Inspector\r\n\r\nto  go  and  test check the cash position and  other\r\n\r\ndetails  of  the  banks  as set  out  in  the  First\r\n\r\nSchedule and not just rely on the balance sheets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, the ideal situation, of course,\r\n\r\nis  to  set up a Central Bank, but it is a practical\r\n\r\nimpossibility because we are still in the stage of a\r\n\r\nsemi-colony, but we hope with this Banking  Bill  we\r\n\r\nwill  have more sound banking practices and  systems\r\n\r\nthan has been the case in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  to oppose this Bill not because of the content\r\n\r\nof   the   Bill.  The  content  of   the   Bill   is\r\n\r\npraiseworthy. In fact, it was praiseworthy  in  June\r\n\r\n1961 when the Government introduced it, and if there\r\n\r\nhad  been  no  intervening motives  which  have  now\r\n\r\ninduced  the  Government to introduce this  Bill  at\r\n\r\nthis   stage,  the  content  would  still  be   very\r\n\r\npraiseworthy. But what makes this Bill objectionable\r\n\r\nat  the  moment is the manner in which it  is  being\r\n\r\npresented to the House and the time at which it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  presented  to this House - I repeat  the  phrase\r\n\r\n\"the  time\"  and  I think the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nunderstands very well what I mean by the phrase \"the\r\n\r\ntime  at  which he has presented this Bill\".  It  is\r\n\r\nobjectionable and unworthy of this Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is a trading island\r\n\r\nwhich has commercial facilities and the banks play a\r\n\r\nvery important part in the commercial prosperity  of\r\n\r\nthis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nisland. Now, as banks are employers, therefore there\r\n\r\nmust  be  employees. The business of the Government,\r\n\r\nas I see it, is to foster the economic conditions of\r\n\r\nthis country, and in the fostering of these economic\r\n\r\nconditions,  it  becomes  necessary  to  foster  the\r\n\r\nbanking  facilities  available  to  this  commercial\r\n\r\ncommunity. In the absence of State banks  and  State\r\n\r\ncommercial banks, the Minister has himself said,  in\r\n\r\nanswer  to a question by the Member for Anson,  that\r\n\r\nthe private banks are in fact adequately meeting the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the commercial community. As the Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned  in  these  bathing  facilities,   he   is\r\n\r\nsatisfied  that these banks are, in fact,  providing\r\n\r\nan  adequate  service and he knows  of  no  instance\r\n\r\nwhere they have fallen down on their obligations  or\r\n\r\nfailed  the commercial community. Why then,  I  ask,\r\n\r\nare  we being presented with the Banking Bill today,\r\n\r\nand  why  does  the Minister ask that  it  be  taken\r\n\r\nthrough  all the stages at one sitting? The Minister\r\n\r\nintroduced the Bill in 1961. He said that because he\r\n\r\nhad other urgent business he had allowed the Bill to\r\n\r\nlapse.  I  do  not  accept the explanation  for  one\r\n\r\nmoment. Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has other motives for introducing this Bill of\r\n\r\nwhich he has not told this House. On the aspects  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government's motives in introducing this  Bill,\r\n\r\nthey should be ashamed. My colleague, the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill, will be dealing more adequately with that\r\n\r\naspect  of  the situation later on in  this  debate.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to  touch\r\n\r\nupon  those  motives which have led the Minister  to\r\n\r\nintroduce this Bill at this particular juncture. The\r\n\r\nmotives  indicate that the Minister for  Finance  is\r\n\r\ntaking sides in disputes which do not concern him as\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has said that in theory he\r\n\r\ndisapproves of Bills being brought into  this  House\r\n\r\nand  passed  on  Certificates of  Urgency  when  the\r\n\r\nissues  involved are vital to this country, and  yet\r\n\r\nhe  has said that in this case he is going to excuse\r\n\r\nthe  Government. I wonder what has happened  to  the\r\n\r\nsense  of  justice of the Member for Anson  in  this\r\n\r\nparticular instance? Has he got a phobia against the\r\n\r\nbanks?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister in his Second\r\n\r\nReading  said that the reasons for the Bill are  the\r\n\r\nproper  control and the proper supervision of banks.\r\n\r\nNow is he suggesting that any of the certified banks\r\n\r\nlisted in the Third Schedule has contravened any  of\r\n\r\nthese  reasons?

I meant to say \"Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker\". Sir, I accept the position that this  Bill\r\n\r\nis  necessary.  Of course, it is necessary.  We  all\r\n\r\naccept  that  position. It is necessary  that  there\r\n\r\nshould  he proper control over banks and that  there\r\n\r\nshould he proper supervision of banks. I agree  with\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Hong Lim that these  controls  are\r\n\r\nnecessary in order that in the future no bogus banks\r\n\r\nmight  come  up. But the point I am  trying  to  get\r\n\r\nacross to Mr Minister is this. Mr Speaker. Sir, if\r\n\r\nhe  is moving this Bill on a Certificate of Urgency,\r\n\r\nthen there is a suggestion that there are some banks\r\n\r\nwhich  are misbehaving from a banking point of view.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  has  made no such suggestion  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse. He has not given any reasons whatsoever as to\r\n\r\nwhy  this  Bill should he moved on a Certificate  of\r\n\r\nUrgency\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough  all three stages in this House. He has  not\r\n\r\nmentioned one word about that. One reason  he  tried\r\n\r\nto give was this. He said the reason for the urgency\r\n\r\nwas  industrial strife in some local banks.  Now  if\r\n\r\nthere  is industrial strife  - and there is industrial\r\n\r\nstrife  in  the banks  - surely the remedy is  in  the\r\n\r\nhands of the Minister for Labour, and not in rushing\r\n\r\na   Bill  through  all  the  three  stages  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly. He could refer all these disputes  to  the\r\n\r\nindustrial Arbitration Court. This industrial strife\r\n\r\nwill come to an end and the industrial disputes will\r\n\r\nbe    settled   properly   before   the   Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have always wondered why in\r\n\r\nall  these  bank disputes the Government  has  never\r\n\r\nsent   the   matters   to   the   Industrial   Court\r\n\r\nimmediately.  Insofar as the  Bank  of  America  was\r\n\r\nconcerned,  the strike was allowed to  last  for  19\r\n\r\ndays before the Government sent the matter up to the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration  Court.  Was  there  not  an\r\n\r\nurgency  at  that time? Why did the Government  then\r\n\r\nnot   send   up  that  dispute  to  the   Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration Court as soon as it broke out?  Why  was\r\n\r\nthis   Bill  not  introduced  at  that  stage?   The\r\n\r\nGovernment has not given any good reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are also informed by the\r\n\r\nMinister  that when this Bill has been  passed  into\r\n\r\nlaw   and   when   the  clearing  house   has   been\r\n\r\nestablished, what is now happening in Singapore will\r\n\r\nnot  happen. I venture to suggest to him  that  that\r\n\r\nwill  not be the position under this Bill. The  mere\r\n\r\nestablishment of a clearing house under  this  Bill - as  it  is  set  out in this Bill  - is not  going  to\r\n\r\nprevent   the  Bankers  Associations  from   getting\r\n\r\ntogether and doing exactly what they are now  doing.\r\n\r\nAll that the Bill does is that it sets up a clearing\r\n\r\nhouse.  All this Bill dues is, instead of the  three\r\n\r\nbanks  which are now acting as a clearing house,  to\r\n\r\nset  up  one  clearing house. That  is  the  general\r\n\r\neffect  of  it. But if the banks get together  after\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  - and this I pose to the Minister  in  all\r\n\r\nseriousness -   how  does  the  Minister  propose   to\r\n\r\ncontrol them? If they refuse to clear in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  way that they are now clearing, is the clearing\r\n\r\nhouse going to help the situation?

There were exuberance  and  zeal  which\r\n\r\ntook  a  lot of tempering. Minor mistakes of  haste,\r\n\r\nborn  out of impatience to put the world right, were\r\n\r\ncommitted. They were errors, not of the rashness or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwisdom  of the policy to be implemented, but of  the\r\n\r\nintemperate  haste  which resulted  in  insufficient\r\n\r\npreparation and the carrying of the opinion  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  which  could have been  done  by  prolonged\r\n\r\nconsultation and public discussion.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  this  referred  to the haste  with  which  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. during its first year of office rushed  Bills\r\n\r\nthrough  on  Certificates of Urgency. So I  thought,\r\n\r\nafter  having  listened to the speech of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  in  1960, that the P.A.P. had  learnt  its\r\n\r\nlesson  and  would  proceed cautiously.  Instead  of\r\n\r\nwhich  we now have very important legislation  being\r\n\r\nrushed  through  all its stages on a Certificate  of\r\n\r\nUrgency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance in his speech on the Second Reading said that it is desirable that Singapore and the Federation should have parallel banking legislation if the banking system is common to both territories. But is this proposed legislation parallel? It is not. It contains three\r\n\r\nclauses which are new and which are not included  in\r\n\r\nthe banking legislation in the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Minister refers to the reasons why this\r\n\r\nBill has to be taken through all its stages. He says\r\n\r\nthat   because  of  the  recurrence  of   industrial\r\n\r\ndisputes  between certain banks and  its  employees,\r\n\r\nthese   disputes   have  resulted  in   considerable\r\n\r\ninconvenience to the public and to the  trading  and\r\n\r\nbusiness  community. Sir, the truth of all  this  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  Bank Employees' Union is in the hands  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P., and they are playing party politics.  I\r\n\r\nmake  the solemn charge in this House that,  because\r\n\r\nthe  Union  is  a  P.A.P. union,  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance has said that unless an apology is given  by\r\n\r\nthe  bank  concerned  to  the  union  in  the  terms\r\n\r\ndemanded  by the union, he will introduce this  Bill\r\n\r\ntoday  and  rush  it  through.  I  will  make   that\r\n\r\nallegation  at  any  time before any  Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry.  He  did  say  this - that  unless  the  bank\r\n\r\nconcerned  did give an apology to the union  in  the\r\n\r\nterms demanded by the union, he would introduce this\r\n\r\nBill today and rush through all its Readings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is fond of saying that anyone who\r\n\r\nmakes  an  allegation in this House  must  face  any\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry.

The  whole trouble with the banks  today.\r\n\r\nSir,  is  because - and I will  not  touch  at  great\r\n\r\nlength   on  it  because  I  have  a  motion -    this\r\n\r\nparticular union, in the hands of the P.A.P.,  tries\r\n\r\nto  show  to the workers of Singapore that they  are\r\n\r\nindeed brave men, that they are indeed fighting  for\r\n\r\nthe  workers' rights, and that other unions  led  by\r\n\r\nother people, the Barisan Sosialis, are no good. And\r\n\r\nthey  place restrictions in the paths of unions that\r\n\r\ndo  not come under the control of the P.A.P. In this\r\n\r\nparticular   case  where  they  have  an  Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court, the matter could be referred  to\r\n\r\nthe  Court.  It has been referred to the Court,  and\r\n\r\nthere is a strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is a question of face. I will not touch on\r\n\r\nthe merits or demerits because I must say that I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  fully the merits or demerits,  but  in  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  this kind, Sir, surely the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  could have called in both parties and  given\r\n\r\nthem  a  stiff talking to and said, \"Shut up,  don't\r\n\r\nbehave  like  that. The economy of  the  country  is\r\n\r\ngreater  than any political Party and anybody  else.\r\n\r\nGo  back, do your work. Shake hands and forget about\r\n\r\nit.\"  They could have done it. Instead of this,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance is here introducing a Bill  and\r\n\r\nrushing  it  through all its stages with the  threat\r\n\r\nthat  unless  apology is given to  the  P.A.P.  Bank\r\n\r\nEmployees' Union, this Bill will be proceeded  with.\r\n\r\nThat is the true reason. Of course, the Minister can\r\n\r\ndeny  it.  But I make this solemn charge and  I  say\r\n\r\nthat what they are trying to do is not right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleague, the Member for Farrer Park, has\r\n\r\nsaid that we arc in support of the principles of the\r\n\r\nBill.  Why rush it through for the purpose?  We  are\r\n\r\nnot here to help the P.A.P. run P.A.P. unions. It is\r\n\r\nbecause of that that we are against this move on the\r\n\r\npart of the Government to rush through this Bill. We\r\n\r\nwill  oppose  the  Second Reading now.  But  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister will have it sent to a Select Committee, we\r\n\r\nwill  have  no  objection. In fact, we  support  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of the Bill, but we protest, and  protest\r\n\r\nvigorously,  against  the  reasons  that  impel  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  introduce  it  on  a  Certificate   of\r\n\r\nUrgency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, I had\r\n\r\nnot  intended to participate in this debate, but  in\r\n\r\nview  of  the speeches which I have heard, one  from\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Farrer Park and the other  from  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill, I think we  should  get  our\r\n\r\ncredentials right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Member for Cairnhill says he does not\r\n\r\nknow  what  this is all about.

He  was\r\n\r\nthen  a Member of the Executive Council, and he told\r\n\r\nme - I  was then a very much younger man - that I should\r\n\r\nlisten  to  him and settle. He said,  \"You  know,  I\r\n\r\nalways win. When I was a young chap, I kept fighting\r\n\r\nfish, and my fighting fish beat everybody's fighting\r\n\r\nfish.  They  asked, `How did you do that?'

To his\r\n\r\nfighting  fish every day he added a drop of  brandy.\r\n\r\nSo the fish got soaked\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup with it.

In this\r\n\r\nway  the  Malayan  Exchange  Banks  Association  has\r\n\r\ninflicted unwarranted hardship on the public -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> - and has attempted to convert every\r\n\r\nisolated  industrial dispute into a general  dispute\r\n\r\naffecting  all  the banks. This sort of  action  has\r\n\r\nbeen repeated on a number of occasions recently.  In\r\n\r\nthis  way  the  Association has held the  public  to\r\n\r\nransom  every  time one of the associated  banks  is\r\n\r\ninvolved   in   an  industrial  dispute   with   its\r\n\r\nemployees. There is as little justification for this\r\n\r\nsort  of  action  as  there will  be  for  the  Bank\r\n\r\nEmployees' Union to call a general strike in all the\r\n\r\nassociated  banks  of  the  Malayan  Exchange  Banks\r\n\r\nAssociation whenever disputes arise in  one  of  the\r\n\r\nbanks.  Government could not be expected to  condone\r\n\r\nsuch  a state of affairs if action of this sort  was\r\n\r\ntaken  by the union, which would have the effect  of\r\n\r\ncausing undue hardship to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers always complain to the Ministry of\r\n\r\nLabour  about the failure of trade unions  to  bring\r\n\r\ntrade  disputes  to  the Ministry  of  Labour.  They\r\n\r\nalways  complain to the Ministry of Labour  whenever\r\n\r\nunions  engaged in sympathy strikes sought to extend\r\n\r\nthe  dispute  in this way to firms or  organisations\r\n\r\nwhich  arc  not in any way involved in a  particular\r\n\r\ndispute.  If this sort of industrial action  on  the\r\n\r\npart of the unions is to be condemned because of the\r\n\r\nprejudicial  effects it has on the  economy  of  the\r\n\r\nState,  the action that has recently been  taken  by\r\n\r\nthe  Malayan Exchange Banks Association in  refusing\r\n\r\nclearing  facilities in the associated  banks  which\r\n\r\nare  not  in any way involved in the trade  dispute,\r\n\r\nmust  equally  be condemned. It is for  this  reason\r\n\r\nthat  a  clearing house has been set up under clause\r\n\r\n16  of this Bill. Clause 16 of this Bill is designed\r\n\r\nto  prevent  the Malayan Exchange Banks  Association\r\n\r\nfrom  resorting  to such improper practices  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  When this Bill becomes law, all  inter-bank\r\n\r\nclearing  arrangements will be put  on  a  statutory\r\n\r\nfooting  and operated from a central clearing  house\r\n\r\nunder  Government  control.  It  is  only  by   such\r\n\r\narrangements that Government can put an end  to  the\r\n\r\nhardship   which   the   Malayan   Exchange    Banks\r\n\r\nAssociation  has  improperly  sought  to  impose  on\r\n\r\ngeneral public whenever one of its members has  been\r\n\r\ninvolved in an industrial dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the Member for Farrer Park say to this\r\n\r\nHouse  that if this clearing house is set  up,  what\r\n\r\ncan  we do about it?

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I would refer the Member  for  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark to clause 31 of this Bill which provides that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Minister may make such regulations as may be\r\n\r\nrequired from time to time for carrying into  effect\r\n\r\nthe provisions of this Ordinance.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any such regulations made under those provisions\r\n\r\nwould  come under the provisions of clause  27.

The  only  powers\r\n\r\nincorporated are the powers of setting up a clearing\r\n\r\nhouse,  and to provide for the inspection  of  banks\r\n\r\nunder conditions of secrecy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is quite clear that no powers\r\n\r\nhave  been  included  in this  Bill  to  enable  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  determine the credit policy  of  the\r\n\r\nbanks   as  these  are  powers  which  are  normally\r\n\r\nexercised  by the Board of Directors of the  Central\r\n\r\nBank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it has been suggested that this Bill has been introduced from a spirit of vindictiveness on the part of the Minister for Finance. Mr Speaker, Sir, for the information of Members of the House, this Bill has nothing to do with the dispute that is current now between the O.C.B.C. and the\r\n\r\nBank Employees' Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Not the Bill. The timing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let us go briefly\r\n\r\ninto the facts of this dispute. An award was made in\r\n\r\nthe  dispute  between the Singapore Bank  Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion  and  the Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation\r\n\r\non  the  22nd July, 1961, and covered two categories\r\n\r\nof   employees,   the  clerks   and   the   clerical\r\n\r\nassistants. The award covered salary scales,  bonus,\r\n\r\nannual  leave,  casual leave, T.B. leave,  maternity\r\n\r\nleave,   period  of  probation,  overtime,   medical\r\n\r\nfacilities.  These  are what  are  known  as  fringe\r\n\r\nbenefits. A\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndispute arose between the Bank and the Union on  the\r\n\r\ninterpretation of certain provisions  of  the  award\r\n\r\nreferring to:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The redesignation of all messengers as clerical assistants and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) On the method of conversion of clerks from their old salary to the scale awarded by the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Union was satisfied with the salary awarded\r\n\r\nand   the   method   of  conversion   for   clerical\r\n\r\nassistants. But the Union claimed that all  existing\r\n\r\nmessengers  as  in  other Chinese  banks  should  be\r\n\r\nregarded  as  belonging  to  a  single  transferable\r\n\r\ncategory.  The Bank would not accept this contention\r\n\r\nand  disputed the contention that all the messengers\r\n\r\nemployed   in   the  Bank  belonged  to   a   single\r\n\r\ntransferable  category. In  other  words,  the  Bank\r\n\r\nmaintained that certain existing messengers were  to\r\n\r\nhe  left  out  and were not to be converted  to  the\r\n\r\nscale  of  clerical assistants. Both  these  matters\r\n\r\nwere  put  to the referee. The referee appointed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Court  was the President of the Court  himself.\r\n\r\nThe  referee ruled that in regard to the  messengers\r\n\r\nthey belonged to a single transferable category, and\r\n\r\nin  regard to the method of conversion of the clerks\r\n\r\nfrom  their  old  scale to the new  scale,  he  made\r\n\r\ncertain rulings. The Bank read the referee's rulings\r\n\r\non  clerical conversion in one way and the Union  in\r\n\r\nanother.  On  the Union's reading of  the  referee's\r\n\r\nruling, the clerks stood to gain, and on the  Bank's\r\n\r\ninterpretation  the clerks stood to lose.  The  Bank\r\n\r\nthen  took  the point that the referee had  exceeded\r\n\r\nhis  jurisdiction as referee when he interpreted the\r\n\r\naward. This was ultra vires as the full Court  alone\r\n\r\nhad  the jurisdiction to interpret any award. On the\r\n\r\nstrength of this argument the Bank moved to the High\r\n\r\nCourt  in  certiorari proceedings for  an  order  to\r\n\r\nquash  the referee's award on the grounds  that  the\r\n\r\nreferee  had no powers to interpret the  award,  and\r\n\r\nthat  it  would be against natural justice  for  the\r\n\r\nPresident,  who had acted as referee  to  be  called\r\n\r\nupon later as President of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Court to interpret the award. Although the Bank\r\n\r\ndisagreed   with  the  referee's  rulings   on   the\r\n\r\nredesignation  of messengers as clerical  assistants\r\n\r\nthe  Bank  did  offer payment to all  messengers  as\r\n\r\nclerical assistants in accordance with the award.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there was no dispute in regard to the\r\n\r\nconversion of messengers to the new scale awarded by\r\n\r\nthe   Court  for  clerical  assistants,  the   Union\r\n\r\ninstructed  its members to accept this payment.  The\r\n\r\npayment  was made in accordance with the  ruling  of\r\n\r\nthe  referee  that all messengers employed  by  this\r\n\r\nBank belonged to a single transferable category  and\r\n\r\nshould  all  be  converted  to  the  new  scale  for\r\n\r\nclerical assistants. In relation to the clerks,  the\r\n\r\nBank  did make an offer to the Union to make payment\r\n\r\nin  accordance with their reading of the  award  and\r\n\r\ntheir  reading of the referee's ruling of the award.\r\n\r\nThe  Union  refused to accept any  payment  for  the\r\n\r\nclerks  pending a complete clarification of all  the\r\n\r\nconversion  items  in  dispute.  There  were   still\r\n\r\ndifferences between the Union and the Bank as to how\r\n\r\nthe  clerks should be converted from their old scale\r\n\r\nto  the  new scale. The clerks going on to  the  new\r\n\r\nscale  had  different conversion points on  the  new\r\n\r\nscale  varying  with their length of  service.  This\r\n\r\noffer  by the Bank to the Union to make payments  to\r\n\r\nthe clerks and the refusal by the Union of the offer\r\n\r\ntook  place  in  September last year.  Subsequently,\r\n\r\nwithout the knowledge of the Union, and against  the\r\n\r\nUnion's  stated stand in the matter, the  Bank  made\r\n\r\npayment to a few individual members of the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Union also alleged that officers of the Bank\r\n\r\nhad attempted improperly to induce other members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Union  to  accept payment against  the  Union's\r\n\r\nwishes.  This was discovered by the Union  recently.\r\n\r\nThe  Union  asked  the Bank for an  apology  on  the\r\n\r\ngrounds  that  unilateral  arrangements  between  an\r\n\r\nemployer  and  individual members of the  Union  had\r\n\r\nbeen  made secretly, completely bypassing the Union,\r\n\r\nand  this  was  clearly an attempt by  the  Bank  to\r\n\r\nsubvert  good industrial relations with  the  Union.\r\n\r\nThe Union gave the Bank\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n48   hours'  grace  in  which  to  make  a  suitable\r\n\r\nexpression of regret and to give an undertaking that\r\n\r\nin  future  there would be direct official  dealings\r\n\r\nonly   between   the   Bank   and   the   recognised\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of the Union, and  that  they  would\r\n\r\navoid   entering  into  similar  secret   unilateral\r\n\r\narrangements  with individuals in the  future.  Even\r\n\r\nbefore  the 48 hours were due to elapse,  the  Union\r\n\r\nreceived a letter from the Bank containing a  series\r\n\r\nof threats to prosecute the Union for non-compliance\r\n\r\nwith  the award. Incidentally that was signed by  L.\r\n\r\nC. Goh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present strike has nothing whatever to do with\r\n\r\nthe  question  of  the  certiorari  proceedings  for\r\n\r\nquashing  the referee's order, which was  instituted\r\n\r\nby  the  Bank in the High Court recently. The Union,\r\n\r\nthe   Bank   and  the  State  Advocate-General   all\r\n\r\nconsented to this Order. It was right of the Bank to\r\n\r\noffer  payments  to  the clerks in  accordance  with\r\n\r\ntheir  reading of the award. But once the Union  had\r\n\r\nindicated  that  it disagreed with the  management's\r\n\r\ninterpretation  and would not accept  payment  until\r\n\r\nthese  disagreements  had  been  clan-fled,  it  was\r\n\r\nimproper  of  the  Bank  to have  made  payments  to\r\n\r\nindividual members of the Union behind the  back  of\r\n\r\nthe  Union. This was the issue which has led to  the\r\n\r\npresent strike. The application -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

That is  the\r\n\r\nonly  relevance, I think, of this statement, because\r\n\r\nI  cannot  see how the dispute between the Bank  and\r\n\r\nthe  Union has anything to do with the principle  of\r\n\r\nthis Bill and that is what we are debating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, I think the reason\r\n\r\nwhy -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The point is that the Minister\r\n\r\nhas   gone   into   details  which  are   completely\r\n\r\nirrelevant to the principle of the Bill.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink the Member for Cairnhill went into details. He\r\n\r\njust  said in passing that that was his opinion  and\r\n\r\nthat   it  could  be  denied  from  the  Ministerial\r\n\r\nBenches.  But  these  details,  which  seem  to   be\r\n\r\njustifying a Union's action, have nothing to do with\r\n\r\nthe principle of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have to trace the\r\n\r\nhistory of this dispute in some detail to show  that\r\n\r\nit   has   nothing  whatsoever  to   do   with   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances which led to the introduction of  this\r\n\r\nBill.  It is because of the ganging up of the  banks\r\n\r\nand  the  denial of clearing facilities and  of  the\r\n\r\nimposition that the banks have placed on members  of\r\n\r\nthe public that this Bill has been introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may refer to the point\r\n\r\nraised  by the Member for Anson. He wanted  to  know\r\n\r\nwhy,  under clause 34 of the Bill, the licences that\r\n\r\nwere  issued to banks under the Companies  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwere  deemed  to be issued under the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill. Mr Speaker, Sir, all banks are required\r\n\r\nto  be registered under the Companies Ordinance. All\r\n\r\nthat  this Bill does is to give a licence under  the\r\n\r\nnew  Banking Ordinance to banks which are registered\r\n\r\nunder the Companies Ordinance in order that they may\r\n\r\ncarry on the business of banking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member for Anson will\r\n\r\nlook at clause 32 of the Bill, he will find that  it\r\n\r\nseeks   to   amend  section  309  of  the  Companies\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  Section  309 of the Companies  Ordinance\r\n\r\nrefers   to  the  licensing  of  banks  which   have\r\n\r\nheadquarters  elsewhere which carry on  business  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Under  this  section  of  the  Companies\r\n\r\nOrdinance, such banks have to take out licences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo  such  licences are required under this  section\r\n\r\nof  the  Companies  Ordinance for  banks  which  are\r\n\r\nlocally incorporated and which carry on business  in\r\n\r\nthe State of Singapore. The provisions of clauses 32\r\n\r\nand  34 of the Bill require all existing banks which\r\n\r\nare already registered under the Companies Ordinance\r\n\r\nto  take  out licences. They shall take out licences\r\n\r\nunder the provisions of clause 34.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Any hon.

Certain Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition   regret  the  timing.  The  Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill,  in particular, thinks the whole  purpose\r\n\r\nof  this  operation is to favour the Bank Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion.  But  he  has not explained exactly  in  what\r\n\r\nmanner  the  immediate passage  of  this  Bill  will\r\n\r\nassist the Bank Employees' Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from our point of view, the issue is quite\r\n\r\nsimple. There has been a strike by the Union at  the\r\n\r\nO.C.B.C.  Whenever  strikes occur  at  other  banks,\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Malayan Exchange Banks Association,\r\n\r\nwho  control  and operate their own clearing  house,\r\n\r\ndecide  on  one  pretext or other to slow  down  the\r\n\r\nclearing  operation.  On  one  occasion  at   least,\r\n\r\nmatters  reached such a stage that nearly the  whole\r\n\r\neconomy of Singapore almost came to a grinding halt.\r\n\r\nWhen  this  particular strike at the O.C.B.C. broke\r\n\r\nout,  it  was  obvious  that the  same  practice  of\r\n\r\nrestricting inter-bank clearances would  he  carried\r\n\r\nout by the Exchange Banks. It is in the interests of\r\n\r\nthe Government to see that the general public is not\r\n\r\ninconvenienced.   The  most  obvious   and   easiest\r\n\r\nsolution is to see that the strike ends as early  as\r\n\r\npossible. If the strike continues for any length  of\r\n\r\ntime  with  inter-bank clearances curtailed,  it  is\r\n\r\nquite  evident that the Government must move in  and\r\n\r\nprovide the inter-bank clearances which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  banks  themselves are unable or  unwilling  to\r\n\r\nprovide. For these reasons, therefore, when  certain\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Exchange Banks saw me, I decided  to\r\n\r\nassist  in any way possible to bring the two parties\r\n\r\ntogether  to  an  early settlement. It  became  very\r\n\r\nclear  to  me that in this instance, the  union  was\r\n\r\nclearly  in  the  right and the banks  were  in  the\r\n\r\nwrong. There were absolutely no two ways about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Not only was the Bank in the\r\n\r\nwrong,  but it acted in the most extraordinary  way.\r\n\r\nThe Union members, in the first instance, decided to\r\n\r\ngive the Bank two days to make up their minds before\r\n\r\nthey called a strike On Wednesday. The banks held  a\r\n\r\nmeeting with representatives of the Union. Far  from\r\n\r\nachieving  any  settlement,  it  brought  about  the\r\n\r\nopposite  effect. Instead of waiting till  Wednesday\r\n\r\nto  strike,  they  went on strike  on  Tuesday,  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  day.  I tried to convince  the  banks  in\r\n\r\ngeneral and this particular Bank in particular  that\r\n\r\nit  was  not in their interests to continue in  this\r\n\r\nstrike and that, in my opinion, the terms offered by\r\n\r\nthe Union were moderate and reasonable and should be\r\n\r\naccepted  by  the  banks.  If  there  was  no  early\r\n\r\nsettlement  of the strike, I informed  them  that  I\r\n\r\nintended  to  bring this Bill before the  House  and\r\n\r\npass  it  on a Certificate of Urgency, set  up  this\r\n\r\nclearing  house so that the inconvenience caused  by\r\n\r\nthe strike can be restricted to the minimum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park thought I was trying to\r\n\r\nhide  something  and that I did not  give  the  full\r\n\r\npicture.  It was surely not necessary for  me,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  in moving the Second Reading  to  go\r\n\r\ninto  all  these  details. I  would  not  know,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  that  the two hon. Members  had  such  an\r\n\r\nintimate  interest  in  the subject.  But  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing that the Government has done that it has  to\r\n\r\napologise  for  and  be  in any  way  ashamed.  This\r\n\r\nparticular bank and the banks in general  have  only\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  blame  for bringing  this  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs  about. But in moving the Second Reading,  I\r\n\r\ndid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsay  that the reasons for proceeding with this  Bill\r\n\r\non  a Certificate of Urgency were the recurrence  of\r\n\r\nindustrial disputes in local banks and the  need  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  Government clearing house  so  that  the\r\n\r\ninconvenience  arising from such  disputes  will  be\r\n\r\nrestricted  in  their effect. That  is  the  general\r\n\r\nexplanation.  There is nothing for  me,  as  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  of  the  Government, to conceal  from  the\r\n\r\npublic.  If the Member for Cairnhill wants  to  give\r\n\r\nhis  evidence on oath, nobody is going to  stop  him\r\n\r\nfrom  so  doing. He can go to the Supreme Court  and\r\n\r\nsign a statutory declaration for all I care. I think\r\n\r\nI have dealt with the most important point raised by\r\n\r\nthe Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson asked whether there would be\r\n\r\nadequate  arrangements for the  clearing  house.  My\r\n\r\nreply is that the administrative arrangement for the\r\n\r\nclearing house was made several months ago  when  we\r\n\r\nforesaw that the time might come when the Government\r\n\r\nwould have to intervene in this matter. As early  as\r\n\r\nlast   November  all  the  draft  regulations   were\r\n\r\ncompleted, the administrative schemes drawn up,  and\r\n\r\nconsultations and instructions carried out with  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Bank in Malaya to see what their procedures\r\n\r\nare.  As I have said, arrangements are well in hand.\r\n\r\nThere  is  some difficulty about getting  furniture.\r\n\r\nThat  is the last report.

In clause 8 (1) (b) (i), it  says\r\n\r\n\"a  sum  equal to not less than fifty per centum  of\r\n\r\nsuch net profits;\". These are payments which are  to\r\n\r\nbe  made  into  the reserve fund - 50  per  cent.  The\r\n\r\nquantum  is  set  out,  of  course.  There   is   no\r\n\r\ndifficulty  about  it.  It is  related  to  the  net\r\n\r\nprofits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own experience and in the experience of the\r\n\r\nCourt,  they  have always found great difficulty  in\r\n\r\narriving at what net profits are. There is always an\r\n\r\nargument on what net profits are. Could the Minister\r\n\r\ninform  the House what exactly he thinks net profits\r\n\r\nare,  and whether it would not do some good to  this\r\n\r\nparticular  clause if the phrase  \"net  profits\"  is\r\n\r\ndefined? That is the first point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in sub-clause (2):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the Minister is satisfied that the aggregate\r\n\r\nreserve fund of a licensed bank whose head office is\r\n\r\nsituated  outside  Singapore  is  adequate  for  its\r\n\r\nbusiness he may by order in writing exempt such bank\r\n\r\nfrom  the  provisions  of  subsection  (1)  of  this\r\n\r\nsection.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  appears  to  me that under this  sub-clause  the\r\n\r\nbanks   which   have  their  head  offices   outside\r\n\r\nSingapore seem, on the face of it, to he on  a  more\r\n\r\nfavourable footing. The yardstick for foreign  banks\r\n\r\nis  adequacy for its business, but, insofar as local\r\n\r\nbanks  are concerned, it is another yardstick. Could\r\n\r\nthe  Minister explain to the House what  exactly  is\r\n\r\nmeant  by  the \"aggregate reserve fund of a licensed\r\n\r\nbank   whose   head   office  is  situated   outside\r\n\r\nSingapore\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is\r\n\r\nrather  difficult  for me at this stage,  before  we\r\n\r\nhave  any  experience of administering the Ordinance\r\n\r\nitself,  just  to  say  whether  or  not  any  tight\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"net profits\" is necessary.  My  guess\r\n\r\nis  that  it is not necessary because it  is  not  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of the banks having to pay out or  lose  any\r\n\r\nsum  of  money  which is based on net  profits.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  in the case of the Income Tax  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nthe definition of \"net profits\" must be a very close\r\n\r\none  indeed, because it is subject to taxation.  But\r\n\r\nhere  it  is  not. I would say that  that  would  be\r\n\r\nsufficient provided the accounts are set  out  by  a\r\n\r\nreputable firm of auditors and there is no  fiddling\r\n\r\nabout  with  the expense accounts and so  forth.  In\r\n\r\npractice,  of course, what I suspect will happen  is\r\n\r\nthat  most of the banks will have reserve  funds  in\r\n\r\nexcess of these statutory requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 8 (2), there is no question of treating\r\n\r\noverseas   banks   more  favourably   than   locally\r\n\r\nincorporated banks. So the difficulty is this,  that\r\n\r\nin the case of a locally incorporated bank, you have\r\n\r\nan easy criterion, that is, the paid-up capital, and\r\n\r\nso you can relate everything to that. In the case of\r\n\r\nbranch  banks  with headquarters outside  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthis is not always the case. You have to get another\r\n\r\nentity.  In  clause  34 (2) (b), for  instance,  the\r\n\r\nelement which is taken will be the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nequivalent of the paid-up capital or assets held  in\r\n\r\nSingapore in the form of immovable property or other\r\n\r\nkind  of approved assets. I rather suspect that,  in\r\n\r\nthe  first instance at any rate, that could  be  the\r\n\r\nyardstick   whereby   clause   8   (2)   would    be\r\n\r\nadministered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Clause 15 (7)?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Clause 15 (7), yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, on clause 8 (1) (b), I appreciate\r\n\r\nthe  Minister's difficulties in this  matter  and  I\r\n\r\nappreciate that until these things are worked, it is\r\n\r\nvery   difficult.  But  I  wonder  if  the  Minister\r\n\r\nrealises that non-compliance with clause 8  (1)  (b)\r\n\r\nis  an  offence  punishable under  clause  27  which\r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any licensed bank which is guilty of an offence\r\n\r\nagainst  this  Ordinance for  which  no  penalty  is\r\n\r\nexpressly  provided shall, on conviction, be  liable\r\n\r\nto a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  that  on  a  difference of opinion  between  the\r\n\r\nInspector and the bank on the question of  what  net\r\n\r\nprofits could be, the bank might find itself in  the\r\n\r\nDistrict  Court  facing a criminal charge,  which  I\r\n\r\nthink  is  not a very desirable thing. But,  on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  I appreciate that there  is  a  saving\r\n\r\nclause  that  no  prosecutions  will  be  instituted\r\n\r\nwithout  the  consent of the State  Advocate-General\r\n\r\nand  probably in such a case the the State Advocate-General  will  not  sanction  a  prosecution.

But  I  think  that\r\n\r\nstate of affairs is undesirable and the coming  into\r\n\r\noperation of the Clearing House should be `by virtue\r\n\r\nof   a   notification  in  the  Gazette  under   the\r\n\r\nMinister's hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the light of\r\n\r\nthe  disclosures  made to us this afternoon  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance, which of course, were met with\r\n\r\nboth amazement and consternation, I think there  can\r\n\r\nbe  no  question but that this House make this power\r\n\r\ncompulsory  - \"he shall\". No question of \"may\"  as  of\r\n\r\nnow. It is the duty of the Government to protect our\r\n\r\neconomy   from   the   irresponsible   conduct   and\r\n\r\ncontumacious  conduct  of  these  banks.   I   would\r\n\r\ncertainly  not  agree  to the first  amendment.  For\r\n\r\nmyself  I  want  to make it quite clear  that  I  am\r\n\r\nindeed  grateful  to the Minister for  having  taken\r\n\r\nsteps already to make possible the establishment  of\r\n\r\na Clearing House next week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second amendment, Mr Speaker, it does\r\n\r\nnot  seem  to me to have any real importance.  There\r\n\r\nare  35  banks  involved  which  will  naturally  be\r\n\r\ncommunicated  with.

The art of draftsmanship is not a simple  one.\r\n\r\nI  think  both  the Member for Farrer Park  and  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson will understand  that  it  is  an\r\n\r\nesoteric  one  which is not for general  lawyers.  I\r\n\r\nmean  that non-specialists in that particular  field\r\n\r\nof  the law should leave it well alone. There may be\r\n\r\na  whole series of interpretation arising out of  an\r\n\r\nalteration in the phrase. To my mind, the reading of\r\n\r\nthe  phrase  as it stands, \"shall at an  appropriate\r\n\r\ntime\", really means what the Member for Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nwants to do, namely, to make it a discretion at  the\r\n\r\nappropriate time. What is the appropriate time is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  which no doubt would be decided by officials\r\n\r\nand  other expert parties, and to change it to \"may\"\r\n\r\ndoes  not carry it any further. To leave out \"at  an\r\n\r\nappropriate  time\"  means we  go  into  the  banking\r\n\r\nbusiness  willy-nilly.  Not having  gone  into  this\r\n\r\nmatter,  I would say, on first principle,  leave  it\r\n\r\nwell  alone. This is not an amendment of  substance.\r\n\r\nThis  is  an  amendment of form. As to form,  I  say\r\n\r\ndoubtless the State Advocate-General, who has  spent\r\n\r\nsome   time   over  it - poring  over  the   principal\r\n\r\nOrdinance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  Federation from which he  has  adopted  and\r\n\r\nincorporated  several provisos - must have  considered\r\n\r\nall  these  points.  I would rather  leave  it  well\r\n\r\nalone.  I  would say, as to the first amendment,  we\r\n\r\nleave   both  \"shall\"  as  it  is  and   a   Gazette\r\n\r\nnotification does not carry the point any further. I\r\n\r\nshould imagine long before the Minister puts his pen\r\n\r\nto  paper, they would all be running around  to  the\r\n\r\nClearing House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I do not know whether it\r\n\r\nwill  help the Member for Farrer Park rather to  say\r\n\r\nthis.

The point is, \"I will do it.\"  As\r\n\r\nfor  gazetting this thing, the Member for Anson  has\r\n\r\nsaid that there are only 35 banks involved. In fact,\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry official have already got in touch with\r\n\r\nthem to work out the details of the operation of the\r\n\r\nClearing House.

The point of  the\r\n\r\namendment  was to invite debate on the  question  of\r\n\r\nwhat this Clearing House is, what it is intended  to\r\n\r\ndo,  and  how  it  will perform its  functions  more\r\n\r\nefficiently than it has done at the present  moment.\r\n\r\nIt  is only with that intent, and when that part  of\r\n\r\nit  has  been  satisfied, I intend to withdraw  that\r\n\r\namendment.  That is why, when I moved the amendment,\r\n\r\nI  said it is merely one of form, to invite a debate\r\n\r\nand an explanation of the term \"Clearing House\", and\r\n\r\nwhat   it   is  intended  to  mean.  The  subsequent\r\n\r\namendment  following  the word  \"House\"  is  one  of\r\n\r\nsubstance.

One  is  under Standing  Order  No.  69,\r\n\r\nparagraph (2), which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any such Committee [i.e. the Committee on the\r\n\r\nBill]  shall  have power to make such amendments  to\r\n\r\nthe  Bill as they shall think fit; provided that the\r\n\r\namendments (including new clauses and new schedules)\r\n\r\nare relevant to the subject matter of the Bill;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The subject matter of the Bill is the subject matter\r\n\r\nas  indicated in the title of the Bill, which is \"An\r\n\r\nOrdinance   to   provide  for  the   licensing   and\r\n\r\nregulation of the business of banking, and to  amend\r\n\r\ncertain  provisions of the Companies Ordinance.\"  So\r\n\r\nit  does  appear  to me that this amendment  is  not\r\n\r\nreally  relevant to the subject matter of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nand  there is, of course, authority to say  that  an\r\n\r\namendment is irrelevant if it goes beyond the  scope\r\n\r\nof the Bill. That is the first objection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second objection, part of the amendment\r\n\r\nanyway, seeks, in fact, to make an amendment to  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Ordinance. Section  28  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  indicates when a trade dispute should  be\r\n\r\nreferred  to the Industrial Arbitration  Court.  The\r\n\r\ncorrect legislative procedure for the Member, if  he\r\n\r\nproposes  to  pursue his subject on that  particular\r\n\r\naspect  of his amendment, is to take steps to  amend\r\n\r\nthat  section. I must rule it cannot be done by  way\r\n\r\nof   an   amendment   to  this  particular   clause.\r\n\r\nTherefore, my ruling is that the amendment is out of\r\n\r\norder and cannot be moved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I speak on the clause?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Prime Minister wishes to speak\r\n\r\non the amendment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, not on the amendment.

What I wish\r\n\r\nto  say  is this - that it then transpired, I think  I\r\n\r\nmust  say this in fairness to him, that he had moved\r\n\r\nthis  really for the purposes of debate and  he  was\r\n\r\nanxious  that  the Government should make  it  quite\r\n\r\nclear   that  it  is  not  the  intention   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  by  setting up this clearing  house  to\r\n\r\nallow the union to sort of pick the banks as victims\r\n\r\nin turn, one at a time, so that in that way one bank\r\n\r\nafter  the  other could be penalised. First  he  had\r\n\r\nexplained   that  obviously  the  bank   which   was\r\n\r\nrecalcitrant might lose custom. I pointed out to him\r\n\r\nthat  that was a possible method of operation if  we\r\n\r\nwanted to kill private banking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has already stated quite categorically that our entrepot trade, for various reasons, is best served by leaving the commercial banks as they are for a very long time, and it is not the intention of the Government to penalise or to milk each bank in turn. But I have said just now and I repeat this: if the banks, for various reasons\r\n\r\nof their own, decide to gang up against the union on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of one of its members and thereby bring  the\r\n\r\nwhole of the banking system to a grinding halt, then\r\n\r\nit is the duty of the Government to ensure that they\r\n\r\nare  frustrated in that attempt. For the duty of the\r\n\r\nGovernment is to maintain a fair balance. The system\r\n\r\nmust be kept going. As has been aptly described,  if\r\n\r\nyou shoot the pianist, the dancing stops. And it  is\r\n\r\nnot  the  business of the Government  to  shoot  the\r\n\r\npianist. But if the pianist refuses to play, then  I\r\n\r\nsay  it  is the business of the Government to ensure\r\n\r\nthat somebody is there in order that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  music  can go on and the economy  can  tick.  I\r\n\r\nthink  I  made  fairly  clear the  position  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. We are openly in favour of the  workers,\r\n\r\nbut  we cannot afford to allow either in the banking\r\n\r\nindustry  or  in any industry a situation  to  arise\r\n\r\nwhere  the  enterprise  upon which  the  economy  of\r\n\r\nSingapore is founded is run down to earth because it\r\n\r\nis  no  longer  profitable. The basic  principle  of\r\n\r\nprivate  enterprise  is the  profit  motive  and  we\r\n\r\naccept that, and that is the contradiction we  face.\r\n\r\nWe  have  inherited  a free trade  economy.  We  are\r\n\r\npledged to certain policies on behalf of the workers\r\n\r\nto  level down or level up benefits, and I  say,  in\r\n\r\nthe interest of both the workers and the economy  as\r\n\r\na  whole, a certain measure of free play and balance\r\n\r\nmust  be  maintained.  But if one  employer - in  this\r\n\r\nparticular  case  the  O.C.B.C. and  its   managing\r\n\r\ndirectors  - is recalcitrant, then I say it can  fight\r\n\r\nit  out with the union. We are not helping the union\r\n\r\nby  this.

Compared to  a  bank  whose\r\n\r\nminimum  capital is $2 million with an equal reserve\r\n\r\nfund,  where  do  the  financial  resources  of  the\r\n\r\nindividual  Members  come in?

To  a\r\n\r\nman  like  Mr  Tan  Chin  Tuan,  $5,000  is  almost\r\n\r\ninvisible; he would need a magnifying glass.  It  is\r\n\r\nabsurd  to suggest that we should penalise  by  only\r\n\r\n$5,000 a bank that does not provide a reserve  fund,\r\n\r\na bank that does not comply with the requirements of\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance.

I know that he will correct me  if\r\n\r\nI  am  wrong,  but as I read this clause,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nMinister   has  no  power  at  all  to  impose   any\r\n\r\nconditions  on a licence to an existing  bank  other\r\n\r\nthan  the  conditions which are existing already  in\r\n\r\n1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know from him now that some banks have no\r\n\r\nlicence  at  all;  so there are no  conditions.  And\r\n\r\nother  banks  probably  just have  licences  without\r\n\r\nconditions. So that it really means, in effect, that\r\n\r\nthe Minister has no power to lay down conditions  in\r\n\r\ngranting  the  licences  to  these  existing   banks\r\n\r\nalthough  he  has  the power under  clause  3(4)  to\r\n\r\nimpose  conditions in respect of grants of  licences\r\n\r\nto  new  banks.

If\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson will just say what he  has  in\r\n\r\nmind  quite  apart  from  carrying  on - he  must   be\r\n\r\ncarrying on a war with somebody - whether in  fact  he\r\n\r\ncould  say, \"These are the conditions I think  which\r\n\r\nshould be applied to banks of this type.\" If he  can\r\n\r\nsatisfy  the Government that there is a  great  need\r\n\r\nfor  that, then I think we might reconsider, but  so\r\n\r\nfar, quite apart from venting wrath on the banks,  I\r\n\r\ndo not think he has established a case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is an\r\n\r\nagonizingly frustrating experience to try  and  talk\r\n\r\nlogic  to the Minister for Finance. If no conditions\r\n\r\nare  necessary, why do we have clause  3(4)?  If  no\r\n\r\nconditions  are at all necessary for the control  of\r\n\r\nbanks,  why do we have the Bill? We have the  Bill - I\r\n\r\nwill  refresh  my  memory, Sir - to  provide  for  the\r\n\r\nlicensing and regulation of the business of banking.\r\n\r\nUnder  clause 3(4), I trusted him when  he  said  he\r\n\r\nrequired  the powers of conditions on licences.  If,\r\n\r\nin  fact, those powers are necessary for new  banks,\r\n\r\nwhy   are  they  not  necessary  for  banks  already\r\n\r\nestablished?  The Minister himself may  not  require\r\n\r\nthose  powers,  but,  as I have pointed  out,  every\r\n\r\ngovernment  is ephemeral and one does not  legislate\r\n\r\nfor  the  government in office. One legislates  from\r\n\r\nthe  permanent point of view. Other governments  may\r\n\r\nconsider  it necessary to have those powers.  It  is\r\n\r\nfor  the  Minister to convince us why there  is  the\r\n\r\nnecessity  for the distinction of treatment  between\r\n\r\nthese  two sets of banks and why he thinks that  the\r\n\r\nbanks  which  have no conditions on  their  licences\r\n\r\ntoday will never require controlling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Surely there is a distinction\r\n\r\nbetween existing banks and new banks.

For  the Government to say  that  a  well-established  bank  should conduct business  along  a\r\n\r\ncertain  pattern or should have certain  changes  in\r\n\r\nits  system  of  organisation,  I  say  that  it  is\r\n\r\ncompletely  unnecessary.

We  never\r\n\r\nagreed, Mr Speaker, to a roving Commission to  find\r\n\r\nout   what  the  gossip  is  in  town  and  in   the\r\n\r\ncoffeeshops  and  if  anybody has  any  gossip.  The\r\n\r\namendment  makes it quite clear, to investigate  all\r\n\r\nspecific  allegations. I give  an  undertaking  here\r\n\r\nthat  if the Member for Anson has any other specific\r\n\r\nallegations  which he forgot to list in  his  speech\r\n\r\nyesterday,  all he need do is to put  them  down  in\r\n\r\nwriting, evidence can be let on them, and the matter\r\n\r\nwill be investigated. But I would like to point  out\r\n\r\nthis:  that  it  falls  upon  the  Government,   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Law and myself, to invite a member  of\r\n\r\nthe judiciary to head such a Commission. I think the\r\n\r\nMember  for An son, not only from his experience  at\r\n\r\nthe  Bar  but also from his experience as  a  former\r\n\r\nChief Minister, will know that Judges do not like to\r\n\r\nbe  asked  to serve on Commissions with no  specific\r\n\r\npurpose  or task in mind. A considerable  amount  of\r\n\r\ntime  is  involved in hearing and sifting  evidence,\r\n\r\nand  they  must be convinced that there is something\r\n\r\nworthwhile   investigating  upon  which   they   are\r\n\r\nrequired to adjudicate. I think no Judge would  like\r\n\r\nto  be put in a position of a collater and collector\r\n\r\nof  gossip. On that understanding, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nsay  that any specific allegation made either in the\r\n\r\ncourse of this debate or subsequently by a Member of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  in writing or of improper  political\r\n\r\ninterference  will  receive  the  attention  of  the\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,   I   believe   that   the    former\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary  to  the  Prime   Minister\r\n\r\nyesterday  raised  something that concerned  me.

These notes were written by  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis Members recommending certain people to work\r\n\r\nin the Work Brigade. I think that in the course of a\r\n\r\nsocialist movement, if one is a socialist and  wants\r\n\r\nto  help  his country to become a socialist country,\r\n\r\nhe  will need to have more cadres in order to  carry\r\n\r\nout the work of socialism. In producing these notes,\r\n\r\nI  do  not  mean  to attack Members in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  My intention is to show that  the  notes\r\n\r\nwritten  by  them had nothing to do  with  political\r\n\r\nnepotism. Here is a note written by Chan Cheng  Ying\r\n\r\nto  me. At that time I was responsible for the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade.  The note says that Han Ching  like  to  be\r\n\r\ntrained  us  a Work Brigade leader. Chan Cheng  Ying\r\n\r\nrecommended  this.  This  note  is  very  brief.  We\r\n\r\nunderstand it is meant to recommend certain comrades\r\n\r\nor  friends  to join the Work Brigade  and  to  work\r\n\r\nthere.  Another  note  here - a very  brief  one -   was\r\n\r\nwritten  by  the so-called Chairman  of  the  Action\r\n\r\nCommittee  of  the  Work  Brigade  which  has   been\r\n\r\ndisbanded. He was then very active. His name  is  Wu\r\n\r\nEn  Pao.  He wrote this to the camp leader  at  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar, \"One Yang Chen Pao in the camp wants to  talk\r\n\r\nwith  Wang Chin San. He seeks permission to go  home\r\n\r\neveryday in order to carry out his work.\" I have  no\r\n\r\nintention to spend any more time on these notes.  If\r\n\r\nI  want to read out, I have many more notes to  read\r\n\r\nout here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, the purpose of my mentioning this is only\r\n\r\nto  prove  that the words uttered by the Member  for\r\n\r\nUpper  Serangoon yesterday were irrelevant and  were\r\n\r\ntaken  out of context. At this time when we want  to\r\n\r\nrealise  Malaysia, they are seeking out  trifles  in\r\n\r\norder to attack us in our work.

I want him to know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that what he has mentioned just now,\r\n\r\nwhen  he  referred  to  the  notes  mentioned  by  a\r\n\r\ncolleague of ours, he did not mention the dates.  He\r\n\r\nsaid the notes did not give the dates and times, and\r\n\r\ntherefore  could  not be taken as evidence.  On  the\r\n\r\nsecond  point,  he should know that  at  that  time,\r\n\r\nbefore  we  parted from the P.A.P., all our  actions\r\n\r\nwere done under the directions of the leaders of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Therefore, when I was appointed to the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade by the Minister for National Development,  I\r\n\r\nreceived many notes, including notes from the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  recommending P.A.P. members  to  work  in\r\n\r\nvarious departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few days before the Anson by-elections, I\r\n\r\nhanded over some secret documents from the P.A.P. to\r\n\r\ncertain  officers of the Work Brigade to be  brought\r\n\r\nto  the  Central Executive Committee of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nThese  documents  were  marked  \"Confidential\",  and\r\n\r\ntheir contents related to recommendations by certain\r\n\r\nP.A.P. members recommending some other members.  My\r\n\r\nactions then were done under the directions  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  At  the time when the P.A.P. was formed,  we\r\n\r\nfelt  that  if  there was no democracy,  we  had  to\r\n\r\nargue,  and  later on that led to  our  forming  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Upper Serangoon clearly told the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  we of the Barisan Sosialis  raised  all\r\n\r\nthese  issues.  Everything is based on  reason.  The\r\n\r\npurpose  of  this motion is not to hit  out  at  any\r\n\r\nmembers or Ministers of the P.A.P. We of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  have no such intention.

That I did, and I have, I think, about four\r\n\r\nor  five of them still noted down in my diary.

There  has\r\n\r\nbeen  intimidation of a reasonable extent of freedom\r\n\r\nof  speech. Secondly, in the original motion, I  see\r\n\r\nthere   is  some  merit  which  it  is  proper   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should consider, because,  as  has  been\r\n\r\nmentioned by the Member for Farrer Park, it is  true\r\n\r\nthat  since  the  Government  assumed  office  until\r\n\r\ntoday, there has been talk among the people of  this\r\n\r\nnepotism. They say that only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P. members will find employment,  or  at  least\r\n\r\nP.A.P. sympathisers  will   find   employment   in\r\n\r\nSingapore today. Therefore, if the Government really\r\n\r\nfeel responsible to the State of Singapore, there is\r\n\r\nno  reason  why this matter should be  considered  a\r\n\r\nloss to them. On the contrary, it should be an added\r\n\r\nprestige to the Government, because from the  events\r\n\r\nwhich  have taken place since the Government assumed\r\n\r\noffice,  we  know there have been many  splits  even\r\n\r\namong  their  own  members. It has become  a  public\r\n\r\ntopic. If there is no wind, the tree will not shake,\r\n\r\nso the Malay saying goes. So there must be something\r\n\r\nabout  ex-P.A.P. members who have defected  and  who\r\n\r\nwere  responsible for this matter. We ourselves have\r\n\r\nheard this expressed in the Assembly. P.A.P. members\r\n\r\nhave  spoken loudly about the overwhelming  majority\r\n\r\nthey had then. We would like to know who really  are\r\n\r\nsincere  in looking after the interest of Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhich  we  all wish for. The Hon, the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nmay say this motion is childish or puerile, or it is\r\n\r\npolitical tactics between political parties. But  we\r\n\r\nin  the  Alliance,  who  are not  involved  in  this\r\n\r\ndispute,  are  yet  responsible  to  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  we  wish to  know  who  are  really\r\n\r\nresponsible for these irresponsible acts. We do  not\r\n\r\nwish  these matters to be on the lips of the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, because, Mr Speaker, that will  lead\r\n\r\nto  the disunity of the people, and that would be  a\r\n\r\nvery grave matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  Sir,  when the Member for  Anson  and  the\r\n\r\nMember for Upper Serangoon jointly put down a motion\r\n\r\nimplying  political nepotism and  jiggery-pokery  in\r\n\r\nthe  civil service, everyone expected them  to  come\r\n\r\nout  with awful disclosures of irregularities. After\r\n\r\nall,  Sir, the Member for Upper Serangoon  had  been\r\n\r\nclosely associated with the Government for two years\r\n\r\nas   the   Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister. As such, he was in a position to  know  if\r\n\r\nanything  irregular  had  been  going  on   in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Moreover, his twelve colleagues, some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  whom  were Parliamentary Secretaries,  have  had\r\n\r\naccess  to many files. As regards the activities  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government, where there had been  consultations\r\n\r\nwith   them,   they,  jointly  pooling   all   their\r\n\r\nknowledge,  could have made some awful  disclosures,\r\n\r\nif  there  had been any. They could have  spilt  the\r\n\r\nbeans,  as  it were, and shaken the Government  with\r\n\r\nfactual  disclosures  about political  nepotism  and\r\n\r\nother irregularities on the part of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> They will tell the Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> We will be coming to the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson later on. But, Sir, not a single bean was\r\n\r\nspilt  alleging anything reprehensible.  The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Upper  Serangoon,  far  from  wading  into  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  with startling disclosures of  political\r\n\r\nnepotism,  gave the impression  - in fact he  made  an\r\n\r\napology -  that he was seconding the motion with vague\r\n\r\nreluctance. He said he had no intention  of  hitting\r\n\r\nout at the P.A.P. This cannot be because his Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis friends have developed a soft spot for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  since they treacherously  deserted  it.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the Member for Upper Serangoon has\r\n\r\nnothing  to hit with at the Government.  If  he  had\r\n\r\nanything  to hit with, I am quite sure  he  and  his\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis friends would not have hesitated to\r\n\r\ngo  for  the Government. But once he knew  that  any\r\n\r\nallegation  made would have to be substantiated,  he\r\n\r\ndried  up for words and allegations. Sir, it is  one\r\n\r\nthing making broad allegations in places where  they\r\n\r\nknow  they  cannot be challenged, and quite  another\r\n\r\nhaving  to  make  allegations which they  know  they\r\n\r\nwould  be  called upon to substantiate. Sir,  it  is\r\n\r\ncharacteristic  of  the Barisan Sosialis  that  they\r\n\r\nhave  developed  a  strong  aversion  for  the  open\r\n\r\nconfrontation.   As  you  know,   Sir,   they   like\r\n\r\nmonologues  but  shun things like  forums  like  the\r\n\r\nplague, because any statement made at a forum, where\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  prepared script, can  be  immediately\r\n\r\nchallenged  and  refuted. So the  Member  for  Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon was wise in not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaking   allegations  which  he  knows   he   cannot\r\n\r\nsubstantiate and which he knows are not true. So all\r\n\r\nthat  happened was that allegations of nepotism  and\r\n\r\nirregularities have now turned out to  be  something\r\n\r\nvague and' nebulous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson obviously had hoped for\r\n\r\nsupport  from the Barisan Sosialis. But I  am  quite\r\n\r\nsure,  Sir,  that  he  is  as  disappointed  as  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  are  at  what was  disclosed  yesterday.\r\n\r\nThere  was  nothing for them. The Member  for  Anson\r\n\r\nspent  some  time enumerating the number  of  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers  and  Assemblymen who had been appointed  to\r\n\r\nstatutory boards and other Government committee.  He\r\n\r\nwas  able  to  do that through the courtesy  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  which provided him with a list.  All  he\r\n\r\nsaid  was,  \"There are two P.A.P. members  on  this\r\n\r\ncommittee.   There  are  three  P.A.P. members   or\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  on  that committee,\" and  so  on.

Assemblymen  or\r\n\r\nP.A.P. members to boards and committees.

Is it suggested\r\n\r\nby the Member for Anson that we should pick names at\r\n\r\nrandom  from  a telephone hook and appoint  them  to\r\n\r\nboards and committees?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Why do you not listen -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member will have a chance\r\n\r\nto reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I have to endure listening to him\r\n\r\noccasionally, Sir. P.A.P. Assemblymen  and  members,\r\n\r\neven from the list, i.e. the enumeration provided by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson, constitute a minority in most\r\n\r\nof  these  committees. It is  natural,  Sir,  for  a\r\n\r\ngovernment  to  have a few nominees  whom  it  knows\r\n\r\nintimately,  in order to know what goes  on  in  the\r\n\r\ncommittees  for which it is responsible. After  all,\r\n\r\nSir,  if  anything goes wrong in a  committee  or  a\r\n\r\nboard,  it  is  the Government which must  take  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  Therefore, it is its  duty  to  see\r\n\r\nthat  people  whom it knows and trusts  are  in  the\r\n\r\ncommittee. As I have said, they always constitute  a\r\n\r\nminority of the members of any committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the P.A.P. Government took office, it\r\n\r\nmade  it  a  point  to see that P.A.P.  Assemblymen,\r\n\r\ninstead of being passive Back-benchers, were given a\r\n\r\nshare  of  responsibility in government work.  Every\r\n\r\nAssemblyman  therefore was attached to one  Ministry\r\n\r\nor  other. That is public knowledge. We have  stated\r\n\r\nso  earlier  on  when  the Government  took  office.\r\n\r\nTherefore, participation in committees and boards is\r\n\r\none way of delegating responsibility to Assemblymen.\r\n\r\nWhy  then is the Member for Anson surprised to  find\r\n\r\nP.A.P.   Assemblymen  openly  and   constitutionally\r\n\r\nappointed  to  boards and committees?  What  is  the\r\n\r\npoint  of  making a recitation that so  many  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  are  in this or that committee?  Is  it\r\n\r\nsuggested  that it is irregular? Or is he stating  a\r\n\r\nfact? Probably having no evidence, he just wants  to\r\n\r\nleave  an  impression behind that somehow the  whole\r\n\r\nthing   was   irregular  and  therefore  there   was\r\n\r\npolitical nepotism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he contends that what disconcerts him is that\r\n\r\nthere are too many P.A.P. members and Assemblymen in\r\n\r\nthese committees and boards. How much exactly is too\r\n\r\nmany  of  the  527 appointments which were  made  to\r\n\r\nthese boards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  committees? The P.A.P. Assemblymen and  members\r\n\r\nconstitute an insignificant minority. The Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  knows  it is not always easy to get  suitable\r\n\r\npeople  to serve on boards and committees regularly,\r\n\r\nand for the most part voluntarily. It is natural and\r\n\r\ninevitable that some of the nominees should be drawn\r\n\r\nfrom  party colleagues and workers whose  worth  and\r\n\r\nability  we have to acknowledge. Sir, where then  is\r\n\r\nthe  nepotism? Were the P.A.P. members appointed  to\r\n\r\nthese boards and committees unsuitable or corrupt or\r\n\r\ninefficient?  Or  were these committees  and  boards\r\n\r\nused  to  line  the  pockets of P.A.P. members  and\r\n\r\nAssemblymen?  If that was true, then the  charge  of\r\n\r\nnepotism  would  be  valid. But no  such  charge  or\r\n\r\nallegation was made. So far the allegation was  that\r\n\r\nso   many   P.A.P. members  and  so   many   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nAssemblymen were appointed to committees and boards.\r\n\r\nEqually, it was open to the Member for Anson to  say\r\n\r\nthat  so  many non-P.A.P. members were appointed  to\r\n\r\ncommittees and boards. Both have no point  to  that.\r\n\r\nWhat  is the significance to say that so many P.A.P.\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  or  members  and  so  many   non-P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers were appointed to this board or that  board?\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  Sir, from what the Member for Anson  said\r\n\r\nyesterday, it is not clear what the allegations  are\r\n\r\nor,  what  is  more  important, what  precisely  the\r\n\r\ncommission of inquiry is supposed to look into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson then went on to allege that\r\n\r\nP.A.P. members have been given government  jobs  in\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres, the Work Brigade, the Ministries\r\n\r\nand  the like, and that the Party imposes a levy  on\r\n\r\nsuch  members. Sir, this again contains no  specific\r\n\r\nallegation but vague charges. Of course, a number of\r\n\r\nP.A.P. members are in the employ of Government, just\r\n\r\nas  before  the  P.A.P. Government came  into  power\r\n\r\nthere  were  a number of P.A.P. members  working  in\r\n\r\nmany  Government  Ministries  and  other  Government\r\n\r\nbodies.   Is   the  Member  for  Anson,   therefore,\r\n\r\nsuggesting  that  a man should not  be  employed  in\r\n\r\nGovernment service or in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Work Brigade or in the People's Association just\r\n\r\nbecause  he  is  a P.A.P. member? The point  surely,\r\n\r\nSir, is not whether he is or is not a P.A.P. member,\r\n\r\nhut  whether he is qualified to do the job to  which\r\n\r\nhe  is  appointed,  and whether the  appointment  is\r\n\r\nproperly  made.  Merely to say that there  are  four\r\n\r\nP.A.P. members in the Ministry of Culture,  as  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson said yesterday, or that there  are\r\n\r\nso  many P.A.P. members in this or that Ministry  is\r\n\r\nnot even prima facie proof of nepotism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again a great deal has been made by the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson about the fact that  some  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers  who are in Government service are asked  to\r\n\r\ncontribute to the Party. As I have said, even before\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. became the Government, P.A.P. members,\r\n\r\nwhether they are in Government service or elsewhere,\r\n\r\nhave  contributed as they like to  the  Party.  Here\r\n\r\nagain,  Sir,  the  Member for  Anson  has  tried  to\r\n\r\nextract  some  sinister meaning out  of  all  these.\r\n\r\nThere  is  nothing sinister or unusual  about  Party\r\n\r\nsympathisers,  whether  they  are  in  or   out   of\r\n\r\nGovernment  service,  making  contributions  to  the\r\n\r\nParty.  For  example, Sir, it is a  well-known  fact\r\n\r\nthat all Ministers and Assemblymen, on this side  of\r\n\r\nthe House at least, pay a part of their salaries and\r\n\r\nallowances to the Party as contributions. Similarly,\r\n\r\nif  we ask members who may be employed in or out  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  to make contributions to the Party,  why\r\n\r\nshould  the Member for Anson even suggest that  this\r\n\r\nis nepotism?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even from the figures reeled off by the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson,  as  I  remarked  earlier,  they\r\n\r\nconstitute only a small fraction of the total number\r\n\r\nof  employees in Government service. Therefore,  the\r\n\r\ncharge  of  nepotism by saying that a few people  in\r\n\r\nthe  employ of Government are P.A.P. members is  not\r\n\r\nproof  or  even prima fade proof. What needs  to  be\r\n\r\nproved   to  make  the  charge  feasible   or   even\r\n\r\nreasonable is to show that the appointment was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimproperly made and that the person is holding a job\r\n\r\nwhich he is incapable of performing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson and the Member for Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon did none of these things. They brought  no\r\n\r\nspecific    allegations   for   investigation    and\r\n\r\npronouncement by an inquiry commission. All that the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  could  rely  on  was  a  general\r\n\r\nfeeling. In fact, throughout the speeches, the terms\r\n\r\nwere  \"They say; it is said; and there is a  general\r\n\r\nimpression\"   that  these  things  are   going   on.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  the  Member for Anson  used  words  like\r\n\r\n\"People are saying, and there is an impression  that\r\n\r\nthere  is political nepotism in the Government.\"  In\r\n\r\nfact,  Sir, to be quite frank, most of this business\r\n\r\nabout \"They say and it is said,\" originates in  this\r\n\r\nChamber.  Allegations are made here that people  are\r\n\r\nsaying  this and that in the coffee-shops. They  are\r\n\r\npassed  on to the newspapers and the next  day  they\r\n\r\ncome back and say, yes they have heard somebody  say\r\n\r\nthat  there is talk of political nepotism  and  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government is doing this and that. Very  often,\r\n\r\nthey listen to their own echoes and say that this is\r\n\r\nwhat  the  public say. There is no evidence produced\r\n\r\nthat there is definitely such and such a person  who\r\n\r\nis  prepared to come forward and say the  Government\r\n\r\nhas done this, that or the other thing. All that  we\r\n\r\nhave is a vague reference to a possible existence of\r\n\r\nnepotism in the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, having made these charges from time to\r\n\r\ntime,  Members of the Opposition have been given  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to come out with specific facts and make\r\n\r\nspecific  allegations, but none of them are prepared\r\n\r\nto  take the opportunity. Again there is vague  talk\r\n\r\nabout feelings and impressions. Sir, the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  wants  the inquiry commission to  investigate\r\n\r\nnot  specific cases and instances of nepotism.  This\r\n\r\nis  because  neither  he nor the  Member  for  Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon  and  the other speakers who  have  talked\r\n\r\nsince then have been able to pinpoint or crystallise\r\n\r\ntheir charges. It is like bringing a man to court on\r\n\r\na  charge of murder. When the defendant asks,  \"Yes,\r\n\r\nbut what\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmurder?  Who am I supposed to have killed  and  when\r\n\r\nand  with what?\" He is told, \"Well, how do  we  know\r\n\r\nwhom you have killed and when and with what? That is\r\n\r\nfor  the Judge to find out. All we are doing  is  to\r\n\r\ncharge you with murder in general, simply because we\r\n\r\nhope  that  the investigation may bring a murder  to\r\n\r\nlight.\" It is up to the defendant to defend himself,\r\n\r\nif  he can, against a general charge. As far as  the\r\n\r\nOpposition are concerned, they are not going to  say\r\n\r\nwhether  a  \"murder\" has or has not  been  committed\r\n\r\nexcept  in  a general and vague sense. They  have  a\r\n\r\nfeeling and impression that something wrong has been\r\n\r\ndone.  This reminds me of - in fact, I will  recommend\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Anson and many of  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers  to  read -  a well-known novel by  the  Czech\r\n\r\nwriter, Franz Kafka, called \"The Trial.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Have you ever read it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> In \"The Trial\" a man called Joseph\r\n\r\nKay  came to town and was apprehended. A summons was\r\n\r\nissued  against him that he was supposed to come  to\r\n\r\ncourt  for  trial. The novel deals  with  the  whole\r\n\r\nprocedure  of  the trial that was gone through.  The\r\n\r\nprosecution asked questions. Evidence was  produced.\r\n\r\nBut  neither  the  Judge nor the defendant  nor  the\r\n\r\nprosecutor knew what the charge was. Yet  the  whole\r\n\r\nrigmarole  ritual of a trial was gone through.  This\r\n\r\nnovel  ended  with the man suddenly  being  declared\r\n\r\nguilty. He was dragged Out. Two warriors came round,\r\n\r\nstuck  a knife in the side of his belly and finished\r\n\r\nhim  off.  Nobody knew what the charge was - not  even\r\n\r\nthe  victim himself. The implication is that it  was\r\n\r\nvery easy, by just going through the procedure of  a\r\n\r\ntrial - the procedure of making allegations which  are\r\n\r\nnot specific - to find a man guilty. That is precisely\r\n\r\nthe  technique which the Member for Anson and others\r\n\r\nhave  adopted.  No charges are made. But  they  say,\r\n\r\n\"Yes,  two P.A.P. members here, three P.A.P. members\r\n\r\nthere.  Therefore,  there  might  be  a  charge   of\r\n\r\nnepotism.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson made another\r\n\r\nallegation - it was not even an allegation but just  a\r\n\r\nhint of improper\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolitical interference with the civil service.  Sir,\r\n\r\nlet  me  say this, that what he, in fact,  has  been\r\n\r\ntrying to persuade me to do is to interfere with the\r\n\r\ncivil  service.  He  has  been  writing  me  letters\r\n\r\ncomplaining  against  the  News  Section  of   Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  saying  that  he  has  been  wrongly\r\n\r\nreported.  For  the information of  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson, I am told that yesterday he rang up the  Head\r\n\r\nof  the News Section of Radio Singapore saying,  \"If\r\n\r\nRadio Singapore in its 10.30 p.m. news reports  that\r\n\r\nthe  House agreed that the Referendum Bill is to  be\r\n\r\npostponed,  I am going to bring up this question  in\r\n\r\nthe Assembly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. In fact, I have received from\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson a complaint precisely in those\r\n\r\nterms which I am investigating, that Radio Singapore\r\n\r\nwas  alleged  to have said that the Assembly  agreed\r\n\r\nthat   the   National  Referendum  Bill  should   be\r\n\r\npostponed, which, of course, was not the  case.  The\r\n\r\nAssembly did not agree. It was a postponement  under\r\n\r\nthe  Standing  Orders. I might as  well  inform  the\r\n\r\nAssembly that the allegation is that the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  pointed out that that was a mistake -  a  false\r\n\r\nreport. But in spite of his pointing out that it was\r\n\r\na  false report, the News Editor put it on again  at 10.30 p.m. So I am investigating that complaint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not\r\n\r\ninterested  in whether that allegation  is  true  or\r\n\r\nnot.

We have never denied it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Including distortions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I understand that the charge of\r\n\r\ndistortions  is to come up before the  Committee  of\r\n\r\nPrivileges and I shall have the privilege of quoting\r\n\r\nthe   Member's   letters  and   my   letters   about\r\n\r\ndistortions    and   other   allegations.    As    a\r\n\r\nnewspaperman, I can tell you that the charge he  has\r\n\r\nmade  about distortion and unfair reporting has  not\r\n\r\ntwo legs or even one leg to stand on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the charge by the Member for Anson about\r\n\r\nimproper  political interference, the only  instance\r\n\r\nhe  brought  up was Radio Singapore, in addition  to\r\n\r\nintimidating some of the members of the News Section\r\n\r\nby  saying,  \"If you do not do this, I am  going  to\r\n\r\nbring  this up before the proper authorities.\" Apart\r\n\r\nfrom doing and saying that, he has not brought up  a\r\n\r\nsingle instance of improper political interference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, as far as I can see, none of the\r\n\r\nOpposition Members who have spoken on this motion on\r\n\r\npolitical  nepotism have a single bit  of  evidence.\r\n\r\nWhat  they hope for is to let loose a Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry with no particular directives. They  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  what to look for but they hope that they might\r\n\r\neventually  tumble on to something. If they  stumble\r\n\r\non   one   case   of   nepotism  or   of   political\r\n\r\nirregularity, they are lucky. But if they do not, it\r\n\r\nis  too bad. One High Court Judge has spent a couple\r\n\r\nof years hoping to unearth a piece of evidence about\r\n\r\npolitical    nepotism    or    improper    political\r\n\r\ninterference.  I am not a lawyer, Sir,  but  I  have\r\n\r\nenough respect for the Judge sitting on a Commission\r\n\r\nof Inquiry to tell him, \"Well, all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe can tell you is that there is coffee-shop talk of\r\n\r\nnepotism.  We cannot even tell you which coffee-shop\r\n\r\nit  is. Would you please investigate? If you manage\r\n\r\nto  get to the right coffee-shop, good luck to  you;\r\n\r\nbut if you do not, it is just too bad.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if that is the kind of Commission of Inquiry\r\n\r\nthe Members of the Opposition are proposing, then  I\r\n\r\nsay  that they are neither showing great respect for\r\n\r\nthe  Commission  of Inquiry nor for the  unfortunate\r\n\r\ngentleman who has to go around groping in  the  dark\r\n\r\nin  the  hope  of unearthing something  which  might\r\n\r\nprovide  the Opposition with ammunition against  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  But  at the moment,  there  is  nothing\r\n\r\nconcrete. In fact, Sir, if you look up the newspaper\r\n\r\nreports  on  this - I  am  told  the  newspapers  were\r\n\r\nlooking forward with great glee to awful disclosures\r\n\r\nalong the lines of Maria Monk to enable them to sell\r\n\r\nat  least  another five or ten thousand  copies  but\r\n\r\nthey  were  very disappointed  - the whole debate  was\r\n\r\nlimited  to  half a page. In fact, I can assure  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson - just before he starts blurting  out\r\n\r\nthat  I  had a conference yesterday, and I told  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers to keep it to half a page - that  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing  worth reporting. As far as scandalous  news\r\n\r\nis  concerned, the newspapers are ready to print all\r\n\r\nthe  news that is fit to print. But as far  as  this\r\n\r\nmotion on political nepotism is concerned, the tough\r\n\r\ncynical    and   hard-faced   newsmen   have    been\r\n\r\ndisappointed. They had been looking forward  to  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson and his colleague, the Member  for\r\n\r\nUpper   Serangoon,  to  provide  them  with   enough\r\n\r\ndisclosures to titillate their breakfast readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Member for Anson, who is obviously\r\n\r\nbursting  to  say  it out \"in green  ink\",  will  at\r\n\r\nleast,  before  he winds up, produce  some  concrete\r\n\r\nevidence of nepotism or irregularity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\ntoday   there  are  more  grave  and  more  pressing\r\n\r\nproblems  facing  us.

It was and  it  is  the\r\n\r\nintention  of  this motion not so much  to  seek  to\r\n\r\npunish.  You have seen, Sir, that we have sought  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss it with restraint and this has been made the\r\n\r\nsubject of jibes. It was not my intention to provide\r\n\r\nbits  for  breakfast  tables.  It  is  not  even  my\r\n\r\nintention  to  administer vengefully  the  odium  of\r\n\r\npublic  opinion upon those on the opposite  Benches.\r\n\r\nFor  let  them  know that there are  few  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore who would not want to wear a gas mask when\r\n\r\nthey see a P.A.P. Minister walking by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was my intention and it is my hope that\r\n\r\nthe  gravity  of  the charges should  be  adequately\r\n\r\nrecognised.  The  question is to protect  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice from the continuance and the perpetuation of\r\n\r\nan  evil tradition which undermines the entire basis\r\n\r\nof  government.  To  give  you  an  example  of  the\r\n\r\nincapacity  of  this  Government  to  hear,  and   a\r\n\r\npathological  urge  to vary,  I  would  ask  you  to\r\n\r\nremember  what you heard in this very  debate.  Last\r\n\r\nnight I heard what I believe to be a false report by\r\n\r\nRadio Singapore. I immediately pointed this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout to the News Editor and said, \"This is wrong.  If\r\n\r\nyou  don't  correct it, I will have to  report  it.\"\r\n\r\nThat  is  transformed, Sir, into intimidation  by  a\r\n\r\nformer  Chief Minister throwing his weight,  not  an\r\n\r\neffort  by a citizen and an Assemblyman to  give  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to Radio Singapore to correct a grievous\r\n\r\nerror,  because  it was going on the  air  again  at 10.30 p.m., and to avoid the need for referring  the\r\n\r\nmatter  to  Select Committee. That is the way  their\r\n\r\nmentality works, Mr Speaker. Again it was said, \"Do\r\n\r\nyou want us to go to the telephone directory? Are we\r\n\r\nnot allowed to appoint P.A.P. members?\" Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nbe  indulgent  for  a few moments  whilst  I  repeat\r\n\r\nmyself to show you to what extent they are incapable\r\n\r\nof hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make it quite clear - this was my speech,\r\n\r\nSir,  in moving it - it is not my suggestion that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should not appoint a member of its  Party\r\n\r\nto  public  office because he is  a  member  of  the\r\n\r\nParty. Quite naturally, it can and does happen  that\r\n\r\na  member  of  a  political Party in office  is,  by\r\n\r\nvirtue  of  his own merit, worthy of appointment  to\r\n\r\npublic  office.  I  recognise  that  those  who  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  go through the travail  of  dedicating\r\n\r\nthemselves to the ideals of a political Party  often\r\n\r\nare  sincere in their dedication to public  service,\r\n\r\neven  though  I  may not agree with their  political\r\n\r\nviews  or conduct. But what I do say, Sir,  is  that\r\n\r\nthe  numbers  involved  are  of  a  character  which\r\n\r\nlegitimately raise a query as to whether,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nsome appointments were made not merely on merit  but\r\n\r\ntook into consideration the fact that the persons in\r\n\r\nquestion  were  P.A.P. members  in  pursuance  of  a\r\n\r\npolicy to seek control of all aspects of public life\r\n\r\nfor party ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the extraordinarily revealing thing in the\r\n\r\ndebate  is  that  the Deputy Prime Minister  himself\r\n\r\nadmitted the charge. He has said to us, \"It  is  our\r\n\r\nduty  as  a  Government to control  these  statutory\r\n\r\nbodies.\"   This   is   indeed,   Mr   Speaker,   an\r\n\r\nextraordinary admission, an admission  made  out  of\r\n\r\nignorance of the constitutional position. I  am,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  charging the P.A.P. with seeking  control  of\r\n\r\npublic  bodies for party ends. Is he not aware,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, that the very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreason  for  separating statutory  bodies  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  machinery is that they  should  be  free\r\n\r\nfrom  political control and political  interference?\r\n\r\nTake  a case in point, Mr Speaker. The Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister sneeringly said, \"Does the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nexpect us to appoint him to the Income Tax Board  of\r\n\r\nReview?\"  (Laughter] \"Ha, ha, ha!\" And why should  I\r\n\r\nnot be if I had an adequate knowledge of income tax?\r\n\r\nWould  the fact that I am a Member of the Opposition\r\n\r\nand   have  this  strong  repugnance  for  gibbering\r\n\r\ngibbons, affect my judgment in deciding the  justice\r\n\r\nof  a  claim by the Comptroller of Income Tax or  by\r\n\r\nthe taxpayer? If that is what he has suggested, then\r\n\r\nhe  in fact admits, Sir, that he has his own men  in\r\n\r\nin  order  that their judgment should be prejudiced,\r\n\r\nand affected by their political affiliation.

I can understand they are more at home\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith mud.

It  is  their  guilty\r\n\r\nconscience which sighs with relief and which  crows.\r\n\r\nBut let us again recognise the aim of this motion is\r\n\r\nnot  to  fling mud. It is to seek the protection  of\r\n\r\nstatutory   bodies  and  the  civil   service   from\r\n\r\ninterference by men - who call themselves men -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Like the Member for Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The charges have been made and I am\r\n\r\nindeed  grateful to the Member for Farrer Park - I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  if he is present  - for the lucid and  fair\r\n\r\nmanner in which he expressed what I sought to say to\r\n\r\nthis  House:  the place for the specific allegations\r\n\r\nis  the  tribunal and is the Commission of  Inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  for Farrer Park drew attention  to  the\r\n\r\nmost curious feature of the Government's fears which\r\n\r\nwere  put into words by the Prime Minister  when  he\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Are  we going to allow the civil service  to\r\n\r\nbellyache  to  the Judge? \"Bellyache\". Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nwhy  this  word  \"bellyache\"? There is  an  arrogant\r\n\r\ntendency on the part of the Front Bench to denigrate\r\n\r\ntheir civil service and particularly on the part  of\r\n\r\nthe   Prime  Minister.

The very words of the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister are indicative of my charge that the  civil\r\n\r\nservice   is   being  intimidated,  and   improperly\r\n\r\nintimidated, by these men of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister asked whether checking civil service inefficiency is\r\n\r\ninterference.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  what  we  do  say  is  that  there  is   a\r\n\r\nconstitutional procedure of which the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture  seems  to  know  little;  a  constitutional\r\n\r\nprocedure  whereby  and  only  whereby,  the   civil\r\n\r\nservice  should  be checked. We are  against  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nthuggery  being  employed by  any  future  Party  in\r\n\r\noffice.  We  want to protect the Civil Service  from\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. type of thuggery. Again, Mr Speaker, the\r\n\r\nextraordinary pathological arrogance of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nis transparent in the Deputy Prime Minister's remark\r\n\r\nthat   the  Government  cannot  have  retired  civil\r\n\r\nservants  on  a  Commission because  that  would  be\r\n\r\nasking  former civil servants to judge  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment. What extraordinary pride! What fantastic\r\n\r\nego!  Mr  Speaker, all I can say is  that,  for  us\r\n\r\nnormal  human beings, we watch with amazement things\r\n\r\nlike  that  being confessed to publicly  before  the\r\n\r\nPress. Is it not recognised by this Government  that\r\n\r\namongst  our  former  civil  servants  are  men   of\r\n\r\nintegrity,  men of training, men who have  dedicated\r\n\r\ntheir  life-time to the service of  the  State,  men\r\n\r\nfrom  whom  you can obtain not only a just  decision\r\n\r\nbut  who,  having  been in the  civil  service,  can\r\n\r\nunderstand where the shoe pinches and can understand\r\n\r\nhow to recommend the protection of the civil service\r\n\r\nand  the maintenance of its integrity? No, Sir. \"We,\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P., can never be judged by anybody who is  a\r\n\r\nmere  civil  servant retired.\" That  is  the  mental\r\n\r\napproach  of the so-called socialists of  the  Front\r\n\r\nBench.  This  contempt for the civil  service,  this\r\n\r\narrogant  superiority on the part of the  Government\r\n\r\nto  the civil service is something that no Member of\r\n\r\nthis House not blinded by party affiliation like the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture could ever tolerate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, in a point of\r\n\r\nelucidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You have seen what has happened to me\r\n\r\nby  granting  courtesies.

Nevertheless, this motion  will  serve  its\r\n\r\npurpose  if  only  to  remind  the  Government  that\r\n\r\n\"merger\"  is  not a One-Party issue but  a  national\r\n\r\nissue  and  therefore  an All-Party  issue,  and  it\r\n\r\nshould be treated as such. If only this motion  will\r\n\r\nhelp to show the P.A.P. its past mistakes and if the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. would  only  admit these mistakes  and  take\r\n\r\nappropriate steps to rectify them, then the time  of\r\n\r\nthe House wilt not have been wasted in debating this\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much of what I have intended to say in this\r\n\r\nmotion has already been said in the debate on merger\r\n\r\nand my amendment to it.

It is a  national\r\n\r\nissue affecting the lives and the future of each and\r\n\r\nevery one of us in Singapore. Yes, even our children\r\n\r\nand  all our future generations will be affected  by\r\n\r\nthe way in which we resolve this national issue.  If\r\n\r\nit  was  really a private matter affecting only  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and  no other people, then the P.A.P. could\r\n\r\nmake it a One-Party internal matter and no one would\r\n\r\ncomplain. For example, if all the Assemblymen on the\r\n\r\nGovernment Back-benches should gang up together  and\r\n\r\noust   the   arrogant  Ministers  from  their   high\r\n\r\npedestals,  then  we would just watch  and  let  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. handle its own affairs and settle  them  the\r\n\r\nway  it  wants.  But  merger, Sir,  is  an  entirely\r\n\r\ndifferent  matter. It affects the lives  of  present\r\n\r\nand  future generations and as such transcends party\r\n\r\npolitics.  Political Parties represent only  certain\r\n\r\nsections  of the people and one would have  expected\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. to have the magnanimity  to  treat  the\r\n\r\nissue   with   all   the  national  importance   and\r\n\r\nconsideration  it  deserves  and  not  make   it   a\r\n\r\ncompletely One-Party affair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. surely knows that there are different\r\n\r\naspects  of  the  problem which will  give  rise  to\r\n\r\ndifferent   viewpoints,  and   that   an   All-Party\r\n\r\nconsultation would be necessary as all the different\r\n\r\nviews   representing  different  sections   of   the\r\n\r\npopulation  would help to give a proper  perspective\r\n\r\nand  better  understanding of the  issue  at  stake,\r\n\r\nespecially so today when the P.A.P. is only a shadow\r\n\r\nof  its former self - a mere shell - and cannot, by  any\r\n\r\nstretch  of the imagination, be said to be a popular\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  can claim to be representative  of\r\n\r\nthe  people.  The P.A.P. has not only not  consulted\r\n\r\nthe other political Parties, both inside and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noutside  the Assembly, on this all important  merger\r\n\r\nissue,  but  has  also been so  dictatorial  in  its\r\n\r\nbehaviour  inside the Assembly, in the  way  it  has\r\n\r\ngone  about its interjectory motions and lifting  of\r\n\r\nStanding  Orders during the last few  sittings -   all\r\n\r\nwithout  prior consultation with Opposition  Parties\r\n\r\nthat all the people of Singapore today know that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is still as dictatorial as ever, and that it\r\n\r\nis  all the time trying to impose a one-man majority\r\n\r\nparliamentary  dictatorship in the Assembly  and  in\r\n\r\nthe whole of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remind the House of the shameful record of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. in its attempts at hiding the  facts  of\r\n\r\nmerger  from  the  people and from  other  political\r\n\r\nParties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) When the Yang di-Pertuan Negara spoke of the\r\n\r\ntremendous  drama that had accompanied the  progress\r\n\r\nand  development of merger and Malaysia talks in the\r\n\r\nlast five months - now 7\ufffd months -  we had already known\r\n\r\nof  the secret negotiations of the Prime Minister of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and the Prime Minister of the  Federation\r\n\r\nfor quite some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) During the Anson by-election, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  said  that  merger  must  follow   certain\r\n\r\nconditions which must be approved by the people  and\r\n\r\nnot  by the Ministers. I hope the Prime Minister and\r\n\r\nhis  ministerial  colleagues will not  forget  these\r\n\r\nwords of promise they made to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) There was further mention of \"merger\" by the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  over  Radio  Singapore,  now  Radio\r\n\r\nP.A.P., on 27th July, 1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) On 8th August, 1961, according to the Tunku,\r\n\r\nmerger was only an informal proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) On 23rd August, 1961, the first joint\r\n\r\nstatement of the two Prime Minister was issued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) It was three days later, on 26th August, 1961,\r\n\r\nthat  the Acting Prime Minister wrote to the leaders\r\n\r\nof  the Opposition Parties, purporting to seek their\r\n\r\nviews on the two points already\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagreed to, in principle, by the two Prime Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here was the Government having negotiations\r\n\r\nwith   the   Federation  on  a  matter  of  national\r\n\r\nimportance,  on a matter that concerns  everyone  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Yet  the  people  and  other   political\r\n\r\nParties  knew  nothing about it until agreement  had\r\n\r\nbeen reached in principle. Concern was expressed  by\r\n\r\ncivil  organisations,  unions  and  leaders  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore and Chinese Chambers of Commerce. We  were\r\n\r\nwondering  if there was any meaning in  that  letter\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Acting Prime Minister. The  Acting  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  asked  if we agreed to the two  principles\r\n\r\nalready  agreed  to.  Was it a genuine  and  sincere\r\n\r\nseeking  of views? If it was meant to be  a  sincere\r\n\r\nseeking of views and a form of consultation, then it\r\n\r\nshould   have  been  sent  before,  and  not  after,\r\n\r\nagreement  had  already been  reached  in  principle\r\n\r\nbetween the two Prime Ministers. In our reply to the\r\n\r\nActing  Prime  Minister on 1st September,  1961,  we\r\n\r\npointed  out that the attitude of the Government  in\r\n\r\ngoing about its business, regardless of the views of\r\n\r\nthe others, especially on a matter of such magnitude\r\n\r\nand importance affecting our entire people, was,  to\r\n\r\nsay   the  least,  most  reprehensible.  Under   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  we could not help but  come  to  the\r\n\r\nconclusion  that  the letter from the  Acting  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  was  only intended to deceive  the  people\r\n\r\ninto believing that all Parties were being consulted\r\n\r\nin the P.A.P. attempt to sign away the future of our\r\n\r\npeople.  The  fact that this letter was released  to\r\n\r\nthe Press even before replies were received from the\r\n\r\nOpposition leaders, showed the farce and insincerity\r\n\r\nof  this  so-called consultation. It  is  absolutely\r\n\r\nclear that this letter was a result of after-thought\r\n\r\nfor  the P.A.P.'s earlier sin of omission. And  what\r\n\r\nwas  the  purpose of this cheap political propaganda\r\n\r\nstunt   but  to  deceive  and  sell-out?  Even   the\r\n\r\nreactionary Lim Yew Hock Government had to take heed\r\n\r\nof   the   public   when   it   came   to   consider\r\n\r\nconstitutional matters in 1958. All the Parties were\r\n\r\nfirst   consulted  and  they  had  agreed   to   the\r\n\r\nprinciples  before they proceeded to negotiate  upon\r\n\r\nthem -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

As soon as we came in,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwe   began   to   repeal  parts  of  the   Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations   and  finally  reviewed  the   question\r\n\r\nwhether   we  could  repeal  the  whole   of   those\r\n\r\ndeservedly unpopular regulations. The Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  sent  urgent  representations  through   its\r\n\r\nDefence  Secretary  and Chief of  Operations  urging\r\n\r\nupon  us  the gravity of relaxing the measures,  and\r\n\r\nout  of  deference  and because  we  had  not  fully\r\n\r\nstudied  with  the  question,  Sir,  we  agreed   to\r\n\r\ntemporary  measures  pending further  study  of  the\r\n\r\nissue. Those temporary measures were incorporated in\r\n\r\nwhat  is  now  known as the Preservation  of  Public\r\n\r\nSecurity Ordinance wherein it was sought to give the\r\n\r\nmaximum  security for the citizen within the context\r\n\r\nof  basic  security of the country.

The law\r\n\r\nthat  was  passed was for three years, so  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should have to account to  the  Assembly\r\n\r\nbefore  that  Assembly ended its life. The  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour (then the Member for Sembawang, Che Ahmad\r\n\r\nIbrahim) during that debate said, \"These Regulations\r\n\r\nwere  no  longer serving the purpose of  saving  the\r\n\r\ncountry from a grave political crisis, but were,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  a fetter on the political development of  the\r\n\r\npeople  in this country. Trade unionists and freedom\r\n\r\nfighters  were  fully alive to this  threat  to  the\r\n\r\nMalayan freedom movement and to ordinary trade union\r\n\r\nactivity.\"  The present Prime Minister,  during  the\r\n\r\ndebate  in  1955 did not deny that the law  was  far\r\n\r\nbetter than the existing Emergency Regulations  and,\r\n\r\nin fact, stated in col. 723:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is an advance, I am not denying that.

When\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P. took  office  there  were  61  persons\r\n\r\ndetained  by  the Member for Cairnhill's Government,\r\n\r\nand the P.A.P. itself in the two and a half years it\r\n\r\nhas  been in office has detained 30 persons in  all.\r\n\r\nOn  14th October, 1959, Sir, an amendment to  the  P.P.S.O. was introduced by the Prime Minister of the\r\n\r\npresent  P.A.P.  Government  on  a  Certificate   of\r\n\r\nUrgency.  It  was  passed  on  the  same  day.   The\r\n\r\namendment abolished the tribunal of three Judges and\r\n\r\nthe power of the tribunal to make orders contrary to\r\n\r\nthe  wishes of the Government if it considered  that\r\n\r\nthere were inadequate reasons for further detention.\r\n\r\nThis  Government abolished the very safeguard  which\r\n\r\nwas  placed by the Prime Minister when he was in the\r\n\r\nOpposition  at the time it was passed.

The purpose of this motion is to urge upon all Members of this House to recognise that we have in our midst two\r\n\r\nmajor  breaches in the rule of law, that  they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  in operation for a considerable period of time\r\n\r\nand  that  they  have not been adequately  examined.\r\n\r\nThere have been no reports on them. I say that we in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  and  the  people  of  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nentitled to have from the Government a report on its\r\n\r\nworking  from  its  inception. I for  one,  who  was\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  its  creation  and  in  part   had\r\n\r\nadministered  it,  have no fear of  any  disclosures\r\n\r\nthat  could  be  made.

But  I\r\n\r\nam  convinced, after listening to him for  the  last\r\n\r\ntwenty  minutes - I  was not here for  the  first  two\r\n\r\nminutes - that  that  is  not  the  position.  He  was\r\n\r\nentrusted with the survival of the State,  and  when\r\n\r\nhe was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentrusted with the survival of the State, he made no\r\n\r\nbones  about his responsibility and of the necessity\r\n\r\nto  have  these laws. He quoted India  and  Pakistan\r\n\r\nwith great eloquence to demonstrate to the then semi-elected  Assembly how independent countries  had  to\r\n\r\nprotect  their  integrity  and  survival  from   the\r\n\r\nruthless  machinations of those whom he  hated  from\r\n\r\nthe very bottom of his belly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

And now I hear from him not in  the\r\n\r\nsame  voice, but in a different one. He is  now  the\r\n\r\nchampion, albeit in a back-handed way  - how  nice  it\r\n\r\nwould be to have a chap like the Member for Anson as\r\n\r\nPrime Minister - he believes them all. We should  deal\r\n\r\nwith  them  gently, and only detain them  for  short\r\n\r\nperiods.   I  say  to  him  that  in  the   art   of\r\n\r\nbrinkmanship,  there  are  two  qualities  required.\r\n\r\nFirst  a fine judgment of just how far one wants  to\r\n\r\ngo,  and  that depends on what one is fighting  for:\r\n\r\nand second, the ability, when the time requires,  to\r\n\r\nstand  up and fight. And I say, when we took office,\r\n\r\nwe  had calculated all the odds involved and I stand\r\n\r\nby  every  word  of that document to  which  he  has\r\n\r\nreferred.  Once we released Mr Lim Ching Siong,  it\r\n\r\nis  utterly  irrelevant and trivial to hold  up  the\r\n\r\nbalance  of these people whom from time to  time  we\r\n\r\nshall  release till the last of them are out. I  say\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis  and their  chief  performers\r\n\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all a purely academic argument. It is a\r\n\r\nwaste of time and we want to get it out of the  way.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  for  Anson - I say from  my  information,\r\n\r\nknowledge  and  belief - understands  full  well  that\r\n\r\nwithout  the  P.P.S.O. and the judicial exercise  of\r\n\r\nthose  powers on the right target, there is not  the\r\n\r\nslightest  hope of democracy surviving.  He  himself\r\n\r\nhas  admitted it. You do not have to use any powers,\r\n\r\nsays  he. All you have to do is to threaten, and  it\r\n\r\nis  not the Government who does the threatening.  It\r\n\r\nis  the  chaps who run the underground and  say,  \"I\r\n\r\nwill fix you - and I will fix you in a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquiet corner  - not in accordance with the law, but in\r\n\r\naccordance with the gun.\" And they get obedience. We\r\n\r\nhave seen in this very Chamber how chaps have melted\r\n\r\naway. They believed in democracy. But when the  heat\r\n\r\nwas  put  on, they melted away: mind you,  believing\r\n\r\nthat  the other side was going to win. But  that  is\r\n\r\nanother  matter.  That is the tragedy  that  we  are\r\n\r\nfaced  with, that few people have sufficient  belief\r\n\r\nin  democracy to stand up and fight for it  and  die\r\n\r\nfor  it.  The tragedy I was touched by just now  was\r\n\r\nthat once I used to list the persons who would fight\r\n\r\nand  die for democracy. I am afraid, after listening\r\n\r\nto  the  Member for Anson just now, I will  have  to\r\n\r\nscratch  him  from the list. He is no more.  He  may\r\n\r\nhave  started,  Mr Speaker, Sir, as a  naive  well-meaning  liberal. By the time he was finished  with\r\n\r\n15 or 16 months as Chief Minister in one of the most\r\n\r\nturbulent periods of Singapore's history since 1945,\r\n\r\nhe  knew what this was all about. He told me what it\r\n\r\nwas  all  about. I think he ought to do me at  least\r\n\r\nthis  one act of justice, that I have never  at  any\r\n\r\ntime  denied any of the truths he tittered  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  truths which I knew to be true.  But  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson locked up Mr Fong Swee Suan.  And\r\n\r\nhe  is  an evil-doer. I never denied it. We  pleaded\r\n\r\nand appealed to his better nature. It was my duty as\r\n\r\nSecretary-General  of  the  Party.  I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  it  was my plea or the ferocious utterances\r\n\r\nof  the  supporters of the Bus Workers'  Union  that\r\n\r\npersuaded the Member for Anson to release  Mr  Fong\r\n\r\nSwee  Suan. I like to believe that it was my  gentle\r\n\r\nplea for mercy that made act in that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when all the sweet talk about liberty and the\r\n\r\nrights  of  men is over, I say there is a  right  of\r\n\r\nself  defence,  and  the Members on  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nBenches, the Barisan Sosialis, understand that. They\r\n\r\nknow  it full well. In the last resort, what worries\r\n\r\nme  is  not that there will be three Judges  or  one\r\n\r\nJudge  who will review these matters. Does it really\r\n\r\nmatter?  Any government that abuses the P.P.S.O. to\r\n\r\nuse  it against non-Communists destroys the efficacy\r\n\r\nof the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.P.S.O.

Because to make it\r\n\r\nan effective instrument, you must be judicious. Then\r\n\r\npeople know. Ah, quite right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> What about reporters?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Reporters? We said quite\r\n\r\nrightly that they were not Communists. I thought  we\r\n\r\nhad  dealt with it under the Criminal Law (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions)  Ordinance. We said so. When  they  were\r\n\r\nnot Communists, we named them. A.R.T.I.S.  - they were\r\n\r\nnot  Communists  - we named them. But I say or him and\r\n\r\nthe former man entrusted with power deliberately  to\r\n\r\ncast  a  cloud  over it, to say that the  democratic\r\n\r\nliberal  line is quite innocent leaves me completely\r\n\r\ncynical.  If  you remove these powers, he  knows  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  everybody else that he will not  be   going\r\n\r\nbefore  a Judge and arguing these things out:  in  a\r\n\r\nvery  short  while  you will be  lynching  chaps  in\r\n\r\nOrchard Circus and settling matters there. He cannot\r\n\r\ndeny  that.  He knows it. What worries me  is  this,\r\n\r\nthat there will be enough stupid chaps in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  elsewhere  in Malaya and in Malaysia  who  will\r\n\r\nmake  it  increasingly difficult for us to  maintain\r\n\r\nthe  democratic  tradition  because  they  play  the\r\n\r\nundemocratic game. That is the tragedy. I would tell\r\n\r\nthe Member for Nee Soon particularly - and I have told\r\n\r\nhim  this  long  before  these  serious  errors   of\r\n\r\ncalculations were made - that in the last  resort,  if\r\n\r\nthe  Communists  use methods of intimidation,  force\r\n\r\nand   pressure,  they  cannot  expect  a  democratic\r\n\r\ngovernment to sit back and allow itself to be  eaten\r\n\r\naway;  and  the  more the methods  of  pressure  and\r\n\r\nintimidation,  the Central Government  will,  albeit\r\n\r\nreluctantly, have to act with firmness,  regret  and\r\n\r\neffectiveness.  But I think the  operative  word  is\r\n\r\n\"effectiveness\".
