However, I fully endorse\r\n\r\nthe  views of the Member for Choa Chu Kang on this\r\n\r\nquestion  of  the  Government having  to  come  to\r\n\r\nParliament and ask it to endorse a vote of  nearly\r\n\r\n$5 million.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the amount of expenditure that  has\r\n\r\nto  be  incurred to pay these increases in  salary\r\n\r\nfor  the police personnel, which was decided  upon\r\n\r\nby  the Malaysian Government when we were part  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia, could have and has been anticipated.  It\r\n\r\nis  for  purely technical reasons that we did  not\r\n\r\ninclude  it in our Budget, because once  provision\r\n\r\nis  made  from  our own funds, then it  makes  our\r\n\r\nposition  at the bargaining table more  difficult.\r\n\r\nThe  total increase amounted to $8,112,480,  which\r\n\r\nwas fully paid by the Malaysian Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an accounting procedure that all receipts\r\n\r\nshould go into revenue and all payments should  be\r\n\r\nvoted for under the heads.

Eighty per cent of the retirements\r\n\r\nwere  due to officers reaching the compulsory  age\r\n\r\nof  retirement.  The balance were  retirements  on\r\n\r\noptional or medical grounds and two officers  were\r\n\r\nretired in the public interest.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards compulsory retirements referred to by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Choa  Chu  Kang,  retirement  is\r\n\r\ncompulsory on reaching the age limit - 55 years  in\r\n\r\nmost  cases;  60 years for those who  entered  the\r\n\r\nservice more recently. Of course, it does not mean\r\n\r\nthat  once an officer retires, he will be lost  to\r\n\r\nthe   service.

As stated by two hon. Members earlier, could\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry not have anticipated the  number  of\r\n\r\nofficers who would be retiring at the end  of  the\r\n\r\nyear?  This means that the Ministry is lacking  in\r\n\r\nefficiency  in not having been able  to  determine\r\n\r\nthe  number of officers who would be retiring. The\r\n\r\nMinister has said earlier that 80 per cent of such\r\n\r\nofficers  had to retire compulsorily.

It  is  something  like  bargaining  or\r\n\r\nhaggling  in the market. I open my price at,  say,\r\n\r\n$3  million.  You say, \"No, you can  get  only  $2\r\n\r\nmillion.\"  Then at the end of the year,  you  find\r\n\r\nthat $2 million is not enough and you have to come\r\n\r\nback   to  Parliament  to  get  the  extra   money\r\n\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That exactly is the position here, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,I  think it behoves the Ministries  and  the\r\n\r\nTreasury  to  come to a certain understanding,  so\r\n\r\nthat  there need not be any bargaining.

It is  indeed  sad\r\n\r\nfor  all  of us having to come here today to  vote\r\n\r\nfor  a  sum  of $660,000 to cover the  expenditure\r\n\r\nincurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the explanatory note, one would, in the\r\n\r\nfirst  instance, be happy to note that  there  was\r\n\r\nsuch  a thing as \"probable under-expenditure\" and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  a  deduction of $2 million  was  made.\r\n\r\nHere  again,  we  have  the  Ministry  of  Culture\r\n\r\nappointing persons to fill the vacancies and today\r\n\r\nwe are billed for $660,000. This is a very big sum\r\n\r\nof  money  and I am sure the Minister will  inform\r\n\r\nthe  House  of the number of vacant posts  filled,\r\n\r\ni.e.,  how  many officers have been recruited,  to\r\n\r\nmerit the $660,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, this is really a\r\n\r\ntechnical Treasury point, and so I am answering it\r\n\r\non  behalf of the Minister for Culture because  it\r\n\r\ndeals with methods of estimation and why the  Head\r\n\r\nhas  been under-estimated and who is to blame, and\r\n\r\nthat  sort  of  thing.  Of  course,  Members  must\r\n\r\nunderstand  that these estimates  were  passed  by\r\n\r\nhon.  Members  last year. They cannot,  therefore,\r\n\r\nentirely escape responsibility for it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the Member for Choa Chu Kang got\r\n\r\nit right when he said that this amount of money is\r\n\r\nlike  bargaining  between  the  Ministry  and  the\r\n\r\nTreasury.  This is about deductions on account  of\r\n\r\nprobable under-expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd,  of course, if hon. Members have studied  the\r\n\r\nEstimates for next year which are now before them,\r\n\r\nthey  will  find  that this  item  is  entered  in\r\n\r\nrespect of all estimates of expenditure. There are\r\n\r\nvarious  reasons for this. First, in the  case  of\r\n\r\npersonal  emoluments, where it is  the  custom  to\r\n\r\nenter  the  full  amount for the year  January  to\r\n\r\nDecember,  quite often where this relates  to  new\r\n\r\nposts  - when you have to fill new posts there  are\r\n\r\nvarious procedures to follow to ensure that  there\r\n\r\nis no fiddling and that the most qualified persons\r\n\r\nare  appointed  to  the public service  - this,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  means that you have to advertise  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers.   Before   you   advertise   in    the\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  the qualifications and the  terms  of\r\n\r\nthe  office  must  be  agreed between  the  Public\r\n\r\nService Commission, the Treasury and: the Ministry\r\n\r\nconcerned. This takes time, and as often  as  not,\r\n\r\nwhen  you  have the time, you find  that  in  many\r\n\r\ncases you cannot get the people with the requisite\r\n\r\nexperience and qualifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Culture Division of the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture, this has been the  practice\r\n\r\nall  along  since the establishment of television,\r\n\r\nwhen  they  had  to recruit many grades  of  staff\r\n\r\nwhich  were  never  found in  the  public  service\r\n\r\nbefore,  such as T.V, cameramen, newsreel editors,\r\n\r\nwriters,  directors -that kind of  personnel.  And\r\n\r\nfor  many years, it has been the experience of the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture to be unable to  fill  these\r\n\r\nposts  to  a very considerable extent.  So  it  is\r\n\r\nbased  on  past  experience that  the  sum  of  $2\r\n\r\nmillion  had  been  entered  as  \"probable  under-expenditure\". Fortunately for us, the Ministry has\r\n\r\nbeen  able to recruit more successfully this  year\r\n\r\nthan  in  previous years. Hence, the  estimate  of\r\n\r\n\"probable  under-expenditure\" proved to be  wrong.\r\n\r\nWe,  therefore,  have to give out the  money  that\r\n\r\nthey  need.

I\r\n\r\ncan  well remember that years back we used to send\r\n\r\nour  students  to  outward  bound  schools  in   a\r\n\r\nneighbouring   country.  With  the  objective   of\r\n\r\nbuilding  a  more robust and rugged society,  this\r\n\r\nestablishment of an Outward Bound School comes, in\r\n\r\nfact, at a very opportune time.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself had the opportunity to visit this\r\n\r\nOutward  Bound  School and to see for  myself  the\r\n\r\ncourses conducted by the authorities there. Seeing\r\n\r\nyoung   boys  and  girls  undergoing  such   tough\r\n\r\ntraining  to  meet  our  objective  is  indeed   a\r\n\r\nwonderful experience. Now that the Government  has\r\n\r\nrealised  that such outward bound training  is  an\r\n\r\neffective medium to mould our young people into  a\r\n\r\ngeneration  tough and disciplined in body  and  in\r\n\r\nmind,  I  would  like to know  from  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned  what  type of outward bound  activities\r\n\r\nwould mould a tough generation disciplined in body\r\n\r\nand  in mind. Further, when was this Outward Bound\r\n\r\nSchool  instituted  and on what  basis,  in  other\r\n\r\nwords,   the   type  of  lectures,  teachers   and\r\n\r\nmanagement?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Outward\r\n\r\nBound  School  offers courses  almost  similar  to\r\n\r\nthose  being  offered by the Outward Bound  School\r\n\r\nwhich  was started on an ad hoc basis sometime  in\r\n\r\n1960 with the help of instructors from the British\r\n\r\nArmy.

This  additional\r\n\r\nsum  will  enable  acquisition proceedings  to  be\r\n\r\nfinalised  in  a number of cases this  year.

Many acquisitions  have  been\r\n\r\ndelayed  because we preferred to wait for the  new\r\n\r\nAct to come into force before starting acquisition\r\n\r\nproceedings.  The  Court itself  has  had  several\r\n\r\nsittings this year and made certain awards  which,\r\n\r\nof course, had cost the Government a little money.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A break-down of the expenditure already incurred\r\n\r\nand  which is to be incurred under the Board  this\r\n\r\nyear is as follows:\r\n\r\n <pre>\r\n\r\n Amount expended:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n               (a) For general development           $2,284,354.49\r\n\r\n               (b) For other projects                $1,945,188.40\r\n\r\n                                                     -------------\r\n\r\n                   Total                             $4,229,542.89\r\n\r\n                                                     =============\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe  approximate amount required to complete  five\r\n\r\nacquisitions  is  $1,219,025.

To deal with the specific subhead\r\n\r\n102,  which  is \"Major Construction and Renovation\r\n\r\nto Government Buildings\", the additional funds are\r\n\r\nin  fact  required  to  meet expenditure  for  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance, renovation and redecoration  of  many\r\n\r\nGovernment buildings as part of an overall plan of\r\n\r\nexpansion   of  the  services  and  additions   of\r\n\r\nresponsibilities   of   various   Ministries   and\r\n\r\ndepartments.  Unfortunately, many of  these  items\r\n\r\ncould   not  have  been  foreseen  in  1966,   but\r\n\r\nnevertheless  had to be implemented  on  a  rather\r\n\r\nurgent  basis  in 1967. Examples of these  are  as\r\n\r\nfollows.  First,  certain funds  had  to  be  made\r\n\r\navailable  to  convert and renovate some  premises\r\n\r\nfor  the Public Health Transport Centre to  enable\r\n\r\nthe   emergency   cleansing  scheme   to   operate\r\n\r\nproperly.   This  should  meet  the  approval   of\r\n\r\nMembers.   Second,  many  of  our  public   office\r\n\r\nbuildings had to be given major reconstruction and\r\n\r\nrenovation and these include such big buildings as\r\n\r\nthe  City Hall, the Fullerton Building, the C.I.D.\r\n\r\nbuilding and a few others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several new offices were set up and major\r\n\r\nalterations and renovations had to be effected  to\r\n\r\nmake them suitable to serve the purposes intended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.

Instead,  the  half  a\r\n\r\nmillion   workers   and  businessmen   were   more\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  the  depreciation  of  the   old\r\n\r\nMalayan currency by 15 per cent. This was the main\r\n\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little or no attention was given to the effect of\r\n\r\nthe devaluation as a whole, on the future earnings\r\n\r\nof the Singapore workers. Sir, some have expressed\r\n\r\ngleefully, \"The British-made cars would be cheaper\r\n\r\nby  15 per cent.\" So may it be. But the fact  that\r\n\r\nno  one seemed to be worried about the effects  of\r\n\r\ndevaluation   on   the  broader  economic   front,\r\n\r\nincluding  its  effects  on  labour,  indicates  a\r\n\r\npossible  complacency on the part of the Singapore\r\n\r\nworkers.  This  may be understandable.  More  than\r\n\r\n1,200  motor-cycles  or  scooters  are  registered\r\n\r\nevery  month. This is a clear indication that  the\r\n\r\nworkers in the lower and middle income groups have\r\n\r\nbenefited  from  the economic expansion  over  the\r\n\r\nlast   five  years.  Can  this  rate  of  economic\r\n\r\nexpansion  be  maintained and can the  workers  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  a whole continue to increase  their\r\n\r\nearning capacity at the same rate? One may  wonder\r\n\r\nwhat the devalued Pound has to do with it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is an island-State with no natural\r\n\r\nresources,  and  the value of  the  new  Singapore\r\n\r\ndollar   in  terms  of  purchasing  power  depends\r\n\r\nentirely on how much Singapore-made goods  can  be\r\n\r\nexported,  and  how much foreign exchange  we  can\r\n\r\nearn  thereby.  There is a great possibility  that\r\n\r\nour  export may be affected adversely one  way  or\r\n\r\nthe  other. For example, Hong Kong, which devalued\r\n\r\nby  4.3 per cent - originally Hong Kong devalued by\r\n\r\n14  per  cent  - would  be in a better  competitive\r\n\r\nposition in the international markets in terms  of\r\n\r\nprice,  as  Hong Kong-made goods would be  cheaper\r\n\r\nthan Singapore-made goods\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof similar kind, as Singapore did not devalue. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  some of the pioneer companies  may\r\n\r\nuse this as an argument to deny any wage increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the Commonwealth countries have devalued\r\n\r\nequally  with  the  Pound.  Singapore,  therefore,\r\n\r\nwould  theoretically  be  at  a  disadvantage   in\r\n\r\npricing  by  15 per cent in competing  with  those\r\n\r\ncountries which have devalued 15 per cent. Can our\r\n\r\ngoods, therefore, remain as competitive as before?\r\n\r\nThis  may be possible if the two parties concerned\r\n\r\nin  the manufacture of export goods, employers and\r\n\r\nunions, preserve good sense and not take advantage\r\n\r\nof each other by using the devaluation issue as an\r\n\r\nexcuse.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labour in the manufacturing companies,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  pioneer  industries,  must   be\r\n\r\nprepared to exercise restraint for at least one or\r\n\r\ntwo  years on increase of wages. This should apply\r\n\r\nmore specifically to those pioneer companies where\r\n\r\nthe  unskilled workers are being paid at $3.50 and\r\n\r\nabove. Labour as a whole at all wage levels in the\r\n\r\nexport  manufacturing industries  should  seek  to\r\n\r\nincrease  their productivity by 15  per  cent,  in\r\n\r\nterms of greater efficiency, by cutting costs, for\r\n\r\nexample.  On the other hand, the pioneer companies\r\n\r\nmust  be prepared to recognise the greater efforts\r\n\r\nput in by labour and grant reasonable increases to\r\n\r\nthose who are in the $2 to $2.50 bracket up  to  a\r\n\r\nmaximum  of $3 to $3.50. The Government has  given\r\n\r\nadded    incentives   to   export    manufacturing\r\n\r\ncompanies.   Similarly   the   pioneer   companies\r\n\r\nthemselves  on  their  own volition  should  grant\r\n\r\nincentives  for  increased  productivity  to   the\r\n\r\nworkers.  Both  the management and  union  leaders\r\n\r\nmust  be  prepared to appreciate the  difficulties\r\n\r\nencountered  by  each other. The  workers  in  the\r\n\r\npioneer  companies  have a greater  responsibility\r\n\r\nthan   just  irrationally  increasing  their   pay\r\n\r\npackets.   By  1971,  at  least  10,000  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  would  be  seeking  employment  due   to\r\n\r\nretrenchment  in the British bases. Owing  to  the\r\n\r\ndevaluation  of  the Pound, Britain  may  possibly\r\n\r\naccelerate the withdrawal of the bases. To add  to\r\n\r\nthis, we have an unemployment figure of 52,000,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot counting the school-leavers seeking employment\r\n\r\nin the labour market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with restraint of wage increases for\r\n\r\nunskilled  labour  at the $3.50  mark  and  above,\r\n\r\naccompanied by an increase in productivity  of  15\r\n\r\nper  cent, the reputation of the Singapore workers\r\n\r\nwould  induce  overseas  investors  to  bring   in\r\n\r\ncapital  to  start new companies. The greater  the\r\n\r\ninvestment  from overseas, the more  manufacturing\r\n\r\ncompanies  set  up,  the  smaller  would  be   our\r\n\r\nunemployment problem. By reducing the unemployment\r\n\r\nfigure,  the workers can have more for  themselves\r\n\r\nin the long run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A practical solution must be found if we in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  to  overcome any possible  adverse\r\n\r\nfactors  that may arise as a result of devaluation\r\n\r\nwhich may restrict our effort to export more.  One\r\n\r\nway  is to set up a tripartite council, consisting\r\n\r\nof  management and labour representatives together\r\n\r\nwith the national productivity centre representing\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  to investigate  the  effects  of\r\n\r\ndevaluation  on our export industry  and  to  seek\r\n\r\nsolutions. A tripartite council was set up  a  few\r\n\r\nyears  ago.  This  council  represented  all\r\n\r\nemployers  and labour at the national  level.  The\r\n\r\ncouncil was inaugurated with a lot of fanfare, but\r\n\r\nwhere is this council today? No one hears about it\r\n\r\ntoday. It is completely dormant, sleeping. Let  us\r\n\r\nnot  make  the  same mistake again.  A  tripartite\r\n\r\ncouncil, as I have suggested earlier, with special\r\n\r\nfunctions must be initiated. The emphasis would be\r\n\r\non  increased  exports, higher  productivity  with\r\n\r\nquality and lower costs, and industrial peace with\r\n\r\njustice  which will be the responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil.  All  grievances  between  employer   and\r\n\r\nlabour could be investigated and solutions arrived\r\n\r\nat,  to  the  satisfaction of  all  concerned.  If\r\n\r\nconcrete  results are to be obtained and the  fate\r\n\r\nof  the first national tripartite council avoided,\r\n\r\nthe persons nominated to this council must include\r\n\r\npersons who are directly connected with the export\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the functions of this council I would\r\n\r\nenvisage to be:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To educate the workers and instil in them\r\n\r\nthe importance of increased productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To instil into employers the importance of\r\n\r\nrecognising  the efforts put in  by  workers\r\n\r\nfor  increased  production which  should  be\r\n\r\ncompensated reasonably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To investigate into complaints from\r\n\r\nemployers or unions on all matters affecting\r\n\r\nproduction,    quality    and     industrial\r\n\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since increased export is the overall aim\r\n\r\nand  is  of  vital importance to  Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole, I would suggest that the Government appoint\r\n\r\na  public  servant as secretary in the Council.  I\r\n\r\nwould  even  go  further  and  suggest  that  full\r\n\r\npublicity by posters, advertisements and talks  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  drive home to all concerned  about  the\r\n\r\nvital  role they are requested to play in boosting\r\n\r\nthe economy of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming that by the efforts of this Council\r\n\r\nproduction  is boosted, what should the Government\r\n\r\nor  the  employer  do about finding  the  overseas\r\n\r\nmarkets?

Sending trade missions overseas\r\n\r\nonce  in  every  six months is  not  good  enough.\r\n\r\nSingapore must have super-salesmen posted in every\r\n\r\ncapital  in  the  world. The employers  should  be\r\n\r\nwilling  to  bear  some of the expenses  of  these\r\n\r\ntrade  missions  which would be manned  by  people\r\n\r\nwith expert knowledge of the various industries.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, businessmen alone cannot be\r\n\r\nexpected to have governmental contact overseas.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Ministry of Finance is  obviously  the\r\n\r\ndepartment  which  should  initiate  and  lay  the\r\n\r\nfoundation  of  setting up various trade  missions\r\n\r\nthroughout  the world. Otherwise all efforts  made\r\n\r\nin Singapore to produce quality-made goods at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreduced cost and all the incentives offered to the\r\n\r\nexport industries would be in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest in all seriousness to the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  that the campaign to achieve  the  target\r\n\r\nshould  be tackled with the same vigour  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  tackling  the  problem  of  family\r\n\r\nplanning  (so  that we need not have  to  legalise\r\n\r\nabortion) and the \"eat more wheat\" campaign.  Sir,\r\n\r\nI  would  go further and recommend to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance to plough back the 4 per cent tax  on\r\n\r\nexport  earnings, or at least some portion of  it,\r\n\r\nto  the  setting  up  of trade missions  in  those\r\n\r\ncountries where Singapore-made goods have or  have\r\n\r\nnot   found  a  market,  or  in  countries   where\r\n\r\nbusinessmen   find  difficulty   in   establishing\r\n\r\ncontacts. I will be failing in my duty as a  trade\r\n\r\nunionist  if  I do not emphasise that the  workers\r\n\r\nalone cannot he expected to practise restraint  as\r\n\r\npart  of  their role to boost the economy  of  the\r\n\r\nState.  The Government and the employers too  must\r\n\r\nplay  their part. It is the co-ordination and  co-operation  on the part of every one of  the  three\r\n\r\nparties concerned that can herald a new and bright\r\n\r\nphase  to  our  industrial growth - to  borrow  the\r\n\r\nphrase  of  the  Finance Minister  in  his  Budget\r\n\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nSir, I fully understand the contents of the speech\r\n\r\nmade  by the Member for Bras Basah. He has touched\r\n\r\non  the  undesirable effects arising  out  of  the\r\n\r\ndevaluation of the British Pound. He has  proposed\r\n\r\nseveral  suggestions in his speech,  and  I  agree\r\n\r\nwith some of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first point is about those workers who are\r\n\r\ngetting  wages  of  between $2  and  $2.50  - their\r\n\r\nclaims  for  a wage increase should be  considered\r\n\r\nfavourably by employers by reason of the fact that\r\n\r\ndaily-paid  workers who are receiving  between  $2\r\n\r\nand  $2.50  per  day are finding it  difficult  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  their own livelihood and that  of  their\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe all know that they are poor families and out of\r\n\r\nthis  meagre sum of $2 and $2.50 per day they have\r\n\r\nto  make  ends meet. This is an almost  impossible\r\n\r\ntask.  We  also  know that low pay  may  have  bad\r\n\r\neffects. Firstly, because of poor income, the food\r\n\r\nmay  not  be  nourishing enough. As a result,  the\r\n\r\nhealth  of the workers will be adversely affected,\r\n\r\nand  it  will  in turn affect their  productivity.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  the workers themselves may have  family\r\n\r\nproblems,   and  this  will  affect  their   whole\r\n\r\nattitude  towards their work. And  this  too  will\r\n\r\naffect their productivity adversely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is that we should make use of the\r\n\r\ntripartite council to look after the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  country  as  a whole, labour and  capital  in\r\n\r\nparticular,   and  to  avoid  any  hindrances   or\r\n\r\nundesirable influences or results which  might  be\r\n\r\nat  a  disadvantage  to any of  these  three;  the\r\n\r\ncountry,  labour  and capital. So  the  tripartite\r\n\r\ncouncil  should  take up its responsibilities  and\r\n\r\nimplement  the tasks that are assigned  to  it  as\r\n\r\nsuggested by the Member for Bras Basah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to stress that our currency is\r\n\r\nvery  strong because we have a backing of 400  per\r\n\r\ncent  in  reserves, in  fact,  the  currency   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  trusted by many. Not  only  do  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore have confidence in  it,  but\r\n\r\nmany other countries also have full confidence  in\r\n\r\nit.   For  instance,  our  Deputy  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nrecently passed through Bangkok, and according  to\r\n\r\nhim, the people there are using our currency. From\r\n\r\nthis  we can see the strength and prestige of  our\r\n\r\ncurrency.  Sir, because our currency is backed  by\r\n\r\n400  per cent in reserves and also because we  are\r\n\r\nmaintaining  our currency at its face  value,  our\r\n\r\npeople can buy more goods than before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, from what my friend, the Member  for\r\n\r\nBras  Basah,  has said, I think we  should  pay  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  of  attention to  economic  measures.\r\n\r\nAlthough I do not wish to speak at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlength,  I wish to offer some suggestions  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. For production, raw materials are most\r\n\r\nessential.  These raw materials are imported  from\r\n\r\nabroad. Local businessmen sometimes buy these  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials  at  high prices, and  then  manufacture\r\n\r\nthem here in this country. Thus the prices of  our\r\n\r\nmanufactured products rise. There should  be  some\r\n\r\nmeasure  of control over imports of raw materials.\r\n\r\nTake  a  glass  factory,  for  example.  The   raw\r\n\r\nmaterial  is imported from abroad. The businessmen\r\n\r\nin  those foreign countries and the businessmen in\r\n\r\nour  country  get together, and the  raw  material\r\n\r\nprices  are pushed up. These prices naturally  are\r\n\r\nreflected  in  locally-manufactured  products, if\r\n\r\nthis  trend continues, in what way will we be able\r\n\r\nto  increase our exports to foreign countries?  We\r\n\r\nought  to look into these matters. If our  country\r\n\r\nis  to  gain strength, particularly because we  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  raw  materials, we  should  as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible  import  them from nearby  countries.  If\r\n\r\nthis  matter is rectified, perhaps we will be able\r\n\r\nto maintain competitive prices. I think Government\r\n\r\nshould  look into this matter - from what countries\r\n\r\nwe  should  import and at what prices.  These  are\r\n\r\nworth  investigating.  If  these  prices  can   be\r\n\r\ncontrolled  or  reduced,  then  both  our   export\r\n\r\nindustry  will thrive and our currency  will  gain\r\n\r\nstrength.  Therefore, I suggest that  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister should investigate these things and  take\r\n\r\nsuitable steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am afraid the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  has  got it all wrong. People  do  not\r\n\r\nimport  raw  materials at high cost. They  try  to\r\n\r\nimport   raw  materials  at  the  cheapest   cost,\r\n\r\notherwise  they  will  go  bankrupt  because  they\r\n\r\ncannot  sell  the finished products anywhere.  So,\r\n\r\nfar  from  Government  introducing  any  form   of\r\n\r\ncontrol  on  imports  of raw  materials,  I  think\r\n\r\nGovernment  is well advised to let the businessmen\r\n\r\ndo  their own buying. I am not quite sure  whether\r\n\r\nthe interpreter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndid  a  correct job of interpreting what the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember has said. I must confess I cannot make much\r\n\r\nsense out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang says that it is wrong to\r\n\r\npay workers $2 and $2.50 a day because they cannot\r\n\r\nmaintain  a family at that wage. He must  remember\r\n\r\nthat  these  rates are really rates  paid  not  to\r\n\r\nworkers  as their normal wages, but are  rates  of\r\n\r\npay  given  mostly  to girl workers  during  their\r\n\r\ninitial period of training. Of course, these girls\r\n\r\nare  unmarried, and this really means paying  them\r\n\r\nmoney  while they acquire skills which will enable\r\n\r\nthem  to earn more when they have completed  their\r\n\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the speech by the Member for Bras\r\n\r\nBasah.  I  think  this is a very well  thought-out\r\n\r\npiece.  Obviously the Member has spent  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ntime  and a lot of thought on it. He has made many\r\n\r\nvaluable suggestions which deserve to he seriously\r\n\r\nconsidered  not  only by Government  but  also  by\r\n\r\nunions and employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not like to comment in detail on the\r\n\r\nvarious  useful  suggestions he has  made,  except\r\n\r\nperhaps  to say that his speech, I think, deserves\r\n\r\nto  be  produced and printed in a special  booklet\r\n\r\nfor circulation to interested parties. I will give\r\n\r\nhim  a firm promise that I will look into the  two\r\n\r\nsuggestions he has made, i.e., to establish a new\r\n\r\ncouncil  which  will be concerned  with  educating\r\n\r\nworkers  on  the need to improve productivity  and\r\n\r\nthe  methods of so doing; and the need to  educate\r\n\r\nemployers on how greater productivity should  lead\r\n\r\nto greater pay; and also the possibility that this\r\n\r\nnew council can formulate some system whereby they\r\n\r\ncan investigate complaints, presumably either from\r\n\r\nworkers or employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member, of course, has long experience in\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  and I think what  he  says  on  the\r\n\r\nsubject  should be taken seriously,  as  also  his\r\n\r\nproposal  that we should set up trade missions  in\r\n\r\nour export markets, a subject which I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  dealt  with  in  my Budget  speech  at  some\r\n\r\nlength.  I think the hon. Member can rest  assured\r\n\r\nthat   the   coming   year  will   see   important\r\n\r\ndevelopments in this field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the rest, I only want to say that I am very\r\n\r\nglad that he has made the remarks that he did. And\r\n\r\nif this kind of spirit permeates through the whole\r\n\r\nof  the labour movement in Singapore, I have every\r\n\r\nconfidence that we can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsurmount the difficulties ahead and I do not  fear\r\n\r\nthat  we  will not be able to succeed in competing\r\n\r\nin our export markets with all corners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Fifteen minutes past Four o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Thursday, 14th December, 1967.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
