She has pointed out\r\n\r\nthat with the changing educational profile of our workforce, the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  have found it increasingly difficult  to  recruit\r\n\r\nunion members and to identify union leaders.  She would like  to\r\n\r\nfind  out how effective the Ministry's Guidelines on Determining\r\n\r\nthe Eligibility of an Employee in Joining a Rank-and-File union.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Guidelines were formulated in consultation with\r\n\r\nthe  trade unions and employers in 1992.  It was in response  to\r\n\r\nunions'  concern that the pool of employees eligible to  join  a\r\n\r\ntrade  union or remain as union members is declining.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nunions  felt  that  this  trend  would  not  only  affect  union\r\n\r\nmembership but also reduce the talent pool for union leaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to inform the House that the Guidelines\r\n\r\nhave been implemented smoothly.  It has enabled the Ministry  to\r\n\r\nexamine  the  duties and responsibilities of  middle  management\r\n\r\npersonnel and to determine whether there would be a conflict  of\r\n\r\ninterest  if  they were to be represented by  a  rank  and  file\r\n\r\nunion.  The smooth implementation of the Guidelines is reflected\r\n\r\nfrom  the  fact  that  the  number of disputes  involving  union\r\n\r\nrepresentation  of  middle  management  personnel  has  declined\r\n\r\nsignificantly over the years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1992, when the guidelines were first introduced,\r\n\r\nthe Ministry received a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntotal of 57 such cases.  The figure has dropped substantially to\r\n\r\n33  in  1993 and in the last four years, from 1994 to 1997,  the\r\n\r\nnumber of disputes has further reduced to an average of about 10\r\n\r\ncases a year.  Sir, this trend, together with the fact that  all\r\n\r\ndisputes   have  been  amicably  resolved,  clearly  shows   the\r\n\r\nGuidelines' effectiveness.  It also indicates a positive  change\r\n\r\nin  employers' mindset to allow more of their middle  management\r\n\r\nstaff to join rank and file unions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand the concern of the Member that with an\r\n\r\nincreasingly better educated workforce, more and more  employees\r\n\r\nwho  are  in  executive positions may not be able to join  trade\r\n\r\nunions  and  be represented in collective bargaining.   However,\r\n\r\nwith  the  introduction  of  the General  Branch  by  the  NTUC,\r\n\r\nemployees  in the executive and managerial positions  could  now\r\n\r\njoin the unions as General Branch members although they will not\r\n\r\nbe represented for collective bargaining purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mrs Yu-Foo has advised those in the executive and\r\n\r\nmanagerial  positions to seek the help of the Ministry  if  they\r\n\r\nhave  any grievances with their employers.  Sir, they can always\r\n\r\ndo  so.   And  our  conciliation  officers  have  the  necessary\r\n\r\nexperience and are committed to do their best to assist them  to\r\n\r\nwork out amicable solutions with their employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, Mr Cyrille Tan, Nominated MP, said that the\r\n\r\nconciliation  officers  must be capable  with  good  command  of\r\n\r\nlabour  laws  and industrial practices.  Sir, I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nassure him that our conciliation officers have been given proper\r\n\r\ntraining  and exposure and are well-grounded in labour laws  and\r\n\r\nindustrial relations practices.  This would ensure that they are\r\n\r\ncompetent  and  effective in helping the  disputing  parties  to\r\n\r\nresolve their differences amicably.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have also recently implemented an attachment scheme\r\n\r\nfor  our  conciliation officers to work in NTUC on a  short-term\r\n\r\nattachment  to  the NTUC Industrial Relations Department.   This\r\n\r\nwould provide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem   with   an  opportunity  to  develop  close  rapport   and\r\n\r\nunderstanding with the union leaders as well as to sharpen their\r\n\r\nability  to deal with industrial relations issues.  At the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  NTUC has also sent their officers on short attachment  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Labour's Industrial Relations Department.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis arrangement enhances the ability of both union and Ministry\r\n\r\nofficers to deal with industrial relations and personnel  issues\r\n\r\nmore effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the issue of union leadership, while the talent\r\n\r\npool may be reduced, as a result of a better educated workforce,\r\n\r\nthere  is  now greater opportunity for better educated rank  and\r\n\r\nfile  members  and officials to upgrade themselves by  attending\r\n\r\ncourses  at  the  Singapore Institute of Labour Studies  (SILS).\r\n\r\nSILS  was  set  up to develop and improve the quality  of  union\r\n\r\nleadership.   And over the years, many grassroots union  leaders\r\n\r\nhave  completed the Industrial Relations Diploma courses at SILS\r\n\r\nwhich  cover the study of economics, industrial relations, human\r\n\r\nresource principles and labour laws.  They are now equipped with\r\n\r\nthe  necessary  knowledge and are in a better position  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  labour-management  issues and  to  be  more  effective  in\r\n\r\nproviding  leadership.   Sir, the Government  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nsupport  SILS  in  its efforts to upgrade union  leadership  and\r\n\r\ncapability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in summary, I agree with the Member that unions add\r\n\r\nvalue  to  the human resource management process in  a  company.\r\n\r\nParticularly  in this uncertain and difficult time,  our  unions\r\n\r\ncan  play a crucial role to help employers and workers cope with\r\n\r\nbusiness downturn.  Hence, apart from cases where there will  be\r\n\r\nclear  conflict  of interest, there is no reason  why  employers\r\n\r\nshould deny or resist the employees' desire to join unions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a dynamic and progressive trade union movement, able\r\n\r\nto  galvanise workers in productive pursuit of skills  upgrading\r\n\r\nand  enhance competitiveness, is certainly a plus for  Singapore\r\n\r\nand employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nyesterday, Mr Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspoke  of  workers losing their rights as a result of amendments\r\n\r\nto  our  labour laws in 1968.

Workers who had jobs were paid poorly.  They were indeed\r\n\r\nat  the  mercy  of their employers.  This was the case  because,\r\n\r\nwith so many unemployed people, employers could pick and choose.\r\n\r\nWorkers and their families lived in squalid huts or over-crowded\r\n\r\ntenements.  Many workers' children had to leave school early  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  family  eke  out a living.   The  economy  was  going\r\n\r\nnowhere.  The future was bleak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam also forgot to inform this House that in\r\n\r\nthose  days, trade unions often took industrial actions  without\r\n\r\nsecuring a mandate from their members, the workers, and  without\r\n\r\ngiving due regard to the viability of the company or the welfare\r\n\r\nof  the  workers.  Trade unions also intervened in issues  which\r\n\r\nshould  rightly  be the management functions,  such  as  hiring,\r\n\r\npromotion,  transfer, dismissal and assignment of  duties.   The\r\n\r\nunion's intervention had resulted in endless disputes leading to\r\n\r\nconfrontation and strikes at the workplace.  They did so because\r\n\r\nmany  unions  had  a political agenda  and workers'  rights  and\r\n\r\ninterests and welfare were the least of their concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the labour laws, prior to 1968, had inherent\r\n\r\nweaknesses  that caused low productivity and inefficiency  which\r\n\r\nwere often subjected to abuse by workers and their unions.  This\r\n\r\nwas  the  era of highly adversarial and confrontational  labour-management  relations.  There were more than 40 strikes  a  year\r\n\r\nparalysing trade, commerce and, indeed, the lives of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nordinary  citizens.   In  1955 alone,  there  were  275  strikes\r\n\r\nresulting in the loss of almost 1 million man-days.  The  damage\r\n\r\ninflicted  on  the  economy  was devastating.   The  outcome  of\r\n\r\nconfrontational and adversarial labour-management relations  was\r\n\r\na  poor  investment  climate, economic stagnation,  unfavourable\r\n\r\nworking  conditions and terms, high unemployment and  the  bleak\r\n\r\nfuture for Singaporeans.  It was for this reason that the labour\r\n\r\nlaws  were amended in 1968 to provide a more rational basis  for\r\n\r\nindustrial  relations.  The distinction was  drawn  between  the\r\n\r\nfunctions  of  management  and trade unions  for  balancing  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  both parties.  Thus, under the new provisions  in\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Relations Act, matters like promotion, transfer,\r\n\r\nhiring,  right to retrench, dismissal and assignment  of  duties\r\n\r\nwere  excluded from collective bargaining between  trade  unions\r\n\r\nand  employers.  To prevent abuses by employers, the law enables\r\n\r\nworkers  and  trade unions to seek redress through  conciliation\r\n\r\nand adjudication including appeals against unfair dismissal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the Employment Act introduced in 1968, the basic\r\n\r\nterms  and  conditions of employment as well as  the  rights  of\r\n\r\nemployees  were rationalised.  I must, however, point  out  that\r\n\r\nwhile   employers  were  given  the  discretion  to  carry   out\r\n\r\nfundamental management functions without being subjected to  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of collective bargaining, the rights of unions to  take\r\n\r\nindustrial action were not removed.  These rights continue to be\r\n\r\nenshrined in the Trade Unions Act.  The only difference is  that\r\n\r\na  union  which intends to take strike action must first  obtain\r\n\r\nthe  consent and mandate of its members through a secret ballot.\r\n\r\nI would like to inform the House that the need to seek a mandate\r\n\r\nof members through secret ballot before an industrial action has\r\n\r\nalso  been  introduced in countries like the United Kingdom  and\r\n\r\nAustralia.  The requirement of the secret ballot is in line with\r\n\r\ndemocratic  principle that such an extreme action  must  reflect\r\n\r\nthe collective wishes of the members of the union.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam has advocated a return to confrontation\r\n\r\nand adversarial labour-management relations.  He fails to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnotice that many countries all over the world are trying hard to\r\n\r\npromote  industrial  harmony  so  that  they  could  provide   a\r\n\r\nfavourable  investment  climate  for  economic  growth  and  job\r\n\r\ncreation.   Would  Mr Jeyaretnam like to see  a  return  to  the\r\n\r\nindustrial strifes of the 50s that resulted in low productivity,\r\n\r\neconomic stagnation, poor working conditions, low wages and high\r\n\r\nunemployment?   When he called for the restoration  of  workers'\r\n\r\nand trade unions' rights in the 50s, does he realise that he  is\r\n\r\nin  fact  setting  the stage for abuses of  rights  and  labour-management confrontation and job losses?  On the other hand, the\r\n\r\nPAP Government's effort over the years resulted in close labour-management cooperation, discipline and higher productivity. This\r\n\r\nhas  helped  us to attract high quality investments  and  better\r\n\r\npaying jobs for Singaporeans.  Singapore has been enjoying  full\r\n\r\nemployment since the early 70s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam also commented that there was a need to\r\n\r\nset  up a tribunal with representatives from employers and trade\r\n\r\nunions.   I find that strange.  But then he has already admitted\r\n\r\nto  this House that he does not read NTUC News.  I know that  he\r\n\r\nis  not likely to read the Lianhe Zaobao.  I am not sure  if  he\r\n\r\nreads  the  Straits Times and many other publications issued  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government  and even from my Ministry from  time  to  time.\r\n\r\nGenerally, I find that he is quite ill informed on many  issues.\r\n\r\nIf he had been more widely read or taken the trouble to research\r\n\r\nhis  topics  that he wants to speak on, he would have discovered\r\n\r\nthat  such  a  tribunal already exists in our  system.   When  a\r\n\r\ndispute, involving a trade union on the one hand and an employer\r\n\r\non   the   other,   cannot  be  resolved  through  conciliation,\r\n\r\narbitration of the dispute would be heard by a tripartite panel,\r\n\r\ncomprising  representatives from the trade union  and  employers\r\n\r\nand  presided over by a neutral third party who is a High  Court\r\n\r\nJudge.   This  tripartite  panel is our  Industrial  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam says that he hardly heard of disputes being\r\n\r\ndealt with by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIAC,  and  then  implies that the mechanism is  not  functioning\r\n\r\nproperly  since he has not heard of disputes being  dealt  with.\r\n\r\nThe  main reason for the lack of disputes and the low number  of\r\n\r\ncases  having  to  be  referred to the  IAC  is  the  result  of\r\n\r\ncooperation  and  amicable resolution of  differences  at  every\r\n\r\nlevel.   Because of responsible union leadership and enlightened\r\n\r\nmanagement,  most  of  the disputes had  been  settled  amicably\r\n\r\nthrough  discussion, either at the company level or conciliation\r\n\r\nat the Ministry of Labour.  We should keep it this way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our ability to strike a fair and equitable balance\r\n\r\nbetween  the interest of employers and workers within our  legal\r\n\r\nframework has enabled Singapore to be consistently rated as  one\r\n\r\nof  the  most attractive places for investments, and  has  often\r\n\r\ntopped the world competitiveness ranking.  Our favourable  legal\r\n\r\nframework  has  also been a key factor in Singapore's  workforce\r\n\r\nbeing regularly rated by BERI as number one in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me take this opportunity to quickly explain to the\r\n\r\nHouse   the  dangers  of  over  protective  labour  laws.    The\r\n\r\nexperience  of  many  European countries  has  shown  that  over\r\n\r\nprotective labour legislation has caused labour market rigidity,\r\n\r\nleading  to  unsustainable cost of doing business.  They  impede\r\n\r\ncompanies'  efforts to restructure and upgrade their  operations\r\n\r\nto  meet  new  challenges.  As companies are unable  to  operate\r\n\r\nefficiently,  many of them had, over time, become uncompetitive.\r\n\r\nThe  end result is loss of jobs, economic stagnation and  higher\r\n\r\nunemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an OECD study on unemployment in May 1994 concluded\r\n\r\nthat  employment protection legislation, which  is  designed  to\r\n\r\ndiscourage  dismissal by raising the cost of releasing  workers,\r\n\r\nhas  made  employers more reluctant to hire new  workers.   Many\r\n\r\ncountries  in  Europe,  which  have  particularly  stringent  or\r\n\r\nrestrictive   labour  legislation,  generally  have   a   higher\r\n\r\nunemployment  rate and employers frequently resort to  temporary\r\n\r\ncontract  and  other  non-standard forms of employment  to  meet\r\n\r\ntheir needs for workers during times of market upturn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study made many recommendations. I will just quickly\r\n\r\nhighlight  three  for Members' interest.  (1)  Wage  and  labour\r\n\r\ncosts be made more flexible and that unnecessary restrictions be\r\n\r\nremoved.   (2)  Employment security provisions that inhibit  the\r\n\r\nexpansion of employment in the private sector be reformed.   (3)\r\n\r\nUnemployment  and  related benefit systems  be  restructured  to\r\n\r\nachieve society's fundamental equity goal, such that - and  this\r\n\r\nis  important - the infringement of the efficient functioning of\r\n\r\nlabour markets would be minimised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the OECD study and its recommendations clearly\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  that rigid and over protective labour  legislation\r\n\r\nwould  undermine the efficient functioning of the labour market,\r\n\r\nstifle entrepreneurship and retard job creation.  Hence, we must\r\n\r\nlearn from their experience and avoid making the same mistakes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the liberalisation of the world economy, global\r\n\r\ncompetition  has intensified.  We must therefore  guard  against\r\n\r\nthe  tendency to introduce protective and popular policies  that\r\n\r\nwill  in  fact  introduce rigidity into our  labour  market  and\r\n\r\nundermine   our  long-term  competitiveness.   Mr   Jeyaretnam's\r\n\r\nquestion  on  workers'  rights,  therefore,  sounds  hollow  and\r\n\r\nirrelevant.   If workers had their rights removed unfairly,  why\r\n\r\ndid  Mr  Jeyaretnam, as leader of the Workers'  Party,  wait  30\r\n\r\nyears  to  raise  this issue?  The Workers'  Party  should  have\r\n\r\ncampaigned  in  every general election for  the  restoration  of\r\n\r\nthese  so-called  rights.  Perhaps he knows  in  his  heart  the\r\n\r\ndanger  and  foolishness of taking a course of action  that  can\r\n\r\nonly lead to more disputes and upheaval.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, on the \"Gender\r\n\r\nIncome  Gap\",  the Department of Statistics in  Singapore  found\r\n\r\nthat  the  ratio of female to male income declined from  73%  in\r\n\r\n1990  to 59% in 1995; that the income of the male workforce grew\r\n\r\nat  a  faster  rate; that there were more males  in  the  higher\r\n\r\nincome  groups  and  that  there was a larger  increase  in  the\r\n\r\nproportion  of males with monthly incomes of $3,000  and  above.\r\n\r\nAll these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindicate  the  significant  widening  in  wage  gap  and  career\r\n\r\npotential to the disadvantage of women in general.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should this be so in Singapore? We are supposed to\r\n\r\nhave equal opportunities, regardless of gender, in education and\r\n\r\nin  career-seeking. And we have a system based  on  meritocracy.\r\n\r\nWhy  are the returns from investing in our female population not\r\n\r\nyielding  the  same  accretion?  Is there  a  shortfall  in  the\r\n\r\ncontribution of our women to the economy as a result of this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following are some areas that are worth looking into in\r\n\r\nthis context.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Human capital investment. Firms may anticipate a higher\r\n\r\nquit  rate  from women than men.  As such, they may be  cautious\r\n\r\nwhen  it  comes to investing in female employees for  fear  that\r\n\r\nthey  would not recover their investment.  As a result  of  such\r\n\r\nforfeited  career  opportunities, women not only  have  loss  of\r\n\r\nearnings  but  also loss in economic values within the  society.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  employers  may adopt a new mindset with  some  sort  of\r\n\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Double burden. There is a possibility that women may be\r\n\r\nmore  likely to shirk on the job than men.   This might  be  the\r\n\r\ncase  because child-care responsibilities are more a distraction\r\n\r\nfor  women  than  men.   Having children does  impose  workplace\r\n\r\nlimitations  on  women.  Perhaps we should look  deeper  at  our\r\n\r\nchild-caring  facilities,  namely, maids,  grandparents,  foster\r\n\r\nhomes and child-care centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Women's perception. Women are often subjected to\r\n\r\nsocialisation as less able to handle risk-taking  and  as  being\r\n\r\nless confident of their abilities.  This could  be a factor that\r\n\r\nplays a critical role in their expectations towards the salaries\r\n\r\nthey deserve and therefore their perceptions towards the careers\r\n\r\nthey  choose.  This factor may also result in the lesser demands\r\n\r\nby women when it comes to wage negotiations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Societal conditioning. The influence of societal\r\n\r\nconditioning  as the source of occupational crowding  towards  a\r\n\r\nnarrow  set  of  \"women's  occupations\"  is  worth  looking  at.\r\n\r\nWhether  these  \"women occupations\" are really worth  so  little\r\n\r\nthat they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nusually  command less lucrative rates on the whole ought  to  be\r\n\r\nstudied.   Are there stereotyping and bias amongst  the  policy-makers, teachers and counsellors that deter girls and women from\r\n\r\nadvancing  their  education and entering  the  traditional  male\r\n\r\ndomains?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Technological innovations. There is increasing stress\r\n\r\ntowards higher value-added activities.  New-age technology  that\r\n\r\npoints  towards  the  ascendancy of  electronics  and  computer-related industries may require people with strong background  in\r\n\r\nmathematics.    This  is  an  area which  is  traditionally  the\r\n\r\nstronghold of men.   Are Singaporean women more likely  to  shun\r\n\r\nthese \"high-tech\" occupations by choice or by preference?  Do we\r\n\r\nneed to change this mindset?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Reproductive role. To fulfil this role, women are\r\n\r\nrequired, at one time or another, to consider discontinuity  and\r\n\r\nsubsequent reintegration in their jobs.  Effectively,  they  are\r\n\r\nprevented  from full integration at their jobs.   The  resultant\r\n\r\neffect   is  that  they  renounce  their  ambitions  and  resign\r\n\r\nthemselves to those lesser employment prospects than what  their\r\n\r\nqualification would warrant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it should be a worthwhile exercise to study and\r\n\r\nascertain these elements within the Singapore context.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to suggest that the Ministry of Manpower do this and  help\r\n\r\nus  overcome  some of our shortcomings and enable the  Singapore\r\n\r\nwoman  realise  her  true and rightful place  in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, in this cut, I was\r\n\r\noriginally going to ask the Minister for Manpower to help reduce\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of  hiring  skilled foreign  workers,  basically  the\r\n\r\nforeign worker levy to $100.  I am glad to note that I was  pre-empted  and  the Minister has announced that this  is  going  to\r\n\r\nhappen very soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure this will go a long way in helping the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  and  service  sectors reduce  the  labour-related\r\n\r\ncost.   I  hope that this will apply to foreign workers  of  all\r\n\r\nnationalities and not restricted to certain nationalities only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, I would like to still ask the Minister to consider some\r\n\r\ntemporary  measures for all existing foreign workers,  including\r\n\r\nunskilled  workers.   This  request is  to  help  companies  get\r\n\r\nthrough the tough times expected in the next two years or so.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  suggest that the Minister consider  temporarily\r\n\r\nreducing the levy for all foreign workers to $100 for the next 1-2  years.  And with the understanding that it would be raised to\r\n\r\nthe original levels once things stabilise in our economy.  I  am\r\n\r\nsure this will help our businesses survive the tough time in the\r\n\r\nnext few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\naddress  the  problem  of run away foreign workers  and  foreign\r\n\r\nmaids.  I would like to suggest imposing a security bond on  all\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  and foreign maids, as one way  to  tackle  the\r\n\r\nproblem of run away foreign workers and missing maids.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, the Minister for Home Affairs announced\r\n\r\nthat  such  a security bond would be imposed on foreign  workers\r\n\r\nfrom two foreign countries.  I see no reason why this should not\r\n\r\napply to foreign workers and maids from other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, I would suggest that the foreign workers and\r\n\r\nforeign  maids  can be asked to contribute 20% of their  monthly\r\n\r\nincome  to  a  foreign  labour fund to be  administered  by  the\r\n\r\nManpower  Ministry.   This  is  to  make  all  foreign   workers\r\n\r\nthemselves  responsible  for  their  good  behaviour  while   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Upon completion of their contract in  Singapore  or\r\n\r\nupon  the  cancellation of their work permit, their contribution\r\n\r\nwill  then  be returned to them when they pack up and  go  home,\r\n\r\nperhaps with some interest earned, similar to the CPF fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign labour fund can be deemed as some kind of a\r\n\r\ngood  behaviour  bond.   By running away or  committing  serious\r\n\r\noffences,  foreign workers would put their foreign  labour  fund\r\n\r\nsavings  in  jeopardy.  This could deter many  from  misbehaving\r\n\r\nwhile in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, irregardless of whether an employer is at fault\r\n\r\nwhen a work permit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nholder  goes missing and cannot be traced, the security bond  of\r\n\r\nthe  employer  is  forfeited.  I would like to suggest  that  in\r\n\r\ncases  where it can be established that an employer  is  not  at\r\n\r\nfault,  then  the  security  bond  or  deposit  should  not   be\r\n\r\nforfeited.   Of  course, the burden of proof should  be  on  the\r\n\r\nemployer.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, still on the issue of\r\n\r\nforeign  maids.   The Ministry of Labour announced  in  November\r\n\r\nlast  year that the foreign domestic worker levy would go up  by\r\n\r\n$15  a  month  with effect from 1st April 1998, ie, next  month.\r\n\r\nThis  is  to  be followed by small annual revisions  thereafter.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the foreign domestic worker levy, according  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry,  is  to  regulate  demand  for  foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers,  and  to  discourage Singaporeans from becoming  overly\r\n\r\nreliant on them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a working couple trying to juggle between babies,\r\n\r\nhousework,  career and upgrading their skills  and  studies  are\r\n\r\nalready  finding  their lives very stressful.   Thus,  it  would\r\n\r\nappear to me that even if the Government continues to raise  the\r\n\r\nforeign  domestic  worker levy, the demand  will  remain  fairly\r\n\r\ninelastic.  For those in this category having a maid  is  really\r\n\r\nnot an option.  The concern over the levy increase lies not only\r\n\r\nin  the higher costs to households, especially for young working\r\n\r\ncouples,  but more importantly, the availability of alternatives\r\n\r\nsuch as childcare centres.  There are also those who are in need\r\n\r\nof  a maid to look after their beloved elderly while they are at\r\n\r\nwork.  Having a maid for this group is a necessity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must not be seen to be sending confusing\r\n\r\nsignals.   If  Singapore  wants its women  to  come  forward  to\r\n\r\ncontribute economically, then there must be assurance that their\r\n\r\nchildren  are  not deprived of proper and dedicated  care.   The\r\n\r\nquestion then is how the Ministry could ensure that the measures\r\n\r\ntaken  to  increase the maid levy really meet its  objective  in\r\n\r\nterms of controlling the numbers while at the same time ensuring\r\n\r\nthat  those  really in need of a maid service are not  deprived.\r\n\r\nIn the wake of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncurrent   economic   downturn,  will  the  Minister   reconsider\r\n\r\ndeferring the increase of the foreign domestic worker levy until\r\n\r\nthe situation improves, as it may adversely impact those who are\r\n\r\naffected  by  the current economic conditions, but at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime  are  still  dependent on the services of foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nmaids.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have to remind Members that the\r\n\r\n\"guillotine\" time is at 1.55 pm and we seem to have still  quite\r\n\r\na long list of speakers.

However, I have no pecuniary  interest  in\r\n\r\nthe subject matter that I will be speaking on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, more than 90% of the workers in the\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry  are foreign  workers.   At  present,  an\r\n\r\nemployer  has  to pay foreign worker levy to the  Government  at\r\n\r\n$200 for each skilled worker and $440 for each unskilled worker.\r\n\r\nThe  difference of $240 is to encourage the employers to  engage\r\n\r\nmore  skilled  workers in order to improve productivity  in  the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry. This policy is correct and encouraging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction industry is a very competitive industry.\r\n\r\nSince  the  Government's announcement of the adjustment  to  the\r\n\r\nforeign  worker levy at the end of last year, many  construction\r\n\r\ncompanies  have  been  trying very hard to secure  more  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers to replace the unskilled workers, in order to cut cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, the Singapore Government's\r\n\r\nConstruction  Industry  Training School has  been  flooded  with\r\n\r\napplications from many construction companies for their  workers\r\n\r\nto   be   trained  and  to  sit  for  the  skills  certification\r\n\r\nexamination.  The response was so overwhelming that  the  school\r\n\r\nis  finding  it difficult to cope.  Obviously, this strategy  to\r\n\r\nactively encourage the workers to increase their skill level  is\r\n\r\nlike  \"sending burning charcoal in a snowing weather\".  It is  a\r\n\r\ntimely help to the industry, and is significantly effective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the original purpose of the foreign workers\r\n\r\nlevy is to increase the cost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof employing foreign workers so as to prevent the employers from\r\n\r\nemploying  cheap foreign workers to replace the  more  expensive\r\n\r\nlocal  workers.  However, after years of implementation of  this\r\n\r\npolicy,  and the levy being raised year after year,  the  number\r\n\r\nof  local  workers  entering the construction industry  has  not\r\n\r\nincreased, but has actually reduced.  Even the supervisory-level\r\n\r\nwork,  which  was  formerly dominated by  Singaporeans,  is  now\r\n\r\ngradually   taken  over  by  engineers  employed  from   foreign\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently, construction work has not much attraction for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.    Unless  the Government thoroughly  changes  its\r\n\r\npolicy,   like  last  year's  large-scale  incentives  for   the\r\n\r\nemployers  to  employ skilled workers, it will not  be  easy  to\r\n\r\nchange  the local workers' present attitude of fighting  shy  of\r\n\r\nthe  construction  industry.  At the same  time,  the  levy  for\r\n\r\nunskilled  workers will be raised to $470 with effect  from  1st\r\n\r\nApril.  Other than increasing the construction cost, it will not\r\n\r\nhave much encouraging effect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that when the Government was formulating this\r\n\r\npolicy it was considering the need to attain budget neutrality.\r\n\r\nHowever, from 1st April onwards,  when the new rates take\r\n\r\neffect, so long as the number of skilled workers is lower than\r\n\r\n15% of the total number of construction workers, the\r\n\r\nGovernment's income in foreign worker levy will be increased,\r\n\r\nand not neutral.  According to the statistics of the\r\n\r\nConstruction Industry Development Board  (CIDB), at the moment,\r\n\r\nskilled foreign workers who are paying the foreign worker levy\r\n\r\naccount for approximately 10% of the total number of foreign\r\n\r\nconstruction workers in Singapore.  Since the new policy on\r\n\r\nforeign worker levy was announced at the end of last year, and\r\n\r\nalthough the Singapore Construction Industry Training School has\r\n\r\nincreased the number of its  courses, it will be impossible to\r\n\r\nrapidly raise the percentage within a short period of time.  In\r\n\r\nany event,  so long as the Government's income is increased,\r\n\r\nthen the wool must still come from the back of the sheep - the\r\n\r\ncost in the property sector will surely go up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this present economic turmoil where business is bad, all\r\n\r\nthe  trades and industries are asking for reduction in taxes and\r\n\r\nrents,  and  the construction industry is also hoping  for  some\r\n\r\nconcessions.   All  these  years,   the  Government   has   been\r\n\r\ncollecting   more  than  $100 million a year  from  the  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  levy.  However, there are more and more foreign workers\r\n\r\ncoming to Singapore.  This merely indicates an  increase in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's revenue from the foreign worker levy, and  not  the\r\n\r\nbest  plan to improve productivity.   I hope that the Government\r\n\r\nwould  respond  to  the public's request  not  to  increase  the\r\n\r\nforeign worker levy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years, the Government and the\r\n\r\nconstruction  companies are actively advocating the  concept  of\r\n\r\n\"builderbility\".  In the past two to three years,  this  concept\r\n\r\nhas  been  extensively affirmed.  The concept of \"builderbility\"\r\n\r\nis  mainly to encourage the top-level people in the construction\r\n\r\nindustry,  such  as   the  developers  and  the  architects,  to\r\n\r\nactively consider, during the project design concept stage,  the\r\n\r\nvarious problems of \"builderbility\" at the construction stage in\r\n\r\norder  that  the contractors may effectively make  use  of  more\r\n\r\nmachines and less workers to complete the project.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government speeds up the legislation process to\r\n\r\npromote this concept of \"builderbility\", coupled with the slight\r\n\r\nrevision to the foreign workers levy,  I believe productivity in\r\n\r\nthe  construction industry can be significantly improved in  the\r\n\r\nnear future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my second topic is on foreign domestic maids. At the\r\n\r\npresent   moment,  the  Government's  policy  is  to   encourage\r\n\r\nhousewives to rejoin the workforce.  The Ministry of Labour  has\r\n\r\nspecially formulated a \"back-to-work\" scheme, with the hope that\r\n\r\nmore housewives would receive some training on the latest skills\r\n\r\nand  some  psychological  preparation  before  they  rejoin  the\r\n\r\nworkforce.   I  fully  agree with this  policy.   However,  with\r\n\r\neffect from 1st  April, the levy on foreign domestic maids  will\r\n\r\nbe increased once again.  Does this not run contradictory to the\r\n\r\nabove policy?  At the moment, with the economic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nslowdown,  wages are not increased but the expenses will  surely\r\n\r\ngo  up  with the upward adjustment of loan interests and charges\r\n\r\nfrom  the various departments.  For example, instalment payments\r\n\r\nfor  housing and vehicle loans, and utilities charges have  gone\r\n\r\nup.  Although the additional $15 on the foreign maid levy can be\r\n\r\noffset  by  cutting down on sundry consumption  expenses,   this\r\n\r\nwill affect the entire retail industry, causing the market to be\r\n\r\neven more depressed.  Moreover, the Government has announced the\r\n\r\nextension of retirement age, and now it is going to increase the\r\n\r\nforeign  maid  levy.    The Government intends  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nquality   of  childcare  centres.    This  will  not   only   be\r\n\r\nineffective,  but  may even end up with a blunder,  causing  the\r\n\r\npsychological burden of the people to be heavier  at  this  time\r\n\r\nwhen everyone is on tenterhooks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister can be circumspect and farsighted,\r\n\r\nand  not to further  increase the unskilled foreign workers levy\r\n\r\nand the foreign maid levy after 1st April.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I\r\n\r\nalso wish to talk about the run away of foreign maids.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, some voters came to me to seek assistance in\r\n\r\nappealing  against the forfeiture of  security bonds  for  their\r\n\r\nforeign maids or workers who had run away.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A family employed a foreign maid to help look after their\r\n\r\naged parents and parents-in-law at home.  When the couple came\r\n\r\nhome from work, they found that their maid was missing.  They\r\n\r\ncould not get help from anywhere. Even the police would not help\r\n\r\nthem because the police do not deal with such matters unless the\r\n\r\nabsconded maid has overstayed in Singapore.  Even if the\r\n\r\nemployer knows the whereabouts of the maid, there is no\r\n\r\norganisation  he can turn to to get the maid home. With the maid\r\n\r\nrunning away, the employer has to apply for no-pay leave to look\r\n\r\nafter his aged parents and parent-in-law.  The moment the\r\n\r\nImmigration Department comes to know about it, the employer will\r\n\r\nbe asked to surrender the maid to the authority for\r\n\r\nrepatriation,  failing which the security bond of $5,000 will be\r\n\r\nforfeited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the newly formed Ministry of Manpower will render\r\n\r\nsome  assistance to these employers.  Give them a  grace  period\r\n\r\nbefore  forfeiting their security bond of $5,000,  unless  there\r\n\r\nare compelling reasons why the grace period cannot be granted.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, there\r\n\r\nis  a  Chinese fable which runs like this.  There was a mountain\r\n\r\nin  front  of the house where an old man was living.  It  caused\r\n\r\nthe  old man a lot of inconvenience because every time he wanted\r\n\r\nto  go  to town, he had to go round the mountain.  One  day,  he\r\n\r\ndecided  that  this mountain had to be removed.  His  neighbours\r\n\r\nasked  him, \"Is it possible? The mountain is so high.\"  The  old\r\n\r\nman  replied, \"Yes.  Although the mountain is high, it does  not\r\n\r\ngrow  any  higher. So long as  my children, their  children  and\r\n\r\ntheir  children's  children persevere,  this  mountain  will  be\r\n\r\nremoved  one day\".  The moral of this story is, \"if there  is  a\r\n\r\nwill, there is a way.\"    This old man may not be clever, but he\r\n\r\nis certainly not stupid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you may ask, \"What has this got to do with our topic\r\n\r\ntoday?\"    Well, the unemployment problem is just the  mountain.\r\n\r\nIf  we  want  to achieve full employment, we have to remove  the\r\n\r\nobstacle, this mountain.  The  difference is: once the  mountain\r\n\r\nis removed, it will not come back, but unemployment will.   Full\r\n\r\nemployment is difficult to achieve.  To sustain it is even  more\r\n\r\ndifficult.   As economic reform gathers momentum,  job  creation\r\n\r\nalone cannot guarantee that the state of full employment will be\r\n\r\nsustained.   In  this  regard, MTI  alone  cannot  shoulder  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  all by itself.  It will have to work  in  tandem\r\n\r\nwith the new Ministry of Manpower to upgrade the skill level  of\r\n\r\nthe  workforce.   Challenges are plenty.  We  have  to  get  our\r\n\r\npriorities right.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have three recommendations for the consideration of the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Manpower.  Firstly, enhance the workers'\r\n\r\nemployability; secondly, remove all prejudices against the older\r\n\r\nworkers; and thirdly, enhance the competitiveness of the\r\n\r\nprofessionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>First  Priority:  Three groups of workers need  to  enhance\r\n\r\ntheir employability</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the industrial and commercial restructuring, the\r\n\r\nbasic  skill  requirements of the workers  are  gradually  being\r\n\r\nraised.  Workers with a primary educational level and below  are\r\n\r\nalready  facing  the threat of being eliminated.   In  the  next\r\n\r\nthree  to five years' time, if they do not upgrade the level  of\r\n\r\ntheir  skills, they will be structurally unemployable.  This  is\r\n\r\nthe first group of workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second group of workers are those with Secondary 4\r\n\r\neducation,  who  are  either  unskilled  or  semi-skilled.    As\r\n\r\ncompanies   are  accelerating  their  process  of  restructuring\r\n\r\nbecause  of  competition, there will be more  opportunities  for\r\n\r\npromotion. If the workers do not upgrade their skills, they will\r\n\r\nmiss  these promotion opportunities.  On the other hand, certain\r\n\r\nindustries will be short of skilled workers and  have to be over-dependent  on  foreign workers, resulting in  structural  under-employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our low value-added industry has contracted and thousands\r\n\r\nof  workers in this industry are being laid off.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  the high value-added industry is booming, but it is faced\r\n\r\nwith a shortage of workers.  If we fail to enable our workers to\r\n\r\nupgrade  their skills and to move them from the low  value-added\r\n\r\nindustry  to  the high value-added industry, then they  will  be\r\n\r\nfaced  with the situation of structural  unemployment.  This  is\r\n\r\nthe third group of workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these three situations become a reality, it would imply\r\n\r\nthat we have not fully utilised the potential of our workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The tripartite cooperation among labour, management\r\n\r\nand  the  Government should try their best  to  avoid  paying  a\r\n\r\nhigher price in these situations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Second Priority: Remove all prejudices against the older workers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aging of our population is an unavoidable fact. The\r\n\r\nnumber of our workers who are above the age of  40 has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow  exceeded 750,000.  A fortnight ago, within one  week  there\r\n\r\nwere  330 recruitment advertisements and half of them stipulated\r\n\r\nthat  the  maximum age for eligible candidates was 35, and  one-third of them wanted only people who were not more than 40 years\r\n\r\nof  age.  In other words, 85% of the companies would accept only\r\n\r\napplicants  who were below 40 years old.  If we do  not  correct\r\n\r\nsuch  prejudice against the older workers, a vicious cycle  will\r\n\r\nemerge and it can  become a serious social problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Third Priority: Enhancing the competitiveness of our professionals</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value chain of our economic activities can be divided\r\n\r\ninto   upper,  upper-middle,  lower-middle  and  lower  streams.\r\n\r\n\"Upper  stream\"  refers  to R&D; \"lower  stream\"  covers  market\r\n\r\ndevelopment; \"upper-middle\" calls for creativity and innovation;\r\n\r\nwhile \"lower-middle\" refers to mass production.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While pursuing the upper stream activities, such as R&D, we\r\n\r\nmust   always   emphasise  the  importance  of  creativity   and\r\n\r\ninnovation and market development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With comprehensive professional capabilities and equal\r\n\r\nemphasis on the abovementioned four streams, we will be able  to\r\n\r\nbuild  up  a  world-class workforce and turn  ourselves  into  a\r\n\r\nglobal   hub   for  Asia.   Although  we  have  sound   economic\r\n\r\nfundamentals, we have to continue to excel and strive ahead.  If\r\n\r\nMTI   and  MOM  could  work  closely  together  to  create  more\r\n\r\nopportunities for good jobs, while at the same time upgrade  our\r\n\r\nworkers' skills and the competitiveness of the professionals, we\r\n\r\nwill be able to ride out such economic storm and better position\r\n\r\nourselves for the next century in Asia as well as the world.  We\r\n\r\nbelieve  we will be able to find an economic niche for ourselves\r\n\r\nin the next century.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, according to the\r\n\r\nlatest Labour Force Survey, there are about 53,000 married women\r\n\r\nwho  have  indicated that they want to go  back  to  work.   The\r\n\r\nmajority have young children.  This is the major reason why they\r\n\r\ncould  not take up normal, full-time jobs.  Unlike the situation\r\n\r\nin most\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeveloped countries, our women do not re-enter the workforce  in\r\n\r\ntheir  later  years, after their child-rearing years  are  over.\r\n\r\nThe participation rate for women aged 40 to 50 years is only 52%\r\n\r\ncompared  to  71%  in Japan, 76% in US, and 70%  in  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom.   For  those  aged 50 years and  above,  only  41%  are\r\n\r\neconomically active in Singapore compared to 66% in  Japan,  57%\r\n\r\nin the US and 52% in the UK.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a huge pool to tap from, it is a great pity that\r\n\r\nwe are still relying heavily on foreign workers.  And now we are\r\n\r\ntalking about attracting more foreign talents.  It is time  that\r\n\r\nwe  took stock of our own existing resources and see how best we\r\n\r\ncould  develop them.  We must try to do much more  not  only  to\r\n\r\nattract  such  women into the workforce but also try  to  retain\r\n\r\nthose who are already in the workforce.  If we look at countries\r\n\r\nwith  high female labour force participation rates, we will also\r\n\r\nfind that there are many flexible work arrangements that are  in\r\n\r\nplace  to help women balance work and family.  I think  they  do\r\n\r\nnot want to depend on foreign maids.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key element of these work arrangements is flexibility.\r\n\r\nThis  comes  in the form of flexible working time,  job-sharing,\r\n\r\npart-time  work or home-based work, or work located  near  their\r\n\r\nhomes.  With the vast improvements in telecommunications,  there\r\n\r\nis  no  need even for women to leave their homes.  With a little\r\n\r\nplanning,  many  jobs  can  be  converted  to  home-based  work.\r\n\r\nJournalism  is one example, as the primary tools of a journalist\r\n\r\nare a laptop and a telephone which do not require them to be  in\r\n\r\nthe office all the time.  Vast opportunities can be created,  if\r\n\r\nonly  employers are prepared to be flexible and  spend  time  to\r\n\r\nredesign  their  jobs.   Singapore Post is  one  example  of  an\r\n\r\nemployer  who  did  a  marvellous job in bringing  work  to  the\r\n\r\ndoorsteps  of women.  Instead of depending on male postmen,  now\r\n\r\nthey have housewives to distribute letters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from flexible work arrangements, we find that where\r\n\r\nthere   are   adequate  community  facilities   and   pro-family\r\n\r\nincentives,  in the form of tax incentives or child care  leave,\r\n\r\nthe  labour force participation rate increases.  In Sweden,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neither  parent  could take up to 15 months of child  care  leave\r\n\r\nwith  full pay for the first three months and 75% of the  salary\r\n\r\nfor  the  remaining period.  Whilst I am not suggesting that  we\r\n\r\nfollow  the  Swedish  example,  it nevertheless  highlights  the\r\n\r\nimportance  attached  to child caring and the  reason  why  many\r\n\r\nSwedish  women could go back to work after their leave is  over.\r\n\r\nWe  could  perhaps adopt more modest measures.  Employers  could\r\n\r\nconsider  allowing women to take unpaid leave, after their  paid\r\n\r\nmaternity  leave  is  over, for another six months.   Presently,\r\n\r\nthis scheme is found only in the public sector which gives up to\r\n\r\none  year's  leave, but is almost non-existent  in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.  Employers who provide pro-family benefits could even be\r\n\r\ngiven  tax  incentives  and subsidised assistance  from  PSB  to\r\n\r\nredesign jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many women also need training, both in raising their skill\r\n\r\nlevel  and  developing  their self-confidence  to  re-enter  the\r\n\r\nworkforce.    With  the  new  Ministry  of  Manpower,   a   more\r\n\r\ncoordinated  strategy for the development, training and  funding\r\n\r\nof  such programmes would hopefully be in place.  At the end  of\r\n\r\nthe  day,  what  we  hope  to achieve  is  to  help  women  lead\r\n\r\nmeaningful lives and contribute to society by allowing  them  to\r\n\r\nbalance family and work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I continue with my amendment on CPF?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mrs Yu-Foo, I think the Minister would like\r\n\r\nto reply now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, allow me to, first, reply to the\r\n\r\npoints raised by the Member for Kreta Ayer-Tanglin, Dr Lily Neo.\r\n\r\nShe has observed that according to the Department of Statistics'\r\n\r\ndata, the income ratio between male and female declined from 73%\r\n\r\nin  1990  to  59% in 1995.

The\r\n\r\nstatistics,  therefore,  has  been  somewhat  distorted  by  the\r\n\r\nincreasing number of lowly-paid female foreign domestic  workers\r\n\r\nover the years.  To better reflect the trend, we should look  at\r\n\r\nthe  wage  data  of  our  resident workforce.   These  data  are\r\n\r\ncaptured in the occupational wages survey, CPF Board\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nearnings data and Labour Force Survey data.  These data are  for\r\n\r\nresident workforce and they have, in fact, shown a narrowing  of\r\n\r\nthe  overall  wage  gap between resident males  and  females  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  over the years.  For instance, based on CPF  records,\r\n\r\nthe average monthly earning of resident females rose from 68% in\r\n\r\n1987  to  76% in 1997.  So, in fact, the gap is actually getting\r\n\r\nnarrower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factors which could account for the wage gap include the\r\n\r\ndifferences  in job nature and job level, as well  as  years  of\r\n\r\nservice,  working experience and educational attainment  of  the\r\n\r\njobholders.   Statistics  from the latest  Labour  Force  Survey\r\n\r\nshowed  that female labour force participation peaked  at  82.4%\r\n\r\nfor the 25 to 29 age group, and thereafter declined, as was also\r\n\r\nobserved  yesterday by Mdm Claire Chiang.  These data, in  fact,\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  women  tend to drop out of  the  workforce  after\r\n\r\nmarriage  to  take  care  of the family  responsibility.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  the  average years of service and experience  of  women\r\n\r\nremaining in the workforce will naturally be shorter compared to\r\n\r\ntheir male counterparts, consequently their wage levels will  be\r\n\r\nlowered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, discrimination in employment exists only when persons\r\n\r\nof  equal capability doing the same jobs are paid differently by\r\n\r\nthe  same  employer  on factors unrelated to their  performance.\r\n\r\nHence,   we   must  understand  the  basis  for   the   national\r\n\r\noccupational wage data and not conclude that there is  indeed  a\r\n\r\ndiscrimination on basis of gender or that women, in general, are\r\n\r\nbeing disadvantaged.  This is because the occupational wage data\r\n\r\nare  based on the aggregate of similar jobs, regardless  of  the\r\n\r\nlevel  of  authority,  job complexity,  responsibility  or  work\r\n\r\nexperience.  In Singapore, women who do the same job as men  are\r\n\r\npaid  the same wages as men.  This is clearly reflected  in  the\r\n\r\npractice  of  the public sector when men and women in  the  same\r\n\r\nposition,  with  the  same years of service,  receive  the  same\r\n\r\nremuneration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kreta Ayer-Tanglin has also raised many\r\n\r\nother  issues  relating to the difficulties  of  the  challenges\r\n\r\nfacing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwomen in employment, including the difficulty of balancing  work\r\n\r\nwith  family  responsibility and also  the  general  mindset  of\r\n\r\nemployers  with  regard to the role of women in  the  workplace.\r\n\r\nThese  are  relevant  issues.  These will  have  to  be  studied\r\n\r\nfurther.   Yesterday  I mentioned that my Ministry  had  already\r\n\r\nappointed  an Advisory Committee to our Back-to-Work  programme,\r\n\r\nand this Committee would, in fact, look at some of these issues.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  will  certainly  convey the  Member's  concerns  to  the\r\n\r\nCommittee so that they could be considered in totality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a tight labour market, as what we have been\r\n\r\nexperiencing all these years, employers have to be innovative in\r\n\r\norder to recruit the workers that they need, and they should not\r\n\r\nomit the potential of recruiting more women workers to join  the\r\n\r\nworkforce.    I  think  we  can  satisfy  some  of  our   labour\r\n\r\nrequirements if we make a special effort to recruit more of  the\r\n\r\nwomen  who  are  presently not working to rejoin the  workforce.\r\n\r\nAnd, in fact, this is the main thrust and target of our Back-to-Work  programme.   The  Ministry of Manpower  will  continue  to\r\n\r\ndevelop this programme to enlarge its outreach, so that it  will\r\n\r\nbe more effective in getting the women back into the workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I next turn to the Members who spoke on foreign\r\n\r\nworkers,  in  particular  the foreign worker  levy.   First,  Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit  Singh has asked whether the lower levy  which  we  are\r\n\r\ngranting to skilled workers, with effect from 1st April, will be\r\n\r\nextended  to  workers from all sources.  Yes, I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nassure  Mr  Singh that, in fact, the lower levy  which  will  be\r\n\r\npegged at $100 per month will be extended to foreign workers  in\r\n\r\nall sectors and from all sources, including skilled workers from\r\n\r\nthe non-traditional sources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to address the point raised by Mr Magad\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Chuang  on reducing the foreign worker levy.   Firstly,\r\n\r\nboth  Mr  Magad and Mr Chuang have suggested to defer  the  levy\r\n\r\nincrease for foreign domestic workers.  This was the increase of\r\n\r\n$15  which  we  announced in November last year.  It  will  take\r\n\r\neffect  on  1st  April.   Sir, I want  to  point  out  that  the\r\n\r\nadjustment is on account of changes in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincome  levels  of  Singaporean employers  of  foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers,  and  also because of the increase in foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers, since the last levy revision in 1995. The levy increase\r\n\r\nis  necessary  to  ensure that the cost of employing  a  foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic   worker  keeps  pace  with  the  rise  in  income   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Otherwise, the number will continue  to  increase\r\n\r\nand it will reach unmanageable proportions.  As it stands, there\r\n\r\nare  already  more  than  100,000 foreign  domestic  workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   If  we  do  not implement any measure  to  moderate\r\n\r\ndemand, the number could increase much drastically.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, real income level, as measured by the average monthly\r\n\r\nincome  for Singaporeans, rose by 9% cumulatively for  1995  and\r\n\r\n1996.   And  if  you  compare this to the proposed  increase  in\r\n\r\nforeign domestic levy which is only 4\ufffd% increase, this seems  to\r\n\r\nbe  totally reasonable.  In fact, it means even if income growth\r\n\r\nwere to be slower this year because of the slow economic growth,\r\n\r\nthe foreign domestic workers have already become relatively more\r\n\r\naffordable compared to 1995 when the levy was last revised.   If\r\n\r\nwe  defer the levy increase this year, it will hamper efforts to\r\n\r\ncontrol or to moderate the rising demand.  As the  intention  is\r\n\r\nto  increase the levy to keep pace with rising income, we should\r\n\r\nmake  this  adjustment regularly so that it is a small increase,\r\n\r\nsmall  steps,  along the way, rather than defer  it  for  a  few\r\n\r\nyears.   Then a few years down the road, we would have to  bring\r\n\r\nin  a  very  hefty  increase  which  would  lead  to  even  more\r\n\r\nunhappiness and greater difficulties for the families to adjust.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Mr Chuang's call to defer the increase in levy for\r\n\r\nthe  unskilled  foreign construction workers, I  would  like  to\r\n\r\npoint out to the Member that, despite the economic slowdown  and\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry's announcement of the impending levy increase, the\r\n\r\ndemand  for  work  permit  applications  for  unskilled  foreign\r\n\r\nconstruction  workers is still very strong.   And  we  are  also\r\n\r\nseeing an increasing number of these foreign workers being\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeployed  to  work  illegally in other  sectors,  such  as  food\r\n\r\nestablishments and cleansing work.  This has obviously distorted\r\n\r\nthe demand for construction workers.  The levy increase, coupled\r\n\r\nwith  enforcement  measures and the new work  permit  allocation\r\n\r\nsystem,  is  necessary to curb the rising  number  of  unskilled\r\n\r\nforeign  construction  workers and  to  tackle  the  problem  of\r\n\r\nconstruction workers working illegally in other sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, foreign construction workers have contributed, as Mr\r\n\r\nChuang  pointed out, to the bulk of our construction  workforce.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  foreign construction workers also contribute  to  the\r\n\r\nbulk  of the increase in foreign workers, from more than 350,000\r\n\r\nin  early  1996  to more than 450,000 currently.   Most  of  the\r\n\r\nincrease  came from the unskilled foreign construction  workers.\r\n\r\nThe  heavy dependence on unskilled foreign construction  workers\r\n\r\nis  not sustainable economically and socially in the long run if\r\n\r\nwe want to remain competitive.  The negative productivity growth\r\n\r\nin  the  construction  sector for the last three  years  clearly\r\n\r\nillustrates how the heavy dependence on foreign unskilled labour\r\n\r\nhad  retarded the growth of the industry.  One indicator of  the\r\n\r\nlow level of the construction industry here in Singapore is seen\r\n\r\nin  the  fact  that only 14% of the workforce are considered  as\r\n\r\nskilled  workers.  In other words, they are on the  current  low\r\n\r\nlevy  scheme  for skilled workers.  In other countries,  with  a\r\n\r\nmuch  more productive and efficient construction industry, there\r\n\r\nare  many  more  skilled workers.  For instance,  in  Australia,\r\n\r\nskilled workers represent 40% of the construction workforce;  in\r\n\r\nFinland, 60% of the construction workforce.  They have  so  many\r\n\r\nmore  skilled workers.  They are so much more productive.   They\r\n\r\nneed  in  total  fewer  workers  to  meet  the  demand  of   the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I also want to point out that having a low\r\n\r\nlevel  and  unproductive construction industry totally dependent\r\n\r\non   large  numbers  of  unskilled  and  inexperienced   foreign\r\n\r\nconstruction  workers  has  also  resulted  in  high  rates   of\r\n\r\naccidents at construction sites.  These people come to Singapore\r\n\r\nto work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithout  any  experience and training and very often,  they  are\r\n\r\ninvolved in unnecessary work site accident.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have provided an alternative to contractors. If they\r\n\r\nhave  difficulty  meeting the higher levy from  1st  April  this\r\n\r\nyear,  they  should  make  greater efforts  to  recruit  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers or send the existing workers for some training and trade\r\n\r\ntesting  so that they can qualify for the lower levy,  which  is\r\n\r\n$100.   I  have to stress that the levy saving for each  skilled\r\n\r\nworker  is more than 12 times the levy increase for an unskilled\r\n\r\nworker.  So it is well worth the while of the contractor to make\r\n\r\na  special effort to bring in a skilled worker or to upgrade the\r\n\r\nskills of the existing workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our announcement since November last year had already\r\n\r\nstarted  to take effect.  Since the announcement, we  have  been\r\n\r\nseeing  more contractors sending their workers for training  and\r\n\r\ntrade  testing at the construction industry training  institute.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  very good trend.  It should be encouraged.   If  we\r\n\r\ndefer the levy increase, the trend might reverse itself and  the\r\n\r\ncontractors  could  well  go  back  to  the  past  practice   of\r\n\r\nrecruiting  more  and  more unskilled  workers.   Therefore,  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  has decided to proceed with the levy increase  on  1st\r\n\r\nApril.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out to the Member that in fact in\r\n\r\nreviewing the foreign worker policy, budget neutrality is really\r\n\r\nnot  a  factor.   Overall, our revision of  the  foreign  worker\r\n\r\npolicy that was announced in November last year, will result  in\r\n\r\na  levy  saving to employers of more than $200 million  a  year,\r\n\r\nboth   in   the   manufacturing  sector,  service   sector   and\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry.  There is a potential to  have  enormous\r\n\r\nlevy  savings.  And in fact, if contractors move to recruit more\r\n\r\nskilled  workers  and  put them on a lower  levy  of  $100,  the\r\n\r\nsavings  would be far more than the $200 million  that  we  have\r\n\r\nestimated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Goh Choon Kang and Mr Ong Ah Heng both spoke on the\r\n\r\nproblems  faced by employers of foreign domestic  workers  whose\r\n\r\ndomestic workers run away from their homes.  I think all Members\r\n\r\nare\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naware  and  the employers of foreign domestic workers  are  also\r\n\r\naware  that they have to post a security bond, which is  $5,000.\r\n\r\nThe  security  bond is a safeguard to ensure that the  employers\r\n\r\ntake  full  responsibility for their foreign workers,  including\r\n\r\nforeign domestic workers, and that they repatriate these foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  when  their  contract or  work  permit  expires.   This\r\n\r\ncondition  is made very clear to each and every applicant  of  a\r\n\r\nforeign  worker,  including the applicants of  foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers.   It is the responsibility that the employers  have  to\r\n\r\nfactor  into  their  decision  in employing  a  foreign  worker.\r\n\r\nWithout the security bond, the employers may not exercise proper\r\n\r\nmanagement and supervision on their foreign workers resulting in\r\n\r\nmore  missing foreign workers and creating more social problems.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  we may even see the emergence of another  problem,\r\n\r\nnamely,  employers  wilfully abandoning their  foreign  workers.\r\n\r\nBecause  if they have no obligation to repatriate their  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers, if they do not have to post a security bond or  if  the\r\n\r\nsecurity bond will not be forfeited, then they may just  abandon\r\n\r\ntheir  workers to their own devices and say, \"You find your  own\r\n\r\nway around.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of cases of missing foreign domestic workers is\r\n\r\nsmall,  considering  that there are more than  100,000  of  them\r\n\r\nworking in Singapore currently.  To date, the cumulative  number\r\n\r\nof  foreign domestic workers who have gone missing is only about\r\n\r\n500  compared  to the several hundred thousand foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers  who have worked in Singapore over the last 20 years  or\r\n\r\nso.   So on balance, we should retain the system of the security\r\n\r\nbond.   There  is no reason for us to change the  security  bond\r\n\r\nrequirement.   It has worked well.  It has kept  the  number  of\r\n\r\nsuch cases and abuses of foreign workers down to a minimum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked what assistance or advice my Ministry\r\n\r\nwould give to employers when their domestic workers go AWOL.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  advise employers to promptly  inform  the  Work\r\n\r\nPermit  Department when their foreign workers run away from  the\r\n\r\nhomes.  They can also seek assistance from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployment agency which brought in the foreign domestic  workers\r\n\r\nin the first instance and also check with the respective Embassy\r\n\r\nbecause,  very  often, these domestic workers would  go  to  the\r\n\r\nEmbassy to complain or to report their grievances they may  have\r\n\r\nwith   the   employers.   When  they  inform  the  Work   Permit\r\n\r\nDepartment,  we  will allow the employers  to  cancel  the  work\r\n\r\npermit  and give them time to locate the foreign workers without\r\n\r\nhaving to pay the foreign worker levy during the interim.   They\r\n\r\ncan  in  fact  also  apply  for a new  foreign  domestic  worker\r\n\r\nthereafter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will exercise flexibility with regard to the bonds. We\r\n\r\nare  not going to forfeit the bond immediately.  In general,  we\r\n\r\nwill  give  the employers a grace period of up to a month  after\r\n\r\nthe cancellation of the work permit to try to locate the foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.   Even  after the security bond has been  forfeited,  a\r\n\r\nrefund  can  still  be  considered if  some  months  later,  the\r\n\r\nemployer can provide some information or assistance which  leads\r\n\r\ntowards the repatriation of the run away domestic worker.  So we\r\n\r\nare  fairly generous and we understand the difficulties of  some\r\n\r\nof the employers and we will try to help them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Choon Kang suggested a foreign labour fund. He\r\n\r\nsuggested that 20% of the workers' wages should go towards  this\r\n\r\nfund  which  would  then be paid back to the workers  when  they\r\n\r\nleave the country.  I would like to point out that, as it stands\r\n\r\ntoday, there is nothing to stop an employer of a foreign worker,\r\n\r\nwhether  he is a worker in the construction sector or a  foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic worker, to strike up a contract with the foreign worker\r\n\r\nthat  if  he  completes his term of contract for two  years,  or\r\n\r\nwhatever  it  is, he will be paid a contract gratuity  and  this\r\n\r\ncontract  gratuity will represent so many percent of  the  wages\r\n\r\nthat he earns over a period of time.  This is entirely possible.\r\n\r\nBut  I would advise employers that if they want to do this,  the\r\n\r\ncontract  gratuity should be clearly spelt out in their contract\r\n\r\nof  service with the foreign worker so that in future there will\r\n\r\nbe  no  argument about unlawful salary deduction  or  retention.\r\n\r\nThis  would  meet the objectives spelt out by Mr Goh.   It  will\r\n\r\nensure that the foreign worker stays on to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  the contract, completes the contract properly  and\r\n\r\nthen  collects  his  contract  gratuity  before  he  leaves  the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Swee Say raised several points about ensuring\r\n\r\nemployability,  particularly of the lower educated  workers  and\r\n\r\nproblems  faced with reskilling the lower skilled  workers,  and\r\n\r\nalso the need to look at the redeployment of workers as they get\r\n\r\ndislocated  from  one sector, for instance, manufacturing,  into\r\n\r\nanother  sector.   I  would say that I agree entirely  with  the\r\n\r\nviews  of Mr Lim.  I think these are valid issues which must  be\r\n\r\nconsidered and we must not take the full employment that we have\r\n\r\nenjoyed  since  the  1970s for granted.  I think  we  were  very\r\n\r\nfortunate  that  we  had  been able to achieve  steady  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  and to maintain full employment over such a long period.\r\n\r\nOur  current economic slowdown is in fact a timely reminder that\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  take full employment and steady economic growth  for\r\n\r\ngranted.  It is also a timely reminder that the problems of  our\r\n\r\nneighbours can very well become our problems too.  As  a  result\r\n\r\nof  the currency crisis and the economic slowdown in the region,\r\n\r\nwe  are  likely to see slower growth this year and retrenchments\r\n\r\nare  likely to rise as the regional crisis takes its  toll.   So\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry will adopt a proactive approach to quickly address\r\n\r\nthe  threat of structural unemployment or retrenched workers  as\r\n\r\nwell as the long-term employability issue mentioned by Mr Lim.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, I have already explained the roles,\r\n\r\nresponsibilities and priorities of the Ministry of Manpower come\r\n\r\nApril  this year.  I will not repeat these points other than  to\r\n\r\nemphasise  that  MOM  will  work  closely  with  our  tripartite\r\n\r\npartners to achieve our vision of a world class workforce and to\r\n\r\nensure that Singaporeans gain a higher level of skills to remain\r\n\r\nemployable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think ensuring lifelong employability for our workers\r\n\r\nwill  have to be a key priority of the new Ministry.   We  would\r\n\r\nhave  to  work  on new initiatives and invest more resources  in\r\n\r\norder  to  achieve this level of skills training and retraining.\r\n\r\nSo MOM will endeavour to put in place a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem  for  continuing  education  and  training  for  all  our\r\n\r\nworkers,  whether they are young or old, unskilled  or  skilled,\r\n\r\nincluding  even  those  who are better educated.   Every  worker\r\n\r\nneeds  to continuously upgrade his skills to be relevant to  the\r\n\r\nchanging needs of the industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I turn to the Member for Bukit Timah, Mrs Yu-Foo\r\n\r\nYee Shoon, who commented on the need to promote flexible or part-time  work, particularly for women who have to balance the needs\r\n\r\nof the family and their career.  Sir, the promotion of part-time\r\n\r\nand  flexible arrangement is very important, given our objective\r\n\r\nto increase the labour force participation of married women aged\r\n\r\n30  to  54, because this is the age group of women where we  are\r\n\r\nseeing   a   very   rapidly  declining   female   labour   force\r\n\r\nparticipation rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, part-time flexible work and teleworking, which has\r\n\r\nbeen  mentioned by the Member, are all viable options that would\r\n\r\nenable  women to balance their family needs with a  career.   In\r\n\r\nthe  1997  Labour Force Survey, half of the 37,700  economically\r\n\r\ninactive  persons,  who  indicated  that  they  wanted  to  seek\r\n\r\nemployment  within the next two years, said that they  preferred\r\n\r\npart-time work.  I think that was why in 1996, we formulated the\r\n\r\npart-time   employees  regulations  to  provide  a   legislative\r\n\r\nframework   to   facilitate  the  creation  of  more   part-time\r\n\r\nemployment.   These  regulations  spell  out  the   rights   and\r\n\r\nobligations  of employers and part-time employees,  and  provide\r\n\r\nflexibility  in  terms of encashing certain statutory  benefits.\r\n\r\nHowever,   part-time  employment  is  still  not  prevalent   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  constitutes only 3% of employment in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSo there is still a lot of room for improvement and we will make\r\n\r\ngreater  efforts in order to promote this idea  of  having  more\r\n\r\npart-time  jobs  or  flexible work schedules,  particularly  for\r\n\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Productivity and Standards Board is, in fact, planning\r\n\r\na job redesign programme.  This job redesign\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogramme will provide a framework for organisations to  enhance\r\n\r\nproductivity in continuous work process improvement  and  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading, as well as to help organisations address the issue of\r\n\r\nmanpower  shortage and an aging workforce.  Under the programme,\r\n\r\nbasic job redesign models will be developed by consultants hired\r\n\r\nfor  this purpose.  And once the models are developed,  we  will\r\n\r\nshare  them  with employers so that they can help  employers  to\r\n\r\nrestructure  the  jobs  in  their workplace.   The  models  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  include options for part-time employment  and  flexi-work  arrangements.  The Ministry of Manpower will work  closely\r\n\r\nwith PSB in order to promote this programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Timah also mentioned the example of\r\n\r\nSweden  where  many women are able to work.  In  fact,  Sweden's\r\n\r\nfemale  labour force participation rate is almost equal  to  the\r\n\r\nmale  labour  force participation rate through the  various  age\r\n\r\ngroups,  suggesting that Swedish women do not withdraw from  the\r\n\r\nworkforce  upon reaching marriage or child bearing  age,  unlike\r\n\r\nwomen  in Singapore.  Swedish women are able to enjoy, what  the\r\n\r\nMember described, an excellent set of benefits to enable them to\r\n\r\nstay  in  employment while at the same time  raising  a  family.\r\n\r\nThis support system, I must point out, is sustained by very high\r\n\r\ntax  rates.  Therefore, the model s not wholly relevant  to  us.\r\n\r\nAnd  for  Members'  interest, the level of  social  and  welfare\r\n\r\nsupport  provided  by the Swedish government requires  extremely\r\n\r\nhigh  tax revenues.  90% of the employees pay approximately  30%\r\n\r\nof  their  salary in income tax, and the remaining  10%  of  the\r\n\r\nemployees pay more than 30% of their salary as taxes.  And  that\r\n\r\nis  not the main source of the revenue for the state.  The  main\r\n\r\nsource of revenue for the state is, in fact, the 25% value-added\r\n\r\ntax,  which  every  consumer pays.   With  such  high  rates  of\r\n\r\ntaxation,  they can afford to redistribute to all these  welfare\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison, in Singapore, only 30% of individuals pay\r\n\r\nincome  tax.  70% do not pay income tax. According to the Inland\r\n\r\nRevenue Authority of Singapore, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neffective tax rate in Singapore is only about 8.1% in 1997, 8.2%\r\n\r\nin  1995  and  our  GST is only 3%.  So we are  looking  at  two\r\n\r\ntotally  different  systems.  While  they  may  have  some  good\r\n\r\npoints,  we should be careful about which are the ones  that  we\r\n\r\nwant to adopt and modify for our application in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to highlight that one\r\n\r\nof  the problems facing women who want to take on part-time jobs\r\n\r\nis  that employers do not have the right attitude towards  part-time  workers.  Very often, employers consider part-time workers\r\n\r\nas  being  less  committed and less reliable.   They  see  their\r\n\r\nemployment  as being supplementary and transient in nature,  and\r\n\r\nhence many employers are not prepared to hire part-time workers.\r\n\r\nAnd if they do hire, they are not prepared to invest in training\r\n\r\nor  upgrading  the skills of their part-time workers.   I  think\r\n\r\nthis mindset has to change, if we want to promote part-time  and\r\n\r\nflexible  work  arrangements.  Employers have to be  more  open,\r\n\r\nmore innovative, as I said earlier on, with regard to attracting\r\n\r\nworkers, particularly women, back into the workforce.  They have\r\n\r\nto  accept  that some women would only want to take on part-time\r\n\r\njobs  and they will be equally committed, equally dedicated  and\r\n\r\nequally reliable compared to  full-time workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon:</b> Sir, I want to touch on CPF policy.\r\n\r\nMy  concern  is  that CPF originally started off  as  a  pension\r\n\r\nscheme  catering for the retirement needs of Singaporeans.   But\r\n\r\ntoday,  we  use it for housing, medical care and even education.\r\n\r\nMore  recently, CPF could even be used for investments in stocks\r\n\r\nand  shares.   I  would like to ask the Minister  what  are  the\r\n\r\naverage  balances  in  the  ordinary  and  special  accounts  of\r\n\r\nmembers,  and  whether  the  Ministry  considers  such   amounts\r\n\r\nsufficient  to  meet  the  needs of  the  average  workers  upon\r\n\r\nretirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is that, lately, we also give the\r\n\r\nflexibility for CPF members to invest their CPF funds.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to say that there is a need to educate CPF members who  are\r\n\r\nignorant of the mechanism of the stock market.  There should  be\r\n\r\nmore safeguards so that CPF savings are not excessively exposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, Mrs Yu-Foo is concerned whether CPF\r\n\r\nsavings are adequate, especially for the older CPF members.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to quickly point out that low CPF balances of older\r\n\r\nCPF members is the result of low wages and low CPF contribution\r\n\r\nrate in past years.  While this may be inevitable and actually\r\n\r\nreflects the gradual growth of our economy, we, as  a\r\n\r\nGovernment, have launched various efforts to help older CPF\r\n\r\nmembers to build up their CPF savings.  Examples are the CPF Top-Up Scheme, Pre-Medisave Top-Up Scheme and Minimum Sum Top-Up\r\n\r\nScheme for both spouse and parents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that the net CPF savings have\r\n\r\nactually  been  increasing over the years.   For  instance,  the\r\n\r\nmedian  net balance, which is the total CPF savings less savings\r\n\r\ncommitted for investments in property or stocks and shares,  for\r\n\r\nthose  who turned 55 in 1995 was about $45,000.   For those  who\r\n\r\nturned  55  in  1997,  the median net balance  had  gone  up  to\r\n\r\n$52,000, an increase of about $7,000 over the two years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I also want to point out that all of a\r\n\r\nmember's  CPF  assets  including the cash in  the  CPF  account,\r\n\r\nproperty, insurance and investments are available for  old  age,\r\n\r\nnot just the cash component.  We cannot just look at what is the\r\n\r\nnet  balance and say, \"Is this adequate?\"  We must look  at  the\r\n\r\ntotal  CPF portfolio.  For instance, investments under  the  CPF\r\n\r\ninvestment  scheme  can  be easily converted  into  cash.    The\r\n\r\nshares  can  be liquidated or sold and the cash can be  used  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the needs of the retired members.  Furthermore, a  retired\r\n\r\nCPF  member can also sell off, for instance, a 5-room  flat  and\r\n\r\nthen  move to a smaller 3-room flat to free up cash to meet  his\r\n\r\nneeds  for  daily  expenses.  And if we look  at  the  regrossed\r\n\r\nbalance  of  members who turned 55 in 1997, 70% of them  already\r\n\r\nhave balances which exceed the current minimum sum of $50,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Younger CPF members should be able to save up sufficiently\r\n\r\nto  meet their basic needs when they retire.  For instance,  the\r\n\r\nmedian net balance in the ordinary and special accounts for  the\r\n\r\nyounger workers between 45 and 55 years is already\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$47,000.   And  the regrossed balance is, in fact, much  higher,\r\n\r\nabout $100,000 for CPF members in the same age group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by the year 2003, when the minimum sum scheme will\r\n\r\nreach  its target of $80,000 with $40,000 in the cash component,\r\n\r\nabout  80% of the active CPF members would be able to  meet  the\r\n\r\nminimum sum requirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also asked about the CPF investment scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.55 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

The Government announced  five\r\n\r\nprinciples  which  will be the basis for the new  vehicular  tax\r\n\r\nstructure.  These five principles are: first, charging  on  road\r\n\r\nusage;   second, charging based on three factors -  charging  on\r\n\r\nthe  use of road space, damage to the road and the progressivity\r\n\r\nfactor;  third,  tax  concession to taxis and  scheduled  buses;\r\n\r\nfourth,  rationalise existing structure; and, fifth, to maintain\r\n\r\nrevenue neutrality globally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to examine the new charge system for motorcycles,\r\n\r\nwhich  I  think is not very fair.  We are told that a motorcycle\r\n\r\nis 0.5 pcu (passenger car unit), when a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnormal  private car is 1, similar for a taxi and a  light  goods\r\n\r\nvehicle.   A bus, for example, has a pcu of between  1.5-2.    A\r\n\r\ncar entering the gantry at the East Coast Parkway from 1st April\r\n\r\n1998 will have to pay $1 from 7.30 am to 8.00 am, compared to  a\r\n\r\nfee  of 50 cents for the two-wheel motorcycle, which has  a  pcu\r\n\r\nrating  of  0.5.   A  two-wheel vehicle, such as  a  motorcycle,\r\n\r\nshould  proportionally cause less damage to the  road,  compared\r\n\r\nwith  a four-wheel vehicle, in addition to the fact that it  is,\r\n\r\nof  course, half the size.  Should not the rate for a  two-wheel\r\n\r\nvehicle  be less than 25 cents?  At that rate, it would  be  the\r\n\r\nsame  as  a  light goods vehicle which is charged at  25  cents.\r\n\r\nAlso, presumably because they are used for business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motorcyclists also go to town a lot in the course of\r\n\r\nbusiness.  And if we were to factor in the progressivity element\r\n\r\nand  rank  the ordinal scale of charge, I would put it  at  less\r\n\r\nthan  that  of  a LGV, and definitely less than that  of  taxis.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the present scheme as proposed, the charges for  the\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists  are  higher than the taxis and  the  light  goods\r\n\r\nvehicles,  at  off peak and peak hours.  I think this  is  quite\r\n\r\nunfair.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, I must commend the\r\n\r\nMinister for Communications for  the implementation of  the  ERP\r\n\r\nsystem.  I think the ground has been well prepared and also  the\r\n\r\njustification for ERP has been made fairly well known.   I  have\r\n\r\nno   complaints  about  the  charges  and  there  have  been  no\r\n\r\ncriticisms  of  the ERP charges that will be  implemented.   The\r\n\r\ncharge  proposed for cars from 7.30 am to 8.00 am is  $1.   From\r\n\r\n<br>8.00 am to 9.00 am, it is a $2 charge, a doubling of the charge.\r\n\r\nFrom 9.00 am to 9.30 am, it is $1.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this very large jump from 8.00 am onwards will lead to\r\n\r\nan  uneven and non-smooth flow of traffic.  We all know  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  CBD  and ECP charges.  When there is a charge,  drivers\r\n\r\nslow  down  in  order  to avoid paying the  charge.    And  some\r\n\r\ndrivers  actually park their cars by the side  of  the  road  in\r\n\r\norder to make sure that they  get in at the correct time.  So if\r\n\r\nwe  have  this jump from $1 to $2 at 8 o'clock, then the drivers\r\n\r\nwill slow down\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir cars and traffic becomes uneven.  And marginally, the  few\r\n\r\nminutes  before eight o'clock, what will happen  is  that  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  very light traffic because cars will not be sure  that\r\n\r\nthey  will meet the eight o'clock deadline.  There will be  very\r\n\r\nfew  cars  going  in just before eight o'clock.   So  those  few\r\n\r\nminutes  before eight o'clock will be quite crucial when drivers\r\n\r\nwill slow down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the system is electronic, I suggest to the Minister\r\n\r\nthat he should look into the smoothening of the charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, let me give an illustration. If there are\r\n\r\nintermediate  charges before 8 am and there are  more  intervals\r\n\r\nfor  charges,  traffic  will smoothen out.   There  could  be  a\r\n\r\ncompromise of the peak charge.  Instead of 8 am, maybe it  could\r\n\r\nbe  delayed  to, say, 8.15 am.  So we may have a  charge  system\r\n\r\nlike  7.30  am to 7.45 am, $1 charge; 7.45 am to 8 am,  say,  at\r\n\r\n$1.25; 8 am to 8.15 am, $1.50; 8.15 am to 9 am, a peak charge of\r\n\r\n$2 or some combination of these charges.  If we can do that, the\r\n\r\ntraffic  flow would be much smoother.  Since the system has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  implemented  yet,  I urge the Minister  to  consider  this\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point I have to make on the ERP is that the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  planning for ERP has been going on for  nearly  two\r\n\r\nyears  and what we see as a result in the implementation of  the\r\n\r\nERP  is that there are several gantry points sprouting all  over\r\n\r\nSingapore  island.  Although a lot of tests have  been  done  on\r\n\r\nthis  system,  we have looked at the functional  aspects  and  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  miss out on form.  The archways look very  unsightly,\r\n\r\nand  to  make it worse, at the CBD gantry points, we  have  more\r\n\r\nthan  one gantry steel structure.  Is it not possible to combine\r\n\r\nthe CBD and ERP gantry points?  They look so unsightly.  This is\r\n\r\nespecially  so  in  the case of the CBD  as  this  is  the  main\r\n\r\napproach to our city centre.  Visitors coming to Singapore  will\r\n\r\nnot  understand  why a nice and beautiful city  has  these  very\r\n\r\nunsightly steel structures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, the ERP\r\n\r\nscheme,  the first of its kind in the world, reflects  not  only\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment's  ability  to  create a  world-class  transportation\r\n\r\ninfrastructure,  but  also its ability to set  world  standards.\r\n\r\nBut  in every conquest, in every pinnacle of achievement,  there\r\n\r\nwill inevitably be teething implementation problems that need to\r\n\r\nbe resolved and the ERP is no exception.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, presently, for the normal motorists, the Ministry\r\n\r\nintends  to allow the use of Cashcard but not the NETS  card  or\r\n\r\nthe  credit  card  for  ERP payment.  Presumably,  the  argument\r\n\r\nagainst  allowing  the  use of NETS  or  credit  cards  is  that\r\n\r\nconfidential information about the motorist and the  whereabouts\r\n\r\nof his car could be tracked by the authority and, therefore, the\r\n\r\npublic could be unhappy about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think, this may be a fallacy. Let me explain.\r\n\r\nThere  are  a number of problems that can occur with  Cashcards.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  the  drivers can end up with  fines  because  the\r\n\r\nCashcards, as luck might have it, may not be topped up  in  time\r\n\r\nwith  sufficient cash.  I can say with confidence that, using  a\r\n\r\nrule  of  thumb, 80% to 90% of the drivers would prefer  to  use\r\n\r\ntheir  NETS  or credit cards for ERP payments as  it  would  not\r\n\r\nreally matter to most of them if the authorities do track  their\r\n\r\nmovements.   In  fact, Sir, the truth is, many  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic have the perception that their movements would be tracked\r\n\r\nanyway  even  with the use of Cashcards.  Sir, I  know  this  is\r\n\r\nuntrue  but that is a separate point.  My point, Sir,  is  maybe\r\n\r\nless  than  10%  or 20% of the road users may prefer  to  ensure\r\n\r\nconfidentiality of their travels because they either attempt  to\r\n\r\ncheat  their companies with false transport claims or  they  are\r\n\r\ntrying to cheat their spouse with false claim of where they went\r\n\r\nor  for  some  other reasons of their own.   So  it  is  only  a\r\n\r\nminority.   I would like to urge the LTA, particularly  the  LTA\r\n\r\nofficials,  the civil servants, to give motorists an  option  to\r\n\r\nuse the Cashcard or the NETS or credit cards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the day and age of e-commerce, which is central to our\r\n\r\nnational project, Singapore One, confidential information  would\r\n\r\nbe transferred through NETS and credit card transactions through\r\n\r\nthe Internet.  It is certainly the way we are heading towards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether it is\r\n\r\ntechnically  possible  for ERP gantry booths  and  IU  units  to\r\n\r\nincorporate  the use of NETS or credit cards and,  if  so,  what\r\n\r\nwould  be the additional costs.  Would it be so exorbitant  that\r\n\r\nthe e-commerce through the NETS cannot handle?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to also urge the Minister to consider\r\n\r\nthis  point.   The  Minister  is a  very  gentle  Minister.   He\r\n\r\nlistens,  so  does  his  MOS but I am not  sure  about  the  LTA\r\n\r\nofficials.   Just to make my point, last year  I  made  a  hard-hitting speech on the civil servants in the Environment Ministry\r\n\r\nand their lack of effort in training the DREs.  After my speech,\r\n\r\na  lot of headway was made in the last one year, and today, I am\r\n\r\nhappy  that some of the senior civil servants in the Environment\r\n\r\nMinistry  want  to  be  a  model Ministry  in  labour-management\r\n\r\nrelations.   I would be happy to nominate ENV for an LMR  Award.\r\n\r\nSo  the  scene  has changed, and I do not want to make  a  hard-hitting  speech  on  the  civil  servants  in  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunications, but I hope  they will take this  in  a  positive\r\n\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the LTA officials to go to the\r\n\r\nNETS  and  credit card companies with an open mind so that  ways\r\n\r\ncan  be  found  for motorists to use the roads with  a  peaceful\r\n\r\nframe  of mind.  Sir, motorists would like to have a smooth  and\r\n\r\nfine road journey without the fear of being fined.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\ncongratulate  the Minister for a very well thought-out  plan  on\r\n\r\nroad  management as represented by the Electronic  Road  Pricing\r\n\r\nScheme   and  the  accompanying  rebate  and  road  tax   reform\r\n\r\nprogramme.   I would also like to congratulate the Minister  for\r\n\r\nhaving  spent  much  time  and  effort  in  explaining  all  the\r\n\r\nramifications  of  the  plan  and  answering  all  the   various\r\n\r\nquestions  that  have  arisen, privately, publicly  and  in  the\r\n\r\nmedia.   My  colleagues  and I on the GPC (Communications)  have\r\n\r\nalso  made  many queries and suggestions which the Minister  and\r\n\r\nhis  staff have forbearingly and patiently tolerated.   I  thank\r\n\r\nthe Minister for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister would forbear one more time for a\r\n\r\nsimple request.  There has been some anxiety about the safety of\r\n\r\nthe  in-vehicle unit used to pay ERP charges.  There  have  also\r\n\r\nbeen  requests  to  reveal the details  of  the  tests  and  the\r\n\r\nconditions  in  which they have been conducted.  I  suppose  the\r\n\r\npeople who have asked want to evaluate for themselves whether it\r\n\r\nis  indeed  safe or not.  Above all, there have been queries  on\r\n\r\nmany  aspects  of  implementation and on the  operation  of  the\r\n\r\nsystem.   As  these have appeared in various media and  fora  in\r\n\r\ndribs and drabs at different times and different places, can the\r\n\r\nMinister  consider  putting  these and  other  frequently  asked\r\n\r\nquestions (in Internet jargon, it is the FAQs) on their  website\r\n\r\nor  some other websites dedicated to this topic and give us  the\r\n\r\nURL, the address of this website, and then for those who are not\r\n\r\nInternet  ready, to have these answers compiled and disseminated\r\n\r\nin  hard  copy  brochures  and booklets  in  the  four  official\r\n\r\nlanguages?  We would all be very grateful if the Minister  could\r\n\r\noblige.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, my cut is on\r\n\r\nElectronic  Road Pricing.  It was reported that  the  Electronic\r\n\r\nRoad Pricing system cameras erected in the ECP, the highways and\r\n\r\nother  roads have shown to be very efficient in detecting  those\r\n\r\nvehicles that cross the gantries.  The cameras there can produce\r\n\r\nvery  clear pictures of those vehicles who pass that way without\r\n\r\nan  in-vehicle unit or Cashcard.  In fact, the system  has  been\r\n\r\ndescribed as foolproof by Mr Chin Kian Keong, LTA's Manager  for\r\n\r\nRoad Pricing.  This means that the Government shall have another\r\n\r\nefficient  means  of collecting revenue.  In  the  eyes  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the ERP system is to control vehicle use  but  from\r\n\r\nthe public's point of view, it is viewed more as a device set up\r\n\r\nby  the Government to collect more revenue.  The Government  has\r\n\r\nalready set up a quota system.  When this quota system was first\r\n\r\nimplemented, it was touted as the ultimate system to control the\r\n\r\nnumber  of cars on the roads.  This means that traffic jams  are\r\n\r\ncut to a minimum and a desired number of cars is only allowed to\r\n\r\nbe used on the roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have an additional system to regulate the number of\r\n\r\nvehicles   which  is  only  allowed  to  pass  certain   points,\r\n\r\npurportedly which will not cause traffic jams.  But in the first\r\n\r\nplace,  we have already a system whereby the number of  vehicles\r\n\r\nis  controlled to prevent or to cut down traffic jams.   So  the\r\n\r\nquestion is: Will the quota system be eventually scrapped  since\r\n\r\nwe  have a new system? Otherwise, the quota system does not make\r\n\r\nsense  at  all.  In the first place, you control the  number  of\r\n\r\ncars and the Government says that this is the ultimate number of\r\n\r\ncars  allowed  on  the roads.  Then you have another  system  to\r\n\r\ncontrol this number of cars which is supposedly allowed  on  the\r\n\r\nroads  in  the first place.  So we either use one or  the  other\r\n\r\nsystem, otherwise it does not make sense at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I think I\r\n\r\ncan  tell Mr Chiam See Tong that the Government will not abolish\r\n\r\nthe  COE  because the COE is a steady source of income  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government claims that the purpose of implementing the\r\n\r\nERP is to ease the congestion on our roads.  It will also switch\r\n\r\nfrom a fixed road tax system which taxes on ownership to that of\r\n\r\na  road  pricing system which taxes on usage.  Road tax  rebates\r\n\r\nwill  be  provided for the next five years,  and the  Government\r\n\r\nclaims  that  the  implementation of ERP will not  increase  its\r\n\r\nrevenue.   But  what will happen five years later when  no  more\r\n\r\nroad  tax  rebates  will be given?  With higher  ERP  fees,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's revenue will surely go up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another thing that we should know, that is, with\r\n\r\nthe  ERP system, whenever we use the road  we will have  to  pay\r\n\r\nfor  it,  like  GST.  You cannot escape from it.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand, the Government is assured of a steady income, irrespective\r\n\r\nof the economic situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that the reason for the Government to\r\n\r\nrevise  the  various  tax  structures was  to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will have a steady tax revenue irrespective  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic situation.  In recent years,  taxes on  motor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvehicles  have  become an important source of  revenue  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. For example, in last year's budget,  the  Government\r\n\r\nexpected  to collect more than $4 billion from COE, import  tax,\r\n\r\nARF, and  road tax.  However, apart from the road tax which is a\r\n\r\nfixed income, revenues from the other taxes were affected by the\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn and the number of COEs the  Government  could\r\n\r\nissue.    For  the financial year 1st April 1996 to  31st  March\r\n\r\n1997,  the  Government's income from COE was $120  million  less\r\n\r\nthan  the  expected  amount.   On  ARF,  the  revenue  was  $174\r\n\r\nmillion  less  than the expected amount.  For this  reason,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  says  it  is allowing more people  to  own  cars  by\r\n\r\nissuing more COEs.  This would make up for the loss in the above\r\n\r\nrevenue.   At the same time, apart from the fixed road tax,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  now implementing the ERP system to  ensure  they\r\n\r\nhave a steady income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, the ERP will be\r\n\r\nimplemented  soon.   The implementation  of  the  ERP  has  been\r\n\r\nexplained very clearly.  And as we all know, the ERP is meant to\r\n\r\ndissuade  excessive usage of the roads in the  areas  which  are\r\n\r\nvery  heavily  congested with traffic,  for  example,  CBD.   In\r\n\r\ngeneral, I do support the concept of the ERP.  There are certain\r\n\r\nadvantages  and disadvantages.  For myself and others  like  me,\r\n\r\nwho  have  to  use the CBD or CTE, I would say  that  it  is  an\r\n\r\nadvantage.  At the present moment, if you want to go there,  you\r\n\r\nhave  either  to  choose  between a daily  or  a  monthly  pass.\r\n\r\nTherefore  you  have  to  make a detour  to  a  post  office  or\r\n\r\nsomewhere  which sells monthly pass and buy the pass.   If  not,\r\n\r\nevery  day,  you have to scout around for a booth, stop  by  the\r\n\r\nbooth  and buy the pass.  Sometimes, in a hurry, you may  forget\r\n\r\nand  then you enter these areas inadvertently and end up with  a\r\n\r\nfine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these people, who are probably the large majority of\r\n\r\nthose  who  use  these areas, I think things  have  become  more\r\n\r\nconvenient where you do not have to make a detour or you do  not\r\n\r\nhave  to  stop by a booth to buy your passes, but you  can  just\r\n\r\nenter these areas as long as you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  the  Cashcard and the IU. And some of us, like myself  who\r\n\r\nbuy  a  monthly  pass, the number of times I  actually  use  the\r\n\r\ngantry points at the permitted times would be probably less than\r\n\r\n10 a month, but I buy a monthly pass because of its convenience.\r\n\r\nSo  for  those  of us who are in this category, we will  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom these changes.  In fact, we will pay less.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, I think the Ministry has explained to us that\r\n\r\nthe  intention  is  not  to earn revenue.   However,  there  are\r\n\r\ncertain areas in which the Ministry can further improve upon  to\r\n\r\nreassure  the  majority of us that that is not their  intention.\r\n\r\nAs  announced, the cost of the ERP charges will be levied  on  a\r\n\r\nper entry basis.  Therefore, vehicles will be charged every time\r\n\r\nthey  pass through the ERP gantry.  I think we want to alleviate\r\n\r\nthe burden on the motorists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we may want to relook at the boundaries carefully,\r\n\r\nespecially the CBD boundaries, so that those who work within the\r\n\r\nCBD  and  have to travel from one point to another  in  the  CBD\r\n\r\nshould be able to return back to their office without having  to\r\n\r\ngo  in  and  out of the ERP gantry points and incur  unnecessary\r\n\r\ncost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Ministry may want to consider a rebate system\r\n\r\nor  a diminishing charge for a motorist who has to make multiple\r\n\r\npasses  during a single day.  I believe that those who  have  to\r\n\r\nmake multiple passes through the CBD every day have to do so not\r\n\r\nbecause they really want to do so, but because they have  to  do\r\n\r\nso.   I  do  not see any great attraction in the CBD that  would\r\n\r\nattract  people to make multiple trips into the CBD.   Some  who\r\n\r\nare  in the sales line or the delivery services may have to make\r\n\r\nmultiple trips into the CBD as part of their business.  I  think\r\n\r\nthe aim is to dissuade people from using the CBD.  However, as I\r\n\r\nsaid, if they have to make multiple trips, it is usually because\r\n\r\nof business reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, the Ministry should have a system where\r\n\r\npeople  who  make multiple trips, say, three to five trips  into\r\n\r\nthe CBD or pass through the gantry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseveral  times, they may want to either give them  a  rebate  or\r\n\r\nreduce the charges during the repeated entries, so as not to add\r\n\r\nunnecessarily to the cost of business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Ministry will reconsider these comments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, the Minister and his team\r\n\r\nhave  struck  a  fine balance between the need to  move  towards\r\n\r\nusage  based charges, rationalise tax structures and  ensure  an\r\n\r\nelement  of progressivity in the system.  I would just  like  to\r\n\r\nhighlight three points for the Minister and his team to consider\r\n\r\nin implementing the system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it must be administered flexibly. The changes are\r\n\r\nwide-ranging  and  the system is complex.  Road  users  and  the\r\n\r\nindustry  need  time  to digest and adjust to  the  system  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  I  think  the  Ministry  needs  to  be  flexible  in\r\n\r\nresponding to any unanticipated issues or problems.  The  recent\r\n\r\nresponse to bring forward some of the reduction in charges  was,\r\n\r\nI think, a case in point where the Ministry responded flexibly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is a need to closely monitor the impact of\r\n\r\nERP  on  public transportation.  The question is how  this  cost\r\n\r\nwill  be  transferred  or  passed on  to  the  users  of  public\r\n\r\ntransport.   This  is  particularly important  now  because  the\r\n\r\nMinister has, in conjunction with this ERP initiative, announced\r\n\r\nthe deregulation of taxi fares.  In Singapore, we have less than\r\n\r\na  handful of taxi operators and in such an oligopolistic market\r\n\r\nstructure,  the  scope  for cartel-like  behaviour  does  exist.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  fully  support  the principle of deregulation  and  its\r\n\r\nattendant benefits.  But I do believe there remains the need for\r\n\r\nGovernment  to retain a residual anti-trust type of function  to\r\n\r\nensure  and  protect against non-competitive practices  such  as\r\n\r\nprice fixing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, the move towards ERP and other usage based\r\n\r\ncharges  must be matched by a commensurate improvement  in  road\r\n\r\nservices.   It  is  gratifying to see the underpasses,  tunnels,\r\n\r\nflyovers, which improve traffic flow.  The most recent  addition\r\n\r\nto this series has been the EMAS (Expressway Monitoring\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  Advisory  System).  Some motorists  are  still  puzzled  or\r\n\r\nuncertain  as to the value that this system adds to the  traffic\r\n\r\nmanagement.   In  part, Sir, this is due to some confusion  over\r\n\r\nthe  name.  Some think it is a MINDEF initiative, that it stands\r\n\r\nfor  Emergency Mobilisation Announcement System.  And others who\r\n\r\nare  more  mischievous point out that EMAS  is the  word  \"same\"\r\n\r\nspelt backwards, meaning traffic condition remains unaltered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a need obviously to explain clearly to\r\n\r\nmotorists  what is the value that this system brings, especially\r\n\r\nsince  a  lot  of  it  already is provided through  radios.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  I would appreciate it if the Minister could elaborate\r\n\r\nwhat further use is envisaged for this EMAS system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just\r\n\r\nnow,  the  Member for Hougang told the Member for  Potong  Pasir\r\n\r\nthat the COE is a source of revenue for the Government.  We  all\r\n\r\nagree  that  taxes are meant to be sources of  revenue  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  But this is not a one-way traffic, but  a   two-way\r\n\r\ntraffic.   When the Government  collects taxes from the  people,\r\n\r\nthey  spend  them  on improving the standard of  living  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this year's budget of the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCommunications, there is a breakthrough.  There is   finally   a\r\n\r\nreduction on diesel tax.  Under the new vehicle tax system,  the\r\n\r\ntaxi  diesel  tax  will  be reduced from  $6,600  to  $5,100,  a\r\n\r\nreduction of $1,500.  In a dialogue between Minister Mah and the\r\n\r\ntaxi drivers, he said that this is an angpow to them.  According\r\n\r\nto  LTA's  calculation, with the reduction in taxi  diesel  tax,\r\n\r\nafter offsetting the slightly increased road tax, there will  be\r\n\r\na  tax  saving of $109 million for the taxi operators  over  the\r\n\r\nnext seven years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to show appreciation to the taxi drivers'\r\n\r\ncontribution to public transportation, LTA will discuss with the\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers'  association and the taxi  companies  on  how  to\r\n\r\nallow the taxi drivers to enjoy a share in this rebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last debate on the Ministry of Communications'\r\n\r\nbudget, my Parliamentary colleague, Mr Ong Ah Heng, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  suggested  that if there were any rebate on the  taxi  diesel\r\n\r\ntax, it should be channelled to the Medisave account of the taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers.   I  hope that this would be done.  This has  been  the\r\n\r\ncommon wish of the taxi drivers all these years, because in this\r\n\r\nway,  they will not have to pay from their own pocket to top  up\r\n\r\nthe  Medisave account for the self-employed persons. I  am  very\r\n\r\nglad  to  note  that  the  three taxi  operator  companies  have\r\n\r\nindicated that they will be discussing with the taxi drivers  on\r\n\r\nhow to share the savings on taxi diesel tax with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my question to the Minister for Communications is:\r\n\r\nWhat  is  the long term policy on diesel tax?  From the  present\r\n\r\n$5,100,  will the diesel tax be further reduced every  year  and\r\n\r\neventually be completely abolished?  Or will the taxi diesel tax\r\n\r\nbe reduced to a certain amount and remain stagnant there?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although LTA has indicated that they will monitor the taxi\r\n\r\nmileage  and  said, \"If taxi mileage comes down  further,  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  scope to further reduce the diesel tax.\", I feel  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  transparency in this matter  can  be  further\r\n\r\nenhanced.   Why  can  a decision not be made now  to  completely\r\n\r\nabolish  the diesel tax by a certain time?  Then, when they  are\r\n\r\ndiscussing  on  how to share the savings with the taxi  drivers,\r\n\r\nthey would have a better idea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our new vehicle tax system seeks to shift from taxing on\r\n\r\nownership  to taxing on the usage.  In other words,  \"use  more,\r\n\r\ntax  more\".   So  during the peak hours,  the  charges  will  be\r\n\r\nhigher.   Diesel  tax is a product of the old transport  system.\r\n\r\nIt does not fit into the new principle of taxing on usage.  This\r\n\r\nis  also the complaint of the taxi drivers all these years.  Why\r\n\r\ndo  we  not  solve  this  old problem  simultaneously  with  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of a new tax system?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chee Wee (Boon Lay):</b> Sir, the Minister has\r\n\r\nannounced a package of vehicle tax changes.  The rationalisation\r\n\r\nexercise has been a comprehensive one.  I welcome the changes as\r\n\r\nthey are fair and rational.  Except for the motorcyclists and  a\r\n\r\nminority few who are adversely affected\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the  changes, most motorists could benefit from the new  tax\r\n\r\nstructure as the emphasis is shifted from ownership restraint to\r\n\r\nusage restraint.  The package of rebates has also been carefully\r\n\r\nformulated  so  as  to  lighten  the  burden  of  the  motorists\r\n\r\nsubsequent to the introduction of ERP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I go on, I must declare my interest as a\r\n\r\ndirector of Comfort Group Limited.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in formulating the tax changes, the Ministry had held\r\n\r\nconsultations with various groups, including the taxi  operators\r\n\r\nand  taxi  drivers.   During  the  dialogue  session,  the  taxi\r\n\r\noperators  and  drivers  have put forward  several  suggestions,\r\n\r\nwhich  would  accord taxis with some concessions, in recognition\r\n\r\nof their public transport role.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two specific requests which I would like to\r\n\r\nhighlight:  first, is to reduce the taxi diesel tax,  the  point\r\n\r\nalready  raised by Mr Seng Han Thong.  The other is to phase  in\r\n\r\nERP charges for taxis gradually.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad the Ministry has taken these requests into\r\n\r\nconsideration and has agreed to reduce taxi diesel tax  as  well\r\n\r\nas  to  phase  in the ERP charges over a period of three  years.\r\n\r\nThe  reduction of this taxi diesel tax came as a relief  to  the\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers  and  operators who  have  long  lobbied  for  it.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  Ministry has also decided, at the same  time,  to\r\n\r\nraise  the ARF imposed on taxis to bring it on par with  private\r\n\r\nvehicles.  This will raise the upfront cost of purchasing a taxi\r\n\r\nsubstantially.   For new and replacement taxis,  therefore,  the\r\n\r\nsavings  in  diesel tax will be largely offset by the  increased\r\n\r\nvehicle  taxes.   The actual cost savings to the taxi  operators\r\n\r\nwould,  therefore, come only from the existing  fleet  of  taxis\r\n\r\nwhich  were subject to the old tax regime.  Nevertheless,  there\r\n\r\nare  sizable  savings  which could be  passed  on  to  the  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers.   And  I  have no doubt that the taxi  companies  would\r\n\r\ndiscuss with the taxi driver representatives on ways to pass the\r\n\r\nbenefits  of cost savings to the drivers in a fair and equitable\r\n\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in speaking on this amendment, I do not intend to pose\r\n\r\nspecific  questions to the Minister.  I just wish to offer  some\r\n\r\ncomments on this subject and commend the Minister for consulting\r\n\r\nand  seeking the views of the various interest groups, including\r\n\r\nthe  taxi operators and drivers, while formulating the  new  tax\r\n\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, first, I would like\r\n\r\nto  declare  my  interest in the subject  as  President  of  the\r\n\r\nAutomobile Association of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the responses to the forthcoming vehicle tax changes\r\n\r\nhas  been  a  tremendous disappointment in the 10% reduction  in\r\n\r\nARF.  There has been an expectancy of a much larger reduction in\r\n\r\nthe ARF and some people even look forward to the day when ARF is\r\n\r\nreduced to zero.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that any reduction in ARF would be more than\r\n\r\noffset by an increase in COE price.  When the ARF was reduced to\r\n\r\n150%,  the  increase in COE more than made up for the reduction.\r\n\r\nBut  then again that was when COEs were transferable and  people\r\n\r\nwere  not familiar with the mechanism.  No one expected  COE  to\r\n\r\never  fall  in price.  When the COEs were made non-transferable,\r\n\r\nexcept for the Open Category, COE prices went for a tumble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, COEs in recent months have been on a downtrend. There\r\n\r\nwas  even  a  freak  result of $50 for one  of  the  categories.\r\n\r\nPeople  are getting wise to the fact that a vehicle  is  not  an\r\n\r\ninvestment  and  that  the  COE is  a  cost  factor  not  to  be\r\n\r\nspeculated in.  It can rise or fall.  There is no doubt that the\r\n\r\nimmediate impact of a reduction in ARF would lead to an increase\r\n\r\nin  COE  prices.  Some dealers will package the deal  where  any\r\n\r\nsaving in ARF would be thrown into the bidding price for a  COE.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  overall  package price for  a  vehicle  would  be\r\n\r\nlowered the savings would not reflect the reduction in ARF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reducing the ARF would be reducing a fixed cost and\r\n\r\ntransferring it, to some extent, to the variable cost.  The  COE\r\n\r\nis  a  variable  cost and one which the consumer can  influence.\r\n\r\nThis would no doubt pose\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  problem  for the finance company.  With a larger  variable\r\n\r\ncost,  they  will have to compute carefully the  limit  for  the\r\n\r\nfinancing  of  a vehicle because the value would fall  when  COE\r\n\r\nprices fall.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in principle, ARF should be removed. It was\r\n\r\nintroduced to increase the cost of owning a vehicle.  It  is  an\r\n\r\nownership  control  mechanism to discourage  vehicle  ownership.\r\n\r\nWhen  it  failed  to  achieve  the  desired  effect,  COEs  were\r\n\r\nintroduced to cap the vehicle population and ARF was reduced  to\r\n\r\n150%.   Now  with  the introduction of ERP, the  ARF  should  be\r\n\r\nquickly reduced to 100% and eventually be removed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree that it is undesirable to suddenly remove ARF.\r\n\r\nThe  market must be given time to adjust to the change otherwise\r\n\r\nCOE  prices may swing wildly upwards.  An acceptable annual rate\r\n\r\nfor  reducing  ARF  to zero would be 25% per annum.   This  way,\r\n\r\nequilibrium  in  COE prices can be maintained  and  fluctuations\r\n\r\nwould  merely  reflect the economic outlook and  the  consumers'\r\n\r\npurchasing power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I take the next cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> Sir, a common complaint of the ordinary\r\n\r\nmotorcycle owners is that the COEs for motorcycles are much  too\r\n\r\nhigh.  A buyer of an ordinary motorcycle, 200 cc and lower,  has\r\n\r\nto  bid  high  to secure a COE because of competition  from  the\r\n\r\nbuyers of the large capacity bikes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of 1997, 76.7% of bikes have engine capacities\r\n\r\nof 200 cc and lower.  It was 81.5% at the end of 1991.  Although\r\n\r\nthe  percentage  fell by 4.8%, the numbers grew from  98,783  to\r\n\r\n100,949, an increase of 2.2%.  In contrast, at the end of  1997,\r\n\r\n23.3%  of bikes have engine capacities of above 200 cc.  It  was\r\n\r\n18.5%  at  the  end  of 1991.  The number of bikes  with  engine\r\n\r\ncapacities above 200 cc grew from 22,381 to 30,642, an  increase\r\n\r\nof  36.9%.   The biggest increase was for the very large  bikes,\r\n\r\nthose  with engine capacities above 500 cc  from 3,220 units  in\r\n\r\n1991 to 6,526 units in 1997, an increase of 102.7%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The on-the-road price of a bike with engine capacities of\r\n\r\nbelow  200 cc ranges from $5,000 to $8,000.  In fact, the  price\r\n\r\nof  a  bike  with engine capacity of below 100 cc is  less  than\r\n\r\n$5,000.   On  the other hand, the on-the-road prices of  popular\r\n\r\nlarge  bikes can go as high as $34,000.  Thus, the  buyer  of  a\r\n\r\nbike  costing less than $5,000 has to compete with a buyer of  a\r\n\r\nbike costing $34,000 for the COE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of social equity, Sir, there is a need to\r\n\r\ncreate  at  least  two  categories of  COE  for  the  buyers  of\r\n\r\nmotorcycles.  I would suggest one category for bikes with engine\r\n\r\ncapacities of 200 cc and lower, and another category  for  those\r\n\r\nbikes with engine capacities above 200 cc.  It is even desirable\r\n\r\nto consider a separate category for bikes with engine capacities\r\n\r\nof  100  cc  and  lower.   Just as it is desirable  to  maintain\r\n\r\ndifferent  categories of COEs for motorcars, it is desirable  to\r\n\r\ncreate  different categories of COEs for motorcycles.  The  same\r\n\r\nprinciple of social equity surely must apply here.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Sir, I want to urge the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider  extending the statutory lifespan of a  car  beyond  10\r\n\r\nyears  by revising the PARF scheme and also the validity  period\r\n\r\nof COEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, there is a graduated PARF benefit scheme\r\n\r\ncalculated  on the basis of percentage of the open market  value\r\n\r\nof  cars  from 80% to 130% for cars registered on or  after  1st\r\n\r\nNovember  1990.   Sir,  the PARF is an incentive  given  to  car\r\n\r\nowners to change their cars before the 10-year period.  However,\r\n\r\ngiven  the improvements in car technology since the PARF  scheme\r\n\r\nwas  introduced more than 22 years ago and the compulsory annual\r\n\r\ninspection  of  older cars, the PARF scheme can be  modified  to\r\n\r\nextend  the 10-year lifespan of a car.  New car models are  also\r\n\r\nmore  fuel efficient, the engine more robust and they break down\r\n\r\nless  frequently  than their counterparts 20  years  ago.   With\r\n\r\nregular  maintenance  and  inspection,  most  of  the  cars   on\r\n\r\nSingapore roads can be roadworthy beyond the 10-year limit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would like to propose that the Government consider\r\n\r\nextending the PARF incentive for cars from the current 10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears  to, say, 12 years.  The PARF for a car which is 11  years\r\n\r\nold can be 10% lower than those of a 10-year old car, ie, 70% of\r\n\r\nthe open market value, and a 12-year old car, 20% less, that is,\r\n\r\n60% of the OMV.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is very wasteful for a well-maintained 10-year old\r\n\r\ncar  to be scrapped just because it has become uneconomical  for\r\n\r\nthe  owner  to pay for a new COE and at the same time  lose  the\r\n\r\nresidual PARF value of the car.  Moreover, with the introduction\r\n\r\nof  ERP, motorists are likely to minimise the use of their  cars\r\n\r\nwhich is what the ERP is meant to achieve.  Relatively speaking,\r\n\r\nthese  cars are likely to be roadworthy for a longer  period  of\r\n\r\ntime.  It would therefore be appropriate to extend the statutory\r\n\r\nlifespan  of a car in Singapore to 12 years.  With the extension\r\n\r\nof  the  PARF benefits to 12 years, I think COEs should also  be\r\n\r\nvalid for 12 years with the option to extend for another five or\r\n\r\n10 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the Certificate of Entitlement (COE)\r\n\r\nis  a key component of our road management system and acts as  a\r\n\r\ncontrol mechanism on the car population.  Hence, with the recent\r\n\r\nannouncement  on  the  changes in road  tax  structure  and  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the ERP, I think an announcement  on  the  COE\r\n\r\nshould  have  been  made at the same time.  No announcement  was\r\n\r\nmade on what the COE policy would be like.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since this has not been done, I wish the Minister to\r\n\r\nalso consider making some basic changes to the COE.  We have now\r\n\r\nrationalised that a motorcycle is equivalent to half  a  car  on\r\n\r\nthe  road.   This  being the case Sir, then  all  cars  must  be\r\n\r\ntreated as the same, whether it is a large car or small capacity\r\n\r\ncar.   The  amount of road space taken up or used is  the  same.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  it  can also be argued that we do not have  different\r\n\r\nsizes of car park lots.  All car park lots are drawn in the same\r\n\r\nmanner   and  they  are  of  the  same  size.   In   fact,   the\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists  may even argue that although their motorcycle  is\r\n\r\nequivalent  to  half a car, actually in terms of parking  space,\r\n\r\none  car  park lot may be equivalent to three or four motorcycle\r\n\r\nparking lots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since cars are all the same, perhaps we should relook\r\n\r\nat  how the COE categories may be removed.  There may have  been\r\n\r\nsociological   or   political  reasons  for   having   different\r\n\r\ncategories  of  cars in the quota system.  But as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nsupply and demand, there have been occasions when in fact a  COE\r\n\r\nfor  a  small  car is higher than that of a large capacity  car.\r\n\r\nThis  rationalisation of putting all the COEs as one class, when\r\n\r\nput  in place, may mean lower COE cost.  One cannot assume  that\r\n\r\neven  those  who can afford a large car may not wish  to  own  a\r\n\r\nsmall car from the viewpoint of economy.  Presently, an affluent\r\n\r\nperson who wishes to own a small car has no choice but to  place\r\n\r\na  bid in the small car category.  If it is a wrong timing,  the\r\n\r\naberration  happens and there may be a bigger demand  for  small\r\n\r\ncars and the COE becomes more expensive than the large cars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as an intermediate measure, I like the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider  removing the categories in the COEs and make  it  only\r\n\r\none   class.   But  for  sociological  and  other  reasons  like\r\n\r\ndiscouraging  large car ownership, maybe we can have  a  premium\r\n\r\nset  for  different type of cars.  At the end of the day,  since\r\n\r\nall  cars  are equal, I think we should only have one  class  of\r\n\r\ncars in the COE.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, listening to Mr Chng\r\n\r\nHee Kok, I am surprised that we think alike.  Because I too want\r\n\r\nto  point  out  the problems with the current systems.   We  all\r\n\r\nremember  the  $50 COE and my colleague, Mr Gerard  Ee,  already\r\n\r\nsaid  it  was a freak result and, to me, it was also a fluke  of\r\n\r\nthe  system.  Based on the prevailing COE quota premium, in that\r\n\r\nparticular exercise, the loss of COE revenue was probably of the\r\n\r\norder of $15 million.  So in a way, Sir, it is like distributing\r\n\r\nthis  amount of money to the 300-odd people who were  successful\r\n\r\nin  that particular bid.  So it is like tikam tikam.  It  was  a\r\n\r\nlucky  draw for them.  It does not truly serve the system  well.\r\n\r\nAll  these years, the Government has been very careful  when  it\r\n\r\ncomes to spending public money.  Similarly, it is also true that\r\n\r\nwe  should be very careful in collecting public revenue.  So  if\r\n\r\nwe were to have a system\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat allows freak results like this to happen, I think it is not\r\n\r\na good system.  It should be reviewed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, similar to Mr Chng, after seeing the quota system\r\n\r\nbeing   in  operation  for  several  years,  there  are  several\r\n\r\npeculiarities of the COE system that I am not satisfied with.  I\r\n\r\nrefer  here  to  the successful bids of the various  categories.\r\n\r\nOne  would  expect to see that the bigger the  car,  the  higher\r\n\r\nwould  be  the  COE.   What  happens  is  that  the  incremental\r\n\r\nincrease,  as you go up to the higher category is  smaller.   At\r\n\r\ncertain  times, a COE for a large car is in fact more  expensive\r\n\r\nthan a COE for a luxury car.  I would also project that when the\r\n\r\nARF  is  reduced  from  150%  to 140%,  the  reduction  will  be\r\n\r\ntransferred to COE.  But the amount transferred will be  smaller\r\n\r\nin  the large car category and larger in the small car category.\r\n\r\nIn  that sense, it would definitely benefit the large car  users\r\n\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road tax system announced recently by the Minister\r\n\r\nembodied within it a progressivity formula.  And I would like to\r\n\r\nsee  the  same progressivity in the COE prices.  One  can  argue\r\n\r\nthat  we  cannot really control that in the current COE  system.\r\n\r\nBut  my  response  would be that perhaps the  number  of  quotas\r\n\r\nallocated  to each category is not appropriate with  respect  to\r\n\r\nthis desire to achieve progressivitiy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, the current COE system has also an\r\n\r\nelement  of built-in bias of favouring big cars and luxury  cars\r\n\r\nand,  that  is, we actually created a category called  the  Open\r\n\r\nCOEs.   And most Open COE quotas have been used to register  big\r\n\r\nand  luxury cars.  Very few, I believe, have been used for other\r\n\r\ncategories.  Probably, none for small cars.  So therefore, there\r\n\r\nis  a built-in bias in the COE system with this Open category by\r\n\r\nallowing  buyers  of luxury cars and big cars to  use  the  Open\r\n\r\ncategory to register their vehicles.  Therefore, in essence, the\r\n\r\nluxury car and big car categories have a larger number of quotas\r\n\r\nthan  what we have allocated.  In my view, it is also the reason\r\n\r\nwhy  the COE prices level off at the high end of the car market.\r\n\r\nTo overcome the shortcoming I mentioned, one proposal is what Mr\r\n\r\nChng\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  said,  to merge all the COE categories into one.   In  this\r\n\r\nway,  the  number of quotas allocated to the COE  pool  will  be\r\n\r\nlarger  and it will be very unlikely that a similar freak result\r\n\r\nlike  the  $50 COE would happen.  I think it is time for  us  to\r\n\r\nreview  the  COE system.  I would like the Minister to  consider\r\n\r\nthis suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, may I take my two amendments\r\n\r\ntogether?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, the LTA has recently opened some new\r\n\r\nflyovers   and   three-tier   road   systems   such    as    the\r\n\r\nQueensway/Farrer  Road junction and the Bukit Timah  Road/Farrer\r\n\r\nRoad  junction.  There are more to come, I believe, such as  the\r\n\r\none at the Braddell Road/Upper Serangoon Road junction.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the  Minister  to enlighten  this  House  on  the\r\n\r\nprinciples, such as cost benefit analysis, which are  considered\r\n\r\nwhen  the LTA decides on where such three-tier junctions are  to\r\n\r\nbe built, whether there will be more of these, whether they have\r\n\r\nbeen  found to be effective so far, and the respective  cost  of\r\n\r\nbuilding a flyover as against an underground vehicular  pass  or\r\n\r\ntunnel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next, I would like to speak on the deregulation of the\r\n\r\ntaxi  industry.   The Minister has announced to this House  that\r\n\r\nthe LTA will be recommending to the Public Transport Council  to\r\n\r\nderegulate  taxi fares in Singapore.  There are only three  taxi\r\n\r\noperators  in  Singapore currently.  Members of the  public  are\r\n\r\nworried  that the three operators will get together  to  form  a\r\n\r\ncartel  to  fix  prices.   If  the  prices  are  fixed   at   an\r\n\r\nunreasonably high level, commuters will suffer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I say cartel, Sir, I am also referring to the\r\n\r\nsituation where the parties may not officially be a cartel,  but\r\n\r\nwould  informally  match  each  other's  rates  in  an  unspoken\r\n\r\narrangement,  such  as  what  we suspect  is  happening  in  the\r\n\r\npetroleum  industry.  Would the LTA or PTC  be  monitoring  this\r\n\r\nsituation?   To  prevent this, it might  be  important  to  also\r\n\r\nliberalise  taxi services so that more companies can  enter  the\r\n\r\nmarket to provide competition if they so desire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, if taxi services are to be deregulated and irrespective\r\n\r\nof  whether more entrants are allowed, there must be  a  minimum\r\n\r\nservice  standard  of quality, so that free  market  competition\r\n\r\nwill not descend to unacceptable levels and tarnish the image of\r\n\r\nthe  world-class transportation system that we are building.   I\r\n\r\nwould  urge the PTC to set such quality of service standards  in\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> Sir, once again, I wish to declare my\r\n\r\ninterest as a director of the Comfort group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has announced that the LTA will be\r\n\r\nrecommending to the Public Transport Council to deregulate  taxi\r\n\r\nfares  when  the new vehicular tax structure and the  electronic\r\n\r\nroad pricing system are implemented on 1st September 1998.  This\r\n\r\nwill  allow taxi operators to set their own fares so  that  they\r\n\r\nwill better meet the requirements of the various market segments\r\n\r\nand deploy their resources to best meet the demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the deregulation, the onus of setting taxi fares\r\n\r\nrests  with the taxi operators and not the regulator, as is  the\r\n\r\ncase now.  In setting the fares, the operator would have to take\r\n\r\ninto  consideration the market conditions, the supply and demand\r\n\r\nfor  taxis,  the  cost  of providing the service  and  what  the\r\n\r\ncommuters  are  prepared  to pay.  Competition  among  the  taxi\r\n\r\noperators  would also place a lead on fare increases,  as  those\r\n\r\nwho  charge higher fares risk losing their customers.  The  fear\r\n\r\namong  the commuters is: with the deregulation, would  the  taxi\r\n\r\noperators  raise  fares  arbitrarily?  Would  operators  form  a\r\n\r\ncartel  to fix fares, and this is a point which has been  raised\r\n\r\nby Mr Iswaran and Dr Toh See Kiat?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my view is that our taxi commuters are sensitive to\r\n\r\nfare  increases.  While one cannot rule out the possibility  and\r\n\r\njustification for fare revision in the future, it is  a  fallacy\r\n\r\nto  believe  that  the taxi operators can just raise  the  fares\r\n\r\narbitrarily without due regard to the commuters' ability to pay.\r\n\r\nThe demand for taxis is price elastic.  The commuters can easily\r\n\r\nswitch to other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforms  of public transport, like buses and MRT, if they consider\r\n\r\nthe  taxi fares to be unreasonably high.  And we already  had  a\r\n\r\nprevious  experience  in the mid-80s.  In 1985,  when  the  taxi\r\n\r\nfares were raised substantially, the demand dropped drastically,\r\n\r\nas   a   result  of  which  the  taxi  drivers  suffered  badly.\r\n\r\nConsequently,  the fares had to be lowered to a  more  realistic\r\n\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In setting taxi fares, therefore, the operators cannot\r\n\r\nignore  the  market conditions.  Most of our taxi drivers  could\r\n\r\nstill  remember  the unpleasant experience  which  I  have  just\r\n\r\nmentioned.   They  themselves,  not  just  the  commuters,   are\r\n\r\napprehensive of the consequences of fare increases.  They  would\r\n\r\nrather  not  raise fares for fear of losing their  customers  if\r\n\r\ntheir  operating  cost could be contained and remain  unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe  taxi company too would rather not raise the rental rate for\r\n\r\nfear  of  losing their drivers if the costs of doing business  - the COE, ALS, financing cost and others  - do not go up.  But in\r\n\r\nreal  life,  things  do  not remain constant.   There  are  many\r\n\r\nvariables.    There  are  many economic  factors  at  play  and,\r\n\r\nfinally,  it  is  the  market forces which would  determine  the\r\n\r\nsupply and demand and price of service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With deregulation, the taxi fares would reflect more\r\n\r\naccurately the state of supply and demand.  For instance,  there\r\n\r\nis  a strong demand for taxis during peak hours.  But during off\r\n\r\npeak  hours, empty cruising of taxis is a common sight.  We  can\r\n\r\ntry  to  address  this  problem through differential  pricing  - differential pricing according to the hour of the day  and  even\r\n\r\nby day of the week.  In some of the cities in the United States,\r\n\r\neven the bus fares are discounted on Sundays in order to attract\r\n\r\nridership.   There  is  no  reason why  the  same  principle  of\r\n\r\ndifferential pricing cannot be applied here either for buses  or\r\n\r\ntaxis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deregulation would also enable the taxi operators to\r\n\r\nintroduce more differentiated and innovative service to suit the\r\n\r\nspecial  needs of the customers.  We already have  Mercedes  and\r\n\r\nLondon cabs on our roads to cater for those who are prepared  to\r\n\r\npay  more to travel in style and comfort.  One day we might have\r\n\r\nKancil and Daihatsu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaxis  to cater to the budget-conscious commuters, provided  the\r\n\r\nvehicles  meet  LTA's  conditions.   The  end  result   of   the\r\n\r\nderegulation  exercise is that we would have a  more  efficient,\r\n\r\ncompetitive and responsive taxi service which would better serve\r\n\r\nthe interest and needs of the commuting public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the deregulation exercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the taxi service\r\n\r\nhas  improved considerably, when we compare to the taxi  service\r\n\r\nof  the  60s  and when pirate taxis were a feature in Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  have  come a long way.  But, unfortunately, during the  peak\r\n\r\nperiods, it is difficult to get a taxi, unless we book  one.   I\r\n\r\nthink  the Government has to think of ways and means to minimise\r\n\r\nthis problem, because it costs $3.20 to book a taxi and not many\r\n\r\npeople  in Singapore  I am not speaking of all of us  can afford\r\n\r\nthis and so they have to queue for a taxi.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should also improve the training for taxi drivers.\r\n\r\nThey  are the first people the tourists meet.  They should  know\r\n\r\nsome  basic  facts  about  Singapore.  They  should  be  smartly\r\n\r\ndressed  and  perhaps they should be persuaded  not  to  grumble\r\n\r\nabout Singapore's ills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the SZ cars. I am glad that the tax for\r\n\r\nSZ  cars  is  being  revised.  I would urge  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nconsider  other  means by which it would be economical  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  to use SZ cars.   As a matter of fact, the other  day  I\r\n\r\nmet  a professional who is actually driving an SZ car on a long-term  basis.   In  order to support the SZ  car  companies,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must look at the contribution that this group  would\r\n\r\nmake  in minimising congestion on our roads.  While doing so,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not want to give the impression that the market force has to\r\n\r\nbe  abandoned  .   But sometimes, the market  force  has  to  be\r\n\r\nmanipulated  in  order to serve the community better,  and  this\r\n\r\nwould  be  one  way.  I hope the Government  would  not  be  too\r\n\r\northodox in its approach and see wherever they could help the SZ\r\n\r\ncar industry to grow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing that I would like to applaud the Government\r\n\r\nis the move to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupport the car cooperative.   This is something which we should\r\n\r\nencourage    and,    wherever   possible,   with    Government's\r\n\r\nencouragement and help,  this scheme will help us in  minimising\r\n\r\ncar ownership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take my other cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, we cannot run away from the fact\r\n\r\nthat   we   are  a  small  city  state.   The  land   for   road\r\n\r\ntransportation  is  limited.  The matter is further  complicated\r\n\r\nbecause  we have a built-up city.  The public has to acknowledge\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government has spent huge sums of money in  improving\r\n\r\nour roads and the land transportation system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know I am going to be a voice in the wilderness,\r\n\r\nbecause everybody who has spoken before me, has been asking  for\r\n\r\ncar ownership to grow, but I am going to speak against it.  Sir,\r\n\r\nI am going to be a minority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most young Singaporeans aspire to own a car. There is\r\n\r\nnothing wrong in their dreams, but we have to be realistic.   If\r\n\r\nevery  graduate decides to own a car within the first two  years\r\n\r\nof  his  working  career, our roads will be  clogged.   It  will\r\n\r\naffect our economic life.  We will be like the other cities  and\r\n\r\nI do not think we want to do that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometimes I think the Government is trying to please\r\n\r\nthe car owners more than the public transport commuters who are,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  the  majority of the taxpayers.   May  I  urge  young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to save their money initially and put  their  money\r\n\r\nin  other forms of investment, and postpone the buying of a  car\r\n\r\nto  a  later stage.  On the other hand, those families with two,\r\n\r\nthree  or even four cars should think of minimising, or at least\r\n\r\ngive up one car.  I know it is a difficult proposition.  Some of\r\n\r\nus  may be affected.  But in the interest of the motorcar-owning\r\n\r\nclass, I think we may have to consider the proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I relate an anecdote, Sir. I know of a friend who,\r\n\r\ninstead of buying a car, bought a terrace house and he was  very\r\n\r\nfortunate.   He upgraded and he now owns a bungalow  in  a  good\r\n\r\nlocation and it  is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow  worth a few million dollars.  Now, he has a car.  Since  he\r\n\r\nhas  a  very  big  family, he has SZ cars as  well.   I  am  not\r\n\r\nsuggesting  that  all  those who save could become  millionaires\r\n\r\novernight.  But I am saying that they should get their  priority\r\n\r\nright.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other thing I am going to suggest is rather\r\n\r\nradical.   I have suggested it to a Select Committee  and  I  am\r\n\r\ngoing  to suggest it again.  I think that each car owner  should\r\n\r\nbe  made  to  pay  a levy of $50.  Of course,  they  should  get\r\n\r\nsomething  in return.   They could be given a free ride  on  the\r\n\r\nMRT  and buses.  This is only for the car owners but not members\r\n\r\nof  their  family.  In this way, I think they will  be persuaded\r\n\r\nto  use  the buses and taxis more often, because they know  they\r\n\r\nare  going  to pay $50.  And if they do not use it,  of  course,\r\n\r\nthey  lose the benefit of a free MRT ride.  It is a very radical\r\n\r\nsuggestion but I want the Minister to give some consideration to\r\n\r\nmy suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have got another cut. I wonder whether you would\r\n\r\nallow me to take it now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We will give other Members a chance. Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, my\r\n\r\nsubject  is,  of  course, the problem which  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nattempting to tackle through electronic road pricing  and  other\r\n\r\nmeasures.   The problem of keeping our roads from being  clogged\r\n\r\nup  which results in a loss of hours which may be put to  better\r\n\r\nuse.   No one disputes that we should do whatever we can to keep\r\n\r\nour  roads unclogged.  The question is: how do we do this?   The\r\n\r\nsimplest  thing  is to ban every car off the  road  for  certain\r\n\r\nperiods of time.  The second thing is perhaps, which is what the\r\n\r\nGovernment seems to be favouring, to raise the price for the use\r\n\r\nof the road.  This is a monetarist policy.  But this policy does\r\n\r\nnot take into account, as I have tried to say earlier last week,\r\n\r\nthose who have to use the car not just to get to work and home\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  who  have  to use the car or the motorcycle to  earn  their\r\n\r\nlivelihood.   And if you are going to tax them every  time  they\r\n\r\nuse the road, then it would mean a lessening of their income,  a\r\n\r\ngreater increase in their expense, and so they suffer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, those who do not really need to use the\r\n\r\ncar  or  to  use that part of the road with their cars,  because\r\n\r\nthey have the necessary means, ie, the money to pay for it, have\r\n\r\nfree  access to that road or stretch.  This is why my Party says\r\n\r\nthe  arrangements are discriminatory.  Like most  PAP  policies,\r\n\r\nthey tend to favour the rich and the privileged and they do  not\r\n\r\ntake  into account the needs of those who need to use  the  road\r\n\r\nand  who are perhaps not that well-off to afford the charges and\r\n\r\nfees that are being imposed for the use of the road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is time that the Ministry considered other\r\n\r\nsolutions, non-monetary solutions, to this problem.   Have  they\r\n\r\nat  all considered taking a census of people who need to use the\r\n\r\nroad for their livelihood, as I keep saying, the tradesman,  the\r\n\r\ndoctor,  or  others who need to use the cars or the motorcycles,\r\n\r\nand  those who just use the car to drive to work in the town and\r\n\r\nthen leave it there, and then drive back?  Is it not possible to\r\n\r\ncategorise  the  users into \"essential users\" and \"non-essential\r\n\r\nusers\"?   And then restrict the use of that road to  those  non-essential  users  for  some period of the  day,  and  allow  the\r\n\r\nessential users the unrestricted use of that road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was in Johor during the Japanese military\r\n\r\noccupation.   And  when they had this problem, not  because  the\r\n\r\nroads  were  clogged  but because they  were  running  short  of\r\n\r\npetrol,  they  did  not resort to a monetarist  policy  of  just\r\n\r\ncharging  people  more  and more for  use  of  the  road.   They\r\n\r\ncategorised  users into \"essential\" and \"non-essential\".   Those\r\n\r\nwho  needed  to use their cars and motorcycles were given  black\r\n\r\nlabels  and they could use the car at all times.  Those who  did\r\n\r\nnot  really need the car for the livelihood but only  wanted  to\r\n\r\nget to the market or to send their children to school or get  to\r\n\r\nwork,  they  were given red labels, which meant that they  could\r\n\r\nuse the car for two hours in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmorning and two hours in the evening.  For the rest of the  day,\r\n\r\nthey  were  kept off the roads.  And in that way, they  achieved\r\n\r\nwhat they wanted - lesser use of the petrol.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would ask the Ministry whether they would consider non-monetary solutions to this problem and not just pick one which\r\n\r\nis  the  easiest, and that is, to raise the prices so  that  you\r\n\r\ndiscriminate  against those who are unable  to  pay  and  favour\r\n\r\nthose who are able to pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before I finish, may I also point out what would appear\r\n\r\nto be some incongruities.  The Minister was saying the other day\r\n\r\nthat  now  with the introduction of the ERP, the Government  can\r\n\r\nissue  more COEs.  In other words, he says the Government  would\r\n\r\nbe  quite happy to see more cars on the roads used by people who\r\n\r\nare able to pay for this and can also pay for the COE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I do not understand why it is necessary to\r\n\r\nsubject the taxi drivers and the taxi owners to paying the heavy\r\n\r\ndiesel tax and the other ERP charges and what-not, for using the\r\n\r\nroads.   They  are  public  service  vehicles  and  surely   the\r\n\r\nobjective must be to encourage people to use the public  service\r\n\r\nvehicles rather than their own cars.  They can only do  that  if\r\n\r\nyou  bring  down the cost of the public service transport.   And\r\n\r\nyou  do  not do that, if you pile on the taxi drivers all  these\r\n\r\ncharges,  heavy diesel tax charge, and then the  ERP  and  other\r\n\r\ncharges.   So  would the Ministry please give  some  thought  to\r\n\r\nother solutions to this problem?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

We\r\n\r\nhad  two  objectives  in mind.  One, was  to  achieve  a  better\r\n\r\nownership  between ownership and usage in managing our  traffic,\r\n\r\nin  better controlling traffic congestion; and, two, was to have\r\n\r\na fairer, a more rational and a more consistent basis for taxing\r\n\r\nvehicles on the road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new vehicle tax structure announced last week on 4th\r\n\r\nMarch should not be seen in isolation.  It has to be taken as  a\r\n\r\ntotal  package,  in  other words, taken together  with  the  ERP\r\n\r\nimplementation plan as well as the package of road tax  rebates.\r\n\r\nJust to give a very quick summary and the bottom line of the new\r\n\r\ntax  package,  a  majority or 70% of vehicle owners,  especially\r\n\r\ncompanies and businesses, will benefit from savings in road tax.\r\n\r\nThe  remaining 30% will see an increase in their road tax mainly\r\n\r\nbecause they have been paying a disproportionately low road  tax\r\n\r\nrelative to other vehicles when you consider the amount of  road\r\n\r\nspace they use or the amount of wear and tear they cause on  our\r\n\r\nroads.   However, to help them adjust, the Government has phased\r\n\r\nin the road tax increase over three years.  We should take it as\r\n\r\na  total package, ie, the new tax structure, the phasing in  and\r\n\r\nalso  the road tax rebates which all vehicle owners will  enjoy.\r\n\r\nMany of these vehicle owners, especially motorcyclists, will end\r\n\r\nup paying lower or no road tax in the next few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reactions to the new tax structure have been generally\r\n\r\npositive and I would like to take this opportunity to express my\r\n\r\nappreciation  to  all those who have given  their  comments  and\r\n\r\nfeedback in the consultation exercise that my Ministry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconducted  last  year.  I would also like to thank  Members  for\r\n\r\ntheir  support  of  the new vehicle tax structure  and  the  ERP\r\n\r\nimplementation plan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been a few dissenting voices on the ERP which I\r\n\r\nwould  like to deal with before I address the specific  concerns\r\n\r\nthat were raised by Members.  Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam, in particular,\r\n\r\nquestioned the principle of charging for road usage.   He  asked\r\n\r\nwhether it is fair to charge for the use of the roads.  For many\r\n\r\nyears,  most  countries, if not all countries, operated  on  the\r\n\r\nprinciple that all motorists just need to pay a lump sum for the\r\n\r\nuse  of  the  roads and thereafter, the use of  roads  would  be\r\n\r\nvirtually free.  So irrespective of how many times they drove or\r\n\r\nhow  much  congestion or how much pollution  they  cause,  there\r\n\r\nwould be no incremental cost involved in using the roads.   This\r\n\r\nwas  well  and good, until more and more people wanted  to  also\r\n\r\nenjoy this free usage, and as more and more people wanted to use\r\n\r\nthese  same  roads at the same time, the roads became  more  and\r\n\r\nmore congested.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The classic solution for many countries then was to build\r\n\r\nmore  roads,  ie,  not enough roads, roads are being  congested,\r\n\r\njust  build  some more.  If there is not enough land,  you  just\r\n\r\nbuild  over,  double-decker and triple-decker roads.   But  many\r\n\r\ncities  are finding out today that their citizens are no  longer\r\n\r\nprepared  to have the road builders come along and rip up  their\r\n\r\ncountry  side or to see their cityscape destroyed by  all  these\r\n\r\nugly  concrete flyovers all over the place, and having all these\r\n\r\ncars polluting the country side or the city that they are living\r\n\r\nin.  Why suffer all this in order to allow motorists to come and\r\n\r\ndrive on the roads and pollute the environment?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reality today is that people are now coming around\r\n\r\nto  the  idea that road space is a scarce resource, as scarce  a\r\n\r\nresource  like water, oil, or any other commodity  which  is  in\r\n\r\nshort supply.  So when Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam said that he does  not\r\n\r\noppose the idea of unclogging our roads, that it is a good idea,\r\n\r\nI was very happy to hear that because I think it is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfirst  time  that  he  has  accepted that  roads  are  a  scarce\r\n\r\nresource.  So now we are getting somewhere in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he does not favour the idea of charging. He says that\r\n\r\nif  we charge for this road usage, this scarce resource, we  are\r\n\r\nbeing  unfair.   He prefers to ration.  He prefers  to  allocate\r\n\r\nthis  scarce  resource by fiat.  He decides, or  the  Government\r\n\r\ndecides,  or the civil servant decides who gets to use the  road\r\n\r\nand  who does not - black labels, red labels, no label, I guess,\r\n\r\nthat  would be the third category.  So who gets the black label?\r\n\r\nWho  gets the red label?  It reminds me of some brand of whisky.\r\n\r\nBut  who  are  we to decide who is more deserving of  using  the\r\n\r\nroad?  The  housewife  who is driving a  child  to  school,  the\r\n\r\nbusinessman who needs a car to attend an important meeting,  the\r\n\r\nsalesman   who  has  to  take  the  car  around  to  drive   for\r\n\r\nappointments?   Mr  Jeyaretnam  says  salesmen,   black   label;\r\n\r\ndoctors, black label; housewife with kids, red label; those  who\r\n\r\ngo to work, no label, because you have no right to be driving to\r\n\r\nwork.  I must say I sympathise with that point of view.  But who\r\n\r\nare we to decide or to tell people that you cannot drive to work\r\n\r\nand  that if you use your car just to drive to work, you get  no\r\n\r\nlabel?   Is it not better for us to give the choice back to  the\r\n\r\nmotorist to let him decide what he wants to do through a  system\r\n\r\nof  charging a  fair price for the use of the roads?  Is it  not\r\n\r\nbetter for us to reduce the upfront cost of owning a vehicle, as\r\n\r\nwe  have done with the road tax rationalisation, to give back to\r\n\r\nthe  motorist a certain sum of money, not an inconsiderable  sum\r\n\r\nof  money,  and  then  to let the motorist  decide  for  himself\r\n\r\nwhether he wants to give this money back to the LTA?\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many cities are coming around to this harsh reality that,\r\n\r\nfirst  of  all,  road space is a scarce resource and,  secondly,\r\n\r\nthat  the  best  way of allocating this scarce  resource  is  to\r\n\r\ncharge  a  certain  price for using it, like  any  other  scarce\r\n\r\nresource, whether it is water, land, oil, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we faced up to this harsh reality many years\r\n\r\nago when we introduced road pricing in 1975, when we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintroduced the Area Licensing Scheme.  At that time, the CBD was\r\n\r\nbecoming  congested.  There were only so many  roads  you  could\r\n\r\nbuild  in  the  CBD and yet there were more jobs  in  the  city.\r\n\r\nThere  were  more people wanting to drive into the  CBD.   There\r\n\r\nwere more offices, more meetings being held, more people wanting\r\n\r\nto drive their vehicles in.  What do we do?  We charge $3 if you\r\n\r\nwant  to  drive in.  If you have no business to be in there,  do\r\n\r\nnot  pay  the  $3.  That is one car less.  And the motorist  who\r\n\r\npays  the $3 suddenly realises, \"Hey, I've got a little bit more\r\n\r\nspace to move.  My car moves a little bit faster.  I get to that\r\n\r\nmeeting  a little bit earlier.  I save time.\"  And surely  to  a\r\n\r\nbusinessman, time means money.  So at the end of the day, the $3\r\n\r\nthat  he spends is more than recovered by the amount of time  he\r\n\r\nhas saved, by the amount of hassle he has forgone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have only so much land. There are so many competing\r\n\r\nuses for our land.  We have to make optimal use of our land  for\r\n\r\nhousing,  for  catchment areas, for factories, for  playgrounds,\r\n\r\nfor  schools, etc.  And among these competing uses, we  have  to\r\n\r\nbuild roads.  Today, we already have 12% of our land devoted  to\r\n\r\nroads.   How much more land should we give up in order to  build\r\n\r\nroads?  We cannot be building more roads.  So we manage the  use\r\n\r\nof  existing road space.  We encourage people not to  use  their\r\n\r\ncars  if they do not really need to.  But how do we define need?\r\n\r\nWho  are  we  to  say that your need is greater  than  the  next\r\n\r\nperson's  need?   We  do not wish to define that.   We  let  the\r\n\r\nmotorist decide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we make better use of the land set aside for roads?\r\n\r\nWe  give  priority to buses.  Why?  Because buses make the  most\r\n\r\neffective  use of road space.  And Mr Rai is absolutely  correct\r\n\r\nand  I  am  glad  that, although he is in the minority,  he  has\r\n\r\nspoken up for the bus commuters, because this is also the reason\r\n\r\nwhy we are introducing ERP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We introduce ERP to encourage people to use our roads\r\n\r\nwisely.  We say that pricing is the most efficient mechanism  to\r\n\r\nallocate  this  scarce resource.  At the  end  of  the  day,  we\r\n\r\ncollect revenue from people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nusing  this scarce resource.  Mr Low Thia Khiang says that  this\r\n\r\nis  a  revenue  collecting mechanism.   Yes,  it  is  a  revenue\r\n\r\ncollecting mechanism, and I am not ashamed to say that it  is  a\r\n\r\nrevenue  collecting  mechanism.  But what do  we  do  with  this\r\n\r\nmoney?  When we collect the revenues from people who voluntarily\r\n\r\ndecide  to  use  the  roads, we take the  money,  which  is  the\r\n\r\nproperty of all Singaporeans, and we put it to good use, whether\r\n\r\nit is for public transport infrastructure, education or housing.\r\n\r\nIt  goes  into consolidated revenue which is then used  for  the\r\n\r\npublic good.  And what is wrong with that?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam then suggests that ERP is unfair because it\r\n\r\nonly  affects  the  poor, while the rich will  not  be  affected\r\n\r\nbecause they can afford to pay.  Has he not forgotten something?\r\n\r\nMost  Singaporeans do not drive to work.  They take the bus  and\r\n\r\nthe MRT.  They will not be affected by the ERP.  And, indeed, if\r\n\r\nwe  can  make the roads clearer for the buses, then surely  that\r\n\r\nmust  be welcomed by bus commuters if they can actually  get  to\r\n\r\nwork  on  time and get to work faster.  So, rather  than  saying\r\n\r\nthat the ERP is actually discriminating against the poor, he has\r\n\r\nforgotten that actually there is a very large group of people in\r\n\r\nSingapore  who  will  be  benefiting,  directly  through  faster\r\n\r\ntravel,  and  indirectly through the  revenues that  we  collect\r\n\r\nfrom ERP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr Chiam See Tong made the comment\r\n\r\nthat  ERP  is a revenue collecting mechanism.  I have  addressed\r\n\r\nthat point earlier. Mr  Chiam further asked whether COEs will be\r\n\r\nscrapped  as a result of the ERP.  Mr Low has already given  him\r\n\r\nthe reply, right answer but wrong working.  I think he gets half\r\n\r\nmark  for that.  The right answer is that we cannot scrap  COEs.\r\n\r\nWe have to keep COEs, at the same time that we have to introduce\r\n\r\nERP, because the two must go hand in hand.  If we just carry  on\r\n\r\nwith COEs, we end up in a situation where it is very inflexible.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot  continue to keep adding COEs.  We  are  now  talking\r\n\r\nabout a 3% increase every year.  Our land does not expand by  3%\r\n\r\nevery  year ad infinitum.  At which point in time do we have  to\r\n\r\nstart to scale back on COEs?  20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears'  time, 30 years' time, if we were to depend on just  this\r\n\r\nmechanism alone? But if we also have in tandem a mechanism which\r\n\r\nregulates the usage of roads, which encourages people to use the\r\n\r\nroads  more judiciously and if we put the two together, then  we\r\n\r\nhave  two  very  powerful  levers to allow  us  to  manage  road\r\n\r\ncongestion  but,  at  the  same time, to  allow  for  a  regular\r\n\r\nincrease in the number of vehicles on the roads, which  is  part\r\n\r\nand parcel of managing aspirations, managing people's desire  to\r\n\r\nown  cars.  No, we cannot have ERP alone, we cannot scrap  COEs,\r\n\r\nbut neither can we have COEs alone without the ERP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it a revenue collecting mechanism? I say, yes. But we\r\n\r\ndo it in a way that  gives the motorists the choice whether they\r\n\r\nwant  to  pay that fee for using the roads or not.  The  upfront\r\n\r\ntaxes have already been reduced, slashed in some cases.  The ERP\r\n\r\nrevenue  is an estimate.  If the system is successful, there  is\r\n\r\nreally  no reason why we should be collecting more revenue  than\r\n\r\nwhat we are collecting today.  On that basis, we have decided to\r\n\r\nmake  those  tax  changes on a revenue neutral  basis  today  by\r\n\r\ngiving  rebates,  by reducing taxes.  The tax reductions  alone,\r\n\r\nincluding  the estimate of increased ERP revenue over  the  next\r\n\r\nfive  years, is going to cost the Government something like $1.2\r\n\r\nbillion, over five years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens after five years, Mr Low asked. The rebates\r\n\r\nwill  run  out.   By that time, people would have  had  time  to\r\n\r\nadjust to the new ERP infrastructure.  And in five years'  time,\r\n\r\nif  people  continue  to drive as they do today,  if  businesses\r\n\r\ncontinue to operate as they do today, in spite of the fact  that\r\n\r\nnow they will be charged for the use of the roads, that now they\r\n\r\nare going to be charged per pass, I would be very surprised.   I\r\n\r\nexpect that there will be changes and, in fact, this is what  we\r\n\r\nhope will be achieved when we introduce the ERP, that we hope to\r\n\r\nchange  people's  driving  habits.  And  if  motorists'  driving\r\n\r\nhabits are changed in such a way that they do not have to pay so\r\n\r\nmuch  for ERP, so be it.  That is the purpose of the ERP system.\r\n\r\nIf  they decide that they are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngoing to drive irrespective of ERP charges, then we will collect\r\n\r\nthe revenue, because the motorist willingly has decided that  he\r\n\r\nis going to pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will the revenue situation be like five years from now?\r\n\r\nI  do not know.  All I know is that we have a mechanism in place\r\n\r\nwhich  puts  the  responsibility firmly  in  the  hands  of  the\r\n\r\nmotoring  public.  And that, I think, is a fairer way  of  doing\r\n\r\nthings.  It  is  more  rational  and,  I  believe,  it  is  more\r\n\r\neffective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I turn now to some of the specific concerns of\r\n\r\nMembers.  Mr Chay expressed some concern that motorcyclists  are\r\n\r\npaying high ERP charges than taxis, and he felt that it was  not\r\n\r\nfair.  Dr Michael Lim also suggested that we should consider low\r\n\r\nERP  charges for those who use the roads more frequently.   Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  principle  of shifting upfront cost to the  usage  cost  is\r\n\r\nreally  one of the fundamental principles of the ERP  policy  or\r\n\r\nstrategy  to  manage  demand for road space.   Why?   Because  a\r\n\r\nvehicle  owner  who  has paid a lot of  money  for  his  car  or\r\n\r\nmotorbike and pays very little or nothing for its use would have\r\n\r\nvery  little incentive to cut down on usage.  So this is why  in\r\n\r\nthe  new tax structure, we have reduced upfront taxes.  We  have\r\n\r\ncut  registration fee.  We have cut ARF and we have shifted more\r\n\r\nof the cost to usage, mainly through the ERP charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERP is a pay per pass system. The more you use, the\r\n\r\nmore  you  pay.    It  is  fairer and it is  more  effective  in\r\n\r\nencouraging road users to cut down on their usage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on this basis, it is not possible to accede to Dr\r\n\r\nMichael Lim's suggestion that we levy a lower fee on those  who,\r\n\r\nfor  one  reason or another, need to use the roads  more  often.\r\n\r\nThis is not fair to those who do not use the roads more often or\r\n\r\nwho have managed to change their pattern in such a way that they\r\n\r\ndo  not  use  the  roads more often.  If we did that,  it  would\r\n\r\ndefeat  the  purpose of the ERP.  However, as Members  would  be\r\n\r\nwell aware, we have recognised that this is a  sudden change  in\r\n\r\nthe  system.  To the heavy users, it will come as a very  sudden\r\n\r\nshock. To accommodate that, we have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecided  that  we will phase in the changes over three  or  four\r\n\r\nyears for taxis and commercial vehicles.  And this is the reason\r\n\r\nwhy  Mr Chay observed that motorcycles will be paying lower  ERP\r\n\r\ncharges than taxis, because we are phasing in taxi charges  over\r\n\r\nthree  years.   Of course, this only applies in  the  first  few\r\n\r\nyears.   However, when the phasing-in period is over, ERP  rates\r\n\r\nfor taxis will be exactly the same as for private cars, by which\r\n\r\ntime his concern is no longer valid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok made some suggestions on road pricing.\r\n\r\nYes,  we  decided  to introduce the concept of shoulder  pricing\r\n\r\nbecause  of  this  phenomenon of \"peak within  the  peak\"  where\r\n\r\neverybody tries to jam into that particular stretch of  road  at\r\n\r\nthat  particular time.  So we have decided that we will try  and\r\n\r\nspread  out  that  peak  load by levying lower  charges  in  the\r\n\r\nshoulder periods.  However, \"shoulder\" pricing is a new concept,\r\n\r\nand  I  think we should start off with a more simple  structure.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  have decided to have a peak  price,  a  shoulder\r\n\r\nprice  and  an off-peak price.  It is a little bit  discreet,  I\r\n\r\nagree.   But  let us try the simple structure first and,  if  it\r\n\r\nworks, we will extend it to other congestion points, and we will\r\n\r\nalso  look  at  varying the pricing to suit the traffic  pattern\r\n\r\nmore accurately, as suggested by Mr Chng.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng has some comments on gantries. Very quickly, I\r\n\r\njust  wish  to  clarify that there are two  gantries.   Separate\r\n\r\ngantries for CBD and ERP are only a temporary problem.  Come 1st\r\n\r\nSeptember, there will only be one gantry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Location of gantries - Dr Michael Lim suggested that we\r\n\r\nreview  the  locations  of gantries so that  motorists  are  not\r\n\r\ncharged  unnecessarily.  Yes, I agree.  With the present system,\r\n\r\nwe  already have some problems like that.  So, with ERP, we will\r\n\r\ntake  the opportunity to review.  But at the end of the  day,  I\r\n\r\nwould  advise  all motorists to continue to plan their  journeys\r\n\r\nwell in advance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran had a few queries about flexibility. We will be\r\n\r\nflexible, in terms of implementation and enforcement.  But we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhope  that  motorists will take the time and effort  to  get  to\r\n\r\nunderstand the system, to use it and to be familiar with it,  so\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  very little user-related  problems,  come  1st\r\n\r\nApril.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about EMAS, what is EMAS. Basically, it is an\r\n\r\nearly warning system, to put it very clearly.  I am not familiar\r\n\r\nwith the MINDEF jargon, but I can assure him that it is an early\r\n\r\nwarning system, just like MINDEF has early warning systems,  and\r\n\r\nequally  useful for motorists once they get used to  it.   There\r\n\r\nhas  been  a  rather  protracted period  of  testing  which  has\r\n\r\nconfused  some people and attracted some rather snide  comments.\r\n\r\nBut I would like to suggest that we give it a try when it starts\r\n\r\nand, if it works as well as planners feel, I think it will be  a\r\n\r\ngreat  boon  to motorists.  Incidentally, this is not  something\r\n\r\nnew.   Such  systems are well accepted in Europe and Japan.   If\r\n\r\nyou travel on highways in Japan, for example, you will see these\r\n\r\nnumbers on the expressways which give you times.  Those are  the\r\n\r\ntimes  which  tell  you how much congestion  there  is  on  that\r\n\r\nstretch of highway.  So 50 minutes mean that you expect to reach\r\n\r\nthe  next junction in 50 minutes; please, if you can, avoid that\r\n\r\njunction.  That is basically what those signs mean.  But,  as  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  it  is  something new, give it a try,  and  you  will  be\r\n\r\npleasantly surprised at how useful it can be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh See Kiat expressed concern about safety and\r\n\r\nreliability of the IU.  I understand his concern because I think\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  matter  which  concerns  every  motorist,  and  for\r\n\r\nmotorists to see a foreign object staring at him in the face  in\r\n\r\nthe  car can be rather unnerving.  But I have the assurance from\r\n\r\nthe  consortium which has tendered and is supplying the IU.   It\r\n\r\nis  an  international  consortium (Philips,  Mitsubishi,  Mitsui\r\n\r\nElectronics,  CEI  Systems  in Singapore)  and  they  have  been\r\n\r\nawarded   the   contract.   We  have   drawn   up   very   rigid\r\n\r\nspecifications  for them to carry out very rigorous  tests.   In\r\n\r\nfact, the testing in the laboratory and the testing in the field\r\n\r\ntook  something  like 18 months, longer than most  new  products\r\n\r\nwhich  go to market.  We had to be more than careful.  We  could\r\n\r\nhave  done the acceptance tests in a much shorter time.  But  we\r\n\r\nwere dealing with 680,000 vehicles\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthroughout  Singapore  and we wanted this  system  to  last,  we\r\n\r\nwanted  the reliability of the system to be as high as possible,\r\n\r\nand we could not take chances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the reason why the testing took longer than usual.\r\n\r\nIt  is another reason why it cannot be miniaturised.  The answer\r\n\r\nis  that testing started off 18 months ago and during that time,\r\n\r\nmany  things had happened.  But the suppliers assure us that  it\r\n\r\nis  safe.   They have consulted, as far as they can, with  motor\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  on  where it should be located.   The  installers\r\n\r\nhave also been trained to install it in such a way that the unit\r\n\r\nwould not be dislodged.  All in all, I think we have to take the\r\n\r\nresults  of the tests as reliable and we will implement it  come\r\n\r\n1st  April, with the assurances that it will be safe and it will\r\n\r\nbe reliable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I will take Dr Toh's suggestion to put some of these\r\n\r\ndetails in the LTA Webpage, the Internet Website, eg, the  FAQs,\r\n\r\nas  he  called  it,  on the IU and the ERP systems.   If  he  is\r\n\r\ninterested,  the  website address is \"www.lta.gov.sg\".   If  you\r\n\r\ncannot  access that one, you can also go through the AA  website\r\n\r\nwhich  is \"www.aas.com.sg\", and this is hyperlinked to  the  LTA\r\n\r\nwebsite.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were other concerns raised by Mr Sinnakaruppan. He\r\n\r\nis  suggesting that we use other forms of payment for ERP,  like\r\n\r\nNETS,  cash,  and  credit card.   When  we  first  drew  up  the\r\n\r\nspecifications,  we had to decide whether we  wanted  to  use  a\r\n\r\npassive  system,  in other words, a centralised  billing  system\r\n\r\nwhereby   we  will  send  you  a  bill  every  month,   and   Mr\r\n\r\nSinnakaruppan would go and check his bill and see where  he  has\r\n\r\nbeen for the last month, and he would decide whether the bill is\r\n\r\ncorrect or not.  That was one option.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other option was an active system, a smart card based\r\n\r\nsystem where you get deduction every time you pass through.   No\r\n\r\nrecord  is  kept,  no  bills are sent to your  house.   We  have\r\n\r\ndecided  to  go  for the smart card system for several  reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst  of  all,  in  this  way  we do  not  need  a  centralised\r\n\r\naccounting and billing system,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich is a very costly and very massive exercise.  Secondly,  by\r\n\r\ncharging per pass, the moment you pass through a point and  hear\r\n\r\na  beep,  and you realise that your cash card balance  has  gone\r\n\r\ndown  by  X  dollars, you become more conscious of the  cost  of\r\n\r\nmotoring.   You become more conscious of the fact that  you  are\r\n\r\nactually passing through an ERP control point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, by using smart cards, we can also help to move\r\n\r\ntowards a cashless society.  Smart cards are an important way of\r\n\r\ncommercial transactions.  They can become more important  if  we\r\n\r\ncan  encourage more people to use it.  I believe  that  the  ERP\r\n\r\nwill  provide one of these \"killer\" applications, as  they  call\r\n\r\nit, for smart cards in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, last but not least, there is a question of\r\n\r\nprivacy that I alluded to you earlier.  Privacy is an issue  for\r\n\r\nsome  motorists.  In fact, I believe Mr Sinnakaruppan  may  have\r\n\r\nunderstated the concerns of motorists about privacy.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nconcern.   If  you  recall, when Hong Kong was  looking  at  the\r\n\r\nelectronic  road  pricing system some years  back,  one  of  the\r\n\r\nreasons  why  they  dropped it was because of  this  concern  of\r\n\r\nprivacy.   And  at that time the only system available  was  the\r\n\r\ncentralised billing system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would not rule out this concern about privacy. But\r\n\r\nthat  is  not the major reason why we chose the Cashcard system.\r\n\r\nAs  I  said,  there were many other reasons.  Nevertheless,  his\r\n\r\nsuggestion is a valid one because if we can do it, it does  help\r\n\r\nto  make  the  system more convenient.  It  is  a  direct  debit\r\n\r\nsystem.   It  is almost a Giro system.  It is like  the  transit\r\n\r\nlink  card  system where you do not have to top up your  transit\r\n\r\nlink  card.  Every time it falls below a certain balance, as  it\r\n\r\ngoes  through the MRT turnstiles, it automatically tops  up  for\r\n\r\nyou.   So it is possible to be done.  It is convenient.  And  we\r\n\r\nwill look into that.  But, again, considering the complexity  of\r\n\r\nthe  system as it is today, I would like to take it step-by-step\r\n\r\nand see whether the system works first.  And then later on, once\r\n\r\nmotorists are more familiar with the system and are more assured\r\n\r\nof the reliability, safety and effectiveness of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  system, then we can consider further refinements,  such  as\r\n\r\nthose suggested by Mr Sinnakaruppan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Choon Kang suggested that the statutory lifespan of\r\n\r\ncars   be   extended   to  12  years  and  the   PARF   benefits\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly.  Sir, just let me point out that  private  cars\r\n\r\ndo  not have a statutory lifespan.  In other words, you can keep\r\n\r\nyour private car for as long as you want, so long as you pay the\r\n\r\nrequisite taxes and so long as you pay the COE when it  expires.\r\n\r\nSo  you  can keep your car indefinitely, unlike taxis where  you\r\n\r\nhave to scrap the taxi after seven years, unlike buses where you\r\n\r\nhave to scrap it after 15 years now, unlike rental cars, tuition\r\n\r\ncars,  and so on.  Private cars have no statutory lifespan.   So\r\n\r\nthe  question of extending the statutory lifespan does not apply\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, you can introduce an extended PARF scheme. But here I\r\n\r\nwould  be  cautious because what we have tried to  do  with  our\r\n\r\nvehicle  population is to try and keep it  young.   We  have  an\r\n\r\naging  population problem with cars too, because the age of  the\r\n\r\ncar  population is actually getting older and older every  year.\r\n\r\nAnd  today, about 25% of our cars on the road, one in four  cars\r\n\r\non  the road, is more than 10 years old.  So if we were to relax\r\n\r\non this policy, I think we will see a much greater proliferation\r\n\r\nof  old  cars.  And no matter how you look at it, no matter  how\r\n\r\nwell  you  keep  your  car, there is no  doubt  that,  generally\r\n\r\nspeaking,  older  cars  are  more likely  to  break  down.   Our\r\n\r\nstatistics  at the LTA inspection centres show that.   The  AA's\r\n\r\nstatistics  on  breakdowns on the roads show that.   There  will\r\n\r\nalways be exceptions.  Many people can keep their old cars very,\r\n\r\nvery  well.  But the exceptions do not prove the rule.  The rule\r\n\r\nis that generally old cars tend to break down more often.  So  I\r\n\r\nwould hesitate to tinker with this policy because I think it has\r\n\r\nserved us well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, extension of COEs. First of all, we want to\r\n\r\nkeep the population young.  But I just want to highlight that if\r\n\r\nyou  extend your COE by two years, chances are that you are just\r\n\r\ngoing to bump up the COE prices, because the life of the COE has\r\n\r\ngone  up  by 20%, people are going to factor that in  when  they\r\n\r\nnext bid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee suggested that we should lower the ARF\r\n\r\nfurther.  The reason why the Ministry decided not to do this was\r\n\r\nbecause of the very significant knock-on effects of such a move.\r\n\r\nAs  he realises, when we made the change in 1991, we reduced ARF\r\n\r\nfrom  175%  to 150% at that time.  Very quickly the  COE  prices\r\n\r\nrose  in  tandem.  So it is also going to happen this time.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse, people may ask what is wrong with that.  When COE prices\r\n\r\ngo  up, the prevailing quota premium (PQP) also goes up and that\r\n\r\nhas an impact on all those who want to renew their COE after  it\r\n\r\nhas  expired.  So we have decided to err on the side of  caution\r\n\r\nas  far  as  this is concerned.  We will reduce, if  any,  on  a\r\n\r\ngradual  basis.  For this time, we have decided that a  moderate\r\n\r\n10% reduction is sufficient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee also made a point about COEs for\r\n\r\nmotorcycles.  COE prices for motorcycles have fallen  in  recent\r\n\r\nmonths.   In  the  past six months, about 90% of  the  quota  of\r\n\r\nmotorcycle COEs are actually used to register small bikes, those\r\n\r\nengine  capacities of less than 500 cc.  90% of motor bike  COEs\r\n\r\nare  actually  used  for small bikes.  So  there  is  really  no\r\n\r\nproblem  about  small  motorcycle  owners  getting  their  bikes\r\n\r\nregistered or COEs registered.  In fact, they are the  ones  who\r\n\r\nare really determining the price of the COEs, if anything.  So I\r\n\r\ndo not see any need at this juncture to do the separation.  But,\r\n\r\nin  principle, I must say that there is a case to  be  made  for\r\n\r\njust  one category for all vehicles.  That is from the transport\r\n\r\npoint  of view.  We just look at it from that point of view,  we\r\n\r\ndo  not  need  to  have Categories 1 to 4 for  cars.   But  land\r\n\r\ntransport tax structure, COEs, is not a straightforward matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we implemented the COE system, we divided it into four\r\n\r\ncategories because we realised that, at that time, if buyers  of\r\n\r\nsmall cars competed with buyers of large cars, there would be  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  sense of unfairness.  For that reason, we have had  the\r\n\r\nCOE  system of today where there are four categories  and  where\r\n\r\nthe  price of each category is determined by how many  COEs  are\r\n\r\nthere  and how much demand there is for each one.  Each category\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOE  price reflects the price that the motorist in that category\r\n\r\nis  prepared to pay.  It is not the Government that decides what\r\n\r\nprice it is.  It is the buyer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a point that both Dr Wang and Mr Chng Hee Kok\r\n\r\nhave  made  which I think is valid.  We have had the COE  system\r\n\r\nsince  1990.   It is timely for us to do a review from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime.   I agree that we should do a comprehensive review of  the\r\n\r\nVehicle  Quota System this time round.  In so far as  timing  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  I think the appropriate time would be when  the  new\r\n\r\nvehicle  tax changes are implemented and when the system settles\r\n\r\ndown a little bit.  Then I think we should do this comprehensive\r\n\r\nreview  and  when  we  do  that, I would  welcome  any  and  all\r\n\r\nsuggestions on how we should rationalise the COE system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this juncture, I would like to make an announcement\r\n\r\non the COE quota for the quota year May 1998 to April 1999.  The\r\n\r\nnew   tax  structure  that  was  introduced  together  with  ERP\r\n\r\nimplementation  as well as the road tax package  will  not  only\r\n\r\nallow us to control traffic congestion more effectively but,  as\r\n\r\nI  have  repeated,  it  will also give us  this  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nincrease   the   number  of  COEs  if   traffic  congestion   is\r\n\r\ncontrolled.   I  have announced previously that  we  will  issue\r\n\r\nabout  15,000  to 20,000 more COEs over the next three  to  four\r\n\r\nyears  depending on the progress and effectiveness of  ERP.   If\r\n\r\nyou may recall, we released about 5,500 additional COEs for this\r\n\r\nquota  year ending this month, when we extended the Road Pricing\r\n\r\nScheme  to  the  two Expressways, and that was  last  year.   In\r\n\r\nconjunction  with  the widening of the Road Pricing  Scheme,  we\r\n\r\nreleased the additional COEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the coming quota year, which is from May 1998 to April\r\n\r\n1999,  we  will monitor the traffic patterns after the  ERP  has\r\n\r\nbeen  implemented in the CBD - when we have extended it  to  the\r\n\r\nCBD and other RPS points on 1st September - before we decide  on\r\n\r\nthe  appropriate number of extra COEs to be injected.  Based  on\r\n\r\nthe current formula for computing COE quota, the total number of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOEs for the next quota year is 47,885 which is higher than  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  quota  of 44,813 which included the extra  5,500  COEs.\r\n\r\nThe  LTA will release details of the quota of the individual COE\r\n\r\ncategories shortly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to the taxi industry. I would like to\r\n\r\nthank Mr Seng Han Thong and Mr Goh Chee Wee for their support of\r\n\r\nthe  new  vehicle tax structure.  Mr Seng's concern was how  the\r\n\r\nnew  structure can be translated to benefit taxi companies, taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers as well as passengers.  First of all, under the new  tax\r\n\r\nstructure, all existing taxis will enjoy the reduction in annual\r\n\r\ndiesel  tax.  The annual diesel tax will be reduced from  $6,600\r\n\r\nto  $5,100.   LTA  will  meet the taxi companies  and  the  Taxi\r\n\r\nDrivers' Association to work out the details on how taxi drivers\r\n\r\ncan benefit equitably from these savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I met the taxi drivers in a dialogue session.\r\n\r\nThey suggested that the savings be used to top up their Medisave\r\n\r\naccounts.    I  will  ask  the  taxi  drivers,  taxi  operators,\r\n\r\ncompanies  as well as the Association to put their proposals  to\r\n\r\nthe LTA and we will discuss together on how this can be done.  I\r\n\r\nthink it is a good idea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng also asked about the future policy of diesel tax.\r\n\r\nWill  it  be removed?  First of all, to answer that question,  I\r\n\r\nthink we must go back to the history of the diesel tax.  What is\r\n\r\nthe  diesel  tax?   Very simply, it is a  tax  to  equalise  the\r\n\r\ndifference between tax on diesel and tax on petrol.  The tax  on\r\n\r\ndiesel  is  very much lower than the tax on petrol at the  pump.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons for this.  But that is a fact.  So we try\r\n\r\nto make the cost platform for taxis and private cars more equal.\r\n\r\nThis  is where Mr Jeyaretnam just now asked, why do we tax  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  so high, why do we not just remove the diesel tax,  why\r\n\r\ndo we not tax it on the same basis as public transport.  Yes, we\r\n\r\nare  taxing  taxis  as  public transport  but  not  mass  public\r\n\r\ntransport  like  buses.   Taxis  are  a  personalised  form   of\r\n\r\ntransport.   It  is not a substitute for cars and  therefore  it\r\n\r\ncannot  be  taxed in the way that Mr Jeyaretnam suggested,  like\r\n\r\npublic transport, so that we allow everybody to take taxis.  Why\r\n\r\nare we making it so expensive for people to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntake taxis?  Taxis are not subsitutes for cars.  But they are  a\r\n\r\nform of public transport at the very high end and therefore they\r\n\r\nshould, on the one hand, pay taxes similar to a car but, on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, be given some concessions in recognition  of  their\r\n\r\npublic  transport  role.   This we have  done  in  the  new  tax\r\n\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have to impose the diesel tax to equalise this. We\r\n\r\ndid this many years ago, calculated based on the average mileage\r\n\r\ntravelled  by taxis.  With ERP, I would expect that the  average\r\n\r\nmileage incurred by taxis will go down.  Empty cruising will  be\r\n\r\nreduced.    Taxi  drivers  will  be  discouraged  from   driving\r\n\r\nunnecessarily  looking for passengers as they  do  today.   They\r\n\r\nwill  probably have to depend more on radio phones, radio  calls\r\n\r\nor  they will have to find some means of pooling their resources\r\n\r\nor  whatever.   The fact is that they will have to change  their\r\n\r\nmode  of  operation in the same way that other  industries  will\r\n\r\nhave  to.   If  they  do that effectively  and  if  the  mileage\r\n\r\nincurred goes down, then the basis of charging diesel tax, which\r\n\r\nis  based  on mileage, also suggests that diesel tax will  trend\r\n\r\ndownwards.   But  this is really up to the taxi  operators,  how\r\n\r\nthey drive, how they react to the ERP system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of taxi cartels came up from both Dr Toh See\r\n\r\nKiat  and Mr Iswaran who were concerned that taxi companies  may\r\n\r\nform  themselves  into  a  cartel.   Sir,  under  the  new   tax\r\n\r\nstructure, all taxis receive reduction in diesel tax.  They will\r\n\r\nall  receive  road tax rebates.  We design the tax structure  so\r\n\r\nthat  taxes for taxis, as I said earlier, will be comparable  to\r\n\r\ntaxes  for  private cars.  The new tax structure also  has  been\r\n\r\nconfigured in such a way that the total cost of registering  and\r\n\r\nrunning a taxi after the new taxes are implemented will  not  be\r\n\r\nmore  than  what  it is today.  So there is no reason  for  taxi\r\n\r\nfares  to  increase  suddenly when they are deregulated  on  1st\r\n\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I expect that taxi operators, as Mr Goh Chee Wee has stated\r\n\r\nin  this  House  just now, will set their fares sensibly.   They\r\n\r\nwill  have  to see what the demand is like.  They will  have  to\r\n\r\nmatch supply with demand.  If\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  price  their services too high, taxi commuters have  other\r\n\r\nchoices.   They have got bus and the MRT.  They can opt  not  to\r\n\r\ntake  a taxi.  If they set their prices too low, then of course,\r\n\r\nthere  will be overwhelming demand and they will have to  decide\r\n\r\nwhat  is the correct level.  It is a difficult task for the  PTC\r\n\r\nto  have to sit in judgement and to decide and arbitrate on taxi\r\n\r\nfare  increases every time the taxi operators come  to  the  PTC\r\n\r\nwith  their  fare increase.  They are not the ones who  run  the\r\n\r\ntaxi  companies.   They are not the ones who  drive  the  taxis.\r\n\r\nThey  have to look after the interest of the commuters.  But  in\r\n\r\ndoing  so, in looking after the interest of the commuters,  they\r\n\r\nalso  have  to  balance  the need to provide the taxi  companies\r\n\r\nwith a reasonable return and the taxi operators and drivers with\r\n\r\na  reasonable livelihood.  This is a very difficult  task.   And\r\n\r\nevery time they sit to arbitrate and decide on this, there is  a\r\n\r\nlot  of argument and at the end of the day, nobody is happy with\r\n\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is appropriate now that we have set the tax platforms\r\n\r\nand   the   tax   structure  correctly,  that  we  return   this\r\n\r\nresponsibility to the taxi operators and the taxi companies.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  I  would  expect taxi operators to be  responsible,  to\r\n\r\nrecognise their public transport role and the service  to  their\r\n\r\ncustomers in return for the freedom to set their own fares.  The\r\n\r\nPTC   will   continue  to  monitor  the  taxi   industry   after\r\n\r\nderegulation.   It  will  need to set guidelines  on  taxi  fare\r\n\r\nrevisions which taxi operators must observe and it will have  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  commuters are given adequate information  to  make\r\n\r\ninformed choices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh also asked the industry to set minimum standards.\r\n\r\nYes,  the LTA has introduced this performance evaluation  scheme\r\n\r\nbased   on  several  criteria,  and  it  will  set  the  minimum\r\n\r\nperformance standards for all taxi operators.  We will watch and\r\n\r\nsee   what  the  situation  is  like,  how  it  develops   after\r\n\r\nderegulation.   We  will observe how the taxi companies  behave,\r\n\r\nwhether in fact,  they are going to form a cartel to exploit the\r\n\r\ncustomer.    If  necessary,  we  will  further  deregulate   the\r\n\r\nindustry, as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr  Toh  has  suggested, to allow new entrants  to  come  in  to\r\n\r\nincrease competition, and to let the market decide on the supply\r\n\r\nof taxis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai posed the question whether we can make\r\n\r\ntaxis and car rental companies more attractive as an alternative\r\n\r\nto  private cars.  This is, in a way, what we have done with the\r\n\r\nnew  tax structure.  We have re-looked at SZ cars and taxis  and\r\n\r\nmade  all  their operating costs roughly more or less the  same.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  for  new  rental  cars,  we  have  increased  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  life span from seven years to 10 years.    Taxes  for\r\n\r\ntaxis,  we  have  treated them more like cars.   Fares  will  be\r\n\r\nderegulated.  So the stage is really set for all these different\r\n\r\nmodes of transport to compete for customers in the way that they\r\n\r\nknow  best, to offer better service, more comfortable rides,  or\r\n\r\ncheaper  fares  on weekdays, Sundays, as Mr Goh  mentioned  just\r\n\r\nnow.   It  is really up to the taxi companies now and  they  are\r\n\r\nfree to do so after deregulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the tax changes, we are now, in a way, offering more\r\n\r\nchoices.  We are saying to those people who wish to continue  to\r\n\r\ndrive a car, here is a new tax package for you, slight reduction\r\n\r\nin  upfront taxes, more weightage on usage, you decide what your\r\n\r\nlifestyle  is like, which one suits you best.  If you  want  the\r\n\r\ndoor-to-door convenience of a car, you want the reassurance of a\r\n\r\ncar  whenever you need it, you will buy a car.  If you  want  to\r\n\r\ntrade  off some of that convenience for savings, you can  either\r\n\r\nchoose  public  transport  or you can choose  a  combination  of\r\n\r\npublic transport and private transport.  You can choose to  rent\r\n\r\na car, you can take a cab or you can join a car cooperative.  So\r\n\r\nthe choice is really up to you.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai also mentioned that we should convince Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nespecially  graduates, that it is not possible  to  allow  every\r\n\r\ngraduate to own a car.  I would like to assure Mr Rai that  this\r\n\r\nis what we have been trying to do all these years.  It is not an\r\n\r\neasy  dilemma that we have to resolve.  It is a tough  challenge\r\n\r\nbecause, on the one hand, with progress and development,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrising  expectations invariably mean a demand for cars;  on  the\r\n\r\nother hand, a growing demand for travel overall.  So we have  to\r\n\r\nresolve this dilemma.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has always stressed that cars are not like\r\n\r\nHDB flats.  They are a luxury, albeit a legitimate luxury, as  a\r\n\r\nrecent   Straits   Times  editorial  put  it,   but   a   luxury\r\n\r\nnevertheless.   So,  while  the  Government  can  provide  every\r\n\r\nhousehold  with  a HDB flat, it cannot guarantee that  everybody\r\n\r\nwill  own a car.  This is the reason why we have put in so  much\r\n\r\neffort  into  building  up public transport, not just  a  public\r\n\r\ntransport  system that is so-so or can do, but we hope  that  we\r\n\r\nwill  improve the public transport such that it becomes a viable\r\n\r\nalternative to a car for most people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to try and resolve this dilemma. We will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to convince people that public transport is  a  viable\r\n\r\nalternative.  But, at the same time, we will continue to try and\r\n\r\nmeet  this  aspiration for people to own a  car.   That  is  the\r\n\r\nreason  why  we  have ERP, because with ERP we  can  allow  more\r\n\r\npeople to own a car.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam said just now that he cannot understand why\r\n\r\nwe want to issue more COEs.  I could not understand why he could\r\n\r\nnot  understand  that.  If he has been on the ground  and  going\r\n\r\naround  from house to house and talking to people,  I  think  he\r\n\r\nwill  understand the strong desire of people to want  to  own  a\r\n\r\ncar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other example of how we can meet this aspiration is to\r\n\r\ntry  and  introduce  what  I  call more  personalised  transport\r\n\r\nservices.   Under this category, I refer to taxis,  rental  cars\r\n\r\nand, recently, to the car cooperative scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is just one last point that I have not\r\n\r\naddressed yet, and this is on Dr Toh See Kiat's question on  the\r\n\r\ncost   effectiveness   of  underground   roads   and   flyovers.\r\n\r\nBasically,  we  have  to build underground  roads  and  flyovers\r\n\r\nbecause  of limited land.  There are many junctions in Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday  which are very heavily used.  It is no longer  sufficient\r\n\r\nto  just  have  a two-tier flyover.  We need to have  three-tier\r\n\r\nflyovers,  because  of  the  heavy  flow  of  traffic   in   all\r\n\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about criteria. We have to take into account\r\n\r\ntraffic volumes and traffic flows.  We have to take into account\r\n\r\nthe  site  constraints.   We  have  to  take  into  account  the\r\n\r\ntopography.  We have to take into account the value of the  land\r\n\r\nin  the  area,  whether we go over or under, and so  on  and  so\r\n\r\nforth.   These are some of the considerations that  have  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken  into  account.  The Holland Road three-tier  interchange,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  was  selected  after taking  these  factors  into\r\n\r\nconsideration.   Design  studies were  made,  evaluated  against\r\n\r\nvarious  criteria and the final choice was made.  Basically,  we\r\n\r\nneeded  more three-tier interchanges because we have to  relieve\r\n\r\nthe  existing traffic congestion at these junctions, and because\r\n\r\nit  is  part and parcel of our plan to optimise the use  of  our\r\n\r\nroads.  Junctions are where bottlenecks occur.  So when we  have\r\n\r\nmajor  traffic  arteries,  we  have  to  make  sure  that  those\r\n\r\nbottlenecks are removed.  Otherwise, we are under-utilising  our\r\n\r\nroads.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me just conclude by taking this opportunity to\r\n\r\nremind  Members that our land transport policy is not  just  ERP\r\n\r\nalone.   Over  the last so many minutes, I have  been  answering\r\n\r\nqueries  about  ERP, but it is not just ERP.  It is  about  more\r\n\r\nchoices for the public in terms of good public transport.  It is\r\n\r\nabout  expanding the road  network.  It is about building three-tier  interchanges.  It is about managing our roads  to  relieve\r\n\r\ncongestion.   It is about issuing more COEs so that more  people\r\n\r\ncan  aspire  to own cars.  Since we debated the White  Paper  on\r\n\r\nLand  Transport in this House in 1996, we have achieved  a  lot,\r\n\r\nbut  a  lot  more needs to be done.  I am confident that  as  we\r\n\r\npress  on  with the implementation of the various  policies  and\r\n\r\nschemes  that have been mapped out in this White Paper, we  will\r\n\r\nachieve  our vision of a world-class land transport  system  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, last year, I raised the question of\r\n\r\ncommunity-based bus services.  I would like to  raise  it  again\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PTC, in the recent Government announcement, has\r\n\r\nliberalised many features of public transport including taxi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregulations.   I hope this is a step in the right direction  and\r\n\r\nmore  such deregulation and control can be given for efforts  to\r\n\r\nimprove community bus services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present time, bus services in housing estates and so\r\n\r\non  feeding to the main routes, trunk routes and MRT routes  are\r\n\r\ndone  on a restricted feeder bus service.  Very often, residents\r\n\r\nfind that feeder bus services over a period of time diminish and\r\n\r\ndisappear,  leaving many residents rather unhappy.   Because  of\r\n\r\nthe PTC's regulatory regime, it is difficult for anybody just on\r\n\r\nhis  own to come up with some idea or entrepreneurial effort  to\r\n\r\norganise or to form companies for bus services.  But I  hope  it\r\n\r\ncan be considered within this context that communities which are\r\n\r\ninterested  in  providing  better services  for  their  members,\r\n\r\nresidents, families and children going to school can,  on  their\r\n\r\nown  initiative with entrepreneurial effort and perhaps  private\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial capital, be given this chance to run  this  kind\r\n\r\nof  service  within their community.  With that, it  can  really\r\n\r\nanswer  the needs of that community of people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Communications will consider this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.42 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, the work of the Public Transport\r\n\r\nCouncil  is important, in that it sets the tone for bus services\r\n\r\nas   well   as   taxis.   I  am  glad  that  the  Minister   has\r\n\r\ncomprehensively covered taxis, and I will not take  the  House's\r\n\r\ntime on that.  But I would like to highlight one aspect of PTC's\r\n\r\nwork, ie, bus services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think at the last Budget sitting, two Members of this\r\n\r\nHouse,  Dr  Michael Lim and Mr Chay, spoke on  this  issue.   My\r\n\r\nconcern is: why is PTC so rigid in maintaining 40% of the  buses\r\n\r\nshould  be non-air-conditioned service?  With growing affluence,\r\n\r\nI  think more people want to have air-conditioned buses and  the\r\n\r\nratio should be changed, maybe to 70:30 or even 80:20.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern is on Scheme B buses. Maybe the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wants to make a study to see whether they  could  be\r\n\r\norganised into a cooperative or some close-knit group.   Because\r\n\r\nthey are providing a valuable service for the bus commuters.   I\r\n\r\nthink we should appreciate and we should encourage them to  form\r\n\r\ncooperatives.   I  remember years back in  the  70s,  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nChinese  bus companies were amalgamated.  I know these are  one-man  and two-men operations, but some economic incentives  could\r\n\r\nbe given to them.  They could then serve a very useful purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I totally agree with the Minister that we have to\r\n\r\ndepend  on public transport.  But the question that we  have  to\r\n\r\nask ourselves is that until we have improved  and I must concede\r\n\r\nthat  we  have improved  when are we going to come to the  stage\r\n\r\nwhen  the  people who are using taxis and cars will be persuaded\r\n\r\nto  switch.   On the MRT, I already notice that members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  take  a trip on the MRT during the lunch hour.   I  have\r\n\r\nseen MPs, senior civil servants, and bankers, but I have yet  to\r\n\r\nsee  somebody taking the bus.  Maybe it is too long a  distance.\r\n\r\nNow,  we  have  bus  shelters,  but  the  time  factor  is  also\r\n\r\nimportant.   For some bus services, the wait is  more  than  7-8\r\n\r\nminutes, and the MRT is about 3-4 minutes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the PTC could work out a scheme whereby it ensures a\r\n\r\nminimum   service,  I  think  the  public  would  change   their\r\n\r\ntravelling  pattern.   The  PTC  should  also  consult  the  bus\r\n\r\ncommuters and get feedback from them.  It should listen  to  the\r\n\r\ntaxi  operators.   They are an organised group.   Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nthe   bus   and   MRT   commuters  are  not  organised   groups.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the PTC should carry out a survey and get feedback\r\n\r\nto find out what are their needs, and whether the fare structure\r\n\r\nthey  are  going  to  set is actually one  that  will  meet  the\r\n\r\npublic's  expectations.   Of  course,  the  public  wants  cheap\r\n\r\ntravel,  but  it  cannot be so, because the  economic  necessity\r\n\r\ndictates that economic forces work.  What I am suggesting to the\r\n\r\nMinister is that he should organise with PTC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other complaint I have against the composition of PTC\r\n\r\nis  that I do not think any of the members of the PTC comes from\r\n\r\nthe bus commuters.  They all look like the car-owning class.   I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest that they should at least put one or two  members\r\n\r\nwho depend on public transport.  And I suppose this will help in\r\n\r\ngiving the correct feedback.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, my topic is on\r\n\r\nconstruction of pedestrian crossings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, 217 pedestrians were either injured or killed\r\n\r\nwhile  using  zebra  and signalised pedestrian  crossings.   The\r\n\r\ncommon  causes of these accidents are failure to  look  out  and\r\n\r\nfailure of vehicles giving way to pedestrians.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zebra crossings, which used to be a safe mode of crossing\r\n\r\nfor   pedestrians,  have  become  a  potential  accident   spot.\r\n\r\nSometimes  the  crossings  create  bottlenecks  in  our  traffic\r\n\r\nsystem.  The following are some observations at zebra crossings:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Pedestrians simply assume \"absolute right of way\" without\r\n\r\ndue regard to their own safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Some take their own sweet time to cross the zebra crossing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) At certain zebra crossings, the stream of pedestrians is\r\n\r\nalmost  non-stop, thus making it impossible for any  traffic  to\r\n\r\npass through.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) At night, it is difficult for motorists to see pedestrians\r\n\r\nat some of these crossings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above situations cause congestion on our roads, and\r\n\r\nalso traffic accidents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the Ministry has been closely\r\n\r\nmonitoring the situation and has taken various measures.  I hope\r\n\r\nthe  Minister could update the House on the measures taken.   At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, I would urge the Ministry to conduct a thorough\r\n\r\nstudy  to determine the possibility of replacing zebra crossings\r\n\r\nwith other forms of crossings that are safer to pedestrians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, over the\r\n\r\npast two to three years, the Ministry of Communications and  LTA\r\n\r\nhave vastly improved the transport system in Singapore, and  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood of the people is thereby improved.   This  is  indeed\r\n\r\ncommendable.  MRT and LRT are also being developed and a lot  of\r\n\r\nabove-ground and underground projects have been completed.   Our\r\n\r\nbus and taxi services have also improved.  This  can be said  to\r\n\r\nbe  one  good  news after another.  Whether we drive  along  the\r\n\r\nroads  or  commute  by  public transport,  we  cannot  help  but\r\n\r\nappreciate all these rapid developments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang said that the Government had been\r\n\r\ncollecting money all the time.   I think he is wrong  in  saying\r\n\r\nso.    The  facts show that the Government has been making  good\r\n\r\nuse  of   the  taxes collected to  improve our living conditions\r\n\r\nand social amenities.  The Government has already done all this.\r\n\r\nWe  have  accumulated  strong  reserves through years of prudent\r\n\r\nfinancial  management to ensure that  we  can  tide  over   this\r\n\r\neconomic and financial turmoil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, the Ministry of Communications announced\r\n\r\nthat  they  were  going  to build a new MRT  station  near   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Polytechnic.   This  shows  that  the  Government  is\r\n\r\ndetermined  to  meet the needs in our public  transport.   As  a\r\n\r\nlabour  MP, I hope that, apart from looking after the  needs  of\r\n\r\nstudents, the Government should also consider the needs  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.   In  this regard, I hope that the LTA would   consider\r\n\r\nbuilding   MRT stations in the industrial estates.  For example,\r\n\r\nwe  should  consider  building a MRT station  on  the  Woodlands\r\n\r\nextension  line,  near the Sungei Kadut industrial  estate,  for\r\n\r\nthe benefit of the workers there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the implementation of the ERP system, especially\r\n\r\nin   the  CBD,  I  hope that the Ministry of Communications  can\r\n\r\nconsider   giving  the  environmental  vehicles   some   special\r\n\r\nconcessions, especially the garbage trucks.  Rebates  should  be\r\n\r\ngiven to them or to allow them to pay a  fixed monthly rate,  so\r\n\r\nthat  our  environmental workers will not be adversely  affected\r\n\r\nbecause  their companies have to face the rising cost under  the\r\n\r\nnew system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng:</b> Sir, I would like to declare my\r\n\r\ninterest  as  a  director of a construction company.   With  the\r\n\r\nimpending introduction of ERP system, we are going to see a more\r\n\r\naccurate  pricing in road use from a partial shift  of  charging\r\n\r\nfor car ownership to charging for usage of road.  I use the word\r\n\r\n\"partial\"  because any user of ERP still has to own a  car,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is,  you  still have to pay for COE, road tax,  ARF,  etc.\r\n\r\nEven  when  he  is  not driving, the cost is  still  taken  into\r\n\r\naccount every minute.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt the ERP represents the state-of-the-art in\r\n\r\nvehicular traffic management and we should unreservedly  commend\r\n\r\nLTA for their bold effort to move in that direction.  But I wish\r\n\r\nto  point  out  that we already have in place  a  transportation\r\n\r\nsystem  which charges usage even more accurately,  and  that  is\r\n\r\nnone other than our transit system (MRT).  The users pay for the\r\n\r\nMRT  as  taxpayers and they pay as and when they use.   If  they\r\n\r\nchoose  to  stay at home or walk to work, he bears  no  variable\r\n\r\ncost.   And  this concept adheres very closely to the  tenet  of\r\n\r\npricing theory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice this year, other than those already approved\r\n\r\nprojects, the Budget has no special provision for building  more\r\n\r\nMRT  or  LRT  systems.  It is surprising that  a  government  as\r\n\r\nshrewd  as the Singapore Government does not recognise the  rare\r\n\r\nopportunity  to embark on more MRT and LRT construction  in  the\r\n\r\nface of this regional economic slowdown.  The justifications for\r\n\r\nbuilding  more  of  these projects are  quite  obvious.   May  I\r\n\r\nquickly cover some of these.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a tremendous slowdown in construction activities\r\n\r\nin  East  Asia.  The construction materials are very cheap  now.\r\n\r\nLots  of  equipment  are lying around idle.   Big  international\r\n\r\nconstruction  companies are very hungry for jobs.   The  overall\r\n\r\nconstruction  cost index has dropped 10-20%.  If we  build  now,\r\n\r\nour  cost  on investment would be lower and that would  mean  we\r\n\r\nwould get a higher rate of return.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also this substitution effect between road usage\r\n\r\nand transit usage.  If our network of transit system is more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconvenient  and  less costly to use, the commuters  will  switch\r\n\r\nfrom  using  cars to using the transit system.  This  phenomenon\r\n\r\ncan  be  clearly seen in Hong Kong, New York, London,  etc.   As\r\n\r\nmore   people switch to the transit system, the economic  return\r\n\r\non  the  transit  system would be better and,  hence,  make  the\r\n\r\nsystem more viable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the longer term, a more comprehensive transit system\r\n\r\nwould  benefit the nation as a whole.  We definitely spend  less\r\n\r\nforeign  reserves to import cars and petroleum year after  year.\r\n\r\nWe  also  have  less  air and noise pollution.   Our  population\r\n\r\npossibly  will spend less time on the road, suffering less  from\r\n\r\nthe  stress  of  driving, spending more time  resting,  or  even\r\n\r\nreading on the train, etc.  These are the intangibles and softer\r\n\r\nfactors  that  are  hard  to quantify  but  clearly  beneficial,\r\n\r\nespecially when we strive to move towards a more civic society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past week, many Members of this House have pointed\r\n\r\nout  that  many  of  our  companies are badly  affected  by  the\r\n\r\nregional  crisis.  If the Government implements  more  MRT,  LRT\r\n\r\nprojects  now,  it  will help to prime the economy  and  provide\r\n\r\nreliefs  to our companies.  And coupled with the points  I  have\r\n\r\npointed out earlier, it is a win-win proposal for the Government\r\n\r\nto  do  more now.  Before I end, I would like to point out  that\r\n\r\nnot  only  the transit system would use less land for a specific\r\n\r\ntraffic  volume,  it actually would enhance the  value  of  land\r\n\r\nalong  the  corridor of the system, and such  enhancement  to  a\r\n\r\nlarge extent will offset the construction cost of the system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, Sir, I am not calling here for more\r\n\r\nconstruction of MRT and LRT for the sake of economic stimulation\r\n\r\nwithout  regard  to  the long-term viability  of  the  projects.\r\n\r\nSingapore has one of the highest density of population per sq km\r\n\r\nin  the  world.  Big cities like London or Paris have  a  bigger\r\n\r\ncosmopolitan area, lesser high- rise residential buildings,  yet\r\n\r\nthey  operate  some very efficient transit systems.   I  believe\r\n\r\ntownships  like  Tampines or Ang Mo Kio have  enough  population\r\n\r\ndensity to justify some viable LRT system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, infrastructure work such as MRT or LRT is an\r\n\r\nasset.   It  is  not  an  expenditure  per  se.   Building  this\r\n\r\ninfrastructure is equivalent to converting cash in  the  balance\r\n\r\nsheet  into  a  useful asset.  And I call  on  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider  expanding our MRT and LRT network now, so as to  cater\r\n\r\nfor future increase in demand when the good times return.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There are 10 more speakers. \"Guillotine\"\r\n\r\ntime is 5.20 pm.  Mr Mah.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, Mr Chay proposed that we allow\r\n\r\nprivate  companies to run their own bus services.  I would  just\r\n\r\nlike to enlighten him that we have actually been doing that, ie,\r\n\r\nallowing  private  bus  operators to operate  scheduled  shuttle\r\n\r\nservices.   Currently, there are about 28 such services  run  by\r\n\r\nScheme  B  and they supplement the regular services of  SBS  and\r\n\r\nTIBS.   But  in  addition to that, there  are  also  19  private\r\n\r\nshuttle  services at the moment.  Another 10 will be added  once\r\n\r\ndevelopments   are  ready.   And  they  operate   from   private\r\n\r\ncondominiums, commercial centres linking to MRT stations and bus\r\n\r\ninterchanges.  They are provided by the management committees of\r\n\r\nthe  private estates for the use of their residents or  for  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  their  customers.  On top of that,  there  are  private\r\n\r\nfactories  which  supply bus services for  their  workers.   All\r\n\r\nthese  supplementary services play a useful role  in  connecting\r\n\r\nservices  from  the specific destination to the  main  transport\r\n\r\nsystem.  PTC would welcome any organisation that wishes to apply\r\n\r\nto  operate  these services, if they find it feasible  and  cost\r\n\r\neffective to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the specific point about whether they should run feeder\r\n\r\nservices in HDB estates, if that is what Mr Chay has in mind,  I\r\n\r\nwould add a word of caution.  At the current fares, many of  the\r\n\r\nfeeder  services in the housing estates are not profitable  and,\r\n\r\nin  fact, they are being cross-subsidised by the trunk services.\r\n\r\nSo  while PTC may not have anything in principle against  having\r\n\r\nsuch  services  run in the HDB estates, I think there  would  be\r\n\r\nvery  limited scope or incentive for other operators  to  either\r\n\r\nrun   fully,  or  on  a  supplemental  basis,  these   services.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if any grassroots organisation or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntown  councils wish to run these services within their  estates,\r\n\r\nand  if they think that they can make it viable, they can submit\r\n\r\ntheir  proposals to PTC for consideration.  But I would like  to\r\n\r\nreiterate  this word of caution - that it is not a  money-making\r\n\r\nproposition as such, because it is actually part of  the  bigger\r\n\r\npublic  transport  network  that  the  scheduled  bus  operators\r\n\r\noperate, and there is a fair element of cross-subsidy involved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai made some useful comments about the Public Transport\r\n\r\nCouncil.   Let me address them.  On the question of  the  Public\r\n\r\nTransport Council being rigid, I think, first of all, he may not\r\n\r\nbe  aware  that the PTC's limit on air-conditioned  services  is\r\n\r\nactually no longer there.  In fact, the lid has been lifted.  It\r\n\r\nused  to be 40%.  Now, I think it has been brought down to  20%,\r\n\r\nand  eventually probably it will be lifted altogether.  But that\r\n\r\nis  in  a  way  reflective of the situation that the  PTC  finds\r\n\r\nitself  in.  Because, on the one hand, there is this  school  of\r\n\r\nthought that says, \"Look, Singapore is a modern society,  it  is\r\n\r\nvery  hot,  let's  air-condition  all  the  buses.   People  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  pay  for  it.\"  And on the other  hand,  there  is\r\n\r\nanother  not  insignificant group which says, \"Look,  we  cannot\r\n\r\nafford to pay the 10 or 20 cents more for air-conditioned buses.\r\n\r\nWe  don't mind waiting for a non-airconditioned bus because this\r\n\r\nmeans  a  lot to me, and I cannot afford to pay.\"  So  there  is\r\n\r\nstill a small group of people, not insignificant, who would like\r\n\r\nto  keep some buses in the fleet non-airconditioned and charging\r\n\r\na  lower  fare.   The PTC has to recognise this  and  take  into\r\n\r\naccount  this feedback and, therefore, it has had  to  put  this\r\n\r\nlimit  of 20% on airconditioned buses.  But over time,  I  would\r\n\r\nexpect  that this limit will be reduced and eventually  it  will\r\n\r\ndisappear  completely.   But PTC is  not  being  rigid.   It  is\r\n\r\nactually  being very sensitive to the different requirements  of\r\n\r\ndifferent sectors of the bus commuting public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether there should be a minimum service standard for\r\n\r\nbuses,  yes,  there is actually a minimum service  standard  for\r\n\r\nbuses  and  this  minimum service standard is reflected  in  the\r\n\r\nminimum waiting times,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nminimum  headways, maximum distance between bus  stops,  minimum\r\n\r\nnumber of services in an estate, and so on and so forth.   Those\r\n\r\nminimum   service  standards  are  already  in  place  and   are\r\n\r\napplicable to all our scheduled bus operators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the PTC is well-organised to take into account\r\n\r\ndifferent  groups of people, I would say that its  members  come\r\n\r\nfrom all walks of life, including the labour movement, academia,\r\n\r\nprofessionals and grassroots organisations.  It includes  people\r\n\r\nwho  drive to work and people who take public transport to work.\r\n\r\nI  can  assure  Mr  Rai that when the Public  Transport  Council\r\n\r\nmeets,  the Chairman has actually quite a tough time  trying  to\r\n\r\nreconcile all the different interest groups represented by those\r\n\r\nmembers in his Council.  And I must say that he is doing a  very\r\n\r\ngood  job considering the difficulties involved.  But the Public\r\n\r\nTransport  Council can always do with more fresh  ideas.   So  I\r\n\r\nwould  ask  Mr Rai, if he agrees, that perhaps I should  appoint\r\n\r\nhim  to the Public Transport Council.  Unfortunately, he is  not\r\n\r\nhere  to give me an answer straightaway.  But I will ask him  in\r\n\r\nthe Members' Room later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked whether we can consider replacing zebra\r\n\r\ncrossings  with other safer forms of crossings.   Yes,  the  LTA\r\n\r\ntells  me  that there are many different types of crossings  and\r\n\r\nthey have different users.  Whether you have a zebra crossing or\r\n\r\na  traffic  light crossing or overhead bridge really depends  on\r\n\r\nwhere,  on how much traffic, site constraints, and so on and  so\r\n\r\nforth.  So where it is possible and feasible, they will consider\r\n\r\nreplacing  it.   But  it  is not advisable  to  have  a  blanket\r\n\r\nguideline  or ruling to say that we do away with zebra crossings\r\n\r\naltogether.  They do serve their purpose.  There is a  need  for\r\n\r\neducation  to  make sure that pedestrians know how  to  use  the\r\n\r\nzebra  crossings safely and motorists also know how to  approach\r\n\r\nthe zebra crossings safely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked about the garbage trucks. He asked\r\n\r\nwhether we could give garbage trucks some concessions.  I  think\r\n\r\nI  have made some comments on that earlier.  Generally speaking,\r\n\r\nwe apply the ERP charges to all vehicles and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  expect  the vehicle owners to either absorb, adapt  or  find\r\n\r\nsome  other ways.  Basically, the message to all vehicle owners,\r\n\r\nfleet  owners, bus operators, taxi operators is that  they  have\r\n\r\ngot  to  live with ERP.  They have to get used to it. They  have\r\n\r\ngot  to  adapt  to  it.   There is  nothing  to  be  afraid  of.\r\n\r\nBasically, there are many organisations that have learned how to\r\n\r\nadapt and taxi companies for one and I believe others, including\r\n\r\nthe garbage collectors, will also learn how to adapt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked about additional MRT stations. Yes, we are\r\n\r\nlooking  at  traffic  volumes along all the existing  lines  and\r\n\r\nlooking at whether we can justify the building of additional MRT\r\n\r\nstations  like  what we have done for the Singapore  Polytechnic\r\n\r\nstation.   The space was allocated to the Singapore  Polytechnic\r\n\r\nstation  on  the  North-South line but at that time,  the  study\r\n\r\nshowed  that  the  volume did not justify.   But  now  with  the\r\n\r\npolytechnic  fully completed and the student  population  up  to\r\n\r\nsomething like, I believe, 15,000 or thereabouts, it has  become\r\n\r\nviable  to  build  and  operate that station  at  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nPolytechnic.  That is the reason why after a feasibility  study,\r\n\r\nwe  have  decided to go ahead to build the Singapore Polytechnic\r\n\r\nstation.   We will do similar studies for other existing  lines.\r\n\r\nWe will do it together with other statutory boards, JTC, URA and\r\n\r\nHDB.   And  if  the  ridership justifies,  yes,  we  will  build\r\n\r\nadditional  stations.  But it has to be justified  on  ridership\r\n\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Chuang Shaw Peng suggested that the LTA speed\r\n\r\nup  the expansion of the MRT-LRT system, basically to capitalise\r\n\r\non the lower construction cost arising from the current economic\r\n\r\nsituation.   I  have  said many times in  this  House  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is committed to building a world-class land transport\r\n\r\nsystem  based  on a public transport which is very  comfortable,\r\n\r\nvery  efficient, very cost effective and which can offer a  good\r\n\r\nalternative  to  cars.   And  that public  transport  system  is\r\n\r\nbasically  the  rapid  transit  system,  rail-based  system,  as\r\n\r\nopposed to public bus system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we already have a very extensive network of rail-based system. We have about 83 km of track. We carry about 1\r\n\r\nmillion passengers a day.  When we first started the system,  we\r\n\r\nwere  talking  about  250,000.  Today, we are  talking  about  1\r\n\r\nmillion  passengers  per day.  It is a very  well  used  system,\r\n\r\nviable, profitable, well-run, efficient.  So it has attracted  1\r\n\r\nmillion  passengers, many of whom, as Mr Rai  pointed  out  just\r\n\r\nnow,  are people who are car owners who use the MRT for some  of\r\n\r\ntheir  trips,  and that is as it should be.  So we  will  expand\r\n\r\nthis   network  further.   We  will  expand  it  as  our   urban\r\n\r\ndevelopment  expands,  as  more new  towns  are  built,  as  the\r\n\r\ndowntown area is developed, and as more new centres of work  and\r\n\r\npopulation develop.  That is definitely on the cards.  But every\r\n\r\nline  we  build,  every station we build has to be  economically\r\n\r\njustified.  It cannot be a luxury.  It has to be justified.  And\r\n\r\nthat is why in good times and in bad, we are able to justify and\r\n\r\nproceed with the building of the MRT or LRT system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the LTA plans to do is to implement an average of one\r\n\r\nrapid  transit system a year.  And if we can sustain this  rate,\r\n\r\nin 10 years' time, we will be doubling our network from 83 km to\r\n\r\nsomething  like 150 km of rail.  That is a very, very  ambitious\r\n\r\nplan,  I must add.  Because we will be doing what many countries\r\n\r\nhave taken something like 30 to 50 years.  In 10 to 15 years, we\r\n\r\nwill  be  building what other countries took 30 to 50  years  to\r\n\r\nbuild.  That is the kind of pace that we hope to sustain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Chuang pointed out, yes, the current economic crisis\r\n\r\ndoes present us with opportunities, more competitive prices  for\r\n\r\none.   But  at the same time, we have to factor in the weakening\r\n\r\nof  the Singapore dollar because some of the contracts and  some\r\n\r\nof  the equipment actually come in US dollars and other European\r\n\r\ncurrencies.  So we will have to do the weighing.  But  LTA  will\r\n\r\nmonitor the situation very carefully, see what advantages we can\r\n\r\nreap from this situation and seize the opportunity where we can.\r\n\r\nAnd  if  we find it advantageous and the sums are in our favour,\r\n\r\nyes we will speed up the implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I will be very brief to allow the\r\n\r\nMinister to reply.  My question is:  when will the privatisation\r\n\r\nof PSA take place?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Recently, the harbour tug services in\r\n\r\nthe  port  have been privatised and I hope this is the beginning\r\n\r\nof many other downstream services that can be privatised for the\r\n\r\nport.  In introducing competition to the port services, this  is\r\n\r\na  good  way to keep the port efficient.  So terminal  handling,\r\n\r\nberth  services, even distribution centre services, are examples\r\n\r\nof  such  downstream services that we can  do  with  a  dose  of\r\n\r\ninvigorating competition.  This task is particularly urgent  now\r\n\r\nwhen  the  exchange rates of some of our neighbouring  countries\r\n\r\nwho have been building ports have been lowered.  We can see that\r\n\r\nonce  they begin to recover, their competition will become  very\r\n\r\nkeen.   So I hope that our port services will continue to  raise\r\n\r\ntheir  competitiveness in this respect.  The MPA could  consider\r\n\r\nprivatising more of the downstream services soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, first,\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to  declare my interest as I  am  working  in  a\r\n\r\nlogistics and forwarding company, not a local one though.  But I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask that more be done to support local  transport\r\n\r\nlogistics  providers.  I think we can be proud of  our  airport,\r\n\r\nour  seaport and world class national airline and shipping line.\r\n\r\nWe  want  to  be,  and  we are already, a regional  distribution\r\n\r\ncentre  but  I  feel  that more should be  done  to  help  local\r\n\r\nforwarders  to upgrade themselves.  In the last many  years,  if\r\n\r\nyou look at the top IATA forwarders in Singapore, about 10, only\r\n\r\none  is a Singapore company.  This has been so for the last  few\r\n\r\nyears and I do not see many changes taking place in the next few\r\n\r\nyears unless major strategic initiatives are taken to help local\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that unless local companies are\r\n\r\nable  to  rise  to  this challenge and to complement  the  solid\r\n\r\ninfrastructure that we have, we will find ourselves difficult to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  competition, especially in some regional cities  that\r\n\r\nhave  expressed interest in wanting to also be a  regional  hub.\r\n\r\nIt is also not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsurprising to note that a lot of the local companies  today  are\r\n\r\nfinding  it  difficult  to  compete  and  meet  with  the  total\r\n\r\nlogistics  requirements of multi-national companies where  their\r\n\r\nrequirements have crossed the global and regional span.   So  we\r\n\r\nreally need to do something about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have got two suggestions. One is to establish strong\r\n\r\nalliances between Government-owned and GLCs with local companies\r\n\r\nso  that  local  companies have the experience  to  upgrade  and\r\n\r\nparticipate  in bigger contracts.  Secondly, when  PSA  recently\r\n\r\nannounced  a  joint  venture  with  a  large  German  automotive\r\n\r\nlogistics firm, I would have thought it be appropriate  to  also\r\n\r\ninclude local companies to be involved and gain some experience.\r\n\r\nThirdly,  maybe  we  could  establish  more  forwarder  linkages\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore  and other major distribution  centres  where\r\n\r\ncertain very expensive infrastructure that can be built  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  be  shared  by  local  companies  who  find  it\r\n\r\nextremely prohibitive to set up on their own, especially when we\r\n\r\ntalk about IT network and all.  Fourthly, perhaps, we could  use\r\n\r\nour  strong  bilateral  relations with other  countries  in  the\r\n\r\nregion  to  have certain exemptions with regard to the  existing\r\n\r\nbureaucratic and customs practices that some of the countries in\r\n\r\nthe  region impose on goods that are transhipped from Singapore.\r\n\r\nOn  the  whole, I hope we could do a lot more so that the  local\r\n\r\nindustries can be upgraded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, again, I will be brief. The question\r\n\r\nI    have   is   with   regard    to   the   liberalisation   of\r\n\r\ntelecommunication  services and the cheaper infrastructure  that\r\n\r\nwe  could  put in to allow for electronic commerce.  Firstly,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  the Minister to give this House an  update  on  the\r\n\r\nprogress  of  obtaining the third mobile and second  fixed  line\r\n\r\noperator,  and whether there are any further plans to liberalise\r\n\r\npost and telecommunications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have had complaints about the service standards of\r\n\r\nour  Internet service providers and also about the high cost  of\r\n\r\nlease line services.  These are costs that people would have  to\r\n\r\nbear if they go into\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelectronic commerce.  If we are to become an electronic commerce\r\n\r\nhub,   we   need   to  ensure  inexpensive  but   high   quality\r\n\r\ntelecommunication infrastructure.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr John Chen, you have five minutes to reply.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr John Chen Seow</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Phun):</b> Sir, Dr Toh asked when the PSA Corporation will be\r\n\r\nprivatised.  PSA was corporatised in October 1997.  The Ministry\r\n\r\nwill monitor the development of the corporatised PSA closely and\r\n\r\ndecide on when it should be privatised at a later date.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay asked that we introduce more competition in port\r\n\r\nservices.  Yes, the MPA has already taken steps to open to  more\r\n\r\nservice  providers.   He mentioned about  the  towage  services.\r\n\r\nThis was introduced in the beginning of March, and they will  be\r\n\r\ndoing more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli suggests to the Government how to help the\r\n\r\nlocal logistics companies to compete.  The suggestions given  by\r\n\r\nhim  are good ones.  In fact, the Government has already started\r\n\r\nsome  of  these things that he has mentioned.  Let me just  give\r\n\r\nyou  some examples.  For instance, the Logistics Enhancement and\r\n\r\nApplications Programme (LEAP) administered by the TDB.  If he is\r\n\r\ninterested  about this programme, I will get the  TDB  to  brief\r\n\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On providing linkages to facilitate quick and efficient\r\n\r\nmovement  of  goods,   TDB, EDB and Customs have  put  in  place\r\n\r\nvarious  IT  systems  to help freight forwarders  and  logistics\r\n\r\nservice  providers  to  improve their speed  and  efficiency  in\r\n\r\nhandling goods.  Some examples include TradeNet Plus, which is a\r\n\r\nnational IT framework to cover the entire international  trading\r\n\r\nchain,  from  locating  a  product, compliance  with  regulatory\r\n\r\nrequirements,  to  the delivery of the product using  electronic\r\n\r\nmeans.  Another example is Spectrum.  It is a national air cargo\r\n\r\ncommunity  system  which  enables automated  exchange  of  cargo\r\n\r\ninformation   among  airlines,  cargo  agents   and   Government\r\n\r\nagencies, both locally and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninternationally.  Such a system helps our local companies  track\r\n\r\ntheir  shipments without having to set up their own  IT  network\r\n\r\noverseas which, as Mr Zulkifli has mentioned,  is expensive.  So\r\n\r\nthey can ride on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides upgrading the local companies, the Government is\r\n\r\nalso  facilitating companies in expanding their  global  network\r\n\r\nand  such  efforts  are  targeted  both  at  the  government  to\r\n\r\ngovernment level, eg, at ASEAN fora, such as the ASEAN Framework\r\n\r\nof  Services,  and  also at the company level,  where  potential\r\n\r\npartners and users are matched with local companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh asked about the status of the further liberalisation\r\n\r\nof  telecom  services.  The tenders for up to  two  more  public\r\n\r\nbasic  telecommunication service licences and  up  to  two  more\r\n\r\npublic cellular mobile telephone service licences were closed on\r\n\r\n31st  December 1997.  There were altogether three and  two  pre-qualified tenderers respectively in the two categories.  TAS  is\r\n\r\nnow  in  the  midst  of the tender evaluation process  and  will\r\n\r\nannounce the results by mid-1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh also asked about the quality of the Internet\r\n\r\nservice.  The Internet market has been liberalised in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  three  Internet service providers (ISPs) and the  many  re-sellers have launched very competitive price schemes to meet the\r\n\r\nneeds of different users, depending on their usage requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet service providers are also required to comply\r\n\r\nwith TAS' strict quality of service standards.  For example,  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  quarter  of  1997, all the three  ISPs  exceeded  the\r\n\r\nquality  of service levels imposed by TAS.  In fact, the quality\r\n\r\nof  service  achieved by our ISPs ranks among the  best  in  the\r\n\r\nindustry.  Our users here, therefore, get good value for  money.\r\n\r\nBut there could be further improvements for the ISPs such as  in\r\n\r\ntheir  marketing effort and customer relations.   No  doubt  the\r\n\r\nISPs will strive to improve further, considering the competitive\r\n\r\nenvironment they are in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for leased line services, independent reports and\r\n\r\nmonitoring   by   TAS  suggest  that  our  present   rates   are\r\n\r\ncompetitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough there were some complaints about high leased line cost,\r\n\r\nwe  found that in these cases the comparisons were not  made  on\r\n\r\nthe  same  basis.   According to surveys by Data  Communication,\r\n\r\nSingTel   is  already  the  price  leader  when  it   comes   to\r\n\r\ninternational  leased line hubbing in the Asia-Pacific  compared\r\n\r\nto   other  carriers  in  traditional  hub  locations  such   as\r\n\r\nAustralia, Hong Kong and Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.20 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

At the\r\n\r\nright  price, we can be either a seller or a buyer.  Singapore's\r\n\r\nhome  ownership  policy has made almost  everyone  here  a  home\r\n\r\nowner.   Many  non-home  owners today  are  also  aspiring  home\r\n\r\nowners.   It is no wonder then that when the property prices  go\r\n\r\nup too fast, or come down too fast, we get some people angry and\r\n\r\nfrustrated, while, at the same time, others may be laughing  all\r\n\r\nthe way to the bank.  Unfortunately, those who are happy because\r\n\r\nthey  are  better off are usually silent, while  those  who  are\r\n\r\naffected  adversely tend to be very vocal.  They  express  their\r\n\r\nviews  publicly  and lobby Government officials and  the  media.\r\n\r\nVery often, the noise generated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the perceived vested interests of the lobbies make it  hard\r\n\r\nto see the gravity of the real situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While not everyone can agree whether the price of the\r\n\r\nproperty market today is high or low or at just the right price,\r\n\r\nall  of us agree, I believe, that we need some stability in  the\r\n\r\nproperty   market.    The  property  price  index   of   private\r\n\r\nresidential  properties  doubled from about  150  in  the  first\r\n\r\nquarter  of 1993 to over 300 in the second quarter of 1996,   in\r\n\r\njust  over  three  years.  The Government was perceived  by  the\r\n\r\ngeneral public then to have been slow in reacting to the runaway\r\n\r\nprices then.  Since its peak in the second quarter of 1996, when\r\n\r\nanti-speculation measures were introduced by the Government, the\r\n\r\nindex  has  only dropped about 16.5%.  We are now  back  to  the\r\n\r\nfirst quarter of 1995 levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Price stability in the property market is important as it\r\n\r\naffects  credit facilities by banks and financial  institutions.\r\n\r\nIt   influences  sentiments  and  also  the  herd  mentality  of\r\n\r\nspeculators and investors alike.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has a duty to do its utmost to stabilise the\r\n\r\nproperty  market.  The property prices may still  be  considered\r\n\r\nhigh  today relative to the early 1990s.  However, it is  in  no\r\n\r\none's  interest  to  see it crash, as the  consequences  on  the\r\n\r\nentire  economy may be disastrous.  The Government  has  already\r\n\r\nintroduced  several  measures such as deferring  the  Government\r\n\r\nland  sales  programme, extending the project completion  period\r\n\r\nfor  Government land sales sites and suspending the  stamp  duty\r\n\r\nsurcharge  on contracts for the sale of properties within  three\r\n\r\nyears of purchase to stabilise the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that I would like to ask the Minister is: what\r\n\r\nelse  does he plan to do to stabilise the market if it goes down\r\n\r\ndrastically  further?  At the same time, the  Government  should\r\n\r\nalso  think of measures to prevent the market, after it  bottoms\r\n\r\nout,  from running away again, as it did between 1993 and  1996.\r\n\r\nWhat  will the Minister do to prevent this from happening again?\r\n\r\nThis is important as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  believe  the public expects the Government to be  even-handed\r\n\r\nand respond as quickly to an upturn as it had been to a downturn\r\n\r\nin the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, I have spoken during the budget\r\n\r\ndebate  about relaxing the cash downpayment for the purchase  of\r\n\r\nprivate  properties  from 20% to 10%,  to  help  aspiring  young\r\n\r\nprofessionals  to become first-time owners of private  property.\r\n\r\nAnd given the slow down in the property market, this offers them\r\n\r\na good golden opportunity to catch their rainbow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Richard Hu, in his reply, dismissed it when he said that\r\n\r\nthe  banks cannot over expose themselves to the property sector,\r\n\r\nand  that home buyers should not be highly geared.  Dr  Hu  also\r\n\r\nturned down Mr Choo Wee Khiang's plea to use CPF savings in lieu\r\n\r\nof  cash,  because  the  CPF goes back to  the  buyer  when  the\r\n\r\nproperty is sold.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not sure if Government understands that I am\r\n\r\ntalking  about a very small pool of young professionals who  are\r\n\r\nfirst-time buyers, maybe 10,000 or much less.  I support all the\r\n\r\nanti-speculation  measures the Government has implemented.   But\r\n\r\nwhat  I  am  talking now is for first-time buyers of properties,\r\n\r\nand not speculators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the Government's answer to meet the aspirations\r\n\r\nof  this small group of people has been through the introduction\r\n\r\nof   the  Executive  Condominiums  (ECs).   But  we  know   from\r\n\r\nexperience  that  young professionals prefer private  properties\r\n\r\nfor  various  reasons.    Even  so, the  Government  could  also\r\n\r\nconsider  the  relaxation of this 20% rule for  applications  of\r\n\r\nECs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, maybe I am pre-empting the Minister's answer by saying\r\n\r\nthat  going by his past replies, he could probably say,  \"Please\r\n\r\nchannel  your  request  to the Minister  for  Finance.\"   He  is\r\n\r\nabsolutely right.  The plea that I am making to the Minister  is\r\n\r\nthat   he  is  also the Chairman of the National Youth  Council.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  would like to appeal to him on  behalf  of  young\r\n\r\nprofessionals  who have a real chance of chasing their  rainbows\r\n\r\nnow, in this soft market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Chairman of the GPC has just pointed out, the\r\n\r\nprices are holding at 1995 prices.  If this proposal is allowed,\r\n\r\nthese  first-time potential owners may get lower  prices  during\r\n\r\nthe  soft  market situation.  And it is not a question of  these\r\n\r\nprofessionals  over extending their credit,  as  some  reporters\r\n\r\nhave  written over the weekend.  They have hard assets, but  not\r\n\r\nso much cash, and that is their problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not convinced with Dr Hu's argument that the\r\n\r\nrelaxation  of  the policy would unduly over expose  the  banks,\r\n\r\nbecause  the number of this target group that I am speaking  for\r\n\r\nis very, very small to affect the banks in any big way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that the Minister will not dismiss this plea.\r\n\r\nI hope that I can persuade him so that he can persuade the other\r\n\r\nMinisters in the Cabinet and help these young talents.   And  as\r\n\r\nDr  Lee  Boon  Yang  had said yesterday,  local  talent  is  the\r\n\r\nfoundation of Singapore and I think we should put more  emphasis\r\n\r\non them before we find more ways of drawing foreign talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> Sir, the nexus\r\n\r\nbetween the private property market and public housing is clear.\r\n\r\nThis is especially so for Singapore where home ownership is more\r\n\r\nthan  90%.   We  know that the private property prices  have  an\r\n\r\neffect on public housing and vice versa.  Thus, the need for the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the Ministry of National Development  to  tread\r\n\r\ncarefully on this plain.  It was, therefore, very reassuring  to\r\n\r\nsee  how Prime Minister Goh handled the issue of upholding  high\r\n\r\nstandards  when MP Mr Heng Chiang Meng, the former President  of\r\n\r\nREDAS,  was caught in the tricky position about Government  land\r\n\r\nsales  and  the  property market.  In the words of  the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes editorial, Mr Heng, I quote, \"did the honourable thing\" by\r\n\r\nquitting  as  the  REDAS  President and resigning  as  Executive\r\n\r\nDirector of Far East Organisation, which is Singapore's  biggest\r\n\r\ndeveloper.   PM  Goh, in making public his exchange  of  letters\r\n\r\nwith  Mr  Heng,  brought relief to many for  it  reinforced  the\r\n\r\nbelief in the transparency and accountability of our system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister, Sir, what further assurances would\r\n\r\nMND  give  to  ensure public confidence in its transparency  and\r\n\r\naccountability   would   be   preserved,   if   not,   enhanced?\r\n\r\nSpecifically,  what are the critical considerations  that  would\r\n\r\ndetermine MND's policy on land sales?  What effect do you expect\r\n\r\nland  sales  to  have on current property prices,  both  on  the\r\n\r\nprivate property and public housing?  And finally, if I may  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister, what effect did the Ministry's adjustments to the\r\n\r\nprivate residential policies announced last November have on our\r\n\r\nproperty market?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, the property market in land scarce\r\n\r\ncountries  like Singapore has a direct impact on  the  country's\r\n\r\neconomy.  As property prices increase steeply, it creates  asset\r\n\r\nprice inflation, as we have seen in Singapore from 1992 to 1996.\r\n\r\nAsset  price  inflation translates to higher rental or  property\r\n\r\npurchase costs, so business costs go up.  This increase in  cost\r\n\r\nhas  to  be  passed  on  to the customers,  so  ultimately,  the\r\n\r\nconsumers  see  an  increase  in  expenditure.   To  afford  the\r\n\r\nincreased  expenditure, individuals need to have more  cash  and\r\n\r\nhence  need higher wages.  For individuals, they have to  pay  a\r\n\r\nhigher  price to own or rent a property.  To be able  to  afford\r\n\r\nthese  higher prices, they need higher wages, so the total  wage\r\n\r\ncosts  go up.  This creates a direct impact on the cost of doing\r\n\r\nbusiness  in Singapore.  Sir, this is a vicious circle  and  the\r\n\r\nroot cause of the problem is asset price inflation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few days of debate, we have been told many\r\n\r\ntimes that wage cost is the real issue affecting the rising cost\r\n\r\nof  doing business here.  I agree with this, but this is,  as  I\r\n\r\nhave  analysed  earlier, just the symptom of the  real  problem,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  asset  price inflation.  Sir, this  is  one  way  the\r\n\r\nproperty  prices  affect our economy.  On the other  hand,  many\r\n\r\nbusinesses  and individuals have invested heavily in properties.\r\n\r\nShould  the property price bubble burst, there will be a  sudden\r\n\r\ndevaluation  of their assets.  Banks may ask for  repayments  to\r\n\r\nbridge  the  loss  of  value or, worse  still,  force  sell  the\r\n\r\nproperties to recover whatever residual value they can have, in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe case of very heavy borrowings.  Book value of company assets\r\n\r\nwould also be much reduced.  As an example, we can look at  what\r\n\r\nhappened in Japan, about seven years ago, when the bubble burst.\r\n\r\nThe  economy in Japan is still having problems recovering.   We,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  must  hope  that  the  bubble  does  not  burst   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   However,  this does not mean that  property  prices\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  allowed to slide downwards at  a  steady  rate.\r\n\r\nLetting  a little air out of the balloon may be a healthy  thing\r\n\r\nto do, to reduce the growing tension and strains on the property\r\n\r\nmarket and hence our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the property market, like many sectors of our economy,\r\n\r\nis  a cyclical one, we have seen the peak in 1996 and now prices\r\n\r\nare coming down, heading towards a trough.  This cyclical effect\r\n\r\nis  not  necessarily  bad,  as we have  a  chance  to  make  due\r\n\r\ncorrections to an inflated market.  However, if we intervene too\r\n\r\nearly during the downside, we may risk artificially propping the\r\n\r\nmarket  up at unsustainable levels in the long term.  The effect\r\n\r\nwill  be seen many years from now if we allow a new higher  base\r\n\r\nto  be  set now.  In the next upturn, the prices will  start  to\r\n\r\nincrease  from this higher base when they should have, in  fact,\r\n\r\nstarted  from a more realistic lower level should market  forces\r\n\r\nhave been allowed to determine the prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been recent calls by certain developer groups to\r\n\r\nlift  the measures put in by the Government in May 1996 and also\r\n\r\ncalls to further stimulate the property sector.  I would like to\r\n\r\nrequest  the Minister for National Development not to  lift  the\r\n\r\nmeasures  that  have  been  very  effective.   It  was  recently\r\n\r\nreported  in  the  Straits Times that all the  major  developers\r\n\r\nstill  expect to make a comfortable margin in their  profits  in\r\n\r\n1997,  despite making provisions for losses due to unsold units,\r\n\r\nand  this comes after two years of record profits for them.   We\r\n\r\nhave already seen some of the corporate results in the last  few\r\n\r\ndays to confirm this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, therefore, should stick to its original\r\n\r\nobjectives and fundamental strategy to curb speculation  in  the\r\n\r\nproperty  market, whether times are good or bad.   Any  measures\r\n\r\nthe Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nputs  in  place should be long term focused, to give the general\r\n\r\ndirection  and it should avoid constantly interfering  to  avoid\r\n\r\njerking  the  property  market around with  many  piecemeal  and\r\n\r\nseemingly uncoordinated measures, sometimes affecting the demand\r\n\r\nand  sometimes affecting the supply, as I have said in my Budget\r\n\r\nspeech.  So I feel that the Minister should not have changed the\r\n\r\nland  sales policy.  In fact, if the market knows the volume  of\r\n\r\nland  available  year after year, the market  would  have  taken\r\n\r\nthese  into  account.  Therefore, in the long term, this  should\r\n\r\nnot be a major factor affecting property prices.  So I feel that\r\n\r\nthe land sales should have continued in the last two quarters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other issue I have, with the recent announcement of tax\r\n\r\nexemption  for land under development, is that this will  induce\r\n\r\ndevelopers  to  develop vacant land that does not enjoy  similar\r\n\r\nexemption, thus adding to the supply of private housing  already\r\n\r\navailable, and this would negate the intended impact of the  new\r\n\r\ntax measure, as the developers accelerate the development of the\r\n\r\nvacant land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I would like to call on the Minister to\r\n\r\nminimise interference in the property market and be involved  in\r\n\r\nonly setting the long term directions and not to give in to  the\r\n\r\nlobbying and the pressure from the developer groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, in the Government's sale of land\r\n\r\nsites, substantial time and resources are committed by tenderers\r\n\r\nin  their  bids  to  secure Government land.   In  an  uncertain\r\n\r\nmarket,  such as what we have today, wide-ranging  bids  may  be\r\n\r\nexpected, for example, for the Marina South site.  And this is a\r\n\r\nlandmark site that involves a multi-million dollar investment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the poor market sentiments, in this instance, may\r\n\r\ninvite  bidders  looking for bargain prices and those  tenderers\r\n\r\nwho  do  not wish to lose out may put up unexpectedly low  bids.\r\n\r\nSuch   low  bids  may,  in  the  already  weak  market,   be   a\r\n\r\ndestabilising force.  This will undermine the stability  of  the\r\n\r\nproperty market and, of course, the economy as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although these low bid prices may eventually be\r\n\r\nascertained  by  the  Chief  Valuer as  below  the  Government's\r\n\r\nreserve  price, the detrimental effects on the market will  have\r\n\r\nalready been done.  Therefore, I am in favour of some form of  a\r\n\r\npublic  declaration of reserve prices in general land sales,  so\r\n\r\nas  not  to affect the market adversely or wasting the  valuable\r\n\r\ntime of developers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should perhaps apply this approach for a landmark\r\n\r\nparcel,  like  the Marina South.  In this instance,  it  may  be\r\n\r\nbetter  to  have a situation where there are no bidders  because\r\n\r\nthere  is  not enough financial capacity of developers  to  bid,\r\n\r\nrather than entertaining a small number of bidders with very low\r\n\r\nprices.   Low  prices can shake the confidence of  the  property\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for tenderers who believe that the price should be\r\n\r\nlower  than the reserve price, they will not have to waste  time\r\n\r\nand  resources in the exercise.  Just as an example, the  tender\r\n\r\nfor  the  Marina South site requires each tenderer to put  in  a\r\n\r\ntender  deposit of at least 10% of the tender sale  price.   The\r\n\r\nmarket  talk  is  that  this land will be  valued  at  about  $1\r\n\r\nbillion.   10% of $1 billion or up to $1.2 billion is a  deposit\r\n\r\nof  some  $100  million.   So  over a  three-month  period,  the\r\n\r\ndeveloper  will be committing something like about $100  million\r\n\r\nof  his  funds.  Adding professional cost and interest cost  may\r\n\r\nmean a tender bid costing something like $3 million.  Sir, these\r\n\r\nfunds will be locked up for unproductive purposes.  I would urge\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to perhaps reconsider some form of bidding whereby\r\n\r\nreserve  prices are known so that there will not be a  situation\r\n\r\nwhereby  low  prices affect the property market.   At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime, developers will not waste time because they know that they\r\n\r\ndo  not have the financial capacity to do a project of a certain\r\n\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Sir, my speech\r\n\r\nin  the  Budget debate last year I spoke on the same issue.   At\r\n\r\nthat  time  I  pointed out three points: (1) The Government  has\r\n\r\ncommitted to the long-term objective of achieving a 25%  to  30%\r\n\r\nof   private  residential  property  to  be  private.   (2)  The\r\n\r\nGovernment is the largest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nland  owner in Singapore.  It must take a long term view in land\r\n\r\nsupply  and  gradually release sufficient land to  realise  this\r\n\r\nobjective.   The  Government's supply  of  land  should  not  be\r\n\r\naffected  by short term fluctuations of property price.   (3)  I\r\n\r\npointed out that the private residential property price then was\r\n\r\ntoo high and beyond the affordable level of the targeted top 30%\r\n\r\nincome  earners.   In the long term, the 30% target  of  private\r\n\r\nresidential  property could only be achieved if  the  price  was\r\n\r\nsettled at a level which was affordable to them.  At that  time,\r\n\r\nthe reply from the Minister was quite favourable, in particular,\r\n\r\non  the  issue of land price and, I quote, \"The Government  will\r\n\r\nnot  interfere in the private housing market in as far as target\r\n\r\nprices are concerned.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the slowdown in the residential market, the\r\n\r\nGovernment in November 1997 announced that the land sale  target\r\n\r\nfor  the  rest  of 1997 would be deferred to the first  half  of\r\n\r\n1998.   And  the 1998 figure would be pushed back to the  second\r\n\r\nhalf  of  1998.  In the recent Budget Statement, it  was  stated\r\n\r\nthat  land sales for 7,000 units, ie, the combined 1997 deferred\r\n\r\nquantity and the targeted 1998 quantity would be reduced to only\r\n\r\n2,500  units.  From 7,000 units to 2,500 units is a  substantial\r\n\r\nreduction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what is the Government's\r\n\r\nlong-term  policy  in land supply.  Our private  property  price\r\n\r\naffects the Government's land sales.  If so, will the Government\r\n\r\ncut  back or stop the land sale from what was announced  if  the\r\n\r\ndownward  trend in property price continues, until there  is  an\r\n\r\nupturn again?  The Government also announced a cut back in  land\r\n\r\nallocated  for  Executive Condominiums from  the  planned  3,000\r\n\r\nunits  to  half, 1,500 units.  The reason given  in  the  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement  is that demand has been reduced and that is  why  the\r\n\r\nnumber has been reduced by half.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Executive Condominiums, though related to the private\r\n\r\nresidential  property, have its own targeted buyers.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nsandwich  housing programme for those who cannot afford  private\r\n\r\ncondominiums but aspire to be in the list of public housing  for\r\n\r\nExecutive flats and which the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHDB  has  ceased  taking  in new applicants.   The  Government's\r\n\r\ncommitment  to  Executive  Condominium  housing  is  to  provide\r\n\r\npartial  subsidy  in  land cost.  The first  few  launches  were\r\n\r\nexceptionally successful.  All units were taken up.   Thanks  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government which subsidises the Executive Condominium  when\r\n\r\nit  was  then sold at about $410 per sq ft.  The price was  very\r\n\r\nmuch  lower  and  attractive compared to an  equivalent  private\r\n\r\ncondominium  which was then sold at about $700 per  sq  ft.   As\r\n\r\ntime goes by, things change.  The price of a private condominium\r\n\r\nhas  gone all the way down, from $700 per sq ft to $500-plus per\r\n\r\nsq  ft, and in a recent case, a project in Woodlands was selling\r\n\r\nfor  only  $410  per  sq  ft.  On the  contrary,  the  Executive\r\n\r\nCondominium price has moved up slowly to $450 per sq ft.  It  is\r\n\r\nno  wonder only half the number of units in the recent launch of\r\n\r\nthe Executive Condominiums were taken up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must understand that Executive Condominium housing\r\n\r\nis  sandwiched  in  between  the private  condominiums  and  HDB\r\n\r\nExecutive flats.  There are strings attached to the buyer and it\r\n\r\nreceives  a  Government subsidy.  The project will fail  if  the\r\n\r\nprice is too close or exceeds that of private condominiums.  The\r\n\r\npresent dilemma faced by the property developers who tender  for\r\n\r\nExecutive Condominium lands is the result of misjudgment of  the\r\n\r\nprice  trend.   We must continue to release land  for  Executive\r\n\r\nCondominiums  in  such a way that provides  an  opportunity  for\r\n\r\nExecutive Condominium price to realign itself in relation to the\r\n\r\nprivate  condominium  price and to find a comfortable  level  at\r\n\r\nwhich  the  targeted sandwich group of buyers would accept.   To\r\n\r\nhold up or reduce land sale will deprive the market from finding\r\n\r\nits  own  price level.  Any outcome resulting from  the  current\r\n\r\nGovernment measure in the Executive Condominium land price  will\r\n\r\nbe man-made and artificial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a dream of many Singaporeans to own condominiums\r\n\r\nthrough the path of the Executive Condominium Scheme.

Mr\r\n\r\nZulkifli.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister to refine the Executive Condominium Scheme in  view  of\r\n\r\nthe  poor demand for such properties.  Not too long ago, one  of\r\n\r\nthe  main  fears  of  young Singaporeans and  would-be  property\r\n\r\nowners  is  that private property ownership would be beyond  the\r\n\r\nreach  of many Singaporeans, especially professionals, graduates\r\n\r\nand  HDB  upgraders.  The property sector also had a  number  of\r\n\r\nimperfections.   One, the gap between prices  of  HDB  Executive\r\n\r\nflats  and  private  property  is  so  huge  to  make  upgrading\r\n\r\nfinancially  prohibitive.   What  was  needed  was  to  have   a\r\n\r\ncontinuum   of   housing  options  to  serve   different   price\r\n\r\nstructures.   A  gradual  and narrower  gap  between  prices  of\r\n\r\ndifferent  housing types facilitate mobility and  upgrading  and\r\n\r\ngive  incentives and motivation for those who aspire to  improve\r\n\r\ntheir standard of housing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the EC in August 1995 meets this\r\n\r\nobjective.   When 2,000 units were brought into  the  market  in\r\n\r\n1996  and  4,000  in 1997, the sheer size and  number  of  units\r\n\r\nintroduced  made  the EC a major factor in  the  local  property\r\n\r\nmarket.   In  fact, it brought about a huge relief  to  the  so-called  \"sandwich\" class, the first layer of HDB  upgraders  and\r\n\r\nfirst time owners who felt that they have been priced out of the\r\n\r\nprivate residential market\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat that time.  Unfortunately, those who have been rescued by the\r\n\r\n\"sandwich\"  class  by the introduction of the EC  still  remains\r\n\r\nsandwiched today as prices of residential market have fallen  to\r\n\r\nEC  levels.  Some developers now find themselves unable to break\r\n\r\neven  if  ECs  are  sold  at current prices.   There  have  been\r\n\r\nsuggestions that EC should be scrapped.  With prices of  private\r\n\r\nresidential   properties  falling  buyers  will  not   find   EC\r\n\r\nattractive, especially when it comes to restrictions not present\r\n\r\nin private properties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on the contrary, I would argue that the philosophy\r\n\r\nand  concept of EC remains relevant today as it was when it  was\r\n\r\nfirst   introduced.   Yes,  the  market  may   have   made   ECs\r\n\r\nunattractive and unsaleable today.  But what if the market takes\r\n\r\nan  upswing?  A new sandwich class will emerge again.   The  ECs\r\n\r\nmust  remain relevant in the long run.  It is critical  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  different housing options to meet the aspirations  of  our\r\n\r\npeople  at  prices that are gradual to make upgrading  possible.\r\n\r\nAs  we all know, a flat is more than just a home.  It represents\r\n\r\na hope that many Singaporeans share, that they want to work hard\r\n\r\nto buy a property, the biggest that they can possibly afford for\r\n\r\ntheir  own comfort and perhaps leave something behind for future\r\n\r\ngenerations.   But for EC to remain viable and relevant  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture,  it must survive in the short run.  Refinements need  to\r\n\r\nbe  made  to  the  EC  in  order  to  be  responsive  to  market\r\n\r\nconditions.   It  cannot remain rigid in  the  face  of  rapidly\r\n\r\nchanging economic scenarios.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to consider some of these\r\n\r\nsuggestions.   (1) remove or reduce the resale levy  imposed  on\r\n\r\nHDB  upgraders  who  purchase ECs.  HDB upgraders  who  purchase\r\n\r\nprivate property need not pay such a levy.  So why not the cases\r\n\r\nof  EC?   (2) consider allowing CPF to be used for part  or  the\r\n\r\nentire  portion  of the initial 20% for purchase  of  ECs.   (3)\r\n\r\nallow preferential interest on loan for the remaining 80% of the\r\n\r\npurchase  price, similar to that of purchases of HDB  flat.   If\r\n\r\nneed be, this can be made available for, say, a five-year period\r\n\r\nafter  which  purchasers can then obtain  loans  from  banks  at\r\n\r\ncommercial  rates.  (4) for developers, perhaps  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallow developers a longer period to complete their projects  and\r\n\r\nwaive   penalties  imposed  on  developers  for   delaying   the\r\n\r\ncompletion of their projects in view of the current slump in the\r\n\r\nproperty market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EC has been a good concept and introduced at a time\r\n\r\nwhen  it  was most needed.  Market conditions, however, made  it\r\n\r\nappear   irrelevant  and  unnecessary  today.    However,   with\r\n\r\nrefinements,  it  can  not only address and  respond  to  market\r\n\r\nconditions  but  also  ensure that  the  objective  of  ensuring\r\n\r\nmobility  to  meet the aspirations of our people to upgrade  and\r\n\r\nimprove themselves is still relevant and should be preserved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Upgrading of private residential estates.\r\n\r\nThe Government has spent billions of dollars so far on upgrading\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  estates,  both in the Main and the  Interim  Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgrammes.  I do not think the residents of the private housing\r\n\r\nestates begrudge the HDB dwellers of old estates the benefit  of\r\n\r\nthis  policy  to  prevent old HDB flats from  degenerating  into\r\n\r\nslums.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is perhaps not as obvious or noticeable to the public\r\n\r\npolicy makers is that private housing estates which are very old\r\n\r\ncan  also  degenerate  into slums if no attention  is  similarly\r\n\r\ngiven.  The plan to change the legislation to facilitate the  en\r\n\r\nbloc  sales of condominiums may help to alleviate this  problem.\r\n\r\nHowever,  en bloc sales would only be viable in locations  where\r\n\r\nplot ratios have been increased significantly.  What about those\r\n\r\nwithout  the  benefit  of  increased  plot  ratios?   Many   old\r\n\r\ncondominiums have problems getting enough support to embark on a\r\n\r\nmajor upgrading because the residents, many of whom are old  and\r\n\r\nretired,  cannot  afford  to contribute  tens  of  thousands  of\r\n\r\ndollars required for a major upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether he plans to\r\n\r\nintroduce  any  measure to help old private housing  estates  to\r\n\r\nupgrade.   Could  the  Minister  consider,  for  example,   say,\r\n\r\nsubsidising 20% of the total upgrading costs of old condominiums\r\n\r\nabove  20  years old, subject to a ceiling of, say, $10,000  per\r\n\r\nhousehold?  This should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napply  only  to condominiums where en bloc sales are not  viable\r\n\r\nbecause the plot ratio has not been increased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the landed private residential estates, some upgrading\r\n\r\nis  also taking place in the form of replacement of old pipes by\r\n\r\nSingapore  Power.   As  the Minister probably  knows,  Singapore\r\n\r\nPower  wants households affected to contribute to the laying  of\r\n\r\nnew pipes in the common properties, such as the road reserves or\r\n\r\ndrainage  reserves.  And the cost per household can come  up  to\r\n\r\nabout  $5,000 to $6,000.  If not enough households are  prepared\r\n\r\nto  contribute,  the residents are asked to  abandon  their  old\r\n\r\npipes  and  convert to bottled gas.  This has upset many  landed\r\n\r\nproperty residents of old estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the Minster is: is it not possible for the\r\n\r\nGovernment to bear the cost of this infrastructural replacement?\r\n\r\nAfter  all, when roads and drains are replaced, for example,  in\r\n\r\nthe  old  private housing estates, the residents are not  called\r\n\r\nupon to shoulder the costs collectively.  Besides, residents  in\r\n\r\nthe  private housing estates believe that the then PUB had  made\r\n\r\nenough money from gas subscribers to build up a sinking fund  to\r\n\r\npay for these infrastructural replacements.  I hope the Minister\r\n\r\ncan comment on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next issue related to upgrading here is regarding the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  residents associations  (RAs).   In  the  HDB\r\n\r\nestates,  we  have RCs while condominiums have their  management\r\n\r\ncorporations.   Both of these have centres or  clubhouses  where\r\n\r\nthe  residents can meet to socialise.  I believe we  should  try\r\n\r\nthe same and establish RAs in landed housing estates in order to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  and  build neighbourliness among the  people  living\r\n\r\nthere.   But to facilitate this, they need a small clubhouse  to\r\n\r\nuse for meetings and social activities.  I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether he could consider setting aside some land  for\r\n\r\nRAs to establish such a clubhouse.  This will make it easier for\r\n\r\nRAs to be established in the landed housing estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Government\r\n\r\nhas been  upgrading the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nolder  HDB  estates under the Main Upgrading Programme  and  the\r\n\r\nInterim Upgrading Programme,  costing the public a lot of money.\r\n\r\nThe  Government has announced that it will also  be  doing  some\r\n\r\nupgrading work for private estates.  But up to now, no  specific\r\n\r\nmeasure   has   been  announced.   Residents  in   the   private\r\n\r\nresidential estates are anxious to know when the Government will\r\n\r\ncommence the upgrading work for them and what will be the extent\r\n\r\nof the upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some private residential estates were built many years\r\n\r\nago.   The  roads  are very narrow and parking spaces  are  very\r\n\r\nlimited.   Right  now,  some families in  the  private  estates,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  middle-aged couples, have  grown-up  children\r\n\r\nliving  together with them, and they own more than one car.   In\r\n\r\nmost  cases,  there is only parking space for one   car  in  the\r\n\r\ncompound  of  the house. The other cars will have to  be  parked\r\n\r\noutside, along the roadside.  For the rather narrow roads within\r\n\r\nthe residential estate, the roads become even  narrower with the\r\n\r\ncars  being parked along the roadside, and it is very  difficult\r\n\r\nfor  vehicles  to move around.  The neighbours may  complain  as\r\n\r\nthey  are inconvenienced, not just occasionally but day  in  and\r\n\r\nday out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, in the private residential estates, there\r\n\r\nis  usually  very  little open space or public  garden  for  the\r\n\r\nresidents  to enjoy themselves during their leisure hours.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of National Development should consider helping  these\r\n\r\nprivate   residential   estates  in   improving   their   living\r\n\r\nenvironment.   For example, the Government can buy  over  a  few\r\n\r\nadjoining houses in a highly congested estate, demolish them and\r\n\r\nbuild  a  small  garden  there or  a  small  car  park  for  the\r\n\r\nconvenience  of the residents to park their cars  and  to  enjoy\r\n\r\ntheir leisure.  Apart from that, there may be other improvements\r\n\r\nand upgrading works, such as widening the roads, resurfacing the\r\n\r\nroads  or  to  convert the overhanging cables  into  underground\r\n\r\ncables and to alter the gradients of the drains to prevent water\r\n\r\nstagnation.  All these measures can further improve  the living\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenvironment  of private residential estates.

I am surprised\r\n\r\nto hear such a long wish list from Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first address the key issue raised by several\r\n\r\nMembers,  ie, what is Government's role in the private  property\r\n\r\nmarket.   Mr  Lew  Syn Pau stressed that the  Government  should\r\n\r\nstrive for stability in the property market.  Mr Inderjit  Singh\r\n\r\nasked  that the Government not intervene in the market  and  let\r\n\r\nthe  free  market settle the private property prices.    Earlier\r\n\r\non, during the debate on the Budget, several Members such as  Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit  Singh, Mr Simon Tay and Mr Chuang felt that there  had\r\n\r\nbeen  too much Government intervention and support given to  the\r\n\r\nproperty sector and property developers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate what the\r\n\r\nGovernment's role in the private property market is.  First, can\r\n\r\nthe Government adopt a completely hands-off approach and let the\r\n\r\nfree market reign in the private property market?  The answer is\r\n\r\nno.   The  property  market is closely  linked  to  the  overall\r\n\r\neconomy  and the stability of the financial system.   More  than\r\n\r\n90%  of  Singaporeans  own  their  homes.   No  government  can,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  take a completely hands-off approach to the  private\r\n\r\nproperty market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that the private property market will go\r\n\r\nthrough the business cycles.  Prices will go up and prices  will\r\n\r\ncome  down.  The Government has no intention of fixing  property\r\n\r\nprice levels, nor can it do so.   The Government does not have a\r\n\r\ntarget  price  level  to reach.  However,  the  Government  will\r\n\r\nintervene in the property market when it is necessary to prevent\r\n\r\nexcessive  swings  in  the market.  This  is  because  a  severe\r\n\r\noverheating of the property market or a crash will have  serious\r\n\r\nramifications on the real economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason why the Government cannot take a completely\r\n\r\nhands-off approach is because the Government itself is  involved\r\n\r\nin  land  sales.   At  the end of the day, the  Government  must\r\n\r\ndecide  how  much land to sell, and that will affect the  supply\r\n\r\nside of the equation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Government's role in the property market?\r\n\r\nFirst,  the  Government  will monitor the  property  market  and\r\n\r\ndampen  excessive  volatility that  can  undermine  the  overall\r\n\r\nfinancial  and economic stability of the country.   Second,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   will   always  ensure  that  property   loans   for\r\n\r\ndevelopment and for mortgages are within prudent limits.  Third,\r\n\r\nthe  Government will release sufficient land to meet the  medium\r\n\r\nterm   demand.    Finally,  the  Government  encourages   market\r\n\r\ntransparency  by making clear Government's land  sale  programme\r\n\r\nahead of time and providing timely and comprehensive information\r\n\r\non  property stocks, occupancy and potential supply.  At the end\r\n\r\nof  the day, market forces will settle the price levels, not the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue which was raised by the MPs is that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  appeared to be passive when the property market  was\r\n\r\nrising  a few years ago, and now seem to be actively intervening\r\n\r\nwhen  the  market is declining.  Let me set the record straight.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  market went up sharply in 1993 and 1994, it reflected\r\n\r\nthe very strong double digit economic growth then.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nthe  region  was booming.  Foreign funds flowed into the  region\r\n\r\nand into Singapore.  As we all know, the region is now suffering\r\n\r\nfrom the excesses of that period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before 1987, the Government planned on the basis that\r\n\r\npublic  housing will constitute 90% of homes in  Singapore.   We\r\n\r\nrealise that this did not reflect the rising incomes and  rising\r\n\r\nexpectations  of  Singaporeans.  So  in  1990,  we  announced  a\r\n\r\nsystematic  Government  land  sales  programme  to  inject  more\r\n\r\nprivate  housing  units into the market.  We  started  off  with\r\n\r\n1,500  units in 1990, rising gradually to 3,000 units  in  1993.\r\n\r\nWhen  prices  started  to rise sharply in 1993,  the  Government\r\n\r\nstepped up its annual land sales from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3,000  units in 1993 to 4,000 units in 1994, and then  to  6,000\r\n\r\nunits in 1995, to meet the increased demand for private housing.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is  not possible for the Government to set a fixed  land\r\n\r\nsales and expect to operate as an auto pilot.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know Prof. Low Seow Chay himself argued for more land\r\n\r\nsales  when the property prices were going up.  Many MPs did  so\r\n\r\nin  1993 and 1994.  So it is not possible when prices are coming\r\n\r\ndown  to  say that Government stay clear and do nothing at  all.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  the Government introduced Executive Condominiums  in\r\n\r\n1995  to make private housing more affordable to a certain group\r\n\r\nof people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the private property market stabilised for the first\r\n\r\nnine  months  in  1995, we thought we had  solved  the  problem.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the property market started to overheat again  at  the\r\n\r\nend  of  1995  and in early 1996.  The Government  then  had  to\r\n\r\nintroduce the anti-speculation measures in May 1996.   This  was\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  curb   market excesses and prevent  the  property\r\n\r\nbubble  from  further ballooning, as this would  have  made  the\r\n\r\nsubsequent market correction even more drastic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why I explained the history is to show that the\r\n\r\nGovernment anticipated the strong demand for private housing, as\r\n\r\nearly  as  1989.  If the Government did not inject more  private\r\n\r\nhousing  into  the  market  through the  Government  land  sales\r\n\r\nprogramme,  prices would have gone up much higher in  the  early\r\n\r\n1990s.  Again, if the Government did not intervene in May  1996,\r\n\r\nthe  property  market would also have risen much  higher  and  a\r\n\r\nsubsequent correction more painful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when the markets do go up, people get caught up in it,\r\n\r\nand think that prices would not fall.  We can call it exuberance\r\n\r\nor  we  can call it euphoria.  Similarly, when markets  do  come\r\n\r\ndown,  there is gloom and doom.  People stay away.   The  market\r\n\r\ndeclines further and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.   It\r\n\r\nis not possible to prevent such cycles.  The Government can only\r\n\r\ntake limited action to moderate the excesses of such cycles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the middle of last year, the economic landscape has\r\n\r\nchanged  substantially.    There is  now  an  excess  supply  of\r\n\r\nproperties  and  a  contraction of demand due  to  uncertainties\r\n\r\narising  from the regional economic turmoil.  Under the  present\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  it  will not be prudent for  the  Government  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  with  the  land sales at the same  level  as  previous\r\n\r\nyears.  This is because releasing more land than the market  can\r\n\r\nabsorb  will  exacerbate  the downward  swing  of  the  property\r\n\r\nmarket.  The Government has thus decided to suspend the sales of\r\n\r\nsites  for 2,500 residential units to the second half  of  1998.\r\n\r\nHowever,  let  me  assure the House that the Government  remains\r\n\r\ncommitted to releasing sufficient land over the medium  term  to\r\n\r\nmeet   Singaporeans'  aspirations  to  own  private  residential\r\n\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay asked whether we have enough units in\r\n\r\nthe medium term.  As Members have noticed, in the fourth quarter\r\n\r\n1997  land  supply  data, we have more than 40,000  units  under\r\n\r\nconstruction, of which more than half are still not sold.  8,000\r\n\r\nunits,   started  construction,  have  all  the  building   plan\r\n\r\napprovals,  launched for sale and not sold.  Another  8,600-over\r\n\r\nunits  started  construction, not yet launched  for  sale,  also\r\n\r\nunsold.   So  you  have  more than 17,000 units  in  the  market\r\n\r\nunsold,  ready  for  takers.  The Government  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nmonitor the economic and property situation carefully, and  will\r\n\r\nsell more units when the market recovers\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh asked the Government not to lift the May\r\n\r\n1996  anti-speculation  measures.   I  agree  with  him.   These\r\n\r\nmeasures  will serve us well, both in the upturn as well  as  in\r\n\r\nthe  downturn.  The Government, therefore, has no plans to  lift\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh was also concerned that the tax exemption\r\n\r\nfor  land  under  development  and  not  for  vacant  land  will\r\n\r\naccelerate  the development and thus add to the housing  supply.\r\n\r\nI do not think developers would start development and add to the\r\n\r\noversupply situation simply because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe property tax allows them to do so.  Developers will add   to\r\n\r\nthe  supply only if they think there is a demand and  that  they\r\n\r\ncan  sell  the  units  for  a profit.  Therefore,  property  tax\r\n\r\nexemption  for  land under development will not  exacerbate  the\r\n\r\nland supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan asked whether Government should lower the\r\n\r\nupfront  cash payment for housing purchase from 20% to  10%,  to\r\n\r\nhelp  young  first-timers  to  own  private  property.   I  must\r\n\r\nreiterate what Dr Richard Hu said, ie, that \"Singaporeans should\r\n\r\nonly  purchase private property only if they can afford it.   It\r\n\r\nis  not  advisable  for banks to lend or for  buyers  to  borrow\r\n\r\nbeyond what is financially prudent for them, especially at  this\r\n\r\ntime  of  economic  uncertainty.\"  The 80%  financial  limit  on\r\n\r\nmortgage loans in Singapore is still higher compared to  70%  in\r\n\r\nHong  Kong.   If young Singaporeans cannot afford the  20%  cash\r\n\r\noutlay, then they should start off with the HDB flat and upgrade\r\n\r\nto   private   property  when  they  can   better   afford   it.\r\n\r\nAlternatively,  they  can apply for the  Executive  Condominiums\r\n\r\nwhere they will be given a $40,000 CPF housing grant if they are\r\n\r\nfirst-time purchasers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok asked whether the Government will set\r\n\r\nreserve prices for land tenders.  I have discussed this with the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance and the Ministry of Law, and they are not in\r\n\r\nfavour of stipulating reserve prices for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fairly long time lag between the launch of a\r\n\r\nsale  and the closing of the tender.  For example, for the  site\r\n\r\nthat  Mr Chng mentioned, the Marina South site, there is a five-month  time  lag.   So if the Chief Valuer were  to  announce  a\r\n\r\nreserve  price in November last year and we close  in  May  this\r\n\r\nyear,  I  think his reserve price will be very much out of  sync\r\n\r\nwith  the market.  Similarly, it is not the market practice  for\r\n\r\nprivate land owners to disclose their reserve prices.  So  I  do\r\n\r\nnot see why the Government should have a practice different from\r\n\r\nthe private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to Mr Chng's comments about the results of the Marina\r\n\r\nSouth tender, I would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  want to pre-judge the results.  I agree with him that there\r\n\r\nis  a  certain upfront cost in preparing for the tender.  I will\r\n\r\nget  URA to examine how to minimise this cost, because it  is  a\r\n\r\nlarge site and we need not tie up a large deposit unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nIn  any  case, it is not that the developers are tying  up  $100\r\n\r\nmillion.  This takes the form of a banker's guarantee and so  it\r\n\r\nis not tying up capital unnecessarily.  We will examine it.  For\r\n\r\nlarge  sites, perhaps we need not have such a big  amount  as  a\r\n\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to Executive Condominiums. Let me\r\n\r\nreiterate the objective of the Executive Condominiums.  As  many\r\n\r\nMembers have highlighted, it is to satisfy those who want to buy\r\n\r\nsomething more than a HDB flat but yet cannot afford the private\r\n\r\nproperty.   We can either call it a \"sandwich housing\",  we  can\r\n\r\ncall it a hybrid between HDB and private housing.  The intention\r\n\r\nis  that since HDB now builds and sells 5-room and 4-room flats,\r\n\r\nwe think that there is a group of Singaporeans who aspire to own\r\n\r\nmore than HDB flats but cannot quite cross into private housing.\r\n\r\nThat  is why we introduced the Executive Condominiums.  We think\r\n\r\nthis concept remains valid in good times or bad, but we have  to\r\n\r\nbe  realistic.  If private property prices increase,  then  less\r\n\r\npeople  will be able to afford private property and  the  demand\r\n\r\nfor Executive Condominiums will go up.  Similarly or conversely,\r\n\r\nif  private property prices decrease, then more people would  be\r\n\r\nable to afford private property and therefore the demand for ECs\r\n\r\nwill  drop.  So it is not possible for us to set a fixed  supply\r\n\r\nof ECs and not adjust according to the market conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our estimates of what this group of people would\r\n\r\nbe, we think that out of 25,000 new households per year, between\r\n\r\n5%   and  10%  would  be  the  target  group  to  own  Executive\r\n\r\nCondominiums.  And therefore between 1,500 and 2,500 units every\r\n\r\nyear  will be the right number to sell.  We started off in  1996\r\n\r\nwith 2,000 units because of the sharp prices.  We increased  the\r\n\r\nnumber to 4,000 in 1997.  We have therefore decided to cut  back\r\n\r\nin 1998 to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1,500  units.  As you can see, if you average this out, this  is\r\n\r\nmore  or  less  the  number that we expect to  be  able  to  buy\r\n\r\nExecutive Condominiums.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of the Executive Condominiums has to settle\r\n\r\nbetween  the  HDB prices and the private property prices.   What\r\n\r\nthe  price would be will have to be determined by the market and\r\n\r\nthe developers who are building these properties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to upgrading of private housing estates. I\r\n\r\ntake  all the comments of various Members.  Let me just explain.\r\n\r\nFirst,  the  Government  has the intention  to  upgrade  private\r\n\r\nhousing  estates.   We have said this before and  we  are  still\r\n\r\ncommitted to upgrading private housing estates.  Second, what is\r\n\r\nthe  scope of this upgrading?  I am a little taken aback by  all\r\n\r\nthese suggestions about clubhouses.  I think we want to make  it\r\n\r\nquite clear that upgrading of private housing estates, as we see\r\n\r\nit  today,  will only take place in the public areas.   It  will\r\n\r\ntake the scope something like the Interim Upgrading Programme of\r\n\r\nthe  HDB for the public areas.  We are not likely to enter  into\r\n\r\nthe  common property of the condominiums, neither are we  likely\r\n\r\nto  enter into the compound of the landed property.  So I  think\r\n\r\nthe  scope is limited to the public areas.  The budget  will  be\r\n\r\nmore or less like the IUP budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question will be when do we implement the project.\r\n\r\nWe  have  hoped to implement it this year.  But because  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn, we have to postpone it.   It  will  be  very\r\n\r\ndifficult for me to explain how we can cut back on MUP  and  IUP\r\n\r\non  one  hand  and start off another programme  on  the  private\r\n\r\nhousing  estates  on  the other.  So I think  it  will  be  more\r\n\r\nprudent for us to launch this project when the economy recovers.\r\n\r\nAt  that point, we can reinstate the MUP and IUP programmes  and\r\n\r\nat  the  same time launch the programme for the private  housing\r\n\r\nestates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to Mr Lew Syn Pau's specific examples of laying of gas\r\n\r\npipes,  I think we are familiar with that issue.  The bottomline\r\n\r\nis: do you implement an upgrading programme when it is not cost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neffective, when the alternative of using bottled gas is so  much\r\n\r\nmore  cost effective?  Do you need to re-lay pipes for town  gas\r\n\r\nwhen  each household could just make use of bottled gas?  So  it\r\n\r\nis  not  just  a  question of upgrading but  also  the  economic\r\n\r\nusefulness of expending that sum of money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the establishment of RAs, I think we are supportive but\r\n\r\nnot at the price of having to build a clubhouse for every one of\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have answered most of the questions. Please\r\n\r\npoint out any other issues which I have not covered.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Sir, the upgrading of HDB estates has been\r\n\r\nwell received by most HDB residents, even though it involves  an\r\n\r\nelement  of  cost  sharing.  The only negative feedback  I  have\r\n\r\nreceived is that the contractors for the works tend to take  too\r\n\r\nlong and hence inconvenience residents for an unduly long period\r\n\r\nof time of between two and three years, because they work on too\r\n\r\nmany  blocks  (about  10 to 15 blocks) at  the  same  time.   My\r\n\r\nquestion to the Minister is: would it not be possible to get the\r\n\r\ncontractors  to work on a fewer number of blocks  at  one  time,\r\n\r\nsay, three to five blocks, so that they can shorten the duration\r\n\r\nof  the upgrading works to just one to two years, instead of two\r\n\r\nto three years?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, my topic is on upgrading of 1- and 2-room flats. The HDB's upgrading programme has been a success.\r\n\r\nOlder  flats  were rejuvenated to improve the living environment\r\n\r\nof   those   who  have  supported  the  Government's   upgrading\r\n\r\nprogramme.  But due to the criteria for selection, many  of  the\r\n\r\nflats  upgraded  are 3-room flats.  Not much has  been  done  to\r\n\r\nupgrade 1- and 2-room flats in the HDB estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, there are about 3,200 units of 1- and 2-room\r\n\r\nflats  in Singapore.  Most of these flats are rented out to  low\r\n\r\nincome  families, including older Singaporeans.  Many  of  these\r\n\r\nflats  were  built  in  the 70s and 80s and  do  not  have  many\r\n\r\nfacilities, especially for the senior citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I lived in a 1-room flat for six years. I understand\r\n\r\nthe  plight  of  these  residents.  I  understand  their  living\r\n\r\nconditions.    I   am   sure  Singaporeans  will   support   any\r\n\r\nGovernment's  effort to improve the living conditions  of  these\r\n\r\nfellow Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would strongly urge the Ministry to consider\r\n\r\nimplementing upgrading programmes for 1- and 2-room  HDB  flats.\r\n\r\nAs  these are mainly rented flats, HDB should bear the full cost\r\n\r\nof  upgrading,  thus alleviating any financial burden  on  these\r\n\r\nresidents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, upgrading of HDB flats, in\r\n\r\nparticular  IUP.  The present grant given to IUP is  $6,000  per\r\n\r\nhousehold and if lift upgrading is included, the grant is $7,000\r\n\r\nper household.  I have the experience of managing two IUPs in my\r\n\r\nprecinct  in  the Moulmein ward in the last few years.   And  my\r\n\r\nconclusion  is  that  the  budget of  $7,000  per  household  is\r\n\r\nactually  very, very tight for lift upgrading.  This is because,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  slab  blocks require two to three lifts  per  upgraded\r\n\r\nblock  and lift upgrading is a very expensive project  but  very\r\n\r\nessential  for residents, especially older residents.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nas a result of costly lift upgrading, there is very little money\r\n\r\nleft  for  other block works and precinct upgrading, some  basic\r\n\r\nfacilities  for children and other residents.  And even  if  one\r\n\r\nspends  very  little amount on these fancy horticultural  works,\r\n\r\nthere is still not enough for precinct upgrading facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister two questions:\r\n\r\nFirst,  whether he can consider increasing the funding  for  the\r\n\r\nIUPs that embark on lift upgrading and, if that is not possible,\r\n\r\nas  he  said  last  year, can he consider lift  upgrading  as  a\r\n\r\nseparate  programme, like IUP and MUP?  This question  was  also\r\n\r\nbeing  asked  last  year.  The second question  really  is  that\r\n\r\nwhether  blocks which are four or five storeys can be considered\r\n\r\nfor  lift  programme, as Mr Ang Mong Seng had  brought  up  last\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, I welcome the\r\n\r\nannouncement  that  the  number  of  precincts,  which  will  be\r\n\r\nselected  this year for Main Upgrading, has been reduced.   Some\r\n\r\npeople have questioned whether the Government is going\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nback  on  its promise on upgrading.  But I believe the  downward\r\n\r\nadjustment in the MUP schedule is prudent when we consider  this\r\n\r\nissue  from  the perspective of flat owners who are  or  may  be\r\n\r\naffected by the on-going economic downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the Main Upgrading Programme has\r\n\r\nproven  to  be  very popular with HDB flat owners and  they  had\r\n\r\nhappily voted in favour of the upgrading and shared the cost  of\r\n\r\nupgrading during better times.  Under the cost-sharing  formula,\r\n\r\ndepending  on  the  room-type and the  upgrading  package,  flat\r\n\r\nowners  have to pay between 7% and 42% of the cost of upgrading.\r\n\r\nFor  the Basic Package, a 1-, 2- or 3-room flat owner would have\r\n\r\nto  contribute  $2,200  for  the  cost  of  upgrading.   For  an\r\n\r\nExecutive flat owner under the Standard-Plus Package, the amount\r\n\r\npayable is $28,500.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this monetary outlay can prove to be a great\r\n\r\nburden,  especially at a difficult time like  this.   We  should\r\n\r\ntherefore  also  consider  whether,  in  this  present  economic\r\n\r\nclimate,  it is fair or reasonable to expect the HDB flat  owner\r\n\r\nto  spend that kind of money on the upgrading and beautification\r\n\r\nof  this  precinct and his flat.  Or, would the  flat  owner  be\r\n\r\nbetter  off investing the money in things which will  bring  him\r\n\r\nlong  term benefits and returns?  For example, with $2,200 which\r\n\r\nthe  1-,  2-  or  3-room flat owner has to  pay  for  the  Basic\r\n\r\nPackage,  he  could buy a Pentium multimedia  computer  for  his\r\n\r\nchild.   And,  in the case of the Executive flat owner  for  the\r\n\r\nStandard-Plus  Package, with $28,500, he  could  see  his  child\r\n\r\nthrough four years of tertiary education in our NUS or NTU.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has announced that with slower economic\r\n\r\ngrowth, the MUP has been adjusted downwards this year.  However,\r\n\r\nthis  does  not  mean  that residents have  lost  out  on  their\r\n\r\nupgrading forever.  The Minister for Finance has assured us that\r\n\r\nthe pace of the programme is dependent on the size of the budget\r\n\r\nsurplus.   Therefore, when the economy recovers in  due  course,\r\n\r\nperhaps  in  the  year 2000 or 2001, and we have  larger  budget\r\n\r\nsurpluses  at that time, the number of upgrading precincts  will\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, urge those who question the Government's\r\n\r\ndecision  to slow down the pace of the Main Upgrading  Programme\r\n\r\nat this time to consider whether it is prudent and wiser, in the\r\n\r\nlight of the present uncertainty and economic climate, for  flat\r\n\r\nowners  to  direct  their  resources to  other  more  productive\r\n\r\ninvestments  and uses.  After all, one of the main  reasons  why\r\n\r\nThailand  ran into financial difficulties was that  it  borrowed\r\n\r\nand spent too much on non-productive property developments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam See Tong is not here. Mr Zainul.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, I agree with Mr Ong that in\r\n\r\nthese  days  of  austerity  the  rescheduling  of  the  MUP   is\r\n\r\nunderstandable.   But I must say that when Government  announced\r\n\r\nthat  the MUP schedule will be slowed down to 10 precincts, many\r\n\r\nwere disappointed.  I think my GRC chief, Mr Lee Yock Suan, will\r\n\r\nknow  that.   Even  my residents in Punggol  East  were  looking\r\n\r\nforward  to their own IUP and MUP.  They were hoping that  their\r\n\r\nturn  could  come sooner than later.  As we know, originally  15\r\n\r\nprecincts were scheduled a year from 1996 to the year 2000.  But\r\n\r\nI am sure many will also understand, pending improvements in the\r\n\r\neconomic outlook of the region, they will have to live with this\r\n\r\nnew situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in view of the expectations raised earlier, I\r\n\r\nwonder, Sir, whether the Minister would continue to monitor  the\r\n\r\neconomic situation closely and review the MUP schedule  as  soon\r\n\r\nas  possible.   In  addition to the question of surpluses,  what\r\n\r\nother  criteria  would be used, whether, in fact,  the  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth rates and developments in the region would also be  taken\r\n\r\ninto consideration to determine the scale of the review.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, my topic is on lift upgrading. In\r\n\r\nland-scarce  Singapore,  the majority of  Singaporeans  have  no\r\n\r\nchoice but to live in high-rise flats.  As we move into the next\r\n\r\nmillennium, Singaporeans are more likely to be living in 30-  or\r\n\r\n40-storey  flats.  Living in high-rise buildings  can  be  quite\r\n\r\ncomfortable  provided we have a reliable and safe  lift  system.\r\n\r\nIf the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlifts fail frequently, many residents will be inconvenienced and\r\n\r\nsome  may  be trapped in the lifts.  Thus, it is important  that\r\n\r\nlifts  are  maintained,  upgraded and  replaced  accordingly  to\r\n\r\nensure that they function properly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the HDB, the recommended replacement cycle of\r\n\r\na lift is 28 years.  However, in practice, most lifts will begin\r\n\r\nto  give problems after 15 years of operation.  The average lift\r\n\r\nbreakdown  rate for HDB flats is 0.3 per lift per  month.   This\r\n\r\nmeans  that  3% of HDB lifts (that is about 3,000  lifts)  break\r\n\r\ndown  monthly.  This is definitely not acceptable if we were  to\r\n\r\nlive  in 30-storey buildings.  In the Interim and Main Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgrammes, lift upgrading is not a standard item of  work.   As\r\n\r\nsuch, some IUP and MUP did not upgrade or replace the lifts  due\r\n\r\nto  budget constraint.  It costs about $95,000 to replace a lift\r\n\r\nfor  a  12-storey  block  with three lift  landings,  while  the\r\n\r\nreplacement  of  a lift for a 12-storey block with  12  landings\r\n\r\nwill cost approximately $175,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I hope the Government will consider increasing the\r\n\r\ngrant  for  both  IUP  and  MUP programmes.   In  addition,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  must  specify  lift  upgrading  or  replacement  as  a\r\n\r\nstandard item of work for all IUP and MUP.  Where possible,  all\r\n\r\nupgraded blocks must have lift landing at every floor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the private residential flats, there is presently no\r\n\r\nprovision  in  the  Land  Titles (Strata)  Act  stipulating  the\r\n\r\npercentage of contribution for sinking fund.  As a result,  some\r\n\r\nmanagement  corporations, especially the older condominiums,  do\r\n\r\nnot  make adequate provision for the replacement of their lifts.\r\n\r\nThe   replacement  of  lifts  is  a  costly  exercise  and  some\r\n\r\nmanagement corporations encounter difficulty in raising funds to\r\n\r\ncarry out such works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would like to urge the Government to consider\r\n\r\nproviding  a  grant  or  tax incentive  for  owners  of  private\r\n\r\nresidential flats to upgrade their lifts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, since the last economic downturn in\r\n\r\n1985,  Singaporeans have enjoyed more than a decade of  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth.   This has formed the basis on which many families  plan\r\n\r\nfinancially  for their future.  Therefore, it is  understandable\r\n\r\nhow the present economic downturn has taken many Singaporeans by\r\n\r\nsurprise  and upset their financial planning.  This is  probably\r\n\r\nnowhere  more obvious than in financial plans for one  necessity\r\n\r\nclose to everyone's heart, and that is housing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our consistent economic growth over the past decade has led\r\n\r\nmany  a  Singaporean  to project their ability  to  finance  the\r\n\r\npurchase of a home on the basis of assumptions, such as,  first,\r\n\r\na  stable  income.  Until recently, most Singaporeans  can  look\r\n\r\nforward  to good annual salary increments year after year  in  a\r\n\r\ncompetitive  job  market.  Second, the  rising  property  market\r\n\r\nwhere  an  investment  in property will almost  certainly  yield\r\n\r\nprofits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no wonder that many applicants for new HDB flats opt\r\n\r\nfor  the bigger room types.  As at 31st January 1998, 57% of the\r\n\r\n131,100 applicants on the HDB waiting list have opted to buy a 5-room  flat.   In 1997, 59% of the new applicants for 4-room  and\r\n\r\nbigger  flats have opted for 5-room flats, compared  to  36%  in\r\n\r\n1991.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the light of the present economic crisis, these\r\n\r\nassumptions are not reliable.  Family income might not  increase\r\n\r\nas  projected but could even decline because of retrenchment and\r\n\r\nlower bonuses and increments.  HDB flats on the resale market no\r\n\r\nlonger command the same premium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would therefore urge the HDB to consider the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  faced by the following three broad  categories  of\r\n\r\nHDB  lessees.  The first group are new applicants who are in the\r\n\r\nqueue for flats which are now beyond their means.  Could the HDB\r\n\r\nallow and facilitate this group of applicants to opt for smaller\r\n\r\nflats  instead?  If such applicants have to go ahead to complete\r\n\r\ntheir  purchase, they would probably face increasing  difficulty\r\n\r\nin  fulfilling their repayment obligations under their  mortgage\r\n\r\nloan financing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it would be most helpful at times like these that\r\n\r\nsuch  applicants,  who have miscalculated their  future  earning\r\n\r\ncapability,  be  permitted to select  smaller  flats  and  hence\r\n\r\nlessen their financial burden.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second group are those who have upgraded in the last\r\n\r\ntwo  and  a  half years by buying a larger flat  in  the  resale\r\n\r\nmarket  and  are  now realising that they could  not  afford  to\r\n\r\nmaintain such a big flat.  Under existing HDB rules, they cannot\r\n\r\ndispose  the flat within two-and-a-half years of purchasing  it.\r\n\r\nFor  such  families  who  are  compelled  by  circumstances   to\r\n\r\ndowngrade,  could the Minister consider relaxing this  rule  and\r\n\r\npermit  them to sell their flats in the open market in order  to\r\n\r\npurchase a smaller one again from the open market?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third group are existing flat owners who, because of a\r\n\r\nchange  in  their  financial circumstances arising  out  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  economic crisis, are not facing difficulties in meeting\r\n\r\nthe  obligations  under  the mortgage  loan  repayments.   Under\r\n\r\nsection 56(1)(k) of the Housing and Development Act, the HDB has\r\n\r\nthe  power  to compulsorily acquire the flat on the ground  that\r\n\r\nthe lessee is owing the HDB arrears of monthly instalments.  The\r\n\r\nHDB has served section 56 Notices in the past for debts as small\r\n\r\nas a few thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a good year like 1996, of the 407,200 households with\r\n\r\nmortgage loan account, four defaulted on their payments and  had\r\n\r\ntheir  flats repossessed by the HDB.  Given the present economic\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  we can expect this number to increase.   In  the\r\n\r\nfourth  quarter  of 1997 alone, 4,278 workers  lost  their  jobs\r\n\r\nbecause of retrenchment.  More workers are likely to be laid off\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it cannot be easy for these retrenched workers,\r\n\r\nespecially  those  who  are  sole breadwinners  of  large  young\r\n\r\nfamilies, to face the prospect of losing the family's roof  over\r\n\r\ntheir  heads  because they have difficulties  meeting  the  loan\r\n\r\nrepayment schedule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the scheme of things in Singapore, owning a HDB flat\r\n\r\nis a heavily protected right.  Commercial creditors,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  may  be  owed  large  sums of money,  may  institute  legal\r\n\r\nproceedings  to enforce their claims and make the HDB  lessee  a\r\n\r\nbankrupt, but they cannot take over his flat, they cannot  throw\r\n\r\nhim out into the streets and take away the roof over his head.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would therefore be most ironical for the HDB, whose\r\n\r\nmission is to provide Singaporeans with affordable new HDB flats\r\n\r\nunder  the  Home  Ownership Scheme,  to  evict  the  debtor  and\r\n\r\ncompulsorily  repossess his flat to enforce  a  debt  of  a  few\r\n\r\nthousand dollars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister to take this opportunity to\r\n\r\nreassure HDB lessees that in difficult times, such as these, the\r\n\r\nHDB  would  not  evict  them  but would  view  with  sympathetic\r\n\r\nunderstanding and grant extension of time for repayment to  help\r\n\r\nthese  affected families tide over their financial  difficulties\r\n\r\narising from this economic crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan is not here. Mr Zainul.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, many policies have been\r\n\r\nintroduced by the HDB since 1992 that have pushed up  prices  of\r\n\r\nHDB  flats.  Just now, we heard from the Minister the  milestone\r\n\r\npolicy that was brought about since the 1990s.  Whether it is  a\r\n\r\nmarket valuation system adopted for mortgage loan financing, the\r\n\r\nMUP, SERS, the CPF Housing Grant, I think they all contribute to\r\n\r\nhigher prices of HDB flats.  However, the introduction of ECs in\r\n\r\nJuly  1996  helped  to  moderate prices.  Similarly,  there  was\r\n\r\nfurther  moderation when the Government announced in April  1997\r\n\r\nthe revised mortgage financing policy and the revised allocation\r\n\r\nof flats policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister how effective are these last two\r\n\r\nmeasures in curbing speculative demand for HDB flats and do they\r\n\r\nmake  HDB  flats more affordable for the public?  How would  the\r\n\r\nMinister  measure that?  I also like to ask what measures  would\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  introduce  to  make HDB  flats  more  affordable,\r\n\r\nespecially for the lower income group.  What percentage  of  the\r\n\r\nlower  income  group own their own flats and how would  he  make\r\n\r\nmore of them home owners?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, on 19th February\r\n\r\nthis  year  in  Parliament, I asked the  Minister  for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  a  few  questions relating to the  sale  price  and\r\n\r\nsubsidy  of   HDB  flats.   In his written  answer,  the  latest\r\n\r\nfigures for the fourth quarter of 1997 and the first quarter  of\r\n\r\n1998  show that after deducting the construction cost  and  land\r\n\r\ncost,  there is a lot of profit to be made from the sale of  the\r\n\r\nSengkang flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Contract N2C27, there are 795 units. From each unit,\r\n\r\nthe Government makes a profit of $39,221.  After the sale of all\r\n\r\nthe flats, the total profit may exceed $31 million.  In Contract\r\n\r\nN3C1, there are 442 units.  The Government's profit on each unit\r\n\r\nis  $29,000, and after selling all the units,  the total  profit\r\n\r\nmay  exceed   $12 million.   In Contract N2C28,  there  are  444\r\n\r\nunits and the profit on each unit is $1,016.   After the sale of\r\n\r\nall the flats, the total profit will amount to $451,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, after selling all these flats in the Sengkang area, the\r\n\r\nGovernment can make a profit of  more than $44 million.  I would\r\n\r\nlike to ask whether the Government is  subsidizing the flats  in\r\n\r\nSengkang or making a profit from there.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, the number of\r\n\r\napplications received as at January 1998 for HDB flats stands at\r\n\r\n47,218  applications for 5-room flats, 39,369 for  4-room  flats\r\n\r\nand  2,635  for 3-room flats.  And in Punggol 21, the queue  for\r\n\r\nthe  period ending 31st January 1998, the number of applications\r\n\r\nfor  5-room  flats  is 20,300, whereas for 4-room  flats  it  is\r\n\r\n12,900.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proportionately high 5-room applicants do not quite\r\n\r\ncorrespond with the demographic nor the economic profile of  the\r\n\r\napplicants.  The high number of 5-room flat applications may not\r\n\r\nbe  a  true reflection of the demand or special requirements  of\r\n\r\nthe  applicants  nor  necessarily coincides  with  the  economic\r\n\r\nability  to  purchase the flat.  Many apply for the 5-room  flat\r\n\r\nthinking  that there is an advantage to apply for a larger  flat\r\n\r\nnow  instead of upgrading at a later date when the need  arises.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why  there  is  such a high percentage  of  first-time\r\n\r\napplications for this type of flat which means that,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfirst,  they not only have to bear a higher purchasing cost  but\r\n\r\nalso  higher  maintenance  cost,  other  utility  and  upkeeping\r\n\r\nexpenses.   Worse,  in  times of economic downturn,  they  would\r\n\r\ndefinitely feel the economic strain in acquiring the extra space\r\n\r\nthat  they do not need, as my colleague, Mr Ong Kian Min, stated\r\n\r\nthat many have already asked to be downgraded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, from the national point of view, it would be a\r\n\r\ntremendous waste of resources because the built-up areas are not\r\n\r\nbeing  used  to  the maximum.  Already in Singapore,  the  ratio\r\n\r\nbetween  the  built-up area and each occupant in  a  residential\r\n\r\nunit  is one of the highest in Asia.  I would therefore like  to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister  in  what way the  Ministry  can  advise  the\r\n\r\napplicants  to be more realistic in choosing the  type  of  flat\r\n\r\nthey  want to apply so that they are more comfortable both  with\r\n\r\nthe   need  and  the  financial  affordability.   Perhaps   some\r\n\r\nguidelines  can  be introduced requesting applicants  of  larger\r\n\r\nflats  to  have a minimum number of occupants or set  a  minimum\r\n\r\ncombined  family  income for those who want to  apply  for  such\r\n\r\nlarger flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in Singapore, 90% of\r\n\r\nour  population  live in HDB flats.  Every eligible  family  can\r\n\r\napply  direct  for a flat from the HDB twice in their  lifetime.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words,  they  can get the subsidies  twice  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   But  single  persons  in  Singapore  cannot  apply\r\n\r\ndirectly  for flats from the HDB.  They have to wait until  they\r\n\r\nare  35 years old before they can buy resale flats from the open\r\n\r\nmarket. Otherwise, they will have to team up with a person above\r\n\r\n35 years of age to apply for a new HDB flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that the objective of the policy is to\r\n\r\nencourage  young  people to get married,  and  start  their  own\r\n\r\nfamilies.   But sometimes, marriage can be a matter of  destiny.\r\n\r\nTo  a girl, once the tender age is past, it may not be easy  for\r\n\r\nher  to find a suitable partner to be married to.   It is not  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  whether you want to get married or not!  So  if  the\r\n\r\nopportunities are lost,  because of incompatibility with the boy-friend  or girl-friend, or because of heavy workload,   you  may\r\n\r\njust remain a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsingle, not by choice but by chance.

He misses the boat of\r\n\r\nmarriage,  and now he cannot even buy a flat directly  from  the\r\n\r\nHDB.
