Nationalist forces  were\r\n\r\nlet  loose throughout the whole of this continent,\r\n\r\nupsetting the old order.

They   are    the\r\n\r\nCommunalists and the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first disruptive group will continue to be\r\n\r\nthe  communal extremists, the Ultras in our midst.\r\n\r\nThere  are people in Singapore who, even  after  a\r\n\r\nfew  months of separation, still talked raucously,\r\n\r\nalbeit foolishly, about the implementation of  one\r\n\r\nlanguage - the national language -- in teaching at\r\n\r\nall  levels including the university.  If  such  a\r\n\r\npolicy  was unwise when we were part of the  wider\r\n\r\nframework  of  Malaysia, now  in  the  context  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the  lunacy of such statements  should\r\n\r\nhave been manifest to all. Yet they are being made\r\n\r\nand  given  considerable  publicity  in  the  Jawi\r\n\r\npress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's declared intention that\r\n\r\nits  policy  of four equal and official  languages\r\n\r\nwith  Malay  as  the common and national  language\r\n\r\nshall  remain.  This policy was valid  before  and\r\n\r\nremains valid after Malaysia, for this policy  was\r\n\r\nnot  arrived  at out of expediency. In formulating\r\n\r\nit,  the  immutable factors of geography  and  the\r\n\r\nhard  facts of demography were taken into account.\r\n\r\nSeparation  has  not rendered  invalid  the  major\r\n\r\npremise  on which this policy was based.  Needless\r\n\r\nto  say,  the more extreme any community is  about\r\n\r\none  race, one language and one religion, the more\r\n\r\nlikely  it is to arouse counter chauvinism amongst\r\n\r\nthe other communities to the detriment of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second disruptive group, and in the long run\r\n\r\nthe more potent, is the Communists. They also play\r\n\r\non  communal heart strings, if only more skilfully\r\n\r\nand  cynically. Their followers within  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwith  backing  from  outside  sponsors,  want   to\r\n\r\ndisrupt our consolidation of national identity  by\r\n\r\nconsciously\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexploiting  appeals  to  chauvinist  and  communal\r\n\r\nsentiments. This can be seen from their change  in\r\n\r\ntactics  over questions of language,  culture  and\r\n\r\neducation. Five months ago, in June this year,  at\r\n\r\na  time  when  all  multi-racial and  non-communal\r\n\r\nleaderships  throughout Malaysia were gathered  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to rally and strengthen the forces  for\r\n\r\ntolerant   multi-racial  policies,   pro-Communist\r\n\r\ngroups  in  the political and trade  union  fields\r\n\r\ndenounced the analysis of the Malaysian Solidarity\r\n\r\nConvention  that in a multi-racial society,  where\r\n\r\nthe  races were divided in the percentages of  40,\r\n\r\n40 and 20, it is not possible for any one group to\r\n\r\nimpose its one language and culture on the others.\r\n\r\nThese  pro-Communist groups then joined the chorus\r\n\r\nof   the  Malay  communalists  that  to  refer  to\r\n\r\npercentages  of the racial components of  Malaysia\r\n\r\nwas itself an encouragement to communalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet within ten weeks of Singapore's independence,\r\n\r\nthese  same people cynically switched their  line.\r\n\r\nThey  now  urge  a revision of the status  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese  language on account of Singapore's  large\r\n\r\nChinese majority, even though Chinese has been one\r\n\r\nof the four official languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can expect them to intensify their\r\n\r\nexploitation  of  these issues  as  they  seek  to\r\n\r\nrecover their lost ground. But we cannot afford to\r\n\r\nforget  that  all  this is designed  not  for  the\r\n\r\npreservation of the Chinese language and  culture,\r\n\r\nbut for the disruption of orderly construction and\r\n\r\nprogress  so that out of the resulting chaos  they\r\n\r\nstand a better chance of grabbing power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us the problem is simply how to be ourselves,\r\n\r\nand  not  be  swallowed up in some  more  backward\r\n\r\nwhole.

So  we  must  never   allow\r\n\r\nourselves  the luxury of forgetting that  survival\r\n\r\ndepends upon rallying and strengthening the forces\r\n\r\nin  the  area who are for a secular, rational  and\r\n\r\nmulti-racial approach to the problems of  economic\r\n\r\nbackwardness   and   the  legacy   of   unbalanced\r\n\r\ndevelopment in the colonial era.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have travelled a long road to reach\r\n\r\nindependent  Singapore.

Long\r\n\r\naccustomed  to  independent ways  of  thought  and\r\n\r\nvigorous  modes of expression, it was not possible\r\n\r\nto  muffle and contain them by communal terror and\r\n\r\nintimidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we in Singapore can succeed in establishing a\r\n\r\ntolerant  multi-racial society, then the  catalyst\r\n\r\neffect  on the rest of the region is bound to  set\r\n\r\noff   social   change  within  these   territories\r\n\r\nthemselves leading to the emergence of  a  secular\r\n\r\nnation  state.  In  such a  secular  nation  state\r\n\r\nobscurantist  slogans of one race,  one  language,\r\n\r\none  religion will give way to the concept of many\r\n\r\ncommunities  bound together by ties of  geography,\r\n\r\ncommon experience, and economic betterment for all\r\n\r\nin  close  co-operation as  one  compact  national\r\n\r\nunit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must anticipate and prepare for every\r\n\r\ncontingency.  What happens to us if our  neighbour\r\n\r\nof  over  100 million people becomes embroiled  in\r\n\r\neven   greater  economic  difficulties?   Will   a\r\n\r\ngovernment emerge that will concentrate its effort\r\n\r\non  reconstruction and ultimate prosperity, or  on\r\n\r\ngreater and more hazardous external adventures?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we always expect that the Government in\r\n\r\nneighbouring  Malaysia will  if  not  friendly  at\r\n\r\nleast   be  neutral  and  unaggressive?   It   was\r\n\r\nsignificant  that the Prime Minister  of  Malaysia\r\n\r\nshould,  soon after getting Singapore out, explain\r\n\r\nto  the world that repression was contemplated  as\r\n\r\nan  alternative.  Let us never forget  that  there\r\n\r\nwere   quite  a  number  of  persons  who   openly\r\n\r\ndisagreed   with  the  Malaysian  Government   and\r\n\r\nostentatiously absented themselves when  the  vote\r\n\r\nwas   taken   in  the  Malaysian  Parliament   for\r\n\r\nSingapore's  expulsion. It was  not  because  they\r\n\r\nloved   Singapore  as  a  component  part  of   an\r\n\r\nincreasingly  multi-racial  society.  They  simply\r\n\r\nwanted  to suppress us, not knowing what the  cost\r\n\r\nwas going to be.

We must  succeed  if  only\r\n\r\nbecause we have already built so much that is good\r\n\r\nin  South-East Asia and there is no other time  or\r\n\r\nother place to start all over again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is against this sombre backdrop of our abiding\r\n\r\ndestiny  at the southernmost tip of the  continent\r\n\r\nof   Asia   that  we  spell  out  the  legislative\r\n\r\nprogramme before this House.

After  hearing  all\r\n\r\nviews on how the rights of racial, linguistic  and\r\n\r\nreligious    minorities    can    be    adequately\r\n\r\nsafeguarded, recommendations will be made to  this\r\n\r\nHouse  on  the  provisions to be included  in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.

But   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for deciding on  these  provisions\r\n\r\nwill  be  that of this Legislature. The  terms  of\r\n\r\nreference of the Commission will be wide enough to\r\n\r\nenable them to consider ways whereby all views  of\r\n\r\nall  minority  groups  in the  population  can  be\r\n\r\nadequately  heard on all matters  concerning  them\r\n\r\nbefore any legislation is enacted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an independent Republic, we have assumed two\r\n\r\nnew  responsibilities   -  Defence  and  Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs - subjects closely related to our survival.\r\n\r\nWe  must  quickly achieve sufficient  strength  to\r\n\r\ndeal   with   any  internal  security  contingency\r\n\r\nwithout  depending on outside help. An  Army  Bill\r\n\r\nwill be introduced to provide the framework for  a\r\n\r\nhard  well-trained if small regular army supported\r\n\r\nby  a  large people's volunteer force. But however\r\n\r\nsmall  the  regular  army or large  the  volunteer\r\n\r\ncomponent   of   the  armed  forces,   they   will\r\n\r\nnevertheless form a significant item in our annual\r\n\r\nbudget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So too will the establishment of our Missions\r\n\r\nabroad.

Foreign Affairs and  Defence\r\n\r\nare  closely inter-related subjects. The  policies\r\n\r\nwhich  we  pursue  in  foreign affairs  inevitably\r\n\r\ndecide  our  defence commitments and  our  defence\r\n\r\ncommitments in turn limit the range of options  of\r\n\r\nour  foreign  policy.  Our security  depends  upon\r\n\r\nhaving  the minimum number of unfriendly countries\r\n\r\nand the maximum number of friendly ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want the least number of countries to be\r\n\r\nhostile to us if for no reason other than that  we\r\n\r\nwish  to  be  as  independent of  foreign  defence\r\n\r\nassistance as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut   there   must   be   creditable   alternative\r\n\r\nguarantees  for our security before we can  afford\r\n\r\nto be talked into a position where we give up firm\r\n\r\nguarantees of our independent survival  in  return\r\n\r\nfor  not very credible treaties of friendship  and\r\n\r\neverlasting brotherhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the business of government and\r\n\r\nadministration  must  proceed.   In   a   separate\r\n\r\nmemorandum*  which is being tabled in this  House,\r\n\r\nmy   Government   has  set  out  the   legislative\r\n\r\nprogramme  and the policies which will occupy  the\r\n\r\ntime  of  this  House for this Session.  They  are\r\n\r\ndesigned to ensure our continued economic progress\r\n\r\nin  the  shortest possible time under the new  and\r\n\r\nvastly different circumstances we are faced  with.\r\n\r\nRadical  changes arise out of our  severance  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  Our  plans  for  industrialisation  and\r\n\r\neconomic development require the re-formulation of\r\n\r\na new basis, for it is clear that there will be no\r\n\r\nCommon  Market with Malaysia. A compelling  reason\r\n\r\nfor  our  seeking merger and Malaysia was to  give\r\n\r\nour  workers a way in which we could industrialise\r\n\r\nbehind  the  comfortable  buffer  of  a  protected\r\n\r\ndomestic market comprising the combined population\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia. This never came about, even  in  the\r\n\r\ntwo  years  we were in Malaysia. Now  we  have  to\r\n\r\nbreak into the markets of certain nations who  may\r\n\r\nfind  an  interest in Singapore's survival  as  an\r\n\r\nindependent democratic non-Communist country,  and\r\n\r\ninto  such countries in Africa and Eastern  Europe\r\n\r\nwho may find trade with us beneficial economically\r\n\r\nand politically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(*See Appendix I)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These nations, beginning with those with whom we\r\n\r\nhave  defence  associations ---Britain,  Australia\r\n\r\nand  New Zealand --- must first be convinced  that\r\n\r\nour  problem  is  finite, and  that  it  does  not\r\n\r\ninvolve too much of a sacrifice on their part. The\r\n\r\nrate  of  natural increase of our  population  has\r\n\r\nbeen steadily declining in the last six years.  It\r\n\r\nis now 2.5 per cent and will probably stabilise at\r\n\r\nbelow  2 per cent. This is a modest and manageable\r\n\r\nincrease for a total population of two million. So\r\n\r\nthe  other matter to be controlled is an  increase\r\n\r\nin population through immigration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already taken and will\r\n\r\ncomplete    certain   policies   to   limit    the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities of the Government to the citizens\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  On re-registration  all  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  will be issued with new plastic identity\r\n\r\ncards.  This will be completed before the  end  of\r\n\r\nnext   year.   Meanwhile   regulations   will   be\r\n\r\nintroduced  to  require  the  possession  of  work\r\n\r\npermits  for  any  person who is not  a  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen,  and whose income is less than  $750  per\r\n\r\nmonth.  These work permits will be given liberally\r\n\r\nin  the case of skilled workers, but will have  to\r\n\r\nbe as restrictive in the case of unskilled workers\r\n\r\nas our own unemployment problem requires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An infinitesimal percentage of the domestic\r\n\r\nmarkets  of certain highly developed countries  if\r\n\r\nopen to us by the removal of quota restrictions or\r\n\r\nrestrictive  tariffs will be more than  enough  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  buoyancy  in our economy.  Economic  and\r\n\r\npolitical  stability can thus be assured.  But  in\r\n\r\nthe  long  run, our viability depends upon  having\r\n\r\nthe  widest  spread  of economic  links  with  the\r\n\r\nlargest number of countries in the world, so  that\r\n\r\nthe economic levers on our political policies will\r\n\r\nnot be in the hands of a few Governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But assured markets alone are not enough. Our\r\n\r\nworkers  must  understand  that  the  creation  of\r\n\r\nindustries  and job opportunities  will  in  large\r\n\r\nmeasure  depend upon their capacity for hard  work\r\n\r\nand  disciplined performance in factories, a large\r\n\r\nproportion  of  whose markets  will  be  overseas.\r\n\r\nProducts  must  therefore  not  only  be  of  good\r\n\r\nquality,  but  at  competitive  prices.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords, there must be greater efficiency at factory\r\n\r\nfloor level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excesses of irresponsible trade unions in the\r\n\r\nearly `50s and even in the early `60s are luxuries\r\n\r\nwhich  we  can no longer afford. This  means  that\r\n\r\npeople  with industrial capital, managerial talent\r\n\r\nand the manufacturing know how must be assured  of\r\n\r\nsane and stable labour conditions and trade unions\r\n\r\ndo  not  indulge  in  obstructionist  policies  or\r\n\r\nstoppages  of production for reasons of  political\r\n\r\nmanoeuvre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these two years of confrontation we have\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  to the Indonesians that  it  is  not\r\n\r\nwithin  their  capacity to destroy or  hinder  the\r\n\r\neconomic growth of Singapore. The expected loss of\r\n\r\n8.7 per cent of our national income as a result of\r\n\r\nconfrontation by Indonesia has been more than made\r\n\r\nup  and  a  net increase of 2 per cent is recorded\r\n\r\nfor  1964,  over 1963. After we have  demonstrated\r\n\r\nour capacity to expand and prosper in independence\r\n\r\non  our  own, we can rationalise our relationships\r\n\r\nwith our immediate neighbour, Malaysia. We may  be\r\n\r\ntwo  countries, but we are one people. The  sooner\r\n\r\nall  face  up  to  this problem,  the  better  the\r\n\r\nchances   of   working  out  a  matter   of   fact\r\n\r\nrelationship  of interdependence on the  basis  of\r\n\r\nequal  and  mutual benefit. We must gird ourselves\r\n\r\nto  meet these tasks. We must demonstrate not only\r\n\r\nour  will but our capacity to defend what we  have\r\n\r\ngot and improve on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we lack in size of area and population we\r\n\r\nmore  than make up in strategic location  of  area\r\n\r\nand  quality  of population. Given dedication  and\r\n\r\ndetermination  there is little  to  stop  us  from\r\n\r\nsetting  the  pace of social change  and  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  the  region. An  industrious  and\r\n\r\ntalented  people striving to secure  their  future\r\n\r\nwill  surge forward to prosperity and strength  if\r\n\r\nthey are given honest administration and effective\r\n\r\nleadership.

Our nation  not  only\r\n\r\ncompletely   overcame  the  economic  effects   of\r\n\r\nIndonesian confrontation but indeed achieved a net\r\n\r\nincrease in national income. When Indonesia  began\r\n\r\nits  hostile confrontation against us in late 1963\r\n\r\nit  was estimated that the consequent severance in\r\n\r\ntrade  with our neighbour would lead to a  decline\r\n\r\nof  about 8.7 per cent in national income. Happily\r\n\r\nthe resilience and dynamism of Singapore's economy\r\n\r\nnot  only  absorbed the loss but we were  able  to\r\n\r\nshow  a net increase of 2 per cent in our national\r\n\r\nincome.   In  1964  Singapore's  national   income\r\n\r\ntotalled  $2,811  million compared  with  $2,744.6\r\n\r\nmillion the previous year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength and resilience of Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy  is best reflected in the increasing  rate\r\n\r\nof  capital  formation  achieved.  In  1964  gross\r\n\r\ncapital  formation  totalled  $415  million  which\r\n\r\nrepresents  an increase of 28 per cent over  1963.\r\n\r\nThis  rate  of capital formation is a  significant\r\n\r\nbreak-through for it exceeds the average  rate  of\r\n\r\nannual  increase of 22 per cent for the period  of\r\n\r\n1959   to   1963.  Though  this  rate  of  capital\r\n\r\nformation  is gratifying, gross capital  formation\r\n\r\nin  1964 still accounts for only about 15 per cent\r\n\r\nof  national  income. To achieve  sustained \r\n\r\nself-generating  economic growth, Singapore would  need\r\n\r\nto  invest  20  per  cent of its  national  income\r\n\r\nannually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic progress made in 1964 is not an\r\n\r\nisolated achievement. It is a step upward  in  the\r\n\r\nchain of steady progress achieved in the past five\r\n\r\nyears.  In  1965  we see the close of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nFirst  Five-Year Development Plan. By the  end  of\r\n\r\nthis  year  total  planned expenditure  will  have\r\n\r\namounted to $944 million of which $588 million  or\r\n\r\n62  per  cent  would have been spent  on  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment projects and $343 million or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n36  per  cent on social development projects.  The\r\n\r\nremaining  2  per cent was spent on administration\r\n\r\nfacilities.  Expenditure in the public  sector  in\r\n\r\nturn  stimulated investment in the private sector.\r\n\r\nIn  the first four years of the plan period,  i.e.\r\n\r\n1961  to  1964,  gross capital formation  totalled\r\n\r\n$1,219  million.  At  the  same  time  Singapore's\r\n\r\nnational  income also rose from $2,304 million  in\r\n\r\n1961 to $2,811 million in 1964.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the rate of progress achieved has been\r\n\r\ngratifying,  the task ahead is still a challenging\r\n\r\none  as  we begin our first year as an independent\r\n\r\nsovereign nation. The basic economic challenge  is\r\n\r\none   of  providing  remunerative  and  meaningful\r\n\r\nemployment  to our predominantly youthful  people.\r\n\r\nWhilst  the  problem  of  unemployment  is  within\r\n\r\nmanageable proportions at present, the future both\r\n\r\neconomically and politically will be fraught  with\r\n\r\ndanger  if  we  do  not create  enough  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  the  rising  expectations  and\r\n\r\nrising sophistication of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence my Government is constantly exercising its\r\n\r\nmind in the search for new avenues for solution of\r\n\r\nthis  problem. Our long-term economic  development\r\n\r\nwill  be  based on a continuation of the  policies\r\n\r\nsuccessfully applied in the First Five-Year  Plan.\r\n\r\nMy  Government  will devote a large  part  of  its\r\n\r\nresources  to  expand and firmly  consolidate  the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure necessary for progress. At the same\r\n\r\ntime  it  will also provide adequately the  social\r\n\r\namenities  such as education, housing  and  health\r\n\r\nfacilities  which  are  necessary  to  enable  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  to  lead meaningful lives.  Hence  about\r\n\r\n$976  million  or  64 per cent  of  total  planned\r\n\r\nexpenditure in the next five years will  be  spent\r\n\r\non    economic   development   projects.    Social\r\n\r\ndevelopment  expenditure  will  account  for  $486\r\n\r\nmillion or 32 per cent of plan outlay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An onerous but necessary drain on our resources\r\n\r\nwill  be the provision of capital expenditure  for\r\n\r\ndefence  and  internal security.  This  burden  we\r\n\r\naccept  as  one of the hard facts of our existence\r\n\r\nas an independent nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Five-Year Plan envisages an\r\n\r\nexpenditure  of $1,520 million. It is  hoped  that\r\n\r\nthis   will  in  turn  generate  matching  private\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditure of between $1,250  million\r\n\r\nand  $1,300  million.  This should  result,  given\r\n\r\nfavourable  opportunities  for  exports   in   the\r\n\r\ngrowing  industrial sector of the economy,  in  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of national income of about 5  per  cent\r\n\r\nper  annum.  As  Singapore's  rate  of  population\r\n\r\nincrease has now fallen to about 2.5 per cent  per\r\n\r\nannum  this  would  enable  Singapore  to  achieve\r\n\r\nsustained economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an independent sovereign nation, we have\r\n\r\nreluctantly to assume that our neighbour  Malaysia\r\n\r\nwill  from  now on treat Singapore  as  any  other\r\n\r\nthird  country  in trade relations.  On  our  part\r\n\r\nhowever  we  hope that Malaysia will treat  us  in\r\n\r\nterms  no  worse  than  any other  third  country.\r\n\r\nSingapore will have to search for more alternative\r\n\r\nforeign  markets  for its' manufactured  products.\r\n\r\nExcluding processing activities industrial  output\r\n\r\nin  1964 increased by some 16 per cent over  1963.\r\n\r\nTo  export  we  shall on our part  have  to  raise\r\n\r\nindustrial  productivity. On the  other  hand,  we\r\n\r\nhope  that  our friends and allies will not  place\r\n\r\nartificial   and  discriminatory  trade   barriers\r\n\r\nagainst  our products. We shall therefore  explore\r\n\r\nways  of  expanding  trade  with  our  traditional\r\n\r\npartners  and  also look for new opportunities  in\r\n\r\nAfrica and Eastern Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we shall strive to export more of our\r\n\r\nproducts  my  Government  will  not  overlook  the\r\n\r\nnecessity to maintain Singapore's present level of\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade. This will be achieved by creating\r\n\r\na free trade zone where imports can be broken down\r\n\r\nand  re-exported expeditiously without payment  of\r\n\r\nduties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to protect Singapore's new infant\r\n\r\nindustries  in  their  first  crucial  years,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has imposed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntariff duties as well as quantitative restrictions\r\n\r\non  a  range  of imported products. The protective\r\n\r\nduties  will have to be imposed for some years  to\r\n\r\ncome  until  the  new industries have  established\r\n\r\nthemselves.  Quantitative  restriction   will   be\r\n\r\nremoved as soon as it is opportune to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the emergence of Singapore as an\r\n\r\nindependent   nation   has   brought   about   new\r\n\r\nchallenges  it  has also given us independence  of\r\n\r\naction.  Thus  regressive taxes imposed  while  we\r\n\r\nwere in Malaysia have been rescinded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mid-November purposeful fiscal incentives were\r\n\r\nannounced to encourage manufacturers to export  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  advertise  more abroad  and  locally.  A\r\n\r\nfaster  rate of write-off for depreciation of  key\r\n\r\nindustries which are export orientated can now  be\r\n\r\ngranted. The fuel tax imposed during the Malaysian\r\n\r\nphase was also lifted for manufacturers using fuel\r\n\r\noil for manufacturing purposes.       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FOREIGN AFFAIRS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign Affairs is an extension of the domestic\r\n\r\npolicies  of  the  Government into  the  field  of\r\n\r\ninternational  politics.
