The Bill is the\r\n\r\nculmination  of the investigations instituted,  and\r\n\r\nit  sets  out  to  amend the Pawnbrokers  Ordinance\r\n\r\n(Chapter 195)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso as to incorporate such of the recommendations of\r\n\r\nthe   Committee   which  have  been   accepted   by\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main object of the Bill, Sir, is to establish\r\n\r\na Pawnbrokers Licensing Board responsible generally\r\n\r\nfor  the regulation of the pawnbroking business and\r\n\r\nparticularly  for  the  consideration  annually  of\r\n\r\napplications  for licences, for the issue,  refusal\r\n\r\nand  cancellation of licences, and for the  receipt\r\n\r\nof  fees  and  monthly returns from licensees.  The\r\n\r\nconstitution  of the Board, the definition  of  the\r\n\r\nscope  of  its  duties, the conditions  subject  to\r\n\r\nwhich  licences  may be granted,  recourse  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  persons  aggrieved  by  the  Board's\r\n\r\ndecisions,  and  the duties of the  pawnbrokers  in\r\n\r\nrespect of pledges remaining in their custody after\r\n\r\nthe   determination  of  their  licences,  are  all\r\n\r\nmatters provided for in clause 3 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proviso to section 9 (1) (c), Sir, proposed\r\n\r\nby  clause  3  of the Bill, safeguards the  banking\r\n\r\nbusiness which is commonly conducted by pawnbrokers\r\n\r\nin Singapore as a sideline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill provides that pawnbrokers\r\n\r\nmay  be  required to make monthly  returns  to  the\r\n\r\nBoard  in accordance with rules made under  section\r\n\r\n45 of the Ordinance. Such returns would be of value\r\n\r\nin  determining, for instance, the  extent  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity's  dependence  on  the  services  of  the\r\n\r\npawnbrokers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill amends section 24 of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  so as to simplify the calculation  of  a\r\n\r\npawnbroker's  liability  in  respect   of   pledges\r\n\r\ndestroyed  or  damaged by, or  in  consequence  of,\r\n\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill amplifies the provisions of\r\n\r\nsection  45 of the Ordinance, defining the purposes\r\n\r\nfor which rules may be made under this Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 (e) of the Bill provides for rules for\r\n\r\nthe  procedure to be followed by applicants and the\r\n\r\nprocedure and proceedings of the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill introduces an amended\r\n\r\nschedule of profits allowed to pawnbrokers. The new\r\n\r\nschedule provides for a maximum rate of interest of\r\n\r\ntwo per cent per month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 of the Bill is designed to make\r\n\r\namendments passim to provisions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin the Ordinance which require to be brought up to date\r\n\r\nin reference to the amount of loans and to the maximum fines that may\r\n\r\nbe imposed for offences under the Ordinance, and other amendments resulting\r\n\r\nin the constitution of the proposed Pawnbrokers Licensing Board which replaces the existing Licensing\r\n\r\nAuthority.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While clause 3 of the Bill provides the basis for the procedure and proceedings of the Board and that of\r\n\r\napplicants and applications, regulations are being framed to make more specific provisions in these respects,\r\n\r\nespecially in regard to reference to departments, advertising of applications, notice of objections\r\n\r\nfrom the public and departments, fees for licences, and display of licences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 (1) of the Bill provides for the fee to be prescribed by the Governor in Council and this will be done under\r\n\r\nthe regulations which are being made. Neither the Committee's Report nor the White Paper has provided for any\r\n\r\nbasis of classification or the scale of fees. However, it has been the view that the fees collected\r\n\r\nshould not be looked upon as a revenue measure but as a means of covering the cost of the administrative\r\n\r\nsystem. It is proposed, Sir, to have classifications and fees as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                     Classification                      Fee per annum\r\n\r\n                                                              $\r\n\r\n             Pawnbrokers \"A\" Class - pawnbrokers\r\n\r\n               with an investment of $50,000\r\n\r\n               to $1,000,000                                 250\r\n\r\n               \r\n\r\n             Pawnbrokers \"B\" Class - pawnbrokers\r\n\r\n               with an investment of $20,000\r\n\r\n               to $50,000                                    150\r\n\r\n               \r\n\r\n             Pawnbrokers \"C\" Class - pawnbrokers\r\n\r\n               with an investment of $5,000\r\n\r\n               to $20,000                                    100\r\n\r\n               \r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is felt, Sir, that the above will be acceptable both to Government and the pawnbrokers.

The minutes of the proceedings\r\n\r\nof these meetings can be found in Appendix III. The\r\n\r\nBill  reproduced  in Appendix II contains  all  the\r\n\r\namendments  to the Bill recommended by  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.  Most of the amendments made  are  minor\r\n\r\nones  for the purpose of improving the drafting  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  to clarify still further its provisions.\r\n\r\nThe  representations made by unions  and  employers\r\n\r\nhave   been  duly  considered  but  they  are   not\r\n\r\nconsidered  to  be  of such substance  as  to  make\r\n\r\nnecessary amendments to the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must not be overlooked, Sir, that the Bill is\r\n\r\nan  improvement on the previous Bill introduced  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government  during the last session  and  that\r\n\r\naccount   has   already   been   taken    of    the\r\n\r\nrepresentations then made. Moreover, the  Bill  has\r\n\r\nbeen  considered  by the Labour Advisory  Board  on\r\n\r\nwhich   workers   and  employers   are   adequately\r\n\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with reference to the telegram from the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Business  Houses Employees'  Union,  the\r\n\r\npoints  raised  therein have  been  given  due  and\r\n\r\ncareful  consideration and it was felt  that  there\r\n\r\nshould be a distinction between clerical workers in\r\n\r\noffices  and  those  whose  work  bears  a   direct\r\n\r\nrelation to the workmen in the same employment  who\r\n\r\nare  covered  by the Labour Code.

This group, the clerical  workers\r\n\r\nof  Singapore,  unlike the Singapore Federation  of\r\n\r\nEmployers,  did not have a lawyer to present  their\r\n\r\nviews  to the Select Committee at the last time  or\r\n\r\nthis  time. We have promised them for a  long  time\r\n\r\nnot a maximum standard of living Bill but a law  to\r\n\r\nprotect  them against unreasonable exploitation,  a\r\n\r\nlaw  to  give them statutory minimum conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice.  There is much that is very good  in  this\r\n\r\nBill.  There  are  nevertheless  provisions  of   a\r\n\r\ncharacter  which  by  some extraordinary  oversight\r\n\r\nhave slipped in which make it not a clerks Bill but\r\n\r\nan   employers  Bill  and  not  even  an   ordinary\r\n\r\nemployers Bill, because there are many very  decent\r\n\r\nemployers,   but   the  Singapore   Federation   of\r\n\r\nEmployers  Bill, that Federation which through  the\r\n\r\npages  of  these  reports and  last  year's  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee's  reports comes through as  a  mean  and\r\n\r\ncrafty scrooge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have had an illuminating talk this morning\r\n\r\nwith  the  Attorney-General and I am glad  to  note\r\n\r\nthat  at least in respect of clauses 6 and 7  there\r\n\r\nwas  never  the intention to have the effect  which\r\n\r\nthey  do  have but I shall take, clause by  clause,\r\n\r\nthe  clauses to which I take objection and  then  I\r\n\r\nshall  ask this House to give me an opportunity  to\r\n\r\nput the arguments before you in Committee. I do not\r\n\r\nask  you  to  accept  at  this  stage  what  I   am\r\n\r\nsuggesting to be true but I do ask you to permit me\r\n\r\nto  amend  this motion before you so  that  we  can\r\n\r\nrecommit  ten other clauses to a Committee  of  the\r\n\r\nwhole House to consider them quietly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first clause which I shall ask for\r\n\r\nrecommittal  is clause 2. Clause 2  creates  three\r\n\r\nclasses of clerks. God created only two classes of\r\n\r\nhuman  beings,  men and women.  We  are  asked  to\r\n\r\ncreate by law: one, clerks earning more than  $500\r\n\r\na  month  and  clerks earning  less;  two,  clerks\r\n\r\nworking in offices; three, industrial clerks. They\r\n\r\nare all different. Clerks earning more than $500 a\r\n\r\nmonth  have  no protection whatsoever.  Industrial\r\n\r\nclerks as compared to clerks have to work 44 hours\r\n\r\ninstead  of  39 hours a week, get only seven  days\r\n\r\nholidays  instead of 14 days for annual leave  and\r\n\r\n11  days  instead of 13 days for public  holidays.\r\n\r\nThe   Minister  for  Labour  and  Welfare   is   a\r\n\r\nSocialist,  as  we all are in this House,  barring\r\n\r\nMr  Sutherland - no offence meant, Sir. He  frankly\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"I  represent capital, so what!  And  I  am\r\n\r\nproud of it.\" Fair enough! Everybody else in  this\r\n\r\nHouse says that he is a Socialist. Well, Sir,  let\r\n\r\nus then look at it as Socialists, as honest people\r\n\r\nwho   seek   to   assist  these  really   helpless\r\n\r\npeople - this group known as the clerical workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Clerical and Administrative\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Union at page 4 of this Report protested\r\n\r\nagainst  limiting  clerks to those  under  $500  a\r\n\r\nmonth. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... that all persons clerically employed should\r\n\r\ncome  within  the meaning of and  benefit  by  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance   otherwise  clerks   drawing   salaries\r\n\r\nexceeding  $500  would not be able  to  claim  the\r\n\r\nprivileges contained in the Ordinance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now, Sir,  again the Confederation  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nChinese  Engineering Tradesmen Union at column  37\r\n\r\nof  Annexe  I protested against this  and  in  its\r\n\r\nletter of 12th November, 1956, it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Our interpretation of the contents of United\r\n\r\nEngineers'  letter  is that  they  will  adhere\r\n\r\nstrictly   to   the  provisions  of   the   Clerks\r\n\r\nEmployment  Ordinance, when passed,  and,  in  its\r\n\r\npresent  form,  apart  from giving  no  protection\r\n\r\nwhatsoever to clerical workers drawing  more  than\r\n\r\n$500 per  month, it provides less benefits  than\r\n\r\ncurrently  enjoyed by U.E. workers  who  would  be\r\n\r\nclassified  as  \"Industrial  Clerks\"   under   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance, in that they would be allowed one  week\r\n\r\nannual  leave  against two weeks  now  enjoyed  by\r\n\r\nthem, and they would work 44 hours weekly, instead\r\n\r\nof 40 hours at present.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  the  Attorney-General  in  Select  Committee\r\n\r\nseemed to suggest that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$500    limit   was   necessary   for   ease    of\r\n\r\nadministration and I think you will find  that  at\r\n\r\ncolumns 2, 3 and 4 of the Minutes of Evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I for myself would like to ask the House to\r\n\r\npermit  the recommittal of this clause for  closer\r\n\r\nscrutiny.  I  say  that there is really  no  valid\r\n\r\nreason whatsoever for putting this arbitrary limit\r\n\r\nof   $500  except  that  the  Singapore  Employers\r\n\r\nFederation,  seeking the maximum possible  control\r\n\r\nin  the minimum possible conditions of service for\r\n\r\nthese workers, has asked that there be a limit and\r\n\r\nit  be  $400. Any decent human being who has  read\r\n\r\nthe  representations  of the  Singapore  Employers\r\n\r\nFederation   should   take   the   attitude   that\r\n\r\neverything they say is suspect. It is evil:  those\r\n\r\ndocuments  that they have put in and  the  control\r\n\r\nthat   they  seek  to  have  over  these  entirely\r\n\r\nhelpless  human beings whom they employ as  fodder\r\n\r\nfor their obscene profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Come, come!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Come, come! I have asked\r\n\r\nrepeatedly in this House, Mr Speaker, Sir, for  a\r\n\r\ndeclaration  as  to the profits  earned  by  these\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  it has never been  available.  The\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary and this House  know  exactly\r\n\r\nwhy  I  am not given those figures because  it  is\r\n\r\nfeared  that publication of the \"obscene  profits\"\r\n\r\n(I repeat) made by these organisations would shock\r\n\r\nthe  conscience of this country. But that  is  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Employers  Federation.   Yet   it   is\r\n\r\ninteresting,   gentlemen,   that   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nEmployers Federation does not want the distinction\r\n\r\nbetween  \"clerk\" and \"industrial clerk\".  So  here\r\n\r\nyou have got the poor trade union saying, \"Please,\r\n\r\nwhy  a  clerk who gets 14 days leave and doing  39\r\n\r\nhours a week and then why an industrial clerk  who\r\n\r\nis also a human being doing the same work doing 44\r\n\r\nhours  a  week  with only seven  days  for  annual\r\n\r\nleave?\"   And  the  Federation  agrees   but   for\r\n\r\ndifferent reasons. You will see them in a  minute.\r\n\r\nSir, may I refer you to pages 6, 10, 11 and 12  of\r\n\r\nthe  memorandum  of the gentlemen  I  have  called\r\n\r\nScrooges:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Federation appreciates that this feature of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  has  probably been introduced  to  meet\r\n\r\nobjections   put   forward  when  previous   draft\r\n\r\nlegislation of this nature was under consideration\r\n\r\nthat to impose a standard working week of 39 hours\r\n\r\nfor  all  categories  of clerks,  irrespective  of\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not they were employed  in  industry,\r\n\r\nwould  make  the effective working  of  industrial\r\n\r\nconcerns   virtually  impossible.   Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nhowever   such  a  distinction  between  the   two\r\n\r\ncategories  of  clerks will also be impossible  to\r\n\r\noperate  in  practice... (this  distinction\r\n\r\nbetween clerks and industrial clerks)\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And they go on to say that the Federation suggests\r\n\r\nthat  the  clerks  should all be  reduced  to  the\r\n\r\nstatus  of  industrial clerks and that they  would\r\n\r\nall be very happy. Now, Sir, I would like to go in\r\n\r\ndetail through the arguments used for the division\r\n\r\nof  these clerks and industrial clerks. I say that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour and Welfare errs and errs\r\n\r\ngravely when he suggests that it is necessary that\r\n\r\nthere  be this distinction of two different  types\r\n\r\nof  clerks: one a superior human being and another\r\n\r\nan  inferior human being. I say that  if  in  some\r\n\r\nconcerns it is necessary to have different working\r\n\r\nhours  then there can be overtime pay and  in  the\r\n\r\nlast resort he can always accept that organisation\r\n\r\nin  accordance with the terms of clause 2 from the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, clause 6 perpetuates exploitatory\r\n\r\ncontracts.  If  there is a contract  in  existence\r\n\r\nwhich  gives the clerk much less favourable  terms\r\n\r\nthan   the   present  Bill,  then  that  agreement\r\n\r\ncontinues  in  force. Why should  we  condone  and\r\n\r\nendorse   contracts  which  fall  below  what   we\r\n\r\nconsider a minimum standard of conditions? I would\r\n\r\nbe ashamed, gentlemen, to be in any way associated\r\n\r\nwith  a clause of that nature. I say that no  true\r\n\r\nSocialist would seek to perpetuate and to give the\r\n\r\nauthority   of   statutory  law  in   support   of\r\n\r\nprovisions which are contrary to what he considers\r\n\r\nto  be  minimum human needs. Why should we endorse\r\n\r\nthese contracts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... any term of a contract of service which is\r\n\r\ncontrary to the provisions of this Ordinance shall\r\n\r\nbe illegal, null and void.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now, in fairness to the Government, let us get it straight. They did not mean\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit.  The Minister for Labour and Welfare has  been\r\n\r\nengaged  and busy elsewhere.

He  did\r\n\r\nnot  mean it and now that it has been drawn to his\r\n\r\nattention,  I  have reason to hope  that  he  will\r\n\r\ncorrect  it  but  that clause  7  if  you  do  not\r\n\r\nrecommit it to this Assembly means that these  are\r\n\r\nnot   minimum  conditions  of  work  but   maximum\r\n\r\nconditions  of  work;  because  let  us  take  the\r\n\r\ninstance  of clause 36. Clause 36 gives to  clerks\r\n\r\n13  days public holidays a year but, gentlemen,  I\r\n\r\nhad   the   privilege  of  being   associated   in\r\n\r\nnegotiations  with  Boustead  and  Co.  Ltd, who,\r\n\r\nthough  a  member of the Singapore  Federation  of\r\n\r\nEmployers,  is of a totally different  type.  They\r\n\r\nshowed a sympathy, an understanding and a goodwill\r\n\r\nthat was very heartening and we obtained from them\r\n\r\n16  days in respect of this particular aspect - 16\r\n\r\ndays public holidays a year. Now, according to the\r\n\r\nterms of clause 7, that agreement with Boustead is\r\n\r\nillegal.  Sir, I do ask that you permit that  that\r\n\r\nshould  go  back for reconsideration  despite  the\r\n\r\nfact  that two Select Committees have sat and  the\r\n\r\nsatisfaction  of  the Minister in  charge  of  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, look at clause 14, gentlemen:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"An employer may without notice dismiss an\r\n\r\nemployee on the grounds of misconduct.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  clerks went before the Select Committee  last\r\n\r\nyear  and  said, \"Look, is this not a  bit  harsh?\r\n\r\nSupposing I speak to my employer in a loud  voice.\r\n\r\nThat  is misconduct, is it not?\" And the Attorney-General  said, \"Gentlemen, do you not  agree  that\r\n\r\nfor  misconduct, an employee shall be  dismissed?\"\r\n\r\nSo they just withered and made their protest. Then\r\n\r\nlet me show you something, gentlemen, of which the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General should have been  aware.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nquote  the  case  of Clouston and  Company  versus\r\n\r\nCorry,  1906 Law Journal Reports, 75 Privy Council\r\n\r\nat  page  20;  also, Sir, reported in 1906  appeal\r\n\r\ncases  -a  Privy Council case, an appeal from  New\r\n\r\nZealand, Sir. Why I emphasize the Privy Council is\r\n\r\nbecause what is decided here, as you are aware, is\r\n\r\napplicable to Singapore. The decisions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  Privy Council are law in Singapore.  What\r\n\r\ndoes  Lord  James of Hereford, Sir, who  delivered\r\n\r\nthe judgment say about misconduct:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"There is no fixed rule of law defining the\r\n\r\ndegree of misconduct which will justify dismissal.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  (please  notice this)  there  may  be\r\n\r\nmisconduct in a servant which will not justify the\r\n\r\ndetermination of the contract of service by one of\r\n\r\nthe parties against the will of the other.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now, may I repeat it, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...there may be misconduct in a servant which\r\n\r\nwill not justify the determination of the contract\r\n\r\nof service...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>But what does this clause say? All misconduct. You\r\n\r\ncan  dismiss your clerks. Why? May I read on, Sir,\r\n\r\nso  that you may fully understand what is intended\r\n\r\nhere,   Sir?  The  common  law  says   that   only\r\n\r\nmisconduct which goes to the root of the  contract\r\n\r\nof   service,  which  nullifies  the   terms   and\r\n\r\nconditions  of  your service, only  that  kind  of\r\n\r\ngross  and  grave  misconduct  is  a  ground   for\r\n\r\nimmediate dismissal. But this clause is seeking to\r\n\r\nprotect  whom? The Singapore Employers  Federation\r\n\r\nsays  all  misconduct  is a ground  for  immediate\r\n\r\ndismissal  without notice. Let me  read  on,  Sir,\r\n\r\nfrom this judgment of Lord James of Hereford:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"On the other hand, misconduct inconsistent with\r\n\r\nthe   fulfilment   of  the  express   or   implied\r\n\r\nconditions  of  service  will  justify  dismissal.\r\n\r\nCertainly when the alleged misconduct consists  of\r\n\r\ndrunkenness, there must be considerable difficulty\r\n\r\nin   determining  the  extent  of  conditions   of\r\n\r\nintoxication    which    would    establish    the\r\n\r\njustification for dismissal. The intoxication  may\r\n\r\nbe habitual and gross and directly interferes with\r\n\r\nthe  business of the employer or with the  ability\r\n\r\nof the servant to render due service but it may be\r\n\r\nan  isolated act committed under circumstances  of\r\n\r\nfestivity  and  in  no  way  connected   with   or\r\n\r\naffecting the employer's business. In such a case,\r\n\r\nthe question of whether the misconduct establishes\r\n\r\nthe  right to dismiss the servant must depend upon\r\n\r\nfacts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So, gentlemen, all I ask is that we do not put the\r\n\r\nshackles even more firmly on the employee and that\r\n\r\nwe  recommit  clause 14 in order  to  add  such  a\r\n\r\nphrase   as  \"misconduct  inconsistent  with   the\r\n\r\nimplied  and express terms of service\".  Sir,  the\r\n\r\npresent  law  applies if the  employers  think  it\r\n\r\nnecessary to have it but do not let us make things\r\n\r\nworse for the clerks than they are today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Sir, clause 15. There is nothing wrong with\r\n\r\nclause 15 except its silence. Sir, for many  years\r\n\r\nnow, workers have been bedevilled in their efforts\r\n\r\nto obtain honest conditions of service by the fear\r\n\r\nthat  if  they go on strike, they may  be  legally\r\n\r\ncommitting  a  breach of contract which  justifies\r\n\r\ntheir immediate dismissal and you know, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nin  this  colony  even recently  there  have  been\r\n\r\nsuccessful efforts to dismiss employees  who  went\r\n\r\non  strike on the ground that this is a breach  of\r\n\r\ncontract. Now, do we as Socialists all believe  in\r\n\r\nthe  ultimate right to strike? If we do, Sir, then\r\n\r\nwe should make it lawful and if it is lawful, then\r\n\r\nit  should not be a breach of contract and  I  ask\r\n\r\nthat  clause  15 be recommitted to this  House  so\r\n\r\nthat this should be made clear by the insertion of\r\n\r\nsubclause (2) reading:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Strike action by an employee in pursuance of the\r\n\r\nlawful request of his registered trade union shall\r\n\r\nnot be deemed to be a breach of contract.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Let them be at peace, these workers. We are saying\r\n\r\nthat  this  is a clerks charter, a lighthouse  for\r\n\r\nthe  future  for  the protection of  these  humble\r\n\r\npeople.  Let them be at peace and know where  they\r\n\r\nstand. If they take strike action in pursuance not\r\n\r\nof  the request but of the lawful request of their\r\n\r\nregistered  trade union, then they  shall  not  be\r\n\r\ndeemed to have committed a breach of contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, in respect of clauses 34, 35, 36 and\r\n\r\n37, they  are  consequential to  my  request  for\r\n\r\namendment  of clause 2 and I say, \"Please  let  us\r\n\r\nconsider them in Committee.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, clause 38 is an absolute beauty, it\r\n\r\nsays  that you are entitled to a maximum aggregate\r\n\r\nof   twenty-eight  days  of  sick  leave  if  your\r\n\r\nemployer's   doctor  has  examined  you   and   so\r\n\r\ncertifies but I ask the Minister: what happens  if\r\n\r\nthe  employer's  doctor refuses  to  examine  him?\r\n\r\n[Interruption]  Are  you  suggesting  that  it  is\r\n\r\nimpossible?  What  happens  then?  Supposing   the\r\n\r\nemployer  says,  \"I will have no doctor.  You  are\r\n\r\nsick,  well,  psk!.\"  If you  read  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nEmployers Federation memorandum, you will not have\r\n\r\nmuch  respect for employers. What happens? Are  we\r\n\r\nto give no protection to the clerk if the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployer  is obstructive? So I say that we  should\r\n\r\nadd a further clause:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"or if the employer's medical practitioner does\r\n\r\nnot  examine the employee within twelve  hours  of\r\n\r\nthe   employee's  request  reaching  him  on   the\r\n\r\ncertificate    from    any   registered    medical\r\n\r\npractitioner whose charges shall be  paid  by  the\r\n\r\nemployer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Is that unreasonable? I wait twelve hours and I am\r\n\r\nsick. I wait twelve hours for my employer to  send\r\n\r\na doctor or to tell me what doctor to go to and he\r\n\r\ntells  me,  \"Take  a running jump.\"  After  twelve\r\n\r\nhours, I can consult any medical practitioner  and\r\n\r\nthat  certificate protects me for the twenty-eight\r\n\r\ndays. Is that unreasonable?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, the Minister for Labour and Welfare\r\n\r\nspoke with considerable weight when it came to the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  how  they labour  in  his  Ministry,\r\n\r\nparticularly  on  the Labour Code  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nmaternity  leave. But under this  Bill  he  forgot\r\n\r\nabout  that  aspect  of  his  labour - there  is  no\r\n\r\nmaternity leave. Under the Labour Code, a woman is\r\n\r\nentitled to four weeks; under this clause she  has\r\n\r\nnone. I do not know whether it is suggested,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  there  are no women clerks,  or  that  women\r\n\r\nclerks  do  not have babies, or that women  clerks\r\n\r\nare  of  such sturdy character that they can  drop\r\n\r\ntheir babies into the waste-paper baskets? Why  do\r\n\r\nnot clerks have maternity leave? I have not got  a\r\n\r\nright to it as a clerk; it does not matter to  me.\r\n\r\nWe   are   seeking  to  make  provision  for   the\r\n\r\nprotection of timid human beings who cannot  speak\r\n\r\nfor  themselves.  Why is there  no  provision  for\r\n\r\nmaternity leave? There are 28 days sick leave  for\r\n\r\neverybody.  Is  a woman not entitled  to  be  sick\r\n\r\nwhilst  a  man  is  entitled to  be?  Is  she  not\r\n\r\nentitled to some rest if she has a baby?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am going to move, if the House will permit\r\n\r\nme,  the recommittal of this clause 38, that every\r\n\r\nemployee shall be entitled to additional paid sick\r\n\r\nleave  during terms of four weeks each before  and\r\n\r\nafter  her maternity confinement, and I  hope  the\r\n\r\nHon. the Minister for Labour and Welfare, who  has\r\n\r\nthe  privilege of being a married man with  lovely\r\n\r\nchildren,  will  remember  that  his  wife  needed\r\n\r\nmaternity leave and so do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose  who are less fortunate and have to work  in\r\n\r\noffices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, I move that these clauses be recommited\r\n\r\nto  the  House.

As you can see from their  numerous\r\n\r\nunions,  they are separated, one section from  the\r\n\r\nother,  and as such they do not represent  such  a\r\n\r\nstrong  force.  I believe that this  Bill  is  now\r\n\r\nintroduced to exploit the clerks because they  are\r\n\r\nnot united and have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot got a strong union to protect them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Shame!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Shame! Real shame! Why then,\r\n\r\nshould  we exploit the clerks because of the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  they do not have a strong union? A clerk  is\r\n\r\nalways  a clerk. Why should we classify them  into\r\n\r\nthree categories - those earning $500 a month, those\r\n\r\nbelow $500, and industrial workers? Does this mean\r\n\r\nthat  a clerk whose income is above $500 is not  a\r\n\r\nclerk? There are many firms and many organisations\r\n\r\nwhich do have clerks whose incomes are above $500.\r\n\r\nWhy  do  they not come under this Bill and so  get\r\n\r\nprotection? Why should we bar clerks drawing above\r\n\r\n$500?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to industrial workers, Sir, if a clerk is\r\n\r\na  clerk,  why  should we call him  an  industrial\r\n\r\nworker? A labourer, a foreman and a technician are\r\n\r\nindustrial  workers, but not a store  clerk  or  a\r\n\r\ntally  clerk.  If he is a clerk, he  should  be  a\r\n\r\nclerk.  What is the difference between an ordinary\r\n\r\nclerk  and  a  store  clerk? I  do  not  see  much\r\n\r\ndifference between them. A clerk sits at a  table;\r\n\r\nhe  performs clerical duties. A store  clerk  also\r\n\r\nworks  at  a  table  and  also  performs  clerical\r\n\r\nduties.  The only little difference I may  see  is\r\n\r\nthis,  Sir, that a store clerk is responsible  for\r\n\r\nthe  goods within his store: and that should  give\r\n\r\nhim  more  responsibility in his employment,  and,\r\n\r\nwith  more  responsibility, he should have  better\r\n\r\nconditions of service rather than that his  status\r\n\r\nshould  be  lowered.  By  classifying  him  as  an\r\n\r\nindustrial clerk, we are trying to create  a  sort\r\n\r\nof  inferiority complex in him, and that will just\r\n\r\nkill  his initiative. Is that fair, Sir? We should\r\n\r\nnot classify clerks into so many categories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to clause 14, Sir, on \"misconduct\" I am\r\n\r\nnot  a  lawyer, so I do not know how to  interpret\r\n\r\nthe  word. I was working in the Army as  a  senior\r\n\r\nclerk. My status at that time was equivalent to  a\r\n\r\nwarrant  officer,  class  one.  At  that  time,  a\r\n\r\nsergeant came up to me and said. \"Mr Lee, I  want\r\n\r\nyou  to  address me as 'Sir'.\" I told him that  my\r\n\r\nstatus  was  far  above his and asked  him  why  I\r\n\r\nshould  address him so. I firmly refused  to  call\r\n\r\nhim \"Sir\". Was that misconduct?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Would that refusal to call  him  \"Sir\"\r\n\r\nmean  that I would have to lose my job? No, I hope\r\n\r\nit  does  not;  but the word \"misconduct\"  is  not\r\n\r\nclear  to me. If a clerk can be dismissed  without\r\n\r\nnotice on this account, is that not exploitation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clauses 35, 36 and 37, the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill has said that we will elaborate on  them\r\n\r\nwhen we go into Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to clause 38, on the question of 28 days\r\n\r\nsick leave in a year - is the period sufficient?  As\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Cairnhill has said, if  a  firm's\r\n\r\ndoctor  refuses to examine its clerk,  where  else\r\n\r\ncan the clerk go? He will not be entitled then  to\r\n\r\nany  sick  leave at all. Apart from  this,  is  it\r\n\r\nsufficient that a human being should have only  28\r\n\r\ndays sick leave, that he will only be sick for  28\r\n\r\ndays  and no more? Is that fair? He may have  put\r\n\r\nin 15 years of efficient service with the firm and\r\n\r\nwithin  that time he has not taken any sick  leave\r\n\r\nbut,  unfortunately, on the sixteenth year or  so,\r\n\r\nhe  falls  sick,  and it may  be  a  very  serious\r\n\r\nillness.  According  to  this  Bill,  he  is  only\r\n\r\nallowed 28 days; he must be sick for only 28  days\r\n\r\nand no more, or else he gets no pay. Is that fair?\r\n\r\nI  think  this  clause should be amended  so  that\r\n\r\nthere  should  he at least 52 days full-pay  leave\r\n\r\nplus another 26 days half-pay leave. Why should we\r\n\r\nlimit a man to being sick for only 28 days? Let us\r\n\r\nextend  the limit and, if he falls sick,  let  him\r\n\r\nenjoy  that  privilege; and  if  he  exceeds  that\r\n\r\nperiod,  at least give him half pay. If  he  falls\r\n\r\nsick, he has to incur medical expenses; yet,  with\r\n\r\nall the cost of medical attention, he will get  no\r\n\r\npay  after 28 days! Is that fair? Clerks, as  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Cairnhill said, are among the  lowest\r\n\r\npaid workers: clerks are the most modest people in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Then where can they get the  money  to\r\n\r\npay  for medical attention? Cannot we grant  them\r\n\r\nhalf-pay leave or so, so that they can continue to\r\n\r\nget   some  income  not  only  to  maintain  their\r\n\r\nfamilies, but also to pay for medical expenses?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of maternity leave, I fully\r\n\r\nsupport the Member for Cairnhill.

According to Chinese custom,  the\r\n\r\nperiod for recovery is set at 100 days before they\r\n\r\ncome out into the open; they are confined to their\r\n\r\nrooms for 100 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

But at least I have been consistent, Sir,  by\r\n\r\nintroducing  the same sections in the Labour  Code\r\n\r\ninto  the  Clerks  Employment Bill  and  the  Shop\r\n\r\nAssistants Employment Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 2, we are asked why there should be\r\n\r\nthree  classes of clerks. The reason is  this:  We\r\n\r\nlay  down  minimum  conditions of  employment  for\r\n\r\nclerks and workers who are unable to look, or  who\r\n\r\nhave  difficulty in looking, after themselves.  We\r\n\r\nlay  down a maximum salary of $500 because we feel\r\n\r\nthat  those  drawing above that figure  are  in  a\r\n\r\nbetter  position to fend for themselves in  court,\r\n\r\nand to have the advantage of legal advice in court\r\n\r\nas  to the interpretation of \"misconduct\" or  some\r\n\r\nother term of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have defined clerical workers into\r\n\r\noffice   clerks   and   industrial   clerks-   the\r\n\r\nindustrial  clerks  are  already  there.  What  we\r\n\r\npropose  to give them is the minimum, and in  fact\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  is  going  to help  a  good  number  of\r\n\r\nindustrial clerks who do not have the advantage of\r\n\r\ntrade union organisations or the benefit of a good\r\n\r\nemployer.  It  does not detract from those  clerks\r\n\r\nwho  are industrial clerks because of their  close\r\n\r\nrelationship with the labourers - or workmen, as  we\r\n\r\nnow call them under the Labour Code - who work under\r\n\r\nthem.  A store clerk has to be in a store to  keep\r\n\r\nit  open  so that workmen can bring goods  in  and\r\n\r\nout - there  is  that relationship; or a  supervisor\r\n\r\nhas  to keep on working when there are workmen for\r\n\r\nhim to supervise. It is felt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   there  should  be  a  direct  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween the two classes of workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in regard to this limitation of $500, Sir,\r\n\r\nit  will  be  seen  that,  under  clause  2,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  can at any time, or from time to  time,\r\n\r\nraise  the  figure. If the Minister is  satisfied\r\n\r\nthat,  as a result of this limitation of $500,  a\r\n\r\nlarge number of clerical workers drawing say from\r\n\r\n$600 to $700 are, shall we say, being ill-treated\r\n\r\nby  their  employers and are unable to  fend  for\r\n\r\nthemselves,  I  am  sure that  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Welfare, whoever he may be  at  that\r\n\r\ntime,  will  alter the limitation to  cover  this\r\n\r\nunfortunate class of workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to all the other points brought up, I\r\n\r\nwould  say  that the relevant clauses  have  been\r\n\r\ntaken  from the Labour Code, and I do  not  think\r\n\r\nany  useful purpose will be served if I  were  to\r\n\r\nspeak  on  them and so lengthen this debate.  The\r\n\r\npoints  brought up will, of course, be  mentioned\r\n\r\nagain at the Committee stage, when I will explain\r\n\r\nthe  policy  of the Government on the  points  as\r\n\r\nthey arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of maternity benefits is one which\r\n\r\nrequires a reply now. We did not insert a  clause\r\n\r\nin  the Bill on maternity benefits but this  does\r\n\r\nnot  mean  that  there  should  be  no  maternity\r\n\r\nbenefit  for women clerks. However, as  a  worker\r\n\r\nmyself,  I  can  say this: If you want  to  drive\r\n\r\nwomen  out  of  work and see that men  remain  in\r\n\r\nwork,  demand  as  much as  you  can  for  female\r\n\r\nworkers,   for   they  will  no  longer   be   in\r\n\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are all\r\n\r\nglad  soon to have the opportunity to discuss  in\r\n\r\nCommittee the various criticisms which the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill  has levelled against  this  Bill.\r\n\r\nThere  are two distinct types of charges  he  has\r\n\r\nmade. One is purely on the technical soundness of\r\n\r\nthe  draftmanship of the Bill, the way  in  which\r\n\r\nthe  intentions of the Government (which  are,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  fairly certain) have been expressed,  and\r\n\r\nwhat they will in fact presume to have expressed.\r\n\r\nThe other is on questions of principle - whether or\r\n\r\nnot  there  should  be  this distinction  between\r\n\r\nindustrial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand non-industrial clerks, and whether sick\r\n\r\nleave should include maternity leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the technical point, I hope that it will be\r\n\r\nsufficient to clarify the position, because  some\r\n\r\nof  the  points  which the Member  for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nraised  were raised by me in the Select Committee\r\n\r\non  the  Labour Bill - as to the interpretation  of\r\n\r\n\"misconduct\" and on clauses 6 and 7. I would like\r\n\r\nto  point out that clauses 6 and 7 of the  Clerks\r\n\r\nEmployment  Bill  are  in  identical  terms  with\r\n\r\nsections 6 and 7 of the Labour Ordinance  No.  40\r\n\r\nof  1955.  The  word \"misconduct\"  in  clause  14\r\n\r\nappears  in  section 17 of that Labour Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThe  Hon. the Attorney-General will remember that\r\n\r\nwhen I raised the point whether \"misconduct\"  was\r\n\r\nnot  too  broad a term and the whole  matter  was\r\n\r\nthoroughly  debated. Again, as to  the  lapse - the\r\n\r\nalleged  lacuna - in clause 38, as  to  what  would\r\n\r\nhappen  if  an employer deliberately  refuses  to\r\n\r\nappoint  a  medical practitioner to  examine  his\r\n\r\nworkmen,  the clause is in identical  terms  with\r\n\r\nsection 48 of the Labour Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill is at a disadvantage,\r\n\r\nfor  he  must  be  responsible  for  this  Labour\r\n\r\nOrdinance, he was then the principal advocate  of\r\n\r\nit.  He  and his Government assured me then  that\r\n\r\nthere  were no such doubts in existence, that  in\r\n\r\nfact-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I am sure the Member for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nwould  not like to be in undistinguished  company\r\n\r\nin  this  matter,  and that he will  accept  full\r\n\r\nresponsibility for all the errors  and  omissions\r\n\r\nin  the  Labour Ordinance. I am in the  fortunate\r\n\r\nposition  of  never having been a chief  minister\r\n\r\nbut  I  hope  I  shall never, if placed  in  that\r\n\r\nposition,  allow myself to be led up  the  garden\r\n\r\npath by a subordinate Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on these questions of construction and\r\n\r\ninterpretation,  let us by  all  means  have  the\r\n\r\nwhole  matter reopened. If it is finally conceded\r\n\r\nby  the  chief  legal draftman to the  Government\r\n\r\nthat   in  fact  there  may  be  ambiguity,  then\r\n\r\namendment must not only be made to these clauses,\r\n\r\nbut  also to the Labour Ordinance. Let us  always\r\n\r\nput  right  what has gone wrong, even though  the\r\n\r\nwrong was done by someone else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of principle, I support the\r\n\r\nMember  for Cairnhill - that there should not  have\r\n\r\nbeen this distinction between industrial and non-industrial clerks - and I am not satisfied with the\r\n\r\nexplanation  given  by the  Minister  for  Labour\r\n\r\nthat,   because  industrial  clerks   work   with\r\n\r\nworkmen,  therefore  they  must  have  the   same\r\n\r\nreduced  number  of holidays and  longer  working\r\n\r\nhours  per week as workmen. I think it is  a  non\r\n\r\nsequitur  to  say  that because workmen  work  44\r\n\r\nhours a week, if a tally clerk who works with the\r\n\r\nworkmen  does  39 hours per week, there  will  be\r\n\r\nfive  hours in which there will be no tally clerk\r\n\r\nworking  with  the workmen. It  does  not  follow\r\n\r\nbecause  you  can  always make the  employer  pay\r\n\r\novertime  for the five hours. I know the  counter\r\n\r\nwhich  the Minister for Labour has put in  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee,  namely, that that would be compelling\r\n\r\nindustrial  clerks  to work  overtime,  which  is\r\n\r\ncontrary  to  one of his major tenets  on  Labour\r\n\r\nrelations.

This\r\n\r\namount of $30,000,000 has now been fully taken up\r\n\r\nand  the Council requires further money to  carry\r\n\r\non  with these extension works in accordance with\r\n\r\nthe  proposals  which have been approved  in  its\r\n\r\nBudget   for   this  year.

The  $500,000  was  the\r\n\r\noriginal expenditure put up some time ago  by  the\r\n\r\nSuperintendent-designate   for   the   Pan-Malayan\r\n\r\ncensus.  Now that $500,000 has been proved  to  be\r\n\r\ngrossly  under-estimated.  When  the  estimate  of\r\n\r\n$500,000  was  put  in  the  1957  Estimates,  the\r\n\r\nSuperintendent   of   Census, Singapore,   which\r\n\r\nappointment was made in December 1956, pointed out\r\n\r\nthat  this estimate was an under-estimate and that\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Technical  Census Committee  on  census\r\n\r\nmatters  had  completed its  task,  it  should  be\r\n\r\npossible  to give more accurate figures. Now  that\r\n\r\nthe  Superintendent of Census, Singapore, has  had\r\n\r\nthe opportunity with a fair degree of accuracy  to\r\n\r\nknow  where  and  what staff can be  obtained  for\r\n\r\ncarrying out the various census operations, it has\r\n\r\nbecome\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclear that the vote is so far from sufficient  for\r\n\r\nthe  necessary  expenditure that a  supplement  is\r\n\r\nrequired of the order of $1.2 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has set up a very highly\r\n\r\norganised  machinery  to carry  out  a  thoroughly\r\n\r\nreliable  census. Fully trained,  full  time,  and\r\n\r\nadequate  field  staff under  the  supervision  of\r\n\r\ntrained senior officers of the Government will  be\r\n\r\nemployed.  The  numbers  of  supervisors,   house-numberers and enumerators have all been based on a\r\n\r\ntrial  census  held some time last  year  and  the\r\n\r\nSuperintendent of Census has given much  time  and\r\n\r\nthought  to  the  proper  reticulation  of  census\r\n\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is no need for me to stress how\r\n\r\nvitally  important  this  coming  census   is   to\r\n\r\nSingapore with the coming political changes. An up-to-date   and   thoroughly  reliable   census   of\r\n\r\npopulation  is  vital  for  the  determination  of\r\n\r\nnational  policies  in  the spheres  of  economic,\r\n\r\neducational,  social and even political  planning.\r\n\r\nConsideration  of questions relating  to  economic\r\n\r\nand  social  development,  unemployment,  housing,\r\n\r\npublic  health  and  welfare  must  be  based   on\r\n\r\naccurate facts about the population. Various plans\r\n\r\nof  social  assistance  and social  insurance  are\r\n\r\ndependent upon reliable census material. Available\r\n\r\npopulation statistics based on the last census  in\r\n\r\n1947  have now become obsolete. In fact, Sir,  the\r\n\r\ncensus  in  Singapore  is  I  speak,  subject  to\r\n\r\ncorrection- probably on a more complex scale  than\r\n\r\nthe  one  in the Federation. Conditions differ  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and in the Federation and the conclusion\r\n\r\nwas arrived at after very careful consideration at\r\n\r\nhigh  official level in both territories  that  as\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  and  the  Singapore  Governments\r\n\r\ndesire  the census in both territories  to  follow\r\n\r\nsomewhat different lines, there should be separate\r\n\r\ncensuses  for  each territory but to be  conducted\r\n\r\nsimultaneously  on the same date.  With  the  free\r\n\r\nmovement of population between Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation,   the   reasons   are   obvious    for\r\n\r\nadministrative  convenience  for  the   count   of\r\n\r\npopulation to be simultaneous in Malaya.

Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Report from the Select Committee on the\r\n\r\nSeamen's  Registry  Board Bill,  as  contained  in\r\n\r\nSessional  Paper No. L.A. 6 of 1957,  be  adopted,\r\n\r\nsubject  to the recommittal of the Bill in respect\r\n\r\nof  clauses  3 and 5 to a Committee of  the  whole\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report, Sir, of the Select Committee is\r\n\r\nbefore the House. Representations were made to the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee by all interested parties,  that\r\n\r\nis   shipowners  and  the  seamen's  unions,   and\r\n\r\nwitnesses  from  both  sides appeared  before  the\r\n\r\nSelect   Committee   and   were   examined    very\r\n\r\nthoroughly.  The salient feature of this  Bill  is\r\n\r\nthe  provision for a roster system,  and  on  that\r\n\r\nparticular feature, there was great divergence  of\r\n\r\nopinion  between  the  shipowners  and  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions.  On  the rest of the Bill, there  was  not\r\n\r\nmuch  difference of opinion between the two sides;\r\n\r\nin   fact,  representations  and  suggestions  for\r\n\r\namendment  made by one side (except of  course  on\r\n\r\nthe  roster clause), were not objected to  by  the\r\n\r\nother side and, in some cases, even accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the roster system, the employers were very\r\n\r\nemphatic  that it would operate harshly  and  that\r\n\r\nthe  harshness of the system would make  Singapore\r\n\r\nless  attractive for recruiting seamen.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthey   even  thought  that  it  might  drive   the\r\n\r\nrecruitment of seamen away from Singapore to other\r\n\r\nports, probably Hongkong. The unions, on the other\r\n\r\nhand, were equally emphatic that the roster system\r\n\r\nwas  the  only one which could prevent  corruption\r\n\r\nand  the financial \"squeezing\" of seamen, and give\r\n\r\nseamen a fair chance of getting employment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithout   their  being   preyed   upon   by\r\n\r\nunscrupulous persons in charge of the Registration\r\n\r\nBureau,   and  also  by  agents  or  servants   of\r\n\r\nemployers  who were unscrupulous enough to  demand\r\n\r\nmoney for giving them the jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to read a letter addressed to\r\n\r\nthe  Select Committee but which arrived after  the\r\n\r\nReport was prepared; it is addressed to the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee in fulfilment of a promise made  by  the\r\n\r\nunions to submit this information to it. It  is  a\r\n\r\nletter  from  representatives of the International\r\n\r\nConfederation of Free Trade Unions and I will read\r\n\r\nout  the  relevant paragraph. I may say here  that\r\n\r\nthe roster system was established in the ports  of\r\n\r\nBombay  and  in Calcutta in 1953, or  three  years\r\n\r\nago,  and it was put up by the shipowners  to  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee that the system  had  failed  in\r\n\r\nCalcutta as far as they knew. On this point,  this\r\n\r\nis  what  the I.C.F.T.U. representatives  have  to\r\n\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The roster register system of selection and\r\n\r\nengagement prevailed in both recruitment centres\r\n\r\nunder rules and regulations found generally\r\n\r\nacceptable.\" -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>that is referring to Calcutta and Bombay-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The two offices have now been in operation for\r\n\r\nsome  three years. Speaking for the large body  of\r\n\r\nseamen,  we  can  say most emphatically  that  the\r\n\r\nscheme  has  proven,  a success.  It  has  ensured\r\n\r\nfairness  and  equity in selection and  engagement\r\n\r\nmatters  .  . . It has, to our personal knowledge,\r\n\r\nfreed  seamen from the stranglehold of  interested\r\n\r\npetty   unions,   and   company   and   government\r\n\r\nofficials.  We  are  not in a  position  to  state\r\n\r\nwhether  any  avenue for corruption still  exists,\r\n\r\nbut  this  we do know from our personal  knowledge\r\n\r\nand investigations - that job-buying no longer holds\r\n\r\nsway  and  that  the  seamen, by  and  large,  are\r\n\r\nsatisfied with the working of the scheme.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a great deal of deliberation, the\r\n\r\nCommittee,  on  balance, decided that  the  roster\r\n\r\nsystem  should be preserved as it appears  in  the\r\n\r\ndraft  Bill,  and  therefore  provisions  for  the\r\n\r\nsystem  still  remain. However, the harshness  has\r\n\r\nbeen  lessened to a great extent by  removing  the\r\n\r\nfour-year  limitation clause. The  original  draft\r\n\r\nBill  contains  a  limitation clause  whereby  the\r\n\r\nshipowner  could  retain  the  services   of   old\r\n\r\nseamen - those who had served with him - for up  to  a\r\n\r\nmaximum\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  four years, provided he signed them on  within\r\n\r\nseven  days.  That four-year clause has  now  been\r\n\r\nremoved so that a seaman can continue to work  for\r\n\r\nan  employer for as long as he likes, provided  he\r\n\r\nis  signed on within seven days, and the  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  certain  discretionary powers to  waive  even\r\n\r\nthis seven-day limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowance is also now made for the transfer of\r\n\r\nseamen  between ships of the same  owner.  In  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Bill, a seaman had to sign on  with  the\r\n\r\nsame ship within seven days but he was not allowed\r\n\r\nto  sign  on  with  a different ship  although  it\r\n\r\nbelonged  to  the same owner. That  has  now  been\r\n\r\nprovided for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main amendments to the Bill therefore, are\r\n\r\nthe  removal  of the four-year limitation  clause,\r\n\r\nand provision for seamen to sign on with different\r\n\r\nships  of  the same owner. There is also provision\r\n\r\nwhereby  a  seaman who wants to take  two  months'\r\n\r\nleave  and go, say, to the Federation, can  inform\r\n\r\nthe  Registry Office that he will not be available\r\n\r\nfor  employment and thereby not lose his place  on\r\n\r\nthe  roster.  There  is  also  provision  for  the\r\n\r\nemergency  recruitment of seamen when the  Board's\r\n\r\noffice  is  closed or in case of other  emergency,\r\n\r\nsubject to report being made to the Board.  These,\r\n\r\nI  think,  are the main changes to the Bill  which\r\n\r\nthe Committee has made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned a little while back that the\r\n\r\nMinister  has been given discretion to  waive  the\r\n\r\nseven-day  requirement. That was  found  necessary\r\n\r\nbecause in some cases ships sailing regularly from\r\n\r\nSingapore to neighbouring ports are put in service\r\n\r\nin  the harbour limit of Singapore while they  are\r\n\r\nhere.   Seamen  working  on  these  ships  cannot,\r\n\r\ntherefore, be articled; they cannot sign  articles\r\n\r\nwhen  they are working within the harbour limit - it\r\n\r\nis  only  when they go out of harbour limits  that\r\n\r\nthey  sign articles. Therefore, what would  happen\r\n\r\nif these ships operated within harbour limits for,\r\n\r\nsay,  a  month? When the ships want to  leave  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  harbour  limit for  another  port,  the\r\n\r\nowners  would  then have to go to  the  roster  to\r\n\r\nengage a new crew and to discharge the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nold  crew. It is in such cases that the  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  the discretion, provided a recommendation  to\r\n\r\nthat effect is put up to him by the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course there will be a lot of criticism on\r\n\r\nthe  roster system - I do not expect that there will\r\n\r\nnot  be  any.  The whole spirit of the legislation\r\n\r\ncan  only  be  realised if there  is  co-operation\r\n\r\nbetween  the representatives of the employers  and\r\n\r\nthe unions on the Board.

Sir,\r\n\r\nI  received  a  telephone call from a  person  who\r\n\r\npurported  to represent a group of shipowners;  he\r\n\r\ntold  me how very dangerous the roster system  was\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore,  how detrimental  it  was  to  our\r\n\r\nentrepot trade; and he assured me that I would  be\r\n\r\nvery well paid as a solicitor for this group if  I\r\n\r\nwould  undertake  to  vote  against  it  in   this\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I was so angry at the time, so rude,\r\n\r\nthat  I  forgot to take note of the name.

However,   on\r\n\r\ncompletion  of my reading, I really was astonished\r\n\r\nto  find that the roster clause was still included\r\n\r\nin  the  Bill.  I gained the impression  from  the\r\n\r\nMinutes of Evidence that the Members of the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  themselves entertained a good  deal  of\r\n\r\nanxiety  about this clause and, indeed,  had  very\r\n\r\ngrave  doubts about the wisdom of introducing  the\r\n\r\nroster system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence on the shipowners' side appeared to\r\n\r\nme  to be perfectly clear, and of course there was\r\n\r\nno  doubt that they were definitely not in  favour\r\n\r\nof the roster system. Now, it seems to me that the\r\n\r\nshipowners had no real financial stake in this and\r\n\r\nthat their opinion was genuine and objective.  The\r\n\r\nevidence on behalf of the unions was given by  the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the Seamen's Council of  Action\r\n\r\nand,  in  my  view,  that evidence  was  sometimes\r\n\r\nrather  vague and unconvincing. In Appendix  I  of\r\n\r\nthe Sessional Paper L.A. 6 of 1957, the Council of\r\n\r\nAction state that they represent all 12 registered\r\n\r\nseamen's unions in the colony-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> What page?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> I beg your pardon- it is just at\r\n\r\nthe beginning, Appendix I, page 5 of the Sessional\r\n\r\nPaper.

Well, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nhave  been  given to understand that the  Seamen's\r\n\r\nCouncil  of Action was called into being  for  the\r\n\r\nsole  purpose  of forming one single  non-communal\r\n\r\nunion.  This purpose has not so far, I understand,\r\n\r\nbeen  achieved by the Seamen's Council of  Action,\r\n\r\nand   indeed  there  have  been  reports  in   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  of unions resigning from  the  Council\r\n\r\nand  rejoining it.

We\r\n\r\noften hear the expressions \"happy team\" and \"happy\r\n\r\noffice\", and often a \"happy home\", but it seems to\r\n\r\nme  that  a  \"happy ship\" is of greater importance\r\n\r\nthan any of these, for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I am being rather naive, but I also\r\n\r\nfelt, in reading the Minutes of Evidence, that the\r\n\r\nshipowners'  representatives seemed  to  have  the\r\n\r\ninterests and welfare of their seamen at heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Sutherland talks about\r\n\r\nhaving  a  \"happy  ship\"  and  selecting  a  happy\r\n\r\ncrew - can he inform us as to how the roster  system\r\n\r\nprevents this from coming about?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Have patience, and I will try to\r\n\r\ndo   that.  I  was  saying  that  the  shipowners'\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  seemed  genuinely  to  have   the\r\n\r\ninterests  and welfare of their seamen  at  heart,\r\n\r\nand  that  they  were convinced  that  the  roster\r\n\r\nsystem, which is, after all, an untried novelty in\r\n\r\nSingapore, will not be a success in Singapore. For\r\n\r\nmy  own  part, I feel rather apprehensive  of  the\r\n\r\nsystem - and  I will now answer the Minister - because\r\n\r\nof  the  multi-racial population of this  City  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, so much of it Chinese and so much of it\r\n\r\nChinese  clansmen. Added to that are the  problems\r\n\r\nof different religions and sundry inhibitions. The\r\n\r\nlimitation, therefore, of two rosters seems to  me\r\n\r\nto  be  a  very grave difficulty to get over;  and\r\n\r\nthere  is another point - no other industry  has  a\r\n\r\nroster system imposed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non it, so why pick on the shipping industry?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate, Sir, that the main purpose of this\r\n\r\nsystem  is to eliminate corruption, but  has  that\r\n\r\nbeen    referred   to   the   Corrupt    Practices\r\n\r\nInvestigation   Bureau   for   investigation   and\r\n\r\nsubsequent report? If not, why not? Would  it  not\r\n\r\nbe  better  to  refer this matter  first  to  that\r\n\r\nBureau before introducing a system which obviously\r\n\r\nhas  defects  and has been tried out in  only  one\r\n\r\ncountry,  where  its success, as we  know  it,  is\r\n\r\nbased merely on one letter which we have had  read\r\n\r\nto  us this afternoon by the Minister for Commerce\r\n\r\nand Industry?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not intend to vote against this Bill,\r\n\r\nbut  it  seems  to me that there are  one  or  two\r\n\r\npoints I have raised which require consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> In reply, Sir. I can\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  grave  doubts  and  apprehensions\r\n\r\nexpressed  by  Mr Sutherland but I am  sure  that\r\n\r\nthose fears will not be found to be true when  the\r\n\r\nroster  system is working. Perhaps I must  explain\r\n\r\nat  the  outset  how I envisage the roster  system\r\n\r\nshould  work. The Bill provides for  a  roster  or\r\n\r\nrosters.  In  addition to that,  I  have  made  an\r\n\r\namendment  to it in Select Committee  setting  out\r\n\r\nthat the Board may also subdivide the rosters into\r\n\r\ncategory  or  categories.  In  Singapore  at   the\r\n\r\nmoment,  seamen are recruited by clans, especially\r\n\r\nwhere  the Chinese are concerned. There are  three\r\n\r\nmain  categories  of seamen - deck crew - sailors  who\r\n\r\nwork on deck - engine room crew, who work below  in\r\n\r\nthe  engine room; and catering staff, who are  the\r\n\r\nwaiters,  cooks and so on. The Board  can  provide\r\n\r\nthree separate rosters, one for deck crew, one for\r\n\r\nengine room crew and one for catering staff. These\r\n\r\nrosters  can  again  be  sub-divided  into  racial\r\n\r\ncategories    or    sections - Malays,    Hainanese,\r\n\r\nCantonese, Foochow and so on. If on a certain ship\r\n\r\nyou  have say, only Hainanese catering staff,  and\r\n\r\nif that ship wants to recruit two more caterers,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey go to the catering staff roster. The employers\r\n\r\nsee  the  two  names at the top  are  of  Cantonese\r\n\r\ncaterers. If these are engaged, there is  going  to\r\n\r\nbe  trouble on board the ship. What they do then is\r\n\r\nthat they are referred to the Hainanese section  of\r\n\r\nthe  catering staff roster, and so they  get  their\r\n\r\nHainanese  seamen. The same thing will apply  where\r\n\r\ndeck crew are concerned. Some ships have Malay deck\r\n\r\ncrew  and  must therefore recruit only  Malays;  so\r\n\r\nthey  will be referred to the Malay section of  the\r\n\r\ndeck crew roster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shipowners' real objection, as I see it, is\r\n\r\nbased  on  the fear that they will have to  recruit\r\n\r\nsome  seamen who have in the past been found to  be\r\n\r\nuseless  or idle or are loafers, who they know  are\r\n\r\nnot going to do their work efficiently. If that  is\r\n\r\nso - in   fact   I  raised  this  point   in   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee - the answer is that if a seaman  is  found\r\n\r\nby  a  captain to be loafing, idle or  useless,  he\r\n\r\nshould  then not give the seaman a good  discharge,\r\n\r\nso  that he will then be penalised by the Board and\r\n\r\nwill  not  then be put in the proper place  on  the\r\n\r\nroster.  But  if seamen are given good  discharges,\r\n\r\nthen  there is no case against them, and I  do  not\r\n\r\nsee  why  they  should be refused employment  by  a\r\n\r\nshipowner claiming that they are lazy when in  fact\r\n\r\ntheir  discharges are good. If the captain finds  a\r\n\r\nseaman to be lazy, incompetent or insubordinate, he\r\n\r\nhas a right to give him a bad discharge. So that is\r\n\r\nthe answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other real fear, I think, is that shipowners\r\n\r\nare  afraid that there will be no choice  and  that\r\n\r\nthey  will get trade unionists on board ships; that\r\n\r\nis, I think the real fear behind their minds. But I\r\n\r\ndo   not   see   any   way  of   preventing   trade\r\n\r\nunionists - provided they are good workers, and  take\r\n\r\ninterest  in their work and discharge their  duties\r\n\r\nefficiently - why trade unionists  should  not  get\r\n\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides a shipowner with two choices.\r\n\r\nIf  he  comes round to the Board's office and says,\r\n\r\n\"I want 10 Malay deck crew\", he may be given 12, 15\r\n\r\nor  20  names  to  choose from, as  the  Board  may\r\n\r\ndecide. Great latitude is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven to the Board. The number of names offered  is\r\n\r\nnot fixed by the Bill. The Board can decide that if\r\n\r\nan  owner  wants 10 seamen, it offers 15, where  he\r\n\r\nwants 20 it offers 30, where he wants 100 it offers\r\n\r\n150, or where he wants one, it offers two - the Board\r\n\r\ncan  decide  how many names to offer for selection.\r\n\r\nNow  when  10  are  asked for and 15  offered,  the\r\n\r\nshipowner has a choice. He may pick not 10  out  of\r\n\r\nthe  15  but only seven, and say, \"Sorry, the  rest\r\n\r\nare  no good to me.\" He still wants three more - and\r\n\r\nhe will be given another three from the next on the\r\n\r\nroster;  so  he  has  a second  choice  then.  That\r\n\r\nlatitude  has been provided for; to say, therefore,\r\n\r\nthat  certain  seamen who are  \"residue\"  and  whom\r\n\r\nshipowners  do not want to employ will get  to  the\r\n\r\ntop  of the roster, is unfair. Probably they do not\r\n\r\nwant  to  employ them because they are known  trade\r\n\r\nunionists,   or,   as   the   owners   call   them,\r\n\r\n\"agitators\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Council of Action, Sir, I admit it was set\r\n\r\nup  for  the  purpose of uniting  seamen  into  one\r\n\r\nunion.  I have received a letter today, dated  25th\r\n\r\nApril, from the Seamen's Council of Action, and  it\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"To date, seven seamen's unions, including\r\n\r\npractically  all  the big unions, have  signed  the\r\n\r\nresolution  of  amalgamation  to  form  one  single\r\n\r\nseafarers' union under the auspices of the Seamen's\r\n\r\nCouncil of Action to be called the Singapore  Union\r\n\r\nof  Seafarers  with  autonomous  sections  of  ship\r\n\r\nofficers,  seamen, harbour craft  workers,  and  an\r\n\r\ninterim  committee  has been  set  up  .  .  .  The\r\n\r\nremaining five seamen's unions will also  be  asked\r\n\r\nto  dissolve themselves and get their membership to\r\n\r\njoin  the new union for the sake of unity.  Whether\r\n\r\nthey do or not, little difficulty is expected.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know - and I have some knowledge as far\r\n\r\nas  these unions are concerned - out of the remaining\r\n\r\nfive, only one matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested that this roster system is\r\n\r\nan   untried  novelty  and,  therefore,  there   is\r\n\r\napprehension  about  its implementation.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nRendel  Constitution and this  Assembly  also  were\r\n\r\nuntried novelties two years ago. Well, there is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  difference of opinion on how it works - some  are\r\n\r\nsatisfied, some are not - but the point is  that  if\r\n\r\nyou   stick  to  the  conservative  practice,   of\r\n\r\nrefusing  to introduce reforms or to try  out  new\r\n\r\nthings, you will never advance; you will not,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  have  the hydrogen bomb.  That  is  not,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  a  valid reason for  refusing  to  try\r\n\r\nsomething  which  you  do not  know  may  prove  a\r\n\r\nsuccess; if it proves a failure, and if shipowners\r\n\r\ngo  out to other ports to recruit seamen, probably\r\n\r\nwe  will  have  to come back to this Assembly  and\r\n\r\nrepeal that portion of the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the question why no other industry\r\n\r\nhas  this  roster system, why only this particular\r\n\r\nindustry  has it, is simple: in no other  industry\r\n\r\nare  persons  engaged on a casual basis.  In  most\r\n\r\nindustries on land, there is permanent employment.\r\n\r\nWhen  a man is taken on, he continues working with\r\n\r\nthe   firm,  provided  he  is  efficient,  is  not\r\n\r\ninsubordinate  and  is found to  be  suitable,  or\r\n\r\nprovided  the firm does not close down. But  in  a\r\n\r\nship, a seaman signs articles for that, six months\r\n\r\nor,  if it is an ocean-going, long voyage ship for\r\n\r\ntwo years. After that period, he comes back and is\r\n\r\nthrown  out  of employment. There is no obligation\r\n\r\non  the part of the employer to reengage him,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  he  may not be able to find  employment\r\n\r\nafter returning from a particular voyage, or after\r\n\r\nhe  has  finished  his term of service  with  that\r\n\r\nship.  The  roster system, therefore, is necessary\r\n\r\nin  order to give him some security of employment.\r\n\r\nHe  knows that when he comes back, he can put  his\r\n\r\nname  down  on  the  roster and has  a  reasonable\r\n\r\nchance  that  in  so many months he  can  work  in\r\n\r\nanother ship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as I said, the system can fail if there\r\n\r\nis  no co-operation between shipowners and unions,\r\n\r\nand  that  is what I fear. If only shipowners  and\r\n\r\nunions will co-operate, I am sure the system  will\r\n\r\nwork.  If  any  defects are found, we  can  always\r\n\r\nlegislate to remove them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final question which Mr Sutherland asked\r\n\r\nwas that if corruption is prevalent,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhy  has there not been an investigation?\r\n\r\nThere has been an investigation into corruption; I\r\n\r\nmentioned it at the Second Reading of this Bill. I\r\n\r\nbelieve it was in 1950 but the report was that  no\r\n\r\nproof of corruption was found. We tried to abolish\r\n\r\nthe  ghaut  serang system and put in  the  present\r\n\r\nsystem, but it has not worked successfully and  we\r\n\r\nknow  that  in  fact  there  is  some  amount   of\r\n\r\nfinancial   \"squeeze\"  of  seamen  by   interested\r\n\r\nparties. I will not name them here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

I know  that\r\n\r\nin  this  Assembly everybody is trying to  give  a\r\n\r\ngood  deal  to workers, but if they are  going  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  what they think are good  measures  but\r\n\r\nwhich  finally  deprive them of  employment,  then\r\n\r\nthey will not be doing a good turn to the seamen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Select Committee Report, I know that\r\n\r\nshipowners are not very happy about this, and  that\r\n\r\nthey  need  a  great  deal  of  persuasion  by  the\r\n\r\nDepartment concerned to co-operate in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if this clause is adopted, I think there is\r\n\r\nstill  another  escape  for  ship-owners - they   can\r\n\r\nemploy seamen who are in transit: these people  can\r\n\r\ncome  to Singapore to join their ships. I know that\r\n\r\nships   come  to  Singapore  because  this   is   a\r\n\r\nconvenient port and because they make Singapore the\r\n\r\nfocal   point  for  trade  in  South-East  Asia - and\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  benefited  from  this  to  a  great\r\n\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are trying to protect seamen, but I hope that\r\n\r\nthis  protection is for local seamen only  and  not\r\n\r\nthose  who  come  here,  park  themselves  in  this\r\n\r\nColony,  owe  allegiance to other  lands  and  then\r\n\r\nbenefit from our laws. I think protection should be\r\n\r\ngiven  only to the citizens of Singapore, to  those\r\n\r\nwho     will    become    citizens,    and     not,\r\n\r\nindiscriminately,  to  people  who  owe  allegiance\r\n\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard that a number of ships which\r\n\r\ncontemplated   registering   in   Singapore    have\r\n\r\ntransferred their registration to other  countries.\r\n\r\nThis means a loss to us. This also means that these\r\n\r\nships need not comply with our laws. This will mean\r\n\r\nthat  shipowners may not offer their  co-operation,\r\n\r\nand  may  take  seamen  from other  ports  instead.\r\n\r\nAgain,  some  local ships, I have been informed  by\r\n\r\nreliable   people,  have  avoided  Singapore   and,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  coming from Bangkok to  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthen  going  to other South-East Asian ports,  have\r\n\r\nproceeded straight from Bangkok to other ports like\r\n\r\nKuching.  In such cases, not only will  our  seamen\r\n\r\nlose their chances of being employed, but Singapore\r\n\r\nwill also lose a great deal of its entrepot trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear the Minister say that he is going to\r\n\r\ndevise a system whereby there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  be  sub-sections in his rosters according  to\r\n\r\nrace  of  seamen,  and types of work.  But  if  the\r\n\r\nroster system is implemented in this way, what will\r\n\r\nprevent  seamen from a particular race  being  left\r\n\r\nout  all  the  time? If you have many  ships  which\r\n\r\nemploy  Chinese  seamen, and only  Chinese  seamen,\r\n\r\nwhere  will  the Malay seamen find employment?  How\r\n\r\nwill  the roster system help them in securing jobs?\r\n\r\nIt seems that with a roster having many sections, a\r\n\r\nseaman  will  not  get  much  protection.  It  will\r\n\r\nprobably  turn  out to be a white  elephant  to  be\r\n\r\ndiscarded after some time. The main-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.
