Members will be aware of the growing\r\n\r\npublic concern at the increase in gangsterism  and\r\n\r\nsecret society activities of recent months, and as\r\n\r\nindicated  in the Governor's speech on 9th  April,\r\n\r\nthe   Government   considers  it   imperative   to\r\n\r\nstrengthen the laws by which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese   activities   can   be   more   effectively\r\n\r\ncountered.  The  majority  of  these  crimes   are\r\n\r\ncommitted by individual gangsters or by  gangs  of\r\n\r\nthugs,  who  expect to retain all the proceeds  or\r\n\r\nnearly  all the proceeds of their crimes and  look\r\n\r\nonly to their parent secret societies - if I may put\r\n\r\nit  that  way - for protection from prosecution  and\r\n\r\nfor  protection against rival gangs.  These  gangs\r\n\r\nhold  sway  in  their own particular areas,  where\r\n\r\nthey   organise  gambling,  smuggling,  vice   and\r\n\r\nextortion rackets of different kinds. They provoke\r\n\r\ngang  fights  and they intimidate the  law-abiding\r\n\r\npublic into the payment of protection money. Their\r\n\r\nhold, Sir, is such as to frighten the public  from\r\n\r\ngiving evidence against them, and their efforts to\r\n\r\ncontrol each other's activities very often lead to\r\n\r\nviolent clashes between different gangs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is regrettably true, Sir, that in 1957, the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  gang fights, which was 150,  was  more\r\n\r\nthan in all the three previous years put together,\r\n\r\nand  that  figure  has  not - regrettably - decreased\r\n\r\nthis year since there have been 68 such fights  in\r\n\r\nthe first three months of this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the members of these gangs are\r\n\r\nunder  30  years of age and mostly, as far  as  we\r\n\r\nknow,  are born in Singapore. It directly reflects\r\n\r\nthe serious social and economic problems presented\r\n\r\nby  the  great increase in Singapore's  population\r\n\r\nsince  the  War, problems which are receiving  the\r\n\r\nearnest attention of the Government but which  are\r\n\r\nnot  easy or susceptible to an early solution. The\r\n\r\ncauses of this delinquency can be eradicated  over\r\n\r\na  period of years only by improvement of economic\r\n\r\nand  social conditions and by active youth welfare\r\n\r\nand educational work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is doing all in its power to\r\n\r\nfurther  these  aims  but  in  the  meantime   the\r\n\r\nimmediate  need is to preserve the  peace  of  the\r\n\r\nColony and to protect the law-abiding public  from\r\n\r\nthe  criminal  activities of these  gangsters.  In\r\n\r\nthis,  Sir, the police, the public and the  Courts\r\n\r\nall  have  a part to play. The police require  the\r\n\r\nsupport and the confidence of the public not  only\r\n\r\nin  providing  information of  actual  crimes  and\r\n\r\nprojected crimes, but also in willingness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto come forward and to give evidence against those\r\n\r\nresponsible. The Courts, for their part, can  only\r\n\r\nadminister the laws enacted by the Legislature and\r\n\r\nit  is  for this Assembly to ensure that they  are\r\n\r\narmed  with the laws and the sanctions  which  the\r\n\r\npresent situation requires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the existing provisions in the Criminal\r\n\r\nJustice (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance whereby a\r\n\r\nsentence  of  corrective  training  or  preventive\r\n\r\ndetention  can  only  be  imposed  on   proof   of\r\n\r\nmembership  of,  or connection with,  an  unlawful\r\n\r\nsociety,  has not proved as effective as had  been\r\n\r\nhoped,  even though special provision is  made  in\r\n\r\nsection   6   to  facilitate  evidence   of   such\r\n\r\nmembership.  In  a number of such cases  in  which\r\n\r\ncharges   are  brought  of  offences  particularly\r\n\r\nassociated   with   the   activities   of   secret\r\n\r\nsocieties,  there has not been the proof  required\r\n\r\nin  relation  to membership of the secret  society\r\n\r\nand it has not therefore proved possible to invoke\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of this Ordinance. The purpose  of\r\n\r\nclause  2 of this amending Bill is to remedy  that\r\n\r\nposition  and to provide the Courts with  a  wider\r\n\r\ndiscretion  than they at present have in  applying\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of this Ordinance, by removing the\r\n\r\ncondition   precedent  that  membership   of,   or\r\n\r\nconnection  with,  an  unlawful  society  must  be\r\n\r\nproved in addition to the conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important amendment, Sir, to the\r\n\r\nprincipal  Ordinance is in clause 3  of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  empowers the arrest of any person found  in\r\n\r\nthe  immediate vicinity of, or escaping from,  any\r\n\r\nplace  in which a disturbance is occurring or  has\r\n\r\nrecently   occurred,  or   any   place   where   a\r\n\r\ndisturbance, according to information received  by\r\n\r\nthe  police,  is  likely to take  place,  and  any\r\n\r\nperson  who  is  reasonably  suspected  of   being\r\n\r\nconnected with a secret society. Such a person can\r\n\r\nbe  required, under this provision, by a Court  to\r\n\r\nshow cause why he should not be ordered to sign  a\r\n\r\nbond to keep the peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power is also given to the Courts to impose a\r\n\r\ncurfew  order on such a person. For breach of  the\r\n\r\nbond or the order, such a person will be liable to\r\n\r\nimprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonths, or to a fine not exceeding $1,000,  or  to\r\n\r\nboth such imprisonment and fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, Sir, it often happens that the\r\n\r\npolice, arriving at the scene of a planned  clash,\r\n\r\nin  time to prevent it, or arriving shortly  after\r\n\r\none  has occurred, find persons present whom  they\r\n\r\nhave  good reason to know are the fighter elements\r\n\r\nof  the  secret societies concerned, but short  of\r\n\r\ncatching  them in actual possession  of  offensive\r\n\r\nweapons,  the police are powerless since witnesses\r\n\r\nfrom  the neighbourhood are not prepared  to  come\r\n\r\nforward to give evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like, Sir, to emphasise on this\r\n\r\nparticular  clause  that it is not  intended  that\r\n\r\nthis power should be used in any arbitrary manner.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the clause provides that the police must\r\n\r\ntake  the  individual before the Court and  it  is\r\n\r\nprovided   in  the  following  clause   that   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of section 80 of the Criminal Procedure\r\n\r\nCode  shall apply to an enquiry by the Court under\r\n\r\nthis  clause.  And  section  80  of  the  Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure Code provides that where such  an  order\r\n\r\nhas  been made and a person appears or is  brought\r\n\r\nbefore  a Court in compliance with or in execution\r\n\r\nof  a  summons or warrant, the Court shall proceed\r\n\r\nto  enquire into the truth of the information upon\r\n\r\nwhich  it  is  acting, and to  take  such  further\r\n\r\nevidence as appears necessary. Such enquiry  shall\r\n\r\nbe  made as nearly as is practicable in the manner\r\n\r\nhereof prescribed for conducting trials in summary\r\n\r\ncases, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I suggest to hon. Members that although this\r\n\r\nis  an  exceptional power of arrest,  a  safeguard\r\n\r\nagainst  injustice  to innocent  people  is  amply\r\n\r\nprovided  for by the provisions which ensure  that\r\n\r\nthere  shall  be a proper enquiry before  a  Court\r\n\r\nbefore  anyone is required to execute  a  bond  as\r\n\r\nprovided in this clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final amendment to the principal\r\n\r\nOrdinance  is in clause 4 of the Bill  which  adds\r\n\r\nthe  offences  of  carrying  knives  or  offensive\r\n\r\nweapons in public, loitering with intent to commit\r\n\r\na   seizable  offence  and  offences   under   the\r\n\r\nCorrosive Substances Ordinance, 1956, to the  list\r\n\r\nof scheduled offences under the principal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrdinance. The reason for this, Sir, is that these\r\n\r\nare  the  types  of offences which are  frequently\r\n\r\ncommitted by persons associated with gang warfare.\r\n\r\nHon.  Members will be aware of the ingenuity shown\r\n\r\nby  these  gangsters  in devising  and  concealing\r\n\r\nweapons which are capable of killing their victims\r\n\r\nor  maiming  them for life, and of the  increasing\r\n\r\nuse  in  recent months of the particularly vicious\r\n\r\nweapon of acid bombs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe it will be the wish of all hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this Assembly to see the  scourge  of\r\n\r\ngang  warfare  wiped  out  from  our  midst.   The\r\n\r\nlegislation  now proposed is designed  to  further\r\n\r\nthat  purpose and no more. I have every hope that,\r\n\r\nwith  the co-operation of the public, which  I  am\r\n\r\nglad  to say is increasing daily, this legislation\r\n\r\nwill  strengthen the organs of law  and  order  in\r\n\r\nremoving this menace from our midst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.19 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  am  happy  that the Government  has  now  given\r\n\r\nconsideration to an amending Bill to  tighten  the\r\n\r\nactivities of secret societies, first, in amending\r\n\r\nthis   Criminal  Justice  (Temporary   Provisions)\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Ordinance and following on, the  Penal\r\n\r\nCode  Ordinance. I believe that this is the result\r\n\r\nof the question filed by me, which was answered by\r\n\r\nthe   Chief  Secretary  yesterday.  Without   that\r\n\r\nquestion  I  doubt that the Government would  ever\r\n\r\nhave considered amending these two Ordinances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day we hear of gang clashes, gang fights\r\n\r\nand  secret  society activities, and  of  innocent\r\n\r\npeople  or innocent citizens being victimised  and\r\n\r\nassaulted.  Unless  these gang clashes  by  secret\r\n\r\nsocieties  are stopped immediately,  I  am  afraid\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government machinery will cease  to  be\r\n\r\neffective and is bound to collapse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, Sir, the Bill is a good one and I\r\n\r\nshould  say  that it merits the support  of  every\r\n\r\nsane  and sensible Member of this House. But, Sir,\r\n\r\nhowever much I would like to support it,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  am  more anxious about its application when  it\r\n\r\nbecomes law. It would appear that there are  cases\r\n\r\nwhen  the police can be very fair, but also  other\r\n\r\ncases  when  the police can abuse  the  powers  of\r\n\r\ninvestigation given to them. We need not  go  very\r\n\r\nfar  for an example, Sir. Even the application  of\r\n\r\nthe  Preservation of Public Security Ordinance  is\r\n\r\nsubject  to abuse. Just look at the complaints  of\r\n\r\ntorture received by Members of this Assembly which\r\n\r\nhave  prompted me to table a motion that  will  be\r\n\r\ndebated   at  a  later  hour  today  or   sometime\r\n\r\ntomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is there, Sir, to prevent an innocent person\r\n\r\nbeing  dragged  in  for nothing under  this  Bill?\r\n\r\nClause  3  is  very delicate and I  am  sure  that\r\n\r\neveryone,  including  the  Chief  Secretary,  will\r\n\r\nagree  that  there are loopholes in it for  abuse.\r\n\r\nClause 3 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The principal Ordinance is hereby amended by inserting immediately after section 3 thereof, the following new section:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3A.-(l) Where a police officer not below the rank of Inspector-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) on receipt of information which he\r\n\r\nconsiders  to be reliable that a disturbance\r\n\r\nis  likely to occur in any place proceeds to\r\n\r\nsuch   place  and  finds  in  the  immediate\r\n\r\nvicinity thereof or departing therefrom, or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) finds in the immediate vicinity of, or\r\n\r\ndeparting  from,  any  place  in   which   a\r\n\r\ndisturbance  is  occurring or  has  recently\r\n\r\ntaken place.....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Secretary said just now that if a\r\n\r\nperson  is  present somewhere near  a  disturbance\r\n\r\nthat has taken place, then a police inspector,  or\r\n\r\nanybody  above  the  rank of  inspector,  who  has\r\n\r\nreason to believe that any person found there have\r\n\r\nconnections with such disturbance, have got powers\r\n\r\nof  arrest. But much as I would like to say I have\r\n\r\nconfidence in the police force, may I mention that\r\n\r\nmost  of  the junior police officers or detectives\r\n\r\nwere themselves members of secret societies before\r\n\r\nthey  joined  the  force?  I  think  they  form  a\r\n\r\nmajority,   although  I  see  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation  shaking his head; he  himself  must  be\r\n\r\nfully aware of that. That being the case, Sir,  it\r\n\r\nmay  be that if there is an old grudge, this  Bill\r\n\r\nwill  come  in  very  handy to them.  An  innocent\r\n\r\nperson may be going across\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  road  or  walking along one where a disturbance\r\n\r\nhas  just  occurred. What is there to prevent  him\r\n\r\nfrom  being arrested or at least being subject  to\r\n\r\ninterrogation, thus wasting his time and also  the\r\n\r\ngood and valuable time of the police themselves?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unless there are safeguards against such\r\n\r\npossible victimisations, and the police force  has\r\n\r\ngone through a thorough cleaning, I am afraid that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  loopholes for  abuse.  The  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary said just now that there are safeguards,\r\n\r\nunder  section 80 of the Ordinance, I think - I  did\r\n\r\nnot  catch him properly. That may be so, but  such\r\n\r\narbitrary  powers  given to the police  cannot  in\r\n\r\nfact  be  well safeguarded under a section  of  an\r\n\r\nOrdinance; there should be fuller provisions about\r\n\r\nusing the discretion to make arrests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government can assure me that such\r\n\r\nsafeguards exist and that the powers will  not  be\r\n\r\nabused by police officers who may at times have no\r\n\r\ndiscretion about arrest, I am prepared to  support\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.25 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  are  all  aware  that  gangsterism  has  taken\r\n\r\ncontrol in Singapore in many aspects of life.  The\r\n\r\nenquiry  into corrupt practices has  given  us  an\r\n\r\ninsight into the secret societies' influence  over\r\n\r\nthe  public. We must eradicate this and substitute\r\n\r\nit  by  better  law and order; we  must  give  the\r\n\r\npolice  a greater measure of power to enable  them\r\n\r\nto protect innocent people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a question is put forward to me, `Would you\r\n\r\nlike to have the powers in the hands of the secret\r\n\r\nsocieties,  or  in the hands of  the  police?',  I\r\n\r\nwould definitely say: `We want the powers to be in\r\n\r\nthe hands of the police - but just sufficient powers\r\n\r\nto  enable them to protect us and no more, so that\r\n\r\nthey will not be in a position to misuse them'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, Sir, this Bill goes a long way to\r\n\r\nhelping  the  people get rid of secret  societies.\r\n\r\nBut whilst we want to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nget  rid of the secret societies, we also want  to\r\n\r\nprotect innocent people. They have every right  to\r\n\r\nbe  protected. We do not want to see  an  innocent\r\n\r\nman  hauled into a police station, kept there  for\r\n\r\n24  hours  or  made  to appear before  the  police\r\n\r\ncourt,  and after that released. The inconvenience\r\n\r\nhe  has to undergo would be sufficient to make him\r\n\r\nfeel that the police is not his friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt there has been a great deal of\r\n\r\nexplanation  as to how this Bill will be  operated\r\n\r\nwhen it becomes law; no doubt there are safeguards\r\n\r\nin  section 80 of the Criminal Procedure Code. But\r\n\r\nI would like the Press, especially, to put it over\r\n\r\nto  the  people  how  this law will  operate - that\r\n\r\nunless   they  are  criminals  or  secret  society\r\n\r\ngangsters,  they  will not be  hauled  in  by  the\r\n\r\npolice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I think the Chief Secretary\r\n\r\nshould  give detailed instructions as to how  this\r\n\r\nlaw should be enforced. Every known secret society\r\n\r\nmember  should  be hauled in, but anybody  who  is\r\n\r\nreasonably regarded as not being a secret  society\r\n\r\nmember should be given the benefit of the doubt. I\r\n\r\nknow  that  whether  a person  is  in  the  secret\r\n\r\nsociety  movement  or not is  well  known  to  the\r\n\r\npolice.  They  have  a record  of  secret  society\r\n\r\nmembers.  They also have an unofficial  record  of\r\n\r\nsecret  society members. If arrests are  made  and\r\n\r\ncases  brought before the Courts after the  police\r\n\r\nhave  consulted  all these records,  nothing  much\r\n\r\nwill go wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if an inspector acts on just suspicion and\r\n\r\nuses  his  own  discretion, there might  be  cases\r\n\r\nwhere  old  scores may be squared. We  must  avoid\r\n\r\nthis. No old scores should be squared. This law is\r\n\r\nmeant for the purpose of keeping law and order and\r\n\r\nit should remain so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this, Sir, because I know that whenever a\r\n\r\nraid is being carried out, a police inspector will\r\n\r\ntake  out  a  dozen or more men to the scene.  The\r\n\r\ninspector would be there but the arrests would  be\r\n\r\nmade by the constables and detectives. They may be\r\n\r\nwithin  sight  of the inspector,  or  out  of  his\r\n\r\nsight,  but the inspector would have to  stand  up\r\n\r\nfor his men on such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Government to give to the police\r\n\r\nand to every individual\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nofficer  minute instructions as to  how  this  law\r\n\r\nshould  be  operated, in order  to  safeguard  the\r\n\r\ninnocent.  We  are  all  against  secret   society\r\n\r\nmembers. We want them to be cleaned up but, at the\r\n\r\nsame  time, we ask that the innocent be  protected\r\n\r\nand not be inconvenienced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.30 am.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\ndespite my hearty support of this amendment, yet I\r\n\r\nwish  to  stress a few points. This amending  Bill\r\n\r\nappears  to be very effective medicine to  cure  a\r\n\r\nvery dangerous disease - gangsterism; but in using a\r\n\r\nvery  effective drug to cure a dangerous  disease,\r\n\r\nwe must be very careful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown as well as the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Serangoon  touched upon abuse  of  powers  by\r\n\r\npolice  officers in applying the law which we  are\r\n\r\nnow  going  to  enact. Sir, we all respect  police\r\n\r\ninspectors,  yet as I pointed out yesterday  about\r\n\r\nthe C.I.D. organisation, should not the Government\r\n\r\nrealise  that  an inspector can easily  be  misled\r\n\r\ninto  abusing powers? I do not say that inspectors\r\n\r\nwill  abuse the powers straightaway, but that they\r\n\r\nmay  be  misled  into abusing them, especially  as\r\n\r\nmany  of our new inspectors are fresh from  school\r\n\r\nwith  only  a School Certificate and three  years'\r\n\r\ntraining. Then the whole source of his information\r\n\r\nis   the  detectives,  and  I  invited  the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary yesterday to come out with me  into  the\r\n\r\nstreet  to  see  how  many people  have  faith  in\r\n\r\ndetectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the clauses in the Bill reads, \".. the\r\n\r\ninspector  on  receipt  of  information  which  he\r\n\r\nconsiders  to be reliable..\". The inspectors  rely\r\n\r\non  the detectives' information and consider  that\r\n\r\nreliable.  However, I have had  bitter  experience\r\n\r\nabout  this  in the past, and I think every  other\r\n\r\nMember  here  must have had one  or  two  also.  I\r\n\r\nremember  a  night not long ago when there  was  a \r\n\r\nwayang play in Chai Chee Village. That night  from 10  p.m. my telephone kept ringing. Why?  Hawkers\r\n\r\nand  farmers had been arrested and confined in Joo\r\n\r\nChiat   Police  Station.  Many  of  them  I   knew\r\n\r\npersonally, especially one fishmonger who  had  to\r\n\r\nget  up at about 3 am to go to the fish market  to\r\n\r\nget fish\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto sell in Changi Market. Yet he was arrested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I contacted the police - by telephone of course - and\r\n\r\nthey said that they had received information of an\r\n\r\nexpected  gang fight at the wayang. I  dressed  up\r\n\r\nand  went to the vicinity of the wayang. And there\r\n\r\nI  saw a few notorious gangsters whom I knew  were\r\n\r\nactive  gangsters taking kwayteow, sitting  around\r\n\r\nand  drinking  beer  near the  stage,  while  poor\r\n\r\ninnocent farmers and fishermen were in the  police\r\n\r\nstation!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is the sort of thing which has taught\r\n\r\nme bitter lessons. Why should it happen? As I told\r\n\r\nthe House yesterday, it is because the head of the\r\n\r\ngangsters is well known to the detectives and they\r\n\r\nhave  a  relationship. They  can  dine  and  drink\r\n\r\ntogether in public restaurants and open bars.  Can\r\n\r\nthe  public have faith in detectives when they see\r\n\r\nthe   law  executors  drinking  and  dining   with\r\n\r\nnotorious gangsters in a kampong or a street?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, therefore I strongly put over this point to\r\n\r\nthe  Government: try to find a remedy  to  prevent\r\n\r\nthe  police from being misled into abusing  powers\r\n\r\nwhich  this House and the country entrust to them.\r\n\r\nOnly  by  so  doing  can they  hope  to  make  the\r\n\r\ndetective   organisation  more   effective,   more\r\n\r\nrespected and more trustworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides relying on detectives, uniformed\r\n\r\ninspectors  also rely much on the police.  In  the\r\n\r\npast - I  do  not know what the reason  is - everybody\r\n\r\nused  to  say, \"Oh, the Chinese, because of  their\r\n\r\ntradition, do not like the soldiers and  therefore\r\n\r\nthey do not like to be policemen\". So many of  our\r\n\r\nconstables  have been recruited from  the  Malays;\r\n\r\nworst  of  all,  they  have  been  recruited  from\r\n\r\nFederation Malays. There is therefore not only the\r\n\r\nlanguage barrier between them and the people, but\r\n\r\nalso  differences in traditions and  customs.  How\r\n\r\nthen  can  you  make  the police  become  a  good,\r\n\r\nreliable friend of the people, as I think it is  a\r\n\r\nbasic idea to have the people have faith and trust\r\n\r\nin   the   police  force?  Therefore  unless   the\r\n\r\nplainclothes   and   uniformed   police   can   be\r\n\r\ncompletely  re-organised  into  an  effective  and\r\n\r\nrespected machinery, I am sure this amending  Bill\r\n\r\nwill be only just a waste of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am putting this point now for the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  not only for the Chief Secretary:  if\r\n\r\nwe  believe  in  the  proverb that  prevention  is\r\n\r\nbetter than cure, we must think of ways how not to\r\n\r\nmake  it  necessary  to  arrest  and  prosecute  a\r\n\r\nperson.  Why  do  the police not consider  certain\r\n\r\nmeasures  before  a  thing is going  to  happen - by\r\n\r\npersuasion, by constant visits to the family of  a\r\n\r\nsuspected  criminal, by improving the relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  them and the public? We know - and I  think\r\n\r\nthe Chief Secretary knows better than anybody else\r\n\r\nhere - that  in  many countries  in  the  world  the\r\n\r\npoliceman is the best friend of the youngsters and\r\n\r\nadults  alike.  They take part  in  any  community\r\n\r\nactivity.  Why not here? Here we have a  very  bad\r\n\r\ntradition.  When  children  start  crying,   their\r\n\r\nparents   often  say,  `Stop  crying.  Mata   mata\r\n\r\ndatang!' That makes the police out to be a terror,\r\n\r\nnot  a  friend. They know all the bad hats in  the\r\n\r\narea  yet they only watch and wait and only  start\r\n\r\narresting when they begin to commit crimes. Sir, I\r\n\r\ndo not think that is a good practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Just think of a police\r\n\r\nofficer  who has been in the force for  years  and\r\n\r\nyears; on receipt of such an instruction, what can\r\n\r\nhe  do? As we all know, most of the detectives  in\r\n\r\nthe force were all ex-members of secret societies,\r\n\r\nso  that  instruction  will  force  them  to  make\r\n\r\narrests or to supply information against their own\r\n\r\nenemies in other branches of the secret societies.\r\n\r\nWhy  do I say that, Sir? Only recently, the police\r\n\r\nintroduced   \"Operation   Dagger\",   under   which\r\n\r\nthousands   and  thousands  of  people,   innocent\r\n\r\npeople, suffered. Walk along the streets and I  am\r\n\r\nquite  sure you will meet people with tattoo marks\r\n\r\nall  over  their bodies blackened. These blackened\r\n\r\ntattoo  marks  are  for ever  impressed  on  their\r\n\r\nbodies.  This  is  what  I  call  injustice.  Just\r\n\r\nbecause  you  have a tattoo mark on your  body.  I\r\n\r\nmean  a  mark  which  is related  to  one  of  the\r\n\r\ninsignias  of  a  secret society, for  example,  a\r\n\r\ntattoo  mark of a man fighting a tiger - in  Chinese\r\n\r\nthey  call it Boo Siong pah haw - according  to  the\r\n\r\nrecords of the C.I.D., the Boo Siong pah haw  mark\r\n\r\nbelongs  to Gang 18, you are a member of a  secret\r\n\r\nsociety.

Therefore many members of  the\r\n\r\nforce,  the  rank and file, are very disappointed,\r\n\r\ndiscontented and frustrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally feel that this amending Bill is not\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.45 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> It should be on\r\n\r\nthe  record, Sir, that the operative word for  the\r\n\r\nspeech  of  the  Member for Tiong  Bahru  on  this\r\n\r\namending   Bill  is  that  it  is  not  necessary.\r\n\r\nProbably some of his friends will be very  pleased\r\n\r\nto hear it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two distinct ways in which one\r\n\r\ncould approach this Bill. First, the stand of  the\r\n\r\nunsophisticated   democrats - the   rule   of   law,\r\n\r\nevidence corroborated beyond all reasonable doubt.\r\n\r\nWhen we try to bring the standards and patterns of\r\n\r\nlaw  and  order from some foreign land which  does\r\n\r\nnot  suit  the realities of our local  conditions,\r\n\r\nthen  the  result  will be chaos.  The  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem  cannot be transplanted wholesale.  Neither\r\n\r\ncan  its  rules, laws and enactments  be  repeated\r\n\r\nwithout amendment. The first question is how do we\r\n\r\neradicate the source, the economic and the  social\r\n\r\ncauses  which  the  Chief Secretary  very  lightly\r\n\r\ntouched  upon. As long as the social and  economic\r\n\r\nforces are there, there will be an endless stream\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof recruits for secret societies, not only for the\r\n\r\npurposes  of extortion, but also for the  purposes\r\n\r\nof  overthrowing  the existing order.  The  second\r\n\r\nquestion   is,   until  we  have   achieved   that\r\n\r\nobjective, what do we do about it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Japanese had a very effective way\r\n\r\nof dealing with it-they just potong  kepala; and I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think anybody doubts that it was  a  very\r\n\r\neffective  method. I do not think  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, or indeed in Malaya, ever lived through\r\n\r\na  more difficult or a more trying period than the\r\n\r\nthree-and-a-half years of the Japanese occupation,\r\n\r\nand  yet  gangsterism was nil; because there  were\r\n\r\nswaggering sergeants with long swords who  made  a\r\n\r\nhabit  of  using them. And terror was  used  as  a\r\n\r\nweapon  to  a  point where it was  not  worth  the\r\n\r\nfeeding  of  a chicken to have one's head  chopped\r\n\r\noff.  I  think many of us here still remember  the\r\n\r\ngrisly heads that were stuck up on all the bridges\r\n\r\nin  Singapore just to remind the people that there\r\n\r\nwas  such  a thing called law and order  with  the\r\n\r\nJapanese samurai sword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one way: you just knock down the other\r\n\r\nfellow, never mind about evidence and so on; never\r\n\r\nmind even if you knock out four innocent chaps  to\r\n\r\nget one guilty one. But more important is that you\r\n\r\nterrify all the rest of the guilty ones to a point\r\n\r\nwhere they think it is not worth their fun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other way I have only read about. I have not\r\n\r\nseen  it at first hand, but I am told that if  you\r\n\r\ntry to be a teddy boy in Moscow, then you will not\r\n\r\nlast  very long. There are people who want to find\r\n\r\nout  what your employment is, what you are  doing,\r\n\r\nand why you are not doing anything and yet have so\r\n\r\nmany  of  the good things in life. Very  soon  you\r\n\r\nfind  yourself in a healthy camp where you do very\r\n\r\ngood work, and get yourself re-orientated into the\r\n\r\nright way of thinking, that the purpose in life is\r\n\r\nnot  to try and cheat your way out of society, but\r\n\r\nto work hard and contribute to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, somewhere between these two extremes, we\r\n\r\nhave  to find our solution. I am not in a position\r\n\r\nto  say,  not  being  in  possession  of  detailed\r\n\r\ninformation  of the probable habits and  reactions of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese secret society gangsters, whether a Bill  of\r\n\r\nthis   nature  will  meet  our  needs.   Certainly\r\n\r\nsomething has got to be done about it. The problem\r\n\r\nis  to  find some method which can be an effective\r\n\r\ncounter,  and  can,  to  a certain  extent,  deter\r\n\r\npeople  from  embarking  on hazardous  occupations\r\n\r\nsuch  as secret society gangsterism, without being\r\n\r\nturned into a weapon of terror.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard this morning, pass unchallenged, the\r\n\r\nstatement  that  police inspectors were  ex-secret\r\n\r\nsociety members. That, I think, is going a  little\r\n\r\nbit too far. We all know, particularly those of us\r\n\r\nwho  by their profession have something to do with\r\n\r\nthe  Courts,  and  have to hear  the  evidence  of\r\n\r\ndetectives and inspectors, that it is not true  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  police inspectors have  been  ex-secret\r\n\r\nsociety members. But it is unfortunately true that\r\n\r\nthere are very often ex-secret society members  as\r\n\r\ndetectives  in  the police force.  The  inspectors\r\n\r\nquite  frankly tell us that you need  a  thief  to\r\n\r\ncatch another thief, and a monkey to catch another\r\n\r\nmonkey, because if you cannot climb a tree and the\r\n\r\nother monkey can, you are left behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being so, all we can do is no more than\r\n\r\nexhort the Government to see that a great deal  of\r\n\r\ncare  and supervision are maintained in order that\r\n\r\nthere  should not be corruption - not just financial\r\n\r\ncorruption  but general corruption  in  discipline\r\n\r\nand   morale - where  reliance  is  placed  on   the\r\n\r\nevidence of purely ex-secret society gangsters  in\r\n\r\norder to get present secret society gangsters. But\r\n\r\nother than broad statements of principle, I do not\r\n\r\nthink  anybody in this House is in a  position  to\r\n\r\nsay whether this Bill really answers the need. All\r\n\r\nwe  can say is, we hope that Ministers have  given\r\n\r\ncareful  consideration to it, and we hope that  it\r\n\r\nwill answer the need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.51 am.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, I welcome the general support\r\n\r\nthat  has been forthcoming for this Bill with  one\r\n\r\nexception.   The   hon.

I  appreciate  the\r\n\r\nbouquet  which  he is giving for  the  speed  with\r\n\r\nwhich Government can move, but I am afraid I  must\r\n\r\ntell  him  that  this Bill was in preparation  for\r\n\r\nsome time before he put his question down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose, Sir, to answer now the\r\n\r\naccusations  which have been made  as  to  certain\r\n\r\nelements  in  the  police force,  and  to  certain\r\n\r\nabuses of their powers. That is a matter which  as\r\n\r\nyou  yourself have said, Sir, has been  raised  on\r\n\r\nthe  debate on the Governor's Speech, and I  shall\r\n\r\nbe  having  something to say when that  debate  is resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the general provisions of this Bill, I\r\n\r\nam  entirely  in concurrence with the hon.  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong Pagar that what we have to do broadly\r\n\r\nis  to try and find the proper balance between the\r\n\r\nnecessary  protection of innocent persons  against\r\n\r\nabuse  of  authority and affording to the  police,\r\n\r\nwho  have  the  responsibility of  bringing  these\r\n\r\ncriminals  to  justice, the  necessary  powers  to\r\n\r\nenable them to do so. No Government, and certainly\r\n\r\nnot this Government, would wish to give the police\r\n\r\nor  anybody else more powers than are necessary to\r\n\r\ndischarge  their  functions.  Wherever  power   or\r\n\r\nauthority is vested, there is room for abuse,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  a  fact which must be recognised.  I  do\r\n\r\nassure hon. Members with regard to the application\r\n\r\nof  the  provisions  of this  Bill  that  I  shall\r\n\r\npersonally concern myself with the application  of\r\n\r\nthese  provisions  and endeavour  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthere is no abuse of the powers with which I  hope\r\n\r\nthe Assembly is now prepared to vest the police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two minor points raised, Sir, in\r\n\r\nconnection with the wording of the Bill. One  hon.\r\n\r\nMember referred to the provision in clause 3A  (1)\r\n\r\n(i)  that  \"on  receipt  of information  which  he\r\n\r\nconsiders to be reliable\" and suggested that since\r\n\r\nthat information came from a detective, it was  to\r\n\r\nbe  suspect - I  must point out  to  him  that  that\r\n\r\nprovision  refers  only  to  information  that   a\r\n\r\ndisturbance   is  likely  to  take   place;   that\r\n\r\nprovision has nothing to do with the arrest or the\r\n\r\ngrounds of arrest of any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperson. That is provided later in the clause where\r\n\r\nit  is specifically stated that the police officer\r\n\r\nnot below the rank of inspector has to have reason\r\n\r\nto   suspect  that  the  individual  concerned  is\r\n\r\nconnected with an unlawful society, and that is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  identification. And as I explained  in\r\n\r\nmoving the Second Reading, the inspector will have\r\n\r\nto produce and support the grounds on which he has\r\n\r\nmade  his  arrest  when he brings  the  individual\r\n\r\nbefore the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have nothing further to add.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

The punishment provided  at\r\n\r\npresent  in  the  Penal Code for this  offence  is\r\n\r\nunduly   lenient  in  the  present   circumstances\r\n\r\nconsisting  as it does of imprisonment  which  may\r\n\r\nextend  to one month or a maximum fine of $100  or\r\n\r\nboth  such  imprisonment and fine. I have  already\r\n\r\nindicated  to the Assembly the vicious  nature  of\r\n\r\nthe type of gang fights which are unfortunately of\r\n\r\nsuch frequent occurrence in Singapore and I do not\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  hon.  Members  will  agree  that  the\r\n\r\npresent penalties which I have detailed are not  a\r\n\r\nsufficient deterrent in the present circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt   is  accordingly  proposed  that  the  maximum\r\n\r\npunishment  for  committing an  affray  should  be\r\n\r\nincreased to imprisonment for a maximum period  of\r\n\r\none  year or to a fine which may amount to  $1,000\r\n\r\nor to both such imprisonment and fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 3 of the Bill makes a number of\r\n\r\namendments  to certain sections of the Penal  Code\r\n\r\nto  increase the sentences which may be imposed by\r\n\r\nthe   courts  for  the  crime  of  kidnapping   or\r\n\r\nabduction  to ten years and to make such  offences\r\n\r\nalso  punishable  with whipping.  Members  are  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  aware from reports in the daily press  that\r\n\r\nover a number of years there have been several\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncases  of kidnapping and also a number of attempts\r\n\r\nwhich  have been thwarted by the vigilance of  the\r\n\r\nPolice. There is also good reason to believe  that\r\n\r\nthere have been other successful kidnappings which\r\n\r\nhave  not  been reported to the Police  and  which\r\n\r\nhave  resulted  in the payment of  large  sums  of\r\n\r\nmoney   as  ransom.  Sir,  the  essence  of  every\r\n\r\nkidnapping  case  is  to put the  victim  and  his\r\n\r\nrelatives   in  fear  of  physical  violence   and\r\n\r\nfrequently involves the detention of the victim in\r\n\r\nconditions of extreme discomfort. If this form  of\r\n\r\ncrime  is  to  be  adequately discouraged,  it  is\r\n\r\nimperative  that  the punishment  for  this  crime\r\n\r\nshould  be increased to a level which will  afford\r\n\r\nthe severest deterrent to those who seek to profit\r\n\r\nfrom   it.   Although  modern  penal   reform   is\r\n\r\nantipathetic  to  the use of corporal  punishment,\r\n\r\nthese principles of reform, if they are to achieve\r\n\r\ntheir purpose, require the existence of conditions\r\n\r\nwhich it must regrettably he admitted do not exist\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  today. The thugs who take  part  in\r\n\r\nthese crimes of violence are not for the most part\r\n\r\nsusceptible  to  the sympathetic  treatment  which\r\n\r\nthese  principles  symbolise and  for  the  better\r\n\r\nprotection   of  the  public,  it  is   considered\r\n\r\nadvisable  to arm the Courts with this  additional\r\n\r\npower to be used at discretion and which will  act\r\n\r\nas  a  greater  deterrent to those who  now  think\r\n\r\nnothing  of inflicting physical violence on  their\r\n\r\ninnocent victims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.05 am.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  introduction of this Bill to amend the  Penal\r\n\r\nCode  Ordinance should be most welcome. I may  say\r\n\r\nthat  this  amendment  more  or  less  answers  my\r\n\r\nquestion  yesterday rather than the previous  one,\r\n\r\nthe   Criminal   Justice  (Temporary   Provisions)\r\n\r\nOrdinance, as this applies more to kidnapping  and\r\n\r\ngangsterism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in my opinion, I feel that the new\r\n\r\npunishment  proposed under this new  amendment  is\r\n\r\nstill inadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKidnapping  and gangsterism  are  very,\r\n\r\nvery serious offences because they cause fear  and\r\n\r\nalarm  not only to the rich and poor but  also  to\r\n\r\nevery  individual  citizen in  this  country.  The\r\n\r\ncondition in which the victim finds himself is not\r\n\r\nall  to  be considered. We must also consider  the\r\n\r\ncondition  of  the family of that victim.  When  a\r\n\r\nvictim  is  kidnapped  and confined  illegally  or\r\n\r\nwrongfully, the family is put under mental torture\r\n\r\nand suffers more if that victim is the sole bread-winner  of the family. People who steal or  commit\r\n\r\nminor  offences may receive the sympathy and mercy\r\n\r\nof the court but kidnapping and gangsterism should\r\n\r\nnot  receive the slightest sympathy at all.  These\r\n\r\nkidnappers  or  extortionists  are  just  out   to\r\n\r\nsatisfy their taste for richness in that they  can\r\n\r\ndemand  fantastic sums of money from the so-called\r\n\r\nrich people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the mental torture caused to the\r\n\r\nfamily, the victim is also subject to torture just\r\n\r\nas  in  one case where he was confined in a  small\r\n\r\nbox  some time ago. The only way to wipe out  such\r\n\r\noffences  is  to  introduce the severest  form  of\r\n\r\npunishment  so  that the courts could  impose  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  fine  allowed by law.  Although  the  new\r\n\r\nlegislation   proposes  ten  years'   imprisonment\r\n\r\nand/or whipping, I feel that that is inadequate as\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Tanjong Pagar this  morning  said\r\n\r\nthat  we  must show to those who intend to  commit\r\n\r\nthese  crimes  that  the Government  really  means\r\n\r\nbusiness - not just putting it on paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although I am not satisfied with this\r\n\r\nproposed  amendment because the new punishment  is\r\n\r\nnot  adequate, I do not intend to propose  another\r\n\r\namendment  to  provide for more severe  punishment\r\n\r\nbecause  I may be obstructing the passing of  this\r\n\r\nlaw.  I am prepared to allow this amendment to  go\r\n\r\nthrough. If after this amendment is made  law  and\r\n\r\nfurther  crimes of this nature are not stopped,  I\r\n\r\nwould urge Government to consider introducing more\r\n\r\nsevere  punishment  than ten  years'  imprisonment\r\n\r\nand/or whipping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.10 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to support this amendment but there is one\r\n\r\npoint I would like to bring up for the consideration of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment to section 160 of the Penal\r\n\r\nCode proposes to increase the term of imprisonment\r\n\r\nto  one year and a fine of $1,000. I think this is\r\n\r\nbeyond  the  power of a Magistrate Court  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith.  Therefore  if there are not  many  District\r\n\r\nCriminal Courts available to deal with such cases,\r\n\r\nthe Magistrates' Courts will not be able to impose\r\n\r\nthe  maximum  term of imprisonment and  this  Bill\r\n\r\nwill  just  be  a  scrap  of  paper.  I  want  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to give me an assurance that  we  have\r\n\r\nsufficient District Criminal Courts to  deal  with\r\n\r\nsuch cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.13 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, the Member for Queenstown (Mr\r\n\r\nLee  Choon Eng) suggested that these penalties are\r\n\r\nnot  adequate enough; that I think myself to be  a\r\n\r\nmatter   of  balance.  In  providing  for  maximum\r\n\r\npenalties, one must strike an appropriate  balance\r\n\r\nbetween  different types of crimes and, of course,\r\n\r\nit is for the courts in individual cases to decide\r\n\r\nwhat  the  appropriate penalty may be.

That  is\r\n\r\nthe  case and serious cases will have to be  taken\r\n\r\nbefore the District Courts.

It will be remembered that one of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovisions  of that Ordinance was that any  person\r\n\r\nwho  applied for registration as a citizen  before\r\n\r\n31st January, 1958 - that is the end of the initial\r\n\r\nregistration period - and was registered within  one\r\n\r\nmonth  after that date, would be deemed  to  be  a\r\n\r\ncitizen  of Singapore on 1st February,  1958, for\r\n\r\nthe   purpose  of  being  included  in  the  first\r\n\r\nregisters  prepared for the Singapore  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly elections. 1,412 persons in this category\r\n\r\nwere registered during this extended period of one\r\n\r\nmonth.  The present Bill seeks to extend this  one\r\n\r\nmonth  period  by a further month. The  reason  is\r\n\r\nthat  in  respect  of a number  of  persons  whose\r\n\r\napplications were approved by the Minister  before\r\n\r\n28th February, 1958, it was impossible to complete\r\n\r\nthe  formalities by that date and they could  only\r\n\r\nbe  registered  during March. There  were  a  very\r\n\r\nlarge  number of applications outstanding on  31st\r\n\r\nJanuary,  1958, for investigation during  February\r\n\r\nand   although  the  Advisory  Committee  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned considered these  applications\r\n\r\nwith  all  possible speed, there were a number  on\r\n\r\nwhich  it  was  only possible to  complete  action\r\n\r\nleading to approval at the very end of the  month.\r\n\r\nIt  is considered that it would only be fair  that\r\n\r\nsuch persons so registered will also be deemed  to\r\n\r\nbe  citizens  of Singapore on 1st February,  1958,\r\n\r\nfor  the  purpose of being included in  the  first\r\n\r\nregisters  prepared for the Singapore  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  elections.

M.\r\n\r\nJumabhoy). One of his slogans was, \"Support  local\r\n\r\nindustry and buy Singapore goods.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by allowing the Japanese to come here and\r\n\r\ncompete  with  our local fishermen, I  wonder  how\r\n\r\nthat slogan can mean what it is meant to mean.  Is\r\n\r\nthe  Minister not contradicting himself and  going\r\n\r\nagainst  the  policy  of  his  own  Government  to\r\n\r\nencourage  local  industry? The Governor's  Speech\r\n\r\nstated,  Sir,  that  the  Government  intends  \"to\r\n\r\nassist  local  fishermen who  are  willing  to  be\r\n\r\ntrained in new methods of fishing\". In what way or\r\n\r\nhow  can the Government train our local people  in\r\n\r\nnew  methods of fishing? In Singapore, we have  no\r\n\r\nfishing   schools.  Furthermore,   the   Fisheries\r\n\r\nDepartment do not have the personnel to train  our\r\n\r\nlocal  people in the fishing industry.  Government\r\n\r\nhas got to rely on the Japanese to train our local\r\n\r\npeople here but are the Japanese prepared to teach\r\n\r\nour  local  people when they know very  well  that\r\n\r\nwhen  our  local  people  are  fully  trained   as\r\n\r\nfishermen   it   will  affect  their   own   trade\r\n\r\nconsiderably? I am quite sure that  they  are  not\r\n\r\nprepared.  So the only way, Sir, under  the  guise\r\n\r\nthat  they  will train our local people,  is  they\r\n\r\noffer  very,  very  small salaries  to  our  local\r\n\r\npeople  who join them as recruits for training  in\r\n\r\nthe  catch of fish. Street boys from road  corners\r\n\r\nare  recruited and the salary that they now  offer\r\n\r\nis  between $80 to $100 a month. Sir,  can  a  man\r\n\r\nlive on $80 to $100 a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonth?  It  is rather difficult. Now,  Sir,  apart\r\n\r\nfrom this low salary, these street boys, as I call\r\n\r\nthem, are in fact treated as deckhands instead  of\r\n\r\nlearning  how  to catch fish. They are  given  all\r\n\r\nsorts  of  odd jobs aboard a ship to do either  in\r\n\r\nthe  way  of  carrying empty crates  or  boxes  or\r\n\r\ncrushing  ice to preserve the fish. Now,  is  this\r\n\r\nwhat  you  mean by learning how to catch  fish-the\r\n\r\ncarrying of empty crates and the crushing  of  ice\r\n\r\nor putting fish into boxes with the ice on top? Is\r\n\r\nthis what the Japanese mean by teaching us how  to\r\n\r\ncatch fish? Certainly, the Japanese do not want us\r\n\r\nto   know  how  to  catch  fish.  So,  unless  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  forces the Japanese to  give  adequate\r\n\r\nsalaries to our local boys who join their ships to\r\n\r\nlearn how to catch fish, I am quite sure that  the\r\n\r\nresponse  will be very, very poor. This  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs suits the Japanese very well because  they\r\n\r\ndo  not  want in fact the right type of people  to\r\n\r\ncome into the fishing trade. As I said, if we have\r\n\r\nthe right type of people who come into the fishing\r\n\r\ntrade, their trade will be killed by us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only suggestion I can put now, Sir, is to\r\n\r\ncompel  the  Japanese  to pay  our  boys  adequate\r\n\r\nsalaries. That is one way to encourage new methods\r\n\r\nof   catching  fish.  Another  way,  Sir,  is   to\r\n\r\nestablish fishing schools in Singapore and  engage\r\n\r\nJapanese  personnel to come to Singapore to  teach\r\n\r\nour  local boys in our schools and after a certain\r\n\r\nperiod  of  training or learning in  the  schools,\r\n\r\nthey will go out under the supervision of our  own\r\n\r\nlocal  officers to show them how to actually catch\r\n\r\nfish. Unless Government implements this sort of  a\r\n\r\nscheme,  I am afraid that it will not be  able  to\r\n\r\nintroduce any new methods of catching fish so that\r\n\r\nour boys can learn how to catch fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next subject is on education, Sir. This time I\r\n\r\nmust give credit to the Government for having  the\r\n\r\nforesight   to   build  more   schools   for   our\r\n\r\nyoungsters.   The   Government   must   also    be\r\n\r\ncongratulated  on its policy \"of seeking  to  give\r\n\r\nevery  child the chance to have primary  education\r\n\r\nup  to the age of 14.\" Education is very essential\r\n\r\nfor a country and unless\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  younger generation are given proper education\r\n\r\nwhen they are young, then however much improvement\r\n\r\nyou  may  have  in  your  country  will  serve  no\r\n\r\npurpose. But one thing is lacking in the policy of\r\n\r\nthe  Government and it is that, according  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernor's Speech, the primary schools being built\r\n\r\n\"will  be allocated for Malay, Chinese and English\r\n\r\nlanguage teaching according to the parents' choice\r\n\r\nand  available staff.\" Sir, I am not an Indian but\r\n\r\nas  multilingualism has come  to  stay,  I  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand why the Tamil language has been omitted\r\n\r\nfrom  the policy of the Government. Malay, Chinese\r\n\r\nand   English   are  given  prominence   and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will continue to give further education\r\n\r\nin  these  three languages. What about  the  Tamil\r\n\r\nlanguage?  Are we going to say that  there  should\r\n\r\nnot  be any Tamil language teaching here? What  is\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of introducing multilingualism in the\r\n\r\nAssembly, in the City Council and in the  District\r\n\r\nCouncils?  It  serves  no  purpose.  I  hope   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Education will be able  to  explain\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more bouquet I may give to the Government,\r\n\r\nand  that  is  that the University  of  Malaya  is\r\n\r\nintroducing   part-time  training   for   teaching\r\n\r\ndiplomas; but, Sir, this is not sufficient.  After\r\n\r\nthe  war Singapore has progressed considerably  in\r\n\r\nthe  construction  field.  We  can  now  see  many\r\n\r\nskyscrapers  constructed within the  city,  and  I\r\n\r\nunderstand some of them have been designed by  our\r\n\r\nlocal  boys. This is another indication  that  our\r\n\r\nlocal  lads  can undertake big jobs  if  they  are\r\n\r\ngiven  the  chance. But what I regret  to  say  is\r\n\r\nthis - that  our  local boys have to go  abroad  for\r\n\r\ntheir   architectural  training.  There   are   no\r\n\r\nfacilities  in Singapore for local  boys  to  take\r\n\r\ndegrees  in architecture and they have  to  go  to\r\n\r\nforeign countries to learn the profession. We have\r\n\r\nhere  the  University of Malaya  and  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity, and I feel that it is the Government's\r\n\r\nresponsibility   to   see  that   a   Faculty   of\r\n\r\nArchitecture should be established, either in  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Malaya or the Nanyang University, at\r\n\r\nthe earliest possible date, so that our local boys\r\n\r\nwill   have  the  opportunity  of  learning   this\r\n\r\nprofession here rather than go abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now wish to touch on the housing policy of the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Its  present  policy  is   that   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Trust will be converted into\r\n\r\na  Development and Housing Authority. That is what\r\n\r\nis stated in the Governor's Speech. But, Sir, this\r\n\r\nis  not  the  first  time we  hear  of  a  Housing\r\n\r\nAuthority. We heard that more than two years  ago.\r\n\r\nBut  I  must congratulate the Government  that  at\r\n\r\nlong  last  they  are serious  in  establishing  a\r\n\r\nHousing Authority. The people of Singapore are fed\r\n\r\nup  with the Singapore Improvement Trust with  all\r\n\r\nthe  Iron Curtain administration behind it. Nobody\r\n\r\nknows  what  is  happening. The points  system  in\r\n\r\nregard  to  applications for houses is top  secret\r\n\r\nand  known  only  to very high  officials  of  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T.  So I want to ask: is Government  going  to\r\n\r\nestablish  this Housing Authority very  soon?  How\r\n\r\nlong  more  will it take? Two years  have  already\r\n\r\ngone  by.  Maybe even after its term of office  we\r\n\r\nwill not have a Housing Authority. I hope that the\r\n\r\nGovernment will see to the establishment  of  this\r\n\r\nHousing  Authority without further delay, so  that\r\n\r\nwe can have it in reality and not on paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.35 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nafter hearing the Governor's Speech I do not think\r\n\r\nanyone will disagree with it. All that I would say\r\n\r\nis  that  it  consists of a great  deal  of  pious\r\n\r\nhopes, a rehash of what had been given in the last\r\n\r\ntwo  Sessions. We do not want just pious hopes  or\r\n\r\npromises  that the Government will carry out  this\r\n\r\nor  that. What we want to hear from the Government\r\n\r\nis,  \"These are our methods. We will work them out\r\n\r\nand produce results.\" There are such hopes as: \"We\r\n\r\nwill increase trade. We will build more houses. We\r\n\r\nwill  have  more  home-grown food.  We  will  have\r\n\r\ngreater stability. We will offer greater incentive\r\n\r\nto  capital  investment and so on.\" But  when  you\r\n\r\nlook  behind all these promises and get  to  grips\r\n\r\nwith  them, you will find that many of  them  have\r\n\r\nvery  little  substance. I  think  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and people outside Singapore  want  the\r\n\r\nGovernment here to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngive them some concrete assurance. However, I will\r\n\r\ncome to all these subjects later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday we had a few speakers on the Governor's\r\n\r\nSpeech. One Member said that it sounded hollow and\r\n\r\nhe  had  nothing more to add to the hollowness  of\r\n\r\nthe  speech  or the promises, but he  turned  this\r\n\r\nAssembly   into  a  sounding  board  for  election\r\n\r\npurposes.  The  question  was  asked:   Will   the\r\n\r\nGovernment hold early elections? Is the Government\r\n\r\nserious  about holding early elections?  To  these\r\n\r\nquestions  the Member arrived at the answer  \"No\".\r\n\r\nBut  what  I  think is more important is  not  the\r\n\r\nquestion of early elections or late elections, but\r\n\r\nthe  question of getting the machinery  ready  and\r\n\r\nmaking   sure  that  Singapore  will  retain   its\r\n\r\ndemocratic form of government. That, Sir,  is  the\r\n\r\nmost important thing to Singapore. If a Member  is\r\n\r\ndissatisfied  that elections are  delayed  and  he\r\n\r\nwants  early elections, I think the remedy  is  in\r\n\r\nhis  hands.  He has just to file a motion  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly asking that elections be held early,  and\r\n\r\nI  defy any Member in this Assembly - and we have 32\r\n\r\nMembers  in  this House - to say no to that  motion.\r\n\r\nEveryone  will say yes, and there you  are - so  any\r\n\r\nMember  who  wants  early  elections  can  file  a\r\n\r\nmotion. There is no need to ask the Government  to\r\n\r\nhold early elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> You pledge to say yes to the\r\n\r\nmotion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> We are more concerned with\r\n\r\nwhat  form of government we will get later on.  At\r\n\r\npresent  the  Government intends  to  go  back  to\r\n\r\nLondon  to  hold  another talk with  the  Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice. In fact, during the past weeks I have been\r\n\r\npestered by the Press who asked me, \"What  do  you\r\n\r\nknow  of  the  mission? You were one of  the  five\r\n\r\nmembers.\" I had to tell them, \"No, I know  nothing\r\n\r\nabout it. I have not received any indication  from\r\n\r\nthe  Government.

In  fact, whichever direction  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ngoes, I think it is the wrong way, and we will  go\r\n\r\ndirectly  opposite to that! We  have  the  classic\r\n\r\nexample  of big brothers and small brothers  being\r\n\r\nenacted  in  Singapore. We had  the  City  Council\r\n\r\nelection  in  December and we  have  the  type  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy  which  is  said to  be:  \"Here  is  the\r\n\r\npeople's government. Come and have a look at  it.\"\r\n\r\nI  can  only say, \"God help us if we are going  to\r\n\r\nhave  the same thing repeated in the Assembly.  If\r\n\r\nwe  are  going to have in the Assembly  cat-calls,\r\n\r\nbooings   and  all  the  disturbances  that   have\r\n\r\noccurred  in the City Council, then I  think  that\r\n\r\nthe  people's  government  will  be,  dictated  by\r\n\r\nintimidation - intimidation  by  another   type   of\r\n\r\nsecret society. Say the wrong things and when  you\r\n\r\nwalk  out of the Assembly you will be expected  to\r\n\r\nbe beaten up. Be careful you should be escorted by\r\n\r\none  of  their members to the taxi, otherwise  you\r\n\r\nget  the  worse  of it. That is not  democracy.  I\r\n\r\nthink  that  is a very poor form of government.  I\r\n\r\nthink even Communist countries have not that  form\r\n\r\nof   government.  At  least  they  can  deliberate\r\n\r\nwhatever action they need take in quiet and peace.\r\n\r\nWith  that lead given in the City Council and  the\r\n\r\nfailures  that  have  occurred  there  one   after\r\n\r\nanother,  the small boy cried on the shoulders  of\r\n\r\nthe big brother and the big brother takes it up in\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly!

The  people want sane  people  to  govern\r\n\r\nthem.  The  people of Singapore want a  government\r\n\r\nconsisting of sane people and not any Tom, Dick or\r\n\r\nHarry  picked  up  on  the  road  to  voice  their\r\n\r\nopinions. They do not want people who clench their\r\n\r\nfists,  shout slogans and then carry out a  policy\r\n\r\nthat is only right if they propose it! In the past\r\n\r\nwe have had experience of that sort of government.\r\n\r\nYou   must   have  trade  unions  for   collective\r\n\r\nbargaining.  We must not suppress the workers,  or\r\n\r\nworking class, or anything you like to call  them.\r\n\r\nThey  must  be  given a chance to negotiate.  They\r\n\r\nmust  be  given  the  right to strike  for  better\r\n\r\nconditions.  But  let  me  tell  the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore, Sir, if we are going to have  the  form\r\n\r\nof  government that is at present exhibited in the\r\n\r\nCity Council, we have heard that swift retribution\r\n\r\nwill  come  if  you  do not toe the  P.A.P. line:\r\n\r\n\"Carry  out  our orders! Be our henchmen,  or  you\r\n\r\nwill  get it in the neck!\" That is not the  way  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic government is run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Sir, we have also had a line or two\r\n\r\nfrom  the  former Chief Minister, and I think  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is  also  wise to follow  that  policy  of\r\n\r\ncalling  for All-Party committees to negotiate  on\r\n\r\nmatters  on which they have failed. Here  we  have\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. leader saying that there is  an  All-Party  Committee  in the City Council  negotiating\r\n\r\nwith the union to avert a strike. They say that if\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. should  offer 20 cents,  then  nobody\r\n\r\nshould offer more. You must all offer less! If you\r\n\r\noffer  less, then you are against the workers!  If\r\n\r\nyou offer more, then you are wrong, you are trying\r\n\r\nto  out-P.A.P. the P.A.P., which is  again  wrong.\r\n\r\nWhat  is right? I am sure that what they want  the\r\n\r\npeople  to  do will be, \"Follow us. We are  always\r\n\r\nright.\"  That  is  not  the  democratic   way   of\r\n\r\nthinking.  Anybody may be right. Let us  take  the\r\n\r\nbest  idea. If the strike takes place, the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleader   pointed   to  the  Minister   for   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment and said, \"The trouble will be in  your\r\n\r\nhands. Follow us again.\" I think that is the wrong\r\n\r\nidea.  We  must  always try and strike  a  balance\r\n\r\nbetween  the demands of the workers and  what  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore can take. I do not think the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P.is always right. If the P.A.P. thinks it  is\r\n\r\nalways   right,  then  do  not  appoint  All-Party\r\n\r\ncommittees - go  it alone. Appoint a  committee  and\r\n\r\nyou  will find that they will again use  it  as  a\r\n\r\nsoiled rag. Anything is wrong, and all the dirt is\r\n\r\nput  on  it.  Anything is right, and that  is  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s work! That is not at all a fair deal.

There  is  the\r\n\r\nRight-wing  group  and there is the  extreme  Left\r\n\r\ngroup.  I  rather agree with the hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nChangi that our friend the hon. Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar belongs to the Right wing of the P.A.P. and\r\n\r\nhe  is trying to exert control over them; but  his\r\n\r\nsilence from December to March did not give  us  a\r\n\r\nvery  good picture. Neither did his Party's annual\r\n\r\nelection,  which got him into a fix - as to  whether\r\n\r\nto  go ahead with the extreme Left or to come  out\r\n\r\non his own - give us a very good picture of a leader\r\n\r\ntrying  to run the Party. It seems to me that  the\r\n\r\nParty  is  running the leader and that the  leader\r\n\r\nwill  take a cue from those who boo from the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil galleries. Otherwise I am sure that sooner\r\n\r\nor  later he will be in an unenviable position  of\r\n\r\nbeing left high and dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think for the stability of Singapore the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  should  be persuaded to see further  ahead\r\n\r\nand  consider  the  interests  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore rather than have two legs, one  on  each\r\n\r\nboat.  If  the  two boats should run  in  opposite\r\n\r\ndirections, he will be right inside the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the Government's policy on trade, I find\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  is getting into a very  difficult\r\n\r\nposition.  The  Government stated  that  Singapore\r\n\r\nexists  because  of  its  trade.  Right  from  the\r\n\r\nbeginning  of  Singapore  until  today,  everybody\r\n\r\nknows  that Singapore exists because of its trade.\r\n\r\nSingapore must have its entrepot trade but today I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nam afraid that despite all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  efforts  to  try  and  bring  a\r\n\r\ngreater volume of trade to Singapore, that  volume\r\n\r\nis  not  increasing. I have heard very  disturbing\r\n\r\nreports that the centre of entrepot trade  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing to remain in Singapore for a very long time.\r\n\r\nAt least we will have a lot of rivals. I know that\r\n\r\nplans  are now being put forward by large shipping\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  business interests  to  shift  the\r\n\r\ncentre   of   the  entrepot  trade  to   Hongkong.\r\n\r\nPreviously  we  have all the  trade  and  all  the\r\n\r\ntranshipment  by small steamers from Singapore  to\r\n\r\nNorth   Borneo,  Brunei,  Sarawak  and  the  other\r\n\r\nislands.  Today we have transhipment from Hongkong\r\n\r\nto these other places, and I know that notices and\r\n\r\ncirculars  have been sent round to the dealers  in\r\n\r\nall  these islands asking them whether they  would\r\n\r\nagree   to   transhipment  being   effected   from\r\n\r\nHongkong.  That is very serious, Sir, and  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing to lose a great deal of that entrepot trade,\r\n\r\nif  it  comes  to  that.  Again,  Sir,  previously\r\n\r\nBangkok  has  sent its produce to  Singapore  and,\r\n\r\nthereafter,  Singapore, as a distributing  centre,\r\n\r\nhas sent the goods forward to Sumatra, Java or the\r\n\r\nother islands. Today we have direct shipping  from\r\n\r\nBangkok  to  all  the other places.  This  serious\r\n\r\nproblem,  Sir,  is  not  without  cause.  Business\r\n\r\npeople  will only look towards what they  can  get\r\n\r\nout  of  trade.  Singapore has  been  used  as  an\r\n\r\nentrepot centre from time immemorial because it is\r\n\r\ncentrally   situated.  It  is  a  most  convenient\r\n\r\ncentre.  It  is  logical to have  Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\ndistributing  point,  with  all  the  harbour  and\r\n\r\ntransport facilities. I ask, Sir: Do we still have\r\n\r\nthese harbour and transport facilities? The answer\r\n\r\nis yes, we still have these facilities here. Then,\r\n\r\nSir,  why are people shifting their entrepot trade\r\n\r\nto  other  ports? I say the cause  lies  with  the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> You must be getting nightmares!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> The Singapore Harbour Board\r\n\r\nhas  its many troubles.

The  workers  must have  higher  pay  and\r\n\r\nholidays.  If  they cannot get a  pass  for  their\r\n\r\nunion secretary into the Harbour Board, they  must\r\n\r\ngo  slow or go on strike. All this means delay  in\r\n\r\nhandling  goods, higher storage costs  and  higher\r\n\r\nhandling costs. Soon we find that business  people\r\n\r\nare  not quite ready to take all that. We are  not\r\n\r\ndealing with people inside the colony that we  can\r\n\r\ncontrol. We are dealing with people in independent\r\n\r\ncountries. Whether to use Singapore or  any  other\r\n\r\nport  is within their right. They have the choice.\r\n\r\nIf they choose Singapore, they will use Singapore.\r\n\r\nIf  they  choose Hongkong, they will use Hongkong.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  the things happening here,  they  are\r\n\r\nslowly  trying  to find whether  they  can  choose\r\n\r\nanother  substitute port instead of Singapore.  To\r\n\r\nthe  workers  what benefit have we given  them  by\r\n\r\nsuch  actions? Today the volume of trade  will  go\r\n\r\ndown. Tomorrow it will be less.

We\r\n\r\nknow that we have to create certain facilities for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  If we cannot cheapen labour,  then  we\r\n\r\nmust use mechanised equipment in order to get over\r\n\r\nthis.  Furthermore,  Singapore  must  provide  all\r\n\r\nfacilities  which  are required for  its  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade.  We must have a good system of shipping  to\r\n\r\nother   places.  We  must  encourage   our   local\r\n\r\nshipping. If we can have local shipping brought to\r\n\r\na  high  degree of efficiency, then  we  have  the\r\n\r\nfacilities  for the people of other  countries  to\r\n\r\ncome  to Singapore. Our local ships may be few  in\r\n\r\nnumber, but we have to make a start somewhere.  We\r\n\r\nare not starting badly. We have quite a number  of\r\n\r\nlocal  ships. Let the Government assist our  local\r\n\r\nshipping so that its fate will be in our hands and\r\n\r\nnot  in  the  hands of other people who  establish\r\n\r\ntheir  business here. Help our local  shipping  to\r\n\r\nhave more cargoes to send out. Keep them alive. If\r\n\r\nwe  do  that, we will build them up. If we have  a\r\n\r\nfew ships today, we will have more ships later on.\r\n\r\nIt  will  not only help these shipping lines,  but\r\n\r\nincidentally it will also provide employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always urged the Minister for Commerce and\r\n\r\nIndustry to think of establishing a merchant navy.\r\n\r\nThat  is what Singapore wants. If we can establish\r\n\r\nit,  it  will  go a long way to keep the  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  going.  If we cannot establish  a  merchant\r\n\r\nnavy, then at least find ways and means of keeping\r\n\r\nour  local shipping alive. After all, if the ships\r\n\r\nare  registered here, all that they earn will come\r\n\r\nback  to  Singapore. We will be  grateful  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Commerce  and  Industry  will  take\r\n\r\nconcrete steps to help our own local people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in the matter of trade, we must have\r\n\r\nmany  parties.  We simply cannot depend  on  other\r\n\r\npeople choosing to make use of Singapore. We  must\r\n\r\nat  least  adopt some of the tactics of  insurance\r\n\r\nagents.  Many of them come along very persistently\r\n\r\nselling their policies to customers. Some  of  the\r\n\r\ncustomers want to buy and some do not, but in many\r\n\r\ncases  when  you  have  a very  skilful  insurance\r\n\r\nagent, he invariably persuades\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis  \"victims\" to buy policies. Let us adopt  that\r\n\r\ntactic. Establish trade missions in all the places\r\n\r\nwhere we can trade with, where we think we will be\r\n\r\nable to get goods from them or send goods to them.\r\n\r\nIf  we do not have the money to establish missions\r\n\r\nthere,  we  can follow the example of the  Israeli\r\n\r\nGovernment  appointing somebody here to  be  their\r\n\r\nhonorary consul. We can at least approach somebody\r\n\r\nand  ask  him,  \"Will you act  for  us  there  and\r\n\r\npromote our trade?\" If we set up missions  in  the\r\n\r\ncountries  we  trade with, we  can  publicise  the\r\n\r\nfacilities we have here and it means a great  deal\r\n\r\nwhen   we   have   publicity.  For   example,   in\r\n\r\npublicising our facilities, we can also  publicise\r\n\r\ntourism.  If suggestions like this are adopted,  I\r\n\r\nam sure they will go a long way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have heard from the Government that they\r\n\r\nare going to promote industries and that they will\r\n\r\nestablish an Industrial Promotion Board. They  say\r\n\r\nthey  will  assist the industries, especially  the\r\n\r\nsmall  ones  with no capital, but I find  that  in\r\n\r\npractice  they have not done much. They  have  not\r\n\r\neven  touched  on the fringes. If  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nPromotion Board is going to do good work, then  it\r\n\r\nmust  not  act  like  a  bank - \"Show  us  all  your\r\n\r\nsecurities; show us that you have money,  so  that\r\n\r\nwe  may lend you money.\" It is bound to fail. That\r\n\r\nis  the  work of banks. But for industrial boards,\r\n\r\nGovernment should know whether a certain  type  of\r\n\r\nindustry is going to prosper and whether  it  will\r\n\r\nhelp  the  people of Singapore. If  Government  is\r\n\r\nconvinced that it will assist them, the best thing\r\n\r\nfor  Government  to do is to initiate  a  move  to\r\n\r\nstart  such  an  industry. If,  however,  such  an\r\n\r\nindustry  is  already in existence and  Government\r\n\r\nknows  that it will not make a loss but instead  a\r\n\r\nprofit,  then  Government should help  it  in  the\r\n\r\nproper manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said in this Assembly sometime ago that\r\n\r\ncertain  industries have been affected,  like  the\r\n\r\nshoe factories, the beehoon factories, the biscuit\r\n\r\nfactories   and  others.  They  need  help.   Have\r\n\r\nGovernment helped them? The Minister for  Commerce\r\n\r\nand Industry has promised to help them. Have these\r\n\r\nindustries received\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch help? I shall be glad if I can have an\r\n\r\nanswer  to  that,  and I shall  be  glad  also  if\r\n\r\nGovernment will confirm that they have not  helped\r\n\r\nthem. Why have they not helped them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Sembawang today, Sir, you have a station\r\n\r\ncalled the Sembawang Experimental Station to  help\r\n\r\nfarmers  rear their poultry, to help pig  breeders\r\n\r\nand  vegetable farmers. But I think  it  would  be\r\n\r\nbetter to put all these experiments into practice.\r\n\r\nToday we still have a lot of vacant land that  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  used  for short periods of time  or  long\r\n\r\nperiods  of time. We will say that there might  be\r\n\r\npieces of vacant land which have been lying vacant\r\n\r\nfor  15  years, but nothing is going  to  be  done\r\n\r\nabout them, because Government is having a plan to\r\n\r\nbuild  a hospital or houses on them! But I believe\r\n\r\nthat  whenever  Government  have  plans  to  build\r\n\r\nhouses  or anything on vacant land, they will  not\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  do it immediately, but a  long  time\r\n\r\nafter. If in the intervening period we could allow\r\n\r\nthat piece of vacant land to be made use of by the\r\n\r\nfarmers living around there, at least it will be a\r\n\r\npractical   way  of  increasing  food  production,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  Government  just  saying,  \"We   will\r\n\r\nincrease  food production.\" In places where  plots\r\n\r\nof  vacant  land are available - and  I  know  there\r\n\r\nare - the  farmers should be given fixed  tenure  of\r\n\r\noccupation  of  the land. The Government  have  of\r\n\r\ncourse  built  experimental roads  for  all  these\r\n\r\nfarmlands, but I think more of such roads could be\r\n\r\nbuilt in order to help the farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Budget sittings I said that one\r\n\r\ndirection  in  which  the  Government  could  help\r\n\r\nSingapore in food production would be fisheries. I\r\n\r\nwas  disappointed  that the  Government  have  not\r\n\r\nlicensed more deep-sea fishing companies to go and\r\n\r\noperate in deep-sea fishing to catch more fish. In\r\n\r\nfact,  many applications for licences for deep-sea\r\n\r\nfishing  were  turned  down.  I  think  once   the\r\n\r\nenthusiasm of the applicants is gone, it  will  be\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  ask them to come back  and  operate\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest to Government that it we cannot\r\n\r\nget  our  local  capital  interested  in  such   a\r\n\r\nproject, then we invite foreign capital. More fish\r\n\r\nwill be landed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhere; at least our boys can be trained in deep-sea\r\n\r\nfishing. At least we will have a percentage of the\r\n\r\nearnings.  All  in  all,  Sir,  Government  should\r\n\r\ncandidly tell the people, \"We will help trade  and\r\n\r\nindustry.\" We may not have original ideas  but  we\r\n\r\ncan  follow  our neighbours. We can declare,  like\r\n\r\nthe  Federation or Sarawak, tax holidays  for  new\r\n\r\nprojects. We can allow a percentage of the  profit\r\n\r\nto  be remitted back to the land where the capital\r\n\r\ncomes from. We should also be prepared to take  on\r\n\r\nour hands a survey of our needs so that we may  be\r\n\r\nable to advise people who are interested to invest\r\n\r\nmoney here. It is no use telling the people, \"Come\r\n\r\nand  put your money into Singapore.\" What  to  put\r\n\r\nin?  What do we need? And I think our needs cannot\r\n\r\nbe  ascertained until we have had that survey  and\r\n\r\nuntil  we have a permanent office to advise people\r\n\r\nwho  are interested. There are, I can assure  you,\r\n\r\nplenty  of people who have money but just  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  what  best to be done with it and  where  to\r\n\r\nseek advice. If you publicise that section of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry which can give advice, at least that will\r\n\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way would be to insert in the Press a\r\n\r\nnote informing people that if they are prepared to\r\n\r\ncome  here and start new industries, we  have  the\r\n\r\nland available, as shown in Map A, or B or C,  for\r\n\r\nwhichever purpose. That will save these  people  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  trouble in having to find land  to  build\r\n\r\ntheir factories; but one factor may not be in  the\r\n\r\nhands of the Government, because they always  deny\r\n\r\nresponsibility for that, and that is  the  passing\r\n\r\nof  plans  for factories and houses.  That  matter\r\n\r\ncomes  within  the jurisdiction of the  department\r\n\r\nwhich  everybody complains about, and that is  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I think  it\r\n\r\nhas  been  most  obstructive with  regard  to  the\r\n\r\nbuilding of factories and houses. I have never yet\r\n\r\nheard  of anybody in Singapore saying a good  word\r\n\r\nabout  the S.I.T. Whenever any plan gets into  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T.,  you can count the months before it  comes\r\n\r\nout again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Member</b>: Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> In fact, in many cases, the\r\n\r\nplans get into the S.I.T. and come out again  with\r\n\r\na  request about some slight alterations and  then\r\n\r\nthey  get in again for another period of time  and\r\n\r\nout  again. In this manner, it has caused a  great\r\n\r\ndeal  of  delay.  I  know  of  one  factory  which\r\n\r\nsubmitted  a  plan  for  a  factory  and  workers'\r\n\r\nquarters and the S.I.T. asked them to draw a  line\r\n\r\nas  a  demarcation  between the  factory  and  the\r\n\r\nquarters for a playground for the children. It has\r\n\r\ngone  inside there for months just for the drawing\r\n\r\nof a line - an imaginary line for the demarcation\r\n\r\nof  a playground-and it has not yet come out. This\r\n\r\nis what I call an unnecessary delay which is aimed\r\n\r\nat  discouraging these people from pushing on with\r\n\r\ntheir job and acting contrary to what the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Commerce  and Industry (Mr J.  M.  Jumabhoy)\r\n\r\nsaid  about  encouraging  local  industries.  More\r\n\r\nserious than that, Sir, is that Singapore needs  a\r\n\r\nlot of houses and we not only need the building of\r\n\r\nhouses  for the people by Government but  also  by\r\n\r\nprivate  enterprise.  Yet we  find  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust insisting on  its  own  way  of\r\n\r\nhaving  the  houses built. We know that  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  got  very little land. We want to  build  the\r\n\r\nhouses cheap so as to bring them within the  reach\r\n\r\nof  those  who can afford to buy them and  yet  in\r\n\r\nBulim Estate, the S.I.T. says, \"You may build only\r\n\r\none  house on one acre of land. For every acre  of\r\n\r\nland,  you  can  build only one house  and  not  a\r\n\r\nhousing estate.\" That scheme\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  abandoned  by the builder. What  nonsense  is\r\n\r\nthis,  Sir,  obstructing the people to build  more\r\n\r\nhouses  when the S.I.T. itself cannot  build  more\r\n\r\nfor  the  people of Singapore! I know  of  another\r\n\r\ninstance  in  Ponggol.  A person  wants  to  build\r\n\r\nhouses  for  a few thousand dollars  and  yet  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. says, \"You must have double the  land  for\r\n\r\neach house or else your plans will not be passed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd  that means a great deal more money for  those\r\n\r\nfew  who want to buy them. Again, that scheme  was\r\n\r\nshelved.  In  such  instances, Sir,  I  think  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. is not acting in accordance with the policy\r\n\r\nlaid   down  by  the  Government.  It  is   acting\r\n\r\ncontrariwise. It is not assisting in  the  housing\r\n\r\nprogramme. Yet when questions of this sort are put\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister for Housing, (Inche Abdul Hamid)\r\n\r\nthe  reply  is  that  the S.I.T. is  out  of  his\r\n\r\ncontrol.  If  the S.I.T. is going to act  in  this\r\n\r\nmanner,  then  I  think it is high  time  that  it\r\n\r\nshould  be  re-organised  with  saner  people  put\r\n\r\nthere. In fact, I think in the S.I.T., the passing\r\n\r\nof  plans, etc, is all in the hands of one  single\r\n\r\nperson.  He has the say as to what Singapore  must\r\n\r\ndo  and what Singapore must not do. All the  plans\r\n\r\nare  in  the  hands of one man. One man  can  say,\r\n\r\n\"Yes\" to the whole plan; one man can say, \"No\"  to\r\n\r\nthe  whole  plan.  That does not  make  sense!  At\r\n\r\nleast, Sir, if it were a Board which has come to a\r\n\r\nconclusion after some consideration, it  might  be\r\n\r\nsaid  that they had thought about it but  to  have\r\n\r\none  man  controlling the destiny of Singapore  in\r\n\r\nthe  matter  of housing, I think it  is  really  a\r\n\r\nshame  that we should be prevented from  providing\r\n\r\nmore houses or encouraging more people to come and\r\n\r\nestablish factories in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I turn on to some more pleasant aspects\r\n\r\nof  Government work. I must say that the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education has done a good job. It has  started\r\n\r\nnight  classes for those overage people who cannot\r\n\r\nattend  day classes. It has opened up new  avenues\r\n\r\nfor those who cannot ordinarily study right up  to\r\n\r\nSenior Cambridge or Chinese Middle III to study in\r\n\r\nthe  evening  to  bring their education  up  to  a\r\n\r\ngeneral standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is good. It has given the parents a choice of\r\n\r\nschools in which their children can go to. I think\r\n\r\nthat  is  a  sane step. But it must do more.  This\r\n\r\nmorning  we  passed amendments to the Penal  Code,\r\n\r\nall  aimed at getting at the gangsters. There will\r\n\r\nbe  no gangsters or they will die out if they  get\r\n\r\nno recruits and the recruits that they are getting\r\n\r\nnow are those people who cannot attend schools and\r\n\r\nwho  have nothing to do. I suggest, Sir, that this\r\n\r\nserious  problem should be tackled not  only  from\r\n\r\nthe  point  of view of strengthening our  laws  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  the  criminals but also with  positive\r\n\r\naction by the Government to help them. In column 8\r\n\r\nof the Governor's Speech, you will read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"To provide for the leisure of Singapore's\r\n\r\nyouthful  population, a large expansion  in  youth\r\n\r\nclubs  and  youth  organisation is  in  hand,  and\r\n\r\ntraining courses are being given in Chinese, Malay\r\n\r\nand English.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Of  course,  this paragraph does not give  further\r\n\r\ndetails. I would say that this is the type of work\r\n\r\nthat  is done by the voluntary organisation called\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Boys' Clubs. This is the work of\r\n\r\nthat  voluntary  organisation in conjunction  with\r\n\r\nthe  Government  and I say that this  organisation\r\n\r\ncan  do  more  and will do more if the  Government\r\n\r\nwill co-operate with them. I believe that not only\r\n\r\nmust  we allow the young people places like  clubs\r\n\r\nand organisations to train them in games and other\r\n\r\nthings  but  we can also start vocational  courses\r\n\r\nwhereby  a boy can be taught a trade. I  think  if\r\n\r\nthese boys can be taught a trade, then instead  of\r\n\r\nfrequenting undesirable places, they will be  able\r\n\r\nto  learn something. A boy who cannot go to school\r\n\r\nany  further and who has no aptitude to learn will\r\n\r\nbe able to learn something that will help him make\r\n\r\na living. I have suggested this scheme tentatively\r\n\r\nto  the  Ministry and if they feel  that  this  is\r\n\r\nuseful  enough  to be pursued, I  am  prepared  to\r\n\r\npursue  it further and assist the young people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  help  themselves.  That   will,   I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  Sir, lessen the burden on Government  in\r\n\r\nhaving   to  have  more  police  to  get  rid   of gangsters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the matter of the other Ministries, Sir, I\r\n\r\njust  want  to touch upon the Ministry of  Health.\r\n\r\nGovernment may have tried its best but I find that\r\n\r\nout-door  dispensaries and clinics are  still  not\r\n\r\nsufficient.  A  large number of  people  going  to\r\n\r\nthese  clinics  have to wait for a long  time  and\r\n\r\nmany are forced to go to private practitioners not\r\n\r\nbecause  they  have the money but because  of  the\r\n\r\ninconvenience they experience when  they  ask  for\r\n\r\ntreatment.  If Government will also see  to  this,\r\n\r\nthen  I  think it will assist the people who  need\r\n\r\nsuch attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, Sir, I believe that the policy as\r\n\r\noutlined  in  the  Governor's  Speech  should   be\r\n\r\nsupported  by  Government  with  actions  and   if\r\n\r\nactions  are forthcoming, we expect to see greater\r\n\r\nprogress  and  satisfaction from the  public  this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   I   am  amazed  at  the  omission  in   His\r\n\r\nExcellency's Speech of any reference to  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil.  Sir, it has now occurred to  Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly that the City Council has become the\r\n\r\ncentre  of the Government. The City Council  today\r\n\r\nis   what  this  Assembly  was  in  1955.  It   is\r\n\r\nunfortunate  that  nothing was  mentioned  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernor's  Speech  as to whether  the  Government\r\n\r\napproves or disapproves the activities of the City\r\n\r\nCouncil.  In  spite  of  the  Minister  for  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul  Hamid\r\n\r\nbin  Haji Jumat), the City Council, in my opinion,\r\n\r\nis  doing  a magnificent job. When I say the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  is the centre of the Government,  I  mean\r\n\r\nthat the City Councillors do not plan to go to the\r\n\r\nUnited   Kingdom  on  pleasure  trips  on  various\r\n\r\npretexts of Government business or plan to  settle\r\n\r\ndown  in  various countries immediately they  lose\r\n\r\nthe next elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I want to bring forward is that\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the  Chief  Minister  referred  to  the\r\n\r\n\"Marshall\" law. He said that had it not  been  for\r\n\r\nthe  \"Marshall\" law, the subversive elements would\r\n\r\nhave  been  all over Singapore. It is a matter  of\r\n\r\nregret  to  me  that the Member for Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\n(Mr Lee Kuan Yew) did\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  thank  Mr  Marshall for the \"Marshall\"  law.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  this \"Marshall\" law, the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar was able to get rid of some  of  the\r\n\r\ntrue,  democratic  and national  elements  of  his\r\n\r\nParty in the name of subversion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For two years, sir, we sat here listening to the\r\n\r\nspeeches  of the Member for Tanjong Pagar  of  the\r\n\r\nhonesty  of the Party leadership, the same  leader\r\n\r\nwho  sat  back  and  saw  his  closest  colleagues\r\n\r\nimprisoned  and  did not take  any  action  except\r\n\r\nlament,  and  after seeing that, he  followed  the\r\n\r\nexecutioners  to London and, signed the  so-called\r\n\r\ntiga suku merdeka.

The Labour Front Government despite  all\r\n\r\nits  faults has done not too badly under difficult\r\n\r\ncircumstances. The Member for Tanjong Pagar whom I\r\n\r\nrespect,  Sir, has lately been very  boastful.

I  hope\r\n\r\nthat the people of Singapore will now wake up  and\r\n\r\nrealise that their common enemy as was supposed to\r\n\r\nbe  in the past is not the Liberal-Socialist Party\r\n\r\nbut  the P.A.P. As the merits and demerits of  the\r\n\r\nGovernor's  Speech have already been expressed  by\r\n\r\nother  Members of this Assembly, I will not  touch\r\n\r\non it any more but I feel very strongly, Sir, that\r\n\r\nwe  must not criticise the Government just for the\r\n\r\nsake  of  criticism.

The paragraph is in\r\n\r\ncolumn 7 which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The drive to produce more home grown food will\r\n\r\nreceive further impetus when the Sembawang Station\r\n\r\nstarts  operating and as the results  of  research\r\n\r\nnow  being  carried  out  are  made  available  to\r\n\r\nfarmers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  I think just telling the farmer how best  to\r\n\r\ngrow  vegetables  is  not  good  enough.

It\r\n\r\nappears to me that none of these speeches have any\r\n\r\nsubstantial criticism to offer the Government  and\r\n\r\nin  fact  most  of  them support the  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy, though with some advice or other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Government having realised that\r\n\r\nSingapore exists because of its trade has  already\r\n\r\nhit  the nail on the head and I think they are  on\r\n\r\nthe  right path. The possibility of trade  depends\r\n\r\non  the  confidence and stability of the  currency\r\n\r\nand   the   Government's  assurance  on  this   is\r\n\r\nparticularly  welcome. If trade  is  possible,  it\r\n\r\nwill enable us to have the revenue to finance  all\r\n\r\nour planned measures - social, welfare, educational,\r\n\r\nhealth, housing and all other measures - designed to\r\n\r\nuplift  or  to  maintain  the  well-being  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.  Furthermore, it affords a living  to  the\r\n\r\ncapitalists,  businessmen, clerks,  labourers  and\r\n\r\nprofessional men. Therefore, it could be seen that\r\n\r\nthe importance of trade to Singapore is paramount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government intends to encourage trade and\r\n\r\nindustry  and everybody knows that this is  right.\r\n\r\nThe  success  or  failure  of  these  measures  of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nencouragement is however dependent, to my mind, on\r\n\r\nthe mechanics of how this encouragement is to take\r\n\r\nplace.  Government  is  aware  of  the  increasing\r\n\r\npopulation  and  it  is very  eager  to  encourage\r\n\r\nindustries   to   supplement   our   all-important\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade. It has established an  Industrial\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board  and it is now proposed  \"to  re-organise and strengthen the industrial section  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Commerce and Industry  and  the\r\n\r\npossibility   of  the  present  Industrial   Board\r\n\r\nactively assisting in the promotion of large scale\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustries\".  We  know, Sir, that  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board was initially put up  to  promote\r\n\r\nsmall  industries. No doubt, the  intention  there\r\n\r\nwas  good.  However, what the Industrial Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard is really doing and how successful it is  in\r\n\r\nthis  field is very little known. Any  one  of  us\r\n\r\nwith  experience will know that the setting up  of\r\n\r\nindustries   is   only   possible   through    the\r\n\r\ndetermination and readiness for hard work and  can\r\n\r\nonly  be  maintained by continued hard work.  Only\r\n\r\nthen, can they be able to maintain their existence\r\n\r\nfrom day to day and from hand to mouth. There  are\r\n\r\nmany  industries  which we  know  are  practically\r\n\r\nimpossible  to introduce in Singapore  because  of\r\n\r\nacute  competition from outside both in efficiency\r\n\r\nand  in labour costs which are disadvantageous  to\r\n\r\nus.  Therefore,  there  is  a  danger  that  these\r\n\r\nGovernment  Boards having been set up  would  find\r\n\r\nthemselves in fact being unable to do anything and\r\n\r\nbecause  they try to justify themselves  of  their\r\n\r\nexistence  would be spoon-feeding  some  of  these\r\n\r\nindustries   without  properly  ascertaining   the\r\n\r\nnecessary efficiency and willingness for hard work\r\n\r\nof  the  owners. I have some experience  of  this,\r\n\r\nSir,  and  I  can  quote one  Rubber  Packing  and\r\n\r\nShipping Board which is still existing and  which,\r\n\r\nin  many  people's opinion, is quite  unjustified.\r\n\r\nTherefore, these Boards, if unnecessarily put  up,\r\n\r\nare  a  burden  to  the taxpayer  because  of  the\r\n\r\nadditional  administrative expenses  and  in  this\r\n\r\nconnection, as I have just expressed myself to  be\r\n\r\napprehensive  about,  we  have  the   failure   of\r\n\r\nR.I.D.A. in  the  Federation  which  is   another\r\n\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the entrepot trade, Sir, I think this\r\n\r\ntrade  was  built, as in many industries,  by  the\r\n\r\nsheer  hard work of the people and in fact by  the\r\n\r\nvast  majority  of the businessmen here  who  were\r\n\r\noriginally  either clerks or labourers themselves.\r\n\r\nIt  is because of our facilities here, of our fine\r\n\r\nharbour  and of the services given by our banking.\r\n\r\ninsurance,   storage   and   especially   by   our\r\n\r\nbusinessmen who through long years have learned to\r\n\r\nre-process  whatever raw produce we get  from  the\r\n\r\nneighbouring territories to suit the world markets\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   Singapore  has  now  attained  its  present\r\n\r\nstatus. Government has expressed that it would try\r\n\r\nits  best \"to encourage entrepot trade\". This,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  is very good also, but I think the  basis\r\n\r\nfor  the entrepot trade has been built because  of\r\n\r\nthe free enterprise and the profit incentive which\r\n\r\nhave  encouraged people to take some risk. I think\r\n\r\nthat   where   Government  interference   is   not\r\n\r\nnecessary in the matter of encouragement it should\r\n\r\nrefrain  as far as possible from meddling  in  the\r\n\r\nentrepot trade and allow the traders to do it  for\r\n\r\nthemselves. One thing however which Government can\r\n\r\nimmediately  help very much in the maintenance  of\r\n\r\nthis entrepot trade is to see that a fair rate  of\r\n\r\nfreight  is being accorded to Singapore.  We  know\r\n\r\nthat  we  depend very much on shipping. Now,  some\r\n\r\ntime ago, we had the very disturbing spectacle  of\r\n\r\nseeing - I will quote one particular commodity - copra\r\n\r\ngoing  from the Philippines to Europe at the  rate\r\n\r\nof  110  shillings  per ton whereas  the  shipping\r\n\r\nconference  here was still charging us  241s.  6d.\r\n\r\nper  ton. Of course, representations were made and\r\n\r\nthe rate was reduced at one stage to 184 shillings\r\n\r\nand  now  to 136 shillings a ton which is still  a\r\n\r\nlong  way above the freight rate of other  places.\r\n\r\nThere  has been the question as to why copra  does\r\n\r\nnot  come here. In the ordinary course of trading,\r\n\r\nin  such  circumstances, copra will not come  here\r\n\r\nbecause  if  it  comes  here,  it  cannot  all  be\r\n\r\nconsumed  internally and even if  it  were  turned\r\n\r\ninto  oil,  it would still have to be  re-exported\r\n\r\nwith that handicap in freight to pay. So there  is\r\n\r\na  very great danger that Singapore's trade  would\r\n\r\nbe  at  the mercy and in the firm grip of shipping\r\n\r\nconferences.  We know that there is  a  world-wide\r\n\r\nrecession in shipping freights but we have not yet\r\n\r\nnoticed  that freight charges either  to  or  from\r\n\r\nSingapore  have been reduced. Another instance  in\r\n\r\nthis  connection is that I heard one  hon.  Member\r\n\r\nmention  this morning about local shipping:  there\r\n\r\nwas  a  lot  of  produce which used to  come  from\r\n\r\nplaces like Borneo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  Indonesia and landed here and which  was  re-processed  and  shipped to  Europe.  The  shipping\r\n\r\ncompanies  now  are enabling this  produce  to  be\r\n\r\nshipped  direct  on a through bill  of  lading  to\r\n\r\nEurope,  but using the free services of  Singapore\r\n\r\nharbour  storage to enable them to do so. This  is\r\n\r\nthe  most  important thing which I would like  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  look into if  we  are  not  to  be\r\n\r\ngradually cut off from our entrepot trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now coming to the elections next year or this\r\n\r\nyear,  from  the businessman's point  of  view,  I\r\n\r\nshould  say that business would have to  take  any\r\n\r\nGovernment   that   comes  in.   In   fact,   most\r\n\r\nbusinessmen have not much interest as to who is to\r\n\r\ngovern  next but they would certainly like to  see\r\n\r\nthat,  whichever Party comes into power, it has  a\r\n\r\nsense  of  responsibility  as  expressed  in   the\r\n\r\nGovernor's  Speech - a sense of  responsibility  to\r\n\r\nthe  livelihood of all the people here and not  to\r\n\r\none  section of the people. As I say, most of  the\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  have built up their  businesses  here\r\n\r\nfrom  scratch.  Most  of them were  labourers  and\r\n\r\nclerks  before.  By dint of hard work,  they  were\r\n\r\nable  to  achieve whatever they have  now  and  if\r\n\r\nthere   is  any  sign  that  Singapore  would   be\r\n\r\ndestroyed because of politics, then those who  are\r\n\r\nmost able to - the biggest ones - will be running away\r\n\r\nand  those  who cannot afford to run  away,  I  am\r\n\r\nquite sure, will fight for their lives. Therefore,\r\n\r\nI  should like all political Parties to bear  this\r\n\r\npoint   in  mind,  that  the  livelihood  of   the\r\n\r\npeople - capitalists, the average  businessman,  and\r\n\r\nevery section of the people - should be guarded  and\r\n\r\nnot  destroyed.  If  it were destroyed,  not  only\r\n\r\nwould  the present capital not be maintained  here\r\n\r\nbut  outside capital would surely not be attracted\r\n\r\nhere.   Besides,  as  I  said,  Singapore  thrives\r\n\r\nbecause of its services - the harbour, shipping  and\r\n\r\nstorage.  If  the services of these establishments\r\n\r\nwere  driven to be priced out of the world market,\r\n\r\nthen  there would surely be no trade here  and  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  trade here then everybody  will  be\r\n\r\nlosing their livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Something  has  gone   wrong\r\n\r\nsomewhere; I do not know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Perhaps you want to be the third Chief Minister!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Jumabhoy:</b> But one thing is certain; such\r\n\r\nalliances do not mean stability of the Government.\r\n\r\nThey  become friends, break off, attack,  do  this\r\n\r\nand do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, coming to the new constitution in His\r\n\r\nExcellency's Speech - I believe that this  has  been\r\n\r\nagreed  to by the last All-Party delegation  which\r\n\r\nwent  to  England - it  is a wonder  why  the  three\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties  have not  pressed  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom to send this new constitution earlier.  It\r\n\r\nwas the duty not of the Labour Front, because they\r\n\r\nwould like to govern as long as they can, but as a\r\n\r\nduty the Opposition Parties could have pressed for\r\n\r\nit  if they had wanted to. However, we are assured\r\n\r\nby  the  Hon. the Chief Minister that we  will  be\r\n\r\ngetting a copy of the new constitution by the  end\r\n\r\nof  this  month. Now, Sir, it is idle to  talk  of\r\n\r\nthis  new constitution because it has been  agreed\r\n\r\nto  already. This new constitution keeps Singapore\r\n\r\nstill as a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncolony  and  introduces  only  some  high-sounding\r\n\r\nwords.  As I have said before, we have no  control\r\n\r\nof  external affairs, foreign policy or defence in\r\n\r\nour  hands. We cannot even have trade and cultural\r\n\r\nrelations  with  other countries unless  with  the\r\n\r\nconsent  of the United Kingdom Government.  But  I\r\n\r\nwould  still  advise that we accept  this  as  the\r\n\r\nfuture   basis  to  secure  our  independence   by\r\n\r\nourselves, or by the coincidence of a new war,  or\r\n\r\npossibly by the establishment of a Commonwealth of\r\n\r\nAsian nations which might help us later; otherwise\r\n\r\nthere is no salvation and we have to remain as  we\r\n\r\nare.  Sir, I hope that there will be no more delay\r\n\r\nand   that  we  shall  get  the  new  constitution\r\n\r\nimmediately.\r\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to the subject of union with the\r\n\r\nFederation,  it is inevitable. Everybody  believes\r\n\r\nit and knows it but it is not possible at present.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows that too, why go on harping on the\r\n\r\nsame  subject  every  time?  The  Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister remarked that both territories are inter-dependent. I think that this is a fallacy;  it  is\r\n\r\nnot   correct.  Singapore  is  dependent  on   the\r\n\r\nFederation,  but not the Federation on  Singapore.\r\n\r\nWhy  say  something that is displeasing  to  them?\r\n\r\nWhat  for?  We have no raw materials of  our  own.\r\n\r\nWhatever  we  get  is from other  countries,  more\r\n\r\nespecially  from the Federation, such  as  rubber,\r\n\r\ntin,  copra, oil, and so on. They can  ship  their\r\n\r\ncommodities  direct.  Even the  limited  companies\r\n\r\nformed  here for rubber and tin, as time goes  by,\r\n\r\nwill shift to their place of origin, that is,  the\r\n\r\nFederation, where production takes place.  So  our\r\n\r\nposition  is  dependent on the Federation  and  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  consider  the Federation  as  our  elder\r\n\r\nbrother  and continue to humour them  as  long  as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the subject of elections, I will leave\r\n\r\nthis important subject to the last in my speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming, Sir, to the achievements of the present\r\n\r\nCoalition  Government, I do not think  that  there\r\n\r\nhas  been  any  of an extraordinary  nature.  What\r\n\r\nprogress  has been made in health, education,  and\r\n\r\nso on was either laid down in the policy of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  previous Government and it is the duty of the\r\n\r\nGovernment - or  whoever  is  in  power   for   that\r\n\r\nmatter - to continue the progress made, and they are\r\n\r\npaid for it very well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to entrepot trade, my good friend the\r\n\r\nnew  Nominated Member (Mr Tan Siak Kew) has given\r\n\r\ngood  advice.  He has had a lot of  experience  in\r\n\r\ntrade  for  many, many years. I myself  have  been\r\n\r\nwatching  the  entrepot trade since  the  last  44\r\n\r\nyears  in Singapore. We have lived on the entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade and if we want to exist, we have got to live\r\n\r\nonly  by the entrepot trade. We should try to keep\r\n\r\nit  so,  but  as I have said before in  this  very\r\n\r\nHouse  time and again that the countries who  have\r\n\r\nbecome independent have direct trade treaties with\r\n\r\nproducing, or manufacturing countries and that  it\r\n\r\nis cheaper for them to avoid Singapore. Further if\r\n\r\nthe costs are very high, we are certainly going to\r\n\r\nlose  the entrepot trade. This trade can  only  be\r\n\r\nmaintained by a stable Government and not by an un\r\n\r\nstable Government as it is at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, people talk about industries and foreign\r\n\r\ncapital. Will any one come and invest his  capital\r\n\r\nover here with all these troubles existing in this\r\n\r\nlittle   city   of  Singapore  plus  an   unstable\r\n\r\nGovernment?  Why  should anybody  come  here?  Why\r\n\r\nshould  foreign capital come here at  all?  Unless\r\n\r\nyou   create  a  favourable  climate  for  foreign\r\n\r\nindustrialists  to  come over here,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nreason for them to do so. On the other hand,  Sir,\r\n\r\neven  if  an industry is started, as I  said,  the\r\n\r\nbasic  need  for our products is cheap labour  and\r\n\r\nproduction should be cheap so that we can  compete\r\n\r\nwith  other producing countries and this  is  most\r\n\r\ndifficult over here. But we can certainly  do  one\r\n\r\nthing and that is this: we can encourage the women\r\n\r\nor  unemployed people or their children in cottage\r\n\r\nindustries. We can let them have a marketing board\r\n\r\nand  give them advances, and so on. That will keep\r\n\r\nthe  wolf from the door of the unemployed. But  to\r\n\r\ntalk big is nothing but nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one gentleman on this side of the House\r\n\r\ntouched  on local coastal shipping. Local  coastal\r\n\r\nshipping  means  ships  owned  by  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore or who at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleast  own 51 per cent of the capital. If that  is\r\n\r\nso, any government of any country - of course it has\r\n\r\nto be an independent country - will have legislation\r\n\r\nso  that  no other foreign ships will be  able  to\r\n\r\nengage in the coastal trade except those owned  by\r\n\r\nits  own  country.  It  is then  only  that  local\r\n\r\nshipping  can  thrive. I do  not  think  that  the\r\n\r\ncolony is in this position at present. Possibly, a\r\n\r\nfully  elected Government in September  this  year\r\n\r\nmay  be  able  to  devise  means  by  which  local\r\n\r\nshipping can flourish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, His Excellency has never mentioned the date\r\n\r\nof  the  next General Elections in his speech.  In\r\n\r\nSeptember  1956, when the Hon. the  present  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister (Dr Lim Yew Hock) took office he told us\r\n\r\nthat   his   Government  was  only   a   caretaker\r\n\r\nGovernment with the knowledge that he had only ten\r\n\r\nelected  Members on his side as against 15 elected\r\n\r\nMembers  in the Opposition. He has only 15 Members\r\n\r\nin  all on his side as against 17 on this side  of\r\n\r\nthe House. Of course, they had the private support\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P. Besides nobody else was willing  to\r\n\r\ntake  charge of the Government for a short period.\r\n\r\nWe  also  wanted  to give them  a  chance  in  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  talks  and we  wished  them  `good\r\n\r\nluck'.  But, Sir, a caretaker Government does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that it should continue in office  from  6th\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1956 up till now - not one day, one week\r\n\r\nor  one year, but nearly two years now - and it  now\r\n\r\nseeks  to  extend its office from  September  this\r\n\r\nyear  to  next March. In his own words,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister promised that the elections  would\r\n\r\ndefinitely be held in April this year and then  to\r\n\r\na question put by an hon. Member on this side, the\r\n\r\nthen Hon. the Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode)\r\n\r\nsaid that the elections would be held in August or\r\n\r\nSeptember this year. Now, Sir, what is the  reason\r\n\r\nfor  the  delay?  We all know  that  many  of  the\r\n\r\nMembers of this House who are drawing from $500 to\r\n\r\n$3,500 a month will not be here any more. Is their\r\n\r\nlust for power so great that they want to harm the\r\n\r\ncountry  by  sticking to their posts  as  long  as\r\n\r\npossible?  Sir, the controversy which I have  read\r\n\r\nabout in the Press is this,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand His Excellency has also mentioned it. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The time-table will depend on the preparation\r\n\r\nand  enactment  of  the  necessary  constitutional\r\n\r\ninstruments and legislation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>If  the  caretaker  Government were  honest,  they\r\n\r\ncould   have   introduced  all  this   legislation\r\n\r\nearlier. Why wait?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, District Council elections were to\r\n\r\nhave  been held in March, but now they are  to  be\r\n\r\nheld  in  June. Why? It is the people's  wish  and\r\n\r\nnobody can prevent them from voting one way or the\r\n\r\nother.  It  is for them to choose, but  for  God's\r\n\r\nsake, elect a stable government, whatever Party it\r\n\r\nmay be. We want stability, and the public will  at\r\n\r\nleast  know  that  they have  to  deal  with  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  only,  and they are waiting  for  that\r\n\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first phase of the Labour Front\r\n\r\nCoalition  Government has been murder,  riots  and\r\n\r\nstrikes.  The  second phase has  been  travelling,\r\n\r\nself-publicity  and talking.  I  do  not  see  any\r\n\r\nachievements - they  are  nil.  If  they  have  done\r\n\r\nanything good, well, it is their duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That is first-class!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education will take note of this - that\r\n\r\nhe  should be fair to all the languages which have\r\n\r\nbeen  accepted by this House and, if education  is\r\n\r\nto be given, it must be given equally to all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is driving out trade and\r\n\r\nindustry,  and is keeping the people in  suspense.\r\n\r\nIt  is  best for the Government to take  steps  to\r\n\r\nhold  the elections in September. Three months  or\r\n\r\nsix months of sticking to their posts will do them\r\n\r\nmore harm than good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.34 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  it  is rather regrettable that I,  the  only\r\n\r\nBack-bencher  on this side of the House,  have  to\r\n\r\ncriticise the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  today, and I hope that my action  will\r\n\r\nnot be interpreted by the Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nas  another attempt to make a hole in the  sinking\r\n\r\nship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

The Governor in his  speech  on\r\n\r\n22nd April, 1955, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"To further the carrying out of public housing\r\n\r\nand slum clearance, legislation will be introduced\r\n\r\nto  set  up  a  Housing Authority to  replace  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Trust.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 29th August, 1956, the Governor in his speech\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Public housing development has hitherto been\r\n\r\nslowed  down. To carry out this building programme,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Improvement Trust will be  replaced\r\n\r\nby a Housing Authority.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 9th April, 1958, the Governor in his\r\n\r\nspeech said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"To carry out future building programmes, the\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Trust will be converted into\r\n\r\na  Development and Housing Authority and  planning\r\n\r\nduties will be dealt with separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has only 225 square miles of land.\r\n\r\nPopulation  at present is 6,600 per  square  mile,\r\n\r\nand  may  by  1967  be  10,000  per  square  mile.\r\n\r\nConsequently, long-term planning is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure that all land is used in the  best  way\r\n\r\nand not wasted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is already three years since the Governor\r\n\r\npromised  this  House  that  legislation  will  be\r\n\r\nintroduced  to  have  a new Housing  and  Planning\r\n\r\nAuthority, and today, three years later, we  still\r\n\r\nhave  that kind of promise; and if we survive  the\r\n\r\nelections next year, it is quite possible the same\r\n\r\nthing  might be repeated in the Governor's  Speech\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to deal with the Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust. I endorse everything  that  has\r\n\r\nbeen  said  by the Member for Serangoon about  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T.  They  are the most obstructive,  the  most\r\n\r\ncorrupted organisation one can ever expect to have\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Shame on the Government!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> This corruption did not start\r\n\r\nonly  after  the war. It started even  before  the\r\n\r\nwar. I am sure everyone will remember how the then\r\n\r\nManager  of  the Singapore Improvement  Trust  was\r\n\r\nconveniently found drowned beside the reservoir at\r\n\r\nthe   height  of  the  investigation  into   Capt.\r\n\r\nLoveday's  corruption, and today, with development\r\n\r\nmore  than ten times that of pre-war, one can come\r\n\r\nto  the  conclusion of the kind of harm the S.I.T.\r\n\r\nhas done to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Improvement Trust is the Housing\r\n\r\nAuthority  as  well as the Planning Authority  for\r\n\r\nSingapore. Let us start with the Housing Authority\r\n\r\nfirst. I am not going to be so unkind as Dr  Foch\r\n\r\nwho  has  criticised the housing  put  up  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Trust as being monotonous. I\r\n\r\nthink,  on the whole, it is not so badly designed.\r\n\r\nBut  what  I would like to say is that the  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nare  most unrealistic. They are talking of  having\r\n\r\ntwo  bedrooms,  a sitting-room, a  dining-room,  a\r\n\r\nkitchen  and everything for the people. Yes,  very\r\n\r\ngood,  I agree, but can you provide enough  units?\r\n\r\nWith  the limited resources the S.I.T. has at  its\r\n\r\ncommand,  how many hundreds of years do you  think\r\n\r\nthe S.I.T. would take to provide anything near  to\r\n\r\nthe  requirements of the people? Sir, I have  seen\r\n\r\nhousing  throughout the world. If the S.I.T. were\r\n\r\nmore  realistic,  I think they should  adopt  some\r\n\r\nthings  that  Hongkong has done. I would  not  say\r\n\r\ntheir's is the best way of housing people, but the\r\n\r\nhousing authorities in Hongkong are more realistic\r\n\r\nand  they  can cater for a much bigger  number  of\r\n\r\npeople  than can the S.I.T. today. The people  are\r\n\r\nbeing housed in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsingle   units - by  single  units,  I  mean  single\r\n\r\nrooms - an  area of 10 feet by 12 feet, with  common\r\n\r\nkitchens and bathrooms. I do agree that is not the\r\n\r\nbest  way of doing it, but it is a practical  way.\r\n\r\nWith  the  same  amount of  money  you  can  house\r\n\r\npossibly  four  families instead  of  one  family.\r\n\r\nUntil  you  can do better, why not give them  that\r\n\r\ntype  of  housing today, instead  of  having,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, the recent fire at Lorong 3? And  if  we\r\n\r\nare not going to do anything, we may have many  of\r\n\r\nthese  Lorong  3  fires to come. They  had  one  a\r\n\r\ncouple  of  years  ago, they  have  had  one  very\r\n\r\nrecently, and they may have many more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> God forbid!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Whether God forbids or not, it\r\n\r\nis  a  fact we must face. I can imagine  what  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. are thinking about. They say, \"We will plan\r\n\r\nan  ideal  town. We can possibly get a few  medals\r\n\r\nfrom  the Town Planning Society.\" But they  forget\r\n\r\nthat  these medals are stained with the  blood  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore and that their  children\r\n\r\nwill  be only too pleased to get rid of them.  The\r\n\r\nS.I.T. just want idealism. What do they care  for\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore? They will go  away  very\r\n\r\nsoon from here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now about the Planning Authority, as the Member\r\n\r\nfor Serangoon has said, they are most obstructive.\r\n\r\nWe  know  very well, as I said a moment ago,  that\r\n\r\nwith  the  limited resources at its  command,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will never expect to solve the  housing\r\n\r\nproblem  for  Singapore for  generations  to  come\r\n\r\nwithout assistance from the general public. So  it\r\n\r\nis  only to be expected that an organisation  like\r\n\r\nthe  S.I.T. should assist in whatever way it could\r\n\r\nin developing the housing industry or whatever the\r\n\r\nrequirements of this place demand.

The question\r\n\r\nis  this: the Planning Authority has a lot  to  do\r\n\r\nwith  the prosperity of this place, whether it  is\r\n\r\nhousing, schools or factories, and I would like to\r\n\r\ncrave  the indulgence of this House if  I  may  be\r\n\r\npermitted to quote a few examples of the  type  of\r\n\r\ntreatment which the public gets from the S.I.T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for instance, a piece of land in South\r\n\r\nBridge Road. One association wanted to develop  it\r\n\r\nand  build a number of shophouses and a few  flats\r\n\r\non  it.  The  original application  was  submitted\r\n\r\nabout 1950. When the application was presented  to\r\n\r\nthe   S.I.T.,  they  turned  round  and  told  the\r\n\r\nassociation, \"Oh, you cannot do that. That land is\r\n\r\nrequired for a traffic island. It will be cut into\r\n\r\nhalf.  What  about  changing  over  to  the   land\r\n\r\nopposite?\" The association said, \"Yes, since  this\r\n\r\nis  for the improvement of the town, we should co-operate  with  the authorities.\" After  that,  the S.I.T. said,  \"Oh, no, there is a  difference  in\r\n\r\nvalue.   The   opposite  will  be   dearer.\"   The\r\n\r\nassociation  then said, \"All right, then  you  get\r\n\r\nthe   City  Assessor  to  assess  the  land.\"  The\r\n\r\nAssessor  said,  \"$10 a square  foot  extra.\"  The\r\n\r\nassociation said, \"All right, whatever it  is,  we\r\n\r\nare  quite  prepared  to do it.\"  This  time,  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. said,  \"No,  we do not  need  the  traffic\r\n\r\nisland  any  more.  You start  re-submitting  your\r\n\r\nplan\". When the association submitted their  plan,\r\n\r\nthe S.I.T. replied, \"No, we are still not sure  of\r\n\r\nthe  scheme.  Can  you wait six  months  or  eight\r\n\r\nmonths?\" The association said, \"All right, we will\r\n\r\nwait eight months.\" After eight months, the S.I.T.\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"You can proceed with the scheme,  but  you\r\n\r\nmust  bear  in  mind that there  will  be  a  road\r\n\r\noverhead,  20 feet above the street, and  provided\r\n\r\nyou  comply with that, we will approve the  plan.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the association submitted the plan, they said\r\n\r\nthis time, \"Oh, no, the Master Plan considers that\r\n\r\nan  ancient building must be preserved.\" And there\r\n\r\nyou are stuck. So you can see, in 1950 the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.I.T. knew very well that the association wanted\r\n\r\nto   turn  that  ancient  temple  into  a   modern\r\n\r\nbuilding,  yet today that half-fallen building  is\r\n\r\nstill there for everyone to see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case is about an application for a\r\n\r\nfactory in the Tiong Bahru area. It is about eight\r\n\r\nyears  ago. The application was submitted  to  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. but no reply was received from them.  When\r\n\r\nthe  applicant asked, \"Why do you not  give  us  a\r\n\r\nreply?\",  they said, \"Oh, we sent it to the  wrong\r\n\r\narchitect.\" Afterwards they said, \"Oh,  we  cannot\r\n\r\ngive you a reply. We want the land to develop some\r\n\r\nother building.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing that the Government should have\r\n\r\npreference  over private requirements,  yet  today\r\n\r\nthe empty land is still there. If you are in their\r\n\r\ngroup, you can get everything done. You can always\r\n\r\nget  away  with  murder.  If  you  are  not,  then\r\n\r\neverything is wrong because, as one member of  the\r\n\r\nBoard  of the S.I.T. told me, \"The power given  to\r\n\r\nthem is shocking.\" If you apply to the S.I.T. for\r\n\r\npermission to build a factory on a piece  of  land\r\n\r\njust  outside the so-called factory area which  is\r\n\r\nof  their own making - no one knows what it  is  and\r\n\r\nhow  far it extends - they say, \"Oh, yes, since  you\r\n\r\nare  a  friend,  we will just lift  the  line  and\r\n\r\ninclude  your  piece of land.  All  right,  it  is\r\n\r\napproved.\" If you are not, they say, \"Oh, no, your\r\n\r\nland is just outside the factory area.\" And if you\r\n\r\ntalk  too  much, they will just lift the line  and\r\n\r\nput  the centre on the land and render it useless.\r\n\r\nIf  you  appeal to the Governor - there is no appeal\r\n\r\nto the courts - then the Governor will write back to\r\n\r\nthe S.I.T. and the S.I.T. will advise the Governor\r\n\r\naccordingly, and you get nowhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone may ask why those who drew up the\r\n\r\nlegislation should make it in such a way. Well,  I\r\n\r\nthink  I can tell you why, because those who  drew\r\n\r\nup  the legislation then knew very well they  were\r\n\r\nin  it.  When  they  were in it,  they  knew  that\r\n\r\nthrough  their influence they could  get  whatever\r\n\r\nthey  wanted. It is because they can get what they\r\n\r\nwant and others cannot that they can make money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another complaint is that the S.I.T. never give\r\n\r\nyou  the  reason in writing for disapproving  your\r\n\r\napplication,  so  there  is  no  proof.  If   they\r\n\r\ndisapprove  your application, they say,  \"You  can\r\n\r\nalways  come  and interview the Manager.\"  I  have\r\n\r\ninterviewed  the Manager four times  on  the  same\r\n\r\ncase, and four times he gave me different reasons.\r\n\r\nThe   S.I.T. do  not  give  you  a  reason   for\r\n\r\ndisapproval  in  writing  because   it   is   very\r\n\r\nconvenient  for them to do so. The S.I.T. do  not\r\n\r\ngive you a reason for disapproval in writing. They\r\n\r\ncan  favour their friends when they come, or  they\r\n\r\nare  offered a big enough prize to do so. Such  is\r\n\r\nthe  S.I.T.- and yet that kind of organisation  is\r\n\r\nallowed  to remain with this Government for  three\r\n\r\nyears!  Every time we ask the Ministry, \"What  are\r\n\r\nyou  going  to  do  about  it?\",  they  say,  \"The\r\n\r\nexpatriate   officers  are   objecting.\"   I   can\r\n\r\nunderstand  why they are objecting, because  their\r\n\r\ngrabbing  opportunities are about to  come  to  an\r\n\r\nend;  because  they know their days are  numbered,\r\n\r\nand  if  they do not grab now, they have no chance\r\n\r\nof  grabbing any more. That is the reason for this\r\n\r\ndelayed  legislation and unless it is  brought  up\r\n\r\nvery  soon,  I  think I will have to  introduce  a\r\n\r\nmotion to amend the S.I.T. Ordinance and take  out\r\n\r\nthe absolute powers given to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I wish to raise is the Public\r\n\r\nWorks  Department. The P.W.D. is known  throughout\r\n\r\nSingapore   for   building  the   most   expensive\r\n\r\nbuildings  they can ever think of, because  it  is\r\n\r\npublic  money, and if those who are in control  of\r\n\r\nbuilding do not make the cost as high as possible,\r\n\r\nhow  can they squeeze anything out of it? Remember\r\n\r\nthat  you  cannot squeeze water out  of  a  stone.\r\n\r\nFortunately we have a Financial Secretary  who  is\r\n\r\nmost sympathic-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What is he suffering from?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam:</b> Sympathetic. I have managed to\r\n\r\npersuade him to see some three bedroom flats  with\r\n\r\nall  the proper finishes costing less than $20,000\r\n\r\neach, whereas the P.W.D. ask for more than $50,000\r\n\r\nfor  an  ordinary assistant doctor's flat.  During the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBudget  debate on the question of the Polytechnic,\r\n\r\nI  asked that a commission be set up. What did the\r\n\r\nGovernment   do?  They  appointed  an   expatriate\r\n\r\nofficer, an ex-architect of the P.W.D., giving him\r\n\r\n$8,000  to do a two months' job. When I asked  the\r\n\r\nMinister, \"Why do you pay him so much money?\", his\r\n\r\nreply was, \"If I do not pay him in a lump sum,  he\r\n\r\nmight  take  years  to do it. That  will  be  more\r\n\r\nexpensive.\"   If  the  Minister  had   so   little\r\n\r\nconfidence in that expatriate officer, do you  not\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  quite possible  that  if  a  person\r\n\r\nslipped  a  few thousand dollars in  his  hand  he\r\n\r\nwould  make  an  entirely wrong report,  different\r\n\r\nfrom  what  the actual situation was?  I  appealed\r\n\r\nonce to the Minister to have a committee set up to\r\n\r\nenquire  how  to cheapen the cost of building.  I,\r\n\r\nfor one, am prepared to challenge the Minister  or\r\n\r\nany  of  his  experts to a public  debate  on  the\r\n\r\nP.W.D.,  without the protection of the  privileges\r\n\r\nof   this  House,  at  any  time,  any  place  and\r\n\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday\r\n\r\none  of  the Members of this House criticised  the\r\n\r\nmorale  and  efficiency of the police and  claimed\r\n\r\nthat  the  public  has entirely no  confidence  or\r\n\r\nfaith  in  the police, especially the  detectives.\r\n\r\nSir,  there  is  no foundation or  truth  in  this\r\n\r\nstatement. I am not surprised at this statement at\r\n\r\nall,  for  there are many people in Singapore  who\r\n\r\nbelieve that there is no need at all for a  police\r\n\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, relations between the people and the police\r\n\r\nhave  been disturbed first by the first world  war\r\n\r\nand  then  by the emergency. In recent  years  the\r\n\r\npolice  have  steadily built up public confidence.\r\n\r\nAdequate  measures  have from time  to  time  been\r\n\r\ntaken  to  see that the police - public co-operation\r\n\r\nis  maintained  at a high level. In  a  democratic\r\n\r\ncountry,  Sir,  it is wrong for the Government  to\r\n\r\nresort to either Fascist or Communist methods  for\r\n\r\nthe  prevention and detection of crime. Government\r\n\r\nis taking the natural cure through firm education,\r\n\r\nwhich  is the only lasting and worthwhile measure.\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  doing its utmost  to  educate  the\r\n\r\npeople. Already\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  police are taking a big part in the  frequent\r\n\r\ncivics   courses   run  by   the   Department   of\r\n\r\nInformation   Services.   Police   officers    are\r\n\r\nlecturing in schools, at rural district committees\r\n\r\nand community centres. I am sure hon. Members, are\r\n\r\naware  that these lectures have done good  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.  I  am reliably informed that  the  police\r\n\r\nhave received favourable reactions as a result  of\r\n\r\nthese lectures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police are trying to get more public\r\n\r\ntelephones  for  emergency  reports,  and  it   is\r\n\r\npleasing  to note that the mobile police  stations\r\n\r\nwhich  were  in  use recently have been  extremely\r\n\r\nuseful  to the people. Efforts to break  down  the\r\n\r\nmistaken  idea  that the police  are  in  any  way\r\n\r\ndifferent from the people have been made. Talks by\r\n\r\nthe  police officers drawn from the various  units\r\n\r\nthey belong to about the inside of their work  and\r\n\r\nhow  they can help the public are being organised.\r\n\r\nThis  will  also  illustrate the normal  every-day\r\n\r\ncontacts  of  the  police  with  the  public.  The\r\n\r\nDepartment of Information Services will take  tape\r\n\r\nrecordings   of  these  talks  in  all  vernacular\r\n\r\nlanguages  and broadcast to the people  throughout\r\n\r\nthe length and breadth of Singapore. The radio and\r\n\r\nRediffusion  will  assist  in  our  campaign  with\r\n\r\nprogrammes on the police background. Radio  Malaya\r\n\r\nwill  also  ask listeners for questions on  police\r\n\r\nmatters  and  will  build up Question  and  Answer\r\n\r\nprogrammes. Dramatised shows are also  planned  on\r\n\r\nthe theme - Police at your service - to stimulate the\r\n\r\npeople's  interest. Four films of police work  are\r\n\r\nin  the making. These will be shown throughout the\r\n\r\nisland  of Singapore. We are also seeking the  co-operation  of theatre management in  the  city  as\r\n\r\nwell as in the rural areas to show these films  to\r\n\r\nthe  people.  Besides  these,  the  Department  of\r\n\r\nInformation  Services will show  them  in  various\r\n\r\nparts of the rural areas in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A poster competition has been initiated by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  illustrate  the  slogan  \"Citizens\r\n\r\nfight  the  extortion evil\", and I hope  that  the\r\n\r\npeople will enter this competition and make  it  a\r\n\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hoped, Sir, that these efforts, which are\r\n\r\ndesigned  to  promote  co-operation  between   the\r\n\r\npolice  and public, will be a success and  through\r\n\r\nthis  education young people will not be attracted\r\n\r\nto gangsterism. Sir, this is the answer to Members\r\n\r\nwho  spoke  on  secret societies and  the  methods\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Government is taking  to  educate  the\r\n\r\npeople to understand police activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a Member of the Assembly, I would like to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  the debate. Some Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  have clearly indicated that  they  are\r\n\r\nnot  interested in any of the plans  envisaged  by\r\n\r\nthe Government in the coming months. But as far as\r\n\r\nI  am  concerned, Sir, I particularly attach great\r\n\r\nimportance  to the Rural Development  Panel  which\r\n\r\nthe  Government will be setting up shortly. For  a\r\n\r\nvery  long time in the rural areas there has  been\r\n\r\nno  co-ordination to stimulate the  rural  economy\r\n\r\nand  to raise the standard of living of the  rural\r\n\r\ndwellers. So the Rural Development Panel  will  be\r\n\r\nparticularly welcomed by them. In the rural  areas\r\n\r\nparticularly there are very many roads which  need\r\n\r\nimmediate  attention, roads which  would  help  to\r\n\r\nraise  the  standard of living of the agricultural\r\n\r\nworkers-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.
