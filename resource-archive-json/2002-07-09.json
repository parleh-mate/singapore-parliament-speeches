Programmes\r\n\r\ninclude:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Incorporating smoking as a topic in the school\r\n\r\ncurriculum from Primary 3 to Secondary 4.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Use of student peer leaders to spread the smoke\r\n\r\nfree message.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Training teachers to conduct smoking cessation\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Providing schools with a grant for students to\r\n\r\nimplement smoking control programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Promoting soccer and rugby as healthy alternatives\r\n\r\nto smoking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Commissioning theatre companies to perform skits\r\n\r\nto  teach  students about the harmful effects of  smoking\r\n\r\nand ways to refuse offers of cigarettes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's National Smoking Control Campaign is\r\n\r\ntargeted  at  youths,  particularly those  between  13-18\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures taken over the years have been\r\n\r\neffective.  A survey conducted among 13,111 secondary one\r\n\r\nto   four  students  in  2000  showed  that,  among   the\r\n\r\nrespondents, about 96% know that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsmoking  is  harmful to their health and  94%  know  that\r\n\r\nsecondhand smoke is harmful to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among those aged 18-19 years for which longitudinal\r\n\r\ndata  is  available, the smoking prevalence has  declined\r\n\r\nfrom 15% in 1992 to 11% in 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HPB will persist in its efforts to counter the\r\n\r\ninfluences on youths to smoke.

To\r\n\r\nme,  this is alarming.  There are two aspects to it:  one\r\n\r\nis  deterrent  and  the  other  is  preventive.   We  are\r\n\r\nconcentrating  on the preventive part.  On the  deterrent\r\n\r\npart,  121 convictions for a period of nine years,  which\r\n\r\nis  12  convictions per year, to me, this number is  very\r\n\r\nsmall.   Because,  in a report in the  Straits  Times  in\r\n\r\nFebruary, an 18-year old said that one could actually get\r\n\r\ncigarettes from any void deck shop, because they  do  not\r\n\r\nask for the age, identification papers, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether there\r\n\r\nis  a  mismatch,  in  terms of the  actual  incidence  of\r\n\r\nsmoking by persons below the age of 18 years and the rate\r\n\r\nof  conviction, and whether there is a need  for  greater\r\n\r\nenforcement on the part of the Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, I think both need to be\r\n\r\ndone.

Surely, it is better  to  recruit\r\n\r\nfrom such reputable previously recognised universities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, Dr Lily Neo refers to the\r\n\r\nMRA  Schedule that came into force in 1993.  The Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  received  many requests for the MRA Schedule  to  be\r\n\r\nrevised,  in particular, to restore medical schools  that\r\n\r\nwere  recognised  prior to 1993  to  the  Schedule.   Our\r\n\r\nposition at this time\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  that  there is no need to amend the schedule for  the\r\n\r\nfollowing reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current shortage of doctors in the public sector\r\n\r\nis  due to two main factors.  Firstly, there was a marked\r\n\r\nreduction in the NUS medical school intake from  1991  to\r\n\r\n1996.  NUS has already increased its intake progressively\r\n\r\nfrom  1997  onwards.  But the increase of junior  doctors\r\n\r\nwill  only begin to enter the medical workforce from 2007\r\n\r\nonwards.     Secondly,    there    is    a    significant\r\n\r\nmaldistribution of doctors between the public and private\r\n\r\nsectors.   For  example, while there  is  a  shortage  of\r\n\r\njunior  doctors in the public sector institutions,  there\r\n\r\nis a surplus of GPs.  In addition, there are shortages in\r\n\r\nsome  specialties,  due either to  the  rapid  growth  in\r\n\r\ndemand   or   unpopularity  of  that  specialty   amongst\r\n\r\ntrainees.   The situation is compounded by the very  long\r\n\r\ntime  -  generally,  six  years -  required  to  train  a\r\n\r\nspecialist.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our assessment is that an annual intake of 230-250\r\n\r\nstudents   into   the  Faculty  of   Medicine   at   NUS,\r\n\r\nsupplemented by an annual intake of 50-80 foreign-trained\r\n\r\ndoctors - many of whom would be returning Singaporeans  - would  be sufficient to meet our overall clinical service\r\n\r\nneeds.   Expanding  the Schedule to address  the  present\r\n\r\nshortage will create more problems in the longer term  by\r\n\r\nallowing  a greater influx of foreign doctors that  would\r\n\r\ncontinue after the manpower situation has eased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current registration system already allows\r\n\r\nforeign-trained specialists from medical schools, both on\r\n\r\nand  off  the  Schedule,  to  work  in  Singapore,  under\r\n\r\nconditional  registration, to support  the  delivery  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our clinical services.  The Schedule  does\r\n\r\nnot  prevent  or  hinder  the entry  of  foreign  medical\r\n\r\ntalent, especially in disciplines where local specialists\r\n\r\nare  in short supply.  In this regard, the Schedule  does\r\n\r\nnot   impede  or  conflict  with  the  plans  to  develop\r\n\r\nSingapore  into a biomedical research hub, as well  as  a\r\n\r\nregional medical service hub.  Both of these developments\r\n\r\nwould  require the inputs of fully-qualified specialists,\r\n\r\nrather than doctors with only basic medical degrees.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expanding the Schedule will increase the number of\r\n\r\noptions  that  Singaporeans will have to  study  medicine\r\n\r\nabroad,  if  they  are  unable to enter  the  Faculty  of\r\n\r\nMedicine at NUS.  Given the popularity of medicine  as  a\r\n\r\ncareer  and  the  calibre of students seeking  admission,\r\n\r\nsuch  an increase would have significant implications  on\r\n\r\nour national talent spread.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister of State\r\n\r\ndid  not  answer my question on whether it will  diminish\r\n\r\nour  reputation  and our standards by  employing  doctors\r\n\r\nfrom the neighbouring unrecognised universities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from the list\r\n\r\nof   universities,  there  are  seven  doctors  from  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Malaya and the University  of  Indonesia.\r\n\r\nWhen  our  hospitals went to recruit these doctors,  they\r\n\r\nrecruited  the best from Malaysia and in Indonesia.

These are not the universities  in\r\n\r\nthe Schedule at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no\r\n\r\ncontradiction.   We recruit foreign doctors  during  this\r\n\r\nperiod  because  there  is  a shortage.   But  corrective\r\n\r\nmeasures  have been taken.  The intake in the  university\r\n\r\nhas  been increased, and it takes a long time to train  a\r\n\r\ndoctor.   So these medical students will become  doctors,\r\n\r\nand they will enter and work in the hospitals in 2007.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Schedule is to ensure that there\r\n\r\nis   an   even  distribution  of  talent  amongst   young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans in the various careers.  If the Schedule  is\r\n\r\nremoved,  then a greater number of Singaporeans would  go\r\n\r\nabroad  and  study medicine if they cannot get  into  the\r\n\r\nmedical  school in Singapore.  However, even if a  doctor\r\n\r\nis  from a university that is not in the Schedule, he can\r\n\r\ncome back to Singapore and, under certain conditions, get\r\n\r\nhimself registered.  Basically, it would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  under a conditional registration and he would have to\r\n\r\nsit   for  an  examination.

Close captioning, an  alternative  system\r\n\r\nused  in  the  US, UK and Australia, works  by  means  of\r\n\r\ncaptions  hidden in the video signal, to be  recalled  by\r\n\r\nviewers  when needed.  However, this concept  has  to  be\r\n\r\nfurther studied, as it requires substantial high costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, broadcasters do, during `live' telecast\r\n\r\nof  important speeches, provide summaries of main  points\r\n\r\nmade during the speech.

However,  SBA  will  further  explore  with\r\n\r\nbroadcasters  the possibility of providing  the  hearing-impaired with subtitles during major Government speeches.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  mentioned about cost.  Is it  possible  to\r\n\r\nknow  how  costly this service would be?   On  the  point\r\n\r\nabout  the lack of resources, there are a lot of  signing\r\n\r\nclasses  that  go on, especially through  the  YMCA,  and\r\n\r\npeople  are  certified.  How does the Minister  see  this\r\n\r\nproblem?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the costs, at best,\r\n\r\nare  estimates  at  this point in  time.   MediaCorp  had\r\n\r\nestimated previously that the cost of setting up a  close\r\n\r\ncaption system is about $250,000.  But, more importantly,\r\n\r\nthey also estimated that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nannual operating cost of a close caption system could  be\r\n\r\nclose to $300,000.  It is a fairly substantial cost,  and\r\n\r\nit is a question then of costs and benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the shortage of signing\r\n\r\npersonnel,  the problem actually is a little bit  deeper,\r\n\r\nand that is because there is not just one signing method.\r\n\r\nIn  the schools in Singapore, they teach something  which\r\n\r\nis called \"signing exact English\", and that is a word for\r\n\r\nword  signing.  This is a fairly slow process because  if\r\n\r\neverybody speaks at the rate I do now, one could keep  up\r\n\r\nwith word for word signing.  But not everybody speaks  at\r\n\r\na  very  slow rate.  So, this could present a difficulty.\r\n\r\nMany hearing-impaired people also adopt more of their own\r\n\r\nsimplified signing, which captures the gist of the ideas.\r\n\r\nSo,   when  we  talk  about  a  pool  of  people  to   do\r\n\r\nsimultaneous translations, so to speak, into sign, we  do\r\n\r\nnot  just require a person who can do exact word signing,\r\n\r\nbut  we  also  need somebody who understands the  subject\r\n\r\nmatter,  is  able to think on the spot, and  can  quickly\r\n\r\ncapture  the  essence of the message  and  translate  it.\r\n\r\nThat  is difficult.  We do not have a lot of people  that\r\n\r\nwe can call on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, knowing the\r\n\r\ndifficulties   of   providing   signing   for   important\r\n\r\nprogrammes  for  the hearing-impaired, has  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nasked the broadcasters for the cost of providing at least\r\n\r\nsub-titling,  if not close captioning for such  important\r\n\r\nprogrammes?   I  would also like to ask the  Minister  to\r\n\r\ncomment  on the fact that as the Government does  provide\r\n\r\nfunds  for  public service broadcasts - in  the  case  of\r\n\r\nMediaCorp, to the tune of some $80 million a year - is it\r\n\r\nnot possible for the broadcasters to provide at least sub-titling for some programmes?  The Ministry could consider\r\n\r\nproviding some funds to the broadcasters to provide  such\r\n\r\nservices  for  important  programmes  like  daily   news,\r\n\r\ndocumentaries and educational programmes.   Many  of  the\r\n\r\nhearing-impaired  have  equal  intellectual  capacity  as\r\n\r\ntheir hearing peers, and they would be able to understand\r\n\r\nthe  full  extent  of  the  programmes,  and  watch  such\r\n\r\nprogrammes with their families.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Amy Khor, no speeches.

She is a well-known role  model\r\n\r\nfor the hearing-impaired community.

We have said that we  would\r\n\r\nexplore this.  But sub-titling means that it is no longer\r\n\r\nsigning.   It  is put into a form that is  in  a  regular\r\n\r\nlanguage,  so  to speak.  If you are then  talking  about\r\n\r\nreading it off the television screen, you might also want\r\n\r\nto  consider, in terms of the cost-effectiveness, whether\r\n\r\nit is not more practical to read it off the newspapers or\r\n\r\nthe   Internet.   But  notwithstanding  that,  we   would\r\n\r\nconsider whether for important speeches, we can have more\r\n\r\nsub-titling.  Sub-titling  can  sometimes  disturb  other\r\n\r\nviewers.   Also, we can only sub-title, at most,  in  one\r\n\r\nlanguage,  and  we have got to decide which  language  we\r\n\r\nwant to sub-title in.  If we want to be able to reach  to\r\n\r\nall  the  hearing-impaired, and we have got four official\r\n\r\nlanguages that we want to sub-title in, then we would see\r\n\r\nnothing else on the screen.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, as most of the\r\n\r\nimportant programmes are broadcast in English,  like  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's National Day Rally speech, would it  be\r\n\r\nall right to provide sub-titling in English?  That is the\r\n\r\nfeedback  I have got from the hearing-impaired community.\r\n\r\nIn  addition, I would also like him to comment on what he\r\n\r\nsaid in Parliament yesterday that images and pictures  on\r\n\r\nthe  television  screen conjure very  powerful  messages.\r\n\r\nTogether with the sub-titling, the hearing-impaired would\r\n\r\nhave  the  full  impact and implication of  the  speeches\r\n\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, I am very gratified that\r\n\r\nsomebody listened to me yesterday.

I will now turn to Question No. 11.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Home Protection Scheme (HPS) is\r\n\r\na  mortgage  reducing insurance scheme that protects  CPF\r\n\r\nmembers  who  have obtained housing loans  from  approved\r\n\r\nauthorities  against losing their flats  purchased  under\r\n\r\nthe Public Housing Scheme should they become disabled  or\r\n\r\npass  away  before their loans are repaid. A  CPF  member\r\n\r\nwould  qualify to claim under the Home Protection  Scheme\r\n\r\nif there was an outstanding loan to discharge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Mdm Jenny Koh's case, based on the intended\r\n\r\nloan  commencement date, 1st August 2001, as provided  by\r\n\r\nthe  Housing  and Development Board, the  CPF  Board  had\r\n\r\ndeducted  the  premium and sent Mdm Koh and her  husband,\r\n\r\nthe  late  Mr Yee, a certificate informing them that  the\r\n\r\ncover commencement date was\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1st  August  2001.  The cover under the  Home  Protection\r\n\r\nScheme  was  premised on the condition that the  purchase\r\n\r\ntransaction would be subsequently completed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unfortunately, Mr Yee passed away before he\r\n\r\ncompleted  the  purchase transaction.  In  the  light  of\r\n\r\nthis, the CPF Board took the position that a housing loan\r\n\r\nhad not been taken, as Mr Yee was not the legal owner  of\r\n\r\nthe  flat  at the time of his sudden demise.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nwhile  we  sympathised with Mdm Koh and her  family,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  was not able to accede to her appeals  and  had\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  Board discharge his loan liability to HDB  when\r\n\r\nthere was no outstanding housing loan to discharge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her subsequent appeals were rejected as the Board\r\n\r\nexplained that the Home Protection Scheme (HPS)  did  not\r\n\r\napply  to  Mr Yee since he had not withdrawn  any  monies\r\n\r\nfrom  his CPF account to repay the HDB housing loan. This\r\n\r\nwas  premised on the interpretation of section  29(2)  of\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  Act  which provides that the HPS applies  to  a\r\n\r\nmember  of the CPF Fund who had withdrawn monies standing\r\n\r\nto  his credit in the CPF Fund to repay any instalment of\r\n\r\nhousing  loan.   Prior  to this  case,  the  CPF  Board's\r\n\r\ninterpretation  and  procedures  had  worked   well   for\r\n\r\npractically all the Home Protection Scheme cases.   In  a\r\n\r\nway,  Mdm  Koh's case is exceptional as it  involved  the\r\n\r\nquestion of whether there is insurance coverage before  a\r\n\r\nperson becomes a legal owner of his flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, my Ministry conducted\r\n\r\nanother  review  of  the  case and,  in  particular,  the\r\n\r\nlegislative  framework  which  governed  the  scope   and\r\n\r\napplication  of  the  Home  Protection  Scheme  was   re-examined.   I  thought  this  was  necessary  as  I   was\r\n\r\nconcerned that there may be pre-existing ambiguity in the\r\n\r\ninterpretation of the provisions governing the  scope  of\r\n\r\nthe  HPS.   In this regard, guidance was sought from  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's Chambers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Attorney-General's Chambers has\r\n\r\nadvised that the legislative scope of the Home Protection\r\n\r\nScheme is provided under section 29(1) of the CPF\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAct  and  that  this section did not require  Mr  Yee  to\r\n\r\ncomplete  the purchase transaction or to withdraw  monies\r\n\r\nfrom  his CPF account to repay the loan in order for  the\r\n\r\nScheme to apply to him.  It was sufficient if there was a\r\n\r\nvalid  housing  loan  discharge and the  Home  Protection\r\n\r\nScheme  premiums  had  been deducted.   Therefore,  since\r\n\r\nthere  was  in  place an agreement for HDB  to  extend  a\r\n\r\nhousing loan to Mdm Koh and her late husband jointly, and\r\n\r\nthe  Home  Protection Scheme premiums had  been  deducted\r\n\r\nfrom the CPF accounts of Mdm Koh and her husband, the CPF\r\n\r\nBoard  could  discharge Mr Yee's liability to  repay  the\r\n\r\nhousing  loan  to HDB.  This review has brought  about  a\r\n\r\nfavourable outcome for Mdm Koh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the course of the review, the Board has also\r\n\r\nlooked  at past claims, rejection cases, in order to  see\r\n\r\nif  there were similar cases that require a re-look.  The\r\n\r\nBoard  told  me  that there is only one case  that  might\r\n\r\nrequire  re-consideration.  This case is  being  reviewed\r\n\r\nnow.   Similar  incidents are unlikely to  occur  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture  as we have now clarified the legal interpretation\r\n\r\nas to when the Home Protection Scheme coverage would take\r\n\r\neffect  for cases of this nature. The CPF Board has  also\r\n\r\nintroduced new procedures to ensure that such cases  will\r\n\r\nnot be repeated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in fact, in order to avoid any ambiguity in the\r\n\r\ninterpretation of the relevant provisions of the Act,  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  will  consider  amending  the  legislation.  We\r\n\r\nintend  to  rephrase the legislation such that  the  Home\r\n\r\nProtection Scheme coverage for a member would begin  once\r\n\r\nthere  is a valid housing loan agreement with the HDB  or\r\n\r\nany  other  approved mortgagee and the HPS  premiums  are\r\n\r\ndeducted by the CPF Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> I thank the Minister for\r\n\r\nhis    long   and   very   extensive   explanation    and\r\n\r\nclarification.

In the case of Woodlands,\r\n\r\nfor  every  1,000 flats completed in recent years,  about\r\n\r\n200 instances of unsatisfactory workmanship were reported\r\n\r\nwithin the defects liability period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of HDB's quality improvement system, regular\r\n\r\nreviews  and analyses of public feedback are carried  out\r\n\r\nso  that  continuous improvements to building design  and\r\n\r\nfinishes  can  be  made.  Over the years,  Sir,  HDB  has\r\n\r\npushed  for  the use of more pre-cast components  in  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of its flats to improve flat quality.   HDB\r\n\r\nhas also introduced several\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasures to further improve certain aspects of its flats,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the tiles, doors, partition walls and  sanitary\r\n\r\nfixtures.   For  example, HDB implemented an  improvement\r\n\r\nprogramme for tiling works this year.  Training workshops\r\n\r\nwere  held for contractors' supervisors and handbooks  on\r\n\r\ntiling    techniques   were   produced,   to    encourage\r\n\r\nimplementation of good practices.

Secondly, what\r\n\r\nhas the Ministry to say about the kind of quality control\r\n\r\nmechanism  that  is  in  place?   Because  it  is  rather\r\n\r\ndisturbing  to  note that when HDB new flat  owners  come\r\n\r\ninto   their   flat,   they   realise   that   there   is\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory  work done, and 20 out of every  100  flat\r\n\r\nowners  would be facing the same problem.  Can the Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary  please  clarify   the   quality\r\n\r\ncontrol  mechanism that is in place, and why is  it  that\r\n\r\nthe problem still occurs?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Dr\r\n\r\nMaliki might have misread the statistics I quoted.  There\r\n\r\nwere 200 instances of unsatisfactory workmanship reported\r\n\r\nwithin  the  defects  liability period  for  every  1,000\r\n\r\nflats.   In one flat, there may be two or three instances\r\n\r\nof  defects, eg, the flat owner may say these  tiles  are\r\n\r\nnot  polished, those tiles are not polished, so there are\r\n\r\ntwo  instances.   So, it is not 200 flats  out  of  1,000\r\n\r\nflats.   It  is  200  instances.  Some  flats  have  more\r\n\r\ncomplaints, some flats have less.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the number acceptable? It is in the nature of\r\n\r\nconstruction that some defects do occur after  completion\r\n\r\nof  the flats.

Because the problem with design-and-build  flats is that the flat owners will go  in  and\r\n\r\nexpect  everything has already been done, and  they  feel\r\n\r\nvery  disappointed  when they find a lot  of  defects  in\r\n\r\ntheir flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think\r\n\r\nmost of the flats in Woodlands that Dr Maliki referred to\r\n\r\nare of the premium type.  So, they are either design-and-build,  or  design  plus.  These  flats  come  with  full\r\n\r\nfinishings.   They  have completed kitchen,  as  well  as\r\n\r\ntiles.  Because the flats have more fixtures, there tends\r\n\r\nto  be a little bit more defects.  Compared, for example,\r\n\r\nto  a  plain  vanilla 4-room flat, there are  no  kitchen\r\n\r\nfixtures,  the  floors  are not tiled,  so  there  is  no\r\n\r\nquestion  of tile complaints because there are no  tiles.\r\n\r\nSo,  there  are  slightly  more defects  than  the  plain\r\n\r\nvanilla  standard type of flats.  In fact,  instances  of\r\n\r\ndefects  in Woodlands new town are lower than the  global\r\n\r\naverage across all towns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>GAS PIPE TESTING IN BUKIT MERAH AREA</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nTrade and Industry (a) why was combustible works such  as\r\n\r\ngas pipe testing in the Bukit Merah area carried out from\r\n\r\n6  to  7 pm, when human traffic could be high and (b)  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bukit Merah case, where work was carried out near  a\r\n\r\nlibrary  and  a  petrol station, why  was  the  area  not\r\n\r\ncordoned off.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Dr Chong for his\r\n\r\nquestion.  I share his concerns and it gives\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nus an opportunity to give some perspective on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was it done in the first place? The reason is\r\n\r\nthat  parts  of the existing network of gas pipelines  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  ageing.   It is more  cost  effective  to\r\n\r\nrehabilitate  the pipelines rather than to  replace  them\r\n\r\nwith  new ones. This will also avoid public inconvenience\r\n\r\nas our pipelines are laid under public roads.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now pipeline rehabilitation is an established\r\n\r\npractice  in the gas industry world-wide since  the  mid-1970s,  and  the  technology has been  refined  over  the\r\n\r\nyears.  This technology is used in Japan, Europe and  the\r\n\r\nUSA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was it done when human traffic could be high?\r\n\r\nPowerGas  had  carried  out  high-pressure  tests   using\r\n\r\ncompressed air on parts of the rehabilitated pipeline  at\r\n\r\nJalan  Bukit  Merah  to check for their  integrity.   The\r\n\r\ninternational  code of practice is for this  test  to  be\r\n\r\ndone  over a duration of 32 hours.  Pressure is gradually\r\n\r\nincreased  over 8 hours and then held at the  final  test\r\n\r\npressure   for   24  hours  before  being  brought   down\r\n\r\ngradually.   As the test had to be done over an  extended\r\n\r\nperiod,  PowerGas was not able to avoid having  the  test\r\n\r\ndone  during the 6.00 pm  to 7.00 pm period when  traffic\r\n\r\nwas high.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what next? PowerGas had submitted its\r\n\r\ninvestigation  report  to the  EMA.   EMA  has  formed  a\r\n\r\ncommittee  of  experts from the LTA and MOM  to  consider\r\n\r\nPowerGas'  report  and  recommend  measures  to   prevent\r\n\r\nsimilar  occurrences in the future.  The  Committee  will\r\n\r\nalso review the adequacy of current safety measures, such\r\n\r\nas  advance  notification to the public,  the  extent  of\r\n\r\npublic cordon area, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although PowerGas had cordoned off the most\r\n\r\nvulnerable  parts  of  the  rehabilitated  pipeline,  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  will  be investigating why  PowerGas  had  not\r\n\r\ncordoned off the entire area where the tests were carried\r\n\r\nout.  The Committee targets its findings to be ready  end\r\n\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pipeline was not connected to the gas\r\n\r\ndistribution system.  So it was not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncombustible as the question suggested.  Hence, there  was\r\n\r\nno   combustible  gas  in  the  pipeline  and  there  was\r\n\r\ntherefore  no danger of any gas leakage, or any  risk  of\r\n\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, PowerGas will stop all high\r\n\r\npressure testing until we know what went wrong,  and  how\r\n\r\nto prevent recurrences and enhance safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SELECTIVE EN-BLOC REDEVELOPMENT SCHEME</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational Development, in view of the glut in the property\r\n\r\nmarket  whether (i) he will consider having a  moratorium\r\n\r\non the Selective En-bloc Redevelopment Scheme and, if so,\r\n\r\n(ii) for how many years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Selective En-bloc\r\n\r\nRedevelopment  Scheme (SERS) is part of the  Government's\r\n\r\nestate  renewal  plans for old HDB estates.   It  enables\r\n\r\noptimisation of land use, while enabling Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  to  new and better housing.  Existing  community\r\n\r\nties  are  also  preserved.  Through  redevelopment,  old\r\n\r\nestates  are rejuvenated.  Thus, SERS benefits  both  the\r\n\r\nnation and the residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identification of suitable precincts for SERS is an\r\n\r\non-going process.  It takes into account several factors,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  potential  for  redevelopment   and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  budgetary position.   The  Government  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to progressively announce precincts for SERS  if\r\n\r\nsuitable  ones  can  be identified.  It  generally  takes\r\n\r\nabout 4-5 years after announcement for a SERS site to  be\r\n\r\nready  for new development.  Thus, the selection  of  new\r\n\r\nSERS sites now should not have an immediate impact on the\r\n\r\nproperty market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I understand that 4-storey\r\n\r\nwalk-up  flats are also involved in this SERS  programme.\r\n\r\nIf these\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwalk-up   flats  are  pulled  down,  naturally  high-rise\r\n\r\nbuildings would be put up in their place.

There is a cycle  in  the  market.\r\n\r\nEventually, the glut will be taken up, and there will  be\r\n\r\na  new status quo in the market.  So, it is not something\r\n\r\nthat  is permanent.  If there is a permanent glut in  the\r\n\r\nmarket, then I think we would all be in serious trouble.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SERS programme is a very long-term programme.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  have  announced for SERS now, the redevelopment\r\n\r\nwould  only take place, say, five years at the  earliest.\r\n\r\nBy  that  time,  hopefully,  the  glut  would  have  been\r\n\r\nremoved.  I do not think the Member should have any cause\r\n\r\nfor  concern over that aspect.  Yes, it is true that when\r\n\r\nwe  do  SERS, we are going to increase the potential  for\r\n\r\nredevelopment, ie, we tear down a 4-storey block, or even\r\n\r\na  11-storey block for that matter, and we are  going  to\r\n\r\nbuild  something which will be much more intensive.   And\r\n\r\nthat  is one of the rationales for SERS.  That is  indeed\r\n\r\nwhat  we  are  hoping to do.  Because, in the  long  run,\r\n\r\nSingapore is short of land and we have to make sure  that\r\n\r\nwe maximise every piece of land that we have.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, in view of the many\r\n\r\nproperties in the market that are left unsold,  would  it\r\n\r\nbe  more  rational  not to add more new  flats  into  the\r\n\r\nmarket?  Probably, the Government can make sure that SERS\r\n\r\nprogrammes  are carried out rationally so as not  to  add\r\n\r\nmore property into the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I think there are two matters. One\r\n\r\nis  the fluctuation in the property market.  There  is  a\r\n\r\nglut  at  the  moment.   A few years  ago,  there  was  a\r\n\r\nshortage.   So  this  is  a natural  fluctuation  of  the\r\n\r\nproperty market.  Then there is the other matter which is\r\n\r\nSERS, which is a very long-term programme.  We will do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSERS   as   and   when  we  find  suitable  redevelopment\r\n\r\nopportunities.

So, whether\r\n\r\nwe decide to build or not is a separate matter from SERS.\r\n\r\nBut   the   idea  of  SERS  is  to  free  up   land   for\r\n\r\nredevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Since we have time and Mr Steve Chia\r\n\r\nhas  raised  Question  No.  3,  would  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation give his reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>GOVERNMENT-AIDED SCHOOLS, SAP SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Foreign students)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation  (a)  what  is the number of  foreign  students\r\n\r\nstudying   in  Government  aided  and  SAP  schools   and\r\n\r\nuniversities;  (b)  how  many of these  students  are  on\r\n\r\nSingapore  scholarships;  (c)  why  are  some  of   these\r\n\r\nstudents paid allowances as high as S$1,700 per month  to\r\n\r\nstudy   here  at  the  expense  of  our  own  Singaporean\r\n\r\nchildren;  and  (d)  is  there any particular  Government\r\n\r\naided  or  SAP school where the foreign out number  local\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my apologies for having arrived a little\r\n\r\nlate this afternoon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Steve Chia's question with regard to foreign\r\n\r\nstudents,  out  of the 220,000 students in our  secondary\r\n\r\nschools and Junior Colleges, 11,500 are foreign students.\r\n\r\nThat  is  about 5%.

There is no school or Junior College\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere  foreign students outnumber local students or  come\r\n\r\nanywhere  close  to  doing so.  Local  students  are  not\r\n\r\ndisplaced by foreign students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scholarship for a foreign student comprises\r\n\r\nschool  fees or tuition fees, accommodation and a monthly\r\n\r\nallowance  of  $200  for  a secondary  school  or  Junior\r\n\r\nCollege student, or $500 for a university student.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talented foreign students add value to our schools\r\n\r\nand  our  students.  Through their interaction  with  our\r\n\r\nstudents, they provide a spur for our students and  allow\r\n\r\nfor  a more diverse school community.  When they stay  on\r\n\r\nto contribute in Singapore after their studies, they help\r\n\r\nto  contribute  to  our economy so that all  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nbenefit.   Even if they decide to return home eventually,\r\n\r\nwe  would  have  a network of Singapore-educated  friends\r\n\r\nabroad.  This fraternity is a useful asset.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, have any local\r\n\r\nstudents been edged out by these foreign students?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, the short answer is\r\n\r\nno.   If  we  look at the schools, we have  expanded  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  places.  We have provided for more autonomous\r\n\r\nschools, besides the independent schools, over time.  All\r\n\r\nour  schools are good schools, of course.  But if we take\r\n\r\nthose at the top end of the academic spectrum, there  are\r\n\r\nnow  many  more schools providing an excellent  education\r\n\r\nand places for local students.  So, there is no trade-off\r\n\r\nbetween the number of foreign students we take in and the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  local  students able to  get  into  the  best\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, if we look at the universities and\r\n\r\npolytechnics,  we have greatly increased  the  number  of\r\n\r\nplaces  over the years for local students.

All teachers\r\n\r\nare  in the first tier in dealing with students who  need\r\n\r\ncounselling  and advice.  They are all given training  in\r\n\r\nBasic Counselling Skills.  Pupils who need a higher level\r\n\r\nof  help are referred to Teacher Counsellors.  There  are\r\n\r\ntwo  in  each  school.   These  Teacher  Counsellors  are\r\n\r\ntrained   in   more  advanced  counselling   and   crisis\r\n\r\nintervention skills.  Pupils requiring further assistance\r\n\r\nare  referred  to educational psychologists and  guidance\r\n\r\nspecialists  at  the  MOE,  ie,  the  Psychological   and\r\n\r\nGuidance  Services Branch of the MOE.  We have  about  40\r\n\r\nsuch  specialists,  all  with post-graduate  training  in\r\n\r\neither education psychology or guidance and counselling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools are also provided with funds to engage part-time counselling services, and indeed this is quite\r\n\r\nprevalent.  To further augment the counselling  resources\r\n\r\nof  schools  and  school clusters, the School  Counsellor\r\n\r\nScheme   was  introduced  last  year.   We  have  trained\r\n\r\nsuitable retired education officers under the scheme,  so\r\n\r\nthat  schools  can tap on them as additional  counselling\r\n\r\nsupport.   By July this year, 30 school counsellors  will\r\n\r\nbe  deployed to our schools or school clusters to provide\r\n\r\nfurther  counselling support.  MOE is prepared  to  train\r\n\r\nmore  of such counsellors if schools need their services.\r\n\r\nMore  broadly, schools work with Family Service  Centres,\r\n\r\nVWOs  and  the  self-help groups.  Taken in totality,  we\r\n\r\nhave a comprehensive network of support, and the Ministry\r\n\r\nand  schools will be quite happy to work with the various\r\n\r\nagencies to improve our use of this network of support.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our universities, polytechnics and ITE run their own\r\n\r\ncounselling services to meet the needs of their students.\r\n\r\nQualified   professional   counsellors   offer   personal\r\n\r\nguidance and counselling supported by a network of  para-counsellors  drawn from among the academic  staff.

These increases, already operative since 1st\r\n\r\nJuly,  are as follows: adult bus fares and adult  MRT/LRT\r\n\r\nfares  by  3 cents and 4 cents respectively for commuters\r\n\r\nusing ez-link cards.  For those using magnetic fare cards\r\n\r\nand  those paying cash, the increases went up by 5  cents\r\n\r\nand   10  cents  respectively.   There  were  also  other\r\n\r\nincreases affecting students, NSmen and senior citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the announcement of the increases, there has\r\n\r\nbeen a huge public\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noutcry  over  these increases.  Many have questioned  the\r\n\r\nexplanations  put  forward  by  the  PTC  and   the   two\r\n\r\noperators,  SBS  Transit and SMRT Corporation,  and  many\r\n\r\nmore question the timing of these increases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several Members had submitted Questions for\r\n\r\nOral Answers on this issue, but I felt that merely asking\r\n\r\nquestions  would  not do justice to  the  groundswell  of\r\n\r\ndiscontentment, and we would just get a  reply  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Transport.   We  will  probably  ask  some\r\n\r\nsupplementary questions, get some answers, but  with  the\r\n\r\nlimited time available for questions, at the end  of  it,\r\n\r\nwe  will  all go home less than satisfied.  And we  would\r\n\r\nhave  failed  to articulate many of the concerns  on  the\r\n\r\nground, and the House would not have been able to take  a\r\n\r\nposition  on the issues.  I, therefore, decided to  table\r\n\r\nthis motion and got the support of five of my colleagues,\r\n\r\nthe  maximum allowed under Standing Orders, but I am glad\r\n\r\nto  see  that  we  have a long list of  Members  who  are\r\n\r\nwaiting to speak on this subject.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what are the issues that face us in debating\r\n\r\nthis  motion?   Let me start by explaining the  different\r\n\r\nparts of the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in the midst of the worst recession since\r\n\r\nindependence  37 years ago.  There are no  signs  on  the\r\n\r\nhorizon that there is going to be an economic recovery in\r\n\r\nthe near future.  Yes, we may get promising statistics in\r\n\r\none  month  for our manufacturing sector or for  exports.\r\n\r\nBut  in  another month, these figures can come down.   So\r\n\r\nthere  is no definite trend that the outlook will improve\r\n\r\nvery   soon.   It  is  still  early  days  to  draw   any\r\n\r\nconclusion.  Unemployment has exceeded 100,000  and  most\r\n\r\nwho have lost their jobs cannot find any work at all.  In\r\n\r\nsome cases, there are many who want to work for less  pay\r\n\r\nbut  the  jobs  are just not there.  Even  the  gainfully\r\n\r\nemployed  have difficulties making ends meet,  what  more\r\n\r\nthe unemployed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The announcement by the PTC of the fare increases\r\n\r\ntherefore came as a rude shock to Singaporeans,  as  they\r\n\r\nfelt that it could not have come at a worse time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister had  told\r\n\r\nthe  House in May, when making his Budget statement, that\r\n\r\nthe  PTC had decided that there would be no need to raise\r\n\r\nfares  next  year  as a result of the  increase  in  GST.\r\n\r\nLittle  did  we  know  that what the  PTC  meant  was  no\r\n\r\nincrease next year did not mean no increase this year!  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know if you would call this twisted or  sardonic\r\n\r\nhumour, but I think it is, almost for sure, not funny  at\r\n\r\nall to Singaporeans.  How sure are we that, next year, we\r\n\r\nwill  not  be told again by the PTC that never  mind  the\r\n\r\nincrease in GST, but operating and maintenance costs have\r\n\r\ngone  up  again  and therefore we have  to  have  another\r\n\r\nincrease in fares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has come out to question the\r\n\r\ntiming of the increases.  On 17th June, he was quoted  in\r\n\r\nthe  press as having said that this is not the best  time\r\n\r\nto  put  up  the increases, and I think the House  should\r\n\r\nendorse what he had said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House must therefore solicit some definitive\r\n\r\nresponse  from the Government at the end of this  debate.\r\n\r\nI  have asked that the PTC review its decision and I will\r\n\r\nelaborate further on this later.  We need to know how the\r\n\r\nPTC  arrives  at  its decision, whether the  reasons  put\r\n\r\nforth  by  the transport companies for the increases  are\r\n\r\njustifiable, and we need to know how the PTC  intends  to\r\n\r\nact  with  regard to future requests for fare  increases.\r\n\r\nWe  need to know if the PTC will not just respond to  the\r\n\r\nrequests  of  the  transport companies,  but  whether  it\r\n\r\nintends   to   respond   also  to   prevailing   economic\r\n\r\ncircumstances and to the needs of the commuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate is not just about bus and MRT fares. It\r\n\r\nalso  has to do with the slew of increases in charges  of\r\n\r\nother public services that have taken place, or are about\r\n\r\nto  take  place.  Sir, I believe that this  is  the  main\r\n\r\ncause  of discontent on the ground.  Consider this:   GST\r\n\r\nup,  ERP  up,  petrol up, car park charges up,  telephone\r\n\r\ncharges  soon  to be up, and, of course, unemployment  is\r\n\r\nup, retrenchment is up.  Morale is upside down, and so is\r\n\r\nour  pay,  it is down.  People are not only fed up,  they\r\n\r\nare  frightened about their future.  As a  cartoon  in  a\r\n\r\nlocal newspaper puts it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngraphically,  all these price increases,  to  parody  the\r\n\r\ntitle of a movie that was just shown, add up to \"The  Sum\r\n\r\nof  All  Fears\"  for Singaporeans.  The public  transport\r\n\r\nfare increase has become the single issue on which to peg\r\n\r\nall  other frustrations, and some of these may  not  even\r\n\r\nhave to do with price increases.  This issue has become a\r\n\r\nlightning rod.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was therefore appalled by the response of the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Transport when he was asked by  the  press\r\n\r\nwhat  he thought of the price increases.  He said, \"While\r\n\r\nunemployment has gone up, 95% of Singaporeans  are  still\r\n\r\nworking.\"  Well, really!  Sir, he is telling us  what  is\r\n\r\nthe big deal, only 5% are not working, so what is all the\r\n\r\nfuss about.  Well, let me tell him that 5% unemployed  is\r\n\r\njust  5% too much.  Will we next be telling these  5%  of\r\n\r\nthe  population that if they cannot have  food  on  their\r\n\r\ntable,  it  is  all right because the other  95%  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation can feed themselves?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans have already lost their jobs, and\r\n\r\nmany  more  have  taken pay cuts.  So, let  us  not  make\r\n\r\ncallous remarks to dampen morale even further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also refuted the allegation that\r\n\r\nthe  transport companies are profiteering from the  price\r\n\r\nincreases.  He said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"They must have a rate of return that is reasonable\r\n\r\nand  which is not excessive.  You cannot control them  to\r\n\r\nthe extent that they lose money.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both transport operators have cited increased\r\n\r\ncosts,  such  as wages, the increases in CPF contribution\r\n\r\nfrom  12% to 16% since January last year, and investments\r\n\r\nin  service improvements, as reasons for asking  for  the\r\n\r\nincreases in fares.  The PTC has said that it wants  them\r\n\r\nto remain financially viable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, there was a time when CPF contributions\r\n\r\nwere  reduced  from 20% to 12%, but I do not  recall  the\r\n\r\ntransport companies reducing their fares.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question of wage increases, which they have\r\n\r\nused as a reason, perplexes me.  Today, in Singapore, the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the trade unions and the employers  are  all\r\n\r\ncalling  for wage restraint.  Wages are frozen.   Bonuses\r\n\r\nare  lowered.  You are lucky if your wages have not  been\r\n\r\ncut.   So,  what  is  this  wage increase  that  the  two\r\n\r\ncompanies are talking about?  Is it to get more staff  to\r\n\r\nprovide for new operations and new routes?  Would the new\r\n\r\nrevenue from new routes not cover the wages of additional\r\n\r\nstaff?   Or  are  they  telling us  that  the  staff  has\r\n\r\nactually got wage increases?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have here a report in today's Straits Times\r\n\r\nheadlined  \"Slashing of staff and fuel  costs  helps  SIA\r\n\r\nstay in the black.\"  It says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The national carrier cut staff costs by some 14.5%\r\n\r\nor $188 million to a total figure of $1.13 billion [a cut\r\n\r\nof 14.5%].  This was despite a larger staff strength with\r\n\r\nthe company employing 3.9% or 539 more staff .\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, how is it that SIA can rein in its staff costs\r\n\r\nand  enjoy savings in its wage bill even though it had  a\r\n\r\nlarger  staff  strength?   It  too  had  to  face  larger\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  the  employees'  CPF.   The  answer  is\r\n\r\nsimple.   Singapore  Airlines is in a  business  that  is\r\n\r\nhighly  competitive.   Not  only  that,  last  year,   as\r\n\r\neveryone  knows  was  the  most difficult  year  for  the\r\n\r\nairlines  business,  especially after  the  September  11\r\n\r\nattacks.  SIA was confronted with the first possible loss\r\n\r\nin  its history.  It did what many sensible businesses in\r\n\r\nsuch  times do to stay alive.  It imposed wage cuts  from\r\n\r\n2.5%  to 15%.   When passenger load factors fell, did  it\r\n\r\nincrease  ticket  prices  to make  up  for  the  loss  in\r\n\r\nrevenue?   As  many Singaporeans happily found  out,  SIA\r\n\r\nslashed prices so that it could keep its planes flying.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there we have it. Three companies are operating\r\n\r\nin the broader transport sector.  One proves itself to be\r\n\r\nhighly  cost-efficient, overcoming all odds  to  turn  in\r\n\r\nanother profitable year in a highly competitive industry.\r\n\r\nTwo  other  companies in a highly protective environment,\r\n\r\nperpetually  grousing about higher  costs  and  demanding\r\n\r\nmore from its customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBS Transit also says that its ridership fell by 3%\r\n\r\nlast year and in the first four\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonths  of this year, it fell another 2.8%.  I  now  have\r\n\r\none  question to ask.  According to the Chairman  of  SBS\r\n\r\nTransit in his year 2001 Annual Report, TIBS took over 17\r\n\r\nSBS services and this transfer of the 17 services to TIBS\r\n\r\nhad  an impact of $13.9 million on the bottom line of SBS\r\n\r\nTransit.   It  was SBS who chose to lose this  source  of\r\n\r\nincome  by  giving  up  the routes.   It  therefore  lost\r\n\r\nridership   because  it  gave  up  the  routes   to   its\r\n\r\ncompetitor.  Is it justifiable to use this as  an  excuse\r\n\r\nto make up for its loss in revenue and make the customers\r\n\r\npay more?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they tell me that this is not the reason but\r\n\r\nthat there are just simply less people taking their buses\r\n\r\nthese  days,  then let me say that what SBS is  doing  to\r\n\r\novercome  the  situation  is  certainly  very  unorthodox\r\n\r\nbusiness practice.  Any businessman will tell you that if\r\n\r\nyou  find your customers running away, the last thing you\r\n\r\ndo  is  to  increase  the  prices  of  your  products  or\r\n\r\nservices.   What you do is to hold on to your prices,  or\r\n\r\nyou   reduce   prices,  you  give  discounts,   you   run\r\n\r\npromotions,  take  a  cut in your margins  and  keep  the\r\n\r\ngoodwill of your customers during the bad times, and  not\r\n\r\nfrighten  them away with even higher prices so that  they\r\n\r\nwill run into the arms of your competitors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But our two transport operators can do this because\r\n\r\nthere  is  no competitive environment in their  business.\r\n\r\nThe  two companies do not compete with one another on the\r\n\r\nsame  routes,  so that is why, even during  a  recession,\r\n\r\nthey  can  put  up prices with such impunity.   There  is\r\n\r\nsimply  no  incentive for them to find ways to do  things\r\n\r\nbetter and more economically to keep the loyalty of their\r\n\r\ncustomers.  It is a question of take it or leave it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me illustrate this point further. I have\r\n\r\nhere  a news report from the South China Morning Post  of\r\n\r\nHong  Kong  dated Friday, 5th July.  The  headline  reads\r\n\r\n\"MTR  [that  is  the mass transit rail]  extension  fares\r\n\r\nundercut buses\".  It says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Hong Kong MTR announced that its fares will be up\r\n\r\nto  23% cheaper than travelling by bus when a new service\r\n\r\nstarts on 18th August.  Fares on the rail will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  fall  between 2.9% and 22% lower than on comparable\r\n\r\nbus  routes  operated by three other bus  companies.   In\r\n\r\naddition  to  the  lower fares, MTR  will  also  grant  a\r\n\r\npromotional  discount  of  $2  for  Octopus  card   users\r\n\r\n[Octopus  card is their equivalent of our fare card]  for\r\n\r\ntwo weeks after the new service commences.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the report then goes on to say:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The announcement prompted some bus operators to\r\n\r\nconsider  cutting fares to remain competitive.   A  First\r\n\r\nBus   Company   [this  is  one  of  the  bus   companies]\r\n\r\nspokeswoman said the company welcomed competition.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A Kowloon Motor Bus Company added it may review\r\n\r\nroutes and fares. .\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  report  adds that the bus companies would  consider\r\n\r\nrearranging their routes and reduce the number  of  stops\r\n\r\nto  cut  their fares.  An MTR official then responded  by\r\n\r\nsaying  that  the MTR fares \"were set in accordance  with\r\n\r\naffordability,    market   competition    and    economic\r\n\r\nconditions.  We don't take into account bus company fares\r\n\r\nbut we would like to pledge value for money .\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think they did take into account the bus fares.\r\n\r\nThat  is why the MTR lowered their fares.  But note  what\r\n\r\nthe  MTR  spokesman said, he used the words,  \"value  for\r\n\r\nmoney.\"  That is the basis of competition.  You add value\r\n\r\nto every dollar your customer pays so that you can retain\r\n\r\ntheir loyalty.  In the Hong Kong MTR, they have just, not\r\n\r\ntoo  long ago, added glass doors at their stations,  like\r\n\r\nwhat we have in our MRT system, and these doors open only\r\n\r\nwhen  the  trains arrive.  It is a safety feature.   They\r\n\r\nhave  also  added, not too long ago, display  signs  that\r\n\r\ntell  you  when such and such a train will  arrive.   But\r\n\r\nthey  did not pass on all these costs to commuters.  That\r\n\r\nis value for money.  That is part of the service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, in Singapore, any slightest service improvement\r\n\r\nbecomes a frill, or is a frill that no one asked for, and\r\n\r\nthey  will  ram the costs down your throats:  TV  Mobile,\r\n\r\nplasma  information screens, piped-in  radio  programmes,\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMRT has justified the higher operating costs by\r\n\r\npointing to examples, such as its new information  system\r\n\r\nand even things like adding more benches for us to sit\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndown  at station platforms.  Another reason it has  given\r\n\r\nis  that  it will incur another $4 million in expenditure\r\n\r\nto  run the new service to Changi Airport.  Well, are you\r\n\r\nnot  supposed to collect revenue from a new service  that\r\n\r\nwill  cover your operating costs?  I remember  that,  for\r\n\r\nyears  in  this House, Members were clamouring  for  this\r\n\r\nservice  to Changi Airport, and we were always told  that\r\n\r\nit  could  not be done because there was just not  enough\r\n\r\npassenger  traffic.   But we were finally  told  that  we\r\n\r\ncould have it as the service was found to be viable.   So\r\n\r\nwhat  is  this passing of an additional cost to  run  the\r\n\r\nline to Changi to commuters?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at what they do in Hong Kong. They run a new\r\n\r\nline, but they do not tell commuters that it is going  to\r\n\r\ncost them more money to run the service, and so they have\r\n\r\ngot  to  raise  fares throughout the whole island.   They\r\n\r\nreduce prices for the new line in order to compete.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I heard that the buses are also to be linked to\r\n\r\na  Global Positioning System so that fare stages will  be\r\n\r\nautomatically updated instead of being done  manually  as\r\n\r\nthey  are  being  done  now, and costly  panels  will  be\r\n\r\nprovided  at bus stops and LRT stations to provide  real-time  information.   How much will  these  cost?   Do  we\r\n\r\nreally  need  them?  Do these add value to customers?   I\r\n\r\nthink  the  management of these companies should  realise\r\n\r\nthat  all  commuters want is to get  from  one  point  to\r\n\r\nanother  without all these frills that they will have  to\r\n\r\npay for ultimately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not everybody wants to travel first class. For\r\n\r\nthe  majority, all they want is a no-frills economy class\r\n\r\ntrip.   What is the point of spending all that  money  on\r\n\r\nthings that your customers do not seem to appreciate  and\r\n\r\nyou tell them that they have to pay for it?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about retaining customer loyalty? Not too long\r\n\r\nago,  Hong Kong MTR gave a rebate to its passengers.   If\r\n\r\nthey  used  their farecard 10 times within a  week,  they\r\n\r\ngave  the commuters a rebate.  Until last week, they  ran\r\n\r\nanother promotion.  Use their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfarecards  10 times in a week and they get a  free  lunch\r\n\r\nvoucher  with  Tai Ka Lok, a fast-food chain,  and,  this\r\n\r\nweek,  it is even better: use the same card for 10  times\r\n\r\nwithin a week and they get a voucher for dinner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, how is that for competition? Hong Kong MTR\r\n\r\ndoes  not  need to hide behind the skirts of  any  public\r\n\r\ntransport authority to tell them how to stay alive.  They\r\n\r\nknow  what to do.  Many of us who have been to Hong  Kong\r\n\r\nand travelled on their buses and their MTR know that they\r\n\r\ndo not boast of a world-class transport system - not that\r\n\r\nours  is  anyway  -  but  they  have  a  system  that  is\r\n\r\nefficient, reliable and at reasonable prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is the situation here? If we recall, last\r\n\r\nJuly, SBS and TIBS feeder fares went up by 10 cents.  The\r\n\r\nSingapore  School and Private Hire Bus Owners Association\r\n\r\nsought  the  PTC's permission to run feeder services,  as\r\n\r\nthe  Association felt that it could provide  lower  fares\r\n\r\nthan  SBS  and TIBS.  What was the response of  the  PTC?\r\n\r\nInstead  of  allowing the competition, which  would  have\r\n\r\nmeant  lower  prices for everyone, the PTC  rejected  the\r\n\r\napplication  on  the grounds that the  private  operators\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  able  to provide \"a seamless,  integrated\r\n\r\ntransport  system  that  gives  maximum  convenience   to\r\n\r\ncommuters.\"  These are the PTC's own words, \"a  seamless,\r\n\r\nintegrated   transport   system   that   gives    maximum\r\n\r\nconvenience to commuters.\"  In other words, in  order  to\r\n\r\ncompete  with SBS and TIBS, the private bus owners  would\r\n\r\nhave  to provide for a fare card system which, of course,\r\n\r\nis  a  non-starter for them, considering the large amount\r\n\r\nof  investments in technology for a fare card system.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  such  an  investment  would  cost  them\r\n\r\nmillions of dollars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the PTC, the word \"seamless\" means only a fare\r\n\r\ncard  payment  system  when you travel  by  the  two  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies and by rail.  But, to the customers, \"seamless\"\r\n\r\nmeans  getting to point A and point B, and maybe to point\r\n\r\nC,  and he does not care if it is an SBS or TIBS bus that\r\n\r\ncomes  along,  as long as the bus gets him  to  where  he\r\n\r\nwants on time and at a low price.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  would  have  gained,  but  competition  was\r\n\r\nnipped in the bud by the PTC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PTC said further that the private bus operators\r\n\r\ncould  not pick only the profitable routes, as this  went\r\n\r\nagainst the principle of balanced coverage which SBS  and\r\n\r\nTIBS had to observe.  In other words, they cannot cherry-pick  their  routes.  It claimed that it wanted  a  level\r\n\r\nplaying field.  Yet, it forgot that the playing field was\r\n\r\nalready  not level when it allowed SBS and TIBS to  offer\r\n\r\ncharter bus services, which had all along been the domain\r\n\r\nof  the private bus operators.  The private bus operators\r\n\r\nwere  also  trying  to make up for under-provided  feeder\r\n\r\nroutes  at  that time in the new towns like  Punggol  and\r\n\r\nSengkang,  which  were just not well served  by  the  big\r\n\r\nboys.   But,  I  suppose, this did not  figure  in  PTC's\r\n\r\nreasoning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the PTC calls it levelling the playing field. I\r\n\r\nthink it was just plain keeping out the competition  and,\r\n\r\nin the end, it was the common man who lost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the viability of the two big companies?\r\n\r\nThe  Minister also says let us not wait till they go bust\r\n\r\nbefore  we increase prices, and that they have to make  a\r\n\r\ncertain  amount of profits on their assets to  make  them\r\n\r\nviable.   He  says  that if they do not  get  their  fare\r\n\r\nincreases,  they are going to make losses and they  would\r\n\r\nnot be viable.  Sir, does he not know that in a recession\r\n\r\nalmost every business is just making less today?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a look at how profitable or unprofitable\r\n\r\nSBS  Transit  and  SMRT are.  SBS Transit  made  profits,\r\n\r\nafter  tax, of $21 million in 1997, $35 million in  1998,\r\n\r\n$42 million in 1999, $51 million in 2000, and $39 million\r\n\r\nin 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, profit figures do not tell the whole picture,\r\n\r\nbut  let us look at their return on equity, which is  the\r\n\r\npaid-up  capital and reserves combined.  For SBS Transit,\r\n\r\nreturn on equity: 24.4% in 1997, 30.6% in 1998, 28.3%  in\r\n\r\n1999, 24.7% in 2000, and 17.9% in 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the shareholders of SBS Transit, it must be a\r\n\r\ngood investment.  Each SBS\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshare   has  a  par  value  of  25  cents.   Last   year,\r\n\r\nshareholders were rewarded with a dividend return of 34%,\r\n\r\nin  spite of the dip in profits.  In the previous  years,\r\n\r\nthey  got  between  12%  and  49%.   In  fact,  in  1997,\r\n\r\nshareholders received a very nice 36 cents for  each  25-cent share that they owned.  Total payout to shareholders\r\n\r\nin   the  last  two  years:  $27  million  was  given  to\r\n\r\nshareholders in 2000 and, in 2001, shareholders  received\r\n\r\na total of $19 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now look at SMRT. SMRT is a little\r\n\r\ncomplicated.   It  was Singapore MRT  Ltd,  and  then  it\r\n\r\nbecame  SMRT Corporation when it was listed as  a  public\r\n\r\ncompany in July 2000.  So, I will just take it from  that\r\n\r\nyear.  In the reporting period before it was listed, SMRT\r\n\r\nCorporation  made  a  profit of $180  million.   For  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  year  ending 31st March 2001, it  earned  $102\r\n\r\nmillion  and,  for the year ending 31st March  2002,  ie,\r\n\r\njust  ended not too long ago, it earned $56 million,  all\r\n\r\nat  the group level.  Return on equity:  26% in 2001 and,\r\n\r\nfor last year, 14%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a look at SMRT Corporation's dividend\r\n\r\npayout.   Each  SMRT share has a par value of  10  cents.\r\n\r\nFor  the  year  ended 31st March 2001, it declared  three\r\n\r\ndividend  payments amounting in total to a dividend  rate\r\n\r\nof  46%.   For  its  latest reported year,  the  dividend\r\n\r\npayout  rate was 28%.  Total amount of money paid out  to\r\n\r\nshareholders:  $52 million in 2001, and  $32  million  in\r\n\r\n2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both SBS Transit and SMRT Corporation have policies\r\n\r\nof   paying   half   their  yearly   profits   to   their\r\n\r\nshareholders.   Members might recall that in  1978,  when\r\n\r\nSBS   was  listed,  the  Government  actually  guaranteed\r\n\r\nshareholders a dividend rate of 71/2%, because it was the\r\n\r\nfirst  time  the Government was allowing the use  of  CPF\r\n\r\nfunds to members of the public to buy shares of companies\r\n\r\nlisted  on  the Stock Exchange, and it wanted to  provide\r\n\r\nthis  form of assurance and to encourage members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  to  invest in SBS.  In 1993, this  guarantee  was\r\n\r\nwithdrawn as SBS had in fact been paying more than  71/2%\r\n\r\nand, as we have seen, with the type of dividends that  it\r\n\r\nhas  been  paying  in the past few years,  the  guarantee\r\n\r\nwould have been superfluous.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The return on equity of both SBS Transit and SMRT\r\n\r\nCorporation  exceeds the ROEs of many other companies  in\r\n\r\nthe  broad  transport sector of companies listed  on  the\r\n\r\nStock Exchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there you have it, two highly profitable\r\n\r\ncompanies   making   very   good   returns   for    their\r\n\r\nshareholders.  And do not forget that from next year  on,\r\n\r\nthey will pay less corporate tax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have nothing against shareholders\r\n\r\nreceiving   what  is  rightly  due  to  them  for   their\r\n\r\ninvestments.   Do not get me wrong.  And the shareholders\r\n\r\nmust  be  happy  if we look at the share prices  of  both\r\n\r\ncompanies today.  They have always been quite consistent.\r\n\r\nBased  on their share prices, SBS Transit and SMRT  offer\r\n\r\nrespectable dividend yields of 5% and 4% respectively  to\r\n\r\ntheir shareholders.  And the market cannot be wrong about\r\n\r\nthe  profitability of these companies.  That is  why  the\r\n\r\nshare prices of these companies have remained strong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish I had bought shares in SBS Transit and\r\n\r\nSMRT instead of in SingTel, but that is another story for\r\n\r\nanother  day.  Maybe the Government should have given  us\r\n\r\nloyalty  shares  in these two companies  instead  and  we\r\n\r\nwould  not  be complaining so much, and we would  all  be\r\n\r\nshareholders of two very profitable companies and then we\r\n\r\ndo  not  mind paying 3 cents more because, at the end  of\r\n\r\nthe year, we will get such nice dividends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to tell us that these two companies are going to\r\n\r\nrun  into great financial straits if they do not increase\r\n\r\ntheir  fares now?  These are companies tottering  on  the\r\n\r\nedge  of  bankruptcy?  It is more like the case of  Money\r\n\r\nNot  Enough  for these two companies.  And to  use  scare\r\n\r\ntactics - if you do not give us this increase we would be\r\n\r\nin  trouble  -  and  try  to  wring  the  necks  of  poor\r\n\r\ncommuters,  I say each and every Singaporean should  rise\r\n\r\nand  tell  them,  \"Give us a better line  because  I  Not\r\n\r\nStupid.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It, therefore, brings me to the question of what is\r\n\r\nthe role of the PTC in all this.  How does it come to the\r\n\r\nconclusion  that  if  fares are not increased,  then  the\r\n\r\noperations would not be viable?  Is it, in fact, the duty\r\n\r\nof  the  PTC to ensure the profitability of the transport\r\n\r\noperators, or are they supposed to ensure that everyone - the bus companies, you and I - get a fair shake?  I think\r\n\r\nthe  PTC  must  remember that it should  not  become  the\r\n\r\napologist for the transport operators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the chief executives of SBS Transit, SMRT\r\n\r\nand  TIBS  doing on the PTC?  They would be  there  armed\r\n\r\nwith  facts and figures to support their arguments.   But\r\n\r\nshould  they  not be asked to appear before  the  PTC  to\r\n\r\nstate their case, instead of being part of the PTC?   How\r\n\r\ncan  the players in the game be the referees at the  same\r\n\r\ntime?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in my Motion, I have asked that the PTC\r\n\r\nreview these fare increases.  I could have used the words\r\n\r\n\"reverse  its  decision\", but I do not want to  undermine\r\n\r\nthe  work of the PTC because, in a lot of other areas,  I\r\n\r\ncan  say that the PTC does good work.  So, I do not  want\r\n\r\nto  adopt  a confrontational approach.  And I  chose  the\r\n\r\nword \"review\" to give it more leeway and allow it to come\r\n\r\nup   with  other  options.   Perhaps  it  could  be  some\r\n\r\ningenious  way, as the Hong Kong MTR has  gone  about  to\r\n\r\nkeep its commuters happy, or maybe the two companies, SBS\r\n\r\nand  SMRT, can think of something and consider  making  a\r\n\r\ngesture  to  Singaporeans in order to sweeten the  ground\r\n\r\nwhich  is, certainly, in a very sour mood now.   Why  can\r\n\r\nthe  two companies not show some compassion for those who\r\n\r\nhave  been  very badly hit by the economic  downturn?   I\r\n\r\nthink a reasonable gesture on the part of SBS Transit and\r\n\r\nSMRT  will go some way to alleviate some of the pain that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are going through.\r\n\r\nUltimately,    the   Government   has    an    overriding\r\n\r\nresponsibility  in  easing the pain of  its  citizens  in\r\n\r\ntimes  like  this.   It  is, after all,  through  Temasek\r\n\r\nHoldings,  the  main shareholder of SMRT and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthe largest beneficiary of the profits made by SMRT.  SBS\r\n\r\nTransit's  largest  shareholder  is  Delgro  Corporation,\r\n\r\nwhich owns\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n75%  of  shares in SBS Transit.  I do not know  who  owns\r\n\r\nDelgro.  All the large shareholdings are in the hands  of\r\n\r\nnominee  companies and investment funds. But I hope  that\r\n\r\nthe shareholders of Delgro will understand that when they\r\n\r\nare  in  a  privileged position to run  a  country's  bus\r\n\r\nservice  on  what is practically an exclusive basis  and,\r\n\r\non  top of that, they are going to get to run a rail line\r\n\r\nsoon, they have to realise that apart from ensuring  that\r\n\r\nthey  get  a fair return on their investments, they  also\r\n\r\nhave  a  social  obligation to ensure that  the  services\r\n\r\ntheir company provides remain affordable and that it does\r\n\r\nnot  cause undue burden to the people, and that in  times\r\n\r\nof great difficulty, that obligation becomes even more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, of course, the greatest obligation is on the\r\n\r\npart  of the Government which must ensure that all public\r\n\r\nservices  remain affordable.  If the Prime Minister  says\r\n\r\nthat  this  is  not  the  best time  to  increase  public\r\n\r\ntransport  fares, then it is also not the  best  time  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the prices of many other public services.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  National  Development  wants  to  increase\r\n\r\ncarpark  charges very soon, on the grounds that it  needs\r\n\r\nto  cover  the cost of building their carparks,  ie,  the\r\n\r\ncost  of building carparks has increased.  Sir, I pointed\r\n\r\nout  in the Committee of Supply that the cost of building\r\n\r\ncarparks  today,  as given by the Minister,  is  in  fact\r\n\r\ncheaper than the cost of building the carparks years ago.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister could not give me a satisfactory reply  and\r\n\r\nhe is now just proceeding ahead to raise carpark charges.\r\n\r\nThis  is  just one example of the Government going  ahead\r\n\r\nwith  a  price  increase, even though its  arguments  for\r\n\r\ndoing  so have been shown to be unsound.  There are  many\r\n\r\nother  examples, but I will leave these to my  colleagues\r\n\r\nto elaborate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, people are once again asking: is the\r\n\r\nGovernment  listening  or not?  People  are  angry  today\r\n\r\nbecause  they feel that there are just too many increases\r\n\r\nin  such a short space of time and, not only that, during\r\n\r\nthe  worst  of time.  There never will be a correct  time\r\n\r\nfor  any price increase, but they are asking why  it  has\r\n\r\ngot to be now, when they are out of jobs,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  when those with jobs are earning less, or are  unsure\r\n\r\nof whether they will still have their jobs tomorrow.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment asks us to tighten our belts, even earn  less,\r\n\r\ndo not be fussy if we earn less.  But how can they if the\r\n\r\nGovernment is putting up the prices of things  which  are\r\n\r\nessential to them?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I say, let us keep everything in check. We are\r\n\r\nnot   asking  for  hand-outs.  We  are  not  even  asking\r\n\r\nGovernment to subsidise the bus services.  But  when  you\r\n\r\nare  providing  essential public services,  do  strike  a\r\n\r\nbalance  between  making money and  making  the  services\r\n\r\naffordable.   When people are already suffering,  do  not\r\n\r\nadd more pain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has asked: should we be doing\r\n\r\nthe  right thing or should we be doing the popular thing?\r\n\r\nLet  me  answer by saying this.  Recently, private school\r\n\r\nbus  operators have been slapped with an increase in  the\r\n\r\ninsurance premiums on their vehicles of between 140-500%.\r\n\r\nThe  Singapore School Transport Association  has  advised\r\n\r\nits  members  not to raise fares for school children,  at\r\n\r\nleast  for  now.   The Association's  Chairman  has  been\r\n\r\nreported  as saying that raising fares now would  not  be\r\n\r\ndesirable.  I quote, \"The economy is bad, how to increase\r\n\r\nfares?\"  These are words from the small guys.  Does  this\r\n\r\nnot say it all?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the anger on the ground. Let me put it\r\n\r\nsquarely to the Government by relating an encounter  that\r\n\r\nI  had  with a perfect stranger just a few days ago.   He\r\n\r\nexpressed  his  anger and frustration at  all  the  price\r\n\r\nincreases to me in a very cool way.  He was not saying it\r\n\r\nvery loudly, but in a very calm way.  He told me that  he\r\n\r\nobserved  that  every  time after an  election,  the  PAP\r\n\r\nincreased prices and by the time the next election  came,\r\n\r\npeople would have forgotten and they would just vote  for\r\n\r\nthe  PAP again.  He then smiled at me and said, \"Mr  Tan,\r\n\r\njust  tell  your leaders, next time round, we  would  not\r\n\r\nforget.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  to  support the motion standing in the name  of  my\r\n\r\nParliamentary colleague, Mr Tan Soo Khoon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two parts to this motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Transport (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, I would like to raise a point of clarification based\r\n\r\non  what  Mr Tan Soo Khoon had said just now.  He  quoted\r\n\r\nDPM's  speech during the recent Budget debate,  and  gave\r\n\r\nthe  impression that PTC would not be approving  any  bus\r\n\r\nfare  increase this year.  Sir, far from it. DPM was,  in\r\n\r\nfact, very clear about this.  Let me quote what DPM said.\r\n\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Public Transport Council (PTC) is currently\r\n\r\nevaluating  proposals  from the  transport  operators  to\r\n\r\nrevise fares.

After\r\n\r\nconsidering their views, with the likely increase in  GST\r\n\r\nto  5% and the proposed cut in the corporate income  tax,\r\n\r\nthe  PTC has decided that there is no need to raise fares\r\n\r\nnext  year as a result of the GST increase. The transport\r\n\r\noperators have accepted this decision.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that Mr Tan would get his quotes\r\n\r\ncorrect.

That was what I\r\n\r\nsaid.   I  did say that if that was what was stated,  the\r\n\r\nPTC meant no increase next year, but what we did not know\r\n\r\nwas that there would be increases this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> This is precisely what I have\r\n\r\njust said. The DPM did not give any impression at all  to\r\n\r\nthe  House that there would be no increase this year.   I\r\n\r\nthink   Mr   Tan,   in   delivering  his   remarks,   has\r\n\r\ninadvertently or deliberately created the impression that\r\n\r\nthe  DPM had, in fact, misled the House. There is no such\r\n\r\nthing.

I shall respond to the second part\r\n\r\nfirst, because it is a call on the Government to go  slow\r\n\r\non increases in the cost of services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving the motion, Mr Tan Soo Khoon outlined his\r\n\r\nreasons  why he thinks that the rise in public  transport\r\n\r\nfares  and  other  fares  should be  avoided  during  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  recession.  He has made a thorough  analysis  of\r\n\r\nthe  transport companies to show why he thinks that  this\r\n\r\nrise in bus fares is not justified.  I do not want to  go\r\n\r\nover the grounds he covered and probably, I would not  be\r\n\r\nable  to  do it so well.  He has done a good job.  But  I\r\n\r\nwill  reinforce some of the salient points  that  he  has\r\n\r\nmade.   He  reflected the sentiments and frustrations  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  very adequately, and I share  his  concerns\r\n\r\nand hope our leaders are listening.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rising to support him, I am drawn back to a\r\n\r\nsession  I had with some Singaporeans on current  issues,\r\n\r\nincluding the rise in bus fares, electricity tariffs, MRT\r\n\r\nfares,  HDB parking fees, ERP charges and so on.  In  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of the discussions, I was reminded by one of  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public that we have  been  testing  the\r\n\r\nlimits  of  tolerance of Singaporeans with each increase.\r\n\r\nHe  said  that  we  are over-confident  and,  in  a  way,\r\n\r\narrogant,  because  we have just  won  the  GE  with  75%\r\n\r\nmajority.   He  reminded me that they gave us  this  high\r\n\r\nmandate,  because they had hoped that the  PAP  can  help\r\n\r\nbetter  improve their lives in these times of need.   And\r\n\r\nalso,  as  promised  in  our  manifesto,  he  said   that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans truly believe that the PAP is the only party\r\n\r\nthat  can help them out of this recession.  But  now,  it\r\n\r\nseems  that  we are making life more and more  tough  for\r\n\r\nthem.  Within six months\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  GE,  a  rash  of price increases - how  not  to  feel\r\n\r\nbetrayed, they complained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, Singaporeans are asked to tighten\r\n\r\ntheir  belts  through  various  measures,  such  as  wage\r\n\r\nrestraint,  no  bonuses  and more  and  more  job  losses\r\n\r\nthrough   restructuring.  They  now  face  a  series   of\r\n\r\nincreasing  costs in their daily lives. He said  that  he\r\n\r\nand  his  friends  are  dead water.   Those  of  you  who\r\n\r\nunderstand  Hokkien - I am a Hokkien  speaker   -   \"dead\r\n\r\nwater\"  literally translated means \"si chui\", as  opposed\r\n\r\nto \"wa chui\", which means alive, flowing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> \"Chou chui\"!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Not \"chou chui\", please. It is\r\n\r\ndifferent.  \"Chou chui\" means smelly water.  He said that\r\n\r\nin  a flowing stream, \"wa chui\", there is hope, something\r\n\r\nwould  come by to keep them alive.  They are hoping  that\r\n\r\nafter  GE,  Government would do something to create  more\r\n\r\njobs,  hold  prices  and give them  a  better  chance  of\r\n\r\nsurvival.   Now,  he  feels that he is  \"si  chui\",  dead\r\n\r\nwater,  and  dead water gets evaporated every  day.   The\r\n\r\nvarious  increases  evaporate whatever  savings  he  has,\r\n\r\nslowly   but  surely.   He  said  the  Government  always\r\n\r\njustifies by saying that there is no such thing as  wrong\r\n\r\ntiming.    The  Government's  action  in  this   economic\r\n\r\ndownturn is not bad timing.  Sir, if you had listened  to\r\n\r\nwhat  my  colleague has just said about  the  person  who\r\n\r\ncomplained to him about this poor economic condition, you\r\n\r\nwill  understand  why.   Of course,  Singaporeans  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand.  Unemployment is now almost 5%, and  if  this\r\n\r\nis not bad, then what is bad?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if in spite of the poor state of the economy we\r\n\r\nallow  the fare increases, are we not ignoring the plight\r\n\r\nof  the  people?   We  seem  to  be  concerned,  like  my\r\n\r\ncolleague said, about the return of equity for companies,\r\n\r\neven   though  these  companies  are  still  making  good\r\n\r\nprofits.   We  talk  about high cost  structures  in  our\r\n\r\neconomy, yet we do not try to delay the increases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another person, who is usually very quiet, got up to\r\n\r\ntell me and he said \"You\",\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeaning the PAP, \"are so powerful that you cannot see the\r\n\r\nwrong in yourself.\"  This statement got me thinking, very\r\n\r\nprofound.   But it tells something.  Are we  so  powerful\r\n\r\nthat  we can go along with all these increases?  We allow\r\n\r\nbus  operators  to sit in PTC, as Mr Tan  Soo  Khoon  has\r\n\r\nsaid,  and  we see no wrong.  We cannot see their  vested\r\n\r\ninterest and conflict of interest in such an arrangement.\r\n\r\nAnd no wonder writers in the forum page have always asked\r\n\r\nfor  an  independent  PTC  panel.   Perhaps,  after  this\r\n\r\ndebate,  there  should be a review on the composition  of\r\n\r\nthe PTC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also saying that we \"see no wrong in\r\n\r\nourselves\" by quoting PSA.  Yes, look at PSA - a hardened\r\n\r\nstand,  defended  almost to death, even when  faced  with\r\n\r\nfierce  competition on our doorsteps.  They were probably\r\n\r\nthinking  of  protecting their profits, their  return  on\r\n\r\nequity   -   too  cocksure  of  their  so-called   \"other\r\n\r\nadvantages\".    They  were  unable  to  see   the   wider\r\n\r\nimplications  until  they  lost  two  of  their   largest\r\n\r\ncustomers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Motion before the House which calls for the\r\n\r\nPTC  to  review  its decision on the increase  in  public\r\n\r\ntransport  fares, I think Mr Tan Soo Khoon has elaborated\r\n\r\non  this, and he did a marvellous job.  But I would still\r\n\r\nlike  to  add a few points to what he has said.   It  may\r\n\r\nseem  odd that we should be asking for a review when  the\r\n\r\nfare  hike is already in place but, like what he said  in\r\n\r\nthe  press, we had no opportune time.  Parliament  sat  a\r\n\r\nfew  days  after  the  fare increases  were  implemented.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans must try to understand how the  decision  to\r\n\r\nraise  fares came about.  I think what they want is  more\r\n\r\ntransparency.   Even I, like them, cannot understand  why\r\n\r\nthe  PTC turned down an earlier request, in 2001, for  an\r\n\r\nincrease   in  fares  because  of  unfavourable  economic\r\n\r\nsituation.  Then, suddenly, it changed its mind this year\r\n\r\nand  opted  for  an  increase,  when  the  poor  economic\r\n\r\nsituation  has  not changed.  Has the economic  situation\r\n\r\nimproved  in  2002  to warrant this change  in  decision?\r\n\r\nYet,  this House was told by the Finance Minister in  the\r\n\r\nlast  Budget debate that 88,000 Singaporeans were out  of\r\n\r\nwork, and now my colleague has told me that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is 100,000.  Unemployment has reached 4.5% by the end\r\n\r\nof last year, and the figure is still going up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason cited for the increases is ERP and\r\n\r\nroad  taxes  added  to  the cost.  I  checked  with  LTA,\r\n\r\nbecause  I  am on the LTA Board.  For the year 2002,  the\r\n\r\nprojected increase in ERP cost alone, according  to  SBS,\r\n\r\nis  $0.7 million.  But this House must know that when ERP\r\n\r\nwas  implemented in 1998, it was decided that ERP charges\r\n\r\nshould  apply to all vehicles which use roads,  and  that\r\n\r\nincludes public buses.  Just like other road users,  they\r\n\r\nalso  contribute to road congestion.  However, to  offset\r\n\r\nthe cost implication of introducing ERP, the road tax  of\r\n\r\npublic buses was reduced by $3,900 for each single-decked\r\n\r\nbus,  and $3,500 for each double-decked bus.  The overall\r\n\r\nroad  tax savings for the public bus operators, TIBS  and\r\n\r\nSBS included, amounted to $13 million annually.  Now this\r\n\r\nmore than offset the ERP charges of about $4 million paid\r\n\r\nby  the  public bus operators today.  The ERP charges  on\r\n\r\npublic   buses  therefore  do  not  contribute  to   cost\r\n\r\nincreases  for  the operators.  My other colleagues  must\r\n\r\nhave  more  to  say  and I would not want  to  dwell  any\r\n\r\nfurther on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, if the current recession has been thrown out\r\n\r\nas  a  consideration  for  the increase,  then  the  more\r\n\r\ncompelling  reasons must have prevailed, and  given  more\r\n\r\nweightage by PTC, to protect the profitability of the bus\r\n\r\ncompanies.   Now, is there a formula or magic  number  to\r\n\r\nthis?  While I support the Motion, I can quite understand\r\n\r\nthe  bus fare increase is but one issue, like what Mr Tan\r\n\r\nSoo Khoon has said, and it so happened that the level  of\r\n\r\ntolerance has reached a high level.  And, again like what\r\n\r\nmy  colleague, Mr Tan Soo Khoon has said,  the  bus  fare\r\n\r\nincrease is probably the lightning rod, receiving all the\r\n\r\nflak.   This  debate should be seen as an eye-opener  for\r\n\r\nthe  Government not to take the people for granted.   For\r\n\r\nsuch public services, where there are no true competitive\r\n\r\nforces, Government should not allow any increases without\r\n\r\nacceptable reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I am heartened to hear the\r\n\r\ntwo  Tans  who spoke before me.  I would like to  commend\r\n\r\nthem.  At least, now I know that there are PAP Members in\r\n\r\nthe  PAP Backbench who do care for the common man in  the\r\n\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Motion. I\r\n\r\nsay it is very unfair for the Public Transport Council to\r\n\r\nallow the bus and MRT fares to be increased at this point\r\n\r\nof  time when times are hard.  The worse effects  of  the\r\n\r\nrecession  are  still not over.  Workers  who  have  been\r\n\r\nretrenched are still suffering, the majority of whom have\r\n\r\nnot  been re-employed.  They are still floundering in the\r\n\r\nwilderness  of unemployment.  The Government, instead  of\r\n\r\nhelping   them  ease  their  suffering,  is  making   the\r\n\r\nsituation worse for the unemployed.  With this  bus  fare\r\n\r\nhike,  they  have to pay more for one of their  essential\r\n\r\nneeds - transportation.  With the fare hike of between  3\r\n\r\ncents  and  10  cents, the average worker shall  probably\r\n\r\nhave  to pay about 10-20% more for bus rides, taking into\r\n\r\naccount the over-payment they shall have to make with the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of the ez-link cards due to  the  fault  in\r\n\r\ntheir  cards, and also their forgetfulness.  Why  squeeze\r\n\r\nthe  poor workers at this point of very difficult  times?\r\n\r\nI  would like to call on the Government to get the PTC to\r\n\r\nrevoke  forthwith  the decision to  increase  bus  fares,\r\n\r\nwhich  have  been increased with effect  from  July  this\r\n\r\nyear,  and  to freeze the bus fare hike for at least  one\r\n\r\nyear,  or  until  the  economic  situation  significantly\r\n\r\nimproves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we can see, the Government shall also be the\r\n\r\nbeneficiary  when  there  is  a  bus  fare   hike.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment  shall be assured of payments of the  proposed\r\n\r\nincrease  in  GST and the ERP charges.  As  for  the  ERP\r\n\r\ncharges,  it  was  reported  that  the  Government  shall\r\n\r\ncollect something like $4.2 million a year from buses  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Buses may have to pay more ERP charges  when\r\n\r\nthe   night  ERP  charges  come  into  effect.   The  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies  are, in a way, a means for the  Government  to\r\n\r\ntransfer  the commuters' money into its own pocket.   The\r\n\r\nbus  companies'  excuse for fare hikes is  the  increased\r\n\r\ncost,  especially of staff salary.  They  say  that  they\r\n\r\nhave to pay more CPF to their workers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  the employer's CPF component was restored a further\r\n\r\n4%  in  January  2000.   However, the  CPF  paid  by  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies to their workers are still lower than the  pre-1998  level, when the cost cutting measures were put into\r\n\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SMRT Corporation reported in the Straits Times\r\n\r\nof  24th  June  2002  that \"the cost of  operation,  both\r\n\r\nsystems,  train  and  bus,  has  increased  3.1%  despite\r\n\r\nefforts  made by the company to contain costs and improve\r\n\r\nproductivity.  The SMRT Manpower Productivity in terms of\r\n\r\ntrain-kilometre operated per staff member has improved by\r\n\r\n4.8%  from  FY  2001 to FY 2002 through skills  training,\r\n\r\nautomation and reviewed processes.\"  It would appear then\r\n\r\nthat  the  staff salary increases have been mitigated  by\r\n\r\nthe improved productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact remains that the two major bus companies in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  namely,  the Singapore Bus  Services  Transit\r\n\r\n(SBS  Transit)  and the Trans Island Bus  Service  (TIBS)\r\n\r\nenjoy  all  the bus business in Singapore.  They  form  a\r\n\r\nduopoly.   They share all the well-designated  routes  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  they  annually  make  good  returns   or\r\n\r\nprofits.  SBS Transit reported last year, despite  a  dip\r\n\r\nin profits of 22%, it still made $39.6 million.  This was\r\n\r\nreported by Mr Tan Soo Khoon just now.  When SBS  Transit\r\n\r\nwas  formed out of a large number of small bus  companies\r\n\r\nin  the  1970s,  the Senior Minister, who was  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  then, was so confident of its success  that  he\r\n\r\ncould  promise shareholders of at least, or a guaranteed,\r\n\r\nminimum of 5% annual return.  I believe, that promise has\r\n\r\nvery  much been exceeded.  I believe that the SBS Transit\r\n\r\nis  now paying shareholders something like 17% dividends.\r\n\r\nSo  the  major bus companies in Singapore are  definitely\r\n\r\nmaking good profits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the Government has no qualms about\r\n\r\ntreating public bus companies as purely profit-orientated\r\n\r\ncompanies, and are not too concerned about their role  as\r\n\r\nproviders of public service.  I personally feel  that  in\r\n\r\nour  present  Singapore context where the two  major  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies are so protected, they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  show  an  interest in providing  public  service.\r\n\r\nThey  must have the public responsibility because  for  a\r\n\r\nlarge number of Singaporeans that is their only means  of\r\n\r\ntransportation.   Therefore, they cannot  increase  their\r\n\r\nfares  on a regular basis to ensure that every year  they\r\n\r\nmake  hefty profits.  If bus companies want to be treated\r\n\r\nas   purely  commercial  entities,  then  they  must   be\r\n\r\nsubjected to the open market competition.  The Government\r\n\r\nshould not protect just two bus companies but allow  free\r\n\r\nopen market competition.  Allow as many bus companies  to\r\n\r\noperate  as  the market can take.  With free open  market\r\n\r\ncompetition,  bus  fares  shall  surely  drop,  and   not\r\n\r\nsteadily  increase as in the present case.  See what  has\r\n\r\nhappened  in  the  case  of  telephone  companies.   With\r\n\r\ncompetition,  SingTel  rates  have  dropped  drastically,\r\n\r\nwhich the paying public benefit greatly.  The public  not\r\n\r\nonly  save  on their telephone bills but also get  better\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue with the bus service is the recent\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  the  ez-link  cards  to   replace   the\r\n\r\nTransitLink farecards.  I have been told that in the case\r\n\r\nof  the  ez-link cards, there are possibilities of  over-payment  on  the  part of commuters.  Commuters  nowadays\r\n\r\nboard a bus and, if a commuter is using the ez-link card,\r\n\r\non  entering  the bus, the maximum fare is  automatically\r\n\r\ndeducted  from his ez-link card after tapping it  on  the\r\n\r\ncard  reader.  When the commuter reaches his destination,\r\n\r\nhe taps his card at the exit card reader.  Any balance of\r\n\r\nthe  maximum fare is credited back to the commuter's  ez-link  card.  Should there be a malfunction of the ez-link\r\n\r\ncard  before  he alights from the bus, nothing  shall  be\r\n\r\ncredited back to the ez-link card of the commuter,  which\r\n\r\nmeans that he has to pay the maximum fare; currently,  up\r\n\r\nto  $1.53  for air-conditioned trunk services and  up  to\r\n\r\n$2.13/$2.28  for  SBS/TIBS express  services.   Commuters\r\n\r\nknow that if they forget to tap their ez-link cards, they\r\n\r\nshall  be  charged the maximum fare.  However,  how  many\r\n\r\nknow  that if the ez-link system malfunctions in any way,\r\n\r\nthey  shall  also  be  charged  the  maximum  fare?    In\r\n\r\naddition, a transfer will be classed as a new \"ride\",\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  they  will lose the transfer rebate of 25 cents  for\r\n\r\ntrunk services and MRT rides.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One commuter complained to me that he experienced\r\n\r\nout of 10 bus and MRT journeys, including transfers, when\r\n\r\nusing   the   ez-link   card,  he   encountered   ez-link\r\n\r\nmalfunction twice, ie, about 20% error rate, after  which\r\n\r\nhe immediately stopped using his ez-link card for several\r\n\r\nweeks.  The commuter has requested me to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhat is the error rate of the ez-link card on buses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, a 20% error for 10 bus rides is\r\n\r\nunacceptable.   I  understand that the ez-link  card  has\r\n\r\nbeen  introduced  only  recently.  Perhaps  the  Minister\r\n\r\nshould request the bus companies to have a longer testing\r\n\r\nperiod of the ez-link card until September this year,  as\r\n\r\noriginally announced, before the bus operators be allowed\r\n\r\nto use the ez-link card again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently, it is difficult to collect a refund for\r\n\r\nover-payment.  This prompted one, Mr J Seow, to write  to\r\n\r\nthe  tabloid, Streats, on Monday, 17th June  2002  issue,\r\n\r\nadvising other readers:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Do not bother to claim your refund should you\r\n\r\nforget to tap your ez-link card when you alight from  the\r\n\r\nbus.  . It is not worth the hassle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf  that  were truly the case, then I wonder why the  PTC\r\n\r\nshould allow bus companies to use the ez-link card system\r\n\r\nto  collect  fares at all, if the error rate  remains  at\r\n\r\n20%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate  on\r\n\r\nthe  motion concerning public transport fares.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike,  first, to express my appreciation to  Mr  Tan  Soo\r\n\r\nKhoon  for taking the effort to raise this Motion and  to\r\n\r\nmake  a  very thorough and eloquent speech, and  also  my\r\n\r\nother  colleague, Dr Tan Cheng Bock  -  both  of  whom  I\r\n\r\ncall  them  the  two \"big guns\" or \"big Tans\",  from  our\r\n\r\nBackbenchers  group   -   for  supporting  this   Motion.\r\n\r\nParticularly,  I would now like to commend  Mr  Chiam  as\r\n\r\nwell for coming up to speak in support of this Motion and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njoin us on our side, the PAP Backbenchers.  Thank you, Mr\r\n\r\nChiam.  He is looking more and more like a PAP MP!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree to support Mr Tan Soo Khoon in moving\r\n\r\nthis Motion, because the subject concerns practically all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   I  wish  to  highlight  that  the  Motion\r\n\r\nactually contains two important limbs.  The first limb is\r\n\r\nto  urge  the  Public  Transport Council  to  review  its\r\n\r\ndecision on the increase in public transport fares.   The\r\n\r\nsecond, and perhaps a more important limb, is to urge the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  take steps to ensure that the  prices  of\r\n\r\npublic  services  are not unreasonably  increased  during\r\n\r\nthese difficult times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on public transport fare increases. The\r\n\r\nincrease  in public transport fares has caused  residents\r\n\r\nto  be  greatly concerned.  This is evident by the  large\r\n\r\nnumber  of  letters to the press.  For us as MPs,  it  is\r\n\r\nevident  by  the  frequency and  the  ferocity  in  which\r\n\r\nresidents raise these questions and issues with us,  when\r\n\r\nthey meet us on the ground.  I recently conducted a house-to-house  visit  to  an  HDB block  in  my  constituency,\r\n\r\nfollowed by a typical dialogue session with my residents.\r\n\r\nUnlike  the  past, when the usual complaints  were  about\r\n\r\nlocal and estate issues, I was most taken aback that  the\r\n\r\ndifference  this  time round, the most  common  complaint\r\n\r\nlately was regarding public transport fare increases  and\r\n\r\nother price increases.   During a recent dialogue session\r\n\r\nwith  a small group of residents, they pleaded and argued\r\n\r\nmost  furiously and emotionally against all these  unfair\r\n\r\nfare increases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some residents even took the trouble to pen down\r\n\r\ntheir  thoughts and submit petition letters to me.  Allow\r\n\r\nme  to read a quotation from one petition that I received\r\n\r\nfrom  a  resident, a Mdm Lee.  She actually wrote  a  two\r\n\r\nfull-page,  well-typed out petition.  Let  me  read  some\r\n\r\nsections of it.  She said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Well, my sons and I are grateful to the ruling\r\n\r\nparty for the good life we had in the past.  However, the\r\n\r\nrecent economic crisis has dampened our spirits somewhat.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also very anxious in regard to the never-ending news of steady increases in necessities such as\r\n\r\ntransport,  food, utilities, telephone  bills,  etc,  and\r\n\r\nwith rumours of more to come.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat, she even said `with rumours of more to\r\n\r\ncome.'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, she went on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"An old lady was overheard complaining loudly in the\r\n\r\nmarket that whatever monies the Government had given  out\r\n\r\n(CPF  and  New  Singapore Shares) are now being  recouped\r\n\r\nback  and with interest too!  She was very bitter  and  I\r\n\r\ndon't  blame  her  as many people also agreed  with  her.\r\n\r\nMany  are saying that the carrots given out were  because\r\n\r\nof  the elections and now after the elections, prices  of\r\n\r\neverything have gone up.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this letter actually reflects very truly and\r\n\r\naccurately the sentiments on the ground.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now examine the PTC approved fare increases\r\n\r\nto see whether it is fair or unfair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Tan Soo Khoon has put forth and analysed very\r\n\r\nclosely the accounts of SBS and SMRT, he finds it hard to\r\n\r\njustify  fare  increases, based on  the  fact  that  they\r\n\r\nactually achieved good operating performances in the last\r\n\r\nfew  years.   I  wish to reiterate and support  Mr  Tan's\r\n\r\npoint.  In fact, I have a one-page summary here.  One can\r\n\r\nactually get a copy quite easily from the SGX website  on\r\n\r\nSBS  Transit.   I have attached it to my speech  for  the\r\n\r\nreporters  to  take  a  look.  This one-page  summary  is\r\n\r\nproduced by the company itself, not prepared by  me.   It\r\n\r\nactually  tells a very interesting picture of the  health\r\n\r\nof  SBS  Transit.  It shows the performance in  the  last\r\n\r\nfive  years.   From  1997 to 2000, SBS Transit  has  been\r\n\r\nconsistently  achieving revenues of  above  $500  million\r\n\r\nbecause people take buses, whether it is in good  or  bad\r\n\r\ntimes.  Its after tax profit has actually been increasing\r\n\r\nsince  1997.  As Mr Tan has quoted, from $21  million  in\r\n\r\n1997  all the way up to $50.9 million in 2000.  In  these\r\n\r\nfour years, its profit went up 2 1/2 times.  Last year, in\r\n\r\n2001,  the  profit went down to $40 million,  versus  $50\r\n\r\nmillion  in the year before in 2000, just a drop  of  $10\r\n\r\nmillion.  And now we see that it is coming to the PTC  to\r\n\r\nask for fare increases so soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at its capital reserves, it actually has\r\n\r\nvery  good capital reserves.  It has been growing from  a\r\n\r\nsmallish  $88  million  in 1997  by  nearly  three  times\r\n\r\nincrease to $222 million in 2001.  Its equity and capital\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreserves  have  increased to $222 million  in  2001.   On\r\n\r\nreturn  of capital, as Mr Tan has stated, it has  a  very\r\n\r\nhigh  return  on equity, ranging from 30% in  good  times\r\n\r\ndown  to  18%  last year.  But 18% is still a  very  good\r\n\r\nreturn  on equity for any company, especially during  bad\r\n\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we study the accounts for year 2001, the company\r\n\r\nactually  has achieved, in the last five years,  a  total\r\n\r\nafter tax profit of $190 million.  On the $40 million  of\r\n\r\nreturns, based on the $555 million revenue last year,  it\r\n\r\nactually has a 7% return on revenue, which, again,  is  a\r\n\r\nvery respectable and a very good figure during bad times.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, if we look at this one-page chart [indicating],\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  see  a single red mark in this  report  card,\r\n\r\nwhich indicates it is indeed a very healthy company.  Why\r\n\r\nare  we  saying  that this company now  needs  more  fare\r\n\r\nincreases?  The same can be said of other operators, like\r\n\r\nSMRT as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to support Mr Tan's\r\n\r\ncontention  that  the price increase is difficult  to  be\r\n\r\nsupportable,   based  on  the  argument  that   transport\r\n\r\ncompanies are not making enough money.  In fact,  on  the\r\n\r\ncontrary, they have high reserves, high revenues and high\r\n\r\nearnings.    Therefore,  people  can  accept  that   fare\r\n\r\nincreases are unavoidable, but they cannot accept  unfair\r\n\r\nfare increases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, unfortunate that the Public\r\n\r\nTransport  Council  (PTC)  has decided  to  allow  public\r\n\r\ntransport   fares  to  increase  during  this   uncertain\r\n\r\neconomic period.  Although the fare increases are already\r\n\r\nimplemented  from 1st July, that means, from  early  this\r\n\r\nweek,  and  this debate can only be held after  the  fare\r\n\r\nincreases  were  implemented, I would  like  to  join  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues,  Mr Tan Soo Khoon and Dr Tan Cheng  Bock,  to\r\n\r\nurge,  in  our  Motion,  that the  PTC  review  its  fare\r\n\r\nincreases.   If  the PTC is open-minded  and  enlightened\r\n\r\nenough  to  perhaps  even consider  postponing  the  fare\r\n\r\nincreases,  so  that,  at  least,  there  is  a  stay  or\r\n\r\nsuspension of the fare increases.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people, especially the political leaders, may\r\n\r\nsay  that  it is not good to set a precedent that  public\r\n\r\npressure  can cause the PTC to revise its decisions,  and\r\n\r\nthat  we  cannot govern the country by just listening  to\r\n\r\nthe  wishes of the people.  However, I contend that there\r\n\r\nare  indeed  occasions when it is correct and prudent  to\r\n\r\nlisten  to  the people.  This is one such  occasion.   If\r\n\r\nthis  is  done,  the  people  and  the  Government  would\r\n\r\nappreciate each other better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to state that, contrary to\r\n\r\nthe  constant refrain that we cannot govern by giving  in\r\n\r\nto  the wishes of the people, I wish to say that the PTC,\r\n\r\nas  well as the Government, would be viewed positively if\r\n\r\nit   would  reconsider  the  fare  increases.   It  would\r\n\r\ndemonstrate  that we have public bodies and a  Government\r\n\r\nthat  could be attuned to the ground and concerns of  the\r\n\r\npeople,   and   be  prepared  to  review   policies   and\r\n\r\nregulations when circumstances show the need  to  do  so.\r\n\r\nSuch a bold Government, in fact, would be well liked  and\r\n\r\nwell praised by the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to make a few\r\n\r\nadditional suggestions with regard to the PTC.  First,  I\r\n\r\nsupport Mr Tan and Mr Tan  -  as I have said,  the double\r\n\r\n\"Tans\"   -  that to demonstrate that the PTC consists  of\r\n\r\nmembers that are independent, I would, therefore, like to\r\n\r\nsuggest    that   the   Council   should   not    include\r\n\r\nrepresentatives from the public transport operators.   If\r\n\r\nneed  be,  transport operators can be  enlisted  to  give\r\n\r\ntechnical  or  professional input on  specific  subjects.\r\n\r\nBut they do not need to be represented on the Council.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand that the transport operators are excluded from\r\n\r\nthe  Council's  deliberations on  fare  increases.   But,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, the public could still be mistaken that the\r\n\r\ntransport operators could be unduly influencing the other\r\n\r\nCouncil members, because they sit in the same Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to suggest that a wider\r\n\r\nrepresentation  of  members  from  grassroots  bodies  be\r\n\r\nincluded in the Council.  Perhaps, even to include people\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  actually  take public transport regularly,  and  not\r\n\r\npeople who do not normally take public transport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Council may wish to conduct more public\r\n\r\nforums and talks to better place and explain their  work,\r\n\r\nespecially pertaining to reviewing of fare increases.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  go  on to the future increases in the prices  of\r\n\r\nother  public services.  I would like to move on to  this\r\n\r\npoint  which concerns and worries the people  even  more,\r\n\r\nwhich  is with regard to future increases in other public\r\n\r\nservices,  as  expressed by my resident, Mdm  Lee.   This\r\n\r\nconcern  is  prompted  by  the  recent  decision  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to increase GST from 3% to 5%.   Though  this\r\n\r\nGST increase is only to be introduced from next year,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  we  could notice that many retailers have  already\r\n\r\nincreased  their charges.  Common examples are the  price\r\n\r\nof  a  cup of coffee from 60 cents to 70 cents (more than\r\n\r\n2%  of  GST), and a bowl of noodles from about  $2.50  to\r\n\r\n$3.00  by some hawkers.  Less fishballs, maybe even  less\r\n\r\nnoodles as well.  Then, there have been indications  that\r\n\r\nthere may well be other increases by the public bodies on\r\n\r\nthe  cards,  like Singapore Power and SingTel.   We  know\r\n\r\nthat HDB is already going to increase the carpark charges\r\n\r\nfrom 1st September this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to stress that it is very important for\r\n\r\nthe  Government to retain the trust and confidence of the\r\n\r\npeople.  The Government has recently won a renewed 5-year\r\n\r\nmandate  with  resounding support of 75% of the  people's\r\n\r\nvotes.  With this strong endorsement, the Government  can\r\n\r\ngo  about managing the country with confidence.  However,\r\n\r\nI  wish  to warn that this trust of the people is like  a\r\n\r\ncontract.  The people's mandate is given on a contractual\r\n\r\nobligation  of  the Government that the people's  welfare\r\n\r\nand well-being is taken care of.  If there is a spate  of\r\n\r\nunreasonable,  unfair fare increases during  this  period\r\n\r\nwhen  people are facing a severe economic difficulty  and\r\n\r\nhigher unemployment, this trust can be fragile and easily\r\n\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I wish to earnestly and\r\n\r\nsincerely urge the Government to be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery  mindful about the difficulties faced by the people.\r\n\r\nThere is a large segment of the population who have great\r\n\r\nfaith  in  the Government, but they are facing  difficult\r\n\r\ntimes.   Future fare increases should be deferred as  far\r\n\r\nas possible so that the negative impact can be mitigated.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

It claimed\r\n\r\nthat  this  pinch of salt ought to be rubbed in  earlier,\r\n\r\nand  that it is better to do so early than having to pour\r\n\r\nsulphuric acid  later on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, business is business. As a public listed\r\n\r\ncompany,  the  investors' concern is  on  the  return  on\r\n\r\ninvestment  of the public transport companies.   However,\r\n\r\nreturn  on  investment is linked to the investment  risk.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a common knowledge to the investment community.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  Government's regulation,  the  two  companies\r\n\r\nmonopolise the public transport market and do not have to\r\n\r\nface  competition.  It is a low-risk business with steady\r\n\r\nrevenue. How can one ask for a high return on such a  low\r\n\r\nrisk  investment? This cannot be so if we compare it with\r\n\r\nhigh-risk  businesses, such as the  disk  drive  industry\r\n\r\nwhere  losses  can amount to a few tens  of  millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars just within a few months. In this difficult time\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere  companies  are slashing prices for  survival,  the\r\n\r\nbasic  principle of low risk low return could  be  easily\r\n\r\nappreciated by the investors, let alone that  the  public\r\n\r\ntransport companies are still enjoying handsome profits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Temasek Holdings, under the Government, is the\r\n\r\nmajor  shareholder of SMRT with 62% of the  total  shares\r\n\r\nissued. I am sure they have a say in deciding whether  to\r\n\r\nask for a rise in the MRT fares to increase profit.  SMRT\r\n\r\ninitiated  a  fare hike.  Is the Government  saying  that\r\n\r\nthey are not happy with the present return on investment?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM Lee said that if we do not increase GST,\r\n\r\nSingapore would run into a \"chronic\" structural  deficit.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the people must share the burden.   PTC  said\r\n\r\nthat  if  the  bus and MRT fares are not increased,   the\r\n\r\npublic transport companies will not be able to offset the\r\n\r\nrise  in operational cost and their profits will go down.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the people would have to share the burden.  It\r\n\r\nseems  that Singaporeans have a lot of burdens  to  share\r\n\r\nin.   Of  course, when we do business, we  want  to  have\r\n\r\nprofits.   But  the crux  is that when the infrastructure\r\n\r\nused  by  the MRT and the bus companies to operate  their\r\n\r\nbusinesses, such as the MRT stations, the rails, the  bus\r\n\r\ninterchanges and the bus stops, are built with funds from\r\n\r\ntaxpayers' money, public transport cannot be an  ordinary\r\n\r\nbusiness.   It  is  a public service,  a  business  which\r\n\r\nconcerns  the interest of the general public.  Especially\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  where  car ownership  and  car  usage  is\r\n\r\nextremely  expensive,  public transport is  an  essential\r\n\r\nservice that is required by the people on a daily  basis.\r\n\r\nIt  is  an  important part of composition in  the  public\r\n\r\nservice,  and  any  increase in  fares  would  inevitably\r\n\r\ncreate  an  impact  on the people, particularly  in  this\r\n\r\ndifficult time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the thrust of the matter is not whether\r\n\r\nthis  is the best time to increase bus and MRT fares,  or\r\n\r\nfor  the  PTC  to review its decision on the increase  in\r\n\r\npublic  transport fares, as stated in this Motion  before\r\n\r\nthe  House, or a question of what is a reasonable  profit\r\n\r\nand return .  The fundamental question is:  should\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic transport service be run as a business? To further\r\n\r\nextend  this question, is the philosophy of profit-making\r\n\r\nin  providing  public  services as  adopted  by  the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment  the real issue that needs to be  scrutinised?\r\n\r\nDPM  Lee  has just said recently that Singapore is  in  a\r\n\r\nstage  of  economic transition where  the  days  of  high\r\n\r\ngrowth  and  high employment rate have passed.   At  this\r\n\r\ntime,  when  our economy is going into a transition,  the\r\n\r\nordinary people are affected the most.  Although  we  are\r\n\r\nnot  a  welfare state, the Government should not  neglect\r\n\r\nthe  welfare of the  people.  The Government must try  to\r\n\r\nhelp them to alleviate their burden, and public transport\r\n\r\npolicy  is  one  of the items that the Government  should\r\n\r\nlook into.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should question the PAP Government on its profit-driven policy through privatisation in providing public\r\n\r\nservices.  We are pursuing a market economy, but when the\r\n\r\nenvironment  changes, when the gap between the  rich  and\r\n\r\nthe  poor has widened, when the poor get poorer  and  the\r\n\r\nrich  get  richer,  the contradictions surrounding  these\r\n\r\nchanges would become more and more acute.  This round  of\r\n\r\nfare  hike  has  generated  a strong  dissent  among  the\r\n\r\npeople,  and  this is not just a momentary  reflex.   The\r\n\r\npolicy  of  allowing the public transport service  to  be\r\n\r\noperated by private companies whose objective is to  make\r\n\r\nprofits needs to be re-examined.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As taxpayers, Singaporeans are paying for the\r\n\r\nbuilding   of  the  infrastructure  necessary   for   the\r\n\r\noperations of the bus and MRT services.  Why should we be\r\n\r\nalso  asked  to  bear the burden of ensuring  that  these\r\n\r\ncompanies meet their projected or desired profits?  If we\r\n\r\nanalyse  the present model, the Government has  increased\r\n\r\nits taxes - GST, COE, ERP to control car ownership - and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, collects a lot of revenue from these  sources.\r\n\r\nWith  this taxpayers' money, it builds the infrastructure\r\n\r\nfor the MRT and buses, and then  leave the operations  of\r\n\r\npublic  transport  to the private companies  for  profit-making.   The major shareholders of these companies  are,\r\n\r\nmore often than not, holding\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompanies  under the Government.  At the same  time,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  imposes  limits on the  life-span  of  buses,\r\n\r\nincreases  their  ERP charges, builds airconditioned  bus\r\n\r\ninterchanges, thereby building up what it calls a \"world-class\"  public transport system to show off to the world.\r\n\r\nBy  doing  so, it has increased the operational costs  of\r\n\r\nthese companies.  It seems that the Government is doing a\r\n\r\ngood  job  in protecting the interest of the  people  and\r\n\r\nbalancing  the  demand of the public transport  operator.\r\n\r\nIndeed  it  is not the case.  Through the PTC's guideline\r\n\r\nof  so  called balancing the interest between the  public\r\n\r\nand the operators, the Government allows the companies to\r\n\r\nincrease  their fares from time to time, in the  name  of\r\n\r\nrecovering the increase in operational cost, and  thereby\r\n\r\nthe people are the ones who have to bear the burden .\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the tax collector and also the major shareholder\r\n\r\nof  the public transport companies, the Government stands\r\n\r\nto  gain  by higher tax revenues and dividends  when  the\r\n\r\nfares go up and the companies' profits escalate. So it is\r\n\r\na  win-win  situation for the Government, but the  people\r\n\r\nend up paying higher fares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workers' Party has all along held the view that\r\n\r\npublic  services should not be profit-oriented.  We  also\r\n\r\nproposed  that the Government set up a national transport\r\n\r\nenterprise to take over the operation of buses and MRT so\r\n\r\nthat  we can  have a better integrated service and,  most\r\n\r\nimportantly,  this national transport enterprise  is  not\r\n\r\nprofit-oriented  but  run on a cost-recovery  basis.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  with  the  Workers' Party's recommendation,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will say, \"This is like restarting state-owned\r\n\r\nenterprises and it would not be in line with  the  global\r\n\r\ntrend.\"   But  to  us, it is more important  whether  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the people can be better  protected.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment can say that this has been proven  to  be  not\r\n\r\nfeasible  in  the  other  countries.   But  has  the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment  been emphasising, again and again,  that  the\r\n\r\nsituation in our country is  different from others?  What\r\n\r\ncannot   be  done  in  other  countries  can  be   easily\r\n\r\nimplemented  here, eg, GST, ERP, etc, and the  Government\r\n\r\nis always proud\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof its achievements in this respect.  In the same breath,\r\n\r\nwhy  can the Government not differentiate itself from the\r\n\r\nrest of the world and take back the function of running a\r\n\r\nstate-owned  public  transport  company,  whose  business\r\n\r\nobjective  is to provide public service and not  to  make\r\n\r\nprofit? The Government may respond that competition  will\r\n\r\nbe  removed and service quality will deteriorate  if  our\r\n\r\nproposal  is  implemented, but where is  the  competition\r\n\r\nwhen  the  current  service  routes  between  these   two\r\n\r\ncompanies  are  not overlapping, and these companies  can\r\n\r\neven join effort in pushing for a fare hike?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government may also claim that without the pot\r\n\r\nof  gold at the end of business operation, there will  be\r\n\r\nno  incentive  for  the  public  transport  operators  to\r\n\r\nimprove themselves, as such efficiency will go down.  But\r\n\r\nlet  us  take  a look at our armed forces and educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  They  are  all  public  services  with  no\r\n\r\nelement of profit; is the Government saying that they are\r\n\r\nnot efficient?  The HDB has persistently claimed that  it\r\n\r\nhas  been  subsidising public housing.  Every year,  they\r\n\r\nrun  into losses; yet, its achievement and efficiency  is\r\n\r\nsomething that the Government is so proud of.   So,  what\r\n\r\nis  motivating them? Why can we not adopt the  HDB  model\r\n\r\nand  let  a   state  enterprise operate public  transport\r\n\r\nwithout having profits as their aim? Moreover, we are not\r\n\r\nasking  for additional subsidies besides continuing  with\r\n\r\nthe   current   funding   in   building   infrastructure.\r\n\r\nComparing  to the current model, what is removed  is  the\r\n\r\nsource   of  conflict,  ie,  profits,   as  the  proposed\r\n\r\nenterprise  is operating on a cost recovery  basis.  They\r\n\r\ncould  try  to break even with a prudent fare  structure,\r\n\r\nwhile  striving  to  provide  quality  service  with  the\r\n\r\nobjective of maximising benefit to our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with this economic transition, all\r\n\r\nour  people should put up a concerted effort to tide over\r\n\r\nthe  difficult times.  The Government should also respond\r\n\r\nto  the sacrifices made by the people by lightening their\r\n\r\nburden.   One aspect  is to temper its current policy  on\r\n\r\nproviding  public services with more rational and  humane\r\n\r\nmeasures, so that we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan come out from the crisis as a more cohesive nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down on the\r\n\r\nOrder  Paper for today be exempted at this day's  sitting\r\n\r\nfrom  the provisions of Standing Order No. 1. -  [Dr  Lee\r\n\r\nBoon Yang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PUBLIC TRANSPORT FARES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to\r\n\r\nbegin with, I would like to declare the fact that I am  a\r\n\r\nBoard  Member  of  the Comfort Group, a company  that  is\r\n\r\nengaged  in  land transportation business,  primarily  in\r\n\r\ntaxis,  but  has a small subsidiary in the chartered  bus\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Tan Soo Khoon and the PAP\r\n\r\nMembers who spoke before me have already touched  on  the\r\n\r\npublic   sentiments  regarding  this  round   of   public\r\n\r\ntransportation  fare  increases.   Such  fare   increases\r\n\r\naffect  the majority of the commuters, with the  greatest\r\n\r\nimpact  on the lower income.  So, not surprisingly,  this\r\n\r\nis  always  a  topic  that would  arouse  public  outcry,\r\n\r\nwhether such increases are made during boom times or in a\r\n\r\nrecession.   Although the quantum of the  increases  this\r\n\r\nround is small, people feel helpless and frustrated  that\r\n\r\nthere is no viable alternative available to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Sir, this time round, the matter is\r\n\r\nmade  even  much worse simply because the timing  was  so\r\n\r\nbad.   Our  economy  is just turning the  corner  in  the\r\n\r\nrecession.   Unlike Mr Tan, I think there is  actually  a\r\n\r\nclear  trend  that  the economy is turning  around.   The\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  the  turnaround, though, has not  percolated\r\n\r\ndown  to the masses yet, and many of us are still feeling\r\n\r\nthe impact one way or another.  Thus, even though the PTC\r\n\r\nhad disclosed in detail the factors it had considered and\r\n\r\nhad explained the reasons for its decisions, the majority\r\n\r\nof commuters are still unhappy with the rulings.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Feedback Unit has received numerous similar\r\n\r\npublic comments regarding this, and I would like to thank\r\n\r\nMr  Tan  for moving this Motion to allow Members of  like\r\n\r\nmind  to speak on this topic.  I, too, would like to call\r\n\r\nupon  the PTC to review, not so much the quantum  of  the\r\n\r\nincreases  but,  perhaps,  take  into  consideration  the\r\n\r\ntiming of the increases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel, however, that since the PTC\r\n\r\nis  getting so much negative vibes that, in the  interest\r\n\r\nof  a  more balanced and less emotional debate,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  put  our public transportation  system  in  its\r\n\r\nproper  context.   We  should  realise  that  the  public\r\n\r\ntransportation  sector in Singapore, including  the  rail\r\n\r\nand  the scheduled bus services, is a regulated industry.\r\n\r\nI  would like the House to think about what is meant by a\r\n\r\n\"regulated  industry\".  It is not a free  market,  freely\r\n\r\ncompetitive  industry.  It is a regulated industry.   So,\r\n\r\nfor  instance, when Mr Tan, in his speech,  talked  about\r\n\r\nSIA  being  very responsive to market forces,  he  should\r\n\r\nrealise that SIA, in the international marketplace, is in\r\n\r\na   freely  competitive  marketplace  with  many  players\r\n\r\nwhereas,  in Singapore, in the public sector,  especially\r\n\r\nin  public transportation, we have designed it  to  be  a\r\n\r\nregulated industry.  So, if we want to complain about how\r\n\r\nthe  system is being regulated, we should indeed go  back\r\n\r\nto  square one and ask whether we should have a regulated\r\n\r\nindustry or a free market industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we are on the subject of SIA, let me also say\r\n\r\nthat  many  of  us have in the past complained  that  SIA\r\n\r\nfares  have been very high, that it is a cartel  and,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  Singaporeans  pay  more buying  their  tickets  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, compared to those bought in Hong Kong  or  KL.\r\n\r\nSo,  we  cannot  mix  the  SIA example  with  the  public\r\n\r\ntransportation example in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all regulated industries, it is the job of the\r\n\r\nregulator to ensure a prescribed level of service in  the\r\n\r\nindustry  in  exchange for a guaranteed  return  for  the\r\n\r\noperators.  I think we must all accept this.   If  we  do\r\n\r\nnot, then we are not talking like for like.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreturn  for the operators would be typically measured  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  percentage returns based on a  certain  basis,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  return  on  investment  or  return  on  equity,\r\n\r\nwhichever  is appropriate.  In other words, in  regulated\r\n\r\nindustries,  the operators are given a guaranteed  return\r\n\r\nand  are  rewarded, in most cases, on a cost-plus  basis.\r\n\r\nFor  the  regulatory  environment to  operate  well,  the\r\n\r\nregulator should be an independent body that is  fair  to\r\n\r\nthe commuters and operators, and it is not influenced  by\r\n\r\nthe operators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government, as well as this House, should\r\n\r\ndesist  from  interfering  with  the  work  of  the  PTC.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  we might as well perform this role ourselves.\r\n\r\nMaybe  the House should sit as PTC and decide what  is  a\r\n\r\nfair adjustment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I believe that the choice of members of the\r\n\r\nPTC  is  important.  I agree that it is  not  appropriate\r\n\r\nthat  the  operators sit as members of the  PTC,  but  as\r\n\r\nresource  members.   Despite all the criticisms,  I  must\r\n\r\nalso  say that the PTC has so far done a reasonable  job,\r\n\r\nbalancing  the interests of all parties involved.   This,\r\n\r\nMr  Tan  Soo  Khoon  himself has also conceded.   It  has\r\n\r\nresisted  requests for fare increases from the  operators\r\n\r\nfor  several years before granting this current round  of\r\n\r\nincreases.   I  really  do not envy  the  men  and  women\r\n\r\nserving on the PTC.  Theirs is a thankless task,  and  we\r\n\r\nshould not make their job any more difficult.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, once we have established the regulatory regime,\r\n\r\nwith  the  PTC  as a fare approving body, then  we  would\r\n\r\nexpect to see the following sequence of events.  This  is\r\n\r\nalready  a  given.   So,  from time  to  time,  when  the\r\n\r\ntransport operators come to PTC with their hats in  their\r\n\r\nhands and reams of data to show that the costs have  gone\r\n\r\nup,  returns on investments have declined, what would the\r\n\r\nregulator  or  PTC  do?   It is their  job  to  determine\r\n\r\nwhether  the  operators have met the various  performance\r\n\r\nstandards.   And,  if they do, then the  regulator  would\r\n\r\ndetermine  whether  the return on investment  has  indeed\r\n\r\nfallen  below the target.  If all these factors are  met,\r\n\r\nthen  the  regulator really has not much  option  but  to\r\n\r\napprove fare\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincreases.  If we accept that this is the way the  system\r\n\r\nis supposed to work, then we should ask ourselves whether\r\n\r\nthis  was  what  happened in this recent  round  of  fare\r\n\r\nadjustment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can tell, the PTC has acted quite\r\n\r\nindependently, using its best judgment.   So,  I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  Mr  Low is mistaken to point the finger at the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment, claiming that, because of ownership, we  have\r\n\r\nallowed  the Government-owned company to raise  fares  to\r\n\r\nsqueeze  the people.  In fact, if Mr Low is unhappy  with\r\n\r\nthe  way the PTC was set up, he could suggest a different\r\n\r\nway  to regulate the public transportation sector.   But,\r\n\r\ngiven  this is how the PTC is supposed to work, I believe\r\n\r\nhe is off the mark.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the case involving IDA and SingTel that was in\r\n\r\ncourt recently, any time a regulator interferes with  the\r\n\r\nmarket,  causing  the operator to have a  lower  rate  of\r\n\r\nreturn,  I  believe  the operator  has  a  case  to  seek\r\n\r\ncompensation from the Government.  I also believe that it\r\n\r\nis not a matter whether the company is still making money\r\n\r\nor  not.  This is a matter whether the company is  making\r\n\r\nthe  appropriate  rate  of return than  existing  at  the\r\n\r\noutset  of  the regulatory regime.  Of course,  we  could\r\n\r\ndebate  whether  the PTC has been too generous  with  the\r\n\r\noperators and accepted too readily SBS Transit and SMRT's\r\n\r\nrequest that they should continue to earn a high rate  of\r\n\r\nreturn based on historical norm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is a point here that we can debate.\r\n\r\nBased  on  the  rate of return on equity,  SBS'  rate  of\r\n\r\nreturn seems rather high, with ROE at 24.7% in year 2000,\r\n\r\nand  17.8% in year 2001.  Thus, it is not surprising that\r\n\r\npeople  get  angry when the companies raise  fares  in  a\r\n\r\nrecession  where almost all other companies  are  showing\r\n\r\nlower profits or outright losses.  So the argument should\r\n\r\nbe:  why is it that SBS Transit and SMRT are not prepared\r\n\r\nto earn a lower rate of return, like everybody else in  a\r\n\r\nrecession?  Perhaps the PTC should disclose to the public\r\n\r\nwhat is the ROE that transport companies are permitted to\r\n\r\nachieve  in a non-competitive environment.  Perhaps  they\r\n\r\ncan also disclose what is the target rate of the ROE\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat companies are allowed to achieve. If the PTC can  do\r\n\r\nthis, I believe that it will be easier for it to win over\r\n\r\nthe support of the commuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, so long as we have two bus\r\n\r\noperators  running  our  public  transport  sector,  this\r\n\r\nscenario  that I have painted out earlier would play  out\r\n\r\nagain  and again.  I suggest that we take a leaf  out  of\r\n\r\nhow  IDA  regulates the mobile phone industry.   In  that\r\n\r\ncase,  as  Mr  Chiam  has  pointed  out,  IDA  terminated\r\n\r\nSingTel's  monopoly  and allowed new  entrants  into  the\r\n\r\nmarket.   With  StarHub,  M1 and  Virgin  Mobile  in  the\r\n\r\nmarket,  the consumers now get better service  and  value\r\n\r\nfor  money. In fact, so much so that one of the companies\r\n\r\ndeclared  recently  that  it  is  pulling  out  from  the\r\n\r\nmarketplace.   I  suggest  that  the  Minister  seriously\r\n\r\nconsider introducing greater competition in the scheduled\r\n\r\nbus  service by perhaps splitting up SBS Transit into two\r\n\r\nor more companies, or allow other companies to enter into\r\n\r\nthe  market.  I am sure that the Minister could  see  the\r\n\r\nmerit   of   greater   competition,   not   free   market\r\n\r\ncompetition, but greater competition, as IDA was part  of\r\n\r\nhis portfolio not so long ago.  Opening up the market for\r\n\r\ngreater   competition   has  also   been   advocated   by\r\n\r\nChristopher  Tan in Business Times and Yeoh Kok  Seng  in\r\n\r\nthe Today newspaper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, listening to Mr Low Thia Khiang, I\r\n\r\nam reminded almost like standing at a street corner rally\r\n\r\nduring  the  1960s.   He uses 1960s'  leftist  jargon  to\r\n\r\nappeal  to  the segments of society that would  find  his\r\n\r\npitch  attractive.  He tried to paint the PAP  Government\r\n\r\nas  incentive-technocrat, out to squeeze  the  last  drop\r\n\r\nfrom the poor to fatten the coffers of the bus companies.\r\n\r\nI  think  his suggestion for a non-profit corporation  is\r\n\r\nseductive.     However,   as   we   all   know,    public\r\n\r\ntransportation has a consumption element in  it.   If  we\r\n\r\nprice  the  service  below cost,  we  would  distort  the\r\n\r\nallocation   of   resources  and  encourage   unnecessary\r\n\r\nconsumption.   We  would also encourage  dependency  that\r\n\r\nwould  be  difficult to unwind in future. So by  thinking\r\n\r\nthrough   the  consequence  of  subsidies,  I   am   sure\r\n\r\nSingaporeans would see through the fallacy of his logic.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think some of the models which have been\r\n\r\nadvocated,  eg, running public transportation  along  the\r\n\r\nline  that  he  has proposed, is already in operation  in\r\n\r\nChina.   If he has visited China, he would know  that  in\r\n\r\nsome  Chinese cities, where bus transportation  companies\r\n\r\nare still state-owned, the buses are rickety, and many of\r\n\r\nthem have no lights in them.  If you travel in such buses\r\n\r\nat  night, it is pitch dark inside.  To improve their bus\r\n\r\nsystem,   the   Chinese   have  been   inviting   foreign\r\n\r\nparticipation in their bus operation, as they  know  that\r\n\r\nthese  state-funded  operations  are  being  run  to  the\r\n\r\nground.   Does he know that SBS Transit has  invested  in\r\n\r\nthe   public  bus  operation  in  Shanghai?    And   with\r\n\r\ncompetition,  the  bus service in Shanghai  has  improved\r\n\r\ndramatically.   So  the very same  company  that  we  are\r\n\r\nberating this afternoon is earning accolades for its  bus\r\n\r\noperation in Shanghai.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that the process of\r\n\r\narriving at this round of fare increases could have  been\r\n\r\ndone better.  We could have taken into consideration  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  unemployed  workers  in  Singapore  and   the\r\n\r\nsentiments  of  Singaporeans in general.   On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  I would submit that the basic philosophy of a  bus\r\n\r\ntransport  system  is  correct and  that  the  regulatory\r\n\r\nframework  is  a sound one.  Thus, Mr Low's criticism  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  is unjustified.  His suggestion of increasing\r\n\r\nsubsidies  for  commuters is based on unsound  principles\r\n\r\nthat have proven not to work elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would urge the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider my suggestion of introducing greater competition\r\n\r\ninto public transportation, especially the bus sector.\r\n\r\n<br>3.55 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  would like to speak on this motion in the name  of  Mr\r\n\r\nTan Soo Khoon on the public transport fare hikes.  I want\r\n\r\nto thank him for this opportunity to ventilate my views.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the discussion on the latest PTC's decisions\r\n\r\non   public   transport  fare  hikes  have  been   rather\r\n\r\nemotional.   I  can understand the sentiment,  given  the\r\n\r\nstate  of  the  economy, unemployment, difficulties  that\r\n\r\npeople  are facing and the likely statutory charges  that\r\n\r\nwould come up in the months to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were to look at the rationale given by the PTC\r\n\r\non  its  decision, I would classify them into  four  main\r\n\r\ngroups.  The reasons given are, firstly, on the viability\r\n\r\nof  public  transport  companies if  the  fares  are  not\r\n\r\nincreased;   secondly,  the  CPI  +  X  formula,   giving\r\n\r\njustification  for small increases versus big  increases;\r\n\r\nthirdly,  the  issue of wages and operation  costs;  and,\r\n\r\nlastly,  the issue of productivity and quality of service\r\n\r\nand  equipment  necessary to sustain the quality  in  our\r\n\r\npublic transport service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no reasons to doubt the statement of the PTC\r\n\r\nin   saying   that  it  has  improved  \"the  process   of\r\n\r\nscrutinising  operators' bus and train accounts  and  its\r\n\r\nfinancial  performance.  Operators have been  prudent  in\r\n\r\ncontaining cost and not been profiteering at the  expense\r\n\r\nof the commuters.\"  However, the public would like to ask\r\n\r\nquestions on how the decisions on this latest fare  hikes\r\n\r\nare  arrived  at.  Hence, I believe transparency  in  its\r\n\r\ndecision-making process is vitally important, and perhaps\r\n\r\nis  lacking in this respect.  In this instance,  I  think\r\n\r\nthis opportunity is given to the Minister to explain  and\r\n\r\nto  justify  the  PTC's  decision with  respect  to  this\r\n\r\nmonitoring of key performance indicators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first reason that the viability of public\r\n\r\ntransport companies is at stake, I think this is only one\r\n\r\npart  of  the  issue.  Companies which  exist  by  public\r\n\r\ncharter  must perform certain social roles and  undertake\r\n\r\nsome  measure of social responsibility.  Of course,  they\r\n\r\nmust  run  their  business  efficiently  for  shareholder\r\n\r\nvalue.   Because they exist on public charter, they  have\r\n\r\nto  fulfill certain public objectives.  And in times like\r\n\r\nthis,  I  think  there can be merit for considering  some\r\n\r\nfactors  in  delaying the decision or  in  modifying  the\r\n\r\nrates  of  increase.   I think it  is  not  something  so\r\n\r\ncontradictory that it cannot be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanaged.  Running such a business, of course, is  not  so\r\n\r\neasy,  but balancing this role is necessary. That is  why\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  hire  the  best  management  for  the  job.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, we will be having a family of clerks to do it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the rationale on the viability of the bus\r\n\r\ntransport companies valid?  Some figures have been  given\r\n\r\njust  now.  I believe that the public transport companies\r\n\r\nconcerned here are not about to go under.  What has their\r\n\r\nperformance been up to now?  If we look at the  financial\r\n\r\nfigures,  and  some have been given just now,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  the figures justify the decision.  If we  look  at\r\n\r\nthe  return  on assets for SBS Transit for the  financial\r\n\r\nyear  ending 31st December 2001, it is 13.5%;  return  on\r\n\r\nequity  for  the same period, 17.8%; the gearing  of  the\r\n\r\ncompany, that of debt to equity, nil; net earnings, 7.3%.\r\n\r\nIf  we look at these figures, one would generally come to\r\n\r\nthe  conclusion  that SBS is reasonably sound  and  quite\r\n\r\nprofitable.    Perhaps   the  Minister   can   use   this\r\n\r\nopportunity to explain how the PTC came to the conclusion\r\n\r\nthat  viability of the public transport companies was  at\r\n\r\nstake.  If we look at the SMRT, again the return on asset\r\n\r\n(ROA) is slightly smaller, 4.6%; its return on equity  is\r\n\r\n8.3%; net earnings, $56.8 million, which is about 11%  of\r\n\r\nsales.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the ROE, in the case of the SMRT, cannot\r\n\r\nbe  so  high  because  it has such a big  infrastructural\r\n\r\nasset   to  maintain.   I  would  say  that  perhaps   in\r\n\r\nconsidering   the  financial  figures   for   these   two\r\n\r\ncompanies, it is of some merit to the Minister to explain\r\n\r\nto  us  how the PTC came to the conclusion that  the  two\r\n\r\ncompanies'  viability  are  at  stake.   Of  course,   we\r\n\r\nunderstand that SBS Transit is taking over the North-East\r\n\r\nline. And for this current year, there may be some start-up operational expenses for the first 10-11 months before\r\n\r\nthe  North-East line starts running by the  end  of  this\r\n\r\nyear.  So there could be expenses that it has to incur in\r\n\r\nthis  instance.   But  this is really  start-up  cost  of\r\n\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other group of factors that we have to look at\r\n\r\nis  the  justification given by the PCT on the  CPI  +  X\r\n\r\nformula.  I believe there\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  many ways to interpret this CPI + X formula, and  it\r\n\r\nis not exactly quite clear which is a plus and which is a\r\n\r\nminus.   What  do  I  mean?  X can be a  dummy  for  cost\r\n\r\nincreases   or   productivity  increases.    Of   course,\r\n\r\nmanagement would have to manage this part of it.  But  as\r\n\r\npresently constituted in the formula, that formula  is  a\r\n\r\njustification for the PCT to arrive at 2.2% increase.   I\r\n\r\nthink  we  have  to  differentiate  between  productivity\r\n\r\nincrease in the X and operational cost increases  in  the\r\n\r\nX.   What  do I mean?  If productivity increases  in  the\r\n\r\ntransport  companies, naturally, this increase suppresses\r\n\r\nX,  that  means  X  would have a  lower  value  to  rise.\r\n\r\nOperational costs, in terms of equipment, TV monitors  on\r\n\r\nthe  buses,  fanciful  bus-stops, air-conditioned  halls,\r\n\r\nthese  could  add to increases in the X.   So,  when  the\r\n\r\npublic  transport companies go to the PTC to justify  for\r\n\r\nthe  increase in X, is there some anomaly in the CPI +  X\r\n\r\nformula that we have to look at?  Otherwise, productivity\r\n\r\nincrease  has no incentive to gain from CPI + X,  because\r\n\r\nit  suppresses X, whereas other cost increases in putting\r\n\r\nup  equipment, fanciful features, frills that Mr Tan  Soo\r\n\r\nKhoon talked about add to the X factor, and justification\r\n\r\nfor fare adjustment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not arguing that public transport\r\n\r\ncompanies  should  not  be allowed  to  raise  fares,  as\r\n\r\nallowed by the PTC.  The question is whether this is  the\r\n\r\nright time.  I can understand that there is never a right\r\n\r\ntime for raising fares, but in times like this, when  the\r\n\r\neconomy  is  suffering from a recession, when  there  are\r\n\r\ndifficulties faced by our people, I think there has to be\r\n\r\nsome cause for concern for the public transport companies\r\n\r\nto raise fares at this stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Times are bad. We are told there is no sacred cows\r\n\r\nthat  will be left unexamined.  The GST is going up  next\r\n\r\nyear.  While we ask our people to tighten their belts,  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  should also be sensitive to the  threshold  of\r\n\r\npain   they  can  bear  in  these  uncertain  times.    I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  the Government will  not  allow  public\r\n\r\ntransport companies to raise fares next year when the GST\r\n\r\ngoes  up.   Would  it not have been better  had  the  PTC\r\n\r\ndelayed the fare\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhikes  till  January  next year, together  with  the  GST\r\n\r\nimplementation, so that it is manifestly evident  to  the\r\n\r\npublic that such an increase at that time, as opposed  to\r\n\r\nnow,  would  include  the GST increases,  which  will  be\r\n\r\nabsorbed in this current fare adjustment?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to urge the Government to bear\r\n\r\nin  mind  the views expressed by Members and to  consider\r\n\r\nthis in reviewing the work done by the PTC.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, I rise in support of the\r\n\r\nMotion.   Let me start by saying that I acknowledge  that\r\n\r\nwe  have  an  efficient public transport system  that  is\r\n\r\ncomparable to the best in the world.  And I wish  to  pay\r\n\r\ntribute  to  our  public  transport  workers  for   their\r\n\r\ndedication and hard work.  I think we owe it to these men\r\n\r\nand women who are in the public transport service for the\r\n\r\nexcellent  work that they have done.  From a rickety  bus\r\n\r\nsystem,  we now have one of the most efficient  transport\r\n\r\nsystems in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand the plight of public transport\r\n\r\nworkers  who are by no means highly-paid income  earners.\r\n\r\nProductivity of bus companies has increased, and in  line\r\n\r\nwith  our  wage  guidelines, I  think  they  should  look\r\n\r\nforward  to  some  reasonable  wage  increases.   It   is\r\n\r\ntherefore unfortunate that wage increases have been cited\r\n\r\nas  one  of  the key reasons for the increase  in  public\r\n\r\ntransport  fares.  Let me now define what I  see  as  the\r\n\r\nissue before the House today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the heart of the current debate, in my view, is\r\n\r\nthe  question  of what should be the role of  our  public\r\n\r\ntransport  companies.  The companies  see  themselves  as\r\n\r\nbusiness  entities, but Singaporeans obviously  disagree.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  see public transport companies  as  serving\r\n\r\npublic  interest, and therefore having  a  strong  social\r\n\r\nresponsibility  towards  the  public.   This  element  of\r\n\r\npublic interest and social responsibility is particularly\r\n\r\nimportant  considering  that public  transport  companies\r\n\r\nhere operate in an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenvironment, as my other colleagues have mentioned, where\r\n\r\nthere  are virtually no competitors.  This does not  mean\r\n\r\nthat  public  transport companies cannot make  money,  or\r\n\r\nshould  be operated at a loss.  The issue here is whether\r\n\r\nmaking  profits  should be the over-riding  consideration\r\n\r\nfor  public transport companies, as we have heard several\r\n\r\nspeakers  mentioning.   In other words,  the  profit  and\r\n\r\nshareholder   value  motivations  of   public   transport\r\n\r\ncompanies must be balanced against the public need for an\r\n\r\naffordable   and   efficient  public  transport   system.\r\n\r\nObviously, Sir, the public is not convinced that there is\r\n\r\na  balance in this case.  They know that last year, as we\r\n\r\nhave already heard, SBS Transit made a healthy profit  of\r\n\r\nalmost  $40  million, and a healthy return on  equity  of\r\n\r\n17.9%.  Hence, there is no danger of an imminent collapse\r\n\r\nif fares are not increased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the recent announcements on corporate tax\r\n\r\nreductions will benefit transport companies in  terms  of\r\n\r\nhigher profits.  So the public finds it bewildering  that\r\n\r\nbus companies should cite loss of revenue as a reason for\r\n\r\nits  increase  in  fares.  Sir,  as  mentioned  by  other\r\n\r\ncolleagues  as well, contrast this with the  response  of\r\n\r\ntwo  other transport operators.  When asked whether  they\r\n\r\nwould   increase  their  fares,  both  the  1,000  strong\r\n\r\nSingapore  School Transport Association and  the  CityCab\r\n\r\nand  Tibs  taxis, have said publicly that they  will  not\r\n\r\nincrease  their  fares despite their  higher  operational\r\n\r\ncosts  because of the poor economic situation.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  President of the Comfort Taxi Operators  Association\r\n\r\nsaid  in  a public interview that increasing fares  would\r\n\r\nmean  that passengers will run away, particularly in this\r\n\r\nsituation of economic hardship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, Sir, there is an issue of public\r\n\r\naccountability   here,   and   the   clarifications   and\r\n\r\nexplanations  to-date  have not  been  able  to  convince\r\n\r\npeople.   I  really hope that the Minister can give  this\r\n\r\nHouse  clearer and more incisive explanations  and  allay\r\n\r\nthe   fears   of  the  public.   I  have  the   following\r\n\r\nsuggestions to make and also some questions which I  hope\r\n\r\nthe Minister could address.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In approving fare increases, I would like to ask\r\n\r\nwhether  the  PTC  had  taken into account  the  economic\r\n\r\nsituation,  the  unemployment  rate,  and  the  increased\r\n\r\nhardship  that such a fare increase would  cause  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.   There  are  strong  sentiments  against   these\r\n\r\nincreases because many Singaporeans have lost their jobs,\r\n\r\ndo  not enjoy pay increases in many cases, and those  who\r\n\r\nare  still employed live in constant fear of losing their\r\n\r\njobs.  We may argue that only 5% are unemployed, but this\r\n\r\nfigure  is  actually  much higher  compared  to  previous\r\n\r\nyears,  and  those who are unemployed now take  a  longer\r\n\r\ntime  to  find a job.  To me, a reasonable fare  increase\r\n\r\ncannot  refer to the amount of the increase or  the  need\r\n\r\nfor  companies to earn revenue alone, but must take these\r\n\r\nfactors into consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask whether in approving the\r\n\r\nfare increase, the PTC had factored in the 2.5% reduction\r\n\r\nin  corporate  tax  which the transport  companies  would\r\n\r\nenjoy  on this year's income.  Has that been factored  in\r\n\r\nwhen the bus companies talked about loss of revenue as  a\r\n\r\nreason  for increasing fares?  The Government's objective\r\n\r\nin reducing corporate tax by 2.5% is to help companies to\r\n\r\nreduce  operational costs.  Instead of  passing  on  this\r\n\r\nbenefit   to  commuters,  it  is  unfortunate  that   the\r\n\r\ntransport companies have decided to further increase cost\r\n\r\nfor commuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on the formula of CPI+X, which\r\n\r\nmy   Parliamentary  colleague  Mr  Chay  Wai  Chuen   had\r\n\r\nmentioned just now, and to ask whether there is a need to\r\n\r\nrevisit  this formula.  I note that this formula was  set\r\n\r\nmany  years ago, but the economic environment  today  has\r\n\r\nchanged.   If companies are already making good  profits,\r\n\r\nthis  formula seems to allow companies to increase  fares\r\n\r\nso  long as there is an increase in the operating  costs.\r\n\r\nIt  gives the impression that transport companies do  not\r\n\r\nhave  to contain costs and, secondly, it guarantees  them\r\n\r\ngood profits all the time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1996, the Cost Review Committee, in its\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conclusion, said the following:\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"An affordable and highly convenient public\r\n\r\ntransport system would have to be provided to offer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  an attractive alternative to  having  their\r\n\r\nown  cars,  as  cars are likely to be very  costly  given\r\n\r\nSingapore's shortage of land.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all agree that private ownership of cars\r\n\r\nwill  become more expensive.  We also agree that too many\r\n\r\nprivate cars would clog up our roads.  So, we agree  that\r\n\r\na  better alternative will be to develop an efficient and\r\n\r\naffordable public transport system.  Public buses are  by\r\n\r\nfar the most efficient means of road transportation for a\r\n\r\nlarge numbers of commuters, particularly during the  rush\r\n\r\nhour.   If this is the case, then should not the policies\r\n\r\nthat  are in place reflect this thinking?  In particular,\r\n\r\nSir, I would like to ask the Minister to explain what  is\r\n\r\nthe rationale for imposing the ERP on public buses, which\r\n\r\nthe  bus companies have cited as being one of the reasons\r\n\r\nfor the increase in their costs.  Lest I be misconstrued,\r\n\r\nI  am  not arguing for a subsidy or subsidisation of  our\r\n\r\npublic  transport  system.   But  I  think  a  policy  is\r\n\r\ndeveloped  on  the ERP for a particular  objective  -  to\r\n\r\nprevent  clogging  of the roads; people  are  discouraged\r\n\r\nfrom  using  private cars; they have to  rely  on  public\r\n\r\ntransport unless we expect them to walk.  So I would like\r\n\r\nto  know,  and  I  am sure Singaporeans are  asking  this\r\n\r\nquestion as well, what is the rationale then for imposing\r\n\r\nthe ERP?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the transport companies have just introduced\r\n\r\ncost saving methods, such as the ez-link card, which will\r\n\r\nreduce underpayments and other forms of fare abuses.  The\r\n\r\nstrategy  of differentiating payments for those  who  use\r\n\r\nthe  ez-link  card and the normal fare card,  as  against\r\n\r\nthose  who pay cash, would also mean that there  will  be\r\n\r\nfurther  manpower savings as it will need less staff  for\r\n\r\ncash  handling.   Hence, the transport companies,  in  my\r\n\r\nview, should have waited and assessed the impact of  such\r\n\r\nmeasures  before asking for fare increases.  In fact,  it\r\n\r\nwould  have been better if the ez-link card had  been  in\r\n\r\nplace  for a number of months or even one year,  so  that\r\n\r\npeople  could switch, and therefore have some  additional\r\n\r\nsavings  by  using  the  ez-link  card,  where  the  fare\r\n\r\nincrease is much lesser.  Unfortunately, the ez-link card\r\n\r\nhas  just been introduced, I think it is less than a  few\r\n\r\nmonths,  but  immediately we now have the  fare  increase\r\n\r\nwithout\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenabling people to benefit more and assessing its impact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also note that the ez-link card requires a $3\r\n\r\ndeposit,  which  is  $1 more than the normal  fare  card.\r\n\r\nThis  by itself, in my view, will generate a fair  amount\r\n\r\nof  income  for  transport companies.  And  therefore  it\r\n\r\nmakes  it quite unbelievable that they could cite revenue\r\n\r\nloss as a basis for the increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in recent years, transport companies have been\r\n\r\nconstantly  upgrading in various areas.  The  question  I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask is: are these upgradings necessary, are\r\n\r\nthey  useful, are they needed by commuters, and  are  the\r\n\r\ncosts of these upgradings passed on to the commuters?  It\r\n\r\ndoes not really help when shortly after the bus companies\r\n\r\nannounced   about  the  setting  up  of  the  Toa   Payoh\r\n\r\nairconditioned  interchange,  fares  went  up.   In   the\r\n\r\npublic's  mind,  such costs are borne by  the  commuters,\r\n\r\nalthough  not  everyone  wants  an  air-conditioned   bus\r\n\r\ninterchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make a special appeal for\r\n\r\nfeeder bus users who are usually the HDB heartlanders.  I\r\n\r\nthink  there  is a strong argument to moderate  the  fare\r\n\r\nincrease  for feeder service as this is heavily  used  by\r\n\r\nhousewives,  retirees and students.  The  feeder  service\r\n\r\nused  to be 15 cents but now it is 80 cents.  I recall  a\r\n\r\nrecent conversation with my daughter who is in Primary 6.\r\n\r\nShe  said  that some of her friends hate  me.   And  they\r\n\r\nhated  me  because they said that \"your mother  increased\r\n\r\nthe  bus  fare from 70 cents to 80 cents\",  and  I  said,\r\n\r\n\"Please,  I  am not the bus company.  Please  explain  to\r\n\r\nyour  friends.\"   She said, \"Ya, it is very  unfair\"  but\r\n\r\nthat  is what they said.  \"You have increased the  feeder\r\n\r\nbus  service to 80 cents, by 10 cents.\"  Now that is  the\r\n\r\nsentiment  of  the people, the young, their  mothers  who\r\n\r\nwere using it, talking to them, and this is what is being\r\n\r\nreflected in the conversations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if our argument is that support and assistance\r\n\r\nto  the people must be focused and directed to those  who\r\n\r\nreally need them, then, in my view, it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappropriate  that we look into feeder service differently\r\n\r\nas  the  bulk of the users are HDB heartlanders from  the\r\n\r\nlower income group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finallly, Sir, I would like to ask whether there is\r\n\r\nany  coordination  in the increase in  fees  amongst  the\r\n\r\nvarious  Ministries  and public  service  providers.   Is\r\n\r\nanyone  monitoring and actually assessing the  cumulative\r\n\r\nimpact  of all these increases on the public?  Would  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   consider   setting  up   an   inter-Ministry\r\n\r\nCommittee to monitor and assess the cumulative impact  of\r\n\r\ncost  increases?   I fear, Sir, that  as  more  and  more\r\n\r\npublic  services are corporatised or privatised, everyone\r\n\r\nwill  decide on their own pricing policy, without  taking\r\n\r\ninto   consideration   what  impact   this   would   have\r\n\r\ncollectively on people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my earlier\r\n\r\npoint  that  public  transport  companies  are  not  just\r\n\r\ncommercial entities, but have a social responsibility and\r\n\r\nthey  must,  and will be, subject to public  scrutiny  if\r\n\r\nthey  raise their fares.  I would also like to call  upon\r\n\r\nthe Government to consider carefully before approving any\r\n\r\nfurther increases of public services or Government  rates\r\n\r\nof  charges.  Please consider the anxieties and  concerns\r\n\r\nof  people.  When I ask people nowadays how is your work.\r\n\r\nThe  answer  is invariably, \"Okay, but for now.\"   During\r\n\r\ngood  times,  when jobs are secure, people's  ability  to\r\n\r\nabsorb  shocks is better.  But when times are  bad,  with\r\n\r\nevery  price  change,  no matter how  small,  instead  of\r\n\r\ncreating a ripple, will result in a whirlpool.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the Motion, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for letting me join in\r\n\r\nthis debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me say that I am glad that we are\r\n\r\nhaving  this debate in this House, at this time.  It  has\r\n\r\nalready been raging in the media, in the coffee-shops, on\r\n\r\nthe buses and trains, for quite a while now.  So, it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood  that  we now move this debate into this  House,  to\r\n\r\ngive  MPs the chance to give voice to their feelings  and\r\n\r\ntheir concerns, the frustrations and the fears, anxieties\r\n\r\nof  their  constituents.  For this,  we  must  thank  the\r\n\r\nmovers of the Motion, Mr Tan Soo Khoon, Dr Tan Cheng Bock\r\n\r\nand  others.  This does not mean, however, that  I  agree\r\n\r\nwith the Motion, but I will come to that later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate is also important because it provides an\r\n\r\nopportunity for the Minister to explain, once again,  the\r\n\r\nrationale   for   its  policies  and   to   clarify   any\r\n\r\nmisunderstandings and to provide the facts.  And,  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant,  because this is what Members  of  this  House\r\n\r\nhave been elected to do.  To reflect sentiments from  the\r\n\r\nground,  yes,  but also to listen carefully  to  all  the\r\n\r\narguments, so as to arrive at decisions which are what we\r\n\r\nbelieve to be in the best interest of the country and our\r\n\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate is taking place amidst high public\r\n\r\ninterest  and high expectations.  Some Members feel  that\r\n\r\nthe  issues  go beyond bus fares - issues like Government\r\n\r\nnot   listening  to  the  people,  Government  not  being\r\n\r\nsympathetic,  and so on.  I would touch on  these  points\r\n\r\nlater.   But I urge Members, if we are going  to  have  a\r\n\r\nrational  and a considered debate, to remember ultimately\r\n\r\nwhat  this  debate is all about.  It is  about  our  land\r\n\r\ntransport   policy,  specifically  our  public  transport\r\n\r\npolicy.   It is about the role that it plays in improving\r\n\r\nour  quality of life and our standard of living.   It  is\r\n\r\nabout how we finance it, how we regulate it, and what are\r\n\r\nthe    role   and   responsibilities   of   the   various\r\n\r\nstakeholders.   By this, I mean not just  the  commuters,\r\n\r\nthe people, but also the service providers and the State.\r\n\r\nIn the most immediate, it is about whether fees should be\r\n\r\nincreased, fares should be increased; if so, when and  by\r\n\r\nhow much.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, first of all, state my position. I support\r\n\r\nthe  necessity  for increases in public  transport  fares\r\n\r\nprovided,  of  course, that they are properly  justified.\r\n\r\nThe  harsh  reality is this: there is no free  lunch.   I\r\n\r\nwould  elaborate  on  this  point  later.   Where  it  is\r\n\r\njustified, I further support the principle\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  it is better to have small regular increases which,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  means  increases even when the  companies  are\r\n\r\nprofitable,   as   opposed  to  large  increases   coming\r\n\r\ninfrequently, for example, when the companies are  losing\r\n\r\nmoney.   To the extent that the recent fare hikes  adhere\r\n\r\nto this principle, I support them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reassure Members of this House,\r\n\r\nincluding Mr Chiam, that this does not mean that I am not\r\n\r\nspeaking up for the common man.  Indeed, if I may  remind\r\n\r\nMembers,  if  the  PAP Government had not  acted  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of the common man, if we had let them down,  if\r\n\r\nwe  had  not  been able to demonstrate clearly  that  our\r\n\r\npolicies, sometimes not very popular, have brought them a\r\n\r\nbetter life, then we would not be in Government today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I proceed any further, let me say that it is\r\n\r\nnot  my  intention  to  justify the  increase  in  public\r\n\r\ntransport  fares.   That  is  for  the  public  transport\r\n\r\ncompanies  to do.  That is for the PTC to assess  and  to\r\n\r\nrecommend and, finally, for the Ministry of Transport  to\r\n\r\nendorse.   Neither realistically do I hope to change  the\r\n\r\nminds  of Members of this House who oppose the fare hikes\r\n\r\nor  the many commuters who are affected by this increase.\r\n\r\nBut  what I do hope to do is to shed some light  on  this\r\n\r\nissue and help to bring about a more informed debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me say that this is not the first\r\n\r\ntime  that  public transport fares have gone up.   It  is\r\n\r\nalso,  I dare say, not going to be the last time.  I  was\r\n\r\nwith  the  Ministry of Communications for 11  years  from\r\n\r\n1988  to  1999, three years as a Minister  of  State  and\r\n\r\neight years as the Minister with responsibility for  land\r\n\r\ntransport.   One  of  the most difficult  and  unpleasant\r\n\r\nthings  I  had  to  do was to allow the public  transport\r\n\r\noperators to raise their fares.  Let me assure Members of\r\n\r\nthis  House  that  no Minister for Transport,  indeed  no\r\n\r\nMinister, wants to allow any fares, fees or rates  to  go\r\n\r\nup if he can help it.  Indeed, life would be so much more\r\n\r\npleasant  and so much simpler if we did not  have  to  do\r\n\r\nunpleasant things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, as Minister for National Development, I have\r\n\r\nnot escaped having to do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunpleasant  things.  Mr Tan Soo Khoon in his speech  just\r\n\r\nnow  mentioned one of these things.  He said that HDB  is\r\n\r\nraising  carpark charges in spite of public feedback.   I\r\n\r\nhave explained in this House why HDB has to raise carpark\r\n\r\ncharges.   It  is  because HDB's mandate  is  to  provide\r\n\r\nsubsidised   public  housing.   It  is  not  to   provide\r\n\r\nsubsidised  carparks.   Any  subsidy  for  carparks  will\r\n\r\neventually, sooner or later, flow through and have to  be\r\n\r\nborne by all HDB residents, whether or not they own cars.\r\n\r\nThat  is the reason why carpark charges have to be raised\r\n\r\nin  order  to reduce the subsidy and, hopefully,  we  can\r\n\r\nclose the gap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also explained in this House, in answer to\r\n\r\nquestions  from Mr Tan, why HDB is doing so in September.\r\n\r\nThis  is  because,  in  September,  road  taxes  will  be\r\n\r\nreduced, and so we feel that it would be better  to  wait\r\n\r\nuntil  September so that HDB residents will not feel  the\r\n\r\npinch.  So, I wonder which part of my explanation was not\r\n\r\nclear  to  Mr  Tan.   He may disagree  with  the  policy,\r\n\r\nalthough  he  knows that this is not a  new  policy.   In\r\n\r\nfact, this policy was enunciated in the House when he was\r\n\r\nin  the Chair, by the former Minister, Mr Dhanabalan,  as\r\n\r\nearly as 1989.  He may also disagree with the timing, but\r\n\r\nif  not  at  the  time  when the  car  owner  is  getting\r\n\r\nsomething back from the Government, then when?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come back to the question about fare\r\n\r\nincreases.   The  first question  then  we  have  to  ask\r\n\r\nourselves is: can we avoid having to increase fares?   Is\r\n\r\nthere  another  option?  Is there another  way  of  doing\r\n\r\nthis?   Some  Members  of  this  House  have  made   some\r\n\r\nsuggestions.   Some people argued that one way  to  avoid\r\n\r\nincreasing  public transport fares is for the  Government\r\n\r\nto  step in and subsidise public transport.  This is  the\r\n\r\nsubsidy argument.  I think this argument was made  by  Mr\r\n\r\nLow  Thia  Khiang and others.  There are others who  feel\r\n\r\nthat we can bring fares down by opening up the market  to\r\n\r\nmore  competition.  Again, I think this is something that\r\n\r\nhas  been brought up by quite a few Members.  Others feel\r\n\r\nthat the public\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntransport  operators  should improve  their  productivity\r\n\r\nrather  than raising fares.  And, finally, a  few  argued\r\n\r\nthat  they  should  cut  cost by  providing  a  no-frills\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us consider each of these suggestions one\r\n\r\nby one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take subsidy first. The Government has\r\n\r\nexplained   many,  many  times  why  subsidising   public\r\n\r\ntransport  is  subsidising consumption  which,  in  turn,\r\n\r\ncreates  distortions  in demand  and  supply.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords, if you subsidise consumption, people are going  to\r\n\r\nwant  more and more, because they do not have to pay  for\r\n\r\nit.   If we start with public transport, what about other\r\n\r\nequally   essential   items,   like   water,   food   and\r\n\r\nelectricity?    Should  we  not  also   subsidise   food,\r\n\r\nelectricity  and water?  I am sure Members  are  familiar\r\n\r\nwith  the  arguments.   But,  to  me,  perhaps  the  most\r\n\r\npowerful  reason  why we should dismiss  this  option  is\r\n\r\nthat,  ultimately,  we all end up  paying  for  it.   The\r\n\r\nexperience of many countries which have gone this  route,\r\n\r\nwith  the best of intentions, mind you, end up having  to\r\n\r\nprovide for a bigger and bigger subsidy, which eventually\r\n\r\nmeans  higher taxes.  So, remember that there is no  such\r\n\r\nthing as a free lunch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the second proposal - competition. This\r\n\r\nis  a  common  belief that if only we had more  transport\r\n\r\noperators,  competition would bring  fares  down.   These\r\n\r\nsentiments are understandable.  After all, look  at  what\r\n\r\nhappened  in  the  telecommunications industry.   Let  me\r\n\r\ncaution,  however,  that it does not  necessarily  follow\r\n\r\nthat  the  same  will  happen  in  the  public  transport\r\n\r\nindustry,  because the nature of both industries  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  same.  In the 60s and the early 70s, we had a  total\r\n\r\nof  11 bus companies in Singapore.  Older Members of this\r\n\r\nHouse,  especially  those  over  50,  which  incidentally\r\n\r\ninclude   myself,  will  remember  the  situation   then.\r\n\r\nServices   were   unreliable;  buses  broke   down   very\r\n\r\nfrequently;  they  were  packed like  sardines;  and  the\r\n\r\ncompetition for passengers resulted in dangerous  driving\r\n\r\nbehaviour.   Unpopular routes were poorly served,  if  at\r\n\r\nall.   They all wanted to serve the best routes, the most\r\n\r\npopular routes.  The situation improved when the 11\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompanies  were amalgamated, first, into three companies,\r\n\r\nand  then  into one, which was called SBS in 1973.   Even\r\n\r\nthen,  the Government had to take the unprecedented  step\r\n\r\nof  seconding  a  team  of civil  servants  from  various\r\n\r\nMinistries  to  help manage SBS and to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\npublic  transport system, which was an essential part  of\r\n\r\nthe system, of the whole infrastructure of Singapore, did\r\n\r\nnot  collapse.   I was one of those who was  seconded  to\r\n\r\nSBS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the merger, we were able to rationalise bus\r\n\r\nroutes,  decentralise  repairs and  maintenance,  and  to\r\n\r\nachieve economies of scale for the purchase of new  buses\r\n\r\nand  spare  parts.   Service conditions  of  bus  workers\r\n\r\nimproved  significantly.  New productivity measures  such\r\n\r\nas  double deckers and one-man operation were introduced.\r\n\r\nAs  a result of this, service quality went up, fares were\r\n\r\nheld  steady  for  many years while SBS  was  financially\r\n\r\nviable.   The  final stage in this transformation  was  a\r\n\r\nsuccessful  listing of the company.  As  a  result,  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   who   were  bus  commuters   also   became\r\n\r\nshareholders of SBS.  In a sense, SBS became some sort of\r\n\r\na  cooperative  with widespread shareholdings  among  bus\r\n\r\nworkers as well as commuters.  Over time, the shares went\r\n\r\nup  in  value; so, many commuters decided to take profit.\r\n\r\nIt was a win-win situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1980s, competition was reintroduced in some\r\n\r\nform  when  licences  were  given  to  Trans-Island   Bus\r\n\r\nServices  (TIBS) to operate bus services in the  northern\r\n\r\npart of Singapore.  With this move, there was now a basis\r\n\r\nfor  comparison  of  performance  and  some  competition,\r\n\r\nalthough not direct.  Supplementary bus services provided\r\n\r\nby  school  buses  were  also  introduced  to  complement\r\n\r\ncertain routes at peak hours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the situation today? Has the bus service\r\n\r\nimproved today, compared to the yesteryears?  Based on my\r\n\r\nown experience then and now, I can say without hesitation\r\n\r\nthat  it  has improved by leaps and bounds.  You look  at\r\n\r\nthe  buses that are running on the roads today.  I  still\r\n\r\nremember the bone-shakers we had in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n70s.  They were hot and stuffy.  They were very difficult\r\n\r\nto  drive and for the drivers, it was not a very pleasant\r\n\r\nthing  to drive SBS buses.  I know because I did take  my\r\n\r\nClass  4  licence  on one of those old bone-shakers.   At\r\n\r\nthat  time,  I wondered whether we could ever afford  the\r\n\r\nlovely buses that we saw in Europe and in other developed\r\n\r\ncities.  Today, our commuters are able to enjoy the  same\r\n\r\nstandard  of  buses as the ones we see  running  in  most\r\n\r\ncities  in  developed  countries  -  airconditioned,  low\r\n\r\nsteps, sturdy, automatic transmission power steering, and\r\n\r\nso on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not suggesting that public transport\r\n\r\noperators  today have no more room for improvement.   Far\r\n\r\nfrom  it.   There  are still too many lapses  of  service\r\n\r\nwhich  we cannot and should not condone.  They should  be\r\n\r\nmore  responsive to commuters' request for new  services.\r\n\r\nService  attitude of some drivers can be improved.   More\r\n\r\nbuses  on  some routes would be welcomed.  But  like  all\r\n\r\nthings, let us see their performance in perspective.  Let\r\n\r\nus give credit where credit is due.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I relate this to illustrate the point that\r\n\r\ncompetition  and  having more bus companies  is  not  the\r\n\r\nmagic solution, the panacea to our problem.  Indeed,  the\r\n\r\nopposite  can be true that a well-regulated monopoly,  or\r\n\r\nduopoly, with some competition at the fringes can be  the\r\n\r\nbetter solution.  This has been borne out not only by our\r\n\r\nown  experience but that of places, like Hong Kong, where\r\n\r\nbus services are also not subsidised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about productivity? Can transport operators\r\n\r\nincrease their productivity further and not have to raise\r\n\r\nbus fares?  The answer must surely be yes.  But I believe\r\n\r\nthat the huge productivity gains of the past, such as the\r\n\r\nones  through the use of high capacity buses, like double\r\n\r\ndeckers  and articulated buses, like the introduction  of\r\n\r\none-man operation (OMO), are no longer repeatable,  which\r\n\r\nmeans that the fare increases can no longer be held  down\r\n\r\nfor as long as it had in the past.  Nevertheless, the PTC\r\n\r\nshould  continue  to insist that productivity  is  a  key\r\n\r\ndeterminant of any request to raise fares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, what about cutting down on the frills, a so-called no-frill service. The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassumption  here  is that by removing the  frills  -  the\r\n\r\nairconditioned interchanges and TV on buses - cost can be\r\n\r\nreduced so that fares do not have to go up.  Sir, I  know\r\n\r\nfor a fact that the airconditioned interchange that is co-located with the HDB hub at Toa Payoh Town Centre is paid\r\n\r\nfor  by LTA, and not by SBS.  I am also told that the  TV\r\n\r\nsets  on  buses are paid for by advertisers, and  not  by\r\n\r\nSBS.   So,  this way of cutting costs is out since  costs\r\n\r\nare not incurred by the bus operator in the first place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about other cost-cutting measures? The surest\r\n\r\nway  to  cut  costs is to lower the level of service,  in\r\n\r\nother words, to reduce the number of routes or the number\r\n\r\nof  buses  plying certain routes.  Are commuters prepared\r\n\r\nto  wait  10 minutes when they are now waiting 5 minutes?\r\n\r\nOr  are they prepared to wait 30 minutes, instead  of  15\r\n\r\nminutes,  during off-peak?  Are they prepared  to  endure\r\n\r\nmore  crowded trains?  I doubt that commuters will accept\r\n\r\nthis.  And I do not blame them.  We have come to enjoy  a\r\n\r\nhigh   standard  of  living  which  must  not  be   going\r\n\r\nbackwards.  But at the same time, we must be prepared  to\r\n\r\npay  a  reasonable price for a reasonable service because\r\n\r\nthere is no such thing as a free lunch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue boils down then to what is a reasonable\r\n\r\nservice.   Is  10  minutes reasonable?   Is  walking  200\r\n\r\nmetres to the nearest bus stop reasonable?  Is having  to\r\n\r\nchange  buses to arrive at one's designation  reasonable,\r\n\r\nand  so  on  and so forth?  If you ask people, they  will\r\n\r\ngive  you various answers.  So who decides?  And we  have\r\n\r\nplaced this responsibility on the PTC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, what is a reasonable fare? Should we peg\r\n\r\nfares to affordability, like we do for HDB flats?  Again,\r\n\r\nif  you ask different people, opinions will differ.   And\r\n\r\nagain, we have given this unenviable task to the PTC.  We\r\n\r\nsaid  to  them, do a performance audit of the  operators,\r\n\r\ncheck   the   accounts,  make  sure  they  are  operating\r\n\r\nefficiently,  let them earn reasonable profits,  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  reinvest in the business, expand, improve  the\r\n\r\nlevel of service.  Like Dr Wang,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not envy the Chairman of PTC and its members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have attempted to establish that,\r\n\r\nlike  many  issues  facing Singapore as  a  country  with\r\n\r\nlimited  resources,  there  are  no  easy  solutions,  no\r\n\r\npainless   options.   In  this  case,  we  cannot   avoid\r\n\r\nincreases  in bus and MRT fares from time to  time.   But\r\n\r\nwhat  we can and must do is to look for the least painful\r\n\r\nsolution if there is such a thing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that we have the framework in place. The\r\n\r\nPTC  is  the  body that is entrusted to regulate  service\r\n\r\nlevels and fares.  I believe that the principle of  small\r\n\r\nincreases  is  the  better way to go, rather  than  large\r\n\r\nincreases.   But within this framework, I  think  we  can\r\n\r\nstill  make further improvements.  And one that  I  would\r\n\r\nsupport  is  the  call  by some  Members  to  expand  the\r\n\r\nrepresentation  of the PTC to include  members  from  all\r\n\r\nwalks  of life.  And I see no reason why this should  not\r\n\r\ninclude some Members of this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications for fare increases can then be subject\r\n\r\nto  greater  scrutiny and, if it is passed,  it  can  get\r\n\r\nbetter  acceptance.  Now, I realise that this  suggestion\r\n\r\ndoes  not mean that future fare increases will not  be  a\r\n\r\nproblem.   It  will still be so.  People  will  still  be\r\n\r\nunhappy.   Questions must still be asked but,  hopefully,\r\n\r\nwe  can  shed more light rather than heat in  the  public\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to this fare hike, as I said at the\r\n\r\noutset, I am not in favour of reviewing the decision.  It\r\n\r\nhas been made, we should abide by it.  But we should also\r\n\r\nrecognise that there are people who will be hard  hit  by\r\n\r\nit, especially those who have just been retrenched or are\r\n\r\nstill  jobless,  who  have suffered pay  cuts,  who  have\r\n\r\nschool-going children who depend on public transport.  We\r\n\r\nshould provide help to this group of people.  And indeed,\r\n\r\nwe have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case Members have forgotten, we still have the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Downturn Relief Scheme (EDRS).  Every month  in\r\n\r\nmy  constituency, my CCC considers and approves  hundreds\r\n\r\nof  applications for the EDRS, amounting to a few hundred\r\n\r\nthousand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndollars.  And the same, I am sure, is happening in  every\r\n\r\nother  constituency.   We  also  have  various  financial\r\n\r\nassistance schemes within each of our constituency.  This\r\n\r\nis  in  addition to the many support programmes, such  as\r\n\r\nthe Rental and Utilities Assistance Scheme, introduced in\r\n\r\nthe  off-Budget  package  last year,  sharing  of  Budget\r\n\r\nsurpluses  through the New Singapore Shares, and  so  on.\r\n\r\nSo,  it is quite wrong to suggest that the Government  is\r\n\r\nnot  aware  of the problems faced by those who have  been\r\n\r\nhard hit by this fare increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, if nothing else, this debate can serve to\r\n\r\nhighlight that such schemes are available, and if  anyone\r\n\r\nwishes  to avail himself of these schemes, he can do  so.\r\n\r\nIf  he  is not familiar, he can go and see his MP and  he\r\n\r\nwill be able to advise him where to get help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say that we have\r\n\r\nappointed  the  PTC  to  regulate  the  public  transport\r\n\r\nindustry, its level of fares and its services.   We  have\r\n\r\nset   the  framework  for  it  to  deliberate  on   these\r\n\r\napplications.   These  are men and  women  whom  we  have\r\n\r\nappointed,  and I believe that they have exercised  their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  to the best of their abilities.   Their\r\n\r\nrecommendation  has been endorsed by the Ministry,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure, after much deliberation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not support the\r\n\r\nmotion  standing  in the name of Mr  Tan  Soo  Khoon  and\r\n\r\nothers,  as it calls for a review of the PTC's  decision.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do support the suggestion by Members  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse that we should review the composition of the PTC in\r\n\r\norder to improve the decision-making process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thank you for your indulgence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have\r\n\r\nyour  permission to clarify some of the points raised  by\r\n\r\nthe Minister?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Clarification, yes.

He said that I am asking\r\n\r\nfor subsidy for public transport.  Indeed, I am not.   In\r\n\r\nmy speech, I said that we are not asking for subsidy, but\r\n\r\nmerely   questioning  why  should  public  transportation\r\n\r\ncompanies  make  money  by  providing  public  transport.\r\n\r\nShould  the  Government  not look  at  another  model  of\r\n\r\nproviding  public transport?  At least, it could  have  a\r\n\r\nfederation of transportation companies to run the  public\r\n\r\ntransport  services on a cost recovery basis,  and  treat\r\n\r\npublic transport as a public service.  I am not saying to\r\n\r\nsubsidise,  but  to recover cost.  Why should  they  make\r\n\r\nmoney,  and  should it be profit-oriented  for  providing\r\n\r\nsuch a service?  Where is the justification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of\r\n\r\nsubsidy  has  indeed been raised as one of  the  ways  of\r\n\r\navoiding a fare increase, and the arguments that  I  made\r\n\r\nare  against this idea of subsidy.  Mr Low's point  about\r\n\r\nhaving  the  public bus transport service as  a  not-for-profit  service is an option.  But then, again,  when  it\r\n\r\ncomes  to  not for profit, there is still the element  of\r\n\r\nhaving  to  provide for the cost, and there is still  the\r\n\r\nneed  for the fares to be increased from time to time  to\r\n\r\ntake  care of increases in cost.  So, even if there is  a\r\n\r\nnot-for-profit model, as Mr Low suggested, that does  not\r\n\r\nmean that the fares will never go up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Another clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\nDoes the Minister agree that the moment the profit factor\r\n\r\nis removed, there will be less controversy, even if there\r\n\r\nis a need for the fares to be increased?  It is justified\r\n\r\nbased on why there is a need to increase, rather than  on\r\n\r\nreturn  on equity or return on capital investment.   Will\r\n\r\nit be better?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not a clarification, Mr Low. It\r\n\r\nis a question.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Nominated Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the speakers before me have  done  a  good\r\n\r\njob,  reflecting the public's unhappiness.   But  I  must\r\n\r\nstill  go on and have my say because more voice will  add\r\n\r\nto  the  strength and support for this Motion.   Minister\r\n\r\nMah has disagreed with certain issues, one of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  is  subsidy.  I disagree and  I  do  not  buy  his\r\n\r\nargument for not subsidising.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are an active society. This Parliament House is\r\n\r\nnot static.  We argue and debate over an issue to come to\r\n\r\na conclusion and, for every case, we decide whether it is\r\n\r\nworth  the  subsidy.   So,  it is  not  that  because  we\r\n\r\nsubsidise public transport, we are going to subsidise for\r\n\r\nmany  other  issues that come along the way.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink that is the case.  Every case has its own merit  to\r\n\r\nbe debated in Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it was not too long ago when this\r\n\r\nGovernment boasted about more good years, more jobs, more\r\n\r\ninvestments,  more  wealth-creation  and  more   economic\r\n\r\nprosperity  for Singaporeans.  This Government  has  gone\r\n\r\nfurther to boast about reaching to the Swiss standard  of\r\n\r\nliving  and about a world-class transport system.   These\r\n\r\ndays, we can only hear the Ministers telling Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  lower their expectations, not to be too fussy and  to\r\n\r\naccept   lower  paying  jobs.   More  retrenchments   are\r\n\r\nexpected to be on the way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what happened to those promises? What happened\r\n\r\nto  the  PAP's \"More Good Years\"?  Where are all the  new\r\n\r\njobs  that  this  Government  promised  during  the  last\r\n\r\nelection?  The Government claims that we have reached the\r\n\r\nSwiss standard of living.  I do not see it at all.   What\r\n\r\nI,  and many other Singaporeans see, are rising costs and\r\n\r\ncharges.  The economy is in recession.  Yet, the cost  of\r\n\r\nliving  is  going up.  The biggest culprit creating  this\r\n\r\nrising  cost  is  the  Government  and  Government-linked\r\n\r\npublic  service providers.  If this is the notion of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  Swiss standard of living,  then  I  believe\r\n\r\nmany   Singaporeans  would  rather  not  have  it.    Are\r\n\r\nSingaporeans being conned?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government boasts that we have a world-class\r\n\r\ntransport  system.  Again, like many Singaporeans,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  see it.  The newspaper reports that the LRT in  Choa\r\n\r\nChu  Kang constantly breaks down.  Many commuters staying\r\n\r\nin outlying areas have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto change a few buses or trains just to get to work every\r\n\r\nmorning.   During peak hours, the buses  and  trains  are\r\n\r\nconstantly packed like sardines.  Sometimes you  have  to\r\n\r\nskip  and  miss  a  few  buses or trains  before  finally\r\n\r\nboarding one.  Is this the Government's idea of  a  world\r\n\r\nclass  transport  system?  I wonder.  Has  the  Transport\r\n\r\nMinister ever squeezed in with the crowd during peak hour\r\n\r\ntraffic?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is anything in a class of its own about our\r\n\r\ntransport system, it is what Singaporeans pay  to  own  a\r\n\r\ncar.   The  Government discourages car use, and wants  to\r\n\r\nencourage  Singaporeans to take  public  transport.   But\r\n\r\nwhat  could  be  worse than being forced to  take  public\r\n\r\ntransport?  It is being told that the public needs to pay\r\n\r\nmore  money to these public transport operators  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  maintain their profit margins.  Otherwise,  we\r\n\r\nare  told, these monopolies will lose money and commuters\r\n\r\nwill be worse off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public transport operators are the only two\r\n\r\nlisted   companies  in  Singapore,  whose   profits   and\r\n\r\nshareholders the Government indirectly protects, and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment happens to be the biggest shareholder of  one.\r\n\r\nBy  listing  these  transport operators,  the  Government\r\n\r\ncannot  be allowed to evade its social responsibility  to\r\n\r\nprovide  efficient and affordable public transport.  Just\r\n\r\nlike security, education and healthcare, public transport\r\n\r\nis  one  of  the  key  services that  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nrequired to provide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government is not willing to subsidise the\r\n\r\ncost  of  providing  this  essential  service,  then  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should seriously look into liberalising  this\r\n\r\ntransport   sector   and  allow  for  more   competition.\r\n\r\nCitizens pay taxes so that the Government can provide for\r\n\r\nthese  essential services.  It is not to give higher  pay\r\n\r\nand  higher  bonuses.   The  Government  cannot  regulate\r\n\r\npublic  services, demand high profits for the  operators,\r\n\r\ncontinue   to   collect  taxes  and  shirk   its   social\r\n\r\nresponsibilities, all at the same time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this and consistent future fare hikes may not\r\n\r\nmean  much  to the well-rewarded high income-earners  and\r\n\r\ncivil\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservants, the bulk of aged low income families will  have\r\n\r\nmore difficulties in trying to make ends meet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the question on the kind of profit\r\n\r\nmargins  these operators want, is earning more  than  $50\r\n\r\nmillion every year not good enough?  When times are good,\r\n\r\nand everyone is making a lot of money, nobody would be so\r\n\r\npissed  off  with a fare hike.  Commuters can accept  and\r\n\r\ntolerate it.  But now ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chia, I suggest you not use the\r\n\r\nwords \"pissed off\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Yes, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the economy is so bad. So many people are\r\n\r\nbeing retrenched, and many more are having their pay  cut\r\n\r\nor  frozen.   Many  businesses are  suffering.  Transport\r\n\r\noperators  are not the only ones.  So, why  should  their\r\n\r\nprofit  margins  be  protected at all?   These  transport\r\n\r\nmonopolies cannot simply go to the public ATM - which  is\r\n\r\nall  the  transport commuters - and press them  for  more\r\n\r\nmonies  when their profits drop.  Nobody will  dispute  a\r\n\r\nfare  hike  if there is a genuine need.  But this  latest\r\n\r\nincrease is clearly just aimed at boosting their  already\r\n\r\nfat  profit  margins.   At such a  difficult  time,  wide\r\n\r\nmargins are unrealistic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the public's many protests and unhappiness,\r\n\r\nthe  Government went on to support this hike.  Why is the\r\n\r\nGovernment so insensitive and uncaring?  Is it taking the\r\n\r\npublic's  overwhelming support at the last  election  for\r\n\r\ngranted?  This current fare hike is so revolting, because\r\n\r\nthe operators have yet to explain specifically why it  is\r\n\r\nneeded satisfactorily.  Let us not talk about previous or\r\n\r\nfuture  hikes.   Given  current circumstances,  with  SBS\r\n\r\nTransit and SMRT still highly profitable, why should this\r\n\r\nhike  be  allowed  to  take  place  at  all?   What   we,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, really need and want to know are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. How has this profit margin been worked out?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Is this a reasonable margin in these recession\r\n\r\ntimes when everybody is feeling squeezed?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. What are the specific investments these\r\n\r\noperators have actually made to justify the fee hike?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Are these investments what the commuters really\r\n\r\nneed?   If not, why should they be made to pay for  these\r\n\r\nunnecessary extras like expensive plasma screen TVs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. More importantly, have the operators improved\r\n\r\nthe  connectivity and frequency of buses and trains to  a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory level?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Finally, what will happen if they do not raise\r\n\r\nthe fares this time round? Will they really go bankrupt?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, show us how these operators do their sums.\r\n\r\nLet  us  see where the major expenditures go.  The nation\r\n\r\nis  certainly  not  short of accountants  and  interested\r\n\r\nindividuals  to  scrutinise  their  numbers.   This  hike\r\n\r\nshould  not take place just because the Public  Transport\r\n\r\nCouncil,  whose  members have a vested  interest,  thinks\r\n\r\nthat it is all right to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I support the call to review and reject\r\n\r\nthis  latest fare hike. Why must the public pay more when\r\n\r\nthere  is  a recession?  The PTC needs to re-examine  its\r\n\r\nformula on how it approves fare increases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now move on to urge the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to ensure that the prices of public  services\r\n\r\nare  not  unreasonably increased during  these  difficult\r\n\r\ntimes.   Just  eight  months after the  November  General\r\n\r\nElection,  Singaporeans have been  informed  of  so  many\r\n\r\nincreases in fees and charges for public services.  Since\r\n\r\nMay,  refuse  collection fees have gone  up.   Just  last\r\n\r\nweek, transport fares and utility fees have also gone up.\r\n\r\nCome  September, it will be carpark charges.  Then, maybe\r\n\r\ntelephone  charges.  Soon, more ERP.   Then,  night  ERP.\r\n\r\nNext January, we will have GST.  What else?  And what  is\r\n\r\nnext?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that many Government-related agencies and\r\n\r\ncompanies  are upping their fees and charges to  increase\r\n\r\ntheir profits in this difficult time, before the GST\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincrease  sets  in.  It was recently announced  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment wants Singapore to be a broadcasting hub.  The\r\n\r\nMedia  21  Report sought additional funding  for  various\r\n\r\ninitiatives to make this a reality.  These are additional\r\n\r\npublic  investments.  The question is:  are  we  then  to\r\n\r\nexpect  higher TV and radio licence fees soon  to  recoup\r\n\r\nthese  additional investments?  On Sunday, we  read  that\r\n\r\nthe  CEO  of the zoo had resigned.  One reason  cited  is\r\n\r\nthat he is not good in financial matters.  A new CEO with\r\n\r\ngood  business figures will be selected to  replace  him.\r\n\r\nThe  question is: are we going to see a hike in  the  zoo\r\n\r\nentrance fees soon?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Government and Government-linked companies\r\n\r\nleading  the way to price increases, it is quite  certain\r\n\r\nthat  private  businesses will follow  soon  to  jack  up\r\n\r\nprices to maintain their profit margins.  Their reasoning\r\n\r\nis  simple:  if the Government can do it, why  not  they?\r\n\r\nAlready,  a  number  of private car-park  operators  have\r\n\r\nannounced  that  they  are  raising  their  charges  too.\r\n\r\nParking  charges at various shopping centres  and  office\r\n\r\nbuildings are likely to go up by as much as 20 cents  per\r\n\r\nhour.   Soon,  to  cover  their rising  operating  costs,\r\n\r\nhawkers and small business operators are going to jack up\r\n\r\nprices  too.   Thanks, but no thanks to  the  Government,\r\n\r\nprices will spiral up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily, Singaporeans have a Committee to Combat\r\n\r\nProfiteering.  It is headed by the hon. Member  from  Joo\r\n\r\nChiat.  This Committee can check hawkers and retailers if\r\n\r\nthey  increase prices unreasonably.  However, it  has  no\r\n\r\npower  to  challenge  the  Government  and  these  public\r\n\r\nservice providers if they profiteer.  The Government  and\r\n\r\nthe  GLCs are clearly the biggest culprit in this  series\r\n\r\nof  price hikes, not the small hawkers and retailers  who\r\n\r\nare suffering from price increases themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I would like to quote a recent Straits\r\n\r\nTimes forum page writer:\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"While we may not have much choice about who sells\r\n\r\nus (the) services, we can choose which countries\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto live in..

They just  want  a\r\n\r\nplace  where  they can work hard, make  enough  money  to\r\n\r\nstart  and  build  a family, and retire without  worrying\r\n\r\nabout \"money no enough\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government can try to be a lot nicer and more\r\n\r\ncaring  by  not  being  too greedy  and  sucking  up  the\r\n\r\npeople's  money  too  much.  This is  all  we  ask.   The\r\n\r\npeople's  welfare is paramount for, without  them,  there\r\n\r\ncan be no nation.  Can the Ministers please take heed?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, thank you for\r\n\r\nallowing me to join in.  Frankly, I was a bit confused at\r\n\r\nthe   direction  the  NCMP  was  going  as  I  could  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  some  of  the  things  he  was  saying.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  I  am  surprised that the NCMP feels  that  the\r\n\r\ntransport system is not world-class.  I am sure  that  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  really  mean  it, as  we  do  indeed  have  an\r\n\r\nexcellent  transport  system not matched  by  many.   The\r\n\r\nissue at hand that we are debating today is - and this is\r\n\r\na  question  he should really ask - at what cost  are  we\r\n\r\nhaving such a world-class transport system?  This is  the\r\n\r\nissue that he should have focused on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point the NCMP added to the Motion - which\r\n\r\nagain  confused  me - was that he wanted  to  reject  the\r\n\r\nlatest fare increases in addition to the review question.\r\n\r\nWhile  I  can understand the NCMP's desire to  have  more\r\n\r\npower  than  what  he already has - as an  MP  without  a\r\n\r\nconstituency - it is equally important to understand  the\r\n\r\nmechanics of the whole process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the PTC, as I understand it, does not report to\r\n\r\nParliament  and we should, therefore, not be  unrealistic\r\n\r\nabout  what  we can or cannot do.  In the  case  of  this\r\n\r\nMotion,  we  really  have  to  urge  the  PTC,  and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for that matter, to initiate the  process  to\r\n\r\nreview,  if we carry through the Motion - and we are  not\r\n\r\nin a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nposition to reject the increases or the decisions of  the\r\n\r\nPTC  -  instead  of  having  a disruptive  process  where\r\n\r\nParliament  gets in the way of the Government  and  other\r\n\r\nagencies,  I  feel that the current process  works  well.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  there is a lot more value for  our  Members\r\n\r\ntoday  in  this debate to address the root cause  of  the\r\n\r\nissue  of what caused the fare increases this time round.\r\n\r\nHopefully, by understanding the root causes, we  can  put\r\n\r\nin  place systematic changes and new processes which will\r\n\r\nbe  acceptable  to all of us, and I hope  to  talk  about\r\n\r\nthese during my speech today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion in the name of Mr Tan Soo\r\n\r\nKhoon.   I  have  a few issues with the  way  the  Public\r\n\r\nTransport  Council operates, and the operating  principle\r\n\r\nit  uses  to  determine and approve fare  increases  when\r\n\r\nrequested by the transport operators.  I believe that the\r\n\r\nissue  with the recent fare increases lies not  with  the\r\n\r\nPTC  alone, but also with the Government, which sets  the\r\n\r\nagenda and the charter of the PTC.  Until and unless  the\r\n\r\nGovernment steps in and changes the charter of the PTC, I\r\n\r\nam  afraid  that  we  will continue  to  see  problematic\r\n\r\ndecisions, as we have experienced this time round.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with Dr Wang that the PTC was just\r\n\r\ndoing  its  job,  and  a  job that  is  designed  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   I  feel  that it  is  about  time  that  we\r\n\r\nreviewed  the charter, which was established in 1987  and\r\n\r\nmodified  about 10 years later.  Similarly, I would  like\r\n\r\nto  see  changes in the composition of the PTC,  as  have\r\n\r\nbeen  suggested  by many Members, to better  reflect  the\r\n\r\nviews   of  consumers  and  the  public  who  use  public\r\n\r\ntransport  daily, and also to have members who understand\r\n\r\nthe mechanics of business a lot better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, on the charter. I would like to urge\r\n\r\nthe   Government,  and  particularly  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nTransport,  to  take the opportunity to  learn  from  the\r\n\r\nmistake  this  time round and to put in place  a  revised\r\n\r\ncharter  and set out new objectives and guidelines  which\r\n\r\ncan  better  serve  the purpose of the commuting  public.\r\n\r\nThe view many people have right now is that the PTC seems\r\n\r\nto be a body which watches over the interest of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  transport  companies more than the public.   Why  is\r\n\r\nthis  so?  I believe this is because of the charter,  the\r\n\r\nroles  and  the guidelines which the Ministry  has  given\r\n\r\nthem.   So,  in a way, it is not fair to put  the  entire\r\n\r\nblame  on  the  PTC.   They were  basically  designed  to\r\n\r\nfulfill  certain objectives, as they have been doing  all\r\n\r\nalong.   Times  have changed and we have to  change  with\r\n\r\ntimes.   We  have to therefore change the  objectives  to\r\n\r\nbetter  achieve the results that we want to  achieve  for\r\n\r\nall  the stakeholders.  The stakeholders in this case are\r\n\r\nthe  public, the Government and the transport  companies.\r\n\r\nSuch  a  revised charter needs to be better  balanced  to\r\n\r\nplace  a heavier weightage on the impact on the commuting\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the things which need to be reviewed include\r\n\r\nthe  process  through  which  decisions  are  made.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  can I ask what are the benchmarks the  PTC  and\r\n\r\nthe    Government   use   to   determine   the   required\r\n\r\nprofitability  level  for  the transport  companies?   We\r\n\r\ncannot use internal data alone, because we have an almost\r\n\r\nmonopoly  situation  for  all  our  transport  companies,\r\n\r\nespecially if we look at the way routes are allocated  to\r\n\r\neach  operator.   It  is not even a  duopoly.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nmonopoly,  especially  if  we consider  the  Government's\r\n\r\nunwillingness  to  open  up  the  transport   sector   to\r\n\r\ncompetition.  Frankly, I wonder why the Government is  so\r\n\r\nreluctant to allow more competitors, as many Members have\r\n\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  also  disagree  with the Minister  for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment's argument that competition will not work  in\r\n\r\nthis   case.    Just   like  transport   companies,   the\r\n\r\ntelecommunication   industry   too    has    had    heavy\r\n\r\ninfrastructural  costs.   If  competition  works  in  the\r\n\r\ntelecommunication industry, why can it not  work  in  the\r\n\r\ntransport  companies?  About 15-20 years  ago,  we  would\r\n\r\nnever have believed that competition would have been good\r\n\r\nfor  telecommunications, and the results have shown  that\r\n\r\nit  has  worked for all of us.  The Minister also  quoted\r\n\r\ntwo  extreme examples.  One was of the rickety  buses  of\r\n\r\nthe  1960s,  which I also rode on.  It was  a  completely\r\n\r\nchaotic environment - no proper rules and regulations, no\r\n\r\nregulators, or perhaps no good\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregulators.   Then,  we  have  the  other  extreme  of  a\r\n\r\nmonopoly situation today, which seems to have worked.  It\r\n\r\nis arguable whether competition will or will not work.  I\r\n\r\nthink we should experiment with this, by introducing  one\r\n\r\nmore  transport company and see the results.   We  should\r\n\r\nnot, just because it has worked in the past, believe that\r\n\r\nchanges are not going to be good for us in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to see benchmarks being used with\r\n\r\noperators  from other countries in the way the PTC  makes\r\n\r\nits  decision on setting new prices.  In this respect,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  ask  the Minister:   what  is  the  pre-determined profit level that we have to set for transport\r\n\r\ncompanies, before which they are allowed to ask for  fare\r\n\r\nincreases?  In fact, I would like to ask if there  should\r\n\r\neven be a profit criterion in determining fare increases,\r\n\r\nperhaps  in  determining other  things.   Frankly,  I  am\r\n\r\namazed  that  we  are giving so much  of  protection  for\r\n\r\npublicly listed companies.  It is precisely this type  of\r\n\r\ninvolvement that creates an uneven playing field for many\r\n\r\nmore  private  sector  players.   How  I  wish  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  also provides the industry I am operating  in\r\n\r\nthat  type of protection, so that I do not have to  worry\r\n\r\nabout  profitability  and I do not have  to  worry  about\r\n\r\ndownturns.  My point is that sometimes, companies have to\r\n\r\nface  the real situation of profitability, and losses  at\r\n\r\nsome  other  time.  We would probably  have  a  lot  more\r\n\r\nstronger companies and in that process, create a lot more\r\n\r\nefficiency in the whole system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is related to the charter which I\r\n\r\nam  not convinced that the PTC has done a thorough job in\r\n\r\nreviewing   the  cost  reduction  efforts  of   transport\r\n\r\ncompanies  before allowing them to increase fare  prices.\r\n\r\nThe excuse that the companies use is that they are seeing\r\n\r\nincreases  in cost and want to be compensated  for  these\r\n\r\nincreases.   My argument is that in the last  two  years,\r\n\r\ncompanies  in Singapore should have seen a reduction  and\r\n\r\nnot  an increase in cost. Given the recession, wage costs\r\n\r\nshould have come down. The Government allowed rentals\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto come down, property tax is down and many other charges\r\n\r\ncame  down, as a result of the recession that we saw  two\r\n\r\nyears  ago.  So where are the cost increases coming from?\r\n\r\nI  therefore  repeat  that I am not  convinced  that  the\r\n\r\nreview  was  thorough  enough.  Such  a  situation  would\r\n\r\ncreate  inefficient  and unproductive  companies  and  we\r\n\r\nshould  not accept these things.  Even if costs may  have\r\n\r\nincreased, the PTC should have convinced itself that  the\r\n\r\ntransport companies did do their best in putting in place\r\n\r\nserious   cost  reduction  and  productivity  improvement\r\n\r\nmeasures before agreeing to allow any fare increases.  In\r\n\r\nexamples  in  my industry, in a recession like  this,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to talk about cost reduction, in the range  of  20-30%,  and even 40% sometimes just to survive.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nsee  the transport companies having shown they have tried\r\n\r\nto do that.  In the review of the charter, we must insist\r\n\r\non  a  better methodology to review cost increases,  cost\r\n\r\nreduction, productivity improvement, and set a  benchmark\r\n\r\nof  performance  before  any  transport  company  becomes\r\n\r\neligible for fare increases.  The fact that all transport\r\n\r\ncompanies  are allowed to increase fares in  tandem  this\r\n\r\ntime  round  also  puts  to question  the  assessment  of\r\n\r\noperating cost impact for each of the companies, the fact\r\n\r\nthat  we allow all of them to increase at the same  time.\r\n\r\nI cannot believe that both companies have similar rate of\r\n\r\ncost increases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is one of composition of the PTC.\r\n\r\nI  feel  that we should have more people from the private\r\n\r\nsector  involved,  particularly  industry  captains  from\r\n\r\ndifferent  industries, especially those  who  face  stiff\r\n\r\ncompetition in their industry. Such people would be  able\r\n\r\nto  ask better questions related to cost increases,  cost\r\n\r\nreduction  efforts and productivity improvements,  return\r\n\r\non  investments and other financial measures to determine\r\n\r\nthe  true  efficiency of the transport  companies  before\r\n\r\nagreeing to any fare increases.  In my opinion, with  the\r\n\r\nheavy Government representation and the representation of\r\n\r\nthe  transport companies, this important role  cannot  be\r\n\r\nwell-performed.  So, I call on the Government  to  review\r\n\r\nthe  composition of the Council as soon  as  possible  so\r\n\r\nthat this would give confidence to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans that their interest would be taken  care  of\r\n\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue I have is on how this round of\r\n\r\nincreases took place.  It is my impression that the  fare\r\n\r\nincreases, which the PTC just approved, seem to have been\r\n\r\na  result of a set piece of standard operating procedures\r\n\r\n(SOPs)  which  the Government seems to have adopted  many\r\n\r\nyears  ago.   The  people responsible in executing  these\r\n\r\nSOPs just went on to implement this set piece without due\r\n\r\nconsideration  of what is really happening  in  the  real\r\n\r\nworld.   What probably went wrong this time is  that  the\r\n\r\nSOP  did  not  consider  the economic  condition  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry  and  the financial position of Singaporeans.   I\r\n\r\nfeel  that the people responsible for initiating the  PTC\r\n\r\nreview should have been more sensitive to the real  world\r\n\r\nproblems  and not just implement the SOPs which may  have\r\n\r\nbeen  set many years ago.  In this respect, Sir,  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  the Government and the civil service need  to  come\r\n\r\nout  with  more  convincing answers to the  questions  on\r\n\r\nissues  like price increases.  The attitude reflected  in\r\n\r\nthe  replies,  especially those given in the  newspapers'\r\n\r\nForum  pages  are  no  longer acceptable  and  reflect  a\r\n\r\ncertain level of arrogance in the replies.  I think  this\r\n\r\nis   something   that  is  not  convincing   enough   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I feel that the real issue at hand is\r\n\r\nthat we have been using a PTC system and a charter, which\r\n\r\nis now out-dated, and there is an urgent need for this to\r\n\r\nbe  reviewed.  It is understandable why the PTC ended  up\r\n\r\nallowing a fare increase this time round because the  PTC\r\n\r\nand  its  charter  have been designed to  allow  this  to\r\n\r\nhappen.  Had the guidelines been different, I am sure the\r\n\r\ndecision would have been different.  For example, at this\r\n\r\npoint  of  time, many Singaporeans actually shifted  from\r\n\r\nusing  their private cars or taxis to buses and the  MRT.\r\n\r\nI  can almost predict that the public transport companies\r\n\r\nwould  have  seen  an increase, and  not  a  decrease  of\r\n\r\nrevenue  this  time round.  How then could the  PTC  have\r\n\r\napproved the fare increases this time?  We therefore need\r\n\r\na  new formula that would determine a new balance for the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, even as I\r\n\r\nrise  to  comment  on the Motion, I  am  mindful  of  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  challenges that Singaporeans face  which  this\r\n\r\neconomic downturn has presented, and that many have  been\r\n\r\nunemployed for a prolonged period of time.  Sir, I accept\r\n\r\nthat  the  Public Transport Council can be  requested  or\r\n\r\nurged  to  broaden their considerations and  to  be  more\r\n\r\nexhaustive in their deliberations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I cannot support the motion that the PTC be\r\n\r\nasked  to  review  their decision,  let  alone  have  the\r\n\r\nGovernment stay, revoke or reject the PTC's decision,  as\r\n\r\nsuggested by Mr Chiam See Tong and Mr Steve Chia.   Doing\r\n\r\nso  would question the very existence of and the  purpose\r\n\r\nfor  constituting  the PTC.  It would threaten  the  very\r\n\r\nindependence that was crafted into the Bill back in 1987.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at that time, one of the main functions was to\r\n\r\nconsider  applications for fare adjustments, taking  into\r\n\r\naccount two frequently divergent objectives: firstly, for\r\n\r\ntransport operators to remain financially viable  whilst,\r\n\r\nsecondly,  safeguarding public interest.   The  basis  is\r\n\r\nthat  if  transport operators are not viable and have  to\r\n\r\noffer  poorer quality of service, then commuters at large\r\n\r\nwould suffer.  Yet, Sir, commuters' interests and ability\r\n\r\nto  afford  the  proposed fare hikes must weigh  heavily,\r\n\r\nespecially   in  difficult  times.  Hence,   the   Public\r\n\r\nTransport   Council,  understandably,  has  a   difficult\r\n\r\nbalance  to  strike and on an on-going  basis.   I  would\r\n\r\nagree  with Mr Tan Soo Khoon that perhaps there could  be\r\n\r\nmore  disclosure  on  the  criteria  for  evaluation   of\r\n\r\nproposals,  whether it is for new services  or  for  fare\r\n\r\nadjustments, and to have more transparency on the process\r\n\r\nitself.   Or  perhaps,  the  composition  of  the  Public\r\n\r\nTransport Council should be re-looked at to ensure  that,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  there is a wider representation  of  views  and\r\n\r\ninterest  and, secondly, there is a clear management  and\r\n\r\nseparation of conflicts of interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on competition, although Mr Mah Bow Tan has\r\n\r\nexplained  why free market competition is not necessarily\r\n\r\ndesirable, I would like to echo the call to the Minister\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Transport  to review the competitive and  regulatory\r\n\r\nframework   for  transport  services.   I   believe   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  are different and should justify  a  fresh\r\n\r\nreview.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of any changes to the transport services\r\n\r\nsector, or to the composition of the PTC, the PTC's  very\r\n\r\nindependence of the Minister and Ministry officials  that\r\n\r\nwas conceived at the outset, must be preserved.  Sir,  to\r\n\r\nmake a villain of the PTC, as alluded to by Mr Steve Chia\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Low  Thia  Khiang,  is  unwise.   Any  hint   of\r\n\r\nmoderating or influencing the decision of the PTC  cannot\r\n\r\nbe allowed, without a debate on the very existence of the\r\n\r\nPTC  itself,  its  integrity, its  very  institution,  an\r\n\r\nexistence that this very House had created back in  1987.\r\n\r\nHence,  while I am in total sympathy with the  plight  of\r\n\r\nfamilies   in   need,   I  caution  against   unwittingly\r\n\r\ndestroying  the  very integrity of the  Public  Transport\r\n\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n<br>5.10 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan (Senior Minister of State for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to\r\n\r\njoin in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the MPs who have spoken earlier, I know many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   are  unhappy  over  the   transport   fare\r\n\r\nincreases.  There is a general sense of unhappiness,  and\r\n\r\nnot  just  from bus commuters.  They are frustrated  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government seems to be hearing-impaired, or deaf  to\r\n\r\ntheir  pleas, at a time when we are still not yet out  of\r\n\r\nthe  recession.  I face this unhappiness too when I  walk\r\n\r\naround my constituency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their sentiments have been well expressed by the MPs\r\n\r\nbefore  me.  I would not repeat them.  We need to respond\r\n\r\nto  these  concerns.   As  a responsible  Government,  we\r\n\r\ncannot  govern  in a vacuum.  To govern  effectively,  we\r\n\r\nneed the understanding of the people.\r\n\r\nRising Aspirations\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent many years running public hospitals. I\r\n\r\nacquired a habit of walking the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhospital  wards, talking to patients and their relatives.\r\n\r\nThey  came from all walks of life, from the middle  class\r\n\r\nto the lower income groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But regardless of their background, they all have\r\n\r\naspirations for a better life.  This is as it should  be.\r\n\r\nAs  Singapore graduates from third world to  first  world\r\n\r\nstatus, Singaporeans naturally expect to live like  their\r\n\r\ncounterparts in the first world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore have high expectations of our public\r\n\r\ntransport  service.  We demand continuous improvement   - more  choices,  greater  frequency,  strict  punctuality,\r\n\r\ngreater comfort, no breakdowns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I grew up in the kampong, I was used to\r\n\r\nwaiting, without any shelter, often for an hour, before a\r\n\r\ndirty, hot and noisy bus would finally turn up.  It was a\r\n\r\ndifferent  lifestyle  then.  People  were  more  patient.\r\n\r\nNowadays, my daughters would give me an earful if the MRT\r\n\r\nservice was disrupted, even for a few minutes.\r\n\r\nFare Increases are Inevitable\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is committed to meeting the rising\r\n\r\naspirations of Singaporeans.  We are committed to  making\r\n\r\ncontinuous   improvements.   And  over  the  years,   our\r\n\r\ntransport operators have, by and large, been able to meet\r\n\r\nthese  higher demands.  But it is not realistic to expect\r\n\r\nsuch  improvements to come with no adjustments in  fares.\r\n\r\nIt is just not possible to deliver better services at the\r\n\r\nsame price over a long period of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam said that if only public transport could be\r\n\r\nlike  the  mobile telephones where you see prices  coming\r\n\r\ndown    with    more    and   more    competition.     In\r\n\r\ntelecommunication, it is possible, thanks  to  technology\r\n\r\nbreakthroughs.    Prices,   in   fact,   have    dropped.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,    in   most   other   industries,    such\r\n\r\nopportunities are not easily available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because public transport is labour-intensive, cost\r\n\r\nincreases due to wage increases are hard to avoid.   Like\r\n\r\nother workers, transport workers deserve pay\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrise  too.   Let  us  be fair to the many  honest,  hard-working  bus  drivers,  train operators,  who  work  long\r\n\r\nhours, often past midnight, so that the rest of Singapore\r\n\r\ncan work all day, and play all night.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that there is no scope for\r\n\r\nproductivity  gain.   There  is.   And  it  is  precisely\r\n\r\nproductivity gains which have largely allowed the PTC  to\r\n\r\nmoderate transport fare increases over the years.  First,\r\n\r\ntwo-men-operated  buses  became one-man-operated.   Next,\r\n\r\nsingle-deck  buses became double-deck  buses.   Then,  we\r\n\r\njoined two buses into one, to save one driver.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is not just productivity gain through\r\n\r\nhardware.  The quality of bus drivers and train operators\r\n\r\ntoday is quite different from the old days.  They are now\r\n\r\nbetter trained and better skilled.  And they also need to\r\n\r\nbe  IT-literate, given the penetration of IT and Internet\r\n\r\ninto  public  transport.  In a few years, with  3G,  with\r\n\r\nwireless  Internet, I expect buses and trains  to  become\r\n\r\nmobile offices where commuters continue to work and  play\r\n\r\nwhile moving from one place to another.  So the demand on\r\n\r\nour  transport operators to be more sophisticated in  its\r\n\r\nservice  offering is bound to rise further.  And we  will\r\n\r\npush  the transport operators to seek productivity gains.\r\n\r\nBut let us be honest, we cannot avoid some fare increases\r\n\r\nonce in a while.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, in the heat of the debate, both in\r\n\r\nthe media and in the coffee shops, some misunderstandings\r\n\r\nhave  cropped  up,  and  we need to  first  correct  such\r\n\r\nmisinformation,  before  we can choose  the  best  course\r\n\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misunderstanding No. 1 - fare increases are due to\r\n\r\nfrills  -  air-conditioned  interchanges,  fanciful   bus\r\n\r\nshelters, TV in buses.  Many said \"Commuters do not  need\r\n\r\nthem, remove them and fare increases can be avoided.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether these are frills, we can debate about it.\r\n\r\nBut the key point is that the transport companies did not\r\n\r\npay   for  any  of  these.   They  got  them  for   free.\r\n\r\nGovernment  pays for air-conditioned interchanges.   Why?\r\n\r\nGovernment decided on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nair-conditioned  interchanges  because  integrating   the\r\n\r\ninterchanges  into high-rise commercial  buildings  makes\r\n\r\nmuch   better  use  of  land,  instead  of  keeping   bus\r\n\r\ninterchanges  as  stand-alone  buildings.    But   having\r\n\r\nintegrated  them  into  buildings, air-conditioning  them\r\n\r\nbecomes  necessary.  Likewise, fanciful bus shelters  and\r\n\r\nTV   Mobile,  are  services  provided  by  other  private\r\n\r\ncompanies  because  they expect  to  make  money  through\r\n\r\nadvertisements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the transport companies did not pay for any of\r\n\r\nthese  services, they did not, and would  not  have  been\r\n\r\nallowed to use these to ask for fare increases.  In other\r\n\r\nwords, commuters are not made to pay for these.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misunderstanding No. 2 - fare increases are to\r\n\r\nfatten  the  profits of bus and train operators.   Is  it\r\n\r\nreally?   This can be easily verified.  You  cannot  hide\r\n\r\nfat profits.  In any case, management has no incentive to\r\n\r\nhide  fat  profits, as otherwise their bonuses would  get\r\n\r\naffected.  The big problem in Wall Street today  is  that\r\n\r\nsome  management has been tempted to produce fat  profits\r\n\r\nthrough  creative  accounting.   The  fact  is  that  our\r\n\r\ntransport operators are not making fat profits.   Yes,  I\r\n\r\nhave  heard  Mr Tan Soo Khoon quoting various figures  to\r\n\r\nshow the point that they are making fat profits.  But  if\r\n\r\nI  were the bus and train operators, and I notice quite a\r\n\r\nfew  of  them  in the public gallery, I will  immediately\r\n\r\npush  out  data  to  show to the rest of  Singapore  that\r\n\r\nindeed this is not the case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misunderstanding No. 3 - fare increases are due to\r\n\r\nlosses    by   transport   operators   in   non-transport\r\n\r\nactivities.  Some people have speculated that huge losses\r\n\r\nby   transport  operators  in  properties  and  newspaper\r\n\r\nventure  have  caused the fares to be increased.   Again,\r\n\r\nthis  is  simply not true.  We require all  non-transport\r\n\r\nactivities  of  the  operators  to  be  run  by  separate\r\n\r\ncompanies.   They are fully ring-fenced  from  the  basic\r\n\r\npublic transport activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misunderstanding No. 4 - fare increases are not\r\n\r\nopposed by an uncaring PTC.  Some people feel that PTC is\r\n\r\non  the  side of the operators and is only interested  in\r\n\r\nensuring their profitability.  They complain\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   PTC   is  not  diligent  in  protecting   consumer\r\n\r\ninterests, and this criticism is most unfair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us check the record. PTC, as Mrs Lim Hwee Hua\r\n\r\npointed  out, was set up 15 years ago, 1987.   Over  this\r\n\r\nperiod,  average  wages  in  Singapore  have  more   than\r\n\r\ndoubled.  To be precise, 136%.  The general price  level,\r\n\r\nCPI,  has gone up much less, by 29%.  On the other  hand,\r\n\r\ntransport fares have lagged behind wage growth by a  very\r\n\r\nbig  margin,  and  have largely kept  pace  with  general\r\n\r\ninflation.  In fact, depending on which criteria you use,\r\n\r\none  can argue that the average bus fares have been below\r\n\r\nthe  CPI increase over this period.  So the fact is  that\r\n\r\nPTC   has  actively  protected  the  interests   of   the\r\n\r\ncommuters.   PTC members are serious, caring individuals,\r\n\r\ndoing  a  national service, and doing a good job  to  the\r\n\r\nbest of their ability.  They certainly do not deserve the\r\n\r\nabuse  which  has been thrown on them over the  last  few\r\n\r\nweeks.   The  Chairman  of  PTC incidentally  is  in  the\r\n\r\ngallery up there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In forming the PTC, we have deliberately included\r\n\r\nmembers  from  all  walks of life,  to  give  it  a  wide\r\n\r\nrepresentation.  In the current composition, it  includes\r\n\r\nan  accountant,  an industrialist, a labour  unionist,  a\r\n\r\nmedia  editor,  an economist.  While transport  operators\r\n\r\nare  also  members  of  PTC, they  cannot  take  part  in\r\n\r\ndecisions  in which they have an interest, such  as  fare\r\n\r\nrevisions.   They  are there so that the  PTC  will  have\r\n\r\nfirst-hand   knowledge  of  the  industry  that   it   is\r\n\r\nregulating.    Nevertheless,  we  need  to  address   the\r\n\r\nwidespread concern of Singaporeans and respond  to  their\r\n\r\ngrievances.  But in so doing, we should not inadvertently\r\n\r\nundermine the foundation which has delivered the  present\r\n\r\nstate of our public transport system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, our public transport system is not perfect.\r\n\r\nThe  MRT and LRT can go with less breakdowns.  Buses  can\r\n\r\nstill  be more punctual, and commuters would like to  see\r\n\r\nmany more bus services added even when the loading is not\r\n\r\ngreat.   And,  we will certainly work with the  PTC,  the\r\n\r\noperators,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  the commuters, to make our public transport  system\r\n\r\nbetter.   But if we take a pause, and think back on  what\r\n\r\nwe  had  10  years  ago,  20 years  ago,  it  is  a  vast\r\n\r\nimprovement.   And  for  those  who  have   used   public\r\n\r\ntransport in other cities, whether in the first world  or\r\n\r\nin  the third world, they know that we have not done  too\r\n\r\nbadly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last week, someone e-mailed me to relate the\r\n\r\nexperience  of  one  Singaporean now working  in  London.\r\n\r\nAccording to him, it has now become common for people  to\r\n\r\nexpect to come in late to office because the trains there\r\n\r\nfrequently break down at peak periods.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to be amused by the picture of the old\r\n\r\nrickety  Indian  bus, overflowing with  commuters.   Some\r\n\r\nhave  to  climb  onto the roof where, in fact,  the  best\r\n\r\n\"seats\"  are.   The next best \"seats\" are for  those  who\r\n\r\nrecklessly  hang themselves outside the bus by  clutching\r\n\r\nonto doors and windows.  Those with seats inside the  bus\r\n\r\nturn  out  to  be the most uncomfortable -  hot,  steamy,\r\n\r\nsweaty and suffocating!  But you have to see it with your\r\n\r\nown eyes to appreciate this experience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the fact is that over the years, we have evolved\r\n\r\na  good public transport system, and it rests on four key\r\n\r\npillars:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pillar No.1 - Responsive to Rising Expectations.\r\n\r\nThe operators know that they have to be responsive to the\r\n\r\nrising  expectations of Singaporeans.  As  education  and\r\n\r\nincome  level  rises, our service level has  to  rise  to\r\n\r\nmatch it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pillar No. 2 - Leveraging on Private Enterprise. We\r\n\r\nlet  private enterprise operate the service.  This is  to\r\n\r\ntake advantage of the financial discipline of the market,\r\n\r\nand  their  greater  capacity for innovation  and  speedy\r\n\r\nexecution.   There were some suggestions from Steve  Chia\r\n\r\njust  now, or is it Low Thia Khiang, \"Forget about profit\r\n\r\nmotive.   Move to cost plus\".  Yes, we can do that.   But\r\n\r\nthen it would immediately lose the incentives.  Profit is\r\n\r\nnot a dirty word.  It is precisely because of profit that\r\n\r\ndrives innovations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the discussion this afternoon, I gather there\r\n\r\nis not a good appreciation of the CPI + X framework.  But\r\n\r\ntime  does  not  allow me to go into the nitty-gritty  of\r\n\r\nthis  system.   But the CPI + X system was  precisely  to\r\n\r\nallow us to incentivise operators to innovate and to seek\r\n\r\nout and benefit as much productivity gains as they could,\r\n\r\nsubject  to the framework within which they are  entitled\r\n\r\nto  certain price increases.  Then, it is the job of  the\r\n\r\nPTC  to decide what is a reasonable rate of increase, and\r\n\r\nthat  is  the  CPI  +  X framework.   So,  if  you  fully\r\n\r\nunderstood  what  the CPI + X framework  is  supposed  to\r\n\r\nachieve, all this discussion about profitability  and  so\r\n\r\non   is   irrelevant.   It  has  nothing   to   do   with\r\n\r\nprofitability.  Within this CPI + X framework, we  decide\r\n\r\nwhat  is  a  reasonable rate of fare increases  which  is\r\n\r\ncommensurate   with  the  affordability  level   of   the\r\n\r\npopulation, then it is the job of the operators to go all\r\n\r\nout to make profit out of this approved system.  That  is\r\n\r\nthe  only way to drive innovation.  That is the only  way\r\n\r\nto drive productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pillar No. 3 - Targeting Government Subsidy on\r\n\r\nInfrastructure.   We  provide a huge Government  subsidy,\r\n\r\nbut  we  have been careful to target it at infrastructure\r\n\r\nand capital investment.  We cannot leave public transport\r\n\r\npurely  to  the  market, because then  many  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  able to afford the full  fare  of  public\r\n\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\nSo there is a role for Government in funding, but we have\r\n\r\ndeliberately  not  subsidised  the  operational  cost  of\r\n\r\npublic  transport.  The operators will have to  make  the\r\n\r\noperation viable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was delighted to read the Streats' article last\r\n\r\nweek, July 2, in which it quoted a Madam Soh Lay Hoon who\r\n\r\nstays  in  Jurong but works in Ang Mo Kio.  Her house  is\r\n\r\nabout  a 10-minute walk from the Jurong East MRT station.\r\n\r\nShe  can  either  walk there or take a feeder  bus.   She\r\n\r\nchooses  to get up just a little bit earlier so that  she\r\n\r\ncan walk to the station in time.  That way, she saves  on\r\n\r\nshuttle fares every day.  This is a very sensible,  down-to-earth  approach.   Now, do we  want  to  distort  such\r\n\r\nsensible  decisions  by, for example, subsidising  feeder\r\n\r\nfares?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pillar No. 4 - Preserving the Independence of the\r\n\r\nRegulator.   We  set  up  an  independent  regulator   to\r\n\r\nregulate the transport operators.  When PTC was set up 15\r\n\r\nyears ago, there was a full debate in this House.  I  was\r\n\r\nthen  a  young civil servant and I remember  the  debate.\r\n\r\nThis  House gave birth to the PTC.  Mr Tan Soo Khoon  and\r\n\r\nseveral  veteran MPs in this House could claim  paternity\r\n\r\nto  the PTC.  We know that public transport fares had  to\r\n\r\nbe  adjusted  periodically if we are to enjoy  continuous\r\n\r\nservice improvements.  But fare adjustments are unpopular\r\n\r\nand  we  should  try  to  de-politicise  it  as  much  as\r\n\r\npossible,  if  at  all possible.  In fact,  a  point  was\r\n\r\nbrought up during the debate in 1987 on whether some  MPs\r\n\r\nshould  sit  in  the  PTC.  It was  quickly  rejected  as\r\n\r\nunwise.  Instead, the independence and professionalism of\r\n\r\nthe  PTC  was  stressed by several MPs, both during  that\r\n\r\ndebate, as well as this afternoon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can argue over the composition of the PTC,\r\n\r\nwhether we could widen its representation to include, eg,\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders, as suggested  by  some  MPs,  or  to\r\n\r\nexclude  the transport operators.  We can debate  whether\r\n\r\nthe  PTC could have better explained its recent decisions\r\n\r\nto  the people.  We can discuss whether PTC should revise\r\n\r\nits  modus  operandi, eg, to make its deliberations  more\r\n\r\ntransparent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong in criticising the decision\r\n\r\nof  the PTC.  They have a difficult job of balancing, not\r\n\r\nprofitability, but the long-term interests  of  commuters\r\n\r\nand the short-term effects on them.  Inevitably, judgment\r\n\r\nhas  to  be  made.  We can certainly disagree with  PTC's\r\n\r\njudgment,  as honest people would.   But we cannot  fault\r\n\r\nthem  for  not  being diligent.  They are  certainly  not\r\n\r\napologists for operators, as Mr Tan Soo Khoon put it this\r\n\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we certainly should not inadvertently weaken the\r\n\r\nPTC  by  undermining the independence of  this  important\r\n\r\npublic institution.  To weaken the PTC will, in fact,  be\r\n\r\nto  go  against commuters because PTC is there to protect\r\n\r\nthem.  We should strengthen PTC; we should not weaken it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, have grave misgiving about the Motion\r\n\r\nas currently worded.  The first\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npart on urging the PTC to review its decision must surely\r\n\r\nundermine it.  If we over-ride the PTC, by getting it  to\r\n\r\nreverse its decision, or even if by getting them to delay\r\n\r\nthe  hike,  as suggested by, I think, Mr Leong Horn  Kee,\r\n\r\nthen what is the point of appointing the PTC?\r\n\r\nFare Increases During Recession\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But MPs are correct to say that the timing of the\r\n\r\nfare increase is bad, as we are still recovering from the\r\n\r\nrecession.   PTC  is,  of  course,  fully  aware  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic backdrop, but it operates on the principle  that\r\n\r\nregular  small  fare  increases  are  better  than  large\r\n\r\ninfrequent  increases.   It is  to  make  it  easier  for\r\n\r\ncommuters to adjust.  I support this principle.  But  PTC\r\n\r\nmay  want  to revisit this principle, to see if there  is\r\n\r\nscope  to  apply it with greater sensitivity at times  of\r\n\r\nrecession.   Certainly,  fare  increases  can  be  better\r\n\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, urge Mr Tan Soo Khoon and others\r\n\r\nto relook the Motion to see how it can be amended to make\r\n\r\nit  clearer  on the follow-up action of the  PTC  without\r\n\r\nundermining its authority or independence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, in the face of globalisation of the economy\r\n\r\nand jobs are under threat, we are treated with   waves of\r\n\r\nincreases in prices and charges. Accordingly, this  round\r\n\r\nof  bus  and  MRT  fare hikes gives rise to  worries  and\r\n\r\nconcerns  to  the  people. We should have  no  difficulty\r\n\r\nunderstanding  why the people have so  much  grouses  and\r\n\r\nunhappiness,  despite the fact that  the  Consumer  Price\r\n\r\nIndex  (CPI) has been dropping over the last six  months.\r\n\r\nSo, to a certain degree, the total cost of living has not\r\n\r\nbeen as bad as what many people have perceived it to  be.\r\n\r\nBut  the more important thing is that the Government must\r\n\r\nassure  the people that when times are bad, and when  the\r\n\r\npeople  are pressurised with a rising cost of living,  it\r\n\r\nremains  pro-people and cares for the  people.   In  this\r\n\r\nround of public transport fare increase, we can see  that\r\n\r\na lot of people are very unhappy.  But the fare\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincreases  have already come into effect from  1st  July.\r\n\r\nAny amount of argument and deliberation will not able  to\r\n\r\nturn  back the clock. It is a done deal. Or is it  really\r\n\r\nso?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, there are four lessons that we should\r\n\r\nlearn from this round of public transport fares increase.\r\n\r\nThey are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Implement only when all systems are ready.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Balance between profitability and public interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The timing is everything.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The need for greater transparency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I say the systems are not in place? I say no\r\n\r\nbecause of two reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst,  the  implementation of the ez-link  card  is  not\r\n\r\nfully on track. Senior citizens who have applied for  the\r\n\r\ncard  have  not  yet  received  them.   TransitLink  only\r\n\r\ndecided  last  week  to  issue interim  cards  to  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens.  I  am  glad it has done so, as  otherwise  the\r\n\r\nsenior  citizens would have no choice but to  pay  higher\r\n\r\nfares  using  the  existing magnetic farecards.  But  the\r\n\r\nproblem  does  not  appear  to  be  confined  to   senior\r\n\r\ncitizens.  Students are also waiting  for  their  ez-link\r\n\r\ncards to be issued.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the teething problems of the ez-link card\r\n\r\nhave  not  been  fully  resolved.  Judging  from  various\r\n\r\nfeedback,  the problems with the ez-link cards  faced  by\r\n\r\ncommuters  are  very  real.  My residents  told  me  that\r\n\r\nadjusting  the  fares at this moment  is  unfair  to  the\r\n\r\nsenior citizens, because many of them have yet to receive\r\n\r\ntheir ez-link cards they had applied for.  This is to say\r\n\r\nthat  we are forcing the senior citizens to pay more when\r\n\r\nthey use the public transport system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, it was announced that provisional ez-link\r\n\r\ncards  would be issued to the senior citizens.  I am  not\r\n\r\nsure  whether this can effectively solve the  problem  of\r\n\r\nthese senior citizens.  Moreover,  the students are still\r\n\r\nwaiting   for   their   ez-link   cards.    Under    such\r\n\r\ncircumstances, many citizens are not able to use the  ez-link card, and when they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinue  to use the TransitLink card, they have  to  pay\r\n\r\nhigher fares.  To them, the increase is not 3 cents but 5\r\n\r\ncents.   To  those  who  are not used  to  the  automatic\r\n\r\nsystem,  they have to pay cash and, hence, to  them,  the\r\n\r\nincrease  is 10 cents.  If we can wait until the  ez-link\r\n\r\ncard   is  completely  in  place,  then  make  the   fare\r\n\r\nadjustments,   the inconvenience to the  people  will  be\r\n\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we must balance between the transport\r\n\r\ncompanies'  profits  and  public  interest.   People,  in\r\n\r\ngeneral,  are  unhappy  with the  fact  that  the  public\r\n\r\ntransport companies are asking for fare increase  despite\r\n\r\nthe  fact that they are making huge profits and  thus  no\r\n\r\nurgency  to increase fares.  There is an article  in  the\r\n\r\nStraits Times suggesting that public transport should  be\r\n\r\na  service to  the people and not for profit.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthere is no need to rush into fare increases at this time\r\n\r\nof  recession. The article commented that the thing  that\r\n\r\nhurt  the commuters most was the Government's failure  to\r\n\r\nsee  beyond  rational  argument  and  its  inability   or\r\n\r\nunwillingness  to empathise with the people.   These  are\r\n\r\nstrong words.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another newspaper, Streats, a similar view was\r\n\r\nalso  reflected.  It was felt that in recent  years,  the\r\n\r\npublic  transport system seemed to have lost its original\r\n\r\ndirection.  The writer said that fare prices and services\r\n\r\nshould  not  be entirely determined by cost  and  profits\r\n\r\nalone.   Should  public transport operators  be  entirely\r\n\r\nprofit-oriented?   The  writer claimed  that  our  public\r\n\r\ntransport  policy has lost its direction, and this  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion that many people have raised and, I think, it is\r\n\r\nnecessary for us to study the issues closely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, our public transport operators are\r\n\r\nlisted  companies.   According to the  public,  they  are\r\n\r\nmaking  money,  especially,  recently,  when  the   whole\r\n\r\neconomic  environment is bad, they are  still  profitable\r\n\r\ncompanies.  Sir, let us look at the past records.   There\r\n\r\nwere  no changes to the fares from 1982 to 1990.  Between\r\n\r\n1990  and  1996, the average fare went up  by  1.3%.   In\r\n\r\n1996,  however, it was reported that SBS  and  TIBS  lost\r\n\r\n$9.6 million and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$5.6  million  respectively.  Thus, in 1997,  PTC  agreed\r\n\r\nwith  the bus companies to increase the fares by 5  cents\r\n\r\nacross the board. But in order to reduce the impact,  the\r\n\r\n1997   adjustment   was  only  confined   to   the   non-airconditioned   buses  only.    For   those   who   took\r\n\r\nairconditioned buses and paid with their fare-cards, they\r\n\r\ndid  not have to suffer the fare hike. As for MRT,   only\r\n\r\nthose who travelled with single journey ticket needed  to\r\n\r\npay  10  cents more.  In the next three years, 1997-2000,\r\n\r\nthe  fare was not adjusted.  I was particularly impressed\r\n\r\nthat  in 1999, the bus operators gave a 5% rebate to  all\r\n\r\ncommuters.  Then, in 2000 and 2001, new fare stages  were\r\n\r\nadded,  and commuters on feeder services had  to  pay  10\r\n\r\ncents   more   respectively.   Fortunately,  with   these\r\n\r\nmoderated  adjustments, the operators  are  still  making\r\n\r\nmoney.   The  question is thus: why  increase  when  they\r\n\r\ncontinue to make such high profits? I think this  is  one\r\n\r\nquestion that many people are asking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that many people are not happy with the\r\n\r\nwork  of  the  PTC.  But, of course, we must also  calmly\r\n\r\nlook  at  the contributions by the PTC over the past  few\r\n\r\nyears.   We must look at the facts objectively.  Look  at\r\n\r\nthese facts:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- For those who use farecards, there has been no\r\n\r\nincrease   in  fares  for  passengers  travelling   short\r\n\r\ndistances  below 14 fare stages, in airconditioned  buses\r\n\r\nsince  1990,  the  fares remained between  60  cents  and\r\n\r\n$1.20.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Over the past decade, fares have gone up\r\n\r\nprimarily  for  long distances, so as to  better  reflect\r\n\r\ncosts   and  cut  down  the  indirect  subsidy  of  short\r\n\r\ndistances over longer ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- When fares go up in the past, those who use\r\n\r\nfarecards  continue  to  enjoy  transfer  rebates,   thus\r\n\r\nminimising the impact of fare increases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- In this round of adjustments, senior citizens\r\n\r\ntravelling longer distances in the MRT actually pay less,\r\n\r\nfrom 70 cents to 64 cents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the PTC has done a reasonable job\r\n\r\ndrawing the line between\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprofitability  of  transport  operators  and  maintaining\r\n\r\npublic  interest,  and allowing the operators  to  remain\r\n\r\nprofitable without profiteering. But this begs a  further\r\n\r\nquestion    -   last  year,  the  PTC  turned  down   the\r\n\r\napplications  to  increase fares due  to  the  prevailing\r\n\r\neconomic conditions then, why can it not do so again this\r\n\r\nyear?  After all, the economic situation has  not  really\r\n\r\nimproved  that  much.   Why can  they  not  postpone  the\r\n\r\nincrease?  Many people feel that the timing is wrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timing is everything, especially when we have many\r\n\r\nbad  news.   The Ministry of Manpower has  also  told  us\r\n\r\nabout  the  highest record of unemployment in the  second\r\n\r\nhalf  of the year.  The unemployment rate will be  raised\r\n\r\nfrom  5%  to 5.5%.  To Singapore, which has been enjoying\r\n\r\nfull employment for many years, this is a hard reality to\r\n\r\naccept.  At this time, the announcement of fare increases\r\n\r\nwill  give rise to more concern and worry on the part  of\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From another angle, I feel that PTC has not done\r\n\r\nvery  well to a certain extent this time round.   In  the\r\n\r\npast,  whenever the fares were increased,  some  form  of\r\n\r\nrebates  for those who have to transfer from one  service\r\n\r\nto  another  was  given to compensate for  the  increased\r\n\r\nfares.   But this time, they have not given any discount.\r\n\r\nI  do  not know why they cannot do it this time.  To  the\r\n\r\nordinary workers, if they have to take a shuttle  bus  to\r\n\r\nthe MRT and then hop on to another shuttle service to get\r\n\r\nto  the  final destination, the effect on them is  not  3\r\n\r\ncents,  but   3  cents plus 4 cents plus 3 cents,  ie,  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of 10 cents.  So, to those who do not know how  to\r\n\r\nuse  the ez-link card, such as the senior citizens,  then\r\n\r\nit is 10 cents plus 10 cents plus 10 cents.  So two ways,\r\n\r\nit  is  60  cents.   I do not understand  why  we  cannot\r\n\r\narrange  for  some  rebates for  commuters  who  have  to\r\n\r\ntransfer from one service to another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, CASE has always been advocating strongly and\r\n\r\nconsistently  that  there must  be  transparency  in  our\r\n\r\ncommercial  organisations.  The PTC  announced  the  fare\r\n\r\nincreases on 11th June.  So far, we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  not  heard  further from them.  No explanation  has\r\n\r\nbeen  given.   So from 11th June until now,  the  various\r\n\r\nviews have been expressed and reflected very strongly  in\r\n\r\nthe  media.   But the PTC and their operators  have  been\r\n\r\nkeeping  quiet  all  this time.   Until  two  weeks  ago,\r\n\r\nsuddenly,   they  issued  a  long  reply.   My  residents\r\n\r\ncommented, \"Such a long reply, how to read?\".  So, nobody\r\n\r\nknows  what  is  actually  happening.   This  is  a  very\r\n\r\ndisappointing situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We often say, what goes up must come down. By the\r\n\r\nsame  logic,  what  goes down, must  come  up.   However,\r\n\r\npeople  hope that this applies only on the share  market.\r\n\r\nWhen  we talk about bus fares and public service charges,\r\n\r\nit  can only go up but never come down.  People find this\r\n\r\nhard  to  accept.  We must let our people understand  why\r\n\r\nthis  is the case. I think some sort of clarification  or\r\n\r\nexplanation   is   necessary.    Transparency   is   very\r\n\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the film, \"I Not Stupid\", we must not be\r\n\r\ntreated  as  though  we  are  all  ignorant  people.   If\r\n\r\nnecessary, the authority  must explain to the  people  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can understand.  Let me give Members  another\r\n\r\nexample.   On 2nd of July, there was a report in  Streats\r\n\r\nwhere  one commuter was quoted as saying, \"If our  people\r\n\r\nwant  to  enjoy  a world-class transport system  and  not\r\n\r\nwilling to pay more, then it is a joke.  Because  we  all\r\n\r\nknow that there is no free lunch.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that when prices are increased, if it\r\n\r\nis  explained  properly, our people will  understand  the\r\n\r\nsituation  better, and thereby be more amicable  to  such\r\n\r\nadditional burden. We must not ignore the feelings of the\r\n\r\npeople.   We must explain to the people the circumstances\r\n\r\nwhy  it  is  necessary to take certain action.   The  bus\r\n\r\noperators must also tell the people clearly, whether they\r\n\r\nhave  done  their  best to improve productivity  to  save\r\n\r\ncost.   Mr  Tan Soo Khoon had made a comparison with  the\r\n\r\nHong  Kong  situation - why Hong Kong could do  it  while\r\n\r\nSingapore  could not.    More importantly, if we  do  not\r\n\r\nexplain clearly to our people, then more people will fail\r\n\r\nto understand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  they would feel more painful, more disappointed  and\r\n\r\nmore worried.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, overall, I endorse the principle that small\r\n\r\nincreases  from time to time  are better than  one  large\r\n\r\nincrease  all of a sudden.  But to most people,  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  adjustments here and there - a little  bit  here,  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit there, a little bit everywhere - and if we add\r\n\r\nup  all the little bits, it is one big deal.  Many people\r\n\r\nfind this hard to swallow. This is a very important issue\r\n\r\nthat   we   must  rectify  and  find  a  solution.   Most\r\n\r\nimportantly,  I hope that the lessons learnt  this  round\r\n\r\ncan  be  registered beyond this round of  fare  increase.\r\n\r\nThey  too  are  pertinent  for other  service  providers,\r\n\r\nespecially for those who are reported to be contemplating\r\n\r\nfee  increases, such as school bus operators and SingTel.\r\n\r\nI  hope that they can learn the lesson and increase their\r\n\r\ntransparency,  and  they should explain  clearly  to  the\r\n\r\npeople the rationale for their intention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nGovernment  a  few questions. First, on statutory  costs.\r\n\r\nFrom  the  public debate and public transport  operators'\r\n\r\nreply,  it appears that statutory cost is one of the  key\r\n\r\nfactors that drives up fares. My question to SMRT and SBS\r\n\r\nis:  what  is the extent of statutory costs in  operating\r\n\r\ntheir   businesses?  Further,  I  understand   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has allowed public buses to enjoy concessions\r\n\r\nin  road  taxes  and  exemption from  COE,  why  can  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  not  exempt public buses  from  ERP  charges?\r\n\r\nSurely,  this will further cut down statutory  costs  and\r\n\r\ngive one less reason for bus operators to increase fares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on the airconditioned bus interchange. SBS\r\n\r\nhas   clarified   that   the   cost   of   building   the\r\n\r\nairconditioned interchange at Toa Payoh was borne by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   I   am  concerned  that   operational   and\r\n\r\nmaintenance  cost that operators have to bear  in  future\r\n\r\ncan  be  very high, and it will become a key  factor  for\r\n\r\nfuture  fare  increase.  My  question  is:  what  is  the\r\n\r\nestimated  operational cost of running an  airconditioned\r\n\r\ninterchange compared to a non-airconditioned one?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SBS also said that it does not get any rental\r\n\r\nincome from tenants at the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterchanges  and  neither do the tenants  help  pay  for\r\n\r\nupkeep  of common areas. I have several questions to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment: did the Government allow SMRT to  get  rental\r\n\r\nincome from the tenants at the MRT stations? If so, would\r\n\r\nthis  arrangement be extended to public bus operators  to\r\n\r\noffset cost of maintaining the interchange?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its letter published in the newspapers on 24th\r\n\r\nJune, the SBS said that \"If we are able to work with  the\r\n\r\nauthorities to share some of the cost of maintaining  the\r\n\r\ninterchange  for instance, it will also not be  a  factor\r\n\r\nwhen  considering future fare increases.\" I was surprised\r\n\r\nby SBS' statement. If the Government can defray the costs\r\n\r\nof  maintaining interchanges, SBS' operational costs will\r\n\r\nsurely  go down, and this must certainly be a factor  for\r\n\r\nSBS to consider in future fare increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the SBS, LTA and the Minister for\r\n\r\nTransport  can  address  the various  questions  that  we\r\n\r\nraised  in this House and those raised by the members  of\r\n\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, while there are early signs of our economy bottoming\r\n\r\nout, it is still some time yet for a broad based recovery\r\n\r\nto materialise.  The employment situation, in particular,\r\n\r\nis  likely  to worsen before it improves.  The Government\r\n\r\nhas  repeatedly  called on the people to be  patient  and\r\n\r\nflexible.   We are asked to tighten our belts and  accept\r\n\r\nlower  pay so as to stay employed.  We are urged to  make\r\n\r\nsacrifices so that we could bring in new investments  and\r\n\r\nrestart the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people having been convinced, we took the bitter\r\n\r\nmedicine,  albeit  with a bit of  sugar.   However,  such\r\n\r\nsacrifices should be borne by all in an equitable manner.\r\n\r\nIt  therefore should not surprise the Government when our\r\n\r\npeople  reacted  strongly  when  the  various  Government\r\n\r\nagencies and the public transport operators raised  their\r\n\r\ncharges one after another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, feedback from our residents showed that the\r\n\r\ndecision of the Public Transport\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCouncil  to  allow bus and MRT to raise their  fares  has\r\n\r\nprobably  pushed  our people over their tolerance  limit.\r\n\r\nThey  came  to  me and said, \"Towkay, tong mui  teow  loh\r\n\r\nler.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they raised three issues with me. Firstly,\r\n\r\nthey  questioned  the basis for the increase.   Secondly,\r\n\r\nthey wanted to know whether the timing of the increase is\r\n\r\nappropriate.   Lastly,  they were worried  and  uncertain\r\n\r\nabout future increases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, firstly, the basis for the increase. The\r\n\r\nPublic Transport Council claimed that the increase is  in\r\n\r\naccordance with an agreed formula, the famous  CPI  +  X.\r\n\r\nQuestions were raised on the basis of this formula.   Why\r\n\r\nshould  the PTC adopt a formula that allows the operators\r\n\r\nto  increase their fares according to CPI increases,  let\r\n\r\nalone  the  plus  X  factor?  The Government  has  stated\r\n\r\nclearly that it is not its intention, nor its policy,  to\r\n\r\nsubsidise  public transport and that the public transport\r\n\r\ncompanies should operate on a commercial basis.  However,\r\n\r\nby  adopting a formula that is pegged to CPI + X  factor,\r\n\r\nis  the  Government not endorsing a form of subsidy,  and\r\n\r\nyet  this  subsidy does not come from the Government,  or\r\n\r\nfrom the commuters?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is particularly hard to justify since both SBS\r\n\r\nas well as MRTC have been profitable.  The fare increases\r\n\r\nwill add a significant amount to their bottom line.  Yes,\r\n\r\nwe  must allow our companies to make profit, even if they\r\n\r\nare   providing  essential  services.   These  are   what\r\n\r\ncompanies are for.  Their shareholders must see a return.\r\n\r\nBut  their return must be taken in context.  The  reality\r\n\r\nis that many companies have suffered lower income, if not\r\n\r\nlosses, over the last two years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the listed companies, for example. On average,\r\n\r\nlisted companies in the year 2001 saw a reduction of over\r\n\r\n40%, on average, in their profits.  Many of them have  to\r\n\r\nadopt   aggressive  restructuring  and   cost   reduction\r\n\r\nprogrammes just to stay alive.  Some have to accept short-term  losses  to ensure long-term viability.   These  are\r\n\r\ninevitable outcomes in time of a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsevere   economic  downturn.   If  the  public  transport\r\n\r\noperators  are truly commercially run, they will  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to escape similar challenges.  However, let us take\r\n\r\nSBS, for example.  They suffered only a 20% drop in their\r\n\r\nprofits  in  the  year 2001.  They have performed  better\r\n\r\nthan  the  market,  in  general.   The  public  transport\r\n\r\noperators  made proposals to the PTC for rate  increases.\r\n\r\nBut  do the commuters have a chance to make proposals  to\r\n\r\nthe PTC, or representation to the PTC, to object to these\r\n\r\nincreases, or to propose a reduction instead?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to argue that a more equitable\r\n\r\nbasis  to  determine bus and MRT fare adjustments  should\r\n\r\ntake  into account the performance of the overall economy\r\n\r\nas well.  Even if CPI goes up, which may be possible even\r\n\r\nin   a  recession,  fare  increases  may  still  not   be\r\n\r\njustifiable  if  the overall economy  and  companies,  in\r\n\r\ngeneral,  are  not  doing well.  This is,  in  fact,  the\r\n\r\nsituation  we are in right now.  Indeed, if the  economic\r\n\r\nperformance  had been taken into account, the  PTC  might\r\n\r\nhave  taken a different view and its decision might  have\r\n\r\nbeen different.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we should consider introducing some\r\n\r\ncompetition.  Singapore Airlines reacted very quickly  to\r\n\r\nthe  changes  in  industry  by initiating  fare  cuts  to\r\n\r\nmaintain its market share.  They need to do this  because\r\n\r\nof   international   competition.    PSA   also   finally\r\n\r\nacknowledged the threat from competition and  decided  to\r\n\r\nreduce  its  fares.  But there is no competition  in  bus\r\n\r\ntransport or MRT.  When we raised the ERP, commuters  can\r\n\r\nchoose  not to drive and take the bus instead.  But  when\r\n\r\nwe  raised bus and MRT fares, our commuters do  not  have\r\n\r\nthe alternatives.  I would like to urge the Government to\r\n\r\nconsider allowing some form of competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second issue is regarding the timing of the\r\n\r\nincrease.  The absolute dollar amount of the increase may\r\n\r\nnot  be  as  much an issue as the timing of the increase.\r\n\r\nPTC should be applauded for its efforts in deferring fare\r\n\r\nincreases  in  previous years in view  of  the  difficult\r\n\r\neconomic  environment then.  The economy  has  not  fully\r\n\r\nrecovered.  In fact, it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  somewhat  worsened,  especially  in  the  employment\r\n\r\nsituation.  Many people have lost their jobs.  More  have\r\n\r\ntaken a pay cut to save their jobs.  With reduced income,\r\n\r\nour   people  would  be  very  wary  of  cost  increases,\r\n\r\nespecially in the essential services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are like sailing through a storm in a boat,\r\n\r\nfaced with economic difficulties.  Yet, in the middle  of\r\n\r\nthe  storm,  the passengers were asked to  top  up  their\r\n\r\nfares.  So, the question is:  is it the right time to ask\r\n\r\nthem  to  top  up  their fares?  As a result,  many  have\r\n\r\nwondered why the PTC could not have deferred the increase\r\n\r\nfor,  say,  another six to nine months, when the  outlook\r\n\r\nwill  be a little bit clearer.  Alternatively, PTC  could\r\n\r\napprove the increase but defer the implementation to next\r\n\r\nyear.   This way, commuters would also have more time  to\r\n\r\nprepare for the increases and they would probably  accept\r\n\r\nPTC's  decision more readily, knowing that PTC has  taken\r\n\r\nthe   current  economic  and  employment  situation  into\r\n\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, our people are fearful of what else is\r\n\r\nthere to come.  First, the Government increased the  ERP,\r\n\r\nciting  its  objective and intention  to  curb  usage  of\r\n\r\nprivate   cars  and  to  encourage  the  use  of   public\r\n\r\ntransport.   Then,  we  increased  the  public  transport\r\n\r\nfares,  apparently in contradiction to  the  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy.   In between, there were increases in HDB carpark\r\n\r\ncharges, electricity rates and others.  I understand that\r\n\r\nSingTel  has  also submitted application to increase  its\r\n\r\nfixed line charges.  With almost monthly announcements of\r\n\r\nrate  hikes in one form or another, residents have become\r\n\r\nvery wary of more such increases to come.  They come away\r\n\r\nwith  a  strong  sense of frustration.   Over  time,  the\r\n\r\nfrustration  will turn into desperation, and  desperation\r\n\r\nwill turn into anger and disappointment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Government to assure the\r\n\r\npeople   that   it  will  critically  scrutinise   future\r\n\r\nincreases in Government-related rates and fees and  that,\r\n\r\nunless  absolutely  necessary, fee adjustments  would  be\r\n\r\ndeferred  until the economy recovers strongly.   I  would\r\n\r\nalso like to urge the Government to disclose early\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimpending fee hikes, if any, and to give more time before\r\n\r\nimplementation, so that our people would have  sufficient\r\n\r\ntime to make their own plans or adjustments.  It does not\r\n\r\nhelp to keep proposed fee hikes under wraps and spring  a\r\n\r\nsurprise on our own residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we understand that the PTC has a\r\n\r\ntough  and thankless job.  But its decisions will  affect\r\n\r\nthe  entire population, some more than others.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  lower  income  families will be affected  more  than\r\n\r\nthose who own cars.  It is, therefore, important for  the\r\n\r\nPTC  to  take  into  account not just  the  CPI  but  all\r\n\r\nrelevant  factors, such as the economy and the employment\r\n\r\nsituation, before arriving at its decisions.   It  should\r\n\r\nalso  be more transparent in its decision making process,\r\n\r\nso  that  our people can be assured that their  interests\r\n\r\nare being taken into account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been fearful of bending to public\r\n\r\npressure and of adopting populist policies.  But this  is\r\n\r\nprobably  not an issue of whether the fare increases  are\r\n\r\npopular  or  not.  The issue is obvious: we are  debating\r\n\r\nwhether the approach is appropriate and the increases are\r\n\r\ntimely.  We are all talking about remaking Singapore now.\r\n\r\nSo,  let us acknowledge that perhaps the process  of  the\r\n\r\nfare  hikes  could have been better handled, and  let  us\r\n\r\nwork  together  to improve the process.  I believe  that,\r\n\r\nthis  way, we will then be able to continue to enjoy  the\r\n\r\nconfidence,  the  endorsement and the commitment  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me\r\n\r\nstate  at  the  outset that, like many of  my  colleagues\r\n\r\nbefore me, I believe, on the whole, Singapore operates  a\r\n\r\nfairly  efficient  and  effective transport  system.   In\r\n\r\ngeneral,  despite  occasional hitches  and  some  desired\r\n\r\nservice  improvements, such as in the case  of  the  LRT,\r\n\r\nbuses and the mass rapid transit are comfortable, on time\r\n\r\nand  carry  commuters to their destinations without  much\r\n\r\nfuss.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the widespread unhappiness over the fare hikes - grudgingly accepted by many commuters from 1st July\r\n\r\nonwards,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor lack of other options - cannot be dismissed as simply\r\n\r\nthe   grumblings   of  a  complaining  and   self-serving\r\n\r\nelectorate.   The outcry has taken place  amidst  a  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  and uncertain economic situation,  a  slew  of\r\n\r\npronouncements  on fee increases and fears  -  repeatedly\r\n\r\nacknowledged by the Government - of mounting job  losses.\r\n\r\nEven  analysts, who are normally guided by  hard  numbers\r\n\r\nand cold rationale, were puzzled over the fare hikes,  as\r\n\r\nboth SBS and SMRT have registered decent profits for last\r\n\r\nyear when the economy was in recession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically, this has also come at a time when civil\r\n\r\nservants  are  reminded by their chief  of  the  need  to\r\n\r\nformulate  policies that are reasoned, ie,  appealing  to\r\n\r\nthe mind and reasonable, ie, appealing to the heart.  Or,\r\n\r\nto  quote a Chinese phrase, he qing he li which,  loosely\r\n\r\ntranslated,   means   \"in   accordance   with   emotional\r\n\r\nsensibility  and logical reason\".  It is  interesting  to\r\n\r\nnote  that  in the Chinese phrase \"emotional sensibility\"\r\n\r\nactually precedes \"logical reasoning\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without unjustly elevating the importance of this\r\n\r\nissue, I would venture to say that, in effect, there is a\r\n\r\nreal  danger that all the recent rhetoric of a more open,\r\n\r\nconsultative and responsive government will fall on  deaf\r\n\r\nears,  if we do not take heed of the emotional undertones\r\n\r\nsurrounding this issue and squarely address them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although my colleagues before me have already\r\n\r\neloquently  highlighted and debated on the  many  reasons\r\n\r\nfor  the  public disquiet over the recent fare  hikes,  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  as this matter affects the purse  strings  of\r\n\r\nsome  seven  out  of  10 Singaporeans  and  tugs  at  the\r\n\r\nemotional heartstrings and logical reasoning of even non-commuters,  I  am  duty bound to give  my  take  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter,  based  on  feedback  I  have  received  from  my\r\n\r\nresidents as well as other Singaporeans who have  written\r\n\r\nor spoken to me.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to particularly reiterate three nagging\r\n\r\nissues which, I hope, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister   can   address  in  order   to   allay   public\r\n\r\nconsternation over these hikes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the timing of the fare hikes. Quite apart\r\n\r\nfrom  any  reasoned, logical argument,  the  fare  hikes,\r\n\r\nalthough  small,  should not have been approved  in  such\r\n\r\ntimes,   when  economic  conditions  remain  harsh,   the\r\n\r\nunemployment rate is growing and there is, to  quote  DPM\r\n\r\nLee   himself,   \"breakneck   disquieting   change\".    A\r\n\r\ndeflationary  environment generally gives rise  to  price\r\n\r\nfalls,  and so the combination of higher parking charges,\r\n\r\nhigher  electricity tariffs, higher GST and higher public\r\n\r\ntransport   fares  is  particularly  hard   to   swallow.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  rising  costs in  many  industries  do  not\r\n\r\nnaturally translate into higher prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, in a competitive environment, prices are\r\n\r\nset  in  the  user  market by the forces  of  demand  and\r\n\r\nsupply.  For instance, as quoted by my colleague, Mr  Tan\r\n\r\nSoo  Khoon,  the  25th June issue of Streats  quoted  the\r\n\r\nChairman of the Singapore School Transport Association as\r\n\r\nsaying,  \"The  economy is so bad, how to increase  fares?\r\n\r\nIf  parents cannot afford it, they might decide  to  send\r\n\r\ntheir children to school by other methods, and that  will\r\n\r\nmake  it worse for us.  Even if an increase is necessary,\r\n\r\nit  would  be  better to wait until next year.\"   Indeed,\r\n\r\nfollowing  this,  the 2nd July issue of  Streats  further\r\n\r\nreported  that  the  school bus fees will  be  raised  by\r\n\r\nbetween  $10-$40 per month, but probably from next  year,\r\n\r\nwhen  the  economic storm would have most  likely  passed\r\n\r\nover.   This  begs  the  question:  why  can  the  public\r\n\r\ntransport  operators not do likewise?  Granted there  is,\r\n\r\nof course, never a good or right time to raise fares but,\r\n\r\nsurely,  the transport operators and PTC could  not  have\r\n\r\npicked a worse time.  Indeed, many would agree that there\r\n\r\ncould definitely be a better time to do so.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>6.10 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on communication of the fare hikes. Sir,\r\n\r\nI am also somewhat concerned\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout the manner in which the PTC's decision on the  fare\r\n\r\nhikes  has been communicated, or perhaps not communicated\r\n\r\nto   the  commuting  public.   This,  in  my  view,   has\r\n\r\nexacerbated  the problem and deepened the  bitterness  of\r\n\r\nthe  citizens.  As one Singaporean wrote to me, it is not\r\n\r\nso  much  the  issue of affordability that  has  got  the\r\n\r\nnormally passive \"boh chap\" public infuriated, but rather\r\n\r\nthat  it  was  uncompassionate and weakly justified.   It\r\n\r\nwent against the spirit of \"he qing he li\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PTC was reported as saying that annual reviews\r\n\r\nof fare proposals are the norm so that there should be no\r\n\r\nsurprises from now on, implying that the public should be\r\n\r\nprepared for annual fare increases, thus giving  ex  ante\r\n\r\njustification to future hikes, even before  they  happen.\r\n\r\nComing  at  a  time when the Government is earnestly  re-looking at every nook and cranny on how to reduce  costs,\r\n\r\nthis   is   an  especially  difficult  pill  to  swallow.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the rationale cited for the increase is that\r\n\r\nthe  higher  fares  are meant to cover  public  transport\r\n\r\nservice improvements and wage increases.  The public, and\r\n\r\nI  myself, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, confess that  we  have\r\n\r\ngreat  difficulty  coming  to grips  with  this  line  of\r\n\r\nreasoning  at a time when many Ministers are urging  wage\r\n\r\nrestraint and belt tightening.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been said that the bus and public\r\n\r\ntransport  companies need to earn a  reasonable  rate  of\r\n\r\nreturn  for  their shareholders.  What is a  \"reasonable\"\r\n\r\nrate  of  return that is acceptable for public  transport\r\n\r\ncompanies?  It must be noted that the transport operators\r\n\r\nare  much like monopolies for the routes they cover  and,\r\n\r\nas  one  of  the  PTC's term of reference  is  to  review\r\n\r\napplications for fare hikes taking into account the  need\r\n\r\nfor  operators  to  remain financially viable,  it  would\r\n\r\nappear  that the financial viability of the operators  is\r\n\r\nvirtually guaranteed.  This being the case, the  risk  to\r\n\r\nthe  operators  is  low and, thus, the expected  rate  of\r\n\r\nreturn  to  the  operators  should  also  correspondingly\r\n\r\nreflect   this   low  risk.   Minister  Yeo   cited   the\r\n\r\npractically default risk-free Government bond  rate,  and\r\n\r\nconcluded  that the 6% return that SMRT was  expected  to\r\n\r\nearn\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafter the fare hike was \"reasonable\".  Accepting the fact\r\n\r\nthat  listed companies need to show a reasonable rate  of\r\n\r\nreturn  and profit figures, it is conceivable that,  like\r\n\r\nall  business entities, these profit figures  and,  thus,\r\n\r\nthe  rate of return, would fluctuate over time.  In fact,\r\n\r\nmany  private companies are losing money or just breaking\r\n\r\neven, under current adverse economic conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in such times, it is only reasonable that\r\n\r\ntransport operators should not expect their desired  rate\r\n\r\nof  return  or  the  level of profit  to  be  maintained.\r\n\r\nTherein  lies  the public's alarm over the  justification\r\n\r\nthat  has  been  given - that public transport  operators\r\n\r\nneed  to  make  a  reasonable  rate  of  return,  as   if\r\n\r\nmaintaining their rate of return or level of profit is  a\r\n\r\nbirthright.   It  can, of course, be argued  that  public\r\n\r\ninterest is not safeguarded if listed transport companies\r\n\r\noperate  at a loss, since service standards will  plummet\r\n\r\nand  these companies, to protect their shareholders, will\r\n\r\ncut corners.  While this may be true in the long term, it\r\n\r\nis  hard  to  accept  this in the  short  term  when  the\r\n\r\ntransport companies are still showing healthy profits and\r\n\r\nwhen  the  rest  of Singapore Inc. are reeling  from  the\r\n\r\neffects of recession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister if the public\r\n\r\ntransport companies have proven to the PTC that they will\r\n\r\nbe  in the red in the next six to 12 months, if fares are\r\n\r\nnot  increased?   If so, what are the compelling  reasons\r\n\r\nand information that had been offered in support of their\r\n\r\nclaim?   Even accepting the rationale that small  regular\r\n\r\nhikes  are  better  than big jumps,  have  the  transport\r\n\r\noperators  shown the PTC that if the hikes were  deferred\r\n\r\nfor,  say,  a  year, there would be a need for  increases\r\n\r\nthat   would   be  so  astronomical  as  to  be   clearly\r\n\r\nunpalatable  to commuters?  If so, what is the  magnitude\r\n\r\nof increases they are forecasting?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to highlight the issue on the\r\n\r\nrole  of the PTC.  Like many of my colleagues before  me,\r\n\r\nwe  feel that central to this whole debate about the fare\r\n\r\nhikes  is  the role of the PTC, which has come under  the\r\n\r\nspotlight.  In the present\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nscheme of things, the PTC is the watchdog to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe  increases  in fares are not excessive.   The  recent\r\n\r\nepisode,  however, does raise some questions as  to  what\r\n\r\nexactly  PTC does in discharging its duties  as  a  final\r\n\r\narbiter in the pricing of public transport fares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What exactly is the PTC's role? The Public\r\n\r\nTransport  Council  Act  states  that  the  PTC  fulfills\r\n\r\nseveral  functions,  one  of  which  is  to  review   any\r\n\r\napplication  by  public  transport  companies  to  revise\r\n\r\nfares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 24 of the Act specifically states that in\r\n\r\ncarrying  out  this review role, the PTC must  take  into\r\n\r\naccount  two factors, namely, the need for the  applicant\r\n\r\nto  remain  financially viable and the  need  for  public\r\n\r\ninterest  to be safeguarded.  The Act does not spell  out\r\n\r\nin  what manner these two somewhat conflicting objectives\r\n\r\nare   to  be  balanced.   Presumably,  that  becomes   an\r\n\r\nadministrative choice for the PTC to make, having  regard\r\n\r\nto the circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is currently quite a widespread public\r\n\r\nperception that the scales have tilted in favour  of  the\r\n\r\nformer, perhaps at the expense of the latter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of the PTC's role, which has come\r\n\r\nunder  scrutiny,  is  the formula  employed  to  cap  any\r\n\r\napproved increases in transport fare, CPI + X%.   We  are\r\n\r\ntold  that  they rely on the formula of CPI  +  x%  as  a\r\n\r\ncapping  for the fare hike in any one year.   X,  we  are\r\n\r\nalso told, takes into account service improvements and is\r\n\r\npegged at 1.5% per annum from 2001 to 2005.  How is  this\r\n\r\n1.5% determined?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the formula, how does the PTC evaluate the\r\n\r\ncase for fare hikes and how does it finally decide on the\r\n\r\nactual quantum of increases?  What factors does it really\r\n\r\nconsider?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this in the interest of the shareholders or the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the  commuting public?  How  does  the  PTC\r\n\r\nensure that all relevant factors, including the state  of\r\n\r\nthe economy and the employment situation\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare adequately and appropriately taken into account?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, what is the nature of X? How does it\r\n\r\naccount  for service improvements?  And by what  measures\r\n\r\nare  these  service improvements determined?   And  whose\r\n\r\nmeasure  is it, the transport companies or the  commuting\r\n\r\npublic?   These  are  some questions that  arise  as  one\r\n\r\nlooks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, another aspect is the composition of the PTC.\r\n\r\nAn  examination of the present composition  reveals  that\r\n\r\nthe  majority  of  the  members  comprise  professionals,\r\n\r\nacademics  and  Government officials, many  of  whom,  it\r\n\r\nwould be fair to say, do not take public transport.   The\r\n\r\ncomposition could thus be changed or widened  to  include\r\n\r\nmore  union members and grassroots leaders who  are  more\r\n\r\nattuned  to the needs of the public transport  users  and\r\n\r\nthus  can give better feedback regarding public transport\r\n\r\nservice, reliability and ground sentiments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All said, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the Public\r\n\r\nTransport  Council  should  be  public  enough  for   its\r\n\r\ndeliberations and decisions to be made more  transparent.\r\n\r\nAfter  all, the PTC Act states that every member, officer\r\n\r\nand  employee of the Council shall be deemed to be public\r\n\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would therefore not be too much to ask the PTC to\r\n\r\nsolicit  as  much  feedback as possible, especially  from\r\n\r\ncommuters and those that can appropriately represent them\r\n\r\nbefore any decision on fare hikes is made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the PTC must list and explain in\r\n\r\ngreater detail the factors it considers when deciding  on\r\n\r\nsuch  changes.  In order for the decision to go down well\r\n\r\nwith  the  public,  it must be reasoned  and  reasonable.\r\n\r\nSurely, the public interest is served by doing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, because our system is a monopoly, the\r\n\r\nreal answer must lie in the controlled introduction of  a\r\n\r\ncompetitive element that acts as check and balance  price\r\n\r\nincreases and the degree to which\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  so-called  service improvements are truly  what  the\r\n\r\nconsumers desire.  A watchdog can only do so much.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noted that the Minister for Transport has\r\n\r\nalready  indicated  that the Government  is  prepared  to\r\n\r\nallow  additional players to operate feeder  services  in\r\n\r\nHDB  towns on a trial basis.  Sir, I would like  to  urge\r\n\r\nthe  Government to implement this as soon as possible  to\r\n\r\ninject  more  competition, provide commuters some  choice\r\n\r\nand also establish additional pricing benchmarks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to urge this\r\n\r\nGovernment to re-look at our public transport policy  and\r\n\r\nmake changes, such as to the mechanism for fare increases\r\n\r\nso  that equity, as much as efficiency, will characterise\r\n\r\nour approach to the electorate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to this current unfortunate increase in\r\n\r\npublic  transport  fares, I appeal to the  Government  to\r\n\r\nprove  the cynics wrong by taking concrete steps to  show\r\n\r\nthat  it  has  listened to the people and taken  heed  of\r\n\r\ntheir  concerns  and  frustrations.   I  would  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  at the minimum, to look at ways to  mitigate\r\n\r\nthe  impact  of  the recent fare hikes,  particularly  on\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who cannot afford the fare increases,  such\r\n\r\nas the unemployed and the poor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Motion\r\n\r\nstanding  in the name of Mr Tan Soo Khoon.  Our recession\r\n\r\nhas  not  fully  recovered.  Many ordinary  citizens  are\r\n\r\nfaced  with  the predicament of wage-cut or  retrenchment\r\n\r\nand,  all  of  a  sudden,  the Public  Transport  Council\r\n\r\nannounced  that  it had agreed with the public  transport\r\n\r\noperators'  request to increase the bus  and  MRT  fares.\r\n\r\nThe  reason  given for the fare hike was that the  profit\r\n\r\nwas not enough for the operators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time of difficulty, increasing the fares of\r\n\r\nthe  bus and MRT is adding more problems to our citizens.\r\n\r\nOn  top  of  that,  there  were  various  increases,  for\r\n\r\nexample,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrefuse  charges,  electricity tariffs,  etc.  So,  people\r\n\r\ncannot help but ask why has the Government not taken into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the  problems in this time  of  recession.\r\n\r\nThe  Government should be more sensitive in dealing  with\r\n\r\nall future price increases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this recent increase in bus and MRT fares, on\r\n\r\nthe  surface, it is just an increase of three  cents  per\r\n\r\ntrip.  But, taking a conservative number of three million\r\n\r\npassenger-trips  per  day,  there is  an  additional  $24\r\n\r\nmillion  of profit after tax for the operators.  What  is\r\n\r\nthe  implication  of  this?  Now,  the  public  transport\r\n\r\ncompany's  net profit is about $100 million. This  three-cent  adjustment would have generated an  additional  24%\r\n\r\nincrease    in  the  after-tax  profit  for  the   public\r\n\r\ntransport  operators.  As  it is,  the  public  transport\r\n\r\noperators  are already making profits, the  24%  increase\r\n\r\nwould  push  the profits to an unbelievable high  figure.\r\n\r\nWhy do I say that?  From the annual report of the SBS bus\r\n\r\ncompany,  we could see the net tangible asset  per  share\r\n\r\nhas  increased by 10 cents every year, from 30  cents  in\r\n\r\n1997 to 60 cents in 2000.  It meant an average growth  of\r\n\r\n25% in the NTA every year. The same was also reflected in\r\n\r\nthe  annual  net  profit after tax from  1998,  1999  and\r\n\r\n2000.  The after-tax profit is more than 20% of  its  net\r\n\r\nassets.   These  public transport operators  have  earned\r\n\r\nmore  than 20% in profit from our commuters, and yet they\r\n\r\nfeel  that  this  was not enough. They want  to  increase\r\n\r\nanother  24% in their profit through this fare  increase.\r\n\r\nIf  they  do  this now, it is very insensitive  and  many\r\n\r\npeople  are  already saying that these  public  transport\r\n\r\ncompanies  are too greedy. The bus companies are  earning\r\n\r\nmore than 20% of profit.  Is it reasonable?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very interesting question. As we all know,\r\n\r\nin  all  investments if the risk is greater,  the  return\r\n\r\nmust  be higher; otherwise, the investors would have lost\r\n\r\neverything  if  anything  goes  wrong.   But  for   those\r\n\r\ninvestments with little or no risk, should the return  on\r\n\r\ninvestment be as good as those with a high risk?  This is\r\n\r\nsomething that the PTC should look into. As we all  know,\r\n\r\nif  we want to invest conservatively in a safe and secure\r\n\r\nenvironment, we can always put our money in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfixed  deposits or buy some securities or bonds.  We  can\r\n\r\nonly earn about 5-6% in returns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us look at the public transport operators'\r\n\r\ninvestments. There are a few characteristics.  First,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  there  are  two monopolised  territories  for\r\n\r\nthese  two companies to operate.  Sir, the citizens  have\r\n\r\nno choice. They have to take the bus services provided by\r\n\r\nthese  two operators.  There is definitely no competition\r\n\r\nin  the  market  and through TransitLink, Government  had\r\n\r\nrestructured all those unprofitable routes  to  cut  loss\r\n\r\nand, of course, their profits would go up. For those  bus\r\n\r\nroutes  which are not so profitable, they can  use  other\r\n\r\nmeans.  For example, they would ask the PTC to make  some\r\n\r\nfare adjustments so that their profits could be secured.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sure-win investment for the public\r\n\r\ntransport companies.  The risk is almost zero.  In a risk-free investment, yet they are making profits of more than\r\n\r\n20%.  In my personal view, their profit is much too high.\r\n\r\nI  hope that the Government could look squarely into this\r\n\r\nmatter.   Do  not allow these public transport  operators\r\n\r\nwhich  are operating on a monopoly and with no  risk  any\r\n\r\nmore  protection  to  secure hefty  profits.   We  should\r\n\r\nalleviate the burden of the commuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This present round of price hike is wrong, in timing\r\n\r\nand  in  magnitude. I think the PTC should look seriously\r\n\r\ninto this matter.  They should not side the operators  at\r\n\r\nthe  expense of our commuters.  I think they should  look\r\n\r\nafter  the interest of the commuters first, the  ordinary\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  was  a  member  of  the  Cost   Review\r\n\r\nCommittee.   It was convened twice in 1993 and  1996.  At\r\n\r\nthat  time,  people were very unhappy about the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving.   In 1996, people were concerned about  transport\r\n\r\ncost.   At the same time, they were concerned about other\r\n\r\ncosts - medical treatment, housing, education.  The  Cost\r\n\r\nReview Committee\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  looked  at the plight of the poor and the  elderly.\r\n\r\nIt  also studied household debts and warned against over-consumption  in  housing.  The impact  of  GST  was  also\r\n\r\nexamined.   The reports of the Cost Review Committee  are\r\n\r\nstill worth reading.  Perhaps the relevant Ministries can\r\n\r\nupdate the information.  This would tell us whether costs\r\n\r\nhave  gone up unreasonably and whether anything needs  to\r\n\r\nbe  done.  A study of the old reports would also tell  us\r\n\r\nthe  basic  components in the cost of different services.\r\n\r\nI  think  it  would  be  good  for  all  Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nunderstand these bread and butter issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, people are unhappy today because they are\r\n\r\nworried.   Business in the HDB heartlands is still  poor.\r\n\r\nWorkers are worried about jobs.  Wages have been trimmed.\r\n\r\nSo,  of  course, they worry when prices go up. And public\r\n\r\ntransport  cost is a big item of expenditure.  They  have\r\n\r\nto  spend on transport every day. So, when fares  go  up,\r\n\r\nthey  get very upset.  They worry more about whether they\r\n\r\ncan cope. Worse still, what if they lose their jobs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feedback I got is not that they object to fare\r\n\r\nincrease.   They  know  that  fellow  workers  in  public\r\n\r\ntransport  also have to earn a living.  What  people  are\r\n\r\nunhappy  about  is  the  timing.  Is  the  fare  increase\r\n\r\nreasonable?   Sir, the Cost Review Committee  recommended\r\n\r\nthat fare increases be made in small steps so that people\r\n\r\ncan cope.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, for those who paid cash, feeder bus\r\n\r\nfares,  ie, airconditioned buses, went up by a big  jump,\r\n\r\nfrom  60  cents to 70 cents.  That rankles, and it  still\r\n\r\nrankles.  Now, it goes up another 10 cents, together with\r\n\r\nother  fare adjustments.  The story is the same for  non-airconditioned  buses.  It went up from 50  cents  to  60\r\n\r\ncents,  and  now to 70 cents.  Those who use the  ez-link\r\n\r\ncard  can now pay 58 cents for non-air-conditioned  buses\r\n\r\nand  63 cents for airconditioned buses.  After one  week,\r\n\r\nmost  commuters  find the change not so significant,  but\r\n\r\nthere  are others who do.  The feeder bus fare  is  still\r\n\r\nhigh  in  their view, especially for short distances.   I\r\n\r\nthink  the  problem is not whether the fare  increase  is\r\n\r\nlarge or small.  It is how it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimplemented.   Why  the  hefty  jump  in  feeder   fares?\r\n\r\nHardest  hit  are the housewives and retirees.   Why  not\r\n\r\nsmall  steps?  I cannot understand why the old fare  card\r\n\r\ncannot  allow increases of less than 5 cents.   If  there\r\n\r\nwas  a software or hardware problem, why was it not fixed\r\n\r\nearlier?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there is the ez-link card. It is new. Surely,\r\n\r\nthe  public  transport  operators  must  expect  teething\r\n\r\nproblems in implementation.  If so, was it wise to  raise\r\n\r\nfares  at the same time?  Do they know that those who  do\r\n\r\nnot  use cards are the poorest Singaporeans?  They cannot\r\n\r\nafford  it.   They do odd jobs, and so they do  not  have\r\n\r\nenough money to store in the card, or they are afraid  to\r\n\r\nuse  it, especially the old.  So they use cash.  The fare\r\n\r\nincrease is highest for those who pay cash.  So those who\r\n\r\ncannot  afford it are the ones who pay most.  Should  not\r\n\r\nthe  public  transport operators do something  for  them?\r\n\r\nThe basic issue seems to be not so much whether fares can\r\n\r\ngo  up,  but  the  timing.  How it is done,  and  whether\r\n\r\npublic  transport  operators understand their  customers?\r\n\r\nMaybe  it  will  help  if the public transport  operators\r\n\r\nappoint  one  or  two laymen, people who  can  understand\r\n\r\ntheir  customers,  on the Board of Directors.   Maybe  it\r\n\r\nwill also help if there is more than just one unionist on\r\n\r\nthe  Public Transport Council to provide a stronger voice\r\n\r\nfor the working class.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  when someone mentions 9-11, we know he is referring\r\n\r\nto the tragedy that happened to the World Trade Centre in\r\n\r\nNew York, an event that shocked the whole world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, an announcement by the Public\r\n\r\nTransport Council (PTC)  on 11th June created a storm  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and the general public here responded  almost\r\n\r\nimmediately with unhappiness, to a magnitude rarely heard\r\n\r\nof in the past. I shall call it the \"6-11\" event.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people, in general, commented that what should\r\n\r\nnot  have  gone up, have gone up, but those  that  should\r\n\r\nhave  gone  up,  do  not go up. In  a  time  of  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn, the various charges - tariffs,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfees,  prices, bus fares, parking, ERP etc,  -  ought  to\r\n\r\nhave gone down to alleviate the burden of the people, but\r\n\r\nthey  have  gone up instead! Other things such as  wages,\r\n\r\nshare  market, etc, should have gone up, but they tumbled\r\n\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This \"6-11\" event has brought about a big debate in\r\n\r\nthe  media  and  at the coffee shops.  As  to  the  media\r\n\r\ndebate,  generally, we see all sorts of topics  discussed\r\n\r\nand debated in the various language newspapers. But since\r\n\r\n6-11,  we  read  nothing  but  complaints  and  arguments\r\n\r\nagainst  the  bus and MRT fare hikes.  We have  read  the\r\n\r\nreply  of  the Prime Minister, the Minister for Transport\r\n\r\nand  other  leaders.   As mentioned by  some  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  who  have spoken before me,  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  were  asked whether they had read and  understood\r\n\r\nthese explanations. More often than not, they would reply\r\n\r\nthat  they  had not because the speeches were complicated\r\n\r\nor  too  lengthy. Those who had the time  to  read  these\r\n\r\nspeeches  did  not  understand  them.  Those  who   could\r\n\r\nunderstand  them  did not read them.  This  is  what  the\r\n\r\nHokkiens  would say, khua bo (see no), and  bo  khua  (no\r\n\r\nsee).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general feeling, as reflected in the media, is\r\n\r\nthat the Government has its reasons but it cannot explain\r\n\r\nit  clearly to the people.  In the coffee shops, we  hear\r\n\r\npeople complaining that the Government has not been  fair\r\n\r\nto them. They said, \"The Government says business cost is\r\n\r\nhigh.   To save the companies and our jobs, they cut  our\r\n\r\nwages.  They compare our wages to those in China.   Then,\r\n\r\nwhen  Government  says  our  bus  fares  are  cheap   and\r\n\r\naffordable,  they  compare them to those  in  the  United\r\n\r\nStates  and  Europe. Why does the Government not  compare\r\n\r\nour bus fares with  China and Vietnam, and our wages with\r\n\r\nEurope  and  USA instead? You cannot compare  our  durian\r\n\r\nwith  the  lychee  in China, and our pineapple  with  the\r\n\r\ngrapes  in the USA.  Let us compare apple with apple,  or\r\n\r\norange with orange.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After \"6-11\", whether it is in the public media or\r\n\r\nin  the coffee shops, the general feeling is unfavourable\r\n\r\nto the Government.  While the Government has the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreasons  but cannot explain them, the people  have  their\r\n\r\ngrievances and who is going to listen to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have so many Members taking part in this debate\r\n\r\non the Motion.  I am joining in not just to add a number.\r\n\r\nI  also have something to say.  I had taken public  buses\r\n\r\nduring my school days. To get home from school, I had  to\r\n\r\ntake  two buses. Very often, in order to save 5 cents,  I\r\n\r\nwould  walk  all  the way from Tuan Mong School  in  Tank\r\n\r\nRoad,  took a short-cut and cut across Fort Canning  Hill\r\n\r\nto  take a bus along Dhoby Ghaut to get home. This was to\r\n\r\nsave one bus-trip from Tank Road to Dhoby Ghaut.  On  one\r\n\r\noccasion,  I  was  robbed of my wrist-watch  when  I  was\r\n\r\nwalking  across King George V Park. My father  bought  me\r\n\r\nanother watch. It was subsequently that I learnt that  he\r\n\r\nhad  to  borrow money to buy me the watch, as he realised\r\n\r\nthe importance of keeping time.  So, I empathise with the\r\n\r\npoor people. I know and could appreciate that to the poor\r\n\r\npeople,  5  cents is not a small matter.  To them,  every\r\n\r\ncent counts. Of course, time has changed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a Director of SBS for three years. I\r\n\r\nsubsequently  resigned to avoid a conflict  of  interest.\r\n\r\nDuring those three years, I had the opportunity to  learn\r\n\r\nand  understand the operation of the SBS.  At one of  the\r\n\r\nshareholders' meetings, a shareholder asked, \"I have been\r\n\r\nbuying  your shares, why are your share prices not  going\r\n\r\nup?  What  have you people been doing?  I am an old  man.\r\n\r\nWhy  is  it that you never give concessions to the senior\r\n\r\ncitizens?  Why is your dividend so little?\"   These three\r\n\r\nquestions are easy to answer.  You want your share prices\r\n\r\nto  go  up, you must make more money. When you make  more\r\n\r\nmoney, you can then give more dividends. When you want to\r\n\r\nmake  more  money,  you cannot afford to give concessions\r\n\r\nto the senior citizens or even the shareholders. You have\r\n\r\nthe  answer, but it hurts the feelings of people. I  know\r\n\r\nthe difficulties of the bus operators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even now, I occasionally travel by public buses.\r\n\r\nPeople  have  asked me, \"You are  a Member of Parliament,\r\n\r\nwhy are you\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaking public buses?\"  I do so to have a first-hand  feel\r\n\r\nof  the  bus commuters. I have a better understanding  of\r\n\r\nthe behaviour of the commuters and their expectations.  I\r\n\r\nrealise that our bus services have changed, but there are\r\n\r\ncertain aspects which remain unchanged.  Mr Khaw Boon Wan\r\n\r\nsaid  that   there  were  some  misconceptions  over  the\r\n\r\ngrounds  for this round of fare hike, and he    mentioned\r\n\r\nthe  four  pillars of the public bus services.   I  agree\r\n\r\nwith his views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in this debate on the Motion\r\n\r\nbefore the House, there is no question of who wins or who\r\n\r\nloses.  At  the end of the day, all of us in this  House,\r\n\r\nand  the  people outside this House, will have  a  better\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of  the rationale and  background  of  the\r\n\r\ndecision-making process.  I say after the debate, we will\r\n\r\nbe  clearer about the reasons and Singapore can progress.\r\n\r\nTo complement SMS Khaw Boon Wan's four misconceptions and\r\n\r\nfour pillars, let me present my four views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Government must know the background of\r\n\r\nthe  people  they  talk  to.  The feedback  is  that  the\r\n\r\nMinisters'  speeches are long, and the Ministries'  press\r\n\r\nreleases  too  technical  and too  academic  -  too  many\r\n\r\nstatistics,  too many figures.  People do not understand.\r\n\r\nWhen   they   do   not   understand,   there   will    be\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding.   Ministers and senior  civil  servants\r\n\r\nmust  know who are the people they are talking to.  Speak\r\n\r\nthe  language  they  understand, so to  speak.   We  must\r\n\r\ntailor our text to suit the audience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, check the timing whenever you want to\r\n\r\nincrease  fees.   We are not against fare  increases  but\r\n\r\nplease, pick the right time to implement them.  This time\r\n\r\nround,  we  see  and  hear  price  increases,  one  after\r\n\r\nanother,  and sometimes everyone is rushing  to  increase\r\n\r\nthe fees, and at this time of recession too!  So, when we\r\n\r\nwant to up the  prices, we must look at the timing.   The\r\n\r\ntiming must be good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we must see long term. Both the people and\r\n\r\nthe  Government  must always bear in mind  the  long-term\r\n\r\nimplications of all changes.  Just now, former\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker  Mr Tan Soo Khoon said that people were remarking\r\n\r\nthat  all  these  price increases were carried  out  only\r\n\r\nafter  the General Election.  If we are not careful,  one\r\n\r\nof these days, the PAP may just disappear, and it will be\r\n\r\na very sad day indeed.  So, do we want the PAP Government\r\n\r\nto  disappear  just because of this fare  increase?   One\r\n\r\nmust look at the long term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hope that the enterprises, the Government\r\n\r\nand  the people will look at the big picture.  Our region\r\n\r\nis  in  trouble.   We are in for uncertainty.   Everybody\r\n\r\nmust look at the big picture.  This is very important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, my four views are, first, the Ministers\r\n\r\nand senior civil servants must know their target audience\r\n\r\nwhen  they speak.  Secondly, when we increase prices,  we\r\n\r\nmust  watch the timing.  Thirdly, when we do things,  all\r\n\r\nmust  look  at the long-term implications; and, fourthly,\r\n\r\neverybody must look at the big picture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMS Khaw Boon Wan talked about a woman who chose to\r\n\r\nwalk  instead  of taking a feeder bus.   Let  me  tell  a\r\n\r\nlittle  joke to conclude my speech.  When the  fares  for\r\n\r\nfeeder bus went up last year, some\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  remarked that instead of taking the  feeder  bus,\r\n\r\nwhy  do you not chase after them instead of riding in it.\r\n\r\nThis way, you keep fit and, at the same time, save on the\r\n\r\nbus  fares.   That being the case, why chase  the  feeder\r\n\r\nbus?   Why do you not chase the taxis instead?  This way,\r\n\r\nyou save more!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate be now adjourned. - [Mr Mah Bow\r\n\r\nTan].\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Tan, debate to be resumed on\r\n\r\nwhat day?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Tomorrow, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Twenty minutes to Seven o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
