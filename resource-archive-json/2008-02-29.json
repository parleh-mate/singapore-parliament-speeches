That the total sum to be allocated for Head Q of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what is a place with production lines&nbsp;but no arts and culture?&nbsp; It is called a plain vanilla factory.&nbsp; Sir, what is a nation without arts and culture? &nbsp;It will be without a soul and imagination. &nbsp;Would this be a place to&nbsp;attract the top talents?&nbsp; Obviously not.&nbsp; In the race for top talents, a strong arts and culture sector turns&nbsp;a high-skill, high-innovation economy into a great, liveable place.&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud MICA&rsquo;s effort&nbsp;to promote the Renaissance City plan.&nbsp; In 2006, MICA spent $31.2 million to support hundreds of artists and events.&nbsp; Revenue generated amounted to $3.45 billion in 2006 and $3.67 billion in 2007&nbsp;&ndash; a&nbsp;tremendous value-add to our economy. &nbsp;However,&nbsp;I&nbsp;fear the&nbsp;efforts at promoting arts and culture could be shortchanged by the narrow criteria set as definitions of success and KPIs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MICA prides itself on supporting&nbsp;hundreds of arts-related activities with thousands of attendees.&nbsp; Funding criteria are very much numbers-focused.&nbsp; However, quantity is not always quality.&nbsp; Arts and culture take time to evolve and be integrated into everyday life.&nbsp; A more sustainable way of nurturing the arts is to identify key stakeholders and focus on building the Renaissance City eco-system.&nbsp; To this end, why not have yearly awards to glam up and focus the sectors on measurements that build the eco-system?&nbsp;&nbsp;Awards can be open to all arts-related events, including artistic productions, fashion shows, corporate and grassroots events, indoor and outdoor performances, and so on.&nbsp; Some suggestions are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The most experiential and creative arts production of the year Award\", judged based on the innovative idea, impact an event has on its audience, audience participation strategy, inspiration quotient, and so on.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; \"The arts or event organiser of the year Award\", judged based on the evidence of clear strategic thinking, marketing effectiveness, cost per audience, return on investment and audience interaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; We could also have&nbsp;\"The best backroom support provider of the year Award\", given to the props&nbsp;or audio visual technical experts that enhance the artists&rsquo; works.&nbsp; Criteria include&nbsp;how innovative solutions to a client&rsquo;s brief were arrived at and executed,&nbsp;cost effectiveness and audience endorsement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;We could also have \"The most buzz event of the year Award\", judged based on its media hit rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list&nbsp;goes on, but it suffices to show that arts and culture can be measured with a more liberal set of KPIs than mere audience numbers. &nbsp;Otherwise, events that&nbsp;offer goodie bags and lucky draws may overwhelm the funding pie.&nbsp; KPIs should aim at nurturing the critical paths and stakeholders, involving the private, public and people sectors to produce a multiplier effect.&nbsp; Nurture the stakeholders, provide a favourable tax and open environment and allow the arts and culture eco-system to flourish.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally,&nbsp;can the Minister provide an update on:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) &nbsp;The excellent Renaissance City Plan, 3.0?<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) &nbsp;The School of the Arts?<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Amidst the flurry of the infrastructure built and the tickets sold, I would like to pause and ask:&nbsp; Are we a creative city or a karaoke city?&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A creative city is marked by innovation, ideas and an authentic cultural vibrancy.&nbsp; A karaoke city is one which excels at stylish imitation, taking a well-sung song and putting its own rendition on it.&nbsp; The Integrated Resorts, the Singapore Flyer and the F1 race, these add to our buzz, but I would argue they do little to project Singapore as a creative city.&nbsp; They may be good ideas, but they are not ours.&nbsp; We have the Arts Festival, the Biennale and many arts events.&nbsp; But we should take stock.&nbsp; How have we invested in creating something unique which builds on our strong traditions and heritage and which will leave a cultural legacy not only for Singapore but for the rest of the world?&nbsp; How are we tapping our indigenous cultural capital to recreate our city to turn public spaces into aesthetic experiences that move our spirit?&nbsp; How generously and actively do we commission artistic and musical works to Singaporeans, take risks with them and pioneer their work in Singapore and other parts of the world?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to devote more funds to our Singapore arts groups.&nbsp; The budget for our National Arts Council seems puny, compared to that of the arts councils in major cultural cities. &nbsp;This year, I see that it receives 2.6% more over last year's budget.&nbsp; This will hardly keep up with inflation.&nbsp; What progress has been made to inculcate an appreciation of our heritage and to strengthen the Singapore heartbeat to the creation and sharing of Singapore stories, be it film, theatre, dance, music, literature or the visual arts?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, cities need stories of cultural narratives about themselves, to both anchor and drive identity as well as to galvanise residents.&nbsp; A city which describes itself as we do, as a global city of opportunity with its economic undertones fosters different behavioural patterns in citizens than a city that projects itself as a city of culture, a creative city or a city of ideas.&nbsp; Adelaide, which started the Festival of Ideas in 1999, explicitly conceives of itself as a thinking city.&nbsp; It invites thinkers from all over the world to assist South Australia to build on its climate of creativity.&nbsp; The ideas festival has since been copied by other cities, such as Bristol and Aspen.&nbsp; We have the Renaissance City plan.&nbsp; But my sense is that we do not see or project ourselves as a renaissance city as such.&nbsp; \"Renaissance\" is French for rebirth.&nbsp; It implies a flowering of ideas, an openness to novel and even strange ones.&nbsp; It implies a period in which artistic, social, scientific and political thought turn in new directions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are serious about becoming a Renaissance City, we should take a more relaxed approach to some of our old policies which may be too cautious for this great task before us.&nbsp; The incident involving the Complaints Choir highlights the historical mindset against foreigners that seems out of place in our arts scene today.&nbsp; Collaborations between different arts groups from different parts of the world are part of the creative process in this globalised world.&nbsp; With the better educated and more cosmopolitan population, should we not allow our citizens to listen to different views, wherever they come from, and make their own judgment?&nbsp; Beyond the two subjects&nbsp;which we should stay off-limits, ie, race and religion, why should we fear foreign talents working with our arts groups to produce something that may touch on life and politics in Singapore?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be honest, I was not too exercised about the Complaints Choir incident because:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand what we need to learn from two Finns on how to complain.&nbsp; We are very good at that already; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see what is so creative about singing complaints that&nbsp;Singaporeans are already mouthing to themselves every day, ie,&nbsp;karaoke.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I thought that MICA's decision to clamp down on the foreigners in this group jarred like a chalk screeching across the board.&nbsp; The notion of a creative city, as opposed to a karaoke city, implies a level of openness that might potentially be unsettling to some.&nbsp; We should be ready for that and be more relaxed if we are serious about our quest to be a global arts city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another event we should prepare for is the 2010 Youth Olympic Games.&nbsp; We should treat this major event not only as a sporting event but also as a major cultural festival with effects lasting long after the Games are gone.&nbsp; I would urge MICA to start planning for this and to involve our creative and cultural sector.&nbsp; We should use this opportunity to regenerate the cultural life of our cityscape, reposition Singapore and project ourselves a truly Renaissance City&nbsp;&ndash; A New City Reborn.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We have been successful in organising the Youth Olympics Games.&nbsp; That makes us cool.&nbsp; Last year, I was in China and I had the opportunity to be at the Singapore Seasons in Shanghai as well as in Beijing.&nbsp; I remember telling the Minister at the end of the show that I felt very good as a Singaporean because we were demonstrating to the Chinese that we were there&nbsp;not only for economic mutual benefits but also for cultural exchange.&nbsp; And that was cool.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the two Singapore Season events, there are two things that made the events very cool.&nbsp; One is our fusion food which I thought everybody enjoyed&nbsp;&ndash; Chinese, Singaporeans, everybody.&nbsp; There was also this thing called the fusion arts which I&nbsp;saw&nbsp;&ndash; big cultural items, multi-racial artistes going up, putting on each other's costumes, dancing, and I think the opinion for that one is a little more mixed.&nbsp; Some said&nbsp;it was neither here nor there, it was a weird mixture.&nbsp; Some of my Chinese guests who were there told me that actually they did not know what it was all about but that it was interesting.&nbsp; I suppose \"interesting\" is a very&nbsp;polite way&nbsp;of saying that, yes, it is something that I cannot understand, but thanks for the effort anyway.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think fusion art is something that we can have a unique opportunity to be innovative about, because Singapore is really a place where a lot of cultures meet&nbsp;&ndash; East and East, East and West, North East vs South East, South East vs South West&nbsp;&ndash; everybody seems to meet here because the monsoon meets here and brought our own forefathers together.&nbsp; So we have the opportunity to appreciate each other's arts, and a lot of our traditional artists come here with the immigrants and they meet, make friends, exchange and create unique brands of arts.&nbsp; Fusion art is not, as what I have said earlier, people of different ethnic groups putting on each other's costume and dancing, performing western dance.&nbsp; That is, in a sense, a kind of fusion art.&nbsp; But then we remember chemistry.&nbsp; I remember&nbsp;when we studied, one of the first experiments that we did was to mix iron powder with sulphur and, after mixing it, that is called a mixture.&nbsp; A mixture can be separated through physical method.&nbsp; You use&nbsp;a magnet and you can remove all the iron dusts.&nbsp; Or you use&nbsp;&ndash; was it called carbon disulphide?&nbsp;&ndash; you can dissolve all the sulphur, let it evaporate and you separate the sulphur from the iron.&nbsp; But if you heat it up, it becomes some kind of iron ferric type of compound.&nbsp; It can never be separated again.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think, for our fusion arts, we have achieved the mixture stage.&nbsp; The challenge is whether we can achieve some kind of a chemical reaction compound stage so that we will create something that is really unique.&nbsp; As I have said, this has already happened in the past.&nbsp; We have this very famous style of painting called the Nanyang style.&nbsp; This is basically the Chinese artists who came from China to Southeast Asia and who were influenced by the Malay way of painting as well as the Western way of painting.&nbsp; They looked at the Southeast Asian subjects and then they evolved into some unique way of painting.&nbsp; We have people like, for example, Liu Kang and Chen Wen Hsi.&nbsp; These are very, very famous world-class, or at least regional class, fusion artists.&nbsp; In the case of writing, we also have&nbsp;a group called the Malayan Chinese literature.&nbsp; Frankly, Malayan Chinese literature, in large part, means Singapore Chinese literature, because a lot of them actually worked in Singapore.&nbsp; It is just that, at that time, this place was called Malaya.&nbsp; So Malayan Chinese literary style.&nbsp; Again, Chinese writers coming to this part of the world influenced by each other's way of creativity and looking at the local subject matters and issues and evolved into a unique style of writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this has happened in the past, I am sure it can happen in the future so long as we get the compound right.&nbsp; The correct compound consists of people who are steep in multi-cultural creativity, in the sense that you have somebody who is equally good in Chinese arts as well as Western arts, there is a chance that he would evolve into a kind of unique fusion art.&nbsp; If you have somebody who is very good in Chinese arts as well as Malay arts, eg, Chen Wen Hsi and Liu Kang, it evolved into a Nanyang style of painting.&nbsp; What we need are multi-cultural types of artists.&nbsp; We now have an opportunity.&nbsp; We are going to have an Arts School.&nbsp; Part of the objectives for our education is to be multi-cultural.&nbsp; I would like to urge that the Arts School pay much attention in the multi-cultural approach to arts education so that we may have a chance to evolve our unique style of fusion arts that we can truly call Singaporean.&nbsp; Of course, this is for the future.&nbsp; If this happens, then we will have something that we can truly be proud of and feel very, very cool about&nbsp;&ndash; our unique fusion art.&nbsp; It is not only East-West.&nbsp; It is also East-East.&nbsp; It can also be North East-South East, South East-North East, South East-South West.&nbsp; In case you do not know what I mean,&nbsp;we can have many, many styles of fusion arts for the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the past, we already have all the masters that I mentioned earlier.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

These are news that many people would have learnt about&nbsp;in the media.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Arts Council has a target of 25 international awards by Singapore artists as a performance indicator. The number achieved was 20 in 2007.&nbsp; I doubt many people would have heard or knew&nbsp;about&nbsp;any of these 20 award winners&nbsp;last year, or&nbsp;of the 25 international award winners to be known this year,&nbsp;assuming that we hit the target set. I think if&nbsp;things do not change, this would be the scenario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many artists and arts groups have given&nbsp;feedback that when they received international awards overseas for their works and achievements, they often do not get&nbsp;attention in Singapore. Here, we have&nbsp;a Singapore son or daughter coming home doing the country proud, but&nbsp;there is no pat on the shoulder. The trophy is left on the shelf in the child's bedroom, collecting dust.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us look at and learn from another sector, the sports sector. The Singapore National Olympic Council initiated the Multi-Million Dollar Award Programme in 1991 as an incentive for athletes to win medals at four major international and regional games. The Singapore Totalisator Board and Asia Pacific Breweries are sponsors for these awards.&nbsp; According to the answer by MCYS to my Parliamentary Question (PQ) last month, I quote, \"The purpose of the MAP award is to recognise our athletes' individual and team efforts and sacrifices in training intensively at the elite level and attaining medal honour for the country.\" The answer also reminded that the award should be viewed as part of a comprehensive support and recognition framework for our athletes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I totally agree.&nbsp; Just like&nbsp;we have the School of the Arts now to develop young arts talents and there are the Cultural Medallion and Young Artists Awards to honour artists,&nbsp;there are similarities in the Sports School and the National&nbsp;Sportsman and Sportswoman of the Year&nbsp;awards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like MICA to consider initiating some kind of official reward system for our artists when they win a prestigious international award. The quantum of the award is not important. However, the gesture will be very significant in terms of recognising the dedication, hard work and achievement of our artists. A simple awards ceremony will also create the opportunity and interest for the media to report on, hence raising greater awareness in the public. It will also serve as a motivation for aspiring artists to persevere in the artistic journey.&nbsp; Just like the Multi-Million Dollar Award programme, it only recognises medals in the Southeast Asian Games, Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and Olympic Games, and maybe the Youth Olympic Games in the future. The National Arts Council should also identify selected established international awards for the various arts disciplines. We can start with a limited range, with an award each for dance, theatre, music, literary and visual arts.&nbsp; I am sure, with this enhancement, the artists will feel very much encouraged and this will give a lot more meaning to the 20 international award winners last year, beyond just a statistical entry to a key performance indicator for public agencies.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Hong Kah)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Exporting World-class Local Arts Talents and Productions</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Hong Kah):</B> Sir, over the last few years, we have made significant progress in our plans to turn Singapore into a creative hub. We have already established the infrastructure, but what is&nbsp;needed is how to expand our creative talent, both in terms of quantity and quality.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although we have done many promotions from Beijing to London, the perception from industry is that our programmes have not created enough world-class talents and productions. Those who have made it&nbsp;in the global arena seem to&nbsp;have&nbsp;stumbled upon their own success and we should think of more programmes to groom more such talents within a good framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promotions do not necessarily translate into sustainable creative arts business. There is a need for MICA to look at arts as serious business,&nbsp;not just about developing artistic talents, but putting in solid investments to get our fundamentals right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should develop more of our local talents, and the bigger challenge is how to make the industry an attractive career alternative, to draw more people with the potential to excel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One way to make it more attractive is to invest in our creative products and equip them not only as&nbsp;world-class products, but ones that&nbsp;are commercially viable.&nbsp; Not only&nbsp;can we get immediate attention, but it can inspire younger local talents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would MICA or the MDA consider investing to redevelop our local productions, using world-class talents in scripting and production, making them commercially relevant in the global arts sector?&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;can&nbsp;we have people like leading British producer of musicals, Cameron Mackintosh to redevelop or rewrite local productions, for example,&nbsp;Forbidden City or Fried Rice Paradise, for global export?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think&nbsp;this can be also applied to works by local Cultural Medallion winners or promising arts production houses whose works can be transformed with the help of world-class brand-name producers, designers, artists, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the millions that we spend on promoting our arts overseas, can MICA tweak its internationalisation programme to invest in young artists and production talents to be mentored by world-class artists, production houses, producers, directors, etc? &nbsp;This will enable us to set our fundamentals right locally to create quality, commercially viable productions for the global arts stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow me to continue in Malay.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Malay</I>):&nbsp; [For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20080229/20080229VS_114205.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a>*.] A long time ago, Singapore&nbsp;was renowned as the centre for the Malay film industry.

Every time, I would take one of these out-of-print books home.&nbsp; Over the years, I must have taken more than 30 of his old books and these books are not available at the shops anymore.&nbsp; They were printed in the 1950s.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1950s and 60s, these books were priced at $1 to $2 each.&nbsp; At that time, $1 or $2 was a lot of money.&nbsp; I asked my father-in-law, &ldquo;As a Chinese teacher, your salary then was just $100-$200.&nbsp; So, every month, you would spend about 1% of your salary on books.&nbsp; But you did not have the time to read them, you just kept them at home, and eventually got stolen by your son-in-law.&nbsp; Why did you persist in doing that?&nbsp; Is there any meaning in it?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My father-in-law said something which I will remember for life.&nbsp; He said, \"If I don't buy the books, who is going to support the authors?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, some 40 years after my father-in-law&rsquo;s supportive efforts for the authors, one of my former classmates wanted to publish a book on his collection of poems.&nbsp; He solicited for donations from all his classmates to meet the publication cost.&nbsp; He needed about $4,000-$5,000 to print the book.&nbsp; I asked him, \"Why don't you just publish it and you can earn your money back when the books are sold?\"&nbsp; He replied, \"Nobody would buy the book.&nbsp; I have to pay for the printing cost.&nbsp; Once the book is published, I would give a copy to each of the students of my alma mater, and I would have accomplished my mission.&nbsp; Even if nobody buys it, I do not mind.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to my father-in-law 40 years ago, I feel that we are moving backwards in the support of our culture.&nbsp; If each of us can donate 1% of our income to set up a National Cultural Fund, and ask the Government to match us dollar for dollar, I think we would have a very big endowment fund to support our cultural activities in Singapore, particularly the traditional arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why am I talking about \"traditional arts\"?&nbsp; Because events like concerts by Michael Jackson&nbsp;&ndash; I am not running him down &ndash; can easily find people who are willing and eager to support him and to buy tickets for his concerts.&nbsp; But for traditional arts, such as traditional roadside dialect <I>wayangs</I>, whether it is Cantonese or Hokkien operas, the troupes are finding it difficult to survive, as they are always having difficulties raising the money to keep their activities going.&nbsp; I have spoken to some of the volunteers who are organising these activities.&nbsp; They said, \"Every year, when we present a show, we have to put in a lot of money.&nbsp; There is a certain cost.&nbsp; The tickets cannot be sold.&nbsp; Nobody would buy the tickets.&nbsp; So we have to look for a few big sponsors or patrons for donations.&nbsp; Even with the donations, we have problems selling the tickets because nobody is interested to buy the tickets, and the theatre would be empty.&nbsp; What do we do?&nbsp; We have to go to the homes and invite the old folks to come to the shows, free of charge.&nbsp; We have done our best.\"<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not forget that most, if not all, the existing sponsors and patrons are quite elderly now.&nbsp; In 10 years' time, they may not be around or too old to continue supporting these voluntary organisations.&nbsp;&nbsp; I observe that the new sponsors are not forthcoming.&nbsp; There are no new patrons to take over.&nbsp; What is going to happen to our traditional arts?&nbsp; In the past, during the Seventh Month Festival or occasions to give thanks to the gods, we would still have the Hokkien <I>wayangs</I>.&nbsp; Some of the temples, like the Taoist temple at <I>Koo Chai Ba</I>, would put up some traditional dialect <I>wayangs</I>.&nbsp; But, nowadays, they use <I>getai</I> singing instead.&nbsp; The organisers do not even ask whether the gods would enjoy this type of performance.&nbsp; They simply go for the modern <I>getai</I>.&nbsp; And with <I>getai</I>, the traditional dramas would have no place in these festivals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, if our traditional culture were to become extinct, who shall we blame?&nbsp; But, if we were to have a National Cultural Fund, and everyone donates maybe 1% of their salary &ndash; that is not asking too much&nbsp;&ndash; and we ask the Government to match it dollar for dollar, then we can invite some of those &ldquo;national treasure&rdquo; exponents of these traditional arts from China to come and promote this traditional culture.&nbsp; There is hope that we may preserve the rich cultural heritage left behind by our ancestors to us.&nbsp; Would this not be a good thing?</p>\r\n</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 1581-1584.<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Everyday, on my way to work, I see this 18.35-metre tall sculpture by Israeli sculptor, David Gerstein.&nbsp; It depicts an upward spiral of progress capturing the energy and momentum of the district, and this gives me a sense of purpose at the start of my working day.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public sculpture donation scheme was established in 1988, to provide tax incentives to corporations and individuals who donate a sculpture to the nation.&nbsp; It used to be a tax exemption up to 100% of the value of the sculpture.&nbsp; From 2002, the exemption was increased to 200%, and I applaud that.&nbsp; However, the incentive requires the company or individual to give up ownership of the sculpture.&nbsp; On the other hand, there are tax incentives for owners who want to retain ownership of the public sculpture but the tax exemption is limited to expenses for the installation and maintenance of the sculpture.&nbsp; To encourage more public sculpture on the streets of Singapore for the enjoyment of the public, I would like to suggest that this lesser incentive scheme be enhanced to cover up to 100% of the value of the art work.&nbsp; I think that as long as there are conditions to require public access to the art work and the owner is not allowed to remove or change the sculpture, the ownership issue should not be critical.&nbsp; What is important is that the public can access and appreciate good art works.&nbsp; At the same time, the Government could also save on maintaining the sculpture.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Dr Lee Boon Yang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

A city where arts and culture thrive, bringing Singaporeans closer together, strengthening our sense of national identity and attracting talents to our city.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We knew that we had a long way to go.&nbsp; In the first phase, or RCP1 as we referred to it, we focused on building up an audience for arts and increasing the pool of artistic talents.&nbsp; This was followed by the second phase, or RCP2, in 2004, when we initiated support for artists and arts companies to venture onto the international stage.<br>\r\n<I>&nbsp;</I><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brief recap provides the backdrop for my response to Miss Penny Low and Ms Irene Ng who asked how we measure our success, whether or not the targets of RCP have been met, and how far we have strengthened the Singapore heartbeat through the creation and sharing of our artistic and cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the progress in our arts and cultural development is evident.&nbsp; Apart from <I>Monocle's</I> and many other media observations, the vibrancy of our arts and culture scene is almost palpable.&nbsp; Today, we have a list of 700 registered arts companies and societies, almost double the 400 barely 10 years ago. They actively create and produce a growing host of arts activities throughout Singapore.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, we had about 7,400 arts events, providing a total of 21,000 performances and exhibition days.&nbsp; On average, Singaporeans had a choice of over 50 arts performances and exhibitions on any one day.&nbsp; That is a lot to choose from, and nearly 40% can be enjoyed for free by the general public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low asked for MICA's share of these events.&nbsp; MICA and our agencies were responsible for approximately 15% of all the arts activities each year.&nbsp; This is a good balance.&nbsp; It shows that the arts community is taking ownership and developing followings and supporters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low also asked about the objectives of these activities and whether they are embraced by stakeholders in the wider community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the increasing number of arts activities is a good reflection of the vibrancy of our arts scene and the creativity of our artists.&nbsp; Arts events, whether it is an exhibition or a performance, are necessary for artists to communicate with their audience and to share their artistic thoughts and inspiration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Miss Penny Low that quantity does not equate quality.&nbsp; In the case of the arts, quality is&nbsp;as important, if not more important, than quantity.&nbsp; What is significant is that along with increasing arts events and participation, there is also better appreciation of the arts.&nbsp; For instance, every weekend and public holiday, we can find many Singaporeans of all ages attending public performances at the Esplanade. The National Heritage Board's (NHB) Explore Singapore and Singapore HeritageFest attract people from all walks of life to our museums and heritage institutions around the island.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our HDB heartlands, the arts are now a regular part of community life through the lessons, performances and activities that are organised by the CDCs, the community clubs and supported by the National Arts Council (NAC).&nbsp; These community arts events feature art forms as diverse as hip hop dance&nbsp;and traditional musical instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last&nbsp;10 years, the National Arts Council surveys showed that the number of Singaporeans who participated in at least&nbsp;one arts and cultural event a year had increased threefold, from&nbsp;one in 10 in 1996, to&nbsp;one in&nbsp;three today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, more Singaporeans are attending arts and cultural events.&nbsp; Ticketed attendances passed the&nbsp;one million mark in 2002 and reached 1.3 million attendances last year.&nbsp; The annual number of visitors to all museums in 2007 was over&nbsp;four million, with&nbsp;about 1.7 million visitors visiting the National Heritage Board&nbsp;museums.&nbsp; These numbers indicate that the arts performances and exhibitions were of high quality and were succeeding to connect with the audience.&nbsp; If not, I think we would be hard put to attract a growing audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This increase in arts groups and arts activities naturally leads to calls for more Government support for the arts.&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, Mr Chan Soo Sen's very eloquent call for a National Arts Fund for Government to support the arts through co-funding&nbsp;of events.&nbsp; Let me say that MICA adopts a variety of support measures, including financial support for the developing arts sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the RCP funded 50% of the grants given out by the National Arts Council.&nbsp; For example, in the year 2007, over 550 recipients benefited from the disbursement of $7.85 million in grants, scholarships and training bursaries.&nbsp; This is an increase of 20% from the amount disbursed to 468 recipients in the year 2004.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Equally important is the commissioning of new works.&nbsp; For instance, NAC regularly commissions new works for the Singapore Arts Festival.&nbsp; Some of these are subsequently performed overseas to international audiences. &nbsp;One example is&nbsp;a work called Optical Identity.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;a performance featuring the T'ang Quartet and the UK's Theatre Cryptic.&nbsp; This work premiered at the Singapore Arts Festival last year, after which it went on to perform at the Edinburgh International Festival, the Alicante International Music Festival, and a tour in Scotland for even more performances.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lee Boon Yang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, NAC&rsquo;s arts housing scheme also&nbsp;provides workspace to over 96 artists and arts groups for their operational,&nbsp;studio and&nbsp;rehearsal needs. The scheme currently provides arts housing with rental subsidy of over $3 million per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we are always sympathetic to the needs of artists and the arts community. We will work within our resources to ensure support for deserving initiatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zaqy Mohamad commented that despite all these programmes, the perception from the&nbsp;industry is that we have not created world-class talents and productions, nor generated sufficient demand for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While it is true that we have yet to witness the emergence of sustainable creative arts businesses, we should not despair. It is a long journey and we are making good progress.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can take pride in our flagship companies and artists who fly the Singapore flag on the international stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During last year&rsquo;s Singapore Season in China, the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, Singapore Chinese Orchestra,&nbsp;Singapore Dance Theatre,&nbsp;the presence and the participation of Dramabox, a theatre company, as well as showcasing&nbsp;of prominent visual and literary artists such as You Jin, Isa Kamari, Wong Keen, Goh Beng Kwan and the late Chen Wen Hsi&nbsp;&ndash; all these works and performances&nbsp;were very warmly received by the Chinese audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example I want to give about Singaporeans who have made it to the international stage&nbsp;is young musician Darrell Ang.&nbsp; Darrell received an&nbsp;NAC&rsquo;s Arts Bursary to pursue his postgraduate diploma at the St. Petersburg State Conservatory.&nbsp; Darrell went on to achieve the top prize at the prestigious 2006 Antonio Pedrotti International Competition for Conductors.&nbsp; Today, he is the co-founder and associate conductor of the St Petersburg Chamber Philharmonic.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we are also seeing more invitations to Singapore artists from overseas. &nbsp;Last year, Jason Wee, Jason Lim, Heman Chong and Matthew Quek won residency stints and competitions in Germany, China, Korea, and Italy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Musicians such as Cultural Medallion recipient Jeremy Monteiro, The Observatory and the T&rsquo;ang Quartet performed in venues and festivals in New York, Seoul and Edinburgh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, in theatre, groups such as The Theatre Practice, Theatreworks and The Finger Players staged successful performances in Australia, Japan, China, Spain and Italy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In areas where there&nbsp;is strong commercial potential, partnerships with&nbsp;private sectors such as galleries, music producers and publishers have also borne fruit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, NAC collaborated with the Composers and Authors Society of Singapore (COMPASS) to promote our music talents and products at MIDEM (the March&eacute; international de l'&eacute;dition musicale), which is the world&rsquo;s largest music trade fair, held in Cannes, France.&nbsp; Arising from this, Singapore music company Ocean Butterflies International will be collaborating with London-based Ricall, a leading online music distributor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore has also become a desirable performance and exhibition stop in Asia. Whether it is a major orchestra or a world-class museum collection&rsquo;s Asian tour, Singapore is today a sought after destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current exhibition of Greek sculptures at the National Museum is one example. &nbsp;That the Louvre is prepared to lend to our National Museum such exquisite and precious works from their collection, is a&nbsp;testament to the quality, capability and professionalism of our National Museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these are healthy signs that our arts institutions and artists are achieving some success and recognition from the international arts circle. We hope that in the years ahead&nbsp;more will achieve international acclaim.&nbsp; So at the same time when the world comes to Singapore as during the F1 this year and the Youth Olympic in 2010, we will also be&nbsp;showcasing Singapore art and artist to provide our visitors with a more&nbsp;engaging and a&nbsp;more memorable experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do these milestones mean that we have succeeded in realising our vision of Singapore as a global city for the arts? &nbsp;The answer is that while we have made significant progress, there is still&nbsp;much to do before Singapore reaches the top tier of the&nbsp;global cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our continued efforts under the Renaissance City Plan is a&nbsp;must in order to transform Singapore into a successful global city for the arts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I&nbsp;am pleased to inform this House that MICA will allocate $115 million over the next five years, or $23 million per year, to implement the next phase of the Renaissance City Plan in partnership with the private and the&nbsp;people sectors. &nbsp;This is 50% or $7 million more each year compared to the current allocation for RCP2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RCP3 will continue the work of broadening our audience base and talent pool, and internationalising our artists and arts companies.&nbsp; In addition, RCP3 will focus&nbsp;additional funding on&nbsp;three&nbsp;key areas&nbsp;&ndash; content creation, sustainable arts ecosystem and community engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will elaborate on these strategies in my response to Members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chan Soo Sen spoke about the need for&nbsp; Singapore to evolve&nbsp; works of art that will&nbsp;reflect our multicultural heritage and society. I agree with him completely. &nbsp;We must draw on our diversity of arts talents to create new and inspiring works which truly reflect our multicultural roots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year, the National Arts Council will introduce a Commissioning Fund with about&nbsp;$700,000&nbsp;to build up a body of scripts, stories, poetry, musical and dance compositions that reflect our distinctive multicultural identity as well as our Asian and contemporary context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NAC will also set aside more than $1 million each year to introduce new capability development and residency programmes for artists and arts companies to participate in exchanges with overseas arts institutions and organisations. This will enable our&nbsp;artists and our arts companies&nbsp;to gain exposure and to also establish valuable network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, NAC will continue to support artists and arts groups to draw on the deep artistic traditions of our cultural heritage by tapping on its Traditional Arts Fund which stands at about half a million dollars per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, in the area of heritage, NHB will expand collaborations with regional and international museums to research and curate exhibitions that showcase both Singapore and the wider Asia to the world.&nbsp; NHB will&nbsp;open the Peranakan Museum in April this year and this museum will&nbsp;showcase the Peranakan culture and how our Peranakan culture has established links with the regional culture of similar origins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chan Soo Sen&nbsp;suggested that the Government build up a collection of artworks&nbsp;of our pioneer artists in order to inspire future generation of artists.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, over the years, we have collected and also&nbsp;received donations of important Singapore art works, including those by our pioneer artists.&nbsp; Among the current collection of about&nbsp;7,500 art works, some 4,000 are by our&nbsp; Singapore&rsquo;s pioneer artists, including those by Chen Wen Hsi, Liu Kang, Georgette Chen, and Chen Chong Swee. The National Art Gallery, which is a project under development, will be the future home to proudly showcase these great works and many others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I should also&nbsp;add that besides showcasing our national or our pioneer artists, the National Art Gallery (NAG) will also focus on researching and presenting important art works from Southeast Asia, and hosting major exhibitions from Asia and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the NAG, I am happy to update this House that MICA&rsquo;s evaluation of the&nbsp;three winning designs selected by the International Jury is close to completion. MICA will soon appoint the successful architectural team for the project.&nbsp; However, we will time the construction to ensure that it does not aggravate the already high demand for construction works.&nbsp; We expect that the Gallery will open its doors to the public around 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, next, I will touch on the second strategy under the RCP3, which is to develop a vibrant ecosystem&nbsp;for supporting professions, enterprises and activities to ensure the sustainability of our arts and cultural sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Mr Zaqy Mohamed has highlighted, our artists and arts groups need to have viable careers and sustainable practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is possible only if we have a vibrant eco-system with many supporting industries, professionals and private intermediaries producing, presenting, distributing and marketing our artistic and cultural content, services and talents. We need this complete value chain to transform an inspiring artistic idea into an appreciated and valuable product for audiences and patrons at home and abroad.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NAC will establish an Arts Business Framework comprising start-ups and co-investment schemes targeted at commercial art galleries, artist management, festival management, arts tourism, books and music publishing, arts education services and arts consultancies.&nbsp;&nbsp; NAC will put in more than $700,000 a year for this Framework.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NAC will also expand its support for the participation of Singapore arts businesses at major regional and international markets such as MIDEM,&nbsp;which I have mentioned earlier, and the Frankfurt Book Fair and regional art fairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this juncture, I would like to respond to Mr Zaqy's comment on Malay films and co-production.&nbsp; I agree with his approach.&nbsp; MICA and MDA are already encouraging our film-makers and production houses such as Raintree Pictures to explore co-production with companies in Malaysia and Indonesia.&nbsp; We believe this is the way forward to develop and to grow our&nbsp;Malay film production sector.&nbsp; Because through such partnership and co-production, we&nbsp;can revive the Malay film industry and also&nbsp;reach out to new markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, last year, NHB piloted an assistance scheme called the Heritage Industry Incentive Programme. One example of how it works is NHB&rsquo;s assistance to U1 Tours to develop their Chinese and English guidebooks on heritage for tourist guides, tour operators, taxi drivers and hotel concierges to promote our heritage and museums to both foreign visitors and also to Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, under RCP3, NHB will set aside $2 million a&nbsp;year to expand this Heritage Industry&nbsp;Incentive Programme.&nbsp; It will provide assistance in two broad areas. First, NHB will develop capabilities and professionals for important aspects of heritage work&nbsp;&ndash; such as research, conservation and curation.&nbsp; Next, it will support the development of new cultural tourism services, resources, exhibitions and programmes to reach out to a wider market.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Baey Yam Keng called for monetary incentives for artists who had won regional or international awards as we do for sports talent. &nbsp;Miss Penny Low suggested awards to recognise the diverse achievements and the&nbsp;vibrancy of the arts scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with the spirit of both suggestions. Recognising the achievements of our artists has been an integral component of NAC&rsquo;s talent development strategy. Outstanding arts practitioners should receive recognition and respect for their work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, currently, we do so through the Cultural Medallion which is conferred by the President, and the Young Artist Award. The recipients of the Cultural Medallion and the Young Artist Award are entitled to apply for grants.&nbsp; In the case of the Cultural Medallion recipients, they can apply for&nbsp;grant of&nbsp;up to $80,000.&nbsp; For the Young Artist Award, the grant is about $10,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But these grants should not be seen as strict&nbsp;monetary rewards for their achievements. The work of an artist is a labour of love and passion&nbsp;carried out over an entire lifetime.&nbsp; Our aim is to support artists to build up sustainable artistic careers throughout their lives. The Cultural Medallion and the Young Artist Award grants are an important part of NAC&rsquo;s larger talent development framework,&nbsp;including scholarships, bursaries, and the many other arts grant schemes.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I will ask NAC to consider new ways of publicising and applauding our artists who have won international recognition or awards that are of high standing.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>1.00 pm</p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Miss Penny Low's suggestion to expand recognition for the arts, we should remember that the Government is not the only source of such recognition.&nbsp; The annual <I>Straits Times</I> Life! Theatre Award is a commendable initiative by the corporate sector to honour successful artists.&nbsp; This Award recognises not just actors and actresses but also includes directors, script writers and set designers.&nbsp; We will encourage SPH to grow the scope of this Award and also invite more private sector initiatives for similar recognition to our artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low asked for an update on the School of the Arts, or SOTA.&nbsp; Sir, I am pleased to inform the House that the School of the Arts opened in January this year at the interim site at Goodman Road with 138 Year&nbsp;1 students and 99 Year&nbsp;2 students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SOTA had received an overwhelming response from more than 1,000 students who had auditioned for places.&nbsp; The Ngee Ann Kongsi had generously donated $12 million over six years to support scholarship and bursaries for deserving students at SOTA.&nbsp; This will ensure that every deserving student can get to study at SOTA regardless of his or her family circumstances.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the construction of&nbsp;the permanent school campus at Kirk Terrace is going on.&nbsp; Despite the initial delays,&nbsp;we now expect the permanent campus to be ready by late 2009.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in response to Mr Chan Soo Sen, I would like to assure him that SOTA is indeed offering a multi-cultural arts education to our young talent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, MICA and our agencies will also continue to identify opportunities for Singapore's arts and cultural ecosystem to be plugged into international arts network.&nbsp; UNESCO is one such international network.&nbsp; Following Singapore's rejoining of UNESCO in October 2007, MICA has taken leadership of Singapore's Sub-commission on Culture and Information.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to Dr Fatimah Lateef's question, MICA will explore how UNESCO can be an additional avenue for our arts practitioners to learn from the world's best.&nbsp; Singapore will also be able to share our experiences in promoting&nbsp;our multi-cultural heritage to the world with programmes such as NHB's annual International Museum Day and our community heritage trails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this juncture, I would like to respond to Ms Irene Ng's remarks on the Complaint Choir.&nbsp; I note that Ms Irene Ng was not too exercised about the rejection of foreigners' involvement in the Complaint Choir.&nbsp; As I had explained to this House at the previous sitting, the objection in this case was on account of the nature of the performances, namely, we objected to the idea of foreigners coming here to organise and lead Singaporeans to complain about our domestic issues.&nbsp; This is something best left to Singaporeans to do.&nbsp; Although in this particular application, the lyrics themselves were not objectionable, we have to look at the application in totality.&nbsp; We did not think it was desirable or good precedent for foreigners to take such&nbsp;lead.&nbsp; They had also applied to perform at the Speakers' Corner which was clearly not permitted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, I would like to assure Ms Irene Ng and the House that MICA encourages our artists to collaborate with foreign artists and arts companies.&nbsp; Hence, we support our artists for overseas residency programme.&nbsp; We support co-productions&nbsp;in traditional art, drama, dance, musical, operas and many, many other arts events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are open to international artistic influences and recognise the benefits of working with international artists.&nbsp; The Complaint Choir was an exception to the rule and not a precedent for foreigners' participation in the arts in Singapore.&nbsp; In general, we consider such applications favourably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Dr Fatimah Lateef's question on connecting the arts to the community is addressed by the third strategy in the RCP3 which focuses on the important role of arts and culture in connecting Singaporeans, strengthening community bonding and instilling a sense of national pride.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, MICA and our agencies have initiated many new community outreach projects.&nbsp; In fact, NAC and NHB are currently allocating about $4.5 million per year for such activities.&nbsp; For example, NAC partnered the People's Association and the CDCs to stage&nbsp;six District Arts Festivals in 2006 and 2007.&nbsp; These District Arts Festivals provided enjoyment and entertainment for our heartlanders&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;our aunties and uncles in our HDB estates.&nbsp; More importantly, such Festivals help to bring people together to celebrate and&nbsp;embrace the arts as an essential part of our community life and contribute to social bonding. Going forward, we aim to bring&nbsp;about&nbsp;more&nbsp;active, community initiated events as well as deeper engagement and ownership of the arts and culture among Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, NAC will dedicate additional support of almost $1 million each year to launch Arts For All under the Community Arts Engagement Plan with CDCs to enhance arts outreach in the heartlands.&nbsp; NAC will also introduce a new Community Participation Grant to encourage more community-initiated arts projects and participation.&nbsp; It will also work with homes for the elderly, hospitals and prisons to connect these people with the arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the National Library Board will continue to reach out to needy children from low-income families and work with more schools and special needs groups through the KidsREAD and Library2010 Active Citizenry Programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our heritage is also an important aspect of community life and identity.&nbsp; Dr Ong Seh Hong asked about our efforts to preserve and promote our diverse cultural heritage.&nbsp; I would like to assure Dr Ong that NHB would do more with community groups and citizens to preserve and promote our heritage through heritage and community trails, tours and publications.&nbsp; In fact, in areas like traditional practices and&nbsp;food items, these have always featured in our annual heritage festival, attracting lots of Singaporeans to such events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, NHB's approach to enabling community involvement has been well received.&nbsp; For example, there was&nbsp;a remarkable grassroots support for the <I>Ten Stories</I>:&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Queenstown through the Years</I> project to document the transformation of Queenstown into Singapore's first highrise housing estate.&nbsp; Many residents came forward on their own to provide stories, photographs and memories of their neighbourhood which subsequently went into the book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, students from the National Junior College displayed a keen interest in heritage when they worked with NHB on the Bukit Timah Community Trail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note Dr Fatimah Lateef's request for more publicity for Geylang.&nbsp; I thought Geylang is one part of Singapore that requires the least publicity by Government.&nbsp; It is already quite well known.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I support her suggestion to look at the heritage potential of Geylang.&nbsp; One possibility is to explore how community-led heritage trail could be created to promote the district's unique cultural mix.&nbsp; In fact, one of the tours organised as part of the NHB's HeritageFest last year successfully showcased Geylang's galleries and artist studios, good food and temples.&nbsp; I think we can build on this experience and develop more of this heritage trail and focus more attention on the cultural aspects of Geylang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last but not least, the arts and heritage offer us valuable platforms to build up a sense of shared responsibility and ownership in Singapore's culture.&nbsp; Mr Chan Soo Sen spoke of encouraging more participation in supporting the arts and Mr Baey Yam Keng also spoke about encouraging private sector to donate or to contribute to public art works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support their calls and would like to inform the House that there is a growing trend of corporate and individuals coming to support the arts and culture.&nbsp; ExxonMobile supported the Concert in the Park&nbsp;series.&nbsp; HSBC funded the Youth Excellence Initiative.&nbsp; <I>Business Times</I> initiated the Budding Artists Fund.&nbsp; The Asia-Pacific Breweries Foundation launched its Signature Art Prize series and Arts Inspire Programme.&nbsp; These and many others are fine examples of the corporate sector's growing support for the arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In financial year 2006, about $37 million in sponsorship was received for the arts and culture.&nbsp; Arts collectors who have invested their time and resources to build up the collection of artworks and artefacts have also stepped forward to share their collections with the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 2004 and 2006, NHB reported the total value of $118 million in loans and donations of artefacts and artworks to the National Museums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More recently, the&nbsp;Oei Hong Leong Foundation announced its plans to build a multi-million dollar private museum to showcase rare and historical Buddhist artefacts from around the world.&nbsp; NHB is providing assistance to the Foundation in this important act of cultural philanthropy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To promote public art, NHB and NAC have introduced Public Art Tax Incentive Scheme, or PATIS, which is a double tax deduction scheme to encourage private and people sectors to donate, commission, display&nbsp;and maintain&nbsp;sculptures and other forms of public art.&nbsp; The \"Reed Sculpture\" by City Development Pte Ltd and the artworks by Ascendas (Tuas) Pte Ltd at Biopolis are two examples of artworks supported under the scheme.&nbsp;We can look forward to more public artworks at the upcoming Circle Line at the Marina Barrage.&nbsp; We will continue to look at this incentive scheme to see how we can improve and refine on it to attract even more contributors and&nbsp;donors to this public artwork scheme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, Renaissance City's Plan, with its focus on content, sustainability and community, will provide much needed boost to artists and arts companies as well as to the arts and heritage-related business sector.&nbsp; I have given a brief overview of the key programme under RCP3.&nbsp; Over the next few months, MICA, together with its agencies, will be providing more details on these new schemes and programmes as they are launched.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we will build a strong partnership with the people and the private sectors to enrich the lives of Singaporeans to foster an inclusive and resilient society, and strengthen our community bonds and rootedness.&nbsp; There is much to do to bring Singapore to the top tier of the world's global cities and we will press on.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Our e-Government was once the most advanced system in the world, but fell behind others in the last few years.&nbsp; Can the Minister provide an update of our efforts to upgrade our e-Government platform, and the recently awarded $1.3 billion SOEasy&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I suppose it is complex&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;what the system seeks to do, as well as the status of our iN2015 plan?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ICT super highway without road users would be a white elephant.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been repeatedly noted that our SMEs&nbsp;&nbsp;have not been smitten by the ICT bug.&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of knowledge, inertia, manpower and costs are reasons for the low adoption rate.&nbsp; As such, SMEs are fast losing its local market share.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can the Minister enlighten us on the&nbsp;measures to promote&nbsp;ICT to SMEs?&nbsp;&nbsp; Will there be innovative low cost utility models to help SMEs experiment with business packages that directly enhance their business profitability?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need also to move up the value creation chain of ICT business activities, instead of&nbsp;racing ourselves&nbsp;down the ICT value ladder with installation of servicing or marketing works which are easily replicable and compete mainly on price.&nbsp; We need to&nbsp;track a steady progress in year-on-year growth of any particular sector that does not measure the J-curve required in \"getting to the next level\" and \"sell\" Singapore to the next generation of value-add businesses.&nbsp; It is noteworthy that although we have some of the largest ICT companies in the world, most are just sales offices with little or no R&amp;D&nbsp;services.&nbsp; Perhaps we need to relook at our business strategy and&nbsp; distinguish high-end activities from easily replicable ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last, but most pressing, ICT is more affordable and accessible than ever before. Yet the income and technological gaps are getting wider.&nbsp; Can MICA assure Singaporeans that it will spare no effort at leveraging on ICT to help all segments of our population to level up?&nbsp; Can the Minister give us concrete examples of its effort in ensuring that the disabled, the elderly, the less advantaged and homemakers are being integrated into the ICT world, so that they too can enjoy the progress&nbsp;and become a contributing element in&nbsp;the society?&nbsp; In short, does MICA have any concrete plan or strategy to leverage on ICT to help build a resilient, self-reliant and inclusive society?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zaqy Mohamad-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>The War for Talent and Quality of Jobs Created in the ICT Sector</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Zaqy Mohamad:</B> Sir, I promise to try to give the translators an easier time this time.&nbsp; Today, the ICT sector in Singapore faces increased competition from multi-service Asian firms and low-cost talents.&nbsp; We need to up our gear to develop a high-value industry that is able to leverage on high-skilled local and global talents, because competition at the low end will hamper the development of our local workforce.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;would like to know,&nbsp;from MICA's view, after years of trying to develop the ICT sector, have we developed the sector sufficiently in the right areas and what are some of these indicators? Despite many years of IDA's efforts to develop the ICT industry, it seems that most of our ICT companies are not providing high-value add to the economy, with many in the maintenance and low-margin service segments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we benchmarked our top ICT businesses, they are nowhere near world-class icons such as Singapore Airlines, NOL or Capitaland in the other sectors.&nbsp; What are the Government's plans to create more high-value technology firms or software companies?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been generous to support our ICT companies to co-own the intellectual property for systems built for the Government sector.&nbsp; In theory, these intellectual properties produced are some of the most commercially viable, as our e-Government infrastructure is among the most advanced in the world.&nbsp; Does MICA have a point of view about&nbsp;why our local businesses have not been able to exploit this concession?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, local ICT professionals face competition from low-end&nbsp;to high-end jobs.&nbsp; As industries develop and rely on IT, more skilled ICT professionals are needed than the current 140,000 and we need to ensure that top talents stay here.&nbsp; How does MICA rate our success today, in terms of R&amp;D and performance in the ICT sector, in order to attract investments and world-class talents?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of talent, there is certainly a lot of feedback from the ICT industry that the quality of local talents is declining.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Second Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</B> Sir, I thank&nbsp;Miss Penny Low and Mr Zaqy Mohamad for some very relevant and apt comments and advice.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first start by saying that the infocomm sector has seen good growth.&nbsp; For 2007, our preliminary estimates indicate growth of between 6% and 8% in value-add was achieved and, in terms of total revenues, we saw growth of between&nbsp;7% and 10%.&nbsp; These are reasonable indices of progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me update the House on the status of the&nbsp;iN2015 master plan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infrastructure-wise, we have completed the roll-out of the <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=mailto:Wireless@SG\"\">Wireless@SG</a> programme.&nbsp; Members will remember that this is&nbsp;a pervasive public wireless network consisting of 6,900 hotspots distributed island-wide in public areas.&nbsp; As far as the&nbsp;Next Generation National Broadband Network project is concerned, the Request for Proposal (RFP)&nbsp;is underway and we target to award the first RFP by the third quarter of this year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various&nbsp;cluster development programmes under the master plan include things such as <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=mailto:FutureSchools@Singapore\"\">FutureSchools@Singapore</a>, iGov2010, TradeXchange and Integrated Clinic Management System.&nbsp; All these cluster development programmes are underway and making good progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, on the e-Government programme, we are achieving a greater integration of Government e-services under the iGov2010 plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will also remember that last week we announced 150 Government services will be available online through the&nbsp;mobile phone.&nbsp; The main Government website&nbsp; <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=http://www.gov.sg\"\"><I>www.gov.sg</I></a> &nbsp;will be transformed in order to meet the increasingly sophisticated demands of our people.&nbsp; So you will see improvements in this package of services and products at the interface between Government and people.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Miss Penny Low and Mr Zaqy Mohamad that for our local infocomm industry to flourish, the key ingredient is talent.&nbsp;&nbsp;The IDA&rsquo;s 2007 Annual Infocomm Manpower Survey showed that the infocomm manpower pool grew by 8.9% between 2006 and 2007.&nbsp; We now have approximately&nbsp;130,400 people in this sector.&nbsp; More than 80% of these people are&nbsp;tertiary-educated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we really need to develop a full complement of infocomm manpower that stretches the entire spectrum from&nbsp;maintenance all the way to high-end cutting-edge research and development.&nbsp; To achieve this, the key is&nbsp;to attract and retain top talent in this sector and to make sure that this talent continues to have&nbsp;up-to-date and relevant&nbsp;skills, because this is such a quickly progressing sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IDA will be increasing the pool of scholars in this sector through the National Infocomm Scholarships Programme.&nbsp; These scholarships are offered in partnership with companies from the private sector, and these include companies in diverse range of sectors, including banking, finance, telecoms, media, etc.&nbsp; Scholars of the National Infocomm Scholarship Programme are assured of a wide selection of exciting&nbsp;job prospects when they graduate.&nbsp; Since the launch of this programme in 2004, we&nbsp;have attracted a total of 107 top students.&nbsp; In the next few years, we will increase the number of scholarships available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IDA is also working with&nbsp;local universities as well as&nbsp;companies to&nbsp;roll out the Enhanced Learning in Infocomm Technology Programme.&nbsp; This is a programme which targets&nbsp;the top 20% of students in NUS, NTU and SMU.&nbsp; They will have an opportunity to be&nbsp;mentored by key industry leaders, they will&nbsp;be exposed to project work as well as&nbsp;internships, both locally and overseas,&nbsp;and they will also receive training in new technology areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to make sure that top talent is excited, stimulated and sees that there are real prospects for interesting challenges in the years ahead.&nbsp; And that addresses the Member's point about keeping top talent within this sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Infocomm Competency Framework (NICF) was initiated last year. &nbsp;This is a framework&nbsp;which will&nbsp;help professionals upgrade and equip themselves with relevant skill sets which we anticipate&nbsp;will be in high demand in the future.&nbsp; A new NICF portal will be launched by the end of this month.&nbsp; The portal will enable users to assess manpower capability gaps, develop career development plans, as well as to&nbsp;identify relevant training programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complementing this framework is the Techno-Strategist Programme, which aims to&nbsp;equip some 1,000 middle-tier infocomm professionals with deeper domain knowledge specifically in the following three sectors:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Finance; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Banking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did we choose these three sectors?&nbsp; Because we believe these are sectors with significant growth prospects in the years ahead.&nbsp; Obviously, as we identify other sectors, we will also expand this programme accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next five years, IDA&nbsp;will be investing a further $70 million into these infocomm manpower development programmes.&nbsp;&nbsp;So the resources are available.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides addressing&nbsp;talent, IDA and MDA will work&nbsp;with other Government agencies, including the EDB, to continue to attract high-value ICT activities and research and development to Singapore.&nbsp; We will also be increasing our assistance to local start-ups so that they will be able to both&nbsp;create and market their IP both locally and internationally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low also asked how we are helping SMEs adopt infocomm technology.&nbsp; Let me just highlight three&nbsp;programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the SME Infocomm Resource <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=mailto:Centre@Singapore\"\">Centre@Singapore</a> Polytechnic.&nbsp; This provides SMEs&nbsp;with consultancy services at very low rates.&nbsp; I understand that the lowest charge is $5 for consultancy service.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second&nbsp;example is&nbsp;the SME Domain-Name Reservation service.&nbsp; When a local company registers its name with ACRA, it is also given an option for free reservation of its domain name.&nbsp; It has three months to decide.&nbsp; If it wishes to, register that domain name and, if it wishes to, we offer it at a subsidised rate initially.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third example is the SME Infocomm Package which, by May this year, will offer infocomm service and support packages from a list of pre-qualified suppliers.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a scheme which will enable SMEs to reap cost savings&nbsp;or, as Miss Penny Low referred to, as almost a utility model when they invest in basic infocomm equipment and services.&nbsp; To add a further sweetener, the&nbsp;IDA will also co-fund the first 5,000 SMEs which take&nbsp;advantage of these&nbsp;packages.&nbsp; So, again, the point is, resources are available, we can bring the horse to the water, but we cannot force it to drink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low was also quite rightly concerned about a potential digital divide.&nbsp; The good news is that we are aware of this and we do not intend to let a digital divide exist in Singapore.&nbsp; In the next five years, we will invest $43 million into these efforts.&nbsp; Let me give you a few examples.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IDA will accelerate its enhanced NEU-PC Plus programme.&nbsp; This is a programme&nbsp;which was&nbsp;launched in 2006 which&nbsp;provides highly-subsidised personal computers and Internet access to low-income families.&nbsp; If I may add, it is broadband Internet access for these low-income families.&nbsp; To date, some&nbsp;4,200 families have already taken advantage of this&nbsp;programme.&nbsp; In total, we are aiming for 38,000 families&nbsp;to benefit from this programme by 2015.&nbsp; Last year,&nbsp;the IDA also set up the iNSPIRE Fund which will&nbsp;allow needy students to perform community service in lieu of co-payment.&nbsp; So, in theory, some families can get this for a princely sum of $0.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I launched the&nbsp;first Silver Infocomm Junction last year in&nbsp;November.&nbsp; This is a centre targeted at&nbsp;senior citizens so that they will get&nbsp;exposure and access&nbsp;to personal computers and the Internet.&nbsp; The IDA will be setting up another seven centres in the heartlands by 2010.&nbsp; IDA will also&nbsp;work with MCYS and the Society for the Physically Disabled to launch the Infocomm Accessibility Centre in the middle of this year, and this will&nbsp;provide infocomm skills training to the disabled so that they can&nbsp;enhance their employability and stay connected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure that there is convenient online access to Government services, there are also 28 CitizenConnect Centres around Singapore with trained officers on hand to render assistance to those who currently do not have&nbsp;computer access or need someone to hold their hand as they click on the mouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, we announced the results of the tender for the Government Standard Operating Environment.&nbsp; This is a $1.3 billion project over eight years and we estimate that it will save the Government around $500 million over the next eight years.&nbsp; These savings are&nbsp;derived principally from economies of scale,&nbsp;standardisation, the ease of deployment and the ease of maintenance that results from the standardised operating environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I take the point that we are also aware of risks.&nbsp; We are outsourcing such a large chunk of Government IT infrastructure to the private sector.&nbsp; We have taken adequate precautions.&nbsp; For example, we will ensure that for every essential component of this project, there are at least two suppliers within that consortium who can provide the essential component.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operationally, we also intend to make sure that at least 30% of the people involved with this project are civil servants or people within our statutory boards.&nbsp; They will be integrated, embedded into the manpower manning this project so that we are never held hostage to any company or consortia or sub-consortia within this project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also have internal audit teams to maintain security and resiliency of the system.&nbsp; It also gives us an opportunity therefore to upskill and retask our existing IT manpower into&nbsp;higher-value and more significant jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, all in all, our infocomm sector is doing well and growing.&nbsp; We are making resources available.&nbsp; There are great opportunities.&nbsp; Both in the private sector and in the Government sector, there are greater efficiencies and, we will also make sure, no digital divides emerge.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

(4)&nbsp; Last but not least, the ability to identify industry needs and matching them is a critical linking pin in the creative industry.&nbsp; Currently, while our designer and creative sector tend to work in silos, the product and service engineering sectors are also not leveraging on design to move up the value chain.&nbsp; Perhaps, the right and left brains do not share the same language or focus.&nbsp; But we all know a whole-of-brain approach will create the highest value and most enjoyable product.&nbsp; The story of MP3 players vs Apple ipods is a case in point.&nbsp; Lack of a Steve Job, I am wondering if MICA has set up any specific agency whose function is purely to scout for industry needs to be matched with suitable designers, and vice versa, to ensure greater value creation per product and service?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

One of the ways is to expose the public to good design. The most effective way is to have good design in our public areas.&nbsp; As the largest investor in public amenities, the Government can make the greatest impact on&nbsp;public design quotient.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While MICA promotes enterprises to leverage on design as a competitive edge, does the Ministry also advocate that basic aesthetical standards are met during the Government procurement processes and how so?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides functionality and ease of use, aesthetics should also be considered. For example, public amenities, such as our taxi stands, post boxes, litter bins, ERP gantries and even the humble tables and benches in the HDB void deck, can literally be works of art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good design does not necessarily mean higher costs or come at the expense of usability.&nbsp; Sometimes, it is just a matter of choice with an eye for aesthetics. For example, the facade of the old Hill Street police station, now the MICA Building, was immediately transformed with the choice of rainbow colours for its many windows.&nbsp; Another good design I have noticed are the street lamps along Esplanade Bridge.&nbsp; I would like to encourage people to pay special attention and enjoy the beauty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore becomes more international with big events and&nbsp;we welcome more tourists to Singapore, good designs will also showcase our urban landscape.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Media</em>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Miss Penny Low:</B> Sir, the existence of a strong innovative and diversified media content can drive creativity and adoption of ICT in schools, at work, at home and at play.&nbsp;&nbsp;With Wireless@SG, the promise of being connected \"anytime, anywhere\" is fast becoming&nbsp;a reality.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, while e-Government content is strong, the rest are not.&nbsp; Locally produced content, e-learning, e-entertainment and, in particular, e-retail and e-businesses, lag far behind that of&nbsp;our US or even Korea&nbsp;and Japan counterparts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, our youths are turning to foreign sites to get information and shape their mindset. My niece, Nowell Quah, for example, is&nbsp;a \"spree organiser\". That is a term used by e-networks&nbsp;to represent a product aggregator who does it not for profit.&nbsp; In short, she surfs the web for products which are of interest to her, sets up a post with product link, invites surfers to place orders through the web link, while she merely aggregates the demand to place a bulk purchase order which results in lower freight cost and product cost.&nbsp; She has been doing so for a couple of years and, in fact, does most of her shopping this way. The local retailers are losing out on her business. She is a seasoned spree organiser at only 17 years old.&nbsp; What will happen to our local retail businesses?&nbsp; Will our expensive ICT infrastructure, void of local content, become exploited by foreign content and under-utilised to grow our economic pie?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can MICA provide an update on the achievements of its Media21 blueprint and its efforts to develop the media sector?&nbsp; Also, which aspects of media industry has MICA focused its efforts on, ie, is it content distribution, media services, such as digital IP management, etc?&nbsp; Has there been a significant growth in creation and sales of local media content? Do we have the right quantity and quality of manpower to grow? What are our strengths and where are the employment opportunities?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, can MICA also provide an update on the progress of its Interactive Digital Media (IDM) initiatives?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Dr Fatimah, take your two cuts together. 1.5 minutes. \r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>National Book Development Council and Literary Arts</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Fatimah Lateef:</B> The literary arts appear to have less visibility compared to some other areas of the arts.&nbsp; The National Book Development Council of Singapore has received grants under the MICA budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has utilised part of its funds to set up the Singapore Writers Centre and publish the resource kit for writers.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to enquire what are the opportunities and options this can offer to the budding writers in Singapore.&nbsp; How many publications do we get annually?

Unfortunately, this is lower than the Singapore average of $86,000 in that same year. So this shows that there is still much progress that needs to be achieved in this sector, as far as the creative capacity and the value-add of each worker is concerned.&nbsp; But having said that, the employment in the creative industries now amounts to slightly in excess of 100,000. That is 4.4% of total employment in Singapore. So, that is not an insignificant sector that we need to pay attention to.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me move on to the issue of design which several Members have referred to.&nbsp; The Design Competitiveness Report, which is based on data supplied by the World Economic Forum, showed that Singapore has improved from No. 22 in the year 2002 to No. 16 in 2005&nbsp;&ndash; not yet in the top 10, but we are making progress.&nbsp; Singapore designers are also winning more international awards. For example, the NUS Industrial Design graduate, Mr Donn Koh, became the first Singaporean, indeed the first designer trained in Asia to win one of the world's most coveted design prizes&nbsp;&ndash; the International Braun Prize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Baey Yam Keng asked how the Government promotes good design in public amenities.&nbsp; I totally agree with him. I think we do need to pay attention to this element because, after all, that is what we see every day.&nbsp; I was just sharing a private joke with the Minister for Transport and I think he agrees with the Member that if we can make ERP gantries even more impactful from a design perspective, maybe people will be less angry with the Ministry. That may be wishful thinking.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will give you another example. DesignSingapore has launched a nationwide programme called the \"10TouchPoints\" in which we were looking for public suggestions on how to redesign public amenities. I did not check whether any&nbsp;suggestions came in for ERP gantries but there were many other suggestions, including recycling bins, bus-stops and other examples.&nbsp; In fact, I believe the winning design was a creative redesign for recycling bins and you will soon see&nbsp;these at our Changi Airport.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low asked a relevant question. She asked: have we set up any agencies specifically to match companies with designers?&nbsp; DesignSingapore's&nbsp;initial focus was, first, to assemble a critical mass of talent in the design sector.&nbsp; And we sought to do that by&nbsp;developing both Singaporean designers as well as leading international designers.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was done through the DesignSingapore studio series&nbsp;which so far has seen Singapore designers working with international designers, such as&nbsp;Toshiyuki Kita,&nbsp;and exhibiting their products and networks at the Milan Fair.&nbsp; But I totally agree with the Member that our next step must be to encourage Singapore companies to integrate design into their products and to therefore work with our designers in order to create more compelling products. I think the example which she cited of MP3 players is the most apt example. Therefore, building both design capacity and embedding that design ability into our major industries will be our key priority as we move into the new DesignSingapore 2.0 blueprint, details of which we will release later this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low also asked for an update on our media development efforts.&nbsp; MDA has spent time and resources in developing capabilities, grooming enterprises and cultivating demand. For example, last year, more than 5,000 media professionals and students received MDA-supported training in order to upgrade their skills. We will continue to attract experienced international media talents to Singapore as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also tell this House that Singapore companies are actually quite successfully co-producing TV programmes, animations and feature films with leading overseas partners.&nbsp; In fact, some 100 local media companies have participated in six key trade events, such as MIPTV, MIPCOM and the Cannes Film market last year, and they secured an estimated US$600 million in deals&nbsp;&ndash; not a bad start.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of interactive and digital media, we are also attracting both international and local companies to engage in media R&amp;D. As Members have pointed out, we need to go beyond just&nbsp;marketing, sales and distribution, but move up the value chain.&nbsp; And R&amp;D represents the cutting edge of that value chain.&nbsp; In 2007, under a multi-agency initiative, 23 IDM R&amp;D projects with an estimated business spending of $126 million were awarded.&nbsp; But these are long-term projects. It will take time for us to see whether they bear fruit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Low has also rightly pointed out that Singapore is a newcomer to this field and that there is a lot more that needs to be done. Details of our Singapore MediaFusion 2015 blueprint will be released later this year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Fatimah Lateef's question about the National Book Development Council (NBDC) and nurturing writers in Singapore is very timely.&nbsp; Under the Singapore Writers Centre initiative, the NBDC organises year-round activities, including courses, workshops featuring international writers, networking opportunities and the supporting resources. All these, together with festivals, such as the Singapore Writers Festival, have helped to boost the number of local titles published in Singapore by 6% in 2006 and that represents a total of more than 23,300 publications.&nbsp; I do not have the language breakdown. I will get my staff to give&nbsp;the Member&nbsp;that later on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to end by re-emphasising the point that this is still all about talent.&nbsp; Just last month, I visited Google.&nbsp; I found 26 Singaporeans working for Google &ndash; engineers&nbsp;&ndash; and they said,&nbsp;\"We have joined this company where engineers are number one\", and they think they are going to change the world by working in that company.&nbsp; And we need to do the same in Singapore&nbsp;&ndash; to give our top talent opportunities to change the world by fully utilising their potential and&nbsp;talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And the other point about this space in IDM and media is that it is such a quickly-changing field. The opportunities change from year to year. And the real opportunities lie at the interface of arts, business and technology.&nbsp; So it is no longer about right brain or left brain. It is no longer about artists and engineers. But our students need to have the capacity to transact and look for value and opportunities at these interstices.

Old media, like free-to-air TV, attract more stringent safeguards to ensure programmes do not stray from accepted community norms given its broad reach into almost all homes.&nbsp; MDA's free-to-air TV programme code manifests concern with safeguarding community morality.&nbsp; Social resilience and democracy depends on this.&nbsp; With globalisation, correct common norms of decency are needed to ensure we remain discerning and not blindly embrace libertine values in the name of being cosmopolitan.&nbsp; How are breaches of TV programme codes handled?&nbsp; How does this differ from the light-touch approach to regulating new media?&nbsp; Does MDA actively monitor the content of TV programmes or merely react to third party complaints?&nbsp; Are there well-known formal avenues for citizens to raise concerns?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last month, the <I>Straits Times</I> published an online letter by Mr Benny Cheok who expressed concern about a Channel 5 TV show screened at 8.00 am on Sunday and said, \"depicted a gay married couple with their young adopted son as a family nucleus.\"&nbsp; This screening breaches the code's guideline on public morals and social values.&nbsp; It undermines the family's importance as a basic social unit, signalling that same sex parenting is acceptable.&nbsp; This contradicts our family values and conception of family where a man and woman marrying and having children is normative.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the code requires that themes concerning lifestyles like homosexuality be cautiously treated and not glamourised or endorsed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The show was screened during prime viewing&nbsp;time, breaching guidelines on family viewing.&nbsp; Mr Cheok noted that young viewers would be left eroded by the absence of the opposite gender in the family nucleus.&nbsp; What steps has MDA taken to investigate and remedy Mr Cheok's complaint?&nbsp; Could the Minister elaborate on how to prevent similar future breaches and how to ensure industry players make greater use of consumer advice in airing sensitive content?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Baey Yam Keng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In fact, dialect is not just the language for scolding or abusing each other; in fact, it is also an art, a culture, a heritage.&nbsp;&nbsp;\"881\" has represented Singapore in the Oscars award for Best Foreign Language Film, but it cannot be aired over our Channel 8 or Channel U.&nbsp; And even the popular Hokkien song, \"Half for you, half for me\" cannot be heard over our radio.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2003, the Programme Advisory Committee recommended for the restriction on dialect programmes on our mass media to be relaxed but MICA turned down the recommendation saying that it would affect the usage of Mandarin.&nbsp; In fact, in 2005, less than 3% of our Chinese population aged between five and 20 cited dialect as the most frequently used language at home.&nbsp; And even for those aged between 20-30, the figure was less than 14%.&nbsp; Honestly speaking, dialects cannot be resurrected as it was before in Singapore.&nbsp; It has very little impact on our learning of Mandarin.&nbsp; So, should we kill dialects and eradicate them?&nbsp; I think we should give them some breathing space.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of my elderly residents in Queenstown do not know Mandarin.&nbsp; Fortunately, I can speak Hokkien, Teochew and Cantonese.&nbsp; So, I can communicate with our older residents.&nbsp; Many of them cannot understand Government schemes, especially those designed to help them.&nbsp; They cannot understand because it was not explained to them in their own dialects or languages.&nbsp; Currently, we only allow short news bulletins in dialects on 95.8FM and Chinese opera programmes on TV.&nbsp; If we allow some informative or even entertainment programmes to use dialects, our senior citizens could have a better understanding of what is happening in Singapore.&nbsp; Now that our people are ageing and many of them are living longer, I think we should also provide for their enjoyment besides financial adequacy.&nbsp; With today&rsquo;s technology, we could even broadcast Hong Kong drama serials in dual sound.&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Speak Mandarin Campaign was launched in 1979, the slogan was &ldquo;Speak More Mandarin, Use Less Dialects&rdquo; but with the changing environment, the slogan is now &ldquo;Mandarin Cool&rdquo;.&nbsp;

Yet, much, if not most, of that is unavailable, even to researchers for research purposes.&nbsp; The Government controls how much data to release, and how and when.&nbsp; Available data is sometimes presented differently at different times, making comparison difficult.&nbsp; Even MPs, it seems, are not able to obtain certain data.&nbsp; I know because I have asked for citizenship and PR figures in Parliament, but I have been told by MHA that it is \"unable to provide this specific data requested.\"&nbsp; No reasons were cited.&nbsp; And it seems parliamentary convention permits this.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, we simply do not record some types of data.&nbsp; Most notably, when MOM tracks resident employment data, it does not differentiate between citizens and resident foreigners.&nbsp; I think most Singaporeans would consider that essential information if only to better understand how their country is changing.&nbsp; This Government fiercely prides itself on its transparency and accountability.&nbsp; I therefore ask the Government to be more proactive in collecting and publishing official statistics.&nbsp; Any official data that does not invoke national security or similar concerns should be made available.&nbsp; Indeed, I urge the Government to enact a Freedom of Information Act to set the rules under which Government information is made available to the public as of right.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1946, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution describing freedom of information as a fundamental human right.&nbsp; Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which forms part of customary international law, explicitly provides for the right to seek and receive information.&nbsp; The right to information is therefore a fundamental human right.&nbsp; It is timely for Singapore to have its own Freedom of Information Act.&nbsp; Such legislation promotes transparency and accountability.&nbsp; It allows citizens to understand their governments better.&nbsp; It facilitates independent research.&nbsp; It enriches the history of the nation.&nbsp; Today, over 70 countries around the world&nbsp; have such legislation.&nbsp; Even China, a Communist state, is implementing a statute on access to government information.&nbsp; It will come into force on 1st&nbsp;May 2008.&nbsp; It is time for Singapore, as a developed country, to take its rightful place within that group of countries.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

On average, MDA receives&nbsp;one to two such feedback each month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for matters relating to libel and personal defamation, these lay outside the scope of MDA class licence.&nbsp; However, existing laws that protect an individual's rights still apply.&nbsp; So these issues are best dealt with the existing legal and civil channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While everyone is free to express their views on their personal blogs, they should be mindful that they are still subjected to the laws of the land, such as the Penal Code and the Religious Harmony Act.&nbsp; Singapore's key vulnerabilities -&nbsp;the four&nbsp;kinds of race and religion remain and, in fact, are even more exposed to foreign influences in the form of religious extremism and terrorism reaching us through the new media.&nbsp; Hence, any individual in Singapore who uses websites for religious purposes has to register with MDA.&nbsp; This promotes accountability and also ensures personal responsibility for comments made on the Internet.&nbsp; We have had cases in the previous years&nbsp;where the law was breached, such as when racist bloggers blogged incendiary racist remarks, and we have not hesitated to prosecute them in court.&nbsp; Our controls have enabled the maintenance of our racial harmony in the face of sensitive material, such as the Danish cartoons.&nbsp; We will continue to be vigilant and to manage the risks brought about by new media, so as to ensure racial harmony amongst our people.&nbsp; However, with regard to the rest of the content in the Internet, we will continue to have a light-touch approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the traditional media where we have adopted a differentiated approach based on reach and impact.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Free-to-air TV, for example, has more stringent guidelines as it is a mainstream media that has wider reach and impact on the general public. By comparison, subscription TV, including cable and IPTV services, is given more leeway because its accessibility is restricted by subscription.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the enforcement of TV programme codes, I want to assure the House that television, especially&nbsp;free-to air channels, will uphold certain norms and standards consistent with traditional family values. I would like to address Prof. Thio Li-ann&rsquo;s query on the steps taken to deal with channels that air programmes contrary to these values. Our current system is based largely on self-regulation by the broadcasters who are to comply with a set of programme codes. Hence, programmes are not pre-censored. If there is a complaint, an investigation is launched which includes consultations with the MDA's broadcast advisory committees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the <I>Straits Times'</I> Forum page letter regarding a TV show, which Prof. Thio mentioned, which apparently showed a supposedly married gay couple who supposedly had an adopted child, we need to take a balanced view. The TV programme was a programme about home decoration and design. It featured a game room being converted into a nursery. There was no objection to the skills and talent of the designers or to the general entertainment value of the programme. The objection raised does not relate to the main features of the programme but to an incidental feature found in this one episode. The concern was that in&nbsp;the programme the people who were going to live in the redesigned home were two men and a child, not the usual man, woman and child.&nbsp; The viewer&nbsp;can extrapolate what the relationship of the two men may be and then from the extrapolation conclude&nbsp;that family values are not being upheld. As there is a complaint about the programme, MDA is investigating the matter in its usual manner. It will consult the Programme Advisory Committee for English programmes, or PACE, before making a decision if any guideline was breached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In regulating the media, MICA adopts a flexible approach wherever possible. Take, for instance, our dialect policy. We do not ban the use of dialects on&nbsp;broadcast media outright. Where practical, we allow some dialect programming to serve the needs of&nbsp;older Singaporeans and the arts community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to Mr Baey Yam Keng&rsquo;s request for MICA to permit airing dialect content on TV and radio, I would like to point out that some dialect programmes are already available on radio, free-to-air TV and cable TV. For instance, on free-to-air TV, Channel 8 broadcasts dialect operas and Arts Central enjoys leeway to show arthouse movies with some dialect, if the films have artistic merit. On radio, FM 95.8 broadcasts dialect news daily. For more dialect programmes, viewers can choose from subscription TV services, including those offered by SCV and SingTel. In addition, dialect movies and dramas are readily available on DVDs, VCDs and videotapes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Speak Mandarin Campaign was first launched, only 13% of Chinese Singaporeans could speak Mandarin.&nbsp; Today, with the bilingual policy of schools and continued promotion by the Promote Mandarin Council, half of Chinese Singaporeans can speak Mandarin easily.&nbsp; This puts Singaporeans in an advantageous position to benefit from the rapid growth of China.&nbsp; As reported by <I>My Paper</I>, Singaporean managers are highly sought after in China and Hong Kong and one reason is our ability to speak English and Mandarin.&nbsp; An excellent example is Mr Harry Tan who upgraded \"Days Inn\", a motel chain originating from the US, to a 5-star \"Days Hotel and Suites\" chain in many provinces in China.&nbsp; He strongly believes that only Singaporeans can do this because of our bilingual policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That we have&nbsp;achieved some success after almost&nbsp;30 years of Speak Mandarin Campaign is not an outcome that is not irreversible.&nbsp; We should not inadvertently reverse this progress, the progress that we have made through an uncontrolled liberalisation of our dialect policy.&nbsp; So, Sir, while dialect is not frozen, while it may be cool, we still want Mandarin to be cooler.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from content regulation, MICA also seeks to foster social cohesion and bonding.&nbsp; This is achieved through Public Service Broadcast (PSB)&nbsp;programmes, which play a critical role in communicating national and social messages.&nbsp; Such PSB programmes are funded by Radio and TV licence fees.&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin had requested for the abolition of RTV licence fees and for Government to fund PSB programmes instead.&nbsp; This question has been raised twice in this House before.&nbsp; The collection of RTV licence fees is not unique to Singapore.&nbsp; If these fees are abolished, taxes will have to be increased to fund these PSB programmes.&nbsp; We should view the payment of RTV fees as a partnership between the Government, broadcasters and&nbsp;people for the public good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The funded PSB programmes cover genres like minority language programmes, culture, information, current affairs, quality drama, local sports and children's programmes, many of which are not commercially viable otherwise. These programmes inform and educate the general public about important social, community and economic issues and policies. They also serve our national interests by strengthening our identity and culture, and promoting social cohesion and racial harmony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, I would like to touch on the Indian language free-to-air channel&nbsp;&ndash; Vasantham.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, I shall proceed in Tamil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>(In</I> <I>Tamil)</I>:&nbsp;[For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20080229/20080229VS_122351.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a>*.] Sir, <I>Vasantham</I>, the Indian TV service station, plays an important part in the life of Singapore Indian community. Today, Vasantham has only about 29 hours of programmes a week. The Vasantham programmes are telecast between Kids Central and Arts Central, both of which are in the English language. We have received much feedback from the Indian community asking for the improvement of Vasantham programmes. We have therefore decided to make Vasantham a separate or a stand-alone channel for Tamil and other Indian programmes. In other words, Sir, it would be like Suria programmes. The number of hours of programmes will increase from 29 hours&nbsp; to 65 hours a week. Indians in Singapore therefore can look forward to a much more improved Vasantham channel.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>(In English)</I>:&nbsp; Let me now turn to Mr Siew Kum Hong&rsquo;s concern about freedom of information, which was a subject of discussion in this House at least twice before. Sir, Singapore is plugged into the globalised world and thrives on a free flow of information. The Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) in its Asian Intelligence Report&rsquo;s assessment of economic statistics noted that for Singapore, \"a wide range of topics are quickly compiled and made available to researchers on a regular basis\". The range, coverage and availability of our economic and social statistics compare very favourably to those compiled and disseminated by&nbsp;more statistically developed countries, for example, US, UK, Australia and Hong Kong. The IMF, in its annual Article IV consultations, has also consistently assessed Singapore&rsquo;s economic statistics to be timely, credible and reliable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Siew also asked about the availability of information such as employment data differentiating between citizens and non-citizens. In line with national statistical practice, MOM regularly publishes employment figures by residents (Singapore citizens and PRs) and non-residents (foreigners). MOM has also released two&nbsp;papers today retrievable on their website&nbsp;&ndash; the first on the employment of Singapore citizens, PRs and foreigners, a subject that Mr Siew showed interest in, and the second on the quality of employment creation for Singapore citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the Department of Statistics&nbsp;publishes regular demographic statistics according to this breakdown, in addition to other economic and social statistics. In fact, all Government agencies regularly provide updated information on matters of public interest, such as health, education, and finance through the media, publicity campaigns as well as the Internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Archives of Singapore is also a rich repository of historical data that is invaluable to researchers. As stipulated by the National Heritage Board Act 1993, most archived public records are made available for public consultation after a 25-year period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lack of legislation on Freedom of Information has not prevented Singapore from doing well in international studies of transparency. In 2007, Transparency International ranked Singapore fourth in an international survey, above the United States, which does have a Freedom of Information Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That Singapore is a financial, information and economic hub, and that the people&rsquo;s trust in our Government remains high, is proof that the system we have today is working well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I fully agree with Miss Penny Low that a country&rsquo;s brand or reputation has emerged as an important competitive factor. A national branding strategy is therefore important. MICA is committed to improving the overall brand equity of Singapore through coordination among agencies when marketing Singapore. MICA, together with MTI, co-chairs the National Marketing Action Committee, or NMAC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NMAC&rsquo;s main purpose is to develop a whole-of-government effort to market and promote Singapore internationally for a more consistent Singapore brand. As Singapore continues to evolve, so will our brand, and our marketing efforts must reflect this progression. This does not mean that tomorrow, you are going to see a single logo or tagline proclaiming to the world what the \"new\" Singapore is about. Instead, it is more about coordinating our messaging, as Government agencies, so that we speak a common language about what Singapore stands for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Branding only seeks to emphasise the reality. Therefore, the reality of what Singapore is, will be what ultimately brands Singapore. With the numerous international events coming to our sunny shores, such as the Youth Olympic Games and the F1 races, there are opportunities for us to showcase and brand Singapore. I have no doubt&nbsp;we would organise and host these events efficiently as we are well-known for efficiency. But we also need to showcase our \"softer\" aspects&nbsp;&ndash; graciousness, civic consciousness and politeness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will depend on each and every Singaporean&nbsp;&ndash; how we present ourselves to the world. We are the brand ambassadors of Singapore and, through our actions, we will provide the reality of what Brand Singapore&nbsp;is&nbsp;&ndash; a gracious society living in a vibrant global city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, MICA will continue its efforts to make Singapore a vibrant global city, giving greater choice to all who live and work here.</p>\r\n</span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> The Government&nbsp;actually has a very generous IP regime.&nbsp; For private sector companies, including our local companies who work on Government ICT projects, after the completion of the project, we let&nbsp;them own the IP and the hope is that they will then commercialise it and use the fact that this IP was utilised in the Government successfully as part of their branding and part of their marketing.&nbsp; I think&nbsp;he is&nbsp;right that so far progress on the utilisation of this IP has not been as good as we would hope for it to be.&nbsp; But there is a limit again to what the Government can do.&nbsp; We have made the first step.&nbsp; We let them own the IP.&nbsp; We will help market it.&nbsp; But I think we also have to be realistic.&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know about the world being flat.&nbsp; The infocomm sector is the flatest sector in the world.&nbsp; Any product which you intend to market is immediately available worldwide but it is also exposed to competition worldwide.&nbsp; So this is not a sector where a Government subsidy will suddenly make you competitive.&nbsp; You have got to go out there quickly and show the world that this idea works.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the fact that we now have an SOE is also another great opportunity for our companies, because this is one of the largest outsourcing projects for the front end, the desktop, the messaging and the networking behind Government infrastructure.&nbsp; I hope that our companies will capitalise on this project to also gain greater market share overseas.&nbsp; And if this project is successful, and&nbsp;I expect it to be successful, I think there will be other governments and other large organisations in the world that will also embark on this course that the Singapore Government has set.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

There are, of course, occasions where we do seek&nbsp;Singapore artists and arts companies to contribute to the national causes.&nbsp; For instance,&nbsp;when we went international for Singapore Season in China.&nbsp; Many of the artists who participated, including the chefs who took part in the two Singapore evening dinners, volunteered their services and they were quite proud to be part of this effort to promote and&nbsp;market Singapore's capability in the culinary art.&nbsp; In many other instances where we actually commission works by Singapore artists, we pay for those commission works.&nbsp; And, in fact, I said earlier on in my reply, that this year, under RCP3, the National Arts Council will set aside $700,000 to start up a commissioning fund which will be used to commission works by Singapore artists which will be performed&nbsp;in Singapore in the first instance.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we do pay our artists for their&nbsp;work&nbsp;to help to make Singapore a more vibrant arts city.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I attended the private performance of the Complaints Choir and my understanding is that the project was organised by a local arts group, The Necessary Stage, not by foreigners,&nbsp;and The Necessary Stage invited the founders here.&nbsp;

We objected to the idea of foreigners coming here to lead the Choir, to encourage them or to support them in voicing out their complaints.&nbsp; As I said, and I repeat here again, that this complaining about issues and matters that irritate Singaporeans is something that Singaporeans are more than capable of doing on their own without having to have foreigners come to lead the performance.&nbsp; So the question is whether in fact we should set a precedent where foreigners can come in and organise Singaporeans in this manner.&nbsp; We did not think it was desirable.&nbsp; Yes, the performance was under the ambit of the M1 Festival, and the principal organiser was The Necessary Stage.&nbsp; But in this particular instance, we understood it as an event that would be led or directed by the two foreigners.&nbsp; So we had decided that the public performance by these two foreigners should not take place, since they involved foreigners working together with Singaporeans on this project.&nbsp; But as I had also said in my earlier response, it does not set a precedent.&nbsp; It does not mean that we have an objection to foreigners working with our artists in Singapore to put up arts performances.&nbsp; In fact, we constantly encourage such interaction.&nbsp; We welcome international artists and performers to participate in Singapore on their own or working in collaboration with Singapore artists and arts companies, and we will continue to do so.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

May I ask the Minister how many of these 26 Singaporeans are indeed working in Singapore itself, instead of Google elsewhere?&nbsp; And one reason Google was able to attract&nbsp;top talent, as it received millions of applications every year, is because they allow their staff to apportion 20% of their time to develop their own projects which are very much associated with social or community developments.&nbsp; How can we then transform or adapt this strategy to our local context and encourage either our companies or even our&nbsp;civil service to adopt the same concept so that we can also attract top talents?\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> The 26 Singaporeans I met last month are all working in San Francisco,&nbsp;Shanghai or Beijing.&nbsp; Google obviously has other employees in Singapore and in fact they do want to expand in Singapore, not just the sales marketing office, but the research and development laboratory.&nbsp; But the key limiting factor again is talent, making sure that&nbsp;they have top talent who can do top-class work because in this sector, it is very, very&nbsp;competitive.&nbsp; But the lesson which I learned there was that&nbsp;we can attract top talent if, firstly,&nbsp;we recognise top talent; secondly,&nbsp;they must give opportunities for these talents to express&nbsp;themselves and, in their own words, to change the world; and, thirdly, it has got to be connected into a global network.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My point is that if you look at what we are trying to do in Singapore, we are trying to attract top talent into the infocomm sector.&nbsp; We are trying to get scholarships.&nbsp; We are trying to give opportunities.&nbsp; We are trying to network them.&nbsp; And we are also trying to make sure both local startups, local enterprises and top-class global enterprises establish their presence in Singapore&nbsp;in the full spectrum of jobs, so that the key point is that there will be opportunities.&nbsp; And we believe we can do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be able to attract and retain our own top talent who currently may be attracted overseas.&nbsp; But we can attract them back here and, when they are back here, to actually embark on a process of creation of new intellectual property, new products and new services which can change the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very difficult challenge, but I believe it is one that we have to do.&nbsp; Because if we do not do that, we will lose the very essence that keeps Singapore at the forefront of technology and what our future hopes are about.&nbsp; That is why, in a sense, we are investing in a broader sense in research and development.&nbsp; It is not really about laboratories.&nbsp; Laboratories are easy to build.&nbsp; It is about attracting top brains and then giving them opportunities, the network and bring about the creation of new ideas, new products and new services.&nbsp; Arts and design come into it also.&nbsp; Because top talents want to live in a place that&nbsp;also has cultural relevance and resilience, also a place in which arts and culture&nbsp;are expressed and expressed at the highest level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what MICA is doing, working with the rest of Government, is creating a Singapore of the future which will be conducive to attracting top talent and getting these top talents to express ideas and products.&nbsp;&nbsp;As what I said just now, we need both the right brain and the left brain.&nbsp; And if we can successfully do that in our next phase of Singapore's development,&nbsp;there will be many, many opportunities for people who today consider themselves artists, but really also need a grounding in science and technology, opportunities for our engineers and technicians who will also understand that you need to appreciate design,&nbsp;culture and&nbsp;language.&nbsp; Even our multi-culturalism is both, not just an economic good, but also an expression of ourselves.&nbsp; So when we talk about branding, I come back to SMS Balaji's point, that it must be authentic.&nbsp;

But having said that, as we move into a knowledge-based economy, into a talent resource economy, I cannot mandate when and where you think of new radical ideas.&nbsp; I do not dictate how many hours you should spend ruminating about the future and how many hours you should spend on your job at hand. Sir, I think let us be less prescriptive and less uptight about this.&nbsp; Just understand that you get good people, you give them opportunities, you educate them, you retool them, reskill them and make sure they are current and&nbsp;opaque with what new progress in science and technology offers.&nbsp; At the same time, they also have a connection to their heart and&nbsp;linguistic and cultural heritage.&nbsp; I think you will see real fruits from that kind of environment.&nbsp; So I do not want to be overly prescriptive on this.&nbsp; But I think every employer will know that the race today is to attract talent and you will have to structure your own workplace, your own employment package so that top talent feels fulfilled and&nbsp;challenged working for you.&nbsp; On the Government side, in the civil service, we will of course make our own efforts to do that.&nbsp; But I think each company and&nbsp;enterprise will also have to do so.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

That the total sum to be allocated for Head J of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like, if I may, to ask the Minister for Defence a concentric question.&nbsp; Concentric because it starts with an overview and narrows down to specifics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the current international security environment still has that US focus on Iraq and Afghanistan.&nbsp; Some Singaporeans wonder what that has to do with us, what impact it has on us,&nbsp;because Singapore has supported the US in its efforts in Iraq as well as Afghanistan.&nbsp; I would like the Minister to comment on the relevance of Singapore's position with respect to this international perspective.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving in a little bit closer, China and India obviously have risen very rapidly economically.&nbsp; Does their economic rise also impact on the security landscape around us?&nbsp; To what degree does it impact on it?&nbsp; What sort of cooperation do we have with them?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming in a little closer to the region, I would like to ask the Minister for his assessment of our security environment in the region.&nbsp; Prior to 2001, our security threat assessment was more in terms of conventional threats.&nbsp; Since 2001, however, it is clear that the biggest threat to our security environment is the non-conventional threat of terrorism.&nbsp; We are surrounded by countries where terrorism is an issue.&nbsp; There had been reports of militant groups in Indonesia as well as, of course,&nbsp;incidents of terrorism in Indonesia.&nbsp; There are separatist groups in the Philippines as well as unrest in southern Thailand.&nbsp; Closer to home, we have had the detention of the JI detainees, and the escape of Mas Selamat from the detention centre two days ago is a stark reminder that the threat is also present here.&nbsp; The fact that it interlinks with our neighbouring countries can be seen from the fact that the Malaysian security forces went on alert when the news of the escape came out and the Indonesian security forces are obviously also on standby.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that sort of surrounding environment, I would like to ask the Minister if he could update us on his assessment of our regional security environment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That also brings us to cooperation between the Home Team and the SAF because, obviously, I had seen in the news in the past couple of days that, with the manhunt going on, I saw not just Home Team personnel but SAF personnel involved&nbsp;there as well.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister about the degree of cooperation between the Home Team, the SAF as well as the other security agencies,&nbsp;whether coordination has been working, whether there had been any hiccups, whether or not there are lessons to be learnt from it, and what else can be done.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, if the Minister could also give us an overview of the issue of maritime security, piracy in the straits which has been a persistent problem, whether the situation has improved, the role that the Republic of Singapore Navy plays, and whether or not there are further steps to be taken in that respect.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower (Mr Hawazi Daipi)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We live in a world of uncertainty.&nbsp; The consequence of the end of the Cold War, the rise of China and India as economic and military powers as well as the threat of global terrorism pose constant challenge to the security and safety of states, more so for small states like Singapore.&nbsp; I believe Singaporeans support the Government's defence policy which has brought about a strong SAF that&nbsp;protects their safety and provides security.&nbsp; However, the uncertainty in the global and regional security environment calls for constant vigilance and agility of our defence policy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, I would like to ask the Minister for an update on the security environment around Southeast Asia and the wider region.&nbsp; Are we cooperating better with our neighbours to enhance our collective security in Southeast Asia, in particular, as an example, with Indonesia, despite the problems that we have in implementing the already agreed Defence Cooperation Agreement?&nbsp; Are the two countries cooperating in other mutually beneficial collaboration?&nbsp; How has the success been of our own and ASEAN's policy of engaging the major powers in dialogues&nbsp;on security in the region?&nbsp; What have been the attitude and response of the United States, Russia, China and India, for example, to ASEAN's aspiration for peace and stability?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would also like to know about the progress of specific defence cooperation, such as one in combating piracy and terrorist attacks in the Straits of Malacca which is critical to our economic well-being.&nbsp; I believe clear articulation of the security challenges and threats to Singapore would help Singaporeans understand and appreciate our defence policies better.&nbsp; This is especially so because Singaporeans are directly or indirectly involved in Singapore's defence through National Service.&nbsp; The escape of the Jemaah Islamiyah mastermind, Mas Selamat Kastari, from detention yesterday has highlighted the potential threat of terrorism and terrorist attacks in Singapore.&nbsp; Can the Minister give his assessment on the extent of the threat from terrorist groups in Singapore and around the region?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

(5)&nbsp; Moving beyond ASEAN, could&nbsp;the Minister&nbsp;also update us on defence cooperation on the bilateral front?&nbsp; With Indonesia, of course, the DCA appears to be in a state of suspension.&nbsp;

(7)&nbsp; Yesterday, in the Committee of Supply for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Foreign Affairs mentioned that we have reached an agreement with India on training for the Republic of Singapore Air Force.&nbsp; I would be grateful if the Minister for Defence could elaborate on this and provide us with further details, and also whether we have&nbsp;similar types of defence cooperation with China.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Singapore has been fortunate enough to have many years of peace.&nbsp; That does&nbsp;mean though that we are not necessarily engaged in offensive operations but it does not mean that we stand down in terms of training or actual operations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past couple of years, we have had peace time operations, such as the tsunami relief operations, which have engendered a great deal of goodwill for the SAF.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what has been achieved through defence diplomacy and how has that helped to, if you like, consolidate Singapore's position in terms of security.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Michael Palmer (Pasir Ris-Punggol)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Of course, there have been ups and downs but, of late, relations have been rejuvenated and have improved.&nbsp; Our defence relations with Malaysia, in my view, are equally strong.&nbsp; I accompanied the Minister on a recent bilateral visit to Malaysia and I came away with the impression that bilateral relationship with our neighbour is healthy.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister to give his views on the bilateral defence relationship with Malaysia?&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the close bilateral relationship and the fact that Singapore takes part in Five-Power Defence Exercises with Malaysia, I understand that restrictions still apply to our aircraft flying in Malaysian airspace.&nbsp; In fact, I understand that even during the combined exercises, such as the Five-Power Defence Exercises, restrictions are imposed on our aircraft only.&nbsp; There are no restrictions placed on aircraft from other countries taking part.&nbsp; In the face of the good relationship, this is an odd position for a friendly country to take.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister to clarify what the current airspace restrictions are that are imposed by Malaysia in respect of RSAF aircraft, and whether we intend to take any steps to correct this position and, if so, what steps?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning to Indonesia, our bilateral relations with Indonesia appear also to be on a firm footing.&nbsp; However, the Defence Cooperation Agreement, as Ms Indranee Rajah has mentioned, appears to have been put in cold storage, with no sign of implementation in sight.&nbsp; The DCA, together with the Extradition Treaty, was finalised on 23rd April last year.&nbsp; After the signing of both agreements as a package, the Indonesians raised various issues concerning the DCA which I can only surmise as being a tactic aimed at scuttling the implementation of it.&nbsp; Out of goodwill, we made a proposal for a way forward on 22nd May last year.&nbsp; Since then, we have heard nothing and no progress appears to have been made.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister to give us an update on the state of defence relations with Indonesia?&nbsp; What is the present status of the DCA?&nbsp; Is there any prospect of getting Indonesia to comply with its obligations under the DCA?&nbsp; What are we doing about it?&nbsp; What has been the response, if any, to our proposal for a way forward which we made on 22nd May 2007?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In the earlier years, we projected the SAF as the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. Then came joint operations.&nbsp; Now we emphasise one SAF&nbsp;&ndash; the SAF as an integrated fighting force.&nbsp; In the new development, SAF has acquired new weapons and upgraded its hardware. Its emphasis is on technology, fire power and mobility.&nbsp; But operational doctrines must move in tandem with changes in technology, equipment and force structure.&nbsp;&nbsp;How then can the SAF ensure that its doctrines are revised and updated constantly and that its officers and men are trained and orientated to the new doctrines?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in terms of an integrated fighting force, what is the best command structure to exercise diverse operations that the SAF has to undertake which may entail the deployment of different units from the Army, Navy and Air Force?&nbsp; A question is: who is in command? What is indeed an integrated command?&nbsp; Is the SAF prepared to counter a terrorist attack or a biological or chemical attack?&nbsp; How can the SAF support the Ministry of Home Affairs in preventing or addressing such incidents like the escape of Mas Selamat?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we talk about a 3G SAF, will the officers in the SAF&nbsp;be distracted and not focus their minds on the strategic big picture or strategic thinking?&nbsp; Do they have sufficient time to think about strategies besides tactics? Have they learnt about Sun Tzu's <I>Art of War</I> or Clausewitz's&nbsp;principle that war is an extension of political will and not an end by itself?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, Sir, there was a small aircraft that flew into Singapore without prior air clearance and our fighter jets scrambled to verify and escort the plane to land at Changi Airport.&nbsp; This, indeed, is a good demonstration of the operational readiness of the SAF. &nbsp;The question before us is: &nbsp;if the plane did not respond in time, would it be shot down?

The key to this change was a concerted effort to network and connect each different component part so as to enable all parts to work as a whole.&nbsp; This change would not only include upgrading our machinery&nbsp;and equipment, such as acquiring new F15s, unmanned aerial vehicles, naval helicopters and Leopard tanks. &nbsp;It would also include making use of electronic and computer technology under requisite training to achieve an integrated knowledge-based command and control (IKC2).\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; During last year's Committee of Supply debate, the Minister was asked by Ms Indranee Rajah to describe the elephant.&nbsp; His reply was this: \"What we are trying to do in the Third Generation SAF is to harness all their vital qualities, bring them together, make them work together in a networked way so that we can draw on all their capabilities together to defend Singapore.\"&nbsp; I believe that these changes are both desirable and vital.&nbsp; Those of us who have served in the Armed Forces or who have had to take command of any large body of personnel and equipment will know that the more information that can be shared and the faster that information can be shared, gives the Armed Forces a clear advantage over their enemy.&nbsp; Having any army with IKC2 means more efficient use of resources, thereby maximising command and control that ultimately results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The change to a 3G SAF is to be commended.&nbsp; It will ensure that our SAF remains a force&nbsp;to be reckoned with, thereby achieving its objective of deterring the enemy.&nbsp; However, given the huge amount of money that we are spending on this transition to a 3G SAF, may I ask the Minister the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the status of our transition to a 3G SAF? &nbsp;Is our 3G SAF operationally-ready?&nbsp; If not, when will it be?&nbsp; What is required to complete the transition?&nbsp; What difficulties have been encountered in the transition?&nbsp; What is the total amount that has been spent on this transition?&nbsp; In the event of a failure of the technology or network, is there a back-up plan so that the SAF's integrity and effectiveness are not compromised? &nbsp;Will our Forces still be able to operate?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Defence Research and Technology</em>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Sir, I note that we have a sizeable budget for defence, but observers have little reason to be alarmed.&nbsp; Firstly, our Armed Forces are limited by size.

At the sitting on 7th September 2007 of this House, the Minister reported that, following the Dave Teo incident, the SAF had done a thorough audit of the physical security of all SAF camps and guard rooms and that, whilst most of them fully met with the physical security requirements, a few required improvements and that the SAF was in the process of implementing those improvements.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister for an update on what these improvements were and whether they have been implemented.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, as the Minister may recall, when Corporal Dave Teo was arrested, he was found with two sets of ammunition, five rounds and three rounds.&nbsp; The five rounds were the ones that he had with him when he was on guard duty, and he had three additional tracer rounds which he had appropriated two weeks before he went missing.&nbsp; At that time, I had asked how those three rounds came to be overlooked.&nbsp; The Minister's response at that time was to say that he could not say it was impossible for a determined person to secrete one or two rounds of ammunition, though it would be difficult to do so.&nbsp; And he said that, at that time, investigations were continuing and he did not want to make any presumption on how it might have happened.&nbsp; Five months have now passed.&nbsp; So I would like to ask about the outcome of the investigations on how those three tracer rounds came to be missing and whether this has necessitated any further tightening of procedures for accounting of ammunition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving on to fitness, Sir, a large part of our standing force comprises reservists, now called Operationally-ready NSmen, to better reflect their readiness to go into action at any given point in time.&nbsp; I am concerned about the fitness of our NSmen.&nbsp; There is no problem when they are NSFs, doing full-time NS, from age 18 to 20.&nbsp; The question is whether, after they finish NS and enter the workforce, they remain fit enough to carry out operational duties until age 50 for officers and age 40 for other ranks?&nbsp; Once they enter the workforce, they have to contend with the more sedentary lifestyles, the temptation of unhealthy diets and, in many cases, smoking and drinking, which also take a toll on health and fitness.&nbsp; I know that they have to do IPPT and I understand that, for many, the 2.4-kilometre run and the standing broad jump pose the most difficult challenges.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

It is a duty which male Singaporeans and second generation permanent residents are conscripted into the Singapore Armed Forces at the age of 18.&nbsp; Over the years, our National Service policy has undergone some changes.&nbsp; We undertook a policy to review the length of National Service.&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending on their education and level of fitness, National Service now lasts between 22-24 months.&nbsp; I was among those in this House calling for a shorter NS stint.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Furthermore, the amount of training required to make our defence force operationally ready is substantive.&nbsp; It would take a certain amount of time and training to orientate conscripts into military life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, would the Minister share his thoughts on the shorter term of National Service?&nbsp; And how has our 3G SAF been able to hone its ability to develop a viable and operationally ready defence force, in spite of the shorter time taken for National Service?&nbsp; What has been the experience and difficulties, if any, faced by our commanders these past years since the shorter NS stint begun?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

However, the military aspect is only one part of our defence.&nbsp; Singapore subscribes to the concept of Total Defence, and Total Defence has five pillars, of which military defence is only one.&nbsp; The other four pillars are defence of the civil, economic, social and psychological pillars.&nbsp; The other four pillars are equally important and they depend on all the other members of society to succeed.&nbsp; So it means that not only able-bodied men are involved in Total Defence but also&nbsp; women, students and the elderly.&nbsp; Economic defence, for example, requires a strong economy and a strong workforce, and both men and women contribute to this aspect.&nbsp; Yet, the average woman would not normally think that when she is working and contributing to the economy, she is also contributing to Singapore's defence.&nbsp; So I think more needs to be done to make Singaporeans understand the part that they have to play in Total Defence.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was also disturbed to read a <I>New Paper</I> report on Thursday, 28th February 2008, in relation to Total Defence activities in schools, that some students complained about the following hardships&nbsp;&ndash; having to forgo lights, fans or air-conditioning for the day, having to eat sweet potatoes, and that the water from the water cooler was not cool enough.&nbsp; This does not augur very well for our psychological defence if young Singaporeans do not have the mental toughness and resilience to do without the usual comforts even for a day.&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know what plans MINDEF has to raise public awareness for Total Defence.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, I believe we cannot allow Singaporeans to take our security for granted, nor assume that it is the sole responsibility of the security agencies.&nbsp; We need to keep alive Total Defence.&nbsp; As such, I would like to ask the Minister how is MINDEF coordinating with the other agencies in ensuring that Singaporeans continue to play an active role in each of the five pillars.&nbsp; Also, I would like to ask the Minister if MINDEF periodically attracts the attitude and readiness of Singaporeans in Total Defence, and what are the indicators to ascertain this?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hawazi Daipi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Thanks to the Singapore Armed Forces.&nbsp; Singaporean families have accepted National Service as part of their life.&nbsp; However, I wonder if the high standard of living and a good life that we enjoy now has had any adverse effects on Singaporeans' attitude towards national defence and their roles in it?&nbsp; Has MINDEF done any study to gauge the attitude of Singaporeans, including young people, towards National Service and their parts in Total Defence concept?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is also the issue of how the declining number of births among Singaporeans has affected our manpower needs in defence.&nbsp; As our young people enjoy better education and are also becoming more mobile globally, has there been any impact on their commitment to National Service?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My last question relates to how MINDEF can give recognition to the contribution of business organisations that have released their workers to do reservist training.&nbsp; The business world is becoming more fast paced and competitive.&nbsp; And so how can we better help Singaporeans as well as employers balance National Service commitments with the pressures of work, particularly for those who have to travel overseas for work?&nbsp; How can Singaporeans and the corporate citizen's commitment and contribution to National Service be recognised meaningfully?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Therefore, I would like to ask the Ministry whether these new citizens have a good understanding about NS and Total Defence, and whether the Ministry has enough measures to allow and enable new citizens to learn and understand about NS and Total Defence.&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister whether the new citizens give positive support towards our NS and Total Defence. I therefore propose that the Ministry of Defence organise camp visits for new young citizens prior to their enlistment.&nbsp; We can also present the citizenship certificates to these citizens during the camp visit, and we could play the NS video to orientate them about National Service.&nbsp; This would allow them to have a better understanding of the importance of Total Defence.\r\n</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 1591-1592.<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Defence (Mr Teo Chee Hean)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Defence (Mr Teo Chee Hean):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, I would like to thank the hon. Members for their comments and questions, and for their strong commitment to Singapore's defence and security.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Indranee Rajah and Mr Hawazi Daipi asked about the trends in our regional security environment.&nbsp; I will begin by sharing MINDEF's perspective on this.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the US remains the pre-eminent power in the Asia-Pacific, the rise of China and India is transforming Asia's strategic landscape.&nbsp; China has become the largest trading partner of many countries in the region, including Japan, South Korea and, most recently,&nbsp;Australia.&nbsp; China is also India's second-largest trading partner.&nbsp; In addition to trade, China and India are also becoming important sources of foreign direct investment (FDI).&nbsp; Since 2004, their share of the total outflows of FDI from Asia has risen from 10% to 25%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The expansion of China and India's economic space and linkages means that they will seek to secure their interests beyond their immediate neighbourhood.&nbsp; Their growing economic might allows them to progressively develop the military capabilities and diplomatic influence to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a consequence, Japan too is feeling the need to exert greater geo-political influence as a \"normal\" country.&nbsp; Japan has sought a permanent seat at the UN Security Council, and in January last year made their Defence Agency a cabinet level Ministry of Defence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Russia will also grow increasingly assertive in our region, just as it has in Europe.&nbsp; While Russia and Europe have their own security concerns mainly on their peripheries, it is only a matter of time before both Russia and the EU embark on a more coherent strategy to engage&nbsp;our region given Asia's economic dynamism and strategic potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The US remains a key player in the security and stability of our region.&nbsp; Although the US is currently preoccupied by Iraq and Afghanistan, it is vital for the US to be actively and constructively engaged in Asia.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, all countries tied to the global economy are becoming increasingly interdependent and have a common interest in peace and stability.&nbsp; However, friction and strategic competition between the major powers pose risks that need to be managed in the on-going shift in power relationships.&nbsp; Potential flashpoints in regional security remain, such as the situation across the Taiwan Strait; and transnational threats like terrorism must also be managed in a globalised world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINDEF's response to this complex and fluid regional security environment is to strengthen both&nbsp;diplomacy and deterrence.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, defence diplomacy.&nbsp; Ms&nbsp;Indranee Rajah and Mr Hawazi Daipi asked about the regional security architecture, and the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multilateral cooperation is required to counter transnational threats as well as to create a culture of constructive engagement, and peaceful dispute avoidance and resolution.&nbsp; Singapore seeks to facilitate the development of a regional security architecture, which provides a robust and flexible framework for peace and stability in Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A multi-layered and overlapping security architecture is developing&nbsp;&ndash; made up of both formal and informal forums&nbsp;&ndash; at the strategic as well as the functional levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN lies at the heart of many multi-lateral groupings, such as the ASEAN Regional Forum, the East Asia Summit and the Shangri-La Dialogue.&nbsp; We want an open and inclusive architecture, with ASEAN facilitating and shaping this architecture and its agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the broadest level, the ASEAN Regional Forum&nbsp;(ARF) brings together both foreign and defence officials from 27 countries from the Pacific to South West Asia.&nbsp; With its wide membership, the ARF provides an important forum for strategic dialogue and confidence building.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also providing a forum at the broadest level, but in a more informal format, is the Shangri-La Dialogue held annually in Singapore, which is a key multilateral event for defence and security dialogue in the region.&nbsp; Today, it is the only forum where Defence Ministers from the region and beyond gather, along with senior officials and academics.&nbsp; The informal setting of the Shangri-La Dialogue has facilitated a frank exchange of views, and allows new concepts and ideas to be floated and discussed.&nbsp; Last year, 23 countries, including 20 Ministers, took part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the regional level, we have the East Asia Summit (EAS), with the 10 ASEAN countries at its core, as well as Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea.&nbsp; The EAS' priority is currently mainly economic.&nbsp; But with its focused membership, the EAS has the potential to address complex and multi-faceted security challenges in the region, such as energy security,&nbsp;trade security and maritime security.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms&nbsp;Indranee Rajah asked about the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting, or ADMM.&nbsp; The ADMM is an important step towards building an ASEAN Security Community.&nbsp; Singapore had the honour of hosting the second ADMM last November.&nbsp; At that meeting, we made significant progress.&nbsp; Chief of Defence Force LG Desmond Kuek updated the ASEAN Defence Ministers on&nbsp;the two-year activity workplan.&nbsp; This plan has been adopted by the ASEAN CDFs, and will foster practical cooperation in areas such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, counter-terrorism and maritime security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Importantly, we also agreed on the principles for what is called the &lsquo;ADMM-Plus&rsquo;.&nbsp; The ADMM-Plus is part of an evolving, open and inclusive regional security framework that allows the ASEAN defence track to engage countries beyond Southeast Asia.&nbsp; Security issues in Southeast Asia such as maritime security, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, or combating international terrorism, cannot be solved only by countries within our region.&nbsp; Extra-regional countries that have a stake in the region can bring expertise, perspectives and resources to bear on such shared transnational security challenges in Southeast Asia.&nbsp; It is also important that we engage the major powers and facilitate constructive and cooperative norms of behaviour in our region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Complementing this web of security forums is the development of a collection of operational arrangements and functional groupings which address specific challenges, such as maritime security.&nbsp; Dr Ong Chit Chung and Mr Hawazi asked about the security of the Malacca Straits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operational arrangements like the Malacca Straits Patrol, where the three littoral states, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, conduct coordinated sea and maritime air patrols, enhance the security of the Straits of Malacca.&nbsp; According to the International Maritime Bureau (IMB), the number of piracy attacks in the Straits of Malacca has declined, with only seven incidents in 2007, down from a recent peak of 38 in 2004.&nbsp; The IMB attributed this to the vigilant efforts of the littoral states.&nbsp; The commitment and political will of the littoral states remain strong.&nbsp; We are pleased that Thailand has announced its intention to join the Malacca Straits Patrols.&nbsp; The littoral states agree that user states can also contribute to the security of the Malacca Straits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other functional groupings like the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery Against Ships in Asia or,&nbsp;in short, ReCAAP, which currently has 14 members, have also contributed to improving the maritime security situation.&nbsp; The Singapore-based ReCAAP Information Sharing Centre (or ISC) facilitates the sharing of best practices amongst countries.&nbsp; The ISC recently hosted a Capacity Building Workshop in Singapore last October, in which almost all the ReCAAP member countries, as well as Indonesia and Malaysia which are not yet members of ReCAAP, participated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, to complement the various multilateral and functional groupings, an extensive web of bilateral defence relations between the countries of the Asia-Pacific provides a strong base for the regional security architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore will continue to deepen our network of bilateral defence relationships.&nbsp; Let me begin with our closest neighbours.&nbsp; Mr Michael Palmer and others asked about our defence relations with Malaysia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore and Malaysia share a long history of bilateral defence relations.&nbsp; The deep and broad-based nature of our defence linkages, from bilateral exercises to other professional interactions, has kept our lines of communication open.&nbsp; All three services have now instituted what are called&nbsp;&ldquo;Top Ten&rdquo; interactions.&nbsp; Besides enabling senior military leaders to get to know each other, these occasions also allow for informal discussions on issues of mutual interest.&nbsp; Such linkages build confidence and will help us weather the occasional political storm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently made a working visit to Malaysia in January.&nbsp; I met Dato&rsquo; Seri Najib&nbsp;Razak, and we reaffirmed the longstanding defence ties between Singapore and Malaysia.&nbsp; I was very happy that Mr Palmer and&nbsp;Dr Maliki&nbsp;came along for this visit.&nbsp; I also had the opportunity to give a talk to senior Malaysian officers attending the Malaysian Armed Forces Defence College on bilateral relations, and how Malaysia and Singapore can work together to strengthen regional security.&nbsp; I am glad that we had an open, frank and honest discussion during this dialogue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, both countries see the importance of developing good defence relations.&nbsp; We also continue to cooperate through the Five Power Defence Arrangements, and on regional security issues like the ASEAN Defence Ministers&rsquo; Meeting, and the successful Malacca Straits Patrol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Palmer&nbsp;asked about airspace restrictions.&nbsp; Certain agreements were terminated, which I hope will be reinstated eventually.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I hope that restrictions imposed on RSAF aircraft in FPDA exercises will eventually be lifted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to Indonesia.&nbsp; Mr&nbsp;Palmer&nbsp;and others asked&nbsp;about our defence relations and the&nbsp;Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA).&nbsp; Singapore and Indonesia have worked closely together for over 40 years to ensure peace, stability and prosperity in Southeast Asia.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the package with the Extradition Treaty (ET), both countries signed the DCA in order to strengthen our defence relations. &nbsp;Singapore stands ready to honour this package of agreements.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this package has run into difficulties.&nbsp; We recognise that the domestic conditions in Indonesia may not allow for the package of agreements to be ratified at this time.&nbsp; Both Singapore and Indonesia have therefore agreed that the best option for both countries is to put the DCA and the ET aside for now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The leaderships of both the TNI and the SAF share the common view that the defence relationship between Singapore and Indonesia is an important one, and mutually beneficial.&nbsp; I met the new Indonesian Navy and Air Force Chiefs in Singapore very recently, and both emphasised this point.&nbsp; Both sides remain committed to working closely together to strengthen bilateral defence relations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recent exercises conducted with the TNI include the bilateral navy exercise, Exercise Eagle, in January 2008.&nbsp; This was the 20th in the series, the first being conducted 34 years ago in 1974, which I remember fondly.&nbsp; Last December, our two Armies carried out the annual brigade-level exercise, called Safkar Indopura.&nbsp; This is the&nbsp;19th in the series,&nbsp;and&nbsp;it included a live-firing exercise conducted by Indonesian troops in Singapore, with their SAF counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides our immediate neighbours, we are also strengthening defence relations with key players in the Asia-Pacific.&nbsp; The Strategic Framework Agreement, signed with the US in 2005, established Singapore as a Major Security Co-operation Partner.&nbsp; Bilateral cooperation continues to move ahead at a high tempo.&nbsp; Our F-16, Apache and Chinook detachments conduct high-end training in the US.&nbsp; More recently, our pilots have begun naval helicopter training in San Diego, while our F-15 training in Mountain Home, Idaho, will start next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With China, we recently signed the Agreement on Defence Exchanges and Security Cooperation.&nbsp; This Agreement formalises on-going activities between MINDEF and the PLA, such as the exchange of visits, attendance at courses and seminars, and port calls.&nbsp; The agreement also includes new areas of cooperation such as Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief.&nbsp; The inaugural China-Singapore Defence Policy Dialogue was held in January this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With India, since signing a Defence Cooperation Agreement in 2003, we have steadily expanded our interactions.&nbsp; We recently concluded a Bilateral Agreement for joint training and exercises in India between the RSAF and Indian Air Force in October last year.&nbsp; We also continue to welcome the Indian Airforce and Navy to this part of the world for visits and exercises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our ties with Australia and New Zealand remain particularly close and strong.&nbsp; We have many exercises and exchanges with the armed forces of both these countries and appreciate the opportunities for training that are provided by both countries to the SAF.&nbsp; This has enabled us to develop a level of understanding that enables the SAF to deploy with the ADF and the New Zealand Defence Force when needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Japan, we have encouraged the Japanese Self-Defence Force's engagement with our region by supporting their participation in exercises and offering our facilities for their ships and aircraft transits when they deploy through this region.&nbsp; In fact, the Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force is the second largest foreign user of Changi Naval Base, after the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Rajah also asked about Vietnam.&nbsp; We have good relations with Vietnam which are developing and going stronger, and the Defence Minister of Vietnam and myself visited each other over the last five months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has also been contributing to peace support operations and international reconstruction efforts.&nbsp; Dr Maliki&nbsp;and Mr Arthur Fong asked about our current contributions, and our reasons for doing so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 2,000 SAF servicemen have served on international missions.&nbsp; SAF personnel are currently serving in the UN Integrated Mission in Timor Leste and the UN Mission in Nepal.&nbsp; Since 2003, we have been supporting the multinational efforts in Iraq with our deployments of Landing Ships Tank, and C-130 transport and KC-135 tanker aircraft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2007, Singapore deployed a five-man dental team and a five-man construction engineering team to Bamiyan in Afghanistan in support of the multinational reconstruction effort there.&nbsp; Each team spent&nbsp;three months deployed with the New Zealand-led Provincial Reconstruction Team&nbsp;in Bamiyan Province.&nbsp; Our dental team treated nearly 1,000 patients.&nbsp; The Governor of Bamiyan told us that the dental clinic greatly boosted local health care, as dental care was previously non-existent in the province.&nbsp; The construction of bridges has helped the local population in the villages of Chapdara and Monara.&nbsp; We currently have two SAF officers deployed in Bamiyan to coordinate the distribution of medical aid, and provide continuity for the dental project that we started there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have completed a review of our contributions to the multinational effort in Afghanistan and decided that for this year, we will deploy&nbsp;two construction engineering teams to Bamiyan with the New Zealand PRT for about&nbsp;three months each, similar to the engineering team that we deployed last year.&nbsp; As part of the review, an SAF survey team was recently deployed to Afghanistan to better understand what additional contributions the SAF can make to the ongoing stabilisation and reconstruction efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to our deployments to Bamiyan, we have also decided to deploy a SAF medical detachment to Oruzgan province.&nbsp; This will consist of two rotations of medical teams for about&nbsp;three months each to the Field Hospital in Tarin Kowt, the provincial capital of Oruzgan.&nbsp; Comprising about 20 medical and nursing officers for each rotation, the deployments will begin in the second half of this year.&nbsp; These teams will provide primary healthcare and ward capabilities in support of the medical facility run by the Dutch and Australian forces in the Dutch-led Provincial Reconstruction Team in Oruzgan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is important that Singaporeans understand why we are doing this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afghanistan is at the frontline in the global fight against terrorism.&nbsp; Extremists have made use of an unstable Afghanistan as a safe haven to train terrorists, and to export violence and terror to other countries, including Singapore.&nbsp; A number of JI detainees who had planned attacks in Singapore had trained in Afghanistan; and, more recently, a self-radicalised Singaporean was detained on the way to join the Taliban in Afghanistan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The international community recognises that the stabilisation and reconstruction of Afghanistan is critical in the global fight against terrorism.&nbsp; That is why the UN Security Council recently renewed the mandate of the International Security Assistance Force&nbsp;in Afghanistan for another year to October 2008.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

We take our international responsibilities and commitments seriously.&nbsp; Given our limited resources, we participate where we are able to make a useful and meaningful contribution.&nbsp; We do so because our contributions enhance Singapore's overall security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are aware that such deployments do involve risks to our servicemen, which can be significant.&nbsp; However, where there is real and important work of this nature to be done, there will be attendant risks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, our personnel are well trained and well prepared for their role in their assigned deployment, and to deal with any contingencies.&nbsp; This includes psychological preparation and follow-up.&nbsp; The soldiers being deployed to Oruzgan will undergo a comprehensive three-week pre-deployment training package conducted in Singapore, followed by a&nbsp;two-week preparation programme in Australia with their Australian counterparts to ensure that they can operate seamlessly with each other.&nbsp; Just prior to their deployment into Afghanistan, they will also receive further integration training with the Australian forces, where they will be comprehensively brought up to date&nbsp;on the ground situation and trained how to handle the various threats.&nbsp; I have confidence in them, and I am sure that the&nbsp;Honourable Members of this House will join me in supporting their challenging work ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, even as we contribute to international reconstruction and stabilisation efforts, the primary mission of the SAF will still be to deter any threats and defend Singapore.&nbsp; Our security remains our top priority.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2007, the SAF focused on realising the 3rd Generation SAF through the introduction of advanced platforms and capabilities, new organisational structures and processes, and people development.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have further developed the SAF's Integrated Knowledge-based Command and Control (IKC2) systems.&nbsp; The Hermes 450 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle will enhance battlefield surveillance for the SAF.&nbsp; This is a UAV that can fly for about 14 hours.&nbsp; The Gulfstream G550 Airborne Early Warning aircraft will significantly improve the SAF's networked air defence and early warning capabilities.&nbsp; It will replace our E2C. &nbsp;The new Formidable Class stealth frigates and the Sikorsky S-70B naval helicopters will allow us to better secure our sea lines of communication.&nbsp; The planned acquisition of the High Mobility Rocket Artillery Systems, along with the Leopard 2A4 Main Battle Tanks upgraded with the latest battlefield systems, will enhance the capability of our Army.&nbsp; These new capabilities will be integrated together with our Digitised Division Command Post, the Frigate's Combat Management System, and the networked air defence system, connecting together the key IKC2 components of the 3rd Generation SAF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin Nordin asked about MINDEF's efforts in defence R&amp;D and why these are critical to our defence strategy.&nbsp; Our defence research and technology capability enables us to create cutting-edge systems that we cannot get off-the-shelf.&nbsp; This capability has been built up over a long period of time and the SAF today is supported by some 5,000 technology professionals both within MINDEF and&nbsp;in the wider defence eco-system.&nbsp; Over the years, we have focused our research and development investments in areas such as electronic warfare, command, control, communications and computers (C4), sensors and guided systems.&nbsp; We are open to such technology being marketed in other applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Technologies has been successful in selling such technology in civilian security applications, such as in Police and fire service systems and mobile command posts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We invest about 4% of our budget on R&amp;D.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite two examples where our investments are indeed paying off.&nbsp; Our investment in building up expertise in aerodynamics and guided systems has allowed us to design and develop Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, or UAVs, that can meet our unique user requirements for surveillance, reconnaissance and communications.&nbsp; In fact, Mr Zainudin himself was involved in one of MINDEF's collaborations with Nanyang Polytechnic on advanced integrated circuits that have been used on our UAVs.&nbsp; Another area is chemical and biological defence which enabled us to draw upon our years of investment in verification, protection and decontamination capabilities to contribute, at short notice, to the national fight against SARS in 2003.&nbsp;&nbsp;This capability in R&amp;D in this area forms the foundation upon which our national chemical and biological defence systems are based.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung asked about&nbsp;changes in the SAF's command and control structure.&nbsp; Let me speak about two new organisational changes in 2007&nbsp;- the creation of the SAF Operations Hub and the SAF Capability Development Hub.&nbsp; The SAF Ops Hub is led by the new Director of Joint Operations.&nbsp; The DJO is the senior-most operations staff officer in the SAF responsible for linking together Army, Navy, and Air Force operations to maintain a high level of operational readiness against all threats, including terrorist and other unconventional attacks.&nbsp; The DJO reports to the Chief of Defence Force.&nbsp; Recently, when a civilian Cessna aircraft intruded into our airspace under suspicious circumstances, the SAF responded swiftly by scrambling two of our F-16s to intercept it.&nbsp; Although I will not go into the details, let me assure Dr Ong that MINDEF and the SAF do have a decision making process and&nbsp;are prepared to deal with such contingencies and take the necessary action to defend Singapore's security.&nbsp; This structure&nbsp;and organisation have enabled us to work very well and very smoothly with the Home Team agencies.&nbsp; The Island Defence Headquarters and the Police Divisions basically know each other every well and shake hands operationally, regularly in exercises, and this was most useful in the recent case of the escape of Mas Selamat Kastari when the Police requested for assistance.&nbsp; The SAF was able to fit in seamlessly&nbsp;to support the Police.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Ops Hub focuses on current operations, the SAF Capability Development Hub looks at the future needs of the SAF by coordinating the SAF's development strategy across all three services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Michael Palmer asked about the SAF's back-up plans in case&nbsp;equipment stops working&nbsp;in the 3rd Generation SAF.&nbsp; This is an important question.&nbsp; Critical systems have multiple layers of redundancy at both the system and equipment levels.&nbsp; Robustness and resilience are accorded a high priority.&nbsp; This applies not only to IT systems, databases and communications, but also to power supply and infrastructure.&nbsp; For example, we have multiple routings to connect our communication nodes including land lines, microwave and wireless networks.&nbsp; To make sure that recovery from any equipment failure is swift, the SAF has developed comprehensive contingency plans, which we test regularly.&nbsp; Finally, the SAF is trained to function even without some of the new technologies.&nbsp; This is done by continuing to emphasise basic skills and competencies.&nbsp; So, for instance, while our soldiers are trained to operate with GPS and a digital map, they continue to be well-trained in basic map reading and navigation skills.&nbsp; In other words, even if the technology fails, the SAF will not.&nbsp; Nonetheless, let me assure this House that the SAF will continue to review its systems and equipment to ensure that robust systems are in place to manage the risks from technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Michael Palmer also asked about the total amount expended to transit to a 3rd Generation SAF.&nbsp; Let me provide an order of magnitude,&nbsp;a sense, of how much we allocate.&nbsp; The SAF is projected to invest an estimated 50% of its capital budget on the 3rd Generation SAF, which represents investments in areas such as IKC2, precision weapons and unmanned systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I may draw Members' attention to the folder that has been placed on their seats,&nbsp;it contains a January 2008 <I>Pioneer</I> magazine,&nbsp;which gives a flavour of what the SAF has been doing as well as some IKC2 things.&nbsp; There is also a video inside which will be shown tonight at 7.00 pm on TV, and&nbsp;it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;shown five times in the coming month.&nbsp; It is quite a nice video.&nbsp; So I encourage&nbsp;Members to watch it in&nbsp;their free time and perhaps play it during&nbsp;their MPS sessions so that&nbsp;their constituents have something interesting to see.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developing the 3rd Generation SAF requires a long period of steady investment in our people - to nurture qualified and confident operators who can work on new systems and develop new concepts.&nbsp; The SAF also places a priority on engaging our servicemen to ensure that they are imbued with a strong fighting spirit and are firmly committed to the defence of Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is prepared to spend up to 6% of GDP on Defence.&nbsp; In practice, over the past&nbsp;five years, MINDEF has found it adequate to spend about 4.5% to 5% of GDP on defence.&nbsp; MINDEF maintains a very rigorous system of controls in our budget process to ensure that we use the money that has been allocated wisely and prudently.&nbsp; The Government believes that the best way to provide for our defence is to continue to make steady investments every year, rather than to take a feast and famine approach, where the&nbsp;budget fluctuates widely from year to year.&nbsp; With a steady pattern of spending, we can develop our forces&nbsp;- our hardware and our people - more cost-effectively, and maintain a high level of operational readiness at all times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our investment in the SAF remains the foundation for peace and stability that is necessary for the economic growth and prosperity of Singapore and our freedom to forge our own future.&nbsp; Fundamental to this are the strong public commitment to defence and the strong support of this House.&nbsp; I welcome Ms Indranee Rajah taking the IPPT with our NSmen.&nbsp; And although she has not done NS, I notice that she has learnt how to volunteer others already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While setting aside sufficient budget each year for defence is important, the most important investment in defence is made by every male Singaporean through National Service (NS).&nbsp; Last year, we commemorated the 40th year of NS.&nbsp; I am sure this House joins me in recognising the active commitment and sacrifices made by our citizens, especially our Operationally Ready NSmen, to the defence of Singapore.<br>\r\n &nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our society's broad-based commitment to defence underpins our concept of Total Defence, where every sector of society and every citizen contribute to Singapore's defence in their own ways.&nbsp; As long as Singapore is cohesive and our citizens are willing to play their part, potential adversaries will think twice before taking us on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its part, the SAF ensures that our NSmen are well-trained, well-equipped and well-led, so that should our soldiers ever be called to fight and defend Singapore, they will win and come home safely to their loved ones.&nbsp; Our investments through the defence budget, and the investment of the time, energy and dedication of each of our NSmen, as well as the support of their families, employers and our wider society ensure that Singaporeans can continue to live in peace and prosper, while enjoying our right to determine our own future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now ask Dr Ng to speak on how we are addressing the human resource challenges in the SAF as well as camp security, and Prof. Koo to speak on National Service, Total Defence and Commitment to Defence.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Second Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We will need to be smarter in the use of technology to be more efficient so that every defence dollar is stretched to the limit.&nbsp; But above all, in that moment of reckoning, it will be our soldiers and people, their passion, resolve and commitment that will ultimately determine if we can protect and preserve what we have built and hold precious.&nbsp; MINDEF is committed to offer compelling careers to attract the right sort of people to join and stay with us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong pointed out that&nbsp;the labour market has indeed tightened and opportunities have increased.&nbsp; MINDEF&nbsp;recognises that it must compete, with other organisations, to attract people with the requisite attributes and aptitude.&nbsp; As part of our value proposition, MINDEF offers exciting careers which encompass extensive opportunities for development and growth as well as competitive remuneration packages.&nbsp; We have the SAVER scheme for regular Officers and the Premium Plan for regular Warrant Officers and Specialists, or WOSpecs in short.&nbsp; While these schemes have served us well, we have recently embarked on a strategic review to take into account new market realities as well as the operational demands of a 3rd Generation SAF.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operational demands of the 3rd Generation SAF require that we attract and groom people who can leverage on technology, operate sophisticated systems and adapt rapidly.&nbsp; Arising from our strategic review to recruit and retain the right type of people, MINDEF has recently made several refinements to&nbsp;strengthen our career proposition.&nbsp; But before I go into&nbsp;specifics, it is important to put into proper perspective the role of incentive structures.&nbsp; We will always seek to attract those who have the right values, motivations and capabilities to lead and serve in the SAF.&nbsp; And I certainly hope that, for many, it is more than a vocation and it is a calling.&nbsp; But MINDEF also recognises that good people will be attracted to a progressive organisation that values its employees and helps them in their development.&nbsp; Remuneration is important, but employees also want to be developed to their full potential to be able&nbsp;to give their best to the organisation.&nbsp; This basically is the philosophy underpinning our incentive schemes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members may not be&nbsp;familiar with the present schemes.&nbsp; To familiarise Members, let me&nbsp;first talk about the SAVER scheme for officers and then the recent enhancements introduced.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAVER scheme, first and foremost, helps the SAF to attract capable leaders that keep the SAF dynamic and forward-looking&nbsp;to deal with the wide spectrum of scenarios and corresponding threats.&nbsp; A career in the SAF&nbsp;is physically demanding and this is why we retire our officers young, as some Members have pointed out, at&nbsp;about age 45.&nbsp; This age allows for a career length that is enough for our officers to be developed professionally and to make significant contributions to the SAF before they embark on their next career.&nbsp; To help in the transition, the scheme provides an attractive package which includes a substantial lump sum when they retire.&nbsp; As a result, their earnings from a career with the SAF up till the age of 45, compares well with the typical earnings from a full career in the private sector.&nbsp; Our experience has shown that most are able to transit successfully to their second careers, with more than 75% finding jobs within three months of leaving, and 85% after six months of leaving the SAF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made a number of enhancements to the SAVER scheme.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we have extended career lengths by up to three years, as proposed by Dr Ong Chit Chung and Mr Ang Mong Seng.&nbsp; With extensions, Colonels will leave service at 47 years of age, while Majors and Lieutenant-Colonels leave service at age 45.&nbsp; But let me say that the extension was necessary for operational reasons because it&nbsp;catered to new demands for more foundational and integrated training in a 3rd Generation SAF.&nbsp; Even after the extension, officers will leave with the necessary experience and expertise and young enough to embark on their second careers.&nbsp; The total remuneration package will put them in a strong financial position when they leave the SAF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we will put in additional mid-term retention bonuses.&nbsp; Officers tend to review their career options when they approach their early 30s.&nbsp; To encourage officers to complete a full career with us, we will increase the incentive amounts for those who stay till the end of the first 10 years.&nbsp; Officers also have the option of making withdrawals in advance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, wage structures will be adjusted to be more responsive to market conditions.&nbsp; We have added a new Variable Market Bonus for officers, and this&nbsp;is pegged to&nbsp;GDP growth.&nbsp; It&nbsp;will be paid out over two tranches in years of good economic growth.&nbsp; The first tranche will be paid in October of that year, based on GDP growth projections announced by the Government in the third quarter of that year.&nbsp; The second tranche will be paid the following April, after the actual GDP growth for that year has been determined.&nbsp; This mode of payment in two tranches enables us to respond more swiftly to wage movements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we recently introduced part-time degree sponsorships for non-graduate officers to upgrade themselves.&nbsp; This is in addition to the many existing schemes for our officers to further their academic qualifications and professional development.&nbsp; Over the years, many officers have benefited from these opportunities.&nbsp; Let me just cite one example.&nbsp; LTC Li Lit Siew, Commanding Officer of 191 Squadron in the Navy, is a naval officer with more than 20 years of service.&nbsp; He has been&nbsp;Honourary Aide-de-Camp to the President and&nbsp;has commanded a Task Group for peace support in Iraq.&nbsp; LTC Li was first sponsored for a local degree programme at NTU two years into service, and later for postgraduate studies at the US Naval Postgraduate School in 1999.&nbsp; Like LTC Li, many officers have received similar opportunities to realise their academic aspirations and have a fulfilling career in the SAF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now talk about the WOSpecs scheme.&nbsp; There is a wider range of operational and technical jobs where longer experience and service is necessary.&nbsp; Hence, WOSpecs serve till the age of 55 because they possess specialised skills and play key roles in training the current and also the next generation of soldiers.&nbsp; To bring in good people into the WOSpec Corps, we increased the recruitment incentives for the various induction schemes.&nbsp; The wages of our WOSpecs are also regularly reviewed to ensure that they remain competitive.&nbsp; In line with market movements, we raised starting salaries and paid a market adjustment component last year to improve recruitment and retention.&nbsp; We will also be paying out a market adjustment component this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have introduced new measures as well to meet the academic aspirations of our WOSpecs.&nbsp; To attract good diploma holders to join the WOSpec Corps, we have introduced degree sponsorships for WOSpecs.&nbsp; This is in addition to the current opportunities for upgrading to ITE, Diploma and Advanced Diploma qualifications.&nbsp; One of those who have benefited from such upgrading opportunities is 2WO Koh Ping Wah, Senior Medic in HQ Guards.&nbsp; In the 13 years he has spent in the SAF, 2WO Koh has served in progressively senior appointments, taking part in peacekeeping operations in Timor Leste as well as the humanitarian relief operations in post-Tsunami Aceh.&nbsp; 2WO Koh has a strong passion for nursing, which explains his specialisation as a combat medic.&nbsp; Come this April, he&nbsp;will further his passion&nbsp;by pursuing a full-time Advanced Diploma in Nursing, sponsored by the SAF.&nbsp; He&nbsp;is&nbsp;an example of how the SAF has enabled our regulars to realise their aspirations to upgrade their educational qualifications while providing a fulfilling career.&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF will regularly review our schemes to ensure that the SAF continues to offer compelling careers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong&nbsp;asked if investment returns from the SAVER scheme could be improved.&nbsp; Let me first clarify that Dr Ong is referring actually to the SAVER-Premium Fund which is applicable to both officers and WOSpecs respectively.&nbsp; This Fund is not from the salary of our officers and WOSpecs but drawn from additional contributions which MINDEF provides so as to enhance the total lump sum when they leave.&nbsp; Accordingly, the Fund is invested to achieve steady returns over the long term.&nbsp; We have in place an investment committee made up of experienced and qualified financial professionals who provide oversight and guidance of investments in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.&nbsp; As with other investment funds, there would be&nbsp;short periods of volatility in return. &nbsp;Officers and WOSpecs can choose their investment plans based on their risk appetites.&nbsp; Our advice to them has been to recognise that this Fund is for their longer term retirement and not for speculative purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Indranee Rajah asked for an update on the incident involving&nbsp;CPL Dave Teo.&nbsp; Sir, as the criminal case against CPL Teo is still pending, Ms Indranee Rajah and other Members of this House&nbsp;would understand why it would be inappropriate to comment on the ongoing case.&nbsp; But in terms of&nbsp;SAF&rsquo;s systems and processes to ensure the security of camps and control of firearms and ammunition, Minister Teo had also replied in detail, as the Member has cited, to similar queries last year, so I will only reiterate relevant points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF convened a Higher Board of Inquiry (HBOI) immediately after the incident.&nbsp; The HBOI concluded that the SAF's systems and processes were generally adequate, but that the negligence of several servicemen contributed to the security lapses in this incident.&nbsp; Those found to be negligent have been or are being disciplined.&nbsp; Our investigations also traced the three extra rounds of live ammunition mentioned by Ms Indranee Rajah to a section live firing exercise conducted two weeks prior to the incident.&nbsp; The SAF has audited its system of ammunition control for live firing exercises and found that the procedures are adequate.&nbsp; Nevertheless, these processes and procedures will be subjected to regular reviews and further strengthened, such as when new technologies emerge which can increase our effectiveness or better practices adopted from the sharing of ideas with other agencies facing similar challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the incident, the SAF has&nbsp;taken steps to improve camp security.&nbsp; For example, we have integrated various aspects of camp security audits so that they are done holistically and we have stepped up the number of spot checks to ensure compliance.&nbsp; We have also centralised the supervision of training for camp security personnel to ensure a consistent, high standard of proficiency in security duties.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I want to reassure Members of the House and the public that the SAF and MINDEF take this very seriously.&nbsp; While we have adequate processes in place, we rely on our servicemen to implement them effectively.&nbsp; No system is perfect unless we remain vigilant and people remain vigilant.&nbsp; The SAF will continue to ensure that our servicemen are effectively trained and properly supervised so that they can appreciate the importance of these processes and implement them properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a final note, Sir, I also want to thank Ms Indranee Rajah, Ms Jessica&nbsp;Tan and other&nbsp;Members of this House for volunteering to do the IPPT.&nbsp; MOS Koo Tsai Kee will respond to that.&nbsp; But I think that we should leave it to our senior commanders to judge whether it adequately stimulates - I mean motivates - our NSmen to the fitful - I mean fitness state.&nbsp; But if MINDEF judges that it is appropriate, I would want to volunteer my services <I>pro bono</I> to choose their outfits.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Defence (Assoc.

(National Education Animation) competition is being held to give our youths an opportunity to express, in creative ways, what Total Defence means to them.&nbsp; They are supposed to do a project using various computer graphics and the project is captured in a video.&nbsp; This Sunday, I will actually announce the winning team, and the winning clips will be shown on television soon.&nbsp; This competition has attracted some&nbsp;200 submissions from 106 teams, comprising 370 students from 51 schools, which is approximately a 50% increase in participation from last year.&nbsp; The best clip will be shown on national television, as I have just mentioned.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also inter-Ministry collaboration to promote Total Defence.&nbsp; The National Education Co-ordinating Committee at the Permanent Secretary level sets directions and reviews the effectiveness of programmes on National Education and Total Defence.&nbsp; At the working level, the Ministries also cooperate on a range of efforts, including the National Education programme in schools and the annual Total Defence campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To measure the effectiveness of these efforts, the Government conducts annual surveys.&nbsp; In 2007, 97% of the respondents agreed that Total Defence was important to Singapore's long-term security.&nbsp; These numbers are encouraging, but we must guard against complacency.&nbsp; A MICA survey last year showed that only 50% of Singaporeans felt they were mentally prepared for a terrorist attack, down from 67% in 2006.&nbsp; Participation in security-related exercises dropped to 14% in 2007 from 23% in the previous year.&nbsp; We&nbsp;have to&nbsp;do more together to help Singaporeans understand what they can do at an individual level.&nbsp; That is why this year's campaign theme is \"Total Defence. It's Personal. Play Your Part\".&nbsp; I encourage and urge fellow Members of Parliament to do our part and to&nbsp;help organise activities which involve&nbsp;our constituents in Total Defence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Ang Mong Seng also asked about engaging new citizens on the need for National Service (NS) and Total Defence.&nbsp;Like other Singaporeans, we engage new citizens as part of our public outreach efforts.&nbsp; Many new citizens have studied in local schools and are engaged as part of our National Education efforts, which include attending the National Day Parades and visits to SAF Open Houses.&nbsp; In turn, they can help their parents better appreciate the need for Total Defence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My encounters with new citizens have generally been very positive.&nbsp; I bring many of them to visit the BMTC, together with their parents. However, they may have a limited understanding of NS, and this is not their fault, as they may not have family members who have done NS.&nbsp; MINDEF, therefore, organises visits for new citizen pre-enlistees and their families to different camps, especially BMTC, and these&nbsp;have allowed these new citizens and their parents to transit smoothly into military life even before enlistment.&nbsp; The common NS experience also serves to bond our new citizens with other Singaporeans and to Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ang recently invited MINDEF to engage a group of new citizens on Total Defence and NS at a citizenship award&nbsp;ceremony organised&nbsp;at the Bukit Gombak constituency.&nbsp; I thank him for that.&nbsp; Our joint efforts were well-received and we will explore Mr Ang's suggestion to make this a regular feature. He also suggested that we should screen some Total Defence videos at some of these citizenship award ceremonies. We will&nbsp;take up his idea and discuss it with the relevant agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Ms Indranee Rajah also asked about MINDEF's efforts to recognise the positive contributions of national servicemen.&nbsp; Our national servicemen have been steadfast in answering the call of duty.&nbsp; In a survey of national servicemen conducted last year, more than 90% of them indicated that they will defend Singapore if it should come under threat and attack, and that they will fight to risk their lives to&nbsp;ensure the survival of Singapore.&nbsp; For their dedication and sacrifices, we are deeply grateful.&nbsp; This year, our national servicemen will be receiving an additional allocation of $100 as part of the Growth Dividends package.&nbsp; For our NS key command and staff appointment holders, who shoulder greater leadership responsibilities and do a longer tour of duty, we have recognised their contribution by raising their NSmen tax relief by $2,000 in 2006 and their annual allowances by 20% in 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But our recognition goes beyond just monetary rewards.&nbsp; In 2006, RECORD IV had recommended that MINDEF highlight the positive aspects of a serviceman's performance and qualities that are useful in the workplace where he works.&nbsp; MINDEF is thus informing employers about the key achievements of their NSmen employees to highlight relevant skills from NS that are applicable to their companies.&nbsp; This is particularly helpful for&nbsp;the key&nbsp;appointment holders who hold leadership positions and greater responsibilities.&nbsp; MINDEF also highlights to employers the achievements of their employees who have performed well during In-Camp Training or have won awards, such as NSmen of the Year and National Day Awards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, MINDEF has also enhanced the Certificate of Service (COS) given to our servicemen when they complete their full-time NS.&nbsp; In the past, the COS only contained basic information about a serviceman's vocation and his grades in conduct and performance.&nbsp; The new redesigned COS now includes a qualitative write-up that highlights the serviceman's key achievements and provides employers with an insight into his qualities.&nbsp; The transcript also lists the courses that he has attended and the appointments he has held. Take, for&nbsp;example,&nbsp;LTA Joshua Chao, who was the Deputy Manpower Officer of 1st Guards Battalion.&nbsp; With the enhancements to the COS, his potential employers now know that he was one of the top cadets in his Officer Cadet Course and the Manpower Officer Course,&nbsp;ie, he was&nbsp;among the top cadets in the two courses,&nbsp;and that&nbsp;he was instrumental in his battalion passing an HR audit with flying colours.&nbsp; These records will be in the new COS. This&nbsp;enhanced COS, which was rolled out from November last year, will better recognise the contributions of our full-time NSmen and help them when they seek employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to talk about commitment to defence, something which MINDEF commits lots of resources onto it.&nbsp; Public commitment to defence is crucial because National Service is the backbone of the SAF.&nbsp; Although support for National Service remains strong today, it needs to be actively reinforced, as Mr Hawazi Daipi has suggested.&nbsp; The pressures of a competitive global environment can make it difficult for NSmen to balance their career, family and national defence obligations.&nbsp; Our young people must also continue to see themselves as citizens of Singapore, even as we seek to give them a global orientation.&nbsp; Also,&nbsp;more foreigners are&nbsp;living and working here.&nbsp; Together, these changes make it important that we constantly reinforce public commitment towards defending Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, MINDEF aims to reinforce commitment to military defence and support for NS at four levels.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, our soldiers must have personal commitment.&nbsp; They must be willing to \"stay and fight\", have a sense of rootedness towards Singapore, and be confident in our ability to defend ourselves.&nbsp; One key ingredient in developing such personal commitment is to ensure that every serviceman sees the value and meaning of his contributions, so that he is not just \"marking time\".&nbsp; The SAF thus seeks to ensure that all its NSFs doing full-time and NSmen in the in-camp training have a positive NS experience.&nbsp; This is accomplished by giving them meaningful professional development, avenues for personal growth in team and leadership skills, and greater recognition of their NS service, as mentioned earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, family support is critical, because families are what our soldiers are fighting to protect.&nbsp; Last September, the new recruits of Bravo Company, 3rd Singapore Infantry Regiment, had a surprise waiting for them after a rough and tough training session.&nbsp; Their Commanding Officer had arranged for them to receive letters of encouragement from their own family members, whom they had not seen since enlistment.&nbsp; One mother&nbsp;wrote to her son. This was what she said:&nbsp;\"After BMT, you will be moulded to be a tough, strong and well-trained soldier.&nbsp; This is your growing-up stage, son.&nbsp; Keep up the good work!\"&nbsp; This example is a timely reminder that family support is an important bedrock of our soldiers' commitment to defence.&nbsp; Over the next few years, the SAF will strengthen its programmes to reach out to the families of our NSFs and NSmen, which includes inviting our servicemen's families to SAF events, such as parades, ceremonies and Open Houses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, employer support is important.&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah asked how do we engage females who never did NS. She volunteered to do IPPT.&nbsp; But, as a female, she can also do more. For example, she can support her employees and encourage them when they go for their in-camp training.&nbsp; We will step up our engagement of Singapore employers to seek their support for their employees' In-Camp Training by inviting them for training visits.&nbsp; Through the Total Defence Award, employers are also recognised for adopting corporate policies which support NS.&nbsp; One good example&nbsp;I want to highlight, Sir, is CA Safety Technology.&nbsp; This is a&nbsp;small-medium enterprise.&nbsp; CA Safety has a zero-deferment company policy.&nbsp; In other words, if a soldier asks the employer to support him on deferment, the employer says no, go and do your in-camp training. This company also prepares additional cash incentives for employees who pass their Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT).&nbsp; In other words, when they do well, when they get a Gold, SAF will give them a cash reward. But this company goes beyond that. This company also gives them something beyond what we give them.&nbsp; Such employer support ensures that our NSmen are able to fulfil their national defence obligations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, our soldiers draw strength from broad public confidence and support.&nbsp; We undertake many initiatives to build societal support, but I would like to highlight especially our efforts in encouraging our servicemen to actively participate in the community, so as to reinforce the bonds between the soldier and society.&nbsp; One example is LTC S Amudhan from the Air Force, who was active with the Coast2Coast humanitarian group from West Coast GRC.&nbsp; Two years ago, LTC Amudhan went with Coast2Coast to Banda Aceh to help rebuild kindergartens in the devastated town.&nbsp; Such community involvement and interaction are crucial to building societal support for our soldiers and national defence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, commitment to defence and support for NS are critical to the security of our nation.&nbsp; If we can sustain strong public commitment to defence, our potential adversaries will know that if they attack us, they take on not just the SAF, not just the soldiers, but&nbsp;all of us, all Singaporeans.&nbsp; This is the power of Total Defence.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I now come back and answer questions on&nbsp;physical fitness.&nbsp; Mr Arthur Fong asked whether pre-enlistees were aware of the two-month reduction in full-time National Service (NS) for combat-fit pre-enlistees who attain a Silver or Gold standard for their National Physical Fitness Award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINDEF works closely with our junior colleges, polytechnics and ITEs to encourage their students to achieve a high standard of physical fitness.&nbsp; As a result of these efforts, more than 50% of our enlistees in 2007 achieved the high level of physical fitness needed to qualify for the two-month NS reduction.&nbsp; MINDEF will continue working with the schools for further improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Indranee asked what we are doing to improve the fitness of our Servicemen when they go into the civilian sector.&nbsp; The SAF continues to place strong emphasis on physical fitness.&nbsp; Last year, we introduced the IPPT Preparatory Training programme, which helps NSmen keep fit and prepare for their IPPT.&nbsp; Our physical fitness efforts are carried out with strong emphasis on safety.&nbsp; Medical personnel are always on hand to provide assistance in case of emergencies.&nbsp; Unfortunately, despite our precautions, last year, one regular servicemen died of heatstroke while taking the IPPT.&nbsp; To prevent heat related injuries ---</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Prof. Koo, your time is up.&nbsp; I will let you carry on because you have some time for clarifications.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

And there is no need for anyone to feel under any pressure because there are no resolutions to be signed at the end of it all, no common statements to be made.&nbsp; All that one needs to do at an informal meeting is to come and be prepared to share his&nbsp;ideas, and to listen to what other people have to say about his ideas, and for him&nbsp;to listen to other people's ideas.&nbsp; Perhaps he will go back and think about these ideas, and he may be able to come up with a good solution which can be adopted in a more formal setting later on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shangri-La Dialogue is a very good example of that.&nbsp; We had been discussing Malacca Straits security for quite some time, and different views had been expressed by different countries.&nbsp; At one of the Shangri-La Dialogues, the Deputy&nbsp;Prime Minister of Malaysia and Defence Minister, Dato Seri Najib, proposed the idea of Eyes-In-The-Sky, and this fitted in neatly with some of the principles that had been discussed on how we can conduct Malacca Straits Patrols among the littoral states and the user states.&nbsp; And as a result of these proposals and ideas that came up, outside the Shangri-La Dialogue, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore were very quickly able to agree that Eyes-In-The-Sky was a good idea, and we launched it and got that going.&nbsp; So, the informal nature of the Shangri-La Dialogue has helped ideas to be floated, and even to be implemented subsequently.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Chit Chung-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

There are three principles which the littoral states as well as the user states have agreed upon.&nbsp; Firstly, that the primary responsibility for security in the Straits is with the littoral states, but that is primary responsibility and it is not sole responsibility.&nbsp; Secondly, user states have a useful role to play as well as international organisations like the IMO.&nbsp; Thirdly, that whatever steps that are taken have to be respectful of the sovereignty and&nbsp;territorial integrity of the littoral states, and be consistent with international law.&nbsp; So&nbsp;within these principles, contributions by other countries, user states and&nbsp;international organisations, which are not among the littoral states of the Malacca Straits, would certainly be welcomed by us.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Michael Palmer-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

And, hence, we encourage our officers to attend courses in the Command and Staff Colleges, for example, in the surrounding countries.&nbsp; A good example is&nbsp;our officers who have attended the staff courses in Indonesia -&nbsp;SESKO-AD, SESKO-ABRI, SESKO-AU&nbsp;and SESKO-AL.&nbsp; During the tsunami relief operations, we deployed a number of these officers to serve as commanders and liaison officers.&nbsp; Coincidentally, some of them were commanding officers or serving in units which were deployed to Aceh.&nbsp; That provided for a very close working relationship, and for liaison.&nbsp; In fact, some of them found their classmates in the TNI operating in Aceh.&nbsp; And they were able to operate very closely together.&nbsp; So this is one example where the commanders and&nbsp;officers have worked well together.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also encouraging exchanges at the warrant officers' level, and not just at the officers' level.&nbsp; We have started warrant officer exchanges with a number of countries, including surrounding countries and places like US, New Zealand and Australia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the more senior level, there are a number of meetings of senior commanders.&nbsp; We have the ASEAN Chiefs of Defence Force informal meeting that has been going on for some years.&nbsp; And the ASEAN Army, Navy and Air Force Chiefs also meet separately, service by service.&nbsp; These&nbsp;meetings have also&nbsp;been going on for a number of years.&nbsp; In the Asia-Pacific as well, there is a Chief of Defence Force meeting.&nbsp; So there are a number of these types of meetings that are going on which allow not just commanders but also mid-level commanders and even warrant officers to get together.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Chit Chung-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The National Serviceman is&nbsp;the fighting force, but he operates in an ecosystem supported by his employer.&nbsp; So when the NSman goes for in-camp training, the employer should say, \"Go, don't ask for deferment, and work hard there.\"&nbsp; As a wife, when the husband goes for in-camp training, she has to shoulder&nbsp;responsibility of looking after the whole family.&nbsp; Usually, in a household, the husband will have some role.&nbsp; For me, when I was an NSman, I drove my children around.&nbsp; But in the absence of the husband, the wife has to take over.&nbsp; That is part of National Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I conduct orientation programmes for new citizens at the PMTC, and the mothers always come along.&nbsp; The mothers are part of the Total Defence team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Talking about social defence and economic defence, we find that, in many cases, the men are the breadwinners, and the woman supports the husband who is a National Serviceman in various ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have many NSmen who are self-employed.&nbsp; And when they go for in-camp training, there may be some disruption to their businesses or their jobs.&nbsp; They have no employers.&nbsp; They are the boss.&nbsp; Sometimes, they find it a bit difficult, and that is where the woman comes in.&nbsp; So the woman can play many roles - military, social, economic, civil.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

clearly&nbsp;is opportunity to drive policy changes and to help set the tone for businesses.&nbsp; Examples are more efficient use of energy, like air-conditioning, lighting, elevators, escalators, prevention of leakage and ceiling, especially in older buildings.&nbsp; It is easier to do this for new buildings, but more needs to be done for current buildings as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there&nbsp;incentives for retrofitting of older buildings to achieve energy efficiency?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Recent reports indicated that there are regions in the world that are experiencing serious effects of global warming such as the melting of the ice caps and changes to the weather patterns.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was in Hong Kong and Macau with my students last one week.&nbsp; The locals there shared with us about the changes in their climate as well as regions surrounding them.&nbsp; They have been experiencing an exceptionally cold and a much harsher weather during the last few months.&nbsp; The temperature went up a little when we arrived in Hong Kong and the locals delightfully mentioned that Singaporeans brought warmth to their shores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locally in Singapore, many of the people that I know shared with me that the nights these days are rather cold such that they have not used their air-conditioning system in their homes for the past few months.&nbsp; This has enabled them to save on their utility bills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although much has been discussed about climate change related issues, sometimes I ask myself, what does climate change mean to the local heartlanders.&nbsp; Do they understand what climate change means and how does it impact their lives and daily activities?&nbsp; What must they do to play their part in the process of managing climate change?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a global citizen, I feel that it is important that Singaporeans are aware of their roles and responsibilities on the issues of climate change.&nbsp; How has the Ministry been reaching out to&nbsp;Singaporeans with regard to the issue of climate change and how have Singaporeans been responding to these efforts?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know whether and how this issue of climate change has affected Singaporeans and what is being done to adapt and manage its impact.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The issue of climate change took centre stage at many international and regional forums, such as the Davos meeting, the UN Climate Change Conference in Bali (called the Bali Roadmap), the ASEAN Summit as well as the Inter-Parliamentary Union and Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The European Union has already committed itself to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% from 1990 levels by 2020, regardless of what happens in international negotiations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United Kingdom has also introduced a Climate Change Bill last year. The Climate Change Bill will provide a clear, credible framework to support emission reductions in the UK, in a way which maximises the social and economic benefits and minimises costs.&nbsp; So what I like about the word is \"maximises social and economic benefits and minimises costs\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will put into statute the UK's domestic targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions through domestic and international action by at least 60% by 2050, with an interim target of reducing it by&nbsp;26% to 32%&nbsp;by 2020, against a 1990 baseline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what is Singapore&rsquo;s and ASEAN&rsquo;s response to climate change. What concrete steps can Singapore take to mitigate climate change and reduce our carbon dioxide emissions? Will the Ministry introduce a Climate Change Bill?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth&nbsp;IPCC&nbsp;assessment&nbsp;report listed energy supply, industrial activities and transport sector as the top three CO2 emission activities.&nbsp; In Singapore, power generation, industry and transport account for 51%, 31.7% and 15.8% of fuel consumption in 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that significant inroads have been achieved through our energy efficiency drive for the power generation and industry sector, but I think&nbsp;more can be done for&nbsp;the transport sector. I have proposed a green car COE category before&nbsp;to increase the proportion of green cars on our roads. I hope the Government will introduce measures to encourage our fleet of public buses and taxis to use CNG or biodiesel.</sup></p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em><font>Global Warming</font></em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Seah Kian Peng:</B> Sir, I start from a philosophical point of view.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small, disparate country like ours, there is a softer side to nation-building, a role which mass national celebrations perform -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; National Day parades, countdown parties, and so on.&nbsp; We do not begrudge the thousands, often millions, spent on them.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example,&nbsp;Minister Mentor himself once pointed out that for the price of a night of fireworks, we could have built a new community centre.&nbsp;&nbsp;But who is to say that the few minutes of fireworks cannot generate as much community&nbsp;spirit and bonding as a community centre?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support&nbsp;national celebrations, and&nbsp;I want them to go on, but in a different, more thoughtful way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In many major events, there is a lot of wastage&nbsp;and not enough thought is given to being eco-friendly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the countdown party at the Esplanade - the many white plastic balloons floating on the bay containing wishes.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the point of&nbsp;this?&nbsp; Can we not have something&nbsp;which is friendlier to the environment?&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not wishes written on leaves?&nbsp; Why not on&nbsp;pieces of&nbsp;bread?&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe not,&nbsp;but certainly something more biodegradable than&nbsp;plastic balloons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course we cannot eliminate waste totally, but it would be good if such factors come in high on the list of considerations on the organiser's mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, can we have an independent commission to review what is needed to make sure that national celebrations and large scale events follow a certain standard operating procedure that minimises the impact on the environment?&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this is a complex task which will likely take some time. I hope the Minister will consider this idea seriously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me suggest something&nbsp;on a smaller scale, something we can do immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can we turn down our air-conditioning?&nbsp; In Japan, the land of the suited salary men, a climate change has begun.&nbsp; Every summer, it runs a \"Cool Biz\" campaign.&nbsp; Everyone who works in an air conditioned office should not have to wear suits and ties, even Ministers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Koizumi, the Japan's Prime Minister at that point in time, took the lead - he wore Hawaiian shirts even in public appearances.&nbsp; The temperatures for their air-conditioners are set at 28 degrees Celsius.&nbsp; This is at least six degrees higher than some office buildings here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, somehow, over the years our office temperatures are so low that we can wear the autumn and the winter collections of many fashion houses here.&nbsp; This is really quite ridiculous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen photographs of our first Cabinet walking from City Hall to Parliament House.&nbsp; None of the Ministers wore a tie.&nbsp; Of course, they were all dressed in white, as a political statement, not as a matter of keeping cool, but, nonetheless, what worked for&nbsp;them could work for us&nbsp;as well.&nbsp;Even in this House, many Members have&nbsp;to put on jackets not because it is a fashion statement, and I must say everyone who had to put on looks good.&nbsp; But, seriously, I believe many of them put on the jackets simply to keep themselves warm.&nbsp; We should&nbsp;all remember that we are part of the tropics and aside from the occasions when we need to be formal, there is no need to wear jackets.&nbsp; The Catholic nuns who work in the tropics, they have different habits which are&nbsp;practical and&nbsp;cool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surely, we can be more flexible.&nbsp; So why not increase the temperatures so that it is cool enough to work, but warm enough to do without jackets and sweaters.&nbsp; I have been to several offices - public sector and private - and&nbsp;observe many people having to put on jackets, sweaters and even shawls.&nbsp; Such observations are not lost on many of my overseas friends and guests and they are from the cold wintry countries like Sweden and New Zealand.&nbsp; All of them, without fail,&nbsp;tell me that our buildings are too cold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 2004 study by Cornell University in the US showed that warmer workers worked better.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the temperature was raised from 19&nbsp; degrees to 25 degrees Celsius, typing errors fell by 44% and the output jumped by 150% -&nbsp;talk about productivity!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our NEA has said that air-conditioners currently account for 40% to 50% of the electricity bills in commercial buildings.&nbsp;&nbsp; If temperature is raised by just 1 degree Celsius, air-conditioning bill comes down by 3%.&nbsp;&nbsp; And what is 3%?&nbsp; A cool $20 million to&nbsp;$26 million a year if all companies did it,&nbsp;enough to more than cover the bills of several fireworks displays.&nbsp; More importantly, it reduces carbon emissions significantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The BCA says that the ideal temperature should be set at 22.5 to 25 degrees Celsius.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do&nbsp;they not go at 24 or&nbsp;25 degrees?&nbsp; Turning down the air-condition is the first and easy step.&nbsp; I hope that the public sector can and should take the lead.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us&nbsp;start the Cool Singapore Campaign now.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

(a) establishing a new programme office for renewable energy.&nbsp; As to be a new energy hub or a centre for renewable energy, Singapore needs to have a holistic strategy to attract renewable energy&nbsp;technology companies to Singapore.&nbsp; Included in the strategy should be incentives like feed-in tariffs,&nbsp; net metering and other incentives for these companies to want to test bed, showcase and set up their businesses in Singapore;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) coordinating all R&amp;D in renewable energy being done by various institutions.&nbsp; I believe all institutions are working independently and I am sure there are overlaps and therefore an inefficient use of manpower and energy;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) providing a master plan and roadmap for renewable energy and energy efficiency so that the private sector can understand and therefore react and partner MEWR&nbsp;in this masterplan; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

They launched a website - www.minusplastic.use.sg - as part of their final year project.&nbsp; It contains information about reducing the use of plastic, packaged in a very unique way for different groups of people whether you are an everyday&nbsp;chap, a professional star&nbsp;or an earth warrior, it has something for everyone.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second project was&nbsp;by a group of&nbsp;National University of Singapore students known as SAVE - Students Against Violation of the Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;They launched a programme known as Rebate to Earth where plastic bags will cost 10 cents from 4th of February onwards at the NUS Co-op.&nbsp; I believe that young people have in them that daring attitude and the ingeniousness to do something good, not only for themselves, but also for their communities and for our planet.&nbsp; The youths of today have become more and more compelled to engage in&nbsp;new forms of action and activism that can generate effective responses&nbsp;to the ecological challenges that face us both today and in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask how the Ministry intends to help all partner, young groups who are interested in the environment and leverage on the ingenuity of these projects to better educate Singaporeans about saving our environment.&nbsp; For example, the NEA could provide a link on their website to these initiatives so as to help these groups share their ideas and help to educate other Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, households account for close to a fifth of their electricity consumed in Singapore because households consume a considerable amount of energy used.&nbsp; We should look to ways in which they can become more energy-efficient.&nbsp; And, here, I echo the sentiments of the hon. Member Dr Faishal Ibrahim.&nbsp; From switching off water heaters when not in use, choosing the economy mode for washing machines when doing laundry, taking showers instead of baths, to switching off lights&nbsp;and appliances when not needed - all simple ways in which Singaporeans can be encouraged to be more energy-efficient.&nbsp; I would like to ask what programmes the Ministry has in place to reach out to these households and whether the Ministry intends to go door-to-door to drive home this message.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is imperative that we engage and encourage Singaporeans to believe in the concept of energy efficiency because it will take the effort of each and every Singaporean, no matter how small, to make Singapore become more energy-efficient.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Alvin Yeo (Hong Kah)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>To Adopt Plant-wide Portfolio Approach on CO2 Emissions</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Alvin Yeo (Hong Kah):</B> Sir, our national energy policy seeks to address the objectives of energy security, economic competitiveness and the protection of the environment.&nbsp; The need to balance often competing concerns, calls for flexibility of approach on the part of the various agencies involved, including the&nbsp;National Environment Agency (NEA).&nbsp; I should disclose my interest as an independent Director of Tuas Power, presently a subsidiary of Temasek Holdings but in the process of being divested.&nbsp; Tuas Power has an interest in the matters to be discussed as a significant player in the power generation sector.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At present, Singapore's electricity is generated primarily for natural gas, around 80%, which is amongst the highest dependency on gas in the world.&nbsp; With rising oil prices, oil-fired power plants are no longer competitive.&nbsp; While the move to diversify to liquefied natural gas (LNG) goes some way to addressing this issue,&nbsp;Singapore's fuel mix is still much less diversified compared to the global average.&nbsp; Given our heavy dependency on gas imports, we are extremely vulnerable to supply disruption and price escalation due to political tension and natural disasters in our neighbouring producing countries. Our economic growth can also be undermined by rising energy prices.&nbsp; We need to further diversify energy sources to buffer us against disruption, price increases and other threats to our supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are limited options in our drive for diversification.&nbsp; Hydro geothermal and wind power are not feasible in Singapore while nuclear energy brings its own problems.&nbsp; Solar power is potential but its contribution is limited.&nbsp; The only other viable alternative fuel source is coal which constitutes about 40% of diversified power around the world and is substantially cheaper than gas or oil.&nbsp; The main issue, however, surrounding the use of coal lies in the CO2 or carbon dioxide emissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the most advanced ultra super critical plant today in the world has a CO2 emission rate of about 790 grams per kilowatt hour.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is in excess of NEA's standard of 730 grams per kilowatt hour.&nbsp; However, that standard is on a per unit basis, that is, for each generating unit.&nbsp; Without detracting from the need to protect the environment, we need to consider if there are other ways to manage the differing concerns.&nbsp; One way is to adopt the portfolio approach to CO2 emissions whereby a power station has access on the overall rate of emissions taking into account the rate of emission of each generating unit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate, a power station might have one unit of co-plant with the CO2 emission rate of about 800 grams per kilowatt hour and two units of gas-fired combined cycle plant with the CO2 emission of about 400 grams per kilowatt hour.&nbsp; The combined emission rate would work out to significantly less than the emission standard of 730 grams per kilowatt hour.&nbsp; So the coal unit on its own would not.&nbsp; The plant-wide&nbsp;portfolio approach on CO2 emission is being practised in countries like Japan.&nbsp; A utility company, such as J Powers'&nbsp;16,000 megawatt capacity, comprising 50% coal-plant and 50% hydro-plant,&nbsp;their plant-wide CO2 emission rate is 720 grams per kilowatt hour which would meet NEA's standard but, on its own,&nbsp;its coal-plant portion would not meet it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of coal will complement gas and LNG and enhance Singapore's energy security and competitiveness.&nbsp; Modern coal plants have incorporated features to reduce pollutants with the exception that its carbon intensity is higher than coal-fired plants.&nbsp; However, this would be addressed by the adoption of a portfolio approach to CO2 emissions, keeping emissions within overall allowable limits.&nbsp; It is hoped that NEA will consider this approach to allow Singapore to secure its energy supply, bring down the cost of electricity and still protect the environment.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>No Green Light</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Miss Penny Low:</B> Sir, given the large amounts&nbsp;of carbon emissions from Asia and our success at attracting the mega green players, both the opportunities and challenges are at our doorstep.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):</B> Sir, first of all, I would like to thank Ms Lee Bee Wah and Members for their questions and suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both my colleague, Dr Amy Khor, and I will try to warm up the rather cold Chamber.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is small and densely populated. &nbsp;To sustain our economic growth, social progress and our quality of life,&nbsp;development has to go hand-in-hand with efforts to preserve our environment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The challenge we face today is to achieve environmental sustainability over&nbsp;the long term.&nbsp; In other words, how can we ensure that Singaporeans will continue to enjoy&nbsp;clean air, clean water and clean land many years down the road?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a firm foundation.&nbsp; So far, we have made economic progress without compromising our environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, today, enjoys a clean and healthy living environment that is internationally recognised.&nbsp; We have consistently fared well in the PERC surveys on perceptions of the environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Our ambient air quality is good compared&nbsp;with that in the major cities of the world, despite our being a densely populated city state with industrial centres within our city boundaries.&nbsp; For water, we take a long-term view to ensure that we will always have sufficient, reliable and diversified water supply.&nbsp; We have steadily invested infrastructure, such as the Marina Reservoir and Deep Tunnel Sewerage System, and have also been encouraging water conservation.&nbsp; For waste, we have created a sustainable waste management system for land-scarce Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will speak more on these initiatives later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Lee Bee Wah asked about our Masterplan to tackle environmental issues.&nbsp; Environmental sustainability will remain a key priority for Singapore with our growing population and economy.&nbsp; As announced by the Prime Minister in January this year,&nbsp;the Minister for National Development and I co-chair an Inter-Ministerial Committee to develop holistic strategies towards sustainable development for Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp; Minister Mah has earlier outlined to the House of the work to be undertaken by the Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sustainable development means we must continue to achieve good environmental performance while not undermining economic growth and competitiveness.&nbsp; As Ms Jessica Tan and Dr Lily Neo have suggested, we must take steps to achieve greater efficiency in resources, such as water, energy and land.&nbsp; This will make our business and economy more competitive and at the same time reduce wastage of environmental resources.&nbsp; It also allows Singapore to play our part as a responsible global citizen to contribute to collective efforts to tackle environmental challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many cities are grappling with environmental challenges, such as pollution from industries and vehicles and the difficulty of finding suitable land for waste disposal.&nbsp; The resultant need for solutions has produced a burgeoning global environment&nbsp;and water industry.&nbsp; With Singapore's good track record, we have a headstart to build up a vibrant environment and water sector.&nbsp; In fact, efforts to do so are already well underway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for example, the water sector, where our achievements in water management and developing NEWater have attracted international attention.&nbsp; Building on this, our cluster development efforts have enabled us to build up a thriving eco-system of water companies and helped our local companies to expand overseas.&nbsp; To add to our competitive age, we have an ongoing research programme in Clean Water and I am confident that our investments will pay off in terms of new value-add to our GDP and jobs.&nbsp; I will touch more on these efforts in&nbsp;a later cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, EDB is spearheading the development of the local Clean Energy sector by categorising R&amp;D and test-bedding of photovoltaic technologies for harnessing solar energy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, aside from water and clean energy, there is a large and growing market for other environmental technologies.&nbsp; My Ministry is therefore also looking at other potential areas where we can build up our capabilities and leverage on existing strengths to develop Singapore into a hub for environmental sustainability solutions and technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Miss Penny Low has mentioned, the demand-side actions are also important.&nbsp; I would like to assure her that my Ministry will continue to engage both households and businesses to encourage the adoption of environmentally friendly actions and habits as a way of life.&nbsp; And these include energy efficiency, recycling and water conservation, just to name a few.&nbsp; Again, I will elaborate more on these areas later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, even as we work to capitalise on the economic opportunities, we must bear in mind that environmental sustainability is ultimately about handing over to our future generations a high quality environment, ideally even better than what we enjoy today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has a part to play and we want every Singaporean to make an effort to&nbsp;care for and protect the environment.&nbsp; To reinforce this message, we launched Clean and Green Singapore last year to replace the Clean and Green Week so that there are now activities throughout the year to encourage Singaporeans to adopt environmentally friendly actions and habits.&nbsp; For instance, we agree fully with Mr Seah Kian Peng that large scale events should be organised in a manner that minimises the impact on the environment.&nbsp; And we will continue to engage the 3P sector to do more in this area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I will now touch on some of the specific initiatives that my Ministry is embarking on to ensure environmental sustainability for Singapore, starting&nbsp;with climate change and energy efficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climate change is a serious threat which&nbsp;has to be addressed collectively by all countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was recognised at the&nbsp;United Nations Framework&nbsp;Convention on Climate Change meeting held in&nbsp;Bali in December last year.&nbsp; At the same time, any international framework on climate change has to take into account the national circumstances of different countries and recognise the need to balance environmental sustainability and economic growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain developed countries are taking the lead in addressing climate change.&nbsp; For example, as Dr Lim Wee Kiak noted, the UK has introduced&nbsp;a Climate Change&nbsp;Bill in 2007 to provide</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>a framework for their domestic climate change response.&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is committed to play its part in the global effort to address climate change as well, but we will adopt a practical approach, as captured in Singapore&rsquo;s National Climate Change Strategy (NCCS).&nbsp; It is now available online, launched this morning by SPS Dr Amy Khor,&nbsp;after extensive consultations with our key stakeholders, including private companies, academics and youths.&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCCS sets out our efforts to better understand Singapore&rsquo;s vulnerabilities to climate change and the adaptation measures required.&nbsp; It documents how we are mitigating our greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to international efforts addressing climate change.&nbsp; As our understanding of climate change grows, technology advances and competencies develop, our policies and measures will evolve and improve, and the NCCS will be updated in tandem.&nbsp; Sir, at this point in time, we do not see a need for a Bill.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">5.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Muhammad Faishal asked about the implications of climate change on Singapore.&nbsp; We know that some potential climate change impact water resources and flooding.&nbsp; As a result of our policies in the past, we have existing measures that help to address some of these impacts.&nbsp; For example, since 1991, we have required new reclamation projects to be built at 125 centimetres above the highest recorded known tide level.&nbsp; PUB was a bit <I>kiasu</I> at that time.&nbsp; But this is well above the maximum sea level rise of 59 centimetres by 2100 predicted by the 4th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, some of the past and ongoing programmes that PUB has undertaken will put us in good stead in the face of uncertainties from climate change.&nbsp; We have developed NEWater and desalination, both of which are not dependent on rainfall, to diversify our water supply and increase its resilience.&nbsp; Other initiatives in drainage and flood alleviation will also address potential challenges from rising sea levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, Sir, we need to continue improving our understanding of climate change effects and impacts.&nbsp; I announced last year that NEA had commissioned a two-year study to better understand specific implications of climate change on Singapore.&nbsp; These include sea level and temperature changes, flooding and coastal erosion.&nbsp; This study, when completed in 2009, will help us to assess what more we need to do to adapt to climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like water, energy is a scarce resource that we must conserve and use as efficiently as we can.&nbsp; We must also take steps to mitigate the potential environmental impact of the increased demand for energy from faster economic and population growth.&nbsp; To mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions, energy efficiency is our key strategy.&nbsp; Such measures will also increase our national resilience to the global uncertainties of energy supply and price.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of us, whether an&nbsp;individual or&nbsp;organisation, has a role to play in conserving energy.&nbsp; The International Energy Agency estimates that unexploited energy efficiency potentially offers the single largest opportunity for emission reductions across all economies, accounting for between 30% and 50% of carbon dioxide&nbsp;emission reductions by 2050.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Energy efficiency is not just a sound climate change policy.&nbsp; It also promises significant benefits for consumers, companies and the economy at large.&nbsp;&nbsp;For consumers and families, improving efficiency and avoiding waste mean using less electricity at home and less petrol for driving.&nbsp; This translates into lower utility and transport bills.&nbsp;&nbsp;With oil hitting US$100 a barrel, the impact of energy efficiency to the bottom line of businesses is certainly not trivial.&nbsp; By increasing the energy efficiency of their business operations, companies combine both environmental responsibility and business profitability.&nbsp; For the economy, more efficient use of energy reduces energy demand and lowers the need to import fuels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, the uptake of efficiency measures is often slow, largely because of the lack of information about the available options, capital constraints and slow turnover of old capital stock.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where these barriers exist, the Government has a role in providing targeted incentives, information and standards, to help trigger wider deployment, lower costs, and encourage innovation.&nbsp; Other countries and cities, such as New York,&nbsp;have recognised this.&nbsp; Singapore should do no less to capture the benefits of energy efficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NEA set up the inter-agency Energy Efficiency Programme Office (E2PO) in May 2007, to identify and implement measures to improve Singapore&rsquo;s energy efficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area is the public sector, as Mr Seah Kian Peng has mentioned.&nbsp; The Government will continue to take the lead to improve its energy efficiency and influence wider action. &nbsp;I announced last year that all large air-conditioned Government office buildings, as well as polytechnics and ITEs, will conduct energy audits to improve their energy efficiency by March 2010.&nbsp; As of end 2007, eight such buildings have completed their audits and adopted energy-saving measures, such as optimising air-conditioning and improving lighting efficiency.&nbsp; $2.6 million in total annual savings was achieved.&nbsp; Another six public sector buildings are in the process of implementing energy saving measures, and the remaining 40 buildings will complete their audits within the next two years.&nbsp; In addition, for public sector buildings with over 15,000 square metres of air-conditioned Gross Floor Area, we will progressively introduce minimum efficiency performance standards for our central air-conditioning plants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To kick-start further efforts to promote greater energy efficiency in the private and people sectors, E2PO launched an Energy Efficiency plan (E2 Singapore) to coordinate energy efficiency programmes in all the main sectors of energy use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Lim Wee Kiak, Dr Lily Neo and Ms Eunice Olsen have asked how we will drive the energy efficiency improvements in Singapore.&nbsp; During the Budget debate, MPs, including Dr Teo Ho Pin, Ms Jessica Tan, Miss Penny Low and Mr Gautam Banerjee mentioned the need for more green initiatives.&nbsp; I welcome their suggestions.&nbsp; So I am pleased to announce that, for a start, a Sustainable Energy Fund of $50 million over five years has been established to build competency in energy management and support the programmes under E2 Singapore.&nbsp; A targeted sectoral approach will be taken to improve energy efficiency across the economy.&nbsp; Let me take each sector one by one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturing industries account for a significant share of energy use in Singapore. &nbsp;Regardless of their products, industrial facilities have to be designed to be efficient right from the start and to use efficient equipment. &nbsp;They should also have trained personnel who recognise the opportunities for improving energy efficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to help new industrial facilities incorporate energy efficiency considerations at the design stage, NEA will introduce a Design for Efficiency scheme. &nbsp;This pilot scheme will co-fund design workshops for new industrial developments to meet the high standards of energy efficiency.&nbsp; Texas Instruments (TI) in the USA, for example, was able to design an extremely efficient wafer chip factory through similar workshops.&nbsp; It was estimated that their new factory will use 20% less electricity and 35% less water as compared to their wafer chip factories built previously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also encourage industries to adopt energy-efficient technologies and equipment.&nbsp; Currently, NEA administers the Energy Efficiency Improvement Assistance Scheme to co-fund energy audits for companies.&nbsp; As of end January 2008, 87 manufacturing facilities and buildings have identified energy efficiency measures which will result in $23 million in annual energy savings.&nbsp; To further encourage our companies, NEA will establish a Grant for Energy Efficient Technology.&nbsp; This grant, which is&nbsp;known as GREET, will provide funding for companies to offset part of their investment cost for energy-efficient equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, NEA will provide a Singapore Certified Energy Manager Training Grant to help equip facility owners and technical staff with the necessary knowledge and skills to manage energy services within their facilities.&nbsp; We will also study the feasibility of making the appointment of energy managers mandatory for large manufacturing and building facilities in the next three to five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Alvin Yeo suggested having greater flexibility in the approval of power plants by considering CO2 emissions, not&nbsp;just on&nbsp;per power plant basis, but also on an overall portfolio-wide basis.&nbsp;&nbsp; The power generation sector currently accounts for about 50% of Singapore's CO2 emissions.&nbsp; To support the increased demand for electricity from a growing population and economy, my Ministry is working with the economic agencies to study commercially viable options to increase our power generation capacity. &nbsp;With increasing global concerns over CO2 emissions that lead to climate change, one of the key considerations will also be how capacity can be increased in an environmentally sustainable manner which is not regressive for our efforts to mitigate carbon emissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have successfully balanced between economic growth, energy security and environmental sustainability considerations in the past.&nbsp; For instance, through the greater use of efficient combined-cycle generation technology, overall power generation efficiency has increased from 37% to 44% from 2000 to 2007.&nbsp; In addition, the proportion of electricity generated by natural gas in Singapore increased from 19% to 79% over the same period.&nbsp; These contributed significantly to the reduction in carbon intensity or CO2 per dollar GDP in 2006, to about 30% below 1990 levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we will continue to explore all options to balance between the various considerations, including Mr Yeo's suggestion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the buildings sector, we will continue to work with BCA to encourage the development and construction of energy-efficient buildings.&nbsp; BCA plans to introduce mandatory standards for new buildings equivalent to the Green Mark standard from April 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise that the existing stock of buildings is far greater than the number of new buildings coming up. &nbsp;Steps have to be taken to improve the energy efficiency of these existing buildings.&nbsp; MOS Grace Fu mentioned earlier that BCA is developing a grant to encourage the upgrading of building envelopes of existing buildings to improve the overall building energy efficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, NEA and the Energy Sustainability Unit of the National University of Singapore launched the EnergySmart Building Labelling Scheme in 2005 for office buildings.&nbsp; EnergySmart recognises the top 25 percentile of buildings in terms of energy efficiency and indoor air quality.&nbsp; In August 2007, the scheme was extended to hotels.&nbsp; By recognising hotels which perform best in energy efficiency, we hope to motivate other hotels to also invest in energy-efficient equipment to lower their operational costs and attract environmentally-conscious travellers.&nbsp; The Regent Singapore is one of our EnergySmart hotels.&nbsp; It adopted various energy efficiency measures, such as using energy-efficient lighting and optimising its airconditioning system.&nbsp; Through these measures, the hotel achieved a 26% reduction in electricity consumption while providing the same level of comfort to its guests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all of us contribute to global warming and climate change through energy consumption which increases greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp; So, we can all make a difference, by making energy-efficient choices at home, at work and in our choice of transport.&nbsp; Dr Lim Wee Kiak pointed out that, according to the Fourth Assessment Report released by the IPCC, the transport sector was responsible for 23% of the world energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in 2004.&nbsp; In Singapore, the transport sector accounted for about 19% of our CO2 emissions in 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is scope to improve the energy efficiency of the transport sector.&nbsp; For densely populated and land-scarce Singapore, public transport is the most energy-efficient form of transport.&nbsp; The Ministry of Transport has announced a target to improve the share of&nbsp;commuters using public transport during morning peak hours from 63% in 2004 to 70% by 2020.&nbsp; Vehicle population and usage demand measures will also continue to feature in our land transport policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help drivers choose more fuel-efficient vehicles, the Government will introduce mandatory fuel economy labelling for passenger cars from 1st April 2009.&nbsp; All automobile retailers will have to display the fuel economy labels of passenger car models at the showroom.&nbsp; Fuel economy information will also be made available on the NEA website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, for electrical appliances, airconditioners and refrigerators in stores now carry the energy label.&nbsp; The Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme will be extended to clothes dryers by April 2009.&nbsp; We will consider extending the scheme to other appliances, including household lightings and water heaters by 2010.&nbsp; Going forward, we will also look into imposing Minimum Energy Performance Standards on household airconditioners and fridges over the next two to three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Northwest CDC launched a month-long North West Green Festival in July last year to create greater awareness of environmental issues, including energy conservation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several companies have also participated in initiatives to save energy. Philips Electronics Singapore partnered South West CDC to sponsor energy-efficient light bulbs to be installed free of charge in 2,000 low-income households.&nbsp; Ricoh Asia Pacific partnered the Singapore Environment Council to launch Eco Action 2007 on World Environment Day in 2007, where 15 organisations pledged to take actions to reduce their energy consumption, saving about 8,000kWh or $1,500 in electricity bills in total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These community-led and industry-led initiatives are important steps in the journey to improve our energy efficiency.&nbsp; To further motivate Singaporeans to conserve energy, I am glad to inform Mr Seah Kian Peng, Dr Lily Neo,&nbsp;Ms Eunice Olsen and the House that NEA will be launching a national campaign to help households save energy through various avenues.&nbsp; This campaign will include teaching residents how they can save both electricity and money, by making simple changes in their daily habits like raising the air-conditioning temperature to 25 degrees&nbsp;and careful selection of energy-efficient appliances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our energy efficiency initiatives under E2 Singapore will promote environmental sustainability and contribute to economic growth.&nbsp; I urge Singaporeans to make energy-efficient choices in their daily lives, and play a role in making us an energy-efficient Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Mr Edwin Khew and Ms Jessica Tan asked how we are developing Singapore into a centre for clean energy solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is taking an active role in driving Clean Energy R&amp;D investment and test-bedding, as part of an integrated strategy comprising technology development, cluster development and internationalisation.&nbsp; The Clean Energy Programme Office (CEPO),&nbsp;not renewable energy programme office,&nbsp;led by EDB and in partnership with agencies, such as NEA, has been set up to drive efforts in this area.&nbsp; CEPO has launched comprehensive research and test-bedding programmes on clean energy.&nbsp; These include $170 million from the National Research Foundation for fuel cell and solar R&amp;D, as well as a $17 million Clean Energy Research&nbsp;and Test-bedding Platform&nbsp;(CERT), to test-bed solar photovoltaic technologies.&nbsp; The PUB's&nbsp;Marina Barrage will be among the first batch of test-bedding sites under the CERT programme.&nbsp; The Ministry of&nbsp; Trade and Industry will elaborate more on this topic during their COS discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Edwin Khew also asked how climate change strategies will dovetail with the aspirations espoused in the ASEAN Declaration on Environmental Sustainability and the Singapore Declaration on Climate Change, Energy and the Environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 2007, ASEAN adopted these Declarations, demonstrating the region's shared commitment towards environmental protection and conservation.&nbsp; Our initiatives in sustainable development will contribute towards this regional effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Declarations re-affirmed the need to take an effective approach to the interrelated challenges of climate change, energy security and other environmental and health issues. Leaders also called for intensification of on-going cooperation to improve energy efficiency and the use of cleaner energy, including the use of renewable and alternative sources.&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore's&nbsp;drive towards energy efficiency and clean energy will enable us to play our part, and share our experiences with other countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, ASEAN Leaders agreed to encourage efforts to develop a climate change initiative to further strengthen regional cooperation in responding to climate change, and to undertake concrete actions to respond to its adverse impacts.&nbsp; For instance, we could share information on the vulnerabilities and impacts of climate change, and harness regional expertise for a more concerted action at the regional level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore will actively pursue opportunities for collaborating with our ASEAN partners on how the region can leverage on energy efficiency initiatives and clean energy to help mitigate the impacts of climate change.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Mr Charles Chong&nbsp;and Mr Chiam See Tong&nbsp;are not present.&nbsp; Mr Edwin Khew.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Er Edwin Khew Teck Fook-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Clean Energy Vehicles</em>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Er Edwin Khew Teck Fook:</B> Sir, I would like to applaud the Minister and the NEA for ensuring that Singapore's air quality is one of the best in the world. This is one major compelling reason why many foreign companies decide to invest in Singapore and to move their staff and families here.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Singapore can still improve on its air quality standards from three major sources.&nbsp; One, motor vehicles. Two, stationary sources which include manufacturing, gencos, etc.&nbsp; And, three, haze from cross-border sources.&nbsp; I believe much has been done to control and improve on air pollution caused by stationary sources and on mitigating cross-border haze by working closely with Indonesia and particularly with Riau.&nbsp; I would therefore like to focus on pollution caused by motor vehicles and the Ministry's policies and strategies to address this sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like the Minister to clarify; one, what is MEWR&nbsp;doing to encourage more green vehicles, hybrid CNG and Euro IV or V vehicles on our roads? Two, why is the tax levy on private diesel cars&nbsp;still necessary when Euro V diesel engines are less pollutive and more efficient compared to petrol-driven cars? I believe the thermal efficiency of diesel engines nowadays are 30% better than petrol engines. And this is the reason why 50% of all car sales in Europe today are diesel engine cars.&nbsp; This has helped Europe cap the consumption of fuel&nbsp;in cars. Three, why can the Government not provide more incentives for CNG dispensing stations to be built&nbsp; as this is a chicken-and-egg problem and needs to be resolved? With the high cost of petrol and the advantage of a cleaner environment from using CNG, it will make good sense for the Government to invest in providing this infrastructure. Four, why do parking charges for Euro IV truck cost more than an Euro III or IV truck of the same dimension?&nbsp; I believe trucks are charged based on their gross&nbsp;weight and not their size.&nbsp; Why are we penalising or disincentivising companies who are going green?&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the extra weight is because of the catalytic converter required by the Euro IV or V engines.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Recycling</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak:</B> Sir, one of the key initiatives for mitigating climate change is to encourage, reduce, reuse and recycle.&nbsp; I would like to congratulate the Ministry of the Environment for the good progress we have made in our recycling efforts. Under the Singapore Green Plan 2012 launched in 2002, the target is to increase recycling rate from 44% to 60% by 2012 and to achieve zero landfill.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the current status of the Singapore Green Plan?&nbsp; Is 60% a target too low since we have already achieved a recycling rate of over 51% in 2006?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although there are recycling bins distributed in HDB and private estates, the management of these bins is less than desirable. There are many complaints regarding recycling bins being too far away, too full as they are not cleared frequently enough, too dirty and smelly as other organic waste may have been disposed in these bins wrongly. The bins are also frequently raided by <I>karang guni</I> men, resulting in extensive littering around the bins.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the Ministry doing to address these issues? What other measures is the Ministry introducing to increase recycling?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the Government consider incorporation of separate and dedicated recycling rubbish chutes for HDB flats both in new and those undergoing the Home Improvement Programme as well as to encourage private developers to incorporate dedicated recycling rubbish chutes in their new developments?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Environmental Degradation</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</B> Sir, as we&nbsp;know, behind our galloping economy is an enormous amount of resources like electricity and water utilised daily.

Over the festive seasons, where many households spring clean their homes, I was appalled to see many useful things being thrown away&nbsp;&ndash; electrical appliances, clothes, toys, etc.&nbsp; It reflects the excesses of consumerism and the erosion of values, which is thrift and life&nbsp;simplification, in our affluent countries.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I want to congratulate the Ministry for adopting a very sound strategic thrust of waste minimisation, especially at source.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the simple and important 3R message of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle has not taken root amongst Singaporeans yet.&nbsp; Sir, I propose three destinations to which resources can be directed to support this strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, in the school system.&nbsp; Sir, I was very impressed when I stumbled upon a pre-school teacher teaching package in an NEA portal with the learning goal of implementing the 3Rs in schools.&nbsp; However, when my enthusiastic teachers look further for similar teaching resources for children beyond pre-school and tried to invite officers to teach the students, they were disappointed.&nbsp; I would urge the NEA to continue the good work it has started, and extend the 3Rs education initiative to older students beyond pre-school.&nbsp; And please not just for mainstream schools but also special schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, in the Town Council system, I propose that all Town Councils seriously adopt waste minimisation as a key strategy in&nbsp;their yearly workplans and develop some KPIs for tracking and accountability. Ad-hoc efforts with a bin here and a bin there will not create any impact.&nbsp; Education of cleanliness and residents given incentives to recycle and simply providing an X number of bins per block for the recyclable materials are some easy steps to take.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, in Sungei Road, which is on its way&nbsp;to being dubbed the slum in the city, my residents' frustration that the Sungei Road market&nbsp;&ndash; the litter, the unsightliness,&nbsp;unlawful storage of goods, security threats, illegal vendors, etc,&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;have been discussed in this House.&nbsp; However, there is a great opportunity to turn this problem around with a good solution that solidly supports the Ministry's waste minimisation strategy and even provide work opportunities for my needy and elderly residents.&nbsp; First, get rid of the illegal vendors by instituting a restricted licence system.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Lastly, would the Minister give us an update on the Government's recent efforts to reduce smoking among the young?&nbsp; Does the Ministry have an estimate on the number of smokers and, if so, how many of these are young people and teenagers?&nbsp; Are we winning the battle to deter more young from picking up the habit?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):</B> Sir,&nbsp;Singapore's&nbsp;good ambient air quality is one of our competitive advantages in attracting visitors, investments and talents. &nbsp;In 2007, our air quality continued to be good, with the Pollutant Standards Index or PSI in the 'good' range for 95% of the days and in the 'moderate' range for 5% of the days.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our overall ambient air quality as well as the air quality that we have sampled at our roadside monitoring stations is within the USEPA standards but with the exception of very fine particulate matter or PM2.5.&nbsp; In 2007, the ambient level of PM2.5 was 19&mu;g/m3, above the USEPA standard of 15ug/m3.&nbsp; However, with measures such as the adoption of Euro IV standards for new diesel vehicles in October 2006, our target is to meet the USEPA standards by 2014.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, domestically, the main sources of air pollution are our&nbsp;industry and transport. &nbsp;Both Ms Lee Bee Wah and Mdm Ho have noted the potential pollution impact&nbsp;on industries.&nbsp; In Singapore, we adopt a&nbsp;forward-looking&nbsp;approach &nbsp;to minimise this from the onset.&nbsp; All new industrial proposals are referred to the NEA to ensure that sufficient pollution control measures are in place from the start.&nbsp; This screening covers not just air pollution considerations, but also other areas like potential water pollution and noise nuisance.&nbsp; In addition, for major industrial developments, including oil storage terminals, developers are required to carry out pollution control studies to identify potential sources of pollution and implement mitigating measures before the project can proceed.&nbsp; NEA also conducts inspections to ensure that environmental regulations, such as emission limits for particulates and nitrogen oxides, are complied with.&nbsp; A similar approach is adopted for the transport sector, with stringent standards set for vehicular emissions as well as for the fuel used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also provide incentives, Sir, to encourage the take-up of cleaner technologies, for instance, green vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Dr Lim and&nbsp;Mr Edwin Khiew asked about the Government's strategy to encourage green vehicles in Singapore.&nbsp; Sir, besides cost, the take-up rate of green vehicles is affected by factors such as consumer preference and the provision of maintenance support by the car dealers.&nbsp; The demand for&nbsp;green vehicles is therefore best left to the consumers to decide.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this, the Government will introduce the necessary incentives to facilitate consumers and fleet operators to opt for environmentally-friendly vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in 2001, we introduced the Green Vehicle Rebate or GVR scheme to narrow the cost differential between a green vehicle and the conventional equivalent model.&nbsp; The GVR is applicable to hybrid, CNG and electric vehicles, and is available until end 2009. &nbsp;I am heartened by the positive response to the GVR, as the number of green vehicles has increased from about 200 to more than 1,500 in the last two years. Sir, when carrying out the next review of the GVR scheme, my Ministry and the Ministry of Transport, in consultation with the Ministry of Finance, will take into account up-coming developments such as the adoption of&nbsp; the Euro V standards in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Khew has&nbsp;a particular question on the tax levy:&nbsp;why is it necessary on private diesel vehicles when Euro V diesel vehicles are less pollutive?&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, Euro V is still not available in Singapore.&nbsp; It will only be available in Europe in 2012 and, as I mentioned earlier, we will continue to evaluate and review the policy position in respect to cleaner vehicles.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Dr Lim also suggested a separate COE category for green vehicles.&nbsp; I think he knows the answer.&nbsp; My Ministry&nbsp;studied this previously with&nbsp;the Ministry of Transport and concluded it would not be appropriate as demand for green vehicles is best left to the market to decide. &nbsp;It would also be difficult to set a quota for green vehicles.&nbsp; In fact, as with all vehicle categories, their growth would be capped as a result.&nbsp; On the other hand, if green vehicles do not have a separate COE category, their take-up can increase freely in response to demand, which is happening currently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Khew also noted the current limited availability of refuelling facilities for CNG vehicles.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of my Ministry's&nbsp;support for private sector efforts to develop CNG refuelling stations, the NEA has helped companies to co-fund the start-up costs through the Innovation for Environmental Sustainability Fund.&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides SembGas'&nbsp;CNG refuelling station on Jurong Island, NEA will co-fund SMART Automobile Private Ltd's&nbsp;project to set up CNG stations at Mandai and Serangoon North.&nbsp; The Mandai CNG Station is now open.&nbsp; Mr Seng Han Thong and I were&nbsp;present there.&nbsp; And SMART targets to set up the Serangoon North station by the end of this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEA&nbsp;also encourages the private sector to explore dispensing CNG at fuel service stations. SembGas and SPC have since collaborated to retail CNG at SPC's&nbsp;Jalan Buroh service station from February 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,&nbsp;I am hopeful that with these recent developments, more drivers will opt for green vehicles and this, in turn, will improve our air quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate air pollution within Singapore, our air quality is also affected by external factors that are not directly within our control.&nbsp; I think it is important for me to make a response on this issue.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore and the surrounding region generally experience two dry seasons every year, a short one during the February-March period, which we are in now, and a traditionally longer one during the September-October period.&nbsp; So, during the weekend of 22nd to 24th February this year, the PSI in Singapore went slightly into the \"moderate\"&nbsp;range due to weakened north-easterly winds, poor dispersion and the increased number of hotspot activities in Sumatra, mainly in Riau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEA forecasts that the current dry weather may last till March before the inter-monsoon season with increased rainfall from April.&nbsp; The rainfall should help to put out forest fires.&nbsp; Notwithstanding, we must be prepared that Singapore may experience slightly hazy days during this period, especially in situations where prevailing winds become weaker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has been working with Jambi province in Indonesia to help enhance its capacity to prevent land and forest fires there.&nbsp; NEA officers who were in Jambi last week observed only about four to five&nbsp;hotspots.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;I am heartened by Jambi's&nbsp;commitment in mobilising resources quickly to prevent hotspots from starting or escalating over there.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to work with Jambi to implement the mutually-agreed&nbsp;Action Programmes outlined under the Jambi Master Plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from our bilateral efforts, Singapore remains committed to working closely with ASEAN countries under the framework of the regional Transboundary Haze Agreement.&nbsp; Sir, the Bali meeting last year highlighted to the international community the need to protect carbon sinks in the region and thereby to reduce the significant emissions through deforestation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore strongly supports these international initiatives, and Indonesia's&nbsp;leadership in implementing its National Plan of Action to address the haze and its efforts to reduce forest degradation and deforestation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;I would like to assure Members that my Ministry and NEA will continue to review our pollution control measures to ensure that Singaporeans will continue to enjoy clean air.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the issue of the smoking ban.&nbsp; Sir, we extended the smoking prohibition to entertainment outlets in July last year.&nbsp; Since then, there has been a significant improvement in the indoor air quality in pubs and bars, with an 80% reduction in the amount of air-borne particulate matter.&nbsp; These particulate matters have been associated with a higher risk of developing respiratory and cardiovascular problems.&nbsp; We have also received positive feedback from the operators and patrons.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Liang Eng Hwa has asked if we have plans to extend the smoking prohibition to more public areas such as those frequented by children.&nbsp; Sir, I am pleased to inform the House that we will be extending the smoking ban to more areas next year so as to offer greater protection to non-smokers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st January 2009, smoking will be prohibited in all children's&nbsp;playgrounds, exercise areas, markets, underground and multi-storey car parks, ferry terminals and jetties.&nbsp; In addition, smoking is now prohibited in most air-conditioned premises, including offices, factories, shops, shopping complexes and lift lobbies.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will also extend the prohibition from 1st January 2009 to cover such premises which are non-air-conditioned.&nbsp; In the meantime, we are consulting the hotel industry on the possible extension of the smoking prohibition to hotel lobbies.&nbsp; We will also be working with the building owners to prohibit smoking at the entrances and&nbsp;exits of buildings and facilities, as well as the covered walkways abutting buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Liang Eng Hwa has also asked about enforcement action.&nbsp; NEA has since 2009 stepped up its enforcement against the violation of the smoking prohibition.&nbsp; Apart from&nbsp;NEA officers,&nbsp;we have also employed auxiliary police to supplement the enforcement manpower.&nbsp; We will continue to sustain the same level of enforcement when the smoking prohibition is extended to other places from January next year.&nbsp; Should the need arise, we are prepared to step up the enforcement further.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the smoking prohibition forms part of the Government's&nbsp;efforts to discourage smoking among&nbsp;our young.&nbsp; Over the years, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) has also been raising the awareness among young people of the ill effects of smoking.&nbsp; Recalcitrant under-aged smokers are given mandatory counselling, and smoking cessation services are available in all polyclinics and several hospitals.&nbsp; These efforts, Sir, have reduced the proportion of youths aged 13-16 years old who have tried smoking, from 26% in 2000 to 19% in 2006.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan):</B> Sir, as Mr Edwin Khew has rightly pointed out, Singapore is a small island state and does not have the land to continue building more incineration plants and landfills indefinitely for waste disposal.&nbsp; Last year, a total of&nbsp; 2.57 million tons of waste was disposed of, a decrease of about 8% from 2000.&nbsp; This is encouraging given that Singapore's population and economy have grown during this period.&nbsp; The decrease in waste volume is due largely to strategies we have put in place to ensure a sustainable waste management system.&nbsp; As raised by Mr Khew, this is even more pertinent as the population and the economy continue to grow with immigration and projects, like IR, and extend the lifespan of the landfill.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we aim to minimise waste generation at source.&nbsp; Last year, we started a voluntary packaging agreement with the food and beverage industry.&nbsp; This agreement is an industry-led initiative with the objective of reducing the amount of packaging generated by the industry.&nbsp; This agreement has led to encouraging results.&nbsp; For instance, Chinatown Food Corporation has reduced the thickness of plastic packaging for its <I>roti prata</I> and rice ball products, saving about 8.4 tonne of packaging material a year.&nbsp; And the <I>roti prata</I> and rice ball, may I add, still taste the same as before.&nbsp; Similarly, Nestle Singapore has reduced the thickness of its Milo tins and will save about 9.5 tonne of material per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our second strategy is to promote recycling.&nbsp; Sir, on this note, I am pleased to inform Dr Lim Wee Kiak and the House that our overall recycling rate has actually increased to 54% in 2007, up from 40% in 2000.&nbsp; However we need to recycle even more in order to achieve our recycling target of 60% by 2012.&nbsp; For instance, there is still a lot of paper waste, plastic waste and food waste which can be recycled but is still being sent to the incineration plants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked if the Ministry will provide more recycling bins to facilitate recycling.&nbsp; Under our National Recycling Programme, there is fortnightly door-to-door collection of recyclables for residents of both HDB and landed estates.&nbsp; Since August last year, one set of centralised recycling bins has been set up for every&nbsp;five blocks of HDB flats to provide additional recycling facilities for residents.&nbsp; The majority of HDB residents can now recycle waste anytime and will not need to walk more than 150 metres from their blocks to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both&nbsp;Dr Lim and, I think,&nbsp;Mr Liang Eng Hwa have raised the issues of the recycling bin being misused as litter bins, and the collection of recyclables being too infrequent.&nbsp; We urge Singaporeans to be more responsible in the use of recycling bins.&nbsp; The public waste collectors have also increased their collection frequency for high usage recycling bins.&nbsp; Nonetheless, we will continue to work with the stakeholders, including the waste collectors and the community, to build up public awareness and proper recycling behaviour so that the bins are used and maintained properly and not misused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, my Ministry announced that we were exploring the mandatory provision of recycling facilities in condominiums and private apartments.&nbsp; Sir, I would like to inform the House that we will proceed with this plan.&nbsp; Implementation will commence this year and in phases, starting with the larger condominiums and private apartments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lim also asked whether the Government would consider having separate recycling chutes for HDB flats.&nbsp; The NEA has been working with the HDB to pilot test separate chutes for recyclables.&nbsp; The pilot project, which also involves SembEnviro, is carried out at&nbsp;a block of HDB flats in Choa Chu Kang estate.&nbsp; The results have been encouraging.&nbsp; HDB has identified another four new blocks of flats&nbsp;in Sengkang to provide similar separate chutes for recyclables.&nbsp; HDB's eco-precinct, Treelodge@Punggol, will also have separate chutes for recyclables.&nbsp; These chutes will give greater convenience to residents to dispose their recyclable wastes from all floor levels.&nbsp; HDB will study the outcome of these pilot projects before looking into the feasibility of wide-scale implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEA has also been working with the industries to promote the establishment of new recycling infrastructure.&nbsp; For instance, a&nbsp;mechanical waste sorting plant and a food waste recycling plant have been set up and they are currently being commissioned.&nbsp; Several establishments that generate food waste, such as the National University of Singapore, Regent Hotel and Century&nbsp;Square Shopping Centre, have taken the initiative to segregate and recycle their food waste.&nbsp; In addition, I am pleased to inform Mr Edwin Khew that a pilot scheme has been launched to collect food waste from hawker centres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As pointed out by Mdm Ho Geok Choo, education plays a key role too, besides incorporating the importance of the 3Rs&nbsp;&ndash; reduce, reuse, recycle&nbsp;&ndash; in the school curriculum, we had also launched the School Recycling Programme in 2002.&nbsp; This includes the provision of recycling bins in our primary and secondary schools, junior colleges, ITEs and polytechnics.&nbsp; And as Ms Denise Phua rightly&nbsp;pointed out, we have also tailored a recycling programme for younger children attending pre-schools.&nbsp; The Pre-school&nbsp;3R training kit was launched in November 2007 with the PAP Community Foundation and the Presbyterian Community Service.&nbsp; In fact, we have many other programmes for both the primary and secondary schools as well as JCs, including education modules on recycling as well as public health and hygiene.&nbsp; For schools where the students may have&nbsp;different needs, such as Pathlight, NEA will be pleased to work with the teachers to develop environmental programmes for their students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Denise Phua has suggested showcasing 3R efforts at Sungei Road market.&nbsp; Currently, the market is open to locals to peddle secondhand goods and wares.&nbsp; My Ministry is open to evaluating the long-term viability of any initiative which will further promote 3R efforts and which will improve the standards of cleanliness and public health for the neighbourhood.&nbsp; We therefore welcome Ms Denise Phua to share with us the details of her proposal which she did not manage to complete earlier.&nbsp; In the meantime, we will continue to work closely with Ms Phua and&nbsp;her community leaders to minimise any disamenities that may arise from the operation of the Sungei Road market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these efforts will help us move closer towards having a sustainable waste management system.&nbsp; We will include the review of the 60% recycling target under the IMCSD framework, as raised both by Dr Lim as well as Mr Edwin Khew.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In 2005, we witnessed our largest outbreak of dengue fever in Singapore with 14,000 cases reported.&nbsp; Thanks to the effort of multiple agencies, including NEA, Town Councils, grassroots volunteers, we overcame the problem and dengue decreased to 3,126 cases in 2006.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we saw a rebound in dengue figures in 2007 due to a&nbsp;serotype change.&nbsp; For the first eight weeks of 2008, there are already 864 cases.&nbsp; In addition, we also saw the emergence of a new viral disease transmitted by the same Aedes mosquito&nbsp;&ndash; Chikungunya virus.&nbsp; The viral disease is also endemic in South East Asia but not in Singapore previously until now.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Environment Health Institute (EHI)&nbsp;does research on vectors, dengue virus and maintain a strict surveillance on the&nbsp;mosquito population in various parts of our island.&nbsp; The EHI also studies dengue virus&nbsp;serotypes as well as monitors the&nbsp;serotype shifts.&nbsp; Detection of&nbsp;serotype shifts or new virus may predict&nbsp;epidemic risk and early measures may be instituted to reduce the risk and the effects of such an epidemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Apart from being situated in&nbsp;a dengue endemic region, the successful vector control efforts that we have sustained over the past three decades have paradoxically contributed to a large segment of our population today having very low immunity against dengue, to the extent that&nbsp;it now takes only a small number of mosquitoes to sustain dengue transmission.&nbsp; Against this backdrop and assuming the local dengue incidence continues to follow the current&nbsp;natural cycle of five to seven years, we are likely to see a further increase in the incidence of dengue in the next few years.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dengue, however, is no longer the only challenge that we are facing today.&nbsp; Globalisation has also made Singapore more&nbsp;susceptible to the import of exotic vector-borne diseases from all over the world.&nbsp; Of these, we are particularly at risk from diseases that are transmitted by vectors already present in Singapore, such as the Chikungunya fever which is transmitted by the Aedes mosquito.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked whether EHI detected the presence of Chikungunya virus in mosquito or larva before the recent outbreak.&nbsp; EHI does not routinely screen local mosquitoes or larvae, as this is not a cost effective approach.&nbsp; Instead, EHI works closely with the hospitals and GPs under an active surveillance network to screen patients with dengue symptoms for the Chikungunya virus.&nbsp; This approach has proven to be effective.&nbsp; We were able to promptly detect the first local case of Chikungunya fever recently.&nbsp; NEA will continue to participate in research studies to further our understanding of emerging vector-borne diseases, some of which have yet to reach our shores.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Masagos Zulkifli asked about the measures that will be taken to prevent a surge of cases in 2008.&nbsp;This year, we will continue to focus on pre-emptive source reduction to suppress the mosquito population ahead of the warmer months, when dengue transmission is expected to intensify.&nbsp; We will also work with MOH to promote the early detection of dengue and Chikungunya fever, as this will allow prompt intervention to limit disease transmission.&nbsp; On this note, I would like to commend the good efforts that the Inter-Agency Dengue Taskforce has devoted to dengue control in the past few years.&nbsp; The Taskforce will continue to be an important part of Singapore's dengue control regime in the days ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding these efforts, I would like to remind the House that Government action alone will not be adequate.&nbsp; The public also needs to play their part to deny the vectors the place to breed.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we still saw an increase in the number of breeding in homes last year, compared with 2006.&nbsp; As an added deterrent, NEA will be increasing the penalty for first-time offenders caught with breeding in their homes from $100 to $200 with effect from 1st April this year.&nbsp; This increased penalty is the same as that imposed on first-time offenders for littering and smoking ban violation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore is not the only country that is threatened by dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases.&nbsp; Having built up our own defences, we are prepared and ready to help others to strengthen theirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lim asked about cooperation within the region.&nbsp; We are partnering the WHO in developing the Asia Pacific regional strategic dengue control plan.&nbsp; The plan can be used by countries in the region as a blueprint to develop the necessary capability to keep dengue as well as other mosquito-borne diseases at bay.&nbsp; Singapore has offered to co-host, with the WHO, a Dengue Programme Managers Meeting for the Western-Pacific Region later this year.&nbsp; The meeting will serve as the platform for countries to share knowledge and develop the strategic plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, Singapore spent some $70 million to control dengue and we expect the costs to be even higher this year.&nbsp; This is money well spent as the economic cost of not doing anything and seeing a spike in dengue cases may be many times higher, not forgetting the loss of lives.&nbsp;&nbsp; That said, if&nbsp;all of us play our part to be more vigilant and take action as individuals and communities, we can reduce the amount of resources spent to tackle the negative consequences of vector-borne diseases.&nbsp; This ultimately translates to a reduced cost-burden for all Singaporeans.&nbsp; It is only through the concerted efforts of all that we can prevent vector-borne diseases from taking root in Singapore and threatening our quality of life.&nbsp; I therefore urge everyone to continue to do&nbsp;their part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I turn to the topic of&nbsp; littering.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustaining a high standard of public cleanliness has always been a priority for the Government.&nbsp; I would like to inform the House that a Public Cleansing Survey (PCS) commissioned by NEA last year has found that the majority of Singaporeans (some 70%) were satisfied with the state of public cleanliness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEA, together with other agencies such as NParks, PUB, SLA, and the town councils, is responsible for the cleansing of public places.&nbsp; Ms Lee Bee Wah asked how we monitor drain cleansing in our estates. Drain cleansing is carried out by private cleaning contractors through performance-based contracts.&nbsp; In addition to a minimum cleansing frequency, contractors need to meet stipulated performance standards, stepping up their cleansing frequency if the situation on the ground warrants it.&nbsp; PUB conducts audit checks and imposes demerit points for unsatisfactory performance, which may translate into deductions in the payments to the contractors.&nbsp; Members of the public can provide feedback on any lapse in performance to PUB or NEA, who will ensure the contractors take the necessary follow-up action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustaining a high standard of public cleanliness, however, is not about employing an ever-increasing number of cleaners.&nbsp; It is also about correcting the mindset that it is acceptable to litter because someone else will clean up for us.&nbsp; We have been working with MOE and educational institutions to emphasise the importance of environmental ownership in our educational curriculum, so as to imbue a sense of civic-mindedness in our youths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from youths, we have been targeting the anti-littering message at the nation as a whole, under the umbrella of the \"Singapore, Litter-Free\" campaign.&nbsp; We agree with Mdm Cynthia Phua that we should work with all stakeholders.&nbsp; Thus, we reached out to the residents through district-wide initiatives such as \"My Environment Shines\" organised jointly with the CDCs and grassroots organisations, to raise civic-mindedness and promote community ownership.&nbsp; At this juncture, I would also like to commend Mdm Cynthia Phua for her town council's effort to join us in the fight against littering.&nbsp; We are also working with MOM and employers to educate foreign workers against littering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise that sustained enforcement is necessary to deal with the minority group of litterbugs who remain resistant to our educational efforts.&nbsp; To this end, NEA has been increasing the number of enforcement manhours in the past few years.&nbsp; But we agree with Mdm Cynthia Phua and Mdm Ho Geok&nbsp;Choo that there is more we can do to deter people from committing socially irresponsible acts such as littering and spitting.&nbsp; Thus, in addition to the current littering \"hotspots\" in town centres, NEA will step up enforcement against littering in lift lobbies, letterbox areas and void decks of HDB estates, where littering continues to be a problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We share Mdm Ho's&nbsp;observation that improper dumping of bulky refuse in HDB common areas is also a concern.&nbsp; As the town councils continue to educate the residents on the availability of bulky waste removal services, we also encourage civic-minded residents to help us spread the message of proper bulky refuse disposal, as Mdm Ho has suggested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's image as a \"clean and green city\" did not happen by chance.&nbsp; It was achieved through years of conscientious efforts put in by the Government and the community.&nbsp; My Ministry will continue to adopt the combined approach of public education and sustained enforcement, to tackle the littering problem in Singapore, so as to ensure that we continue to enjoy a \"clean and green\" living environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Lee Bee Wah asked if there are plans to build no frills hawker centres to keep rental costs low. I would like to note that&nbsp;although the Government has no plan to build new hawker centres, we will maintain and upgrade existing ones, many of which have been built ages ago, so that they can continue to provide a clean and hygienic dining environment.&nbsp; More than 80% of respondents surveyed in 2005 felt strongly that upgraded centres were cleaner, drier and more spacious, while two-thirds indicated that they would patronise these centres more often.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

That conversation resonated even more&nbsp;later when the water issues became a very hot issue with Malaysia, and then more recently when the climatic changes in the world are vaporising the glaciers and putting rain where there were none in the past.&nbsp; His ominous words could certainly ring true&nbsp;- shifts and changes in where water can be found and used will be potential points of conflict in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming back to Singapore, we are fortunate that the Government has taken steps for some time now to source for alternative resources. &nbsp;Besides the supply from Johor, the NEWater and desalinated water have proven to be viable and comforting alternatives in addition to our local source.&nbsp; My question to the Minister is whether, with these&nbsp;four taps, there is sufficient water supply both for domestic and industry, for now and the future, from these four sources, or do we need a fifth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With global climatic change, the public should be aware that global scarcity of potable water is real.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, good habits and practices should be imbibed, if not imposed, in conserving this precious resource.&nbsp; One approach for domestic uses that the Ministry has undertaken recently was to encourage voluntary water efficiency labelling for domestic appliances.&nbsp; May I ask if there is a need to make this mandatory?&nbsp; This practice will definitely help our consumers make the correct choice and attain MEWR&rsquo;s 10L challenge.&nbsp; What are the Ministry&rsquo;s plans for non-domestic water users?&nbsp; With respect to water charges, can the Minister update us on the restructuring of water charges announced in the last COS?&nbsp;

We recognise the importance of individual effort in water conservation and have schemes to promote this.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2006, we launched the 10 Litre Challenge to reduce daily water consumption per capita by 10 litres.&nbsp; I am happy to report that 68 water volunteer groups have since been formed in 39 constituencies involving Residents Committees, voluntary welfare organisations and other organisations.&nbsp; These groups volunteer their time over the weekends to visit households and assist in the installation of water saving devices.&nbsp; We hope more Singaporeans will step forward to follow this fine example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through our outreach and educational programmes, we have lowered our daily per capita domestic water consumption from 165 litres in 2003 to 157 litres today.&nbsp; We are on track to reach our target of 155 litres by 2012.&nbsp; In 2006, we also launched the voluntary water efficiency labelling scheme as part of the 10 Litre Challenge.&nbsp; To-date, more than 500 products have been labelled, from taps to shower heads to washing machines.&nbsp;This allows consumers to make informed choices when they make their purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to inform Mr Masagos that in view of the favourable response that we have received for the voluntary scheme, the labelling scheme will be made mandatory from July 2009.&nbsp; For a start, taps, flushing systems and urinals must come with water efficiency labels.&nbsp; We will consider extending this scheme to shower heads and washing machines in the future when more water efficient models are available.&nbsp; From July 2009, taps, urinals and dual flush systems installed in all new developments and premises undergoing renovations must have at least one-tick water efficiency rating.&nbsp; As developers install water devices in bulk, this will hasten the take-up of water efficient devices and incentivise suppliers to bring in more models.&nbsp;

PUB currently has some initiatives to manage water demand in this sector.&nbsp; For example, users are encouraged to run water-efficient buildings by using water-efficient fittings and monitoring their water consumption.&nbsp; They are also encouraged to use NEWater in place of potable water, and to recycle water whenever possible.&nbsp; Last year, PUB also launched the Water Efficiency Fund to provide financial incentives to companies to take on water conservation measures and develop alternative water sources.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our experience with water-efficient building programmes suggests that there is generally scope to lower one's water consumption by about 5% to&nbsp;10%.&nbsp; Hence, we would like to call on non-domestic users to take up a 10% challenge where we will work with them to reduce their water consumption by up to 10%, if not more.&nbsp; This can be achieved, for instance, by installing water-saving devices and adopting good water management practices.&nbsp; Taking up this challenge will also benefit the users, since reduction in water consumption means cost savings.&nbsp; Over the next three to five years, we will engage the different sectors to help them lower their water consumption.&nbsp; We will start off with Government and commercial buildings, hotels and schools.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help promote this 10% challenge, a 10% Challenge website will be launched.&nbsp; It will assist users in assessing the state of water management in their premises and identify opportunities for improvement.&nbsp; PUB will also work with institutions, like the polytechnics, to develop a Water Efficiency Manager Course to equip inhouse facilities and operations managers with the knowledge and skills to conduct water audits and adopt waste conservation measures.&nbsp; PUB also plans to work with professional organisations to develop a water-efficient building design guide.&nbsp; PUB will work with BCA to include water-efficient building design as a criterion under the Green Mark certification for buildings.&nbsp; All in, the 10% challenge is a basket of initiatives to encourage and assist the non-domestic sector to reduce their water consumption.&nbsp; Beyond cost savings to customers, we hope to achieve a longer term change in the mindset and approach towards the design of buildings and systems that are water-efficient.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Together, they will increase our catchment area from half to two-thirds of Singapore&rsquo;s land area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEWater demand has been growing since its introduction in 2003.&nbsp; The industry values NEWater for its high quality.&nbsp; With the completion of our fifth and largest NEWater plant at Changi, NEWater will be able to meet 30% of our water needs by 2011, up from the current 15%.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fourth tap is desalinated water.&nbsp; The Singspring desalination plant was commissioned in 2005, and can supply up to 10% of our water demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, our Four National Taps will ensure a robust and sustainable supply to meet Singapore&rsquo;s long-term water needs.&nbsp; But there are areas that we can improve.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, currently, Jurong Island gets its water from mainland Singapore.&nbsp; Water demand on the island amounts to some 10% of the total demand in Singapore.&nbsp; This is expected to increase with further industrial growth on Jurong Island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the high and concentrated demand on Jurong Island, there is scope to consider developing localised water supply on the island itself.&nbsp; There is plentiful supply of seawater for desalination, and we can also recycle the used water on the island.&nbsp; PUB will study the feasibility of developing water supply on Jurong Island.&nbsp; Should we proceed, we will ensure that there is minimal cost impact to the companies on Jurong Island.&nbsp;&nbsp;If successful, this initiative will enhance Singapore&rsquo;s reputation as a leader in integrated water resource management and in balancing environmental sustainability with industrial development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Masagos also asked for an update on the restructuring of water charges, which was mentioned at last year's COS.&nbsp; I had informed the House that my Ministry would look into restructuring the used water charges into a single volumetric fee, moving towards a single price for water.&nbsp; We are still in the process of studying the implementation details.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our initiatives in managing our water supply and demand represent a holistic approach to water management that is increasingly recognised internationally.&nbsp; For its excellence in integrated water resource management, PUB was awarded the Stockholm Industry Water Award last year.&nbsp; We want to build upon such achievements and track record to develop Singapore as a hub for water solutions to meet global challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Masagos asked how the water industry has grown and what the plans are to develop it further.&nbsp; Last year, Sir, I informed Members that we had set up the Environment and Water Industry Development Council (EWI), to spearhead our efforts to grow the water industry.&nbsp; I am pleased to report that EWI has made good progress in 2007.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the investment promotion efforts by both the EDB and PUB, we have continued to attract and anchor major multinational companies and R&amp;D centres.&nbsp; Black and Veatch, for example, has announced plans to expand its Singapore operations to serve as its Global Design Centre.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our home-grown companies, such as Hyflux, Keppel and SembCorp, have done us proud by expanding their businesses in key overseas markets, such as China and the Middle East.&nbsp; A number of major projects were clinched last year, such as Keppel&rsquo;s $1.5 billion wastewater treatment contract in Qatar.&nbsp; In addition, under the MOU which my Ministry had signed with the Ministry of Construction in China on cooperation in urban environment and water resources, in-principle agreement was reached for SembCorp and PUB to jointly embark on a wastewater treatment and water supply demonstration project in ZhangJiaGang, China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EWI&rsquo;s key strategy in growing the water industry is to nurture a vibrant research eco-system.&nbsp; This would provide critical technological innovation, intellectual capital and trained specialist manpower for our growing environment and water industry.&nbsp; The research community and Singaporeans have responded very positively to this development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our local academic institutions have been proactive in building up their research capacity.&nbsp; Both NUS and NTU have established institutes that are focused on environment and water research.&nbsp; Internationally renowned research institutes, such as Delft Hydraulics, have likewise been attracted to set up their R&amp;D Centres and partnerships in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riding on this momentum, Sir, we will be launching our flagship water event, the Singapore International Water Week (SIWW) in June this year.&nbsp; I hope Members can pencil in their diary 23rd to 27th June, and that they could&nbsp;turn up.&nbsp; This will be a milestone for Singapore, as the Water Week will be a platform for Government officials, industry leaders and water professionals from all over the world to network and share solutions and experiences in the field of water.&nbsp; In the long term, we plan to grow SIWW into a leading water show in the world, which will contribute to our vision for Singapore to become a global hydro-hub.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Muhammad Faishal has asked about the new and attractive water projects that the public can look forward to.&nbsp; I&nbsp;heard&nbsp;Mr Christopher De Souza also touched on this during the Budget debate and had added kindly the letter \"D\" to his ABC.&nbsp; I am pleased to inform the House that the Marina Barrage, when completed, will not only increase our water supply but help to alleviate flooding in low-lying areas of the city.&nbsp; We can see on the&nbsp;screens the picture of the Marina Barrage.&nbsp; I&nbsp;hope this will warm up the House.&nbsp; The reservoir created will also be a lifestyle attraction offering a host of recreational possibilities.&nbsp; International and local sporting events, such as sailing and river regattas, will be held, adding buzz to the Marina Bay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the third quarter this year, visitors to the Marina Barrage will be able to learn about Singapore&rsquo;s water story and understand how the barrage works. &nbsp;This is the Visitors' Centre on the screen.&nbsp; They will also get to see green features in the building design, such as the turfed roof, the use of solar energy, and water and energy-efficient fittings.&nbsp; So, Sir, we walk the talk.&nbsp; Through these, we hope the public can learn more about the Marina Barrage and other projects, and how they can play a part in our water and environmental sustainability story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, last year, as pointed out by Dr Muhammad Faishal, the PUB launched the ABC Waters programme to bring people closer to water so that they will better cherish this precious resource.&nbsp; Under the programme, our drains, canals and reservoirs will be transformed into vibrant, beautiful and clean streams, rivers and lakes, raising the quality of life of Singaporeans to an even higher level.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to report good progress on the first three projects which will be completed this year - at Kolam Ayer, Bedok Reservoir and MacRitchie Reservoir.&nbsp; Singaporeans can also expect more exciting projects across the island, including those&nbsp;at Lower Seletar Reservoir, Jurong Lake, Pandan Reservoir, Sungei Punggol and Kallang River near Bishan Park.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now give a preview of some of these projects, so that after a long week and a long day, we end up on a high note, Sir.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eastern part of Singapore, at Lower Seletar Reservoir, the rich heritage of the area will be preserved.&nbsp; Along the heritage bridge, visitors can take in the scenic view of the reservoir and, through story panels, learn of the interesting history of Lower Seletar Reservoir and its previous Orang Seletar settlement.&nbsp; This will connect the young with the past and bring back memories of the place for the older generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the western part of Singapore, Jurong Lake will be transformed into a family recreational attraction. Here, school children can learn how wetlands function and families can get close to the water along the boardwalks. &nbsp;As a connection to the loose translation of Jurong as a fish - as I understand, its local name is Ikan Julong -&nbsp;there will be a fishing promenade for anglers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in the central part of Singapore, Kallang River along Bishan Park will be transformed into a scenic river, which will be integrated with the adjacent park.&nbsp; Families can enjoy a quiet stroll along the new footbridge connecting the residential estates from both sides of Bishan Park.&nbsp; They can also enjoy picnics by the water while children have fun at the water play areas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these projects, we hope to bring waterfront living to the HDB heartlands, improve the quality of our living environment and enhance property values.&nbsp; It will also bring closer to realisation our vision of being a City of Gardens and Water, which is one of the key thrusts of Clean and Green Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while the Government carries out the physical infrastructural works, the success of these projects will depend on the community.&nbsp; We want people to visit our waters, have fun and, in doing so, develop a sense of ownership and play their part to keep our waters clean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB will engage the community to encourage them to take ownership of these projects.&nbsp; A one-day workshop was held for the pilot project at Kolam Ayer, where the community groups brainstormed how they could sustain the project in their estate. &nbsp;They are now developing those ideas into community bonding projects which they will run themselves.&nbsp; Similar workshops will also be conducted for the other ABC Waters projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me&nbsp;conclude.&nbsp; I would like to&nbsp;thank the Members for their views and suggestions.&nbsp; We can all be proud that Singapore has done well to achieve the clean and healthy environment that we enjoy today. While we continue to take care of our environment, we are also moving towards our vision of becoming a city of Gardens and Water to further enhance the quality of life of all Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, my Ministry will maintain a strong focus on environmental sustainability to ensure that we deliver an even higher quality environment in tandem with a growing population and economy. &nbsp;We will continue with efforts to develop and position Singapore as a global hub and a thought-leader for environment, water technologies and solutions.&nbsp; At the same time, we will encourage the private sector to adopt more environmentally-friendly business practices, especially where these result in cost-savings and greater resource security. &nbsp;To facilitate such efforts, we will look into providing incentives where necessary, for instance, to address market barriers and failures.&nbsp; We will continue to take a sensible approach by adopting measures that reap effective returns and long-term benefits for our people and industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Government will actively do our part, achieving environmental sustainability will require the participation of each and every Singaporean. &nbsp;It can be as simple as not littering, keeping our homes free from dengue, bringing our recyclables to the nearest recycling bin, and choosing water and energy-efficient appliances.&nbsp; I urge everyone, including Members of this House,&nbsp;to be more mindful in the little choices that we make in our daily&nbsp;lives.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

But certainly we want to explore all the available opportunities.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Er Edwin Khew Teck Fook-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Er Edwin Khew Teck Fook:</B> The Minister did not answer my question.&nbsp; This is with regard&nbsp;to attracting companies with the recyclable technologies to come into Singapore.&nbsp; Will the Minister&nbsp;consider providing more incentives?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assuming&nbsp;right now that we are more efficient in terms of recycling various recyclables, how are we going to&nbsp;treat all these recyclables?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember at one stage we had a mountain full&nbsp;of waste paper.&nbsp; We were so efficient&nbsp;in recycling paper that I think at that time the market&nbsp;value of paper was very low, so we were caught with this.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

But I agree with Mr Khew that will be one of our primary consideration because there is no point collecting all the papers and there is nowhere to go.&nbsp; But, at the same time, there are&nbsp;fluctuations in market prices that we cannot control.&nbsp; Global prices are something which we have no control over and, therefore, this may&nbsp;affect some of the decisions that we make.&nbsp; But we will continue to explore these options.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</B> I would like to seek clarification from the Senior Parliamentary Secretary.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it mean that NEA will from now on just only upgrade the existing hawker centres and will never consider building new hawker centres for the existing housing estates or any other new housing estates that will be built?\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</B> I think the mantra is never say never.&nbsp; But, at the moment, there is no plan to build new hawker centres.&nbsp; But I suppose going forward, you really have to look at the demands and needs of the population.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</B> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister&nbsp;whether efforts can be made to energy mark our water pumps for aquariums, waterfalls and koi ponds.&nbsp; As many believe in <I>nian nian yu yue</I>, there is the extra consumption of energy in homes and organisations, and&nbsp;these home aquariums and ponds are getting very popular.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.
