Article 49 of the\r\nConstitution states that when a seat falls vacant, it shall be filled\r\nby election. In an SMC, a seat falls vacant when the Member of Parliament\r\nvacates his office, for example, when he is expelled from his political\r\nparty, resigns from his seat or passes away. The timing of the by-election\r\nis at the discretion of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is not\r\nobliged to call a by-election within any fixed time frame. This\r\nabsence of any stipulated time frame is the result of a deliberate\r\ndecision by Parliament to confer on the Prime Minister the discretion\r\nto decide when to fill a Parliament vacancy.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-32f6b88a-86ee-4f87-95e3-31e7ca17b37f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-da7a09fb-c161-4979-956c-a651c0b68488__id-32f6b88a-86ee-4f87-95e3-31e7ca17b37f\"><!--a--></a>Then Prime Minister Mr\r\nLee Kuan Yew explained this when he moved the constitutional amendment\r\nin December 1965, in other words, immediately after Singapore became\r\nindependent.

Members in this House will know that there was\r\nno such injunction of holding a by-election within three months\r\nin our previous Constitution. We resisted this particular condition\r\nbeing imposed upon the State Constitution at the time we entered\r\nMalaysia. But our representations were not accepted because Malaysia\r\ninsisted on uniformity of our laws with the other States in the\r\nFederation, and with the Federal Constitution itself. Since we are\r\nno longer part of the Federal whole, for reasons which we find valid\r\nand valuable as a result of our own experience of elections and\r\nof government in Singapore, we have decided that this limitation\r\nshould no longer apply.\"</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6a458bca-0ac2-4cbc-af48-f8e46d6760c9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-da7a09fb-c161-4979-956c-a651c0b68488__id-6a458bca-0ac2-4cbc-af48-f8e46d6760c9\"><!--a--></a>The Constitution, therefore,\r\nreflects a political philosophy that emphasises stable government\r\nand the view that in elections, voters are primarily choosing between political\r\nparties to be given the mandate to govern the country, rather than\r\nbetween individual candidates to become Members of Parliament.

Sir, nobody wants to be sick or to be\r\nstricken with a severe disability. For a family who has to care\r\nfor an elderly with severe disabilities, the burden of care is heavy.\r\nWe must give the best support to low- and middle-income families\r\nto cope with this financial burden. Caregiving at home is no longer\r\nan option for them, but a critical necessity, as hiring a private\r\nnurse or caregiver would be out of their reach. The elderly would have to be cared\r\nfor full-time, and probably for a life-time. Thus, the foreign domestic\r\nhelper can free up family members to continue with their jobs while\r\nat the same time, ensuring the elderly sick is well looked after.\r\nEven though this grant is on top of the existing maid levy concession\r\nof $170, as the hon Member Mr Gan Thiam Poh just mentioned, there\r\nis still a levy gap of $50. I would urge the Government to consider increasing\r\nthe grant to fully cover the levy.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2429</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8002e94e-6bf1-463d-912f-1b78afe06ab9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-8002e94e-6bf1-463d-912f-1b78afe06ab9\"><!--a--></a>Can the Ministry also\r\nreview the disability criteria of three activities of daily living (ADLs)?\r\nFor a senior who cannot even perform two of the ADLs, like feed\r\nthemselves or change themselves, they need close supervision and\r\ncare.

Chairman, the pre-school\r\nsector has seen burgeoning demand for places in the past two years\r\nthat will likely not wane in the next two. Yet challenges on the\r\nground, relating particularly to the supply of good professionals,\r\nare yet to be adequately addressed. In 2011, MCYS announced the\r\ndevelopment of 200 new pre-school centres by 2013. Initiatives announced\r\nin Budget 2012 will further bolster the demand for places: enhanced\r\npre-school subsidies for children from less well-off families make\r\nit more attractive for them to be enrolled in pre-school centres;\r\nand Budget 2012 has committed to increasing the number of places\r\nin centres for children in need of early intervention. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-df9ec988-5848-4090-9a66-1a6c9781df1f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-df9ec988-5848-4090-9a66-1a6c9781df1f\"><!--a--></a>However, it seems the\r\nurgent situation on the supply side of things appears to have been\r\noverlooked in comparison to the created demand for pre-school places.\r\nSupply not with regards to the projected number of children entering\r\nthis education stream in the next two years but the supply of quality\r\nmanpower to staff and develop these very centres we are building.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2d5b0800-1730-40d4-a856-6a722987d080\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-2d5b0800-1730-40d4-a856-6a722987d080\"><!--a--></a>MCYS estimates that 1,400\r\nnew positions will be created by 2014.

It\r\nseems now that we are caught up in a blind race to create a first-rate\r\npre-school ecosystem only to miss out on an essential aspect of\r\neducating: that is, the educators themselves. What are MCYS' plans\r\nto attract talented professionals to join this sector? </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ea966e5d-9918-4781-804f-ca1ac468648c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-ea966e5d-9918-4781-804f-ca1ac468648c\"><!--a--></a>Let us also address a\r\nfundamental question.

If so, what makes this sector unattractive?\r\nI posit two reasons: the remuneration package and the lack of professional\r\nstanding of the sector. In\r\nthe past year, NTUC First Campus and PAP Community Foundation announced\r\nsalary revisions for their teachers. This resulted in strong reactions\r\non the ground as other operators strove to roll out policies to\r\nbetter retain staffs. Enlightened operators reviewed to enhance\r\ntheir employee value proposition and revise their salaries whilst others\r\nreviewed and made it even more punitive for their staff. In the\r\nlatter point, the clauses of such employees' contracts are often\r\nnot illegal but are highly unfair and unreasonable. For such cases,\r\nthe assistance rendered by the MOM is limited as to the scope of\r\nthe Employment Act. Those holding supervisory positions in pre-schools\r\nare at an even greater disadvantage, with coverage limited to salary\r\nclaims.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-22a78dcc-cb66-405a-82e9-3ef8fb07d7f9\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-22a78dcc-cb66-405a-82e9-3ef8fb07d7f9\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2430</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading hcTime\" id=\"id-9dd90363-9e81-4109-a6d3-4753ff5c71c6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9dd90363-9e81-4109-a6d3-4753ff5c71c6\"><!--a--></a>11.15 am</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7ae3bf48-7c9a-46a8-a859-a483b190cd88\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-7ae3bf48-7c9a-46a8-a859-a483b190cd88\"><!--a--></a>How can the pre-school\r\nsector be seen as a professional sector if management practices\r\nare still unprofessional?

With more women being encouraged to join the\r\nworkforce, measures must be in place to ensure that we have enough\r\naffordable childcare centres in convenient locations affording good\r\nquality care. Many young couples have expressed reservations about\r\nhaving more children as they are not confident that they will be\r\nable to provide good care with both parents and increasingly grandparents\r\nactive in the workforce. Hence, I would like to request that the Government\r\nconsider regulating and possibly standardising the fees at childcare centres.\r\nAt the same time, would the Ministry consider providing more generous increases\r\nin childcare subsidies to make the fees more affordable for Singaporeans?

One\r\nof these benefits is to be covered under the Child Development Co-Savings\r\nAct which entitles the mother to a total of 16 weeks of maternity\r\nleave. Sir, the current policies made may correctly seek to reinforce\r\nthe role that the single woman's parents play in supporting the\r\nfamily unit. However, maternity leave could be seen primarily as\r\nbeing of benefit to the infant. Women who have adequate maternity\r\nleave are more likely to fully breast feed for the recommended time,\r\nwith this having significant long-term benefits to the child in\r\nterms of growth, development and bonding with the parents. These\r\nbeneficial effects cannot be addressed in any other way except by\r\nallowing the mother and the infant to spend time together.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-375b82db-1327-47f5-81ec-04cdbff82a19\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-375b82db-1327-47f5-81ec-04cdbff82a19\"><!--a--></a>While there are provisions\r\nfor mothers to claim more maternity benefits if they subsequently\r\nmarry, this is a narrow view, only addresses the concept of reward,\r\nand does not in any way provide for the needs of the infant in the\r\nfirst four months' life.

Indeed, Sir, in all our schemes and all\r\nthat we do, there will always be two types of issues that may concern\r\nus, what I sometimes call the false positive and sometimes call\r\nthe false negative. False positives are sometimes cases where people may\r\ntry to abuse the system, find ways to go round the system. But I\r\nbelieve this is a small problem that we can manage and the way we\r\nmanage this will depend very much on the people working on the ground,\r\nmaking the ground assessments. I always tell my Meet-the-People\r\nSessions (MPS) helpers that they are the first line of defence,\r\nthat when someone comes to them, they are like the <em class=\"ph i\">sinseh</em> feeling\r\nthe pulse of the person. They have to, based on the evidences available,\r\nmake the best judgement and make a call to recommend to me whether\r\nthat person really is deserving of help. Once in a while, there will\r\nbe a false positive where someone for various reasons tries to beat\r\nthe system. We will try to manage that. I am concerned about that,\r\nbut yet on the other hand, I am concerned more about what I call\r\nthe false negative. The false negative represents the people who\r\nreally need help, but for some reasons are unable to, or do not\r\nknow where to go and get help.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-850f8d46-4da0-4c58-b3a1-12a6c1309df0\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-850f8d46-4da0-4c58-b3a1-12a6c1309df0\"><!--a--></a> In my weekly Walk-the-Block\r\nsessions \u2013 and I do it twice a week \u2013 we will always go round to\r\nlook out for these people.

This is why we\r\nhave introduced the subsidies and enhancements which I had mentioned\r\nearlier. With these changes, more Singaporeans will benefit because\r\nthe qualifying per capita monthly income will rise from $1,400 to $2,200.\r\nElderly persons from larger households will also benefit from a\r\nnew per capita household income criteria. Those who qualify will\r\nalso receive more. Subsidies will be raised by as much as 80%, with\r\nthe middle income groups seeing the highest increase. In addition,\r\nthe Government will absorb the GST applied on eldercare services\r\nfor all subsidised clients. Allow me just to illustrate with an\r\nexample. Mr Abdul Kadir attends the NTUC eldercare programme at\r\nSilver Circle (Punggol South). He is currently staying with his\r\ndaughter Mdm Safiah in a 3-room flat in Ang Mo Kio. Under the current\r\nsubsidy framework, he receives $195 of means tested subsidy a month.\r\nUnder the enhanced subsidy framework, he will now receive $450 per\r\nmonth. We will continue to be mindful of the affordability and look\r\ninto issues such as the efficiency and productivity.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-058d169a-ae7d-4c74-8ddb-4a5e5610d772\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-058d169a-ae7d-4c74-8ddb-4a5e5610d772\"><!--a--></a>Mr David Ong also asked\r\nabout sports philanthropy. Indeed, Sir, I am very mindful that as\r\nwe go forth into the next decade, many of our social needs will\r\nbe competing for the finite budget that we have in this country.\r\nFor us to do more for sports, we will need to go beyond just Government\r\nfunding. We will have to look at new and innovative ways to get\r\nmore corporates, private organisations and the people sector to\r\nbe involved in sports. Other countries have a very mature sports\r\nphilanthropy ecosystem, and they have also very innovative ways\r\nto attract corporate sponsorship for sports.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f06db35e-bcfc-4262-84f6-c7abc76716d4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-f06db35e-bcfc-4262-84f6-c7abc76716d4\"><!--a--></a>Traditionally, our sports\r\nscene has tended to try to attract people into sports giving by\r\nusing part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) budget\r\nbut we think that sports can go beyond CSR. Sports need not just\r\nbe a charity that we give to with excess money that we have. Sports\r\ncan be a way to help brand a company. Some of these more established\r\ncompanies that have done this very successfully are, for example,\r\nStandard Chartered and OCBC. The StanChart Marathon now into the\r\n10th year is extremely successful. They grew from 6,000 in the first\r\nyear to 60,000. Today, on the off-day when you see someone wearing\r\na blue T-shirt running around, chances are that it reminds you that this person is\r\na StanChart Marathon participant in one of their categories.

So long as an operator meets the criteria, we will allow them\r\nto go onto the scheme.

At the same time,\r\nto make sure that there is a certain quality of education available\r\nfor the children. So I do not, for one, prescribe that there will\r\nonly be one.

Thus, the Taskforce\r\nrecommended making express provisions for repair and replacement\r\nto allow consumers, retailers and the courts additional options\r\nto resolve defects that occur. CASE highlighted that such provisions\r\nwould address the key problem of some retailers refusing to replace\r\ndefective goods after multiple failed attempts to repair. Retailers\r\nalso gave feedback that the inclusion of the options of repair and\r\nreplacement would allow them more flexibility.

In other words, someone buying a 10-year-old\r\ncar from a dealer could not reasonably expect it to be like a brand\r\nnew car. However, he can expect it to perform in a manner that may be\r\nreasonably expected of a car of that mileage and model. If it does\r\nnot do so, the consumer can seek remedies from the dealer.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d8578a80-958a-429c-9045-51d91dc5a4e1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-d8578a80-958a-429c-9045-51d91dc5a4e1\"><!--a--></a>Services are not covered\r\nas the remedies under the Lemon Law regime are tailored for goods,\r\nand are generally inappropriate for services.

As\r\nsuch, retailers cannot exclude the transaction from the Lemon Law,\r\nby simply displaying a notice saying, \"we do not give refunds under\r\nany circumstances\" or that \"an item has been sold as it is\". Therefore,\r\nretailers should be transparent at the point of sale, through appropriate\r\nlabelling and disclaimers. For clarity, the retailer should document\r\nany defects and limitations on the sales contract, invoice or packaging. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-46f0de32-5b53-43db-9c63-f91b2a06c96a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-46f0de32-5b53-43db-9c63-f91b2a06c96a\"><!--a--></a>Members of the public\r\nhave also asked if properties and building defects are covered under\r\nthe proposed law. There is already existing legislation governing\r\nthe sale and purchase of new or uncompleted properties. Under the\r\nHousing Developers (Control &amp; Licensing) Act and the Sale of\r\nCommercial Properties Act, the standard Sale and Purchase Agreement\r\nprovides for a one-year defects liability period during which the developer\r\nis required to rectify any defects in the property, at the developer's\r\nown cost. Beyond the one-year defects liability period, purchasers\r\ncan still take civil action against the developer for latent defects\r\non grounds of negligence or breach of contract, within six years\r\nfrom the date that the damage arose, or three years from the date\r\nthat the damage was discovered, and whichever is later.

Thus, if a consumer buys a \"lemon\"\r\nproduct during a mid-year sale, would he be deprived of the protection\r\nof this law if the retailer contracts out of the law in his sale\r\nterms or by big bright label saying that the item is a \"sale item\"?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ce5c69b2-0fbe-498a-b76c-56f9ec637414\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-ce5c69b2-0fbe-498a-b76c-56f9ec637414\"><!--a--></a>Finally, Sir, can the\r\ntransferee or consumer ask for costs or compensation under section\r\n12C(2) for wasting time and transport expenses when he has to send\r\nthe product for repair more than once?

A retailer can also insist\r\nthat the transferee make multiple trips to the service centre just\r\nto have the defective item repaired again and again. Sir, this would\r\nbe a waste of time and travelling expenses for the transferee or\r\nthe consumer.

Consumers are entitled to require retailers to\r\nrepair or replace defective goods or require the retailer to reduce\r\nthe price of the goods, or the consumer can cancel the purchase\r\nand get their money back.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-de3c25ba-293e-4c9a-8dac-86daf221a379\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-de3c25ba-293e-4c9a-8dac-86daf221a379\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-72e94913-72f2-4ad5-bd8e-5e861d3800db\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-72e94913-72f2-4ad5-bd8e-5e861d3800db\"><!--a--></a>The key provision that\r\nmakes this right stronger is the proposed section 12(b)(iii) which\r\nprovides that goods, which do not conform to the applicable contract\r\nat any time within six months from the date of delivery, is presumed\r\nnot to have so conformed at the date of delivery. In effect, it\r\ngives consumers a six-month trial period. This enhanced protection\r\ncomes at a timely juncture.

I would be grateful if the\r\nMinister or Minister of State could clarify what that means. For\r\nexample, if the product is sold with a lengthy list of microscopic\r\nterms and conditions, waivers and exclusions, would that be part\r\nof the applicable contract? If so, that could defeat or dilute the\r\nprotection the provision seeks to give, particularly when the terms\r\nseek to restrict or qualify the performance of the product.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-eb718390-1246-42d0-bd6d-938f1a3b380c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-eb718390-1246-42d0-bd6d-938f1a3b380c\"><!--a--></a>Second, the provisions\r\ndo not specify the exact form the refunds must take if the consumer\r\nrequests one. Will the retailer be entitled, for example, to provide\r\na consumer with a voucher or must they pay cash? When it comes to\r\nreplacements, must the retailer provide a brand new product or will\r\nthey be allowed to provide the customer with a refurbished product\r\nor display item? Leaving this uncertain may result in disputes and disappointments. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c0d290b2-caa4-496e-b05d-58deadcab1d2\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-c0d290b2-caa4-496e-b05d-58deadcab1d2\"><!--a--></a>Thirdly, while the retailer\r\nis not allowed to contract out of the provisions of the act, this\r\ndoes not mean that some retailers will not try. As reported in <em class=\"ph i\">The </em>\r\n                  <em class=\"ph i\">Straits\r\nTimes</em> on 16 February 2012, in anticipation of the amendments,\r\none retailer is instructing its staff to record agreements where\r\nconsumers are willing to give up a warranty in exchange for a better\r\nprice. Consumers will be none the wiser as to whether such deals\r\nare allowed. That same would apply to goods on sale. Not knowing\r\nyour rights is as good as not having those rights at all. More must\r\nbe done to educate retailers and consumers about their rights and\r\nobligations arising from these amendments. May I ask the Minister\r\nof State what he plans to do to educate the public on these rights?\r\nHe says there is going to be a \"Lemon Law education campaign\". Could\r\nhe give this House some details on that campaign? But, I think,\r\ndespite all the campaigns and the education, people will forget.\r\nSo can I ask the Minister of State, will there be an obligation\r\nimposed on retailers to inform customers of their rights at the\r\npoint of purchase, which is really the most important time? </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-74e8c6f0-b1fc-4ed9-9f3b-6599afbb2e5b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-74e8c6f0-b1fc-4ed9-9f3b-6599afbb2e5b\"><!--a--></a>Finally, for disputes\r\nwhich cannot be resolved, the parties may try mediation before CASE,\r\nbefore heading to the courts, most likely the Small Claims Tribunal.\r\nThis could take time and could cost more than the item, which is\r\nthe subject of the dispute. Further, the more inconvenient the process,\r\nthe more likely consumers will be deterred from prosecuting their\r\ncomplaints even when there are genuine complaints, or even encourage retailers\r\nto be as difficult as possible so as to discourage the customer.\r\nCould we not simplify the process by giving a body like CASE the\r\npower to make awards for claims not exceeding a certain threshold?\r\nThis, I suspect, would resolve the majority of cases and reduce\r\ntime and costs substantially. There is a precedent for this in banking disputes\r\nwhere customer can turn to Financial Industry Disputes Resolution\r\nCentre (FIDReC) to adjudicate claims not exceeding $50,000. And\r\nas the Minister of State would know, following the Lehman crisis,\r\nmany customers turned to FIDReC for adjudication instead of to the\r\ncourts and many cases were resolved quickly and with minimal costs. There\r\nshould be a similar facility for consumer disputes. This body could\r\nalso maintain a database of awards made which should bring to light\r\nany errant retailer guilty of multiple violations. In this regard,\r\nwould the Minister of State also clarify whether any action will\r\nbe taken against the recalcitrant retailers?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2496</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ab112ed8-6381-4dc9-8c3f-97a50e8d257c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-ab112ed8-6381-4dc9-8c3f-97a50e8d257c\"><!--a--></a>Sir, I support the Government's\r\nmove to help consumers.

Section 13 of the existing Act seems clear enough that\r\nit bars sellers and buyers from contracting out of a refund for\r\nother considerations such as a lower price. However, many retailers\r\nand consumers may not know of this provision. Retailers may attempt\r\ncreative ways to contract themselves out of the provision in this\r\nAct, especially during the initial implementation stage. A lot of\r\nmonitoring and education need to be done. The Minister of State\r\nhas spoken about \"as is\" products.

One may purchase a package only to find\r\nthat the centre is perpetually overbooked and you can hardly get\r\na chance to use your package.

We should be mindful that Singapore\r\nis a cosmopolitan city with consumers, retail frontline staff and\r\neven retail owners coming from a diversity of international backgrounds.\r\nNon-Singaporeans may be used to the retail practices in their native\r\ncountries. A good engagement programme with different stakeholders\r\nin the implementation is critical to its success. Can the Minister\r\nof State elaborate on the steps which the Ministry will take to\r\neducate retailers and consumers in conjunction with the implementation?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-671d15b0-5a40-42c0-a0fb-90d69475c9fa\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-671d15b0-5a40-42c0-a0fb-90d69475c9fa\"><!--a--></a>We have just finished\r\nthe Budget debate which had a lot of focus on SMEs. The bulk of\r\nour retailers are SMEs. The larger retailers will have the better\r\nresources to get themselves acquainted to and cope with the changes.\r\nSmaller retailers may find the changes difficult to understand and\r\ndeal with. Retailers should also be mindful that they need to work\r\nout their own arrangements with product manufacturers to ensure\r\nthat they are not stuck with an untenable position when servicing\r\nthe customers. They will need to factor for refunds and exchanges.\r\nSome retailers may now turn conservation about carrying lower-priced\r\nproducts that may not be built to last even if their consumers are\r\nwilling to buy these because the consumers themselves are highly\r\nprice conscious.\r\nThis will lead to changes in our retail model over the next few\r\nyears. I hope MTI can extend good support to the SME retailers to\r\nease them in the implementation. Engaging in partnership with organisations\r\nsuch as the Singapore Retailers Association will be helpful. I hope,\r\ntoo, that there will be a balanced approach in the implementation so\r\nthat we do not unnecessarily put genuinely good but small retailers\r\nout of business.

We are concerned that some retailers will take advantage\r\nof the buyer's ignorance and ask him, at the point of payment, to\r\nvoluntarily relinquish the right to have the defective merchandise\r\nreplaced or refunded. When the retailer is having a promotion or\r\nsale, buyers are mostly likely to be tricked when they try to save a\r\nfew dollars. I hope that MTI will take note of this. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-83ad9a1a-3718-478e-904e-f26abb69b76b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-83ad9a1a-3718-478e-904e-f26abb69b76b\"><!--a--></a>Another issue is that\r\nsome merchants will only give cash vouchers, not cash, to consumers\r\nwho ask for refunds. There are many conditions associated with a\r\ncash voucher, the consumer can only buy the same type of products\r\nin the same shop. The validity period is also limited. Does the\r\nLemon Law stipulate that consumers have the right to ask for a cash\r\nrefund?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-751ca6f1-cade-4fdd-b65a-ad72274d42fe\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-751ca6f1-cade-4fdd-b65a-ad72274d42fe\"><!--a--></a>In addition, the Bill\r\ndid not state clearly the quality of the replacement product. Many people\r\nworry that the replacement will not be much better than the original\r\ndefective product. I suggest the Law stipulates that if the consumer\r\nbought a new product, the replacement should also be new. If what\r\nhe bought is a second-hand product, then the replacement can be\r\nsecond-hand.

To begin with, the definition of what makes a good defective\r\nis very much left open to interpretation. The seller and buyer will\r\nsurely take a different view on this and claims for refunds will\r\nsurely take time to settle without a clear definition even though the\r\nburden of proof now lies with the seller.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-080d5c9f-4761-4ed2-9893-882ff5620489\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-080d5c9f-4761-4ed2-9893-882ff5620489\"><!--a--></a>For second-hand goods,\r\nit will be an even more tedious process in establishing right and\r\nwrong. Take for example, the purchase of a second-hand car. A few\r\nmonths later, after the purchase, problems may start erupting and\r\nthe new owner has to spend monies in replacing the air-conditioning\r\nsystem, the lights, the brake pumps and even the brake pads. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cbbc163e-c337-4a5a-9914-6f6ec2346a1f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-cbbc163e-c337-4a5a-9914-6f6ec2346a1f\"><!--a--></a>At the point of purchase,\r\none would never have imagined that one has to fork out so much more\r\nsince all these malfunctioning parts to be replaced had never been mentioned\r\nin the first place. The worst thing is that they all happened progressively\r\nin which no physical inspection can help to identify. In the case\r\nof the car air-conditioning, the new owner may just be told that\r\nit was a bit weak and there were no further explanations. In the\r\nnew Law, I suppose you would be able to ask for a replacement car, or\r\nsimilar make, or model, or to receive a further discount?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-bd6f2a5e-5369-4a56-b0ae-27a544dea6fa\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-bd6f2a5e-5369-4a56-b0ae-27a544dea6fa\"><!--a--></a>However, I think it is\r\na weak case. First, the person accepted the fact that the car is having\r\na weaker air-conditioning system and, second, a second-hand car\r\nwould surely have come under prolonged use and its parts are more\r\nliable to break down or be worn out. I am not sure how realistic\r\nit is to ask the second-hand car dealer to guarantee that all the\r\nparts be in tip-top condition. Third, and most importantly, the\r\ncar is still in good driving\r\ncondition.

To place all baskets of goods in the same coverage, the\r\nLaw seems to take a simplistic approach. It is more likely for the\r\nsecond-hand car owner to settle repairs first rather than wait for\r\na car of a similar make, model and mileage to be exchanged.

Taking the example of\r\nan apparel, this is probably one difficult category of product to\r\nestablish the nature of defects for it does not just concern the\r\nsize and fitting but also comfort and aesthetics. An apparel can\r\nshrink after repeated washing and hence the size does not fit or\r\nit becomes tighter. The colours on our shirts and dresses can also fade\r\nafter sometime.

I welcome\r\nthe Lemon Law. To tell you the truth, the first time I heard about\r\nLemon Laws was when I was watching the movie \"Cars 2\" where there\r\nwas a group of cars, one group, they would call themselves \"Lemons\"\r\nwhere they were defective cars and the other cars were the better\r\ncars. That was when I actually checked out what was the meaning\r\nof the lemons and came to know about lemons being defective goods.\r\nI believe I might not be alone in not knowing what is a Lemon Law.\r\nSo, I support the call for public education to know what the Lemon\r\nLaw is all about.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4806f4c9-24a5-478b-a6f3-c35fffc1c074\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-4806f4c9-24a5-478b-a6f3-c35fffc1c074\"><!--a--></a>I think this is a significant\r\nmilestone for the protection of consumer rights. However, I noticed\r\nthe proposed amendment covers only the purchases of goods including perishable\r\nproducts. In many countries, the Lemon Laws actually cover the purchases\r\nof pets. They call it the Puppy Lemon Law. So, I would like to propose\r\nfor the Bill to also include provision for the purchases of pets.\r\nI also want to declare myself as being the owner of two pets.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7d26218d-4060-47fe-9877-301936f92ebd\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-7d26218d-4060-47fe-9877-301936f92ebd\"><!--a--></a>However, in introducing\r\nthe Lemon Laws for pets, I would like to caution against possible\r\nabuses. We have heard cases where the purchasers of pets sometimes,\r\nout of being impulsive, buy the pet at the spur of the moment and\r\nshould they change their mind, I think there must be certain safeguards\r\nto prevent people from causing harm to the animals, hoping that\r\nthey could claim back the purchases of the pets by causing harm\r\nto the animals. I hope sufficient safeguards will be introduced\r\nshould the Ministry consider to include the purchases of pets under\r\nthe Lemon Law.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-e2dfab10-6d3e-4217-8141-c800db4b11ad\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-e2dfab10-6d3e-4217-8141-c800db4b11ad\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading hcTime\" id=\"id-5d86e388-144c-45b2-babf-69856a946d44\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-5d86e388-144c-45b2-babf-69856a946d44\"><!--a--></a>4.14 pm</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6d835a86-8b23-4d25-8f4e-5e3db5fa954a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-6d835a86-8b23-4d25-8f4e-5e3db5fa954a\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Teo Ser Luck</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Speaker,\r\nSir, let me first thank all the Members who have spoken and raised\r\nsome lemon questions or questions relating to the Lemon Law. There are\r\na lot of lemons around. As Members can see, the questions are so\r\nvaried and diverse. As such, first of all, the Law is not going\r\nto be very prescriptive. From the legal perspective, we can pass\r\nthe Law and then try to explain and interpret the Law and educate\r\nconsumers. But on the ground, the law is actually practised in such\r\na way where it gives a win-win situation or position for both the\r\nconsumer and business. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-181f929b-ecde-452f-8f28-baf75a7500cb\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-181f929b-ecde-452f-8f28-baf75a7500cb\"><!--a--></a>I have been on both sides,\r\nas a consumer who bought lemons and, also, as a customer service\r\nrepresentative early in my career when I worked for multinational companies\r\nwith customer service policies that are very simple. For the smaller company,\r\nthey were smaller but the customer policies are very detailed in\r\norder to reduce costs. Both these companies practise customer service\r\nand, I would say, that returns policies are based on very different\r\nkind of philosophies and ideals. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-2e9ea739-d02b-4f0a-ba33-0f2613985891\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-2e9ea739-d02b-4f0a-ba33-0f2613985891\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3e48059e-3f26-44e0-ac85-83dcad534af1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-3e48059e-3f26-44e0-ac85-83dcad534af1\"><!--a--></a>I would say that may be\r\nthe company size is different and some with resources and some without,\r\nbut the ones that have good customer service practices and the ones\r\nthat retain customer loyalty and where the customers keep coming\r\nback are the ones with the least number of rules or guidelines for\r\npeople like us, who are customer service officers who had to deal\r\nwith customers. The broad guideline was: whenever a customer approaches\r\nyou and you engage them, and you look at the product, if there are\r\nany defects or not, always give the benefit of the doubt and exchange\r\nit if you can, if you have the product or the stock. If you do not\r\nhave the same model, offer alternatives. That was how it was practised. We did not go\r\nto the part where there was cash refund because, at that time, we\r\nissued vouchers. At that time, we did not know about the existence\r\nof Sale of Goods Act nor was there any Lemon Law so many years ago.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2503</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e2b80b53-86df-41a7-80ad-78e239289cf2\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-e2b80b53-86df-41a7-80ad-78e239289cf2\"><!--a--></a>Whereas, on the other\r\nhand, I also worked part-time in this company's customer service\r\nunit but it had strict rules. We would get supervised for every\r\nsingle transaction that we approved or disapproved. It was always\r\ndown to the dollars and cents. As you can see, the customers that\r\nhad a very good customer experience would keep coming back and bought\r\nmore products. That is the practice we look for. That is what we\r\nhope the Lemon Law can act as a deterrent law to filter out the\r\nretailers that do not have the best practices. We want to make sure\r\nthat retailers maintain some good practice, give a good customer\r\nexperience. That will be good for the retail sector, the business\r\nsector, also for the companies that deal with consumers directly\r\nevery day. It lifts Singapore up with good reputation and goodwill.\r\nAt the end of the day for consumers and businesses, there are just\r\na few important objectives: quality of the product is very important,\r\nthe goodwill built between the two parties is very important and\r\nwe want to retain the customer loyalty and make sure customers will\r\ncome back and even buy more products. This is extremely important.\r\nSome companies do their sales or market their goods not just based\r\non quality of products but on a customer service approach. You can\r\ntell that some of them practise the principle of money-back guarantee,\r\nno questions asked. Some of these promotional campaigns are actually\r\nquite common, nowadays, because the companies want to show that\r\nthey keep the customers at the very top of their priority.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5f83a245-d4b3-4982-b433-f77a774a43ea\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-5f83a245-d4b3-4982-b433-f77a774a43ea\"><!--a--></a>So, let me try to address\r\nsome of the questions and if I cannot answer all of them, as there\r\nare so many of them and so diverse, I will also come back to you\r\nseparately. But let me start with some of the points of clarification.\r\nMr Lim Biow Chuan, Mr Ang Wei Neng and Mr Yee Jenn Jong who have\r\nasked if the retailers' obligation under the Lemon Law can be contracted\r\nout. The retailer cannot contract out his obligations under the Law.\r\nAs I have spoken in my earlier speech that, even under existing\r\nlaws, the retailer cannot deny the consumer his rights to remedies\r\nby stipulating that it is a sale, display or discounted item that\r\ncannot be refunded or exchanged. Retailers should document any defects\r\nand product limitations on the sales contract, invoice or packaging.\r\nAnd if these defects and limitations are made clear to the consumer\r\nat the point of sale, retailers will not be held liable for them\r\nbut it has to be very specific and pinpoint. I will also address\r\nthis issue later in my speech.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9e520ece-25e0-4fc4-aba0-e187e8f5ade4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-9e520ece-25e0-4fc4-aba0-e187e8f5ade4\"><!--a--></a>Mr Lim also asked if the\r\nconsumer can ask for compensation for time and expenses if he is\r\nasked to send the defective product for multiple repairs. Under\r\nthe proposed Law, the retailer must bear any necessary costs incurred\r\nin providing repair, including the cost of any labour, materials,\r\npostage while delivering the goods for repair. And if the retailer\r\nis unable to provide the repairs within a reasonable time and without\r\ncausing significant inconvenience to consumer, consumer may demand\r\nan alternative remedy, meaning a replacement, a reduction in price\r\nor a refund.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f6ffce33-6bd2-4011-8bc8-bda3111ac422\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-f6ffce33-6bd2-4011-8bc8-bda3111ac422\"><!--a--></a>Mr Gerald Giam has enquired\r\nabout how deduction for usage by the consumer is calculated in the\r\nrefund. The court will have the discretion to determine the appropriate deduction,\r\ndepending on the facts of each case. As Mr Giam has rightly pointed\r\nout, based on existing common law, the court has sometimes refused\r\nto make any deduction for use because of the inconveniences which\r\nthe buyer has already suffered in having to deal with the defective\r\ngoods. This has to be kept open because it really has to depend on\r\nthe type of goods and the nature of the goods, the type of purchases\r\nand how it was purchased\r\nat the point in time and we have to keep it and leave it more open,\r\nflexible and dynamic rather than prescriptive because it may not\r\nbe able to be applied across the board. There is case law where\r\nthe court determined on the spot how the transaction was done, whether\r\nthe goods that were purchased and used, whether there was wear and\r\ntear, whether there was inconvenience caused, and whether there\r\nwas cost incurred in delivering to and fro. All these would have\r\nto be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2504</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-71c5b1af-a690-4a56-8130-406e03885ae4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-71c5b1af-a690-4a56-8130-406e03885ae4\"><!--a--></a>On whether vouchers are\r\nconsidered acceptable refunds, the answer is \"no\". The partial or\r\nfull refund should be in cash. The consumer may decline to accept\r\nvouchers. In my earlier example when I mentioned about my own experience\r\nabout exchanging those products, we never had to deal with cash.\r\nBecause what we want to do was to encourage the customers to continue\r\nto use the product from the same company, use the same brand and\r\nnot go to the competition. That was why we would offer vouchers and\r\nwe would propose alternative products for the customer because we\r\nwant to make sure that we keep the customer within our product.\r\nIf not, they would change the brand or change to another kind of\r\nproduct, we think, we would lose the customer. Under the Law, it\r\nhas to be in cash. In practice it could be very different.

However, the consumer can only do so within a reasonable\r\nperiod which is actually not defined. That is exactly why the Lemon\r\nLaw regime provides a six-month time frame in which the defect that\r\noccurs is presumed to have existed at the time of delivery unless the\r\nseller can prove otherwise. So, in this case, a consumer can return,\r\nreject but the retailer has to prove. So, the burden of proof is\r\nwith the seller.

I am not sure if that is the best\r\nreplacement, but sometimes, it is difficult to say how does a company repair\r\na service or a spa treatment. Moreover, for property including HDB\r\nflats, there is already existing legislation governing the sale\r\nand purchase of new or uncompleted properties, such as the Housing\r\nDevelopers Control and Licensing Act and the Sale of Commercial\r\nProperties Act which provides for one-year defects liability period\r\nand beyond the one-year defects liability period, purchasers can\r\nstill take civil action against the developer for latent defects\r\non grounds of negligence or breach of contract. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-c87c9221-b3d3-4772-8625-71afc7997714\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-c87c9221-b3d3-4772-8625-71afc7997714\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-28b8bc11-3b71-452f-af66-a0778b744f79\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-28b8bc11-3b71-452f-af66-a0778b744f79\"><!--a--></a>Specifically, for time\r\nshare and spa, consumers are already protected under the Consumer\r\nProtection (Fair Trading) Act which contained specific provisions\r\nagainst pressure selling, which is a common complaint.

However, it may not be possible to enforce\r\nthat judgement against those overseas traders if they have no presence\r\nhere.

So\r\nit is included.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cdcb9222-8bd2-4399-9a28-eb1354ff08ea\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-cdcb9222-8bd2-4399-9a28-eb1354ff08ea\"><!--a--></a>In conclusion, let me\r\nborrow a statement from Mr Patrick Tay's speech, \"The introduction\r\nof the Lemon Law is just a start and serves as a deterrent to errant\r\nretailers selling shoddy products and at the end of day what the\r\nlaw seeks to do is not to remove all lemons \u2013 you cannot. It is\r\ndifficult and it is practically impossible \u2013 but to encourage transparency\r\nand good business practices.\" And many a time the law is a deterrent.\r\nOn the ground, with this law, it would encourage good practices\r\nand make sure that we weed out the bad retailers; and the good retailers\r\nremain in place. That can help tourism, our retail sector and business\r\nsector. It will also bring sellers and consumers to work together\r\nto improve the retail environment in Singapore. Most importantly,\r\nit will ensure good quality products. It is goodwill for the retailers\r\nand goodwill and trust between both the retailer and the buyer and,\r\nmost importantly, retain customers for the businesses and this will\r\nbe beneficial for retailers and consumers and for Singapore's retail\r\nsector as a whole.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-70c3b64f-6692-4a49-b290-292a6efc292a\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-70c3b64f-6692-4a49-b290-292a6efc292a\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2509</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7eca14df-fafe-4de0-beb6-53f08aeb8a64\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-7eca14df-fafe-4de0-beb6-53f08aeb8a64\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr\r\nSpeaker</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Lim Biow Chuan, do you have another lemon?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-8ad3a3d6-404e-48f1-86b2-e4ed1ef33db0\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-8ad3a3d6-404e-48f1-86b2-e4ed1ef33db0\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2d005468-b7ff-4417-a224-3431c2c75699\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-93bd0375-e476-4016-9650-3ade2891587e__id-2d005468-b7ff-4417-a224-3431c2c75699\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Lim Biow Chuan</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Just\r\na point of clarification to what the Minister of State said.

I will now\r\nshare with the House in greater detail these amendments, which cover\r\nfour main areas: </p>\r\n                  <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b1547519-8c96-4754-9810-92dd1734291e\">\r\n                     <a name=\"id-0f4b994a-6cb7-433c-908b-044cda5dbdc7__id-b1547519-8c96-4754-9810-92dd1734291e\"><!--a--></a>First, mandate the use\r\nof Effective Interest Rate; second, extend coverage of caps on interest\r\nrate, to a larger group of borrowers; third, remove certain fees\r\nfrom the list of fees\r\nwhich moneylenders are allowed to charge borrowers; and fourth,\r\nabolish all exceptions to the limits on the amount of unsecured\r\nloans that a borrower can obtain.</p>\r\n                  <p class=\"column\">Page: 2511</p>\r\n                  <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-42c8c031-0032-442d-9dfe-1291a6ab66a7\">\r\n                     <a name=\"id-0f4b994a-6cb7-433c-908b-044cda5dbdc7__id-42c8c031-0032-442d-9dfe-1291a6ab66a7\"><!--a--></a> First, we are mandating\r\nthe use of Effective Interest Rate (EIR), instead of Nominal Interest\r\nRate (NIR), to be the basis for interest rate caps. Currently, there\r\nare interest rate caps, based on NIR, of 12% for secured loans and\r\n18% for unsecured loans, for borrowers earning less than $20,000\r\na year. Henceforth, the interest rate cap of 12% NIR will be replaced\r\nby its approximate equivalent of 13% EIR, while the cap of 18% NIR\r\nwill be replaced by its approximate equivalent of 20% EIR.</p>\r\n                  <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-22c20ccc-73d4-4b25-86cd-df65082f5788\">\r\n                     <a name=\"id-0f4b994a-6cb7-433c-908b-044cda5dbdc7__id-22c20ccc-73d4-4b25-86cd-df65082f5788\"><!--a--></a> Moneylenders will also\r\nbe required to compute and disclose the EIR of their loan packages\r\nto borrowers. This is similar to the practice of banks. </p>\r\n                  <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-84a8cdd1-eb67-4d5b-9992-7eb056473842\">\r\n                     <a name=\"id-0f4b994a-6cb7-433c-908b-044cda5dbdc7__id-84a8cdd1-eb67-4d5b-9992-7eb056473842\"><!--a--></a>Compared to NIR, EIR takes\r\ninto account the compounding effect of the number of instalments\r\nover a one-year period. This means that EIR better reflects the\r\nactual cost of borrowing over a one-year period. Using EIR will\r\nalso help borrowers more easily compare different loan packages.</p>\r\n                  <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-265859ae-2864-4440-912c-5b28d1b72405\">\r\n                     <a name=\"id-0f4b994a-6cb7-433c-908b-044cda5dbdc7__id-265859ae-2864-4440-912c-5b28d1b72405\"><!--a--></a> Moneylenders who do not\r\nprovide the Effective Interest Rate of the loan package to their\r\nborrowers are liable to a fine not exceeding $20,000, or to imprisonment\r\nfor a term not exceeding six months, or to both; and in the case\r\nof a second or subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding $40,000,\r\nor to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to both.</p>\r\n                  <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-301ace67-96b3-4b18-87f6-a8d90aa69c58\">\r\n                     <a name=\"id-0f4b994a-6cb7-433c-908b-044cda5dbdc7__id-301ace67-96b3-4b18-87f6-a8d90aa69c58\"><!--a--></a> Second, we are extending\r\nthe coverage of the interest rate caps to a larger group of borrowers,\r\nfrom applying only to borrowers earning less than $20,000 a year,\r\nto those earning less than $30,000 a year. This will apply to both\r\nsecured and unsecured loans. In other words, for borrowers earning\r\nless than $30,000 a year, the interest rate for secured loans that\r\nmoneylenders can charge will be capped at 13% EIR and for unsecured\r\nloans, it will be capped at 20% EIR. Borrowers earning $30,000 or\r\nmore a year generally qualify for credit facilities from banks,\r\nsuch as credit card facilities, and are not dependent solely on\r\nmoneylenders for credit. Thus, we have decided not to introduce any\r\ninterest rate caps for them for now.</p>\r\n                  <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-475a16d5-dc38-4384-a582-e85e04f9bbc9\">\r\n                     <a name=\"id-0f4b994a-6cb7-433c-908b-044cda5dbdc7__id-475a16d5-dc38-4384-a582-e85e04f9bbc9\"><!--a--></a> Sir, when we lifted some\r\ninterest rate caps in 2009, our consideration was that by allowing\r\nmarket forces to freely determine interest rates, there would be\r\ngreater access to credit. This is because the credit profile of\r\nsome borrowers would make it unattractive for moneylenders to lend\r\nto them, if the interest rates are capped and moneylenders cannot\r\ncharge an interest commensurate with the credit risk. Such borrowers\r\nmight then turn to loan sharks, putting themselves at risk, and\r\ncontributing to an increase in unlicensed moneylending activities. </p>\r\n                  <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-54d4aba4-4542-492e-98ee-85929a1a7a5f\">\r\n                     <a name=\"id-0f4b994a-6cb7-433c-908b-044cda5dbdc7__id-54d4aba4-4542-492e-98ee-85929a1a7a5f\"><!--a--></a>Access to credit remains\r\na key concern for my Ministry. Nevertheless, after reviewing the\r\ndevelopments in the industry, we have decided to extend the coverage\r\nof the interest rate caps to a larger group of lower income borrowers.\r\nWe are conscious that in doing so, there may now be some borrowers\r\nto whom licensed moneylenders may not be willing to lend at the\r\nregulated rates. So this move, which ultimately is a judgement call, is\r\nnot without its trade-offs. </p>\r\n                  <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cc750105-c2cb-4245-9dba-8718eefc46ce\">\r\n                     <a name=\"id-0f4b994a-6cb7-433c-908b-044cda5dbdc7__id-cc750105-c2cb-4245-9dba-8718eefc46ce\"><!--a--></a>Even under the current\r\nframework, there are people who turn to unlicensed moneylenders,\r\nbecause they cannot borrow from legitimate ones. We need to be mindful\r\nthat we do not drive more and more people to unlicensed moneylenders.\r\nWe need to try and\r\ngive protection to borrowers, without creating a situation where borrowers\r\ncannot access credit from licensed moneylenders. This is the balance\r\nwhich we have been trying to fine tune, and will continue to monitor,\r\nto help borrowers, in a way which is practical and feasible.</p>\r\n                  <p class=\"column\">Page: 2512</p>\r\n                  <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a84345bd-1aea-4e81-8209-b69a236cac34\">\r\n                     <a name=\"id-0f4b994a-6cb7-433c-908b-044cda5dbdc7__id-a84345bd-1aea-4e81-8209-b69a236cac34\"><!--a--></a> Third, we are disallowing\r\nthe charging of three fees currently permitted under the Rules,\r\nnamely, for acceptance of the loan application, for acceptance or\r\nrenewal of a revolving credit loan and for any payment not through\r\nelectronic funds transfer. These fees are typically charged up-front\r\nby moneylenders. These fees make the cost of borrowing less transparent\r\nand make it harder for borrowers to compare loan packages. These\r\nfees also increase borrowing costs.</p>\r\n                  <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-37bd6f0b-8390-458e-80bc-27a7f2b4b39c\">\r\n                     <a name=\"id-0f4b994a-6cb7-433c-908b-044cda5dbdc7__id-37bd6f0b-8390-458e-80bc-27a7f2b4b39c\"><!--a--></a> Apart from these three\r\nfees, there are six conditional fees permitted under the Rules. These\r\nfees can be charged only if certain conditions arise, for example,\r\nupon borrowers breaching or varying the loan contract. These will\r\ncontinue to be permitted. </p>\r\n                  <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-318c1240-1091-4227-9414-2f38cda470f3\">\r\n                     <a name=\"id-0f4b994a-6cb7-433c-908b-044cda5dbdc7__id-318c1240-1091-4227-9414-2f38cda470f3\"><!--a--></a>Fourth, we are disallowing\r\nall exceptions to the limits on the amount of unsecured loans that\r\na borrower can obtain. The limits to loan quantum serve to prevent\r\nexcessive borrowing. However, these exceptions allow individuals\r\nto borrow more than the loan quantum caps stipulated in the Moneylenders\r\nRules. For example, borrowers with an annual income of $20,000 or\r\nless are not allowed to take unsecured loans of more than $3,000.\r\nHowever, the exceptions have allowed such borrowers to borrow more\r\nthan $3,000, when they borrow for purposes, such as business or\r\nrenovation. The exceptions also allow moneylenders to impose interest\r\nrates beyond the stipulated interest rate caps. These exceptions\r\ncan lead to borrowers taking on excessive debt. As such, we are disallowing\r\nthese exceptions.</p>\r\n                  <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9fc6185b-cd7a-43ee-a415-c691846861ec\">\r\n                     <a name=\"id-0f4b994a-6cb7-433c-908b-044cda5dbdc7__id-9fc6185b-cd7a-43ee-a415-c691846861ec\"><!--a--></a> Sir, these amendments\r\nto the Rules have been approved, but will take effect only on 1\r\nJune 2012, to give the industry sufficient time to adjust to the\r\nchanges. </p>\r\n                  <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-61b85f27-f3e2-49ba-ac9d-053f860efe82\">\r\n                     <a name=\"id-0f4b994a-6cb7-433c-908b-044cda5dbdc7__id-61b85f27-f3e2-49ba-ac9d-053f860efe82\"><!--a--></a>Sir, I should also share\r\nwith the House that my Ministry has recently set up an Advisory\r\nCommittee on Moneylending Issues (ACMI), which I am chairing.

These are to: inspect the premise where\r\na moneylender is carrying on his business and the documents kept\r\nthere, require the moneylender or any other person to furnish any\r\ndocuments, copy any documents inspected and take photographs or\r\nvideo recording of the premises inspected.</p>\r\n                  <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4fce53ab-c6cb-481b-9723-996e198dcb0d\">\r\n                     <a name=\"id-0f4b994a-6cb7-433c-908b-044cda5dbdc7__id-4fce53ab-c6cb-481b-9723-996e198dcb0d\"><!--a--></a> Assoc Prof Fatimah talked\r\nabout the need for educating the population on moneylending and\r\nthis is something that we agree very much with her.

With your cooperation, we have managed to end the debate,\r\nI think in quite good time. Indeed, as the Leader has highlighted,\r\nit was the first Budget of the Twelfth Parliament and it set a positive\r\ntone. It maps out this Government's initiatives to prepare our country\r\nfor the many challenges that lie ahead. These include the need to\r\nrestructure our economy and to prepare for an ageing population.\r\nI am heartened that the Budget contains measures to strengthen our\r\nsocial support and inclusiveness for all Singaporeans and, especially,\r\nthose that are less advantaged, from entrenching various rebates\r\nthrough GST Vouchers to enhancing the means by which our seniors\r\ncan remain active, healthy and employed.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-21b80864-5653-4c15-a761-ff64af1a459f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-21b80864-5653-4c15-a761-ff64af1a459f\"><!--a--></a>On the whole, the debate\r\nwas lively and the speeches were thoughtful and of high calibre\r\n\u2013 and, indeed, that had kept me so attentive.
