The results showed that both estates have exceeded the minimum of 75% support which is required: 93% in Gillman Heights and 79% in Pine Grove. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB is now executing the processes required for the privatisation of these two estates. As these are pilot projects, HDB needs some time to establish the working procedures with the various agencies involved in the processes. HDB expects \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> that the date these two estates will be legally transformed to private estates to be in August 1996. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the keen interest by some HUDC residents to privatise their estates, HDB has decided to bring forward additional HUDC estates for the privatisation exercise in 1996. They will be split into two batches. The first batch for 1996 will be Jurong East, Hougang South, Lakeview and Farrer Court Estates. The second batch for 1996 will be announced in the middle of next year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the privatisation of Shunfu Estate, HDB will take note of the interest expressed by the residents there when it designates other HUDC estates for the privatisation exercise in the subsequent batches. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Thomson GRC):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether he has any idea as to when Shunfu estate will be privatised? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in selecting the various estates for privatisation, HDB considers the following three criteria. (1) the age of the estate; (2) the support expressed by the residents through their Advisor; and (3) a mix of Phase I and II as well as Phase III and IV estates so as to even out the workload. For Shunfu estate, I believe it is under Phase III and so it will be among the earlier batches. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> After the announcement of the privatisation exercise, those residents in Phase III and IV HUDC estates who applied for HDB flats have been asked to take out their applications from the HDB flat registration list. Could I ask the Minister whether he could reconsider this policy? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have explained in this House before, residents in Phase III and IV HUDC estates were in an anomalous situation before the announcement of this change in policy. Before this change, they were allowed to apply for HDB flats without having to pay a levy, whereas HDB flat owners have to do so. At the same time, they did not have to wait for a 30-month period, whereas \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Phase I and II HUDC flat owners have to comply with it. To change the situation, the HDB could decide either to put them together with the HDB flat owners, in which case we ought to impose a levy, or at the same time classify them together with the Phase I and II HUDC flat owners, in which case we have to impose a 30-month debarment period. HDB decided that, for the purposes of application of new HDB flats, it would treat them the same as those in Phase I and II HUDC estates, ie, impose a 30-month debarment period. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>DRY MARKETS IN HDB ESTATES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for National Development whether it is the Government's intention to phase out all neighbourhood dry markets in Housing and Development Board estates. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, HDB does not have plans to phase out all the existing dry markets in HDB housing estates. These dry markets were built from 1982 to 1992 to replace the wet markets which at that time were found to be messy and unhygienic, caused primarily by poultry slaughtering. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we commonly refer to as dry markets are actually market-produce shops, meant to be operated within the shop in a dry and clean manner, in accordance with the standards set by the Ministry of the Environment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, over the years, many market-produce shops have become wet, messy and dirty.

Expert advice is given to the parents by the paediatrician soon after birth. The advice is related to the overall care that the child requires and for associated problems found, like congenital heart defects. All Down's Syndrome children are also referred to the hospital's Medical Social Worker for placement in special schools and for other specialised services that the children require. Medical problems detected are followed up by paediatricians in the hospitals. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School Health Services carry out immunization and annual medical checkups, including eye-screening, on Down's Syndrome children attending the special schools in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down's Syndrome children together with other mentally handicapped children are provided with special education either at the five MINDS (Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore) or the three AESN (Association for Educationally Subnormal Children) schools.

When an NSman is absent from a particular training programme, the effectiveness of his unit is reduced. Unit cohesion is also degraded. As a result, operational readiness suffers. MINDEF therefore does not grant deferment from in-camp training unless there are good and valid reasons for such deferment. Applications for deferment are considered on the merits of each case.

There is no similar provision for the case where the child's mother is a Singaporean. I should point out that even under Article 122(1), it does not confer such a right absolutely to a child born of a Singaporean father. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain. Firstly, the conferment of citizenship by descent is conditional upon the child being registered within one year of his birth. Secondly, if the child's father is a citizen by descent, that is, he is not a citizen by birth or by registration, then the child has no such right to be given Singapore citizenship. Thirdly, if the child, through his birth, acquires a foreign citizenship and his father is a citizen by registration, then the child also has no such right. In other words, the grant of citizenship to a child born of a Singaporean father by descent is not absolute. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historical wisdom has decided that conferment of citizenship by descent be through one party and that party is the father. Just as it is customary today for the child's surname to follow that of the father, I do not see any real practical reason why nationality should not be passed on only through the father. If we change the Constitution, as suggested by Dr Soin, then we may have a situation where, depending on where the child is born and the nationality of his father, the child can end up having two or even three nationalities at birth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practical situation today is that our Constitution provides a ready channel for such children to be citizens by registration. These children are not deprived of a chance to be Singaporeans, like their mothers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, therefore, of the view that we should leave the Constitution as it is as this has served us well in the spirit of our tradition which we should preserve. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, would the Minister confirm that if the Singaporean mother came to Singapore and had the baby in Singapore, then the baby would become a Singapore citizen?

Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in July 1994, with the agreement of the Chief Justice, I set up a Conveyancing Fees Review Committee headed by Justice Chao Hick Tin to examine whether it was in the public interest to: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) retain, modify or abolish the existing fixed fee scale for non-contentious conveyancing matters; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) make such recommendations as the Committee considers appropriate in the circumstances. \n  <br>\n  <br>Other members of the Committee were two senior advocates and solicitors, the Registrar of Titles &amp; Deeds, and a representative each from the Law Society, the Association of Banks in Singapore, CASE, the Finance Houses Association of Singapore, and the Real Estate Developers Association of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee carefully considered the views of members of the public, CASE, the Law Society of Singapore, the Association of Banks in Singapore and the Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee submitted its report to me earlier this year. Its main recommendation is to retain a system of mandatory fixed fee scale for all transactions up to and including $5 million (which, on statistics then available to the Committee, covered more than 99% of all transactions) but they recommended that the scale of fees be lowered by between \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 20</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 13.95% and 30.68% depending on the value of the transaction. The Committee also recommended a fee scale for transactions between $5 million and $20 million (which in fact constitute less than 1% of the total transactions) but that this scale be used only as a guide. Fees for transactions above $20 milion, which of course are very few, would be entirely free for negotiation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee sought to strike a fair balance between the interest of consumers and those of the profession and took into account the concerns of different segments of our society. Their recommendations are balanced and reasonable and should bring down the overall legal costs of purchasing a property for the vast majority of Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Justice and Attorney-General agree with the Committee's recommendations. The Committee considered whether to abolish scale fees altogether, but concluded that, at this point in time, it is in the public interest to retain a mandatory fixed scale fee. However, it recognises that this is a matter which will have to be reviewed in the light of changing circumstances, and that a further review at a future date may well be necessary. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry accepts the Committee's recommendation as a reasonable and practical transitional arrangement. But in logic and principle, I agree with CASE that a fixed scale is an anachronism in a free market economy such as Singapore's. But, Sir, I believe that there is merit in taking a gradual approach, instead of making a sudden drastic change to the existing system. Let me say, however, Sir, that the complete abolition of scale fees is a matter of time, and the legal profession should use this time to prepare itself for the free market. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied GRC):</b> Can the Minister tell us when will the recommendation be implemented?

As to the complete abolition of scale fees, as I have said, I am in favour of a gradual approach.

Ideally speaking, there should be just one category for motorcycles. However, if there is cause for us to change, we will certainly make the necessary changes, bearing in mind the fact that we have to be fair to all other categories of road users and we have to make sure that the limited road space that we have is optimally used. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I do not think the Minister has answered my question.

Did the Ministry \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 23</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> also apply the same principle to motorcars based on engine capacity or based on how much road space the motorcar is occupying? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, as I said, strictly speaking, there should be only one category. It applies to cars as well as to motorcycles. But for equity reasons, we have decided that we have to split the COEs for motorcars into various categories in order to make sure that the small car and big car owners have a fair chance of competing. One could argue that this similarly applies to motorcycles. At this stage, there is no reason for us to make any changes, but we are monitoring the situation very carefully. As to whether the motorcycle COEs are high or not, at this stage, the motorcycle COE premium is about one quarter that of the premium for a small car, even though a motorcycle occupies, on a moving basis, much more than one quarter of the road space occupied by a car. Whether the motorcycle COE is high or not high is at this stage a moot point. We will have to take into account all factors into consideration before we make the adjustments. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, why is it not justified to make changes to the motorcycle COEs at this stage? Is it because the COE price for motorcycles is still too low to make the change? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I do not know what the Member means by \"low\", Sir? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Why is it that there is no justification for a change? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the categorisation of motorcycle COEs into various categories is not the main determinant of the price. It is determined by, first of all, how much road space a motorcycle occupies. Secondly, what is the demand for road space? In other words, what is the demand for the number of COEs that we issue? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has fixed the number of COEs that are being issued every month. It allows an increase based on what it feels is sustainable in order to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> make sure that our roads are not congested. We just fix the supply. Having fixed the supply, then it is up to the demand to determine the price. That is on an overall basis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is whether we should segment them into various categories. There are reasons for us to segment the car COEs into various categories. Similar reasons could apply to motorcycles but at this stage we do not feel that there is a necessity for us to segment it. The Member asked when will that stage be. I can honestly say that I do not know. I will monitor the situation and I will make the necessary decision at the appropriate time. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Minister says that there was a need to segment the car COEs into different categories, probably because of affordability of people who need cars. What about motorcycles? Why is it that the same principle does not apply to the motorcycle COEs? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I did not say that the same principle does not apply to motorcycle COEs. I am saying that it could very well apply to motorcycle COEs. However, this is not the appropriate time for us to make the decision just yet. The prices for motorcycle COEs, as far as we have been monitoring it, have only recently started to move. We will make sure that the situation is kept well under control. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, is the Minister saying that motorcycle COE prices will not move up further, since he says that it will be kept under control? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> No, Sir, I certainly did not say that. The Member is misquoting me. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, it would appear to me that it is inequitable since motorcycle prices vary so much, if you buy a 50 cc Honda Cub and you buy a big Harley Davidson costing $40,000-$50,000, and the COE costs $4,000. Do you not think that it is inequitable? The inequity is so clear cut. I do not know the price of a Honda Cub. It is probably under $2,000. If you buy a Harley Davidson, it costs $40,000-$50,000, and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> you pay $4,000 for the COE. There is an extreme inequity between the people who are buying small motorcycles and the big ones. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, what is the question? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The question is: is it not time to have different categories of COEs for motorcycles? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> We are reviewing the situation.

Out of these 42 stations, two of the stations can be considered as weak. In other words, the daily patronage of these stations is very low. They are the Marina Bay and the Chinese Garden Stations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marina Bay Station was built despite the low patronage because it is essential for the operations of the North-South line. The Station serves as a terminal station where south-bound trains turn back to head north. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the North-East Line study, the consultants evaluated the proposed stations based on the projected morning peak hour passenger flow. The consultants projected that the proposed Potong Pasir Station will have a flow of 1,400 during the morning peak. This is about 14% less than the morning peak hour flow at the Chinese Garden Station. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ker Sin Tze:</b> Sir, many residents in Paya Lebar do not understand why they should pay higher fares for the North-East line. Would the Minister explain the rationale for the proposed higher fares for the North-East line? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the proposal to charge different fares for different lines has raised considerable interest. There have been mixed reactions. Some have considered it unfair. Others have counter proposed that fares should be raised across the board rather than specifically for the North-East line. I must say that the reactions were not surprising to me because, after all, if given a choice, who would want to pay more. But I take this opportunity to urge those people who reacted spontaneously to view this proposal in the overall context of building a massive project like the North-East line. And if they think through the issues involved again, I believe they will understand that it is not unfair, as originally thought. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the issues involved? The first is that the Government is committed to spending $5 billion to build the North-East Line. The people in the north-east are finally getting closer to their dream of getting the MRT. Yes, they have to wait in the queue, but there are many other areas of Singapore which are not even in the queue as yet. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue really is: when do we start to build? When do we start work? The Government must have a rational basis for making such decisions, especially decisions which involve such a huge amount of money. In the case of the MRT extension, such a basis is that Government will build and pass on to the operator to run when the line is well used. The question is: how do we assess when it \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> is well used? It is well used when the operator is able to recover the running cost of the system, in other words, labour cost, electricity cost, cost of maintenance and repairs and the cost of putting aside some money to buy the next set of trains. This is not a new condition. This is a condition that the Government has applied to the existing lines and also to the Woodlands extension. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, in the case of the North-East Line, our consultants' study shows that the North-East Line can only meet this criterion of meeting the operating cost, not the capital cost, not immediately but in four years' time. So we have a choice. Either we wait four years or we find a way to start work sooner. How? By finding ways and means of improving this condition sooner. My Ministry is now looking at different ways to see how we can meet this condition earlier. If we succeed, we can bring the MRT to the North-East earlier. If we cannot, then we have no choice but to wait four years. This is where the different fare proposals come in. It was one of the proposals that we received. It is a proposal that I surfaced at one of the dialogue sessions that I had with some residents and grassroots leaders. It is one possible way for us to bring the MRT forward. There are other ways. One other possibility could be to defer construction of some of the weaker stations. We will consider all proposals. We will settle the final package soon. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the North-East line is built now or later will depend not only on the Government but also on the people who will benefit from the line. It is based on the principle of partnership between the Government and the people. The Government undertakes to pay for the capital cost of the MRT line while the people agree to pay for the operating cost of the line. This is a win-win formula because the Government can then upgrade and improve the public transport service and, in the process, keep our traffic flowing, and therefore enhance our national productivity and effectiveness. The people can then enjoy a major \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> upgrading of their quality of life and enhancement of their assets. It is a win-win situation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will not be the last MRT extension we will build. On the contrary, I hope that there will be not only MRT but also light rail transit (LRT) lines serving other parts of Singapore. It is therefore all the more important that we establish now a fair and workable principle to determine where and when we build our next MRT or LRT line. So I hope that residents, Members of Parliament and grassroots leaders see this proposal in the overall context of what we are trying to do to enhance and improve our public transport system. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Is the Minister saying that if residents living along the North-East line agree to pay, let us say, 20 cents more, as proposed by the Minister, the Government will immediately build the line? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, one of the problems that we are facing in building the line now is the operating deficit. If we can work out, and if the people using the line can agree to paying a fare - I do not know how much more it would be - that will help to meet that operating deficit, then a major condition would have been met. The 20 cents more that I have suggested is a ball park figure. I do not know the exact number. We are now working out the numbers. I do not expect it to be more than that. However, it could be less than that. I am not sure of the exact number yet, but we will finalise the package soon and then we will present it for the information of the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Braddell Heights):</b> Can I ask the Minister that if the proposal is accepted, will there be a time frame for this higher fare? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the general principle is that fares should cover direct operating cost. So as long as the fares cover the direct operating cost, then those fares will hold. I guess the Member is asking whether the higher fares will hold for a certain amount of time. I cannot answer that question explicitly. All I can say is that the general principle that the Public Transport Council adheres to in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> approving fares is to ensure that the fares are affordable and yet high enough to allow the operator to cover its direct operating cost plus, of course, make a reasonable return on its capital. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> I appreciate that the basis for the Minister's position would be the user-pay principle and also no subsidy for operating cost. Would the Minister care to respond to two alternative principles? One is, instead of user-pay, to have a cross-payment and, secondly, instead of having no subsidy for operating cost, what about having a temporary subsidy for operating cost? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the first proposal is one that has been made previously. It is a proposal that is obviously attractive to the potential users of the North-East line. However, I think we may have a different reaction when we put this proposal to all other users of the MRT system. That is the first point. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is really that, as we expand the MRT system, we are going to face more and more the question of viability of each new line. If we were to operate on the principle that the new extension will be viable in its own right, then the chances of us expanding the MRT system will be that much better. If we were to go by the other principle of spreading the cost to all MRT users every time we expand the line, then I am afraid that the support for any new extension will be that much less. This is, however, another alternative that we could use. The experience that we have had every time we have to increase fares is that the PTC has to make sure that there is full justification for it. It is obviously easier to justify if the subsidy is kept within that particular extension rather than spread out across the whole system. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Who pays for the deficit at the two weak stations at Marina Bay and Chinese Garden? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> As I said, the Marina Bay Station is necessary because it is part and parcel of the operations of the existing North-South, East-West line. We need to have a station for the trains to turn \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> back. We cannot be turning back the trains at the last station, which is Raffles City. Therefore, the station at Marina Bay has to be built, otherwise the system does not work. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The cost is spread out then. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> That cost is part and parcel of the cost of operating the North-South, East-West line. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Are there other weak stations for the North-East line from the section at World Trade Centre to Little India? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> As I have explained to the Member, the weakest station along this particular line is the proposed station located somewhere around Potong Pasir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San GRC):</b> What the people living along the North-East corridor want to know is whether the line will come early or not. The Minister himself had said just now that they could not commit. But I want to ask the Minister, since he has stated in public that he sees merit in the line coming early, whether he would personally state publicly that he and his Ministry support the building of the MRT line at the earliest possible moment, ie, as soon as possible. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I have already mentioned in public that having looked at the transportation problems in that particular corridor, there is merit in building that line as soon as possible. However, I recognise that because of the high cost involved, I have to make a very strong case to particularly the Minister for Finance, because we have a criterion that needs to be met. Unless there are very, very strong reasons why that condition does not have to be met, then I think it is prudent for us to make sure that that particular condition, which is a very fair condition, is met in the case of the North-East line. As I said, this is a condition that has been applied to the existing MRT system. It is a condition that has been applied to the Woodlands extension. I think it is very fair for this same condition to be applied to the North-East line. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, the fact that the North-East line is next in line for an MRT system is a strong indication that the Government is committed to building the North-East line. It is in the queue. It is now a question of when we start work. I personally would like to see it start earlier because this would ease the congestion and enhance the public transport system in the area. We have, however, to make sure that the operating cost condition is met. This is a condition which is a very fundamental and fair one. This is a condition we will apply to other extensions as well. If we can find a way to meet this condition for the North-East line, then we will have the MRT to the North-East earlier than we expect. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> If the ridership of the North-East line increases after four years when the place is built up, would the Government reduce the fare? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the fare will be set by what is possible to keep the MRT viable. It is not a question of reducing the fare. By that stage, depending on how the cost is, the fare may well be kept steady. So it is really a reflection of what the cost is going to be at that time. In the first few years, we know that the line will not be viable. So the fares may have to be higher. In subsequent years, it may well be that the fares need not be raised. That is a possibility, but I am not in a position at this stage to commit what the fares would be. The basic principle of setting fares that the PTC has used so far is to make sure that the fares are not so high as to allow the operator to make exorbitant profits but enough to allow the operator to have a reasonable return on his capital, ie, cover his operating cost plus a return on his capital. So what the fare level would be then, I am not in a position to say. But I do know that based on the existing fare structure, it is not possible for us to cover the direct operating cost or to meet the condition that I mentioned earlier for the first couple of years. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Will the Minister not consider having a subsidy to cover \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> operating cost, after all the projections do show that this is temporary? In terms of the provision of a public good, I think it is entirely in order for the Government, where the provision of a public good for the good of society is concerned, actually to subsidise part of the cost of the provision of the public good. In this case, it would be temporary in terms of covering the operating cost. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, let me point out that it is not just a question of covering the direct operating cost on a temporary basis. If we were to build the line earlier, there is an opportunity cost. This opportunity cost is a real cost. It is a cost for us to build or to spend something earlier than what we should be spending. In the case of the North-East line, the total expenditure for the North-East line is going to be something like $5 billion. The opportunity cost for this is going to be enormous. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the alternatives? The alternatives could well be that we use the savings from the opportunity cost in some other way. The amount could be used for implementing perhaps another CPF Top-up scheme. It is the same order of magnitude that we are talking about. Therefore, it is not just the direct operating cost but also the opportunity cost that we have to consider. So the passing mark or the hurdle rate for building an MRT extension is a very simple one of meeting the direct operating cost. It can be met very simply. As I said, one of the possibilities is to defer construction of weak stations. Another possibility is, rather than using the existing fare structure, to consider whether another fare structure might be possible to meet that deficit. \n  <br>1.30 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to amend the Act to update the compensation for land acquired under the Act. Compensation for land gazetted for acquisition on or after 27th September 1995 will be assessed at the market value as at 1st January 1995 or the date of the gazette notification, whichever is lower. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the Land Acquisition Act, compensation for land acquired on or after 18th January 1993 was assessed at 1st January 1992 value, or the market value on the date of the gazette notification of acquisition, whichever was lower. Prior to the last amendment in 1993, compensation for land acquired before 30th November 1987 was assessed at 30th November 1973 value and land acquired on or after 30th November 1987 was assessed at 1st January 1986 value, or the market value at the date of the gazette notification, whichever was lower. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment, like the 1993 amendment, is to improve the compensation award for lands which are acquired in the future. It recognises that land values have appreciated considerably since the last amendment in 1993. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment is consistent with the Government's policy to review periodically the compensation for land acquired for public purposes, as has been done before. In keeping with its policy of paying fair compensation, Government has also announced recently that owner-occupiers of acquired residential properties who have no other residential property will be eligible for increased ex-gratia payment. For cases affected by this amendment, the total compensation, that is, statutory compensation plus ex-gratia payment has been raised from $600,000 to $1.8 million or the market value of the property, whichever is lower. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Prof. S.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main purpose of these amendments to the Patents Act 1994 is to bring the Act into conformity with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the House enacted the Patents Act 1994 last year, some representators in Select Committee mentioned that a few provisions in the Act were not consistent with TRIPS. At the third reading of the Patents Bill in October 1994, the Minister for Law informed the House that as TRIPS provisions impacted not just on Patents legislation but other areas as well, Government would undertake a comprehensive review of our various Intellectual Property Rights laws to bring them in line with our obligations under TRIPS. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, an Inter-Ministry Committee comprising representatives from the relevant Ministries and agencies involved with TRIPS was formed to review our intellectual property rights legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of this review, the Committee considered the Patents legislation in the light of recent developments in other jurisdictions with particular regard to the following: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Whether the compulsory licensing provisions, especially in the area of food, medicine and medical devices were too broad; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Whether the provisions on government use were too broad; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Our policy to allow parallel imports. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has recommended certain amendments to the existing provisions of the Act. The proposed amendments seek to repeal sections 55 to 60 of the Act and re-enact section 55 in its place. The existing provisions relate to compulsory licensing, ie, the application, grounds, issue and review of any grant. The new section 55 clarifies the situations where a grant of a compulsory licence for a patented invention may be made. The purpose of a licence is to ensure that the patentee's interest in obtaining an appropriate return on his investment is balanced with the need to maintain safeguards against the misuse of a monopoly right provided by the patent. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment provides that any person interested may apply to the court for the grant of a licence under the patent at any time after the expiration of 3 years from the date of grant or 4 years from the date of filing of the patent application, whichever is the later. The grounds for doing so are that a market for the patented invention is not being supplied or is not supplied on reasonable terms. An application for a compulsory licence is made to the Court instead of the Registrar of Trade Marks and Patents. This amendment would provide the rightholder with sufficient time to work the invention before a compulsory licence can be granted. This is also the legislative practice in Australia and New Zealand. These amendments are made to conform to Article 31 of TRIPS. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, amendments have also been made to government use of patented inventions. These will be effected by repealing sections 61, 62 and 65 of the Act and enacting new sections 61, 65 and 65A, 65B and 65C. Consequential amendments are also made to sections 63 and 64. The new sections provide that any government department or authorised person may use any patented invention for the service of the government without the consent of the patentee in the following three circumstances -- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) in situations of national emergency; \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) other circumstances of extreme urgency; or \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) in cases of public non-commercial use. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the above exceptions, government use is subject to the requirements of making reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the patentee on reasonable commercial terms and failing to do so within a reasonable period of time. These amendments are made to conform to Article 31 of TRIPS. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, other amendments in the Bill include the deletion of section 13(2) of the Act. Section 13(2) is a short and non-exhaustive listing of subjects which are considered non-patentable, eg, a discovery or mathematical model. The deletion of section 13(2) is intended to conform to Article 27(3) of TRIPS which does not provide for such a listing. Consequential amendments are also made to section 13(5) and section 30(3)(b). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this deletion will not limit our flexibility in rejecting any subject matter which is non-patentable under section 13(1). The existing provisions are sufficient to enable Singapore to keep up with advances and changes in science and technology. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, section 67(1) on the powers of the court in infringement proceedings is amended to empower the court to forfeit and destroy any material and implement (ie, instrument), the predominant use of which has been in the creation of the infringing product. This amendment is made to conform to Article 46 of TRIPS. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has decided that no amendments to the existing provisions on parallel imports are necessary as these provisions are not inconsistent with TRIPS. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of drafting these amendments, we have taken into account the views of interested organisations such as the Singapore Association of Pharmaceutical Industries, who were consulted. They were generally in favour of the amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Assoc.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to amend the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68) ('CPC') to allow certain witnesses to give evidence and remanded accused persons to make formal applications, through live video or television links. This will render it unnecessary for such witnesses and remanded accused persons to be physically present in Court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Justice in his Keynote Address at this year's Subordinate Courts Workplan Seminar spoke of the need to protect child witnesses and adult witnesses in sexual assault cases from the traumatic experience of giving evidence in Court. Under existing law, witnesses giving evidence must testify in Court in the presence of the accused. The Chief Justice pointed out that, in some Commonwealth jurisdictions, child witnesses and victims of assault or abuse cases are removed from the court room to give evidence by video link so as to shield them from direct confrontation with the accused. He added that bail-related applications for accused persons in remand could also be done through the same procedure. This would save the time and expense of transporting such persons to Court and avoid the need to make heavy security arrangements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to elaborate, the proposed amendment involves the introduction of a new section 364A which seeks to achieve the following. First, allow witnesses in Singapore, but not accused persons, to give evidence via live video or television link in criminal proceedings in specified \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> circumstances, eg, where the witnesses are children (that is, under 16 years old) or victims of sexual offences or where the offence is one involving assault or injury; and, second, allow an accused person on remand to 'appear' before the Court via live video or television link for bail-related and remand extension applications. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, leave of the Court is required before evidence via live video or television link is allowed. The safeguard here is that the Court would not grant an application if to do so would be inconsistent with its duty to ensure that the proceedings are conducted fairly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out that this amendment does not provide for foreign witnesses to give evidence in Singapore via this procedure. Government is concerned that to allow witnesses outside the jurisdiction to give evidence would encourage the giving of false evidence exonerating accused persons. It would be difficult for the Attorney-General to prosecute such persons and it would hamper our enforcement effort against drug traffickers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill was drafted in close consultation with the Attorney-General's Chambers, the Judiciary, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Criminal Investigation Department of the Singapore Police Force and the Prisons Department, all of whom support the proposed amendments. We have studied similar legislation in foreign jurisdictions, eg, UK, Australia, New Zealand and the US and incorporated useful features from these sources where appropriate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Assoc.

The Committee was chaired by the then Minister of State for Labour, Mr Goh Chee Wee. The Committee adopted the following terms of reference: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Review the provisions in the Employment Act which have become irrelevant and not kept pace with the changing needs of employers, workers and the economy; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Review the provisions in the Employment Act which cause rigidities in the labour market and hinder company restructuring; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Recommend changes to the Employment Act to address the issues reviewed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some six months of careful study and thorough discussion, the Tripartite Committee was able to make extensive recommendations to modify and improve the existing Employment Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, Government accepted the recommendations made by the Committee. This Employment (Amendment) Bill has incorporated the Committee's recommendations with some refinements added since the Committee completed its deliberations. The refinements are the result of the extensive feedback received by my Ministry from both employers and unions representing workers regarding the implementation of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> some of the proposed amendments. Consequential amendments to the Industrial Relations Act will also be needed to bring it in line with the amendments to the Employment Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments in this Bill will bring the provisions of the employment and industrial relations laws up-to-date. By passing this Bill, you will help to make our employment laws more responsive to the changing economic and business conditions and better suited to future developments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will note that this Bill covers many areas. Since the technical and minor details of the Bill have already been covered in the Explanatory Statement to the Bill, I propose to address only the key issues. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>New definitions and applications of rate of pay</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me deal with the new definitions and applications of rate of pay. Clause 2 of the Bill introduces two new definitions - \"basic rate of pay\" and \"gross rate of pay\" to replace the existing \"rate of pay\" and \"ordinary rate of pay\" used in the current Employment Act for the purpose of computing statutory payments. This arose from the Tripartite Committee's recommendation to rationalise the basis for computing statutory payments to employees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two new definitions of \"basic rate of pay\" and \"gross rate of pay\" will provide a clear and unambiguous basis for payment for overtime work, work on rest day or public holiday and payment for approved leave. This amendment will prevent unnecessary disputes between employers and employees on the types of allowances which should be included for the purpose of computing the various statutory payments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the proposed amendment, \"basic rate of pay\" refers to the total remuneration excluding all allowances, overtime payment, bonus, annual wage supplement, reimbursement of special expenses and productivity incentive payments. The \"basic rate of pay\" shall be used to calculate payment for overtime \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> work under clause 13, work on a rest day under clause 12, and for payment on a public holiday under clause 15. The rationale for paying only the basic rate of pay for these occasions is that, under the current law, employees are already entitled to a higher rate of compensation for overtime work and work on rest day or public holiday. For example, an employer is required to pay an employee a minimum of 1.5 times the hourly rate of pay for overtime work and 2 days' pay for work on a rest day. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second new definition \"gross rate of pay\" refers to the total remuneration including allowances except for overtime payments, bonus payments, annual wage supplement, travelling, food and housing allowances, reimbursement of special expenses and productivity incentive payments. It shall be used as a basis for computing payment in lieu of notice of termination under clause 3, salary deduction for absence from work under clause 8, payment for public holidays under clause 15, annual leave under clause 16, sick leave with hospitalisation under clause 17, and maternity leave under clause 27. The rationale for including allowances for these payments is that employees should not suffer a cut in their normal expected income as these are benefits earned in the course of their employment and their absence from work had been sanctioned or approved by their employers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Sick leave where hospitalisation is not necessary</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of outpatient sick leave, the Tripartite Review Committee originally proposed that allowances should also be paid. However, employers have expressed concern that granting shift allowance to workers who are on outpatient sick leave would defeat the purpose of this allowance which is to motivate them to come to work on unpopular shifts. This is particularly so in the case of process industries which pay a sizeable shift allowance to ensure that their employees do not absent themselves from work when they are scheduled to work on unpopular shifts. While going on sick \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> leave is a valid reason for an employee to stay away from work, there is concern that if this becomes rampant and workers stay away at the slightest feeling of discomfort, it would cause severe disruption to the shift work schedule. It would also be unfair if such workers continue to receive their shift allowance while their more responsible colleagues have to cover their duties in their absence. Replacements may also be necessary and the employer may have difficulty in getting relief workers at the last minute, apart from having to incur additional cost. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to address such concern, clause 17 will allow shift allowance to be excluded as a statutory payment for workers on outpatient sick leave. Notwithstanding this, employers and employees or their unions could work out mutually agreeable rules under which the workers could still be paid their shift allowance when they are on outpatient sick leave. My Ministry, together with NTUC and SNEF, has formulated a set of tripartite guidelines regarding the circumstances under which employees should be paid their shift allowance while on outpatient sick leave. For example, an employee who is diagnosed to have contracted an infectious disease would have to stay away from work and therefore should not be penalised for taking outpatient sick leave. The guidelines will be issued by my Ministry after the Bill has been passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Recovery of compensation for unfair dismissal</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 4 introduces a new subsection 7A to section 14 to enable the Court to recover compensation due to an employee whose employer has been found guilty of failing to comply with a Ministerial Order. This means that a worker who had been wrongfully dismissed would still be able to recover his compensation even if the employer defaults on the Ministerial Order. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Transfer of employees</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the matter of transfer of employees. Clause 6 of the Bill \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> concerns the transfer of employees. In a fast changing business environment, companies may need to restructure their operations to remain competitive. Restructuring could involve the redeployment or transfer of employees to an associated company, a subsidiary or a new company. Currently, the Employment Act allows employers to redeploy their employees within the same company. However, it is silent on the rights and obligations of the employers and employees in the transfer of employees to another company, including an associated company or a subsidiary. The common law viewpoint is that the consent of the affected employees must be sought to effect the transfer as this involves a change of employer which is a different legal entity. This could lead to protracted negotiations between the employers and employees or their union, causing damaging delays to a company's genuine restructuring exercise which could in fact have enhanced the employees' long-term job prospects. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to cite three examples where due to the absence of a clear legal framework on the rights and obligations of employers and employees in a transfer of employees to a different legal entity, protracted negotiations had taken place and company restructuring had been unnecessarily delayed or hindered. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first involved a fairly sizable local group of companies. As part of its business strategy to be more competitive, it decided to restructure its operations and set up a subsidiary to operate part of its supporting services. The restructuring involved the hiving-off of a major supporting service division and resulted in about 3,000 employees having to be transferred to the new subsidiary. However, disputes arose between the employer and the employees and their union on the need to obtain individual employees' consent to be transferred to a separate legal entity within the group. Bear in mind that about 3,000 employees were involved in such a transfer. There were also differences on whether there was redundancy in such a situation and whether compensation should be paid. No agreement could be reached between the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> company and the union on the transfer despite many rounds of negotiations. Come the actual date of the commencement of the new subsidiary, instead of carrying out a transfer, the company had to second the affected employees to the new subsidiary en bloc. And it was almost two years later that a new collective agreement package could be worked out between the company and the union representing the 3,000-odd employees who were transferred. The seconded employees were finally absorbed as the direct employees of the subsidiary. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second example was that of an electronics firm which sold one of its operating divisions to another company. The union of the workers involved objected to the transfer on the ground that the company had no right to sell the business together with the employees without getting their consent. The employees were unhappy that they would be relocated to work at another place which was some distance away from their usual workplace. After much negotiations and considerable delay, the workers finally agreed to the transfer with payment of a relocation incentive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third example involved the acquisition of a company by a larger company. Following the acquisition, the new owner embarked on an exercise to streamline its operations. However, it encountered difficulties in transferring the employees among its various subsidiaries in the group. The group went through much negotiations with the union before a settlement was reached where payments were made to the affected employees in exchange for the right to transfer them to different companies within the group. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from these three examples, Members can see that there is a need to address the legal position on the transfer of employees so that companies which need to restructure to cope with changes in the business conditions and retain their competitiveness could do so expeditiously. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 hence introduces a new legal framework whereby the employment contracts of the employees of the transferor, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ie, the original employer, are transferred together with the transferor's business so that the transferee, ie, the new employer, taking over the business is now legally recognised as the new employer. The transferee shall take on all the rights and liabilities in respect of the employment contracts of the affected employees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 also creates a duty for the transferor to notify affected employees of the transfer as soon as possible. The transferor is also required to state the reasons and the implications of the transfer, as well as the measures which may be adopted in relation to the transfer of employees. To allow time for negotiation between an employer and employees or their union representing these workers to take place, adequate notice of an impending transfer should be given. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while agreeing that the law should permit employees affected by company restructuring to be transferred to another company, we must also protect workers from being deprived of retrenchment benefits under the guise of restructuring. It would be unjust if workers give up their claims for retrenchment benefits only to be transferred to a company which lacks the means to meet its obligations as their new employer. We have therefore provided safeguards to protect workers' interests and to prevent abuse by employers. Firstly, continuity of employment of the affected employees must be preserved. Secondly, their existing terms and conditions of employment remain unchanged. Thirdly, the Commissioner for Labour is empowered under clause 6 to stop or delay the transfer of employees involved or to order the transfer to be on such terms as the Commissioner considers fair. This will effectively provide an avenue for workers or their unions to seek protection from an employer who tries to take advantage of the restructuring provision at workers' expense. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a transfer may involve unionised employees, the Industrial Relations Act will also have to be amended to allow an industrial dispute arising out of a transfer to be resolved through the existing dispute settlement machinery provided in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the Industrial Relations Act. This is provided for under clause 44. As in any industrial matter, a dispute relating to the transfer may be referred for conciliation by the Ministry of Labour and if conciliation fails, for arbitration in the Industrial Arbitration Court (IAC). The IAC may also stop, delay or impose certain terms for the transfer in order to safeguard the interest of the employees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the issue of union recognition after a transfer, clause 6 of the Bill also provides that where a trade union involved has majority representation of the employees of the transferee after the transfer, the transferee would have to recognise the union for the purpose of representing all the employees. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Work on rest day and public holiday</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I come to work on rest day and public holiday. Under the present Employment Act, every employee is entitled to a rest day in each week. What is not explicit is whether a rest day is a paid day. However, a study of the interpretation of \"ordinary rate of pay\" in the existing section 51 will show that a rest day is in fact not a paid day. This has been confirmed by a High Court decision. Clause 11 of the Bill therefore makes it clear and unambiguous that a rest day is a day without pay. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 provides for the amount that is to be paid in respect of work done on a rest day. Presently, section 37 of the Employment Act requires an employer to pay two days' salary to an employee who is asked to work on a rest day. This means that the employer has to pay two days' salary regardless of whether the employee works less than his normal daily working hours on his rest day. This is not in line with the principle that remuneration should be commensurate with actual work done. An alternative would be to pay the employee based on the actual number of hours worked at twice the hourly rate of pay. However, this could also be unfair to some employees if they are required to work for only a few short hours but have to incur costs such as \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> travelling and food expenses, apart from the inconvenience of having to give up a rest day. As recommended by the Tripartite Review Committee, clause 12 provides that the payment for work on a rest day done at the request of the employer shall be: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one day's salary for work up to half the normal daily working hours; or \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two days' salary for work exceeding half and up to the normal daily working hours. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment removes excessive payment for work done on a rest day and, at the same time, favours those employees who are presently paid only at double their actual hours worked. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Restriction of 12 working hours a day</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on clause 14. Clause 14 of the Bill seeks to empower the Minister to exempt an employee or any class of employees from the provision in the Act relating to the maximum number of hours that an employee may work in a day. Under the existing section 38(8), an employee is not permitted to work more than 12 hours in a day, including overtime work, except in circumstances like accidents, or work which is essential to the life of the community or for the purpose of national defence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the law aims to safeguard the employees' welfare, it is too restrictive and does not take into account the different nature of work of employees and the technological advances that have taken place over the years. For example, in the airline industry, the introduction of long-haul international flights exceeding 12 hours means that the cabin crew may on occasions have to work beyond the 12-hour limit as a matter of operational requirement. Under such circumstances, it is therefore not appropriate to apply this 12-hour limit strictly and rigidly to such employees. Clause 14 of the Bill thus empowers the Minister to exempt certain categories of employees from this provision. To safeguard the interests of workers, their health and safety will be considered before any such exemption is granted. Furthermore, appropriate rest breaks will be provided so that exempted workers need not work 12 hours at a stretch. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Qualifying period for sick and annual leave entitlements</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clauses 16 and 17 make amendments to the qualifying period for annual and sick leave entitlements. Presently, the law provides that an employee is entitled to pro-rated annual leave after the completion of his first month of service. In other words, after one month of service with a new employer, the employee is eligible for pro-rated annual leave. The Tripartite Review Committee was of the view that a new employee needs to undergo a period of probation for the purpose of training and learning, and that annual leave should be granted only after the probationary period. Clause 16 of the Bill therefore proposes that an employee must serve an employer for a period of three months before he is eligible for paid annual leave. After the three months' service, the employee will be entitled to pro-rated annual leave calculated from the day he has commenced work with the employer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Tripartite Review Committee had also recommended that the law should be updated to regularise an existing practice of employers to grant paid medical leave to employees upon their confirmation on the job which is usually between three and six months. Clause 17 of the Bill hence shortens the qualifying period for paid sick leave from 12 months to six months' service. In halving the qualifying period, the benefit to the employees is enhanced. Reducing the qualifying period for sick leave benefit to six months will also bring it in line with the six-month qualifying period for maternity benefit. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Provisions to govern part-time employment</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the provisions dealing with part-time employment. Clause 21 deals with part-time employment. The law currently makes no distinction between full-time and part-time employees. This means that part-time employees are, in law, entitled to similar benefits enjoyed by full-time employees under the Employment Act. Employing part-timers will therefore be more costly \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and this could well have deterred employers from employing them, thus reducing the opportunities for the economically inactive to re-enter the job market as part-time workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the proposed amendment, a \"part-time employee\" is defined as one who works less than 30 hours a week or such other number of hours as the Minister may prescribe. Most countries do not have a clear statutory definition of \"part-time workers\", but for the purpose of their national labour force surveys, part-time workers are commonly defined as those who work less than 30 hours a week. My Ministry also uses this 30-hour criterion in its Labour Force Surveys to identify part-time workers. The aim of clause 21 is therefore to facilitate part-time employment so that more employment opportunities could be created for housewives and retirees who wish to rejoin the workforce. Currently, part-time workers in Singapore only constitute some 3% of the total workforce which shows that there is still much room for improvement in this area. And we need to encourage employers to create more part-time jobs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1990, the Ministry has set out guidelines on part-time employment. These guidelines were drawn up after consultations with the National Trades Union Congress and the Singapore National Employers Federation. Statutory benefits such as annual leave, public holidays and maternity leave are prescribed in the guidelines based on the principle of pro-rating, taking into account a part-time employee's total contractual working hours compared to that of a full-time employee. The guidelines therefore take into consideration the need to safeguard the basic benefits of part-time workers while providing employers the flexibility to make greater use of part-time employment schemes. Employers are also allowed to encash certain benefits such as annual leave and public holiday entitlements. The tripartite guidelines have been implemented smoothly since 1990. Both employers and employees have no difficulties accepting the guidelines as they are based on equitable principles. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 thus empowers the Minister to make regulations pertaining to part-time employment. Upon enactment, the Ministry's intention is to have the 1990 guidelines legislated as regulations to govern part-time employment. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Employment of children in industrial undertakings</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to employment of children in industrial undertakings. Clauses 24 to 26 amend the Employment Act pertaining to the employment of children. Presently, under section 69 of the Employment Act, no children below the age of 14 is allowed to be employed in any industrial undertaking which the Minister declares to be an industrial undertaking in which no child shall be employed. This would mean that apart from the industrial undertakings which have been explicitly prohibited from employing such children, other industrial undertakings can employ them. To safeguard the interests of children, the Employment of Children and Young Persons Regulations under the Employment Act disallow them from being employed in any industrial undertaking without the written permission of the Commissioner for Labour. A related provision in the law also allows exceptions to be made to children working under apprenticeship schemes approved and supervised by the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members of this House have pointed out on previous occasions that such provisions are no longer relevant as children below the age of 14 years are now either pursuing their studies in schools or undergoing vocational training in the Institute of Technical Education. The Commissioner has also never approved applications for children to work in any industrial undertaking. In fact, the number of such applications had dropped from 12 in 1990 to six in 1992 and only three in 1994. None of these applications had been approved. Currently, trainees under the Institute of Technical Education's apprenticeship programmes are also all above the age of 14. The Government has \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> therefore decided to remove the power of the Commissioner for Labour to grant such exemptions. By doing so, the employment of children below the age of 14 years to work in industrial undertakings will be completely prohibited and will serve as a clear signal that Singapore does not tolerate or condone child labour. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Commissioner's power to inquire into disputes</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 38 removes the restriction on the Commissioners's jurisdiction to inquire into disputes only in respect of employees earning a monthly salary not exceeding $1,600. The Tripartite Review Committee was of the view that there is an anomaly in the existing Act in that while an employee who is earning a monthly salary of more than $1,600 is covered by the Act, he could not have his dispute adjudicated by the Commissioner for Labour. Currently, the Ministry could only help these employees to conciliate their disputes with their employers. However, if conciliation fails, the only recourse open to the aggrieved party is to take the case up in the civil courts on their own. This is costly and may be beyond the means of many employees. The amendment, therefore, will allow employees who earn more than $1,600 per month and are covered by the Act to pursue claims on their contractual terms and conditions of employment through the Commissioner's adjudication. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the Bill also proposes amendments in other areas. I will only briefly mention them. To rationalise the computation of salary payable to an employee for an incomplete month of work, clause 7 inserts a new formula for such calculations. Next, to extend maternity protection, clause 28 sets out the procedure for an employee, who considers herself unfairly dismissed within three months before her confinement, to appeal to the Minister. It also empowers the Minister to reinstate such an employee or to award compensation as he considers just and equitable to the wrongfully dismissed employee. A penalty clause for non-compliance of the Minister's direction under the section is also provided. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments also seek to facilitate investigation procedures so as to enable the Ministry's officials to enforce the provisions of the Employment Act more effectively. The powers of the Commissioner and inspecting officers are to be expanded. For example, clause 34 provides that statements made to the Commissioner or investigating officers may be recorded in writing and signed by the person making the statements and clause 39 makes amendment to allow inspecting officers to exercise their powers of investigation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendments proposed in the Bill will ensure that the provisions of the Employment Act will continue to be relevant and meet the changing needs of employers, workers and the economy. The amendments will also remove the rigidities in the law and enable the growth of a more efficient labour market. As the amendments are mainly based on the recommendations of the Tripartite Review Committee and the results of in-depth consultations with employers and trade unions, I am confident that they can be implemented smoothly with support from both employers, employees and workers' unions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Labour GPC supports the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as one of the Deputy Secretary-Generals of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), I was a member of the Tripartite Committee together with my Parliamentary colleague, Dr John Chen, Assistant Secretary-General of NTUC, Mr John De Payva, the Secretary-General of the Singapore Manual and Mercantile Workers' Union and a Nominated Member, and Mr Cyrille Tan, General Secretary of the United Workers of the Electronics and Electrical Industries. This Committee, as the Minister has stated, reviewed the Employment Act. The union team held many consultations and dialogue sessions with leaders and members of the unions and obtained \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> valuable feedback and proposals which were reflected in the discussions at the Committee. Workers' concerns and interests were therefore carefully and comprehensively examined by the Tripartite Committee. There were difficult issues to resolve in amending the provisions of the Act. We raised workers' concerns on issues of employment, job security, wages, terms and conditions of service and health and safety issues. There was a frank exchange on these issues in the deliberation of the Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the union representatives stood firm when it was felt that workers' concerns were not fairly or adequately safeguarded. The Tripartite Committee was able to reach consensus on the proposed changes in a spirit of tripartite understanding and trust. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we understand that with increasing global competition, our companies will have to be restructured to remain viable and competitive. The present law does not spell out clearly the rights and obligations of the employers and their employees in a company restructuring exercise where workers are transferred from one employer to another. Without a proper and fair framework to allow the changes to be made quickly so as to maintain or even enhance our competitive position, there will be industrial disputes which will have severe repercussions on us. At stake will be the jobs of our workers. We are glad that the changes introduced in clause 6 of the Bill to introduce the new section 18A of the Act will provide a legal framework which can help address workers' concerns equitably, to see that their terms and conditions of service are adequately safeguarded. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments will require the employer to give the following information when there is a transfer of the business and employees: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The reasons for the transfer and when it will take place; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) How the transfer will affect the employees and what plans the employer has for them; and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) What plans the new employer buying over the employer's business has for the employees. The new employer will have to provide information to enable the existing employer to fulfil his obligation to the employees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Minister has stated, in case of dispute there is provision for either party, ie, the employer or the worker or the union which represents the worker, to refer the case to the Ministry of Labour. If the dispute remains unresolved, reference can be made to the Industrial Arbitration Court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the basis on which pay is to be calculated, the present definition of \"rate of pay\" and \"ordinary rate of pay\" is unclear, and has given rise to interpretation problems. With the establishment of the two new bases of calculation for the rate of pay, I think the position will be clearer and disputes can be avoided. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On part-time employment, we were covered by the guidelines on part-time employment issued in 1990. These guidelines have worked well and therefore including them in the Employment Act is welcomed as it will now make the guidelines legally enforceable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the amendments to sections 68 and 72 of the Act to prohibit the employment of children in an industrial or non-industrial undertaking, the need to amend the law on child labour was taken up by my colleagues in the NTUC for several years. I am glad that the Ministry has now agreed to amend the law to provide that a child may not be employed in an industrial or non-industrial undertaking except in the circumstances specified in the amended section 68. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Bill will improve the Act and on this note, I support the Bill. \n  <br>2.28 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to comment on the Employment (Amendment) Bill, which is of interest to many Singaporeans besides the employers and the workers who are \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> affected by it. The standards or principles enshrined in the Bill may be benchmarks for employment contracts outside the scope of the Employment Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 6 of the Employment (Amendment) Bill dealing with the transfer of employment is, I think, good news for the workers as it brings along with it an overdue change of wind. The existing section 18 of the Employment Act was originally lifted out of context from some British legislation in 1968. Since then, the original British legislation has changed beyond recognition while our section 18 remains uncorrupted and undefiled by changes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, during these past 27 years, this section 18 does serve to some extent the purpose it must have been intended for. Section 18 is, if I may say so, a rather puzzling provision. It holds a lot of promise of protection for workers, but it falls short when it comes to actual delivery. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill introduces a new section 18A which, in a manner of speaking, fits the formerly toothless section 18 with a brand new set of dentures. I should think these dentures will give workers a better bite on their terms of service during a transfer of employment, unless they meet with a very tough nut of an employer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very much concerned with the probable effect of the proposed subsection 12 of the new section 18A, which enables a new employer and a transferred worker or his trade union to agree to \"different\" terms of service. In this context, if I am not mistaken, \"different\" can mean either \"more favourable\" or \"less favourable\" than the terms of service enjoyed by the worker before the transfer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may seem reasonable to let market forces prevail as the employer and the worker or his union should know what terms of service are best in their own mutual interest. One problem is that a transferred worker may be particularly vulnerable at the time of transfer of employment. Even with full employment, a worker in his 40s or 50s and having skills \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> or experience no longer in demand in other places of work will definitely not be mobile enough to be able to bargain. Faced with the prospect of premature retirement when he has many years of active working life left in him, a worker may have to knuckle down to the new employer's offer of inferior terms of service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, no one physically compels the worker to accept the unfavourable terms of service, except the impersonal coercion of market forces. I am very much concerned that the new section 18A(12) may serve as a backdoor for an employer wanting to cut his workers' pay and other benefits. The employer only has to transfer his business from one company to another company. It is a ploy that has been used, is being used, and will continue to be used. It would be preferable if the new section 18A(12) has been couched in a more positive form, as in clause 19 of the Bill, where the amended section 53(3) provides for employers and workers to agree to more favourable terms of service relating to leave. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one of the few negative features in an otherwise commendable Bill. One other negative feature I will touch upon is the splitting of the \"rate of pay\" into \"basic rate of pay\" and \"gross rate of pay\". Granted that the expressions \"rate of pay\" and \"ordinary rate of pay\" have given rise to rather unbreakable bones of contention between employers and trade unions, the underlying cause of the disputes may not lie in the expressions themselves. The attitude of the parties to the disputes may be also a factor. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the reasons for the disputes, I think the introduction of a basic rate and a gross rate may serve to muddy further the water of industrial relations. The difference between the two rates seems to be that the gross rate includes all allowances other than travelling, food or housing allowances while the basic rate excludes all allowances. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have thought the expression \"rate of pay\" is meant to be an objective definition for the guidance of persons \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> affected by the Employment Act. Sir, in the same way, a \"speed limit\" is meant as a guidance for road users. Just imagine the utter confusion on the road if there is a basic speed limit for economy cars and a gross speed limit for petrol-guzzlers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the comparison is not quite appropriate. My point is that the Ministry of Labour may be tackling the problem from the wrong end. As I see it, the problem of deciding which of the allowances to be included in the rate of pay for work at different times or days cannot be settled through friendly negotiations. This is understandable, as even spouses cannot always see eye to eye. Therefore, legislation has to be invoked to cut through the tangle. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have thought it would have been more logical to spell out the circumstances when and what allowances are payable, without changing the \"rate of pay\". As clause 43 of the Bill enables allowances to continue to be paid, if they have been so negotiated, even if contrary to the Bill, an anomalous situation may arise in future. Two workers doing identically the same kind of work in the same kind of circumstances may have different rates of pay. One may enjoy a statutory rate and another a negotiated rate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of a single \"rate of pay\", we now have a \"basic rate of pay\", a \"gross rate of pay\" and a \"negotiated rate of pay\". It will be difficult, if not impossible, to talk about the rate of pay in a particular company or industry because the Employment Act in future will not even define \"rate of pay\" without qualification. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, other than the two negative features I have pointed out, I think the Employment (Amendment) Bill is a timely piece of legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 28 of this Amendment Bill empowers the Minister to order the employer to re-employ those female workers who were unreasonably dismissed just before they were due to deliver their babies. This is a protection for the married career women. However, the Bill also stipulates that the Minister's decision on such matter shall be final, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and the female workers who were unreasonably dismissed will not have legal recourse against their employers irrespective of how much hardship they have suffered. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 28(5) even went to the extent of stating that so long as the Minister ruled that the female worker had been unreasonably dismissed and ordered that the employer should take her back, it would amount to depriving the said worker of her right to sue the employer for damages in court. I really do not know whether this provision is meant to protect the employee or the employer! More seriously, this provision deprives the female worker who has been unreasonably dismissed of her legal rights. I am against this provision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 of the Bill states that if an employee volunteers to work on a rest day and if the number of hours worked is not more than half the number of working hours in a normal working day, then the employer needs to pay only half a day's basic salary to the worker. If he works more than half the number of working hours in a normal working day, then the employer will pay one full day's basic salary. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is a similar provision in the existing Employment Act, I understand that the practice is such that when a worker works on a rest day, he is paid double that of the normal rate of pay. Why should we make provision in this Amendment Bill that in certain circumstances, the employee cannot enjoy double pay when working on his rest day? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister when this provision will apply whereby an employee who works on a rest day is not entitled to double pay. Will this be abused by employers to exploit the employees and is it really necessary to have such a provision? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although this amendment has raised the salary ceiling of coverage from $1,250 to $1,600, a worker whose salary exceeds $1,600 will have no avenue of recourse if he is unreasonably \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> dismissed, or is dismissed without appropriate compensation under the Employment Act. Although he can instruct a lawyer to sue his employer in court, the legal cost may well exceed what he can claim from his employer. As such, he will have to settle the matter by leaving it unsettled. So for those people whose salary is neither too high nor too low, it is very unfair. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the Government consider setting up an Employment Arbitration Court to deal with matters which are now left to the discretion of the Minister and the Commissioner for Labour, and allow individual workers to refer their complaints to the Employment Arbitration Court. At the same time, the parties shall not be allowed to engage lawyers for the arbitration proceedings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some provisions are made in this Amendment Bill to clarify the existing Employment Act, a number of provisions in this Bill can actually do more harm than good. I do not support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Stephen Lee Ching Yen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Stephen Lee Ching Yen (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendment before the House today is to update the Employment Act and to remove provisions in the Act that give rise to rigidities in the labour market. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rise to support the amendments as they will help to ensure that Singapore keeps pace with the changing needs of the employers, employees and the economy. In particular, I would like to comment on two key areas of review, namely, the provisions for company restructuring and part-time employment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, company restructuring. The business environment today is characterised by rapid product changes, customer-driven environment and intense global competition. Enterprise needs to be nimble and agile to respond to the challenges of the market. It is especially true for a small and open economy like ours. Employers should be free to restructure and to determine the appropriate organisational structure and the size of the workforce needed for the enterprise. The interest and welfare of employees should at the same time be \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> protected in the process of corporate restructuring. Setting up of a legal framework to regulate the transfer of employees in a company restructuring helps to achieve these objectives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rights and obligations of employers and unions have been spelt out more clearly under the amendment to the legislation. An important principle of the amendment is to preserve the continuity of the period of employment of the transferred employees. The amendment also requires the transferor to inform and share relevant information which could affect the employee. It is important that unions and employees be properly informed of the rationale and features of corporate restructuring as soon as possible. This will help to allay any possible fears and ensure that the process of corporate restructuring is smooth and not long drawn. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, let me turn to the guidelines on part-time employment. The Ministry of Labour in its attempt to encourage part-time employment had in August 1989 introduced guidelines on part-time employment. These guidelines provide the flexibility to pro-rate certain benefits and the encashment of annual leave and public holidays in the form of higher wages. Employers have found these guidelines to be helpful and practical. However, since these are administrative guidelines, they cannot be enforced by the Ministry of Labour. I therefore welcome this move to have the guidelines formalised as regulations under the Employment Act. This would help to spell out clearly the rights and obligations of employers and employees to facilitate part-time employment. I hope that this would encourage more employers to recruit more part-time workers to address their labour shortage problems. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the amendments to the Employment Act. I believe they will help to remove rigidities and ambiguities and keep the Act relevant in the changing environment of the labour market. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In concluding, let me commend the Ministry of Labour for setting up the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Tripartite Review Committee which led to the formulation of the amendments before the House today. They therefore reflect the consensual view of the tripartite partners. \n  <br>2.47 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Charles Chong (Eunos GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendments moved by the Minister. But I would like to seek clarification on the provisions relating to the transfer of employees. Sir, I suspect that one of the three cases quoted by the Minister during his Second Reading speech may be applicable to the company I work for. If this is indeed the case, then I would like to declare my special interest. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for Labour to clarify that the legal framework introduced by the new section 18A applies only when a business or part of it is sold as a going concern, or where there is a merger or restructuring of a business; the new law does not cover the following situations: (1) transfers among existing companies, whether within or outside the group, where no sale of business is involved; (2) where only assets but not the business of the company is sold; or (3) in situations of transfers to companies outside Singapore which would mean a change in the contract of employment, and that in all these cases, the employees' consent and agreement will continue to be required. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would be grateful to hear the Minister's clarification on these issues. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I would like to thank the Members who spoke in support of this amendment. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Othman Haron Eusofe who led the trade union delegation on the Tripartite Committee to review the Employment Act and also Mr Stephen Lee who led the employers' delegation. I think both Mr Othman and Mr Stephen Lee, together with their respective members on the Committee, demonstrated a strong commitment to strengthening the spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> between employers and employees in Singapore. Their ideas and contributions made it possible for these wide-ranging amendments to the Employment Act which will reinforce the fabric of our industrial relations climate in Singapore. And, here, I must add that this is an important aspect of our attractiveness as a global business centre to have this non-confrontational harmonious industrial relations climate. And anything that we can do to further strengthen it will be an added advantage to our overall economic competitiveness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now turn to some of the concerns raised by Members? Mr Chin Harn Tong commented on clause 6 which introduces a new section 18A to provide a legal framework for the transfer of employees. His concern is that the new section 18A(12) may result in some employees being disadvantaged, particularly the older employees who are in the age group of 40 to 50 years may not be able to drive a good bargain with the transferee, that is, the new company that is going to take over the employment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reassure Mr Chin that the new section 18A(12) is, in fact, intended to allow negotiations between the transferee and the employees or the union to proceed whereby they may be able to arrive at a mutually agreeable new set of terms. I would imagine that it would be very difficult to get a trade union or a group of employees to agree to accept disadvantageous terms in view of a transfer when they know full well that if they have any disagreement, they can go to the Ministry of Labour and seek the assistance of the Commissioner for Labour to conciliate and adjudicate on their behalf to ensure that their interests in the transfer will not be overlooked and that they will not suffer as a result of the transfer. So, in fact, the new section 18A(12) only creates flexibility for both parties, the employees and the transferee, to come to an agreement when there is a reason for varying the terms and conditions of the employment contract which is being transferred, or of the collective agreement which will now take effect in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the new company. I would imagine that such flexibility is necessary because we cannot predict entirely what would happen in the future in terms of the economic conditions under which transfers will take place. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law should, therefore, not be so rigid as to say that no variation is permitted. We should, in fact, allow employees and their representatives to negotiate with the transferee and, where appropriate, obtain a better set of conditions, failing which their existing terms of employment will continue to prevail. That is provided for in the new section 18A where workers will be transferred over to the new company on the same terms and conditions of employment as they were under their old employer. So I think the new subsection (12) is a positive and not negative feature, as Mr Chin has pointed out. I think it is a positive feature for employees, whether they are young or old, and it allows them flexibility to negotiate for better terms with the new employer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chin also commented on the new definitions of \"basic rate of pay\" and \"gross rate of pay\". He asked whether it is necessary to have these two new definitions. Let me clarify. There have always been two different definitions. One is the \"rate of pay\" and the other is \"ordinary rate of pay\". Under the existing Act, the \"rate of pay\" is defined as the total amount of money, including allowances, which an employee is entitled under a contract of service, but excluding overtime payment, travelling, food and housing allowances, bonus and annual wage supplement and any other reimbursement for expenses incurred in the course of work. And it has always been used to compute payment for overtime work. Whereas the existing \"ordinary rate of pay\" is defined as the total amount of money, including cash allowances, in respect of work done under a contract of service. It has the same list of exclusions. It is used for computing payment for public holidays, annual leave, sick leave, maternity leave, work on rest day and public holiday and payment in lieu of notice of termination and salary deduction \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> for absence from work. So there have always been two rates of pay in the Employment Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tripartite Committee recognised that the present definitions are sometimes confusing and they have given rise to disputes between employers and employees over which allowances ought to be included and which should be left out. We should also bear in mind that when the Employment Act was enacted in 1968, only a few types of allowances, such as meal allowances, housing and transport allowances, were common in those days. Whereas over the years, there has been a proliferation of allowances provided by employers in order to be able to recruit employees from a tight labour market and also to retain and motivate their employees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey conducted by my Ministry showed that there are about 72 types of allowances paid by employers either to compensate employees for hardship and inconveniences or to motivate them to continue to work at a high level of productivity. These allowances have been introduced to meet specific circumstances within the company, whether it is to recruit or retain the employees. The employers had pointed out that it was never intended that allowances should be included for payment for overtime work, work on rest day and public holiday. Hence, the Tripartite Committee recommended that we adopt a clearer definition and so we adopt two new terms, \"basic rate of pay\" and \"gross rate of pay\", which should be clear in themselves and would put a stop to future disputes between employees and employers over what allowances should be included for calculation of statutory payment. And I believe that the Tripartite Committee's recommendation is sensible. We have included it in this amendment because it will help to clarify the situation for both employees and employers. I think it would certainly prevent disputes in the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to Mr Low Thia Khiang who said that he did not support the Bill. But all he could point out were two features which he was unable to support. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> He did say that there were other provisions in the Bill that he did not support but he did not touch on them. The two points that he brought up concern maternity benefits. He was concerned that, under clause 28, when the Minister had given a direction in a case where a person had been dismissed without sufficient cause, the Minister's decision under the new section 84 shall be final and shall not be challenged in Court. He asked why it shall not be challenged in Court. It has been a feature and a cornerstone of our industrial relations law that we try to achieve conciliation or adjudication to settle disputes between employers and employees with minimal confrontation. As a result, disputes that are being heard in a Labour Court are heard in the absence of lawyers to minimise the amount of confrontation and to make the procedure much simpler for the laymen, namely, the workers themselves, to understand what is going on and to ensure that their interests will be given a full airing and they will be protected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason that we have a provision whereby the Minister's ruling on cases of dismissal shall not be subject to future challenge so that the matter can end once it has been referred to the Ministry for conciliation and adjudication. Otherwise, we would have a case where employees would go to the Ministry to seek assistance and if they were not satisfied, they would carry on the process of confronting their employers or trying to seek remedy in the Court and continue the dispute with their employers. And I think this is not desirable, in the interest of trying to preserve a harmonious industrial relations climate, to have such a dispute dragged over a long period in the courts. What we have provided is a mechanism whereby employees can go to an independent party, in this case the Ministry of Labour, and he will get a fair hearing. If he has any dispute, we will assist him to resolve it with his employer. In exchange, he forgoes the right to take up the same issue in the Civil Court. But of course, if he has no faith or confidence in the Ministry to safeguard his interest, there is nothing in law that will stop him from taking up his case directly to the court in the first \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> instance to sue the employer if he so chooses to, or if he thinks that he can seek a better remedy or get a better compensation, he should proceed. But if he comes to the Ministry of Labour where he does not have to incur any cost and he can expect an expeditious settlement, then he must submit himself to the condition that he will allow the Ministry to make the final decision and not pursue the matter further. And in the process, this would help to build up a harmonious industrial relations climate by minimising all kinds of disputes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is an entirely workable approach. We have had this in the legislation for many years, and we should continue to abide by it, because it will help us to strengthen the relationship between employers and employees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low also suggested the setting up of an employment arbitration court to handle disputes. In fact, as I explained a moment ago, we do have such a system for all employees who are covered by the Employment Act. And the effect of this amendment is that white collar workers who are earning salaries above $1,600 will also be able to seek conciliation and adjudication at the Ministry of Labour over disputes with their employers on the contractual provisions in their terms of employment. So we have now made it possible for them to seek conciliation. Whereas in the past, workers who were earning salaries below $1,600 were not able to seek such adjudication by the Commissioner for Labour. In effect, we have already provided a system whereby employees who are covered by the Employment Act will be able to seek expeditious settlement of their disputes with their employers. And I do not think there is a need to set up an employment arbitration court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, where disputes concern unionised employees, then apart from applying for conciliation at the Ministry of Labour and for adjudication in the Labour Court, they could also take their disputes to the Industrial Arbitration Court which will deal with them at a higher level. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong asked whether under the new section 18A which provides the legal framework for the transfer of employees, it will cover a case where there is actually no sale of business and employees are just being sent over to a new company, or where the so-called restructuring only involves the sale of certain assets to a new company, or a company is intending to transfer part of its operations outside Singapore. Let me assure Mr Chong that in such cases where there is no sale of business but only a transfer of assets is involved and where the transfer of business concerns a company outside Singapore, then employees cannot just be transferred under the provisions of the new section 18A. What we have said here is that there must be a genuine business restructuring. There must be actual sale of the business or part of the business as a going concern and that the transferee, the new employer, will be taking over both the business and the employees. Under such circumstances, we can foresee that for the employees, there will not be any disruption in employment. They will just move over to work for the new employer. Therefore, there is no risk of them being jobless for a period of time. Hence the question of retrenchment and retrenchment benefit should not arise. That is why we have provided for a legal framework to enable a business which is undergoing restructuring to do so expeditiously. I hope that settles the Member's concern in this matter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have responded to the queries. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I need to seek clarification from the Minister. The Minister has not replied to my query on clause 12 which amends section 37. He says that under the new section 37(3), an employee who at the request of his employer works on a rest day shall be paid for that day only a sum at the basic rate of pay for one day's work. Why is it necessary to have this and under what circumstances would this section apply? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second clarification. Why is it necessary to have clause 28 which amends section 84? The new section 8(5) says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Any direction of the Minister under subsection (3) shall operate as a bar to any action for damages by the employee in any court in respect of the dismissal without sufficient cause ...' \n  <br>\n  <br>Does this not deprive an employee's right to seek redress in a court? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards employees who earn $1,600 but who are not covered under the Act, it would be difficult for them to seek redress if they have disputes with their employers and they have to engage lawyers. Would the Minister also consider a certain framework for these workers, say, in the salary range of $2,000 as it would be difficult for them to engage lawyers? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> I am sorry, Mr Speaker, I forgot this point about work on rest day. This matter was extensively discussed at the Tripartite Review Committee. Both the employers and the trade union representatives agreed that in the case of an employee who has been asked to work on a rest day, the present formula of paying two days' pay for work regardless of how long the employee is expected to work is not quite consistent with the concept that payment of wages or salary should be commensurate with the work done. At the same time, both employers and trade union representatives also recognise that, as I explained in my Second Reading speech, there will be occasions where an employee is asked to come to work on a rest day, and all the employer needs him is for a very short period, maybe 2-3 hours or even less. In the meantime, the employee would have incurred travelling expenses and he may have to have a meal and will suffer the inconvenience of having to work on a rest day. Therefore, to pay on an hourly rate, which some employers in fact today pay on an hourly rate, is also not fair. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So both employers and trade union representatives on the Tripartite Review Committee agreed to adopt a cut-off point. If an employee has been asked to come to work and he works for less than half a day, then he should be paid one day's pay. Because, as I said, a rest day is not a paid day. But if he works for more than half a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> day, then he should be paid the existing rate of two days' pay. This was agreed between the employers and employees. They have discussed this thoroughly. I think it is an entirely reasonable solution to balance the interest of both employees and employers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also referred to clause 28, ie, the new section 84(5) which says, \"Any direction of the Minister ... shall operate as a bar ...\". The reason for this, as I have explained earlier on, is that if an employee wants to take his or her dispute to the Ministry of Labour for expeditious settlement, there are certain conditions. And the conditions are that he or she abides by the decisions of the Minister and that there is a finality to the dispute. This is not to prevent an employee, a worker or a citizen from exercising his legal right. But it is a choice. It is an option open to them. If an employee wants to take this route of settlement where we will assure him of an independent and fair assessment, then he must abide by the rules, which is that at the end of the day when the Ministry makes a decision, he has to consider the case as settled and closed and he does not proceed with further litigations or any other court cases or suits. If we do not have such a provision, then everybody will take their case to the Labour Ministry and those who are not satisfied will carry on in the civil court. I think it is undesirable for us to have such a stream of litigations being dragged over a long period. It will sour up the relationship between employers and employees. The whole objective of conciliation and adjudication in a Labour Court is to settle disputes expeditiously and with a minimal of confrontation and also to try to avoid serious damage to the industrial relations climate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thought I made it quite clear in my Second Reading speech that clause 28 removes the restriction on the Commissioner to inquire into disputes brought to the Ministry of Labour by employees whose salaries exceed $1,600. In fact, the Tripartite Review Committee also studied this problem that the Member mentioned, ie, whether employees earning more than $1,600 can avail themselves of the low cost and expeditious dispute settlement \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> procedures available at the Ministry of Labour. The current law does not allow it. But with this amendment, we will be able to help employees who are earning more than $1,600 and are covered by the Employment Act. There are certain categories of employees in Singapore who are not covered by the Employment Act. For instance, managerial and executive staff are not covered by the Employment Act, regardless of their salary. Managers carrying out managerial responsibilities will not be covered. But with this amendment, any other employees who are covered by the Act and who earn more than $1,600 will in effect be able to take their disputes to the Ministry of Labour and ask the Commissioner for Labour to help them to resolve their disputes. I believe that the Member's concern has been addressed here. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, a further clarification. Does the Minister agree that with this amendment, it is actually less favourable for an employee to work on a rest day as compared to the existing Act. Because the existing Act says that any work done at the request of his employer, he shall be paid one day's salary for one day's work. This is under section 37(2). The amendment says, \"An employee who at his own request works ... if the period of work does not exceed half his normal hours of work,\" he will be paid only half a day's pay of the basic rate, which is less favourable than the existing Act. Why is this so? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this refers to clause 12. As I explained earlier on, this matter of pay for work on rest day has been extensively discussed by the Tripartite Committee to review the Employment Act. The Committee concluded that the present arrangement is not entirely fair. The Member said that it is not advantageous for the workers. But as I pointed out earlier on, in some cases, workers who are asked to come to work on their rest day for a very short period are being paid by their employers on the basis of twice the daily rate of pay on an hourly basis. That is even more unfair. This practice exists and in the context of the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Tripartite Committee, the members have discussed this and they felt that we should address this issue clearly and provide amendments that will prevent any dispute arising from employers asking their workers to work on their rest day. I think the proposed formula whereby an employee who is required to work for less than half a day will be paid a full day's pay and twice the rate for a normal full-day's work is an entirely fair arrangement both from the workers' and the employers' point of view. I think we should abide by this recommendation of the Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, we cannot allow you to keep on seeking clarification. I will allow you one last clarification. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Under the existing Act, it states that an employee who at his own request works for an employer on a rest day shall be paid for that day at not less than the ordinary rate for one day's work. That was the minimum that the Act specified. I am not aware of hourly payment. If they did it in the past, I think it is illegal, is it not, under the Act? So why did the Minister regularise this less favourable arrangement on overtime work under the amendment and say that he will be paid for only half-day's work rather than one day's work even on the same conditions under the existing Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, if in fact such a matter had been brought to the attention of my Ministry, we would have advised the employer and the employee on what would be the correct way to interpret payment for work on rest day. What I am saying is that we know that the practice does exist and unless it is brought to our attention which particular employer is adopting this approach, we would not be able to pursue it. But if, in fact, any employer had come to us for advice, we would have advised according to the law and if any employee had a dispute with the employer, we would have advised or adjudicated according to the law. But in the review of the Employment Act, this matter came up because it deserves some attention. The question is whether we want to have a new framework which will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> equitably pay employees who are required by the employer to work on their rest day. The Committee had discussed this at great length. I am prepared to accept the recommendation of the Committee to adopt this new framework and I think it is a fair recommendation which we should abide by it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Caning was introduced for illegal entry and overstaying by over 90 days. The situation improved for a while after the amendments. In recent years, it has worsened significantly. Last year, nearly 10,000 immigration offenders were arrested - double the number in 1988. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> The situation shows no signs of abating. In the first nine months of this year, 9,343 were arrested. The problem will grow bigger so long as there are unscrupulous employers willing to employ illegals. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Situation at construction sites</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I am very concerned about the situation at construction sites. Police intelligence indicates that the majority of the immigration offenders arrested were here to work in construction sites. Construction sites were also used by immigration offenders for cover and shelter. Some of them were also involved in crime. The crime situation at construction sites has gone worse. In 1993, 77 foreigners were arrested for crimes at worksites. 31 or 40% of them were immigration offenders. In 1994, the number of arrests rose to 164 and immigration offenders constituted 60 or 36.5% of them. The crimes committed range from simple theft and robbery to the more serious offences like hurt and murder. In 1994 alone, there were 10 murder cases and 22 hurt cases at construction sites involving foreigners. Our crime rates and safety will be affected if we do not deal with this problem now. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the reason for the worsening situation is the lax security at construction sites which allows unimpeded and free access to anyone. There is little or no access control and no system of identifying workers. Because of this, immigration offenders find it easy to take cover at construction sites. The multiple-layer nature of subcontracting practised in the construction industry compounds the problem. Under such a practice, the principal contractor sub-contracts specific jobs, eg, brick-laying, to a sub-contractor. This sub-contractor in turn sub-contracts all or part of this job to other small contractors and so on down the line. As a result, it is very difficult to link an immigration offender found at a site to a particular sub-contractor. This is compounded by the requirement in our current immigration laws that the immigration offender must be found in actual possession of tools or implements, before he can be presumed to be working at the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> site. It is all too easy for an immigration offender working at the site to thus dispose of any work tools. If a raid is conducted at night in the living quarters in a worksite, no tools would be found on the immigration offenders. All these add to the difficulties in securing convictions. For example, early this year, a joint operation by Police, Immigration and the Ministry of Labour's Labour Inspectorate was carried out at a construction site in Pulau Seraya. 39 immigration offenders were arrested. Of these, 22 admitted to working illegally while the rest denied it. Those who admitted working refused to disclose the particulars of their employers. As a result, no further action could be taken against the employers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principal or main contractors are responsible for overall management of the site and have control over all activities at the site. Therefore, they are best placed for implementing measures to keep out unauthorised persons, including immigration offenders, and to prevent crime through proper security control measures. During the opening of the new Tanah Merah Prison and Changi Women's Prison in April last year, I said that if contractors do not step up security at their worksites, we will have to legislate the security measures. In October last year, Police also issued an advisory note to all contractors on measures to tighten security at work sites. The Commissioner of Police repeated the warning in November 1994, following a pre-dawn fight at a construction site in the Alexandra area, where 19 foreign workers were arrested. From the Police's feedback, many construction sites have now put in place the recommended security measures. But there are still too many who have chosen to ignore the Police's advice. To ensure that the construction sites do not become havens for immigration offenders, my Ministry is left with no choice but to legislate these measures. Moral persuasion has not achieved results. More than adequate warning has already been given. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>New requirements for principal contractors</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to deal with the problem of immigration offenders we have therefore taken a multi-pronged approach. First, this is done through clause 7 of the Immigration (Amendment) Bill which seeks to create a new section 57B to make it a legal requirement for principal or main contractors who have control of access of any worksite to carry out worksite access control measures to prevent unauthorised persons from entering construction sites. If any immigration offender is found at the worksite, the principal contractor will be held responsible. It would be presumed that he has control of access and he has knowingly allowed the immigration offender to enter or remain at the worksite. The principal contractor will be allowed to rebut the presumptions that he has knowingly allowed the immigration offenders to enter or remain at the worksite only if he has exercised due diligence to prevent immigration offenders from entering or remaining at the worksite. This means taking all reasonable measures to prevent any immigration offender from entering or remaining at the worksite and includes complying with prescribed security measures. These measures are similar to the measures recommended by the advisory note issued by the Police in October last year. Contractors who have been implementing these measures, therefore, need not worry about the new provisions in the Immigration Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if an immigration offender is found at the worksite, the principal contractor in charge of the worksite will face a fine of not less than $15,000 and not more than $30,000, or a term of imprisonment of not more than one year, or both. Repeat offenders are liable to receive double the penalty on the second conviction - that is, a fine of not less than $30,000 and not more than $60,000, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years, or both. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Labour will also be moving a similar amendment to the Employment of Foreign Workers Act to cover foreigners without work permits and found working at worksite. The \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> approach of the amendments to both Acts has been harmonised with the common objective of strengthening the measures used to deter the employment of immigration offenders and illegal workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let subcontractors also beware. This does not mean that they will be let off scot-free to employ immigration offenders. The Immigration Department will continue to prosecute any contractor, including subcontractors, under the existing provisions in the Immigration Act for employing immigration offenders. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tightening existing provisions against employers</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has also taken the opportunity to tighten up the existing provisions against employers of immigration offenders in the following ways. First, clause 6(d) of the Bill seeks to re-enact section 57(8) to remove the requirement that an immigration offender must be caught in possession of tools before he can be presumed to be working at any premises. As I have said earlier, it is all too easy for an immigration offender to dispose of his tools during a raid. The amended section 57(8) will therefore facilitate prosecution of employers of immigration offenders by shifting the onus of proof to the employers once immigration offenders are found at their premises. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the definition of \"employ\" under section 2 of the Immigration Act is also amended by clause 2 of the Bill to remove the requirement that the prosecution must prove the existence of a contract or service or any payment before a person can be charged for employing an immigration offender. This is to cover the situation where the immigration offender claims that he is under probation or he is paid in kind other than in cash. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the penalty for employing more than five immigration offenders is enhanced. This is done through clause 6(b) of the Bill which seeks to re-enact section 57(1A) to remove the requirement that the prosecution must prove that the employer of more than five immigration offenders has \"actual knowledge\" of their immigration status before he can be \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> caned for employing them. This is necessary because in practice, unless the employer admits that he knew of the status of the immigration offender, it is almost impossible to prove that the employer is aware of the immigration offender's status. The penalty of caning should deter those employers who employ more than five immigration offenders. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to ensure that companies which committed immigration offences attracting mandatory caning or jail do not escape the heavier penalties, clause 6(c) of the Bill seeks to create a new section 57(2A) to provide for an alternate penalty of a fine for a \"body corporate\" or company which has committed an immigration offence punishable with mandatory jail or caning. So, for example, in a case where a company has been convicted of employing more than five immigration offenders, which carries mandatory jail and caning, the courts will, under the new section 57(2A), have the leeway of imposing a fine of not less than $50,000 and not more than $100,000, in lieu of caning or jail, on the company. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Fine tuning of penalties against immigration offenders</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clauses 3 and 5 of the Immigration (Amendment) Bill seek to amend section 6(3)(a) and section 15(3)(b) respectively to deal with immigration offenders. Under section 6(3)(a) of the Immigration Act, the penalty for illegal entry is mandatory imprisonment of between three months and two years and not less than three strokes of the cane. Under section 15(3)(b) of the Immigration Act, the penalty for overstaying beyond 90 days is an imprisonment term of between three months and two years, and a minimum of three strokes of the cane. There is no fine. Clauses 3 and 5 of the Immigration (Amendment) Bill seek to amend section 6(3)(a) and section 15(3)(b) to remove the mandatory minimum three months' jail term and to cap the maximum imprisonment term for illegal entry and overstaying at six months. There are two reasons for this. First, we do not want these foreigners to clog up our jails. As at \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 30th September this year, our prison capacity was exceeded by more than 36%. Immigration offenders constituted more than half, ie, 67.4% to be exact, of the 2,787 foreign prisoners. Secondly, by freeing up the jails, we will be able to prosecute more immigration offenders who may otherwise have to be let off the hook due to the prisons' limited capacity. The mandatory caning provision will remain unchanged as caning has proved to be very effective; hardly any immigration offender who has been caned returns to Singapore. For persons who are not liable to be caned under our laws, that is, women and men above 50 years old, we have provided for them to be fined up to $6,000 instead. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Other amendments</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have also taken the opportunity to enhance the penalty under section 57(1)(iv) from a maximum fine of $2,000 to $4,000 and from six months' jail to one year's jail to deal with the increase in the number of offences of false representations under section 57(1)(f). The penalties for other offences listed under section 57(1)(iv) have also been raised to maintain parity with the new penalty under section 57(1)(f). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the problem of illegal immigrants and overstayers is a serious one. We cannot afford to allow the situation to persist and go out of hand. To ensure that the problem is effectively curtailed, we need the concerted efforts of all parties involved. If there is no demand for illegal workers because of strong deterrent laws, then they will not come. Worksites are the main areas where immigration offenders are found because the open nature of worksites makes it easy for them to find refuge. For this reason, we can deter immigration offenders at worksites by having good security and access control measures. This is one area where all contractors can play their part to complement the efforts of Government to tackle this problem. Members of the executive committee of the Singapore Contractors Association Ltd (SCAL) have \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> been consulted twice this year and have indicated their support for the Government's efforts. SCAL appreciates the seriousness of the situation which compromises our safety and the need for tough measures. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the new legislation will go a long way in addressing the root of the problem - which is at the construction sites. Nevertheless, let me also send a warning signal to the other employers, who are thinking of employing immigration offenders, that the new section 57B, as drafted, has given the flexibility to enable the Minister to extend the provision to other workplaces, such as shipyards and factories, if the need arises. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Mohammed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Zulkifli bin Mohammed (Jalan Besar GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this Amendment Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main concern here is: are we to turn a blind eye and tolerate the lawlessness taking place at worksites accommodating foreign workers? I am sure the answer is surely not, as we have been told of the alarming statistics of serious crimes by the Minister a short while ago. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is apparent that existing legislation, though stringent, is still inadequate to deal with such offences which keep on increasing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Amendment Bill is, indeed, more than a welcome relief to all law-abiding Singaporeans as it serves to deal with such problems more effectively by placing the accountability on employers to ensure that law and order are maintained at their worksites. The stiffer penalties provided for will be a strong deterrent to force employers and main contractors to put up better security and access control measures in order to stamp out lawlessness at worksites. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Sir, may I ask the Minister whether the Police is satisfied with the present standard of security implemented at the worksites and what \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> steps are being contemplated to monitor it to ensure that it is being tightened up to meet the enhanced requirements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, once again, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I thank the Member for his support of the Bill. As I said earlier, many contractors have taken heed of the Police's advice issued last year. Many still have not, and I believe that they will do so once the Bill is put in place. And for those who are still contemplating whether or not they want to employ immigration offenders, I would strongly advise them that they should take the necessary measures before the law catches up on them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EMPLOYMENT OF FOREIGN WORKERS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Labour (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Home Affairs has just explained to this House the problem caused by illegal immigrants and overstayers. These immigration offenders come to Singapore to work illegally. Hence, my Ministry has also encountered an increasing incidence of illegal workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the number of foreign workers working illegally in Singapore has been on the rise. In 1994, an average of 31 employers per month had been prosecuted for employing illegal foreign workers. This rose to 41 per month in the first nine months of 1995. Because of the difficulty of catching employers of illegal workers, such prosecutions may well be the tip of the iceberg. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another indication of the extent of this problem is the large number of complaints to my Ministry about the presence of illegal workers. In 1993, there \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> were 291 complaints per month. This rose to 372 complaints per month in 1994 and 370 per month for the first nine months of this year. Owing to various constraints, we could only investigate some of these feedback. Not every complaint could be investigated thoroughly. What is alarming is that in most cases that we investigated, the complaints were found to be valid and illegal workers were indeed apprehended in follow-up actions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of a large number of illegal foreign workers is a cause of concern. The main implication of having a large number of illegal foreign workers is that they are bypassing our controls which are put in place to regulate the social and economic impact of a large foreign workforce. We already have more than 300,000 work permit holders in Singapore. If we do not curb the practice of employing illegal workers, it will make a mockery of our attempts to regulate the entry of foreign workers. The presence of large numbers of illegal workers will hinder our efforts to encourage employers to upgrade their business operations and to reduce dependence on low cost foreign workers. Illegal workers also depress the wages of our Singaporean workers who have lower skills, or are lower-educated, and who have difficulties working at the wages which are welcomed by illegal workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Home Affairs has just pointed out that Police is concerned about the increasing incidence of crimes committed by foreigners and these crimes range from simple theft and robbery to more serious offences, such as hurt and even murders. Sir, the number of foreigners arrested for committing crime in Singapore has risen from 1,443 in 1993 to 1,879 in 1994. And in the first nine months of this year, 1,591 foreigners had already been arrested. Having an unknown number of unidentified illegal workers in our midst will certainly aggravate this dangerous trend. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is clearly a need to take more drastic action to deter the employment of illegal workers. So far, my Ministry has taken two specific measures. One, urging the court to impose deterrent sentences \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> on employers of illegal foreign workers; and, two, pressing for custodial sentences for first-time offenders who blatantly abuse the Employment of Foreign Workers Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, our enforcement action is still hampered by existing inadequacies in the Employment of Foreign Workers Act. The amendments to the Employment of Foreign Workers Act are targeted at removing these inadequacies. The key amendment is to deal with the rampant problem of illegal employment at construction sites. Members may be interested to know that, on average, 37 illegal workers were detected at each construction site which the Ministry of Labour raided this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of illegal employment is most serious in the construction sector because the existing provisions in the Employment of Foreign Workers Act are unable to deal effectively with contractors who hire illegal foreign workers. The unique feature of the construction sector is the existence of a multi-layered sub-contracting system. Because of the presence of a large number of sub-contractors at a particular worksite, when an illegal worker is found, it is quite difficult to pinpoint who exactly is his real employer. In many instances, nobody can be held liable if the employer of the illegal worker is not positively identified. And the Minister for Home Affairs explained how, in some cases, despite the fact that we have raided, arrested and found evidence that the foreign workers have been working illegally, we could not prosecute the person concerned because the illegal worker did not cooperate and would not identify who were his employers. Such ambiguity hampers our investigation and provides a loophole for unscrupulous contractors to evade the law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the frequent deployment of construction workers from one site to another by their employers or by their contractors makes monitoring and detection of illegal employment even more difficult. And furthermore, the working environment at construction sites \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> is conducive for employment of illegal foreign workers. Main contractors may not institute proper site management system, thus making it easy for illegal workers to enter the worksite and to remain there. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some contractors gave the excuse that they had to resort to illegal workers because they could not qualify for work permits as our Work Permit Allocation policy is too stringent. The Ministry of Labour's data, however, show that this is not true. At present, more than 90% of the construction companies are operating within the 1:5 dependency ratio. In fact, more than 70% are operating within the 1:3 ratio. This shows that most contractors could employ additional foreign workers legally, if they need to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our investigations show that unscrupulous contractors had, in fact, deliberately chosen to employ illegal foreign workers because they wanted to evade the levy. Of the 89 contractors who were caught with illegal workers in the first nine months of this year, 84 could have employed additional work permit holders under the 1:5 dependency ratio. In fact, 66 of those contractors did not even apply for any work permit at all for any of their foreign workers. We can only conclude that these contractors resorted to illegal workers not because they were unsuccessful in applying for work permits but because they were out to cheat the Foreign Workers' Levy system. As a result, we were compelled to seek deterrent prison sentence on contractors who had blatantly abused the Employment of Foreign Workers Act. Two recent cases concern a contractor charged for employing 64 illegal foreign workers on 28th July 1995 and another contractor charged for employing 18 illegal foreign workers on 17th October 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these cases, what is noteworthy is that both contractors had never applied for work permits for their foreign workers. Both contractors were handed prison sentences by the Court despite the fact that it was their first conviction. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, contractors will be granted work permits within the current dependency \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ratio and so long as they have construction projects at hand which justify the need for foreign workers. When we raised the dependency ratio for the construction sector from 1:3 to 1:5 in November 1992, the volume of construction activity was at its peak with the value of contracts awarded at $12.8 billion. Construction activity subsequently tapered off, with the value of contracts awarded at $10.6 billion in 1993 and $12.1 billion in 1994. Hence, there is little ground for contractors to complain that the 1:5 dependency ratio is currently insufficient to meet their needs as demand for construction workers should not be much higher than in 1992. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to ensure that the problem of illegal employment in the construction sector does not get out of hand, it is necessary to amend the Employment of Foreign Workers Act to hold principal contractors responsible for illegal foreign workers found at their worksites. This will compel principal contractors to put in place proper worksite security measures and to exercise greater controls over their sub-contractors who very often are the culprits behind the illegal foreign workers. My Ministry's officers had also briefed representatives of the Singapore Contractors' Association Ltd in September 1995. SCAL had accepted the reasons for tightening the Employment of Foreign Workers Act and was supportive of the general approach. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the section on principal contractors, the Bill also contains other amendments which are introduced to facilitate investigation and prosecution work. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now highlight the key provisions of the Bill. Currently, employers of illegal foreign workers are able to evade prosecution by claiming that they did not know that the illegal workers were foreigners. Clause 3 of the Bill is intended to plug this loophole. It introduces new sections 5(3A) and 5(3B) which place the onus on employers to ascertain the nationality of their workers. If employers claim that they did not know that the illegal workers were foreigners, they will have to prove that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> they have exercised due diligence to check the passports, documents of identity or other travel documents of the workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, under the existing Employment of Foreign Workers Act, the penalty for an employer who is convicted for illegal employment for the second or subsequent offence is a mandatory custodial sentence of one to 12 months, and a fine of two to four years' levy. However, the custodial sentence cannot be applied on a body corporate, such as a company. Hence, in clause 3, we have introduced a higher fine equivalent to four to eight years' levy for a body corporate which is convicted for the second or subsequent offence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill also introduces a definition for the word \"employ\". The new section 5(9) defines \"employ\" as \"to engage or use the service of any person, whether under a contract of service or otherwise, with or without salary.\" This new definition is necessary and is adopted so that it will no longer be possible for errant employers to claim that they did not \"employ\" the illegal foreign workers because \"they did not pay the workers any salary\" or that \"they were merely trying out the workers\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 6 of the existing Employment of Foreign Workers Act, an illegal foreign worker must be \"found\" working or \"found\" in possession of any tool or implement before the prosecution can invoke the presumption that he is employed by the occupier of the premises. This poses difficulties as there are instances where the illegal foreign worker is not working at the time of the inspection, such as during a raid conducted at night at the worksite, as described by the Minister for Home Affairs. Under such circumstances, although it is obvious that the foreigner has been working at the premises, the presumption clause cannot be invoked because he was not found working at the time of the raid. To overcome this problem, clause 4 of the Bill seeks to repeal the existing section 6 and to replace it with a new section 6 which will enable the prosecution to invoke the presumption that the occupier employed the foreigner so long as the foreigner is found at the premises. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me point out that this is a rebuttable presumption. If investigations show that the foreigner found at the premises was not working or had never worked in the premises, the occupier will not be prosecuted. Even if the foreigner was working, the occupier need not be held liable if investigations show that another person is the actual employer of that foreigner. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the amendment to hold principal contractors responsible for illegal foreign workers found at their work place. The purpose is to compel principal contractors to set up worksite security measures to prevent easy access to illegal workers. This is not unlike the new measures required under the Immigration (Amendment) Bill approved by the House earlier. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of this Bill introduces a new section 6A which makes it an offence for a principal contractor who has control of access to his work place to permit any foreigner without a valid work permit to enter or remain at his work place. If such a foreigner is found at the work place, the principal contractor is presumed to: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) have control of access to the work place; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) have permitted the foreigner to enter or remain at the work place; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) have knowledge that the foreigner does not possess a valid work permit. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This presumption will be applied to principal contractors who clearly would have the opportunity to exercise control of access to the work place. In addition, principal contractors can rebut the presumption by proving that they have exercised due diligence: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to prevent the foreigner from entering or remaining at the work place; or \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to ascertain the nationality and work permit status of the person. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show that they have exercised due diligence, principal contractors must demonstrate effective security measures \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> at the worksite which will prevent entry of illegal foreign workers. A Notification prescribing such security measures will be gazetted. The security measures required will be similar to that recommended by the Police to deal with the presence of immigration offenders at worksites and will include: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) erecting perimeter fence around the worksite; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) deploying security guards at all entrances and exits of the worksite; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) issuing identification passes to all persons entering and leaving the worksite; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) maintaining proper records of all persons entering and leaving the worksite. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the penalty for a principal contractor who contravenes this section is a fine of two to four years' levy, or imprisonment up to one year, or both for the first offence. The penalty is doubled for the second or subsequent conviction to a fine of four to eight years' levy, or imprisonment for up to two years, or both. The penalties are comparable to those for employers of illegal foreign workers, except that there is no mandatory custodial sentence for principal contractors who are convicted for the second or subsequent offence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take this opportunity to point out that under clause 4, the new section 6A(7) empowers the Minister to specify other occupiers of a work place to be liable for the responsibilities which we are presently placing only on principal contractors. This is in anticipation of the problem of illegal workers spreading to other business sectors. And if it emerges as a serious problem in the other sectors, apart from the construction industry, then the Minister could, by notification in the Gazette, bring in other work places within this provision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 7 of the Bill amends section 16 of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act to enhance the power of employment inspectors. It empowers them to enter and search any premises where there could be evidence relating to the commission of an offence under the Employment of Foreign \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Workers Act. It also broadens the scope of their power to cater to investigation needs arising from the new section to hold principal contractors responsible for the illegal foreign workers found at their work place. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these amendments, I believe we will be in a better position to deal with the rising problem of illegal foreign workers. These new measures should serve to discourage employers from flouting the law and deter foreigners from coming to Singapore to work illegally. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I believe this acute problem of too many foreign workers and the crimes committed by them are due to the acute shortage of accommodation for foreign workers. I have clients who have engaged foreign workers but are unable to get proper accommodation for them. It is probably because workers without proper accommodation have to go from worksite to worksite to get accommodation. The employers are paying large sums of money in terms of foreign worker levy. I would like to know whether the Minister is willing to use some of these levies to provide accommodation for this massive number of foreign workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Tampines GRC):</b> Sir, I agree with the general thrust of the Minister's points on the problems at construction worksites. My only concern is that in this Bill, as opposed to the Immigration (Amendment) Bill, \"work place\" is defined quite differently. In the case of the Immigration (Amendment) Bill, the Minister for Home Affairs has made it very clear that \"work place\" means the construction worksite. In the Employment of Foreign Workers (Amendment) Bill, \"work place\" is defined as \"any place or premises where works are being carried out ...\". I assume that the Minister's intention is that this Bill should apply to all and sundry, and not just to the construction worksite. Could the Minister clarify that \"work place\" defined in the Bill is targeted only at the construction \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> industry? If it is meant to be a wide-ranging Bill, then I think he has to get the message across to all small and medium size enterprises. The Minister for Home Affairs has made it very clear that the Police have already been in contact with the Singapore Contractors Association on the problems at worksites. But no attempt has been made to inform all other employers that they are also liable under this Bill. Perhaps the Minister may like to clarify that the change in definition of \"work place\" is intentional and is meant to cover everyone besides the contractors. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I support the amendments moved by the Minister. However, there are concerns expressed by some contractors that the new provisions which are more stringent in some areas will affect their business operations, especially in situations where contracts have already been signed and works are in progress. I would like to urge the Minister to consider giving contractors a sufficient grace period before bringing the new provisions into force. This would give everyone time to make adjustments to comply with the new requirements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, new section 16C provides immunity from suits and other legal proceedings on the Controller or any person acting under his direction. Could the Minister provide clarification for the necessity of this new clause? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than these two concerns, I support the amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, concerning Mr Chiam's query, I fail to see the link between the shortage of accommodation and the rising problem of illegal workers. This Bill concerns illegal foreign workers and the measures that are needed to deal with this problem of increasing numbers of illegal foreign workers. While the shortage of accommodation for foreign workers is in fact a problem faced by many employers, it has nothing to do with the subject that we are discussing today. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, for the Member's information, my Ministry is well aware of the shortage of accommodation for foreign workers and we have been working with the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Ministry of National Development to look at ways to reduce or minimise this problem facing the employers. The Ministry of National Development has in fact identified certain sites which could be tendered out to employers to build short-term accommodation for foreign workers. In fact, such projects are under way. I believe one of the sites is somewhere in Bukit Batok and other sites have been identified. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of National Development has also agreed to allow developers of industrial buildings to build quarters within their land, subject to certain plot ratio considerations, for their foreign workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is also looking into reviewing the building regulations to ensure that contractors provide standard housing on worksites for their foreign workers. So the problem of accommodation can be solved by other ways. Today, we are not discussing this problem. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is reasonable to ask for the foreign worker levy to be used to provide accommodation for foreign workers. The foreign worker levy is imposed to regulate the entry of foreign workers into Singapore and to ensure that these foreign workers do not unnecessarily depress the wages of Singaporeans. It is not meant to provide accommodation for foreign workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng asked whether the measure introduced by the new section 6A will cover all work places. The intention here, as I explained in my Second Reading speech, is to focus on contractors to begin with. Hence, under clause 4, it creates a new section 6A(7) which explains that in this instance, an occupier in relation to a work place means the principal contractor who undertakes any construction work at the work place. I explained earlier on that if there is a need to extend this provision to other work places, then the Minister will, by gazette notification, bring in the other work places and at such time we will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> give due publicity to warn all the other employers that they are also subject to the same provision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reassure him that the intention of the new section 6A is focused at the contractors. We want to deal with this problem of illegal foreign workers at the construction site first. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong voiced his support for the Bill and asked whether contractors who have a project that is under way could be given a grace period to comply with the new requirements under the Employment of Foreign Workers Act. Let me say that while we are introducing the requirement now, the warning had already been given much earlier on. As the Minister for Home Affairs pointed out, Police had since October last year served warnings to contractors about tightening their worksite access control measures. I have also warned employers about illegal foreign workers during the Committee of Supply debate earlier this year. I said that my Ministry would be introducing a new provision and regulation to deal with this problem. So in fact contractors have been adequately warned about the new measures that are going to be put in place to deal with the problem. Nevertheless, we are reasonable and we will be prepared to consider the request from the contractors. We will be prepared to discuss with the Contractors' Association on an appropriate grace period before the new provisions are brought into force. But this grace period cannot be a very lengthy grace period in view of the many occasions where we have already warned the industry of the new measures that will be put in place. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong also asked whether it is necessary to provide immunity from suits to officers of my Ministry in the conduct of their investigations into illegal workers. I think this is a standard procedure that officers carrying out such enforcement duty should be protected from any civil suit. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I seek a clarification from the Minister. I am quite comfortable with his reply, but I do not \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> understand why \"work place\" in this Bill is defined quite differently from the Bill that has just been moved by the Minister for Home Affairs. The Minister for Home Affairs moved a Bill that specifies \"work place\" as a construction worksite. It is a very specific definition, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under the new section 6A(2) we said that where a foreigner without a valid work permit is found at any work place it shall be presumed that he has been employed by the occupier. But in the new subsection (7) we clarified what we meant by \"occupier\" and \"principal contractor\". That should put in focus the fact that we are only targeting at contractors at this stage and, if necessary, the Minister will have the power, by gazette notification, to include other work places under section 6A. The Minister for Home Affairs will explain to the Member why the differences. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> The wordings may be different but the spirit is the same. Let me read to the Member this clause in the Immigration (Amendment) Bill: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`\"Work place\" means any place or premises where any construction works are being carried out and includes: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) all the land within the vicinity of the work place which are owned by the person for whom the construction works are being carried out and to which the principal contractor has control of access; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) any canteen, sleeping quarters, office and other structures or buildings erected on the work place; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)[this is a very important point] such other place or premises as the Minister may, by notification in the Gazette, specify to be a work place.' \n  <br>\n  <br>So it can be any place. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>FAMILY VIOLENCE BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>4.36 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful to you, Mr Speaker, and the Members of the House for giving me this opportunity to explain the rationale and provisions of the Family Violence Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work on the Family Violence Bill was a collective effort and therefore I take no personal ownership for it. Drafting started about 1 1/2 years ago. The people involved included lawyers, social workers, a criminologist, front-line professionals and social work students. There were both males and females involved. Input from victims was integral to the drafting of the main provisions of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May this year, the earlier draft of the Bill was given to the Police who forwarded it to the relevant Ministries. Subsequently, the relevant Ministries were given updated drafts. In July, draft copies of the Bill were sent to the relevant Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) after which in the same month, there was a meeting with many of them to discuss the rationale and provisions of the Bill. In late August, all Members of Parliament were sent copies of the draft Bill and input was invited. Feedback was incorporated into the final version of the Bill and thus this Bill is the result of much consultation, discussion and consensus. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of us in this House may be wondering what is the scale of family violence. What are the statistics? Is the problem big enough to warrant all the attention? Let me present the facts to you and then you can decide for yourself. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last 2 1/2 hours, while we have been discussing onerous Bills about employment and foreign workers, one Singaporean, and this could be a spouse, a child or an elderly person, has been hurt at home by another member of the family and has contacted the police for help. If we continue to sit here until 5.30 pm, we will have one more victim. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From figures provided by the Ministry of Home Affairs, we know that in 1994, 3,625 family members made police reports that they had been physically hurt by other family members, ie, 3,625 cases of family violence in 1994 were reported to the police. This works out to 70 cases per week or 10 cases per day. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experts think that the actual number of family violence cases is three to four times the total number reported and this opinion was confirmed by the Director of CID when he revealed figures for the number of spouse abuse cases. He said the reported figures were the tip of the iceberg, an expression which was used earlier on in the House. If this is true, then we could be having 10,000 to 12,000 cases of family violence occurring per year. But today I will confine myself to official reported figures. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, we had three elderly victims each week, four child victims each week and 13 spouse victims each week, who went to public sector hospitals for treatment sustained because of family violence. These figures are from the Ministry of Health. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of this, we have two to three cases each week when family members are injured with dangerous weapons or end up with broken bones, dislocations, permanent loss of sight or hearing, or any of the other definition of grevious hurt. This is as a result of domestic violence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Sir, we have 10 people every day making police reports of family violence and three people every day seeking hospital treatment from injuries resulting from domestic violence. Thus, can we have any doubt at all that family violence is a big problem? Having established that, our next task as responsible Parliamentarians is to ask ourselves: How do we curb this problem of family violence and yet ensure that the integrity and the fabric of the family is maintained? Fortunately, some cases of family violence are resolved by the family itself and with help from relatives, friends and religious leaders. However, for the 10 cases that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> report to the police every day and the three cases that seek hospital treatment every day, it is likely that informal avenues have failed and that is why these people have ended up as official statistics. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, Sir, let me hasten to assure the House that family violence is a universal problem and Singapore is no worse off than any other country. In fact, we might be a little better off especially in cases of homicide resulting from family violence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics alone tell us about numbers but there is a much bigger story behind these numbers. Let us look at the sad story. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The most important tragic result of family violence is the effect on children who grow up either witnessing it or being subjected to it. As family violence tends to be a hidden problem, we often forget that it may be the root cause of many of the social ills that afflict our young - dropping out of school, gang fights, juvenile delinquency, drug dependency, and poor performance in school. We spend so much time, effort, energy and money to address these social problems and yet we are so reluctant to address the likely root cause of these problems, ie, family violence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. These abused children grow up becoming abusers and victims and thus perpetuate the cycle of violence, ie, inter-generational violence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Family violence can also be a sizeable factor in incurring economic costs to the state in the form of court expenses, hospital expenses, cost of running shelters and of social service agencies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. One less obvious but very important effect of family violence is lost productivity from work. A recent study in Queensland (Australia) which has a population of three to four million people found that the cost of domestic violence is A$500 million per year. We have not got any studies to assess our own economic loss in this area. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be at our peril if in the face of this overwhelming evidence of the social problems resulting from family violence, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> we continue to regard family violence only as a private matter, only as a family dispute and only as an issue that ought to be settled by friends, relatives and community leaders. Let me illustrate the danger of relegating family violence to just a family matter. This real life story was reported in the Straits Times on 14th July 1994. I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A 4 year old girl died when her father stuck her head into a pail of water, the final act of abuse, after more than one year of ill treatment. When her aunt who is an administrative assistant saw her niece being beaten up regularly by the child's father, she did not report it because she felt it was a family affair and therefore, none of her business.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of us harbour the misconception that an admission of the existence of family violence will be an assault on the integrity of the family. Should we continue to hold on to this misconception and allow our families to erode from within by domestic violence? Or are we going to face up to the reality even though it is unpleasant? Are we willing to make tough decisions to curb this social problem? As leaders of Singapore, we have a reputation for tackling difficult problems and we should not flinch from our duty in this issue. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we have established that family violence is prevalent and a major social problem, how are we going to address this problem? The Acting Minister for Community Development is absolutely right when he said that family violence is a sensitive and intricate problem and legislation alone will not solve it. There has to be a multi-pronged approach involving public education, training of front-line professionals, cooperation between police and social service agencies, inter-ministerial coordination and many other strategies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from all these, we also need holistic legislation as a basic framework that is responsive to the dynamics and intricacies of family violence. Essentially, this legislation must provide the possibility of the restoration of a safe family and above all, a source of hope for victims, families and society as a whole, and even for abusers. The Family Violence Bill is an attempt to produce this responsive and responsible legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now quickly summarise some of the reasons for coming out with a separate piece of legislation to address the \"problem\" of family violence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Absence of any single legislative act that deals specifically with the issue of family violence - this absence called for a new separate all-encompassing and holistic legislation that would give focus to family violence as a key social problem but yet try to keep the family together. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Inappropriate legislation was being utilized - presently the Penal Code is applied in family violence cases where the injuries consist of broken bones and dislocations. In legal parlance, these are referred to as seizable cases. The Penal Code addresses the issue of violence between strangers and therefore is not suited for the sensitivity and complexities of abusive family relationships. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Inadequate protection provided by legislation in the form of the Women's Charter. Only three sections of the Women's Charter, out of 185 sections, deal with family violence and these three sections only legislate the issuing of Protection Orders. Protection Orders form only one aspect of family violence legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Insufficient powers of the Police to help victims of family violence - this was the feedback from the victims of family violence who felt that the Police were not able to help them adequately. The reason for this is not that the Police were not trying their best but, to some extent, their hands were tied because of the categorisation of injuries into simple hurt and grievous hurt. 95% of family violence cases fall into the category of simple hurt and therefore in most of these cases, the Police are unable to proceed with investigation and further action. However, we must remember that simple hurt is not simple. It involves bruising, haematomas, lacerations, kicking, choking, and yet in legal parlance it is simple hurt; but it is not so simple for the victim. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore need legislation that addresses all these gaps and concerns, taking into consideration the special \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> situation of violence occurring in relationships of family, trust and dependency. And thus the Family Violence Bill came into existence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Family Violence Bill is divided into four parts and each part has a specific purpose. The first part deals with the definition of family violence and also defines who is a family member. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part deals with Protection Orders, penalties for contravention of Protection Orders, referral by judges of abusers for counselling and powers of arrest to be attached to Protection Orders in some instances. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protection Orders are interim or long term orders in nature given by the Court to ensure the needs of the victim for personal safety. Legislation to deal with Protection Orders is formulated upon two beliefs: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) that family violence is only a private matter and therefore the burden is upon the victims to get protection for themselves by appearing in court; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) that the Protection Order will be an adequate deterrent against further episodes of violence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Mr Speaker, Sir, does not occur in reality. Often victims end up with multiple Protection Orders. This shows that the effectiveness of Protection Orders depends on the extent of respect shown by the abusers to these orders. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, existing legislation is not only inadequate in providing protection to victims but also it fails to send a strong signal to the abuser to end his or her violent behaviour. Therefore the root cause of family violence is not addressed. Feedback from voluntary welfare organisations, shelters and from victims themselves list the ineffectiveness of Protection Orders as being a major drawback in curbing domestic violence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Protection Orders are a necessary part of family violence legislation, they should not be the only and sole recourse for victims. Protection \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Orders do not take into consideration the full dynamics of abusive relationships where the victim suffers feelings of helplessness and hopelessness and yet is expected to initiate the process of obtaining the Protection Order for himself or herself. In fact, the process of obtaining a Protection Order may be difficult and demoralising for the victim although it may not appear as a hassle to you or me. And at this juncture, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to distribute the pamphlets of the Ministry of Community Development to Members. [Copies of pamphlets distributed to hon. Members.] \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, let me tell Members what it entails to get a Protection Order. The victim has first to go to the Family Court in Paterson Road (has to find where Paterson Road is) and swear a complaint. A week later after the summons for the abuser is ready, the victim returns to court and accompanies the court process server to identify the abuser so that the summons can be served on the abuser. After that, the victim has to go to court at least one more time and also the abuser has to go to court, assuming service is effective, and sometimes another two to three times before the Protection Order is issued. If the victim is an elderly person or a spouse with young children and cannot afford a lawyer, then one can imagine what a big burden this is for the victim. And if you look at the Ministry of Community Development's pamphlets, you see the feelings of the victims - ashamed, isolated, confused, powerless - and yet we expect these victims to go and get the Protection Orders themselves. Also, the whole process of obtaining a Protection Order is a public process and has to involve third parties - so this route does not necessarily guarantee that relations are not soured up between the parties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia has recently passed a Domestic Violence Act - the provisions of which are very similar to the Women's Charter amendments proposed by the Acting Minister for Community Development. The Malaysian Domestic Violence Act provides Protection Orders as the only recourse for victims. Subsequent to the passing of this legislation in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Malaysia, weaknesses in the Act have become apparent and there are second thoughts as to the adequacy of this type of legislation. Should we not be learning from the experiences of a neighbouring country which is culturally similar to us or should we be re-inventing the wheel? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In formulating the Family Violence Bill we were very mindful of the weakness of any legislation that limits itself to Protection Orders. Therefore we knew that we had to go beyond Protection Orders and this is the rationale for Part III of the Family Violence Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III of the Family Violence Bill provides enabling legislation for the Police to investigate cases of family violence even though the offence is considered \"non-seizable\" under the Penal Code. If the Police feel that there is sufficient evidence to prosecute a person for the offence, the Family Violence Bill further empowers the Police to inform the abuser that he or she will not be prosecuted if he or she submits himself or herself to a programme of counselling. If the offender agrees to this and there is no further incidence of violence on his or her part, then this is the end of the matter with the Police. However, if the abuser refuses to go for counselling or commits another act of violence, then the Police will prosecute the offender in court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as we are aware, this is the only legislation that allows mandatory counselling to be used as a rehabilitative measure for the abuser without any prosecution in court. In this sense, this innovative legislation is one of the first family friendly legislative approaches to be used anywhere in dealing with the issue of family violence. In other countries (eg, Canada, USA and Australia) counselling can only be mandated for abusers after prosecution in court and not as in the Family Violence Bill where the abusers are not brought to court but the Police can offer them counselling in lieu of prosecution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I wish to stress the following points about police intervention because many people have expressed fears about Police intervening in family matters and the possible abuses that may arise from this. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) By empowering the Police to carry out investigation of a case, we are not suggesting that in each and every case of family violence the Police have to take a pro-active approach and intrude into every home looking for violence as if they are looking for drugs or illegal immigrants. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) When victims do go to the Police to report violence in the home, it is a cry and a plea for help and often indicates that other avenues like extended family, friends and religious leaders have not been able to help and that is why the victims now turn to the Police. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) There may be some cases of reports made by victims of family violence where the Police feel that further investigation is not necessary, and in these cases the Police can use their discretion not to proceed further. Like any other offence reported to the Police, it is up to Police judgement to assess the situation. So you cannot have this scenario of a vindictive wife trying to fix her husband because the Police would be wise to that. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) In giving the Police more powers to investigate which include powers of arrest, it does not - and I repeat - it does not at all mean that the Police will automatically arrest the abuser after the offence is reported. In most cases the Police do not have to physically arrest the abuser. In nearly all cases of family violence, the abusers will give statements and allow police investigation after being asked to come to the station by the investigating officer by telephone or by letter. The powers of arrest need only come into play if the abusers refuse to cooperate and refuse to allow the Police to investigate the case. Powers of arrest are only latent and will not therefore sour up the relationship between the victim and the abuser. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>4.59 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to stress at this stage that the purpose of this Bill is not to include the isolated incident of abusive behaviour within the definition of family violence and therefore \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the Police will not be overburdened by minor complaints. Although distressing and regrettable, minor incidents of abuse probably occur within most intimate relationships. Thus, while all such behaviour is condemned, it is the persistence of such violence that establishes it as coming within the definition of family violence. The particular concern of this Bill is systematic and frequent violence in the family and not the isolated slap. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enhanced role of the police that the Bill seeks to legislate is in tune with the community's expectation of the role of the police in such situations and therefore the community will welcome this enhanced role of the police. In a survey conducted two years ago by Dr Alfred Choi and Dr Jeffery Elderson, 510 randomly selected Singaporeans were asked on their attitudes towards family violence. The data revealed unequivocal public support for police charging or arresting a spouse if he commits an assault that in the Penal Code only amounts to simple hurt. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Penal Code differentiates between \"simple hurt\" and \"grievous hurt\" cases. As I said earlier, grievous hurt includes fractures, dislocations, permanent loss of sight or hearing or some catastrophic event. If an injury is classified as a grievous hurt, then the police have powers to investigate and powers to arrest but if the injury is classified as simple hurt and this includes injuries like kicking, punching, choking, pushing or even hitting the head against the wall and if this results in bruises, black eyes, contusions, lacerations, haematomas - the police classify this as non-seizable, as simple hurt, and they are generally not empowered to investigate or arrest and therefore they cannot take up the case for the victims. This distinction of simple and grievous hurt is valid for violence between strangers because the violent episode is a one-off incident. It is not repeatable and the victim does not live in the same house as the offender. However, for family violence, this distinction of simple hurt and grievous hurt becomes artificial as the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> episodes of simple hurt are repeatable and yet the police cannot do much to prosecute on behalf of the victim. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this anomaly has been addressed in the Children and Young Persons Act where injuries and cruelty to children and young persons are considered as offences irrespective of whether it is a simple hurt or a grievous hurt. Child abuse is a specific crime punishable by specified penalties but is limited to children under the age of 16. Other victims of family violence, regardless of age, should get the same consideration from the justice system because they are also vulnerable members of society who equally need to be protected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, Part III of the Family Violence Bill follows the same principle as the Children and Young Persons Act where violence to vulnerable persons is treated as an offence. However, the Family Violence Bill differs in that it does not punish the abusers in the first instance by prosecuting them in court as legislated in the Children and Young Persons Act. Thus, the Family Violence Bill is more family sensitive than the Children and Young Persons Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the fears of some Members of Parliament, the Family Violence Bill is not criminalising family violence in the usual sense of the term. If that was the intention, then there would be no need for the Family Violence Bill as the Penal Code is presently available to carry out the function of criminalising violence in the home. Part III of the Family Violence Bill empowers the police to investigate a case of family violence but ensures that the police do not automatically prosecute the abuser even if there is sufficient evidence, as is done in other criminal offences. By offering counselling in place of prosecution, the whole tenor of the police investigation takes on a very healing and family-friendly approach and ensures that the family relationship is not strained. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I cannot think of any other course of action that is more family sensitive but at the same time effective in curbing family violence. What \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the Family Violence Bill is setting out to do is \"conditional\" criminalisation - the condition being that if suspected abusers go for counselling, then there is no further prosecution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is surprising is that, although the Acting Minister for Community Development and some MPs are against an effective police role in family violence and giving them more powers to investigate, this is not the view of the victims and the social workers. In a report in the Straits Times on 30th October dealing with the effectiveness of the amendments to the Women's Charter, the view of social workers was summarised thus and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The seven social workers interviewed were concerned that the amendments [that is to the Women's Charter] still placed the burden of action on the victims, and did not give adequate powers to the police to send abusers for counselling or to investigate complaints.' \n  <br>\n  <br>I would now like to quote Sister Delphine Kang who is the Sister in charge of the Good Shepherd Centre running a shelter for victims of family violence: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I support the proposal to empower the police to investigate all cases of reports on violence [and she means family violence]'. \n  <br>\n  <br>With her experience and her Catholic background, she is very aware of the need to keep families together and yet she also supports police intervention. This should help to allay our fear that police intervention might lead to family breakdown. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, please permit me to narrate some real life cases of family violence so that we can better relate to the experiences of the victims and their family, and the complexities and difficulties involved in family violence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are all real life stories. Case 1 concerns Mdm A who is a 64-year old Chinese woman - divorced - worked as a seamstress to bring up her daughter and son. Daughter moved out of mum's house and lived with her employer for four years and then their relationship broke down. At that time, mum persuaded daughter to move back with her. The daughter became \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> unhappy and since then has been verbally abusive to the mother and also beats her up physically every now and then. Mdm A also has a son who graduated from the National University of Singapore. On one occasion when the son beat up his mother, it caused swelling on her head and the mother had to go to Tan Tock Seng Hospital to get treatment for her injuries. Here, I would like to quote Dr Wong Kwei Cheong, who is not in this House, when he spoke on the Maintenance of Parents Bill and this is what he said [Hansard Vol. 63, Col. 324]: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The highest level of filial piety is to bring glory to one's parents; then followed by caring for them in their daily life, to maintain them is in fact the lowest. For we even feed and keep our dogs and horses. What is the difference, if we show no respect to them [that is, to our parents]?' \n  <br>\n  <br>In fact, we even beat them as we see from these cases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case that I had just mentioned of Mdm A, the son and daughter contribute financially to the mother's expenses but they continue to be abusive physically and verbally. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, if friends and relatives are unable to help, what recourse has this 64-year old Chinese lady? Can we imagine her being able to go to the Family Court to apply for a Protection Order for herself against her son and daughter? Being Chinese, she probably believes in the Chinese saying which I am not able to pronounce but, with Mr Deputy Speaker's permission, I am going to hold up the Chinese characters and Members can see for themselves. I am told this is what it says, \"Never go to court while you are alive and don't go to hell when you are dead\". So you can imagine how reluctant this old Chinese lady will be to go to court to get the Protection Order for herself. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Case 2. Mdm B - 76-year old Indian woman - widowed - and has two sons and three daughters. Lives with her eldest son. She was punched by this son and the grandson in February 1995. This incident was not reported. Then some time later, Mdm B was pushed by her grand-daughter who is an undergraduate at a local university. This assault resulted in a fracture of her left ribs and contusion of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> her left hand for which she was seen at the Accident &amp; Emergency Department of a hospital. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present provisions, if this case is reported to the police, the injury is considered as grievous hurt because of the fractured ribs and the penalty is jail. Obviously, the grandmother would not want her grand-daughter to go to jail but she wants the beating to stop. Under the Family Violence Bill, the grand-daughter could be sent for counselling instead of jail. The matter would remain within the family and the police, and the victim's son and grandson would also get the message and be deterred from beating up the old lady again. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Case 3. Sally gave up her career when she married Tim, an academic. He exerted an obsessive amount of control over her. He expected her to write a daily agenda and he would call her at random from his office to check on her. If Sally was late preparing a meal or took down phone messages incorrectly, he would physically lash out at her. Sometimes, he would wake up in the morning and remember something she had done the day before and he would thrash her. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incredible as it may sound, Sally still loved him despite his ill-treatment of her. Finally, after a particularly bad bout, she left the house to seek shelter at a crisis centre. Only when she heard that he was beating up the children, did she return home but the situation did not improve. She continued to be beaten. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, how do we ensure that Tim goes for counselling so that he stops beating up his wife and children? From the Ang Mo Kio domestic violence pilot project, we can see that abusers are reluctant to go for counselling because there is no legislative backing. However, under the provisions of the Family Violence Bill, Tim could be made to go for counselling without prosecution and this would give some hope to the family that he would stop beating them up and the family could remain intact. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, although we are discussing the Family Violence Bill, what is very much in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 108</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the minds of many of the Members is the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter disclosed recently by the Acting Minister for Community Development. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, these amendments are much needed and overdue. The Acting Minister for Community Development must be commended for coming up with more effective legislation in relation to family violence and this legislation is an improvement on the existing situation. However, the amendments may still not go far enough. This is not only my opinion, but the opinion of social workers and front-line professionals. And the reasons for saying this are: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. We already have the Malaysian feedback on the shortcomings of the Domestic Violence Act of Malaysia which is very similar to the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Women's Charter and the amendments are based on the premise that family violence is an affair of the family and the onus is upon the victims to obtain protection from the courts. Many victims are unable to take this initiative because the dynamics of continual family abuse leave them powerless and helpless. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By relegating family violence to an affair of the family, we are not sending a strong enough message that violence in the family is deplorable and society will not condone it. The rhetoric of just saying it without any legislative backing is not going to convince the abusers of the seriousness of this type of anti-social behaviour. And one of the most significant roles of the law is to make a clear statement to society that a particular conduct on the part of the citizens is unacceptable and will be socially condemned. Singapore has a formidable reputation for making this sort of clear messages and for maintaining law and order and dispensing justice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. In formulating legislation for family violence, Protection Orders cannot be the centre piece. Of course, the amendments announced by the Minister have given more effectiveness to the Protection Orders. But Protection Orders can only be one option available in the legislative armamentarium. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, research and experience from other countries show that the most effective deterrent against recidivism in family violence is the threat of police investigation and arrest. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Family Violence Bill encompasses all the amendments to the Women's Charter as proposed by the Minister. Therefore, the provisions in the two pieces of legislation should not be seen as competing. The additional provision in the Family Violence Bill about police intervention should be seen as one more option available to the victim. Whether this additional option is used by the victim will depend on the circumstances of the victim and the family. If the victim and the family are not comfortable with police investigation, they do not have to go to the police. They have the other recourse of getting Protection Orders from the court. All this, of course, does not exclude help from extended family, friends, etc. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I think we should be most concerned about this afternoon is not whether to accept the Women's Charter amendments and reject the Family Violence Bill. What we should be considering is what is the best way of providing protection for family members and yet strive to keep the family intact in situations of family violence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel sure that the Acting Minister for Community Development and all of us are united in this objective. Thus, I would like to urge that the debate in this House be carried out with this intention in mind. Let us not concern ourselves for the present on what name the legislation will take eventually and where this legislation will be sited. That is a peripheral problem. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central issue today is what are the main legislative provisions that will address the issue of family violence sensitively and effectively. I feel sure that the Acting Minister for Community Development will take cognizance of the debate and will incorporate the suggestions of this House into whichever legislation is decided upon eventually. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I sit down, Sir, I would like to remind ourselves that we must not forget \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the victim in this whole complex issue of family violence. The victim could be our child, our parent or our sibling. What are the recourses and options that we would want if the victim was someone near and dear to us? This question was put very succinctly by a columnist, Ms Irene Ng, in the New Paper yesterday and I quote her: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Which approach would you prefer if you are an abused victim? As for me, I would like the one which gives me more options - everything as Mr Abdullah proposed - plus this: The option to ask the police to investigate this case.' \n  <br>\n  <br>This seems to me like good advice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>5.18 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Yuhua):</b> Sir, I am glad that the problem of domestic violence is receiving the attention of the House today. My colleague, Dr Soin, has done a service to the community by raising awareness about the problem. She has reminded us that although most Singaporeans live in happy families, some unfortunately do not. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that violence within the family, whether against the women or an aged person or against a hapless child or even against a man, is undesirable. Society must show that it will not tolerate such behaviour. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we must see the issue in perspective. It is good to discuss the problem. However, we must be careful not to blow the issue out of proportion. We must not make it seem that family violence is the biggest problem that Singapore families face today. We do not want to frighten our young citizens into thinking that marriage is a declaration of war, the home a battle zone, and the bedroom the scene of war crimes! Neither do we want the Bill to be viewed as a piece of legislation that will result in constant conflict between the two genders, ie, men and women. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have met many community leaders and constituents over the years. During these meetings and the feedback sessions that I have chaired, they tell me that their \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> main problems revolve around the need to balance family and work responsibilities, especially when we encourage the couple to regionalise and to go overseas. They also worry about inculcating the right values in the young. The common view is that while some violence occurs in some families, the problem is not pervasive. According to the Feedback Unit session chaired by Dr Ow Chin Hock recently, the participants felt that we should adopt a conciliatory approach, rather than a confrontational or legalistic one. They also felt that rather than dilute the Women's Charter through having a separate legislation, amendments should be made to the Charter to strengthen it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be clear about our objective when tackling the problem of family violence. In the end, what we are working for is to help suffering families become healthy and strong, and to preserve family harmony. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping this objective in mind, let us see how we can tackle the problem in the most effective way. Sir, I believe that the approach must be a multi-pronged one. We must, first, strengthen existing laws. Second, streamline administrative procedures of the police. Third, provide training to qualified counsellors and train the police on how to handle family disputes. Fourth, provide community support for families with such problems through the Ministry of Community Development, voluntary organisations and grassroots organisations. And, most importantly, fifth, inculcate the right family values through homes, schools and public educational programmes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go to the proposed Bill, I wish to point out that as far back as 1992, the MCD had been reviewing the Women's Charter. In fact, in 1994, the Inter-Ministry Work Group on Spousal Violence chaired by the Ministry of Home Affairs together with some women's groups had started a pilot project aimed at improving the existing police and other procedures dealing with family violence. This had provided valuable inputs and formed the basis for some of the amendments that will be proposed to the Women's Charter. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 112</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I wish to touch on the proposed Family Violence Bill. In gist, the Bill is meant to provide for the following: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extending the coverage to the elderly and other family members; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;widening the definition of family violence to include other family offensive conduct and not just physical hurt, including compelling a family member by force or threat to engage in any sexual act or conduct; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;making counselling mandatory; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;making it easier for victims to obtain Personal Protection Orders; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;empowering the police to investigate and make arrest, if necessary, without a court order or warrant of arrest. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter will cover the key points in the proposed Family Violence Bill and which had also been raised by the Inter-Ministry Work Group on Spousal Violence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments to the Women's Charter will widen the coverage to include protection for parents, parents-in-law and siblings, other than spouses and children. It widens the definition of family violence so that it does not only include physical hurt but also the threat of causing hurt, restraining or confining victims against their will and harassments that may result in distress for the victims. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important proposed amendment to the Women's Charter is that it now makes it very much easier and faster for the victim to obtain a Personal Protection Order so long as the victim can prove on a balance of probabilities that violence will be committed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers of the court will also be broadened. The court will be able to attach a warrant of arrest to a Protection Order. This means that if the abuser hits the victim, the police is given the power to arrest him or her. The court will also be given broader powers to order counselling for the abuser. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 113</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the amendment allows a third party to apply for Personal Protection Orders on behalf of the abused child or incapacitated adult. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important issue in the Family Violence Bill is that when anyone makes a report of domestic violence, the police is expected to intervene, and can arrest without a court order or warrant of arrest. We agree that the police should be proactive in this issue and look into the case. However, I feel that this can be covered under the police operating procedures and need not be included in the law. My concern is that to stipulate it in the law or criminalise the whole issue at an early stage is premature. Such a drastic measure should not be supported. This is because interference from the police or a third party may aggravate the conflict between the abuser and the victim and affect the family relationship as a whole. The law must not be made too rigid to exclude personal choices and flexibility. It must protect the victim, but not take things out of their hands. The amendments to the Women's Charter serve therefore to protect the vulnerable members of our families and allow them to choose which course of action to take. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which the Family Violence Bill touches on concerns compelling a family member by force or threat to engage in any sexual act or conduct. I fully agree that sexual abuse of family members should be severely punished. And I note that this has already been provided for under existing laws, such as the Penal Code. Even for sexual relationship between spouses, if the victim can prove cruelty in the behaviour of one spouse that can constitute a ground for divorce. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sexual relationship between spouses is a very private and personal matter. It should not be brought under public scrutiny and be subject to prosecution under our law. From the feedback I have received, people have asked what amounts to marital rape. When can a wife be said not to give her consent to sex? Opening it to public scrutiny affects not only our Asian sensitivity on the issue, but it is also an area of conflict best resolved through counselling. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, given these proposed amendments to the Women's Charter, I am of the view that it is not necessary for us to have a separate piece of legislation. But more can be done to improve the procedures for handling family violence cases by the police and to improve the counselling services provided in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since police officers at the neighbourhood police posts may be the first people that abused victims approach for help, we must do more to train them to be more sensitive. We must also train them to be more supportive of victims and to be helpful in correct ways. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another channel should be provided to victims of family violence who for one reason or another choose not to go to the police. It has been proposed to appoint a Commissioner under the MCD to handle claims for maintenance under the Maintenance of Parents Bill. The Commissioner's scope of work can be widened to include providing conciliation and mediation to family members who are in conflict. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Community Development should continue expanding the number of Family Service Centres which can also act as the eyes and ears to seek out those who need help. Government should devote more resources to build up this support network. Within itself, MCD should set up a permanent unit to receive complaints from victims, provide counselling and rehabilitation to both abusers and victims and help victims to apply for Personal Protection Orders, if necessary. It should also set up a helpline for families in distress. We should look into the root cause of the problem. If family violence is caused by abusers who are addicted to alcohol, drugs or gambling, then these problems will first have to be addressed by making counselling and rehabilitative services available to such families. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide more effective counselling, MCD, together with voluntary organisations, should provide accredited professional training for counsellors, which is presently lacking in Singapore. I feel that MCD's budget of $1 million to promote \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> family values is too small. There are many creative ways we can come up with to promote family harmony, similar to the programme Extraordinary People which is shown on TV. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not be too ready to think that the law alone will solve the problem. It will not. In America, the law protects children from being abused by parents. That appears to be very good. But look what happened? Children have sued their parents for disciplining them! The number of child abuse cases is still increasing. The laws in the developed countries may be very comprehensive. But, in reality, does it mean that in terms of social development, family cohesiveness, husband and wife relationships, parents and children relationship of these countries are better off than us? I do not think so. We should not follow the developed countries blindly. Instead, in the long run, we should rely on our own values and experience to develop our own model of dealing with problems within the family. We should develop legislation in accordance with our own social norms and to suit our needs. We have taken this approach in many instances and I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, you will agree with me that we should continue to do the same in this particular case. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, whatever we do we should strike a balance between humanity, rationality and law. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, since this very important Bill requires the police to do so many things, I feel it is necessary for me to say something right at the outset. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, family violence of any degree, whether it is an intimidation or actual physical abuse, should not be taken lightly. The Ministry of Home Affairs and the Police do not condone such behaviour. As a society, we should prevent and deter such occurrences and protect the victims. It is not just a concern of breach of peace in a neighbourhood or of physical injuries being caused. More importantly, domestic violence, if left unchecked, can quickly lead to a breakdown of the family unit. It \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> affects not just the two parties in disagreement, but also the children, as Dr Soin mentioned. If a child sees heated quarrels and physical abuse constantly, he or she may become predisposed to violent behaviour in adult life. We should not allow this to happen. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not pretend that such a problem does not exist in our society. It is an age-old problem in all societies. No society today has eliminated this totally. There is also no evidence to suggest that those countries which resorted to legal responses are more successful in dealing with it. While we recognise that family violence does take place in some homes in Singapore, we should not exaggerate the scale and the extent of the problem. Nevertheless, I agree that more can be done to minimise it and to help families in distress. The question is what and how. In this light, let me laud Dr Soin's effort in drafting this Bill. She has done a good job at it. But whilst we must be firm in dealing with such cases of family violence, we should not be heavy-handed in dealing with a matter that involves emotions and family relationships. We should not hastily or mindlessly apply the full intrusive and coercive force of the law when this may not be the best course of action in the interest of the family. Some Singaporeans already complain that Singapore is overly regulated. Do we want another separate piece of legislation that calls on the Police to intrude into the family's living room, bedroom, or kitchen to deal with a family dispute whenever one is reported? Or to make a value judgment as to who is right or wrong in as complex a matter as a dispute between spouses? I will take it as a compliment that our Police Force has been asked to intervene in such private and personal matters as family disputes, as Dr Soin would have them do. The public's trust and confidence in the Police speaks well of the Police as an objective and impartial law enforcement agency. But are they the best people or in the best position to do this? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Soin thinks that the Police currently has insufficient powers to investigate and to deal with cases where only simple hurt is caused. This is simply not true. The Police does have powers to deal with \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> these cases. It can investigate simple hurt cases. It can warn or even prosecute the offending party under the Penal Code for the offence of Voluntarily Causing Hurt. In practice, when called to the scene of the family violence, the Police officer will intervene and separate the parties, warn the abusing party for his or her behaviour and breach of peace, if necessary. If a complaint is made at the Neighbourhood Police Post (NPP), the NPP will interview the complainant, warn the abusing party, if necessary, and advise the victim of the options open to him or her to seek legal protection. Where grievous hurt is caused, the Police will prosecute. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where only simple hurt is caused, the Police will warn or even prosecute the abuser if the circumstances warrant it, for example, in repeat cases. In 1994, Police took prosecution action in 14 cases of voluntarily causing hurt out of the 3,625 cases of domestic violence reported. In seven of these 14 cases, the victims later decided not to proceed against the accused in court. The prosecution had to respect their wishes in order not to worsen the situation at home. But you can imagine that a great deal of resources was wasted in these cases when the complainants later decided not to go ahead in bringing the culprits to court. You can also imagine the frustration of the investigation officer. But the Police had to respect their decision because it is important to keep the family intact. In the remaining seven cases, the accused persons were given prison sentences ranging from one week to six months. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just quote a couple of these cases. In one case, the accused punched his mother, ie, the victim, on the shoulder. The victim's brother intervened to stop any further assault from taking place. Both parties refused to heed the Police advice at the scene to resolve the matter amicably. The victim appeared to be in imminent danger of further assault. The Police then intervened. The accused was charged in Court and sentenced to one week's imprisonment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second case, the accused assaulted his wife, ie, the victim, after an argument over an alleged extramarital \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> affair of the victim. The accused, who smelt of alcohol on the arrival of the Police, was alleged to have kicked the victim on her stomach and her body. It was later determined that she did not sustain any serious injury. The victim appeared to be in imminent danger of further assault and the Police intervened. The accused was charged in Court and was given six months' imprisonment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Police does take action even on simple hurt cases when the situation justifies. But the Police does not warn or prosecute every case as a matter of routine because family disputes are by nature complex. They involve emotions and relationships among people in the same family. It is very difficult, if not impossible, for a Police officer to establish which party is right or wrong when he arrives at the scene. Indeed, in a family dispute situation, both parties may each have varying degrees of fault. The origin of the problem could have occurred a long time ago, or over a petty matter which either party could or would not take full responsibility for. It could also have been an accumulation of many incidents and neither party is completely right or wrong. Let me take this opportunity to quote from a note sent to me by the Society Against Family Violence about this complexity of family relationship. It says here: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the literature reviewing the process before, during and after an abusive situation, the abused women are not always portrayed as vulnerable or in a state of trauma. They are often equally violent. Family violence must be examined interactively, both parties having to take responsibilities for contributing to the fight. Abusive relationship is like an onion with many layers of forces working in competition against each other and in many strands of meanings, memories and feelings. Once we look at abuse in relational terms, we begin to take some blame of the men and return some responsibility back to the women to reach a balanced therapeutic management in the recovery process of the family. Ignoring such understanding reflects a lack of understanding of the complex emotions in the twining victims of violence.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This part which I quoted is not in the article that was published in today's Straits Times written by Ms Claire Chiang but it is the same note that she sent to me. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So under such circumstances, for a Police officer to intervene in every case, even if it is only to give a warning, would be inappropriate and heavy-handed, and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> may be accused of being biased. This is in fact what clause 13(1) requires the Police to do. It may be even counter-productive as Police involvement is likely to aggravate the distress in the family. There must be other ways to deal with the situation to address the root cause of the problem, eg, referring to a counselling body. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the issue is not giving more powers to the Police since they already have these powers, but whether the heavy hand of the law or the Police ought to intervene in every case where flexibility and great sensitivity is required. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many developed countries, policies and strategies have been introduced which have emphasised legal and police intervention to address family violence. Yet the assessment generally is that the legal responses can be blunt instruments and counter-productive in a number of cases. The belief in most societies, including ours, is that the family is and should remain our basic social institution. Strengthening and supporting the family should therefore be the primary objective of community-based preventive programmes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Soin also appears to think that the Government is not doing enough to address the problem. Is that really so? Since April last year, an inter-agency Work Group on Spousal Violence was formed by my Ministry to recommend measures to improve and coordinate the management of spousal violence cases and to find innovative ways in dealing with them. Here I would give credit to Dr Soin for the impetus in setting up this Work Group because after the last Committee of Supply debate when the subject was raised, I asked my Ministry to look into ways and means of dealing with this problem and I established this Work Group. Hence the Work Group was set up with representatives from MCD, Police, Ministry of Health and the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations (SCWO) to seriously study how we should cope with this problem. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year later in March 1995, the Work Group in its progress report to the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Community Development recommended that: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, conflict resolution be introduced into the Police management of domestic violence on the ground. The component of conflict resolution would involve the VWOs and would be coordinated by MCD. So we started a pilot project in the Ang Mo Kio Police Division in April this year. I will say more about this afterwards. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, priority was given to the preparation of medical reports for court purposes and a revised medical form be used to enable the court to issue a Personal Protection Order (PPO) immediately on application by the victims; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the training needs of all service providers be reviewed. The subject of domestic violence would be included in the training syllabus for Police Officers; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, a database on domestic violence cases be built up to facilitate policy formulation; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, the current public education efforts be improved to increase public awareness of the problem and the assistance available to them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these recommendations are very useful. As MCD was at that time reviewing also the Women's Charter, the Work Group recommended that MCD introduce provisions to strengthen the protection given to victims of spousal violence by attaching powers of arrest to all PPOs in the first instance, introducing compulsory counselling for abusers if the situation demands, and specifying the penalties for breach of PPOs. In short, the Work Group has addressed quite a number of the main provisions of this Family Violence Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also mention that at the operational level, the CID has a Women and Family Violence Committee to discuss operational issues concerning the investigation of rape, molest and domestic violence cases. This forum which includes representatives from the SCWO and various Heads of Investigations of Police Divisions discusses such matters as the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> use of more female police officers and the special training of investigators for handling such cases. It also discusses specific cases of child abuse, rape and family violence. This Committee was formed in 1992 when it was then called the Rape Management Committee. But in November 1994, it expanded its agenda to include also molest and family violence cases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now say a few words about this pilot project which introduces conflict resolution to the handling of spousal violence cases reported to the Police. The project is being carried out at Ang Mo Kio Police Division and involves five NPPs, namely, Cheng San, Chong Boon, Ang Mo Kio, Teck Ghee and Kebun Bahru and two Volunteer Welfare Organisations (VWOs), namely, Ang Mo Kio (Family) Service Centre and HELP Family Service Centre. The pilot project has been on-going since April this year. A preliminary report put up by Police HQ indicates that in the period 17th April 1995 to 16th October 1995, the five NPPs recorded a total of 68 cases of spousal violence. Of these, 18 (or 26%) were referred to the two family service centres for counselling. In the remaining 50 cases, three were undergoing counselling, six had reconciled and 41 turned down offers of counselling. Of the 41 victims who turned down counselling, 13 indicated that they were filing for divorce whilst the vast majority did not want any third party intervention because they made their report only for the purpose of record. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 18 cases referred to the VWOs for counselling, two are repeat cases and the victims are still undergoing counselling. But they have refused to have their spouses prosecuted. One of them was offered temporary shelter by the VWO but she declined. Of the 18 cases referred for counselling, the VWOs have reported good progress made on four cases, satisfactory progress on 10 and the other four cases were terminated by the victims. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pilot project shows promise as a constructive community-oriented approach to the issue of family violence. It has, however, revealed that in a large majority of cases, victims made police reports only for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> record purposes, some to buttress their case for a divorce. Some others simply did not want to involve a third party, ie, the counsellors, in their problems. The two family service centres involved in the pilot project are very supportive and I thank them for that. But in their feedback, they have expressed some concern that if the case load increases significantly, they would not have sufficient trained counsellors to sustain the programme. Indeed, I see this as a major constraint in implementing Dr Soin's proposal on compulsory counselling for the abuser and the abused if the abuser does not want to be prosecuted. Given the Bill's approach to make family violence a seizable offence, all this will demand a huge amount of counselling resources. Singapore today simply does not have enough qualified and experienced counsellors to cope with this demand as they are also needed to counsel other types of cases, for example, juvenile delinquents, drug abusers, and so on. And petitioners like these two family service centres and the association against family violence should know well enough. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD and my Ministry support the recommendations of this Work Group. These, together with the pilot project, offer a conciliatory approach to family violence. The Family Violence Bill, on the other hand, seeks to involve Police at the very outset, leans towards an adversarial if not a combative approach. The Bill also has the effect of criminalising family violence. Dr Soin may say, no, not quite. But let me elaborate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, clause 9(1) of the Bill makes the commission of an act of family violence a specific offence. Such acts include even the \"causing of harassment with intent to cause anguish to a family member\". Offenders, even first timers, can be jailed (clause 9(1)). Is this what the people want? Can we imagine what will happen to the family if the offending party is jailed for abusing the victim even the first time round? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, clause 13(1) empowers the Police to arrest an offender without an order from the Magistrate and without a warrant of arrest. This amounts to making family violence a seizable offence which is \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> what the Bill is intended to do, and just like offences as theft, robbery, housebreaking and voluntarily causing grievous hurt. Is it necessary to go this far? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, clause 13(1) also obliges the Police to investigate every complaint whenever information is received or whenever the complaint is made. Currently in none of our present laws is the Police required to investigate every matter reported to the Police. The Police can exercise discretion and it does so wisely. When the Police carries out an investigation, it is to establish whether an offence has been committed and to take enforcement action accordingly. That is the meaning of \"investigation\". Do we really want the Police to investigate every report when it may be better to call a counsellor, or maybe even to leave the matter be if Police investigation would only aggravate the problem? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think we should criminalise family violence. We should leave that to the Penal Code. Perhaps it is not Dr Soin's intention to criminalise family disputes, but this is what the Bill amounts to. Nor should we require by law the Police to intervene and investigate every case and effect an arrest without a Court Order. A typical police constable on the ground is one in his twenties and many are not yet married. In fact, almost half (45%) of our 2,950 junior officers are below 25 years of age. Given the complexity of family violence cases, he will have to refer this case to his Sergeant who is more experienced and mature to consider the circumstances and make the crucial decision whether to arrest and prosecute. This will be the scenario if the Bill becomes law and all acts of family violence become seizable offences. Do we want to use our Police Sergeants to respond to every complaint of family violence at the expense of their attention to crimes on the streets? We should get our priorities right. Or does Dr Soin want to empower our young police constables to investigate and decide whether the abuser and the victim should be sent for counselling? He is under 25 years old. Of course, he knows and is trained to do his \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> job. Indeed, the Police Commissioner has introduced the concept of empowerment to his officers. By this, police officers on the ground are encouraged to adopt a \"take charge\" attitude and exercise initiative and responsibility where appropriate. However, there are situations where judicious restraint is called for and family dispute is one of them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Soin's Bill also covers other family members, for example, children and the elderly. Our society does not condone spousal violence; similarly, we also do not condone mistreatment or abuse of children and the elderly. Children deserve special protection; the elderly, our respect. In protecting children against family violence, we must, however, not unwittingly blur the difference between real abuse and disciplinary measures such as scolding or parental caning. Although clause 3(2) of the Bill excludes force used on a child \"by way of correction\", the Bill's wide definition of family violence coupled with making family violence a seizable offence, may in time bring about a situation where parents would think twice before applying disciplinary measures on their children for their own good. This is worsened by the fact that the Bill also encourages reporting of family disputes or violence by members of the public (clause 19). I think members are aware of a case in the USA reported last year in September in The New Paper that a mother slapped her child; somebody complained to the Police, the Police came, arrested the mother and wanted to charge her for abusing the child. But, fortunately, with wisdom, the Police decided eventually to drop the charge. As an Asian society which believes in the strict upbringing of children, we cannot afford to let this happen. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I understand Dr Soin's passion on the issue of family violence, I do not go along with the Bill's heavy-handed approach in dealing with family violence. Dr Soin quoted a Chinese couplet. It says \" \" (Sheng bu ru ya men, si bu ru di yu). I think we have to understand the historical and cultural context under which that couplet was framed. In the old days, in the Magistrate's Court in China, the Magistrate was \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> both the judge, the prosecutor and the Police. And of course people at that time also preferred to settle matters on their own through the clansmen and the elders of the clan, rather than to involve a third party like the Magistrate's Court. So it is important to understand that. But today, in Singapore's context, it is different. I think Singaporeans are not afraid of going to the Police. We have our NPPs and community policing. It has been successful for the last 12-13 years. People are very willing to go to the Police whenever they have a complaint to make. And that is seen from the examples dealt with by our NPPs and from the many episodes I heard from my Police Officers. The people are now prepared to go to the Police. So we should not worry about that too much. In fact, to quote another Chinese saying, I think we are also fully aware that \" \" (Qing guan nan pan jia wu shi), which means that even the most honest judge cannot deal with family matters. There is also another Chinese saying: \" \" (Jia he wan shi xing), which means that when you have a peaceful and harmonious family, then everything will be peaceful and calm. \" \" (Jia shuai shi bu ping) means that when you always quarrel, you will never have a harmonious family. I think in our context, we will rather have Jia he wan shi xing to deal with this problem ourselves, rather than to go to the Police. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, family disputes occur in diverse situations and the needs of the family in each situation vary because of the relationships and emotions involved. For this reason, the parties involved should be handled with understanding and sensitivity, and not always with the cold and strong arm of the law. I prefer a more mediatory and conciliatory approach which gives the family in distress a better chance of resolving its problem, with the Police intervening only in the more serious situations, where there is a breach of court order or where the situation is assessed to likely lead to serious hurt. Amending the Women's Charter along the line recommended by the Work Group offers a better legal framework for addressing the problem in the best interest of the family and our future generation. At the same time, more should be done by \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> community and social service organisations to understand and analyse the root causes of family violence, and to devise innovative and therapeutic intervention techniques in dealing with such situations. They need to build up their resources to cope with the increasing demand for their service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, more also should be done to strengthen and support the family rather than introducing another wedge to divide it through a separate and new legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Bernard Chen (Brickworks GRC):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me at the outset state that, just like any other Members of this House, we are well aware of the problems facing families. In my 18 years as a Member of Parliament, I have conducted 15,000 meet-the-people cases, like many of you, and I have come across innumerable family disputes, between husbands and wives, parents and children, grandparents and grandchildren. There were of course the usual problems between in-laws. These disputes came in all shapes and sizes and there cannot be a definition that can encompass all of them. Suffice to say that most of them are extremely complicated and difficult to resolve. Second, as a Roman Catholic, I am a firm believer in upholding family values and the preservation of family harmony. The Catholic faith, as in most other religions, believes that family is the core of society. Without family peace, there can be no peace in the society at large. It is, therefore, incumbent upon all of us to nurture and promote family harmony for the good of society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, however, the problems of family are non-exact. They arise from a wide range of causes and different parties. Complicating these problems is the abstract concept of love and trust between spouses, parents and children. There are also all kinds of pressures from within the families, heightened by pressures from outside. This explains why in centuries past, whether in Asia, Europe or America, family disputes have persisted and no government has yet been able to put this problem to rest. It is quite likely that for centuries to come, we will continue to grapple with these problems. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty lies in how much and how far should government get involved in the resolution of such disputes. At what point should the government intervene, if at all, at the dispute stage or when such disputes erupt in physical violence or unbearable mental torture? A key question to address is: if love is the basis of marriage and when such love is lost, can government force the parties together by way of legislation? Again, in the case of disputes between parents and children, without a good understanding of the forces at work, can government resolve the problems to the satisfaction of all and not risk making the problems worse by such intervention? Conventional wisdom suggests that legislation is not the answer and government should stay out of these frays because it is not equipped to solve the problems satisfactorily. In the cases of family disputes, I have come across as an MP, I feel more often than not helpless in finding solutions that would resolve the problems that can satisfy all. The exception is when actual physical violence occurs or about to be inflicted. Existing legislation have adequately covered such cases and, if need be, as the Minister for Home Affairs pointed out just now, these legislation can be tightened to make them more effective. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean, however, that we should not do anything. On the contrary, much can be done by other indirect means. For example, we can start at the schools and work on the young people before they enter marriage. We can promote the concept of filial piety among our children. We can also persuade our elderly that love and respect is a two-way traffic. They must be able to give as well as receive. Another way is to get the voluntary organisations to be more involved, as stated by many Members just now. They are better trained to handle the problems. To the parties in dispute, they are more acceptable as they are not as heavy handed and final as the government. Religious organisations can also be enlisted to help. All religions subscribe to family harmony. While we have to watch out for religious sensitivities, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> much can be achieved if these organisations can provide conduits for the resolution of such disputes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that all these programmes are now in place, under various Ministries and organisations. We have to see that they are pursued with earnestness and those doing the jobs are given the resources and training to do so. Having said all these, we have not come to the core of the problem, how to tackle the issue of \"love\" and the lack of it that would eventually lead to family problems. My parish priest, who is now 82 years old, often said to newly-wed couples in the church that marriage is no joke. Before marriage, he says, pimples become dimples. After marriage, dimples become pimples. How to make dimples stay as dimples is, I submit, not the job of the government, but the participants themselves, whether they are spouses, parents or children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the Family Violence Bill tabled by the Nominated Member of Parliament. Clause 3 of the Bill gives the definition of \"hurt\" or what constitutes as family violence. I find the definition to be too wide and general. For example, \"attempting to place a family in fear or hurt\". What constitutes \"attempt\" and \"fear\"? The Bill puts the onus on the court to decide. How would the Court decide, without having to spend considerable time to delve into the complicated details? The definition in clause 3(e) on \"harassment\" is another. What constitutes \"harassment\" and the \"anguish\" caused? Can the husband's refusal to talk to the wife be considered as harassment as it causes anguish to the wife? In the same token, does the wife's constant nagging constitute harassment? Clause 3(d) defines wrongful restraining or confining a family member against his will. How will the Court decide a case where a teenager accuses his parents for not letting him out at night for a variety of reasons? It could well be that when my son is stopped from going to see midnight shows by me or by the mother, he can actually sue us under the Family Violence Bill, and why not in the NPP. Finally, how do we treat the case where a family \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> member accuses the other of compelling him/her by force to engage in any sexual act or conduct? Who is going to be the arbiter in such intimate relations between husband and wife? Definitely, not the Government. In all these cases, the introduction of a third party, a stranger to all the family members, is going to make matters worse. It forces everyone to take a defensive stance and abandon the better expedient of give-and-take. It will further reinforce fighting among the families and breakdown in discipline, leading to more family violence. I find it difficult to support these definitions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One purpose of the Bill is to put the onus on the courts to decide on issuing Protection Orders. Further, the courts are asked to decide in cases where there is a \"balance of probabilities that family violence has been or is likely to be committed\". This is a tall order for the courts, given the myriad of scenarios that lead to family disputes which may or may not end up in violence. The Bill further requires the Police to play a much more direct role in dealing with family disputes, including providing assistance to seek alternative residence or shelter. With due respect, as the Minister for Home Affairs said just now, the Police is not trained nor equipped to deal with such problems. This may be true of TV dramas. In real life, the Police's main duty is to maintain law and order. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more fundamental issue is whether such direct intervention by the courts and Police will, in fact, solve the problems. I would suggest that they will make matters worse. It is human nature to resent interference from authorities. Such resentment is more so in Asian societies, where going to the court is often deemed to be bringing shame to the family. It is often the last resort. By the time the courts are enlisted to help, the point of no return is reached and breakup of the family becomes inevitable. The very act of going to the court will break up the family. If we make it easier for everyone to go to the courts, we can expect families to disintegrate with increasing frequency, not only between spouses, but also amongst parents and children. We should not force families to go to the brink by encouraging \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> them to go to the courts or the Police. Rather, we should get them to try other means of reconciliation that will go to preserve the fabrics of family harmony. In the end, family members must themselves try to resolve the problems without government intervention. The Government can only help in clearly defined cases where complainants themselves ask for help and are prepared to accept the consequences that may follow, including the breaking up of families. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, I believe that this Bill would create more problems than it solves. It introduces an unnecessary third party into disputes which can better be resolved amongst the parties themselves. By intervening at the wrong time and place, it will make matters worse. Cases of family disputes which have resulted in actual violence are adequately covered by present legislation which can be further improved to take into account new requirements. I am therefore unable to support this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chin Harn Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to comment on the Family Violence Bill. I think Dr Kanwaljit Soin must be commended for bringing up to the attention of this House a matter which seems not to have been covered in our laws. On her own initiative and with her own resources, she has prepared a Bill for this House to consider. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the ball is at our feet, so to speak. When the Bill was first moved, I believe there was some reaction against legislating on family violence. This objection is based on the ground that family violence is not all that common in Singapore. As the Acting Minister for Community Development has confirmed his intention to amend the Women's Charter to reflect the tenor of the Bill, there should be no more argument about the need to regulate family violence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question before this House is the actual form of legislation to be adopted - making a new Act or enlarging an existing Act. The Minister has given his cogent reasons for the Members here to believe that his proposed amendments to the Women's Charter will serve the desired purpose. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I myself favour the proposed amendment of the Women's Charter because this Act is meant to serve as a framework for the protection of women and children. As such, the Women's Charter can serve as a basis for future consolidation of legislation on related matters. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter do not contain all the provisions of the Family Violence Bill, I support the amendments on a longer term view. I see the Women's Charter as a building with a strong foundation and a strong framework to permit more storeys to be added on later. The Family Violence Bill or, for that matter, the Maintenance of Parents Bill, is like a structure that is designed to be a single-storey or double-storey building. You have to pull down the whole building and rebuild, if you want some more rooms, like what you see is going on in the private housing estates. Although not a betting man, I would prefer to put my money on the Women's Charter as the Act with a scope for future expansion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the liberty of reading between the lines of the Ministerial statement on the Women's Charter, I like to believe that there would be further amendments to the Women's Charter. One amendment I like to see is that the Women's Charter includes provisions on Muslim marriage, divorce and maintenance. Another amendment I like to see is the incorporation of the Maintenance of Parents Bill into the Women's Charter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one amendment I particularly like to see is the renaming of the Women's Charter to reflect the increasingly bisexual character of its provisions. Sir, a change in the name of the Women's Charter seems to me inevitable if the Act is to be amended also to regulate family violence and, possibly, maintenance of parents, regardless of sex. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the main thing is that there should be some legislation to regulate family violence and related matters, be it Women's Charter, Hen-pecked Husbands' Charter or whatever other name. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we believe that anyone who uses violence in the family should be punished. Therefore, the Workers' Party supports legislating to protect the weaker members in the family. At the same time, we feel that family violence concerns not just violence, but also the individual character and personality of the members of the family as well as the complicated aspects of human relationship. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In legislating, we have to take into consideration the legal procedure and the appropriateness of the unit responsible for enforcement of the law. The Workers' Party supports the principle and spirit of the Family Violence Bill, but with regard to the contents of the Bill, we are unable to accept the following provisions: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, clause 13 of the Bill provides that upon receipt of a complaint of family violence, the Police can arrest the abuser without having first to obtain a warrant of arrest from the court. We agree that the Police can interfere in a case of family violence, but only at an appropriate time. It will not be prudent for us to legislate in such a way as to allow the Police to arrest the party concerned without a warrant of arrest. Besides, when a family dispute becomes very heated, it would require someone who is very mature and experienced to deal with it. So, who shall be the best person to handle such a situation? Do not forget that nowadays a lot of policemen are young national servicemen. Do they have enough experience and a sense of judgment to interfere in a case of family violence and not to make things worse? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, clause 19 of the Bill provides that anyone who has reason to believe that family violence is being or has been committed may give information with respect thereof to the police. Upon receipt of the information, the Police will have to investigate into and intervene in the matter. This provision can easily be abused. When someone gives information, the Police starts its investigation, and may make a wrong decision and even decide to arrest a certain member of the family. Then a simple dispute in a family may escalate \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> into serious trouble just because someone informs the Police, resulting in the breaking up of the family. I think if the victim in a family violence seeks help from the Police, there is no cause for criticism. However, if we legislate to allow any third party to give information to the Police upon which the Police must commence investigation and intervene in the matter, there will be serious sequelae. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Dr Soin has introduced this Bill, the Government also announced that it was going to amend the Women's Charter to offer more protection to the victims in family violence. The brief contents of the proposed amendments were announced in the newspapers only on 27th October 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acting Minister for Community Development said in a dialogue session that family violence was not a new issue and that the Government had been looking closely into this matter since 1993. Why is it that after looking into the matter for such a long time, the Government has not been able to legislate effectively? This is indeed most regrettable! \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I am unable to know the exact contents of the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter, and I am not sure whether the amendments would incorporate all the details and provisions in the Family Violence Bill. I am also unable to determine whether the amended Women's Charter will be more effective in dealing with family violence matters than the present Family Violence Bill, especially clause 20(1) of this Bill which deals with how enforcement officers could better help victims in cases of family violence. Will the amended Women's Charter make it easier for victims of family violence to lodge a complaint? Or will it be just giving the victims some false hope and feeding them on illusions? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be fair to Dr Soin and to be fair to the proposed Women's Charter (Amendment) Bill, I move that Parliament do postpone the debate on this Bill until the Government has introduced the Women's Charter (Amendment) Bill, and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> we could debate the two Bills together during the Second Reading of the Women's Charter (Amendment) Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In English): Sir, I would like to move a motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Are you moving a motion? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I would like to move a motion to defer further debate on the Family Violence Bill in view of the proposed introduction of amendments to the Women's Charter. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Low, if you would like to move a motion, please put it on paper and give it to the Clerk of Parliament. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kampong Glam GRC):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all Singaporeans cherish the desire of building strong family ties. Nobody likes to see violence, whether physical or emotional, in the family. It is destructive, it is depressing and it is demeaning. The Government has been looking into this seriously in the last two years. As early as 1993, MCD has embarked on a comprehensive review of the Women's Charter. In 1994, an Inter-Ministry Work Group has been set up to address spousal violence issues and concerns. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Family Violence Bill, tabled by Dr Kanwaljit Soin, somewhat duplicates a significant portion of the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter. Nevertheless, the spirit of her Bill is laudable, her efforts commendable. The problem is that the cart was placed before the horse. Dr Soin publicised her Bill and with the ensuing media blitz, she has touched the hearts of many Singaporeans. I give her credit for her efforts. But the Ministry of Community Development, who chose not to publicise their proposals in the past two months or before because the amendments are still being fine-tuned, has somehow not been given due credit, either by the press or by some sectors of the public. The press said that the Minister killed the Bill. The Ministry of Community Development and the Minister deserve much more credit as they had initiated the whole process more \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> than two years ago, long before the Family Violence Bill was conceptualised, as Dr Soin said, 1 1/2 years ago. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one, not even the Minister, is opposed to the broad principles of Dr Soin's Bill. What the Ministry of Community Development is saying is that when we have an existing legislation which could be amended, it is meaningless to have another new legislation. It does not make any sense. It would be like reinventing the wheel. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should develop comprehensive family laws incorporated into one legislation and for this, the Women's Charter is the most appropriate vehicle. The Charter, when it was first enacted, was hailed as enlightened law. It still is. It requires some fine-tuning. Many representations to the Select Committee on the Maintenance of Parents Bill asked for the establishment of comprehensive family laws. In this regard, first, the title of \"Women's Charter\" should be amended and I would urge the Minister to do so. It could perhaps be called \"The Family Code\", not the Husbands' Charter, as Mr Chin Harn Tong has said. We could then bring about other related laws into this Code. Many men ask half in jest, half in sarcasm, where is the Men's Charter? This Family Code would cover every member of the family. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we develop this Family Code, we cannot simply ape the legislation and policies of the western or other societies because social norms differ. During a recent regional meeting, I discussed the Family Violence Bill with some of my ASEAN parliamentary colleagues and, in particular, I had the benefit of drawing on the experience of a legislator from Malaysia. He felt that their Domestic Violence Act 1994 was not working very well in Malaysia, as Dr Soin has said. But the difference is that I understand from professionals and even from the senior officials of MCD that the Family Violence Bill, and not the amendments to the Women's Charter, is modelled after the Domestic Violence Act. In other words, it is the Family Violence Bill which is being modelled after the Domestic Violence Act \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of Malaysia, and not necessarily the amendments to the Women's Charter. So, as it does not work in Malaysia, I feel that we should evolve our own law and not adopt laws from other jurisdiction whose social and economic conditions may differ or where such laws simply do not work. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Family Violence Bill would encourage a confrontationalist attitude in the family. We cannot allow this to happen to our basic building block of our society. Contrary to Dr Soin's intention of containing family break-up, it would instead lead to diametrically opposite consequences. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are an Asian society. Our legal system which is largely based on the English system is adversarial. Our family law should reflect the social values of our society and we should cut off our dependency on English legal precedents. We should encourage mediation, conciliation and counselling. I had made this same point during the debate on the Maintenance of Parents Bill. I am happy to note that the Select Committee has adopted this approach in their recommendations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of mediation and conciliation has also been proposed by a senior lawyer, Mr Shriniwas Rai, in his letter to the Straits Times published on 18th October 1995. Mr Rai called for development of our family law which reflects our own society's needs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point that I would like to make on the Family Code is that cases of family violence should not end up in criminal courts, as envisaged in the Bill. Instead, cases involving family violence, both physical and emotional, should be heard by the Family Court. Differences between family ought to be tried in an atmosphere of conciliation rather than confrontation. I would urge the Government to transfer the entire divorce, custody, maintenance and matrimonial property disputes from the High Court to the Family Court. The Family Court should be assisted by full-time trained conciliation officers. This Court should come under the purview of the Ministry of Community Development rather than the judicial system. It should \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> be headed by a President who should be a family man or woman. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now let me comment on the provision in this Bill for police intervention. To me, this is by far the most bizarre and perhaps the most unpragmatic aspect of this Bill. The Minister for Home Affairs has spoken at length as to why this is unpragmatic. This provision criminalises family violence and could exacerbate the already fragile family relationship. If this becomes law, soon our Neighbourhood Police Posts (NPPs) will have to be renamed Family Counselling Service Centres. Let us not get carried away. We have about 7,000 full-time regular policemen in Singapore and some more National Servicemen. Their primary job is to keep Singapore crime-free and to keep our roads safe for motorists and pedestrians. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give a simple analogy of a policeman's intervention to a family violence call. I will use the scenario of a traffic accident as an analogy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two cars collide in a road accident, and if a traffic cop is nearby or is summoned to the scene, he is not going to arbitrate to determine who is right and who is wrong. Neither is he going to counsel the two drivers. All he would probably do is to just book them, book them both, or arrange to arrest them, if necessary, and get them to clear the road as soon as possible. That is what he is trained to do. And if he ever tries to counsel them, I sure do not want to be caught in the ensuing traffic jam. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point that I am making is that police intervention could lead to a more adversarial and confrontational approach to the issue of family violence. It would be difficult to train the crime busters to become patient family counsellors, as the Minister has pointed out. The job of investigation and counselling should be left to the social workers, the professional counsellors and the Volunteer Welfare Organisations (VWOs). I cannot imagine how the police officers, especially young 18 year old National Servicemen can effectively deal with complex family violence matters. According to the findings \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 138</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of the Inter-Agency Working Group on Spousal Violence, the pilot project at Ang Mo Kio Police Division has shown that the majority of the family violence cases do not want outside intervention, especially police intervention. The police should only be brought in when there is physical hurt. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I maintain that police intervention is not the answer to handling family violence cases, I strongly endorse that no effort should be spared in finding other means to assist the victims quickly and to appropriately preserve the family. At the same time, recalcitrant wrong-doers and abusers must be punished sufficiently to ensure that it becomes a severe deterrent for other potential violators. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the feedback that I have received from the Indian community is that family violence is on the rapid increase and that the Government should take appropriate steps to bring it down. Ten years ago the divorce rate in the Indian community was low. Now it is rapidly increasing. Both parents are now working and as a result they spend less time not only with the children but with each other. Children are at the receiving end. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SINDA and other community organisations are trying to step up their drive to build strong family ties. The Ministry of Community Development and SINDA have jointly produced a filmlet on family. This filmlet has received favourable feedback from the community. Therefore, while legislation is necessary, public education on family ties is just as important, if not more important, and the Government must continue to allocate sufficient resources towards this end. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to refer to an article written by journalist Ms Wang Hui Ling in the Sunday Times on 15th October 1995. In this article Family violence deserves support, she made a passionate appeal to MPs to support the Family Violence Bill. In her opening paragraph she said, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nominated MP Kanwaljit Soin's Family Violence Bill seems unlikely to become law, judging from the reactions of Members of Parliament interviewed by the press so far.' \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> She goes on to explain why it deserves support and she ends by saying, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`MPs might want to ask themselves this when discussing the issue: If my parents, my daughter or son were in this situation, which piece of legislation would I want in place to protect them.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out to Ms Wang that when the PAP MPs, I do not know about the Opposition MPs, debate in Parliament, they would not in any way be prejudiced by pecuniary interests. As legislators and as peoples' representatives, we approach issues in exactly the same way, whether it affects or protects our kinship or our constituents. I hope Ms Wang is enlightened about how the PAP MPs approach parliamentary debates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would urge the Minister to eventually send the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter to a Select Committee where the public could be invited to give suggestions to improve the Bill. In this way, we would be getting the public to make valuable contributions to the proposed amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member for Jalan Besar GRC, Mr Peh Chin Hua, made a submission to the Select Committee on the Maintenance of Parents Bill. Similarly, the former NMP, Mr Chia Shi Teck, also made a similar representation. I would therefore urge Dr Soin to do so if the Women's Charter is sent to the Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after Dr Soin has listened to the views of this House, I would urge her to withdraw this Bill. Today's discussion is very beneficial. I am sure that the Minister would take the views of the Member and other Members into consideration when he makes the amendments to the Women's Charter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although I do not agree entirely with Dr Soin's Bill, I would nevertheless like to acknowledge the contribution that she has made in enriching family law. I like to believe that she has achieved her objectives. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I would try to be brief considering the time we have reached. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have listened carefully to all the speeches that have been made in this House. It seems to me that we have broad agreement on a lot of things. We are agreed that the law is not a panacea and that the law is not the first line of defence against the erosion of family values. It is education, it is creation of an atmosphere, creation of a societal value, that preserves the family. But we must also be aware that we cannot leave it entirely to education of the morals. You look at China, it has got 4,000 years of history and it is still not a perfect society. I do not think we ever would reach a perfect society. Every moral imperative has to have some sort of support from the law if it is to be effective. We have heard from the Minister for Community Development and the Minister for Home Affairs that they are basically in agreement with the principle that the laws we presently have need to be enhanced. If one looks at the press statement that was issued by the Ministry of Community Development, one cannot but be struck by the fact that many of these proposals are in fact almost the same as those contained in the Bill that has been proposed by Dr Kanwaljit Soin. If I may just take this House through the proposals in the MCD's paper. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment (1). To extend protection to cover other victims who in the opinion of the court should be regarded as a member of the family. That is in the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment (2). To provide a wider coverage on types of actions which can be considered as family violence, wilfully or knowingly placing or attempting to place the victim in fear of physical injury, causing physical injury to the victim by such act which is known or ought to be known would result in physical injury, confining or detaining the victim against the victim's will, causing mischief or destruction or damage to property with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause distress or annoyance to the victim or causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause distress \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to the victim. Again, if one compares that with clause 3 of the Bill, most of it is there. There are, of course, differences. But these are differences of detail, not really differences in principle. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment (3). To make the burden of proof a balance of probabilities. It is in the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment (4). To confer on the court broad powers, to include additional orders in the Protection Order. It is there as well. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment (5). To provide penalties for contravention of Protection or Expedited Order. At present, in the Women's Charter there are no penalties for contravention of the Protection Orders. I think you will find this also in Dr Soin's Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment (6). To allow applications to be made by a child or an incapacitated adult. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment (7). To attach power of arrest. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So really the controversy seems to boil down to Part III of the Bill, which is the question of police intervention. I have listened to the Minister for Home Affairs and I think what he says has very much substance. The Police are really not equipped to do this. But that does not mean, with respect, that we should throw out the Family Violence Bill. It would be ironic indeed if after all these debates and after accepting the general principle, that the law does need to be beefed up, we throw out this Bill and when the Women's Charter amendments come up, basically the same provisions surface again in slightly different form. The Women's Charter itself, if I may borrow a phrase from Lewis Caroll, is a portmanteau. It is an act that has several things in it. If you look at its history, it replaced the Christian Marriage Ordinance, it replaced the Civil Marriage Ordinance, and it has got bits of the Minor Offences Act stuck in it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have called for the expansion of the Women's Charter into a comprehensive family code, a call which I fully support. I fully support the approach that has been suggested time and again in this House that the courts are not the best mechanism, not the best forum for handling \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> family disputes, whether they be violence or whether they be maintenance. If we say no to this Bill, it must be on the understanding that we are not saying no to the principle, that the details will come up again, and that much of the drafting and suggestions here will eventually be incorporated into the Women's Charter. It is very difficult at this time, as Mr Low has pointed out, to actually make a judgement as to which set of proposal is better because we do not know what is going to go into the Women's Charter. But if past practice is any guide, may I urge, like Mr Sinnakaruppan, that the Minister refer the Women's Charter amendments to a Select Committee, and at that point these provisions can again be suggested and debated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, may I say, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not think that the exercise is valueless. In fact, it is very good that Dr Soin has brought this to consciousness and, as the Minister himself has acknowledged, it has provided the impetus for consideration of this problem. If, at the end of the day, it is the feeling of this House that it would be better to deal with the amendments within the context of the Women's Charter, then so be it. But let us keep in mind that it is not the principle we are rejecting. We may quibble about the details but I think we are all agreed that it is necessary that the law should be beefed up. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have indeed reached the end of the day.

Shopkeepers complain of unfair competition. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my Ministry introduced controls to curb the proliferation of trade fairs, the guidelines were widely reported. My Ministry limited the number of fairs to be organised by each CCC or Town Council in each constituency to only one fair per year and that such a fair is to last not more than 16 days. The organiser may extend the duration to 32 days by using the next year's quota. The quota counts from July to June in the following year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The honorable Member for Potong Pasir would recall that Potong Pasir Town Council was given permission to organise a trade fair last year.
