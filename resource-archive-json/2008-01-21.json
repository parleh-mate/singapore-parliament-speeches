Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Inderjit Singh asked about the rationale for recent investments by GIC and Temasek in UBS and Merrill Lynch respectively, and asked whether it is premature to make such investments when the full effects of the sub-prime crisis have yet to be quantified.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me first state that GIC and Temasek make their investment decisions independent of each other, and of the Government.&nbsp; They make these decisions for commercial reasons, based on their own calculations, free of any influence from Government.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GIC has explained the reasons why it made a major investment in UBS, and more recently in Citigroup.&nbsp; Likewise, Temasek has stated why it invested in Merrill Lynch.&nbsp; The US subprime crisis has resulted in several global financial institutions facing large writedowns of their assets, and requiring fresh capital.&nbsp; This has presented opportunities for investors that are liquid, and able to take a long term view. GIC and Temasek were among those approached.&nbsp; They assessed the proposals rigorously. In each instance, GIC and Temasek concluded that these were good, long term investments and valuable additions to their overall portfolios.&nbsp; They considered each of the banks as having a strong business franchise and good long term growth potential, across multiple businesses and multiple locations.&nbsp; Hence, they negotiated<p align=left>Column:12 </p> terms which protected their interests and made financial sense, and entered into the deals.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are large investments.&nbsp; As with all commercial investments, there will be some downside risk.&nbsp; It is up to GIC and Temasek to assess this risk, and decide if it is acceptable.&nbsp; Their responsibility is to accept prudent risks in order to earn good returns on their overall portfolios.&nbsp; It is not the Government's role to comment on or second guess whether it was timely for GIC and Temasek to have made these two investments.&nbsp; It does not judge the performance of GIC and Temasek by their individual deals.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the Government is assured that both GIC and Temasek had thoroughly assessed the risks of each of these investments, and had made hard-headed commercial decisions after careful assessment of the risks and the prospects for returns over the long term.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio)</B> <B>:</B>&nbsp; Sir, in July last year, Temasek invested a few billion dollars into Barclays Bank. &nbsp;I think it was around $3 billion minimum and up to $7 billion, if I remember correctly.&nbsp; From what I understand, these values have now come down to about half of the value of investment.&nbsp; Is the Minister not worried that if GIC and Temasek continue with this kind of multi-billion dollar investment all in one sector - in the banks - this could quickly wipe out a significant portion of our reserves?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:&nbsp;</B> As I have mentioned earlier, it is important for Government to retain a stance of not assessing Temasek and GIC on individual deals.&nbsp; They are institutions which are tasked with earning us a good long term return.&nbsp; They will have to do so by assessing the risks of each transaction as well as the risks of their whole portfolio thoroughly, rigorously and regularly.&nbsp; Each deal will come with its own risks, and the two institutions go about analysing this <p align=left>Column:13 </p>with considerable care.&nbsp; They do not just look at the risks inherent in each deal but also how the risks correlate with the rest of the portfolio because risk-correlations are a very important component of the overall risks of a portfolio.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They go about this thoroughly so as to be able to assure themselves that they will be able to provide Government with good, long-term financial returns.&nbsp; We have to leave this to them - timing, the decision as to whether to invest, and how to protect themselves in each investment as GIC and Temasek have indeed done in each of these large deals&nbsp;- they protected themselves from downside risks to the extent that is possible&nbsp;- and how to manage a diversified portfolio even as they enter into some large deals from time to time.&nbsp; We have to leave it to them to do as they judge best.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B><B>Mr Inderjit Singh</B>:</B> &nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;I understand that we need to let both institutions manage their investments but since both of these institutions report to the Ministry of Finance, should not the Ministry of Finance lay down some broad guidelines without micro-managing both of them?&nbsp; For example, in the case of the Barclays Bank, it was an equity investment and we lost a lot of money.&nbsp; In the case of the investment that GIC made, it was a convertible bond and it looks like a relatively safe investment.&nbsp; While we do not want to micro-manage, the Ministry could perhaps lay down broad guidelines within which they can operate.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B>&nbsp; That is a useful question.&nbsp; Indeed we do have an understanding with both GIC and Temasek as to the Government's overall risk tolerance.&nbsp; In the case of GIC, it is our funds which the GIC is managing as a fund manager.&nbsp; So the Government sets the risk tolerance, for instance, how much risk you are willing to take and how much risk of a downturn or reduction in the value of your total assets that you are <p align=left>Column:14</p>willing to absorb over a certain period of time.&nbsp; In the case of Temasek, we are a shareholder and they own the funds, they set their risk parameters but they do so in the context of an understanding with the Ministry of Finance as to what is an expected return that we should hope to derive over the long term.&nbsp; So this is not a situation where we are completely hands-off, where we do not have our eyes on the ball at all.&nbsp; But we are scrupulous in avoiding comment on or influencing, not just publicly but internally, the individual investment decisions of Temasek and GIC.&nbsp; I think that is the right balance.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Siew Kum Hong (Nominated Member):&nbsp;</B> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to clarify when he mentioned that the Ministry is assured that GIC and Temasek have appropriately evaluated the risks.&nbsp; As I understand it from the papers, the GIC's investment in Citigroup was done in eight days.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister to clarify exactly what due diligence measures were taken by GIC within that very short period of time.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Over a period of time, if we notice that either GIC or Temasek has not been earning the returns they expected and has been making rash decisions repeatedly as evidenced by what happens after the fact, then of course we would want to engage with them in a much closer discussion on their risk management procedures.&nbsp; This has not been the case so far because they have been doing well consistently over the long term and we have no reason to believe that there is anything suspect or wanting in their risk management procedures.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of you may have read Mr Ng Kok Song's interview in the <I>Straits Times</I> <p align=left>Column:15 </p>today.&nbsp; I read it with great interest this morning.&nbsp; It was a translation I suspect, from a Swiss newspaper.&nbsp; He explained this matter of how many days it took, and it may even have been less than eight days from his account.&nbsp; GIC and Temasek are not newcomers in this field.&nbsp; In the case of GIC's transaction, they have been in the financial markets for years.&nbsp; Even for the purpose of their small investments, whether it is in Citibank, UBS or other global financial institutions, they have a team of people who are watching these institutions continuously, studying the financials, doing counter-simulations, interacting with the senior management of the institutions and asking them probing questions.&nbsp; They are not new to Citibank or UBS or to financial institutions.&nbsp; They come in ready.&nbsp; So when a proposition is made to them, they know how to look at opportunities in a timely fashion, knowing also that opportunities have to be taken in a timely fashion.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:RISING COST OF LIVING--><p align=left>Column: 15<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:RISING COST OF LIVING:::18--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The main reasons for the current pressures on the cost of living are the increase in oil and food prices globally.&nbsp; However, CPI inflation has also increased for technical reasons, which do not affect <p align=left>Column:16 </p>most households.&nbsp; As explained by the Minister for Trade and Industry in Parliament in November last year, the CPI reflects the increase in the Annual Values of homes.&nbsp; However, as 95% of Singaporeans own their own homes and do not pay rental, they are not affected by this component of the CPI increase.&nbsp; So this is a technical factor.<br></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another reason for the high CPI inflation figure is the increase in the GST rate from 5% to 7% that took place in July last year.&nbsp; However, this has been more than offset by the assistance package that the Government provided to Singaporeans.&nbsp; Lower income families have received offsets which are several times larger than the increase in their GST payouts.<br></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should also realise that the GST change has caused only a one-off increase in prices, and not a continuing price rise.&nbsp; The CPI inflation figure continues to show the impact of the GST increase, because the CPI inflation figures are computed by comparing prices this month with prices 12 months ago, ie, before July last year when we increased the GST rate.&nbsp; But, in fact, if we compare prices today with prices, say, in September last year, there has been little further increase due to the GST increase.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government is helping lower income Singaporeans through Workfare, through ComCare and Medifund, and also through the many other targeted subsidies in health, education, housing and utilities.&nbsp; As the Prime Minister said in his New Year message, our finances permitting, we should have something more in the FY2008 Budget to help needy and older Singaporeans.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I would like to ask the Minister to give us details about how much GST credits have the three-roomers and those in smaller flats enjoyed in order to help them offset the GST increase.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister, when we have the Budget, whether he would review some of the criteria for social assistance to be provided because, in most cases, these are drawn at a certain income criterion that may be already outdated.&nbsp; Could the Ministry of Finance also look into that and make appropriate recommendations?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B><B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</B>:&nbsp;</B> Sir, I would like to thank Mdm Halimah for her questions.&nbsp; On the first question of how much assistance has been provided to needy Singaporeans living in three-room flats and below, if we take the GST offset package alone which was introduced in last year's Budget but disbursed at various points over FY2007, a typical three-room household would receive in this current fiscal year about $1,050, which is several times larger than the increase in expenditure that they would have incurred as a result of the GST increase.&nbsp; So it goes well beyond compensating for the GST increase.&nbsp; It involves cash credits in the form of the GST credits and the Senior Citizens' Bonus.&nbsp; It includes utilities discounts and it includes what we did in a range of other sectors to provide support for needy Singaporeans.&nbsp; It is quite a substantial package of support.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On top of that, of course, we continue to provide our health subsidies, Medifund for the very poor as well as our other health subsidies, education subsidies - financial assistance schemes in education last year were substantially increased by widening the criteria so that more families can benefit - and various other subsidy programmes.&nbsp; These are on-going and this<p align=left>Column:18</p> will continue to be our strategy.&nbsp; We will continue on a targeted and efficient basis to help needy Singaporeans.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:ASEAN SUMMIT--><p align=left>Column: 18<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:ASEAN SUMMIT:::21--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Singapore itself has already deposited its Instrument of Ratification on 7th January. In addition, as Chair, we will also work towards putting in place the new mechanisms of ASEAN, including dispute settlement mechanisms and start work on the terms of reference of the proposed ASEAN human rights body.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:19 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, Leaders endorsed a Blueprint on the ASEAN Economic Community.&nbsp; This will help ASEAN realise its goal of an ASEAN Economic Community by 2015 by setting out clear targets and timelines for the implementation of various activities. ASEAN will now begin working on implementing the Blueprint quickly, so that our 10 ASEAN economies can integrate into a single market and production base, capable of competing alongside regional powerhouses like India and China.&nbsp; Similar blueprints will also be established for the other two pillars of community building - the Political-Security and Socio-Cultural pillars.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, Leaders also addressed global issues of concern to the region, namely, \"Energy, Environment, Climate Change and Sustainable Development\" and issued three significant Declarations.&nbsp; In particular, ASEAN has resolved to cooperate more closely on key environmental issues such as combating transboundary environmental pollution and sustainable forest management.&nbsp; In fact, with the global focus on climate change, the Singapore Summit has paved the way for sustained dialogue on this key issue and increased regional cooperation. At the subsequent UNFCCC meetings in Bali last month, for instance, ASEAN agreed to work on an ASEAN Climate Change Initiative, which will strengthen ASEAN's coordination and cooperation in addressing Climate Change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, besides strengthening ASEAN internally, ASEAN also had productive Summit meetings with its Dialogue Partners like China, Japan, Korea, India and the EU.&nbsp; ASEAN celebrated the 10th Anniversary of ASEAN+3 relations by adopting an important Joint Statement and workplan on East Asia Cooperation. We also had good discussions with the EU on how to deepen our cooperation at the special ASEAN-EU Commemorative <p align=left>Column:20 </p>Summit marking 30 years of relations.&nbsp; Finally, the 3rd East Asia Summit was a very substantive meeting, with the Leaders discussing the environment and climate change, as well as agreeing to deepen EAS cooperation in important areas like energy security, economics and natural disaster mitigation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We now look forward to the second half of Singapore's ASEAN Chairmanship, which will culminate with the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting, Post-Ministerial Conferences and the ASEAN Regional Forum that Singapore will host in July.

Prof. Gambari had the cooperation of the Myanmar regime in his recent visits, and made more progress<p align=left>Column:22 </p> than anyone else has managed to achieve in recent years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was with this in mind and after consultations with regional countries that we invited Prof. Gambari to brief the East Asia Summit leaders and to hear their views. The early reactions from Myanmar suggested that we could proceed with the briefing.&nbsp; On 14th November, we were told directly by a very senior Myanmar leader that if the briefing would be of benefit to Myanmar, Myanmar would have no objections to it.&nbsp; On this note, Singapore proceeded to finalise arrangements for Prof. Gambari to brief the East Asia Summit.&nbsp; Prime Minister&nbsp;Lee also spoke to United Nations' Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, who agreed that it would be useful for Prof. Gambari to give the briefing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Myanmar Government, however, raised objections a few days before the ASEAN Summit, by which time it was not possible for us to disinvite Prof. Gambari. Nevertheless, as late as the morning before the ASEAN Summit, the Myanmars agreed to consider a proposal that Prof. Gambari brief the ASEAN leaders instead of the EAS leaders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Myanmar's position was unequivocally laid out only during the informal dinner meeting of ASEAN leaders that same evening, when PM Thein Sein declared that the Myanmar Government regarded the situation in Myanmar as a domestic affair and only Myanmar, not the UN, could brief the EAS or ASEAN leaders, and Prof. Gambari should only report to the UN Security Council.&nbsp; Myanmar wanted to deal with the UN directly and did not want ASEAN to play any political role. Once Myanmar took this position, ASEAN could not proceed.&nbsp; ASEAN works by consensus and we have to respect Myanmar's position, whether we agree with it or not. ASEAN has stepped aside and Myanmar now must, by its own <p align=left>Column:23 </p>choice, face the international community itself.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This does not mean that ASEAN is indifferent to the situation in Myanmar. As Minister George Yeo had explained to Parliament on 22nd October last year, it is in our interest to keep Myanmar as a member of the family as ASEAN has a direct interest in the country. What happens in Myanmar affects the well-being and interests of the rest of Southeast Asia. We do not want to see Myanmar descend into chaos or implode. While Myanmar has decided that it will deal with the UN directly, we will certainly continue to support Prof. Gambari's efforts if he feels that ASEAN can make a contribution.&nbsp; That said, so long as Myanmar insists on dealing with the UN and international community on its own, what ASEAN and any other country can do is obviously limited.&nbsp; Nonetheless, ASEAN stands ready to do what we can when and if Myanmar changes its mind.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is obviously unsatisfactory that Myanmar sees no role for an organisation of which it is a member, and on an issue which affects us all.&nbsp; But this is not a matter of ASEAN's credibility.&nbsp; In the Chairman's Statement, ASEAN made it clear that a return to the <I>status quo ante</I> was not tenable and Myanmar must move forward with or without ASEAN's help.&nbsp; The statement elaborated on what Myanmar should do, including working with the UN so that there will be a meaningful dialogue between the regime and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy. When PM Lee read out the statement, he had the support of all the other ASEAN leaders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Gambari had described his visit to Singapore as having been \"extremely worthwhile\".&nbsp; Singapore facilitated his meeting with a group of ASEAN Foreign Ministers and calls on the Philippine and<p align=left>Column:24 </p> Thai leaders.&nbsp; It should be noted that Prof. Gambari had met the Myanmar Prime Minister in Singapore.&nbsp; Prof. Gambari also had meetings with senior representatives of China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and various EU countries. These exchanges allowed interested countries to hear the UN's perspectives, and conversely Prof. Gambari left Singapore with a better understanding of the perspectives and concerns of key countries. Prof. Gambari had found support for his mission from all those he met.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Gambari is waiting to confirm his next visit to Myanmar.&nbsp; We will continue to support him.&nbsp; It is important that Singapore, ASEAN and the international community continue to give our full support to the Gambari mission as this offers the best hope for progress and a peaceful transition to national reconciliation in Myanmar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the larger scheme of things, the more important issue for ASEAN than Myanmar is our Charter. We should not and will not let the Myanmar issue slow down the integration of our region. The ASEAN Charter and the ASEAN Economic Community are strategic developments that will set the direction for ASEAN to move forward to become a more cohesive, integrated, systematic and rules-based organisation, so that our region can make faster progress. Singapore has ratified the ASEAN Charter and we hope that the other ASEAN countries, including Myanmar, will do so expeditiously.&nbsp; ASEAN should not rule out amending the Charter so that it can come into force under the ASEAN-minus-X principle should some countries be unable to ratify the Charter in time, so that the rest of us are not held back.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, other than the firm words of disapproval,&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what further actions ASEAN is intending to take <p align=left>Column:25 </p>to up the&nbsp;ante of disapproval of Myanmese action, especially if they choose not to respond or respond in a timely manner that they were&nbsp;expected to.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not underestimate the impact of the position ASEAN has taken on Myanmar.&nbsp; The Myanmar Government has taken this into account.&nbsp; As to whether there are further measures that can be done, as you know, ASEAN is a consensus-based organisation, and it can only do what its members are willing to let the organisation do.&nbsp; But as I have said in my reply just now, ASEAN stands ready and willing to work to see how best we can bring a peaceful national reconciliation in Myanmar.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</B>:&nbsp; While Myanmar may assert that its&nbsp;problem is a domestic affair, may I ask the Minister whether he agrees that it is not an entirely domestic issue as it has great bearing on us and its effectiveness as a grouping.&nbsp; In fact, countries like EU, US and some countries like Canada, have indicated that it will affect their relations with ASEAN.&nbsp; Given this situation, can I ask the Minister, from the last ASEAN Summit, does the Minister sense that Myanmar has a sense of responsibility towards ASEAN as a member?&nbsp; And if it does not show any responsibility towards ASEAN as a member, should not ASEAN then take seriously the possibility of taking stronger actions against Myanmar?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat</B>:&nbsp; This is actually somewhat the same question that Mr Sin asked me just now.&nbsp; My reply will be the same, that what ASEAN can do really depends on what its members are willing to allow the organisation to do. &nbsp;As I have said, ASEAN is a consensus-based organisation.&nbsp; On this particular issue, ASEAN has stated its position very clearly on what the next step should be for Myanmar.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh--><p align=left>Column:26 </p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Inderjit Singh</B>:&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister if Myanmar gets expelled from ASEAN, then will the tone of decision-making change?

This is higher than normal, as it has averaged 2.4% per annum during the preceding five-year period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main factors driving the recent increase were: (a) the large increase in oil prices resulting in higher import prices for many medical supplies, (b) the increase in wages of healthcare workers, and (c) the GST increase in July 2007.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Healthcare inflation covers the price changes of a wide range of healthcare components.&nbsp; Not all increased at similar rates.&nbsp; The components which went up<p align=left>Column:27 </p> significantly last year were: (a) the fees in public and private hospitals, (b) the specialist outpatient fees at public institutions, and (c) Chinese herbs and Chinese physicians' treatment fees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prices of these components have actually been fairly stable over the last&nbsp;five years. The only exception was the Traditional Chinese Medicine components which started moving since the second half of 2005 and have moved up by 33% over the last&nbsp;two years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some healthcare inflation is inevitable as we import most medical consumables and the wages of healthcare workers form a big part of healthcare cost.&nbsp; For basic healthcare services in public institutions, we will ensure that they remain affordable to all Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we have fully absorbed the impact of GST increase for subsidised patients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we subsidise patients heavily, at 80% for Class C and 65% for Class B2.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we are reviewing MediShield to increase its payout for large hospital bills but Singaporeans should do their part by subscribing to an appropriate medical insurance plan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, the Government will provide Medisave Top-ups whenever the Budget allows, particularly to the elderly and those with low income.&nbsp; In addition, the recent payment of the Workfare Income Supplement scheme will directly increase the Medisave Accounts of many low-income workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, we push our hospitals to reduce cost and cut out wastages wherever possible, and publish their bill sizes so that patients can make appropriate<p align=left>Column:28 </p> choices of which hospital or clinic to seek services from.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the best approach to cope with rising healthcare cost is ultimately for all to stay healthy.&nbsp; We will get more Singaporeans to adopt a healthy lifestyle and help those with chronic diseases to manage them well so as to avoid future complications of their conditions.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong (Tanjong Pagar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I would like to ask the Minister:&nbsp;given the inflation rate of 6.2%, will his Ministry be prepared to consider increasing the percentage of subsidy?&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister&nbsp;whether there is any room to consider asking the Singapore Medical Association (SMA) to reinstate the guidelines on medical fees, so that&nbsp;consumers will have a wider choice to consider.&nbsp; If&nbsp;there is indeed room for SMA to reinstate the guidelines, will the Minister support the SMA's initiative in this reinstatement?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</B>:&nbsp; Our healthcare subsidy for Class C, Class B2 and, in fact, also Class B1 is something that has evolved over many years, and is quite appropriate for the income level that the subsidy was targeting at.&nbsp; Members know that I am making some refinements&nbsp;to this scheme by introducing means testing, so that we can further target it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the headline subsidy levels, I think it is unwise to vary them.&nbsp; In practice, for those who are really in need of help despite the heavy 80% subsidy, there are other ways of assisting these patients, and Medifund is one of those schemes.&nbsp; In fact, for those who apply to Medifund, because they are distressed by the 80% subsidy, often the bills are just written off, in which case the subsidy is actually 100%.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column:29</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for SMA, the fee guidelines have been around for a long time.&nbsp; After the Competition Act was enacted, SMA sought legal advice.&nbsp; The legal advice, I understand, that was given to SMA was that the SMA directed fee schedule may be construed as anti-competitive.&nbsp; That was the reason which led to SMA withdrawing the fee schedule.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me use this opportunity to explain that the SMA's schedule was just a guideline.&nbsp; It was not enforceable.&nbsp; It did not mean that everybody would follow the fees prescribed.&nbsp; In fact, for a long time, many doctors and specialists, if their patients are willing to pay, go beyond the fee schedule.&nbsp; So the fee schedule was more a reference.&nbsp; Whether it is reintroduced or if it is kept, really makes very little difference.&nbsp; It does serve a certain purpose.&nbsp; It does provide the public to have some sense that the likelihood of a clinic consultation would follow this range of prices.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To me, a more important point is not the fee schedule.&nbsp; And that is why when I published the hospital bill sizes, I actually wanted to educate the people to move away from the fee schedule.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I may give an example, it is like going to a restaurant.&nbsp; We can look at the menu and see different items with different prices.&nbsp; But what finally counts to a diner or to a patient is what is the final bill.&nbsp; That final bill depends on what we order.&nbsp; If we order very expensive abalone, the bill is likely to be high.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, in the case of hospitals, what finally counts is the total bill which the patient has to pay, and that will determine whether it is affordable or not.&nbsp; And that is the reason why I collected all those data, averaged out the statistics and published them by treatment and disease conditions, whether it is delivery, lasik, by-pass or something else.&nbsp; That allows for a better and more meaningful <p align=left>Column:30 </p>comparison of charges between hospitals and clinics.&nbsp; I hope that will help guide our patients.&nbsp; If a doctor says that you need a by-pass, and you can check into our website and you can see a wide range of by-pass bill sizes.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that, in practice, it is more likely than not that the patient will not check, but the general practitioners (GPs) may check.&nbsp; You may go to a GP with some problems.&nbsp; The GP will be better able to interpret this data.&nbsp; I hope that they will be able to better advise their patients which clinic to consult and which doctor to go to.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this will be particularly useful especially when we improve this publication to also include qualitative data like complication rate, mortality rate, morbidity rate, and so on.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

As medical costs increase in tandem with enhancements in standard, the cost burden on all patients, rich or poor, will similarly grow.&nbsp; But we ensure that healthcare services remain highly affordable to the low-income group, through heavy direct subsidies from the Government.&nbsp;

<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</B>:&nbsp; Sir, on means testing, how much additional revenue we will collect?&nbsp; It really depends on the details which are still being finalised and the eventual impact on the ground.&nbsp; As I said, it is not a scheme for the present.&nbsp; The problem is not really big, meaning that large numbers of high income or upper middle income groups are using Class C.&nbsp; Some do, but not in big numbers.&nbsp; And if they are not big numbers, the impact in terms of additional revenue collected by Government will not be huge.&nbsp; But whatever it is, whatever additional revenue collected will be ploughed back to Ministry of Health to subsidise more patients.&nbsp; So, the end result is year by year, with or without means testing, we will be spending more money to subsidise the low-income group.&nbsp; The additional incremental revenue that means testing will yield will just give me additional money to help the low-income group, which is really the purpose of this exercise.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the yardstick to determine whether means testing is successful or not?&nbsp; Let us go back to the objective.&nbsp; Our objective is to be able to continue to improve services in Class C and Class B2.&nbsp; If we are able to do so, then I will call that success.&nbsp; You just need to look at, say, Class C or B2 ward today, and 10 years ago and 20 years ago.&nbsp; The other day there was a public event where Mdm Halimah talked about her experience in KK Class C ward in 1981.&nbsp; She described it pretty graphically, and her conclusion is that it is a world apart, between then and<p align=left>Column:34 </p> now.&nbsp; And I hope, going forward, 10 years from now, the Class C of the future will again be better than the Class C of today.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we narrow the differences between Class C and Class B2, Class B2 and Class B1, and if I do not have this filter, I think, more likely, I will begin to attract more and more who can actually well afford Class A or Class B1 to come and save a lot of money in Class C.&nbsp; Because the difference between Class B2 and Class C is four times.&nbsp; And when we narrow the differences, and without means testing in place, more will be drawn into Class C when they could well afford Class B2.&nbsp; The alternative is I do not improve on Class C.&nbsp; Then, of course, this change will not come about, in which case, I also do not need to have means testing.&nbsp; But I genuinely want to up the standard of Class C and Class B2 so that, in tandem with economic growth, we can pass on some of the benefits to the lower-income group in Singapore.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:AFFORDABILITY OF PUBLIC HOUSING AND DESIGN, BUILD AND SELL SCHEME--><p align=left>Column: 34<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:AFFORDABILITY OF PUBLIC HOUSING AND DESIGN, BUILD AND SELL SCHEME:::40--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I would like to assure him and all Members of this House that the Government remains committed to providing affordable and quality public housing.&nbsp; That is why we continue to heavily subsidise our HDB flats, to the tune of hundreds of million dollars a year.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now explain why we have introduced a new housing option known as Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS).&nbsp; Our public housing programme is an extremely generous one.&nbsp; It covers about 80% of our population.&nbsp;&nbsp; It caters to a wide spectrum of families, ranging from lower-income families with household incomes of about&nbsp;$1,000 to $2,000 a month, as at one end of the spectrum, to the&nbsp;higher end of the spectrum where households&nbsp;are earning up to $8,000 a month. They are also eligible for public housing.&nbsp; So, there is a need to have&nbsp;a wide range of housing options to meet the varying needs and aspirations of these different households, if our public housing&nbsp;is to remain relevant and attractive.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB has in recent years introduced new 2-room and 3-room flats.&nbsp; These are&nbsp;<p align=left>Column:36</p>targeted at households with income of less than $3,000 a month.&nbsp; It continues to build 4-room and 5-room flats to cater to the middle and higher income households earning up to $8,000 a month.&nbsp; There is also a sizeable stock of Executive flats in the resale market.&nbsp; As Members know, HDB no long builds new Executive flats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DBSS flats, which were piloted in 2005, are intended to complement the existing range of flat types that are offered by HDB - the 2-room, 3-room, 4-room, 5-room and Executive flats.&nbsp; They cater to those flat buyers who are looking for something different, in terms of features and design, and yet are still affordable to those within the income ceiling of $8,000.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why we have invited private developers to take on DBSS housing projects, with the understanding that these flats can only be sold according to HDB rules, in other words, income ceiling, family nucleus, ethnic quotas, minimum occupation period, and so on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Private developers have tendered for the land on this understanding.&nbsp; They are free to decide on the level of finishes and frills they provide.&nbsp; They are also free to set the price of the flats, bearing in mind the restrictions on the type of buyers they can sell to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, I wish to assure Dr Ong that HDB is not shifting its mission.&nbsp; Neither is it abandoning its role of directly providing the standard HDB flats &ndash; the 2-, 3-, 4- and 5- room flats.&nbsp; DBSS flats constitute a small part of the total supply of flats catering to HDB buyers, and will remain so.&nbsp; It serves to fulfil the needs of a niche segment of the HDB market &ndash; those with higher aspirations and who can afford a higher price.&nbsp; HDB will monitor the market response to this new scheme.&nbsp; We will put up selected plots of land for<p align=left>Column:37 </p> sale for DBSS flats only if there continues to be a demand for such flats.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turn to Ms Olsen's question.&nbsp; Ms Olsen asked if HDB can consider raising the income ceiling of new DBSS flats beyond the current level of $8,000.&nbsp; Should DBSS flats cater to those who are&nbsp;earning more than $8,000 per month?&nbsp; At this point in time, my answer would be no.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Ms Olsen's concern is with affordability, raising the income ceiling may, in fact, have the opposite effect.&nbsp; Those earning above $8,000 a month may also join the queue to buy DBSS flats.&nbsp; As a result of the stronger demand, DBSS flats may be priced higher, instead of becoming more affordable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, let me assure Ms Olsen that as DBSS is a new scheme - the flats were only sold in 2006, and this is the second project that is being sold - HDB will continue to monitor its implementation closely and we will refine the scheme in future, if necessary.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to Dr Muhammad Faishal's question on the affordability of public housing.&nbsp; As I reiterated at the beginning of my reply, the Government remains committed to providing affordable public housing to Singaporean families.&nbsp; This is achieved through the disbursement of significant public housing subsidies to eligible first-timer households, either directly by way of the CPF Housing Grant for resale flats or indirectly through a market subsidy for new HDB flats.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On top of this, the Government&nbsp;provides more help to the lower income first-timers through the Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) scheme.&nbsp; Last year, we raised the income ceiling for the AHG from $3,000 to $4,000, and increased the quantum for the various income tiers by $10,000.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;now, the highest tier is&nbsp;at $30,000.&nbsp; This is over and above the CPF Housing Grant Scheme.&nbsp; Since the <p align=left>Column:38 </p>scheme was introduced in March 2006, more than 4,600 households have benefited from the AHG.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of the housing grants as well as market subsidies, HDB flats have remained affordable.&nbsp; I say this because&nbsp;HDB records show that recent buyers of new HDB flats typically use about 20% of their monthly household income to service their housing loans.&nbsp; This is significantly lower than the 40% debt servicing ratio which is generally used&nbsp;to gauge affordability.&nbsp; Furthermore, by restricting the debt servicing ratio to 20%, what this means is that&nbsp;families can service their housing loan entirely from their CPF Ordinary Account contribution, without any cash outlay.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I recognise that there has been much anxiety of late among flat buyers about rising HDB resale flat prices.&nbsp; Let me assure Members that HDB is closely monitoring the situation.&nbsp; Although resale flat prices are rising, they are still generally affordable to buyers in the HDB mass market.&nbsp; Those who find resale flats too expensive or cannot afford to pay the Cash Over Valuation (COV) should seriously consider postponing their purchase or applying for a new HDB flat instead.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to take this opportunity to remind flat buyers to be realistic in their expectation and prudent in their decision to buy a HDB flat.&nbsp; For many Singaporeans, buying a property or, indeed, a&nbsp;HDB flat,&nbsp;is the single most significant investment they make in their lives.&nbsp; It is wise to be careful and patient.&nbsp; The property market in Singapore is currently experiencing an upswing.&nbsp; So, it is inevitable that the prices of HDB flats will similarly go up.&nbsp; However, as we all know, the property market goes through cycles and prices do go up and&nbsp;go&nbsp;down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the purchase of a flat is a long-term financial commitment, I would advise<p align=left>Column:39 </p> buyers against overstretching themselves financially - work out your sums carefully and buy a flat within your means, even if it means having to start off with something more modest in size or less than ideal in location.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, when the income ceiling of $8,000 was carefully thought through and set by HDB, it was based on HDB's built flats in mind and there was no DBSS and there were no DBSS prices. I would like to ask the Minister: should&nbsp;the increase in income ceiling not commensurate with the increase in prices?&nbsp; In the event of a downturn in the economy, these home buyers may not be able to afford their mortgage payments, and this is supposed to be public housing and not private housing where the Government does not insulate&nbsp;them from housing market fluctuations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second question is: does this change how we view public housing?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:&nbsp;</B> Sir, on the first question, as I said, the DBSS flats are still targeted at the HDB flat buyers.&nbsp; And that is the reason why we set the income ceiling at $8,000.&nbsp; If we wanted to target a group which is outside the HDB flat buyer group, then, obviously, Ms Olsen's question would be relevant.&nbsp; In other words, let us raise the ceiling.&nbsp; Indeed, this is what we have done.&nbsp; If she recalls, we have a class of housing known as Executive Condominium (EC).&nbsp; The income ceiling for Executive Condominiums is $10,000.&nbsp; So, when we&nbsp;release land for Executive Condominiums,&nbsp;they will&nbsp;be tendered and bid by developers who will buy these lands and&nbsp;build the flats according to the income ceiling of $10,000.&nbsp; In other words, they will take a look at the different target market and <p align=left>Column:40 </p>they will build accordingly.&nbsp; But for&nbsp; DBSS,&nbsp;the reason that&nbsp;we have set the income ceiling of $8,000 is because&nbsp;we want to let the developer know that he is only able to sell to a buyer who satisfies that income criterion.&nbsp; So, he has to bid for the land, bearing that in mind.&nbsp; He has to build, bearing that in mind.&nbsp; And, lastly, he has to set a price, bearing that in mind.&nbsp; This is what we call Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS).</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The D&amp;B Scheme flats were&nbsp;of a slightly higher quality than the normal flat.&nbsp; So you see in Pasir Ris,&nbsp;and in Tampines and in some&nbsp;other newer towns, the&nbsp;Design and Build flats built to a slightly higher standard, but the price is still set by HDB.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, we are&nbsp;moving one step beyond the D&amp;B, and we have&nbsp;an additional element which is the sell part.&nbsp; It is an attempt to let the HDB flat buyer have a wider range, more options, and it is also in&nbsp;a way an attempt&nbsp;to get the private sector&nbsp;involved in the HDB market.&nbsp; But the bottomline is that DBSS flats will always remain a small part of the total supply of HDB flats, and that is the best assurance that I would like to give as far as those who do not want the frills are concerned.&nbsp; If they still want a basic three-room, four-room or even a five-room flat, those flats will still be available in the market.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:STREET HAWKERS AT SUNGEI ROAD VICINITY--><p align=left>Column: 40<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:STREET HAWKERS AT SUNGEI ROAD VICINITY:::43--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The National Environment Agency (NEA), Singapore Police Force (SPF) and Land Transport Authority (LTA) have been working closely to regulate the activities of the secondhand goods street vendors at the Sungei Road area.&nbsp; This is to ensure that the place is kept clean and activities are carried out in an orderly manner.&nbsp; The activities of the street vendors are confined to Pitt Street, Larut Road and Pasar Lane where they are allowed to display their secondhand goods for sale.&nbsp; Operating hours are also restricted to 1.00 pm to 7.00 pm daily when the roads are closed to traffic.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Environment Agency&nbsp;conducts regular checks at the site and will continue with strict enforcement against vendors who operate illegally outside the permitted areas and hours of operation, including seizing the goods of such vendors where necessary.&nbsp; In 2007, the NEA had enforced against 29 illegal vendors at the Sungei Road area, mostly for operating outside the permitted areas.&nbsp; The Police and LTA officers also patrol the site to enforce law and order and traffic regulations respectively.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are currently many privately operated flea markets, such as the ones that are held every weekend at Far East Square and China Square.&nbsp; The Government has no plan to set up a flea market at Sungei Road or elsewhere, as this is a commercial venture best undertaken by the private sector.&nbsp;

As&nbsp;I have noted earlier, the&nbsp;vendors are only allowed to hawk their secondhand goods&nbsp;within the permitted area.&nbsp; We have NEA officers who patrol the area on a daily basis to enforce against any illegal hawking outside the designated area or outside the operating hours as well as foreigners who are not allowed to hawk their goods.&nbsp; In addition, we have also, since October last year, actually put AETOS officers on-site to patrol the site and to monitor and regulate the activities around that area to ensure that the activities&nbsp;are carried out in a disciplined manner.&nbsp; Additionally, the Singapore Police Force also patrols the area to ensure that there is law and order, that there are no theft crimes as well as stolen goods being sold in that area.&nbsp; And LTA actually imposes traffic regulations to ensure that there is no traffic obstruction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards additional measures, actually the agencies are also looking into<p align=left>Column:43 </p> this.&nbsp; They are studying additional measures that can be put in place to improve the area and to minimise the disamenities to the public.&nbsp; So, for instance, there could be signs that we put up to list clearly the operating conditions for the sale activity within the permitted area as well as to expediently remove any abandoned goods left behind after the day's activities as well as&nbsp;abutting the fence, and so on, that SLA has put up.&nbsp; I think this would improve the situation in that area.&nbsp; We are also planning to actually talk to the grassroots organisations within that area, including the Member herself, to update them on the actions that have been taken.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Climate change has grown in importance and complexity as a global political issue.&nbsp; It is an issue with many dimensions that cut across the responsibilities of several Ministries. In this regard, the Prime Minister has asked me to coordinate the efforts of the various Ministries involved. Because we need to take a holistic approach and ensure better coordination within the Government so that we can take a principled and forward looking stance as a responsible member of the global community, while preserving our core national interests. We have set up an inter-Ministerial committee, which I chair, that involves my colleagues, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister for Trade and Industry, Minister&nbsp;MEWR as well as Minister for National Development (and where appropriate, Minister for Finance) and also senior officials from those Ministries.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meeting in Bali in December 2007 was an important signal of political commitment.&nbsp; All countries now recognise that climate change is a serious challenge that needs to be tackled on a collective basis.&nbsp; But the Bali meeting is only the beginning of a long process of negotiations on the kind of international regime that will kick in after 2012. An ambitious two-year timeframe has been set for the Bali Roadmap. It does not specify the concrete actions to take, only that developed nations will take on \"measurable, reportable and verifiable nationally appropriate mitigation commitments or actions\" and for developing countries \"nationally appropriate mitigation actions\".</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once discussions start, it will not be easy. We can expect the negotiations to be rather protracted and complex because<p align=left>Column:47 </p> of the&nbsp;large number of countries involved as well as&nbsp;the diversity of interests. A potential thorny issue will be how to share the burden between developed and developing countries. &nbsp;The Kyoto Protocol established the principle of \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" to address the problem, but while it binds Annex I countries, mainly developed countries, to reducing greenhouse gases, the non-Annex I countries, mainly developing countries, eg, China, India and Brazil, have no emission reduction targets. Furthermore, the United States has not ratified the Protocol.

ASEAN leaders at the Singapore Summit also agreed to encourage efforts to develop an ASEAN Climate Change Initiative. &nbsp;Such an initiative will seek to strengthen the region's capacity, both in mitigation and adaptation efforts, through the sharing of information on impacts of climate change and clean/energy-efficient technologies.&nbsp; It will also call for greater cooperation in the region by increasing networking among members and coordination of efforts with regard to vulnerability, adaptation response as well as&nbsp;forestry issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning to the last part of the Member's question, while Singapore plays its part in the international community, ultimately, I believe all of us, including the private sector and NGOs, have to play a part in climate change.&nbsp; For example, the private sector can play a role to ensure that they run energy-efficient operations and facilities, as well as reflect opportunities to improve Singapore's energy efficiency or to use renewable energy to the Government.&nbsp; NGOs, on their part, can help to raise awareness on the practical efforts people can take.&nbsp; NGOs also have an important role to promote forest conservation, reforestation and the sustainable use of resources to protect the world's carbon sinks.&nbsp; In order to understand the various points of view in creating Singapore's climate change policy, we have formed a National Climate <p align=left>Column:50 </p>Change Committee that comprises stakeholders from the private sector, NGOs and academia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that the Member is a participant in this National Climate Change Committee and I thank him for his contributions in that regard.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SINGAPORE ROWERS AND NATIONAL ATHLETES--><p align=left>Column: 50<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:SINGAPORE ROWERS AND NATIONAL ATHLETES:::54--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I would like to take Mrs Jessie Phua's and Dr Lim Wee Kiak's questions together as they both relate to the same issues.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><p align=left>Column:51</p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker</B>: Yes.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Ser Luck--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Teo Ser Luck</B>: The sports fraternity suffered a great loss in the recent Dragon Boat incident in Cambodia.&nbsp; Let me now address the specific issues raised by Dr Lim and Mrs Phua.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, insurance coverage for our athletes.&nbsp; Currently, all national athletes who are \"carded\", ie, they are recognised to have the potential to excel at the Major Games, would be insured under the Singapore Sports Council (SSC)'s Sports Excellence Medical Insurance Coverage (spexMEDIC) scheme.&nbsp; The SSC has been in discussions with the National Sports Associations (NSAs) to extend this insurance scheme to the non-carded athletes as well.&nbsp; SSC encourages the NSAs to take up their own insurance for the athletes to supplement what is covered by this medical scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second issue raised by Dr Lim is whether we should make it compulsory for all rowers to have basic competency in swimming.&nbsp; The Singapore Dragon Boat Association currently has safety guidelines for its sports, whether for social or competitive rowing, training as well as organising of events.&nbsp; These guidelines include making it mandatory for all competitive rowers to be able to swim at least 50 metres.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lim has also asked whether my Ministry would mandate that NSAs avoid participating in events where international safety standards are not complied with.&nbsp; Our NSAs are affiliated with their respective International Sports Federations.&nbsp; So, when we participate in international events, it is subject to the rules and regulations of these international federations.&nbsp; Consequently, our NSAs would have to comply with these safety standards.&nbsp; As these standards can be fairly technical and sport-specific, it is not possible for MCYS and SSC to have the domain knowledge to prescribe to the<p align=left>Column:52 </p> NSAs as to which competitions to stay away from.&nbsp; Instead, the NSAs, coaches and athletes must be equipped with safety awareness and risk management capabilities so that they can better assess and respond to local competition conditions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we cope with the loss of five outstanding sportsmen in this dragon boat incident in Cambodia, we have a responsibility to establish the facts of the incident and ensure that the necessary steps are taken care of.&nbsp; The Singapore Dragon Boat Association (SDBA) will enforce the use of life vests in all future competitions.&nbsp; Also, the Singapore Sports Council has formed a Panel of Inquiry in December 2007 to review the incident and make the necessary recommendations on the safety measures that should be in place for athletes participating in future competitions overseas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Panel of Inquiry aims to complete its work within two months.&nbsp; It would complement the work undertaken by the Sports Safety Committee chaired earlier by Dr Benedict Tan, which released its report in September last year.&nbsp; The objective is to enhance our sports safety framework and procedures not just for the rowers, but for all sports and for all Singaporean athletes participating in local and overseas competitions.&nbsp; We will announce any policy changes by the first quarter of 2008.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his reply.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All sports have their inherent risks, but I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary and Members of this House would agree with me that safety is paramount.&nbsp; Safety standards adopted should be uniform, whether the sporting event is conducted locally or overseas.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what kind of risk appraisal system will the Ministry be <p align=left>Column:53 </p>putting in place to ensure that our sportsmen and sportswomen can compete safely in regional and international events in the future.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Ser Luck--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Teo Ser Luck</B>:&nbsp; As I mentioned, the work is still in progress.&nbsp; The scope of work for the panel of inquiry that we have just set up will actually be targeted at two major objectives:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Find out what happened during the accident and why it happened;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Figure out what measures need to be implemented to prevent this incident from happening again.&nbsp; And it is not just for dragon boat events but throughout all sports.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But all stakeholders must take responsibility for the safety of their athletes and the teams participating overseas.&nbsp; So NSAs are encouraged to work with SSC to follow all the safety guidelines of all the international federations.&nbsp; They should not adopt double standards.&nbsp; If they adopt strict safety measures in Singapore, we expect the teams or the athletes to adopt similar safety measures when they are overseas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, we have a few plans, and one of them would be the SSC intends to introduce to NSAs a more comprehensive risk-assessment framework, and they will have their training on this framework in the very near term.&nbsp; For the major games, SSC and SNOC will work closely together.&nbsp; The SNOC governs the&nbsp;selection of all the major games, and NSAs are expected to use the SSC's major games management plan, a checklist of items they need to take note of when they participate in an overseas competition.&nbsp; I think all the coaches, athletes, administrators of NSAs and officials must take note that when they participate in an overseas competition, they have a responsibility.&nbsp; They cannot<p align=left>Column:54 </p> try to win at all costs, especially at the expense of the safety of the athletes and the teams.&nbsp; That is what they should take note of, and that applies to all sports,&nbsp;associations and organisers of the competitions.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Jessie Phua (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Given the benefit of&nbsp;scale of economies, would the Singapore Sports Council consider being the main coordinator to negotiate for a comprehensive and attractive insurance package for all NSAs?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Ser Luck--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Teo Ser Luck</B>:&nbsp; I thank&nbsp;Mrs Phua for her questions.&nbsp; The two questions are related.&nbsp; First is that we want the insurance coverage to be a blanket cover when athletes participate in competitions, whether it is locally or overseas.&nbsp; So there is a need for SSC to discuss with NSAs to see what is the best way to actually negotiate with the insurance companies on how to get it covered.&nbsp; This will definitely be part of the risk assessment framework recommendation that&nbsp;the Panel of Inquiry will come up with later on.&nbsp; We need to study further how we can get that&nbsp;extended to all athletes, carded and non-carded, and for local and overseas competitions.&nbsp; We will give the Member an update later when the report is ready.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:GAMBLING AND PROSTITUTION ACTIVITIES IN GEYLANG AREA--><p align=left>Column: 54<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:GAMBLING AND PROSTITUTION ACTIVITIES IN GEYLANG AREA:::56--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, governments throughout the world have tried to eradicate vice but without success.&nbsp; In Singapore, we take a pragmatic approach to tackling vice by confining prostitution to traditional red-light areas.&nbsp; Through sustained enforcement efforts by Police, the vice situation&nbsp;is under control.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, Police conducted some 950 vice-related operations island-wide, up from 890 operations the year before.&nbsp; As a result of these enforcement efforts, some 5,400 foreign prostitutes were arrested, a 25% increase compared to 2006.&nbsp; As many foreign sex workers congregate in Geylang, Police has regularly mounted enforcement operations against vice there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides enforcement, Police has also initiated several vice-control measures.&nbsp; For example, Police started to deploy CCTVs along selected Geylang streets in 2006 to prevent crime, which also had the positive effect of deterring solicitation by sex workers.&nbsp; In addition, Police imposes stringent licensing conditions for entertainment outlets and massage establishments there.&nbsp; MHA and Police also work closely with agencies, such as the Hotel Licensing Board and URA, to regulate the operations and development of budget hotels and lodging houses there.&nbsp; In 2002, Geylang Neighbourhood Police Centre formed a dedicated Task Force to supplement Anti-Vice Branch in tackling vice in the Geylang area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:56 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, illegal gambling in Geylang is not rampant. &nbsp;Police conducts daily operations and high-visibility patrols targeted at public gaming activities in the Geylang backlanes.&nbsp; This resulted in 280 persons being arrested for public-gaming related offences last year.&nbsp; As a result of these operations, Police's assessment is that the situation has improved.&nbsp; Public gaming activities are now significantly less frequent and are&nbsp;smaller in scale.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.00 pm</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Our public housing programme, which houses over 80% of our people, has won us the envy and admiration of many foreign visitors. Beyond just providing a roof over our heads, HDB flats are attractive and affordable. HDB estates are well-planned and constructed to offer our residents a conducive environment to live, work and play in.&nbsp; They help build bonds and community ties. They are where our children grow up, where different races mingle, and where shared memories are formed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One characteristic of our public housing programme is that, even as we build new HDB estates, we do not neglect the older ones. We bring the benefits of newer designs and improvements to these estates through our upgrading programmes so that they can continue to attract new families and maintain their vibrancy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrading also plays an important role in sustaining the value of the HDB flat. The HDB flat has become an integral part of the life story of many Singaporean families.&nbsp; First, we help young families buy their first flat by selling new flats at subsidised prices. If they wish to buy a resale flat, we help them with a housing grant. We provide financing at subsidised interest rate to help them buy their first flat.&nbsp; The lower-income group&nbsp;is given an additional lift through the Additional Housing Grant scheme.&nbsp; When the family is better off and wishes to upgrade to a bigger and&nbsp;better flat, we offer them another subsidy and financing to assist them.&nbsp; At the later stage, when it is time for the resident to retire, we offer options to monetise the flat and unlock its value for old age.&nbsp; Throughout this cycle, we enhance the value of the HDB flat through our upgrading programmes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:58 </p><p><I>New upgrading programmes and Heartware Forum</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the National Day Rally last year, the Prime Minister announced two new upgrading programmes -&nbsp;the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) and the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP). &nbsp;The HIP focuses on improvements within the flat while the NRP focuses on improvements outside of the flat, at the block and precinct levels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The HIP and NRP are the result of residents' feedback on our existing upgrading programmes. Last year, the Forum on HDB Heartware, which I chaired, conducted many public dialogues and discussions to solicit ideas on ways to build more cohesive communities in HDB towns. During these sessions, residents told us that they wanted greater flexibility in flat upgrading and to opt out of certain items if they have recently carried out renovation works. Others have asked for greater consultation and less duplication for block- and precinct-level facilities.&nbsp; The HIP and NRP are the outcome of these feedback. So while improving our estates and upholding their value, our new upgrading programmes also allow greater flexibility in the provision of improvement items, and involve the residents more proactively.&nbsp; The aim is to create homes and neighbourhoods that they can call \"their own\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The HIP and NRP will benefit more flats.&nbsp; Around 300,000 flats will be eligible for the HIP, compared to around 100,000 flats previously eligible for the Main Upgrading Programme (MUP).&nbsp; For NRP, around 200,000 flats will be eligible, compared with the roughly 80,000 previously eligible for the Interim Upgrading Programme Plus (IUP Plus).</p><p><br><p align=left>Column:59 </p><I>Need for&nbsp;legislative amendments</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NRP can be implemented within our existing legislative framework, but the HIP requires legislative changes. The Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill 2007 will amend the Housing and Development Act to allow the HIP to take place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Home Improvement Programme</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow me to recap the HIP for the Members of this House. The HIP addresses common maintenance problems in ageing flats, such as spalling concrete and ceiling leaks.&nbsp; It also offers other useful improvement items within the flat.&nbsp; The improvement items under the HIP can be classified into two categories&nbsp;- Essential Improvements and Optional Improvements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Essential Improvements are items required to comply with the current statutory or technical requirements, mainly for safety and environmental health reasons.&nbsp; These include the repair of spalling concrete, replacement of waste pipes and replacement of pipe sockets (or \"bamboo pole holders\" as we commonly know it).&nbsp; They will be fully funded by the Government and if the residents collectively vote in favour of the upgrading programme; they cannot opt out of Essential Improvements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Optional Improvements are items that are good to have but may not be essential to all residents. They include the replacement of entrance door and grille gate, and toilet upgrading. We have taken the public's suggestions and designed the HIP to allow residents to opt out of individual Optional Improvements items with a corresponding reduction in their co-payments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:60 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Optional Improvements will be highly subsidised, with lessees paying 5% to 12.5% of the cost, depending on their flat type.

This is the purpose of clause 2 of the Housing and Development (Amendment) Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the Act will be amended to allow polling for the HIP to be carried out on a block basis, rather than on a precinct basis, which is the case for the MUP.&nbsp; Clause 3 of the Bill will allow HDB to conduct the HIP poll and proceed with the works if 75% or more of the residents in a block vote in favour of the programme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, to complement the introduction of these upgrading works, clause 4 of the Bill will allow HDB to carry out the flat upgrading works and recover the co-payments that are not funded by Government.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Conclusion</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the HIP will be an integral part of our upgrading programmes to rejuvenate our heartlands. Together with the NRP, the HIP will enable us to tailor the works for HDB estates according to their specific needs.&nbsp; To allow the HIP to proceed, the legislative amendments I outlined above will need to be enacted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)--><p align=left>Column:61</p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.09 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill, as it is&nbsp;timely, given that many of the older flats do require some repairs, especially the toilet. This exercise will give our residents an option to enjoy an upgrade of their flats at subsidised and economy of scale rates and nip in the bud&nbsp;the nagging problem of spalling concrete.&nbsp; The idea is hip, but what is not so hip is in the details of the quantum of co-payment by the residents and the possible contribution by the Town Council.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would&nbsp;say this amendment is like the HDB offering ice-cream to dwellers of older flats. Sadly, the manner of giving is such that not all of them will be able to enjoy the offer. Because of this co-payment, some may just have to watch while others are polishing their ice-cream.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case I want to make for the dwellers of one-room, two-room and three-room flats.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe all Members in this House will know how much damage inflation has inflicted on the pockets of the lower-income group.&nbsp; We hear them during our meet-the-people sessions and at block visits. The list of household items, which have gone up in prices, is growing day-by-day.&nbsp; The lower-income dwellers do not have to wait for a recession to hit them. They are already hit. The <I>Sunday Times</I> ' report on 2nd December 2007 captured the essence of what is happening on the ground.&nbsp; Yes, the media also reported that shopping malls were crowded last&nbsp;December, but I am sure that the buying spree was not by those who live in one- or two-room flats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Take a quick look at 2007:&nbsp; A&amp;E charges and GP clinic charges&nbsp;up.&nbsp; Public transport,&nbsp;school transport charges&nbsp;up.&nbsp; University tuition fees&nbsp;up.&nbsp; Electricity tariffs&nbsp;went&nbsp;up. Food prices&nbsp;up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:62</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about wages?&nbsp; The earnings of many lower-income workers are still below $2,000 a month. The salary boom highlighted in the media applied to the professionals and those in the managerial grades.&nbsp; The high wage growth did not come the way of the general workers,&nbsp;the cleaners,&nbsp;not the sales assistants nor the hawker assistants or chamber maids. Yes,&nbsp;Government has given various schemes and top-ups to cushion the GST.&nbsp; These would have been good if we could tame the fury of inflation, which had snatched away whatever little largesse given out to the masses.&nbsp;&nbsp; This year, we expect inflation to hit 3.5% to 4.5%.&nbsp; A recession is looming in the US, and dark clouds hang on the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Co-payment</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I therefore appeal to the Ministry to create some air pockets for these lower-income residents before they suffer from hypoxia because of rising inflation.&nbsp; What is HDB seeking for each household if they co-pay 5% and 7.5%?&nbsp; HDB may be recovering a few hundred dollars from each of the one- and&nbsp;two-roomers, but&nbsp;for these residents, it is a lot of money. Furthermore, the number of these one- and two-room flats is not large relative to the overall number of HDB flats.&nbsp; In addition, the percentages of subsidies were worked out when the MUP, which is the Main Upgrading Programme, was first introduced some 15 years ago. The percentages have since not been reviewed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I therefore ask&nbsp;the HDB to:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;absorb the co-payment for these smaller units and reduce the percentage for the other larger units;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;lower the co-payment for 4-room flats to 7.5% instead of 10%;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;lower the co-payment for 5-room and Executive flats to 10% instead of 12.5%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:63</p><p><I>Spalling concrete</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I note that there is no mention of the warranty period for spalling concrete and&nbsp;I would like to presume that the present practice of giving six months' warranty is still in practice.&nbsp; I would like to urge that the HDB provides a warranty of five years for spalling concrete as many of our residents have been facing this problem in&nbsp;the flat for&nbsp;so long.&nbsp; Give them the comfort in knowing that they can rest their mind for this period of time.&nbsp; A warranty shorter than this period will not be fair to long-suffering lessees of HDB flats. Even presently, when HDB contractors do the repair of spalling concrete, the spalling and the leak are still not done properly, and repair&nbsp;has to be carried out again and again. Each repair at the toilet is about $200 to the residents and&nbsp;I hear feedback from residents frequently that they sometimes have to pay for another or even a third repair two years after each repair. The present method of repair by HDB is clearly not effective.&nbsp; HDB should urgently look at a better repair method and the use of better materials for such repairs.&nbsp; If HDB and the contractors are able to provide the five-year warranty, the residents are assured of the best method of repair, good quality of material and the best skills for their repair.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the frequent spalling concrete at the toilets, this brings me to my next point, that is,&nbsp;the Optional Improvements of toilet upgrading that HDB is empowered to carry out under the Bill.&nbsp; While the Bill is supposed to offer the residents a choice,&nbsp;in reality, is there a choice?&nbsp; I quote from the HDB website, \"... to opt out of toilet upgrading, the toilets will have to pass a water test for leaks.&nbsp; This is to prevent ceiling leaks at the flat below.\"&nbsp; The reality is that many&nbsp;of these toilets are in bad condition.&nbsp;We get to hear many of these at the meet-<p align=left>Column:64</p>the-people sessions.&nbsp; I have an average of at least five households seeking assistance because of water leakage in toilets every week, whether from the ceiling or from the pipes.&nbsp; HDB is creating a dilemma for these residents.&nbsp; If they fail the water-test for leaks, they are compulsorily required to repair their toilets under the Bill.&nbsp; The job has to be done and they have no money to pay.&nbsp; What next?&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Court summons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB should include such repairs as essential and pay for them.&nbsp; This is especially if the leaks are due to the same reason as the spalling concrete, in that it is due to the inadequacy of the material used, especially during the construction peak in 1986, and this is putting aside what was not properly carried out in the past by the landlord - HDB.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I end on toilet upgrading, please make our upgraded toilets elderly-friendly&nbsp; -&nbsp; no curb at the doorway to the toilet, lever tap, big buttons for switches, side bar next to the toilet bowl.&nbsp; From the photograph shown in HDB's website again&nbsp;- last night, I went to the website to look at some of the photographs - I did not see the bar at the side of the wall, an indication that this elderly feature is not included.&nbsp; I have more to dwell on the need to provide for the elderly later on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, replacement of pipe sockets.&nbsp; I also note that the HDB will be changing the pipe sockets and&nbsp;the bamboo pole holders under HIP.&nbsp; We know that 8.5% of the population is above 65 years old.&nbsp; Many of them are also staying on their own.&nbsp; The weight of the poles with wet clothes is a real challenge for the elderly.&nbsp; This morning, I&nbsp;went to experiment again.&nbsp; I went to weigh the wet clothes on one bamboo of about 1.6 metres&nbsp;- the normal length is about 2 metres.&nbsp; Why I&nbsp;used 1.6 metres is because this was what I&nbsp;did when I was staying in a HDB flat with my mother-in-law who was then 65 years old.&nbsp; I shortened the bamboo poles for her so <p align=left>Column:65</p>that it was lighter for her.&nbsp; I&nbsp;weighed the pole with just one pair of jeans and&nbsp;three&nbsp;T-shirts all wet,&nbsp;it was 4 kilogrammes.&nbsp; It was that heavy and I had not factored in the ring load as well.&nbsp; So I urge those who have not tried to go and do it&nbsp;before carrying out the socket part replacement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We talk about preparing our nation and society for an ageing population.&nbsp; We should then not overlook this problem faced by our flat dwellers.&nbsp; The HDB should look at the design and ask whether it is suitable for our elderly residents.&nbsp; With the space adding item in their flat under MUP, which is now no longer available, HDB is unable to install the elderly-friendly racks for our residents.&nbsp; I sincerely hope that HDB has not forgotten this and is not going back to just repair and replace the pipe sockets.&nbsp; HDB must complement the work of Minister Lim Boon Heng who has, within a short period of time, come&nbsp;up with so many services and programmes for our elderly.&nbsp; We must help the elderly in their basic routine at home.&nbsp; I urge HDB to sincerely look into the provision of elderly-friendly clothes hanging devices for the home.&nbsp; Spare a thought for the elderly and do away with sockets before lives are lost.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Possible contribution by Town Councils</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Next, I would like to question the amendment under clause 4 which amends section 65(d).&nbsp; I will first declare my interest as the Chairman of Aljunied Town Council.&nbsp; What are the upgrading works apart from the current works, such as the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP), which the HDB is looking at recovering not only from residents but also&nbsp;from the Town Councils?&nbsp; The current co-payment is already a heavy burden on the shoulders of the Town Council, and adding any more to its plate would only result in passing on the cost to the residents.&nbsp; As we all know, the Sinking Fund and Routine Maintenance Fund are derived from the contributions of service and <p align=left>Column:66</p>conservancy charges paid by the residents with some grants from the Government.&nbsp; I would like the Minister to undertake a review of the balances of the Funds in the Town Councils.&nbsp; The Fund is depleting because of the hefty contribution from the Town Councils for the Lift Upgrading Programme.&nbsp; If HIP is to be added on, I can surely say that the Town Council may be bankrupted.&nbsp; I seek the Minister's clarification on the improvement contributions in this Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Minister's decision</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the Bill states that the contribution is determined by HDB and not by the Minister directly.&nbsp; I would like to urge that since&nbsp;a Town Council,&nbsp;a statutory board, is under the purview of the Ministry of National Development and, being prudent, such a matter does require the Minister's attention, although we all know that our Ministers work extremely hard and long hours.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point as I just remember this.&nbsp; The works under the HIP are not new.&nbsp; Why only two pilot precincts?&nbsp; Can we start faster?&nbsp; Can we go full force immediately?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.22 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</B> Sir, I rise&nbsp;in support of this amendment Bill which, in principle, is to enable the Housing and Development Board to carry out upgrading works within flats in its housing estates if 75% of flat owners vote in favour of such upgrading works.&nbsp; I would also like to say that my Party, as an Opposition Party, supports the Government's policy of upgrading HDB flats.&nbsp; I make this statement to dispel any notion that the Minister may have that the Opposition does not support the Government's upgrading programmes.&nbsp; That was the reason, I believe, that the Minister gave after the last election when<p align=left>Column:67</p> the Government failed to upgrade Potong Pasir HDB flats after promising to do so.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I note that the list of items included for upgrading under clause 2 of the Bill is all-embracing.&nbsp; It includes items within the flat and also items within a building or any part thereof not comprised in the flat.&nbsp; It is encouraging to know that the HDB shall be upgrading so many items because after 25 years, an HDB flat needs a lot of repair and upgrading.&nbsp; The most troublesome faults occurring within an old HDB flat are spalling concrete, leaking ceilings and corroded sewer pipes.&nbsp; These faults in old HDB flats are very unpleasant and unsightly.&nbsp; As for the spalling concrete, they are menacing and dangerous.&nbsp; These faults that I mentioned are best rectified by HDB upgrading.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before those upgrading works are done, a poll has to be taken and a 75% approval must be sought from flat owners first.&nbsp; It must be noted that the flat owners do not give their approval automatically and vote for the upgrading of the flat.&nbsp; The HDB cannot take flat owners for granted and must look at the sensitivities and interest of flat owners in carrying out the upgrading programmes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Main Upgrading Programmes (MUP) at two precincts were rejected by flat owners&nbsp; - at MacPherson and Pandan Gardens.&nbsp; The MUP at Teck Whye was postponed and then withdrawn after the MUP was scrapped by the HDB.&nbsp; The said two MUPs failed because lessees complained that the upgrading took too long&nbsp; -&nbsp; two years, I believe.&nbsp; And it was too noisy and dusty, and a lot of inconveniences caused.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of the MUP at Marine Terrace, the sub-contractor there went bust and could not continue with the work.&nbsp; The cost of upgrading at that time was also a factor.&nbsp; The inclusion of &nbsp;a<p align=left>Column:68</p> space addition item (SAI) was another problem as well.&nbsp; I believe that the Government was surprised&nbsp;that residents rejected MUP, especially when the Government thinks that the MUPs were done for the benefit of the residents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MUP was halted at about 2004 and subsequent new upgrading programmes have come on stream.&nbsp; Following the MUP, there was the Interim Upgrading Programme (IUP), followed by the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) and the LUP-Plus.&nbsp; Then came the Hawkers Upgrading Programme (HUP) to be carried out by the NEA, after which came the Home Improvement Programme (HIP), then the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP).&nbsp; The last two programmes, namely, the HIP and the NRP, were announced by the Prime Minister at his National Day Rally Speech on 19th August 2007.&nbsp; &nbsp;And not surprisingly, Potong Pasir was not included in the list of HIP, NRP and all the upgrading programmes mentioned above.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I ask the Minister of State what is the reason for Potong Pasir not being included in the abovementioned upgrading programmes, although Potong Pasir is eligible for it?&nbsp; Will Potong Pasir ever be included in the categories of upgrading&nbsp;programmes and, if so, when?&nbsp; It is unfair of the Government to discriminate against Potong Pasir.&nbsp; Potong Pasir for the last 20 years has been completely deprived of any upgrading benefit.&nbsp; Millions of dollars have been spent but Potong Pasir has not benefited even one cent of those funds spent on upgrading&nbsp; public flats.&nbsp; Are Potong Pasir residents not Singapore citizens?&nbsp; Do they not pay income tax?&nbsp; Do their sons not do National Service?&nbsp; The Government should use public funds fairly for the benefit of all constituencies, including the Opposition ones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the fact that Potong Pasir has not benefited at all from HDB upgrading programmes, I still support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.30 pm </p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, the&nbsp;Home Improvement Programme&nbsp;(HIP) is welcomed,&nbsp;much appreciated&nbsp;and, as&nbsp;some said, long overdue.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;much more practicable and it is targeted at areas that matter most to the residents. The slightly&nbsp;higher proportion of&nbsp;Government subsidy, coupled with the lower overall cost&nbsp;outlay, as compared to MUP, certainly makes HIP more affordable and increases its attractiveness.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amending the Act to allow polling for the HIP to be conducted on a block basis, rather than on a precinct basis, is more flexible&nbsp;as well as more manageable in terms of securing consensus among&nbsp;a smaller group of residents. Hence, depending on the condition of each block, residents can better decide on what they need and want for their homes, instead of being bounded by the decisions of&nbsp;residents in other blocks, which may bear no semblance to theirs, even though they are in the same precinct.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allowing residents to opt out of items they do not want is also a more equitable and practical move.&nbsp; The upgrading can then be tailored to meet&nbsp;specific needs and avoid the situation of over-providing.&nbsp; This amendment is certainly an improvement on our current legislation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This HIP is overdue and,&nbsp;in fact, urgent for some flats, as perennial&nbsp;ceiling leakages, seepages&nbsp;and&nbsp;spalling concrete are common problems faced by these residents.&nbsp; I am glad that the Government has identified those flats that were built in the eighties, up to&nbsp;1986, as there were cases of poor workmanship when HDB mounted an ambitious programme to build a large number of&nbsp;flats&nbsp;within a short span of time to meet the housing demand then.&nbsp; It is therefore very gracious and thoughtful of the Government to<p align=left>Column:70</p> acknowledge this and identify these flats as the priority&nbsp;batch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However,&nbsp;it is also not only&nbsp;in flats that were built before 1986 that experience these problems.&nbsp; Even some flats that were built after 1986&nbsp;do have such&nbsp;seepages or&nbsp;ceiling leakages. I have seen fairly recent&nbsp;flats in my precincts where my residents have to contend with this problem. Hence, even as we implement this HIP, I hope that HDB could also look at ways to strengthen the quality control of our new HDB flats and take the contractors to task for any instances of poor workmanship.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the LUP, which the Government targets to complete for all eligible flats by 2014, I hope that the Minister can also set&nbsp;a HIP completion target&nbsp;date for the 200,000 flats&nbsp;that were identified by PM&nbsp;in his National Day Rally speech last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our tropical wet climate can be very harsh on buildings and building materials, even though of good quality, never mind buildings with defects.&nbsp; Residents&nbsp;would appreciate repair works done in anticipation of deterioration, rather than waiting for the problems to worsen and cause all kinds of inconvenience before attempting to fix them. Hence, I hope that the Government&nbsp;would also&nbsp;consider extending HIP for flats built after 1986,&nbsp;if the flats' conditions&nbsp;warrant&nbsp;such improvement&nbsp;works to be done urgently and in totality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the HIP, we have two categories of&nbsp;improvement, namely,&nbsp;the optional improvement items, which the lessee co-pays a small percentage depending on&nbsp;flat size; and essential improvement items, which will be fully funded by the&nbsp;Government.&nbsp; I urge the HDB to&nbsp;be more generous in its classification of the essential improvement items and to include items, such as replacement of aluminium window frames, fire safety features, energy conservation items, replacement of air-conditioned&nbsp;unit<p align=left>Column:71</p> supporting frames and accessibility features for the elderly&nbsp;or disabled. These&nbsp;items,&nbsp;if left optional, will&nbsp;probably be opted&nbsp;out by residents as they have to weigh the costs&nbsp;and&nbsp;other choices available.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were also questions as to how HIP will be implemented. For some deserving estates, for example, flats that are in need of both internal improvement works as well as precinct improvement works, would the HDB allow both the HIP and the NRP to be done at the same time?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUP was implemented in the 1990s as part of the asset&nbsp;enhancement policy to increase the value of our homes and, in a way, to share the economic wealth of the country by increasing the value of&nbsp;our assets.&nbsp; Under MUP, flats that are basic and&nbsp;spartan are being transformed through flat, block and precinct upgrading, giving the older flats a fresh look and better ambience.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIP, on the other hand, is more maintenance in nature and hence would have lesser enhancement value to the flat owner. In fact, for some of the improvement works, like ceiling leaks, HDB already has an on-going scheme to co-share some of the repair costs on a goodwill basis. By replacing MUP with HIP, does it signal a change in the Government's policy on asset enhancement for HDB dwellers? Is the high cost of MUP the key reason why the programme has stopped? Or is it&nbsp;simply a case of MUP losing its appeal over time? Could the Government maintain both programmes, that is, to have&nbsp;HIP to address the wear and tear problems of flats and yet retaining&nbsp;MUP for older flats that still make better sense to do a MUP, including space adding features, and so on?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the reasons cited when the Government implemented the MUP in the nineties was that we want to retain the <p align=left>Column:72</p>vibrancy of our older estates and that we do not want&nbsp;our flats to become \"old folks home\" where the young families shy away. I believe MUP still has its value and usefulness for some selected flats and should be retained. It may cost more to both&nbsp;residents and the Government but, if the budget permits and the residents are in favour, we should still retain&nbsp;it as an option. For example, for some of the older flats where SERS is not a viable option, MUP could be the next best alternative to up the quality of the flat and precinct. I hope the MOS can shed some light on the Ministry's thinking as we make this amendment to the Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow me now to push the envelope a little further. For the HDB dwellers, the Government has a set of very comprehensive upgrading programmes to improve our HDB living environment. LUP, HIP, NRP and SERS are all admirable programmes for our citizens who live in HDB towns. For landed private estates, we have the Estate Upgrading Programme (EUP) to improve the older private estates and enhance their living environment. But for a group of Singaporeans who live in private apartments and condominiums, there are to date no direct programmes that assist them in any improvement works. Some of them are not able to enjoy the attractive HDB offerings, as described by MOS earlier on, because their monthly household incomes are more than $8,000. I hope that MND can also come up with a scheme for these private apartment dwellers,&nbsp;some of whom may be located in or near the heartlands. Never mind if the subsidy is a smaller amount as it is sometimes the thought that counts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government's policy on upgrading has thus far served Singaporeans well and our physical living environments are constantly being improved and upgraded under the various programmes. An HDB survey in 2003 showed that 95% of the households that underwent&nbsp;upgrading were satisfied with the programme. We<p align=left>Column:73</p> have seen with our own eyes how many of the older estates now have a fresh lease of life.&nbsp; However, 15 years into the upgrading programme, it might be timely to also review if our upgrading policy has served the social aspect of bringing our residents closer together. Building community ownership and inculcating community spirit should form part of the objectives of our&nbsp;upgrading programme. The upgrading exercise, which involves significant resident participation, is an excellent opportunity to build stronger neighbourliness among residents and a stronger sense of identity and ownership. There should be sufficient avenues for resident participation and the process more closely blended with the grassroots organisations. I believe we can do more to extract more social capital out of our upgrading programme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the amendments to the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Indeed, I think the HIP programme is a very much welcomed programme&nbsp;for the residents and for all Singaporeans who own HDB&nbsp;flats.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:74 </p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chiam See Tong has very kindly given us a history of how the upgrading programme had evolved over the years, starting from MUP in the 1990s and moving on to LUP, IUP-Plus, and so on.&nbsp; Those are very helpful.&nbsp; It is important for us to remember that the upgrading programme has been evolving because HDB has been taking into consideration the feedback as well as the needs of the residents, together with the specific demands of the flat type, in designing the upgrading programme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Mdm Cynthia Phua have&nbsp;spoken extensively about the scope of HIP.&nbsp; Mr Liang Eng Hwa, for example, has asked for a certain flat type built before 1989 to be included in this programme.&nbsp; So, in other words, instead of the cut-off that we have proposed, he has asked for flats that do not fall into this timeframe to be included as well.&nbsp; He has also asked for more optional improvement items to be included, similarly with Mdm Cynthia Phua, as well as some optional improvement items to be considered essential improvements so that the lessees of the flats do not have to pay.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Liang Eng Hwa also brought up the issue about whether HIP or other upgrading programmes can be extended to private estates as well.&nbsp; I think it is important at this point in time for us to revisit the important issue here, and the starting point is always what is the objective of HIP.&nbsp; The objective of HIP is really to enhance the value of HDB flats for Singaporeans.&nbsp; I started off by saying that this indeed has been a unique point of Singapore's public housing policy because not only does the Government provide flat ownership for the majority of the people, but this is also a Government that, not only having sold the flats, would come back into the flat to upgrade&nbsp;and repair certain defects in the flat, and in the common facilities, to upgrade the lifts,<p align=left>Column:75 </p> lift landing areas, and so on.&nbsp;So it is indeed a unique feature of the public housing policy of Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it that we can do that?&nbsp; It is because of the economic policies of the PAP Government that allows us to generate the budget surplus that we can share with Singaporeans.&nbsp;We have decided to share this with Singaporeans who are eligible for HDB flats and, therefore, we have confined this to HDB dwellers.&nbsp; So the more we take these limited financial resources to spread it&nbsp;- whether it is to a wider group of flats, to private estate dwellers&nbsp;to include more items, and so on - it just means that we are spreading the benefits across a bigger&nbsp;base and, therefore, the benefits that individual HDB lessees tend to benefit will similarly be reduced.&nbsp; So it is important for us to basically strike this balance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MUP, yes, there were more items in there, like&nbsp;space-adding features.&nbsp; But at that time, we were only looking at flats that were built before 1980.&nbsp; Therefore, flats eligible for MUP, for example,&nbsp;are only about 100,000.&nbsp; Right now, we are extending the eligibility to 1986 and therefore, as a result, 300,000 flats are eligible. The reason why we could do that is because we have made the HIP programme more targeted, focusing on the urgent&nbsp;and essential needs of the flat dwellers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HIP and other upgrading programmes&nbsp;are really not a substitute for the routine maintenance and cyclical repairs that the home owners and town councils will have to undertake.&nbsp; It is not a substitute.&nbsp; While we can look forward to the upgrading programmes to be carried out in the precinct, home owners have to be responsible for the maintenance of its fittings and fixtures within the&nbsp;flat and, similarly, town councils have to be responsible for the routine maintenance<p align=left>Column:76 </p> and cyclical maintenance of the common areas as well.&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua has listed a series of problems that home owners have faced.&nbsp; What I would say is that there must be some responsibilities to make sure that there is regular repair of the&nbsp;flat as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In designing the upgrading programme, I think&nbsp;a main criterion is whether the limited resources that we have can effectively address the common needs that&nbsp;are voiced out by the residents. Since MUP in 1990, as Mr Chiam See Tong has rightly put it, we have been improving the various upgrading schemes.&nbsp; In the HIP, we have made more targeted improvements, for example,&nbsp;spalling concrete, ceiling leakage, which have been highlighted by many residents as the key problem that they face, and therefore we have made that an essential item.&nbsp; We have expanded the eligibility for HIP to more than 300,000 flats.&nbsp; We have actually made&nbsp;co-payment terms more favourable, and Mdm Cynthia Phua has pointed out that these co-payment terms were in fact started many years ago with the MUP programme.&nbsp; That is not true.&nbsp; In fact, if you compare the HIP co-payment term,&nbsp;it is&nbsp;better than the MUP co-payment term.&nbsp; For Members' information, the MUP co-payment term stretches from 10% to 25%, whereas in HIP, it is 5% to 12.5%,&nbsp;and we also allow more flexibility.&nbsp; We have optional improvements for the very reason that if some of the residents feel that they do not have the financial means to have the&nbsp;good-to-have, then they should really opt out of it.&nbsp; There are options for them.&nbsp; As far as co-payments are concerned, we have various financial schemes to help the lessees with the payments, including instalment payments&nbsp;and the use of CPF funds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must clarify to Mdm Cynthia Phua that we have not taken anyone to court over non-payment of upgrading co-payments.&nbsp; That is not something that HDB has experienced and we believe that <p align=left>Column:77 </p>we have put in place sufficient financial assistance for the lessees, to basically look at the very favourable instalments over a prolonged period of time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I would like to clarify that MUP has not been halted, like what Mr Chiam See Tong has said.&nbsp; In fact, we have been carrying out the MUP programme, and there are still several MUP projects that have just been recently polled and are now being implemented.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, on the whole, we believe that HIP is really a scheme that has taken into consideration feedback from&nbsp;the residents and our experiences with the various upgrading programmes that we have implemented in the past.&nbsp; And we think that it is very pointed to address the problems faced by the residents -&nbsp;the requirements of the residents of flat type built in the 1980s.&nbsp; I do agree with Mr Liang Eng Hwa fully that our upgrading programme should really be used as an opportunity to increase the social capital in the housing estate.&nbsp; And&nbsp;it is for that precise reason that we have allowed consultation.&nbsp; In fact, we have allowed NRP to stretch over a couple of precincts and we have allowed pre-consultation process as well as voting by the residents.&nbsp; That is precisely the intention.&nbsp; It is to increase ownership of the project&nbsp;and also an opportunity for the residents to come together to interact when they are talking about their own upgrading in that area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, I would like to address some specific issues that have been brought up by Members.&nbsp; First of all, on clothes drying.&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua may like to know that, besides replacing the bamboo pole holders, we do have other options, such as the drying rack that we can still install outside the flat without a space-adding item.&nbsp; But this has to be basically considered in totality within the budget that has been allocated.&nbsp; So this is something that we have catered to and<p align=left>Column:78</p> we are prepared to extend other methods of clothes drying.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On co-payment of 1-room, 2-room lessees, first of all, most of the 1-room and 2-room flats are rental flats, and the Government is already upgrading these flats with no payments from the lessees for 1-roomers and 2-roomers.&nbsp; There&nbsp;are a very small number of 1-room and 2-room flats that have been purchased and owned.&nbsp; But even that, as I mentioned, the co-payment is 5%, heavily subsidised and, on top of that, we have supported it with financing schemes to basically help lessees meet their payment demands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On elderly-friendly items, we would consider such features to be in the optional improvements.&nbsp; What I would say is that this is the first time that we are coming in with the HIP.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all upgrading programmes, we are prepared to review the items to be included over time.&nbsp; We would definitely allow such features to be included in&nbsp;future if they prove to be popular.&nbsp; In any case, we would allow lessees to make specific requests for the contractor to install such features on top of the HIP, and that is something that they could discuss with the contractor separately as well.&nbsp; If they&nbsp;like to put in certain features that are not included in HIP and they want to do it at the same time so that they are not inconvenienced twice, that is something that we can arrange for the lessees to discuss with the contractor and to come up with an understanding on the work to be done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of sinking fund&nbsp;of the town council, at the moment, HIP, as it is designed at this point in time, does not require co-funding from the town council.&nbsp; But, as I said, if we are revising the scheme in future to include the many more items that Mdm Cynthia Phua and Mr Liang Eng Hwa have suggested,&nbsp;there may be a case where we would require some co-payments from the town council in&nbsp;future.&nbsp; But we will definitely take Mdm <p align=left>Column:79</p>Cynthia Phua's point about adequacy of sinking fund into consideration as we design the revision to the scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue about private estate that Mr Liang Eng Hwa has raised, I would just like to clarify that the upgrading programme is really a means for the Government to share budget surpluses with Singaporeans who are eligible for HDB flats.&nbsp; Private estates have no restrictions over ownership.&nbsp; Many of the owners&nbsp;may be PRs and some of them are even foreigners.&nbsp; So for us to subsidise private estates in that sense, I think, would be hard to justify.&nbsp; And, also, I do not think private estate dwellers should compare themselves with HDB flat dwellers because there are many restrictions placed on the ownership of HDB dwellers as well as some other eligibility issues that HDB lessees would have to face.&nbsp; But in the case of private estates, they are free to rent out their flats.&nbsp; They have other options of upgrading, for example, some of them have chosen to go en bloc as well.&nbsp; So the comparison is really not appropriate.&nbsp; At the moment, I think there is no intention for the Government to extend the upgrading programme into the private estates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, to address Mr Chiam See Tong's point, I would be very glad to hear that Mr Chiam See Tong is supportive of the HIP and upgrading programme.&nbsp; I just like to clarify that Potong Pasir flats will be eligible. &nbsp;Mr Chiam may not be able to find it on the list because when we put up the list, it is&nbsp;according to the estate and&nbsp;not divisional boundaries.&nbsp; So, for example, in my division in Yuhua, you probably cannot find Yuhua on the list, but you are able to find Jurong East.&nbsp; I am glad to report that Potong Pasir would be included under Toa Payoh estate.&nbsp; So Potong Pasir will be eligible but, as we have mentioned many times in this House,<p align=left>Column:80 </p> it is a case of prioritising.&nbsp; We do have limited financial resources that we can apply and,&nbsp;therefore, prioritising is required and it will be according to the support for the Government policies in the prioritisation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.15 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Health (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time\".<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1987, this House, with the recommendations of a parliamentary Select Committee, moved the Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA) after two days of debate.&nbsp; The debate in the House was, in turn, preceded by 12 months of public discussion and consultation, involving many stakeholders, religious bodies, professional groups, doctors and <p align=left>Column:81 </p>patients.&nbsp; The extensive public debate was necessary as we were then breaking new ground over the sensitive and emotional subjects of organ donation, organ transplantation, brain death and the concept of presumed consent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to HOTA, organ donation was done solely through the Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) Act of 1972, or MTERA, which allowed Singaporeans to pledge their organs through an opt-in system.&nbsp; However, globally, the experience with opt-in systems is that they have not been effective in saving many lives through cadaveric organ transplant.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our experience with HOTA provides a good illustration.&nbsp; Prior to HOTA, the number of cadaveric kidney transplantations was only five per year, on average.&nbsp; With the introduction of HOTA, and especially after its amendment in 2004, the rate has gone up 10 times, saving the lives, on average, of 48 kidney patients every year, about one a week.&nbsp; Many other patients with liver or heart failure have also been saved.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many more patients have regained their eyesight through cornea transplants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HOTA saves lives and is an important piece of legislation in our healthcare delivery system.&nbsp; On behalf of the many patients with organ failure, I thank Members for their continuous support of this piece of legislation.&nbsp; Singaporeans, too, support HOTA strongly.&nbsp; HOTA does not take away the freedom of Singaporeans to refuse organ donation for any particular reason.&nbsp; One percent&nbsp;of adult Singaporeans have opted out of HOTA.&nbsp; And we respect their decision.</p><p><br><I>Inclusion of Muslims</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, HOTA has not been able to bring major benefits to the Muslims, as a deliberate decision was made in 1987 to exclude them from HOTA.&nbsp; This was<p align=left>Column:82 </p> because the <I>Fatwa</I> then required the consent of two <I>waris</I> (paternal next-of-kin, according to Islamic hierarchy) for organ donation to proceed.&nbsp; Even so, the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) made it clear that organ donation to save lives was permissible under Muslim law.&nbsp; Muslims who wish to donate their organs can do so by making a pledge under MTERA.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the exclusion, Muslim non-pledgers are accorded a lower priority for organ transplant than non-Muslims who have not opted out of HOTA.&nbsp; In similar spirit, Muslims who have pledged their organs under MTERA generally need to wait two years before they are accorded the same priority as those who have not opted out of HOTA, if they made their pledge after the period prescribed in the Act.&nbsp; However, I&nbsp;should clarify that lower priority does not mean that Muslims have not benefited from HOTA.&nbsp; In fact, this morning I was flipping through <I>Berita Harian</I> and the top story was about one Muslim businessman, I think 42 years old with two kids had his life saved.&nbsp; He had liver failure and there was a cadaveric liver which was available.&nbsp; Tissues matched and his life is now saved and he has benefited from HOTA.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is a rising number of kidney failure patients among the Muslim Malays.&nbsp; New cases of kidney failure among the Malay population rose from 19% in 2000 to 22% in 2006.&nbsp; In Singapore, the primary cause of kidney failure is diabetes mellitus.&nbsp; According to the 2004 National Health Survey, there was a disproportionately higher number of Malays with diabetes mellitus (11%) compared to, for example,&nbsp;the Chinese population (7%).&nbsp; There is, therefore, a greater burden of kidney failure among Malays.&nbsp; This trend is also evident from the racial breakdown of the national waiting list for kidneys.&nbsp; Malays made up 21% of the total number of patients on the 2007 kidney waiting list, even though <p align=left>Column:83 </p>they formed about 13% of the resident population.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004, MUIS, through the Fatwa Committee, made it easier for Muslims to pledge their organs.&nbsp; But this has not resulted in any significant increase in the number of Muslim pledgers, despite intensive publicity by the Muslim Kidney Action Association and the National Kidney Foundation.&nbsp; Since HOTA was enacted in 1987, there have been about 16,000 Muslim pledgers.&nbsp; In 2007, there were less than&nbsp;200 pledgers.&nbsp; To date, these pledges have not yielded any organ donations.&nbsp; And this problem of voluntary pledging not producing enough organs for transplant&nbsp;is&nbsp;not unique to the Muslim community or to Singapore.&nbsp; It is observed all over the world - the US, UK, Spain, Europe.&nbsp; It is all the same.&nbsp; Some of you may have read that right now,&nbsp;the UK is going through a major public consultation,finally thinking seriously about enacting&nbsp;a similar legislation as ours of presumed consent, ie, the opting-out system.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When HOTA was amended in 2004, several Members asked if MUIS could review its position on HOTA to bring the disadvantaged position of the Muslim community up to par with the rest of Singaporeans.&nbsp; I remember SMS Zainul Abidin Rasheed stressing a point that \"The disadvantages of (Muslims) being out of the system are real and the Malay-Muslims as a community cannot afford to let this continue.\"</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2006, MUIS embarked on a series of public education campaigns concerning organ donation and the religious issues surrounding organ donation.&nbsp; While there were some concerns on the practical aspects of transplantation, the Muslim community generally voiced their acceptance of the permissibility of organ donation from a religious perspective, and <p align=left>Column:84 </p>supported the move to increase the number of Muslim donors.&nbsp; In parallel, the Fatwa Committee launched a review of the <I>Fatwa</I> on organ donation.&nbsp; The review eventually led to a new <I>Fatwa</I> being issued in July 2007, making it permissible for Muslims to be covered under HOTA.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new <I>Fatwa</I>, we are now in a position to amend HOTA to include Muslims like the rest of the Singaporeans.&nbsp; This is a significant achievement, both for the Muslim community as well as for Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main objective of this Bill which is now before the House is to bring this about.&nbsp; Technically, the Bill itself is relatively straightforward as it merely removes the current exclusion clauses of HOTA.&nbsp; Accordingly, clauses 2, 3 and 8 of the Bill expand the target population under HOTA to now include Muslims.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the inclusion of Muslims under HOTA, Muslims who do not opt out of HOTA will be accorded the same priority as other Singaporeans who have not opted out of HOTA.&nbsp; Muslims who have already pledged their organs under the Medical (Therapy, Research and Education) Act will also be placed in this group and receive the same priority.&nbsp; This will level the playing field for all Singaporeans who are in need of an organ transplant.<br>&nbsp;<br><I>Enforcement Powers<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also taking this opportunity to amend HOTA, through clauses 4 to 7 of the Bill, to provide my Ministry with the necessary enforcement powers to investigate any offence under HOTA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HOTA includes regulations on living donor organ transplantation to safeguard the well-being of the donor and ensure that he was not under any form of duress or coercion to donate his organs.&nbsp; HOTA also prohibits any trading in organs and blood as it is deemed unethical.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column:85 </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry currently relies on the Police to investigate such offences as we lack the power to do so.&nbsp; The proposed amendment would allow my Ministry to appoint inspectors and provide them with the appropriate investigative powers, which would enable them to look into complaints and conduct investigations in a timely manner.&nbsp; We also need to be able to disclose donor or recipient-related information for the purpose of administering and enforcing HOTA, as well as for the purpose of referring complaints regarding any errant medical practitioner to the Singapore Medical Council for any disciplinary action.</p><p><br><I>Lifting the Whip<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the issues concerning organ removal under the presumed consent framework are ethically and culturally sensitive, I have asked the Whip to be lifted to allow Members to debate and vote on the Bill based on their religious and ethical beliefs.</p><p><br><I>Conclusion<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the implementation of these amendments to HOTA will not fully resolve the problem of organ shortage, it will allow more Muslims to have the same chance as others in obtaining a new lease of life through an organ transplant.&nbsp; My Ministry has estimated that about 30 more patients per year&nbsp;may benefit from the proposed amendments to HOTA.&nbsp; I hope the House will join me in giving them this gift of life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I end, let me say a few words in Malay.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Before HOTA was introduced, we depended on voluntary organ pledging.&nbsp; But we find that such a scheme is not effective.&nbsp; On average, only five cadaveric kidney transplants were done each year before HOTA began.&nbsp; Now, the average rate of kidney transplants has increased by 10 times.&nbsp; So I am happy that the Fatwa Committee of MUIS, after reviewing the issue, has explained that there is nothing wrong under Islamic law to include Muslims under HOTA.&nbsp; With this explanation, we can now amend HOTA to remove the original exclusion of Malays from HOTA.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, we can save more lives, not only those who have kidney failure but also patients with heart or liver failure.&nbsp; I am happy that Muslims have voiced their support for this Bill.&nbsp; Some Malay MPs have helped me to reach out to the Muslims to explain to them this proposed Bill and to get their support.&nbsp; I would like to record my thanks to them.&nbsp; They include the Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed, Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman, Mdm Halimah Yacob, Mr Zainudin Nordin and Dr Fatimah Lateef.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope the House will support this Bill to enable us to save lives.&nbsp;</p></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 183-184.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(<I>In English)</I>:&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>4.29 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill makes a very important and significant change.&nbsp; After 21 years, <p align=left>Column:87 </p>Muslims will now be covered under HOTA.&nbsp; Instead of opting in, like other Singaporeans, we will now be automatically covered unless we decide to opt out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When HOTA was introduced in 1987, because of the situation that existed then, Muslims were excluded from the ambit of the Act.&nbsp; The situation today has changed. &nbsp;Our experience with a voluntary system of opting in has not worked.&nbsp; It is indeed a dismal failure.&nbsp; To date, Muslims make up 21% of the 600 patients in Singapore who are waiting for an organ transplant but account for only 2% of patients who actually receive an organ transplant.&nbsp; Only Muslims who have opted in have the same priority as other Singaporeans who have not opted out of HOTA.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, Muslim kidney patients have a much, much longer waiting time compared to other Singaporeans. Despite the larger percentage of Muslim patients waiting for a kidney, the number of Muslims who have pledged their kidneys is very small&nbsp; -&nbsp;only 16,000 have pledged their kidneys so far. The <I>status quo</I> is therefore untenable and has to change so that more lives could be saved. The change will result in a possible inclusion of 300,000 eligible adult Muslims in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, this is the <I>raison d'etre</I> why Islam allowed organ transplants in the first place. Muslims need not have any doubt or concerns over this issue. Organ transplants&nbsp;are already widely accepted and practised in the Muslim world.&nbsp; In Singapore, MUIS had long ago allowed Muslims to donate their organs. The only issue that remained was whether the support of the <I>waris</I> of the deceased is required before the organ transplant can take place. The <I>Fatwa</I> issued by MUIS last year paved the way for Muslims to be included under HOTA. Under this <I>Fatwa</I>, there is presumed consent on the part of<p align=left>Column:88 </p> the <I>waris</I>. Saving the life of another human being is a philanthropic and unselfish act that is much encouraged by Islam. For those who have serious objections, they could, like other Singaporeans, opt out if they wish to. &nbsp;In the absence of any opting out by the person, then the family should respect the deceased person's wish to donate his organs after death.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the clear <I>Fatwa</I> and the pervasive practice in many Muslim countries, we cannot expect 100% support as there are bound to be some in the community who may continue to harbour some doubts. Hence, it is important that we continue to engage them. However, the response from the Muslim community, based on the feedback received arising from the extensive consultations that the Ministry of Health&nbsp;had with Malay/Muslim grassroots leaders and Malay/Muslim organisations, have been very positive.&nbsp; Malay/Muslim leaders strongly supported the move as they realise that not changing the <I>status quo</I> only means greater hardship and pain for those who are suffering from kidney failure. What is more important is that there is also overwhelming support from the Islamic religious leaders in Singapore.&nbsp;We thank them for their continued support and role in helping us to explain to the Muslim community which has helped to instill greater confidence in HOTA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the feedback received, some had raised doubts over when death is deemed to have taken place. This is also, I think, an issue that was debated at the time when HOTA was introduced way back in 1987.&nbsp; It is internationally accepted by expert medical groups that death occurs when brain death takes place. I would also like to quote from the decision of the Council of Islamic Fiqih Academy of the OIC (Organisation of Islamic Countries) which, in its 44th session in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia in<p align=left>Column:89 </p> 1988, ruled that \"death\" may take two forms: (a) when all functions of the brain come to a complete stop, and no medical cure can reverse the situation; and (b) when the heart and respiration come to a stop and no medical cure can reverse the situation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the accepted legal definition of death as covering a situation where a person is brain dead, the case, which occurred last year involving the late Mr Sim Tee Hua, serves to remind us that despite the presence of HOTA, we need to continue to educate people about HOTA and issues such as when brain death takes place. Also, we have to continue to deal with individual cases at the hospital level very sensitively. It is, therefore, important that hospitals adopt protocols to equip doctors and other healthcare personnel with the appropriate knowledge, skill and sensitivity in dealing with the family members of the deceased, so as to minimise conflict. At the same time, it is equally important that family members respect the wishes of the organ donor who by not opting out clearly wanted his or her organs to be put to good use after death.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the other aspect, which the Bill seeks to cover, is to vest the MOH with enforcement powers. This will enable the MOH to investigate any offence under the Act. This is an important amendment, as organ trading is believed to be on the increase. This prompted the World Health Assembly to urge governments to take measures to protect the poorest and most vulnerable groups from \"transplant tourism\". Organ trading is a scourge and should never be allowed to creep into our system.&nbsp; Seen in this light, the new measures introduced under this law will help to prevent abuses and exploitation of the vulnerable and needy in our society and instill integrity in our system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p align=left>Column:90 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, Sir, I support the Bill but please allow me to say a few words in Malay.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<I>In Malay</I>):&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20080121/20080121VS_111908.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a>*.</I> ]&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the amendments that will be made to include Muslims under the Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA).&nbsp; This is a progressive move and aims to save lives, something that is emphasised in Islam.&nbsp; Around 21% of 600 kidney patients who are waiting to get kidney transplants are Muslims.&nbsp; But only 2% are able to undergo transplant. This is because only someone who has included himself under HOTA will be given the same priority as other Singaporeans.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our efforts to encourage Muslims to include themselves voluntarily under HOTA have no effect at all, because until today, only 16,000 have pledged their kidneys. With this amendment, 300,000 Muslims will be included under HOTA.&nbsp; I applaud the efforts taken, before this amendment was made, to get the opinions and agreement of Muslims. Such efforts allow Muslims to express their feelings, look at other communities' experiences and get explanations on issues that concern them.&nbsp; In the end, there is a consensus that the benefits are much higher if Muslims are included under HOTA, rather than if they continue to be excluded.</p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our efforts to reach out to the community so that they further understand HOTA must be continued.&nbsp; And in this instance, the support of Muslim leaders and religious teachers is important. So far, the explanations given by MUIS, and the support of our religious teachers in providing explanations or assurances to our community, must be appreciated.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding the HOTA amendment, Malay/Muslim bodies and community<p align=left>Column:91 </p> leaders, together with our community, have shown maturity and an open mind that is exemplary, and it shows that we are capable and able to change on issues that are important for the benefit of not only our community, but for the benefit of all Singaporeans.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I support this Amendment Bill.</p></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 185-186.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.39 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill, Sir, is an essential Bill, first introduced in 1987 as a presumed consent law. Over the years, we have seen the need to evolve the Bill accordingly. This Amendment Bill will help finetune our framework for HOTA, making it more robust and compatible with the evolving trends and determinants of organ need and donation&nbsp;rate in Singapore. Currently, our organ donation rate still lags behind countries such as Spain, the United States and the United Kingdom. We still have a long way to go.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pertaining to the enforcement action of the Bill, the facts are clearly outlined for compliance.&nbsp; I support the strong signal it will send out to the public.&nbsp; It definitely has to be so, considering the seriousness of the offence if it does happen.&nbsp; Moreover, this deals with the human organs, ethics and the respect for the human body.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the appointed inspection officers, I hope the Ministry will brief and explain the sensitivity of the circumstances to them when they deal with the issues on the ground.&nbsp; The phrases and the terms as well as the non-verbal communications given out by these officers&nbsp;are very crucial and must not be seen to be offensive to any race, culture or religion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:92 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst errant practitioners will be dealt with appropriately and, when necessary, all records must be shared, I do hope for the assurance that patient confidentiality issues will not be breached unnecessarily by the officers.&nbsp; This will thus make it important for the inspection officers and inspectors to be briefed on the patient-doctor relationship and what information can and cannot be disclosed under different circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the strict enforcements, I am also glad to see that allowances have been made for gender considerations.&nbsp; Part IVB, section 15G states that, \"no women may&nbsp;be searched except in the presence of a woman officer\". These guidelines on the protection of informers as well is also very necessary in addition to this new Amendment Bill. It will provide the reassurance to everyone with relevant information who would like to come forward.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to say a little bit about the consent age. Currently, the lower limit for HOTA is 21 years of age.&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Ministry to review and consider whether it would be necessary to lower this to 18 years of age.&nbsp; I suggest this because our driving and riding cut-off age group is 18 years and most boys are in National Service at 18 years of age where they are legally allowed to make many decisions.&nbsp; Others would probably be in institutions of higher learning or would already have started working by 18.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Ministry if it has been doing any calculations or mathematics to see how many more organs we are likely to get with the lowering of the cut-off age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the amendments for the Muslim community, including them under HOTA means more than just saving lives.&nbsp; It is a significant step forward indeed.&nbsp; It reflects just one of the many achievements and contributions of the community over the years.&nbsp; It also shows the willingness to <p align=left>Column:93 </p>change and adapt accordingly to circumstances with the objective of showing compassion to those in need, regardless of race, language, religion and background.&nbsp; In my opinion, there are two main factors which are essential in making everyone, not just the Muslims, understand and support HOTA even further. The first point is that we must not let up in promoting awareness and understanding. We must never slacken even after the initial hue and cry period is over.&nbsp; Sustained long-term education is indeed the way forward.&nbsp; The second point is that&nbsp;the handling of the situation itself has to be comprehensive and a complete package, which means we have to look into the medical and procedural aspects of organ donation as well as the emotional, social and other related issues on the matter; streamlining the process flow, making it a little easier for the grieving relatives, shortening the timing to the most minimum necessary.&nbsp; Sir, all these will help facilitate HOTA and, of course, we will get the buy-in.&nbsp; It will also instill full confidence amongst Singaporeans on HOTA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to continue to speak in Malay.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Malay)</I>:&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20080121/20080121VS_124558.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a>*.</I> ]&nbsp;Many of the Malay/Muslim community fully support this Bill.&nbsp; This is because lives are saved and patients' suffering is alleviated.&nbsp; Every year, about 24 patients die while waiting for a new kidney.&nbsp; The Fatwa Committee of MUIS has clearly stated that our Muslim community can participate in HOTA.&nbsp; During the many dialogue sessions carried out, it was discovered that our community has a lot of feedback.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of concerns have been raised, including, firstly, the issue of the surgery that must take place.

This would clash with other human values like the right of individuals to make decisions about their bodies before and after death.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, to more efficiently increase the supply of organs, HOTA rejected the \"active consent\" model, which removes the difficult task of asking family members for a deceased person's organs.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the presumed consent model may annoy those who prefer that donation be a positive and conscious act, we must remember that the procedure for opting out of HOTA is relatively straightforward, although it means being placed at the bottom of the recipient waiting list.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 14 of HOTA correctly rejects the approach of allowing an individual unrestricted autonomy to contract to buy and sell organs at will.&nbsp; This would lead to the \"commodification\" of human organs, as anything has the potential, in a market economy, to become a saleable form of property, up for grabs by the highest bidder.&nbsp; A Japanese sociologist calls this treating of the human body as a menu of spare parts for prolonging life the \"new cannibalism\", which many consider dehumanising.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important that HOTA's public health values limit the freedom of contract of living donors, as the poor and<p align=left>Column:96 </p> vulnerable are most likely to fall prey to perverse monetary incentives for self-mutilation and most in need of protection from economic exploitation.&nbsp; We hear horror stories about the black market trade in organs, like people in India selling kidneys to pay for dowries or how a British woman sold a kidney for $50,000 over the Internet to an American to pay off her legal debts.&nbsp; World Health Organisation guidelines urge that human organ transplants not be commercialised.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is heartening that our domestic laws share this same ethical commitment.&nbsp; Under section 15A, the donation of organs by living persons must be as a gift free from duress, which affirms the vital principle of charity.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is an offence under HOTA to enter into these prohibited contracts (section 14) to make related advertisements (section 15) and to carry out unauthorised living donor organ transplants (sections 15A, 15C).</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Enforcement powers</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the amendment Bill seeks to give more \"teeth\" in the form of enforcement powers to the relevant actors in investigating these offences.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the new Part IVB, inspectors are given broad powers of search and seizure to procure evidence relevant to HOTA offence proceedings.&nbsp; They are authorised under section 15I to arrest without warrant persons reasonably suspected of committing an offence.&nbsp; This entails a deprivation of personal liberty, which Article 9(1) of the Constitution safeguards.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rule of law demands that administrative actors be held accountable for their exercise of public powers, which should have clear legal limits.&nbsp; In all instances, statutory law should be consistent with constitutional standards,<p align=left>Column:97 </p> as the Constitution is the supreme law of the land.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, I have some concerns over the meaning and scope of the powers of arrest under new section 15I, in relation to Article 9(4) of the Constitution which constitutionalises the common law writ of <I>habeas corpus</I>.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Bringing before a Magistrate</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 15(2) states that arrested persons should be produced \"without unnecessary delay\" before a Magistrate.&nbsp; Standing by itself, no guidance on how to compute \"unnecessary delay\" is provided.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 9(4) of the Constitution requires that an arrested person be produced before a magistrate \"without unreasonable delay\".&nbsp; I have two queries.&nbsp; First, is the use of the word \"unnecessary\" delay in HOTA meant to differ from the constitutional standard of \"unreasonable\" delay?&nbsp; If so, could the Minister elaborate?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, Article 9(4) requires that an arrested person be produced before a Magistrate \"in any case within 48 hours (excluding the time of any necessary journey).\" &nbsp;This puts a ceiling or upper limit on what an \"unreasonable delay\" might be; a violation of the 48-hour rule could be challenged by judicial review.&nbsp; My question is, does the 48-hour rule also apply to arrests under section 15I clause (1), so as to qualify what an \"unnecessary delay\" might be under section 15(2), in relation to producing the arrested person before the Magistrate?</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, should section 15I(2) be read with section 15I(4) which states persons arrested under section 15I(1)(a) may only be detained in custody for a period not exceeding \"48 hours (excluding the time for any necessary journey to the Magistrate's Court)\"?&nbsp; If this is the intent,<p align=left>Column:98 </p> it may be better for purposes of clarity to include an express reference to the 48-hour rule in section 15I(2), concerning the time period within which an arrested person must be produced before a Magistrate.&nbsp; Or, should section 15I(2) be read as a stand-alone provision?&nbsp; I hope the Minister can shed some light on this.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Period of detention</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, another issue I am unclear about is the length of the permissible period a person arrested under section 15I(1) may be detained in custody.&nbsp; Section 15I(3) says this should not be \"for a longer period than is reasonable under the circumstances of the case.\" &nbsp;Section 15(4) then says that such period of detention \"shall not exceed 48 hours\".</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does 48 hours then represent the upper limit of a reasonable period of detention?&nbsp; If not, can an arrested person be further detained beyond the initial 48 hours and does the Minister consider that such further detention may be necessary?&nbsp; If detention beyond 48 hours is contemplated, who will authorise this, the executive or judicial branch?&nbsp; Article 9(4) of the Constitution provides that in such cases, there shall be no further detention in custody \"without the Magistrate's authority.\" &nbsp;If HOTA does not envisage a period of detention beyond 48 hours, I hope the Minister can confirm this or otherwise clarify who will authorise further detention.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Extension of HOTA regime to Muslim community</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the amendments to HOTA today have been called a \"milestone\" insofar as the HOTA \"presumed consent\" regime is extended to the Muslim community, who were previously exempt from it.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I note that in the history of discussions surrounding HOTA, a host of <p align=left>Column:99 </p>bioethical and legal issues have been canvassed.&nbsp; The regulation of human organ transplantation provokes strong emotions as it compels us to face our own mortality and to grapple with a complex calculus of competing interests, such as the public interest in healing the sick, prolonging life and improving quality of living, as against the dignity of bodily integrity in life and death.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill makes us face the issue of how to formulate and renovate the most prudent and ethically responsible policy for procuring cadaveric organs.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In treading carefully into these complex waters, the Government has taken pains to consult extensively.&nbsp; It adopted a gradualist approach towards extending HOTA, first, in terms of including other organs besides kidneys like the liver, heart and corneas, and, now, in broadening the class of persons HOTA applies to.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>From forbidden to permissible to encouraged</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is apparent from the series of <I>fatwas</I> on human organ donation issued by the Islamic Religious Council or MUIS that what was once considered forbidden under Islamic law was later considered permissible to save life in cases of dire necessity and now even encouraged as an act of charity.&nbsp; The issue of ownership of the deceased's body as belonging to the guardians of the estate or <I>waris</I> and the need for their consent grounded religious objections against the presumed consent model.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the perspective of public health policy, the problem is that patient demand for organ transplants far exceeds donor supply. &nbsp;In particular, the mainly Muslim Malay community suffers a disproportionate incidence of organ failure.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:100 </p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At its inception, the HOTA provisions relating to the removal of organs after death applied to all Singaporeans and Permanent Residents between 21 and 60.&nbsp; An exception was carved out for Muslims on the basis of religious objection.&nbsp; The then Minister of State for Health said in 1987 that the \"Islamic religion specifically prohibits organ donation under the presumed consent system\".&nbsp; Nonetheless, it was recognised that \"Islam does permit donation of kidneys if it is to save lives\".&nbsp; Individual Muslims had the liberty to opt in and actively pledge to donate their organs under the 1972 Medical (Therapy Education and Research) Act&nbsp;(MTERA) for the purposes of immediate transplant rather than storage, under certain MUIS stipulated conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Practically, this placed Muslim donors on an equal standing with those who did not opt out of HOTA and who enjoyed priority over those who opted out.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, organ allocation under HOTA is not strictly based on need but on a principle of fairness and reciprocity, that those who give should be the first in line to receive.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the Minister also noted in 1987 that the \"active consent\" model under MTERA had been a \"dismal failure\", which was why HOTA adopted a \"presumed consent\" approach.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In July 2007, the MUIS Fatwa Committee issued a <I>fatwa</I> stating it was permissible for Muslims to come under HOTA, to ensure that Muslims suffering organ failure had enhanced access to donated organs.&nbsp; This is consistent with the principle of saving lives and the <I>fatwa</I> presumably played a crucial role in \"green-lighting\" the extension of HOTA to Muslims.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the 2008 amendment, section 5(2)(f) of HOTA will be deleted.&nbsp; This is a religious exemption excluding Muslims from the operation of section 5 which<p align=left>Column:101 </p> provides for organ removal after death by designated hospital officers for transplant purposes.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Muslims are now placed under the same general regime of presumed consent as every other citizen&nbsp;and PR.&nbsp; In addition to yielding more donor organs, the scheme increases the prospects of Muslim patients in receiving donor organs, by placing them in the top priority group, unless they opt out of HOTA.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the extension of the HOTA regime to Muslims implicates matters relating to our constitutional order and more practical concerns.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This amendment is a significant policy shift; how this was arrived at sheds lights on three aspects of constitutional practice in relation to the model of religious liberty and religious pluralism Singapore has adopted.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, it speaks to how the interests of a religious minority are safeguarded under the Singapore model of secular democracy; second, to the general inter-relationship between State and religion; and, third, to the relationship between a religious community and its individual members.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Article 152 and racial and religious minorities</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sir, human organ transplantation raises religious, cultural and personal concerns. The process by which the Muslim community was consulted in this regard indicates how the State treats a religious minority.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It implicates the practical operation of Article 152 of the Constitution, which obliges the Government to constantly care for the interests of racial and religious minorities and especially, to safeguard the socio-cultural interests of Malays as the recognised indigenous people.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:102 </p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a deliberative democracy, giving due attention to different interests is part of rational, responsible policy development.&nbsp; Thus, Muslims were originally exempted from HOTA out of deference to their religious teachings.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This departure from the rule of law principle that the law applies to all citizens with equal force is justified as the Constitution mandates a limited degree of legal pluralism.&nbsp; Under Article 153, Parliament is authorised to enact law to regulate Muslim religious and personal affairs, and did so in the form of the Administration of Muslim Law Act.&nbsp; The Government has also sought to accommodate the concerns of the Muslim community in other matters like the Compulsory Education Act, for example.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sir, by not imposing a uniform \"one size fits all\" model on the Muslim community when HOTA was introduced in 1987, the Government showed that it does take religious sensitivities seriously in formulating law and policy.&nbsp; Indeed, a Muslim MP in 1987 said it was proper to exclude Muslims from the HOTA presumed consent model as this was in accordance with Muslim law.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the Muslim community, with MUIS as the chief representative organ, the issue of human organ procurement and transplants has been the subject of review.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1973, a MUIS <I>fatwa</I> stated it was not permissible to donate one's kidneys to another kidney patient by will.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, the jurisprudence has evolved, in the light of changing social needs and advanced medical technology that made organ transplant a viable form of medical treatment.&nbsp; It is now considered permissible because it serves a pressing, grave need and helps save lives.&nbsp; Organ donation blesses the donor, whose <p align=left>Column:103 </p>continuing donation will yield rewards in the afterlife, and the recipient, whose suffering is alleviated.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is&nbsp;good that the Muslim community and their religious leaders enjoyed the autonomy to work out the tenets of their belief system, to demonstrate the relevance of a living faith and how this applies to novel situations, without forsaking the integrity of basic beliefs.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is both prudent politics and shows fidelity to constitutional obligation under Article 152. Article 153 of the Constitution also recognises the right of religious groups to manage their own religious affairs.<br> &nbsp;<br><I>The relationship between State and religion<br></I> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while it is sometimes appropriate for the State and religion to co-operate, there are instances where the State must keep out of religion. In particular, the Government must recognise the limits of its jurisdiction and competence and not presume to interpret religious or theological questions. This would be an egregious violation of religious freedom as the State has no business determining religious orthodoxy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is consistent with the principle of secular limited government which recognises the co-existence of two distinct realms, the sacred and the secular, such that Caesar should not usurp the realm of God and vice versa. This speaks to the broader issue of religion-State relations and the model of secularism Singapore espouses.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has consistently and wisely rejected a militant form of secularism which is anti-theistic and regards religious faith with hostility. Our version of secularism views religion as a constructive social force and respects it <p align=left>Column:104 </p>as an important source of identity for the majority of Singaporeans professing a religious faith.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government, in engaging with the Muslim community, through consultation and dialogue over the issue of organ transplants, displayed respect for the autonomy of religious communities. It did not ride roughshod over religious reservations but provided space for the community to determine the issue internally.<br>&nbsp;<br><I>Freedom of individual conscience</I><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is highly unlikely that views within any one religious community are unanimous. While the Constitution enjoins the state to respect religious group autonomy, Article 15(1) also safeguards the religious freedom of each individual within a religious community. While the Government can regulate external manifestations of religious practice and propagation, it cannot invade the internal dimension of religious profession or belief. Indeed, the Court of Appeal in 1999 stated that Singapore practised a form of&nbsp; \"accommodative secularism\" which sought to remove restrictions to an individual's choice of religious belief, or unbelief, I might add.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ideological diversity in religion and philosophy is integral to a free society and rests on protecting the sanctity of a free conscience. Part of the freedom to believe in any faith includes the freedom to work out how that religious belief shapes our choices. This includes acting out of personal conviction with regard to how we discharge our duty towards the Creator, which may involve how we wish our bodies to be handled when we have shuffled off our mortal coil.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As James Madison, the fourth US President opined, duties owed to God preceded the claims of Civil Society as \"Before any man can be considered as a<p align=left>Column:105 </p> member of Civil Society, he must be considered as a subject of the Governor of the Universe.\"<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, too, this round of HOTA amendments respects the principle of freedom of individual conscience which is central to religious liberty. Matters of conscience belong to the individual, not to any group or the State. Muslims who continue to feel unease towards the HOTA presumed consent scheme retain the option, like any other Singaporean, to opt out under section 9, whereupon their names will be entered into a register of objectors which the public cannot inspect. While HOTA operates on the basis of a default presumption of consent, the State cannot and does not take away our choice in this regard.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under HOTA, Muslims are able to participate in mainstream society in relation to organ transplants. This should strengthen the sense of solidarity in our common identity and destiny as Singaporeans.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I am unclear about whether organs donated by Muslims will go into a common pool for all citizens or not. From the \"Fiqh of Organ Transplant and its Application in Singapore\" on the MUIS website, it is clear that Muslim organs can be donated to non-Muslims, but does this work the other way round? Can a Muslim receive an organ from a non-Muslim?<br> &nbsp;<br><I>Practical matters</I><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on a more practical note, how can we ensure that the Muslim community at large, which includes non-Malays, is fully informed about the implications of these HOTA amendments? The issues must be explained clearly in the relevant languages, and the opting-out procedure must be simple and accessible. Presumably, they will be notified by mail in the same way those turning 21 are notified, but is this sufficient?<br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column:106 </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MOH website provides much relevant information. However, since HOTA is being applied to the Muslim community for the first time, not all of whom may be Internet-savvy, does the Government have plans to ensure that those with questions about organ donation, both medical and religious, have someone to talk to?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also note that the opt-out form is available on the MOH website but has to be posted&nbsp;- in the age of the Internet and e-filing, could we not allow those wanting to opt out to do so electronically, via the Internet?&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This ties in with the larger issue of the continuing need for public education, given that every year, the class of people subject to the HOTA regime changes as people turn 21 or 61, or assume citizenship.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The perennial concern remains that Singaporeans still have not sufficiently grasped the implications of HOTA's presumed consent model, out of ignorance or apathy, such as the fact they can lodge objections for some but not other organs. Will or are separate registers kept for each organ, and will individuals who object, for example, to cornea transplant alone, nonetheless enjoy priority for kidneys?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason why calls for further educative and publicity measures keep being reiterated is probably because the message is not getting through sufficiently.<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was demonstrated starkly in February 2007 by the unfortunate incident where the relatives of a dead man pleaded with the Singapore General Hospital staff not to remove his organs.&nbsp; After the incident, I read press reports of a spike in the number of requests for opt-out forms such that hospitals ran out of it. Nothing like bad press to cure apathy.<br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column:107 </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adopting a presumed consent model places the Government under less pressure to conduct a public campaign to encourage organ donation, since that is the default position.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If HOTA's chief purpose was mainly to increase the supply of human organs, the coercive force of the law would suffice to accomplish this. However, HOTA also has the noble purpose of promoting benevolence to others, in building a generous-hearted society.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope the Minister can give some assurances that concerted efforts will continue to be made to inform the public about the medical benefits of organ donation and transplants to ensure that they actively support it. For example, could students be informed about these issues as part of their curriculum?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately, HOTA reminds us that 'no man is an island entire of itself' as John Donne so eloquently put it. We all have the opportunity to demonstrate \"compassion\" by helping to bear the distress of the suffering, with whom we share a common humanity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"center\"><B>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Ms Indranee Rajah) in the Chair]</B></p><p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">5.08 pm</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As human beings, we taste of the same pool of sufferings; perhaps the only thing that makes sorrow bearable is that there can be something redemptive about it, by blessing another out of a tragedy.

We cannot take anything with us, except the legacy of how we lived our lives.&nbsp; The message behind HOTA is: don't take your organs<p align=left>Column:108 </p> with you&nbsp;- others have need of that which you cannot use anymore. To quote Peter Petrelli, a character from the TV show, Heroes: \"Death is the one thing that connects us all. It reminds us that what's really important is who we've touched, how much we've given.

This option was provided in view of the sensitivity of organ transplantation at that point in time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the recent edict or <I>fatwa</I> by MUIS on Muslim organ donor and transplantation, all apprehension on the matter has been generally lifted and doubts have been widely cleared.&nbsp; More importantly, through extensive dialogues and feedback sessions, we have noticed the positive change in mindset towards organ donation.&nbsp; And with these proposed amendments, we have been presented with a clear path to move forward.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the scope of HOTA covers vital organs such as our kidney, liver, heart and cornea, I would like to focus on one of the top&nbsp;10 causes of mortality in Singapore, ie, kidney disease. Kidney disease can lead to kidney failure.&nbsp; It heightens the risk of heart attack, stroke, high blood<p align=left>Column:109 </p> pressure and premature death.&nbsp; It causes anaemia, bone disease and malnutrition.&nbsp; We all know that the escalating prevalence of diabetes and hypertension are some of the common factors that contribute to the increasing incidence of kidney disease.&nbsp; Coupled with the increase in life expectancy, we foresee that a higher percentage of the senior population will be affected by this disease.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A recent study cautions us that by the year 2030, it is estimated that 14% to 15% of the adult Singaporean population will be diabetic.&nbsp; Furthermore, based on some recent statistics, the incidence of end stage kidney failure among the Malays is disproportionately higher than in other races.&nbsp; Of the new cases of end stage kidney failure,&nbsp;22% were Malays, although we make up only 14% of the total resident&nbsp;population.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Health Survey reported&nbsp;that an estimated 11%&nbsp; of Malays have diabetes mellitus compared to&nbsp;7% of&nbsp;Chinese and 15% of Indians.&nbsp; Diabetes mellitus is the main cause of diabetic neuropathy which results in kidney failure.&nbsp;&nbsp;We know&nbsp;disease patients who are seeking treatment would have to face some tough decisions&nbsp;about the choice of treatment - either&nbsp;haemodialysis,&nbsp;peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplantation. Each treatment has advantages and disadvantages and the choice of treatment will have a big impact on the patient's day-to-day lifestyle.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although kidney transplantation is the best treatment for&nbsp;kidney failure, in reality, only a small proportion of the&nbsp;patients receive a kidney transplant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the total population of kidney failure patients, only 5% to 10% receive a kidney transplant.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matching a transplant candidate and recipient is complicated&nbsp;due to multiple<p align=left>Column:110 </p> factors including medical and biological profile compatibility. I was told that we&nbsp;currently have&nbsp;about 600 dialysis&nbsp;patients waiting for deceased kidney&nbsp;donor transplant, and the average waiting for a deceased kidney donor transplant&nbsp;in Singapore is seven years. &nbsp;While waiting, patients undergo other treatment options such as haemodialysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mentioned earlier that the choice of treatment will impact the patient's lifestyle. A typical haemodialysis treatment involves three sessions per week, with each session lasting about three to five hours, and treatment is generally done at a VWO-run dialysis centre and in Government or private hospitals. And after each session, patients sometimes suffer from side effects such as hypotension, lightheadedness, nausea, muscle cramps and fatigue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from the time factor, treatment&nbsp;cost is certainly a concern because&nbsp;unsubsidised haemodialysis is about&nbsp;$80&nbsp;per day, which comes to about&nbsp;$2,400 per month.&nbsp; This does not include the costs of medication, transport and patient care.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of end 2007, there are about 2,100 patients on haemodialysis. To help&nbsp;these patients, we need to increase the likelihood of finding a suitable donor and recipient match.&nbsp; And we can do this by having a larger pool of donors and donated organs.&nbsp; This is a proven fact.&nbsp; Prior to HOTA, deceased donor kidney&nbsp;transplantation only averaged five per year and after HOTA, the number increased to about 13 per year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have basically tripled the number of lives saved per year and, I think, the Minister has mentioned, it is even more than that. The patients who benefit from organ transplantation came from all races and background.&nbsp; And, hence, it is only fair that all should contribute to help&nbsp;the<p align=left>Column:111 </p> whole community. With the inclusion of Muslims under HOTA, we can expect up to five additional organ donors per year and, as mentioned by Dr Fatimah earlier, yielding up to&nbsp;10 kidneys,&nbsp;10 corneas, five livers and five hearts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on&nbsp;records in the year 2006, Malays made&nbsp;up 21% of the total number of patients on the kidney waiting list. However,&nbsp;in the same year, only 16% of the transplanted patients&nbsp;were Malays.&nbsp; Muslims make up 21% of the 600 patients in Singapore who are waiting for an organ transplant but account for only 2% of the patients who actually receive a new organ.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of the HOTA Amendment will improve this situation by allowing enhanced access for Muslim patients to donated organs, as those who require an organ transplant will enjoy equal priority for organ transplants as all other Singaporeans who have not opted out.&nbsp; By&nbsp;consenting to donate our organs, the Muslim community is showing compassion to all and also, in return, benefit from our support.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, as we debate on this Bill today,&nbsp;I am sure&nbsp;the thing that is top of the mind of all that is present here is the patients&nbsp;placed on the organ waiting list.&nbsp; Here and now, we have a chance to make a difference to their lives.

It has been<p align=left>Column:112 </p> 20 years of analysing, discussing and trying to understand the complexities of organ pledging and donation, both from the social and religious point of view.&nbsp; It has been 20 years of trying to cajole and convince Muslim Singaporeans to pledge their organs, in particular their kidneys, through&nbsp;myriad ways.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, 20 years is a very long time, especially when the issue has to be with life and death and to deliberate a worthy change on the subject.&nbsp; For many Muslim kidney patients, it has been 20 years of anguish, suffering and pain and, unfortunately&nbsp;for some, the end of their lives as they waited in vain for a chance of an organ transplant.&nbsp; Just over the last two years, 30 Muslim kidney patients had died.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;stories of recovery and hope for those who underwent transplants but these are few and far between.&nbsp; This is why I believe today is a very important day for Muslim Singaporeans.&nbsp; The Ministry of Health has estimated that 30 more patients will benefit from these changes every year.&nbsp; The changes will not truly solve the problem for organ shortage but more lives will be saved.&nbsp; Assuming the likely passage of this Amendment Bill today, Muslims who did not opt out of HOTA will be on equal footing with other Singaporeans under HOTA, should they ever develop organ disease and need to be put on the waiting list for a transplant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fundamentally, there is no doubt about the urgency and relevance of this Bill.&nbsp; I personally feel that this is the only way to go for Muslim Singaporeans as the opt-in system has clearly not yielded the desired results with&nbsp;an estimate of only 16,000 pledgers out of&nbsp;a potential pool of 300,000 Muslims.&nbsp; More than&nbsp;$1 million has been spent on publicity and educational programmes,&nbsp;yet many Muslims who wanted to opt in face problems, such as getting approval from their paternal Muslim&nbsp;male relatives or <I>waris</I>.&nbsp; The Mufti and the Fatwa<p align=left>Column:113 </p> Committee took a cautious approach by making several incremental changes to enable more Muslims to pledge their organs, ending with a <I>fatwa</I> requiring any two Muslim males as witnesses.&nbsp; However, the number of pledgers continued to plunge to the extent that there were only 87 new pledgers in 2006.&nbsp; The process was clearly a stumbling block arising from many cumbersome procedures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, Islamic jurists from Muslim countries worldwide have long declared organ donation as permissible.&nbsp; However, the issue of presumed consent is different from the opt-in systems that many of these countries have.&nbsp; The presumed consent framework overcomes all these stumbling blocks and makes the process of pledging an easier one.&nbsp; According to MUIS, Singapore is the first country to have a religious edict permitting Muslims to be under a presumed consent system for organ donation.&nbsp; Though it&nbsp;is a long time coming, it is nevertheless a courageous and progressive move reflecting on urgent social needs, the spirit of compassion in Islam and the flexibility in the religion which allows room for change in dire situations, especially where saving of lives&nbsp;is involved.&nbsp; I believe that the issuance of a <I>fatwa</I> on presumed consent will boost up public confidence in this Bill.&nbsp; Another critical factor is also the statement of support from other organisations, such as the Muslim Kidney Action Association (MKAC) and the Singapore Islamic Scholars and Religious Teachers Association (PERGAS).&nbsp; Let me also categorically state my wholehearted support for this life-saving Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The critical nature involving the increasing number of Muslim patients with end stage renal disease makes it imperative that the change be made.&nbsp; This is an issue where religious and community leaders have to show leadership and guide the community to do what is right and <p align=left>Column:114 </p>what is needed without going against the principles of Islam.&nbsp; However, as this is a matter of not just the head but also the heart, it is important that the public is further prepared for such a change.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also happy to note that there has not been an outcry or adverse reaction to the <I>fatwa</I>.&nbsp; I hope that this is because people are more aware of the related issues and not that people are resigned to accepting what they think is <I>fait accompli</I>.&nbsp; This brings me to the point on the importance of continued public education and engagement efforts.&nbsp; The passing of this Bill does not signal an end to this but rather a new beginning.&nbsp; I believe there are three groups of people out there&nbsp;-&nbsp;those who say \"yes\" and support the inclusion in HOTA; the fence-sitters who say \"may be\" and&nbsp;those who say \"no\".&nbsp; I would like to urge the MOH and MUIS to continue to engage the public so that we can strengthen the belief of the group that says \"yes\", address the concerns of the fence-sitters who say \"may be\" and convince those who say \"no\".&nbsp; For this to happen effectively, I would like to suggest that HOTA ambassadors be appointed to spearhead the efforts.&nbsp; These ambassadors can be people from different backgrounds -&nbsp;people who have undergone organ transplants, professionals, Malay grassroots leaders and the elderly and housewives who strongly believe in the merits of HOTA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to highlight the importance of including two specific groups in outreach efforts&nbsp;- they are the Muslim religious teachers and Malay-Muslim doctors.&nbsp; Technical details must be explained clearly and of utmost importance is the stress on the fact that the MOH will respect the sanctity of the dead,&nbsp;as this is a very serious issue for the community.&nbsp; Apart from this, the message of prevention is also important.&nbsp; The public must be advised on the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle and how they can help <p align=left>Column:115</p>themselves in preventing organ diseases from developing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to urge MOH to ensure that there are qualified Malay-speaking counsellors with a good understanding of Islam who can advise families in hospitals on the organ transplant procedures when death occurs to a person who has not opted out of HOTA and has organs that are deemed fit for transplant.&nbsp; The language ability and knowledge of Islam will enable such counsellors to advise families with sensitivity and tact, should there be any disagreements or misunderstandings of the system of presumed consent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, with respect to the provisions in the Bill, I would like to seek clarification from the Minister on empowering MOH officers to conduct investigations of offences under HOTA.&nbsp; I would like to know what would be the differences in approach compared to having investigations done by the Police.&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister what would be done to ensure proper training of officers and what checks would be in place to prevent any abuse of power and authority by such officers.&nbsp; As there is a limited supply of organs obtained through cadaveric transplants, I would also like to urge the Ministry to continue to look for ways to promote live organ transplant between family members.&nbsp; While I am against the idea of giving monetary rewards for live organ transplants, as it may be a prelude to organ trading, I would like MOH to consider offering some&nbsp;incentives to encourage live organ donation amongst family members.&nbsp; Perhaps, a donor medal of honour could be considered for living family members who donate their organs as recognition of their sacrifice and bravery.&nbsp; Another possibility is to offer a fully paid life or disability insurance scheme for such donors, or to extend extra leave from <p align=left>Column:116 </p>work that would be paid for by the Government.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, allow me to continue my speech in Malay:</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It is a change that should be supported because it will help save lives and increase the quality of life of some organ patients.&nbsp; With this system of presumed consent, Malays with organ diseases in the future do not have to wait too long if they have to be put in the organ transplant list.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not contradictory with the nature of Islam that emphasises compassion and gives room for changes through the process of consultation, if there is a dire situation like currently, because it involves someone's life.&nbsp; Apart from issuing a <I>fatwa</I>, the support given by PERGAS shows that what is being done is consistent with Islamic teachings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I was told that there are those who are not convinced or not sure on certain issues, like declaration of brain death, how their organs will be removed, when the body will be buried and such matters.&nbsp; I suggest that a public awareness campaign be launched by the Ministry of Health and MUIS with the cooperation of others, especially the religious teachers and religious leaders in the community.&nbsp; Malay-Muslim doctors also have to play their part because they can bring a different perspective in this issue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, there are those in the community who always raise the same issue, that is whether the organ from a Muslim body will be used by organ patients who are Muslims.&nbsp; I think such <p align=left>Column:117 </p>view must be changed because it is against the universal value of compassion.&nbsp; Many Malay organ patients have benefited from the organ donation of other races.&nbsp; We do not want to be seen as a community that only receives but does not give.&nbsp; Let the issue of assessment of suitable organ recipients be done by medical experts.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope the community will accept this change calmly and not emotionally.&nbsp; If there are those who want to be excluded from HOTA, make the decision after getting the full information about related issues, and not based on emotion and feelings.&nbsp; Those who want to do so must also realise that if they have organ disease in the future, the chance of getting a transplant is very low, because individuals who exclude themselves from HOTA are given less priority in the transplant list.&nbsp; Nobody will know what will happen in the future and the possibility of getting organ disease can happen to anyone and at any time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, I like to urge the Malay-Muslim community of Singapore to give full support towards HOTA and together give support to this noble and compassionate effort.</p></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Muslim jurists and academics locally, and from the region and beyond, hold the same view, as can be seen from a seminar convened by a key Malay-Muslim community organisation, Jamiyah, as early as 1994, where they explained in <p align=left>Column:119 </p>great detail the jurisprudential perspectives on the permissibility of organ donation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Fatwa ruling</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fatwa Committee, chaired by the Mufti and with leaders from the Muslim religious community, agrees with these Muslim jurists.&nbsp; To help facilitate organ donation by Muslims, the Fatwa Committee has unanimously decided to allow the inclusion of Muslims under HOTA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people, including Dr Ahmad Magad, have asked why this <I>fatwa</I> has only come into being now, after more than 20 years of HOTA.&nbsp; Madam, the <I>fatwa</I> institution is evolutionary in nature, and responds to changes and circumstances to meet the interests and welfare of the community.&nbsp; The <I>fatwa</I> on HOTA has evolved gradually over the last 20 years.&nbsp; During these years, the Fatwa Committee has continued to give the issue of organ donation careful thought and consideration, and assessed the effectiveness of each <I>fatwa</I> over time in meeting the needs of those suffering from organ failure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the <I>fatwa</I> of 2004 which sought to facilitate organ donation by removing the requirement of consent of <I>waris</I> or next-of-kin, the number of Muslim pledgers has not increased substantially.&nbsp; In fact, there were only 87 new Muslim pledgers in 2006.&nbsp; At the same time, there are still many patients on the waiting list.&nbsp; Some have passed away while waiting for an organ transplant.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, allow me now&nbsp;to explain the process by which we gained support, leading up to the <I>fatwa.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;To heighten the community's awareness of the issue, senior religious officials from MUIS met<p align=left>Column:120 </p> the community and presented to them the religious perspectives of the issue in three public dialogue sessions in July last year, and discussed the organ donation issue in the sermon during Friday prayers at mosques all over Singapore on 6th July 2007. &nbsp;These were reported extensively in the Malay media, such as <I>Berita Harian</I>, <I>Warna</I> and <I>Suria</I>, and attracted much public discussion, including several calls from the community for the authorities to amend HOTA to include Muslims.&nbsp; MUIS also sought the views of the <I>asatizah</I> community or the religious teachers.&nbsp; The majority were supportive, and some expressed the move as \"long overdue\".&nbsp; The overall feedback confirmed that the Muslim community was largely supportive of the pressing need for organ donation to save lives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Islamic virtues, such as <I>ihsan</I> (kindness) and <I>rahmah</I> (compassion), require us to find solutions to problems, to actively help those in pain and save lives. &nbsp;These factors were key to the deliberations on the inclusion of Muslims under HOTA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days following the issuance of the <I>fatwa</I>, MUIS informed me that they received over 50 calls, the majority of whom were supportive of the move. &nbsp;This finding is consistent with the feedback received during public consultation sessions and feedback received via email and telephone.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we do acknowledge that there is a segment, as pointed out by Dr Ahmad Magad,&nbsp;that is not supportive of HOTA, but we cannot afford to wait until everyone is convinced before proceeding.&nbsp; We respect the decision of those who wish to opt out and have made the opt-out forms easily available for them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Public education</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I would like to reassure Dr Ahmad Magad, Dr Fatimah Lateef, Mdm Halimah Yacob and&nbsp;Prof. Thio Li-ann&nbsp;that <p align=left>Column:121 </p>our public education efforts will not stop should the Bill be passed.&nbsp; Our efforts to help all in the community appreciate the urgency of suffering organ failure patients and understand the need for organ donation will continue, and will be intensified.&nbsp; MUIS is producing an information booklet to address religious matters and will continue to respond actively to all who may have queries.&nbsp; More public dialogues will also be held, and these&nbsp;dialogues will include the&nbsp;<I>asatizahs</I> and the Muslim doctors, as suggested by Dr Ahmad Magad.&nbsp; I also&nbsp;welcome Dr Ahmad's suggestion to implement a HOTA Ambassadors programme to spearhead the public education efforts.&nbsp; I think this is a good idea, and ask that the Ministry of Health and MUIS look into implementing it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Thio has also asked the question&nbsp;whether Muslims can receive from or donate organs to non-Muslims.&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is yes.&nbsp; There are no restrictions in the religion, and Dr Ahmad Magad has also made&nbsp;the same point raised by some people within the community.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Conclusion</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the inclusion of Muslims under HOTA will be a milestone in the progress of the Muslim community. &nbsp;I would like to thank all Members for their support to include Muslims under HOTA.&nbsp; As mentioned by Mr Zainudin Nordin, it reflects a positive change in the mindset of the community.&nbsp; It also shows how Muslims in Singapore are flexible and able to make the necessary changes for the greater good, as pointed out by Dr Fatimah.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment to HOTA is a blessing for the Muslim community and Singapore that will save more people suffering from organ failure.&nbsp; To help make this happen, I sincerely hope that few people will choose to opt out if the Bill is passed.&nbsp; I am pleased to note that<p align=left>Column:122 </p> feedback from our community leaders and members of the public during the consultation sessions has indicated that few people have any intention of doing so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the amendment proposed today to include Muslims under HOTA has the support of the Muslim community.&nbsp; It has been a long journey, and the proposal will resolve a long-standing challenge facing the community while at the same time help strengthen the community's resolve to be a dynamic and progressive pillar of the Singaporean society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Mdm Deputy Speaker, the problem faced by a patient with a failed organ is not a new issue.&nbsp; I am saddened by newspaper reports about patients who have to wait many years to undergo organ transplant, but have a very slim hope to receive a suitable organ.&nbsp; The hardship of these patients and their families is aggravated by the financial burden and physical difficulty due to their dialysis treatment, making them unable to enjoy a normal life that sometimes we take for granted.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us look at the experience of Mr Mohamad Nazel Ahmad.&nbsp; In July last year, <I>Berita Harian</I> brought to our attention the story of Mr Nazel, who is 44 years old with two children.&nbsp; He went through dialysis for 20 years.&nbsp; With an income of only $800 per month, his story showed the difficulty of patients facing organ failure.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few patients are luckier.&nbsp; Mr Mohd Selamat Mohd Ali, who received a heart donation, had first suffered a heart attack in 1998.&nbsp; Luckily, he was given a new lease of life in 2001, when a Chinese family consented that the heart of their relative who passed away, be donated to<p align=left>Column:123 </p> him.&nbsp; Their consent at that time was by chance only because there was no long-term treatment for heart failure.&nbsp; Mr Mohd Selamat's experience has encouraged members of his family to pledge their organs.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue of organ donation is not new.&nbsp; However, I am happy because the Muslim community today has given solid support in this effort to overcome a challenge that we have faced for some time.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are a progressive community and we do not hesitate to face challenges.&nbsp; We realise how big this challenge is and we welcome effective solutions that are introduced to overcome it. Based on this stand, and supported by advancements in the medical science technology, the MUIS Fatwa Committee has reviewed this issue and allowed the Muslim community to be included in HOTA.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand some of them are quite concerned about the issues of organ transplants.&nbsp; We are aware that Islam, in general, forbids us to do things which are against Islamic law, such as disrespecting a dead body.&nbsp; However, Islam allows surgery on a dead body in order to save lives, for example, for post-mortem Caesarian section on a woman who has passed away, in order to save the baby that she was carrying.&nbsp; This is not considered as a mistreatment of a dead body, which is forbidden in Islam.&nbsp; In Singapore, the Ministry of Health ensures that the surgery on the dead body is the same as the surgery on a live patient. &nbsp;The operated dead body is handled properly and respectfully, and the surgery is done carefully.&nbsp; The ethical standard on this organ transplantation will be carefully monitored and reviewed constantly.<br></p><p align=left>Column:124</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One other major feedback is on the delay in burial so that organ transplant can be done.&nbsp; I am sure that all of us have seen our family members and close friends carry out the process of burial as soon as possible.&nbsp; Some of us are concerned whether the delay in the burial in order to carry out organ transplantation is wrong in Islam.&nbsp; It is true that Islam prohibits us to delay burial without a permissible reason.&nbsp; However, delays done to save human lives are considered a good reason, which is permissible in Islam.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has given due consideration to this feedback.&nbsp; MUIS will work together with the Ministry of Health to overcome such concerns.&nbsp; We will do our best to handle this issue, especially on the aspect of respecting the deceased and expediting the burial procedure as much as possible.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <I>fatwa</I> which allows organ transplantation is proof that the local Muslim community is a progressive one; a community which wants to play its part to overcome the challenges faced by Singapore; and a community which not only receives, but also gives.&nbsp; This <I>fatwa</I> portrays Singapore Muslims as a community that practises the true spirit of Islam and wants to save the lives of all human beings, regardless of their religion.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to end my speech by expressing my thanks to the Muslim community for their support in the public dialogue sessions, especially those who have assisted the organ failure patients in whatever way.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am confident that, as a community, we will show our support by choosing not to opt out of HOTA.&nbsp; As Muslims, all of us have a responsibility to save human life and this is the way to prove it.&nbsp; I also hope that all of you will be able to sit with your family and close friends, and urge those who are still doubtful, to support this noble effort to save lives.</p></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Muslim MPs, in particular, have gone all out to help rally support for this Bill.&nbsp; They have not merely stated their stand clearly in this House.&nbsp; They have conducted many dialogue sessions in the mosques and the community centres to help us reach out to the Muslim community to explain what HOTA is all about, how they can save lives by supporting HOTA and that HOTA is not in conflict with their religion.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry and the many patients with kidney failure are grateful for their support and their tireless efforts, and the efforts to reach out to explain and reassure will continue.&nbsp; As noted by all Members, it is important that we keep up the efforts to improve the public's understanding of organ donation, brain death and presumed consent.&nbsp; These are difficult concepts and I do not think, even with intensified efforts, we can say, \"All right, at the end of this year, that's it, we do not have to do it anymore.\"&nbsp; It is not possible.&nbsp;

Furthermore, we will henceforth no longer need to make the distinction between Muslims and non-Muslims on HOTA.&nbsp; All information dissemination regarding organ donation or HOTA will continue and will appear regularly in our local media.&nbsp;

Concepts like brain death, presumed consent and the religious implications require regular explanation and a sustained educational effort. It is time-consuming, it is costly, but it is necessary.&nbsp; The more effective we are in this, in easing the fears and concerns of donors and their families, the more lives we can save.&nbsp; Dr Ahmad Magad suggested that we rope in organ recipients, professionals, grassroots leaders and other persons who strongly believe in HOTA as our HOTA ambassadors to help us explain HOTA and to ensure buy-in.&nbsp; Next month, we will refresh our HOTA website to also be a repository of human stories from people whose lives have been changed after receiving the gift of life, and they will be our online HOTA ambassadors.<br></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, we are gearing up to inform the Muslim community about this Bill and its implications.&nbsp; We are preparing 300,000 packages to be individually delivered to all the Muslim citizens and PRs aged 21 to 60.&nbsp; The packages will be comprehensive and easily readable. Each package will contain four things:<br></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; a letter informing them that they will soon be included under HOTA unless they opt out;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; an information booklet on HOTA describing in detail the implications of being included under HOTA;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; a booklet prepared by MUIS explaining why Muslims can now be <p align=left>Column:127 </p>included under HOTA and the Islamic position on organ donation; and<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; an opt-out form for those who wish to do so.</p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have done a similar exercise before, although in a more simplified fashion, when we first introduced HOTA in 1987, and again in 2004 when we amended it to include other organs.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it will still be a massive exercise for us.&nbsp; We estimate that it will take us three months, from February to June to complete it.&nbsp; The actual inclusion of Muslims under HOTA will then commence on 1st August 2008.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Fatimah proposed that we lower the age of HOTA inclusion from 21 to 18.&nbsp; I have also received suggestions from the public to raise the maximum age of 60 as the organs of those dying above 60 are often also suitable for transplantation.&nbsp; But these proposals require further study.&nbsp; Let us concentrate on extending HOTA to the Muslims first as that itself is a major milestone and we want to make sure that it is implemented well, achieving results of saving lives without causing undue worries and concerns to the community. Meanwhile, those who are between 18 and 21, and who wish to make an organ pledge can do so under MTERA.<br></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah and Dr Fatimah reminded our hospitals to be extra sensitive when approaching organ donation cases and their families.&nbsp; They said that our hospital staff should be well-trained and have relevant communication skills so as to minimise conflicts with the distressed family members.&nbsp; We should also streamline the process flow to make it a little easier for the grieving families.&nbsp; I fully agree.&nbsp; We have had 20 years of such experience, but each incident is a case study for us, to learn and to refine our process. &nbsp;Following the SGH's incident last <p align=left>Column:128 </p>year which Mdm Halimah mentioned, and which Prof. Thio talked about too, we have now made social worker support for the donor family mandatory for every organ donation case.&nbsp; All such family members will receive grief counselling and emotional support.&nbsp; And we have also enhanced the training of the senior doctors who are responsible for giving final authorisation in organ donation cases to further equip them with crisis management skills.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Measures have been put in place to ensure that all doctors who take on this task are well-trained and retrained.&nbsp; We have also sought the assistance of the various religious groups to provide volunteers whom we can call upon to help address any religious concerns that may arise during the organ retrieval process.&nbsp; With the inclusion of Muslims under HOTA, MUIS has agreed to provide religious support to advise Muslim families on the position of Islam on organ donation and HOTA, should the need arise.&nbsp; Hospitals will also rope in doctors and nurses who can better communicate in Bahasa Melayu in this effort. Volunteer HOTA ambassadors are welcome to join in such hospital activities, whenever the need arises.<br></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the dialogues with the Muslim community, many expressed the concern that any organ transplantation should not unduly delay the release of the body to the family.&nbsp; We took this feedback to heart.&nbsp; We have tightened operational procedures and coordination between hospitals, the Police and the pathologists.&nbsp; We will cut out any unnecessary delay.&nbsp; There was also a request that hospital mortuaries should provide for what it called \"washing and shrouding\" facilities for the use of the family members.&nbsp; Our hospitals will proceed to set up such facilities in the mortuaries.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ahmad Magad spoke about living donor organ transplantation and how this <p align=left>Column:129 </p>could augment cadaveric transplantation.&nbsp; Since this House legislated on living organ transplantation in 2004, the number of living organ transplants has risen.&nbsp; There were 111 living organ transplantations last year. My Ministry encourages living organ donation.&nbsp; This is a viable option for many patients but cultural hindrances remain.&nbsp; We will step up patient and professional education efforts.&nbsp; We are supporting a pilot programme to counsel newly diagnosed kidney failure patients on the benefits of living kidney donation so that living donor transplant is considered ahead of dialysis.&nbsp; We do provide some subsidies to live organ recipients to help defray the cost of organ transplantation and long-term immuno-suppressive medication, but we should not unwittingly end up promoting the trading of organs.<br></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem of organ shortage is worldwide.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, an international organ trade has emerged, as observed by Mdm Halimah.&nbsp; We should not be a party to it.&nbsp; The beefed-up investigative and enforcement powers in the Bill will further help keep Singapore stay clear of organ trading.&nbsp; Dr Ahmad Magad would like to know the difference between MOH officers conducting investigations under HOTA and the Police conducting such investigations.&nbsp; He has asked what would be done to ensure that MOH's enforcement officers are properly trained.&nbsp; We will ensure that our enforcement officers will receive the necessary training and instruction, both internally and from the Police, so that they can carry out their work professionally.&nbsp; In fact, some of these officers are likely to be ex-Police officers with relevant experience. They will all be closely supervised by a chain of command and be required to carry identification cards which they must produce on demand when exercising their powers.&nbsp; In substance, the change will not differ much from today.&nbsp; The key difference is that we will build up investigation and enforcement capabilities internally within<p align=left>Column:130 </p> the Ministry of Health so that we do not have to rely on the Police which has so many other responsibilities. &nbsp;Hopefully, this will speed up investigation and enforcement.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Fatimah reminded us about being sensitive to patient confidentiality, and we certainly would. &nbsp;Prof. Thio asked how section 15I relates to Article 9 of the Constitution.&nbsp; Certainly, the intention is that we have to be consistent with what is in the Constitution.&nbsp; I am not familiar with legal details to know what does that mean, but certainly, constitutional supremacy must apply here.<br></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ahmad Magad stressed that even as we amend HOTA to help save lives, the best approach is still prevention, and I cannot agree more.&nbsp; Those who are predisposed to develop kidney failure should actively change their lifestyle and diet.&nbsp; They should start exercising regularly if they have not already done so.&nbsp; They should work with their family GPs, take medication diligently and test their blood sugar and cholesterol regularly.&nbsp; Sorry for this commercial, but it is such an important message that it is worth repeating.&nbsp; Each year in Singapore - and this is a sad figure - there are close to 700 patients who have amputations involving their lower limb as a result of uncontrolled diabetes.&nbsp; That means, every day, two patients lose part of their lower limb because of diabetes which is not well-controlled, but it is largely avoidable.&nbsp; Many more suffer from other complications such as heart disease, stroke and blindness.&nbsp; All these conditions cause unnecessary suffering and loss of productivity.&nbsp; Let us be proactive to reduce such miseries.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me thank Prof. Thio for sharing with us her insights on \"legal pluralism\".&nbsp; It is a new word for me.&nbsp; I learn something today.&nbsp; As a layman, I interpret that to mean that we take a practical approach in<p align=left>Column:131 </p> Singapore.&nbsp; Our laws evolved gradually and take into account that we are a multi-racial and multi-religious society; we cannot simply just apply one law for all.&nbsp; I thank her for giving us a very good account of how HOTA has gradually evolved over the years and, within the Muslim community, how <I>fatwa</I> has evolved over the years in response to the needs of the society, and as we understand the science better.<br></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She also asked whether we could simplify opting out, for example, electronically.&nbsp; I believe our current system of opting out is quite simple and highly simplified, but we will always see whether we could simplify it further.&nbsp; Online opting out has a bit of problem because we do need witnesses to witness the opting out. She also asked how is the distribution of organs organised.&nbsp; For instance, can you opt out of one organ and not for the others?&nbsp; If so, what happens to your priority for each organ?&nbsp; Yes, we manage each individual organ separately as far as organ transplantation is concerned.&nbsp; You can opt out for a cornea or heart, but your priority in other organs which you have not opted out will be unaffected.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She also asked the question about organs being transplanted between races, ie, from Muslims to non-Muslims, or from non-Muslims to Muslims.&nbsp; There is a waiting list for each organ and we have an expert committee formally chaired by Prof. Goh Lee Gan to decide on the priority of distribution.&nbsp; The Committee has, over the years, evolved quite a scientific way of computing points for each of the objective criteria. Relying on memory, there are three important sets of criteria.&nbsp; One, because you want a successful transplantation, ie, to maximise the chance of a successful transplantation so that patients survive and live for a long time.&nbsp; Therefore, tissue matching is <p align=left>Column:132 </p>paramount.&nbsp; Maximum points go to those tissues which match the closest.&nbsp; Second, because of HOTA, those who opted out enjoy lower priority than those who do not opt out.&nbsp; Third is how long the patients have been on the waiting list.&nbsp; Those who have waited longer will have a better chance than those who are still new.&nbsp; So, using this system of scoring, the Committee decides on the patients' priority.&nbsp; Race does not come into it.&nbsp; The example that I gave in my Second Reading speech just now was about a Malay businessman who had a liver which came from a Chinese.<br></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Mdm Halimah put it, this Bill marks an important and significant change.&nbsp; Muslims will soon be included under HOTA.&nbsp; The change comes too late for some who died while waiting, but better late than never.&nbsp; I thank Members for joining me in this fight to save some more lives \"without having even to lift a finger\", as Mayor Zainudin put it.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.05 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to urge this House to look into the issue of bullying in our schools.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The schoolyard bully in our schools is getting busier, bolder and brainier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Busier</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Awareness of bullying in our schools has been on the rise since 2002, with over 50 articles appearing in the Singapore press over the past five years.&nbsp; Surveys on the percentage of students who have been bullied in school appear to show that the school bully has been working overtime.&nbsp; While numbers and statistics on the incidences and effects of bullying in Singapore are difficult to come by and, when available, vary considerably, the available figures are alarming.&nbsp; The Coalition against the Bullying of Children and Youth (CABCY), which surveyed 4,000 students, reported in 2007 that figure to be 94.7%.&nbsp; The Singapore Children's Society (SCS) reported 25% with a sample of 535 students, while MOE's figure stand at 3.7% from a sample of 1,000 students.&nbsp; I believe that MOE's figures are reflective of actual reported cases, and are thus considerably lower.&nbsp; CABCY also reported in its survey that 11.5% of respondents indicated being bullied more than once a week.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Bolder</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> The school bully also appears to have become bolder.&nbsp; Bullying in school has so<p align=left>Column:134 </p> far resulted in one recorded suicide in 2003 and a significant number of hospitalisations.&nbsp; In August 2002, a Secondary 1 student was punched in the face, resulting in&nbsp;over 20 stitches and a corneal tear.&nbsp; In May 2003,&nbsp;a Secondary 3 student from a top boys' school was a victim of multiple punches by improvised objects used as weapons.&nbsp; In 2006, a 13-year old girl was viciously kicked, punched and stripped by a group of girls who reportedly belonged to a gang.&nbsp; Teachers have also reported a number of bullies with gang connections who appear to be more emboldened.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Brainier</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The school bully has also become more technologically savvy.&nbsp; The four and a half minute video clip of the assault on the 13-year old girl who was kicked, punched and stripped was widely circulated.&nbsp; The worst is that it is still available on the Internet by her assailants.&nbsp; Watching this clip gave me a sickening nauseous feeling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, a classmate of a Secondary 1 student from a well-known girls' school uploaded a defaced photo of her in a blog, called her names, and called for a \"mob to be raised against her\".&nbsp; The blog received over 8,000 hits in 24 hours.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wired Safety, a Washington-based Internet Safety and Help Group, reported in 2006 that Singapore had the highest incidence of Internet bullying among children in any country outside the US, with 80 incidences in 2005.&nbsp; Of the 1,100 teenagers surveyed in 2005, a third said that they received email messages that frightened or bullied them, 14% said that they experienced bullying through SMS, and 13% through instant chat clients like MSN.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Ramifications</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Bullying in schools can occur in any setting and takes many forms.&nbsp; It occurs<p align=left>Column:135 </p> in schools without exception, regardless of socio-economic or cultural background.&nbsp; The various types are verbal, physical, racial and cyber bullying.&nbsp; Although in Singapore, verbal bullying is most common, the two emerging forms of bullying are cyber bullying and racially motivated bullying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bullying has clear, deleterious impacts on both the victim and the bully.&nbsp; Numerous studies on the subject have noted a positive correlation between being bullied and an increased risk of depression, anxiety, low self-esteem and even suicide.&nbsp; Several victims have reportedly digressed into becoming bullies themselves.&nbsp; Bullying also has a negative effect on the bully, including increased estrangement from the rest of the school and/or society, and contributes to an increased risk of the bully being engaged in criminal activity and youth delinquency.&nbsp; International research has shown that bullies by the age of 17 to 27 have a higher incidence to enter into crime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Shortfalls</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> To effectively deal with the issue, we ourselves need to be busier, bolder and brainier.&nbsp; We may well have been busier and have implemented some good initiatives like the Anti-Bullying Kit and the addition of full-time Counsellors in all schools by&nbsp;end 2008.&nbsp; However, there is room for improvement in the following areas:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(1)&nbsp; Lack of information</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There appears to be a lack of readily available information concerning the issue of bullying.&nbsp; MOE's website contains no information on bullying, and no links to sites that do.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a glaring contrast to the UK's Department of Children, Schools and Families, which operates its own anti-bullying site.&nbsp; Additionally, nearly all <p align=left>Column:136 </p>Australian State Departments of Education websites also contain dedicated information channels.&nbsp; This \"information hole\" results in teachers and students having to approach NGOs, such as CABCY and SCS, for information.&nbsp; Although both organisations do their best to assist, their resources are limited, and they are unable to assist everyone, leaving individual students and teachers with potentially no one else to turn to.&nbsp; The only Singapore specific websites dedicated to the issue are those operated by SCS and CABCY.&nbsp; Both provide good resources online, but are not yet endorsed by MOE or linked to MOE's official website.&nbsp; A Primary 3 student could not have articulated this need more clearly when she implored in an interview with CABCY,&nbsp;\"Have more education on bullying.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(2) Lack of training for teachers</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although awareness about bullying is high in most schools, thanks to initiatives, such as the Singapore Children's Society's annual Bully-Free Week, teachers are, to a large extent, unaware of how to deal with the issue due to a lack of appropriate training.&nbsp; Teachers&nbsp;receive no training in how to deal with bullying despite the large number of hours devoted annually to teacher training.&nbsp; This means that teachers are unable to spot the victims of bullying early on to take the appropriate measures.&nbsp; Teachers who are not trained may also not be adept at identifying cases of bullying, because victims are too afraid to speak up, while bystanders choose to remain silent for fear that they might be the next target.&nbsp; A Primary 6 student said in the CABCY survey, \"Teachers should be able to tell if a student is unhappy or sad in class, and start action to <I>find</I> the bully.\"&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bullying in&nbsp;schools is often left unexposed until it is either too late - when physical violence has occurred - or as in one extreme case, when the victim<p align=left>Column:137</p> had taken her life.&nbsp; This victim, an Express student, recorded the majority of the bullying incidents inside her diary from Secondary 1&nbsp;to Secondary 4.&nbsp; She suffered bullying in school on a daily basis.&nbsp; To this date, this girl's father believes that she would not have committed suicide if the bullying had been dealt with properly by the school.&nbsp; Research has shown that although some teachers deal effectively with the problem, there are a good number who routinely dismiss these incidents as \"youthful misdemeanour\", or recently in the words of a young primary school teacher, \"childish bullying cases\".&nbsp; These may largely be due to a lack of training and awareness and/or a culture of apathy and misunderstanding, which is my next point.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(<I>3)&nbsp; Culture of apathy and misunderstanding</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lack of training and awareness appears to have engendered and propagated a dearth in apathy and understanding, further<p align=left>Column: 163</p> exacerbating the problem.&nbsp; MOE treats bullying as a \"disciplinary problem\", which is far too general for an issue of such severity.&nbsp; The issue of bullying is linked by MOE to other problems, such as general misbehaviour and discipline, and is treated as a component or subset of discipline instead of a single issue.&nbsp; More worrying is to view bullying as a \"part and parcel of life\".&nbsp; This gives bullies and their victims the impression that the practice is acceptable and even normal.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

In October 2003, one school dismissed seven severe bullying cases as being \"thoughtless pranks\".&nbsp; In a separate incident, a bullying victim reported being pushed from teacher to teacher for help like, in the words of the victim, \"a ping-pong ball\".&nbsp; A Primary Six student's<p align=left>Column:138 </p> comments drove home this point.&nbsp; He said in the CABCY survey, \"I would not tell the teachers anything. I'd take&nbsp;it into my own hands\".&nbsp; Another Primary Three student remarked,&nbsp;\"I feel sad and hurt.&nbsp; Teachers should take action when they receive students' complaints\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Insufficient support for NGOs</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NGOs such as CABCY and SCS face a myriad of challenges when trying to assist schools, students, teachers and parents in dealing with bullying.&nbsp; SCS receives some Government funding but a majority goes to their main causes of child poverty and abuse.&nbsp; CABCY receives no Government funding.&nbsp; Cooperation between MOE, its schools and NGOs has also been patchy, if not poor, with the only tangible deliverable being the Anti-Bullying Kit jointly produced by MOE and CABCY.&nbsp; Both NGOs can only intervene when asked to do so, as the final jurisdiction lies within the schools.&nbsp; Notably, many schools&nbsp;have made&nbsp;a point of attempting to handle all cases \"in-house\".&nbsp; CABCY has, on many instances, been dismissed by schools when trying to assist victims of bullying.&nbsp; Some schools, notably, Ping Yi Secondary School, have benefited from cooperating closely with the NGOs.&nbsp; Despite these setbacks, both NGOs have been instrumental in helping to raise awareness and assisting within their capacities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Learning from others</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We could learn from other countries, which have had significant successes in dealing with bullying in schools.&nbsp; Amongst them, two examples stand out - that of the United Kingdom and Australia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I>The UK has adopted a tough no-tolerance policy on bullying in schools.&nbsp; Since 1999, UK schools are mandated to implement anti-bullying policies.&nbsp; Inspections are conducted regularly to <p align=left>Column:139 </p>evaluate and suggest improvements to anti-bullying measures.&nbsp; The topic of bullying has also been integrated into the national curriculum.&nbsp; All teachers are also trained to handle bullying cases during regular in-service training.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Australia has implemented a host of counter-bullying initiatives for its schools over the past 13 years.&nbsp; These include raising awareness through the use of self-report questionnaires, provision of instruction and activities in the school curriculum to enable bullying to be addressed amongst students, formation of&nbsp;discussion groups involving parents, empowerment through Student Anti-Bullying Committees, Peer Support programmes and the use of counselling methods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>The way forward</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As mentioned earlier, we need to be <I>busier, bolder</I> and <I>brainer</I> to counter the contemporary ills of bullying.&nbsp; I would like to offer some suggestions:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) MOE could look into the implementation of anti-bullying policies in all schools, with new guidelines or modifications to existing guidelines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;MOE could look into enhancing its cooperation with the NGOs mentioned, to leverage on their expertise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;MOE could pay more emphasis on student welfare and well-being to help reverse the negative and pressurised atmosphere that leads to both misbehaviour and bullying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;Teachers should be more adequately trained to deal with bullying.&nbsp; This will help increase detection rates and in turn protect students from further harm by dealing with the issue earlier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:140</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp;More information on bullying should be made available to students, parents and schools.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Schools should make it clear from the very start that bullying is unacceptable, and warrants heavy punishments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At this juncture, I would like to read the excerpts of a letter from one former&nbsp;teacher of more than 30 years, Mr Murali Sharma&nbsp;who wrote to me last Thursday, and I quote, \"I read in <I>Today,</I> 17th January 2008 that you will raise the issue of Bullying in Schools on Monday.&nbsp;So I want to pen some thoughts for your consideration.&nbsp; As an ex-teacher and grandparent, I am concerned that we are sliding down the slippery slope to ill-discipline.&nbsp; I am glad you are speaking up on the issue of bullying in schools.&nbsp; Parents have a right to know that their children are safe in school.&nbsp; I agree with your observation that in the past, ill-discipline and bullying have been swept under the carpet by being described as 'thoughtless pranks\".&nbsp; I agree&nbsp;that bullying in schools is past toleration point.&nbsp; It has been so, for quite some time\".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion,&nbsp;bullying is a problem that needs to be tackled.&nbsp; Leaving the situation as it is will not bode well for us.&nbsp; It can be said that the impact of bullying goes far beyond the classroom. MOE should sweep away the years of inaction which has caused pain and anguish to both students and parents.&nbsp; MOE should now take a positive step to the commitment to the&nbsp;students' welfare and well-being.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Education (RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Education (RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew):</B> &nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to respond to some very pertinent points that have been raised by Dr Neo.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to assure her, Members of the House as well as members of the public <p align=left>Column:141 </p>that MOE regards bullying in schools as a serious matter and it is not taken lightly. It is classified as a serious disciplinary offence and we do not condone it in our schools. There is a clear policy for principals and we provide schools with comprehensive guidelines to manage discipline issues in schools. And each school then formulates its own rules and procedures to investigate all reported incidents to assess the case and find the most appropriate means to resolve them quickly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our approach to managing bullying is&nbsp;two-pronged.&nbsp; Firstly, we educate students and teachers about bullying.&nbsp; Teachers are, in their training&nbsp;at NIE, given training in pupil management and this is reinforced during their practicum and as they learn on the job.&nbsp; They are supported by the more senior teachers as well as Heads of Department in dealing with such matters. So, there is some degree, and I agree with Dr Neo, that this is an area that can be strengthened further in the years to come.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For students, we basically take an approach that is somewhat similar to that&nbsp;suggested by Dr Daniel Fung in an article on 2nd September 2007.&nbsp; He is an expert in child psychiatry at the Institute of Mental Health. He suggested a three-pronged approach to the bullying problem,&nbsp;the \"3Ss\" basically: understanding self so that the children know their strengths and weaknesses; having adequate support from parents, teachers and peers; and equipping&nbsp;the children with skills to build self-confidence.&nbsp;This is line with what MOE is doing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have developed the social emotional learning&nbsp;framework and website to provide resources to schools for the development of social emotional competencies such as self-management, help-seeking, relationship management and responsible decision-making.&nbsp; These competencies increase the students' resilience to bullying, plus it equips them <p align=left>Column:142 </p>with the knowledge and skills to handle different challenging situations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our schools have also programmes&nbsp;to raise students' awareness of potential discipline issues, including bullying. These programmes help students to understand what bullying is, inform them of the help channels that are available, and thereby enabling them to help themselves or, as importantly, to support their peers when they are being bullied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, when incidences of bullying occur, schools take action to investigate and assess all reported cases of bullying.&nbsp; We intervene to prevent bullying from persisting.&nbsp; Schools take an educative approach towards the bullies and victims, and provide the necessary counselling and guidance to help them in order that they will learn from these incidents; and, hopefully, not repeat them in future, particularly in the case of the bullies. For serious cases, the school may have to resort to disciplinary measures in order to correct offenders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To support teachers and school counsellors in managing bullying in schools, the MOE has developed a school bullying management kit for all secondary schools in 2007.&nbsp; I think this was mentioned to the House sometime last year.&nbsp; The kit further enhances the personnel's knowledge of what bullying is, how they can reach out and respond to bullying, and assist students who have been bullied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A similar kit was customised for use in primary schools.&nbsp; This has been developed and has been rolled out to the schools at the beginning of this year and it will enable teachers in the primary schools as well as the school counsellors to hopefully provide better support to the victims.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo mentioned the incidence of cyber-bullying and this is certainly something we are very mindful of and we <p align=left>Column:143 </p>agree with&nbsp;her the impact of such incidence.&nbsp; Just last Saturday, I believe the Chinese papers&nbsp;ran an article about how a number of students in one of our schools were receiving threatening messages over the phone and they made a report to the discipline master, and the discipline master brought them to the police station to make a report. While they were there, more calls came in and the police were then&nbsp;subsequently&nbsp;able to track and find the offenders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise that with the increased&nbsp;accessibility&nbsp;to the Internet, to mobile devices and so on,&nbsp;there is a potential area that we have to deal with, with greater urgency.&nbsp; We have already provided a cyberwellness framework to support and guide schools in planning their cyberwellness programmes.&nbsp; The focus is on promoting cyberwellness and guiding students in applying good values when using the Internet but it also includes educating students against cyber bullying, the steps that they can take, how to avoid it, how to make reports and how to be able to get support from their teachers as well as their parents.&nbsp; And we will be preparing a detailed cyberwellness resource kit to complement the school efforts in this regard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to some of the data that&nbsp;she raised from CABCY as well as from the Singapore Children's Society, I want to mention that the prevalence of school bullying can become an issue of contention when it is taken at face value without further understanding how the prevalence figures were derived, because&nbsp;there is&nbsp;quite a wide variation in terms of the survey results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In June 2006, I believe, the Coalition against Bullying for Children and Youth reported that about 95% of primary and secondary school students have experienced school bullying.&nbsp; The student<p align=left>Column:144</p> health survey conducted by the Health Promotion Board in 2006 using a representative sample of secondary and JC students revealed that about 32% of the students indicated that they have been bullied in the past six months. The Singapore Children's Society's latest primary school bullying survey 2007 reported a prevalence rate of 21% bullying among primary school students.&nbsp; This was the most recent survey.&nbsp; I think they had an earlier survey in 2003 and 2004 when they reported 95% bullying incidences.&nbsp; So, over the space of three years, I think they must have done a new survey and this was the reported rate of&nbsp;incidence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do check with the NGOs as to how they&nbsp;conducted the survey and they shared with us their findings in quite some detail.&nbsp; They are derived from studies that vary in methodology, definition of bullying criteria,&nbsp;prevalence definition and so on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have our own internal system which monitors the state of discipline in the schools amongst the students, including the bullying situation.&nbsp; Our own internal surveys showed that the HPB and the Singapore Children Society survey findings more closely reflect, according to our own findings, the prevalence of bullying reported in both the secondary and primary school -&nbsp;somewhere between 20-30% - and&nbsp;that is what our own surveys tell us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;school offences model is what schools report and those are cases that involve hurting, frightening or intimidating others using power or strength.&nbsp; So, not all bullying incidents are captured in the school offences model because the school offences model captures part of what is reported by the schools. And those incidents which involve hurting, frightening or intimidating others, I would like to share that these incidents continue to be infrequent and the&nbsp;numbers have so far remained low.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:145</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, I believe I shared on the incident rates up to 2006.&nbsp; I do not have the 2007 figures with me.&nbsp; At&nbsp;some point in time when&nbsp;I am able to compile them, I will be happy to share that with the Member directly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figures that are reported in the survey represent an entire spectrum of bullying behaviours ranging from teasing being excluded to the very severe forms of bullying that I mentioned earlier.&nbsp; The findings, I believe these were from the Singapore Children Society, showed that the three most common forms of bullying are: being called&nbsp;bad&nbsp;names; not being befriended for a particular reason; and the bully telling others not to befriend the bullied.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just want to end off by saying that parents are actually very important partners not only in&nbsp;managing bullying cases&nbsp;but&nbsp;in all aspects of education.&nbsp; Our schools welcome and value the support of parents when dealing with disciplinary cases and parental support will help children, both the bully and the bullied, better learn from the experience.&nbsp; Despite the best efforts of teachers and schools and the counsellors in the schools, there will be cases of bullying that are not reported, that go unnoticed or where the victims do not show signs of being bullied.&nbsp;&nbsp;So we welcome feedback from parents.&nbsp; We welcome parents to talk to <p align=left>Column:146 </p>the teachers, to let the teachers know if the children are having some difficulty or if they have seen changes in the behaviour of the students and they think that it is because of&nbsp;incidents happening in school.&nbsp; And I think parents bringing such incidents up to the school authority, to the teachers, to the principals will help the school management&nbsp;get to the root cause of the incidents and find out what it is that&nbsp;we can do better in order to support our students in schools.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I urge parents to come forward to talk to our educators.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Deputy Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Deputy Speaker:</B> Order.&nbsp; I am&nbsp;afraid I&nbsp;must interrupt you now, Mr Lui, as the time allocated for your speech has expired.&nbsp; The time allowed for the debate has expired.<p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Question having been proposed at&nbsp;five minutes past&nbsp;Six o'clock &nbsp;pm and the Debate having continued for half an hour,&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker adjourned the House without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.</I></p><p style=\"TEXT-ALIGN: right\" align=\"right\"><br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"TEXT-ALIGN: right\" align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at<br>Twenty-Five&nbsp;Minutes&nbsp;to&nbsp;Seven o'clock pm.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\"><!--SECTION_NAME:WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT <BR>ANSWERED BY 3.00 PM--><p align=left>Column:147 </p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B><P>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT <BR>ANSWERED BY 3.00 PM</P></span></B></div>\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:GAMBLING AND PROSTITUTION ACTIVITIES IN GEYLANG AREA--><!--END_COL_TITLE:GAMBLING AND PROSTITUTION ACTIVITIES IN GEYLANG AREA:::148--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>GAMBLING AND PROSTITUTION ACTIVITIES IN GEYLANG AREA</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Police conducts daily operations and high-visibility patrols targeted at public gaming activities in the Geylang backlanes.&nbsp; This resulted in 280 persons being arrested for public-gaming related offences last year.&nbsp; As a result of these operations, Police's assessment is that the situation has improved.&nbsp; Public gaming activities are significantly less frequent and&nbsp;are smaller in scale.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, the situation in Geylang is under control.&nbsp; Police will continue to monitor the situation and press on with enforcement efforts against vice and gambling in the area.&nbsp; But I should add that it is not realistic to expect vice to be totally eliminated.&nbsp; We have an open economy and promote tourism as one key economic sector.&nbsp; More than 10 million visitors came to Singapore in 2007. &nbsp;We expect more to come in future years as new tourism products are introduced.&nbsp; Among those who come, there will be a very small number who enter under the pretext of social visits but engage in vice activities.&nbsp; This is the reality which Singaporeans should face up to.</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 147</p> \t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

and (d) whether the police works with Interpol or other agencies as these crimes often involve an element of extra-territoriality.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of online cheating cases over the past three years has remained about the same: 61 cases in 2005, also 61 cases in 2006 and 57 cases, slight drop of four cases, in 2007.&nbsp; The most common situation is where someone places a false advertisement of a product or service on the Internet to induce victims to place orders online and make electronic payment.&nbsp; The victim then realises that he has been cheated only when the goods fail to arrive.&nbsp; Other online cheating scams involve fraudulent High Yield Investment Programs (HYIP), credit card frauds, lottery scams and advance fee scams.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of cases solved in 2005, 2006 and 2007 was 29, 28 and 12 respectively, representing a ratio of about 40% of cases solved.&nbsp; The number of culprits arrested over the same three years was 22, nine and 15 respectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our strategy to combat online cheating has three key thrusts.&nbsp; First, Police works closely with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, financial institutions, and foreign law enforcement agencies including Interpol to share fraud-related intelligence and best practices.&nbsp; A framework is in place for local financial institutions to detect, monitor and report suspicious transactions.&nbsp; Under section 39 of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and other Serious Crimes Act (CDSA), it is mandatory for a person to make a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) if he has reason to suspect that any property is connected to criminal conduct, and if such suspicion arose in the course of his trade, profession, business or employment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second thrust is public education.&nbsp; Police actively engages industry stakeholders, including the media, financial institutions and remittance companies, online merchants and grassroots organisations to apprise them of common online scam scenarios and educate them on crime prevention methods.&nbsp; Police also puts out crime prevention advice on common scams through the Media, using SMS messages and through websites of the Commercial Affairs Department (http://www.cad.gov.sg) and Moneysense websites (http://www.moneysense.gov.sg).&nbsp; Crimewatch has also alerted Singaporeans not to be fooled by these scams.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we have put in place a robust legal framework to punish online scammers and deter other like-minded persons.&nbsp; Online scams constitute cheating offences and are punishable under the Penal Code with imprisonment terms of up to three years or seven years.&nbsp; An individual who knowingly facilitates online scams by allowing syndicates to use his bank account to receive proceeds of criminal conduct is also guilty of an offence under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and other Serious Crimes Act (CDSA).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key to tackling this scourge in the longer term is that the public should remain vigilant.&nbsp; They should not let their desire for quick gain get the better of them. Please do not fall prey to online cheating scams as their promises of riches or easy money are illusory.&nbsp; The public should also not allow their bank accounts or personal details to be used by online scammers.&nbsp; Any attempt by such scammers to elicit money or to use your bank accounts should be reported to the Police.</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 151</p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government adopts a three-pronged approach to keeping Singapore clean&nbsp;- public education, enforcement and public cleansing.&nbsp; We place strong emphasis on public education so that each individual takes responsibility for keeping Singapore and their living environment clean.&nbsp; At the same time, we conduct regular enforcement against litterbugs to deter irresponsible behaviour.&nbsp; NEA together with land agencies such as Town Councils, SLA and NParks also ensure that adequate cleansing services are provided in areas under their charge.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We want Singapore to be clean because each one of us takes responsibility to keep our surroundings clean, and not because we have an efficient team of cleaners.&nbsp; The recent reinstatement of the Islandwide Cleanest Estate Competition (ICEC) by the 14 PAP Town Councils has the following objectives:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Raise community awareness and promote social responsibility in keeping our living environment clean;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Promote residents' sense of ownership of the common areas; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduce obstruction and eliminate killer litter in our estates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In line with these objectives, I understand that the judging criteria of ICEC gives greater weightage to community efforts in promoting social responsibility amongst residents, than to efforts by the cleaners.</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 155</p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

To ensure that the green solutions that are being introduced are cost-effective, HDB adopts only proven and viable technologies.&nbsp; HDB carries out extensive research in collaboration with industry partners and academic institutions. &nbsp;It conducts pilot projects to test the solutions before their adoption.&nbsp; HDB takes into account not only the upfront costs, but also recurrent costs and possible economies of scale through large scale implementation.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of these green solutions include the installation of planting trays to create green roofs, and the adoption of water-saving features and energy-efficient light fittings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB has brought together many of its recent green innovations and improvements in the pilot eco-precinct project, Treelodge@Punggol, which was launched in March this year.&nbsp; If the outcome is positive, HDB will extend these innovations to other new projects in due course.&nbsp; Among the 712 premium flats in this project, 600 were four-room units which were offered at a subsidised price of between&nbsp;$210,000 and $250,000.&nbsp; At these prices, the median household with an income of about $4,000 per month can service their mortgage instalment fully with their monthly CPF Ordinary Account contributions.&nbsp; The monthly Service and Conservancy Charges for these flats will be the same as flats of the same flat types in nearby blocks, as the higher maintenance cost of some of the new features will be offset by savings in energy and utility costs.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Athlete selection is coordinated by the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC), which is a non-governmental agency affiliated to the International Olympic Committee (IOC).<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; SNOC sets the qualifying standards for the various sports to determine which local athletes would represent Singapore at the Major Games, with the exception of the Olympic Games, for which athletes are selected based on qualifying criteria set by the respective International Federations (IFs).&nbsp; For instance, the qualification mark for all sports at the 2007 SEA Games is the third place timing of the previous SEA Games, or a third placing among SEA Games athletes in the current rankings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Sports Associations (NSAs) would in turn conduct selection trials for their athletes and nominate the athletes for SNOC's consideration. &nbsp;The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) regularly reminds the NSAs to ensure that the selection trials are fair and transparent.&nbsp; After the selection trials, the NSAs will submit their nominated athletes to the SNOC.&nbsp; The SNOC Games Selection Committee will then decide on which athletes to send to the Major Games.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current system has channels for appeals at the NSA and SNOC levels.&nbsp; An athlete who is not nominated by the NSA can appeal to the NSA, which will then convene an Appeals Committee to review the case.&nbsp; As for athletes nominated by the NSAs who are not selected by the SNOC, the NSAs may submit an appeal to the SNOC Appeals Committee, which will then deliberate over the case.&nbsp; The SNOC Appeals Committee's decision is final.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the current system of appeal channels, the appealing party can also take the case to mediation, arbitration or litigation.&nbsp; In Mr Gino Ng's case, the case was brought<p align=left>Column:165</p> before the Singapore Mediation Centre.&nbsp; Both parties then reached an amicable settlement through mediation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To prevent similar disputes from taking place, SSC will work with the NSAs to professionalise their athlete selection and management processes. &nbsp;To complement the NSA Code of Governance introduced in recent years, SSC is now working with the NSAs to adopt a Code of Athlete Management (COAM), which spells out how NSAs should manage their athletes.&nbsp; The Code covers the respective roles and responsibilities of the NSAs and athletes.&nbsp; It will help the NSAs to be fair and transparent in the implementation of their programmes, and to practise meritocratic selection of athletes for major competitions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are existing channels and arrangements through which athletes can turn to should disputes arise between the athlete and their respective NSAs.&nbsp; Athletes who feel they have not been fairly treated in the selection process can turn to SSC for advice and assistance.&nbsp; The Code of Athlete Management that I have mentioned earlier would also help to safeguard our athletes' interests in selection matters.&nbsp; In addition, there is an Athletes' Commission within the SNOC that looks after athlete-related issues and their welfare.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zaqy may like to know that SSC has launched the framework for Alternative Dispute Resolution for Sports, also called ADR Sports, earlier this month.&nbsp; This initiative is developed in collaboration with SNOC, the Singapore Mediation Centre (SMC), the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) and the Singapore Institute of Arbitrators (SIArb).&nbsp; The framework will cater to a broad spectrum of issues, such as athlete selection, liability, commercial rights and so on, with the aim to resolve sports-related disputes in a timely and professional manner.</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 165</p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

\"Good Samaritan\" laws, adopted in other countries, broadly take two different forms.&nbsp; In some countries, such laws are intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to render assistance because of significant liability concerns.&nbsp; In British Columbia (Canada) and Victoria (Australia), for example, laws have been enacted to grant statutory immunity from legal liability to persons who gratuitously offer aid to those who are injured or ill, for example, in an emergency situation.&nbsp; Other jurisdictions have a more aggressive approach.&nbsp; In Vermont (USA) and Rhode Island (USA), for example, \"Good Samaritan\" laws prescribe a positive legal requirement for citizens to assist people in distress, unless by so doing they would put themselves in danger.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, in contrast to the US, there are no major liability concerns for helpful bystanders.&nbsp; Our laws strike the correct balance.&nbsp; With regard to civil liability, in law, the person who offers assistance need only comply with what is expected of a person of his skills and experience. &nbsp;An untrained person, for example, would not be held to the standard of a qualified doctor.&nbsp; A person who has acted reasonably and exercised due care would generally not be liable.&nbsp; As for criminal liability, that is generally premised upon the intent to cause harm or injury.&nbsp; A person who has acted reasonably and in good faith is unlikely to be held criminally liable.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, therefore, our law does not impede bystanders taking action to assist.&nbsp; Nor have we encountered reluctance on the part of our citizens to do so.&nbsp; There have not been reported incidents where persons ought to have come forward in emergency situations but did not, either because of legal consequences or a lack of civic responsibility.&nbsp; There is thus no urgency at present to adjust the finely tuned framework that we have in place.&nbsp; However we will review the matter if the need arises.</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 169</p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Under the Fire Code, every storey of residential and commercial buildings is to be served by at least two independent exit staircases.&nbsp; However, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) may consider waiver applications for residential buildings and allow the provision of one exit staircase if the following conditions are met:<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;the building height does not exceed 60 metres;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) &nbsp;the single exit staircase does not serve more than four apartments or maisonettes per floor;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;the travel distance from the main front door from each apartment or maisonette to the exit staircase does not exceed 15 metres;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;the approach to the existing staircase is through a cross-ventilated lobby;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;a fire lift and dry rising mains (which draws high pressured water to every storey for fire fighting purpose) are provided; and</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (f) &nbsp;there is access to the building for fire fighting appliances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, there are existing buildings that do not meet the minimum requirement of two independent exit staircases for each storey.&nbsp; For example, HUDC or HDB point-block apartments exceeding 22 storeys (60 metres) have only one exit staircase.&nbsp; These buildings were exempted from obtaining approval from the Building Authority when they were built in the 1970s and 1980s.&nbsp; As part of HDB's ongoing Specific Works Programme and Main Upgrading Programme, some of these buildings have undergone improvement works to enhance fire safety, eg, the installation of fire fighting facilities, such as dry rising mains, installation of fire lifts, provision of fire engine space to allow immediate fire fighting and rescue operations from the outside of the building, and installation of half-hour fire rated doors at each apartment's main entrance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SCDF will continue to work with HDB and other relevant agencies to ensure that such older buildings with one exit staircase meet the prevailing fire safety requirements when they undergo major renovation or upgrading works.</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 171</p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In the RIMP, the operators have set out relevant plans and procedures covering areas such as service recovery, provision of alternative transport, such as bus bridging, crowd control and public communications.&nbsp; In addition, the operators have developed Standing Operating Procedures (SOP) in anticipation of specific scenarios that may arise.&nbsp; All relevant staff receive training on the RIMP and SOP.&nbsp; The operators also carry out regular exercises on their own as well as jointly with relevant agencies such as the Singapore Civil Defence Force and LTA.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LTA also has its SOP for dealing with rail incidents.&nbsp; Regular training and exercises are conducted to ensure that LTA staff work seamlessly with the operators and other relevant authorities to ensure the prompt recovery of rail services.</p></p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;
