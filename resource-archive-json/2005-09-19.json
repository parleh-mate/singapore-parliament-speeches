BCA and HDB&nbsp;trained additional window contractors and linked them up with home-owners.&nbsp; Town Councils and Management Corporations were also roped in to help coordinate the window retrofitting exercise in their estates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The response from residents has been encouraging.&nbsp; To date, the vast majority, or about 94%, of households required to retrofit their windows have already done so.&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo asked whether the deadline for retrofitting would be extended when it expires on 30th September this year.&nbsp; My Ministry will not be extending the deadline.&nbsp; It is not in the interest of public safety to do so.&nbsp; The grace period of one year has been more than adequate.&nbsp; The vast majority has had no problem complying.&nbsp; The small minority who has not yet done so will be given additional help to do so.&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor asked for a breakdown of these residents.&nbsp; To-date, about 12,000 units have not yet fixed their windows. Of these, 4,000 are HDB units and 8,000 are private units.&nbsp; They constitute about 3% of 150,000 HDB flats with casement windows that need to be retrofitted and about 20% of private flats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Khor also asked what additional measures would be taken to help those who have not retrofitted their windows.&nbsp; HDB and BCA have increased the number of hotlines that home-owners can call to seek assistance, and deployed more staff to tend to queries.&nbsp; They have also appointed more window contractors to meet the increase in demand.&nbsp; Home-owners who need assistance can call the HDB or BCA hotline for help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1301<p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BCA and HDB have also taken stern actions against errant contractors who tried to take advantage of the current situation. Errant contractors who are found to be involved in malpractices like over-charging, providing misleading information or rendering poor service, would be fined or debarred from HDB contracting works.&nbsp; So far, HDB has taken action against 49 contractors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Khor asked about the implications for flat owners who are unable to retrofit their window rivets by the deadline.&nbsp; With the stepped up efforts by HDB and BCA, I expect that virtually all home-owners will be able to meet the deadline.&nbsp; Those who still have problems retrofitting their windows should contact HDB or BCA for advice and assistance immediately.&nbsp; After the deadline, BCA will take action under the window retrofitting order against home-owners who do not have valid reasons for not fixing their affected windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I remind all flat-owners that this exercise is to save lives.

Where such assistance is not available, it will also be prepared to do the retrofitting exercise and collect the payment on an instalment basis.&nbsp; It has also come to my notice that some contractors have, for the very poor cases, been carrying out this retrofitting exercise either on a complimentary basis or on an instalment basis.&nbsp; So there are several avenues available for such financial cases to be assisted.&nbsp; But I must stress that these are, by and large, in a minority.&nbsp; I think the number of cases that have come to our attention has not been significant. Where they have genuine difficulties, they have been given assistance of one form or another.&nbsp; I do not think this is the main issue.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> Sir, may I ask the Minister how he intends to enforce this ruling on the change of window rivets?&nbsp; Is he going to have random checks on private apartments and HDB flats?&nbsp; Would he be lenient to those with good reasons for not being able to meet the target deadline?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I also ask the Minister how is he addressing the complaints about some HDB-recommended contractors who over-<p align=left>Column: 1303<p>service beyond requirements, some who overcharge, and some disappear after collecting the deposits?&nbsp; How many of such complaints has his Ministry received?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B>&nbsp; There have been complaints about errant contractors and they are the culprits who either overcharge or run away with the money.&nbsp; Each and every complaint is investigated and, so far, HDB has taken action against 49 contractors.&nbsp; However, a lot of the complaints have been found to be due to misunderstanding on the part of the contractors as well as the home-owners.&nbsp; For example, some of the contractors, having inspected the windows, found that the windows needed repairs other than changing of the rivets.&nbsp; In those cases, they recommended additional works to be done and of course these additional works cost money.&nbsp; Because there was a misunderstanding as to what needed to be done, home-owners may have thought&nbsp; that they were being overcharged.&nbsp; All those misunderstandings have been clarified to the satisfaction of both parties.&nbsp; So I do not think we need to worry about that.&nbsp; But I do admit that there are contractors who have tried to take advantage of the situation.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also know of contractors, through their own volition, who have given either free service or allowed instalment payments.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where there are cases of contractors taking advantage of the situation and where we can prove it, we will either fine them or debar them from the contractors registry system under HDB.&nbsp; If there are any complaints of this nature, residents can always call up the hotline and they will be investigated.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first question pertains to enforcement.&nbsp; BCA can either enforce it through the window retrofitting order or the Building Maintenance Act.&nbsp; But that is <p align=left>Column: 1304<p>not the point.&nbsp; The more serious point is that we want everybody to have a sense of urgency to change or check their windows and to make sure they do not fall down.&nbsp; It is not possible for BCA to go round checking every single house which has not complied.&nbsp; If they want to do it at the end of the period, they will reserve the option to do so.&nbsp; But what is more serious, and this is where I would like to urge all home-owners to be aware, is that when a window falls down after that date, they can be subject to severe penalties.&nbsp; Although there were one or two cases in the past where the windows had fallen down, after investigations, BCA and HDB had not taken action against the owners.&nbsp; But after 30th September, if such an incident happens, depending on the investigations, home-owners may be subject to far more severe penalties.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My advice is, first of all, get your&nbsp;windows fixed and, even after that, check your windows regularly.

One of the common complaints is that the contractors are all busy and, therefore, they cannot meet the deadline.&nbsp; There are over 600 contractors registered by BCA.&nbsp; There are another 24 which are term contractors specifically designated by HDB.&nbsp; There are other term contractors which have been appointed by Town Councils.&nbsp; The total capacity of all these contractors is more than 20,000 windows a month.&nbsp; This is more than adequate to meet the demand of those who have not yet submitted their requests for retrofitting.&nbsp; It is only those who are either not aware or those who have real financial difficulties.&nbsp; I think these are the cases that are left and for them, as I said, HDB is prepared to work with the Town Councils to identify cases and to see what assistance can be rendered to them, including advising them on what needs to be done.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It is something akin to the LUP scheme where we have actually given financial assistance for&nbsp;needy residents.&nbsp; This will make it more transparent and a lot easier for the different constituencies to deal with residents who need financial assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other question that I would like to ask the Minister is with regard to people who are not able to get contractors to retrofit the windows by the deadline.&nbsp; Could the Ministry coordinate and release names of contractors who are able to <p align=left>Column: 1307<p>render the service and meet the deadline, because the feedback from residents is that they have made umpteen calls to many contractors and most, if not all, actually said that they could not meet the deadline and can only do it after September?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B>&nbsp; Sir, I will look into the Member's suggestion about the financial assistance scheme, but please rest assured that those who need financial help will be able to find them somehow or other, including from the branch office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards residents not being able to get contractors to meet the deadline, I have indicated that there is a list of 600 contractors.&nbsp; If Members look at the HDB's website, they will be able to see that each zone has easily got 20-30 or more contractors whose order books are still not full and who are able to take new jobs.&nbsp; It is only a matter of taking the trouble to look for them.&nbsp; But even after all this, if they still have difficulty, they can call up the HDB hotline.&nbsp; Or if they go to the Town Council office, they have got a whole list of other names that they can call.&nbsp; So it is not a matter of contractors not being available.&nbsp; It is a matter of trying.&nbsp; I think this is really something that we need to instil in our residents as well&nbsp; -&nbsp; a sense of urgency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This accident is something that can happen.&nbsp; We do not want it to happen, but it can happen and it can happen to any household.&nbsp; And if it does happen, the consequences can be very serious.&nbsp; We are very fortunate that so far nobody has been seriously hurt or even killed.&nbsp; But imagine a full window falling down from 10-20 storeys and hitting somebody.&nbsp; For us to quibble about not getting contractors without making the effort, I think it does not do justice to the serious consequences of such a thing happening.&nbsp; So I would urge everybody to please make the effort.&nbsp; If they are really not able to <p align=left>Column: 1308<p>pay, we will find a way to help them.&nbsp; And for those who really do not know what is happening, there are enough people on the ground going around who are able to help them and provide information to them.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I think there is no excuse - other than for these two groups - for anybody to say that there are not enough contractors around or that they are not able to do it on time.&nbsp; We have given them 12 months.&nbsp; For the last 11 months, all the contractors have been doing work on a steady basis, and most home-owners have complied.&nbsp; So for the rest who still have not done it, please make the effort.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:HOCK KEE HOUSE--><p align=left>Column: 1308<p>\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Transport (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</B> First, let me assure Members that the Government decided to acquire Hock Kee House in August&nbsp;this year&nbsp;after careful and extensive monitoring and review, and only after all other options were found to be not feasible.&nbsp; Let me explain why the decision to acquire Hock Kee House could not have been taken any earlier.&nbsp; I will also explain the reason for the short notice, namely, to minimise further delay to the construction of the Circle Line.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LTA learnt in 2003 that Hock Kee House was built on footings and not on piles.&nbsp; The professional assessment then was that while the building would likely experience some cracks, its stability <p align=left>Column: 1309<p>would not be affected and that the building could be preserved despite the deep excavation works.&nbsp; There was therefore no basis to acquire Hock Kee House in 2003.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, LTA closely monitored the situation and the condition of the building.&nbsp; It also&nbsp;strengthened the design of the temporary works for the Circle Line construction in order to reduce the settlement of the building during the excavation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In April last year, after the Nicoll Highway incident, excavation works next to Hock Kee House was temporarily suspended.&nbsp; Despite this, Hock Kee House continued to settle.&nbsp; By late last year, it had become clear to LTA that more had to be done to ensure that Hock Kee House could withstand the further ground movement that was likely to occur when deep excavation resumed.&nbsp; LTA then engaged two separate and independent engineering consultants to review the situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The consultants in their reports of March 2005 and July 2005 respectively concluded that Hock Kee House would be unsafe once deep excavation works resumed.&nbsp; Moreover, any strengthening works, such as underpinning the building, may, on the contrary, de-stabilise it.&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, it was not possible to strengthen Hock Kee House effectively.&nbsp; LTA then explored other possible solutions, eg, re-aligning the Circle Line, but found that these were also not feasible.&nbsp; Finally, after monitoring the situation and exploring alternatives for close to a year, the Government concluded that it had no choice but to acquire and demolish Hock Kee House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acquisition is a last resort.&nbsp; Only when ground conditions and extensive studies showed conclusively that there were no alternative solutions did the Government finally decide to acquire and demolish Hock Kee House so that construction of the Circle Line could proceed safely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1310<p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LTA had to strike a difficult balance between giving the occupants and owners adequate time to move out, and minimising further delays to the Circle Line works.&nbsp; LTA was mindful that the larger public interest was to bring the Circle Line into operation as soon as possible.&nbsp; It therefore decided to acquire the building sooner rather than later, and to give special assistance to the residents who would be inconvenienced by the short notice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LTA has put together a special financial assistance package&nbsp; over and above the normal compensation for land acquisition to assist owners and occupants in&nbsp;relocating quickly. Most of the owners have also been given ex-gratia compensation, on top of the statutory compensation. LTA has also worked with the HDB and the Singapore Land Authority to assist those who need alternative housing and business premises.&nbsp; To date, 34 out of 35 unit owners have indicated that they would move out by the deadline of 3rd October and, in fact, so far, occupants from 12 units have already moved out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We appreciate that because of the short notice to move out, the occupants of Hock Kee House have been put to a fair amount of inconvenience.&nbsp; We sincerely apologise for this.&nbsp; We are very grateful that the occupants have cooperated with the different Government agencies so that Hock Kee House can be demolished, and the construction of the Circle Line can resume as soon as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade)</B>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am happy to note that the LTA and the Ministry have worked to help the residents.&nbsp; Many of them have seen me.&nbsp; Some of them are not happy with the compensation.

This has more than offset the drag on domestic activities arising from higher energy costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The latest oil price spike, however, reflects a substantial supply disruption in the US caused by the hurricane Katrina.&nbsp; Higher oil prices and the interruption to economic activities caused by the hurricane are forecast to lower US GDP growth by as much as one percentage point in the second half of 2005.&nbsp; However, this negative impact of Katrina is expected to be transient. The US economic growth momentum should recover in early 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higher oil prices and the slowdown in the US will also affect the Singapore economy negatively.&nbsp; The drag on economic growth comes mainly from slower growth of Singapore's exports, accentuated by the direct impact of higher oil prices on domestic demand.&nbsp; However, economic growth for the rest of this year should remain positive.&nbsp; At this point, we continue to expect GDP growth in 2005 to be within the forecast range of 3.5% to 4.5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With continuing economic growth, employment should register further gains in the near term.&nbsp; Some businesses may adopt a wait-and-see attitude and hold back on expansion until the current <p align=left>Column: 1315<p>uncertainties ease.&nbsp; But, overall, with rising demand, most employers will continue to add head count.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for households, the increase in the consumer price index (CPI) has been limited, despite the surge in international crude oil prices. Between December 2003 and July this year, the CPI had risen by 1.6%. While the cost of fuel and utilities had risen 10.6% over the period, prices of other consumer items had shown much smaller increases or had declined.&nbsp; Food and public transport costs, for example, rose by 2.7% and 1.6% respectively.&nbsp; But prices of household durables, clothing and footwear were among items showing declines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On utility rebates, the Prime Minister had included in his Budget speech in February this year the topping up of the utility accounts of households under the Utilities Save (U-Save) Scheme.&nbsp; The first instalment of the rebate was recently given out in July 2005.&nbsp; The second instalment will be given out in January 2006.&nbsp; Singaporeans should be extra careful in their use of fuel and electricity in this period of high oil prices.&nbsp; Separately, needy Singaporeans who require extra help can also turn to the various existing help schemes like the ComCare Fund programmes and Re-employment Assistance Programme.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:ARREARS IN UTILITIES BILLS AND PAY-AS-YOU-USE METERING SCHEME--><p align=left>Column: 1315<p>\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>ARREARS IN UTILITIES BILLS AND PAY-AS-YOU-USE METERING SCHEME</span></B></div><BR>\r\n\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob</B> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how many households in Singapore are in arrears of their utilities bill; (b) what is the average bill size; (c) how many Singaporeans had the pay-as-you-use electricity metering scheme installed in their homes after this scheme was introduced; and (d) how many continue to <p align=left>Column: 1316<p>have their utilities cut off despite the installation of this meter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B>&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as of end July 2005, 7,340 utility accounts are in arrears, or 0.68% of the total number of accounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The average utilities bill size varies based on the consumption for different household sizes.

It enables such households to have their supply reconnected, while allowing them to settle their arrears over time. As of end July, 1,054 households in arrears have joined the PAYU metering scheme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With pre-paid meters, PAYU customers can check their credit balance and better manage their electricity consumption. There is an emergency credit of $3 that they can tap into when the credit falls below $1. This allows the customer time to top up his credit and avoid disruption in electricity supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the number of PAYU customers who get their electricity supply cut off despite having PAYU, I am afraid this information is not readily available, as it depends on whether and when PAYU customers top up&nbsp;the necessary credit in their cards.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:CLOSURE OF TAN TOCK SENG HOSPITAL'S A&E DEPARTMENT AND BED SITUATION IN PUBLIC HOSPITALS--><p align=left>Column: 1316<p>\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</B>&nbsp; Dr Tan Sze Wee asked a number of questions related to <p align=left>Column: 1318<p>the bed situation in public hospitals, including admissions and length of stay, the closure of Tan Tock Seng Hospital's (TTSH) Emergency Department and the handling of chickenpox cases.&nbsp; Let me address these in turn.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Hospital Admissions</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Singapore is a small city-state, there are demographic differences in the patients seen by the different public hospitals.&nbsp; Different hospitals see different types and ages of patients, have different medical departments, and treat different ratios of non-elective to elective cases.&nbsp; For example, in 2004, the median age of Tan Tock Seng Hospital's&nbsp;patients was 59 years, compared with 55 years in Singapore General Hospital (SGH), 52 years in Alexandra Hospital (AH) and 51 years in Changi General Hospital (CGH).&nbsp; The median age is 44 years for National University Hospital (NUH), partly due to its pediatric service.&nbsp; As another example, TTSH sees more rehabilitative medicine patients than other hospitals.&nbsp; In 2004, it treated 3,367 such patients, while CGH had the second highest volume of 510 such patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The average length of stay in a hospital is therefore determined by a range of supply and demand factors, such as the demographics of the surrounding population, the conditions treated by the hospital, and the availability of step-down or alternative care services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically, since 2000 when the average length of stay for public hospitals was 5.9 days, there has been a gradual decrease in this figure.&nbsp; The average length of stay in public hospitals for the period from January to June 2005, across all disciplines, was 5.6 days.&nbsp; NUH had the shortest average length of stay of 4.9 days, while TTSH had the longest length of 7.0 days.&nbsp; By discipline, the average lengths of stay for geriatric and rehabilitative medicine from January to <p align=left>Column: 1319<p>June 2005 were 9.4 and 19.7 days respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The total number of patient admissions in acute care public hospitals increased slightly over five years, from 297,000 in 2000 to 303,590 in 2004.&nbsp; The figure from January to June 2005 was 150,290.&nbsp; The number of admissions varies depending on each hospital's capacity.&nbsp; For the first half of 2005, AH with the fewest beds had 10,530 admissions, while SGH with the most beds had 34,870 admissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These statistics show the comparative situation in our hospitals.&nbsp; What is more important, however, is for each hospital to continue to ensure that their patients get appropriate medical treatment.&nbsp; If a patient needs to stay longer than the average length of stay in order to receive proper medical care, his doctor must ensure that he stays.&nbsp; While we monitor the length of stay in order to make&nbsp;hospital operations more efficient and more effective, we must also be careful not to make statistical data more important than the quality of care that patients receive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Closure of TTSH's Emergency Department</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Emergency Department is one of several units in a hospital.&nbsp; The number of cases that can be treated by the Emergency Department varies, depending on the situation in the other units.&nbsp; For example, if there are a large number of dengue cases taking up many beds, then the Emergency Department's capacity to manage cases will be affected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between January and August 2005, TTSH's Emergency Department was closed about 9% of the total operating time.&nbsp; In 2004, similar closures at TTSH comprised 1% of total operating time.&nbsp; During such times, ambulance cases are <p align=left>Column: 1320<p>sent to the nearest hospital which can confirm it has available capacity.&nbsp; However, the most critical cases are still admitted even if closure is declared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The declaration of \"full house\" at TTSH's Emergency Department is not something that is done lightly, since it has a knock-on effect on the operations of other hospitals.&nbsp; We will continue to closely monitor the situation across hospitals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Chickenpox and dengue fever</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past, chickenpox patients were typically admitted to the Communicable Disease Centre (CDC).&nbsp; If a patient's choice of ward class was unavailable at CDC, he would be warded at TTSH.&nbsp; The number of chickenpox cases admitted to TTSH and CDC in the first half of 2005 was about 100 cases a month, while there were about 50 cases a month in 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as chickenpox is a relatively mild disease that can be managed outside a hospital setting, TTSH and CDC have since July 2005 only admitted patients with chickenpox if there is a medical indication for hospitalisation.&nbsp; In August 2005, only eight such cases were admitted.&nbsp; Patients with chickenpox are no longer admitted for the purpose of isolation.&nbsp; My Ministry is monitoring the situation and has not detected any public health impact arising from the revised admissions policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minister Yaacob Ibrahim will be addressing this House on the national strategy for tackling dengue.&nbsp; So I will just respond to Dr Tan's specific question here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of hospitalisations for dengue fever has increased since May 2005, corresponding to the increase in the number of notifications of dengue fever.&nbsp; In May 2005, the utilisation of bed <p align=left>Column: 1321<p>days for patients with dengue fever at public hospitals ranged from 0.8% at NUH to 2.7% at TTSH/CDC.&nbsp; By August 2005, dengue has taken up 6% of available bed days in TTSH/CDC, AH and CGH, and around 3% for NUH and SGH.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister for Health had during an earlier session addressed this House on the issue of hospital capacity.&nbsp; The Ministry will continue to undertake immediate and longer-term measures, to ensure that there is adequate capacity in public hospitals and that no patient will be denied access to medical care.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

<B>Dr Tan Sze Wee (Nominated Member):</B>&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Senior Minister of State for providing the answer to my question.&nbsp; However, I was asking the question&nbsp;because of the reply that was made in the previous sitting regarding the capacity of the beds in Tan Tock Seng Hospital resulting in the A&amp;E situation.&nbsp; I find a bit startling to realise that, based on&nbsp;his reply, for the period&nbsp;2005, Tan Tock Seng A&amp;E has actually closed down about 9% of the time which, on an annualised basis, amounts to about one month per year which is quite alarming, compared to last year which was only 1%.&nbsp; Perhaps,&nbsp;he may wish to&nbsp;clarify that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second&nbsp;point is that with&nbsp;the rest of the other questions I have on A&amp;E, what is the&nbsp;knock-on effect on the other hospitals' A&amp;E workload, as a result of Tan Tock Seng A&amp;E closing down?&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the patient waiting time in the rest of the acute hospitals that have A&amp;E services that were being overflowed now as a result of Tan Tock Seng A&amp;E being closed down.&nbsp; The additional questions are actually relating to length of stay.&nbsp; What I have asked for is the average length of stay for rehabilitative&nbsp;and geriatric patients in Tan Tock Seng Hospital and across the other public hospitals which the Senior Minister of State has actually provided.&nbsp; However, what the Senior Minister of State has not <p align=left>Column: 1322<p>provided&nbsp;is&nbsp;the average length of stay of rehabilitative and geriatric patients in the other hospitals as well.&nbsp; We note that the average length of stay has a bearing on ---</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Tan Sze Wee:</B>&nbsp; The question I wanted to ask is that, for the average length of stay, the Senior Minister of State has actually accounted that by age alone because Tan Tock Seng Hospital&nbsp;has a high rate of&nbsp;patients.&nbsp; But if you account&nbsp;by the age itself,&nbsp;Tan Tock Seng Hospital could, in terms of efficiency or turning round the patient,&nbsp;look at it as well.&nbsp; So perhaps one of the factors, besides providing the building of&nbsp;hospital beds because the length of stay has a bearing on the hospital bill, is that the length of stay should be&nbsp;looked at as one of the performance indicators of hospitals as well.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Balaji Sadasivan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</B>&nbsp; First of all, I would like to explain that the reason why the percentage of time it has been closed has increased is&nbsp;due to the larger number of cases that the Emergency Department has been seeing because of dengue, and that certainly has a knock-on effect on all the hospitals which is why tackling the dengue outbreak is very, very important.&nbsp; But in the meantime, we have formed an expert committee to look at the problem of admission of dengue patients to all the hospitals as well as the Emergency Department to see if our resources could be used more efficiently so that the closure will be less frequent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the length of stay, it is more than just the age that differentiates the hospitals.&nbsp; The type of patients&nbsp;is also different.&nbsp; For example, Tan Tock Seng Hospital sees a disproportionate number of stroke patients for rehabilitation as opposed to rehabilitation for other causes, and hence there can be a &nbsp;disparity in the <p align=left>Column: 1323<p>length of stay for rehabilitative patients.&nbsp; Specifically, for example, in NUH, rehabilitation medicine patients stay an average of seven days, whereas in Changi Hospital, it is 22 days, and Tan Tock Seng Hospital, it is 33 days, and a large part of this difference is because of the different types of patients.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:RETIREMENT AGE ACT--><p align=left>Column: 1323<p>\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower (Mr Hawazi Daipi) (for the Minister for Manpower)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, the Member asked if raising the retirement age has had any impact on the employment of older workers. To address the Member's specific query, let me first describe the changes observed for the labour force participation rate (LFPR) for older residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The labour force participation rate&nbsp;of older workers aged 55 and above has increased and shown an upward trend since 1993, when the Retirement Age Act was extended. The increase was greater for females than for males.&nbsp; Let me ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute some <p align=left>Column: 1324<p>tables to Members.&nbsp; Sir, for females, the labour force participation rate&nbsp;has also increased&nbsp;for younger cohorts so the reasons for increases are more likely to be due to improving educational and changing societal norms. Against this underlying uptrend, the impact of extending the retirement age is harder to isolate for females.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For males, a smaller increase was noted for those aged 55&nbsp;to 59. Prior to 1993, the rate hovered around 71% but increased to 77% in 1996. In 2004, it was 78%. LFPR increases for those aged 60 to 64 have been smaller for both sexes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM's assessment is that extending the retirement age had some effects on the LFPR for older males, but the increases were limited. Thus, legislation itself would not be sufficient in raising the participation rate of older workers. Indeed, if other issues related to employability of older workers are not addressed holistically, the re-employment rate of older workers may worsen as employers may be fearful of keeping such employees till retirement. We therefore need to examine other fundamental issues related to their employment and&nbsp;employability, including the mindsets of both employers and older workers themselves; cost considerations related to remuneration and benefits; job opportunities and work processes. The Tripartite Committee on Employability of Older Workers is currently studying how to enhance the employability of older workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the introduction of the RAA in 1993, MOM has received an average of five complaints a year, alleging unlawful dismissals on ground of age.&nbsp; We have investigated all these allegations and complaints.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the cases were resolved amicably through conciliation, with some cases being withdrawn as their claims were unsubstantiated.&nbsp; Over the 12 years since the RAA was established,<p align=left>Column: 1325<p> there has been only one case in which an order for compensation by the employer was made, and another&nbsp;case where the company was ordered to reinstate the worker.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:DEPENDANTS' PROTECTION SCHEME--><p align=left>Column: 1325<p>\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>DEPENDANTS' PROTECTION SCHEME</span></B></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Extension of coverage-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Extension of coverage)</span></B></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.&nbsp; <B>Dr Ong Seh Hong</B> asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the rationale for the Dependants' Protection Scheme (DPS) to be set at 60 years only, given that the retirement age in Singapore is at 62 years and (b) whether his Ministry will consider extending the DPS coverage to be in line with the official retirement age, be it 62 years or more.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hawazi Daipi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Hawazi Daipi (for the Minister for Manpower):</B>&nbsp; Sir, the Dependants' Protection Scheme, which is an opt-out scheme, was targeted at younger members and their families in the event of the member's death or permanent incapacity. Such families are likely to have less savings to fall back on. Keeping the age limit lower, currently at 60, has also kept premiums affordable and ensured a high participation rate of 1.64 million members. Premiums now range from $36 for members aged 30 and $260 for those aged 55 years, with a sum assured of $46,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong has asked if the age limit could be extended. This is possible and indeed we did raise the age limit from 55 to 60 years in 1995. But actuarial studies showed that we would have to charge significantly higher annual premiums if we raise the age limit further and this may increase the opt-out rate. So while we want to serve especially the older workers and their families, we may not be actually serving them if we raise the coverage of the insurance scheme.&nbsp; In addition, CPF members, beyond the age of 60, would likely have dependants who are older and economically active, and have less need for protection. It may also result in <p align=left>Column: 1326<p>adverse selection as members who are less healthy and therefore in greater need for&nbsp;protection would continue with DPS while those who do not need it will opt out. Over time, this adverse selection would result in higher claims payout and further increase the premiums for older members who are insured. Older members may not be able to afford higher premiums and protection would lapse when they default on payments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CPF members who would like to have extended insurance coverage can do so by buying insurance schemes using their own cash. CPF members can also use 100% of their CPF Ordinary and Special Account savings to purchase approved investment-linked insurance policies under the CPF Investment Scheme to cover themselves up to the age of 62.&nbsp; For these reasons, CPF Board kept the age limit at 60 when it privatised the DPS.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In his answer to an earlier question, he said that we&nbsp;need a holistic approach when&nbsp;we want to raise the retirement age, and in PM's National Day Rally speech, he also mentioned that there is a need to change the mindset of the workers as well as the employers.&nbsp; I think the Government also has to change the mindset and&nbsp;be more flexible.&nbsp; If there is a need to raise the premium,&nbsp;they&nbsp;can still tier it so that if you want to extend it beyond 60,&nbsp;they can raise the premium and for those who want to opt out, they can opt out.&nbsp;

We must&nbsp;realise if we extend&nbsp;the coverage to the older age group, the premium will increase, including for the current oldest age group that is 55 to 59.&nbsp; Even, currently,&nbsp;we find that&nbsp;for the older workers, the rate of participation in the DPS is much lower than that for the younger age group.&nbsp; So if we&nbsp;extend the coverage and therefore increase the premium, it is likely that the&nbsp;proportion of older workers covered would be much lower.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In comparison, for age group 55 and above, the percentage of membership covered is only 6%.&nbsp; This illustrates the fact that when&nbsp;premium&nbsp;rises with age, older workers&nbsp;find it expensive and thus opt out.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

He mentioned that workers can use their CPF savings to buy investment-linked protection, but those can cover only up to 2.5 times the premium.&nbsp; The lower income workers are unlikely to have high savings in their CPF account because, if I remember correctly, investment-linked insurance policy is only up to 2.5 times.&nbsp;

What we are trying to say is, because this is a mass insurance scheme for workers, the cost is kept low and we want to maintain the low cost so that as many workers as possible can enjoy the scheme.&nbsp; It is simple logic.&nbsp; But what we want to do - and I would like to stress this - is that this scheme helps as many workers as possible who can afford it and we want to make it affordable.&nbsp; Members can, of course, take their own additional insurance protection.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Loo Choon Yong (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

If the Dependants' Protection Scheme is good for up to 60 years and people can opt out of it, what is the difficulty of extending for two more years, if we want elderly workers to continue to work?&nbsp;

Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, based on the Census of Population of 2000, there were 17,200 households headed by single parents below the age of 50 with at least one dependent child aged 16 years and below. &nbsp;Out of this total, there were 3,300 male single-parent households and 13,900 female single-parent households.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Public Assistance Scheme is meant for those who are unable to work due to old age, illness or disability, have no means of subsistence, and have no one to depend on.&nbsp; As of 31st August 2005, there were 33 single-parent households under the age of 50, receiving help under the PA Scheme.&nbsp; Of these, 11 of them were male single parents and 22 female single parents.&nbsp; As of 31st August 2005, we also assisted another 2,450 households with single parents under the age of 50, with the various Government social assistance schemes.&nbsp;

In the case of judo, the Singapore Judo Federation (SJF) makes the nominations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SJF bases its selection criteria on several key factors, such as participation in local and international competitions, regular attendance at national team training, and the athlete's commitment to the sport.&nbsp; Whether the athlete is a member of an SJF-affiliated judo club or not is one of the factors that is also taken into account, as the judo clubs help to ensure a certain acceptable minimum standard of training and performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Melvynna Tambunan, at 24, is a four-time national Under-57 kg champion.&nbsp; I understand from the SJF that Melvynna was not selected for the national team for the upcoming SEA Games because she only made herself available to participate in one of the two stipulated international competitions.&nbsp; This was inadequate for the Federation's coaches to sufficiently assess her performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Melvynna did not attend the national team's training sessions regularly in spite of having clearly been told to do so.&nbsp; Her non-selection was not due to her not being a member of a judo club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope Melvynna will not be too disheartened but rather continue to train hard and perform well in competitions.&nbsp;

It is now recognised, not just in Singapore, but all over the world, that the&nbsp;life sciences are opening up new&nbsp;economic opportunities and will have a major impact on human society in the 21st century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But while there has been increasing interest in the life sciences, the number of students pursuing engineering-related <p align=left>Column: 1341<p>disciplines or the physical sciences remains substantial.&nbsp; If we look at the candidature for&nbsp;the 'O' levels, for instance, the number of students at the&nbsp;'O'&nbsp;levels taking Biology and Chemistry has increased in recent years, to 30% for Biology and&nbsp;43% for Chemistry in 2004. But the&nbsp;'O' level Physics candidature has also increased, to 42% of all 'O' levels candidates. I should also mention that more than half of our students take combined Sciences at the 'O' levels and about 90% of students who take Combined Sciences take Physics in combination with either Biology or Chemistry.&nbsp; So Physics is very much alive in our secondary schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, while at the 'A' levels, Biology and Chemistry candidature has grown to 26% and 65% respectively, 'A' level Physics candidature remains a significant 60% of all&nbsp; candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The picture is similar at the tertiary level.&nbsp; ITE's Biochemical Technology course, which is its only life sciences related course, had an intake of 160 students in 2005, which is 1.3% of ITE's annual planned intake of 12,000.&nbsp; More than 50% of ITE students take engineering-related courses. At the polytechnics, about 2,200 students signed up for chemical and life sciences courses in 2005,&nbsp;compared with 4,800&nbsp;students taking up engineering&nbsp;courses in 2005.&nbsp; For NUS and NTU, about 850 students entered life sciences&nbsp; courses in 2005, compared with about 4,400 students in engineering and nearly 600 students in the physical sciences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans have been and will remain pragmatic. Ultimately, it is the availability of jobs and perceptions of career prospects that will determine the popularity of various courses.&nbsp;But no one can know, with any certainty, exactly what types of skills and knowledge will be demanded in future. Therefore, our educational institutions&nbsp;avoid making large bets on the future, or moving well ahead <p align=left>Column: 1342<p>of the job market. Their pattern of intake of students into different disciplines reflects current economic opportunities as well as the future demands that&nbsp;can already be anticipated by industries.&nbsp; It is based on industry feedback.&nbsp; The tertiary institutions also seek&nbsp;to ensure a good spread of talent across all&nbsp;the key disciplines.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the school level, we provide a foundation of learning across a broad base of subjects, to give our students greater flexibility to further their studies in different areas.&nbsp; At the post-secondary educational institutions, some specialisation and ---</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.00 pm</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Deputy Speaker</B>:&nbsp; Order.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B> Sir, despite our high standards of public health, Singapore is experiencing its worst ever outbreak of dengue fever, at least since the 1980s. As at 17th September this year, the number of dengue cases has reached a high of 10,237, including 318 Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) cases. There were 697 dengue cases in the week ending 17th September, a new peak. To date,&nbsp;eight people have died from dengue fever and DHF this year, the same figure as the whole of last year.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last two years, in response to the dengue threat, the National<p align=left>Column: 1343<p> Environment Agency has stepped up its efforts to control breeding of the Aedes mosquito which transmits the disease. NEA stepped up its inspection programme from about 55,000 inspections a month last year to about 59,000 inspections a month this year. It also beefed up its manpower resources. By the end of September, NEA will have a total of 510 personnel for dengue operations, more than four times the manpower last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Efforts by the community have also played a significant role in preventing mosquito breeding. In April 2004, NEA launched the Mozzie Attack programme in partnership with grassroots organisations and CDCs. By June 2005, all 84 CCCs had their own Mozzie Attack programmes. And the number of dengue prevention volunteers under the Mozzie Attack Programme has doubled to 4,000 this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these collective efforts have been effective in keeping down mosquito breeding. In fact, the total number of breeding sites found in NEA inspections actually fell to an average of 1,100 a month this year, down from 1,600 a month last year. Most of this reduction is because fewer breeding spots are being found in homes. I hope residents will continue to do their part to control mosquito breeding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Understanding the problem</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, despite all these measures, we still have a serious problem. Even though we have reduced mosquito breeding, the number of dengue cases in Singapore has continued to rise. In fact, there is a resurgence of dengue worldwide in the tropics, and many countries in South-East Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam, have reported much higher levels of the disease in 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1344<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans are naturally concerned about the rise in dengue cases.&nbsp; We do not fully understand why this is happening.&nbsp; There are many possible factors, including rising temperatures, increased strength of the virus, increased biting rates of mosquitoes, lower immunity especially of the younger population, or the interplay of several of these factors. Possibly mosquitoes are breeding in non-traditional sites that we have not yet discovered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have formed a panel of international and local experts on dengue to study the sudden upsurge in dengue, and advise the Government on the best strategy to deal with the problem. The panel will also enhance the existing research programmes on the disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Breaking the cycle of transmission</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will take time for us to fully understand the full reasons for the rise in dengue cases in Singapore. Meanwhile, we need to take urgent action to avoid a public health problem and clogging up our hospitals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever the deeper causes, one thing is clear: dengue can only be transmitted through the Aedes mosquito. So there are two things that we must do to break the cycle of transmission. First, we need to further reduce the mosquito population. Second, we need to isolate dengue patients from mosquitoes, thus preventing people infected with the disease from being the source of further infections.&nbsp; Both measures require the combined efforts of the Government and Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Immediate action against mosquitoes</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our immediate task is to reduce the mosquito population to levels that pose little threat to people. We will continue with our localised efforts to track clusters <p align=left>Column: 1345<p>of dengue cases. But we will also move beyond these localised efforts with an anti-mosquito blitz in all constituencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the blitz started last weekend in Ang Mo Kio, Hougang, Marsiling and Yishun. 700 volunteers from NEA, PUB, SCDF, HDB, and LTA, together with the Singapore Pest Management Association and Singapore SOKA Association, combed the estates thoroughly to search for and destroy breeding habitats. We chose four estates that have experienced more dengue cases this year in order to find out the state of mosquito breeding and if there are new types of breeding habitats of the Aedes mosquitoes that have previously not been detected. During the two-day operation, the volunteers covered the common areas of over 1,600 blocks of flats including common corridors, perimeter drains, open grounds, bin centre rooftops, pump rooms, and playgrounds. A total of 172 breeding sites were found and destroyed, which is about&nbsp;one breeding site for every 10 blocks of flats checked. Of the breeding sites found, 29% involved breeding in flower pot trays and water containers in corridors, 26% in discarded receptacles in open areas, 39% in outdoor areas such as perimeter drains, bin centre rooftops, and 6% in tree holes.&nbsp; This shows that we need to do more to promote household responsibility, deter littering, and to bring about better housekeeping in our estates.&nbsp; We need to make collective efforts to keep our neighbourhoods free from mosquito breeding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the 2-day exercise, there were 16 occasions when we detected mosquitoes and carried out fogging. I understand that there are some doubts about the efficacy of fogging.&nbsp; However, according to the World Health Organisation, thermal fogging is still an effective means for killing adult mosquitoes, and complements searching for and destroying all possible mosquito breeding sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1346<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This 'carpet-combing' blitz has helped to reduce the breeding sources of mosquitoes, and to better understand the breeding habits of Aedes mosquitoes. No new types of breeding habitats were found during the blitz.&nbsp; There were also some 2,000 potential breeding sites identified over the two days, which will be monitored and removed permanently, if possible. The information gathered in this exercise will be shared with all the Town Councils. NEA will be carrying out another 'carpet-combing' operation next weekend and plans to cover all the estates within the next&nbsp;six weeks. An in-depth analysis will be carried out on all the findings, in consultation with the expert panel.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Additional Government measures against mosquitoes</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the blitz, we must sustain our efforts against mosquitoes. Keeping Singapore mosquito-free cannot be a one-off effort. The Government has thus committed an additional $30 million towards measures in the fight against dengue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now inform the House of the measures that Government is taking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Dedicated Pest Control Operators for Town Councils</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the blitz and information provided on the breeding sites, NEA will proceed to work with the Town Councils to put in place a better and more comprehensive system to prevent mosquito breeding. Already, three Town Councils,&nbsp;namely, Hong Kah, Jurong and Sembawang, have programmes dedicated specifically to controlling mosquitoes. NEA is currently assisting other Town Councils to put in place such dedicated mosquito programmes islandwide through the Pest Control Operators (PCOs) by October. These PCOs will have to submit reports to the Town Councils&nbsp;and NEA.<p align=left>Column: 1347<p> Having dedicated PCOs will also build up institutional local knowledge of mosquito breeding habitats. This should help bring down the number of breeding sites in common areas in our housing estates, such as perimeter drains, linkway roof gutters, bin centres and pump rooms. We are also asking all&nbsp;the Town Councils&nbsp;to appoint a dedicated Environmental Control Officer (ECO) on their staff. The ECO will be responsible for all public health programmes including dengue prevention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Waterlogged public areas and drains</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the Government will clear waterlogged public areas to break the cycle of breeding. We will be cleaning our drains more frequently as drains are one of the breeding habitats of mosquitoes. Often stagnant water accumulates in drains which are clogged with dead leaves and litter, creating places for mosquitoes to breed. We need to establish a new, permanent regime of maintenance and cleanliness of our common areas and drains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Structural design and maintenance</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government is also looking into longer-term measures that will help keep the incidence of dengue low. We will study infrastructure issues to avoid having structures that collect and retain water which allows mosquito breeding. We will review the design of perimeter and car park drains and other common areas in the housing estates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Every Singaporean must play his part</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans play an equally important part in sustaining the fight against dengue. The Government cannot do it alone. We need to make a national effort, with the public showing community spirit and responsibility to <p align=left>Column: 1348<p>ensure the health of our fellow Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>The Campaign Against Dengue</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To stop Aedes mosquitoes from breeding, we have to deny them any stagnant water. But NEA officers cannot inspect every home in Singapore. The Aedes mosquito can breed anywhere with clean stagnant water, such as flower-pot plates, pails and containers such as empty plastic cups or plastic bags that collect rainwater. In fact, a spot of water the size of a 20-cent coin is all it takes for the mosquito to breed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So for the sake of your own health, and the health of your fellow Singaporeans, I ask all members of the public to be alert and regularly check your homes for potential breeding areas both indoors and outdoors. I am heartened to note that&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;households&nbsp;found breeding mosquitoes fell this year, for all types of homes. This shows that the people are already taking measures against mosquitoes. We should continue with such measures, and do even more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To teach Singaporeans simple steps to follow to protect their households from mosquito breeding, we launched the Campaign Against Dengue yesterday. As part of the campaign, grassroots and Dengue Prevention Volunteers from all 84 constituencies were mobilised to conduct door-to-door visits to HDB blocks, private apartments and houses nationwide. During the visits, residents were given 'Ten-Minute Mozzie Wipeout' pamphlets in the four official languages. The pamphlet provides tips on dengue prevention in the form of a simple ten minute five-step routine to prevent mosquito breeding. This campaign will continue for the next few weeks for those households that have not yet been visited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I ask everyone to perform this 'Ten-Minute Mozzie Wipeout' to protect <p align=left>Column: 1349<p>their families from dengue. What each and every one of us can do in just 10 minutes a day will go a long way towards preventing mosquito breeding in Singapore. For example, flat owners should cover their bamboo pole holders when not in use. If they have plants in their homes, they should change the water in vases and flower bowls every other day. They can also put granular insecticide into vases and flower bowls to kill mosquito larvae.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Working adults should also be alert to potential mosquito breeding sites at their work place. This includes construction work sites and workers' dormitories. We will produce a pamphlet on how workers can check for and remove common potential breeding sites in the workplace in the four official languages plus other languages for foreign workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Business owners can play a part too in preventing mosquito breeding.&nbsp; For instance, hawkers, florists, and other businesses with many water receptacles should regularly inspect these containers to stop mosquito breeding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through this intensive campaign, we will raise our level of cleanliness and maintenance and keep it high. In order to prevent dengue in the long term, the good habits of the Ten-Minute Mozzie Wipeout must be part of our routine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Advice for those going on trips</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who intend to be away from home for more than a week should also take measures to prevent water from stagnating in their homes, such as by covering up gully traps and toilet bowls. Pails and watering cans should be placed upside down so that they do not collect water. Water in flower vases and bowls should be removed. If you are going away for a long period, you should ask a family member or a friend to check on your home regularly. If you own a property which is vacant, please do the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1350<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some members of the public have expressed their concern about vacant properties that may be harbouring mosquitoes. The Government has the power under the law to enter vacant premises to check for mosquito breeding sites in order to protect public health. However, it will only do this under strict conditions and when the situation warrants it, such as when the owner cannot be located and there is a dengue cluster in the area. We will enter vacant premises even if we cannot contact the owner if there are strong indications that there is mosquito breeding in the premises, and if the owner did not leave behind a contact number for the authorities to make contact. So owners of vacant properties wishing to avoid such a situation should leave behind a contact number which the authorities can contact, if necessary. In any case, I urge owners of vacant properties to ensure that their premises are free from mosquito-breeding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Avoiding littering</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public can also do its part to prevent mosquito breeding in public areas by not littering. Litter left in drains clogs up our drains and creates pools of stagnant water. Every day PUB clears up to 16 tonnes of litter, comprising plastic bags and bottles, from the booms across our rivers. Litter in common areas such as empty cans, drink cans, and plastic bags can also collect</p>\r\n</P></span></div>  \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>rainwater and become mosquito breeding places.

A dedicated 24/7 dengue hotline and a website (<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=http://www.dengue.gov.sg/\"\"><I>www.dengue.gov.sg</I></a>) have been set up in conjunction with the Campaign Against <p align=left>Column: 1351<p>Dengue for people to alert us to possible mosquito breeding grounds. Many civic-minded Singaporeans and residents from all walks of life have called the hotline to alert us to potential breeding sites and matters relating to the dengue problem. To help non-English speakers also to remember the hotline, we are providing two numbers, 1800-X-DENGUE and 1800-333-7777. People can also use the hotline and website to obtain advice and share ideas on dengue prevention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Preventing people with dengue from infecting others</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public also plays a role in preventing people with dengue from infecting others. If a female Aedes mosquito bites a dengue patient, the dengue virus will be transmitted from the patient to the mosquito. If this infected mosquito then bites other healthy people, it will pass the disease on to them. This is how dengue spreads. Therefore, all dengue patients, or suspected dengue patients, should take precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. And how can they do so? They can apply mosquito repellent on themselves, wear long-sleeved clothing, sleep under mosquito nets and keep their rooms mosquito free. We have reminded all doctors to advise their patients to do this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So dengue patients have a part to play in stopping the spread of the disease. If you are ill, and have symptoms such as a fever, joint pains and nausea, please see your doctor early. If your doctor suspects that you have dengue, he will recommend what you must do, to take care of yourself and to avoid transmitting the disease to others. Please heed his advice. This will help prevent your loved ones and others from becoming infected. Sir, again, I hope that this will become part of our routine.</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1352<p>\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Conclusion</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we can bring down the number of dengue cases in Singapore substantially, by denying the mosquito the conditions it needs to breed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our collective response to this challenge is to step up our level of cleanliness and environmental vigilance to make it more difficult for the mosquito to breed. On the Government's part, the NEA and other agencies will continue to closely coordinate the ongoing efforts as well as the new initiatives. But the Government and the community must forge a stronger partnership to maintain a clean and healthy environment in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I understand the anxiety Singaporeans must feel about the dengue situation. Fortunately, we do know how the disease is transmitted&nbsp;- through the Aedes mosquito. We thus need to take necessary precautions to prevent mosquito breeding. It only takes 10 minutes a day of five simple steps to protect your households from dengue and make&nbsp;all of us&nbsp;safer. And if we come down with the illness, we must take steps to ensure that our loved ones do not catch it from us. Tackling dengue requires concerted efforts from us all, but it does not require drastic changes&nbsp;in our daily routines, so we should continue with our daily lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In engaging the public and media, the Government will continue to provide full facts and figures. We will give Singaporeans the information and the knowledge they need to combat dengue. At the same time, the public can feed us information by being our eyes and ears on the ground. And we believe this partnership is the best approach for a successful campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we must sustain our efforts against dengue to prevent another <p align=left>Column: 1353<p>resurgence of the disease next year. All of us must play our part to keep Singapore dengue-free.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Deputy Speaker:</B> The Minister has indicated that he is prepared to take clarifications.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister a few questions.&nbsp; In fact, I had been raising this issue with his officers and the Minister himself in the past. I am very pleased that now there is a real war that we are mounting against this Aedes mosquito.&nbsp; It is not just an attack but a real war.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am quite surprised that the Minister said that actually the number of breeding cases has reduced, but the number of dengue cases has increased. Maybe the Minister can clarify whether it is due to the special environment in Singapore that we have new mutants of mosquitoes that are more powerful and more intelligent, or that Singaporeans are now weaker in their constitution and therefore succumb to this Aedes mosquito problem.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second point is on the idea of breaking the breeding cycle, which I think is very effective.&nbsp; I would like to encourage the Minister and the Government to do more of this nation-wide campaign.&nbsp; We can all do this together to mount periodic measures to eradicate this mosquito nuisance from time to time, so that the cycle can be broken. I would also like to ask the Minister whether he likes to encourage patients who are infected with the dengue fever to have their self-quarantine process so they do not transmit the dengue virus and infect other people.&nbsp; I think encouraging patients to do a self-quarantine process is a way to break the breeding cycle of the mosquito.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third point is on rules and regulations, Sir. I would like to ask the <p align=left>Column: 1354<p>Minister whether his Ministry can actually be more stringent in asking other Ministries which are in charge of other areas to also make the effort to look at measures that can help to reduce this problem.&nbsp; Let me give a few examples. On the parks, we now know that trees can have receptacles which encourage breeding of mosquitoes.&nbsp; For example, I think some particular types of palm tree, like the travellers palm, can provide a large catchment of water for breeding of mosquitoes.&nbsp; So the NParks can also look at issues like that when they plant trees.&nbsp; They should try to plant trees that do not encourage breeding of mosquitoes. These are measures which can help to reduce the problem.&nbsp; The second example is in the area of building control.&nbsp; I think the design of gutters in buildings and certain cornices and corners can also provide mosquito breeding areas. So, maybe we should now ask the Ministry of National Development to look at building control and building design to reduce less trappings for mosquito breeding.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister whether there is a practice that if you report to the NEA about mosquito breeding and when their officers come to your house and find that there are mosquitoes in your house, you get fined in the process. When neighbours are found to be breeding mosquitoes, they are fined as well.&nbsp; So, that may discourage people from reporting about mosquito breeding cases, thereby causing a deterrence in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, I would like to ask about private estates.&nbsp; In HDB estates, we have Town Councils being the central agency to wash up the area and do public cleaning and public maintenance, as well as fumigation.&nbsp; But in the private estates, we have, again, different areas of Ministerial responsibilities with regard to roads, drains, and park areas.&nbsp; Which department is in charge of this Aedes mosquitoes problem when it comes to <p align=left>Column: 1355<p>private estates?&nbsp; I would like the Minister to consider having a central agency which can help to look into&nbsp; how this matter can be coordinated in the private estates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, one last point. I did not hear the Minister mention about any targets. What are his targets in terms of his programme? Does he intend to reduce the number of dengue fever cases by half within a month? Or maybe he could have some kind of a low target within the whole year.&nbsp; So, at least, we will have a common target to look towards to and see how our measures can be effective.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Deputy Speaker:</B> I saw many hands.&nbsp; Can you keep your clarification as short as possible?&nbsp; Dr Yaacob.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B> Sir,&nbsp;some of the questions&nbsp;my other colleagues will reply, but let me just take the parts&nbsp;which I can answer. He is right.&nbsp; We are concerned why is it that the number of breeding sites&nbsp;is coming down, and yet the cases have gone up. And that is&nbsp;why we have formed an expert panel to study this.&nbsp; Is it because our herd immunity has gone down?&nbsp; Is it because of the rising temperature?&nbsp; Is it because of other factors and the inter-play of these factors which could be highly complex? But I think we must come back to what we know, and what we know is that we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;find a way to remove Aedes mosquito because the root cause of the problem is Aedes mosquito.&nbsp; So the reason why we are doing a lot of these programmes this past weekend and the coming weekends&nbsp;is also to help the expert panel to remove as much as possible any uncertainty in the entire picture. For example, if we have&nbsp;been able to remove and reduce the number of breeding sites and yet the cases have gone up,&nbsp;that may throw&nbsp;up some light for the expert panel to consider.&nbsp; So, <p align=left>Column: 1356<p>clearly, our effort is to make sure that we try as much as possible to understand the phenomenon, help the expert panel to study further, to understand why this is going on.&nbsp; But, meanwhile, Sir, we have to continue with the&nbsp;vigilance that I have mentioned earlier -&nbsp;take all the necessary precautions, take the five easy steps and the 'Ten-minute&nbsp;Mozzie&nbsp;Wipeout' challenge.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I agree with&nbsp;the Member&nbsp;that we need to have a&nbsp;nation-wide campaign to try and break the cycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;The launch yesterday is part of that campaign and we hope that up to&nbsp;today, the various grassroots organisations and voluntary organisations at the ground will continue with their efforts. In fact, we do have the Dengue Prevention Volunteer Group, the DPVG, at the ground.&nbsp; As I mentioned in my speech, there are about 4,000 of them.&nbsp;I hope, as advisors,&nbsp;Members could actually encourage them do the house to house checks frequently.&nbsp;I have been told that our NEA officers in the various centres work very closely with the advisors during block parties to have campaigns and education materials on the dengue scourge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of whether the patient should do self-quarantine, perhaps I will ask Dr Balaji to clarify further.&nbsp; But our position is that for the dengue patient who is carrying the virus, the one way to break the transmission is not to allow a mosquito to bite him or her so that that mosquito will carry the virus to another person. So, essentially, what we are suggesting is that when you protect yourself from mosquitoes, it does not mean you have to quarantine yourself from the society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the stringent measures carried out with the other Ministries, that is why we set up the MSCD, the Ministerial Steering&nbsp;Committee on Dengue. We are working with the other Ministries to study this, as I mentioned in my reply.&nbsp; For <p align=left>Column: 1357<p>example, we are studying some of the structural changes that we have to make.&nbsp; These are long-term solutions that we will have to&nbsp;study carefully.&nbsp;I understand that Mr Mah has something to say on this matter later, Sir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on fines, in fact when we started out,&nbsp;for first-time offenders, we do not impose any fines. We put back the fine in February this year because we saw a resurgence of the cases, but yet we have been very flexible. My officers told me that very often we&nbsp;work together with the home owners and we help them. In fact, yesterday, Sir, during my house to house visit, the home owners were more than happy to invite our officers in for&nbsp;checks and to make sure that their homes are free of mosquitoes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the private estates, it applies exactly to my reply&nbsp;on the inter-Ministry coordination. We work together.&nbsp; For example, when the various agencies come across&nbsp;something&nbsp;which NEA will have to do, they will contact us.&nbsp; In fact, there is an inter-agency dengue task force chaired by the CEO of NEA, together with all the relevant agencies, to ensure that we coordinate&nbsp;this effort. So, for example, the drains which either belong to PUB or&nbsp;NEA are being&nbsp;cleaned more frequently because of this current challenge. So our target is very simple.&nbsp; We want to keep it low, but I think all the programmes that we have in place will take some time to take effect. We will review as we go along and monitor the situation very closely. A good example would be the things that we found over the weekend. What was the highest number of breeding habitats? Discarded receptacles and&nbsp;littering.&nbsp; Sir, I would urge Singaporeans to please be careful -&nbsp;if you throw away a plastic cup, a plastic bag, any plastic receptacle - these will collect water after a rainfall and they will become&nbsp;breeding sites.&nbsp; So our action, Sir, can help to tackle this problem. Maybe I can invite Mr Mah or Dr Balaji to reply.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1358<p><B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Thank you Dr Yaacob for re-directing this question to me. I am a member of the MSCD.&nbsp; So I am also fully responsible for making sure that our campaign against dengue is successful.&nbsp; But having said that, I think we need to distinguish between what we can and cannot do and not over-react. When it comes to looking at longer term issues, such as the design of the buildings, this is something we really must take a closer look at.&nbsp; When we design buildings, while we want to achieve certain aesthetic objectives, we must also make sure that it is practical and that it is easy to maintain, and especially in the current situation, that it does not encourage the breeding of mosquitoes, such as encouraging stagnant pools of water to form, etc. So this is something the HDB and BCA will do.&nbsp; It will review the design of rooftops, secondary roofs in HDB blocks, water tanks, gutters on linkways, etc.&nbsp;\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>Does it mean that we get rid of all these things? The answer is:&nbsp; not necessarily so.&nbsp; So let us take a closer look first before we change.&nbsp; Some of these are for very good reasons.&nbsp; The secondary roofs in buildings, for example, help to cool the building down, and help to make sure that the leaks in buildings are reduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it also mean that we get rid of all our trees because trees are supposed to collect water which then breeds mosquitoes?&nbsp; I think the answer is no.&nbsp; Because if we do that, then we will need a Save Our Trees Campaign after this.&nbsp; The travellers palms are one of the species of trees which do tend to collect more water in the axils of the leaves. It does not mean that we get rid of all the travellers palms in Singapore.&nbsp; But it does mean that the NParks and other maintenance crew would have to check the palms, check the leaves, more thoroughly.&nbsp; There are certain things that they can do, for example, by treating the axils so that mosquitoes do not breed.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1359<p> They can even, in certain cases, drill holes in the leaves without hurting the plant such that the water drains down.&nbsp; But at the end of the day, I think there has to be a balance between what we can do in the design and also what we can do ourselves as citizens. As Minister Yaacob pointed out, more than half of the problems that we had detected in our campaign, in our comb-through exercise last weekend, was due to ourselves - cans being left on the ground, plastic bags, flower pots, trays, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it mean that we completely disallow people from keeping plants in HDB estates?&nbsp; I think this is an opportunity for us to encourage our residents to practise good house-keeping if they do keep plants and also that they do not overdo it.&nbsp; But, reasonably speaking, we would have to allow residents to keep some plants on the corridors.&nbsp; But we should not over react.&nbsp; This is the approach that I hope we can take. We will encourage our residents to do more within the flat through the 10-minute checklist, but also be more responsible outside the flat, ie, the common corridor and in the common areas. In this way, I believe we would still be able to enjoy a clean and green environment.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Balaji Sadasivan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are two points that Mr Leong brought up that I would just like to clarify.&nbsp; First, he has pointed out that the number of breeding sites has gone down, but the number of dengue cases has gone up&nbsp;and he suggested that&nbsp;it may be because the virus is much stronger and is a new mutant, or he suggested it could be that we are weaker,&nbsp;our immune status is lower,&nbsp;herd immunity is down. Actually, both are possibilities.&nbsp; So we really do not know why we are having&nbsp;this increase&nbsp;in dengue cases, and that is why we are having an expert committee to look at all these factors to see which one of these <p align=left>Column: 1360<p>factors, or a combination of factors, has given rise to this increase in dengue cases.&nbsp; We are also doing some research studies, in terms of the&nbsp;sero status of patients and the general public to see if the changes in the immune status may be partly responsible for the increase in cases.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the issue of whether people should self-quarantine themselves, there is no necessity for it.&nbsp; Because this is not an infection that spreads directly from one person to another. So any amount of human contact is safe because&nbsp;dengue does not move from one person to another person directly.&nbsp;Although you cannot infect another person, you can infect the mosquito, and that can only happen during a five-day window period at the start of your infection when there is virus in your blood.&nbsp; So we have asked our general practitioners to give advice on how to stop you from infecting the mosquitoes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to whether you should stay at home or go out,&nbsp;actually if any other mosquito, other than the Aedes, bites you, that mosquito will not get infected with dengue.&nbsp; So it is quite safe to go to nature parks, etc, where I know sometimes you have large mosquitoes flying around and they are the noisy variety.&nbsp; But those mosquitoes will not get infected with dengue.&nbsp;It is only the Aedes mosquito and, unfortunately, the Aedes mosquito stays in urban places, like your home or immediately outside your home or in buildings.&nbsp;That is why there is so much of emphasis about preventing the breeding of Aedes mosquitoes.&nbsp; If we can stop humans from infecting mosquitoes, we can reduce the incidence of dengue.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;because mosquitoes do not spread dengue from one mosquito to another.&nbsp; So the infected dengue mosquitoes will die, ie, their lifespan is about three weeks.&nbsp; But for each new generation of mosquitoes to spread dengue, they have to grow from larvae to become adults;<p align=left>Column: 1361<p> they need to bite an infected human and&nbsp;fly around for about a week while the virus incubates in the mosquito and&nbsp;gets concentrated in its saliva and then, after that, bites another human being in order to spread the disease.&nbsp;And this particular mosquito, in order to get infected, must bite a human during that five days when he has virus in the bloodstream.&nbsp;So if we can have dengue patients or dengue suspects protect themselves from being bitten by the mosquito at home, because that is where most of the Aedes mosquitoes are going to be in urban areas, then we can stop mosquitoes from getting infected with dengue and&nbsp;stop the dengue-infected mosquitoes from infecting new persons.&nbsp; So we have sent that advisory out to all our general practitioners and&nbsp;hospitals for dengue suspects to use repellents.&nbsp; So my advice to all Singaporeans would be to follow that advice.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B> Sir, fogging, according to the WHO, is still the most effective means of killing Aedes mosquitoes.&nbsp; We have standard operating procedures where we have trained our PCOs to&nbsp;carry out fogging judiciously and fogging is only effective,&nbsp;we have been told, in the morning&nbsp;and dusk where the adult mosquitoes go out for a&nbsp;bite and&nbsp;during those times when the weather is a bit cooler, the chemicals will remain longer&nbsp;in the atmosphere so that there is a greater chance of killing the adult mosquitoes.&nbsp; But this is also one of the issues in which we will refer back to the expert panel for them to review&nbsp;as to whether our current practice needs to be enhanced or changed.&nbsp; But meanwhile, where we&nbsp;find&nbsp;a population of adult mosquitoes, we will carry out fogging as we have done over the weekend.&nbsp; We&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1364<p>found 16 sites and we did 16 fogging actions.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On repellent, Sir, this is available in the market.&nbsp; Basically, there is no reason for us to give it free.&nbsp; It is quite reasonably priced.&nbsp; I bought a couple of it over the weekend.&nbsp; I think this is quite affordable. NTUC has embarked on a campaign to help Singaporeans by giving reasonable discounts.&nbsp;All the repellents where&nbsp;chemicals are used&nbsp;would have to be registered with NEA.&nbsp; We do not check the effectiveness of the repellents.&nbsp; We leave it to Singaporeans to decide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there enough websites on&nbsp;certain types of chemicals?&nbsp; I am not an expert in this matter.&nbsp; I have been told by my EHI officials that most of the repellents in the market are quite good and&nbsp;effective.&nbsp; So I think the information is already available on our website, in terms of the chemical composition that is needed in each repellent. For example, we have been told that citronella is quite good.&nbsp; So now you see soaps being sold with citronella oil that will leave you a layer of citronella that could repel mosquitoes.&nbsp; So I bought a bottle yesterday and used it this morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have to take the necessary precautions.&nbsp; There are enough of these&nbsp;products in the market.&nbsp; Singaporeans are wise enough and NTUC has helped us to put some of these products up so that Singaporeans can easily access them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div> \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Sir, there is an impression down the ground that the incidence of dengue cases has increased because there is some linkage to the way cleaning is done at the ground.&nbsp; And the way cleaning is done is also associated with the people doing the cleaning.&nbsp; So the question is whether, because there is now a lot of outsourcing of cleaning work and, therefore, that has in some ways affected the way cleaning is done which is not so thorough and not so well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously, when these&nbsp;were done by the <p align=left>Column: 1365<p>direct employees, and they had been doing the job for many years, they had a certain instinct as to where the mosquitoes could possibly be hiding.&nbsp; They have some experience and the&nbsp;ability to do that.&nbsp; But now that it has been outsourced,&nbsp;the contractors come in, they employ people and&nbsp;they may not be the ones---\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Deputy Speaker:</B> Madam Halimah, can you raise your clarification?&nbsp; What is your question?\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Sir, my question is this: is there some truth in that?&nbsp; That because we have&nbsp;been outsourcing cleaning work, that is the reason that has contributed to this&nbsp;perception of the standard of cleanliness and the number of dengue cases increasing.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B> Sir, I think that is the reason why PM announced the Ministerial Committee over the last weekend because we are seeing a worrying trend and we have to tackle this quickly.&nbsp; I think it is very difficult for all of us to really put on a number because, as mentioned earlier, the relationship between breeding sites and the number of dengue cases is indeed very complex.&nbsp; So I think the more important thing is to try and go out and send the message and get Singaporeans to adopt that routine while the expert panel do the study.&nbsp; If you ask me and&nbsp;the members of my Committee and the Government, obviously we want to reduce it as much as possible in the shortest possible time.&nbsp; But there are things in which we can do, and that is our appeal to the community.&nbsp; Let us do the things that we can do, so that we remove as much as possible the uncertainty in&nbsp;the entire picture,&nbsp;and the expert panel would&nbsp;at least&nbsp;have more information to study <p align=left>Column: 1367<p>and to come up with recommendations that would really help us to reduce this as much as possible.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I agree with the&nbsp;Member that this is something that we have to tackle immediately.&nbsp; But at the same time, Sir, as I have&nbsp;mentioned in my speech, life must go on.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to continue to work.&nbsp; In fact, yesterday, I had a visitor from America.&nbsp; She came in with my brother, very happy to visit Singapore,&nbsp;went to the Lantern Festival at the Chinese Garden.&nbsp; She asked me&nbsp;whether there was anything to be wary about.&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, \"Nothing.&nbsp; Go and enjoy.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I think the impression must be given that Singapore is taking care of this.&nbsp; And, at the end of the day, our daily routine need not be changed so dramatically as long as we adopt some of the steps that we have highlighted over the weekend, and then let the expert panel do the study.&nbsp; And I am confident that over time&nbsp;we can put this problem under control, Sir.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</B> In the case of Hong Kong, which has&nbsp;one and a half times the population of Singapore and a much denser area, they seemed to have coped much better in the fight against dengue.&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we going to look at whether there are lessons we can learn from the Hong Kong experience in fighting dengue?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another question I have is: would NEA remain the main coordinating agency for dengue related issues over the longer term so that people would not be passed from pillar to post?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third question is: for pest control companies that the Town Councils would be employing under the scheme currently launched, has NEA actually worked out with the Town Councils some kind of minimum performance standards, KPIs <p align=left>Column: 1368<p>and so on, to ensure that these pest control companies are effective?&nbsp; Because in the short term,&nbsp;practically all the Town Councils will be employing pest control managers.&nbsp; Would they have enough trained people to actually undertake this task?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, finally, incidentally, I would like to ask the Minister if he has actually come across anyone who has said that, instead of planting trees or plants which are actually receptacles for breeding mosquitoes, plants that will actually&nbsp;repel mosquitoes and&nbsp;keep mosquitoes off?&nbsp; Because during the weekend when I&nbsp;visited the residents, one of the residents&nbsp;showed me a plant and he said it was very effective in keeping off mosquitoes.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1372<p><B>The Minister for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Senior Minister, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this Bill seeks to establish a deposit insurance scheme in Singapore. Once enacted, it will provide an explicit, limited guarantee to insured depositors that they will be compensated, up to a specified amount, in the event of a failure of a full bank or a finance company in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the deposit insurance scheme has been&nbsp;three years in the making, since&nbsp;MAS announced its intentions in June 2002.&nbsp; MAS has consulted the industry and the public on the key features of the deposit insurance scheme and has received broad support for the scheme.&nbsp; We have considered and incorporated the comments we have received, where appropriate, in the course of finalising the features of the deposit insurance scheme.&nbsp; MAS will also be holding consultations on the specific regulations required to implement the deposit insurance scheme envisaged in the Bill.&nbsp; The deposit insurance scheme is expected to come into effect on 1st April 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Why we need deposit insurance in a dynamic and sound financial system</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me first set out the thinking behind the introduction of a deposit insurance scheme in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS began a process of liberalising and opening up the domestic banking sector in 1999 to foster a more dynamic and innovative financial centre, and to strengthen the local banks by injecting more competition in the system.&nbsp; At the same time, MAS has shifted away from one-size-fits-all regulation of financial institutions, towards a risk-focused supervisory approach that is tailored to the institution in question - basically,<p align=left>Column: 1373<p> tailored to its scale, its business model and the activities that it conducts, the impact that problems in the institution will have on the financial system as a whole, and MAS' assessment of the strength of the firm and its management.&nbsp; MAS' aim in opening the market to more competition, and in shifting towards risk-focused supervision, has been to foster a banking system that is not only strong, but innovative and able to take well-managed risks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The domestic banking market is now highly competitive.&nbsp; There is a greater presence of strong foreign banks, including&nbsp;six banks which have been awarded Qualified Full Bank (QFB) privileges. &nbsp;Increased competition has resulted in lower prices for customers and a wider range of services and products.&nbsp; The&nbsp;seven local banks in 1998 have consolidated into the&nbsp;three local banking groups that we have today.&nbsp; Their scale and complexity of&nbsp;operations have also increased.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have expanded their fee-earning business activities and their presence abroad so as to grow and diversify their revenue base.&nbsp; They have also upgraded their risk management capabilities, and are managing their capital more efficiently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five years into a more liberalised banking sector, the local banks are more dynamic and are expanding abroad, but remain strong. They have responded well to competition, and have held their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While our banking system remains sound, the growing complexity and scope of banking businesses will present challenges to supervision, in all financial centres.&nbsp; Increasingly, the operations of banks with a global or&nbsp;regional presence are influenced by factors beyond the control of&nbsp;supervisors in&nbsp;a single&nbsp;market. While MAS' licensing, regulatory and supervisory standards will aim to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking <p align=left>Column: 1374<p>system in Singapore, international experience has shown that the possibility of a bank failure and loss to depositors cannot be eliminated even in reputable&nbsp;and well supervised jurisdictions.&nbsp; Further, we should not seek to eliminate all risks of failure, even if it was possible to do so.&nbsp; It would call for onerous rules that would stifle enterprise and ultimately weaken our banks.&nbsp; In seeking to promote and preserve stability in the financial system, we therefore cannot and should not introduce rules to guarantee the soundness of individual financial institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Market discipline plays an important part in keeping the financial system safe and sound.&nbsp; MAS has embarked on initiatives to empower consumers through financial education and by enhancing the efficiency of dispute resolution mechanisms for retail consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;MAS recognises that small depositors will often not be in a position to assess the safety and soundness of banks. But the solution to this should not be for Government to guarantee their deposits - even implicitly, if not explicitly.&nbsp; All experience internationally shows that the effectiveness of market discipline is blunted if depositors simply look to Government for a guarantee of their deposits.&nbsp; It leads to moral hazard and excessive risk-taking - amongst depositors, who will place their money where the returns are highest regardless of the risks, as well as amongst the banks themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, the Government or MAS has not issued any guarantee for bank deposits.&nbsp; However, the absence of an explicit limited deposit insurance scheme could lead depositors to assume that the Government would guarantee their deposits should a bank fail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a deposit insurance scheme is for these reasons a useful plank in a dynamic <p align=left>Column: 1375<p>and competitive financial system.&nbsp; It will complement the roles of boards of directors and management of banks, and of MAS supervision of the banks, which seek to ensure that banks manage their risks prudently as they grow and&nbsp;become more complex in their operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deposit insurance will serve two purposes. First, it will provide an adequate layer of protection for small depositors.&nbsp; Second, a deposit insurance scheme will clarify explicitly the extent of protection given to depositors and dispel any misperception that there is an implicit Government guarantee on deposits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explicit deposit insurance schemes are present in about 80 countries worldwide.&nbsp; It is timely to introduce a deposit insurance scheme in Singapore now when the banking system is sound. It is better to build up a deposit insurance fund slowly when the banking system is healthy, than to tax the banking sector heavily&nbsp;when a failure has occurred.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will now go through the key provisions of the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Key measures under the Deposit Insurance Bill</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Coverage of deposit insurance</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The level and extent of coverage is a key feature of any deposit insurance scheme.&nbsp; In arriving at its&nbsp;decision on this matter, MAS was guided by both the need to provide adequate protection for small depositors, as well as the need to limit costs and preserve market discipline.&nbsp; The higher and the broader the coverage, the higher the cost will be to the banks.&nbsp; This would normally result in banks passing on higher costs to depositors, and will impair the competitiveness of banks in Singapore.&nbsp; Overly-generous coverage under the deposit insurance scheme could <p align=left>Column: 1376<p>also lead to moral hazard, where large depositors and the banks themselves take on excessive risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill therefore seeks to provide adequate protection to small depositors, who are least able to make informed decisions, while containing the costs of deposit insurance and preserving the incentives for large depositors to exercise market discipline.&nbsp; The deposit insurance scheme is meant for small depositors, not for large or sophisticated depositors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have therefore decided on a $20,000 coverage limit, per depositor per institution, net of liabilities to the failed institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 31 of the Bill sets this out.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that a depositor would receive compensation under the deposit insurance scheme for the first $20,000 of his aggregate insured deposits in his&nbsp;bank or finance company, if it should fail.&nbsp; MAS' study shows that this level of coverage would protect in full the deposits of about 87% of individual depositors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scheme will only cover deposits held by individuals.&nbsp; Deposits of businesses (including sole proprietorships and partnerships) will not be insured.&nbsp; In view of public interest, the scheme will also cover registered and exempt charities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>The next question is the type of deposits to be protected. The deposit insurance scheme will insure Singapore dollar deposits in standard savings, current and fixed deposit accounts in all full banks and finance companies. This will cover a range of such deposits, including, for instance, Islamic deposits that are principal-guaranteed, but will exclude products which are investment-oriented. Investment products, foreign currency deposits, structured deposits and deposits placed as collateral will not be insured. The deposits to be insured are specified in the First Schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1377<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The coverage limit will be on a per depositor per institution basis. This means that balances in all standard savings, current and fixed deposit accounts belonging to the same depositor, whether in his own name, held jointly with another person, or in a trust account where he is the beneficiary, will be aggregated to compute the compensation payout. However, we have given special consideration to CPF savings placed in such types of bank deposits, given the important social role of CPF funds as core retirement savings. Moneys held under the CPF Investment Scheme will be separately insured up to $20,000.&nbsp; These are moneys held in bank deposits under the CPF Investment Scheme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coverage on a per depositor basis, under which all of a person's&nbsp;deposit accounts in a bank are added together, is&nbsp;the most equitable way. It is preferable to coverage for each deposit account, which could lead to large depositors splitting their deposits in several deposit accounts in a bank to take advantage of a higher level of coverage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By introducing deposit insurance coverage in&nbsp;this targeted manner, the size of the Deposit Insurance Fund, and consequently the premiums levied on banks, can be kept affordable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Deposit Insurance Fund&nbsp;<br>\r\n</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 9 establishes a deposit insurance fund that will be built up from premium contributions of the banks and finance companies who are Scheme members. The fund will pay compensation to insured depositors in the event of a failure of a Scheme member.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some countries levy contributions on Scheme members only after a bank failure,&nbsp;in other words,&nbsp;ex-post, to make the payouts required to depositors. We considered this very carefully.&nbsp; We have <p align=left>Column: 1378<p>decided to levy premium contributions in advance, in other words&nbsp;ex-ante, or before any bank failure, so as to build up a deposit insurance fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several advantages to ex-ante funding. Firstly, it ensures a readily available pool of funds to enable prompt disbursement should compensation need to be made.&nbsp; Secondly, it is fairer to collect premiums before a bank failure than after a bank failure, as the failed Scheme member would also have contributed to the fund.&nbsp; Ex-ante funding also mitigates the pro-cyclical effect that large ex-post contributions may have on the banking sector - in other words, it does not impose hefty costs on banks at times of economic difficulty, which could lead to further economic contraction. Finally, collecting premiums to build up a ready fund in advance&nbsp;reinforces public confidence in the deposit insurance scheme, and dispels any expectation of a Government guarantee on deposits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The targeted fund size, to be built up over 10-11 years from these premium contributions, is equivalent to 0.3% of total insured deposits in the banking system, currently estimated&nbsp; at about $120 million.&nbsp; MAS' analysis has found that this would be an adequate fund size given the key features of the deposit insurance scheme, such as the scope of coverage, the priority claim&nbsp;given to&nbsp;insured deposits, the fact that we do not face a high risk of bank failure in Singapore, and the good likelihood of recovering sufficient assets from the failed bank to meet its insured deposit liabilities.&nbsp; The Deposit Insurance Agency would also be able to borrow to fund any temporary shortfalls, and to impose additional premiums on banks should it be necessary to recapitalise the fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foreign full banks which operate as branches&nbsp;in Singapore&nbsp;will be required to maintain a minimum level of Singapore-<p align=left>Column: 1379<p>domiciled assets of at least 100% of their insured deposits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event of a bank failure, the Deposit Insurance Agency will make compensation payout to insured depositors from the deposit insurance fund.&nbsp; It will then stand in the shoes of the insured depositors to claim against the assets of the failed bank for the amount of compensation that has been paid out. The Bill will also give insured deposits priority over other deposit liabilities of the bank.&nbsp; These measures - asset maintenance of foreign bank branches&nbsp;and insured deposit priority - will strengthen recovery by the Deposit Insurance Agency from the failed institution of the amount it has paid out as compensation. They serve to lower the necessary size of the deposit insurance fund and hence the cost of deposit insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fund will be invested in safe and liquid assets such as Singapore Government Securities, deposits with MAS and other assets approved by the Minister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Premiums</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the question of premiums to be paid by different institutions. Full banks and finance companies will be required to contribute premiums in order to build up the deposit insurance fund. But charging a flat rate to all institutions regardless of risk will be inequitable, and dulls the incentive for institutions to improve their risk management. Premium contributions will therefore be based on the risk profiles of&nbsp;members of the Scheme, so that less risky and better-managed Scheme members will be charged lower premiums. Initially, premiums charged will be set at an average of 0.03% of insured deposits, which are among the lowest premium rates in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1380<p>\r\n<p><I>Compensation</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill sets out the procedures for triggering a payout from the Deposit Insurance Fund.&nbsp; It provides MAS with the powers to determine that a payout be made to insured depositors from the Deposit Insurance Fund if a court order has been made to wind up the Scheme member or if MAS is of the opinion that a Scheme member is insolvent, unable or likely to become unable to meet its obligations, or is about to suspend payment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If depositor payout is triggered, the Deposit Insurance Agency will make an official announcement. Depositors need not file claims with the Deposit Insurance Agency as payouts will be computed based on the bank's records. The Deposit Insurance Agency will make arrangements to pay out compensation to eligible depositors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I stated earlier, eligible depositors will be insured up to a maximum of $20,000 in a bank. If the deposit insurance payout received is less than the depositor's total amount of deposits in the bank, the depositor may file a separate claim with the liquidator of the failed bank for the difference between the amount of his deposits in the bank and the deposit insurance payout.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Deposit Insurance Agency</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Deposit Insurance Agency, separate from MAS, will be established to administer the deposit insurance scheme and manage the Deposit Insurance Fund. The Deposit Insurance Agency will also conduct public education on the deposit insurance scheme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Deposit Insurance Agency will be incorporated as a company limited by guarantee under the Companies Act. The board of directors of the Deposit Insurance Agency will be appointed by <p align=left>Column: 1381<p>and accountable to the Minister in charge of MAS for its acts and decisions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The budget of the Deposit Insurance Agency will be approved by the Minister. The Bill also includes provisions for the Deposit Insurance Agency and Fund to be audited, and for a copy of the audited financial statements, auditor's report and annual report to be provided to the Minister.&nbsp; The Deposit Insurance Agency's financial statements and annual report will also be made available to the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a deposit insurance scheme in Singapore will strengthen depositor protection as our financial sector continues to grow in dynamism and complexity. The existence of an explicit, limited deposit insurance scheme will also dispel public misconception of a blanket Government guarantee of deposits. It will preserve incentives for market discipline, which is essential for a safe and sound financial system. The key features of the deposit insurance scheme, that I have highlighted, have been carefully designed so as to achieve these objectives, while limiting costs and maintaining the competitiveness of our banks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak on this Bill.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This legislative move to compensate depositors should the bank they place their funds in fail is quite overdue, considering that a number of Asian countries already have such a scheme in place for quite some time.&nbsp; At the same time, the Bill should dispel any misperception by depositors that their money is guaranteed by the Government in the event that the bank they have their deposits in goes bankrupt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1382<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as we go more up-market in our banking sector, become more sophisticated and attract more banks to operate here in our endeavour to position ourselves as a truly international financial hub, it is inevitable that such moves expose depositors to a higher degree of risks.&nbsp; While the MAS is responsible to ensure that the banks operating here are subject to stringent rules and checks, it cannot guarantee that no banks or finance houses, local or foreign, will not fail.&nbsp; The collapse of Britain's Barings Bank in February 1995 is perhaps the quintessential tale that should still be fresh in the minds of many people, particularly those within the financial circle.&nbsp; The failure was completely unexpected and occurred over a course of days, all arising from the action of a single trader here by the name of Nick Leeson.&nbsp; While the circumstances may be different considering the fact that Barings Bank was a merchant bank, there is no guarantee that it cannot happen to any full-fledged bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, while depositors should hail the introduction of the Deposit Insurance Bill as their deposits will be guaranteed a return of up to $20,000 in the improbable event that their bank faces liquidation, the first big question that is in everyone's mind is how much of this protection cost will be passed on to depositors.&nbsp; Ideally, banks should look at the cost of such premiums as a business cost to them rather than passing part of, or worse still, the full cost on to depositors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the determination of premiums will, among others, also be based on the risk profiles of the banks, I would like to suggest that the MAS consider the publication of a profile rating of the banks here so as to enable depositors to make an informed decision of where their deposits will be safest.&nbsp; Members of the public should also have a clear understanding that the limit of $20,000 applies to each depositor per institution <p align=left>Column: 1383<p>that they have their funds deposited in.&nbsp; This is important to enable depositors to decide whether they place all their eggs in one basket or spread&nbsp;them over several banks, if doing so makes them feel more secure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in going over the Bill, I have a few comments and concerns which I would like Minister Tharman to address.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First is with respect to clause 3.&nbsp; I would like the Minister to clarify how the protective sum of $20,000 is arrived at.&nbsp; According to a publication of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco on deposit insurance programmes in Asia dated March this year, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,&nbsp;which is analogous to the proposed&nbsp; Deposit Insurance Agency as provided for in this Bill, each depositor account is insured for approximately US$100,000.&nbsp; In Taiwan, the insurance amount under the Central Deposit Insurance Corporation is&nbsp;US$32,000.&nbsp; In Japan, the corresponding amount is US$95,000.&nbsp; In Korea, it is US$50,000.&nbsp; It appears that all the nations noted here have a ratio computed as Insured Coverage over GDP per capita of 1.3 to 3.4&nbsp; -&nbsp; a broad but reasonable range.&nbsp; Singapore's ratio is 0.44, taking the assumption that our per capita GDP is US$27,000 and the prevailing exchange rate being $1.65 to the US dollar.&nbsp; In general,&nbsp;wealthier countries have a higher ratio due to the existence of larger deposit balances.&nbsp; On the basis of this simple computation, I believe Singapore too could afford a higher ratio to provide for greater protection to its depositors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point related to this clause is that a fixed quantum, as proposed in the Bill, will potentially be quickly overtaken by events and may become irrelevant when the Scheme fully matures in 10 or 11 years.&nbsp; It may attract controversy if it is not adjusted to the <p align=left>Column: 1384<p>prevailing appropriate protection value.&nbsp; I would like to advocate that the coverage</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Sir, it could generally be argued that proper insurance coverage provides confidence that spills over into other sectors.&nbsp; The same can be said of the potential effect of a deposit insurance scheme, such as the one being proposed, on the wealth management industry that we are trying to nurture here.&nbsp; While this point is mute during relative periods of calm, its influence during troubled times cannot be under-estimated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My next point pertains to clause 6.&nbsp; While this clause provides under exceptional circumstances for a full bank or finance house to be exempted from membership of the Scheme, the clause is silent&nbsp;on the need for such exempted institutions to clearly notify depositors as such.&nbsp; To build confidence on the proposed Deposit Insurance Scheme and the agency to be formed to administer the scheme, I would suggest that the MAS require that both members and non-members clearly state in some form, of their status of membership of the Scheme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On clause 24, while this provision is useful as it provides recourse for the Authority to seek additional premium contributions in the event of a shortfall of funds, it falls short of addressing a worst-case scenario, such as in a remote event where a number of banks and financial houses may collapse simultaneously, calling for a demand of a large amount of payout beyond the targeted fund of $120 million.&nbsp; I may sound a bit pessimistic here but I think there is a need to be comprehensive.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether the Government would step in in such a scenario to make up for the difference in payout requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1385<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving on to clause 30, occurrence of events precipitating payment of compensation should preferably have an enactment date as well as a cut-off date.&nbsp; The Bill should make it clear that the Agency is required to disburse payments within a specified timeframe, say, three months from a Court order date or when a Scheme member is made insolvent and stipulate that it would cease payments within a specified time period too.&nbsp; This would ensure a systematic procedure to process disbursements and claims, as well as frame a limit on depositors requiring time to gather evidence on their claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My final point, Sir, is with respect to clause 52 concerning the protection from liability of the Agency and its officers.&nbsp; I feel a fundamental issue of transparency is being circumvented in this particular clause.&nbsp; The Ageny operates on the tenet of public money or, specifically, money deposited by Scheme members.&nbsp; I feel that the public, as well as Scheme members, should have some form of recourse to address concerns that&nbsp;may be deemed necessary in the event of a violation in procedure.&nbsp; Failure to provide for an unbiased accounting or arbitrating conduit for the Scheme members, and particularly depositors, will not bode well for the Agency, which may be subject to the magnifying lens of public opinion.&nbsp; It may, therefore, be prudent not to include such an overarching and over-protective clause to protect the agency and its direct associates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that note, Sir, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> Sir, I would like to thank Dr Ahmad Magad for his support for the Bill and his constructive remarks.&nbsp; Let me, first, address his opening observation.&nbsp; As he noted, many other Asian markets have deposit insurance schemes and he felt that it was overdue in Singapore.&nbsp; Let me&nbsp;reiterate that our financial system is safe and sound - in fact, safer and more sound <p align=left>Column: 1386<p>than any other in Asia and one of the safest in the world.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, why are we introducing a deposit insurance scheme?&nbsp; It is not too late, but it is better that we do it now when the system is healthy.&nbsp; And as we continue to grow in complexity&nbsp;as the banking system&nbsp;expands abroad, more competition&nbsp;is brought&nbsp;into the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;By doing this now,&nbsp;depositors understand that even in a well-supervised banking system, there is a risk of bank failure, and&nbsp;understand that deposits are not guaranteed.&nbsp; The deposit insurance scheme also makes explicit that protection for deposits is not absolute but is limited.&nbsp; It specifies exactly how much each depositor can expect.&nbsp; So it is better that we do&nbsp;this now when the system is healthy than wait for a bank failure to occur, even if there is a low probability of that occurring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me address some of the specific points and suggestions which Dr Magad has made.&nbsp; First, on the question of whether and how much cost would be passed on to depositors.&nbsp; This was a key consideration when we designed the scheme - how do you provide adequate protection to depositors but in a cost-effective manner?&nbsp; It is why we designed the scheme to be quite targeted, not to have too broad a coverage.&nbsp; It is why we limited the scheme to only small depositors and also to only Singapore dollar deposits of a standard nature, ie, core savings of depositors.&nbsp; It is also why we have put in features such as ensuring that insured deposits have priority over other deposit liabilities of the bank and why we are requiring foreign bank branches to maintain sufficient assets in Singapore to meet their actual deposits.&nbsp; These measures will help keep the deposit insurance fund low, keep the target size of the fund low and, therefore, keep the cost of the fund on the banks low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The targeted fund size is 0.3% of total insured deposits to be built up over 10 or <p align=left>Column: 1387<p>11 years.&nbsp; So this means that the average annual premium will be about 0.03% of the bank's insured deposits.&nbsp; This is one of the lowest premium rates in the world.&nbsp; If the banks passed on the cost fully to depositors, it would mean a 0.03% charge on a depositor with a $20,000 account.&nbsp; Whether the banks do, in fact, pass on cost and how much of the cost they pass&nbsp;to depositors will be a commercial decision determined in our competitive marketplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Dr Magad suggested that we consider publication of the risk profile of banks here so as to enable depositors to make informed decisions.&nbsp; Banks' credit ratings are currently published and publicly available.&nbsp; I think it is useful for&nbsp;the Deposit Insurance Agency to consider making&nbsp;that more conveniently available to members of the public, for instance, by putting published credit ratings on its website or encouraging the media to carry such ratings.&nbsp; MAS' supervisory ratings, on the other hand, are not and cannot be disclosed because they are based on confidential information obtained in the course of supervision.&nbsp; Making public such information would hinder supervision and make the financial institutions less willing to cooperate fully with the MAS.&nbsp; This is also the practice adopted by reputable supervisors abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Dr Magad's question - an important one - on whether the $20,000 coverage limit was adequate.&nbsp; He noted that it was low compared to some other countries.&nbsp; This is a key issue.&nbsp; Our survey of bank deposits in Singapore has shown that the $20,000 coverage limit will provide full coverage to the vast majority or 87% of individual depositors.&nbsp; This percentage (87%) is well in line with international norms.&nbsp; In fact, the IMF suggests between 80% and 90% of individual depositors be covered.&nbsp; The $20,000 quantum is also fairly similar to <p align=left>Column: 1388<p>that which has been enacted in Hong Kong - they recently passed legislation on their deposit insurance scheme.&nbsp; The marginal benefit of increasing the coverage limit beyond $20,000 is not&nbsp;large.&nbsp; For instance, if we double the coverage to $40,000, it would insure only an additional 7% of depositors.&nbsp; I should also mention that at $20,000, we will be able to cover, in value terms, 40% of the value of individual deposits and this is, in fact, significantly higher than most other countries.&nbsp; Dr Magad's&nbsp;comparison of deposit insurance coverage relative to per capita GDP, the $20,000 figure compared to&nbsp;per capita GDP, is an interesting one.&nbsp; But he has to take into account the fact that we have a CPF system in Singapore.&nbsp; For a significant majority of depositors, a fair proportion of their financial assets are really with the CPF, which is guaranteed by Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the question of whether we should be fixing the coverage limit, in terms of a fixed dollar quantum ($20,000) or whether it should be adjusted annually, as Dr Magad has suggested, for inflation.&nbsp; It is a valid point conceptually.&nbsp; The deposit insurance coverage has to be reviewed from time to time to ensure that it continues to be adequate in real terms.&nbsp; But&nbsp;reviewing the coverage limit on an annual basis will add to administrative complexity and will increase the cost for banks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most countries have a fixed dollar quantum coverage which is reviewed after a number of years.&nbsp; We have assessed that $20,000 is likely to serve us for some time to come, certainly for the next 10 years, and we will review it at a later point in time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Magad also asked about full banks or finance companies being exempted from membership and whether in such circumstance, the MAS should require that they disclose the fact that they have been exempted.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me say that the exemption clause that is provided for in the Bill is unlikely to be operative.&nbsp; It is to <p align=left>Column: 1389<p>allow a foreign full bank that is covered by a deposit insurance scheme in its home jurisdiction which extends comparable protection to Singapore depositors, to be exempted from the Singapore scheme.&nbsp; Currently, there are no financial institutions that will qualify for exemption from membership under our scheme.&nbsp; All full banks and finance companies will be required to be members.&nbsp; However, should there be a case where a foreign institution qualifies for exemption from the Singapore scheme,&nbsp;Dr Magad's suggestion is a useful one.&nbsp; The Deposit Insurance Agency could require the exempted bank or institution to disclose that it is not a member of the Singapore scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be contained in the rules that will be issued by the Deposit Insurance Agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Magad had also raised the question of whether the Government should step in if the deposit insurance fund proves to be insufficient in the extreme situation where the funds are inadequate.&nbsp; First, the deposit insurance fund is adequate for most situations.&nbsp; The risk of bank failure is not zero, but it is very low.&nbsp; And in the rare event that the fund size is inadequate, the Deposit Insurance Agency can borrow to fund potential shortfalls.&nbsp; For example, the Agency can take loans from financial institutions or issue capital market instruments.&nbsp; The MAS may also require Scheme members to contribute additional premium contributions to recapitalise the deposit insurance fund.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Magad noted that simultaneous bank failures are a remote event.&nbsp; They are remote.&nbsp; Actuarial computation has shown that the fund size of about $120 million or 0.3% of matured deposits will be sufficient 99.9% of the time.&nbsp; It will not be appropriate or desirable to provide in advance for the very remote event&nbsp;of simultaneous bank failures.&nbsp; Providing for this in advance will send the wrong signals and could lead to moral hazard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ahmad suggested that the Bill should provide for payouts to be taken <p align=left>Column: 1390<p>within a specified period of time, say, three months.&nbsp; The Deposit Insurance Agency will make every effort to make depositor payout as speedily as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;We envisage that it should be able to make payout sooner than within three months after a bank failure.&nbsp; But I agree it will eventually be good practice for the Deposit Insurance Agency to commit to making payouts within a specified period of time.&nbsp; We are new to this scheme.&nbsp; Let us set up the scheme and explore this issue at a further point.&nbsp; Other new deposit insurance schemes, such as the one in Hong Kong, also do not specify in legislation the time period within which payout has to be made.&nbsp; But let us consider this later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Dr Ahmad raised the issue of legal immunity for the Deposit Insurance Agency and its officers.&nbsp; He felt it was over-protective and not very transparent.&nbsp; It is important for the Agency and its officers to be given immunity from personal liability since they are performing a public function.&nbsp; But the legal protection clause for the Deposit Insurance Agency and its officers does not offer blanket immunity.&nbsp; It only covers acts done in good faith.&nbsp; It does not, for instance, cover fraudulent acts or intentional and wilful misconduct.&nbsp; I should reiterate also that the Board of the Deposit Insurance Agency will be accountable to the Minister in charge of MAS for its acts and decisions.&nbsp; The financial statements of the Deposit Insurance Agency would be audited.&nbsp; It will be required to prepare and submit its annual report and estimates of income and expenditure of</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

&nbsp;Sir, the Education Endowment Scheme (EES) Act establishes the Edusave Pupils Fund (EPF) with the aim of enhancing citizen pupils' education.&nbsp; It provides citizen pupils with an Edusave account and yearly contributions if they are between 6 and 16 years of age and studying in primary schools, secondary schools, special education schools and ITE.&nbsp; Pupils can use funds from the Edusave account to pay approved fees and enrichment programme charges.&nbsp; The current Edusave Pupils Fund contribution rate is $170 for pupils in primary schools and special education schools and $200 for pupils who are studying in secondary schools and ITE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his 2005 Budget Statement, the Prime Minister announced a special top-up of $100 to be made to the Edusave accounts of eligible pupils. Section 7(1) of the Education Endowment Scheme&nbsp;Act&nbsp;currently allows for the Edusave Pupils Fund&nbsp;to be funded from income of the Edusave Endowment Fund.&nbsp; However, it does not provide for the Edusave Pupils Fund&nbsp;to be funded via a direct injection of funds from the Government.&nbsp; Thus, in order to allow for special top-ups to be made to the Edusave account of each <p align=left>Column: 1392<p>eligible pupil, section 7(1) of the Education Endowment Scheme&nbsp;Act has to be amended to allow the Government to inject funds directly into the Edusave Pupils Fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"center\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal\">[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr S Iswaran) in the Chair]</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.05 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, the amendments proposed in the Bill will allow for special top-ups to be made to the Edusave accounts of eligible pupils by the Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam].</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:COMMUNITY CARE ENDOWMENT FUND BILL--><p align=left>Column: 1392<p>\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>COMMUNITY CARE ENDOWMENT FUND BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">time.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Objectives of the Bill</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill seeks to establish the Community Care Endowment Fund.&nbsp; This fund was first announced by the Prime Minister in January 2005 in Parliament.

ComCare aims to help Singaporeans in a way that will enable them to stand on their own two feet eventually. Our objective is to help the needy to become self-reliant, to help the children from needy families break out of the poverty trap, to maximise the potential of the disabled so that they can be contributing members of our society, and to provide community care and support for those who need&nbsp;long-term assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be new money for new programmes. We will also streamline our existing assistance programmes. We will review the processes so that needy Singaporeans can receive help faster, and in a more effective manner. The Community Development Councils, together with the grassroots and community organisations, being closer to the ground, will be empowered to exercise more</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">flexibility to&nbsp;deliver these assistance programmes for needy Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ComCare Fund complements the other elements of Singapore's social safety net, such as Medifund, Edusave and the Lifelong Learning Fund. With economic restructuring and globalisation, a small but growing minority of Singaporeans will face economic hardships from time to time. ComCare will provide a safety net for this small group. It will focus on addressing the social and financial needs of these Singaporeans and their families, in particular the medically unfit, the severely disabled and the frail elderly. It will aim to look at the underlying problems faced by the needy and address them in a holistic manner. ComCare will be based on mutual responsibility. It will help those who are <p align=left>Column: 1394<p>willing to do their part to help themselves. ComCare will complement the Workfare programme by focusing on the social support needed to enable low wage workers, especially women, to return to work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>ComCare Budget</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ComCare will provide up to $55 million a year for assistance schemes. Apart from supporting the existing nationwide social assistance schemes which are administered by the CDCs, $10 million from this $55 million&nbsp;budget will go towards 'seed money' for pilot programmes initiated by the CDCs, the grassroots organisations&nbsp;or the voluntary welfare organisations. Another $4 million will be set aside for the Citizens' Consultative Committees&nbsp;to exercise flexibility in&nbsp;helping genuinely needy residents who may&nbsp;not strictly meet the criteria for social assistance programmes, or to set up local programmes to help the specific needs of their&nbsp;residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Provisions in the Bill</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me now address the key provisions of the Bill. The ComCare Fund will consist of money from the Consolidated Fund and the Community Assistance Fund, which currently supports a number of social assistance schemes.

It&nbsp;puts in place a more solid framework for social welfare, both in terms of the amount that we can extend to those who need it and the flexibility with which we can deliver it.&nbsp; The fund size will eventually grow to $1 billion and the grassroots organisations, such as the CDCs and CCCs, will be given the task of targeting delivery specifically to those who need it most.&nbsp; This development indeed is a significant milestone for us in&nbsp;the way we want to move forward to help those who need help.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am glad and cheered by the</p>\r\n</P></span></div>   \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>setting up of the Community Care Endowment Fund or ComCare Fund which&nbsp;is now finally underway, the timely introduction of this Bill gives rise to an occasion for us to consider further issues that are associated with it.&nbsp; Unfortunately,&nbsp;the introduction of the legislation is not going to banish forever some issues relating to the poor and needy in our society.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will touch on three broad themes today.&nbsp; These are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; The short-term nature of financial assistance;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; A realistic assessment of needs; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; A proper measure of the effectiveness of the ComCare Fund in achieving what it sets out to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First,&nbsp;the short-term nature of financial assistance.&nbsp; Sir, as the saying goes, \"It never rains but pours.\"&nbsp; When bills come to those who are in financial hardship, they all seem to come at the same time.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1397<p> In the course of our MPS, almost all of us would inevitably come across cases of residents for whom the prospect of financial stability on their own may just not be possible.&nbsp; Let me pull out just one of the many that I have on my record.&nbsp; I have a resident who is over 60 years of age.&nbsp; He has a wife and two sons.&nbsp; Both sons are mentally unsound and are thus&nbsp;unable to find work.&nbsp; The father is past retirement age and, even if he wanted to, would be unable to find work on account of his poor health.&nbsp; Without an income and relatives they can rely on, it is evidently clear that they are not able to support themselves by working, and that they would require long-term intervention.&nbsp; Unfortunately, under our schemes, we do not typically put families on long-term support unless they qualify for public assistance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are not many who qualify for long-term public assistance based on our rather stringent criteria, and there are many who fall through the gap.&nbsp; For instance, in the whole of the North East CDC, there are, as of now, only about 168 families who qualify for long-term public assistance.&nbsp; This is out of a total of 205,000&nbsp;families in North East CDC.&nbsp; If it is true, Sir, it is unfortunate.&nbsp; It cannot be that there are so few numbers of destitute families that require the state to look after them in the long term.&nbsp; It would appear that, for the majority, the main solution to their financial problem may not be interim assistance.&nbsp; For now, interim assistance seems the most available form of assistance.&nbsp; What happens then is that the resident is left with having to come every three months to the MPS to ask for financial support.&nbsp; Why put the family on short-term assistance when it is evidently clear that the family requires long-term intervention, even if they do not on the surface meet the strict requirements?&nbsp; Why are we so hesitant in putting more families on longer-term support?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incidentally, apart from some food items and vouchers, the monetary support <p align=left>Column: 1398<p>that we give to a family comes in the form of allowances of between $100 and $150 per month.&nbsp; Realistically, for an unemployed family of four adults, this is really not enough, even including other forms of intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, a realistic assessment of needs.&nbsp; Sir, I am glad to note that the Minister has pointed out that the ComCare Fund will seek to address the holistic needs of those who are in need of assistance in Singapore.&nbsp; But that begs the question: what exactly are our needs and how do we define these needs?&nbsp; How much financial assistance should the State be giving before it is considered adequate?&nbsp; The conventional wisdom appears to be that our assistance should be placed at a level that is just below the comfort level.&nbsp; Sir, I have no quarrel with that principle.&nbsp; However, the question really is: just what should be the comfort level for Singaporeans?&nbsp; Should a middle-class family with young children attending enrichment classes now be required to stop these classes immediately simply because both parents are out of a job and are seeking public support?&nbsp; Should the children of poor families be given some form of assistance so that they can get a chance to travel and also share the meaningful experience as their other friends who are blessed with better opportunities?&nbsp; For that matter, should these children be denied rights to toys and other useful accessories simply because their parents are too poor, or should the children of these families be given proper food supplements to ensure that their physical development is not affected simply on account of their parents' inability to pay for these items?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While many may see the needs as being relative, I would submit that there are some requirements today that would and should be seen as essential items, as opposed to being treated as luxuries, which they may well be the case 10 years <p align=left>Column: 1399<p>earlier.&nbsp; The examples I cited relate more importantly to the needs of children.&nbsp; Very often, and unfortunately, when parents fall into hard times, it is the children who suffer.&nbsp; The experience that these children go through will no doubt toughen them mentally.&nbsp; Yet, at the same time, for many, their circumstances will also put them at a distinct disadvantage in this highly competitive society.&nbsp; While I laud the achievements of those who are able to break out of the cycle of poverty and recount their stories at the height of their career success - which unfortunately tends to be more the exception than the rule -&nbsp;let us also spare a thought for those who could have got much further in life but for the limited opportunities that they had.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that part of the remit of the ComCare Fund is committed to ensuring that the educational needs of the poor and needy children are taken care of.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question really is whether grassroots organisations are sufficiently focused on targeting the needs of these children to ensure that the concerns that I have just mentioned are properly addressed in a holistic manner.&nbsp; The simpler solution is to target their needs that are most obvious and easiest to solve, ie, pocket money, school transport, school fees, and so on.&nbsp; I believe that there is no one who can truly say that the holistic needs are taken care of, as opposed to sporadic needs, if we just did that.&nbsp; We want to ensure that our assistance is effective and, in many cases, would help a child break out of the cycle of poverty.&nbsp; So, I am heartened to note that the principle underlying the ComCare Fund is to ensure a holistic approach to helping the poor and needy.&nbsp; But let us just spare a thought about applying this when we implement the Fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, a proper measure of the&nbsp;ComCare Fund.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much money will be <p align=left>Column: 1400<p>dispensed under the ComCare Fund in the coming days to the poor and needy.&nbsp; While we applaud and laud the giving of substantial financial assistance to those who require help, we should also ask ourselves whether or not we should expect more appropriate governance and measurable objectives and outcomes from such commitments.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two issues that we need to consider really, if we want to go down this route.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; The manner in which the money is disbursed, how it is accounted for by those who give it away; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; How we can go about assessing every programme, in terms of the performance index, to ensure that the money is properly spent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the first issue, the recent saga involving the National Kidney Foundation clearly demonstrates a need for strong governance, if we want to prevent another failure of similar proportion.&nbsp; At the moment, CCCs are given only $33,000 to give out as interim assistance.&nbsp; The CDCs, on the other hand, are given more funds at their disposal.&nbsp; The guidelines given merely set out the broad compass by which the funds may be used.&nbsp; It does not give sufficient guidance other than just some examples of how money should be spent.&nbsp; To give an example:&nbsp; should the ComCare Fund be allowed to blow $30,000 on a grand event to promote the various public assistance schemes?&nbsp; Should there not be an avenue of appeal to the committee for hardship cases who are unsuccessful, so as to provide the assurance that full consideration has been given?&nbsp; And, related to this point, should the decision whether or not to give financial assistance be left in the hands of managers alone?&nbsp; Are they guided by appropriate advice from social workers?&nbsp; Should we also set an appropriate benchmark of responsiveness for CDC with regard to applications for financial assistance from the residents?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1401<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of my work at the constituency, I have often heard complaints about lack of responsiveness from the welfare agencies.&nbsp; Granted that some forms may not be complete but, surely, incomplete information alone cannot account for the long response time that the agencies take to respond.&nbsp; It is not uncommon to hear sometimes how these agencies may take up to three months to respond.&nbsp; And, if it is true, I will be very concerned indeed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving on, I did mention earlier that we need to move towards adopting a performance measurement index to help us focus on the way in which we spend the money.&nbsp; I would like to remind us here in this House, Sir, that we need to move away from the mindset that ComCare Fund is welfare hand-out to the poor and needy Singaporeans and permanent residents.&nbsp; To do that would be to demean them and would rob them of their sense of dignity.&nbsp; We should see payments out of the ComCare Fund as investments in social capital that will ultimately yield results for the long-term good of our country.&nbsp; Seen from this perspective, the financial support that the community gives out, whether it be the CCC or the CDC, is not incidental and isolated but rather linked to the larger question of how best to assist the person concerned so that he or his family can be lifted out of the poverty trap and be of use to society.&nbsp; For instance, the KiFAS should not be positioned as only helping to pay the school fees of the poor children but rather as a programme to enhance the learning capacity of the child so that he or she can get an even chance of competing in society.&nbsp; Equally, when it comes to providing welfare grants, the approach should be to use the money to set up an appropriate framework that would allow the welfare recipients to work, even if the income is somewhat subsidised through the ComCare Fund, than to give the money outright.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this principle <p align=left>Column: 1402<p>may not be applied in every instance, it at least provides the appropriate perspective by which one would view how assistance should be rendered and one which would allow us to effectively measure the outcome of what we put in by way of assistance, something which I will elaborate on later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is perhaps our desire to want to be flexible with the ComCare Fund that we have worded the parameter of assistance broadly to include financial and other difficulties.&nbsp; As to what \"other difficulties\" meant, one would suppose would depend very much on the exigencies on the ground from time to time, as it would be rather difficult to tell in advance.&nbsp; However, in keeping the legislation broad and flexible, we also run into the risk that there is not enough guidance from Parliament on how the money should be spent and, with it, the attendant risk of abuse.&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be and can be avoided, if there are provisions in the main body of legislation that allow for guidance in some form of circulars or subsidiary legislation for MCYS as to what constitute \"other difficulties\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment, there is much concern over the way in which charity money is spent by those in whose hands&nbsp;lies the responsibility of spending.&nbsp; In the case of welfare assistance, if one were to look at it, it would be easy to give a proper explanation of it, so long as we are able to show that the money was given to the poor or is used to help those who are in difficulty.&nbsp; If we did that at the grassroots level and even at the Government level, one could not be faulted.&nbsp; However, if we did that, are we being honest with ourselves in the way we want to help those in need?&nbsp; This attitude seems synonymous with a person just continually giving small sums of money to those who see him and send him away without actually applying his mind as to <p align=left>Column: 1403<p>how welfare recipients can properly be helped to be financially independent in the longer term.&nbsp; We have heard the common and popular saying that we do not just want to give him fish&nbsp;which is good only for the day but rather teach him to fish so that he will have fish for a lifetime.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no doubt that the objective of the ComCare Fund is to enable families and those in need to look after themselves.&nbsp; However, if we are not careful, we could fall into the trap of just giving the fish and not teaching the recipient to fish.&nbsp; The $500 million - and subsequently&nbsp;$1 billion - is a fairly substantial sum to be giving away over a period of time.&nbsp; What would be remiss on our part would be to give away the money without being in a position to determine for ourselves just how effective the giving has been to those in need, whether overall the quality and conditions of our general poor and needy have improved over&nbsp;a period of time.&nbsp; In other words, we need to develop a proper measure of effectiveness and framework of accountability for the ComCare Fund programme overall, and I hope that the Government will come up with one in due course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, finally, it would be wrong of me, as Chairman of the GPC for MCYS, not to register my deep appreciation and thanks to the Government, in particular the Prime Minister, for sincerely trying to help the poor and needy in Singapore.&nbsp; When I think of the Fund, I can think of the family in my constituency whose father is a dialysis patient, mother is diagnosed with cancer, both of whom are not working and with a child in primary school.&nbsp; The money from the Fund would go a long way for them.&nbsp; I can also think of the family I mentioned at the beginning of my speech.&nbsp; At least, as their MP, I can give them the assurance that their father, who is in his late 60s, does not have to worry <p align=left>Column: 1404<p>about having to go out to work so that he can support his two sons who are mentally unwell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are many more families that I am sure each of my colleagues in this House can recall.&nbsp; For each family, the ComCare Fund will provide some relief and help to help carry a part of that burden.&nbsp; In doing so, we are telling fellow Singaporeans that this Government cares for them and is prepared to walk the talk with them, unlike so many other countries that we know of.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with that, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</B> Sir, before I begin, let me declare my interest as the Mayor of South West District and also a member of the ComCare Supervisory Committee.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the establishment of the ComCare Fund could not have come too soon.&nbsp; Back in 2000, a study by the Department of Statistics showed that income disparity began to increase in 1999, a significant departure from earlier periods when household income distribution remained relatively unchanged.&nbsp; This increase in income disparity stemmed from an increase in the number of&nbsp; households in the lower income brackets.&nbsp; That was the start of an ominous trend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two recent surveys by the Department of Statistics and the HDB have confirmed this observation.&nbsp; Both surveys showed&nbsp; that income for the bottom 20% of households fell in the last few years even as overall average incomes went up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet another aspect of the seriousness of this situation came from MOM's&nbsp;recently-released job employment statistics.&nbsp; The latest figures show that whilst the job creation rate for the first half of this year hit a four and a half year high of 49,600 new jobs added compared <p align=left>Column: 1405<p>to 24,600 for the same period last year, the jobless rate of workers aged 40 years and above and with below secondary education actually increased from 5.9% to 6.8% in the 12-month period ending June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The widening income gap, if not managed, has serious social repercussions and will lead to increasing tension between the have lots and the have nots.&nbsp; The setting up of the ComCare Endowment Fund to provide assistance to the lowest income groups so that no needy child, elderly poor or disabled would be left without community care and support indicates the Government's recognition of the seriousness of this issue.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the perspective of a Government that has hitherto religiously shunned any semblance of welfarism, it also signals an acceptance that many more Singaporeans than before need assistance, whether on a short-term or longer-term basis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to comment on four key features of the ComCare Fund and the considerations that ought to be taken into account in its implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the independence of the ComCare Budget and topping up of the ComCare Endowment Fund.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key intent of the ComCare Fund,&nbsp;to&nbsp;dispense help to the less</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>fortunate and assist&nbsp;them to become self-reliant again without breeding a crutch or entitlement mentality and to delink the funds needed for social assistance from the Government's budget, is a practical and sensible arrangement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is also in contrast to the social assistance schemes of many other countries, who have depleted their treasuries or led to high income taxes due to well-meaning but poorly structured welfare schemes which are open to abuse.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1406<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Minister earlier noted, the setting up of the ComCare Endowment Fund, as an independent fund, means that&nbsp; this amount is sheltered from any adverse fluctuations of the economy.&nbsp; Other programmes may be cut during periods of economic downturn, but it is precisely during such difficult times that poorer households need the most help.&nbsp; This is yet another acknowledgement by the Government of the need to have more sustained and focused efforts to help our less fortunate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, and as provided for in the Bill, the Government should consider topping up this Endowment Fund whenever the economy permits, even after the initial target of $1 billion is reached.&nbsp; Since the fund's namesake is \"ComCare\", or short form for Community Care, the community could also be roped in to raise funds to enlarge the sum available for rendering social assistance.&nbsp; This way, the community would truly feel a part of this movement to allow itself to help the less able in its midst.&nbsp; In this respect, the Government should work with NCSS to rationalise such fund-raising efforts from individuals and corporates so as not to generate donor fatigue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Periodic augmentation of the fund is necessary to take into account inflation, depletion of incomes or reduction in returns from a weak investment environment, long term increases in the cost of living and the likelihood that the needs of the less fortunate segment of our population could increase in the future, in view of our rapidly ageing population and the persistence of structural unemployment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly,&nbsp;constant monitoring and review of qualifying criteria for social assistance schemes.&nbsp; The Government should also regularly review the qualifying criteria for many of the national social <p align=left>Column: 1407<p>assistance schemes, chief of which would be the cut-off monthly&nbsp; income&nbsp;or per capita, which is currently at $1,500 per month or $450 per capita&nbsp; for most schemes.&nbsp; Already, there are not an insignificant number of feedback and appeals for various social assistance schemes to be extended to those with household incomes of more than $1,500 or per capita of more than $450 per month, as there are households with incomes above this level who are genuinely struggling to make ends meet.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A unique feature of the ComCare Fund is allowing for a \"flexible\" fund component to be administered by the ground, ie, at the grassroots level.&nbsp; This \"flexible\" ComCare Fund is to allow the grassroots, who know and understand the needs of the residents more intimately, to render more timely \"stop-gap\" assistance before referring the cases to the CDCs for more detailed evaluation and assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also allows the grassroots&nbsp; to help those who may not qualify under the existing national schemes administered by the CDCs on behalf of the relevant Government agencies, but who are in genuine need of help.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the present moment, those who fall outside the key qualifying criteria may be assisted, but on a case-by-case and piecemeal basis.&nbsp; But the Government should undertake regular evaluation and studies to determine if the income ceiling or per capita for the schemes, for instance, should be raised due to rising costs, and so on.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, I would like to ask the Minister how the key qualifying criteria, such as the income ceiling for the various national schemes, are determined, and if a systematic review mechanism is already&nbsp; in place to monitor the relevance, effectiveness and appropriateness of <p align=left>Column: 1408<p>these schemes and their main qualifying criteria.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If not, would the Minister be setting up a proper review mechanism as well as conduct studies to monitor and evaluate these schemes?&nbsp; One suggestion would be to peg the criteria to, say, the Consumer Price Index of the lowest 20 percentile of households.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly,&nbsp;welfare and workfare.&nbsp; The Government has recently identified \"workfare\" and not \"welfare\"&nbsp; as a strategy to help low income workers so as to preserve the strong work ethic that has prevailed and avoid&nbsp;breeding a welfare dependency syndrome.&nbsp; It wants to send the message that work is the best way to assist people.&nbsp; Hence, the Government will render assistance, but only if these low wage workers make the effort to find and keep jobs and upgrade their skills to earn more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister for Manpower, Dr Ng Eng Hen, who chairs the Ministerial Committee on Low Wage Workers, noted that only those who really cannot work and do not have family support will get welfare.&nbsp; He also said that ComCare will continue to serve as a safety net for those who are truly needy but physically and mentally incapable of work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is hard to argue against the philosophy underlying the workfare strategy and I must say that I fully endorse this more targeted and sustainable approach to helping the low income families.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, I feel that there are instances where the welfare component of workfare, for it is undeniable that there is a welfare component, may play a more important role and could need greater expansion in scope than what is currently available.&nbsp; For instance, there are groups of people who face genuine constraints in skills upgrading, thus seriously limiting <p align=left>Column: 1409<p>their ability to earn more. These could be, amongst others,&nbsp;some of the disabled and educationally sub-normal who, even if they can find work, cannot earn enough for a decent living.&nbsp; Secondly, those with&nbsp;psychiatric problems and have been past patients of the IMH&nbsp;and who have extreme difficulty finding work, as well as,&nbsp;thirdly,&nbsp;single parents and families where it is not possible for both parents to work for various genuine reasons, like inability to find affordable and appropriate childcare, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are compelling reasons for such groups to receive longer term welfare as it could take some time, if at all possible, before they can become self-reliant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, social assistance schemes provided under ComCare are&nbsp;available generally on a short-term basis and reviewed every three months, as my colleague, Mr Sin Boon Ann, has noted earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the circumstances of the foregoing groups of people are unlikely to change after three months or, for that matter,&nbsp;three years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, longer term financial assistance would be more relevant for them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst the recent announcement of a CPF top-up for low income families to help them own their HDB flat is useful, the more urgent need for many poor families is actually to provide for the basic needs of their family, such as food on the table, paying their utility bills, etc.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such assistance schemes could be reviewed on a longer term basis,&nbsp;say, on a yearly basis, for this group of people.&nbsp; I therefore feel that whilst we want to avoid a crutch mentality, there is a need to also look at some expansion of the welfare scheme&nbsp; to embrace those who are in genuine need and are unlikely to become self-reliant in the short to medium term.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the assistance schemes offered under workfare should be carefully <p align=left>Column: 1410<p>considered and packaged to synergise and/or dovetail with the help provided under the ComCare to avoid confusion and waste.&nbsp; We would also need to allow for some flexibility in the implementation of these workfare schemes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, enlisting the help of the community.&nbsp; Whilst the decentralisation of social assistance schemes from the Ministry to the CDCs has generally improved the delivery of such assistance to the needy, the ComCare Fund takes this a step further as it recognises that the grassroots are closest to the ground and hence should be even more effective in identifying those in need in&nbsp;a community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, the residents in the constituency could assist in identifying and alerting, say,&nbsp;the relevant grassroots and/or CDC of anyone who is in need in the community.&nbsp; Appropriate and timely help could then be provided to the residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This morning, I read with a heavy heart the case of an elderly couple who have apparently made their home in a multi-storey carpark in Woodlands&nbsp;for the last six months as reported in the press, <I>Today</I>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their reasons for doing so are, I think, still under investigation.&nbsp; Nonetheless, this reinforces the continuous need to&nbsp;raise the awareness of the general public and enlist their cooperation to inform the relevant CDC or grassroots of such cases as soon as they are detected so that timely help can be dispatched.&nbsp;&nbsp;Though such unfortunate cases are, thankfully, quite infrequent, we do read of them from time to time in the press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst efforts to raise public awareness on where social assistance can be sought have been undertaken by the Ministry together with&nbsp; the CDCs and the grassroots organisations, it would appear <p align=left>Column: 1411<p>that even more concerted efforts are needed to educate the public on where they can seek financial and other social assistance for themselves or their fellow constituents.&nbsp; Like our battle against SARS and now, dengue, our fight against poverty also needs the joint effort of the public.&nbsp; To borrow a quote from a resident commenting on her fight against dengue, which I feel is equally applicable in this instance, I quote, \"No matter how much the Government promotes this, (she is referring to dengue while I am referring to community self-help), it is up to the public to practise it.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, I wish to note that the CDCs have been adopting more proactive approaches to identify and help the needy in the community.&nbsp; These include providing training programmes to the grassroots to help them assess the circumstances of those who seek help and better identify the type of help needed.&nbsp; At South West CDC, for instance, we are also reaching out to families whose children are on the Kindergarten Financial Assistance Scheme to assess if they are in need of other help, such as employment assistance and so on, even though they may not have&nbsp;sought further assistance in this area.&nbsp; It could be that they are still unaware of the various forms of assistance available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, we would also need to encourage and enlist more residents, particularly those with a passion to help the less fortunate, to step forward to&nbsp; be our eyes and ears and identify those who need help in the community.&nbsp;&nbsp; This would be aligned with the objectives of the ComCare Fund which is to show that the community cares for its less able and would render assistance to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, I applaud the Government's move to set up the ComCare Fund.&nbsp; It acknowledges the need <p align=left>Column: 1412<p>for more resources and efforts to be directed to assist the less fortunate in our society.&nbsp; The twin forces of globalisation and technology that we so heartily embrace as the means for our future prosperity are also the very forces that can tear apart our social fabric. We need a compassionate counter to the brutality of these twin forces. The establishment of the ComCare Fund and helping low wage workers through workfare are clearly steps in the right direction towards PM Lee's vision of a more inclusive, compassionate and more resilient society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Sir, I rise in support of the ComCare Endowment Fund Bill.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Prime Minister announced that the Government will be establishing a ComCare Fund to help needy Singaporeans and their families, there were a lot of expectations. As a result, some of us have seen a spike in the number of cases coming to our meet-the-people sessions for help.&nbsp; I am not quite sure whether the message to the ground is clearer now, but the objectives were clearly defined by our Prime Minister when he launched the ComCare Fund a few months ago.&nbsp; He said that ComCare aims to help the needy help themselves and work towards being able to support themselves and their families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an important point. We have to ensure that we do not create a welfare-dependent mentality. At the same time, we have to ensure that those who receive help can do so with pride and dignity as they know that their efforts to help themselves will reap benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the most effective way of ensuring that our needy&nbsp;are self-reliant is to make sure that they have jobs and can support their families.&nbsp; Currently, one group that finds it particularly difficult to <p align=left>Column: 1413<p>continue working or to re-enter the workforce are mothers with young children, particularly single mothers. They need a more&nbsp; comprehensive and holistic range of services than what is currently provided if we want to make sure that they can work and do not have to depend on welfare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to urge the MCYS to critically re-examine our existing social support schemes to make it easier for mothers to work.&nbsp; If we were to look at the statistics, the signs are&nbsp;not encouraging.&nbsp; Women's labour force participation rate reaches a peak at the rate of 85% for those aged 25-29 and then begins to decline as&nbsp;a number withdraw from the workforce after marriage and childbirth.&nbsp; Hence, only about 61.9% of the women in the age group of 45-49 remain economically active, compared to their male counterparts, which is 96%.&nbsp; This figure continues to decline to 53% for those in the 50-54 age group, compared to their male counterparts, which is 93%, and 40% for those in the 55-59 age group, compared to their male counterparts, which is 78%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In contrast, in countries with a stronger system of state assistance, they have seen a rise in the number of women in the workforce.&nbsp; France, for example, has the highest rate in the EU of female employment and professional activity.&nbsp; 80% of French women between the age of 24-49 work, including those with children less than three years of age.&nbsp; The strong social support system in France has not only benefited women and their employment market. France, together with Ireland, has the highest birth rate in the European Union - 1.9 children per woman as against a 25-nation EU average of 1.4.&nbsp; This is possible because of state assistance which enables working women to have a second or&nbsp;third child without damaging their family budget.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1414<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1970s, the French government expanded free full-time municipal&nbsp;creches, free public pre-kindergartens and canteens were vastly increased in number&nbsp;as well as subsidised vacation colonies during the summer and winter school holidays.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are&nbsp;also State financial incentives, family allowances, support for volunteer creches formed by groups of mothers</p>\r\n</P></span></div>  \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>and family tax benefits, many of which increase significantly with a third child.&nbsp; As one newspaper report described it, all these had an important psychological and practical effect, legitimising the decision of young mothers to go back to work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we are in agreement that having more than one breadwinner in the family is important in today's context.&nbsp; I believe that this has also been identified as one important strategy in helping low-income families.&nbsp; A working mother will help to strengthen the family's financial situation.&nbsp; Many low-income families suffer not only from income instability but also job insecurity.&nbsp; A lot of the jobs performed by low-income workers are more precarious, subject to outsourcing or are casual or short-term in nature.&nbsp; These are also jobs that are subject to intense pressure from international competition which, in turn, has an impact on the wage levels.&nbsp; So a working mother will help to reduce the insecurity that the family faces in the event that the father loses his job or something happens to him.&nbsp; There is at least a buffer for the family. However, the existing support structure that we have is, in my view, inadequate to help mothers with young children to continue working, or those who are not working to re-enter the workforce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just cite a few examples, Sir.&nbsp; We have schemes, such as KiFAS or the Kindergarten Financial Assistance Scheme, under which mothers can get up to $65 subsidy per month for putting their children in&nbsp;a kindergarten.&nbsp; Another scheme is the CFAC or the Centre-based Financial Assistance Scheme for Childcare <p align=left>Column: 1415<p>to help low-income mothers who work.&nbsp; Such schemes are good, Sir.&nbsp; But, again, what we suffer from is that we tend to look at such schemes in isolation.&nbsp; As a result, there are gaps in the kind of assistance that is provided to working mothers.&nbsp; For instance, a mother with two children&nbsp; -&nbsp; one of kindergarten age and the other of school-going age&nbsp; -&nbsp; will still encounter problems.&nbsp; Her younger child may be placed in a kindergarten so that she can work but there will be no one to take care of her older primary school child before or after he comes back from school when she is still working.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are bodies providing before-and-after-school care services, but these are not extensive enough.&nbsp; Moreover, the privately-run before-and-after-school care centres are too expensive for low-income families.&nbsp; Currently, the MCYS subsidises this service,&nbsp; but the subsidy is given only to before-and-after-school care centres run by the VWOs.&nbsp; There are not enough of such services run by VWOs all over the island.&nbsp; Therefore, this service remains unaffordable as well as inaccessible to mothers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime ago, Sir, I raised a question in Parliament over whether the MCYS would consider giving the subsidy to all before-and-after-school care providers, much like how we treat the kindergarten service instead of confining the subsidy only to VWOs.&nbsp; The MCYS' response, at that time, was that it would look into the matter, but there has not been much progress since then.&nbsp; I hope that this is one area where we can see some improvement with the establishment of the ComCare Fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another difficulty, Sir, for low-income mothers is that there are no childcare services after 7 pm.&nbsp; This is indeed one gap in the provision of service for working mothers as we have a 24-7 economy <p align=left>Column: 1416<p>where shift work is very common.&nbsp; This makes it difficult for mothers who have no one to take care of their young children to perform the graveyard shift and therefore limit their job opportunities.&nbsp; Why is there no childcare operator operating at night?&nbsp; The answer is probably because it is not commercially viable due to the low volume and extra cost involved. Whatever may be the reason, this absence of childcare facilities at night for working mothers is a long standing issue and is one of the gaps that we should address.&nbsp; I hope that the Ministry will look into this matter and together with the childcare operators as well as VWOs&nbsp;suggest some solutions on how to provide for this need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now come to my next point, Sir, and that is the case of mothers who are neither really low-income nor high-income who are sandwiched in between.&nbsp; For low-income mothers, there is the CFAC to help them pay for childcare fees.&nbsp; But the CFAC applies only to mothers whose household income does not exceed $1,500.&nbsp; Hence, mothers who are in the lower middle income range do not benefit from this subsidy.&nbsp; So a mother with a household income of $2,000 will not enjoy the CFAC, although if she has two children in a childcare centre, the cost will be too high for her and it may not make it worthwhile for her to work.&nbsp; I would like to suggest that the Ministry consider reviewing the household income and raise it to a more realistic level so that more mothers can go out to work and strengthen their families' financial position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Ministry should also consider reviewing the&nbsp;$150 subsidy that is currently given to every child of a working mother who is placed in a childcare centre.&nbsp; This subsidy was fixed for quite sometime now, and I think that it is appropriate that this subsidy be reviewed to a more realistic level so that more mothers can benefit from it.&nbsp; If the whole <p align=left>Column: 1417<p>idea is to encourage mothers to work in order to raise the quality of life and income levels of families, it is time the Government reviewed this subsidy and increased the amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would also like to urge employers to be more open and receptive to flexible work schemes at the workplace.&nbsp; The number of employers that have implemented flexible work schemes in Singapore remains small despite tripartite efforts and even with some Government funding.&nbsp; In 2004, there were only 39,700 private sector employers who were involved in flexible work schemes.&nbsp; Employers can do a lot more to make it possible for their female workers to continue working as well as enable others who are not currently in the workforce because of difficulties of balancing work and family to work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill but I wish to reiterate that there is a need for a more comprehensive, holistic and integrated range of services to help low-income mothers stay in the workforce as part of the overall strategy to break the poverty cycle in Singapore.&nbsp; I think the crux of the issue is this.&nbsp; We understand that if mothers work, this could help raise the family income and improve their quality of life.&nbsp; Also, this will help to strengthen the work ethics and provide positive role models for the young.&nbsp; However, without an adequate support structure, mothers will not be able to work.&nbsp; Or if they do so, their young children may be neglected, causing a whole range of other problems in the future.&nbsp; Hence, I urge a critical re-examination of our existing support schemes so that we can identify the gaps, assess new needs and be more effective in helping low-income mothers stay in the workforce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</B> Sir, first, I would like to commend the Minister for setting up the ComCare Fund.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1418<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a timely move, given the social and labour trends, and reassures Singaporeans who need help that they will not be left to struggle alone as Singapore progresses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, of particular note is the initiative under the ComCare programme to engage the community, especially the Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCCs) to deliver assistance.&nbsp; This is most welcome, as the grassroots organisations are more in tune with the needs of the residents and can help residents more quickly without too much red tape.&nbsp; For this purpose, about $33,000 is given to each CCC to disburse to deserving cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, if I may put up a little red flag, since the ComCare Fund was announced in early June and the CCC ComCare Fund was set up, my CCC and I think others also in other wards have observed a spike in the number of residents coming forward for help.&nbsp; Not all can be said to be deserving cases.&nbsp; Indeed, before the CCC ComCare Fund was set up, my ward usually saw about 10 residents seeking financial help every month.&nbsp; After the ComCare Fund was announced in late June, we saw a sudden jump to almost 50 cases for the month of July.&nbsp; But to our relief, it then tapered down to about 14 cases in August.&nbsp; This is the trend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have to be careful in how we disburse the ComCare Fund, which is public money, and make sure Singaporeans do not develop a hand-out mentality.&nbsp; This has been stressed but I think it&nbsp;bears repeating.&nbsp; At the same time, we must make sure that residents who need help get the help they need, and this is not always only financial assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to make three points.&nbsp; First, we need to send and reinforce the message that the CCC ComCare Fund is <p align=left>Column: 1419<p>only for needy, short-term cases, an interim stop-gap measure to tide over difficult periods such as a sudden loss of job or medical illness or the loss of a breadwinner.&nbsp; It is like an emergency fund, a last-resort fund when all else fails.&nbsp; It is not for long-term support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am glad to hear the Minister stress mutual responsibility, and it is worth emphasising because we have seen cases in Tampines-Changkat and I am sure also in other wards, where some residents expect unconditional financial support for more than three months.&nbsp; In fact, if they do not get it, they come back to&nbsp;us and they threaten suicide and sometimes threaten to see the PM.&nbsp; Some cases are intractable as they are unable to find a job, and even if they do find a job, they find that the pay is too low to raise a family on, often less than $800 a month, some even citing less than $500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have referred many cases to the CDC for jobs and also for longer-term financial support, but our experience is that the processing at the CDC level takes more time and, sometimes, too much time.&nbsp; And some cases get rejected.&nbsp; Residents not helped by the CDC then return to us at the CCC or to my meet-the-people session to ask for help from the CCC ComCare Fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we need to manage expectations or else the CCC Fund will dry up in no time.&nbsp; May I suggest that the assessment form for the CCC ComCare Fund, which is now quite simple, be redesigned to allow a box for us to refer the case directly to CDC, so that there will be a seamless management of cases, rather than separate and disparate appeals made.&nbsp; It will also help in terms of job-matching.&nbsp; So it is clear in our ComCare and it is a clear message to residents that if&nbsp;they apply for financial help at the CCC level, yes, but, at the same time, straightaway,&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1420<p>they must go to the CDC for job-matching.&nbsp; And this is a clear&nbsp;signal that can be sent when they fill up the form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would urge the MCYS, like the hon. Member Sin Boon Ann, to have performance indicators, especially for CDCs, to monitor them closely on their performance and job placements and in attending to cases promptly.&nbsp; And perhaps to give them incentives or disincentives to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The help at the CDC level should, where possible, also shift away from unconditional cash assistance towards helping more in kind, in the form of food voucher, transport and utilities vouchers, and cash payment conditional on work, or attempts to find work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, at the CCC level, we do not have as many levers to work with to find jobs for residents or the wide array of schemes to refer them to.&nbsp; We do not have full-time staff as all on our CCC welfare committee are volunteers.&nbsp; On our own, we have tried to place some residents in jobs&nbsp; -&nbsp; the desperate ones&nbsp; -&nbsp; but they are difficult as they may also need long-term counselling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just give one recent example.&nbsp; A housewife came to see me in April this year at my MPS.&nbsp; Her story was that her husband had left her for a younger woman, but did not want to give her a divorce because it would mean that he has to pay for the household bills and has to pay for the maintenance of the family.&nbsp; So her husband left her with three teenage children and a pile of household bills.&nbsp; In the MPS, she threatened suicide.&nbsp; She said she was very depressed.&nbsp; Of course, I immediately helped her with $50 cash from the welfare fund.&nbsp; I then advised her on the need to get a job as a long-term solution, and to seek counselling on her marital situation.&nbsp; I referred her to the Syariah Court to advise her on her options for a divorce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1421<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the CCC welfare fund, she received $200 to pay for her son's examination fees; another $250 a month for the next&nbsp;three months, on top of the $50 one-time cash that I gave her at the MPS itself.&nbsp; So, in all, we gave her about $1,000 from our CCC welfare fund.&nbsp; We also gave her utilities vouchers ($60) for her Singapore Power&nbsp;arrears.&nbsp; And we also went the extra mile to help her find a job.&nbsp; I got my branch secretary to call one of our eldercare centres&nbsp; -&nbsp; Metta Day Rehabilitation Centre - to ask if they could kindly help her to find a job in the interim period while she works out her problems.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>So she did not enjoy the benefits of&nbsp;having her arrears reduced.&nbsp; I also referred her case to North East CDC, who also helped her financially, and to the various Government agencies, such as HDB, to defer payment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cases like hers are long-drawn and complex.&nbsp; They are beyond the capabilities of the CCC.&nbsp; We need to put in place a more robust system at the CDC level to help residents get back on their feet, including counselling, and we do need proactive case managers who will take cases seriously and help them to find jobs and give them the counselling necessary to stay in jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to also repeat the question that Mr Sin Boon Ann raised, because I think it is a worthy question.&nbsp; It is about the long-term cases.&nbsp; We see repeat cases coming back at MPS.&nbsp; Surely, we do not have to put them through the agony of coming <p align=left>Column: 1422<p>back and crying in our MPS and asking for more help for another three more months.&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister: what are the schemes available for longer term assistance and what are the criteria for ensuring that this help is given to residents who need it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I understand that there is a Ministerial Committee on Low Wage Workers, and I hope that the committee will look into strengthening the effectiveness of ComCare schemes as part of the overall framework and to take a more holistic approach to welfare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second point relates to another trend, which was also pointed out by Dr Khor.&nbsp; We see more single mothers seeking help, unable to take on full-time jobs as they need to take care of their young children at home.&nbsp; They also often complain of their ex-husbands not paying maintenance.&nbsp; This is a national phenomenon and it manifests itself when the single mothers come to us for help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was going through some recent cases, and I would like to highlight two quickly to show how difficult it is for the CCC to resolve this, using the ComCare Fund.&nbsp; The first case:&nbsp;one who applied for help was a babysitter earning about $500 a month.&nbsp; She is about 40, a divorcee with the custody of two children, aged 10 and 11.&nbsp; She lives in a 5-room flat. In the form there is a column which asked them to describe reasons for rendering assistance, and she wrote: \"Maintenance of children not paid.\"&nbsp; Then there was another applicant, this time a man.&nbsp; He is 42 and works as a part-time telemarketeer earning about $700 a month.&nbsp; He has divorced and remarried.&nbsp; In the same column asking reasons for rendering assistance, he wrote: \"Do not have a proper job even though have gone for a few interviews.&nbsp; To support household monthly expenses and maintenance of my two sons whose mother I have divorced.\"&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1423<p>So we have single mothers writing to us for help because their ex-husbands had not paid their maintenance, and we have ex-husbands writing to us for help because they want us to help them pay the maintenance for their former wives.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, this cannot be sustained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we need to address wider labour and social trends, such as contract work which pays low and the rising number of single mothers unable to take on full-time work.&nbsp; The wages earned, usually way below $800, are not enough for Singaporeans to raise a family on, given today's rising cost of living.&nbsp; We need to get at the root of the problem: low wages and increasingly unstable work which have driven the more lower-skilled Singaporeans from the labour market to our welfare system.&nbsp; At the same time, we must stress that, irrespective of its size, a pay cheque is better than a handout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as we can see, welfare dependency is partly also caused by fathers leaving, families falling apart - issues that should be boldly addressed by MCYS.&nbsp; If divorce or separation occurs, most mothers seek and accept primary responsibility for the care of their children even when they are not financially well-equipped to do so.&nbsp; Indeed, if women did not continue to shoulder these risks and burdens, it is hard to see how any social institution could make up for the services they now provide.&nbsp; I would urge the MCYS to work on ways to make absentee fathers or divorced fathers pay more for the support of their children and to stick to their maintenance payments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a final point.&nbsp; I think we should all stress the message that we need to beware of the welfare mentality settling in.&nbsp; Our ComCare programme is to help residents to be strong and not to weaken them.&nbsp; If I may take a lesson from the<p align=left>Column: 1424<p> hurricane Katrina.&nbsp; When it&nbsp;hit&nbsp;New Orleans, I followed the events on CNN.&nbsp; And the images that came through were jarring. Some of the victims - they looked very well-bodied, in fact, quite well fed -&nbsp;acted helpless, and they preyed on each other by looting shops; some of them raped the women among them, and&nbsp;they were shooting their rescuers.&nbsp; But there was one scene that particularly stuck in my mind.&nbsp; It was a group of men and women, able-bodied, and with their children, all chanting very loudly: \"We want aid!&nbsp; We want aid!\".&nbsp; And they were chanting it like it was a nursery rhyme, and I could see the look on the children's faces - they took it like it was a normal thing to say.&nbsp; And these are the messages that have been purveyed to the community&nbsp;and the children.&nbsp; It made me ask: where was the sense of community?&nbsp; The resilience and instinct to help one another?&nbsp; What kind of values are the children learning from their parents?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if I may quote a column by Robert Tracinski, which was published in the <I>Straits Times</I> on 12th September:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"What hurricane Katrina exposed was the psychological consequences of the welfare state.&nbsp; What we consider \"normal\" behaviour in an emergency is behaviour that is normal for people who have values and take the responsibility to pursue and protect them.&nbsp; People with values respond to a disaster by fighting against it and doing whatever it takes to overcome the difficulties.&nbsp; They do not sit around and complain that the government has not taken care of them.&nbsp;And they do not use the chaos of a disaster as an opportunity to prey on their fellow men.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we need to remind ourselves that we are a small vulnerable state with no resources, except our people, and we have to maintain a community that is ever ready to overcome difficulties on their own and be resilient and rugged.&nbsp; Studies from various countries have shown that children from homes which depend on <p align=left>Column: 1425<p>welfare will grow up to expect handouts as adults.&nbsp; We need children to grow up in homes where work and individual responsibility, rather than welfare and dependency, are valued as a way of life.&nbsp; And we need to build up people's resilience even as we offer a safety net for those who need it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I end, I just want to say that it is a good scheme, and I want to thank the Minister for the scheme which has allowed me to set up&nbsp;Silver Connect - a programme to help the elderly among us who are needy and lack a strong family support - which should, hopefully, make life better for many of the elderly in my ward.&nbsp; This scheme has great promise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that note, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</B> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to speak on this Bill.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wanted very much to support this Bill. It is very good of the Government to set up an endowment fund to help care for the weak and needy - the poor, the sickly and the unemployed - in our society.&nbsp; This is an important initiative of the Government, and another opportunity for the rich and successful people in our society to reach out and help the less well-off in our midst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we - as a society - do not stretch our hand to help the weak and the poor, who can they then rely on to help?&nbsp; If the Government does not make an effort to take care of the down and out in our society, then it speaks very badly of our Government and our society. But now that we are a developed first world society on our third stage of economic progress, it is high time we put in more resources to care and help the weak and the less fortunate in our midst, whether in the form of welfare, workfare or ComCare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1426<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, in this respect, I want to speak in support of this ComCare Fund.&nbsp; However, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have one question and another major concern that I hope the Minister will help address.&nbsp; Please reassure us so that we can give our hearts to fully support this caring initiative.&nbsp; First, the question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this ComCare Fund was set up for the purpose of providing assistance to citizens and the Permanent Residents of Singapore and their family members living in Singapore.&nbsp; I am surprised that this ComCare Fund is extended to Permanent Residents and their families too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have spoken out in previous parliamentary sittings that citizenship must have its privileges.&nbsp; There must be a distinction in terms of privilege and help to be given to our citizens and the Permanent Residents.&nbsp; This is important so that Singaporeans will feel more valued by the Government and cherish their citizenship even more.&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, citizen workers are already feeling that their wages have been squeezed out by the huge supply of foreigners - talented or not - working in Singapore.&nbsp; There is already this negative feeling that Singaporean workers are considered third class citizens. So, let us not make it worse by ranking Singaporeans with the same help and privilege as a Permanent Resident.&nbsp; There must be a distinction of help and privilege given between the two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I would like to ask the Minister if the level of financial help to be offered for PRs and their families will be at a markedly lower level than a true blue Singapore citizen.&nbsp; This distinction will also help encourage more PRs to give serious consideration to the Singapore citizenship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Sir, I want to talk about my major concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1427<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, who are the people who will&nbsp;be authorised to give out money to help the weak and the needy citizens from this Fund?&nbsp; Do all elected MPs qualify?&nbsp; Will all MPs be authorised to make use of this Fund for their residents?&nbsp; Or will this ComCare Fund be politicised by the PAP Government such that only PAP cadre members, who are the grassroots advisers, will&nbsp;be allowed to dip into this Fund?&nbsp; Apparently, PAP candidates in Opposition constituencies, acting as their grassroots advisers, are given unfair political mileage when they have access to this Fund that the elected MPs do not have access to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my serious complaint is that this great caring initiative will again be politicised such that the Opposition MPs (and their constituents) are excluded from participating.&nbsp; I really hope that the Government will clearly reassure all of us that all elected MPs will be authorised to issue out of this ComCare Fund.&nbsp; Otherwise, I find it difficult to fully give our hearts to support this Bill.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n<!--SECTION_NAME:MOTIONS-->\r\n\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:EXEMPTED BUSINESS--><p align=left>Column: 1427<p>\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>EXEMPTED BUSINESS<BR></B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Motion-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Motion)<BR></B></span><div><BR>\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.12 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolved,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the proceedings on the business set down on the Order Paper for today be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 2. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--SECTION_NAME:BILLS-->\r\n  \t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:COMMUNITY CARE ENDOWMENT FUND BILL--><p align=left>Column: 1427<p>\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>COMMUNITY CARE ENDOWMENT FUND BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debate resumed.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Members for <p align=left>Column: 1428<p>their comments and suggestions.&nbsp; Let me just deal with some of the specific questions raised by the Non-Constituency Member, since he said that is what is preventing him from giving unreserved support for this Bill.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First question: are we discriminating between citizens and PRs?&nbsp; If you look at the fine print of our assistance schemes, assistance will be provided to a PR only if there is one or more Singaporeans in his direct family.&nbsp; In other words, we are treating this as a Singaporean family or, in his words, a true blue Singaporean family. And the reason for that is quite simple.&nbsp; The unit of assistance is the family.&nbsp; If you were to give this PR member of a family less, you are just imposing extra hardship on the Singaporean family.&nbsp; So, let me reassure him on that, and can I then take it that he will give us his unreserved support for this Bill?&nbsp; [<I>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</I> <I>indicated in the affirmative.</I>]&nbsp; Thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; Now, let me now deal with the substantive points which have been raised by my colleagues.&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor talked about the impact of globalisation and income disparity.&nbsp; Let me state right at the onset, that ComCare, workfare and all our assistance schemes are not going to eliminate the income disparity.&nbsp; There are fundamental economic forces at work and these assistance schemes are not going to correct that.&nbsp; But what we are trying to do is to ensure that all Singaporeans, regardless of social/economic class, have a chance to live with dignity, have hope for the future and that their children can break out of the poverty trap.&nbsp; So, it is very important for us to state right at the onset what this is designed to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next point I want to explain is the complementary way in which ComCare will work with workfare.&nbsp; The workfare concept is something which is still being fleshed out and we are, in fact, now engaged in a public consultation exercise.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1429<p>This is being led by an Inter-Ministry Committee, led by my colleague Dr Ng Eng Hen.&nbsp; But, fundamentally, workfare is based on the belief that the best form of welfare is a job - any job - even if it is a low-paying job.&nbsp; But having said that, we believe that there are things which we can do to optimise the situation.&nbsp; For instance, upskilling and up training workers so that they can get better paying jobs which are more productive.&nbsp; Redesigning jobs so that the jobs can also give a person an honest day's wage,</p>\r\n</P></span></div>   \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>and an honest day's wage which will hopefully be more than what he would get otherwise.&nbsp; It is also possible to look at various ways to make work pay or to make it worthwhile.&nbsp; But the key point here in workfare is to tilt and adjust the playing field in such a way that it is clearly in your interest to get a job, rather than to stay at home or to go on a protest march, as Ms Irene Ng talked about,&nbsp;after a hurricane and&nbsp;chanting \"We want aid.&nbsp; We want aid.\"&nbsp; With workfare, it is to get a job.&nbsp; We will help you&nbsp;find a job.&nbsp; We will make it worth your while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, there will always be a small minority who cannot get a job. As some of you had said, if they are severely disabled, or they have major health problems, and if they are all alone and there is no family support, then these are people who truly need assistance, and it will be long-term assistance.&nbsp;That is what the public assistance scheme is for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also another group, and that is very eloquently described by Mdm Halimah Yacob, of&nbsp;mothers,&nbsp;especially single mothers, who have to look after their children.&nbsp; If we are serious about the concept of workfare for everyone, including mothers, then we need to look at optimising the social support so that these ladies can get back to work.&nbsp; And I will take all her points about the availability&nbsp;and affordability of childcare, and this is something which, over the next few months, we will have to consult <p align=left>Column: 1430<p>and we will have to try to see whether further refinements are necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, we have to think of workfare and ComCare as complementary.&nbsp; Workfare is to get everybody who can work into a job; ComCare is to help those who really cannot get a job or to optimise the social support so that those who&nbsp;previously would have said, \"I need to stay at home and look after my kids.\" can now go and get a job.&nbsp; If we can get this balance right, then we will be able to achieve&nbsp;a social safety system in which the work ethic is not eroded, in which a positive domestic environment will be created because we want children to see their parents working.&nbsp; We do not want children to see a dysfunctional family dependent on handouts.&nbsp; We also want children to receive the optimal educational experience possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this brings me to this point that Mr Sin Boon Ann brought up of defining \"eligibility\" and \"needs\".&nbsp; I accept the point that our criteria for eligibility for long-term assistance&nbsp;are strict. But I think you will all agree with me that if we are not strict, we will run&nbsp;the risk of tilting the balance into a welfare model where people will treat their assistance schemes as an entitlement.&nbsp; The psychology changes.&nbsp; Yes, it is now painful, awkward and tedious for someone to come to you every three months at your MPS.&nbsp; But there is a world of difference between that transaction and a transaction in the UK where someone comes to the dole office every month for a cheque.&nbsp; It is painful but it underlines the point that assistance is not necessarily an entitlement and you are going to do something about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also reminds everybody that, in Singapore, you are responsible first for providing for yourself and your family.&nbsp; The second line of support is your family.&nbsp; The third line of support is the community.&nbsp; And once you accept such a model, a \"many helping hands\" model, it <p align=left>Column: 1431<p>necessarily means a holistic, comprehensive package becomes that much more difficult to fashion, not impossible, but more difficult because it means this person now actually has to decide and take the trouble to look for the agencies, look for the people who will help, look for a job if he or she can, and come to you as a last resort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of you have asked why short term, when sometimes&nbsp;it should be long term, and why flexible as opposed to a standard obligatory package.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is precisely for this reason.&nbsp; We have a combination which hopefully has&nbsp;the right balance between flexibility on one hand and the standard public assistance package on the other hand, and between short term and long term.&nbsp; The examples, which Ms Irene Ng&nbsp;brought up, are&nbsp;really that if anyone needs long-term assistance, that person should not be just going to you every three months for assistance at your meet-the-people session.&nbsp; That person should be evaluated by the CDC, and if that person and&nbsp;family&nbsp;are eligible for public assistance, they will be put on that scheme.&nbsp; If they are not eligible for public assistance, there are other schemes, including KiFAS&nbsp;which will help subsidise the kindergarten education for their kids, childcare, food vouchers.&nbsp; There are a whole host of other schemes.&nbsp; But the point here is to ensure that it does not become an entitlement.&nbsp; So long as you want to keep that, then Members in this House have to live with the fact that there will be a little bit of messiness at the edges. But with the judicious application of flexibility, it is possible to ensure that nobody slips through the cracks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the examples which&nbsp;were cited about people either sleeping in car parks or parks in Singapore, let me tell you very categorically&nbsp;that, in Singapore, if you are poor, you will have a roof over your head, you will have food in your stomach, your <p align=left>Column: 1432<p>children will get an education and you will get healthcare.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know the specific details of the case&nbsp;she brought up, but, very often, the people who are hanging out in parks and car parks are doing so because they refuse or do not want our assistance and do not want to take advantage of the homes for the destitute which we have in Singapore.&nbsp; And in those specific cases, you have not even yet evaluated the family circumstances and whether or not there is a family or family members who should rightly be taking care of these people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to move on to the next point about the role of&nbsp;community organisations.&nbsp;Because we want a \"many helping hands\" model and because we want peer review, we have decided that we will not deliver public assistance through the Ministry of Community Development. Instead, we work through grassroots organisations, we work through voluntary welfare organisations, we work through organisations on the ground,&nbsp;in other words, peer review of your needs.&nbsp;So you do not come and convince a bureaucrat as to what you need in your home&nbsp;or flat.&nbsp; You persuade your neighbours and your neighbours who live with you are in the best position to decide whether or not you truly require or need that assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, again, it means that, as Mr Sin Boon Ann brought up,&nbsp;there is a requirement&nbsp;for proper governance because we do not want corruption, we do not want money to be misused and we do not want money even to be politicised, as Mr Steve Chia has spoken about.&nbsp; We have deliberately chosen non-political organisations to do so.&nbsp; The People's Association (and the associated grassroots organisations) is a statutory board of the Government.&nbsp; If we were to appoint you or any of the Opposition MPs, that would politicise the exercise.&nbsp; So long as this is money -&nbsp;this is assistance <p align=left>Column: 1433<p>provided by the Government -&nbsp;the Government then has a responsibility to channel those funds and operationalise it through the appropriate statutory board, in this case, it is the People's Association.&nbsp; So let us not rehash that old debate about whether the Opposition MP should be the Advisor.&nbsp; The point is that, if you are poor or needy in Singapore regardless of where you live, see your local grassroots organisations, explain to them your needs, let them evaluate it and let them help you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also cognisant of the fact that we need outcome measurements.&nbsp; I take the points that I think Dr Amy Khor brought up about&nbsp;whether we need performance measurement, how fast does the CDC take to evaluate the cases.&nbsp; Most of the time, I have been told, it is due to incomplete documentation, or&nbsp;when you call someone, he or she is not in, it is difficult to make sure that person keeps that appointment.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you can speak to our five Mayors, they are working as hard as they possibly can, we do keep track of their performance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as supervision and governance&nbsp;are concerned, there is a ComCare Supervisory Committee, chaired by my Minister of State, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon. All the five Mayors are on that Supervisory Committee and so are relevant people from the voluntary welfare sector.&nbsp; So we have a system in which there is supervision, a system of governance and outcome and process parameters being monitored.&nbsp;Whether I would need to expose that and have a certain amount of comparison between the CDCs is not something I am going to decide today.&nbsp; But I want to assure this House that we will make sure money is spent properly, money is not wasted and that there is no corruption or undue political influence in this process.&nbsp; This is a process for the Government to assist Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very glad that Dr Amy Khor supports this fund to the extent of asking, <p align=left>Column: 1434<p>if I got&nbsp;her right,&nbsp;even for&nbsp;an additional top-up to the ComCare Fund.&nbsp; I think that is something which we can discuss with the Prime Minister at some other date.&nbsp; Right now, we only have $500 million.&nbsp; We are trying to reach $1 billion.&nbsp; When we get there, we can talk about going beyond it.&nbsp; But the critical point here, and&nbsp;she understood it perfectly right, is that because this is an Endowment Fund, it is a sustainable source of income in good times and bad times.&nbsp; In bad times, when the Ministries' block budgets are cut, as it must be as part of fiscal discipline,&nbsp;the social assistance schemes will still be able to draw on the interest income from this Endowment Fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, in conclusion, let me say that this is work which will never be finished.&nbsp; But if you are a poor person, of all the places in the world to be poor or needy, I would put to you that Singapore is probably one of the best places to be in, in terms of being able to live a life with dignity, to look for a job, to bring up&nbsp;the family securely, to educate your children, to receive healthcare and to have a community that cares, not just the Government, but the community in the fuller sense of the word.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I thank you all again for your support and&nbsp;suggestions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Prof. Ong Soh Khim (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to declare that I am an academic and a researcher at the National University of Singapore.&nbsp; I would also like to declare that the points to be brought up next are solely my views and do not represent that of NUS.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support and welcome the five strategic thrusts that were set out by the Ministerial Committee on Research and <p align=left>Column: 1436<p>Development that would serve as broad guidelines to implement a comprehensive R&amp;D strategy for Singapore.&nbsp; I would, however, like this House to consider certain points in transforming these thrusts from concept to reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Thrust 1: Provide more resources for R&amp;D in Singapore</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministerial Committee has recommended a target that Singapore should achieve a national R&amp;D spending of at least 3% of GDP within the next five years.&nbsp; I cannot agree more with this recommendation.&nbsp; It is certainly most exciting that the R&amp;D budget will be increased for the next five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is necessary to look into how these research resources will be used to transform Singapore into an R&amp;D-driven economy.&nbsp; The question is: hopefully it is not a topping up of the existing agencies, but some new schemes should be in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some possible new schemes are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; New research scholarship schemes and more research scholarships in our universities to encourage more Singaporeans to pursue higher degrees;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; New incentive schemes to promote a higher level of private-sector R&amp;D spending; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; New mechanisms to enhance technology transfer from research institutes (RIs) and educational institutes to the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, what would be our key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the achievements of this comprehensive R&amp;D strategy?&nbsp; We should not be relying on winning awards and competitions alone.&nbsp; Neither should we be relying on the total number of research publications and their citation counts.&nbsp; A country's <p align=left>Column: 1437<p>performance in the knowledge-based economy is not measured simply by outputs of science and technology, but must also be judged in relation to the important goal of increasing competitiveness.&nbsp; Thus, we need to formulate a set of KPIs that is based on our unique characteristics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this increase in research budget, more centres of excellence and RIs might be set up in our educational and knowledge institutes.&nbsp; There are two points to consider.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, is there a need for so many RIs and centres of excellence in our educational and knowledge institutes, thus incurring unnecessary overheads?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, would the setting up of more RIs and centres of excellence duplicate each other's research activities and equipment, thus diluting the limited research resources available?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there has to be a synergy between the research in the universities, educational institutes and the RIs.&nbsp; I would like to propose a closer coordination of the research activities in the RIs, universities and the educational institutes to minimise duplication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, we need to view this R&amp;D spending from a macro perspective.&nbsp; China has experienced a very strong growth in its R&amp;D intensity recently.&nbsp; In the July 2005 EU report on Key Figures 2005 for Science, Technology and Innovation, it was reported that China experienced a very strong growth in its R&amp;D intensity over the recent years, with an annual growth of 10% since 1997, and that China will catch up with the EU by 2010 in terms of the share of GDP allocated to R&amp;D.&nbsp; Sir, how will this strong growth in the R&amp;D intensity of China affect the implementation of Singapore's R&amp;D plan?&nbsp; Is our target of <p align=left>Column: 1438<p>3% GDP within the next five years competitive?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Thrust 2: Focus on selected areas of economic importance where Singapore can be internationally competitive</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent years, there appears to have been a shifting away of focus from engineering and physical sciences to life-science.&nbsp; Life-science appears to be the chosen discipline.&nbsp; Hence, the second thrust that we should deepen our capabilities in key clusters, such as electronics, chemical and marine engineering, look for new growth areas and two potentially interesting areas, namely environmental and water technologies, and interactive and digital media, is indeed very much welcomed by the research community in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In focusing on selected areas of economic importance, it is essential to look at the research funds that have been set aside for life-science research in the last three years in relation to the research grants that have been set aside for engineering and physical sciences.&nbsp; We need to look at these statistics so that we can tilt the scale towards a more balanced distribution of research resources to other selected areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, our current education emphasis seems to be very much focused on life-science.&nbsp; It appears that there has been too much emphasis on life-science education, as our primary and secondary schools, funding agencies, Institutes of Technical Education, polytechnics and universities are all investing in life-science research and study.&nbsp; Why is there a need for the ITEs and polytechnics to invest in life-science?&nbsp; Sir, someone once mentioned that even first-degree holders in life-science are only fit to wash test tubes.&nbsp; So, what do these ITE and polytechnic students wash?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1439<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have students been influenced into thinking that life-science holds the key to the future and taking up life-science as their future choice of study?&nbsp; A more important concern is whether this has reduced the crop, in particular good students, in taking up studies in engineering and physical sciences.&nbsp; To pursue research in environmental and water technologies and interactive and digital media, a good spread of students in the physical sciences and engineering, rather than just the life-science, is needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Economically relevant is usually&nbsp;at the end of exploratory&nbsp;or blue-sky research.&nbsp; A good balance is needed.&nbsp; Looking for new growth areas is a must.&nbsp; However, if the technology and basic sciences are available from elsewhere, there is no need for us to start from the ground as we can leapfrog such technologies and hire the best people in those areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will probably need to start basic research of a slightly different nature, something unique to Singapore, for example, diseases affecting this region and not elsewhere, and sciences and technologies that will strengthen the ties with ASEAN member countries.&nbsp; Environmental and water research are good topics that have&nbsp;great impacts on ASEAN countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From an economic relevance viewpoint, scientific and technological innovations would appear to have more tangible outcomes.&nbsp; However, the humanities and social sciences should not be neglected.&nbsp; For example, demographic developments and their effects on medical insurance systems, public spending and the labour market, the analysis of family and its sensitivity to the economic and social contexts, and unique social and ageing issues in Singapore should be studied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1440<p>\r\n<p><I>Thrust 3:&nbsp; Provide a balance of investigator-led and mission-oriented research in strategic areas</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fully agree that there should be a good balance between basic investigator-led and applied and mission-oriented type of research.&nbsp; However, it should not be a \"one-size-fits-all\" ratio.&nbsp; It may not be so easy to decide on the ratio, as the ratio will vary from discipline to discipline.&nbsp; At the moment, the investigator-led type&nbsp;of research funding is very lean.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the figures given in a speech by Dr Tony Tan on 11th August 2005, the FY2006-2010 R&amp;D funding will be $5.4 billion for A*Star and $1.05 billion for the Academic Research Fund.&nbsp; It can be observed that the funds allocated to A*Star to carry out mission-oriented type of research is almost five times that of the funds allocated to the&nbsp;Academic Research Fund to carry out basic investigator-led research.&nbsp; Sir, with this big difference in research funding, how does the Government hope to provide a balance of investigator-led and mission-oriented research?&nbsp; It is essential to provide a very strong support to basic investigator-led research that is broadly aligned with the long-term strategic interests of Singapore so that we can build a solid foundation for scientific excellence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the Academic Research Fund is administered by MOE.&nbsp; I am not sure if MOE should continue to manage the Academic Research Fund, as MOE is only an administrative body.&nbsp; To MOE, this is only one duty among hundreds of other functions that it has to cope with, and there is relatively little time and effort which it could afford on this.&nbsp; Thus, this duty should be delegated to an organisation that is managed by scientists and technologists, and serves nothing but one purpose, ie, best management of research funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1441<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we need to develop our own talents in addition to bringing in foreign talents to supplement our R&amp;D manpower.&nbsp; In Singapore, R&amp;D careers lack attractiveness.&nbsp; The current low R&amp;D intensity in Singapore results in few R&amp;D positions, out-of-field employment, and possible emigration resulting in a brain drain.&nbsp; Making research careers more attractive is necessary to increase the inflow of science and engineering educated people into research positions to provide the R&amp;D manpower that we need to move towards an R&amp;D-driven economy.&nbsp; Increasing R&amp;D positions in Singapore and providing a job-matching service for the PhD holders are two other methods to solve this problem.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the local universities, there is always this stigma that students with weaker academic results are barred from doing research.&nbsp; Sometimes, research and academic capabilities may not go hand-in-hand.&nbsp; To increase our local talent pool, we should selectively pick and interview students who may be weaker academically but with&nbsp;strong research inclination and potential.&nbsp; I have personally come across such a student, and it took me great effort to convince the authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, our universities rely heavily on foreign research students, and many of the researchers in the RIs are foreigners and/or naturalised Singaporeans.&nbsp; A very high percentage of the research students under the university research scholarship schemes are from China and India, with Singaporeans forming a very small percentage.&nbsp; Granting of US visas to foreign students has since been relaxed a few years after the 9/11 incident, and many foreign students are heading for&nbsp;US universities again.&nbsp; Hence, we need to encourage more local students to pursue research, otherwise we would not have the manpower for R&amp;D.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some observations on why few local students pursue higher degrees are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1442<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; The university research scholarship monthly allowance of $1,500 is not attractive to local students.&nbsp; This monthly allowance, however, is attractive to foreign students from the lower-income countries.&nbsp; To these foreign students, pursuing a higher degree in Singapore is almost like a paid \"job\", with the reward of a degree after the completion of the job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Singapore is often taken as a stepping stone by some of these foreign students who will either immediately or eventually move on to other countries after completing their higher degrees in Singapore.&nbsp; Hence, it does not really matter to them whether there is a job avenue in Singapore for them.&nbsp; However, the issue of job avenue in Singapore is important to local students pursuing higher degrees, as they would not want to be \"forced\" to go overseas for a job after getting their PhD degrees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enhancing the attractiveness of an R&amp;D career, increasing R&amp;D positions in Singapore, and&nbsp;more attractive scholarship allowance are some of the methods to solve this problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some personal reasons why local students are not pursuing higher degrees are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; The need to repay their education loans resulting from their basic degrees.&nbsp; In an MOE report, in AY2002, 77% of the intake cohort took up some form of study loans and, in 2003, 33% of the graduates are debt-ridden from these education loans;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; The need to work so as to contribute to the family income and finance the studies of&nbsp;their younger siblings;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; The need to work so as to accumulate CPF savings for the purchase <p align=left>Column: 1443<p>of a flat to start a family after marriage; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Male Singaporean students typically view the two years of National Service as&nbsp;having \"fallen behind\" their peers from junior colleges, and hence the need to quickly start working to catch up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To encourage more local students to pursue higher degrees, the research scholarships can be redesigned to address the concerns of these students.&nbsp; The universities and RIs can provide simultaneous on-the-job opportunities that could lead to CPF contributions for local research students.&nbsp; For example, these local students can be employed as research engineers in the RIs or as teaching assistants in the local universities while pursuing their PhDs.&nbsp; The university fees should also be made affordable to local students so that they are not debt-ridden upon graduation with basic degrees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another factor is the perception of local PhDs.&nbsp; A local PhD graduate is often viewed as \"second-rate\" among those who have obtained their PhDs from overseas universities, regardless of whether these universities are first-tier or otherwise.&nbsp; Local universities tend not to regard their own PhD graduates highly when recruiting staff for academic positions.&nbsp; A PhD graduate from&nbsp;the&nbsp;local universities has very slim chances of securing an academic position in the universities.&nbsp; The arguments given are usually that \"the universities do not wish to promote in-breeding\" and \"many universities in the US do not employ their own PhD graduates either\".&nbsp; The issue of in-breeding is a non-issue if this PhD graduate is able to work on different research topics from his PhD work in his subsequent academic career.&nbsp; Unfortunately, very few PhD graduates have been given a chance to prove themselves.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1444<p> In addition, Singapore has only three universities while the US has hundreds.&nbsp; Hence, it is not difficult for a PhD graduate from one US university to find an academic position in another US university.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this perception of local PhDs needs to be changed.&nbsp; It is ironical that local universities, having hired many overseas renowned research professors to supervise these research students, do not regard these PhD graduates highly.&nbsp; Why do we train PhDs if we do not even value our PhD graduates as potential academics?&nbsp; We can increase this recognition of local PhD graduates by way of offering some of the best to take up academic appointments.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Economically relevant, no doubt, but they are not addressing technologies of the far future.&nbsp; If they are, such activities will be mostly conducted in their home bases and in the most confidential manner that will not benefit others.&nbsp; These are their \"secret weapons\".&nbsp; A good balance is again needed here:&nbsp; basic research to fuel the private sector, or a private-sector led applied research which is of immediate relevance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the July 2005 EU&nbsp;report, it was reported that 22.4% of the business R&amp;D is performed by SMEs in the EU, 14.1% in US and 7% in Japan.&nbsp; To increase the percentage of business R&amp;D by SMEs in Singapore, we would need to study and analyse the profile of these SMEs, such as their primary business activity and employees' qualifications so that new&nbsp;incentive schemes can be proposed&nbsp;to encourage these SMEs to engage in R&amp;D activities and help them to align their R&amp;D investments with commercial opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1445<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To&nbsp;encourage more private sector R&amp;D investments, we need to increase the efficiency with which new ideas are turned into new products, processes, services and solutions and improve the protection for intellectual property, so&nbsp;as to create a conducive&nbsp;environment for firms to increase R&amp;D investment in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Thrust 5:&nbsp; Strengthening the nexus between R&amp;D and business</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In strengthening the nexus between R&amp;D and business, we need to bridge the gaps between the research in the universities and RIs and private sector research in MNCs and SMEs.&nbsp; There is a R&amp;D value chain that can be considered here.&nbsp; Firstly, the universities can be responsible for most of the basic and fundamental research.&nbsp; This is followed by the RIs, which act as halfway houses and the next stage where discoveries and inventions from the universities can be transferred for further development into prototype systems and products.&nbsp; The last stage is the polytechnics, which can take the prototypes further and develop them into commercial products together with the companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, most local research laboratories of MNCs and local large companies are application-oriented.&nbsp; Local SMEs are mostly only keen on short-term downstream application-oriented research that can provide solution for an immediate problem that they have experienced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traditionally, researches from the universities are often viewed to be too theoretical by the SMEs, local large companies and MNCs to be immediately useful to their needs.&nbsp; The IPs and technologies created by the universities and the RIs are rather basic and often too upstream for use by the SMEs. MNCs are less interested in these IPs and technologies created by the universities <p align=left>Column: 1446<p>and RIs as they already have them from their headquarters and research laboratories.&nbsp; Thus, there is a need to ensure that the IPs, technologies and research developed by the universities and the RIs are relevant to these MNCs, local large companies and SMEs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there are a few challenges:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; A university has to perform a certain amount of upstream cutting edge research to be on par with universities world-wide and to be ranked&nbsp;high&nbsp;internationally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; SMEs, being small, have limited funding to channel into&nbsp;research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; MNCs may not be&nbsp;keen to provide research funding&nbsp;to the RIs and the universities since they usually have their own research laboratories in Singapore and&nbsp;in their headquarters.&nbsp;&nbsp;And, by&nbsp;conducting research in their own research laboratories&nbsp;and headquarters, these MNCs own 100% of the IPs that will result from the research.&nbsp; Hence, it is not likely that local universities are able to secure large funding from these MNCs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two possible solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, a new industry-oriented Engineering Doctorate degree, which has been proven great success in UK and Europe, can be introduced in the local universities.&nbsp; These doctorate students can be existing employees in a company wishing to upgrade themselves through pursuing research in an area that is of relevance to the company, while continuing to work in the same company, or students from the universities being parked in companies to work on projects that have been proposed by these companies while, at the same time, participating in the activities of these companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1447<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their employers will co-fund the research that the students are working on, and provide a supplementary salary to these students.&nbsp; In return for the co-funding, the employers will have a first right to be the beta test site of the technologies developed and co-share the IPs. This will ensure that the research performed is of greater practical use and can be transferred to the industry.&nbsp; This will also make it attractive for Singaporeans to pursue higher degrees as they will receive a salary in addition to a scholarship allowance. The salaries paid to these students by the companies are a form of private R&amp;D funding.&nbsp; Hence, companies will be more willing to participate and provide such R&amp;D funding.&nbsp; This will encourage private sector participation, bridge the universities' research efforts with the industries and enhance the link between them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the polytechnics, which have industry networks, can be roped in to perform downstream application-oriented research.&nbsp; In the R&amp;D value chain that I mentioned earlier, these polytechnics can partner the RIs on one hand and the SMEs on the other to perform application-oriented research that can&nbsp;provide immediate solutions to the technical needs of these SMEs.&nbsp; A research funding scheme can be set up for the polytechnics and the SMEs to jointly apply for grants to perform such research.&nbsp; The participating SMEs will be required to provide cash funding for a certain percentage of the total research project value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, I am glad that the Government has decided to put more emphasis on R&amp;D, with the setting of the five strategic thrusts and providing the necessary structures and resources to support Singapore's R&amp;D drive.&nbsp; I support them and hope to see many positive changes going forward.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1448<p><B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> First, let me&nbsp;thank Prof. Ong Soh Khim for her support of the five strategic thrusts and, particularly, also for her several very innovative and interesting suggestions.&nbsp; I am sure we will take up all these suggestions in greater detail as we operationalise the five strategic thrusts.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just respond quickly to some of the points she raised. First of all, I agree with her that what was set out in then DPM Tony Tan's speech of the five strategic thrusts sets out the&nbsp;broad strategic directions. We are now in the process of operationalising these programmes.&nbsp; And in doing so, of course, it will not just be more of the same.&nbsp; When&nbsp;the Government invests more funds and more resources, we will obviously look at new schemes,&nbsp;new opportunities and new programmes.&nbsp; So I would like to assure her that&nbsp;the money will not just go to existing schemes or just more of the same approaches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of the key performance indicators, I agree&nbsp;that&nbsp;the whole idea of the funds is to increase competitiveness and to create jobs for Singaporeans. We do need some performance indicators of inputs as well as outputs, but the final objective must be increased competitiveness of the Singapore economy and jobs for Singaporeans.&nbsp; Whether or not we need more centres of excellence and more RIs is something that we have to evaluate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically, our approach would be to build upon our existing capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to emphasise that the perception that she may have formed that life sciences is over-emphasised compared to other science and technology is&nbsp;a wrong perception.&nbsp; Our intention is to build upon our key clusters.&nbsp; If you look at the&nbsp;manufacturing sector in our economy, our key clusters are in the electronics and precision engineering, petrochemicals, transport engineering, particularly in <p align=left>Column: 1449<p>marine engineering.&nbsp; We are strong in life sciences, but it contributes only 5% of our GDP.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clusters contribute 22-23% of our GDP.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we go forward, we cannot just depend on life sciences alone.&nbsp; We have to build up several clusters of excellence and&nbsp;competencies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think her misperception&nbsp;has&nbsp;been answered somewhat by Mr Tharman just now in a response to her Question about the emphasis on life sciences education in our schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our parents can be trusted to know what is best for their children and they will be able to see, looking forward, where are the job opportunities in Singapore.&nbsp; That is where they will guide their children to excel in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the third thrust on having a balance between mission-oriented and investigator-led research, let me assure her that the primary priority would still be on mission-oriented research.&nbsp; We do need a balance with investigator-led research because we do need some basic research to complement our mission-oriented research.&nbsp; And when we bring in talent and&nbsp;develop our local talent, I do not think&nbsp;such talent will just be satisfied in doing mission-oriented research. So we need this balance.&nbsp; But overall, the priority must be on&nbsp;mission-oriented research that leads to competitiveness and&nbsp;jobs, rather than basic research for its own sake.&nbsp; If you look at the way the funding has been allocated in the past few years, this reflects our priority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Ong also gave several suggestions about how we can develop our local talent.&nbsp; I agree entirely with her sentiments that we must develop our local talent.&nbsp; But, at the same time, I think she will agree with me that depending entirely on local talent alone will not be sufficient.&nbsp; We do need a complement of foreign talent.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be shortchanging ourselves if we do not tap into the foreign talent from China, India and the surrounding countries.&nbsp; How do we attract <p align=left>Column: 1450<p>these people here and encourage them to sink roots in Singapore?&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a tremendous challenge.&nbsp; With her inside knowledge about how local students respond to the research scholarships, and how foreign students respond to the research scholarships, these are useful feedback.&nbsp; We will look at how we can adjust the research scholarships to be able to attract more Singaporeans to take up&nbsp;a research career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, we do aim for between 100-150 Singaporean students taking up a PhD scholarship and this&nbsp;target is within reach.&nbsp; We are very careful as&nbsp;we have a limited local talent and we do not want to encourage or direct the bulk of our local talent into a research career because the local talents have to be deployed in so many other critical areas.&nbsp; But I agree with her and I think all of us in the Ministerial Committee in R&amp;D agree with her that research is not just a matter of academic excellence.&nbsp; It also requires a passion for research.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to identify people who are not only academically talented, but also have the passion to do research.&nbsp; Only then, they will do well as researchers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth strategic thrust is to leverage the private sector R&amp;D.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very important because if the money is directed primarily at public sector R&amp;D,&nbsp;I do not think we will have a proper check-and-balance on whether the money&nbsp;is directed at the right areas.&nbsp; With the private sector as a partner in directing the research, we can be more confident that the research will be directed at commercially-viable projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An important thrust of involving the private sector is also to involve our local SMEs.&nbsp; If&nbsp;you have read then DPM Tony Tan's speech, our intention is to build up the polytechnics and also our RIs to link up with our local companies, including the SMEs.&nbsp; So this sector will not be neglected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1451<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the final thrust of reinforcing the nexus of R&amp;D and businesses, the various points that she has raised are worthy of note.&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially&nbsp;her suggestion about PhD&nbsp;students being co-funded by companies, that is&nbsp;worthy of&nbsp;study and we will definitely look at this.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to say that we do have successful collaboration between the companies and our research institutes.&nbsp; I can&nbsp;give two quick examples.&nbsp; Mitsui Chemicals,&nbsp;for example, has a very successful collaboration with our Institute of Chemical Engineering and Sciences (ICES).&nbsp; Another company, Degussa, for example, also has a similar arrangement with ICES to develop new lubricants.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe some of these new products will find commercial applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the&nbsp;types of collaborations that we are <p align=left>Column: 1452<p>looking for to reinforce the nexus between our RIs and the companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in the end, the intellectual property that we develop in our RIs must be put to commercial applications and to reinforce our competitive position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to thank Prof. Ong for the several good points that she has raised.&nbsp; I am sure we will follow this up as we operationalise the R&amp;D strategy for Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolved,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That Parliament do now adjourn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"right\">Seven o'clock pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"right\">to a date to be fixed.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

It is now well recognised all over the world that advances in the life sciences are opening up large economic opportunities and will have a major impact on human society in the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But while there has been increasing interest in the life sciences, the number of students pursuing engineering-related disciplines or the physical sciences remains substantial. Candidature for 'O' Level Biology and Chemistry has increased in recent years, to 30% and 43% respectively in 2004. However, the 'O' Level Physics candidature has also increased, to 42% of all candidates*. Likewise, while 'A' Level Biology and Chemistry candidature has grown to 26% and 65%, 'A' Level Physics candidature remains a significant 60% of all candidates.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The picture is similar at the tertiary level. ITE's Biochemical Technology course, its only life sciences course, had an intake of 160 in 2005, which is 1.3% of ITE's annual planned intake of 12,000. But more than 50% of ITE students take engineering-related courses. At the polytechnics, about 2,200 students signed up for chemical and life sciences courses in 2005, compared with 4,800 polytechnic students taking up engineering courses in 2005. For NUS and NTU, about 850 students entered life sciences**&nbsp;courses in 2005, compared with about 4,400 students in engineering and nearly 600 students in the physical sciences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column: 1455<p>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans have been and remain pragmatic. Ultimately, it is the availability of jobs and perceptions of career prospects that determine the popularity of different courses.&nbsp; But no one can know, with any certainty, exactly what types of skills and knowledge will be demanded in future. Our educational institutions therefore avoid making large bets on the future, or moving well ahead of the job market. Their pattern of intake of students into different disciplines reflects current economic opportunities and the demands that our industries are already able to anticipate. They also seek to ensure a good spread of talent across key disciplines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the school level, we provide a strong foundation of education across a broad base of subjects, to give our students greater flexibility to further their studies. At the post-secondary educational institutions, some specialisation and professional training is necessary. But the institutions are encouraging students to take options outside of their core disciplines, so as to broaden their intellectual horizons and prepare them for any eventuality in the job market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that more students are opting for the life sciences is entirely expected, and will support the continued growth of the biomedical industries.&nbsp; But these are not the only growth opportunities for Singapore, or the only rewarding careers for young Singaporeans.&nbsp; We will promote awareness amongst our students of all the opportunities available, and seek to retain interest in engineering and the physical sciences as we go forward. We will seek to ensure that adequate talent is available to support a broad and flexible strategy of industrial growth - including our key industrial clusters, namely, Electronics, Chemicals and the Biomedical Sciences, and new growth industries such as Environmental and Water Technologies, and Interactive and Digital Media.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The polytechnics, for example, are actively engaged in promoting interest in engineering amongst secondary school students, through a joint Task Force in partnership with the Singapore Science Centre, EDB and other organisations. IDA and the Singapore Computer Society organise seminars and exhibitions to promote the IT industry to secondary and JC students. NUS and NTU also conduct outreach activities, including promotional talks at schools and JCs, to interest students in taking up engineering and the physical sciences. A*STAR is also focused on developing a pipeline of research talent in both the biomedical sciences as well as the engineering and physical sciences. Last year, 50% of A*STAR scholarships were awarded to students in the engineering and physical sciences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>___________________</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">*Besides the pure sciences, there is also a substantial group of students offering the combined sciences: 46% of candidates in 2004 offered Physics/Chemistry, 4% offered Physics/Biology and 6% offered Chemistry/Biology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">**Excludes Medicine and Dentistry.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lee Boon Yang-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1457<p><B>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof Png asked about protecting Singapore consumer from unsolicited telemarketing calls.&nbsp; In a free market economy, we must expect businesses to become more creative in their efforts to win customers.&nbsp; MICA recognises that telemarketing is a common and bona fide marketing tool used by companies in many countries, but also acknowledges that irresponsible telemarketers are a nuisance to consumers.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Telemarketing involves one-to-one voice communication, which falls in the realm of private communication.&nbsp; As such, it is difficult to regulate this form of communication.&nbsp; Indeed, it may cause alarm among the public, if the Government were to monitor such private communication.&nbsp; For this reason, MDA and IDA do not regulate the content and mode of personal communications over the telephone.&nbsp; A balance must therefore be sought between curbing irresponsible telemarketing and the Government's intrusion into the area of free communication and privacy.&nbsp; Instead of direct intervention, there are a number of other safeguards to protect the consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Telecom Competition Code, IDA prohibits telecom licensees from providing their subscribers' information to any third party for marketing any goods and services.&nbsp; However, telemarketers may not be telecom licensees, and may have solicited, through legal channels, the users' telephone numbers, which means they may not be covered by the Telecom Competition Code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, industry-led initiatives are important means to address consumers' concerns.&nbsp; For example, the Mobile Marketing Council of Singapore (MMCS) was founded in January 2003, under the auspices of the Direct Marketing Association of Singapore (DMAS).&nbsp; It includes representatives from various segments of the mobile marketing industry, such as advertisers, mobile operators, mobile services providers, and mobile technologies providers.&nbsp; Its goals include sharing best practices and advising on legal compliance.&nbsp; In 2004, in response to growing concerns by mobile subscribers, it set out to draw up a position paper on mobile subscribers' privacy.&nbsp; MMCS is currently working with DMAS on a set of guidelines for responsible mobile and e-mail marketing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just last month on 25th August 2005, the Contact Centre Association of Singapore (CCAS) partnered with the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) and the Insurance and Financial Practitioners Association of Singapore (IFPAS) to release a set of telemarketing guidelines for the finance industry.&nbsp; These guidelines establish a common understanding of acceptable conduct when telemarketing financial products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MICA welcomes further initiatives by industry associations to promote best practices in telemarketing and other forms of direct marketing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, there are simple measures that each one of us can adopt to prevent or reduce unsolicited calls to the mobile numbers.&nbsp; For example, consumers can use the caller-ID function to screen local calls.&nbsp; Consumers can also buy mobile phones with a built-in function to reject or alert any calls from unknown numbers.&nbsp; These mobile phones are commonly available from several manufacturers.&nbsp; However this may not work when a subscriber is roaming overseas, as the call is re-routed and the availability of caller-ID is dependent on the commercially negotiated terms between the operators in the two countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1459<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

To address this problem, HDB and Town Councils have stepped up their public education efforts and enforcement actions.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the area of public education, HDB and Town Councils will redouble their efforts to highlight to residents the dangers of potential killer litter and the penalties that could be imposed for such offences.&nbsp; HDB and Town Councils will also encourage residents to proactively play their part in keeping HDB estates safe from killer litter.&nbsp; Over the next few months, they will continue to systematically comb through all HDB estates to identify flats with potential killer litter objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1465<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If they spot potential killer litter, they can also help by informing the households concerned to take them down or by notifying the Town Council or HDB Branch Office.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1465<p>\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This is to enable them to properly supervise their children who are studying in a new environment. Thereafter, they can apply for a Work Permit to work.

ICA requires a student studying in our Government schools, private education organisations and ITEs to have a local sponsor, who will be responsible for the student. ICA may also require the student to furnish a security deposit.

Singapore banned live pigs from Malaysia in 1999, following an outbreak of the Nipah virus there.&nbsp; In that outbreak, 11 abattoir workers in Singapore were infected and one died.&nbsp; Although Malaysia has declared that its pig population is now free of Nipah virus, the virus is still present in its wild bat population and may re-infect pigs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for FMD, even though it does not affect humans, Singapore could still lose its FMD-free status if it imports meat from non FMD-free areas such as Peninsular Malaysia.&nbsp; This would impact our export trade in meat valued at $30 million per year, and milk and dairy products valued at $226 million per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AVA therefore has to ensure that stringent quarantine conditions, regular audits and other controls are in place in pig farms before imports from Malaysia can be allowed.&nbsp; AVA is now working with Malaysia's Department of Veterinary Services (DVS) on a zonal approach to establish Johore as a disease-free zone.&nbsp; To minimise the risk of Nipah disease entering Singapore, we will consider only the import of pork, and not live pigs, at this stage. Only the frozen type is considered, as it is of lower risk because consignments have much longer shelf life and can be held back for tests on food-borne pathogens and chemical contaminants, allowing only safe meat to enter our food supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DVS is now carrying out FMD surveillance in Johore.&nbsp; Once Johore is confirmed FMD-free, AVA will work on the accreditation of bio-secured pig farms and an export abattoir.&nbsp; Import of frozen pork from Johore could be allowed once these steps have been carried out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, AVA has also diversified the sources of pork supply.&nbsp; Currently, 19 countries can export frozen pork to Singapore, of which&nbsp;six can export chilled pork to us.&nbsp; Live pigs are also imported from a farm on Pulau Bulan in Indonesia for slaughter here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1473<p>\r\n<p><I>Pork Prices</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The retail price of chilled or fresh lean pork has risen steadily over the last 10 years by about 55%, from $6.70 per kg in 1996 to $10.50 per kg in July 2005.&nbsp; Increase in pork prices in recent years is due to factors such as rising feed prices, increases in fuel and transportation costs, and increased world demand for pork.&nbsp; Consumers have switched to pork due to diseases such as the Mad Cow Disease and Bird Flu affecting cattle and poultry respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, many of our food industry and food service providers are already using frozen pork. Consumers can also consider buying frozen or frozen-thawed pork at some of our local meat retail outlets as an alternative.&nbsp; Retail prices of frozen pork are generally cheaper than that of chilled pork, and the difference could be as much as up to 50% for lean meat cuts, or 30% for loin cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>____________</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">*This is meat from either live pigs imported for slaughter in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, or imported chilled pork.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--SECTION_NAME:WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS--><p align=left>Column: 1475<p>\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B><P>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</P></span></B></div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:VOLUNTARY WELFARE ORGANISATIONS-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>VOLUNTARY WELFARE ORGANISATIONS</P></span>\r\n\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Charity shows over television and radio-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Charity shows over television and radio)</B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presidency is a post of the highest honour and responsibility.&nbsp; The President is a symbol of the nation.&nbsp; However, the President's role is more than ceremonial as he is constitutionally vested with custodial powers to protect the country's financial reserves and has veto powers over key appointments.&nbsp; Hence presidential candidates must possess high integrity and character, and meet exacting standards of competence and experience.&nbsp; The President is elected in a direct nationwide election, without going through the leadership selection processes of a political party.&nbsp; Stringent qualifying criteria are therefore spelt out in the Constitution, to ensure that voters are presented with a choice of well qualified and suitable candidates.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the qualifying criteria relate to the necessary experience and competencies to be a President.&nbsp; It would be reckless to lower the criteria to allow more candidates to contest, who would be unfit to be President if they were elected.&nbsp; This demeans the dignity of the high office, trivialises the election process itself, and detracts from the serious matter which Singaporeans should be focused upon.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

If fittings provided are not to their customers' taste, sales of the property would be affected.&nbsp; Similarly, potential purchasers also choose property units based on the total product offered, including finishes and fittings.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1481<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, there may be very few purchasers who would actually choose not to take delivery of fittings provided for in private residential developments.&nbsp; This is especially so if there are no cost savings or refund of payment to be derived from such an arrangement for the purchaser.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Controller of Housing has informed me that he has not received any request from purchasers or developers to dispense with the specified fittings in residential projects, and there are very few requests by developers or purchasers to provide options for fittings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to assure Prof Ivan Png that, for those few purchasers like himself who want some flexibility in the standard fittings provided, there are no rules to prohibit such variations. The Controller of Housing, who regulates housing developers, will allow the standard Sales and Purchase Agreement to be amended to cater for such variations in building finishes and fittings agreed to between the developer and purchaser.&nbsp; The developer and the purchaser would however have to come to a mutual agreement on this matter, the same way as they come to an agreement on other terms of the transaction such as price.&nbsp; The extent to which flexibility can be provided is best decided by developers, in negotiation with purchasers, and taking into account marketing, cost and other considerations.&nbsp; Some developers may be prepared to offer some flexibility as a marketing strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is thus no need for Government to get involved in a matter that can be decided through mutual negotiation of private parties.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1481<p>\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

None of URA's car parks use the cashcard parking system.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the 72 HDB car parks, 50 have implemented per minute charging.&nbsp; The remaining 22 will implement per minute charging once their cashcard system has been upgraded with the ERP feature.&nbsp; This is being done progressively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One 65-cents parking coupon allows a motorcyclist to park at a particular car park for either day or night parking, but not at different car parks.&nbsp; With the implementation of the cashcard parking system, motorcyclists are still charged once, ie, they pay 65 cents, for either day or night parking in a particular car park.&nbsp; They can make multiple trips to the same car park for day or night parking without having to pay more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1483<p>\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Committee's recommendations were announced by then Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan last month.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministerial Committee's recommendations set the broad strategic directions for Singapore's R&amp;D landscape for the future.

As part of the planning process, A*STAR has involved many experts and leaders from the research community and industry in Singapore and abroad, as well as the key agencies and ministries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, some 450 researchers from the universities, research institutes and hospitals participated in twelve technology scan panels set up to identify new and emerging technology areas that could enhance Singapore's longer term competitiveness. The universities and clinical research community were also involved in the strategic planning exercise to identify key focus areas and new initiatives in the field of Biomedical Sciences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recommendations arising from the consultation process will serve as critical input to the S&amp;T 2010 Plan.

Conversely, there were fewer complaints in earlier years when there was full employment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was also an increase in the number of complaints on maternity leave benefits last year following publicity on the new marriage and parenthood package to enhance paid maternity benefit from 8 weeks to 12 weeks in October 2004.&nbsp; In addition, the law was amended to also cover executives for paid maternity leave. With more employees being covered by the law, the increase in complaints relating to maternity benefits is not unexpected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All complaints of employment discrimination are investigated by the Ministry. We counsel, warn or take other administrative action against employers who are found to have adopted discriminatory practices.&nbsp; For example in the case of the 'No Indian Guards' incident where the managing agent of a condominium sent a fax to a number of security firms asking them to tender for a contract with a 'No Indian guards' condition, the Ministry had intervened and issued a stern warning to the agent against the discriminatory practice, and the condition was withdrawn by the agent thereafter.&nbsp; Employers who are counselled are receptive to our advice and made the necessary changes to their hiring practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1487<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM does not condone any form of employment discrimination.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry together with the Singapore National Employers' Federation (SNEF) and the National Trades Union Council (NTUC) jointly formulated the Tripartite Guidelines on Non-Discriminatory Job Advertisements in 1999 to guide employers in the selection of candidates.&nbsp; These guidelines advise employers to select candidates on the basis of their merits such as qualifications, skills, experience and other attributes which are relevant to the requirements of the job.&nbsp; Employers should not hire job seekers based on subjective or discriminatory criteria.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the complaints received, we have found that most employers in Singapore are enlightened and adopt fair criteria in selecting and hiring candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry works closely with SNEF and NTUC to educate employers to adopt enlightened and responsible employment practices. At seminars and dialogue sessions with employers, we share progressive as well as unacceptable hiring practices by companies as part of this education process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1487<p>\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Guide dogs can help blind persons to negotiate their way in public places, so that they can better integrate into mainstream society.&nbsp; The dogs also provide valuable companionship for blind persons.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Government regulations regarding the presence of guide dogs in public places are flexible.&nbsp; In the area of public transport, there are provisions in SMRT's regulations that allow a guide dog accompanying a blind person to enter our trains and stations.&nbsp; Guide dogs are allowed in bus interchanges.&nbsp; They are also allowed on public buses as long as they do not cause discomfort to other passengers due to close proximity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the area of environmental health, the Environmental Public Health (Food Hygiene) Regulations currently prohibit live animals or birds in licensed food retail outlets.&nbsp; This is also the case in various other countries for public hygiene reasons.&nbsp; However, some countries have exempted guide dogs from their regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rationale for such an exemption is that being well trained, guide dogs are not likely to compromise environmental hygiene practices, so long as they are harnessed and kept at the owner's side at all times.&nbsp; The National Environment Agency has recently carried out a review, and has decided to grant licensees of food establishments the discretion to allow guide dogs in their premises, so long as the dogs are harnessed and kept at the owner's side at all times.&nbsp; This will come into effect before the end of the year.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--SECTION_NAME:APPENDICES-->\r\n<P><div align=center><B>APPENDICES</B></div><P>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;
