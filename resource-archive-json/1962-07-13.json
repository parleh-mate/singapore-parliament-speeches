In  the  1959  general\r\n\r\nelections, the P.A.P. contested all  the  51\r\n\r\nseats in the Legislative Assembly; 43 of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. candidates were returned, some  with\r\n\r\nlarge  winning margins. It was a  triumphant\r\n\r\nvictory,  and more than half the votes  cast\r\n\r\nwere   polled  for  the  P.A.P.

But alas,\r\n\r\nsuch  is  not the case. No one at that  time\r\n\r\nthought  that  it  would  be  such  a  short\r\n\r\npassing  phase in the history  of  Singapore\r\n\r\npolitics.

Amen!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us briefly catalogue the milestones,\r\n\r\nso  to speak, of the P.A.P.'s downfall. From\r\n\r\nthe original impressive number of 43 out  of\r\n\r\na  total of 51 seats in this House in  1959,\r\n\r\nthe initial P.A.P. majority of 35-43 against\r\n\r\n8 - was first reduced to 29 in 1960. Then came\r\n\r\nthe  split  in  the Party in the  middle  of\r\n\r\n1961,  and the majority was soon reduced  to the uneasy figure of 1. Now, this uneasy one-man   majority  has  been  changed  into   a\r\n\r\nprecarious and untenable one-woman minority.\r\n\r\nSir, can we still have confidence in such  a\r\n\r\nGovernment?  In  July  1961,  with  still  a\r\n\r\nmajority  in  the House, the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nintroduced  a motion to seek the  confidence\r\n\r\nof the House. Yet today - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> To draw a line\r\n\r\nseparating the traitors!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b>- with only an\r\n\r\nuntenable  minority  the  P.A.P. want  to\r\n\r\ncarry on, and to carry on, they have to rely\r\n\r\nvery  heavily on the support of the  S.P.A.-U.M.N.O. Alliance, an organisation which the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leaders used to despise and to  poke\r\n\r\nfun at with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisparaging   remarks.  But   fearing   this\r\n\r\nsupport  may be taken away from  them  soon,\r\n\r\nthe  Government will adjourn the House  sine\r\n\r\ndie   in  the  fond  hope  that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  might  yet  survive  a  wee  bit\r\n\r\nlonger,  a  hope  which the  P.A.P. leaders\r\n\r\nthemselves  know  will  not  and  cannot  be\r\n\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said that the P.A.P. would never ally themselves with the so-called anti-Communist forces which, according to the words of the Prime Minister himself, are often cloaked to hide the\r\n\r\nreactionary  elements ranging from  colonial\r\n\r\nvested  interests to enemies  of  democracy.\r\n\r\nBut  see what has happened today. He has  to\r\n\r\nrely   more  and  more  heavily   on   these\r\n\r\nreactionary  elements that  are  enemies  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  and  he  says  he  is   a   non-Communist. Sir, even a blind man,  I  think,\r\n\r\ncan  see that the P.A.P. Government are  now\r\n\r\non   their   last  legs  and, under   such\r\n\r\ncircumstances, we should probably have  seen\r\n\r\nthe  formation  of  some form  of  coalition\r\n\r\ngovernment - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> S.P.A. and Barisan?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But there is no\r\n\r\ncoalition  government.

The P.A.P., this  year,\r\n\r\nfearing  that  the loss of support and depletion  in\r\n\r\ntheir   rank   and  file  would  allow  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncontingent  to  be totally eclipsed by  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  contingent if the political  Parties  were\r\n\r\nallowed to participate as in previous years, imposed\r\n\r\nall sorts of restrictions on us.

The workers who were scheduled to\r\n\r\nhold  their  own National Day celebrations  had  all\r\n\r\nsorts  of restrictions placed in their way and  they\r\n\r\nwere  compelled  to  cancel a meeting  to  celebrate\r\n\r\nNational  Day.

The  Prime  Minister  talks\r\n\r\ncontemptuously  of the one man one  vote  system,  a\r\n\r\nsystem  which  brought him to power. Let  me  quote,\r\n\r\nSir,  from his speech to civil servants as  reported\r\n\r\nin the Straits Times of the 9th of July, 1962.

There is no free expression of  views  in\r\n\r\nSingapore today, Sir. There is even this clamp  down\r\n\r\nof  news  from the Opposition Parties and  on  other\r\n\r\npolitical   Parties  outside  who  try  to   express\r\n\r\nopposition  to  the  Government's Fascist  measures.\r\n\r\nUnionists, journalists and University students  have\r\n\r\nall   come   out  openly  to  protest  against   the\r\n\r\nundemocratic measures of the Government that further\r\n\r\nand  further limit individual freedom.

Ministers have  got  themselves\r\n\r\ninto such a sorry plight. They would like to ascribe\r\n\r\nall  this  to the Communist bogey, but that  is  not\r\n\r\ntrue.  Why  then  are the people  against  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  today?  I have already  indicated,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat it is the P.A.P. that have destroyed the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nHow,  you  may  ask?  Sir, the fact  is  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleaders  are  the  greatest political  bluffers  and\r\n\r\nopportunists in Singapore history and, as such, they\r\n\r\nare  opportunists  of  the first  order,  completely\r\n\r\nwithout  scruples and without principles of  decency\r\n\r\nand  fair play. I do not wish to open up old scores,\r\n\r\nSir,  but there are strong rumours current  in  town\r\n\r\nthat the P.A.P. leaders are not completely free from\r\n\r\npolitical  guilt  in  the dirty political  purge  of\r\n\r\n1956, although such political dirty work was carried\r\n\r\nout   entirely  by  the  reactionary  Lim  Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment. You see, Sir, our Ministers  have  posed\r\n\r\nas Leftists for a long time and have managed to pose\r\n\r\nas  Leftists  because the genuine Left-wing  leaders\r\n\r\nhave been prevented from performing their legitimate\r\n\r\nrole  as  a  result of political repression.  It  is\r\n\r\nbecause  they had posed so successfully and well  as\r\n\r\nthe  Left that they were voted into office and power\r\n\r\nin  1959. However, it is much easier to pose as  the\r\n\r\nLeft  than  to  be  Left, and then  when  they  were\r\n\r\nexposed  as humbugs and shams, they began  to  fight\r\n\r\ntheir  own comrades and colleagues in order to  keep\r\n\r\nup  the  pretence and humbug and in  order  to  keep\r\n\r\nthemselves  in  office. I say, Sir,  these  are  the\r\n\r\nruthless opportunists who tenaciously hold on to the\r\n\r\nreins  of government in spite of the fact that  they\r\n\r\nhave been completely discredited and in spite of the\r\n\r\nfact  that they are no more supported by the people.\r\n\r\nWe  realise they always have their plausible set  of\r\n\r\nrationalisations   and  justifications   for   their\r\n\r\nopportunistic  act  of  perfidy  to  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Sir,  these  are  the  so-called  social\r\n\r\ndemocrats  who, because if their numerous somersault\r\n\r\ndistortions and disreputable public utterances, have\r\n\r\nbecome a discredit to true democrats. They say, Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat they love the beautiful system of parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy. But the Prime Minister has just come  out\r\n\r\nopenly to say that the one man one vote system is  a\r\n\r\ntragedy  in the context of Singapore. They say  they\r\n\r\nare  democrats,  but they claim that  democracy  can\r\n\r\nonly   be  saved  by  dishonest,  undemocratic   and\r\n\r\ndictatorial  methods.  They  say  they  cherish  the\r\n\r\nfreedom of the Press, but the Press is subjected  to\r\n\r\nsuch  tight  control  that  there  is  already   one\r\n\r\nnewspaper, the Min Pao, that has been compelled  to\r\n\r\nsuspend publication indefinitely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Sir, newspaper space for Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers on whatever they say in this House has  been\r\n\r\ncut  down  to  less than one-third;  two-thirds  of\r\n\r\nnewspaper  space  must  be reserved  for  Government\r\n\r\nBenches. For example, Sir, yesterday when the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson moved his motion and later on when  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs replied, one full page was\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the  speech  by  the  Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs,  and  only a scraggy couple of columns - less\r\n\r\nthan  a  couple of columns - I do not think  it  could\r\n\r\neven  be  a  column, in some corner,  Sir,  for  the\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson. This is a disgraceful method  of\r\n\r\npressure  on  the  Press.  They  say  they  are  not\r\n\r\nFascists  and  that  they  allow  people  to  freely\r\n\r\nexpress  their views and opinions. Yet when a  group\r\n\r\nof trade unions got together to hold a convention in\r\n\r\nconnexion  with  the referendum, the unionists  were\r\n\r\nprohibited  from  holding  the  meeting   and   from\r\n\r\nexpressing  their  views. More recently,  they  also\r\n\r\nbarred  the  Council of Joint Action from conducting\r\n\r\nits  lawful  and constitutional campaign or  protest\r\n\r\nagainst  the  dishonesty  and  dictatorship  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. by holding rallies and conventions in  order\r\n\r\nthat  its  views  on the merger  issue  and  on  the\r\n\r\nreferendum might be communicated to the people. They\r\n\r\nsay they allow the people of Singapore the final say\r\n\r\non  the  future of Singapore and on the question  of\r\n\r\nmerger.  But  in  the  forthcoming  referendum,  the\r\n\r\npeople  will  not  be allowed  to  say  'no'  to  the\r\n\r\nalternatives offered to them. They are  only  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nalternatives foisted on the people-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

As  a  minority Government that  refuse  to\r\n\r\nbudge  from  their cushy seats of power  after  they\r\n\r\nhave  lost  the  support of the people,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  today  cannot be  expected  to  have  any\r\n\r\nconsideration for political principles and  for  the\r\n\r\nnormal  standards of decency and fair play.

Not only are they a minority  Government\r\n\r\nbut  in  each of the constituencies of the Ministers\r\n\r\nand the other P.A.P.

The chances are that  should  the\r\n\r\nMinisters go back to their respective constituencies\r\n\r\nin  a general election, most of them will lose their\r\n\r\ndeposits. A Gallup poll in Tanjong Pagar should tell\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister what chances he will have if  he\r\n\r\nshould  dare go back to Tanjong Pagar.

This is the P.A.P. sell-out. One extra  day\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P.'s existence and P.A.P. misrule  will\r\n\r\nmean one extra day of unhappiness for the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  As the P.A.P. no longer have a  majority\r\n\r\nin the House, it is our duty as Parliamentarians and\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people of Singapore  to  take\r\n\r\nthe   necessary  stand  and  action  to  compel  the\r\n\r\nminority Government to go back to the people. We  in\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis believe that there is no other\r\n\r\nalternative  before the country than to compel  this\r\n\r\ndiscredited  and  dishonest minority  Government  to\r\n\r\nresign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>\r\n\r\nYou should have resigned yourself!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> To summarise, the P.A.P. today\r\n\r\nhave,  because of their selfish interests,  deviated\r\n\r\nfrom their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noriginal    stand   of   democratic    non-Communist\r\n\r\nsocialism.  They  are now dishonest and  dictatorial\r\n\r\nand  have  lost  the support of the masses.  In  the\r\n\r\nwords of the Prime Minister himself, the P.A.P. have\r\n\r\ndestroyed the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Five-Year Plan, which is also known as \"The\r\n\r\nTasks  Ahead\", represents the mandate that was given\r\n\r\nto  the  P.A.P. in the 1959 general elections.  All\r\n\r\nthose  promises  in the Five-Year Plan   \"The  Tasks\r\n\r\nAhead\"  - have  been forgotten, and all  because  of\r\n\r\nwhat?  It is because the Prime Minister thinks  that\r\n\r\nby  playing about with merger, he could distract the\r\n\r\npeople's attention from the promises which  he  gave\r\n\r\nto  the  people of Singapore. At the present moment,\r\n\r\nSir,  the Government is not a Government run by  the\r\n\r\nelected  representatives of  the  people.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nGovernment which is self-running. The civil servants\r\n\r\nrun  the  Government,  Sir, It makes  no  difference\r\n\r\nwhether the P.A.P. Government is there or not.  They\r\n\r\nhave  lost already all justification to remain as  a\r\n\r\nGovernment.  There  is  no Government  in  Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday  truly  run  by  the elected  leaders  of  the\r\n\r\npeople. The Prime Minister had said a few years  ago\r\n\r\nthat  if  we  want  to run a democracy  and  a  good\r\n\r\ngovernment,  we must have the people  on  our  side.\r\n\r\nToday  we  cannot  allow  the  Government  that  has\r\n\r\nalready  lost the support of the masses  to  pretend\r\n\r\nthat it still is a respected elected government.  We\r\n\r\ncannot  also allow the vicious communal line of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. propaganda, under the cloak of nationalism in\r\n\r\nthe  controversy of the merger issue,  to  continue.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  very dangerous drift which  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncommunalists must stop. One of the ways of  stopping\r\n\r\nthis  is to stop them as a Government because  today\r\n\r\nthey  have all the facilities of propaganda in their\r\n\r\nhands.  They are the people who can stir up communal\r\n\r\nfeelings. I will not go much further, Sir, except to\r\n\r\nsay  that we must hold a general election so that  a\r\n\r\nnew government may be formed that can really have  a\r\n\r\nnew  mandate to continue our constitutional struggle\r\n\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Let me remind the Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nthat  nothing came out of those constitutional talks\r\n\r\nunder  the  leadership of David Marshall.

I was\r\n\r\nattracted  by one short verse. I think  it  was  by\r\n\r\nLongfellow, and it reads like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"He who is down need fear no fall,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who is low no pride;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who is humble ever shall\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have God to be his guide,\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of the arrogance of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. that even the gods frowned on them and showed\r\n\r\ntheir  displeasure  by causing a water  shortage  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.

Dishonesty - both  are  dishonest.\r\n\r\nParty  considerations above national  interests - both\r\n\r\ncome  from  the  same school and practise  the  same\r\n\r\nthings. Sell-out of the interests of Singapore. Now,\r\n\r\nwhat  is  this sell-out? A sell-out of the interests\r\n\r\nof  Singapore by doing their best to achieve  merger\r\n\r\nto  serve  the interests of Singapore; or a sell-out\r\n\r\nof   the  interests  of  Singapore  by  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis to the Communist cause. I do not know  when\r\n\r\nthe  sell-out ends. Sell-out to achieve  merger, as\r\n\r\nthe  end result, will mean prosperity, happiness and\r\n\r\nsecurity  for the people of Singapore;  whereas  the\r\n\r\nsell-out  of  the Barisan Sosialis to the  Communist\r\n\r\ncause will bring misery, despair and hardship to the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the Barisan Sosialis said earlier - I\r\n\r\nthink  he  used the word \"destined\" twice - that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. was destined to have a brilliant future.

Did not the S.P.A../U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nAlliance  then  say, \"We have no confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\"? What did the Barisan Sosialis  do - the\r\n\r\n13 bright stars? If then they had meant to pull the\r\n\r\nGovernment down, they could have voted with us,  but\r\n\r\nthey  abstained. Why did they abstain then, but want\r\n\r\nto  do  it  now? Why did they abstain then when  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  was given to them? Was it because  they\r\n\r\nhad not received fresh orders yet? Or was it because\r\n\r\nthey were caught unawares and they did not know what\r\n\r\nto  do?  If  they  really had no confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and I am sure they had not if one were to\r\n\r\nbelieve  the  lengthy  speech  of  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown when he recited the crimes of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nfor the past three years - then why did the 13 bright\r\n\r\nstars in the Barisan Sosialis abstain? Why did they\r\n\r\nnot  vote with us against the Government and express\r\n\r\nno confidence in it? They did not do it. And now, it\r\n\r\nseems  funny, they  have  tabled  a  motion  of  no\r\n\r\nconfidence. Why? From the long speech of the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown, it is clear that they kept on their\r\n\r\nfight  wanting to wreck referendum and merger  every\r\n\r\nstep of the way - from the merger debate in November\r\n\r\nto  the debate on the motion by the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nfor  a  referendum  to be held, through  the  Second\r\n\r\nReading of the National Referendum Bill right up  to\r\n\r\nthe  Committee Stage and still right up to the Third\r\n\r\nReading;  and  still  further they  kept  on  going.\r\n\r\nDuring  this series of sittings, every day we  heard\r\n\r\nnothing  from them but a disclosure of their  desire\r\n\r\nto  wreck the merger referendum.

As usual, he tried to  give  us\r\n\r\nhis assessment of the security situation up to date.\r\n\r\nHe  said  that  what is happening  today  follows  a\r\n\r\nsimilar  pattern in 1956 and 1957, and yet he  takes\r\n\r\nno action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Emperor Nero fiddled while Rome burnt. Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Lee plays zugzwang while Singapore  burns.\r\n\r\nSir, the people of Singapore cannot afford  such  a\r\n\r\nluxury.  The  threat  is  genuine.  The  threat   is\r\n\r\ngrowing,  so  says the Prime Minister.  And  yet  he\r\n\r\nsaid, \"Huh, I have got them in a zugzwang. Huh, they\r\n\r\ncould  not move.\" That is not the way to look  after\r\n\r\nthe internal security and economic well-being of the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore. It is not a game. The  way  is\r\n\r\nclear and simple. If I were a medical man and if you\r\n\r\nhad a bad leg, I would advise you to chop it off. So\r\n\r\nif  you  have bad Communists and bad Communist-front\r\n\r\nleaders in the political arena in Singapore, use the\r\n\r\nguillotine  on  them.  I hope when  the  12  o'clock\r\n\r\nguillotine falls tonight, it will spell the doom  of\r\n\r\nthose  who are so foolish as to be  led by the  known\r\n\r\ncommunists and Communist-front leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in fact, the Prime Minister laughed at me and\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Ah, look at them, the foolish Lim  Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment!  I  was on the other side  planning  the\r\n\r\ngame of zugzwang and he got caught.\" And he said,  I\r\n\r\nam  not  going to get caught like this poor  foolish\r\n\r\nLim Yew Hock!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not solve the situation, because there\r\n\r\nwere  men  then who were prepared to work  with  the\r\n\r\nCommunists to achieve their own political ends.  The\r\n\r\naction I took could be said to be  not enough.  There\r\n\r\nwere  still  a  number  of pockets  left  untouched,\r\n\r\nbecause then I still was a democratic animal. But if\r\n\r\nI had known that there was going to be that group of\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  leaders  who are still in  the  P.A.P. now,\r\n\r\nstill  working with them and planning with them  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections were a great success for them  in\r\n\r\n1959  I would not have hesitated. And if I had known\r\n\r\nthen that the Prime Minister was consorting with the\r\n\r\nperson  he called \"The Plen\". I would have sent  him\r\n\r\nto  keep Lim Ching Siong company in gaol, so that he\r\n\r\ncould  at  least have some re-thinking as Devan  Nair\r\n\r\nhad, re-thinking to some good purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wise after the event, Sir, but it is all right.

I  hope\r\n\r\nthey will be wiser after his debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister is still in a stalemate.\r\n\r\nHe  does not believe that the only way to check  the\r\n\r\ndanger  is  to  withdraw the source  of  danger.  He\r\n\r\nbelieves  in playing a game of chess, and in  trying\r\n\r\nto sell his idea of his own particular form of game,\r\n\r\nhe  has  made  12  awful disclosures  through  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore, now  enshrined in what he  describes  as\r\n\r\n\"The  Battle  for Merger\". This book  contains  many\r\n\r\nawful  disclosures, but what is more relevant to  my\r\n\r\namendment  is  that  a number of persons  have  been\r\n\r\nnamed as Communists and Communist-front leaders.  It\r\n\r\nhas   described  the  Barisan  Sosialis   as   being\r\n\r\nmanipulated  and controlled by the Communists.  This\r\n\r\nis  evidence produced by the Government. Because  of\r\n\r\nthe evidence here, which has not been refuted by the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis.  I  have seen  fit  to  table  an\r\n\r\namendment to name the Barisan Sosialis as one of the\r\n\r\norganisations   that  are  being   manipulated   and\r\n\r\ncontrolled  by subversive forces. I do not  know  it\r\n\r\nmyself because I am not in the Government, but I  am\r\n\r\nprepared  to  accept the word of our Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwhen  he  said  that the Barisan Sosialis  is  being\r\n\r\ncontrolled  and  manipulated by the  Communists.  He\r\n\r\neven  went  to  the extent of making a  few awful,\r\n\r\ndisclosures   about  the  Members  of  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  If  I  may seek your indulgence,  Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to quote from this great masterpiece  of\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister who has seen fit  to  say  that\r\n\r\nCommunist and Communist-front leaders should receive\r\n\r\nhonourable   mention  in  the  book  and   also   in\r\n\r\nbroadcasts over Radio Singapore. I believe the  only\r\n\r\nway  to give them honourable mention is to put  them\r\n\r\nin  Changi, but he believes otherwise. He gives them\r\n\r\nan  honourable place even in a book which  is  being\r\n\r\nsold at one dollar. He gives them honourable mention\r\n\r\nover  Radio Singapore. He has one interesting  thing\r\n\r\nto  say about the leader of the Barisan Sosialis.  I\r\n\r\nquote  from  page  95  at the  bottom  of  the  last\r\n\r\nparagraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Yet Dr Lee (that is, the Member for Queenstown)\r\n\r\nin   an  interview  reported  in  the  Guardian   on\r\n\r\nSeptember 22, stated, \"I am not a Communist, and, if\r\n\r\nI  became  convinced there were  Communists  in  our\r\n\r\nparty  I  would  expose  them  and  let  the  people\r\n\r\ndecide.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But instead of exposing them, he aided and abetted\r\n\r\nthem by acting as a courier. In other words, he  was\r\n\r\nlike a post box for someone from Sarawak. This, Sir,\r\n\r\nis  in  direct contradiction of an earlier statement\r\n\r\nby the Prime Minister in an earlier disclosure. That\r\n\r\ncan be  found at page 73, second paragraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"They used Dr Lee Siew Choh as the front leader of\r\n\r\nthis group. Dr Lee had told Dr Goh and me that he\r\n\r\nwas convinced that so long as the British bases were\r\n\r\nleft  untouched, it would be perfectly all right  to\r\n\r\nrun   a   pro-Communist  government  with  Communist\r\n\r\nsupport in Singapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this has not been denied or challenged by the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown. In fact, he could have taken\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister to court on this. But he did not.\r\n\r\nSo  what is the conclusion to be arrived at  by  any\r\n\r\none,  any  third  party or any disinterested  party,\r\n\r\nthat what the Prime Minister said was the truth  and\r\n\r\nnothing but the truth?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so in a simple paragraph, you know the mind\r\n\r\nof  the Member for Queenstown, why he is standing up\r\n\r\nin  this  Assembly talking so much and  claiming  to\r\n\r\nfight  for  the interests of the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwhen  he  admitted  chat it would be  perfectly  all\r\n\r\nright   to  run  a  pro-Communist  government   with\r\n\r\nCommunist  support in Singapore. And yet I  heard  a\r\n\r\nfew    interjections   of   \"Dishonest, dishonest,\r\n\r\ndishonest!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask the Member for Queenstown to be\r\n\r\nhonest  at  least with himself, if not with  anybody\r\n\r\nelse.

He  said  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment poked fun at the S.P.A./U.M.N.O. Alliance\r\n\r\nwith  disparaging  and insulting  remarks.  What  he\r\n\r\nmeant  to suggest to us was now is the time to  take\r\n\r\nour   revenge.  Sir,  as  a  responsible  Opposition\r\n\r\nconscious  of the heavy burden that now  falls  upon\r\n\r\nus,  since the Government is now a minority of  one,\r\n\r\nwe  will  not be deterred from even voting with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment on any issues that are meant for the good\r\n\r\nof  the people of Singapore, on any issues that will\r\n\r\nmean the extermination of the Communist pest. If  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  insulted  in the past  three  years - the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis are not free from blame; when  they\r\n\r\nwere  there,  they did the same thing; they  are  as\r\n\r\nequally  guilty  as  the P.A.P. - must  a  responsible\r\n\r\nOpposition  take  note  of such  insults  that  were\r\n\r\nheaped upon us? We want to tell the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nthat  we can take it and take very much more  if  in\r\n\r\ntaking  it  we  are  guided in the  service  of  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people of Singapore. So let me tell\r\n\r\nthe leader of the Barisan Sosialis that there is  no\r\n\r\nneed   for   him   to   attempt  to   ridicule   the\r\n\r\nS.P.A./U.M.N.O  Alliance so that we  can  be  veered\r\n\r\nfrom doing our duty as a responsive organisation. On\r\n\r\nthe  one  hand,  the leader of the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\ntries to make us feel spiteful and vengeful.

It is for them  to  deny\r\n\r\nthis.  They  were the people who told the Government\r\n\r\nnot  to  resign after the defeat at Hong  Lim.  They\r\n\r\nshould  not come to this august Assembly to distorts\r\n\r\nfacts  and  try to make out that they are  the  true\r\n\r\nchampions  of democracy when they have been  charged\r\n\r\nin  this  book  [Indicating]  that  they  are  being\r\n\r\nmanipulated   and   controlled  by   Communist   and\r\n\r\nCommunist-front leaders to damage the  security  and\r\n\r\nwell-being  of  the  people of  Singapore.  No  one,\r\n\r\nespecially  we  the Front Benchers here,  will  ever\r\n\r\nswallow  any distortion, any threat, any attempt  by\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis to deter us  from  doing  our\r\n\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another thing. Sir, they try to ridicule us.\r\n\r\nThey  say.  \"Well, the S.P.A./U.M.N.O.

The people might misunderstand  you\r\n\r\nand  think you are anti-Chinese.\" I am glad to  see,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  today he frankly and openly, in  public,\r\n\r\ndeclares  strongly his anti-Communist stand,  and  I\r\n\r\ntrust  it  means that he recognises that  today  our\r\n\r\npopulace and our citizens do distinguish between the\r\n\r\nChinese and the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, the original motion before the\r\n\r\nHouse is a motion to express the deep antagonism  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore for a lifetime  of  three\r\n\r\nyears  of  crime  of  the  P.A.P.  The  Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill himself recognises that their crimes  have\r\n\r\nbeen  manifold and grievous. I say it is unnecessary\r\n\r\nto single out one aspect when there are so many; but\r\n\r\nsince  he  has seen fit to single out one aspect.  I\r\n\r\nwant to say to him that I am happy to support him in\r\n\r\nhis  attack on Communism; I am happy to support  him\r\n\r\nin  his attack on the Communists in this area;  for,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, progress in the democratic process has,\r\n\r\nI  think, awakened more and more people to the basic\r\n\r\nevil  of Communist dictatorship and its dangers  for\r\n\r\nthis  territory, an evil that is, if possible - it  is\r\n\r\npossible.  Sir - even greater than the evil  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Fascist Government. Sir, insofar as the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  alleged that he has  information  and\r\n\r\nevidence in respect of persons in Singapore who  are\r\n\r\nCommunists. I agree with the Member for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCairnhill  in  condemning  him  and  condemning  the\r\n\r\nGovernment for not making that evidence available in\r\n\r\na court of law and for not charging those persons so\r\n\r\nthat  they  might  be  dealt with.  Sir,  there  are\r\n\r\ncourts,   and  there  are  laws  against  Communism.\r\n\r\nInsofar  as there might be an implication  that  the\r\n\r\nP.P.S.O. should be used - I would wish. Sir,  not\r\n\r\nto  evade any aspect of this motion; I say  to  you,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Cairnhill knows my  stand;  it  has\r\n\r\nalways been the same - the P.P.S.O. is a breach in the\r\n\r\nrule  of law necessary to meet emergency situations.\r\n\r\nIt  should be  used in an emergency or to prevent an\r\n\r\nemergency, not otherwise. And he knows, having  been\r\n\r\nin   association  with  me  in  the  enactment   and\r\n\r\nimplementation  of this law, that  that  has  always\r\n\r\nbeen  my  stand, not its utilisation  as  a  routine\r\n\r\nmeasure.  Sir, but its utilisation when there  is  a\r\n\r\ngenuine threat to the security of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it irks indeed, and irks very much, that the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister himself, who of all people  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry  should  know the law  and  should  seek  to\r\n\r\ncomply  with  the  law, should refrain  from  taking\r\n\r\naction   against   known   criminals - such   known\r\n\r\nCommunists - and  thereby make  himself  an  accessory\r\n\r\nafter the fact. That he should be  condemned is right\r\n\r\nand  proper. Even more, Mr Speaker, it is right and\r\n\r\nproper  to  condemn the Government for  using  these\r\n\r\nvery  men as an excuse for measures endangering  the\r\n\r\nwelfare,  the harmony and the unity of  our  people,\r\n\r\nsuch as section 29 of the Referendum Ordinance which\r\n\r\nwas  introduced on the excuse that these people  may\r\n\r\ncommit  certain  offences. If they could  have  been\r\n\r\ndealt  with  by  our  courts,  then  at  least  that\r\n\r\nspecious excuse would not have been utilised. To the\r\n\r\nextent  that  such people have not been charged  for\r\n\r\nmeasures  endangering the welfare of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. I agree with the Member for Cairnhill  in\r\n\r\ncondemning the Government. But, Sir, I ask  whether.\r\n\r\nin fact, the Member for Cairnhill genuinely condemns\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  You see, Sir, he has  phrased  his\r\n\r\namendment not merely to condemn the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment, not as a vote of no confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  not  as  a  vote  of  censure  on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  but also as a vote of  censure  on  the\r\n\r\nmajority  Party in the Opposition.  It  is,  Sir,  a\r\n\r\ndouble vote of censure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri:</b> Not by the vote of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It is a clever parliamentary trick,\r\n\r\na  red  herring  in  order to prevent  the  vote  of\r\n\r\ncensure from succeeding, in fact, you have heard the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister say that in the light of  the\r\n\r\nmanner  in which the Member for Cairnhill has  moved\r\n\r\nhis  amendment, they do not consider it to be  a vote\r\n\r\nof  censure  at  all. I understood  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill to have said, long before the series of 12\r\n\r\nradio  talks  on \"How I stab my friends and  double-cross   my  colleagues\"  was  given  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  that he and his Party and his  colleagues\r\n\r\nvoted   against   a  vote  of  confidence   in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Sir, he recognises now, in the words  of\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy  Prime Minister, that by virtue  of  his\r\n\r\namendment the motion of censure is no longer  deemed\r\n\r\nto  be a motion of censure because it is turned upon\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis. I ask you, Mr Speaker,  are\r\n\r\nthe words \"like the Barisan Sosialis\" in this motion\r\n\r\nin  any  way  pertinent to the  motion  because,  by\r\n\r\nspeaking  of  \"Communist-front leaders  manipulating\r\n\r\nand   controlling   organisations\", he   obviously\r\n\r\nimplies,   in  the  plural,  that  there  are   many\r\n\r\norganisations, why then limit it to one, if in  fact\r\n\r\nthat  is a Communist front organisation and  if,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  he seeks to condemn the Government? Why  does\r\n\r\nhe limit the example to one? Why have any example at\r\n\r\nall, Mr Speaker? On what basis does he say that the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis are Communist controlled? He  says,\r\n\r\n\"I  accept the statement of the Prime Minister  that\r\n\r\nthey  are Communist-controlled.\" I must confess that\r\n\r\nI am surprised, Mr Speaker, that in a matter of the\r\n\r\nmajor  Opposition  Party he  so  lightly  accepts  a\r\n\r\nstatement of the Government, which has proved itself\r\n\r\npolitically  dishonest in many  respects,  as  being\r\n\r\nevidence  that  the Barisan Sosialis are,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nCommunist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontrolled.  I  say  to you, Mr Speaker, that  the\r\n\r\nwords   \"like  the  Barisan  Sosialis\"  are   wholly\r\n\r\nunnecessary  to the operative words of  that  motion\r\n\r\nand  are  indeed intended to defeat the  motion.  By\r\n\r\nseeking  to  ask  the  Barisan Sosialis  to  condemn\r\n\r\nthemselves,  which  he knows he cannot  do,  because\r\n\r\nthey   deny   they  are  Communist  controlled,   he\r\n\r\ntherefore  wants them to vote against the motion  in\r\n\r\norder  to  save the Government, whereas  the  S.P.A.\r\n\r\nwill  vote in favour of the motion. Mr Speaker,  he\r\n\r\nrather  let the cat out of the bag when he  appealed\r\n\r\nto  me - and I appreciate the appeal, Sir - to recognise\r\n\r\nand reassess the position, because to bring down the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would mean an end of the referendum  and\r\n\r\nan  end of the immediate negotiation for merger.  So\r\n\r\nhe  made it known that he does not want to bring the\r\n\r\nGovernment to an end and he does not want a vote  of\r\n\r\nno confidence in the Government. This is a bit of an\r\n\r\neyewash.  Roaring to the bushes that he  is  looking\r\n\r\nfor wars, like Flagstaff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I trust you will permit me - it is incidental and arising out of what the Member for Cairnhill said - to explain my position with reference to this motion of no confidence. I will be very brief, Mr Speaker. I am convinced that the\r\n\r\nperfidy of -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it the hon.

I\r\n\r\ntake it, i.e. if the guillotine does not fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Indeed, Mr Speaker, I will abide by\r\n\r\nyour   ruling,  if  you  think  I  cannot  make   an\r\n\r\nexplanation.  I was asked why I wanted  to  vote  in\r\n\r\nfavour of a censure motion on the Government in the\r\n\r\nlight  of the fact that it might endanger merger.  I\r\n\r\nthought  I would like the opportunity of explaining,\r\n\r\nif  you will permit, Sir. It is because of this that\r\n\r\nI  believe - it may be I am wrong, Sir; many  disagree\r\n\r\nwith  me - that the merger proposals as  they  stand,\r\n\r\nthrough  the referendum as it stands, would endanger\r\n\r\nthe stability of this area in the not distant future\r\n\r\nand that if, in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfact, they were to fail at the present juncture,  we\r\n\r\nwould  have  a  permanent basis in  the  foreseeable\r\n\r\nfuture for happy permanent relations. It is a matter\r\n\r\nof  temporary postponement and no more. I will go on\r\n\r\nfrom  there, Sir, having, I trust, not taken up  too\r\n\r\nmuch time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Member for Cairnhill - I am\r\n\r\nsorry he cannot answer, Sir, but perhaps a Member of\r\n\r\nhis  Party could - whether it is just at this juncture\r\n\r\nto  condemn the Barisan Sosialis on the word of  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister alone, and whether it is appropriate\r\n\r\nat  this juncture to move a double-headed motion  of\r\n\r\ncensure.  You  know, Sir, there is a phrase  that  I\r\n\r\nlearned as a small boy about \"Slowly, slowly,  catch\r\n\r\nmonkey\" - one thing at a time. Sir, let us  have  this\r\n\r\nmotion first which deals with the Government. In due\r\n\r\ncourse, if and when the occasion arises and there is\r\n\r\nevidence  that  the Barisan Sosialis  are  Communist\r\n\r\ncontrolled, I would be only too happy to support him\r\n\r\nin  a  vote  of  no confidence or an analogous  vote\r\n\r\nagainst the Barisan Sosialis themselves. But  it  is\r\n\r\ninappropriate at this juncture because it is  a  red\r\n\r\nherring and seeks to abort itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment seeks to prevent itself from being\r\n\r\npassed  by preventing a major Opposition group, quite unnecessarily, from voting in favour of the amendment he seeks. Mr Speaker,  I\r\n\r\nhave  a  very minor amendment to make, an  amendment\r\n\r\nwhich I hope they  will accept  and which will still deal with the so-called\r\n\r\ndemocrats  who  threaten and strangle  democracy  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and who threaten the lives of our  people.\r\n\r\nIt  is a simple amendment, Sir, It is a deletion  of\r\n\r\nthe  words which are completely unnecessary  to  the\r\n\r\nspirit  and  intent of the motion. I move  that  the\r\n\r\nwords \"like the Barisan Sosialis\" be left out. If he\r\n\r\nwill  accept that, I will be happy to vote  for  his\r\n\r\namendment, although, in fact, Sir, I am a  supporter\r\n\r\nof  the  main  one. I say the P.A.P. have  committed\r\n\r\ninnumerable crimes. I shall speak on that  if  there\r\n\r\nis time on the main Question.

But I say, do  not  abort\r\n\r\nyour  own  amendment by making it impossible  for  a\r\n\r\nmajor   political  Party  to  support  it  and   by\r\n\r\ncondemning a major Opposition Party without adequate\r\n\r\nevidence  as being Communist controlled.

As I said earlier, Sir, the Member for  Anson\r\n\r\nis  honest in his desire to see that justice is done\r\n\r\nwhen  injustice has been perpetuated.  I  was  right\r\n\r\nalso  when  I said he will still stand for democracy\r\n\r\nagainst Communist forces. But then he asked me,  how\r\n\r\nit  is I have named the Barisan Sosialis and on what\r\n\r\nevidence?  I  accept  the  statement  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  The  Member for Anson even  went  to  the\r\n\r\nextent of saying that when he was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  little  boy  in  school he  was  saying  \"Slowly,\r\n\r\nslowly, catchee monkey.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the leaders who are now running the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   were   people  whom  the   Labour   Front\r\n\r\nGovernment  detained as Communist  subversives.  The\r\n\r\nfact  that  the P.A.P. came out openly  without  any\r\n\r\npretence and defence and nail them for what they are\r\n\r\njust  proves  that what the Lim Yew Hock  Government\r\n\r\ndid  was right. The same men are running the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis today in as much as they were, in my  view,\r\n\r\nCommunist  subversives - they are still, in  my  view,\r\n\r\nCommunist  subversives. It is  quite  fair  for  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  to ask why  I  should  name  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis. It is something  like  a  double-headed  motion, Sir, If the Member for  Anson  wants\r\n\r\nto  learn why, let me tell him that this motion  is\r\n\r\nnot  aimed  at the Government. The Member for  Anson\r\n\r\nfeels  strongly  against  the  evil  deeds  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  But  the  Barisan  Sosialis   are   not\r\n\r\ngoverned  by such pure sentiments. They are  out  to\r\n\r\nridicule  the Singapore People's Alliance. That  was\r\n\r\nwhat they said. It was clear in their speeches. \"Ha!\r\n\r\nThe  S.P.A.-U.M.N.O.- Alliance want to share  in  the\r\n\r\nspoils.  They  are  sure not to let  the  Government\r\n\r\nfall.\" In as much as they tried to do it on us,  it\r\n\r\nis  not  political  trickery; it  is  fair  game  in\r\n\r\npolitics  to nail them as they try to nail  us.  Let\r\n\r\nthem  wriggle out of that. But it has to be left  to\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson to come to their defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he asked whether I was sincere in my\r\n\r\ncondemnation of the Government. All I can  ask  him,\r\n\r\nSir, is for him to refer to Hansard of the 21st July\r\n\r\nwhen the Government tabled the motion of confidence.\r\n\r\nHe made his speech. I made my speech. Members of the\r\n\r\nS.P.A.  Alliance made their speeches. It is  clearly\r\n\r\nstated  here  that  we  have no  confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  But today, because of the manipulations\r\n\r\nof  the  Communists in trying to  wreck  merger  and\r\n\r\nbringing up a motion to try to discredit the  S.P.A.,\r\n\r\nit  is  but  fair  that the S.P.A. should  name  the\r\n\r\nCommunists for what they are.

With  this\r\n\r\namendment, it may be that the Members of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  can show their true colours in  regard  to\r\n\r\nthis  matter.  They  have been charged  on  numerous\r\n\r\noccasions,  as contained in the book issued  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  that the Barisan Sosialis  is  a  Party\r\n\r\nwhere the strength of the Communists lies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No other Member wishes to speak on\r\n\r\nthe amendment to the amendment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendment\r\n\r\nto  the amendment only seeks to leave out the  words\r\n\r\n\"like the Barisan Sosialis\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today the P.A.P.

I will speak again  on\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Cairnhill's amendment. This is only\r\n\r\na  red herring, as was pointed out by the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson.  It is to give a chance to the S.P.A. not  to\r\n\r\nvote  against the Government in the original motion.\r\n\r\nYou  see, the S.P.A. want to support the P.A.P. yet\r\n\r\nthey  do not want to support it openly. So the  only\r\n\r\nway  for  the  S.P.A., under the  circumstances,  in\r\n\r\norder to get out of their trouble, is to draw a  red\r\n\r\nherring  across the trail and say something else  to\r\n\r\ndivert  attention from the original motion.

If there are\r\n\r\nthe  words  \"like the Barisan Sosialis\", then  there\r\n\r\nmay  be   some doubt that it may be confined only  to\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties  or to bodies  like  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  which are akin in nature. But  with  those\r\n\r\nwords  left  out,  as I understand it,  the  ejusdem\r\n\r\ngeneris clause does not apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for those Members opposite who are not\r\n\r\nfamiliar  with  the  rules  that  guide  people   in\r\n\r\nconstruing  and  interpreting  documents,   let   me\r\n\r\nexplain,  particularly to the Member for Queenstown,\r\n\r\nthe  purport of the amendment to the amendment moved\r\n\r\nby   the   Member  for  Anson.  If  we   say   \"from\r\n\r\nmanipulating and controlling organisations\"  without\r\n\r\nthe words \"like the Barisan Sosialis\" you have given\r\n\r\nno  example. Therefore, it is all organisations - old\r\n\r\nboys'  associations, back-scratching  associations,\r\n\r\ngrandmothers'    and   grandchildren's    friendship\r\n\r\nassociations and-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mothers' Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> -Mothers' Day Committee, Trade\r\n\r\nUnions  Working Committee, Council of Joint  Action,\r\n\r\nHuman  Rights  Committee,  Banging  of  Woodensticks\r\n\r\nCommittee, and so on. [Interruption] No, no, this is\r\n\r\nserious.  I am giving an example. Now, if the  words\r\n\r\n\"like  the  Barisan Sosialis\" remain,  then  in  the\r\n\r\nexecution of this directive one will have to  go  by\r\n\r\nthe  yardstick. Is the Council of Joint Action  like\r\n\r\nor  unlike the Barisan Sosialis? Is the Trade Unions\r\n\r\nWorking   Committee  like  or  unlike  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis?   Because  we  have  given   an   example,\r\n\r\ntherefore we are covered by a rule of interpretation\r\n\r\nwhich  says, if you have given a series of examples,\r\n\r\nthen  all  the  others must be  like  them -  ejusdem\r\n\r\ngeneris - of the same genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I thought it was the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill who gave the example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Well, exactly. The Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill, I think without a proper grasp  of  legal\r\n\r\nprinciples  and so on, probably thought in  his  own\r\n\r\nlayman's way that if he pinpoints it on the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  then  everybody will  understand - I  mean\r\n\r\nlike   the  Member  for  Queenstown  who  is   being\r\n\r\nmanipulated and controlled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What about Radio P.A.P.?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> But the Member for Anson quite\r\n\r\nrightly,  I think, has done a service to this  House\r\n\r\nby  removing  this  restriction which  probably  was\r\n\r\nnever intended by the Member for Cairnhill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the stand of the P.A.P. is quite simple. On\r\n\r\nthe   amendment,  Sir,  there  is  no  question   of\r\n\r\nconfidence.  This  is  an amendment.  It  is  not  a\r\n\r\nmotion. Therefore, it is not a motion of confidence.\r\n\r\nIt  can be voted upon; we shall abstain and it is up\r\n\r\nto  the  Opposition to give the country a lead.  The\r\n\r\nviews of the Government are well known. We say  that\r\n\r\nour  first  duty  is  to throw light  on  the  whole\r\n\r\nsituation.  Everybody understands what this  is  all\r\n\r\nabout,  what  the game is for, who is playing  what\r\n\r\nrole.  It has been suggested, Sir, that some  of  us\r\n\r\nhave  slept  with  Machiavelli.  Well,  it  is   our\r\n\r\nbusiness  to  show who Machiavelli is,  what  he  is\r\n\r\ndoing, what his objectives are, who his other  dolls\r\n\r\non  the stage are. Having done that, I think we will\r\n\r\nhave  done  our  democratic duty  in  informing  the\r\n\r\npeople exactly what is going on; and they also  know\r\n\r\nthe role the Member for Anson is playing. Of course,\r\n\r\nfrom time to time, he gets confused. For instance, I\r\n\r\nam  not sure when he moved this amendment whether he\r\n\r\nrealised  that, in fact, he helped the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  in achieving his original intention.  The\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill has often said  -  publicly once\r\n\r\nin a radio forum with me, he egged me on - Our \"sacred\r\n\r\nduty  is to arrest and detain these people,\"  and  I\r\n\r\nexplained  to  him that I felt our sacred  duty  was\r\n\r\nfirst to explain to the people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  this was all about. These people knew,  and  I\r\n\r\nknew,  that the game was up for them and, as I  said\r\n\r\nyesterday, it is a fair cop. Therefore, I  say  that\r\n\r\nwhen the amendment to the amendment is taken and  if\r\n\r\nit is carried by the Opposition, it will be the duty\r\n\r\nof  the  Government  to bring this  to  the  highest\r\n\r\nconstitutional  authority for  security - namely, the\r\n\r\nInternal Security Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson has helped us in this,\r\n\r\nand  I would say that our business as the Government\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  is to ensure that everybody  gets  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  on  this  motion  to  state  where   he\r\n\r\nstand's.  Our  stand is to spotlight all  the  moves\r\n\r\nthat  are  being made. Everybody can understand  why\r\n\r\npeople  are against merger, why they are doing  what\r\n\r\nthey are doing, why if one condition were asked  for\r\n\r\nand  agreed to, another condition is raised, and  so\r\n\r\non, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Let  me\r\n\r\nquote him, in column 241, Hansard of 16th May, 1955.\r\n\r\nThis is what the Chief Minister, now the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the P.A.P., which consists of responsible,\r\n\r\ndecent, honest men - many of them - if they would  purge\r\n\r\nthemselves  of  the Communists and fellow-travellers\r\n\r\nthat  they know they have, if they would face  their\r\n\r\nown  responsibility, they could be the  organisation\r\n\r\nthat  they  hope lo be that would one day lead  this\r\n\r\ncountry to win its independence.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  was  solemn  advice given to  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  in  this very Chamber  barely  seven\r\n\r\nyears  ago.

We\r\n\r\ndid  not  do  that ourselves. They purged themselves\r\n\r\nout  in  May last year. They did it, and  all  arose\r\n\r\nfrom  a  difference  of views  on  the  question  of\r\n\r\nmerger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Member for Anson seeks to protect the\r\n\r\nleaders in the Barisan Sosialis. He seeks to protect\r\n\r\nthe  leaders in the Barisan Sosialis and yet  barely\r\n\r\nseven  years  ago - let me refresh his  memory - in  the\r\n\r\ndebate  on the P.P.S.O. Mr David Marshall, who  was  then\r\n\r\nChief  Minister, had this to say about Mr Lim Ching\r\n\r\nSiong who was then in the P.A.P. and the Member  for\r\n\r\nBukit  Timah.  Let  me  quote Hansard  of  the  21st\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1955, columns 696 and 697. This was  what\r\n\r\nthe Chief Minister, now Member for Anson, had to say\r\n\r\nvis-a-vis Mr Lim Ching Siong:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, a letter signed by the Member for Bukit Timah\r\n\r\n(Mr Lim Ching Siong) throws light on the conduct of\r\n\r\nthese  pseudo-trade  unionists  who  organised   the\r\n\r\nabortive    illegal   strikes - I   repeat,    illegal\r\n\r\nstrikes - of  last June.

Then,  when  the\r\n\r\ntime  is  considered ripe, they sacrifice him.  The\r\n\r\nMalays,  Sir, have a word for this type of  pseudo-trade unionists. They call them \"topengs\".'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he went on relating the case of one trade\r\n\r\nunionist  who  was  detained,  Mr  Yong  Kok   Kim,\r\n\r\nPresident of the Singapore Factory and Shop Workers'\r\n\r\nUnion. He was detained then by the Member for  Anson\r\n\r\nwho  was Chief Minister. And in column 697, this  is\r\n\r\nwhat the Member for Anson had to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This, Sir, is what the Member for Bukit Timah had\r\n\r\nto  say about the detention of Yong Kok Kim.

Therefore, we say, as between\r\n\r\nthe  amendment proposed by the Member for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nand the amendment to the amendment, quite frankly we\r\n\r\nawait directives from Members of the Opposition.

Since the amendment to the amendment has  been\r\n\r\ndefeated  it  is, in  fact,  significant  in   this\r\n\r\nrespect.  The words \"like the Barisan Sosialis\"  are\r\n\r\nagain part of the motion and the Barisan Sosialis is\r\n\r\nthereby,    by    implication,   an    organisation\r\n\r\nmanipulated   and  controlled  by  the   Communists.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you, Sir, would clarify?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Speaker\r\n\r\nshould  not be called upon to interpret what  is  in\r\n\r\nthe  amendment  and,  for  that  matter,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister will no doubt speak on it later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Penang and Malacca!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

So   the  purport  of  the   amendment,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  is  that  the Government,  in  order  to\r\n\r\ndischarge  its, duty,  has  got  to  restrain - a\r\n\r\neuphemism,  restrain - known Communist and Communist-front  leaders  from  manipulating  and  controlling\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been our view all along that this\r\n\r\nsimple   and  blunt  method  of  dealing  with   the\r\n\r\nCommunists does not provide a complete answer to our\r\n\r\nsecurity position. It is our intention to abstain on\r\n\r\nthe  whole amendment and let the Opposition  decide.\r\n\r\nAnd  on  the decision  of  the  Opposition  to  this\r\n\r\namendment,   certain  consequences  and  significant\r\n\r\nconclusions   will   be  drawn   by   the   relevant\r\n\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me explain the Government's policy and the\r\n\r\nGovernment's approach to this problem. Yesterday  we\r\n\r\nhad   the  advantage  of  hearing  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill admit in this Chamber that we do know  the\r\n\r\nCommunists   and   their  methods.   That   is   the\r\n\r\ncompliment he has paid us. And because we  do  know\r\n\r\nhow  they manipulate things and how to counter their\r\n\r\nmanipulations, we therefore abstained on  a  motion\r\n\r\nmoved  yesterday by the Member for Thomson. Now,  I\r\n\r\nwill  move  one step further, that not only  did  we\r\n\r\nknow, and we still know, how they operate, how  they\r\n\r\nmanipulate,  and therefore know how to counter  them\r\n\r\nand their manipulations, but in the long-term, what\r\n\r\nwe are doing is a necessary phase in the history of\r\n\r\nMalaya and of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is an aspect of the problem which I\r\n\r\nthink the people of Singapore and of Malaysia  must\r\n\r\nsee  clearly.  Our  view  is  that  the  problem  of\r\n\r\nCommunism and  the  Communists is  not  purely  the\r\n\r\nsecurity problem of restraining the - Communists  from\r\n\r\nactivity. Basically, this is an important aspect of\r\n\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrestraining  them from doing damage  to  society.  I\r\n\r\nwill  later  on explain how we have prevented  them,\r\n\r\nwithin  the  play of democratic methods, from  doing\r\n\r\nharm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, first, let me explain the whole problem. The\r\n\r\nappeal, the  pull  of Communism, is  basically  one\r\n\r\nwhich springs from poverty and frustration. Economic\r\n\r\nand  social distress provide a breeding ground  upon\r\n\r\nwhich the Communist creed can grow, can recruit  and\r\n\r\ngain strength. Without those conditions, it has been\r\n\r\nproved  over  and over again that however  militant,\r\n\r\nhowever  cunning,  however  active,  their  movement\r\n\r\ncannot gather strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, immediately after the Second World War, the\r\n\r\nCommunist  attack was on Europe, a  war-ravaged  and\r\n\r\ndestroyed  Europe. The industrial edifice of  Europe\r\n\r\nwas   nearly   completely  razed  to   the   ground,\r\n\r\nliterally.  Stalin's massive effort was  to  capture\r\n\r\nEurope, for once he captured Europe, he had captured\r\n\r\nthe  whole of the industrial potential of the  known\r\n\r\nindustrialised  world,  and  he  would  capture  the\r\n\r\nworld.  But what defeated the Communist was not  the\r\n\r\neffectiveness of the strength of the Italian police,\r\n\r\nor  the  French  police, or the West German  police - \r\n\r\nalthough  they were important factors  in  isolating\r\n\r\nand  containing known Communist operators. The basic\r\n\r\nfactor  that prevented a Communist capture of Europe\r\n\r\nwas  the  economic booster that they  got  from  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States  in  Marshall  Aid  that  rejuvenated\r\n\r\nEuropean  industries that have built now,  17  years\r\n\r\nafter the war, a prosperous common market in Europe,\r\n\r\none  so  prosperous that even Britain is reluctantly\r\n\r\ncompelled  to  consider joining.  True  the  Italian\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party still has a following, particularly\r\n\r\nin  the  industrial north. It is also true that  the\r\n\r\nFrench Communist Party is powerful. But what is true\r\n\r\nis  that  they  have  been halted,  checkmated,  not\r\n\r\nprimarily   by   being  contained,  restrained   and\r\n\r\ndetained,  but  by  the  economic  prosperity   that\r\n\r\ndispels  frustration, despair and  banishes  poverty\r\n\r\nand brings in prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained this thesis before. I will only\r\n\r\nbroadly touch on the problem. Sir, a population that\r\n\r\nis  advancing economically, that has something -  to\r\n\r\nlook  forward  to  tomorrow, something  better  than\r\n\r\ntoday,  and for their children even something better\r\n\r\nnext year, the year after that, the next decade - that\r\n\r\nis  not  a population which is likely to throw  away\r\n\r\nthe  past and grope madly for change and revolution.\r\n\r\nIt  is only, as in the case of China, when utter and\r\n\r\nabsolute despair has enveloped a whole people;  when\r\n\r\nthe  intelligentsia and the educated have lost faith\r\n\r\nin  this  system  and  the  people  have  reached  a\r\n\r\nbreaking  point, that they cast off the old  because\r\n\r\nnothing  could be worse than the old. That  was  the\r\n\r\npoint.  Communism  expanded and  overwhelmed  China.\r\n\r\nWhen  one  day you found that your hundred  thousand\r\n\r\nyen  would  buy half a katty of rice  and  two  days\r\n\r\nlater  you find that it would probably buy you three\r\n\r\ntahils  of  rice - in that situation men's minds  lose\r\n\r\ntheir  bearings and they go for a change.  In  North\r\n\r\nVietnam  a  situation approaching that  took  place,\r\n\r\nslightly different in that the colonial power by its\r\n\r\nstupidity in staying on brought about a united front\r\n\r\nnot  only  of  the Communists - even today  the  North\r\n\r\nVietnamese  Communist Party  is  not  known  as  the\r\n\r\nCommunist Party; the Vietcong Workers' Party brought\r\n\r\nabout  a  united front which gathered  together  the\r\n\r\nCommunists,  the non-Communists, the  liberals,  the\r\n\r\nintellectuals and everybody against the society. The\r\n\r\nnet  result,  of course, was that in such  a  united\r\n\r\nfront,  they being the best organised of the groups,\r\n\r\nwhen  victory  came, they were the  dominant  power.\r\n\r\nOver  the  years  all  the peripheral  organisations\r\n\r\nallied  to the united front will slowly wither  away\r\n\r\nand  the  quintessence of the Communist  elite  will\r\n\r\nslowly  take  over. If I were a Vietnamese  in  that\r\n\r\nsituation,  I would have joined them in  the  united\r\n\r\nfront,  as  I  would have gone on  with  the  united\r\n\r\nfront, my colleagues and I, with the Communists  and\r\n\r\nwith  everybody  else to fight the  British  to  end\r\n\r\ncolonial rule. But, fortunately for us, we  did  not\r\n\r\nhave  to  face  our  problems so hopelessly  as  the\r\n\r\nVietnamese have. By the time they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad finished with the colonial power, the whole  of\r\n\r\nthe  Vietminh Army, the whole of the officer  cadre\r\n\r\nwere Communists. There was no question of any other\r\n\r\nalternative and going on with the united front.  In\r\n\r\nthe  South, well, a different situation obtains and\r\n\r\nthe  light goes on, not a fight which I would  have\r\n\r\nliked  to  be involved in. But we are in a  happier\r\n\r\nposition,   that  even  before  independence,   the\r\n\r\nBritish made it quite clear that they were going to\r\n\r\nwithdraw   from  the  political  arena.   That   is\r\n\r\nimportant.  True, they have got economic  interests\r\n\r\nin  this country, large vested interests in  rubber\r\n\r\nor  tin and the distributive trade. But politically\r\n\r\nthey  made it quite clear, as far back as  1955  in\r\n\r\nthe   Federation,  that  they  were   prepared   to\r\n\r\nwithdraw.  So  the  objective of the  united  front\r\n\r\nbecame   possible   of  consummation   before   the\r\n\r\nCommunist  forces became strong enough to overwhelm\r\n\r\nall the other parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me take our problems of Singapore. The\r\n\r\nBritish offered no such escape. Their original plan\r\n\r\nin 1955 and 1956 was to hold Singapore indefinitely\r\n\r\nas  a  military base. I remember vividly the  first\r\n\r\nconference in 1956. I did not think the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  knew  who was playing what game.  He  had  a\r\n\r\ndelegation  of 13, but I am quite sure the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  would  not be as unlucky  as  the  former\r\n\r\nChief Minister's band of 13. He wanted independence\r\n\r\nto  allow Singapore to send representatives to  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations. That is one of the most  important\r\n\r\nthings, Sir. But without independence you cannot go\r\n\r\nto  the  United Nations. Sir, a worthwhile national\r\n\r\naspiration.  We  have  a delegation  there  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations to play on the world  stage.  After\r\n\r\nall,  Singapore  is  a small  place,  has  a  small\r\n\r\naudience,  but there, there is the world Press.  So\r\n\r\nhe   devised   a  scheme  whereby  we   would   get\r\n\r\nindependence  and  he  would hand  back  almost  in\r\n\r\nperpetuity by treaty, defence and external affairs.\r\n\r\nIt  was a mad scheme which I did not think had half\r\n\r\na chance of getting off the ground. However, he was\r\n\r\nencouraged by the Member for Bukit Timah  to  fight\r\n\r\nfor no less. We finally persuaded\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhim. They said, \"All right. Let foreign affairs and\r\n\r\ndefence  be  in British hands.\" The clash  came  on\r\n\r\nsecurity. The British wanted the predominant voice,\r\n\r\nthe  chairmanship and the casting vote. We proposed\r\n\r\nan  alternative with the concurrence  of  the  then\r\n\r\nMember  for  Bukit Timah, which is  important,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, for then I could not be outflanked by\r\n\r\nleftist adventurers in Singapore. He agreed that  a\r\n\r\nfair compromise was that the Federation should have\r\n\r\nthe  casting  vote,  because  we  all  believed  in\r\n\r\nmerger;  we  all  believed that that  was  the  way\r\n\r\ntowards  independence.  Believe  it  or  not,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, the Colonial Secretary refused. May  1956.\r\n\r\nThe  intention  was  that they were  to  stay  here\r\n\r\nindefinitely. No freedom was in sight.  And  if  no\r\n\r\nfreedom  was  in  sight, the united front  struggle\r\n\r\nmust  go  on. Sir, I put this argument to the  then\r\n\r\nColonial  Secretary. He was an extremely  able  man\r\n\r\nwho  not  only could run one conference at any  one\r\n\r\ntime  whilst he was doing the Singapore conference,\r\n\r\nlooking  after the ups and downs of the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson, who was then the Chief Minister; but he  was\r\n\r\nalso  looking after Malta and several other  places\r\n\r\nbesides, places which were all on the boil.  I  put\r\n\r\nto  him this simple argument, if you lose Malaya to\r\n\r\nCommunism, then you have lost Singapore.  There  is\r\n\r\nno  hope  of  holding Singapore. There is  as  much\r\n\r\nchance of holding Singapore from a Communist Malaya\r\n\r\nas  Hong  Kong from a Communist China. If  tomorrow\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  Communist Government decide  to  take\r\n\r\nHong Kong, nothing can stop it. He did not see  the\r\n\r\nlogic  of it or he did not want to admit the  logic\r\n\r\nof  it. I argued with him that as long as Malaya is\r\n\r\nnon-Communist, his base survives. And  what  better\r\n\r\nway  of deciding the security of Singapore than  to\r\n\r\nhave  the casting vote in the hands of a Government\r\n\r\nthat  has a direct and vital interest in Singapore,\r\n\r\nbecause  its  own  survival is intimately  tied  to\r\n\r\nSingapore?    But    the    Colonial     Secretary\r\n\r\nrefused - 1956.   The  events  that   followed   are\r\n\r\nfamiliar  to  you,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  Tumultuous\r\n\r\nscenes  in this House. Moments of great excitement.\r\n\r\nThen  the  anti-climax.  And  in  1957  we  reached\r\n\r\nagreement. In that one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear  some progress was made in thinking in  London,\r\n\r\nthat  if  Malaya became Communist, then the base  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  anyway  would be useless.  Therefore,  it\r\n\r\nwas  agreed that the casting vote would be with  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya. That was crucial. If one  side\r\n\r\ndisagreed, then a new phase opened. In other  words,\r\n\r\nan  admission was made that the two territories were\r\n\r\nintimately  linked. If one was lost, the  other  was\r\n\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from that moment the gradual\r\n\r\ndrift  away from the united front tactics began.  In\r\n\r\nJune,  we  reached agreement in London  that  Malaya\r\n\r\nshould have a casting vote. In August Malaya itself \r\n\r\nbecame  independent. You will recall that I reported\r\n\r\nin  this Assembly a conversation I had with the boys\r\n\r\nthen  in  camp - the people intimately connected  with\r\n\r\nthe  leadership  of the P.A.P. to  whom  we  owed  a\r\n\r\nresponsibility. They said that that brought about  a\r\n\r\nmetamorphosis  of  the  whole situation.  From  then\r\n\r\nonwards the Malay soldiers, the Chinese Home  Guard,\r\n\r\nthe  Indian policemen - they are no longer mercenaries\r\n\r\nof  the  colonial  power,  but  they  are  sentinels\r\n\r\nguarding  the  independence  of  the  newly-acquired\r\n\r\nMalayan independence. A basic and fundamental change\r\n\r\nof  role. And the continuance of the M.C.P. struggle\r\n\r\nthereafter  became  an attack not  on  the  colonial\r\n\r\npower  but on a newly independent Government  freely\r\n\r\nelected  by  the people. That began the  new  phase.\r\n\r\nFrom then onwards we set down our new stakes - what we\r\n\r\nwere fighting for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown has talked about\r\n\r\nour  mandate - that we had no mandate - to bring  merger\r\n\r\nabout.  Let me read to him his pledge signed, sealed\r\n\r\nand  delivered with Tann Wee Long, the legal adviser\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan Sosialis, attesting. He said  here,\r\n\r\nsigned, sealed and delivered on the 11th day of  May\r\n\r\n1959:  \"I, Lee Siew Choh, of No. 358G Dunearn  Road,\r\n\r\nSingapore, 11, hereby acknowledge that I  have  read\r\n\r\nand   understood  the  4th  Anniversary  Celebration\r\n\r\nSouvenir issue of the Petir, the organ of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\npublished on the 22nd November, 1958, and the  Five-Year Plan of the P.A.P. announced  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  a Special Party Congress of Saturday,  25th\r\n\r\nApril,  1959,  and  I declare  that  I  am  in  full\r\n\r\nagreement  with  the  P.A.P.'s  policy  as  set  out\r\n\r\ntherein.

Mr Speaker; now it is 1.7 million,\r\n\r\nas  the Member for Queenstown says living mainly  on\r\n\r\nits  trade with the Federation and Indonesia, cannot\r\n\r\nhope  for  anything more than the status of Hongkong\r\n\r\nor Taiwan.

They wanted  to\r\n\r\ncarry  on  a united front with us, it was  a  united\r\n\r\nfront   for  nationalist,  non-Communist,  socialist\r\n\r\npurposes.  Not for Communist purposes.

Had this Government\r\n\r\ncarried out the policy of the last Government,  then\r\n\r\nwe  would have got into an impasse. Sir, this  is  a\r\n\r\nsimple  exercise in logic. The British  wanted  this\r\n\r\nbase  to  go on as long as possible in the same  old\r\n\r\nway,  with them as sovereign. The Federation  wanted\r\n\r\nSingapore   to   be   reasonably  quiet,   peaceful,\r\n\r\nprosperous  and  no  problem to  them.  A  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  elected can either fight for  the  long-term rights of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  people  or  play  the short-term  game  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish in keeping this situation contained. Sir, to\r\n\r\nkeep  the place happy and prosperous, you must  have\r\n\r\neconomic  expansion; you must have first an economic\r\n\r\nbase - a common market. Without that, nobody is  going\r\n\r\nto  put his money in Singapore. We have tried it. We\r\n\r\nhave fought hard for a common market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of order, Sir, Surely, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, this is irrelevant to the  debate  at\r\n\r\nthe moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was just wondering how it is\r\n\r\nrelated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is very simple, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir.

I do not object to them, if it gives them some\r\n\r\nrelease    from   their   inhibitions   and    their\r\n\r\nfrustrations. I say, so be it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain this exercise. If there is no\r\n\r\ncommon  market, then it means no economic expansion.\r\n\r\nThen   that   means   more   social   unrest,   more\r\n\r\nunemployment,  more problems. We have  gone  through\r\n\r\nthis  drill;  so let us face the problem  now.  They\r\n\r\nhelped  us in 1961. They helped us enormously.  They\r\n\r\nbrought  home  the problem vividly to Kuala  Lumpur.\r\n\r\nEveryday in the fierce things they say, they help to\r\n\r\nbring  the  problems home. Suddenly it was generally\r\n\r\nrecognised that there must be merger; there must  be\r\n\r\na  common  market,  or  the position  could  not  be\r\n\r\ncontained.  Now had we played the other  game,  then\r\n\r\nthe  position  would  have been contained  for  five\r\n\r\nyears,  for the life of this Assembly. There  is  no\r\n\r\nproblem.  They are cornered. They are kept down.  We\r\n\r\nare  the  stooges of the British for having cornered\r\n\r\nthem,  because  obviously with no  independence  the\r\n\r\ninterests that are served and protected are  British\r\n\r\ninterests, because they are the sovereign power. But\r\n\r\nwith  independence, that is a different proposition.\r\n\r\nThe  interests  that  are  served  are  Malayan  and\r\n\r\nMalaysian  interests. When they go down, it  is  not\r\n\r\nbecause  they are fighting against the British,  but\r\n\r\nbecause  they  are  trying to  down  an  independent\r\n\r\npopularly-elected government, and they will  deserve\r\n\r\nwhat they get. That is a different proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see, Mr Speaker, Sir, very far from not\r\n\r\ndischarging our sacred duty, I submit that  we  have\r\n\r\ndischarged our sacred duty in the best possible  way\r\n\r\nin these given circumstances. There would be no talk\r\n\r\nof  merger, no Malaysia, had we continued the policy\r\n\r\nof the last Government. The last Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunfortunately  did not understand what  it  was  all\r\n\r\nabout.  I  do  not  blame them because  they  opened\r\n\r\nPandora's  Box. It all started with the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson.   He   opened  it.  He  asked  for  Assistant\r\n\r\nMinisters.   He  kept  on  opening  Pandora's   Box.\r\n\r\nSuddenly out popped a weasel and all the Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  could do was to put the weasel  back  and\r\n\r\nclose  Pandora's Box. I do not think, in  the  long\r\n\r\nterm,  that  that is the right approach, because  it\r\n\r\nhas  to  be  resolved not on a sectionalised  basis - Singapore alone -  because Singapore is not viable.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,   these   are   facts - facts!    They\r\n\r\nmiscalculated  and they helped us  inadvertently  to\r\n\r\nbring  about merger and Malaysia, at a  pace  and  a\r\n\r\nspeed  which  we  never  imagined  possible  at  the\r\n\r\nbeginning  of 1961.

The\r\n\r\nproblem  of  Singapore is a very special  one  of  a\r\n\r\nsmall contained island dependent for its economic  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsurvival on the Federation of Malaya.

Either\r\n\r\nwe  are part of the whole and the whole survives, or\r\n\r\nwe  are  not  interested in keeping  this  appendage\r\n\r\ngoing,  kept down and contained for the  benefit  of\r\n\r\neither   the  British  or,  for  that  matter,   the\r\n\r\nFederation    Government.    If    the    Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment's attitude had been that Singapore  meant\r\n\r\nnothing to them and could go down the drain, then  I\r\n\r\nsay, so it would have happened. Logic, aided by  the\r\n\r\nvivid  examples  of  their  own  postures  and  wild\r\n\r\nstatements, has brought about this sudden  change - a\r\n\r\nrealisation of the vital interdependence of the  two\r\n\r\nterritories  and  the vital interdependence  of  the\r\n\r\nfive territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the same time, let me explain, and they\r\n\r\nknow  full well how we kept the situation contained.\r\n\r\nNone  of  those whom we suspected of being insincere\r\n\r\nwhen  they signed these documents were given  access\r\n\r\nto  secret or confidential files.

They had the choice then to vote  against\r\n\r\nthe  Government and show their displeasure, but  the\r\n\r\npeople  supported the Government. We must carry  on.\r\n\r\nIt  is  our sacred duty. They wanted us to carry  on\r\n\r\nand  hoped to capture us from the rear. But we  were\r\n\r\nfully  aware  of  the  problems connected  with  the\r\n\r\nunited front.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim is an experienced hand. He\r\n\r\nwas  booted out in 1957 by the machinations of these\r\n\r\nboys.  And  he  talks about fighting on  the  ground\r\n\r\ntogether. They were fighting against us whenever  it\r\n\r\nsuited  them. He knew it. That is why he has got  it\r\n\r\nin   his  Constitution - cadre  membership - and   the\r\n\r\nCentral  Committee  is elected only  once  in  three\r\n\r\nyears,  not  like the P.A.P. Ours  is  once  in  two\r\n\r\nyears. We meet regularly bi-annually. His is once in\r\n\r\nthree  years.  And the Rules of the Party  are  such\r\n\r\nthat  nobody  can  capture it without  his  consent.\r\n\r\n[Laughter]   It  shows  him  to  be   an   extremely\r\n\r\nexperienced man. They fixed him in 1957; we got  him\r\n\r\nunfixed. That was our misfortune, we trusted him. So\r\n\r\nwe bear the cross. But they are not going to fix him\r\n\r\nagain.  He does not want them running around  fixing\r\n\r\nhim. We know that; he knows that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill has no great\r\n\r\naffection   for  me.  We  fought  many   a   battle;\r\n\r\ntemperamentally  and  ideologically,  we  are  poles\r\n\r\napart.  But can he afford to face his own supporters\r\n\r\nand  say  he  let  the  country  down  and  not  the\r\n\r\nGovernment down? It is no longer a question  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government. Everybody knows  that  it  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of  either merger and survival  or  chaos,\r\n\r\ntrials  and tribulations before ultimate merger.  Do\r\n\r\nwe  avoid the trials and the tribulations?  That  is\r\n\r\nthe issue. And every vote against the Government  is\r\n\r\na vote for the trials and tribulations. That is what\r\n\r\nit amounts to. I say that there is no need for us to\r\n\r\ntry  and  go  round  and lobby  in  order  to  foist\r\n\r\nourselves  with responsibilities. The responsibility\r\n\r\nis there. If any Member on the other side gets 26 to\r\n\r\nvote us out, constitutionally we are discharged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me explain the other ways in which we\r\n\r\nfeel we have discharged our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsacred  duty. I say this hesitantly, in case  it  is\r\n\r\nbelieved that we are immodest. But very few  men  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and few women at that, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwould  have  taken it upon themselves to  dig  their\r\n\r\ntoes  in the face of everything that the Communists\r\n\r\ncould  throw at us. The easier way was to play their\r\n\r\ngame  and cover up, push along, improvise and  carry\r\n\r\non  the idea of peace for our time, but disaster for\r\n\r\nthe  country,  while they built  up  more  and  more\r\n\r\nramifications  to  undermine  the  State.  We  never\r\n\r\nallowed  that, Mr Speaker, Sir. Now, for the  first\r\n\r\ntime, the issue is solemnly and clearly posed to the\r\n\r\npeople. This is no humbug. \"Bogey,\" says the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown.  Is Chin Peng a  bogey;  is  he  a\r\n\r\nghost?  I  do not know if the Member for  Queenstown\r\n\r\nlooks  up the meaning of these words. I do not think\r\n\r\nChin Peng is a bogey. He is real.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Not something you can see, is\r\n\r\nit?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We do not let these chaps make\r\n\r\nus  lose  sleep,  Sir, I can assure the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  that  I  sleep well at  nights.  I  take\r\n\r\nregular exercise and I am fighting fit. For it is my\r\n\r\njob  to  discharge these responsibilities and nobody\r\n\r\nis  going to get us away from it. And Chin  Peng  or\r\n\r\nChing  Siong, Sir - I read in the papers today  and  I\r\n\r\nthought  it read rather well. Is he a bogey?  He  is\r\n\r\nreal. We know him for so many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> He is a nice chap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He is a nice chap.

Does it mean therefore that  we\r\n\r\nyield,  we surrender, just because some of them  are\r\n\r\nnice chaps? But some of them are ruthless chaps, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, let us make no mistake about  that.  I\r\n\r\nsay  that  the sacred duty was discharged by  baring\r\n\r\nthe  facts to the people and carrying the fight into\r\n\r\nthe open. We could have concealed the fight, covered\r\n\r\nup  the  tracks, carried on for five years, and  for\r\n\r\nfive years more. Sir, we are better able to give the\r\n\r\nCommunists a respectable cover. One of the  greatest\r\n\r\nmisfortunes of the Member for Queenstown is that  he\r\n\r\nhas a sense of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhumour  and  every time he goes into  his  long  and\r\n\r\nlengthy  tirades, at the end of it  all,  the  utter\r\n\r\nsilliness  and stupidity and comicality  of  it  all\r\n\r\nstrikes  him,  and  he  bursts  into  uncontrollable\r\n\r\nlaughter. He has got an engaging characteristic.  He\r\n\r\nplays  his  role, difficult though  it  may  be.  He\r\n\r\nrants, he gets angry; he puts on the act. All  these\r\n\r\nlengthy pages - he does not speak in those words  and\r\n\r\nphrases. Those are words and phrases that the Member\r\n\r\nfor   Thomson  read  out  yesterday - the   words   of\r\n\r\nrevolution,  anger  of  the people,  turn  to  other\r\n\r\nalternatives, traitors. But at the end  of  it  all,\r\n\r\nthe   silliness  of  it  strikes  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown, and he is in a fit of merriment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You act very well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We have done our duty by\r\n\r\nbaring  this. The fight now moves into a new  phase.\r\n\r\nThat  is  our sacred duty - to carry it into  the  new\r\n\r\nphase  without allowing the harmony that now  exists\r\n\r\nbetween the people to be  cracked. Because once  that\r\n\r\nis  cracked,  it  will never be put together  again.\r\n\r\nThey know it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well. Mr Speaker, Sir, I say therefore that the\r\n\r\nfirst  sacred duty to the people was to  ensure  the\r\n\r\npermanent  security  and  prosperity  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  only  possible  in  a  merger  with   the\r\n\r\nFederation.  Any  other way meant  isolation,  meant\r\n\r\nplaying  to  the  Communists. It is  they  who  want\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  remain a colony. Full internal  self-government,  abolish the Security Council - they  will\r\n\r\nbe  quite  happy. Because then the common  enemy  is\r\n\r\nthere - British  colonialism - and all those  who  fight\r\n\r\nlike  them  are anti-colonialists; whether  you  are\r\n\r\nfighting  for  a Communist cause or a  non-Communist\r\n\r\ncause,  you  are together, you must be, because  the\r\n\r\ncommon   enemy   is  colonialism.   So   they   want\r\n\r\ncolonialism  for  their  purpose.  Their  logic   is\r\n\r\nsimple, because without the British, the Member  for\r\n\r\nHavelock  becomes  an  aider  and  abettor  of   the\r\n\r\nCommunist movement. With the British, the Member for\r\n\r\nHavelock  is  an  active  fighter  of  anti-colonial\r\n\r\nrevolution. But how can he be an active  fighter  of\r\n\r\nanti-colonial  revolution if  the  colonialists  are\r\n\r\ngone? That is the simple logic. It is not only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis  bosses who can think these things out;  so  can\r\n\r\nothers.  That is why they have a vested interest  in\r\n\r\ncolonialism. There is a word to be made  use  of  in\r\n\r\norder  that they can expand on a broad front, absorb\r\n\r\nall  classes, and using the words of the Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson's    resolution   yesterday,    Sir - workers,\r\n\r\nstudents,  rural dwellers. If you use a simple  word\r\n\r\nlike  \"peasants\", it is too reminiscent of the great\r\n\r\nlines of workers and peasants of China; so that is a\r\n\r\nbit  tricky.  So  do not use such words;  change  to\r\n\r\n\"rural   dwellers\".  They  only  forgot  the  grave-diggers,  Sir. They represent all classes, including\r\n\r\nthe grave-diggers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, what therefore is the significance of\r\n\r\nthis  amendment? The significance is this,  that  in\r\n\r\nthe opinion of the Member for Cairnhill, that is the\r\n\r\nonly  way  to deal with the Communists. We disagree.\r\n\r\nBut  we  say quite clearly that that is one  of  the\r\n\r\nways in which the Communists have been dealt with. I\r\n\r\nhave  said  all this before. The Member for  Thomson\r\n\r\nalways  quotes little bits that suit him;  he  never\r\n\r\nquotes  the bits that do not suit him, made  on  the\r\n\r\nsame   occasion.   That   all   these   methods   of\r\n\r\n\"containment\"  are of no value, unless  the  general\r\n\r\nsituation is kept out of it. It is like a  sick  man\r\n\r\nin  a  community. It is no use having  a  quarantine\r\n\r\nstation  for  people  with tuberculosis  unless  the\r\n\r\ngeneral health of your population is good. Then  you\r\n\r\nquarantine those that carry the virus and  you  keep\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  healthy,  healthy.  But  when  your\r\n\r\ngeneral  standard  of  health  is  down  because  of\r\n\r\npoverty,  malnutrition and bad housing,  you  cannot\r\n\r\nquarantine  the whole nation. That is the  point  we\r\n\r\nmake.  Let  me say this: a quarantine is a  valuable\r\n\r\nmethod  of  containing the virus and  from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime,  regrettable though it may  be,  it  would  be\r\n\r\nnecessary-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> To get a vaccine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> True, I am reminded by my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the  Deputy Prime Minister that  in  the\r\n\r\nquarantine,  we  produce  an  anti-toxin  which   is\r\n\r\nanother necessary aspect of this whole process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, our first duty is to keep the population\r\n\r\nhealthy.   That  we  will  secure  through  economic\r\n\r\nexpansion and prosperity; otherwise I say  it  is  a\r\n\r\nwaste  of time trying to do this. You will  have  to\r\n\r\nquarantine  finally  the whole  of  Singapore.  With\r\n\r\ngrowing   unemployment,   no   economic   expansion,\r\n\r\nfrustration,   and  bitterness,   the   basis   will\r\n\r\ndisappear  and  the  whole  thing  will  go   in   a\r\n\r\nturbulent, and riotous and chaotic mess. But when we\r\n\r\nhave  ensured  that  standards  will  be  kept   up,\r\n\r\nprogress will be made, nutrition is forthcoming, and\r\n\r\nbetter and better houses, better and better schools,\r\n\r\nmore  and  more factories, more and more  jobs  with\r\n\r\nbetter  and better wages, then we isolate those  who\r\n\r\nare unhealthy. Of course, we will try and bring them\r\n\r\nback to health, Mr Speaker, Sir, We will feed them,\r\n\r\nlook after them-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> And inject them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. We will try our best, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir. All the known vaccines will be  tried;\r\n\r\nall  the  latest in antibiotics. Sir, when  we  took\r\n\r\noffice - although these men fought against us  to  fix\r\n\r\nus  and they fixed the Member for Hong Lim they were\r\n\r\nin   Changi  Prison,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,   and   we\r\n\r\ntransferred  them  to St. John's Island  where  they\r\n\r\ncould get the sea breeze and open air-sports, basket\r\n\r\nball,  night reading, and even swimming! And I say - I\r\n\r\ndo  not  claim  credit for that,  but  that  is  our\r\n\r\nhumanity;  we  tried to do something for  them.  And\r\n\r\nmany  of them have been rehabilitated, recovered  in\r\n\r\nhealth,  reacquired their balance, their ideological\r\n\r\nserenity restored, and they have been released.  And\r\n\r\nso  the  process  goes  on. But  it  must  be  in  a\r\n\r\ncontained  situation.

If a man has something to\r\n\r\nlive  for - if today he has a bicycle and  is  earning\r\n\r\nenough,  feeding  his  family  in  nice  and  decent\r\n\r\nsurroundings, and with enough to buy  a  scooter  on\r\n\r\nthe  hire purchase - from the bicycle he goes to the\r\n\r\nscooter - that is tangible progress. And he would  not\r\n\r\nlisten to all this wild and silly talk of revolution\r\n\r\nand  violence. And if from the scooter he  is  doing\r\n\r\nwell  enough to go to one of the Mini-minor  cars -   \r\n\r\nthere is the 500, the 600, the Mini-Cooper which  is\r\n\r\nrevved  up and can do 100 m.p.h. - he can take a  girl\r\n\r\nfriend  out  for  a  spin, that  is  reasonable  and\r\n\r\ntolerable.

But if the Member  for\r\n\r\nNee Soon has not got white-wall tyres, if last year,\r\n\r\nhis Renault fell to bits and he had to go back to  a\r\n\r\nscooter and then this year from the scooter he  goes\r\n\r\ndown  to  the bicycle, we will now find a  different\r\n\r\nMember for Nee Soon. Right at the moment he is a man\r\n\r\nat  peace with himself, but, mind you, a bit fearful\r\n\r\nof the hazards of the outer world. But nevertheless,\r\n\r\nas  I  told  him publicly, he is not a  man  who  is\r\n\r\neither  by  inclination or by  circumstances  to  be\r\n\r\nforced  into violent action. And he assured me  that\r\n\r\nthere  will be no violent action whatsoever,  and  I\r\n\r\naccept  his  assurance. I have no doubts whatsoever,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, that if you can go from a Renault\r\n\r\nto an Opel Rekord - and with easy small numbers - then\r\n\r\nI  say  there is hope. I do not speak in disparaging\r\n\r\nterms.    I   say   that   is   the   business    of\r\n\r\nsociety - incentives. People live in  this  world  for\r\n\r\nfulfilment  of  themselves, be it a game  of  chance\r\n\r\nwhether  at  the  table or in the  larger  field  of\r\n\r\npolitics,  be  it  an  expression  of  their   alter\r\n\r\nego - whatever  it is - there must be  some  consummation\r\n\r\nin  life.  I  am  told, Sir, there is  nothing  more\r\n\r\nfrustrating than to be a spinster all one's life.  I\r\n\r\nam quite sure that is what happens when a population\r\n\r\ngoes  down;  when bicycles stay as bicycles.  Worse,\r\n\r\nyou  go  on foot and shoes get worse and you  go  to\r\n\r\nsandals. If that happens, then frustration sets  in.\r\n\r\nBut  where  there is no frustration, when  there  is\r\n\r\nfreedom and liberty of movement, speech, expression,\r\n\r\npersonal  enjoyment of one's likes and dislikes,  so\r\n\r\nlong  as it does not affect the community at  large,\r\n\r\nthen  there  is  no violent upheaval.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nmanning  of  the  barricades. They  tried  it,  Sir,\r\n\r\nseveral  times  in  the last one  year.  First,  the\r\n\r\nunions  and  then  the  People's  Association.   All\r\n\r\nflopped. We left them alone. They were doing  things\r\n\r\nsometimes  which were unlawful; for  instance,  like\r\n\r\nputting up tents. We did not mind. Is it our  sacred\r\n\r\nduty  to lock these chaps up? They were just stooges\r\n\r\nin  the game. I say no. It is not the purpose of it.\r\n\r\nFocus  it  on the main actors, These are  the  minor\r\n\r\nparts being\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplayed  by the minor people. They are the supporting\r\n\r\ncast.  Leave  them alone. The Work Brigade  flopped.\r\n\r\nWhy?  If  there  was  what they  called  in  Marxist\r\n\r\nterminology   the  pre-conditions   of   revolution,\r\n\r\nconditions of despair where the Government is unable\r\n\r\nto  resolve them, people have no confidence that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can resolve it, or worse, the Government\r\n\r\nknows it cannot resolve it, then you have the people\r\n\r\nready  to man barricades. And they have not got  it.\r\n\r\nThey  tried it with the Chinese Secondary IV boycott\r\n\r\nexaminations. A happy population, reasonably content -\r\n\r\nI   am   not   saying  that   they   are   ideal\r\n\r\nconditions - but   sufficiently  good   to   hold   an\r\n\r\nexpectation  of  better  for tomorrow.  The  parents\r\n\r\nswept aside the petty little dictators who tried  to\r\n\r\nprevent  their  fellow  students  from  taking   the\r\n\r\nexaminations.  But  they  went  in   to   take   the\r\n\r\nexaminations, without police intervention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They called for another strike of students\r\n\r\nrecently to stop the Commission of Inquiry. Is  that\r\n\r\na  bogey? What is happening causes a great  deal  of\r\n\r\nembarrassment.   Everyday   they   see   this   with\r\n\r\ndiscomfort. Every Barisan issue has long  scurrilous\r\n\r\ntirades  on  the  Commission of Inquiry  which  they\r\n\r\nsupported  in  this House. How does the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  explain  all  this?  He  supported   the\r\n\r\nCommission  of  Inquiry.  Now  he  is  throwing  the\r\n\r\nspotlight  on what is going on. It is like switching\r\n\r\non.  I  do  not know, Mr Speaker, Sir, whether  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown has ever tried this. You  put\r\n\r\nyour foot into a machine - I am sure he has put it on\r\n\r\nthe chest. I have tried it with my shoes. You go  to\r\n\r\na  shoe shop. You put your foot on it. You switch on\r\n\r\nthe  button and you can see the bones of your  foot.\r\n\r\nThat is what has happened. They want a Commission of\r\n\r\nInquiry.  The X-ray is put on by popular request.  I\r\n\r\nsay here, too, by popular request we leave it to the\r\n\r\nOpposition. If they say this is what is right,  then\r\n\r\nwe  will convey this to the proper authorities. This\r\n\r\nis  a  directive to the final authority for security\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. We shall convey it.

He  has  lost,   I   think,\r\n\r\naccording  to  my  reckoning, two  minutes  speaking\r\n\r\nirrelevantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No, Sir, I do not intend to be\r\n\r\nirrelevant  except to say that what we said  of  the\r\n\r\npossibility of the Prime Minister being  the  United\r\n\r\nNations  representative for the Federation  is  not\r\n\r\ncompletely untrue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment by the Member for Cairnhill to\r\n\r\nmy  mind is very dishonest. I think this is  one  of\r\n\r\nhis  usual double talk somersaults. It is very clear\r\n\r\nthat  the S.P.A. want to support the P.A.P. but dare\r\n\r\nnot  do  so openly. I can quote the instance of  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. objecting very strongly to clause 29 of  the\r\n\r\nReferendum   Bill   in  Select  Committee   but   on\r\n\r\nrecommittal abstaining instead of really supporting,\r\n\r\nand so indirectly supporting the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can say this to the Member for Cairnhill: that\r\n\r\nwhen  we moved this motion of no confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  there  was no intention  whatsoever  to\r\n\r\ndiscredit the S.P.A. as he had thought. You can read\r\n\r\nthe  words of the motion and it says, \"no confidence\r\n\r\nin  the  P.A.P. Government\". Therefore, if the  SPA.\r\n\r\nagree  with us, namely, that they have no confidence\r\n\r\nin  the  P.A.P. Government, whatever the reason  may\r\n\r\nbe,  they  still can join us in voting  against  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. But the reason given by the S.P.A. cannot  be\r\n\r\nacceptable  to us because the amendment  only  falls\r\n\r\ninto the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrap  of the P.A.P. and allow them an excuse to  use\r\n\r\ndictatorial methods against any organisation that is P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Sir, at the present moment, there are\r\n\r\na  lot  of  people in Singapore who are against  the\r\n\r\ndishonest referendum and against the sell-out of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., and therefore they combine together to  take\r\n\r\nconcerted  action against the P.A.P. And  since  these\r\n\r\norganisations  put  up effective opposition  to  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., the obvious line left for the Government  is\r\n\r\nto  smear these organisations as so called Communist\r\n\r\nand   Communist   front   organisations.   I   hope,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  that  the S.P.A.,  if  they  are  really\r\n\r\nsincere and honest and if they really think that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are no good and should not have the confidence\r\n\r\nof  the  people, will support our amendment instead.\r\n\r\nBut  it  is  curious that although the S.P.A. agree\r\n\r\nwith  us that they have no confidence in the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment,  yet  they turned round  to  attack  the\r\n\r\nmover of the original motion instead. This is one of\r\n\r\nthose somersaults typical of the Member of Cairnhill\r\n\r\nand,   I, suppose,  this  is  the  result  of   his\r\n\r\nexperience  as a politician for the past  12  years.\r\n\r\nThis  is  no surprise to us, Sir. Of course,  as  we\r\n\r\nhave seen all along, the S.P.A. tactics have been to\r\n\r\nembarrass the P.A.P. and at the same time,  to  join\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. in smearing the Barisan Sosialis.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know what the Member for Cairnhill hopes to get\r\n\r\nout of this.

Sir, I think we should  first\r\n\r\nattempt  a definition of some of the terms  used  in\r\n\r\nthe  amendment. First, the words \"sacred duty\", that\r\n\r\nis,  the sacred duty of the Government is to protect\r\n\r\nthe  internal security of Singapore. I do not  think\r\n\r\nthis  duty is sacred. I think it is the normal  duty\r\n\r\nof  any  government to see that  law  and  order  is\r\n\r\nmaintained.  There  is  nothing  sacrosanct  in  any\r\n\r\ngovernment  performing that sort of  function.  Then\r\n\r\nthe method of maintaining or protecting the internal\r\n\r\nsecurity  of Singapore, according to the Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill, is to restrain the known Communists. What\r\n\r\ndoes  the  word \"restraint\" mean? Members will  know\r\n\r\nthat every time the Member for Cairnhill speaks  on\r\n\r\nthe  subject  of  dealing with  the  Communists,  he\r\n\r\nrecommends  only  one method, and he  puts  it  into\r\n\r\nseveral ways - put them in a place where they  can  do\r\n\r\nno  harm. Now he used the word \"restrain\", when  all\r\n\r\nhe meant is to arrest them, put them in Changi Gaol,\r\n\r\nput them out of circulation. That is the meaning  of\r\n\r\nthe amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Cairnhill says\r\n\r\n\"Correct\". Sir, it is a very strange thing that  one\r\n\r\nsection  of the Opposition should ask us to lock  up\r\n\r\nthe  Members of the Opposition, while the  Opposition\r\n\r\nthat is supposed to be  the target of security action\r\n\r\nconstantly calls us Fascists. One or the other  must\r\n\r\nbe  wrong. There is a contradiction here. If we  are\r\n\r\nFascists,  then  it  is quite  unnecessary  for  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Cairnhill to urge us on this  course  of\r\n\r\naction.  We would have done it long ago. Of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  Fascists not only restrain the people, they not\r\n\r\nonly  lock them up in prison, but suddenly you  find\r\n\r\nprisoners  completely disappearing and no  trace  of\r\n\r\nthem is found. So, Sir, it is obvious that when  the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Members,  particularly  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown, accuse us of Fascism, they do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhat  Fascism  means and they do not know  what  the\r\n\r\nFascists would do to people like him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why cannot the Government agree with this\r\n\r\namendment?  The  Member  for  Cairnhill  is   always\r\n\r\ninstigating us to lock up the Communists  and  their\r\n\r\nfellow  travellers. We can understand  this  easily,\r\n\r\nbecause that was the way he dealt with them  in  the\r\n\r\npast.  This is the method which he thinks will solve\r\n\r\nthe  problem. I could perhaps mention that it is not\r\n\r\nonly the S.P.A. Members who think that we should  do\r\n\r\nit.  I recollect the rather hilarious occasion  when\r\n\r\none  of  the Barisan Sosialis leaders, Mr Woodhull,\r\n\r\nand I were having a conversation in the C.P.A. Room.\r\n\r\nWe talked about how democratic the P.A.P. is, how we\r\n\r\nbelieved  in allowing the Barisan Sosialis  all  the\r\n\r\nopportunities to propagate their views, and he said,\r\n\r\n\"Come  off it! Come off it! You surely do  not  mean\r\n\r\nthat'?\"  Well, the long and short of it is  that  it\r\n\r\nended in an uproar, and he said, \"Why don't you lock\r\n\r\nus  up?  You have got no guts. Tun Lim Yew  Hock  at\r\n\r\nleast  had  the  courage of his convictions  and  he\r\n\r\nproceeded  to  massacre  the  Communists  and  their\r\n\r\nsympathisers when he thought he had to  do  it.\"  He\r\n\r\nthought  we should do the same thing, and  the  only\r\n\r\nreason why we did not act in this manner is that  we\r\n\r\nlacked the courage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is a point of view which I think we must\r\n\r\ndispute.   People   can   point   to   the   various\r\n\r\nshortcomings of the P.A.P. Some may be right, others\r\n\r\nare not, but I do not think that lack of courage can\r\n\r\nbe one of our shortcomings. If we desist from taking\r\n\r\nsecurity  action against the Communists, the  reason\r\n\r\nis not that we lack the courage to do it. The reason\r\n\r\nis  that  in  the present situation  there  are  far\r\n\r\nbetter and more effective ways of dealing with them.\r\n\r\nSir,  as  you  know, there is a saying  which  goes,\r\n\r\nthere  are  more  ways of killing a  cat  than  just\r\n\r\ndrowning  it  in cream. In the present situation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, our stand is that so far as the Communist\r\n\r\nthreat is concerned, we have never attempted on  any\r\n\r\noccasion  to minimise it. So far as this  threat  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  direct  security  action  against  them,\r\n\r\nblocking  them up, putting them away in Changi  Gaol\r\n\r\nis not the correct\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nway,  for various reasons. The most obvious is  that\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  Government  is  not  the   ultimate\r\n\r\nauthority  on this matter. The ultimate power  rests\r\n\r\nwith  the  internal Security Council  in  which  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  has minority  representation.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if we were to assume powers which  we  do\r\n\r\nnot really have, the Government could easily, and  I\r\n\r\nbelieve quite rightly, be charged with taking action\r\n\r\non  behalf  of some other interests, not necessarily\r\n\r\nthe interests of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a more fundamental and more basic\r\n\r\nreason why the game cannot be  played in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Do not filibuster.

This  really\r\n\r\nstems  from  the  nature  of  the  Communist  threat\r\n\r\nitself - the  very nature of the movement, the  system\r\n\r\nof  the  organisation, and the way they  attempt  to\r\n\r\nmanipulate persons and organisations in our  society\r\n\r\nto advance their own long-term political interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I explain what I mean by the nature of the\r\n\r\nCommunist threat in our present society so  that  it\r\n\r\nwill be quite clear that once the real nature of the\r\n\r\nthreat is recognised and is known, then the unwisdom\r\n\r\nof  taking the course of action recommended in  this\r\n\r\namendment  would  be  apparent to  all?  On  several\r\n\r\noccasions,  when  we  on the  Government  side  drew\r\n\r\nattention   to   Communist   activities,   Communist\r\n\r\nagitation   among   students,  the   trade   unions,\r\n\r\npenetration  of political Parties like  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis and so forth, the reply always thrown  back\r\n\r\nat us was, how many known Communists? The last known\r\n\r\nestimate was 300. And they said, \"How can 300 men be\r\n\r\nso  dangerous to society?\" Some of the  persons  who\r\n\r\nmake   the  statement  honestly  believe  that   300\r\n\r\nCommunists pose no threat to 1,700,000 people.  They\r\n\r\nsay  all  this repetition, emphasis on the Communist\r\n\r\nthreat  is a red bogey; I mean they believe that  it\r\n\r\nis  a red bogey, that 300 people cannot possibly  be\r\n\r\nany  danger to society. But there are others who are\r\n\r\nfully  aware of what the real situation is and  join\r\n\r\nthe  chorus, thereby hoping to save themselves  from\r\n\r\nembarrassing attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Communist Party as a political force in\r\n\r\nany   society  is  always  a  minority  group.   The\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party is not like a football  club  or  a\r\n\r\nturf  club  which  wants to recruit  more  and  more\r\n\r\nmembers.  That has never been the way in  which  the\r\n\r\nCommunist Party operate and the way they operate  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  Communist  Party  is  a  leadership\r\n\r\nelite.  They  themselves  in  their  own  literature\r\n\r\nconsider  themselves  as  a Marxist-Leninist  combat\r\n\r\nparty,  the  vanguard of the proletariat revolution.\r\n\r\nAnd  a  member of the Communist Party is a full-time\r\n\r\ndedicated  professional revolutionary, nothing  more\r\n\r\nthan that and nothing less than that. If we want  to\r\n\r\nfind  an equivalent in our society to this full-time\r\n\r\ndedicated  revolutionary professional,  the  nearest\r\n\r\nanalogy  we  can find is that of a Catholic  priest,\r\n\r\nequally dedicated to the faith. They are even better\r\n\r\nindoctrinated  in  the school of theology  and  they\r\n\r\norganise  themselves  into a disciplined  hierarchy.\r\n\r\nSupposing you have in Singapore 300 Catholic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npriests I do not know whether we have that  number\r\n\r\nhere,  Mr  Speaker - but supposing you do, then  they\r\n\r\ncan  extend  their influence; one priest can  extend\r\n\r\nhis  influence  over a herd.

Therefore,  we have  in  Singapore  large\r\n\r\nnumbers  of  organisations and associations  in  key\r\n\r\nfields  of  human  activities  which  are  easy   to\r\n\r\npenetrate,  easy to capture, and in fact  have  been\r\n\r\npenetrated  and  have been captured.  In  Singapore,\r\n\r\nSir,  we know what these associations are, who  they\r\n\r\nare.  They  are  the  famous  trade  unions  of  the\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. group,  the  Old Boys'  Associations,  the\r\n\r\nRural  Dwellers  Association, the  Country  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation, one group of the Hawkers' Union. These\r\n\r\nare the associations that have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  penetrated and are being used for united front\r\n\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average man may say, what is the paint of\r\n\r\ndoing  all these things? Why do a small group - there\r\n\r\nare  not  many,  just a few hundred,  and  they  are\r\n\r\nenergetic  young men do - these things?  What  purpose\r\n\r\ndoes it serve?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give a very simple and clear example of the\r\n\r\ntremendous  value and importance which  a  group  of\r\n\r\npersons can get from penetrating and capturing these\r\n\r\norganisations. Take the Referendum Bill. There was a\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee on it of which you, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nwere the Chairman. You no doubt were fully aware\r\n\r\nnot  only of the contents of the memoranda  sent  by\r\n\r\nthese  associations, but you even met  some  of  the\r\n\r\nhonourable  gentlemen who purport  to  have  written\r\n\r\nthese memoranda. Sir, on an important issue such  as\r\n\r\nthe  Referendum  Bill,  a basic  important  national\r\n\r\nissue  of the utmost importance, we find a group  of\r\n\r\njust  a  few hundred persons running around.  Having\r\n\r\nalready got these organisations under their control,\r\n\r\nthey set out long memoranda attacking the Government\r\n\r\non  a  stand  which they knew would be   against  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the Communists and their  open  front\r\n\r\norganisations. Now, that happened and we  have  here\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Thomson who proclaimed, \"These  are\r\n\r\npersons  who  represented only one hundred  thousand\r\n\r\npeople or two hundred thousand,\" I forgot the  exact\r\n\r\nfigure. A hundred thousand, but in fact just  a  few\r\n\r\nhundred energetic young men and women who have  done\r\n\r\nthis job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on the one side, this is what a determined\r\n\r\nanti active minority of people are doing, presenting\r\n\r\nforcefully  their  point of view. There  is  nothing\r\n\r\nwrong  with  that  at all. It is highly  commendable\r\n\r\nprovided   the   motives   are   honest   and    the\r\n\r\nrepresentation is honest. Well, they have put  their\r\n\r\npoint  of view. Now, what of the real view  of  the\r\n\r\nvast majority?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of order, Sir.

All he is doing now is to  say  that,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  they  are  manipulating  and  controlling\r\n\r\norganisations.  Having said that, I  think  that  is\r\n\r\nenough and he should not go into further details. He\r\n\r\nshould  now come to the point and answer the  charge\r\n\r\nas   to  why  these  communist  and  communist-front\r\n\r\nleaders have not been restrained. Dr Goh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What I was saying is of the\r\n\r\nessence  of  the argument. It is not  sufficient,  I\r\n\r\nthink,    to   say   that   they   are   controlling\r\n\r\norganisations.  What is important is to  demonstrate\r\n\r\nhow  they  do it and why they do it. Otherwise,  how\r\n\r\ncan  we  ever put across the view that, taking  into\r\n\r\naccount the whole modus operandi of these groups, it\r\n\r\nis  not  in  the interests of Singapore and  to  the\r\n\r\nadvantage  of the people of Singapore to  lock  them\r\n\r\nup;  it  is  not in our interests to carry  out  the\r\n\r\npolicy recommended by the Member for Cairnhill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I was comparing what an active minority could\r\n\r\ndo  in  capturing associations presenting forcefully\r\n\r\ntheir  point  of  view  as against  an  inert  large\r\n\r\nminority, which has an opinion of its own no  doubt,\r\n\r\nbut  are  either incapable of organising  themselves\r\n\r\ninto  a  cohesive  and  vocal  organisation  or  are\r\n\r\nunwilling  to  do  so. And I say,  so  long  as  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  people,  either  through  laziness  or\r\n\r\nthrough  ignorance, remain indifferent  to  what  is\r\n\r\ngoing  on around them, then I say to take the action\r\n\r\nrecommended  by  the Member for Cairnhill  is  quite\r\n\r\nwrong.   Put   it  this  way.  Can  I  explain   the\r\n\r\nproposition  this way? Supposing we do  this;  these\r\n\r\nbirds disappear, then everyone - the majority of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople - will breathe a sigh of relief. Then they fall\r\n\r\nback  on the old former state of indolence. Does  it\r\n\r\nhelp  the  situation, Mr Speaker?  Does  it  really\r\n\r\nhelp?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if by locking up these birds you can remove\r\n\r\nthe threat once and for all, then perhaps the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill may have his point, but I  say  this,\r\n\r\nthat  does not happen. Remove them - the top leaders,\r\n\r\nthe  top  echelon, all known open front leaders - they\r\n\r\ndisappear,  you  may have peace and  quiet  for  two\r\n\r\nyears,  three  years,  four years;  then  the  whole\r\n\r\nprocess   will  start  again, because  this   whole\r\n\r\nmovement is based on an ideology and ideas;  because\r\n\r\nit  is a revolutionary and real political force;  it\r\n\r\nhas  its  own  methods of drawing on new  people  to\r\n\r\nreplace those that have been put away, and you solve\r\n\r\nnothing at all. On the other hand, by so doing,  you\r\n\r\ngive  the majority - the inert majority - a false  sense\r\n\r\nof  security for a few years at the end of which new\r\n\r\ncrises will develop. They will be jolted into a  new\r\n\r\nfeeling   of  danger;  they  may  bestir  themselves\r\n\r\nperhaps  for a few months, a year or two.  Something\r\n\r\nhas  gone wrong; but they will not know what  to  do\r\n\r\nabout  it;  they will be running around  frightening\r\n\r\nothers. Then the demand may come from some to  stage\r\n\r\nanother lock-up. So this can go on ad infinitum  and\r\n\r\nit does not solve the basic problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what is the correct way of\r\n\r\ndealing with the situation?

Did he not listen when I said that  the\r\n\r\nCommunists and their stooges in the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nwere mounting all this campaign of agitation against\r\n\r\nus,  and I itemised them one by one?

I want to develop this point in a rather vivid\r\n\r\nway. I have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrying  several ways to present this  fact,  to  put\r\n\r\nthis point across. I think the best way would be  to\r\n\r\nrelate  what  some Japanese civil servants  told  me\r\n\r\nwhen  I  went there the first time. They were asking\r\n\r\nabout   the  Singapore  Government, who  were   the\r\n\r\nMinisters  and  so  on.  They  asked,  \"Who  is  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Home Affairs? How old is  he?\"  They\r\n\r\nthought  I was the youngest Minister in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nI  said,  \"No, no, actually I am one of the oldest.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could it be? How old is your Home Minister?\"  I\r\n\r\nsaid  he has not reached the age of 30 yet, and they\r\n\r\nwere  absolutely  appalled. I mean,  they  say  this\r\n\r\nthing cannot happen. Their Ministers are 60 plus and\r\n\r\n70 plus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that in Singapore here you have - mind you,\r\n\r\nI am not saying there is any demerit in being young,\r\n\r\nfar  from it - a very youthful Cabinet points to  the\r\n\r\nfact  that there is something wrong somewhere.  This\r\n\r\nsort of thing does not happen in normal societies. I\r\n\r\nmean,  you take the age of Cabinet Ministers in  any\r\n\r\nwell ordered society, and it is usually 60 plus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Has age got anything to do with\r\n\r\nrestraining Communist or Communist-front leaders?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I want to make this point\r\n\r\nwithout further embellishment. Singapore society  is\r\n\r\nusually   vulnerable   to  active   minorities.   In\r\n\r\nSingapore,  with  rapid political  changes,  it  has\r\n\r\nalways been the younger people who, being more  bold\r\n\r\nand more rash than their elders, are prepared to put\r\n\r\ndown their stake and make their bid for power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Like the Member for Queenstown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There are several reasons why\r\n\r\nthis  is so. I see the Member for Hong Lim glowering\r\n\r\nat  me, so I will not go into these reasons, but  if\r\n\r\nyou, Mr Speaker, Sir, will just give me two minutes\r\n\r\nmore.  The  reason is that there is  no  traditional\r\n\r\nleadership  in  this country. There  is  traditional\r\n\r\nleadership  in  the  Federation  among   the   Malay\r\n\r\npopulation.  Therefore,  it  is  not  possible   for\r\n\r\nenergetic  minorities to penetrate organisations  by\r\n\r\nunited front tactics to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncapture  power.  But  in  Singapore,  there  is   no\r\n\r\ntraditional leadership. After all, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\n150  years  ago  there  were  only  300  persons  in\r\n\r\nSingapore -  mostly  fishermen or pirates - and  people\r\n\r\nhave   been   coming  in  without  any   traditional\r\n\r\nleadership as it is understood in societies  with  a\r\n\r\nlong   history.  This  poses  for  us  rather  acute\r\n\r\nproblems.  How can you maintain political  stability\r\n\r\nin   a  situation  where  there  is  no  traditional\r\n\r\nleadership,  where  an  active  minority  can  quite\r\n\r\neasily   win  political  power  through   fair   and\r\n\r\ndemocratic    means;   active   and   well-organised\r\n\r\nminorities like the Malayan Communist Party which is\r\n\r\nthe  most  active,  the  best disciplined,  has  the\r\n\r\nlongest  history,  the  toughest,  and,  from   all\r\n\r\naccounts,  persons to be reckoned with? But  I  say,\r\n\r\nfor  reasons which I have dealt with at some length,\r\n\r\nat this stage of our historical development, to wade\r\n\r\ninto  them  in the manner prescribed and recommended\r\n\r\nby  the Member for Cairnhill would be a grave error.\r\n\r\nWe  say  it is always better to match them blow  for\r\n\r\nblow  in  the hope, in the expectation indeed,  that\r\n\r\nmore  and  more  people  will  understand  the  real\r\n\r\nmeaning  of what is going on. When you get more  and\r\n\r\nmore people understanding the real situation, then I\r\n\r\nsay we will be in a position to face the assault  of\r\n\r\nthis  minority group, however active  they  can  be,\r\n\r\nhowever dedicated they can be.

This must come on the main\r\n\r\nmotion.  We  are now debating the amendment  which\r\n\r\ndeals  with  the Communist threat, the restraining\r\n\r\nof  Communist  and Communist-front leaders.  I  am\r\n\r\ntrying to bring that to a conclusion. Mr Ong  Eng\r\n\r\nGuan, anything further to say?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I have nothing else to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On the amendment, Mr Rajah?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> On the amendment, Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nam   grateful  to  the  Prime  Minister  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance for having  made  our  task\r\n\r\nsomewhat  easier in the moving of this  amendment.\r\n\r\nIf  we  are  to  bring home our amendment  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  we  would, first of all have to show  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  Communist and Communist-front  leaders\r\n\r\nwho     are     manipulating    and    controlling\r\n\r\norganisations. That is the primary base from which\r\n\r\nthere could have been any possibility for us, from\r\n\r\nthis  side of the House, to convince the whole  of\r\n\r\nthe  House  that there is merit in our  amendment.\r\n\r\nFortunately  for us, and also from  the  point  of\r\n\r\nview of the Member for Hong Lim, because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  now  can  talk  more on the main  motion,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has made it easier for all  of  us  by\r\n\r\naccepting  the  fact that there are Communist  and\r\n\r\nCommunist-front   leaders  who   are,   in   fact,\r\n\r\nmanipulating  and  controlling organisations.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, we on the Front-benches here have been in\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition for the last three years. This  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  novel point we are propounding  today.  We\r\n\r\nhave been propounding it for the last three years.\r\n\r\nWe  have  been  propounding  it  on  every  single\r\n\r\noccasion. Whenever we have thought it is necessary\r\n\r\nto tell the Government of this threat and of their\r\n\r\nduty  to  do  something about it, we  have  always\r\n\r\nraised it. The threat that existed three years ago\r\n\r\nhas  continued to exist and still exists today.  I\r\n\r\ncan  point in the Prime Minister's argument  that,\r\n\r\nin his view, the restraining and the incarceration\r\n\r\nof  Communist leaders or Communist-front  leaders,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  containing the problem  that  affects\r\n\r\nSingapore, might make it worse. That is a point of\r\n\r\nview which is worthy of respect. It is a matter of\r\n\r\nopinion. Perhaps the Prime Minister may be  right.\r\n\r\nWho  should  know the Communists better  than  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister himself? He has admitted it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position up to the time when merger was in\r\n\r\nthe  offing was different, I am submitting to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  from  what it  is  today.  One  could\r\n\r\nargue,  and the Government could reasonably argue,\r\n\r\nthat before merger, politics were somewhat clouded\r\n\r\nand  were not on a proper footing. We had not  got\r\n\r\ndown   to  the  level  of  national  issues,   and\r\n\r\ntherefore the arresting of Communist or Communist-front leaders might have been misinterpreted  into\r\n\r\nmeaning  the  arrest of opponents  who  have  been\r\n\r\ndubbed  as Communists or Communist-front  leaders,\r\n\r\nand  thereby bringing discredit on the Government.\r\n\r\nThat  is a possibility and one respects that point\r\n\r\nof   view.   But  today  the  position  is   quite\r\n\r\ndifferent.  The  position  today  is   this;   the\r\n\r\nOpposition,  the Government have all  united,  and\r\n\r\neven the Barisan Sosialis, Mr Speaker, Sir.  The\r\n\r\nmost important thing for Singapore is the question\r\n\r\nof  merger.  We  have different ideas  of  how  we\r\n\r\nshould merge, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npossibly  when  we should merge. But  we  are  all\r\n\r\nagreed - the  Barisan Sosialis, the Workers'  Party,\r\n\r\nthe  United People's Party and us - that  merger  is\r\n\r\nimportant   and  that  Singapore  cannot   survive\r\n\r\nwithout it, and the sooner we get on with  it  the\r\n\r\nbetter.  Therefore,  I  put  this  point  in   all\r\n\r\nseriousness. If anybody - be he a Communist, be he a\r\n\r\nFascist, be he some foreigner - does something with\r\n\r\nmalicious intent to wreck merger, then that person\r\n\r\nshould be put away. He should be temporarily  kept\r\n\r\naside. Today we have reached the position where we\r\n\r\nhave now before us a united national issue. And as\r\n\r\non this issue we are united, and when I say \"we\" I\r\n\r\nmean we as an Assembly, the Government in advising\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly  has  a sacred  duty  to  advise  it\r\n\r\nproperly.  If then the Assembly is satisfied  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  dangerous persons who are going  about\r\n\r\nintending to wreck merger and that they are  using\r\n\r\nevery  possible means to wreck it, then I  say  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government, \"The time has come to  stop  them\r\n\r\nfrom doing it, at least up till after merger.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of the amendment, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, is - and we hope we will have the House with us\r\n\r\non  this - if the Barisan really mean that they want\r\n\r\nmerger,   then   surely  they  must   accept   the\r\n\r\nproposition that follows from it - to frustrate  any\r\n\r\nelement  that  tries to wreck merger  for  reasons\r\n\r\nbest known to itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, Mr Speaker, Sir, that we have\r\n\r\nbeen  asked  by  the  Member  for  Queenstown   to\r\n\r\nindicate our line on the main motion. On  that  we\r\n\r\nwill  reply when our time comes, and when the time\r\n\r\ndoes  come, Mr Speaker, Sir, we hope that we will\r\n\r\nbe  given  an  opportunity to reply  on  the  main\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No other Opposition Member wishes\r\n\r\nto  speak? I propose to accept a closure  of  this\r\n\r\namendment.  Any Opposition Member  who  wishes  to\r\n\r\nmove a closure motion may do so now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nit  has been repeatedly said that the action taken\r\n\r\nby  the  Member for Cairnhill when  he  was  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister was a mistake. He now calls upon the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment   to   take  action,  and   again   the\r\n\r\nGovernment say, \"We are not going to make the same\r\n\r\nmistake.\"  Sir, when you say it is a  mistake,  it\r\n\r\nmeans you have brought disastrous results or  have\r\n\r\ncaused  damage. I ask the Government  what  damage\r\n\r\nand disastrous results have been brought about  by\r\n\r\nthe  action of the then Chief Minister  by  taking\r\n\r\naction against the Communists and putting them  in\r\n\r\nChangi? The disastrous result was that we lost the\r\n\r\nelection  badly. I admit that was  the  disastrous\r\n\r\nresult.  It  has  not  brought  any  disaster   to\r\n\r\nSingapore. Singapore has got one new Constitution.\r\n\r\nWe  have  got  the Prime Minister sitting  there.\r\n\r\nWithout  the  new Constitution,  he  will  not  be\r\n\r\nsitting  there. Probably if that was not done,  we\r\n\r\nmight even be under Communist control now, or  the\r\n\r\nBritish  might have possibly taken it back because\r\n\r\nof the trouble and the bloodshed. We might even be\r\n\r\nunder  martial law now, Sir, and even Malaya might\r\n\r\nnot  have got its independence, if the then  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  did not act as he acted then.  The  only\r\n\r\ndisaster  that  was  brought  about  affected  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A.  As  the  Member  for Cairnhill  repeatedly\r\n\r\nsaid, he had always put the country and the people\r\n\r\nbefore  the Party. We do not regret the fact  that\r\n\r\nit has brought disaster to the S.P.A., although it\r\n\r\nbrought  us  to a defeat of five against  43,  and\r\n\r\nmade it necessary for us to endure the humiliation\r\n\r\nand  the  harsh  words of the then  very  arrogant\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister.  We swallowed that  and  we  were\r\n\r\nhappy  because  it  had not  brought  disaster  to\r\n\r\nSingapore, but, in fact, it has brought  Singapore\r\n\r\non  the verge of independence. Sir, if they  still\r\n\r\nsay  that this is not true, I would like to  quote\r\n\r\nfrom \"The Battle for Merger\", page 198, the letter\r\n\r\nfrom Mr Puthucheary. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Right up to the end of 1955 it seemed\r\n\r\nimpossible  that  the  British  would   make   any\r\n\r\nimaginative  political move which would  turn  the\r\n\r\nflanks as it were of the armed revolt.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you read that passage carefully, it will\r\n\r\ngive  you the intention or the picture behind  the\r\n\r\nminds  of the so-called Communists. They  did  not\r\n\r\nthink that the British would give up Singapore and\r\n\r\nMalaya  so easily. They thought that armed revolt,\r\n\r\nbloodshed, riots and force\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  absolutely necessary to get independence  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  That was what they  thought,  and  Mr\r\n\r\nPuthucheary admitted that it was a mistake that they\r\n\r\nhad  thought  that  the British would  not  give  up\r\n\r\nSingapore so easily - and the British did give up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the then Chief Minister did not put\r\n\r\nsuch  people with such misconceptions  in  a  safe\r\n\r\nplace and if they had been allowed freely to work\r\n\r\non the theory that the British would not give up\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaya without bloodshed and  without\r\n\r\narmed  revolt, what would have happened, I ask  you,\r\n\r\nSir?  Would there be a Prime Minister sitting  there\r\n\r\nwith  a  Constitution  and parliamentary  democracy\r\n\r\nexisting today?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister gave that argument. I agree wholeheartedly that the happiness and the economic stability of the country have a lot to do with the fertility of the grounds for Communist manipulation. I quite agree with that. But, Sir, although that is\r\n\r\ntrue,  it is not true to say that we must wait  till\r\n\r\nthere  is economic stability and everybody is  happy\r\n\r\nbefore you can take action. It is like saying,  \"Let\r\n\r\nus  not  catch  the thieves; let us  not  catch  the\r\n\r\nrobbers.  Wait  till there is full  employment  when\r\n\r\neverybody  has a job, then people will not  want  to\r\n\r\nsteal, except a few kleptomaniacs. Nobody wants  to\r\n\r\nsteal,  so  let  us wait till that  position  exists\r\n\r\nbefore  we start arresting thieves and robbers.\"  It\r\n\r\nis   like  saying  that  unless  there  is  economic\r\n\r\nstability  all  round, let us leave  the  Communists\r\n\r\nalone. I do not think that argument holds water. You\r\n\r\nwill remember, Sir, even a few years ago, when there\r\n\r\nwas  a  series  of  kidnappings  in  Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment took the same attitude. They  would  not\r\n\r\nmove   until  pressure  was  put  on  them  by   the\r\n\r\nOpposition.  I  think  the pressure  today  in  this\r\n\r\namendment  is very necessary to make the  Government\r\n\r\nmove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I move, \"That the question be now put.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Standing Order 51 (1)\r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'After a question has been proposed a Member rising\r\n\r\nin his place may claim to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That  the  question  be now put\",  and,  unless  it\r\n\r\nappears to the Speaker or Chairman that\r\n\r\nsuch  motion  is  an  abuse  of  the  rules  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly,  or an infringement of the rights  ot  the\r\n\r\nminority,  the question, \"That the question  be  now\r\n\r\nput\",  shall  be put forthwith and decided  without\r\n\r\namendment or debate, not with standing that the mover\r\n\r\nhas had no opportunity to make his reply.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore put the Question.

Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  we  are  not  an\r\n\r\nirresponsible Opposition. We are not trying to usurp\r\n\r\npower  nor  do  we  wish to wreck  anything  without\r\n\r\ntaking  into consideration the consequences.  So  on\r\n\r\nthis amendment moved by the Member for Cairnhill  it\r\n\r\nhas  been  the  stand of our Party  right  from  its\r\n\r\ninception   to   defend  and  uphold   parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  in  our country. For this  reason,  this\r\n\r\namendment   expressing   no   confidence   in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment in that it has failed to take appropriate\r\n\r\nsteps  to  restrict the expansion of  the  Communist\r\n\r\nmovement  in Singapore is wholeheartedly  supported\r\n\r\nby  us.  But I wish to make it clear that in  giving\r\n\r\nour  support, our anti-Communist stand is not  anti-Chinese, for there has been a suggestion that  anti-Communist  means  anti a certain community.  It  has\r\n\r\nbeen our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nfundamental stand to create a united nation  and  to\r\n\r\ninculcate  a national consciousness in the  various\r\n\r\nraces in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not happy with the stand taken by the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Although the Prime Minister has dwelt at\r\n\r\nthat  they  are an anti-Communist Party,  except  to\r\n\r\ntell  the  people  that they are  a  length  on  his\r\n\r\nGovernment's  way of fighting the Communist  threat,\r\n\r\nthey refuse to acknowledge non-Communist Party.  But\r\n\r\nit  is  clear to us that the P.A.P. Government  have\r\n\r\nslept  and  eaten  together  with  the  Communist\r\n\r\nleaders. In this matter, it cannot be said that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment had made a mistake because  they  knew\r\n\r\nvery  well  and  they realised who their  companions\r\n\r\nactually   were.  These  former  friends  have   now\r\n\r\ndeserted  them. It is true - as has been said  by  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister of the Federation - that once a person\r\n\r\nis a Communist, he will remain a Communist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our efforts to try and win the minds of the\r\n\r\nCommunists  cannot succeed. Why I cannot accept  the\r\n\r\narguments put forward by the Government, Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, is because it is merely an excuse  for\r\n\r\nthem  to work in close collaboration with  the  \r\n\r\nCommunists. We have seen what the P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nhave  done  in  Singapore;  they  have  helped   to\r\n\r\ndisseminate an ideology which is dangerous to the \r\n\r\nyouths of the State. I say that it is dangerous  to\r\n\r\nexpose  our  youths to such an ideology  because  we\r\n\r\nknow  that  the  Communists  are  always  trying  to\r\n\r\ninfiltrate  into  organisations. We  have  seen  the\r\n\r\ndamage  done to this country immediately  after  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. came to power. And I am quite sure that there\r\n\r\nare  many industrialists today who are reluctant  to\r\n\r\ninvest  their capital here because they would  first\r\n\r\nlike to have an assurance - an adequate guarantee - that\r\n\r\nit  will be safe to do so. But today let us  have  a\r\n\r\nlook  at  the  state  of  the trade  union  movement\r\n\r\nalthough the Government may believe that the setting\r\n\r\nup  of  the Industrial Arbitration Court has brought\r\n\r\nabout  industrial peace in Singapore;  similarly  in\r\n\r\nmatters of education where damage has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndone;  and, so too, the development programme  which\r\n\r\nhas been blocked by the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, a point which has impressed us was that the amendment moved by the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nwhich  sought to delete the words \"like the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis\" was rejected by the Members of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  They prefer the words \"like  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis\" to remain in the original amendment  moved\r\n\r\nby  the Member for Cairnhill. It is not my intention\r\n\r\nto  reopen  the  debate  on  the  amendment  to  the\r\n\r\namendment,  but it is clear to us that  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  Members are openly accepting the challenge\r\n\r\ncontained in the amendment and they do not  want  to\r\n\r\nescape from the original intention contained in  the\r\n\r\namendment of the Member for Cairnhill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, at the moment we are at the cross roads as to whether we are to uphold\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy in our State or we  will  be\r\n\r\nforced  to  follow  the footsteps of  the  Left-wing\r\n\r\nleaders who are dictated by the Communist Party. For\r\n\r\ninstance,  from  Indonesia, they have  followed  the\r\n\r\nevents  leading to the Malaysia debate. It is  clear\r\n\r\nto the people of Singapore that there are two groups\r\n\r\nnow  which would like to shape the fate and  destiny\r\n\r\nof the people of Singapore; one is for parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy   while   the  other  is   for   Communist\r\n\r\ndictatorship in Singapore. The Barisan Sosialis have\r\n\r\nmoved this no confidence motion. Their intention  is\r\n\r\nmerely  to  create  an atmosphere  of  tension.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, if their motion is approved and adopted by\r\n\r\nthe Assembly, it means that the Government will have\r\n\r\nto  resign and we will go hack to the people to face\r\n\r\nanother general election for the purpose of electing\r\n\r\na  new  government. This is clear  even  though  the\r\n\r\nReferendum  Bill has been adopted by  this  Assembly\r\n\r\nwith   a   majority.   According  to   parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy, even those who oppose the Referendum Bill\r\n\r\nmust  accept  it;  they  must  accept  the  majority\r\n\r\ndecision.  But  this has been used  by  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  as  another  occasion  to  criticise   the\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill in spite of the fact\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  it has been assented to by the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara.

Not\r\n\r\nonly  from  within U.M.N.O. but also from the  other\r\n\r\nside,  they suspect that I am an instrument to wreck\r\n\r\nMalaysia, because there is a section in U.M.N.O. who\r\n\r\nare demanding this and that hi the local newspapers.\r\n\r\nRecently   the  Plebeian  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nsupported  a  section of U.M.N.O.  It  alleged  that\r\n\r\nsomeone was fighting for the Cyprus Constitution  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis claim to be wise but they are\r\n\r\nactually unwise if they want to play politics  as  a\r\n\r\ngame of chess. I have played this political game  of\r\n\r\nchess  with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and also with the Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister for Health and Law.  In  order  to\r\n\r\nattract  certain  sections  of  U.M.N.O. to   wreck\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  the Barisan Sosialis must not indulge  in\r\n\r\nthis game at the moment. It is too late because  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  struggle  is  inappropriate.  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, this is the game being played by the\r\n\r\nCommunists  who  are  trying  to  set  one   against\r\n\r\nanother,  whether they are in the Government  or  in\r\n\r\nthe Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite recently, Mr Deputy Speaker, there was an\r\n\r\narticle - I  have  it  with me  and  I  will  read  an\r\n\r\nexcerpt - that U.M.N.O. has been accused of supporting\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. in its undemocratic action.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nrecent  news article in the Plebeian, the  organ  of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis. I am surprised; why should the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  be  envious  or  jealous  of  the\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.  Members  in  the Assembly?  What  have  we\r\n\r\nrobbed  from  them? As far as I know,  we  have  not\r\n\r\ngiven them any trouble. I have told them not to  try\r\n\r\nto  offend the U.M.N.O. Members. If they want to try\r\n\r\nto  offend  U.M.N.O. Members in  Singapore,  then  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that the consequences will be very bad  for\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, it appears that the Minister for Home Affairs loves the Barisan Sosialis. The\r\n\r\nreason  is  that  he pampers them.  They  are  given\r\n\r\n$500/-  allowance  each and they are  granted  other\r\n\r\nprivileges. Even the constables on duty  show  their\r\n\r\nrespect  by  saluting every Member of this  Assembly\r\n\r\nwhen  he enters or leaves the Chamber. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  I  wish  to  remind the  Minister  that  when\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. supported the Government to eliminate  the\r\n\r\nA.R.T.I.S. movement, why was he then afraid  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists   and  the  pro-Communists?  Mr   Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   the  Barisan  Sosialis  said   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  did  not arrest them because  they  were\r\n\r\nafraid,  but tonight the Parliamentary Secretary  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Culture said that the  Government\r\n\r\nare  not  afraid.  The people will  decide  who  are\r\n\r\nafraid and who are not afraid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Deputy Speaker, this amendment moved by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Cairnhill, regarding the pro-Communists\r\n\r\nand  Communists who are playing their  role  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, is a good amendment. I say it is a\r\n\r\ngood   amendment   because  it  will   protect   the\r\n\r\nleadership   of  the  Barisan  Sosialis   from   the\r\n\r\nCommunist   danger.  We  from   the   Alliance   are\r\n\r\nconscious - and  we  hope  that  the  Government   are\r\n\r\nconscious  too - that the Barisan Sosialis  have  been\r\n\r\ninfiltrated   by   Communists;   and    with    this\r\n\r\nconsciousness,  as  well  as  with  the  object   of\r\n\r\nprotecting the leadership of the Barisan Sosialis, I\r\n\r\nplead  with the Government, if possible,  after  the\r\n\r\nsitting  of  the Assembly, to instruct  the  Special\r\n\r\nBranch to issue orders for the guards to be ready to\r\n\r\narrest and detain them at a place they think fit, so\r\n\r\nthat  our  plan can be proceeded with in  peace  and\r\n\r\nharmony.

The Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nmade  no  bones about it that he would have put  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar in gaol so that he would do\r\n\r\na  little  rethinking. Probably if  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar were in Changi Gaol he might  not  be\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister today, but I would have  thought\r\n\r\nthat  probably  he could have spent  his  time  very\r\n\r\nusefully  studying Mandarin or Hokkien  so  that  he\r\n\r\ncould deliver better speeches in those languages  at\r\n\r\nmass  meetings. The Prime Minister and the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance have explained very well indeed that the\r\n\r\nmethod  of  controlling the Communists, as advocated\r\n\r\nby the Member for Cairnhill, is inadequate, and that\r\n\r\nwhat  is more important is to consider the long-term\r\n\r\nsolution  to  the problem. Both of them  have  drawn\r\n\r\nattention to the fact that the political and  social\r\n\r\nconditions  in the country are vital  in  the  fight\r\n\r\nagainst Communism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson previously advised the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nto  get  rid of its Communists and Communist fellow-travellers. Last year this group of people left  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.; they purged themselves out of the P.A.P. and 13  Assemblymen  went  across to  form  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  Those  who control the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\ntoday  are  quite  well versed in the  united  front\r\n\r\ntactics  which the Member for Anson and  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill  knew only too well  when  they  were\r\n\r\nChief Ministers. May I just quote what the Secretary-General  of  the  Barisan Sosialis,  Mr  Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong,  had  to  say when he was  Member  for  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah, in Hansard of 7th June. 1956, col. 2050:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But now the Liberal-Socialists also refuse to be\r\n\r\nparty  to  the  censure of the Colonial  Office  for\r\n\r\nrejecting  the  minimum demands  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  They  go further. They are  prepared  to\r\n\r\ncensure  the delegation of the people of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis  is something which cannot be forgiven  by  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. This Party proves once  again\r\n\r\nthat  a  change of name does not mean  a  change  of\r\n\r\nquality. The old Progressive Party, composed of  the\r\n\r\n\"yes\"  men  of  colonialism,  and  the  not  so  old\r\n\r\nDemocrat   Party,  composed  of  reactionary   local\r\n\r\ncapitalist  elements,  together  thought  that  they\r\n\r\ncould fool the public if they called themselves by a\r\n\r\nnew name - the Liberal-Socialists. The donkey tried to\r\n\r\npretend  that  it  was a horse. But  this  amendment\r\n\r\nproves  once again and for all time that this  Party\r\n\r\nis neither Liberal nor Socialist. If they are honest\r\n\r\nwith  themselves and with the people, they will call\r\n\r\nthemselves  by  their  correct  name -  the  Colonial\r\n\r\nCollaborators Party.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today we find the Barisan Sosialis forming a\r\n\r\nunited  front  with the Liberal-Socialist  Party - the\r\n\r\nvery  same Party which the Barisan Secretary-General\r\n\r\nin  1956  had castigated as a Colonial Collaborators\r\n\r\nParty. The Barisan Sosialis Party can be very  aptly\r\n\r\nnamed today as the Barisan Liberal Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Member for Anson supported in principle the amendment moved by the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill; only he did not want the words \"like  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis\" to be included in the  amendment.\r\n\r\nHe  was  supporting in principle that Communist  and\r\n\r\nCommunist-front  leaders should be  restrained  from\r\n\r\nmanipulating  and  controlling  organisations.   The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson in one sense is quite honest.

Throughout the  records\r\n\r\nof  Hansard, since 1955, you can see that  there  is\r\n\r\nonly  one  consistent  line of  thinking  which  the\r\n\r\nMember   for   Anson  has - he  is  for  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy and against Communism. Therefore, in  that\r\n\r\nsense,  he is honest. He has learnt from his  bitter\r\n\r\nexperience of how the Communists wove circles around\r\n\r\nhim  when he was Chief Minister. First, there was  a\r\n\r\nrally   at   Kallang   to   send   off   the   first\r\n\r\nconstitutional delegation to London. At this  rally,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Anson, then  Chief  Minister,  was\r\n\r\nstanding  side  by side with me,  or  rather  I  was\r\n\r\nstanding side by side with him on the platform.  The\r\n\r\nplatform collapsed and he disappeared from the scene\r\n\r\nand  went  back to his Changi home. Subsequently  in\r\n\r\nthe  debate  in the House on the incident,  Mr  Lee\r\n\r\nKuan  Yew, Member for Tanjong Pagar, read statements\r\n\r\nfrom  the Press concerning the stand of Mr David Marshall\r\n\r\ntowards  those  who had caused the collapse  of  the\r\n\r\nrally.  We said that gangsters were responsible  for\r\n\r\nthe collapse of the rally, but Mr David Marshall insisted\r\n\r\nthat  it  was the Communists who caused the platform\r\n\r\nto collapse and made a fiasco of the rally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to give an opportunity to the Members of the Opposition to speak on this\r\n\r\namendment, because this amendment is theirs and,  as\r\n\r\nI  have  said  before, we are going to refrain  from\r\n\r\nvoting on this amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, I will not take much of\r\n\r\nyour  time just  a few minutes.

He and  his  Government  are of the opinion that the methods which were\r\n\r\nused  by  the former Government, of which  I  was  a\r\n\r\nMinister,  were  methods that were not  correct  and\r\n\r\nthat   they  would  only  increase  the  number   of\r\n\r\nCommunist followers in Singapore.

Being  at war with the  Communists  from\r\n\r\n1948  to  1960  for  more  or  less  12  years,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  the  Federation of  Malaya  did  not\r\n\r\nhesitate  to  use force against the  Communists  and\r\n\r\ntheir  supporters, and in that war in Malaya against\r\n\r\nthe  Communists, the police and military forces were\r\n\r\nused,  and many sacrificed their lives. In addition,\r\n\r\nmany  civilian lives were sacrificed - Malays, Chinese\r\n\r\nand Indians. But, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Government\r\n\r\nof the Federation of Malaya knew its responsibility.\r\n\r\nIt  had  no  fear  of arresting such Communists  and\r\n\r\ntheir  supporters. What are the consequences  today?\r\n\r\nLocal  elections  have  been  held  throughout   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya. In places which were  formerly\r\n\r\nCommunist strongholds, what has happened now? It can\r\n\r\nbe  said that more than three-quarters of the  local\r\n\r\nelections  have  been won by the Alliance  and  that\r\n\r\nthree-quarters of the places where they have won are\r\n\r\nareas   which   were  formerly  dominated   by   the\r\n\r\nCommunists  or  by their supporters.  I  am  putting\r\n\r\nforth   this  argument  to  refute  what  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has said that he did not wish to use force.\r\n\r\nHe  wanted to calm the people's minds; he wanted  to\r\n\r\nattract  their  attention or to  win  their  hearts.\r\n\r\nThese  were the only ways by which he had  hoped  to\r\n\r\novercome  the  problem of Communism.  To  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  of  Singapore and  to  the  Government  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I  say,  do  not  fear.  If  the  former\r\n\r\nGovernment  could use force and strong  measures  to\r\n\r\novercome  the Communist problem - as was done  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya with success\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-why should the Singapore Government not use similar\r\n\r\nmethods  to  overcome the problem here?  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I am not saying, as some of the Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly do, that all members of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis are Communists; but the Government and  the\r\n\r\nMinisters over the radio, in the Press and  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  have  always accused the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nand  its  supporters of being members and supporters\r\n\r\nof the Communist Party. If the Government knows that\r\n\r\nthere are Communists in the Barisan Sosialis and  in\r\n\r\nother    organisations,   I   think   it   is    its\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to deal with them if  it  is  really\r\n\r\nkeen  in  protecting the welfare of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the security of our friends  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation. The time has come for the Government  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out its administration and to use the  powers\r\n\r\ngiven  by  this Assembly to deal with the  Communist\r\n\r\ndanger, which the Government has said is at large in\r\n\r\nthe   Barisan  Sosialis  and,  recently,  in   other\r\n\r\norganisations.  I  am  compelled  to   believe   the\r\n\r\npropositions put forward by the Government, for  the\r\n\r\nBarisan,  which have been openly accused,  have  not\r\n\r\ndenied  that among their ranks there are people  who\r\n\r\nare members of the Communist Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, here I would like to draw the attention of this House to the fact that many of the\r\n\r\nleaders of the Barisan Sosialis have been accused by\r\n\r\nthe    Government   as   Communists   or   Communist\r\n\r\nsupporters. They have always uttered unsavoury words\r\n\r\nagainst  the Government of the Federation of  Malaya\r\n\r\nand its leaders. Many such people who are members of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis at this time have no shame  at\r\n\r\nall.  I say that they have no shame because some  of\r\n\r\nthe  Members,  whom  I  need not  mention,  are  not\r\n\r\ncitizens   of   Singapore  but   citizens   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation. And I know of two leaders of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  who,  when  attending conferences  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation and elsewhere, used passports  issued  by\r\n\r\nthe Federation Government. These are some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the leaders of the Barisan Sosialis, and they say\r\n\r\nthat  they do not like the Federation; that they  do\r\n\r\nnot like merger; that whatever the Government say is\r\n\r\nnot correct. They do not seem to have any shame,  as\r\n\r\nif they are animals. They do not like the Federation\r\n\r\nbut  still  they use passports of the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  And such people are leaders in the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casually I say this so that the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  could pay attention to this: that  their\r\n\r\ncitizenship be  taken away and that the Government of\r\n\r\nSingapore  could pay attention to this  - that  those\r\n\r\npeople who are not citizens of Singapore should  not\r\n\r\nbe  given an opportunity to take part in politics in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That the words proposed to be added,\r\n\r\nbe there added.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes, 7; Noes, 15; Abstentions,\r\n\r\n26; Absent, 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ayes.

It had just  won\r\n\r\n43  out  of the 51 seats, which was a record  of  no\r\n\r\nmean achievement in any parliamentary election. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  in those days I am  sure  the  eight\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members on this side of the  House  were\r\n\r\nfeeling  a  bit  cool, particularly  when  the  air-conditioning  here is cooler than the average.  Then\r\n\r\nduring  the course of the following three years  the\r\n\r\ntide  changed. The Opposition ranks started to swell\r\n\r\nand,  Sir, you must be finding difficulty in placing\r\n\r\nseats  for  those  new additions to the  Opposition.\r\n\r\nWith  26 now on this side and 25 on the other  side,\r\n\r\nthe temperature of this Chamber, from the effect  of\r\n\r\nthe  air conditioning, is just nice, because  it  is\r\n\r\nevenly distributed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, Sir, the defection of the Member for Bras\r\n\r\nBasah  has  tipped the scales. It  has  reduced  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   majority  of  one   to   a   minority\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Since then this Government has  managed\r\n\r\nto  survive not from its own majority but from  acts\r\n\r\nof  chivalry and generosity displayed by the  S.P.A.\r\n\r\nand  U.M.N.O. which managed to keep the P.A.P. from\r\n\r\nbeing outvoted. Sir, I feel sorry, as I skip through\r\n\r\nthe events mentally, the rise and fall of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  is like the rise and fall of  the  Roman\r\n\r\nEmpire. Looking back on its heyday, I could remember\r\n\r\nvividly the days when the overwhelming masses of the\r\n\r\npeople  found in the P.A.P. a beacon of their  hopes\r\n\r\nand  the depository of their aspirations. The masses\r\n\r\nsurged  forward -  [Interruption]  Sir,  they  were\r\n\r\nhiding behind. They dare not come\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  yet. The masses surged forward at the  call  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. The forces of reaction trembled  at  the\r\n\r\nvery  mention  of its name and at the sight  of  its\r\n\r\nsymbol. But, Sir, all these happenings have occurred\r\n\r\nwithin  the  short space of one or  two  years.  The\r\n\r\narrogance displayed by the P.A.P. leadership led  to\r\n\r\nthe  antagonism of the intellectual and  the  middle\r\n\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

A stage has been reached when no  power\r\n\r\non  earth can resuscitate the P.A.P. even to a  mere\r\n\r\nshadow  of its past. In Hong Lim, despite the forces\r\n\r\nat  its disposal, the vast State and party machinery\r\n\r\nat  its  command, the number of opportunists at  its\r\n\r\nbehest  and  those  who are prepared  to  abuse  the\r\n\r\nsacred slogan of \"Left-wing unity\" at the bidding of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.,  the forces of the people  delivered  a\r\n\r\ncrushing  defeat on this ignominious  alliance.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. was smashed once and for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me take you for a few minutes\r\n\r\nback  to  what happened during polling  day  at  the\r\n\r\nVictoria  Memorial Theatre, where the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwas  ready  to  march into Anson preparing  for  the\r\n\r\nAnson  by-election, I understand, with two  vans  of\r\n\r\nfirecrackers.  But the result was what  he  did  not\r\n\r\nexpect.  With  tears  in his  eyes,  he  spoke  with\r\n\r\nemotion  in  the Hong Lim Branch that  this  is  the\r\n\r\nfinish  of  the  P.A.P. and that \"We  must  resign.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore,  Sir,  here  is  a  Government  which  is\r\n\r\nprepared to go all out to beat a \"graceful\" retreat.\r\n\r\nHere  is  a Government which has through its follies\r\n\r\nand   its   serious  departure  from  its  political\r\n\r\nprinciples forfeited the moral right to govern.  How\r\n\r\ncan  a  minority Government steamroller through  its\r\n\r\nconstitutional  proposals  which  have  far-reaching\r\n\r\nconsequences not only to ourselves but also  to  the\r\n\r\nfuture?  How can such a Government, which exists  on\r\n\r\nsufferance only, justify itself in the eyes  of  the\r\n\r\nworld,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na sham referendum to give a facade of democracy with\r\n\r\nunacceptable constitutional proposals?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. is now no more, as I have said,\r\n\r\nthan  a  mere  shadow  of the past.  As  people  are\r\n\r\nsaying,  it is even difficult for them to  muster  a\r\n\r\nfew hundred to fill up the few hundred chairs in the\r\n\r\nCultural Centre. Let us recall the last open meeting\r\n\r\nthey  had,  that is, the celebration  of  The  Sixth\r\n\r\nAnniversary  of  the P.A.P. at the  Badminton  Hall,\r\n\r\nwhere  from the photos and from what I heard,  there\r\n\r\nwere about seven or eight hundred Party members  and\r\n\r\nsupporters attending the meeting. Since then we  did\r\n\r\nnot  hear of the P.A.P. having a seventh anniversary\r\n\r\ncelebration.  The eighth anniversary celebration  is\r\n\r\ncoming very soon and they are now having meetings in\r\n\r\nthe small little Cultural Centre. I am very doubtful\r\n\r\nif  they  could  even  fill the few  hundred  chairs\r\n\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after the Hong Lim Resolutions,\r\n\r\nthe  thousands  of members the P.A.P. had,  suddenly\r\n\r\ndisappeared.  The last opening meeting,  as  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  was attended by only several hundred members.\r\n\r\nWhat  was  left after the Hong Lim Resolutions  were\r\n\r\nonly Generals, Colonels, Lieutenants, Captains- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  what I deplore is that  despite  all\r\n\r\nthese  restrictions,  despite the  guillotine,  they\r\n\r\nshould still filibuster until the Opposition have no\r\n\r\nchance  to  speak.  What has happened  in  tonight's\r\n\r\ndebate  was, instead of the P.A.P. being  on  trial,\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government with the support of the S.P.A.\r\n\r\nhas  turned this Chamber into a trial of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. Mr Speaker, what I deplore is that in its\r\n\r\nlast  pangs, the P.A.P. Government, being a minority\r\n\r\nGovernment,  with  only 25 seats out  of  51,  still\r\n\r\nseeks   to  steamroller  through  its  White   Paper\r\n\r\nproposals-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Shame!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b>- very shamefully by means of ,a\r\n\r\ndishonest referendum. It is still not too late, Sir,\r\n\r\nfor  the  P.A.P. to change its mind.  We  know  that\r\n\r\ntonight  will  be the last sitting, the  last  three\r\n\r\nminutes  of  the  Third Session. The  Assembly  will\r\n\r\nprorogue  from  now onwards. Once  the  Assembly  is\r\n\r\nprorogued,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, there  will  be  more\r\n\r\npressure put on the Press, more restrictions on mass\r\n\r\nmeetings.  Instead  of twelve conditions,  we  might\r\n\r\nhave 13, 14, 15 or 16 conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, we stop at 13.

These\r\n\r\nare  all  necessary.

We are ready at any  time\r\n\r\nfrom now onwards to have a general election.
