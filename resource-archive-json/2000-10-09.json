This\r\n\r\nhas  raised global concerns about the impact on inflation and\r\n\r\neconomic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oil shocks in 1974 and 1980 triggered global\r\n\r\nslowdowns1.  However, the economic impact of the recent surge\r\n\r\nin oil prices is likely to be much less severe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, energy conservation and the shift to\r\n\r\nalternative fuels have made the global economy less dependent\r\n\r\non oil.  Since 1974, the oil consumption per unit of real GDP\r\n\r\nhas  fallen  by almost half in the US, EU and Japan,  and  by\r\n\r\nabout 30% in the rest of Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the US$10 per barrel price in January 1999 was\r\n\r\nabnormally low. The average price over the last 4  years  has\r\n\r\nbeen US$18.  Compared to this, the present price of US$33  is\r\n\r\nnot very high.  Adjusted for inflation, the present price  is\r\n\r\nonly  two-thirds (62%) of the 1974 level, and one-third (35%)\r\n\r\nof the 1980 level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies of the economic impact of high oil prices have\r\n\r\nshown  that it should be quite small.  The OECD has estimated\r\n\r\nthat  a  US$10 increase would only raise inflation by 0.4-1.1\r\n\r\npercentage  point  and lower real GDP by  0.2-0.5  percentage\r\n\r\npoint  in  the  US,  EU  and  Japan.   Similarly,  the  Asian\r\n\r\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has projected that a price of US$35  a\r\n\r\nbarrel  for a year would reduce real GDP growth in the  world\r\n\r\nby 0.2- 0.25 percentage point,\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n<br><br>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World  growth slowed from 6.9% in 1973 to 2.8% in  1974, and from 3.8% in 1979 to 2.3% in 1980.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  in  Asia by 0.4-0.5 percentage point.  The IMF has  also\r\n\r\nestimated  that  high  oil  prices  may  only  slice  0.3-0.5\r\n\r\npercentage point off its world growth forecast of  4.2%  next\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, although the surge in oil prices has\r\n\r\ncaused import prices to rise, CPI inflation has remained low.\r\n\r\nCPI  has  only increased by 1.1% in the first 8  months  this\r\n\r\nyear.  There are several reasons for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, oil and related commodities account for only 10%\r\n\r\nof the CPI basket in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, housing costs have been kept low by the weak\r\n\r\nproperty rentals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, market liberalisation measures and stronger\r\n\r\ncompetition   have  kept  inflation  low   for   items   like\r\n\r\ntelecommunications and clothing.  MTI has estimated that even\r\n\r\nif  oil  prices  stayed at US$35 for a year, Singapore's  CPI\r\n\r\ninflation  would  only be pushed up by 0.5 percentage  point,\r\n\r\nand GDP growth would be reduced by only 0.5 percentage point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect the Singapore economy to perform well for the\r\n\r\nrest  of  this  year and next, despite the high  oil  prices.\r\n\r\nHowever, the impact of oil prices will vary among industries.\r\n\r\nIndustries  which  are more dependent on  oil,  such  as  oil\r\n\r\nrefining, petrochemicals, utility and transport, will be more\r\n\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the oil refineries and petrochemicals industries,\r\n\r\nincreasing crude oil prices have raised raw material costs as\r\n\r\nwell  as  other  oil-related input costs such  as  transport,\r\n\r\nelectricity and fuel.  This has squeezed profit margins.   In\r\n\r\nthe  utility industry, the electricity tariff has had  to  be\r\n\r\nrevised  upwards  3  times this year  because  of  fuel  cost\r\n\r\nincreases.   In  transport, SBS,  TIBS  and  SMRT  have  Fuel\r\n\r\nEqualisation  Funds (FEF), which are designed to  soften  the\r\n\r\nimpact  of sharp increases in fuel prices.

There is no tax on diesel fuel or jet\r\n\r\nfuel. There is also no tax on fuel used for the generation of\r\n\r\nelectricity. The impact of customs duty on the cost of public\r\n\r\ntransportation, commercial traffic and household  electricity\r\n\r\nbills  is thus very limited. Our petrol tax is used primarily\r\n\r\nas  a traffic management tool. It amounted to $466 million in\r\n\r\nFY99.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to lower the duty on petrol or put a\r\n\r\ncap on it. For a typical 1.6 litre car in Singapore, even  at\r\n\r\npresent  prices, petrol duties paid as a percentage of  total\r\n\r\noperating  cost  of the car is only 5%. Our pump  prices  and\r\n\r\npetrol  duty  are not excessive compared with those  of  many\r\n\r\nother  countries. For example, in the UK, the price per litre\r\n\r\nof  petrol  is about S$2.22. In South Korea it is S$1.98,  in\r\n\r\nFrance  S$1.97.  In  Singapore the  average  price  is  about\r\n\r\nS$1.50. In Malaysia and Indonesia the retail prices of petrol\r\n\r\nare  lower,  but  that is because of heavy subsidies  by  the\r\n\r\ngovernments as they are oil-producing countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for petrol duty, at 40% ad valorem, Singapore's rate\r\n\r\nis  lower than all the European countries and Australia.

In fact, when crude oil prices increased by 26%  from\r\n\r\nUS$25  in December last year to US$32 in September this year,\r\n\r\naverage  pump  prices of petrol increased by only  15%,  from\r\n\r\nS$1.23 to S$1.42 per litre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not place a cap on petrol duty on previous\r\n\r\noccasions,  when oil prices rose sharply, and  were  in  real\r\n\r\nterms  much higher than today. I therefore do not see a  need\r\n\r\nto do so now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong and Mr Low have also asked the Government to\r\n\r\nconsider measures to help households cope with rising utility\r\n\r\nbills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last sitting of Parliament, Minister George Yeo\r\n\r\ngave  a  full explanation of the measures the Government  has\r\n\r\ntaken. To help lower-income households cope with the changes,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has granted them rebates  on  their  utility\r\n\r\nbills.  This  year, the rebate is $200 for 1- to  3-room  HDB\r\n\r\nflats and $100 for 4-room flats.  The amount will be credited\r\n\r\nto  their utilities accounts in mid-October this year. For 1- to  3-room HDB households, the $200 rebate is more  than  the\r\n\r\naverage  annual  increase in utility bills.  For  4-room  HDB\r\n\r\nhouseholds,  the  $100  rebate  is  about  half  the  average\r\n\r\nincrease  in  utility bills. In addition the  Government  has\r\n\r\nalso  given service and conservancy charge rebates for  these\r\n\r\nflats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These rebates help the lower income households to cope\r\n\r\nwith  price  increases. Overall, despite the higher  oil  and\r\n\r\nelectricity prices, CPI inflation will be less than  2%  this\r\n\r\nyear,  including for the lower income households.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nwhile  the  price increases are not welcome, they should  not\r\n\r\ncause significant hardship or disruption to households.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should see the current oil price levels in\r\n\r\nperspective, and should not over-react to them.  As  a  price\r\n\r\ntaker  who  imports all our oil, we cannot  shield  ourselves\r\n\r\nfrom  global  fluctuations  in  oil  prices.  Nor  should  we\r\n\r\nsubsidise the consumption of oil or electricity, not even  by\r\n\r\nlower income households. But we will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhelp  them in other ways. If the economy continues to perform\r\n\r\nwell,  in  future budgets we will again be in a  position  to\r\n\r\nconsider further rebates for lower income households.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I would like to know\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister  for Finance whether in  calculating  the\r\n\r\nrebates  on  utility  bills he would take  into  account  the\r\n\r\naverage  utility  bill size, besides the  recent  fuel  price\r\n\r\nincrease, the water conservation tax as well as the  increase\r\n\r\nin  water-borne  fee.   These add up to quite  a  substantial\r\n\r\nincrease  compared to the old charges.

As  I  understand  the\r\n\r\nMinister, the duty on petrol is to control the number of cars\r\n\r\non  the  road.  May I ask whether this has had an impact  and\r\n\r\nwhether  there has been a reduction in the number of vehicles\r\n\r\non the road as a result of the duty?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> It has a contributory effect. We\r\n\r\nhave  a package of measures to regulate the growth and  usage\r\n\r\nof  cars  in  Singapore.  The most important is  the  capital\r\n\r\ncost, which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincludes import duties, additional registration fee and  COE.\r\n\r\nSo  the capital cost of a car is substantial. As I have  said\r\n\r\nearlier,  petrol duty accounts for only 5% of  the  operating\r\n\r\ncost  of a typical 1.6 litre car.  It is therefore relatively\r\n\r\ninsignificant.  For example, a 1.6 litre Toyota  Corolla  car\r\n\r\ncould  cost  $96,000.  The capital charge would therefore  be\r\n\r\nlarge relative to the cost of petrol duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask whether if that is the\r\n\r\nposition.   Why is it not considered feasible to  reduce  the\r\n\r\npetrol tax?

The capital cost of cars  influences  the\r\n\r\nincrease in car population.

Advancing full market competition  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  because  the openness of the  telecoms  regulatory\r\n\r\nenvironment  has  become  a  key  factor  in  attracting  new\r\n\r\ninvestments.

This\r\n\r\nis  the  rationale for the accelerated liberalisation of  the\r\n\r\ntelecoms market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as a serious and responsible Government, we\r\n\r\nalso recognise our earlier commitment to SingTel and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStarHub  to  maintain a duopoly until 1st  April  2002.

We must thus be fair to both SingTel and StarHub, and\r\n\r\ncompensate  them accordingly for any potential  loss  of  net\r\n\r\nrevenue from the earlier introduction of competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure transparency and objectivity in deriving the\r\n\r\ncompensation  figures,  IDA hired a third  party  consultant,\r\n\r\nDeloitte  Consulting.  Deloitte Consulting took a  discounted\r\n\r\ncash flow approach to determine the net revenue positions  of\r\n\r\nSingTel  and StarHub, under the two scenarios of  a  two-year\r\n\r\nduopoly  and  accelerated liberalisation.  Specifically,  the\r\n\r\nanalysis is restricted to public basic telecoms services,  or\r\n\r\nPBTS,   and   excludes   other  services   such   as   mobile\r\n\r\ncommunications and Internet access services because these are\r\n\r\nalready open to full competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forecasts made by Deloitte Consulting were based upon\r\n\r\nboth  the historical growth in Singapore and in consideration\r\n\r\nof  overseas  experience based on information available  from\r\n\r\nresearch  organisations, regulators, and investment analysts.\r\n\r\nIt is with such detailed analysis that the final compensation\r\n\r\nfigures  of  $859 million for SingTel and $1,082 billion  for\r\n\r\nStarHub were derived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has accepted that these figures were\r\n\r\nderived  objectively and are fair and reasonable.

My question is, why did\r\n\r\nthe  Government, at that point in time, fail to see the  need\r\n\r\nto  liberalise the telecommunications market and allow  these\r\n\r\ntwo  companies to monopolise the market up to 2002 and,  now,\r\n\r\nsuddenly,  discovered that there is a need to liberalise  the\r\n\r\nmarket  for the benefit of the nation, and thereby  about  $2\r\n\r\nbillion  is needed to pay out from the Government's  coffers?\r\n\r\nIs  this the result of the Government failing to foresee what\r\n\r\nis happening in the future?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, it is very easy at this point\r\n\r\nin  time,  having  seen all the rapid liberalisations  taking\r\n\r\nplace around the world, to say that the decision in 1997  was\r\n\r\nperhaps  faulty.  We have to bring ourselves back  to  1995-6\r\n\r\nwhen  most of the global telecoms market was still not  fully\r\n\r\nliberalised and, therefore, setting a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntimeframe  of 2002 at that point in time was already  a  very\r\n\r\naggressive timetable.  So it is not that we did not have  the\r\n\r\nforesight.   We  knew  that there was  liberalisation  taking\r\n\r\nplace,  which was why we moved up the date for liberalisation\r\n\r\nor the introduction of competition by seven years for SingTel\r\n\r\nfrom  2007  to 2000.  But in order to attract a  new  serious\r\n\r\nplayer  into  this market of public basic telecoms  services,\r\n\r\nwhich  involves such a huge investment, companies would  want\r\n\r\nto ensure that there are certain safeguards in order to build\r\n\r\ntheir  market share before prices start collapsing  with  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of full competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> I would like to find\r\n\r\nout from the Minister whether he considers it staggering that\r\n\r\nthe  loss of monopoly over two years for the industry amounts\r\n\r\nto a net revenue of $1.9 billion.  In my mind, there are very\r\n\r\nfew industries that if they lose a monopoly for two years, it\r\n\r\nwill  come to that amount.  Would he agree that perhaps  this\r\n\r\nnumber shows that Singaporean consumers have been paying  too\r\n\r\nmuch for their fixed-line service?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the figure would appear\r\n\r\nstaggering  and, I am sure, to many people, it is staggering.\r\n\r\nBut  then, one must also consider that SingTel's profit  each\r\n\r\nyear exceeds a billion dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> That is precisely my point, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat,  as  a monopoly, SingTel's profit is outrageous.

Of course, because we are  part  of  the\r\n\r\nglobal  network  and we want to be a knowledge-based  economy\r\n\r\nand  we  also want to be a telecoms and business hub for  the\r\n\r\nregion, we have no choice but to open up the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntelecoms  market  as rapidly as possible in order  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the new investments that are being considered  for  the\r\n\r\nregion will now come to Singapore or, at least, much of those\r\n\r\ninvestments   in  the  pipeline,  will  come  to   Singapore.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  price of $2 billion, in the context  of  the\r\n\r\noverall economic development, is a small price to pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Two questions for\r\n\r\nthe Minister.\r\n\r\nThe first is that the Minister has explained the promise that\r\n\r\nwas  given of a duopoly to StarHub and the fact that StarHub,\r\n\r\nbased on this, has committed to certain investments.  But how\r\n\r\ndoes  the  logic  apply to SingTel, given  that  SingTel  was\r\n\r\nalready  first  a  monopoly,  and  has  already  made   those\r\n\r\ninvestments?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is more general, regarding\r\n\r\nduopolies.  The Government has also recently announced  plans\r\n\r\nto   basically  create  a  duopoly  of  competition  for  the\r\n\r\nnewspaper  media and television media.  Looking  forward,  is\r\n\r\nthere  a  danger that we have to liberalise this sector  more\r\n\r\nquickly  and we end up in another position where  we  end  up\r\n\r\npaying compensation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the reason for having to\r\n\r\ncompensate  SingTel  too  is  that  we  have  made  a  public\r\n\r\ncommitment that there will be a duopoly for two years,  which\r\n\r\nmeans  that  SingTel would have also gone ahead to  make  its\r\n\r\ninvestments  on  that basis.  So, therefore, the  commitment,\r\n\r\nalthough not explicit to SingTel, is an implicit one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the duopoly of newspaper and television\r\n\r\nmedia,  I  would suggest that he raise the question  with  my\r\n\r\ncolleague.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

If the\r\n\r\nMinister  is stepping back by liberalising and by emphasising\r\n\r\nself-regulation in all these public announcements, how is  it\r\n\r\ngoing to be possible for self-regulation in a market which is\r\n\r\nso dominated by one player still?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> In reply to his first question, no,\r\n\r\nStarHub  will  not be reneging on its investment  commitment.\r\n\r\nIt is still required to roll out the local network and we are\r\n\r\nin  discussion  now  with  Starhub  on  their  plan  and  the\r\n\r\nschedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the second part, that with such a dominant\r\n\r\nplayer, how can self-regulation work, there is still  a  need\r\n\r\nfor  a  regulator, which is why we have IDA.

For instance,  the\r\n\r\nturnover  of  SMEs  in the services sector has  rebounded  by\r\n\r\n12.4%  in 1999 from the decline of 7.9% in 1998.  Growth  has\r\n\r\nremained strong at 9.6% in the first half of this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the performance of SMEs is uneven and varies\r\n\r\nacross  industries.  In wholesale trade, SMEs as a group  are\r\n\r\nenjoying  buoyant  business, while in construction  and  real\r\n\r\nestate,  performance is still weak, reflecting the  different\r\n\r\npace  of  recovery  among  sectors.   Similarly,  within  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector, SMEs in fast-growing  industries  like\r\n\r\nelectronics are enjoying better business than those  in  slow\r\n\r\ngrowing ones like ship-repair and furniture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even for industries that are recovering, some SMEs\r\n\r\ncontinue to face strong competitive pressures.  SMEs are also\r\n\r\nmore  dependent on the domestic and regional markets compared\r\n\r\nto  the  MNCs.   For  instance,  in  the  food  manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustry,  feedback  from  the Singapore  Food  Manufacturers\r\n\r\nAssociation  indicates that while business  has  improved  by\r\n\r\nabout 10% after the crisis, profitability has declined.  This\r\n\r\nis due to higher operating costs and more intense competition\r\n\r\nfrom lower cost food manufacturers in neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our SMEs will have to find ways to increase efficiency\r\n\r\nand  develop  higher value products that can  command  higher\r\n\r\nprice  premiums.   Fewer and fewer of  them  can  escape  the\r\n\r\nchallenge of globalization and the New Economy.  They have to\r\n\r\nleverage   on  technology,  create  attractive   brands   and\r\n\r\npackaging,  and  actively  pursue  alternative  markets   for\r\n\r\ngrowth.

Currently, although we have some  annual\r\n\r\nand quarterly data of SMEs and local enterprises for selected\r\n\r\nsectors   like  commerce  and  services,  we  do   not   have\r\n\r\ncomprehensive indicators. This is partly due to the resources\r\n\r\nneeded to gather statistics from SMEs, which number more than\r\n\r\n100,000.    These   small   companies   also   have   greater\r\n\r\ndifficulties  than the larger firms in providing  timely  and\r\n\r\naccurate  data.  However, PSB will work with DOS and  EDB  to\r\n\r\nsee  how  more  and  better indicators can  be  developed  to\r\n\r\nmonitor  the  performance of SMEs.

As such, it has indicated that it  will  move\r\n\r\nits  hubbing  operations to PTP by the end of  the  year.  In\r\n\r\n1999,  the  shipping line accounted for about  11%  of  PSA's\r\n\r\nthroughput or 1.7 million TEUs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maersk's move to PTP is a commercial decision on its\r\n\r\npart.  Apart from being a major global shipping line,  Maersk\r\n\r\nruns many dedicated shipping terminals around the world. This\r\n\r\nmove by Maersk must, therefore, be viewed in that context. It\r\n\r\ndoes  not  reflect a lack of competitiveness on the  part  of\r\n\r\nPSA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All over the world, whenever new ports come on stream,\r\n\r\nthey  take  market  share from existing  players.   One  such\r\n\r\nexample was when the South China ports of Yantian, Shekou and\r\n\r\nChiwan  were  developed a few years ago.  However,  as  trade\r\n\r\nvolume grew, a new equilibrium was soon established, and Hong\r\n\r\nKong terminals continue to grow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With charges at about a third to a half of those for\r\n\r\r\nports in Hong Kong, Japan, Europe and the United States,  PSA\r\n\r\nremains  the world's leading port in terms of competitiveness\r\n\r\nand  the  value that it provides to its customers.  PSA  does\r\n\r\nnot compete on price alone.  It intends to retain its premier\r\n\r\nposition  through even better services and greater efficiency\r\n\r\nto  meet  the  needs of its customers.  For example,  PSA  is\r\n\r\nhelping  its customers enter the world of e-commerce, through\r\n\r\nits  Portnet system. This system enables all players  in  the\r\n\r\nglobal  shipping  community to make  paperless  and  seamless\r\n\r\nintegrated transactions with each other effortlessly, and  at\r\n\r\nthe lowest costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be a premier port, one must have superb shipping\r\n\r\nconnectivity and frequency.  PSA has, through its high levels\r\n\r\nof  efficiency  and  service, built  an  unrivalled  shipping\r\n\r\nnetwork   of  120  container  shipping  lines  that  connects\r\n\r\nSingapore  to over 500 ports.  This has enabled PSA  to  move\r\n\r\n15.9  million TEUs last year.  For this year, it  expects  to\r\n\r\nmove  over 17 million TEUs. Many of the major shipping  lines\r\n\r\nare  increasing their throughput through PSA by  double-digit\r\n\r\ngrowth.   This is a strong reaffirmation in PSA's  value-for-money services by its customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its part, the Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) has\r\n\r\nadopted  various  measures to enhance the competitiveness  of\r\n\r\nthe  Port of Singapore over the years. Since May 1996, it has\r\n\r\ngranted  concessions of 20% on port dues for container  ships\r\n\r\nusing  our  port.   It  has also fully deregulated  tug  boat\r\n\r\nservices within our port waters, to give shipping lines  more\r\n\r\nchoices that offer more competitive rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPA has developed electronic services such as the\r\n\r\nMARINET and the Singapore Maritime Portal to speed up various\r\n\r\nstatutory  clearance  processes.   Combined  with  a   strong\r\n\r\ncommitment  to high standards, these and other measures  have\r\n\r\nhelped to ensure that the Port of Singapore is able to  offer\r\n\r\ncost-competitive services of the highest quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPA is also working closely with other relevant\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies such as TDB and MAS to develop  Singapore\r\n\r\ninto  an International Maritime Centre (IMC).  These agencies\r\n\r\nwork  in  close consultation with the shipping  community  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  our expertise and build up our critical market  mass\r\n\r\nin  the  areas of ship financing, marine insurance,  maritime\r\n\r\narbitration, ship management and repairing, and shipbuilding.\r\n\r\nThe agencies will continually assess, evaluate and re-examine\r\n\r\nour  policies  to align them to the emerging industry  trends\r\n\r\nand ensure that we remain competitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

I believe PSA has  been\r\n\r\nin  close  contact  with all the shipping  lines  and  it  is\r\n\r\ndedicated  and committed to giving cost competitive services,\r\n\r\nnot  just in terms of the charges for lifting the containers,\r\n\r\nbut  also through the provision of other value added services\r\n\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to PSA taking a stake in PTP, I think\r\n\r\nthis  is an issue for PSA to decide upon, and I believe  this\r\n\r\nissue has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow been settled by Maersk taking up a 30% stake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, I think the Minister\r\n\r\nis  aware  that  the Tanjung Pelepas Port won a  major  award\r\n\r\nrecently  at  some international shipping conference  as  the\r\n\r\nmost  improved port.  Coupled with the fact that it is  going\r\n\r\nto  be  managed  by  Maersk Lines, I would say  that  Tanjung\r\n\r\nPelepas will, in fact, pose very serious competition  to  the\r\n\r\nPort of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this move by Maersk Line, the volume of the port\r\n\r\nseems  to  be substantially affected.  Will this  affect  the\r\n\r\ntime table for the initial public offer of PSA?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, with regard to strong\r\n\r\ncompetition posed by PTP, PSA is used to competition, because\r\n\r\nthere are already many well-established ports such as in Hong\r\n\r\nKong  and in the region which PSA has to compete against  for\r\n\r\ntranshipment business.  Much of the business that PSA handles\r\n\r\nare  transhipment  containers, and they do  not  need  to  be\r\n\r\ntranshipped  in  Singapore.  They can be transhipped  at  any\r\n\r\nport   along   the  route  taken  by  the  container   lines.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  PSA  is quite used to competition  and  with  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of PTP and with the involvement of Maersk in PTP,\r\n\r\nI am sure PSA will now be even more attentive to competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the date for the flotation of PSA, I\r\n\r\nthink  this  is an issue which Temasek Holdings has  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith, and that comes under the Ministry of Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>OPPOSITION MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Disallowing of speech-making at constituency dinner)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Home\r\n\r\nAffairs why an opposition Member of Parliament is not allowed\r\n\r\nto  make a speech at a dinner organised by his party, held at\r\n\r\nhis constituency, when the Government is promoting freedom of\r\n\r\nspeech by opening a Speakers' Corner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

If it is an MP who organises\r\n\r\nthe  event for his residents, Police will look at what is the\r\n\r\ncontext of the event.

If these criteria are satisfied,  I\r\n\r\nwill expect the Police to say \"go ahead\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Another clarification, Sir. This\r\n\r\nquestion is specifically asked when a dinner is organised  by\r\n\r\na  political party.  Will the MP be allowed or not allowed to\r\n\r\nspeak?   The  answer,  as I get it, is still  no.   So,  what\r\n\r\ndifference  does  it  make?  There is no  relaxation  of  the\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough  the event is organised by a political party,  there\r\n\r\nis participation by the constituents of my ward.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill strings together a number of minor, and\r\n\r\nmainly  technical amendments to several Acts.  The amendments\r\n\r\ncan be grouped into several categories which I will deal with\r\n\r\nin turn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Repeal of obsolete Acts</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first set of amendments repeals a number of obsolete\r\n\r\nActs.   In 1999, the Attorney-General established a Committee\r\n\r\nto  review  outdated Acts with a view to repealing or,  where\r\n\r\nappropriate, updating and re-enacting them.  As a  result  of\r\n\r\nthe  work  of the committee, Clause 13 of the Bill  seeks  to\r\n\r\nrepeal :\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the Land Officers Powers Act;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the Preservation of the Peace Act;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the Prevention of Crimes Act; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the Tin and Tin-Ore (Disclosure of Smeltor's\r\n\r\nStocks) Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Officers Powers Act was enacted in 1926 to\r\n\r\nremove  doubts  as to the powers and duties of land  officers\r\n\r\nunder  various  statutes existing at the time  because  these\r\n\r\nland  officers  were  referred to by different  titles  under\r\n\r\ndifferent  statutes.   As the relevant legislation  have  all\r\n\r\nbeen  modernised,  no  such doubts  exist  today.   The  Land\r\n\r\nOfficers Powers Act is therefore no longer needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Preservation of the Peace Act was enacted in 1872.\r\n\r\nIt  allows the Government, by proclamation, to vest  Justices\r\n\r\nof Peace with certain emergency powers to preserve the peace.\r\n\r\nThis  is no longer necessary as sufficient provision has been\r\n\r\nmade   in   other   legislation   like   the   Public   Order\r\n\r\n(Preservation) Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prevention of Crimes Act was enacted in 1939. Some\r\n\r\nof  its provisions are either obsolete or no longer consonant\r\n\r\nwith  modern  penal laws, while other provisions are  largely\r\n\r\nduplicative of provisions existing in other laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tin and Tin-Ore (Disclosure of Smeltor's Stocks) Act\r\n\r\nis obsolete as there are no more smelters in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendment of Interpretation Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next set of amendments concerns the Interpretation\r\n\r\nAct.    These  amendments  were  proposed  by  the  Attorney-General's Chambers to facilitate legislative drafting, mainly\r\n\r\nby  including  standard  provisions  for  certain  frequently\r\n\r\noccurring  matters.  For example, Clause 2(3)  provides  that\r\n\r\nwhere  a  written  law is to come into  operation  on  a  day\r\n\r\nspecified  by  notification,  the  notification  may  specify\r\n\r\ndifferent days for different provisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another situation is where provisions in Acts of\r\n\r\nParliament contain examples and illustrations to show how the\r\n\r\nprovisions  are  intended  to work.   A  new  section  7A  is\r\n\r\ninserted into the Interpretation Act to make clear that these\r\n\r\nexamples are not meant to be exhaustive, and are not intended\r\n\r\nto override the operative words of the provision.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendments to Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and compensation) Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 amends the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks\r\n\r\nand  Compensation) Act for the better administration of  that\r\n\r\nAct.   Under this Act, the Public Trustee is tasked to  watch\r\n\r\nover  the interest of persons making claims against motorists\r\n\r\nand their insurers for personal injuries arising from traffic\r\n\r\naccidents.   Section 6 of the Act requires  all  payments  of\r\n\r\ncompensation exceeding $5,000 to be made through  the  Public\r\n\r\nTrustee.   If  the Public Trustee considers the  compensation\r\n\r\npayment  to  be  inadequate, he can require  the  parties  to\r\n\r\nsubmit the case to the courts for scrutiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act protects the interest of claimants by requiring\r\n\r\nlawyers acting on behalf of claimants to submit their charges\r\n\r\nto  the  courts  for scrutiny.  This is to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nlawyers' charges are fair and reasonable.  The Bill makes two\r\n\r\nadjustments to this system.  First, the Bill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmakes  it unnecessary for a lawyer to submit his charges  for\r\n\r\nscrutiny by the courts if the Public Trustee agrees with  the\r\n\r\ncharges.   This will result in savings in time and  resources\r\n\r\nfor  the  courts and the lawyers involved.  Second, the  Bill\r\n\r\nallows  the Public Trustee to decide what charges the  lawyer\r\n\r\nshould  claim if the lawyer fails to submit his  charges  for\r\n\r\ncourt  scrutiny  within three months after  the  compensation\r\n\r\namount has been approved by the Public Trustee or fixed by  a\r\n\r\ncourt.  Delay by a lawyer in submitting his charges for court\r\n\r\nscrutiny  means delay in the payment of compensation  to  his\r\n\r\nclient.  This is unfair to the client.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also empowers the Public Trustee to appear and\r\n\r\nargue in any court case involving a claim of compensation for\r\n\r\npersonal  injury  arising from traffic accident.   This  will\r\n\r\ngive the Public Trustee greater flexibility in fulfilling his\r\n\r\nrole  of  protecting the interests of persons  claiming  such\r\n\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other Miscellaneous Amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wrap up, I will take the House briefly through the\r\n\r\nremaining key provisions of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends the Legal Profession Act for two\r\n\r\npurposes.   The  first is to provide that foreign  joint  law\r\n\r\nventures  which are incorporated companies will  be  exempted\r\n\r\nfrom the requirement to carry the words \"limited\" or \"private\r\n\r\nlimited\" in their names.  This is a privilege which local law\r\n\r\ncorporations  currently  enjoy.  The  second  purpose  is  to\r\n\r\nenable  rules  to  be  made  for the  registration  with  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General of all foreign lawyers practising in foreign\r\n\r\nlaw  firms, Singapore law firms and joint law ventures.  This\r\n\r\nis  to  widen  the existing provision which is restricted  to\r\n\r\nforeign  lawyers  resident in Singapore and practising  in  a\r\n\r\nforeign law firm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends the Medical Registration Act to allow a\r\n\r\nMagistrate's Court or a District Court to mete out  the  full\r\n\r\npenalties for offences under the Act.

Achievement levels are high, and\r\n\r\nour  education  system  enjoys a well-deserved  international\r\n\r\nhigh  reputation,  especially  in  Mathematics,  Science  and\r\n\r\nInformation Technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the future, the role our schools play will become\r\n\r\neven  more  critical,  in  providing  Singaporeans  with  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  foundation  to become knowledge  workers,  and  in\r\n\r\nimbuing our young with a robust sense of national identity in\r\n\r\nthe face of globalisation and rapid change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore is a small country with limited resources,\r\n\r\nwe  need to ensure that children who would otherwise miss out\r\n\r\non  the  full  benefits of an education in national  schools,\r\n\r\nwill  have the opportunity to get the education they need  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  to  their fullest potential, and be  ready  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture.   The  introduction of Compulsory  Education  in  our\r\n\r\nnational schools signals this intent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory Education will help assure that our children\r\n\r\nhave  firstly,  the necessary common core  of  knowledge  and\r\n\r\nstrong  foundation  for further education,  and  secondly,  a\r\n\r\ncommon educational experience to build national cohesion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Re-cap of CE recommendations</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duration and form of Compulsory Education, proposed\r\n\r\nby  the Committee on Compulsory Education chaired by Dr Aline\r\n\r\nWong, and accepted by the Government, balances these two  key\r\n\r\nobjectives  with the views and aspirations of  the  different\r\n\r\ncommunities in Singapore.  The recommendations also re-affirm\r\n\r\nthe appropriate balance in responsibilities of the family and\r\n\r\nof  the  State  for  a child's education, while  taking  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  practical problems in  terms  of  enforcement.\r\n\r\nPermit  me to briefly go over the key recommendations of  the\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory Education up to primary 6 is recommended,\r\n\r\neven  though  10 years of general education would  be  ideal.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a pragmatic compromise given the practicalities  of\r\n\r\nintroducing   and   enforcing  Compulsory  Education   during\r\n\r\nsecondary  education.  Compulsory Education should  therefore\r\n\r\nbe   seen  as  the  minimum  period  of  education  for   all\r\n\r\nSingaporean children, and not the ideal duration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory Education will need strong support from the\r\n\r\nvarious  communities to be successful.   The  form  in  which\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education is implemented should therefore give due\r\n\r\nconsideration to how the aspirations and needs of the various\r\n\r\ncommunities  can be taken into account in the  implementation\r\n\r\nof  Compulsory Education.  Hence we have provided for certain\r\n\r\ngroups  to  be exempted from Compulsory Education subject  to\r\n\r\ncertain  conditions.  These are children attending designated\r\n\r\ninstitutions  which  have  a long historical  record  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety,  like madrasahs and San Yu Adventist School.   Home-schoolers are exempted.  Children with special needs are also\r\n\r\nexempted  as  their needs are catered for in accordance  with\r\n\r\ntheir specific requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some children will be given exemption from\r\n\r\nCompulsory   Education  in  national   schools   to   receive\r\n\r\nalternative forms of education, we are putting in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplace  mechanisms  to  ensure that we can  try  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nobjectives  of  Compulsory Education as best as  practicable,\r\n\r\nlike  prescribing a minimum standard to be  attained  in  the\r\n\r\nPSLE.   All children who are given exemption to attend  full-time  madrasahs,  San Yu Adventist School and  home-schooling\r\n\r\nwill be required to sit for the PSLE with their cohort.  Each\r\n\r\nof  these  institutions  must meet stipulated  benchmarks  in\r\n\r\norder   to  be  allowed  to  admit  children  exempted   from\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education, and parents of home-schoolers  need  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy the Ministry of Education that the two key objectives\r\n\r\nof  Compulsory  Education can be achieved for their  children\r\n\r\nbefore they are granted exemption from Compulsory Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for children with learning disabilities, some are\r\n\r\nalready  admitted to mainstream schools if that is  the  best\r\n\r\nfor  them.   But  others are much more able to develop  their\r\n\r\nfull potential if they attend special education schools where\r\n\r\nthey  can learn at their own pace.  There they are taught  by\r\n\r\nspecially  trained  teachers who are  assisted  by  medically\r\n\r\ntrained  personnel and support staff, with a  curriculum  and\r\n\r\nenvironment specially tailored to their needs.  Children with\r\n\r\nspecial  needs  are  therefore  automatically  exempted  from\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the introduction of Compulsory Education,\r\n\r\nparents will still be responsible for ensuring their children\r\n\r\nattend  school  regularly.  The family and  community  should\r\n\r\nplay  an  active role in convincing and helping parents  send\r\n\r\ntheir  children to school before the State steps in to compel\r\n\r\nthem to do so.  This is consistent with the principle of self-reliance and sense of parental responsibility which undergird\r\n\r\nthe  family as the basic unit of society.  At the same  time,\r\n\r\npenalties,  in the form of fines and in the extreme  case,  a\r\n\r\njail  term, will be provided under the law to allow effective\r\n\r\nenforcement   of   Compulsory   Education   and   to    deter\r\n\r\nirresponsible parents.  However, penalties will  need  to  be\r\n\r\nmeted  out  judiciously to ensure that they are  not  to  the\r\n\r\ndetriment of the long term interest of the children and their\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>CE Bill</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Compulsory Education Bill will provide the necessary\r\n\r\nframework for implementing Compulsory Education.  It sets out\r\n\r\nthe  key  definitions, gives powers to the Minister  and  the\r\n\r\nDirector-General  of  Education (DGE) to  enforce  Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation,  and lays down penalties.  It will give regulatory\r\n\r\neffect  to  the key objectives of Compulsory Education  while\r\n\r\noperational  details  are regulated by administrative  means.\r\n\r\nIn  this  way, the Ministry can better respond to changes  in\r\n\r\nenvironment  and circumstances.  Whatever can be  facilitated\r\n\r\nby  administrative  measures and regulations  have  not  been\r\n\r\nduplicated in the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permit me to highlight the key clauses of the Bill:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Clause 3 sets out the definition of Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation.   Every Singapore citizen born after  1st  January\r\n\r\n1996,  residing  in  Singapore and of  school  going  age  is\r\n\r\nrequired to attend a national primary school regularly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Clause 4 makes provision for exemption from\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education.  The conditions for granting  exemption\r\n\r\nwill be spelt out in the subsidiary legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Clauses 5 and 6 provide for the establishment of\r\n\r\nthe  Compulsory Education Board, and defines the  duties  and\r\n\r\npowers of the Board to investigate cases of non-compliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Clause 7 prescribes the penalties for non-compliance with Compulsory Education.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker Sir, the recommendations of the Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation  Committee  represent  a  considered  and  balanced\r\n\r\nresponse to the demands of the new knowledge-based world.  To\r\n\r\nsucceed in the future, we will need Singaporeans to have  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  educational  foundations  to  undertake   lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning; and a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkeen sense of what it means to be a Singaporean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory Education, by providing a common core of\r\n\r\nknowledge  and a common educational experience,  is  a  first\r\n\r\nstep  for  all communities to move forward together into  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  Compulsory Education can only succeed in meeting its\r\n\r\nobjectives  with  the strong commitment of  parents  and  the\r\n\r\nvarious  communities.  I therefore urge Members of Parliament\r\n\r\nand  community leaders to encourage all Singaporeans to  give\r\n\r\ntheir  full support to making Compulsory Education a success,\r\n\r\nand  help  give all our children the best possible  start  in\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is stating the\r\n\r\nobvious to say that education would allow a person to develop\r\n\r\nhis inherent capability and fulfill his full potential as  an\r\n\r\nindividual.  It is through education that children from  poor\r\n\r\nfamilies  could  move  up the social ladder  and  escape  the\r\n\r\npoverty  trap.   In so doing, the able and the diligent  lift\r\n\r\ntheir  families  out of poverty along with them  and  prevent\r\n\r\nsocial stratification.  We, as a people, are passionate about\r\n\r\nour children having the best possible education.  And many of\r\n\r\nus  in this House have benefited from the education policy of\r\n\r\nthis  Government and are in full support of the  Government's\r\n\r\neducation  programme.   This is reflected  in  MOE's  budget,\r\n\r\nwhich   is  the  second  largest  in  our  annual  Government\r\n\r\nexpenditure, standing at 3.7% of our GDP.  As a result of our\r\n\r\nsteadfast effort, 97% of our cohort are enrolled in Primary 1\r\n\r\nof our national schools.  59% have achieved at least five \"O\"\r\n\r\nLevel   passes  and  about  60%  are  enrolled  in   tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions  such as the polytechnics and the  universities.\r\n\r\nAll   these   we  have  achieved  without  making   education\r\n\r\ncompulsory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current education policy, as the Minister of State\r\n\r\nstated  earlier,  has  served  us  well.   So,  why  are   we\r\n\r\nintroducing  Compulsory  Education  now  -  35  years   after\r\n\r\nindependence?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to go through the history of\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education elsewhere.  History shows that countries\r\n\r\nwith  Compulsory Education can be grouped into basically  two\r\n\r\ncategories.  In the first category are western countries that\r\n\r\nintroduced  Compulsory Education in the late 1880s  or  early\r\n\r\n1900s as education of the common person had become recognised\r\n\r\nas  the cornerstone of democracy.  The State of Massachusetts\r\n\r\nin  the  United  States  was the first  to  enact  compulsory\r\n\r\neducation attendance laws way back in 1852.  By 1918, all the\r\n\r\nstates  in  the  US  had  laws on Compulsory  Education.   In\r\n\r\nEngland  and  Wales, Compulsory Education was  introduced  in\r\n\r\n1880,   close  to  120  years  ago.   Over  time,  Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation  spread  throughout the western  countries  as  one\r\n\r\ncountry  after  another implemented CE.  By  the  1920s,  the\r\n\r\nconcept  that every child has a right to education was  fully\r\n\r\nimplemented in the western countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has strong influence on emerging countries. These\r\n\r\ncountries  too  aspire to implement Compulsory  Education  as\r\n\r\npart  of  their nation-building process.  These are countries\r\n\r\nin the second group.  Their founding fathers set out to build\r\n\r\nnew  societies  out of the old.  They saw  education  as  the\r\n\r\nmeans  for  their population to bootstrap themselves  out  of\r\n\r\npoverty.   Let  us look at a few countries in  Asia.   Taiwan\r\n\r\nintroduced Compulsory Education for primary schools  in  1945\r\n\r\nafter  the  Second World War.  By 1951, six years  after  the\r\n\r\nenactment,  the enrolment rate in their primary  schools  was\r\n\r\nonly  81.5%.  Nonetheless, by 1968, when Compulsory Education\r\n\r\nwas  extended  to nine years, their enrolment rate  stood  at\r\n\r\n97.7%.   India's 1949 Independence constitution provided  for\r\n\r\nCompulsory  Education.  However, compulsion to-date  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen   enforced   due   to   socio-economic   and   political\r\n\r\nconsiderations.  Hong Kong introduced Compulsory Education in\r\n\r\n1971.   Indonesia made primary education compulsory  in  1987\r\n\r\nand  extended  it  to  nine years in  1993.   Thus,  emerging\r\n\r\ncountries tend to introduce Compulsory Education early in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  nationhood.   They primarily  use  it  to  enshrine  a\r\n\r\ncertain set of principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second objective is to use it as a political\r\n\r\nplatform  to bring education to all their children, those  in\r\n\r\nthe  cities as well as those in the countryside.  It was also\r\n\r\ncommon to implement Compulsory Education for six years in the\r\n\r\nfirst instance and then later extend the duration to a longer\r\n\r\nperiod such as nine years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, by now almost all nations or self-governing territories in the world have implemented\r\n\r\nCompulsory  Education.  The 1998 UNESCO Statistical  Yearbook\r\n\r\non  National  Education System yields some  interesting  data\r\n\r\nabout  the  universality  of Compulsory  Education.   In  the\r\n\r\nAfrica   region,   50  out  of  56  nations  or   territories\r\n\r\nimplemented  Compulsory  Education.   In  North  America,  35\r\n\r\ncountries out of 35 did so.  In South America, 14 out of  14.\r\n\r\nIn  Europe,  40  out of 42.  The standouts  are  Andorra  and\r\n\r\nLatvia.   In Asia, only 37 out of 50.  In the Oceania region,\r\n\r\n16  out  of  19.   In the ASEAN region, Indonesia,  Thailand,\r\n\r\nPhilippines,  Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos,  Myanmar,  and  Brunei\r\n\r\nDarussalam  have  Compulsory Education laws  on  their  book.\r\n\r\nOnly Singapore and Malaysia do not.  We are in the company of\r\n\r\nBhutan, East Timor, Lebanon, Maldives, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar,\r\n\r\nSaudi Arabia, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.  On paper, Sir, at\r\n\r\nleast,  it is indeed an anomaly that Singapore, a progressive\r\n\r\ncountry, does not make education compulsory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of duration, Compulsory Education duration\r\n\r\nranges from as low as five years in Iran, Turkey, Bangladesh,\r\n\r\nNepal,  Myanmar  and  Vietnam, to 12  years  in  Belgium  and\r\n\r\nGermany,  with the Netherlands as high as 13  years.   It  is\r\n\r\nnine  years in Japan, 10 years in the US and 11 years in  the\r\n\r\nUK.   There  is  only  one  small territory  in  Africa  that\r\n\r\nimplemented a Compulsory Education of four years.  Nine or 10\r\n\r\nyears seem to be the duration of choice for most countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have chosen to make primary\r\n\r\neducation compulsory when practically all our children are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalready  enrolled in schools of one sort or  another,  if  we\r\n\r\ninclude private schools and religious schools.  In fact,  90%\r\n\r\nof our children are already in the national schools.  At this\r\n\r\npoint  in time, our education system is more focused  on  the\r\n\r\nquality of education to enhance creativity and originality in\r\n\r\nour  children  in response to the changing world  instead  of\r\n\r\nfocusing on the number of children being enrolled in  primary\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, based on past events in this House, it would appear\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government was galvanised into  action  after  NMP\r\n\r\nClaire  Chiang raised an Oral Question on 4th August 1999  on\r\n\r\nthe  topic  \"Children  Not Registering for  Primary  School\".\r\n\r\nWhen  she declared that \"one child not in school is  one  too\r\n\r\nmany\",  it  did strike a chord in many of us in  this  House.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister,  responding  at  that  point,  reiterated  the\r\n\r\nargument that since we have already passed the stage where we\r\n\r\nneed  to  make  education compulsory, there is actually  very\r\n\r\nlittle  need  to  do so.  Therefore, when the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\naddressed the House on 13th October 1999 proposing  that  MOE\r\n\r\nconsider the introduction of Compulsory Education of a 4-year\r\n\r\nperiod, the impression in the public mind is that NMP  Claire\r\n\r\nChiang had won the argument against a long-standing policy of\r\n\r\nMOE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, that impression would not have given\r\n\r\ncredit  to other Members of Parliament, past or current,  who\r\n\r\nhave  spoken on this subject because the call for  Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation  in this House was not new.  I looked  through  the\r\n\r\nHansard,  Sir,  and  it shows that Mr  Tang  See  Chim  first\r\n\r\nbrought up the subject in December 1966.  Mr Goh Chee Wee and\r\n\r\nMr Liew Kok Pun raised the issue in March 1982 in the context\r\n\r\nof  reducing  school dropout rate.  Compulsory Education  has\r\n\r\nbeen a favourite topic of Mr Chiam See Tong who raised it  in\r\n\r\nno  fewer  than seven occasions from 1989 till 1999,  and  Mr\r\n\r\nChiam will be speaking after me as well.  NMP Kanwaljit  Soin\r\n\r\nbrought up the subject in February 1993 and again in December\r\n\r\n1993.  Mr Lew Syn Pau raised the same topic in March 1994.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could only conjecture as to why we did not implement\r\n\r\nCompulsory  Education  in  the  early  years  of  our  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding.  Perhaps, Singapore being a multi-racial and multi-religious  society, Compulsory Education would  be  perceived\r\n\r\ndifferently   by  the  various  communities.   Instead,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had chosen to make education as widely  available\r\n\r\nto our children as possible without making it compulsory.  In\r\n\r\nretrospect, this would appear to be a wise decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, there were strong reactions by the\r\n\r\nvarious   interested  parties,  in  particular,  the   Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity,  regarding the future of the madrasahs  after  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's suggestion on 13th October 1999.   Some  of\r\n\r\nthese  reactions were rather emotional ones, with the extreme\r\n\r\nones even expressing doubt regarding the Government's intent.\r\n\r\nThe  community  was  only reassured when the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\npersonally  met  with  the  representatives  of  the   Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the past ministerial statements on this subject, we\r\n\r\ncan  also deduce that the Government was preoccupied with the\r\n\r\nproblems   of   enforcement  when  it  comes  to   Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation.    This  might  be  true,  because   while   other\r\n\r\ngovernments  might  be  comfortable  about  not  having  100%\r\n\r\ncompliance,   this   Government  would   have   wanted   100%\r\n\r\ncompliance.  Yet, we are aware that in most cases, penalising\r\n\r\nparents  for  not sending their children might  make  matters\r\n\r\nworse  for  the  families.  When a  child  is  not  attending\r\n\r\nschool,  the  root  cause is traceable to the  family,  often\r\n\r\ntimes broken families and dysfunctional families.  These  are\r\n\r\nnot  situations  or  problems that can be resolved  with  the\r\n\r\nstroke of a pen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, Sir, we recognise that a child not given\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity  to  blossom to  his  full  potential  is  a\r\n\r\nterrible  waste.   At  a time when our birth  rate  is  below\r\n\r\nreplacement  level,  this  becomes  an  inexcusable  and   an\r\n\r\nintolerable  waste.  In proposing Compulsory  Education,  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  has  decided  that  it  was  time  for   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  make  an affirmation that  every  Singaporean\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaking   education  of  a  child  compulsory   elevates   the\r\n\r\nvisibility of this commitment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, once the Government decided that\r\n\r\nSingapore  should have a Compulsory Education Act,  it  is  a\r\n\r\nlogical  step to define what Compulsory Education  means  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.    This  task  was  entrusted  to  the  Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation  Committee  set  up  in  December  1999  under  the\r\n\r\nchairmanship of Dr Aline Wong, Senior Minister of  State  for\r\n\r\nEducation.  I was the Vice-Chairman of the Committee.   After\r\n\r\nexamining  the  role  of education in a  young  country  like\r\n\r\nSingapore, the Compulsory Education Committee reaffirmed  the\r\n\r\ntwo objectives of the National Schools system:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to give our children a foundation for life-long\r\n\r\nlearning in the preparation for the knowledge-based economy;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to give the children a common educational\r\n\r\nexperience to enhance national identity and social cohesion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two principles are still the basis of this\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is useful to reiterate that, even after the enactment\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill, the responsibility of the upbringing  of  the\r\n\r\nchild  still rests primarily with the parents.  This  is  the\r\n\r\nright  approach as our parents have been very  serious  about\r\n\r\nthe future of our children.  In fact, the main reason why the\r\n\r\nSingapore   education   system  is   stressful   and   highly\r\n\r\ncompetitive is the strong emphasis on education placed by our\r\n\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me now to elaborate upon some of\r\n\r\nthe  deliberations  of  the  Compulsory  Education  Committee\r\n\r\nleading  to  its  recommendations.   The  Feedback  Unit  has\r\n\r\nreported that the majority of respondents polled by the  Unit\r\n\r\nfelt  that  four years of Compulsory Education is too  short.\r\n\r\nMany  felt  that six years is the minimum, with 10 years  the\r\n\r\nideal.   This view is also reflected by the Minister  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech.  Several members\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  Committee felt that to truly meet the  objective  of\r\n\r\npreparing  our children for the knowledge-based economy,  the\r\n\r\nminimum  requirement  is  10 years of  Compulsory  Education.\r\n\r\nAfter extensive deliberation, the Committee finally agreed to\r\n\r\nconfine  Compulsory  Education to primary  education  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  instance.  This is so because it is more important  to\r\n\r\nget  every Singaporean, every community, to accept Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation  at  this juncture than to aim  for  the  ideal  of\r\n\r\nCompulsory  Education at the first go.  If need be,  the  Act\r\n\r\ncould  be amended in future to provide for another four years\r\n\r\nof secondary education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as expected, some members of the Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  are concerned that Compulsory Education  would  or\r\n\r\ncould  legislate the madrasahs out of existence.  This is  of\r\n\r\ncourse  not the intent of Compulsory Education.   It is  also\r\n\r\nvery  positive  that  the  community itself  understands  the\r\n\r\nchallenges  of  the future and is prepared to deal  with  the\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, the madrasahs' curriculum is geared towards\r\n\r\nthe  training  of religious teachers and leaders.   Yet,  for\r\n\r\nthose  who  do  not take up religious vocation as  a  career,\r\n\r\nthese young people trained in madrasahs are not well prepared\r\n\r\nfor  the KBE.  I would like to quote some recent studies that\r\n\r\nhave shown that in the knowledge-based economy, the wage  gap\r\n\r\nincreases  as  jobs  go upscale in skills  and  training.   A\r\n\r\nrecent  study  by a Stanford professor using real  life  data\r\n\r\nfrom  a  US  corporation  proved this conclusively  [Stanford\r\n\r\nBusiness School Social Scientist Roberto Fernandez].  As  the\r\n\r\nstudy  surveyed working adult Americans, it showed  that  the\r\n\r\ncorrelation between race and income was very strong  as  jobs\r\n\r\nmove   upscale.  As  the  corporation  turned  towards   high\r\n\r\ntechnology,  white workers with higher wages  were  hired  to\r\n\r\nreplace  African American workers with lower  wages.   So  it\r\n\r\nseems  that  the  digital divide not  only  increases  income\r\n\r\ndisparity between the skilled and unskilled, but also  widens\r\n\r\nthe  chasm  between  racial  groups  of  different  aptitudes\r\n\r\ntowards technology.  It would be a tragedy for this to happen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  This we must avoid at all costs.   The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  had  done  a  great  job,  convincing  the   Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  to accept Compulsory Education for their children,\r\n\r\nwhile making special provision for the needs of the community\r\n\r\nfor religious teachers and leaders.  The madrasahs themselves\r\n\r\nhave voluntarily set a PSLE benchmark for all madrasah pupils\r\n\r\nto  aim  for  after the Compulsory Education Act  comes  into\r\n\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the pupils in the madrasahs, the Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation  Committee has recommended exemption for two  other\r\n\r\ngroups  of  children,  namely, children attending  designated\r\n\r\nprivate schools and children who are being tutored at home by\r\n\r\nthe  parents. The Minister has indicated that he has accepted\r\n\r\nthese recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why did the Committee recommend that home schooling\r\n\r\nbe exempted from Compulsory Education?  Since there is only a\r\n\r\nvery  small  number of children every year being  tutored  at\r\n\r\nhome,  the  question  could be asked  as  to  why  a  special\r\n\r\nprovision  should  be created just for  these  children.   In\r\n\r\nfact, several members of the Committee felt that no exemption\r\n\r\nfor  home  schooling should be made.  Firstly, parents  could\r\n\r\nmake  use  of this provision as a loophole to circumvent  the\r\n\r\nAct. Secondly, unlike the educational institutes such as  the\r\n\r\nmadrasah  and  the  San Yu Adventist School  whose  exemption\r\n\r\ncould  be  revoked if they fail to meet the  PSLE  benchmark,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no such recourse when it comes to home  schooling.\r\n\r\nThese  are  very  strong  arguments.   However,  I  have  the\r\n\r\nprivilege as a member of the Feedback Unit to have met a  few\r\n\r\nparents  who  are  tutoring their children  at  home.  I  can\r\n\r\nreassure  the  House that these are dedicated  and  committed\r\n\r\nparents. A few of them are former school teachers themselves.\r\n\r\nIn  almost all cases, one of the parents will give up his  or\r\n\r\nher full-time job so as to stay home to tutor the child.   If\r\n\r\nwe  truly  believe that education is primarily  the  parent's\r\n\r\nresponsibility, these parents are the exemplars of dedication\r\n\r\nand  commitment.  To forbid home schooling will be sending  a\r\n\r\nwrong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmessage.  Therefore,  I  support  the  exemption  for   home-schooling   from  Compulsory  Education.    I   believe   the\r\n\r\nsafeguards  and  the guidelines contained in  the  Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation Committee's Report to monitor the progress of these\r\n\r\nchildren  would be sufficient to prevent home-schooling  from\r\n\r\nbecoming a loophole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also advocates who would like Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation  to  address  the issues of  handicapped  children,\r\n\r\nincluding  their  call to integrate these children  into  our\r\n\r\nnational  schools.  They would like all children to  grow  up\r\n\r\nand attend school together, instead of being segregated today\r\n\r\ninto  special  needs  schools. The objective  is  to  promote\r\n\r\nawareness  and compassion of our children of the  handicapped\r\n\r\nand  the  less able from a very young age.   Sir,  since  our\r\n\r\neducation  system is an ability-based system,  with  children\r\n\r\nwith  different  learning  abilities  streamed  to  different\r\n\r\nstreams, this idea would have required a complete overhaul of\r\n\r\nour  education system.  The Committee feels that the  current\r\n\r\napproach  involving the voluntary welfare organisations  with\r\n\r\nregard  to children with special needs is the right  approach\r\n\r\nand we recommend that this be retained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 7 of the Bill contains provision on penalty\r\n\r\nfor recalcitrant parents.  Most members of the Committee feel\r\n\r\nthat  penalty  should  only  be imposed  as  a  last  resort.\r\n\r\nCounselling  instead  is  a  preferred  approach.   In   this\r\n\r\nrespect,  I am glad to note that this Bill provides  for  the\r\n\r\nestablishment of a Board of Compulsory Education.  The duties\r\n\r\nand  powers of the Board are given in clause 6 of  the  Bill.\r\n\r\nIt  is  appropriate that no person should be charged for  any\r\n\r\noffence  under  this  Bill except on  a  complaint  from  the\r\n\r\nDirector-General of Education.  When the Board of  Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation   has   exhausted  their  avenue  to   persuade   a\r\n\r\nrecalcitrant  parent,  it would recommend  to  the  Director-General  of Education to bring the parents to court.   Unlike\r\n\r\nother  laws,  for instance, the Maintenance of  Parents  Act,\r\n\r\nother interested parties cannot bring the parents to court on\r\n\r\ntheir own. This is a recognition that since such families are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalready  in distress, bringing the family to court should  be\r\n\r\nthe  very  last  resort  and  should  only  be  left  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has the support of all the communities in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  There  is one major shortcoming  in  my  opinion,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  its  duration.   By  any  measure,  six  years  of\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education is not enough for a person to  hold  his\r\n\r\nown  in  the future.  Globalisation is an irreversible  trend\r\n\r\nand is picking up pace across the world. Singaporeans have no\r\n\r\nchoice  but to be fully engaged in the race.  To be  able  to\r\n\r\nstand  up  to  the best in the world, we should put  all  our\r\n\r\nchildren through at least 9 or 10 years of education  instead\r\n\r\nof  just  six  as  provided in the  Bill.   Hopefully,  after\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education has been implemented for several  years,\r\n\r\nthe  worries and concern about Compulsory Education would  be\r\n\r\nassuaged and we could think about extending the duration to a\r\n\r\nlonger period.  Hopefully, this could be done soon. Even now,\r\n\r\nmore  and more of our children are already voluntarily having\r\n\r\nat  least  9  years  of  education, if we  include  technical\r\n\r\neducation. This is so because those without such an education\r\n\r\nwould find it increasingly difficult to find a job in the job\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Compulsory Education Bill as it stands is the\r\n\r\nmost appropriate one at this point of time for Singapore.   I\r\n\r\nsupport the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Sir, I rise to support\r\n\r\nthe  Compulsory  Education Bill.

Up to now, we have allowed  the  parents  the\r\n\r\nchoice  of whether to send their children to school  and  the\r\n\r\nvast  majority of parents have done so. This is  because  the\r\n\r\nparents  generally appreciate the value of a  good  education\r\n\r\nfor  their  children.  Public opinion is  not  against  those\r\n\r\nparents  who  wish  to teach their children  differently  but\r\n\r\nrather the parents who do not educate their children at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By making education compulsory, the schools are not\r\n\r\nabout  to  take  over  the responsibility  of  educating  the\r\n\r\nchildren.  The responsibility rightly belongs to the parents.\r\n\r\nAt  best, it is a joint responsibility when the child  is  in\r\n\r\nschool.   With Compulsory Education, the Government  and  the\r\n\r\ncommunity must be prepared to extend help to parents who face\r\n\r\nserious  difficulties in sending their children to school.  I\r\n\r\nhope   the   community  organisations  can  make  a  positive\r\n\r\ncontribution in helping families who face difficulties living\r\n\r\nin  their  neighbourhood.   Besides  the  madrasahs,  San  Yu\r\n\r\nAdventist School and home schooling programmes, children with\r\n\r\nphysical  and  other  disabilities  are  also  exempted  from\r\n\r\nCompulsory  Education. This, to me, is a  practical  approach\r\n\r\nbecause  we do not want to put the added pressure  and  undue\r\n\r\nburden  on parents of children with disabilities. If  we  are\r\n\r\nnot  careful,  we may compound the problems  of  parents  who\r\n\r\nwould  feel  guilty if they could not afford  to  send  their\r\n\r\nchildren  with  disabilities for  appropriate  education  and\r\n\r\ntraining on a full-time basis.  Of course, some cynics may be\r\n\r\nquick  to  surmise  from  this exemption  as  a  way  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  avoid the responsibility of committing  funds\r\n\r\nand resources needed to look after this group of children.  I\r\n\r\nam  sure it is not due to a lack of compassion on the part of\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  Indeed, a special programme is required  to\r\n\r\ncater  to  the  special needs of children with  physical  and\r\n\r\nother  disabilities.  I know that the Minister has  just  now\r\n\r\nalluded to this point.  Perhaps, it is also useful later  for\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to  clarify  the  position  of  the  Education\r\n\r\nMinistry  regarding  the provision of educational  facilities\r\n\r\nand resources for disabled children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the study and consultation undertaken by\r\n\r\nthe   Committee,  we  have  a  better  understanding  of  the\r\n\r\nmadrasahs  and what they are doing.  I am quite surprised  at\r\n\r\nthe  low  standards  of  achievements  of  the  students   in\r\n\r\nmadrasahs compared to the Malay students who attend  national\r\n\r\nschools.   I wonder whether many Malay students from families\r\n\r\nthat  needed  special help have been directed  or  gravitated\r\n\r\ntowards  the  madrasahs instead of national schools.   Is  it\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  real or perceived help  they  are  able  to\r\n\r\nreceive  only  from the madrasahs in the education  of  these\r\n\r\npoorer  children?  Perhaps, the Education Ministry  can  help\r\n\r\nredress this area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the madrasahs' role is to produce Muslim religious\r\n\r\nteachers, we should not allow the number to grow beyond  what\r\n\r\nis  required. I therefore support the move to cap the maximum\r\n\r\nnumber  of  students in the six madrasahs to 400  pupils.   I\r\n\r\nalso  hope that the benchmark set for the madrasahs  at  PSLE\r\n\r\naggregate scores that match those of EM1 and EM2 Malay pupils\r\n\r\nin the six lowest national performing schools be only a start\r\n\r\nbecause  the benchmark set is six lowest performing  national\r\n\r\nschools.  This relatively low benchmark should be reviewed  a\r\n\r\nfew years later. The standards should be raised gradually  so\r\n\r\nthat  the target set is higher and the madrasah students will\r\n\r\nbe  encouraged  to constantly improve their performance  over\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am disturbed by the comment in the Report alluding to\r\n\r\nthe  possibility  of  parents  defying  the  requirement  for\r\n\r\nCompulsory  Education  in the form of civil  disobedience  if\r\n\r\nthey  are not allowed to instruct their children through home\r\n\r\nschooling programmes.  The impression might have been created\r\n\r\nthat  the concession is given because of the threat of  civil\r\n\r\ndisobedience.  I thought the whole exercise is to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  children receive proper education.  In fact, and I  echo\r\n\r\nwhat Dr Wang Kai Yuen had said, parents who consciously chose\r\n\r\nhome-schooling   could  be  considered   to   be   the   most\r\n\r\nconscientious  and  fully committed to  ensuring  that  their\r\n\r\nchildren  receive the best education.  I hope  these  parents\r\n\r\nalso\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappreciate   the  inadequacies  and  shortcomings   of   home\r\n\r\nschooling  programmes.   Their children  will  not  have  the\r\n\r\nnecessary   exposure  and  experience  they  would  otherwise\r\n\r\nreceive  in  school.  These children miss the opportunity  to\r\n\r\ninteract  with teachers and fellow pupils.  I  am  very  sure\r\n\r\nthat these parents will take steps to plug the gaps that  the\r\n\r\nhome schooling programme lacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is through instruction, discipline and practice that\r\n\r\nwe  learn  the skill of living our lives in such a  way  that\r\n\r\nwill amount to something excellent or worthwhile. We all have\r\n\r\nthat desire to educate our children to the fullest.   We want\r\n\r\nour   young  children  to  grow  up  leading  meaningful  and\r\n\r\nfulfilling  lives.   I  hope  this  Bill  to  make  education\r\n\r\ncompulsory will help the 1,000-odd children who missed school\r\n\r\nthe opportunity to have a good start in their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I have spoken up in Parliament\r\n\r\non the need to have Compulsory Education during the debate on\r\n\r\nthe President's Speech in March 1985, and I have followed  up\r\n\r\nthat  call  for Compulsory Education on many other  occasions\r\n\r\nduring the debate in Committee at Budget time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Government agreed to implement Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation  and appointed a Committee on Compulsory  Education\r\n\r\nto  study  the issues and prepare a report.  The  Report  has\r\n\r\nbeen prepared and presented to the Minister, and the Minister\r\n\r\nhas  accepted all the recommendations of the Committee.   The\r\n\r\nChairman  of the Committee is the Senior Minister  of  State,\r\n\r\nand  I note that many of its members comprise PAP Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament.   With such a strong presence of  politicians  in\r\n\r\nthat Committee, what I am afraid is that the decisions of the\r\n\r\nCommittee  may  be heavily influenced by politicians,  rather\r\n\r\nthan  looked at from the educational point of view.  This  is\r\n\r\nan  educational matter and if the Government  wants  what  is\r\n\r\nbest for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  children,  then  they  should  leave  the  decision   on\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education to professional educationists,  and  not\r\n\r\nbe  influenced by politicians.  We can see that the decisions\r\n\r\nof   the  Committee  are  not  purely  based  on  educational\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was pointed out in the Report that for those\r\n\r\ncountries  which  have  chosen to have Compulsory  Education,\r\n\r\nthey  have fixed the Compulsory Education period between 9-11\r\n\r\nyears,  while  Singapore decides only  to  have  6  years  of\r\n\r\nCompulsory  Education.   Six years of  compulsory  schooling,\r\n\r\nfrom  the educational point of view, is definitely not enough\r\n\r\nfor  a  pupil to master the three Rs -  reading, writing  and\r\n\r\narithmetic.   In  Singapore's context, reading  involves  the\r\n\r\nreading  of two languages.  Therefore, how can six  years  be\r\n\r\nenough?    The  Committee's  recommendation  of   six   years\r\n\r\ncompulsory primary education is merely a political expediency\r\n\r\nto satisfy the needs of the Government's policy as envisioned\r\n\r\nin   Singapore  21,  which  inter  alia   says   that   every\r\n\r\nSingaporean counts.  Under this policy, the Government cannot\r\n\r\nbe   seen  every  year  to  be  abandoning  1,000-odd   young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who do not attend school at all.  Therefore, the\r\n\r\nGovernment   has  to  implement  Compulsory   Education   but\r\n\r\ngrudgingly  at six years.  I say that six years of compulsory\r\n\r\nattendance  in school is not enough.  The minimum  number  of\r\n\r\nyears  we  should make a pupil attend school is eight  years.\r\n\r\nAt  eight  years of schooling, our pupils would then  have  a\r\n\r\nchance to master the core subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report says that, ideally, a pupil should attend\r\n\r\nschool  for 10 years.  But 10 years' education, from  my  own\r\n\r\nexperience,  is too long for pupils who show no  interest  in\r\n\r\nschooling, and it is a waste of the students' time and  State\r\n\r\nfunds.  For this reason, many countries implement a nine-year\r\n\r\nCompulsory  Education programme.  But I  think  that  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  context, we can start with eight years' schooling.\r\n\r\nIf  it  is  proven that it is still not sufficient, then  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should increase it to nine years.  I call  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to increase the period of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompulsory  Education to eight years and  not  stick  to  its\r\n\r\nproposed six years.  I think if our Government wants to  give\r\n\r\nour   children  the  best  education,  then  it  should  make\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education at eight years rather than just a  token\r\n\r\nsix  years.  The Government is purported to have reserves  of\r\n\r\n$110   billion.   Then  it  should  have  funds  to  maintain\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education at  eight years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards enforcement, I agree that the parents should\r\n\r\nbe made responsible for ensuring attendance of their child at\r\n\r\nschool.   However, I do not agree that the parents should  be\r\n\r\npunished  with imprisonment.  How can the law force a  parent\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that his child attends  school if the  child  for\r\n\r\nsome reason refuses to do so, although such cases are few and\r\n\r\nfar  between?  I think the maximum fine of $2,000  should  be\r\n\r\nsufficient  punishment for a parent whose child of compulsory\r\n\r\nage fails to attend school regularly.  The fine of $5,000, in\r\n\r\nmy  view,  is too excessive.  Normally, I would imagine  that\r\n\r\nonce  a  parent has been apprehended by the police  and  made\r\n\r\naware  that  he has committed an offence by not  sending  his\r\n\r\nchild  to  school, the parent would certainly make sure  that\r\n\r\nhis child does go to school unless, of course, he is deep  in\r\n\r\nfinancial difficulty, in which case the MCDS should  step  in\r\n\r\nto  assist.  A hefty fine or a jail sentence would definitely\r\n\r\nbe counter productive.  That would only antagonise the parent\r\n\r\nand  make  him  less  cooperative, to the  detriment  of  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of the  child.  The best course is to win over  the\r\n\r\nparent  and make him know the benefits of education  for  his\r\n\r\nchild and induce him, on his own accord, to want to send  his\r\n\r\nchild of compulsory school age to school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the madrasahs and San Yu Adventist School, I\r\n\r\nthink  the  recommendations of the Committee are  fair.   The\r\n\r\npupils  of  madrasahs and San Yu Adventist School  should  be\r\n\r\nmade  to attend minimum standards for the PSLE.  I would like\r\n\r\nto  add  that  those schools be given five years  to  upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves.   In  that  period, they should  bring  up  their\r\n\r\nstandards  and be at par with those in the national  schools.\r\n\r\nThe Government should give a helping hand in teacher training\r\n\r\nfor these schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for\r\n\r\nallowing  me  to  join  in  this  debate  on  the  Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at first glance, this Bill would appear to be\r\n\r\nsomething  of an anomaly.  We live in a society  which  holds\r\n\r\neducational  achievement in high esteem and as a core  value.\r\n\r\nWe  have  an economy which attaches significant and  tangible\r\n\r\npremium to education and skills.  We have a Government  which\r\n\r\nnot  only devotes significant resources to education but also\r\n\r\nconstantly encourages, cajoles and even admonishes its people\r\n\r\nto   train,  retrain  and  pursue  lifelong  education.   The\r\n\r\nMinister has given us empirical evidence previously  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  that  this has worked with 97% to 98% of  each  cohort\r\n\r\nenrolling  for  primary one.  The question that  begs  to  be\r\n\r\nasked  is why do we need this Bill to make education  at  the\r\n\r\nprimary  level compulsory.  Perhaps the answer lies  to  some\r\n\r\nextent  in  the  fact that in each cohort there  are  several\r\n\r\nhundred  students  who  do not enrol for  primary  education.\r\n\r\nMany  of  them,  as  we  are aware, do  have  perfectly  good\r\n\r\nreasons.   But there would be a minority for whom this is not\r\n\r\nthe  case  and it is for them that we should be  acting,  and\r\n\r\nacting  decisively.  This Bill would be a worthwhile addition\r\n\r\nto  our  statutes if it is able to help this small  group  of\r\n\r\nyoung Singaporeans acquire the education that they are indeed\r\n\r\nentitled to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill is worthy of support because it makes a\r\n\r\nstatement  on the importance that we in Singapore  attach  to\r\n\r\neducation.  It does underscore the responsibility of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparents  in  this very important endeavour and it does  endow\r\n\r\nthe Ministry with the authority and the wherewithal to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  no  child  misses  out  on education  due  to  parental\r\n\r\nneglect.   Indeed, Sir, it is difficult to quarrel with  this\r\n\r\nBill at the level of its ideals and principles which underpin\r\n\r\nit.   Who in their right mind can justifiably oppose  a  Bill\r\n\r\nthat says every child should be given a chance to be educated\r\n\r\nand realise his full potential?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge in this Bill, in my opinion, is in its\r\n\r\nimplementation and the enforcement of its provisions.  As the\r\n\r\nproverbial saying goes, the devil is in the details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Compulsory Education Board has an unenviable\r\n\r\ntask.   It  must steadfastly uphold the spirit and intent  of\r\n\r\nthis  legislation and yet it must adopt a deft and  sensitive\r\n\r\ntouch in its enforcement.  Why?  The family is central  to  a\r\n\r\nchild's development.  Parental involvement and support is key\r\n\r\nto a child's educational advancement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my years as CEO of SINDA, there is one thing that I\r\n\r\nhave learnt and it is that state or institutional support can\r\n\r\nnever  replace the role of the parents or the family  in  the\r\n\r\nchild's  development.  Yet the Bill allows for  quite  severe\r\n\r\npenalties to be imposed on parents if they do not comply with\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of this Bill - a fine of up to $5,000 and  up\r\n\r\nto 12 months' imprisonment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam argued earlier that there should be no\r\n\r\nimprisonment  and that the fine should be  reduced.   I  find\r\n\r\nthat  odd  because  if  an Act is to be effective,  then  the\r\n\r\nenforcement  and  the penalties that go with the  enforcement\r\n\r\nmust  be of sufficient deterrent quality.  This is where  the\r\n\r\ncatch  of  this Bill lies: vigorous and assiduous enforcement\r\n\r\nof  this Bill will, in my opinion, undermine the very  intent\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill.  It could lead to non-cooperation,  resentment\r\n\r\nand  even  family breakdown.  Certainly, Sir, a dysfunctional\r\n\r\nfamily   is   not  a  conducive  backdrop  for  academic   or\r\n\r\neducational pursuits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Compulsory Education Bill cannot be a panacea\r\n\r\nfor deep-seated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblems that might lie within a family.  No one involved  in\r\n\r\nthis endeavour should go away with the wrong impression.  The\r\n\r\nCompulsory  Education  Board must  therefore  exercise  great\r\n\r\nflexibility  and restraint in carrying out its  duties.   The\r\n\r\nCommittee  under Senior Minister of State for  Education,  Dr\r\n\r\nAline Wong, has already exercised considerable restraint  and\r\n\r\nflexibility and that is evident in the manner in which it has\r\n\r\ndealt with specific issues such as those to do with madrasahs\r\n\r\nand  home  schooling.  And also in wanting to  approach  this\r\n\r\nvery  new element of our society in an incremental manner  by\r\n\r\naddressing primary education first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all said and done, we still need safeguards to make\r\n\r\nsure  that  this process does not run awry.  We  must  ensure\r\n\r\nthat the imposition of the penalties that are provided for in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill are used only as a last resort and only after  all\r\n\r\nother avenues have been exhausted.  In the Bill itself, there\r\n\r\nis  a two-stage process.  The Compulsory Education Board  can\r\n\r\ninvestigate and then make recommendations on what ought to be\r\n\r\ndone  in  a  particular  case  to  the  Director-General   of\r\n\r\nEducation.   He or she in turn would then be the arbiter,  as\r\n\r\nit  were,  for  the final course of action.   This  two-stage\r\n\r\nprocess has its merits.  Certainly, Sir, I would go one  step\r\n\r\nfurther  and  say that we need to ensure that  even  for  the\r\n\r\nmanner  in  which the Compulsory Education Board carries  out\r\n\r\nits  duties,  there are adequate provisions and protocol,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary, to make sure that they do not go about this  in  a\r\n\r\nmanner that might create more problems than it solves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I for one would certainly not be unhappy if the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Bill, particularly those pertaining to the\r\n\r\nextreme penalties, are observed more in their breach than  in\r\n\r\ntheir practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other level, Sir, is resources.

This is an important but  also  a\r\n\r\nsensitive   subject  that  requires  careful   and   rational\r\n\r\nhandling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, key to our success in remaining at the forefront in\r\n\r\nan  increasingly competitive world is our ability  to  create\r\n\r\nand  produce  the educated, qualified, skilful  and  creative\r\n\r\npeople.  To achieve this objective, there is no substitute to\r\n\r\na  sustained  effort in improving the level of education  and\r\n\r\nskills  training for our citizens.  Those who wonder  why  we\r\n\r\nplace  so  much  emphasis  on  our  education  system  should\r\n\r\nunderstand  that this is the only way for us to keep  abreast\r\n\r\nof and remain relevant in the changing world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back over the past 40 years, we could see how\r\n\r\nresponsive our education\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem has been to the changing needs.  When we launched  our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  programme to  provide  employment  to  our\r\n\r\nnewly independent country, we introduced technical education.\r\n\r\nAs  we  progressed, we set up VITB and pressed  on  with  our\r\n\r\nvocational  and industrial training programme.   We  expanded\r\n\r\nour  polytechnic education in response to the demand  created\r\n\r\nby  the  variety  of  industries set up here.   Our  tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions  too  had  undergone change  in  both  areas  of\r\n\r\nstudies  as  well as the number of intake.  These qualitative\r\n\r\nand  quantitative changes were made to meet the demand in the\r\n\r\nlabour market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the world moves from an old economy to the new\r\n\r\nknowledge-based  economy,  we can anticipate  changes  taking\r\n\r\nplace  at  a  faster tempo.  Newer frontiers will be  opened,\r\n\r\nthus  throwing challenges and at the same time  offering  new\r\n\r\nopportunities  to those who are able to see  and  grab  them.\r\n\r\nOnly  two decades ago we were struggling to sustain our  role\r\n\r\nin the mainstream of the world's industrial community through\r\n\r\nan  attempt  to  restructure  our  economy  by  applying  and\r\n\r\nattracting   capital-intensive  production.    Although   the\r\n\r\nrecession in the mid-80s had forced us to shelve our plan and\r\n\r\ncaused  a  setback,  it was temporary.  We  remained  on-gear\r\n\r\ntowards  keeping ourselves relevant to the world.  While  the\r\n\r\nworld  economic upturn and downturn necessitate  us  to  make\r\n\r\nadjustment, we remain on-track in seeking and securing a role\r\n\r\nin the sunrise industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are talking not only about the super microchips\r\n\r\nbut  also  about the potential  genetic discoveries and  what\r\n\r\nother  advances  in life sciences have to offer  to  us.   An\r\n\r\narticle  in the Far Eastern Economic Review dated 15th   June\r\n\r\nthis year quoted Prof. Chris Tan, Head of Singapore Institute\r\n\r\nof  Molecular  and  Cell Biology, as  saying  that  the  21st\r\n\r\ncentury  will  belong to biology, just as  the  20th  did  to\r\n\r\nphysics.   He  said  that at the start of the  last  century,\r\n\r\nscientists  were beginning to map out the periodic  table  of\r\n\r\nelements; now they are starting to sequence the human genome.\r\n\r\nThis  discovery of DNA sequence in scientific journal  itself\r\n\r\ndid not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchange  anyone's  life but it could lead  to  new  medicines,\r\n\r\nagricultural  advances and the ability to accurately  predict\r\n\r\nwhether you are genetically predisposed to heart disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as we enter the era of borderless or globalised\r\n\r\nworld characterised by the movement of knowledge, technology,\r\n\r\ntalents  and capital across the border, the need  to  develop\r\n\r\nthe potential of our people to the highest possible level  is\r\n\r\neven more urgent.  This is the era where those in control  of\r\n\r\ninformation  hold  the power, those in  possession  of  great\r\n\r\nknowledge ensure their success and those who are able to  use\r\n\r\ntechnology  create  wealth.  This is also  an  era  of  rapid\r\n\r\nchange  with  greater threat of digital divide between  those\r\n\r\nwho are able to ride on the new tide and those falling off to\r\n\r\nthe side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the phenomenon with all its ramifications mentioned\r\n\r\nabove  is  universal.   It affects every  society  and  every\r\n\r\ncountry in the world.  I believe that the best way to prepare\r\n\r\nour  people  to face the challenge of a globalised  world  is\r\n\r\nthrough education, training, re-education and retraining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of reasons why education, training,\r\n\r\nthe  acquisition of knowledge and improved ability  of  every\r\n\r\ncitizen  is  of great importance to us.  Firstly, our  people\r\n\r\nare our only natural resource.  We have to manage and develop\r\n\r\nthis resource as best as we can.  Secondly, as a country that\r\n\r\nupholds  the principle of meritocracy, education is a crucial\r\n\r\nvehicle  for our social mobility.  It is the best  answer  to\r\n\r\nthe  threat of digital divide facing our society in the years\r\n\r\nto  come.  Thirdly, as a country with a small population,  it\r\n\r\nis  important for Singapore to develop the potential  of  its\r\n\r\ncitizens to the maximum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, students of demography may be familiar with the\r\n\r\nconcept   of  population  pyramid.   Countries  with   bigger\r\n\r\npopulation  can continue to survive, and even  prosper,  with\r\n\r\ntheir  broad-based educational pyramid.  This is because  the\r\n\r\ntalent  pool of those at the top of the pyramid is big enough\r\n\r\nto meet the requirement and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npropel their economies.  As our population is small, we  need\r\n\r\nto  create  a  rather narrow base educational pyramid.   This\r\n\r\nmeans  we  have  to ensure that we increase  the  educational\r\n\r\nqualification of our people at every level, be it  PSLE,  GCE\r\n\r\n'O', post-secondary or tertiary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the operative phrase here is \"at every level\". It\r\n\r\nis in this context that Compulsory Education should be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand it, the Committee on Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation, chaired by the Senior Minister of State, Dr  Aline\r\n\r\nWong,  had  gone at great length in its consultation  and  in\r\n\r\nseeking   views  from  the  members  of  the  public   before\r\n\r\npresenting  it  to the public.  I generally  agree  with  the\r\n\r\nsubstance  of  the Bill, especially on matters pertaining  to\r\n\r\nthe  six-year  period  of  CE and the  manner  it  is  to  be\r\n\r\nenforced.  I subscribe to the objective underlying the CE  in\r\n\r\nmeeting  the need for a minimum foundation for every  student\r\n\r\nin  the  core  subjects - English, Mathematics  and  Science.\r\n\r\nThis  is  to  prepare such school leavers for the  knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the general public appeared supportive to the\r\n\r\nproposal.  Those who had expressed some reservations  on  the\r\n\r\nlegal  and  enforcement aspect were assured on  knowing  that\r\n\r\nthere  is a mechanism in place to deal with individual cases.\r\n\r\nMost  people would agree, in principle, that there must be  a\r\n\r\nshared responsibility in achieving the objectives of the CE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, there has been some disquiet among the\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  Muslim community.  While  nobody  seems  to\r\n\r\ndisagree   that  the  broad  objectives  of  the   Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation  were there, some were concerned about  the  impact\r\n\r\nthe CE has on madrasah education in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a Muslim, I share their concern. I even\r\n\r\nunderstand their fear.  However,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI could not agree with those who questioned the motive behind\r\n\r\nCE  and viewed Compulsory Education as a means to effect  the\r\n\r\nclosure   of  the  madrasahs.   Expressions,  such   as   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has \"sinister motive\", were reported in the media.\r\n\r\nI  am  sad at the atmospherics surrounding the debate on  the\r\n\r\nissue.   Some  quarters  had  even  taken  advantage  of  the\r\n\r\nprevailing debate in the media and Internet then by  stirring\r\n\r\nup  the  emotions and religious sentiments even  though  they\r\n\r\nfully  know  that such an approach would not help in  solving\r\n\r\nthe problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collectively, the Malay MPs, who sensed that the issue\r\n\r\nhad  developed into a political one and that some groups were\r\n\r\ntrying  to  split  the Muslim ground and putting  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity   on  a  collision  course  with  the   Government,\r\n\r\npersuaded the hon. Prime Minister to intervene.  I would like\r\n\r\nto  take this opportunity to thank Prime Minister Goh for his\r\n\r\ntimely  and masterly intervention through dialogues with  the\r\n\r\nMuslim community leaders and for his assurance that madrasahs\r\n\r\nwould not be closed.  My colleagues and I have never believed\r\n\r\nfor  a moment that CE would result in the end of the madrasah\r\n\r\neducation.   We  are  nevertheless happy with  the  assurance\r\n\r\ngiven by the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister had continuously kept in close\r\n\r\nconsultation  with the Malay MPs on the madrasah  issue.   In\r\n\r\none  of  such heart-to-heart discussions, the possibility  of\r\n\r\nexempting  the  madrasah from CE was raised.  This  was  then\r\n\r\ndiscussed  in  the dialogue the Prime Minister had  with  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  community  leaders and the  proposal  received  their\r\n\r\nsupport.   Now,  the  benchmark has  been  agreed  and  I  am\r\n\r\nencouraged to learn that the madrasahs are now focusing their\r\n\r\nmind on the need to make the necessary qualitative change  in\r\n\r\ntheir  curriculum to prepare themselves for the inclusion  of\r\n\r\nrequired examinable core subjects at the PSLE level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, there are people out there who still have\r\n\r\na lingering doubt about the Government's motive.  If there is\r\n\r\nsuch a doubt, we would certainly be doubly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhappy  if the Minister could assure this House again that  it\r\n\r\nwas  not  the Government's intention to close or  effect  the\r\n\r\nclosure of the madrasahs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my unwavering belief that religious education\r\n\r\nis  important for the Muslim community and it is more so  for\r\n\r\nrapidly changing Singapore with all its open characteristics.\r\n\r\nHowever, I strongly believe that it is equally important that\r\n\r\nthe  Muslims,  just  like  other  people  in  Singapore,   be\r\n\r\nsufficiently  and properly equipped to face the  era  of  the\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, the Muslim community will have to\r\n\r\ncontinue to examine this and other issues related to our well-being.  This is due to the fact that the world is not static.\r\n\r\nIt is changing and the change is becoming even more rapid and\r\n\r\nit  includes the requirements for education.  Upmost  in  our\r\n\r\nmind  is  to  ensure the balance between the educational  and\r\n\r\nspiritual needs of our community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, CE is the manifestation of our desire to carve a\r\n\r\nbetter   future   for   everyone,   Muslim   and   non-Muslim\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   It involves making changes and being  sincere\r\n\r\nabout  its objective.  I know changes are not easy  to  make,\r\n\r\nbut our track record shows that if a change is necessary,  we\r\n\r\nwill  endeavour to effect the change no matter how  difficult\r\n\r\nand  how painful it can be.  Time will be the ultimate  judge\r\n\r\non  whether  the  change is beneficial or  otherwise  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou for this opportunity to speak on the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember well the reply that Minister Teo Chee Hean\r\n\r\ngave just over a year ago in response to an Oral Question  by\r\n\r\nNMP  Mdm Claire Chiang on Compulsory Education.  I agree with\r\n\r\nthe  response.   With some 97% of our young  already  in  the\r\n\r\nnational education system at the primary level, there  is  no\r\n\r\npressing need to make education compulsory.  So when Prime\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  announced some two months later that the  issue  of\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education was to be reconsidered, I was surprised.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Prime Minister went on to explain that,  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, the statement that every Singaporean  matters  is\r\n\r\nnot  merely  a  slogan.   We have the  means  to  give  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean child an education.  So we should do it.  In  the\r\n\r\nnew   economy,  life  would  be  better  for  every  educated\r\n\r\nSingaporean and his or her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the decision to take another look at the issue of\r\n\r\nCompulsory  Education thus has its origin in the  heart,  not\r\n\r\njust  in  the  head.   For  everyone  who  thinks  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has an ulterior motive, let him or her dispel this\r\n\r\ndoubt.  The PAP Government cares for the people.  It has  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of Singapore and every Singaporean at  heart.   Our\r\n\r\nchildren  need  the knowledge to fit into  the  new  economy.\r\n\r\nThey  also  need the knowledge and experience to  help  build\r\n\r\nnational  identity  and  cohesion.  These  are  the  two  key\r\n\r\nobjectives of our national school system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recognising that here are needs that cannot be met\r\n\r\nwithin the national school system, the Bill proposes to allow\r\n\r\nsome  of  our  young  to be educated outside  of  it.   I  am\r\n\r\nconfident  that  parents  of these  children  have  a  vested\r\n\r\ninterest  to  ensure that their children receive  the  needed\r\n\r\nknowledge for their future economic wellness.  But  they  may\r\n\r\nnot  be as concerned about national identity and cohesion or,\r\n\r\nmost  probably, they do not know what needs  to  be  done  to\r\n\r\nensure that their children grow up to be strong Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nHence,  I  hope  that  the Ministry  would  develop  a  basic\r\n\r\nnational education syllabus with materials that can  be  used\r\n\r\nto  inculcate  this  important integrative  spirit  in  these\r\n\r\nchildren.   The  national education syllabus adopted  by  the\r\n\r\nnational  school  system  can be adapted  for  this  purpose.\r\n\r\nImmersion   programmes  during  vacation  time,  like   those\r\n\r\norganised for young Singaporeans living abroad could be  part\r\n\r\nof the syllabus.  The Ministry should then make this syllabus\r\n\r\ncompulsory under clause 4(1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a good policy is not only strong in concept, but\r\n\r\nalso   effective  in  its  implementation  and   enforcement.\r\n\r\nImplementation and enforcement will cost money and bodies.  I\r\n\r\npresume  the  Ministry  of  Education  will  have  people  to\r\n\r\nadminister and enforce Compulsory Education.  I believe  that\r\n\r\nprincipals  and  teachers will also get involved,  adding  to\r\n\r\ntheir  responsibilities.  They must be trained  and  prepared\r\n\r\nfor  the task.  Enforcement will be an issue and effort  must\r\n\r\nbe  made  to thoroughly investigate each case and  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat only those really guilty of neglect are punished.  I  am\r\n\r\nassured by the Minister's assurance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children may not be in school for many reasons. Some\r\n\r\nmay be family problems and others may be financial in nature.\r\n\r\nMaking  primary  education compulsory does not  automatically\r\n\r\nchange  the  financial  ability of  families  to  afford  the\r\n\r\neducation.   The  Government must recognise  that  in  moving\r\n\r\ntowards  Compulsory  Education, additional  efforts  will  be\r\n\r\nneeded  to  help  these  families  register  and  keep  their\r\n\r\nchildren in school.  The efforts will not only be in monetary\r\n\r\nterms,  but  also  non-monetary support for the  children  in\r\n\r\ntheir  school work, for example.  The community will be asked\r\n\r\nto  do  more,  but the Government must take  the  lead.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  must  be prepared to provide the  funds  to  help\r\n\r\nthose  needing financial assistance and to enable  grassroots\r\n\r\nand community organisations to provide other support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our parents have done a marvellous job in providing\r\n\r\nand  caring for their children.  They must continue  to  take\r\n\r\nresponsibility for their children's education.  I  hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  availability of Government and community  assistance  to\r\n\r\nparents does not constitute a moral hazard in respect of this\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  However, given the keen concern and interest\r\n\r\nof  parents in general to the education of their children,  I\r\n\r\nam  hopeful that making primary education compulsory will not\r\n\r\ndiminish this sense of responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Senior Minister of State for Education, Dr Aline\r\n\r\nWong,  and  her  Committee on Compulsory Education  and  many\r\n\r\nother  people  and organisations have put in  much  time  and\r\n\r\neffort  to study, discuss and understand the issues  involved\r\n\r\nin    Compulsory   Education.    Their   contributions   have\r\n\r\nstrengthened  this Bill.  We owe them thanks for  their  time\r\n\r\nand  effort.  Mr Chiam is unfair to cast doubt on the  report\r\n\r\nand  therefore the efforts and time of so many people.  Where\r\n\r\nis  the  politics?  Anyone reading the report cannot fail  to\r\n\r\nsee  that  it is an excellent, fair and comprehensive  report\r\n\r\nwhich  is  sensitive to the nature of the Singapore  society.\r\n\r\nIn  his  speech as a whole, Mr Chiam has in fact agreed  with\r\n\r\nthe  report.  He only squabbles over some fine details  which\r\n\r\nwould  after  all change with time and circumstances.   I  am\r\n\r\nsure  most  Singaporeans  will  not  agree  with  Mr  Chiam's\r\n\r\ncriticism of the report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, let me say that with over 93% of\r\n\r\neach  year's cohort completing secondary education,  we  have\r\n\r\nachieved  almost universal education at both the primary  and\r\n\r\nsecondary  levels.   In making primary education  compulsory,\r\n\r\nthe  country is putting a lot of efforts for the few who drop\r\n\r\nout.  We are doing this because every Singaporean counts.  To\r\n\r\nthe  PAP Government, this is not merely a slogan.  The  money\r\n\r\nand efforts used to make primary education compulsory will be\r\n\r\nmoney  well  spent  and effort well expended.   However,  for\r\n\r\nCompulsory   Education  to  work,  society,  especially   our\r\n\r\nparents,  must understand and support it.  I urge the  people\r\n\r\nto  give  Compulsory  Education for our young  their  fullest\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Firstly, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  inform the House that I am a member  of  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  on Compulsory Education led by Dr Aline Wong  that\r\n\r\nhad  made  recommendations to the Government.  I  would  also\r\n\r\nlike  to  inform Mr Chiam See Tong that although  there  were\r\n\r\nfive Members of Parliament in the Committee, a number of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfeedback  and dialogue sessions were conducted and views  and\r\n\r\nfeedback   from  various  community  groups  were   received.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am unable to understand when he said that  there\r\n\r\nis a political motive in the recommendations of the Committee\r\n\r\non Compulsory Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this Compulsory Education Bill because it will\r\n\r\nensure  that  children  in  Singapore  will  have  the  basic\r\n\r\neducation  relevant  to Singapore. We  will  be  facing  keen\r\n\r\ncompetition.   The technologies being used in  companies  are\r\n\r\nmore  advanced  and they require our workers to  acquire  new\r\n\r\nskills in order to work in such companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The working world has also changed. As a result of\r\n\r\nglobalisation,  our  companies  also  need  to  change  their\r\n\r\noperational  structure constantly and this  will  affect  our\r\n\r\nworkers' employability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory Education offers a basic minimum education\r\n\r\nfor  every  child  to  face  a new era  based  on  knowledge.\r\n\r\nAlthough I agree that Compulsory Education is meant  for  the\r\n\r\nprimary  level  at  this  moment, I  believe  those  who  are\r\n\r\ninvolved  in the education of every child, whether  teachers,\r\n\r\nparents,  schools  or community leaders, should  ensure  that\r\n\r\nevery  child  receives a minimum education  up  to  secondary\r\n\r\nlevel.   With  a strong foundation in education,  each  child\r\n\r\nwill  be  better prepared in receiving quality education  and\r\n\r\nacquire  new skills in the years ahead. With this,  they  are\r\n\r\nalso   able  to  grab  all  opportunities  provided  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, the employers or the trade unions, and they  will\r\n\r\nalso  be  able to benefit from the opportunities provided  by\r\n\r\nthe ITE, polytechnics or the universities.  In short, what is\r\n\r\nemphasised is basic education for life-long learning  and  in\r\n\r\nobtaining skills.  This, I believe, is the best way to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  our children will remain employable when they begin  to\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when the recommendations on Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation  were  first studied, some members  of  the  Malay-Muslim community had raised their concerns that the madrasahs\r\n\r\nwill be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclosed when this is implemented.  The Committee on Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation did not make any recommendation for the closure  of\r\n\r\nthe  madrasahs.  I am also confident too that the  Government\r\n\r\ndoes  not  intend  to  close  the  madrasahs.   I  hope   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  as  mentioned by Mr Yatiman,  will  explain  its\r\n\r\npolicy  on the madrasah system of education. It must give  an\r\n\r\nassurance  that  the madrasahs will not  be  closed  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment does not have the intention to close the madrasahs\r\n\r\nby virtue of this Compulsory Education Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Government has already announced that\r\n\r\nsome  schools, eg, the madrasahs, San Yu Adventist and  those\r\n\r\ninvolved  in home-schooling, will be exempted from Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation.  Facilities should be provided for the children in\r\n\r\npreparing  them for the PSLE examination, together  with  the\r\n\r\nother students in their cohort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the question is, especially among the madrasahs and\r\n\r\nthe Malay-Muslim community, what will happen to the madrasahs\r\n\r\nwhen  the  students  are  not  able  to  attain  the  minimum\r\n\r\nstandard.   I  hope  a  clarification  by  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation  will  help them to understand  how  the  exemption\r\n\r\ncriteria will be implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that science, mathematics and English are\r\n\r\nimportant basic subjects for our children.  Therefore, it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  for  every  student,  who  is  exempted  from  the\r\n\r\nnational  school under this Compulsory Education  system,  to\r\n\r\nsit for the PSLE examination together with their cohort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members of the Muslim community have earlier given\r\n\r\na  negative  response to CE.  They were  concerned  that  the\r\n\r\nmadrasahs  will  be closed, and some of them  felt  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment intends to close the madrasahs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their concern for the future of religious education is\r\n\r\nunderstood:  who will become the religious leaders  who  will\r\n\r\nthen  educate the Muslim children with the moral and  Islamic\r\n\r\nvirtues  if  we are unable to produce religious  teachers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namong  ourselves?   This  is a relevant  question  or  issue,\r\n\r\nalthough  some  of  the  bases of  these  questions  are  not\r\n\r\naccurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay-Muslim community will be able to focus\r\n\r\nthemselves  on how to assist their Malay-Muslim  children  to\r\n\r\nreceive religious education.  For children whose parents want\r\n\r\nthem  to  be religious teachers, there are ways in which  the\r\n\r\nreligious or madrasah leaders can offer them to achieve  this\r\n\r\nobjective.   But  there  is  also a  group  of  madrasah  and\r\n\r\nreligious  leaders  who  need to understand  more  about  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the  needs of the Malay-Muslim  children  whose\r\n\r\nparents want them to have religious education besides  having\r\n\r\nsecular education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever had been decided, every community leader and\r\n\r\nparent  should be aware of the global changes that had  taken\r\n\r\nplace,  including  Singapore.  In a knowledge-based  economy,\r\n\r\nand   with  globalisation,  the  working  world  has  changed\r\n\r\ntremendously.  If we do not equip our children with the basic\r\n\r\neducation  to  help them to acquire new or additional  skills\r\n\r\nfor  the  future,  we  would not be  able  to  guarantee  our\r\n\r\nchildren and the country's future.  The children who  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  a  good  basic education will not be able to  get  good\r\n\r\nemployment or to learn new knowledge when these are the basic\r\n\r\nnecessities of survival in a competitive working world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge for the Malay-Muslim community in\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  well as others is to continue  to  study  such\r\n\r\nissues and to bring about a balance between their worldly and\r\n\r\nspiritual needs.  We should assist our community in enhancing\r\n\r\ntheir  ability  to discuss this matter at a higher  level  so\r\n\r\nthat  we  will  be  able to understand  the  challenges  that\r\n\r\nSingapore is facing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world that we are facing now is not static. It is\r\n\r\nrapidly   changing.   Therefore,  requirements  in  education\r\n\r\nshould change accordingly.  The Malay-Muslim community should\r\n\r\nenhance  the way we educate our children in religion so  that\r\n\r\nit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill be in tandem with the changes in this world.  This is to\r\n\r\nensure  that the Malay-Muslim children in Singapore  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  fulfill their educational, employment and spiritual\r\n\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, some members in the Malay-Muslim community\r\n\r\nfound  that  the  decision of the Prime  Minister  to  exempt\r\n\r\nmadrasahs  from Compulsory Education is a victory  for  them.\r\n\r\nFor  me,  this  is  not  a game to  be  won.   In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education system proposed by the Government is  to\r\n\r\nassist  or  to  help every child in Singapore, including  the\r\n\r\nMalay-Muslim  children,  to be winners  in  this  competitive\r\n\r\nworld so that their future will be guaranteed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  speak  about  the   wider\r\n\r\nimplication of this Bill to Singaporeans, especially to those\r\n\r\noutside  the Malay-Muslim community.  To me, the  issue  that\r\n\r\nhas generated a lot of strong and emotional response has been\r\n\r\nthe issue on madrasahs, and, for this reason, I wish to touch\r\n\r\non a few aspects of this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been two types of reaction, both outside\r\n\r\nand inside the community, and I wish to touch on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people outside the community became very\r\n\r\nuncomfortable  about the the way, the zest, in which  Muslims\r\n\r\nwant to preserve madrasahs, and find that perhaps they cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand  why in this present day and age - it  seems  very\r\n\r\nillogical - that Malays want to preserve madrasahs which  are\r\n\r\nnot producing the kind of educated students that they hope to\r\n\r\nachieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure these people that this is far from the\r\n\r\ntruth.   Instead, what they should see is that  Malay-Muslims\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  in  their short history compared  to  Chinese\r\n\r\nhistory,  have  been  able  to  make  economic  progress  and\r\n\r\neducation  as  a  very important agenda  for  all  of  us  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   And,  I  think,  in that  sense,  we  have  made\r\n\r\ntremendous progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we need to realise that when we look back, the\r\n\r\nMalay  culture has provided quite inadequate examples of  how\r\n\r\neducation  is  developed in the community.  In fact,  if  you\r\n\r\nlook  back, a typical Malay-Muslim has to dig far deeper into\r\n\r\nhis  religious  roots,  because  it  was  Islam  that  really\r\n\r\npromoted  education when Islam was first  introduced  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.   And because of that, it is clear that, not only  to\r\n\r\ncounter  some  of the social problems that they have,  Malay-Muslims  need to use religion which has motivated its  people\r\n\r\nto  really acquire knowledge not only as a choice but  really\r\n\r\nas an obligation as Malay-Muslims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the problem seems to be that, in fact, Malay-Muslim religious leaders, and even these Muslim religious\r\n\r\nleaders  - non-Malays, Indians and those of Arabic  origin  - have  taken  it  upon  themselves, when they  evangelise,  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  schools.   It is then difficult to  really  separate\r\n\r\nwhat   is  the  religious  motivation,  and  that  of  really\r\n\r\nproviding secular education in this day and age.  So I  think\r\n\r\nthe problem really is a question of balance and content - how\r\n\r\ncan we continue to make sure that Malay-Muslims of the future\r\n\r\nand today continue to be inspired to ensure that they acquire\r\n\r\nthe kind of education but making sure the contents in schools\r\n\r\nand  all that could prepare them for the future needs of  the\r\n\r\neconomy?  In this regard, the Compulsory Education Bill  does\r\n\r\nprovide an answer for the future, and I hope the sceptics can\r\n\r\nsee it in this light and give this Bill their full support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reaction from within the community is slightly\r\n\r\ndifferent. A lot of people are concerned that the Bill  would\r\n\r\ninevitably lead to the closure of madrasahs.  I think this is\r\n\r\nwhere  the  Prime Minister has given assurance.   I  am  very\r\n\r\nhappy  with the assurance that the Prime Minister  has  given\r\n\r\nbecause  it  has  been made quite clear that while  madrasahs\r\n\r\nmust  continue to exist, at least to provide for  the  future\r\n\r\nleadership  and its religious leadership for the Malay-Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity,  it  is  through madrasahs  that  we  can  produce\r\n\r\nreligious  leaders for the future.  Whether it will  continue\r\n\r\nto produce other scholars outside the religious needs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the community is another question.  Here, I would like to\r\n\r\nrespond  by saying that no amount of institutional  help  can\r\n\r\nassure  success  in  this area. Rather, the  success  of  the\r\n\r\nmadrasahs  should be seen more beyond the point  whether  the\r\n\r\ninstitution  would exist in its artificial sense but  whether\r\n\r\nthe  future generation of Malay-Muslims will choose madrasahs\r\n\r\nas  a  means  of  education to meet both their religious  and\r\n\r\nsecular  needs,  and  whether students that  go  through  the\r\n\r\nsystem can become useful citizens of the future, not only for\r\n\r\nthe  needs of the community, but the needs of the country  at\r\n\r\nlarge.  That is a challenge for madrasahs to ensure that they\r\n\r\ncontinue to produce good students for the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that a lot of the members of the\r\n\r\ncommunity  tend  to look at the past as a means  to  try  and\r\n\r\ndefend  and  preserve whatever that is  available.   I  would\r\n\r\nrather, if we look at our unique Singaporean way, and the way\r\n\r\nthat  the Bill has been drafted that we look into the future.\r\n\r\nIf  we can find a nice blend to ensure madrasahs continue  to\r\n\r\nexist,  it is an unique opportunity in fact for Malay-Muslims\r\n\r\nin  Singapore not only to solve some of the problems that  we\r\n\r\nface,  but  be  an  inspiration and  guide  to  other  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunities  in  the  region  who  are  also  facing  similar\r\n\r\nproblems.   There are similar madrasahs in the region.   This\r\n\r\nis  where we can look forward and they could be quite  useful\r\n\r\nin our contribution to the Malay-Muslim world at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue that had caused a bit of controversy of\r\n\r\nlate,  I must say, has been the issue of what has been termed\r\n\r\ncollective  leadership.   A  lot  of  community  leaders  and\r\n\r\nreligious  leaders felt that they want to  play  equal  roles\r\n\r\nwith  the  Government in ensuring that madrasahs continue  to\r\n\r\nsurvive.   I  respect  their intention and  their  enthusiasm\r\n\r\nwhich  is  very,  very  important  to  ensure  that  this  is\r\n\r\nachieved.  However, we have to be very clear on what we  mean\r\n\r\nby  collective  leadership.  Elected Members  and  Government\r\n\r\nmust  be  responsible ultimately for the achievement  of  its\r\n\r\npeople  and  population, that is, the education  system  must\r\n\r\nproduce the desired outcome.  NGOs must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe responsible to its members.  It can only be responsible to\r\n\r\nits  members.  It cannot be responsible to the population  at\r\n\r\nlarge.   Therefore, its role must be one to support  whatever\r\n\r\nexisting policies it has or if it does not agree with it,  to\r\n\r\nlobby  and  change  and  pursue certain  decisions  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment would take.  But to call for collective leadership\r\n\r\nto  be  equally  responsible is not  relevant  in  this  case\r\n\r\nbecause  when you agree with the policies, that is fine,  but\r\n\r\nif  you  do  not  agree,  like what  we  have  seen  in  some\r\n\r\ndiscussions preceding this, who will be responsible, who will\r\n\r\nbe  accountable?  At  least for the Government,  you  have  a\r\n\r\nchoice.  If you do not meet the desired outcome, you can vote\r\n\r\nthem out.  But I do not see how you can exercise those rights\r\n\r\nif  this responsibility is given to a group of people  to  be\r\n\r\nresponsible to take the community forward.  This is an  issue\r\n\r\nwhich  has generated a lot of debate recently but I  wish  to\r\n\r\nput  this issue in perspective. At the end of the day, it  is\r\n\r\nthe  Government  and the Minister, together  with  the  other\r\n\r\nElected  MPs, who will have to decide.  I am sure  that  they\r\n\r\nare  responsible  to ensure the outcome.  To have  collective\r\n\r\nleadership, to me, is irrelevant at this stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just wish to touch on two other points, and one is\r\n\r\nabout  the assurance.  Although the Prime Minister has  given\r\n\r\nassurance  to the Malay-Muslim community, I personally  would\r\n\r\nhave  preferred  a more concrete assurance  in  the  form  of\r\n\r\nlegislation,  in  the sense that this Bill should  have  been\r\n\r\nmore specific about what it sees as the role of madrasahs, at\r\n\r\nleast  to  continue  to  provide  education  for  the  future\r\n\r\nreligious leaders.  If that can be preserved, I think we  are\r\n\r\nquite  happy  about it.  I am sure some may come  up  in  the\r\n\r\nsubsidiary legislation but I would prefer a bit more concrete\r\n\r\nassurance  from  the Minister on how he sees  the  status  of\r\n\r\nmadrasahs today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to make is that there has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  lot of zest and enthusiasm among a lot of people  in\r\n\r\nthe  community  to want to play a part or at least  influence\r\n\r\nthe teaching of religion in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschool.    I   would   like  to  ask  the  Minister   whether\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from  the  community  can  be  put  on   the\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education Board because this is where we  can  see\r\n\r\nsome  participation.  Like I say, you cannot have  collective\r\n\r\nleadership   but  you  can  have  very  strong  participatory\r\n\r\ninvolvement  in  this  process.  And because  the  Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation  Board is formed, their involvement  in  the  Board\r\n\r\nwould send a very strong signal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one thing to say that we hope the madrasahs would\r\n\r\ncontinue  to prosper, but it is another thing to do something\r\n\r\nto  ensure that it prospers.  The madrasahs need to be a  bit\r\n\r\nmore well-funded. The facilities are usually not so good. The\r\n\r\nteachers are not that well-paid.  How more assistance can  be\r\n\r\ndirected  to ensure their continued survival, maybe  not  for\r\n\r\nall,  but  at least for some selected madrasahs, is something\r\n\r\nthat  may be necessary at this stage. The madrasahs  must  be\r\n\r\ngiven  the  vital ingredients to ensure success.  By  leaving\r\n\r\nthem  on their own, I am afraid the success of the madrasahs'\r\n\r\nsurvival might be quite questionable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I observe a small loophole in the case of home-school. I would like to ask the Minister how that exemption\r\n\r\nwould  be  exercised because in other countries, in Malaysia,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  it  is  very hard  for  them.   You  can  stop\r\n\r\nmadrasahs  but you cannot stop pondok schools,  five  or  six\r\n\r\nfellows  in a small corner being tutored by one person.  That\r\n\r\ncould  be  interpreted as home school as well.  In a  way,  a\r\n\r\nsmall  madrasah can emerge out of home school, and  how  that\r\n\r\nwill be seen by the authorities as they seek for exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development and Sports and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Community Development and Sports and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> Sir, I thought I would join the debate at this juncture\r\n\r\nbecause  there  have been some issues raised  about  madrasah\r\n\r\neducation which I think, as the Minister-in-charge of  Muslim\r\n\r\nAffairs, I ought to address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Messrs Yatiman, Hawazi and\r\n\r\nZulkifli for their support of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Bill.

In actual  fact,  Government\r\n\r\nrecognises  the importance of madrasahs for the  Muslims  and\r\n\r\nthe   importance   of   religious  education   for   Muslims.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it was never the intention of Government to  close\r\n\r\ndown   madrasahs  and  far  from  Compulsory   Education   or\r\n\r\nlegislation  being  a  reason or  an  excuse  to  close  down\r\n\r\nmadrasahs.   The  Prime Minister himself  had  several  times\r\n\r\nassured  the  community  that it was never  the  Government's\r\n\r\nintention  to  close  down madrasahs.  And  at  two  specific\r\n\r\nmeetings  with  the  madrasahs  and  other  stakeholders   of\r\n\r\nmadrasah education, Prime Minister reiterated the point,  and\r\n\r\nI  would  also like, on behalf of the Government to reiterate\r\n\r\nthe  point  again  here, that it was never the  intention  of\r\n\r\nGovernment to close down madrasahs and there was no  ploy  to\r\n\r\nclose down madrasahs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the input and feedback from the community, the\r\n\r\nGovernment has agreed to exempt madrasahs from the Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation  system,  provided that they meet  certain  minimum\r\n\r\nPSLE  benchmarks  which they themselves would  have  set  and\r\n\r\nwhich  they  themselves would have to agree to. So  far,  the\r\n\r\nmadrasahs  have  agreed  to certain benchmarks  and  that  is\r\n\r\nsomething  that  they will adhere to and  hopefully  that  is\r\n\r\nsomething  which, as time progresses, they will increase;  in\r\n\r\nother words, make the benchmark higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I empathise with the concern of the community and also\r\n\r\nagree with the views of Mr Yatiman and Mr Hawazi on the  need\r\n\r\nfor  the  madrasah  students not only  to  acquire  religious\r\n\r\ninstructions and education, but also for madrasahs to produce\r\n\r\nenough  religious  scholars and religious  teachers  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture.   But,  at  the same time, we must also  ensure  that\r\n\r\nmadrasah  students receive at least some basic  education  to\r\n\r\nensure  that they will be able to prepare themselves for  the\r\n\r\ncoming knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this issue, you have heard of Government's intention\r\n\r\nto  assist one particular madrasah by facilitating some funds\r\n\r\nto  be  given  to  it so that it could be assured  of  having\r\n\r\nenough  good teachers to ensure that the students  are  being\r\n\r\ntaught well in English, Mathematics and Science.  On my part,\r\n\r\nI had also formed a Madrasah Steering Committee last June and\r\n\r\nto-date,  they  have had three meetings. The  most  immediate\r\n\r\ntask which they had to do was to decide on the PSLE benchmark\r\n\r\nwhich  they  did.  Apart from that, the Committee would  also\r\n\r\nlook  into the curriculum of the madrasahs, not only  of  the\r\n\r\nassisted  one,  but  also of the other five.  There  are  six\r\n\r\nmadrasahs  in  all.  They will also look into  the  necessary\r\n\r\ntraining  of  the teachers to ensure that they  are  equipped\r\n\r\nwith  the  necessary knowledge to teach English,  Mathematics\r\n\r\nand Science properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Steering Committee would also look into financial\r\n\r\nhelp.  This is what the Nominated Member alluded to about the\r\n\r\nkind  of  help that could be given to madrasahs.  We will  be\r\n\r\nlooking  into  the financial aspect of not only the  assisted\r\n\r\nmadrasahs  but also the other madrasahs, in other words,  all\r\n\r\nthe  six madrasahs, to ensure that they will be provided with\r\n\r\nsufficient funds so that they can carry out a proper  system,\r\n\r\nhave  enough  trained teachers in order to achieve  the  twin\r\n\r\ngoals  of producing religious teachers and also, at the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  providing  themselves with enough basic  education  to\r\n\r\nprepare  them  for the knowledge-based age.   As  the  Member\r\n\r\nrightly  mentioned,  we  have to  provide  a  proper  balance\r\n\r\nbetween  the  economic  and the spiritual  for  the  madrasah\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Committee will also look into the management\r\n\r\nof  madrasahs  to  ensure  that they are  professionally  and\r\n\r\nproperly  managed  so that they would fit themselves,  as  it\r\n\r\nwere, into the whole Compulsory Education environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I would like to urge the community to\r\n\r\nlook  forward,  instead of dwelling on  the  past  about  the\r\n\r\nconcerns and worries.  I think we have gone beyond\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat.  The  thing to do now is to look forward and to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  we  set  up the system and infrastructure so  that  the\r\n\r\nmadrasahs  will be able to deliver and achieve a balance,  as\r\n\r\nthe  Member  mentioned  earlier, between  the  needs  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy and the spiritual needs of the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the representation on the Compulsory Education\r\n\r\nBoard,  I will leave it to my colleague, RAdm Teo, to answer.\r\n\r\nAs  to  the comment on AMP's collective leadership  issue,  I\r\n\r\nthink it is beyond this debate for us to discuss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nsince  time immemorial, bringing up children has always  been\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility  of the parents. There  is  a  well-known\r\n\r\nChinese  saying  that  \"If a child  is  brought  up  but  not\r\n\r\neducated,  the fault lies with the father.\" This  has  become\r\n\r\nthe  philosophy adopted by most parents in the upbringing  of\r\n\r\ntheir  children.  Moreover, parents nowadays  have  a  common\r\n\r\nexpectation  that  their children would  grow  up  to  become\r\n\r\nsomebody  of importance and to do well in life.   The  future\r\n\r\nprogress  and prosperity of the nation depends on whether  we\r\n\r\ncould  comprehensively raise the level  and  quality  of  the\r\n\r\neducation of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interest of the people and the future of our\r\n\r\nnation,  the Government has been devoting substantial  energy\r\n\r\nand resources to develop our education system.  Well-equipped\r\n\r\nprimary and secondary schools with full facilities are  built\r\n\r\nall  over the island, to ensure that every child in Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  have  the  opportunity  to receive  a  holistic  formal\r\n\r\neducation in comfortable school campuses.   This benefits not\r\n\r\nonly our own people but also attracts a lot of foreigners  to\r\n\r\ntry  all means to send their children to Singapore to receive\r\n\r\nour primary and secondary education.  Therefore, I am puzzled\r\n\r\nand saddened by the fact that some parents are still refusing\r\n\r\nto  send  their children to school to receive the most  basic\r\n\r\nprimary education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a progressive and civilised country, we have all the\r\n\r\nconditions   and  responsibilities  to  ensure   that   every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  child would be given the opportunity  to  go  to\r\n\r\nschool happily, like all the children in their neighbourhood,\r\n\r\nand  to  enjoy an enriching school life.  This is  a  special\r\n\r\nprivilege of the children of every Singapore citizen, and the\r\n\r\nhappiness  they are entitled to enjoy.   I therefore  support\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  to  prevent irresponsible parents  from  depriving\r\n\r\ntheir children of the opportunity to receive formal education\r\n\r\nin   school,  thereby  causing  them  to  face  the   serious\r\n\r\nconsequences  later  on in life when  they  want  to  go  for\r\n\r\nfurther studies or look for employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in his Second Reading speech, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education pointed out the two key objectives  of\r\n\r\nthe  Compulsory  Education Bill. The first objective  is   to\r\n\r\ngive  our  children  a  common core of knowledge  which  will\r\n\r\nprovide  a  strong  foundation  for  further  education   and\r\n\r\ntraining  to prepare them for a knowledge-based economy.   On\r\n\r\nthis point, I feel that Compulsory Education should be for  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  10  years rather than just six years  of  primary\r\n\r\neducation. In the era of new economy and new technologies, in\r\n\r\norder  to make a living in  society, a  child should have  at\r\n\r\nleast 10 years of education in primary and secondary schools.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the majority in our workforce has only primary\r\n\r\nschool education. They  have to depend on the Government  and\r\n\r\nthe  enterprises to provide them with  opportunities for  re-education in order to upgrade their level of knowledge.   The\r\n\r\nlong-term  solution  is to implement 10 years  of  Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation  to  lay down a strong educational  foundation  for\r\n\r\neverybody,  thereby generally raising his or her  educational\r\n\r\nlevel.   In  this  way, we would not have to spend  too  much\r\n\r\ntime, energy and money later on to provide the remedies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we should also pay special attention\r\n\r\nto  children  of  special  needs,  such  as  the  handicapped\r\n\r\nchildren, mentally handicapped or otherwise.  They should  be\r\n\r\ngiven the opportunity to a longer period of education so that\r\n\r\nthey could have more support and a stronger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfoundation  to enable them to become self-reliant in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other key objective that the Minister for Education\r\n\r\nseeks   to  reinforce  is  to  give  our  children  a  common\r\n\r\neducational  experience  which will help  to  build  national\r\n\r\nidentity and cohesion.  This is a very noble political ideal,\r\n\r\nbut  it  is  not  easy  for every young child  to  grasp  and\r\n\r\ncomprehend this ideal within a short period of six  years  in\r\n\r\nthe primary school.  On this basis, I would like to reiterate\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  all  the  more  necessary  for  our  Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation to be fixed at 10 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the objective of education is not\r\n\r\nconfined  to imparting knowledge and cultivating a  sense  of\r\n\r\nbelonging of the people.  A  sound and ideal education system\r\n\r\nshould embody a clear and firm goal to inculcate in our  next\r\n\r\ngeneration the correct outlook on life, moral values and good\r\n\r\ntraditional and cultural values that have been passed on from\r\n\r\ngeneration to generation before us. These excellent qualities\r\n\r\nwill  enable our children and their children to have  rounded\r\n\r\nphysical  and spiritual development, so that they would  have\r\n\r\nthe strong will power to counter any undesirable influence or\r\n\r\nemerging challenges in the new age.  In the absence  of  this\r\n\r\nobjective, any form of Compulsory Education will  not  go  to\r\n\r\nthe  root  of  the  matter to effectively  inspire  the  next\r\n\r\ngeneration  to  strive to achieve greater  success  in  life,\r\n\r\nthereby enhancing the quality of education of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I would like to urge the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nto  avoid  putting too much emphasis on science,  mathematics\r\n\r\nand  technical  knowledge  at the expense  of   physical  and\r\n\r\nspiritual  development and moral education  when  formulating\r\n\r\npolicies   and  curriculum  for  the  primary  and  secondary\r\n\r\nschools.   The  Government intends to increase its  education\r\n\r\nbudget  from the present $6 billion or 3.6% of GDP  to   $7.5\r\n\r\nbillion  or  4.5%  of  GDP.   I hope  that  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  will be resolute in putting into optimum  use  the\r\n\r\nrich resources to fortify the important task in this respect,\r\n\r\nand to ensure that every\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporean  child  is  provided  with  10  years  of   free,\r\n\r\ncompulsory  and  effective  basic education,  in  order  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  continue  to enjoy  sustained  progress  and\r\n\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.38 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, nowadays, it is trendy for people to talk about\r\n\r\nthe  \"new economy\".  Every day, in the newspapers, we read  a\r\n\r\nlot  of reports or articles on the new economy.  Recently,  I\r\n\r\nread  in  the newspapers that Dr Tan Chin Nam, the  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary of the Ministry of Manpower described this  era  as\r\n\r\nthe \"new economy era\", one which   requires a high degree  of\r\n\r\ntransparency and a brand-new environment to get things  done.\r\n\r\nIt is under this new environment that we are debating here on\r\n\r\nthe question of Compulsory Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many foreigners who do not know Singapore well, they\r\n\r\nthink  that we are very backward and remote.  They may  think\r\n\r\nthat many children in Singapore are not attending school  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  why  the  Government has  to  introduce  Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation  now.   In fact, we have 97% of students  in  every\r\n\r\ncohort   registering  for enrolment to the  primary  schools.\r\n\r\nThis  percentage is comparable to Australia, Hong Kong, Korea\r\n\r\nand  Taiwan which have introduced compulsory education  many,\r\n\r\nmany  years ago.  In the Chinese community in Singapore, many\r\n\r\npeople   told  me   that  they  thought  there  was   already\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education in Singapore.  They feel that it is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  introduce legislation to  make  education  for\r\n\r\nchildren  compulsory in Singapore.  As a matter of  fact,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, most parents have brought upon themselves  to  see\r\n\r\nto  it  that  their children not only  go to a  good  primary\r\n\r\nschool, but even to a renowned kindergarten before that.   It\r\n\r\nis  not uncommon to see  many parents queuing up overnight to\r\n\r\nget   a   place  for  their  children  in  the  more  popular\r\n\r\nkindergartens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, when we are talking about Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation,  our  main  concern is  on  the  3%  who  are  not\r\n\r\nreceiving  formal  education under our mainstream  education,\r\n\r\nand  how they are going to face the future challenges in  the\r\n\r\nnew economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill and the recommendation of the\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  Compulsory Education that those attending  the\r\n\r\nmadrasahs  and  San  Yu  Adventist School  be  exempted  from\r\n\r\nCompulsory  Education.  In a multi-racial and multi-religious\r\n\r\nsociety, racial harmony and inter-religious tolerance have to\r\n\r\nbe  exercised. This has been entrenched in the recommendation\r\n\r\nof the Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Compulsory Education of six years is practical,\r\n\r\nnot 10 years or 12 years.  The reason is very simple, because\r\n\r\nwe are a progressive society.  We are upgrading ourselves all\r\n\r\nthe  time.   As  it  is,  only 3% of each  cohort  failed  to\r\n\r\nregister  for  places  in the primary schools  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere  are actually more than 80% in each cohort who  go  all\r\n\r\nthe  way to complete their secondary education, and more than\r\n\r\n60% completed their tertiary education.  It is envisaged that\r\n\r\nthese percentages will be further improved every year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small group of students drop out after primary school.\r\n\r\nThey  either do not want to study or lack the ability  to  do\r\n\r\nso.   If we force them to remain in school, there will  be  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  difficulties administratively and in the enforcement\r\n\r\nof  discipline  on  them. This is one  consideration  of  the\r\n\r\nCommittee when debating on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of families in Singapore support\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education.  In a feedback dialogue session that  I\r\n\r\nconducted, most of the people feel that there should be 6  to\r\n\r\n10  years of Compulsory Education.  Nominated Member  Mr  Tay\r\n\r\nBeng  Chuan  has suggested 10 years.  I believe this  is  the\r\n\r\ncollective view of the Chinese community in Singapore.   Most\r\n\r\nof  the  representatives  of the  Chinese  community  in  the\r\n\r\ndialogue session felt that we  should not be too harsh with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparents  who  violated  the provisions under  the  Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation  Act.   We should look into the   circumstances  of\r\n\r\neach  and every case.   If the children do not wish to study,\r\n\r\nthere  is nothing  their parents, the principal and even  the\r\n\r\npolice could do to confine them in the school.  Therefore, it\r\n\r\nis  no  point setting up an impractical target.  I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould   have  a  more  realistic  target.   I  support   the\r\n\r\nrecommendation of six years' Compulsory Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of the new economy is affecting every\r\n\r\nsector of our society.  Those who are not adequately equipped\r\n\r\nare  blaming themselves for not having enough education,  and\r\n\r\nlife is difficult for them.  Yet, in the new economy, even if\r\n\r\nwe  are well educated, we are not guaranteed a good job.  The\r\n\r\ncomputer,  the   Internet  and information  technology   have\r\n\r\nchanged our whole competitive environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, we said that Government policies changed\r\n\r\nvery  fast  -  \"One small change every three years,  and  one\r\n\r\nbig  change  every five years.\"   But now,  in  the  IT  era,\r\n\r\nchanges  are taking place every day.  The new environment  is\r\n\r\nchanging   very  rapidly.   Compulsory  Education   will   be\r\n\r\nimplemented in Singapore in three years' time.  By that  time\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  predict what will be the competitive  environment\r\n\r\nthen.   But  one  thing we can say for sure is  that  if  our\r\n\r\nyounger  generation  of  students  do  not  have  the   basic\r\n\r\nknowledge in mathematics, English and science, they will  not\r\n\r\nbe able to cope with the many challenges in  the new economy.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  suggest  that when the Ministry  of  Education\r\n\r\nstart  to  implement Compulsory Education, they  should  also\r\n\r\nanticipate  the problems that will follow the implementation.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  Chinese  saying to the  effect  that  when  you\r\n\r\nencounter  difficulties,  you  make  changes  and  look   for\r\n\r\nalternatives.  Once  you  find  the  right  alternative,  the\r\n\r\nproblem is solved. In other words, we make changes when there\r\n\r\nare  difficulties.  Even when we have started implementation,\r\n\r\nwe have to make changes to adapt to the new circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong alleged that almost all members in the\r\n\r\nCommittee are PAP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers.   I  do not agree with him.  If he bothers  to  read\r\n\r\nthis  Report  of  the  Committee on Compulsory  Education  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   he will see that more than half of  the  members\r\n\r\nconstituting the Committee are educationists.  Even  for  the\r\n\r\nMembers  of Parliament who are in the Committee, we represent\r\n\r\ndifferent    communities  in our society.   For  example,  Mr\r\n\r\nHawazi  represents the Malay community and  I  represent  the\r\n\r\nChinese community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In implementing Compulsory Education, the emphasis of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Education should be on how  to  reduce  the\r\n\r\nattrition  rate  in the secondary schools  and  the  tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions.   We  always lament the  lack  of  talents  and\r\n\r\nemphasise   that  everybody  has  opportunities  to   improve\r\n\r\nthemselves  in Singapore.  Compulsory Education  will  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  every Singapore student has an equal opportunity to  be\r\n\r\neducated to meet with the challenges of the new economy.  So,\r\n\r\nif  the Ministry of Education can do something to reduce  the\r\n\r\nattrition  rate  in the secondary and tertiary  levels,  then\r\n\r\nmore people will benefit from the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nin  support  of the Compulsory Education Bill  moved  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education.  First and foremost, it is my  belief\r\n\r\nthat  this  Bill is quite overdue, considering  that  we  are\r\n\r\nalready  plugged to the globalised world and  also  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  reasonably aware of the  dramatic  changes  in\r\n\r\neducation  happening in the United States and other  advanced\r\n\r\neconomies.  But as the saying goes, it is better late and, in\r\n\r\nour case, perhaps slightly late, than never.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the importance of providing an increasingly higher\r\n\r\nquality  of  education  that could  enable  all  children  to\r\n\r\nsucceed  in  their  future careers is  becoming  increasingly\r\n\r\napparent.   The amount and quality of education an individual\r\n\r\nreceives  not  only  affects his earnings  but,  increasingly\r\n\r\nevident, the quality of his employment as well.  According to\r\n\r\nJacob Mincer in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis  book  Studies  in Human Capital, educated  workers  have\r\n\r\nthree  advantages relative to less educated  workers.   These\r\n\r\nare  higher  wages, greater employment stability and  greater\r\n\r\nupward mobility in income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two factors which contribute to increased\r\n\r\nearnings  of  workers with higher education levels  -  first,\r\n\r\nincreased  human capital results in higher productivity  that\r\n\r\nallows workers to earn higher wages. Second, higher education\r\n\r\nlevels  in turn increase labour force participation, decrease\r\n\r\nthe  probability  of  unemployment,  and  also  decrease  job\r\n\r\nturnover. It follows, therefore, that highly educated workers\r\n\r\nput  in  a greater number of hours annually for higher hourly\r\n\r\nwages   in   comparison  to  less  educated   labour   market\r\n\r\ncompetitors.  In other words, higher wages for better quality\r\n\r\njobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore transforms into a knowledge-based and\r\n\r\ninformation-driven  economy,  it  is  imperative  that   high\r\n\r\nquality  education  ranks  high  in  our  priorities.  It  is\r\n\r\ninevitable  that income gaps will widen, but we  must  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  a  quality  education  is  secured  for  all  children,\r\n\r\nincluding  those from disadvantaged backgrounds,  to  prevent\r\n\r\nthe emergence of an underclass in our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been proven in advanced economies that the more\r\n\r\neducation  individuals  acquire, the  better  will  be  their\r\n\r\nlikelihood  to absorb new information, acquire new  knowledge\r\n\r\nand  skills and familiarise themselves with new technologies.\r\n\r\nBy  investing in human capital, workers are able to  increase\r\n\r\ntheir  labour  productivity and that of  other  capital  they\r\n\r\nemploy at their workplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If increased productivity reflects higher levels of\r\n\r\nhuman  capital,  which are primarily a  result  of  increased\r\n\r\neducation, it follows that a positive relationship is  likely\r\n\r\nbetween  educational  attainment  and  earnings.  The  United\r\n\r\nStates  Census Bureau, in its 1998 study of individuals  aged\r\n\r\n25  and  older  by  educational attainment, reported  that  a\r\n\r\nbachelor's  degree  holder tends to earn US$20,000  more  per\r\n\r\nannum compared to the average high school graduate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the investment costs of education, evidence\r\n\r\nin  the US again indicates that a tremendous increase in  the\r\n\r\nvalue of schooling has occurred since 1979.  According  to  a\r\n\r\nprivate study by two researchers at Princeton University, the\r\n\r\nreturn  to an additional year of education rose from 6.2%  in\r\n\r\n1979  to about 10% as far back as 1993. Recent trends in  the\r\n\r\nnew  economy clearly show that the demand for high levels  of\r\n\r\nhuman  capital  is  steadily  rising,  which  correspondingly\r\n\r\nincrease the future financial returns to education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are also other intangible benefits tied to\r\n\r\nthe effect of better and higher quality education. Apart from\r\n\r\nincreased   earnings,  individuals  with  higher  educational\r\n\r\nqualifications  also tend to look after their  health  better\r\n\r\nthan  those  with lower education. They tend to  protect  the\r\n\r\ninvestment   in  themselves  by  taking  greater   preventive\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  increase  the  probability  of  better  health.\r\n\r\nIndividual initiatives such as regular annual medical  check-ups,  proper eating habits and regular exercise can  also  be\r\n\r\nlooked  upon  as  investments in  the  maintenance  of  human\r\n\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of education is usually also extended to\r\n\r\ntheir  loved  ones. There is generally a positive association\r\n\r\nbetween  an individual's level of schooling and his  family's\r\n\r\nhealth status and overall well-being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis on education of the last several decades\r\n\r\nhas  enabled  Singaporeans  to be  better  fathers,  mothers,\r\n\r\nchildren,  citizens  and responsible  voters.  Investment  in\r\n\r\neducation   has   also   generated  positive   \"neighbourhood\r\n\r\neffects\",  ie,  outcomes that yield significant  benefits  to\r\n\r\nothers. As Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman puts it, \"a  stable\r\n\r\nand democratic society is impossible without a minimum degree\r\n\r\nof  literacy  and knowledge on the part of the  citizens  and\r\n\r\nwithout  widespread acceptance of some common set of  values.\r\n\r\nEducation can contribute to both.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also strong correlation between educational\r\n\r\nattainment  and items associated with a stable and democratic\r\n\r\nsociety,  ie,  informed  and interested  voters.  The  better\r\n\r\npeople  are educated, the more they want to be kept  informed\r\n\r\nabout  the  issues and the environment surrounding them,  and\r\n\r\nthe more active will be their interest in public affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the advent of the new knowledge-based economy is\r\n\r\nrapidly  evolving a new kind of information fabric  in  which\r\n\r\nlearning, working and playing co-mingle with each other.  The\r\n\r\nWorld   Wide  Web,  in  particular,  is  proving  to   be   a\r\n\r\ntransformative medium, as important as electricity was  first\r\n\r\ndiscovered more than a century ago.  Most noticeable  is  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  the Web is two-way, in contrast with the  one-way\r\n\r\nmedia  we  have  all  been familiar  with  -  from  books  to\r\n\r\nnewspapers  to television. It combines the one-way  reach  of\r\n\r\nbroadcast  with  the two-way reciprocity of a  mid-cast.  Its\r\n\r\nuser  can  at  once be a receiver and sender of  \"broadcast\".\r\n\r\nThis  will  present a new set of dimensions and shifts  along\r\n\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first has to do with literacy and how it is\r\n\r\nevolving. Literacy today is not only concerned with text  but\r\n\r\nalso  image  and  screen literacy. This new literacy,  beyond\r\n\r\ntext and image, is concerned with information navigation. The\r\n\r\nreal literacy of tomorrow entails the ability to be one's own\r\n\r\npersonal  reference  librarian -  to  know  how  to  navigate\r\n\r\nthrough  complex  and  confusing data  and  information,  and\r\n\r\nfeeling comfortable about doing so. \"Navigation\", Sir, may be\r\n\r\nthe main form of literacy in this new 21st century we are in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next dimension concerns learning. We are all\r\n\r\naccustomed to formal learning in a lecture-oriented classroom\r\n\r\nsetting.  Now,  with  large amounts of information  available\r\n\r\nthrough  the Web, we are finding a new kind of learning  that\r\n\r\nis  assuming pre-eminence - learning that is discovery-based.\r\n\r\nWe  are constantly discovering new things, new information as\r\n\r\nwe surf and browse through the emergent digital libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know the Minister for Education and his Ministry\r\n\r\nare  doing  everything  within their  means  to  prepare  our\r\n\r\nchildren  for  these new dimensions. This Bill is  therefore,\r\n\r\nimportant and I cannot imagine anyone not supporting  it.  It\r\n\r\nis  clearly  noted in the Bill that one of the key objectives\r\n\r\nis to equip our children with a strong educational foundation\r\n\r\nthat  will  enable  them to pursue life long  learning  in  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is for madrasah students who will be given\r\n\r\nexemption from Compulsory Education. While I truly appreciate\r\n\r\nthe  Government's sensitivity in accommodating the  needs  of\r\n\r\nthe   Muslim  community  to  exempt  madrasah  students  from\r\n\r\nCompulsory   Education,  I  am  worried  of  the   madrasah's\r\n\r\nreadiness  to  evolve an infrastructure that  can  adequately\r\n\r\nprepare  Muslim  children to confront  the  KBE  environment.\r\n\r\nPassing the PSLE is one thing but whether madrasahs can bring\r\n\r\nabout  a  learning  environment that  can  simulate  national\r\n\r\nprimary schools, which incorporate the latest in teaching and\r\n\r\nlearning  techniques, is another. This is a choice  that  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  has  made and as such, it must take responsibility\r\n\r\nto  ensure that the madrasah system is reviewed and  revamped\r\n\r\nso  that  they produce students who are not only  religiously\r\n\r\ninclined  but  also  can comfortably co-exist  in  a  rapidly\r\n\r\nchanging economic and global environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other concerns I have, such as the need to have\r\n\r\nreligious  teachers who are also proficient  in  science  and\r\n\r\nmathematics  and  who could relate with a  globalised  world,\r\n\r\nhave  already  been  addressed by the  Minister-in-charge  of\r\n\r\nMuslim  Affairs and prior speakers in this House or in  other\r\n\r\nforums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, investment in human capital enables\r\n\r\nindividuals  to  increase their future earnings  and  enhance\r\n\r\ntheir  employability in the job market.  In the  information-driven  and  knowledge-based economy  of  the  21st  century,\r\n\r\neducation is of paramount importance. Investment in education\r\n\r\nleads  to  enhanced  productivity  and  paves  the  way   for\r\n\r\nindividuals to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecome  more  responsible citizens and  parents,  apart  from\r\n\r\nbeing better workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, Sir, I wholeheartedly support the Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall be quite brief\r\n\r\nin  what  I have to say.  There is no doubt, of course,  that\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  is  long overdue.  But may I  say  that  this  is\r\n\r\nanother  instance  of  the  PAP Government  introducing  half\r\n\r\nmeasures to meet the problems confronted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last sitting of Parliament I moved a motion on\r\n\r\nthe growing gap between the rich and the poor, and I referred\r\n\r\nto  the  measures  that the Prime Minister announced  at  his\r\n\r\nNational Day Rally as lollipop measures totally inadequate to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  problem that had arisen.  Similarly, I think  this\r\n\r\nBill is a half measure.  Why do I say this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other speakers have referred to the period of six years.\r\n\r\nWe  in  the Workers' Party have called, way back in  1987  or\r\n\r\neven  earlier,  for  a minimum of 10-year education  for  our\r\n\r\nchildren.  Now, 13 to 14 years later, Government still  talks\r\n\r\nabout  a  6-year minimum education.  May I ask  how  is  just\r\n\r\nprimary   education  going  to  prepare  our  children,   our\r\n\r\ncitizens,  for  the 21st century?  Is that enough?   We  have\r\n\r\nheard  a  speaker or two talk about the quality of education,\r\n\r\nabout  the  need  for our children to be  better  and  higher\r\n\r\neducated.   Is  primary  education  adequate?   Why  are   we\r\n\r\nstopping  with  primary education?  Why should  they  not  be\r\n\r\nextended further?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other fact is about the quality. Mr Chiam has\r\n\r\nreferred  to  the  Committee  which  sat  to  consider   this\r\n\r\nCompulsory   Education   Bill   as   consisting   mainly   of\r\n\r\npoliticians.  We have called, again for a long  time,  for  a\r\n\r\nCommission to be appointed to inquire into the whole purpose,\r\n\r\nthe  why and wherefore of education, a Commission which would\r\n\r\nreceive   representations  from  parents   who   are   widely\r\n\r\ninterested  in  the  education of their  children,  from  any\r\n\r\nmember of the society who is interested, and then come\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup  with  what  they  think should be the education  for  our\r\n\r\nchildren in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli talked about collective responsibility but\r\n\r\nhe   seemed  to  be  asking  what  is  meant  by  \"collective\r\n\r\nresponsibility\".  He was suggesting that it has to be left to\r\n\r\nthe   Government   or   to  the  leaders.    The   collective\r\n\r\nresponsibility  lies with our people.  It  is  they  who  are\r\n\r\nresponsible in the end, not the Government or a Committee  or\r\n\r\na  few  people,  but our people as a whole.   The  collective\r\n\r\nresponsibility  lies  with them.  So they  should  have  been\r\n\r\nconsulted  on this. There should have been a public  hearing,\r\n\r\nrepresentations received from people who are interested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is this. Some speakers have spoken\r\n\r\nabout  the  difficulties parents may have  in  sending  their\r\n\r\nchildren  to  school,  and  one of  them  of  course  is  the\r\n\r\nfinancial   restraint,  straitened  financial  circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis  Bill will not achieve its purpose unless, at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime, the Government announces its readiness to take over the\r\n\r\neducation  bill  for  our citizens, particularly  in  primary\r\n\r\nschools.   I do not want to be told that education  is  free,\r\n\r\nbut  what they pay is for something else.  I think we  should\r\n\r\nstop  all this pretence of education being free in Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  should  assure  parents that there  will  be  no  payment\r\n\r\nrequired  at  all  for anything if they wish  to  send  their\r\n\r\nchildren  to  school, at least at the primary  school  level.\r\n\r\nCan  we  not find the money for that?  It is only if  we  are\r\n\r\nprepared to go that far, can we say that we are really intent\r\n\r\nwith one purpose, with one mind, to see that all our children\r\n\r\nare  better  educated and prepared for the future  that  lies\r\n\r\nahead of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I finally touch on this drafting problem, if I may\r\n\r\nsay  so, and that is the Director-General is given permission\r\n\r\nto  exempt  any  child  if the parent  submits  a  prescribed\r\n\r\nreason.   No  guidance is given as to what is the  prescribed\r\n\r\nreason  for  which the parents may be exempted.  Should  that\r\n\r\nnot be spelt out?  At least,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  it  not say that families whose household  income  is\r\n\r\nbelow  $1,500 will be given free education, if  that  is  the\r\n\r\nreason  put  forward by parents that they may have  financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties or problems in sending their children to school?\r\n\r\nSo  I  would  urge  the  Government  to  rethink  about  this\r\n\r\nCompulsory  Education Bill and to bring in a full measure  to\r\n\r\nprovide  free  education  for  children  of  families   whose\r\n\r\nhousehold  income is below $1,500 a month and,  at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  to  rethink whether primary education is good  enough.\r\n\r\nShould  our  children not deserve a bit more  than  just  the\r\n\r\nprimary education?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould like to raise several interconnected issues relating to\r\n\r\nfirst,  the  objective; second, the duration; and third,  the\r\n\r\ncoverage and content of Compulsory Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the context of a broader discussion on how to\r\n\r\nsharpen Singapore's global competitiveness, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  must be congratulated for taking a fresh  approach\r\n\r\ntowards  a  range of issues which impact on the  learnability\r\n\r\nand  creativity  of  students  from  pre-school  to  tertiary\r\n\r\nlevels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of Compulsory Education being introduced at\r\n\r\nthis juncture is therefore timely.

There is no need for me to convince this House that\r\n\r\na  12-year  old is not equipped to face the real world.   For\r\n\r\nthose of us who are parents to teenage children, we know that\r\n\r\nthe ages between 13 and 16 years are critical formative years\r\n\r\nwhen  teenagers  need good instruction, strong  guidance  and\r\n\r\nenforced discipline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the Committee on Compulsory Education in\r\n\r\nJuly  2000 showed that in 1997, there were a total  of  1,677\r\n\r\nchildren  not  registered with national  schools  or  special\r\n\r\neducation  schools  at  the  end of  Primary  1  registration\r\n\r\nexercise.   Apart from those living or studying overseas,  or\r\n\r\nschooling  in  madrasahs, private schools  or  enjoying  home\r\n\r\ntuition,  there  remained 700 children who were  deprived  of\r\n\r\neducation  due  to  family-related  or  individual  problems.\r\n\r\nOther than these unregistered children, there are about 2,000\r\n\r\npremature  school leavers every year, the majority  are  from\r\n\r\nsecondary schools and about 200 are primary school drop-outs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the Compulsory Education policy, as it is,\r\n\r\nwill  affect or sanction a student population of only 200  at\r\n\r\nthe primary level while there are more than a thousand at the\r\n\r\nsecondary level who will fall out of this policy net.   These\r\n\r\nare  unlikely the exact numbers as there will be  more  drop-outs whom we could not track.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this Bill, no adult, including parents or an\r\n\r\ninstitution,  is empowered to compel a recalcitrant  teenager\r\n\r\nto  go  back  to school to get the common core knowledge  for\r\n\r\nfurther   education  and  an  educational  experience   which\r\n\r\nprovides  them  an  outlook in life that  serves  as  rudders\r\n\r\nagainst  an uncertain future.  They are the likely candidates\r\n\r\nfor  becoming  dysfunctional adults.  In  many  countries  in\r\n\r\nEurope,  the current debate is about keeping children  longer\r\n\r\nin school up to 19 years so that the right social outlook and\r\n\r\nvalues  can be inculcated to prepare their youths  for  life,\r\n\r\nnot simply to score 288 points in PSLE examinations!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid the Bill, as it is, falls short of\r\n\r\ntargetting the student population which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  more problematic and critical in our overall concern with\r\n\r\nmanpower   shortage  and  a  growing  digital  divide.    The\r\n\r\nobjective of this Compulsory Education Bill is hence  limited\r\n\r\nin scope and myopic in reach, because it fails to send out  a\r\n\r\nstrong enough signal that a minimum education of at least  10\r\n\r\nyears  to  the equivalent of an 'O' level is what a Singapore\r\n\r\nyouth  must  be assured of and be equipped with to  meet  the\r\n\r\nchallenges of the knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not having had a Compulsory Education Bill for so many\r\n\r\nyears,  if  we  now  adopt one, it should not  be  to  simply\r\n\r\nredress   past  oversights,  but  to  signal  our   society's\r\n\r\nintentions for the future.  If we had this one chance to  fix\r\n\r\na  policy, why not aim for the ideal?  Why instead settle for\r\n\r\npragmatic  compromises, an incremental tweaking of a  policy?\r\n\r\nAnd  for those who say that the State should not compel young\r\n\r\npeople to do things and it should be left to the family, then\r\n\r\nwhy do we have laws governing the social behaviour of minors,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  smoking and drinking?  I would in fact  argue  that\r\n\r\nsanctions  regarding  minimum levels of  education  are  more\r\n\r\nimportant  and have longer and lasting impact than  sanctions\r\n\r\non smoking and drinking!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, parents have the moral responsibility to make\r\n\r\nsure  that  they  have the best interests of their  child  at\r\n\r\nheart  by  sending them to school.  However, on a  matter  as\r\n\r\nsignificant as education which is the cornerstone  of  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding and considering the huge sums of capital as well  as\r\n\r\nhuman  resource investment involved, the State has to  assume\r\n\r\nthe  primary role in shaping the direction and management  of\r\n\r\nthe educational experiences of youths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hong Kong, since the enforcement of Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation up to Form 3 secondary level 20 years ago, only one\r\n\r\ncase  has  been brought to court and the parent was convicted\r\n\r\nwith a fine of HK$400.  The student resumed school after  the\r\n\r\nsentence.   In  the  past 10 years, 23 warning  letters  were\r\n\r\nissued to parents who failed to bring their children back to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschool without reasonable excuse.  No court proceedings  were\r\n\r\nnecessary  because all parents complied with the requirements\r\n\r\nof the attendance orders.  This information was obtained from\r\n\r\nthe  Education  and Manpower Bureau in December  1999.   Sir,\r\n\r\nonly with a Compulsory Education policy can we guarantee that\r\n\r\na  youth will stay in school to be protected from the  snares\r\n\r\nof  street gangs.  By compelling parents to act, a compulsory\r\n\r\nschool   education   restores,   not   take   away   parental\r\n\r\nresponsibility.   And  if  finance  is  an  issue,  let   the\r\n\r\ncommunity  step  in to help.  Judging from  the  pocket  fund\r\n\r\ninitiative   organised  by  the  Straits  Times   -   and   I\r\n\r\ncongratulate  their success - we note that  Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\ngenerous  and  they will contribute to help a child  get  the\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to rethink the extent of coverage\r\n\r\nof  this  policy and if this House today so decides that  the\r\n\r\nBill  is  sufficient, and I am a reluctant consenter  to  it,\r\n\r\nthen  I would request for serious intervention effort by  the\r\n\r\nschool  administrators to reinforce counselling  services  in\r\n\r\nschools or work with parents and neighbourhood VWOs to  track\r\n\r\nschool  leavers at the secondary level to try to  bring  them\r\n\r\nback to school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that schools are already working hard toward this\r\n\r\ndirection, and projects like Project Bridge organised by  the\r\n\r\nNational  Youth Council are targeting this problematic  youth\r\n\r\nsegment.  But I also know that their effort will be  all  the\r\n\r\nmore  effective and fruitful if they are backed by  a  strong\r\n\r\nGovernment policy and adequate community resources  committed\r\n\r\nto   upholding  a  compulsory  policy.   The  importance   of\r\n\r\ncontinuing  secondary school in reforming young offenders  is\r\n\r\nshown  in  studies  on  the  after-conduct  of  a  cohort  of\r\n\r\nprobationers.   The  report published by MCDS  in  July  1999\r\n\r\nshowed  that  probationers  with post-primary  education  had\r\n\r\nconsistently higher completion rates than those with  primary\r\n\r\neducation, and those with upper secondary education were more\r\n\r\nlikely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan  those with lower secondary education to complete  their\r\n\r\nprobation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that we commit resources to provide for youth\r\n\r\ndrop-outs  to  attend  some  kind  of  courses  or   academic\r\n\r\ninstitutions which are able to help them realise  their  life\r\n\r\ninterests   apart   from  pure  academic   pursuits.    Here,\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education at the secondary level would take  on  a\r\n\r\nmore  flexible perspective.  As long as a teenager  under  16\r\n\r\nwho  dropped  out  of  a  mainstream school  due  to  various\r\n\r\npersonal,  family  and  academic  reasons,  continues  to  be\r\n\r\nengaged   in   an   accredited  teaching   institution,   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  government-run secondary  schools,  to  learn  a\r\n\r\nskill,  a vocation, an art or other subjects of interest,  he\r\n\r\nor  she  has  more of a chance to become a useful and  worthy\r\n\r\nSingaporean  in the long run.  Denmark's continuation  school\r\n\r\nand  liberal  education  curriculum  catering  to  youths  of\r\n\r\ndiverse needs and aptitudes as well as a diverse programme in\r\n\r\nchallenging  the  gifted and building the capacities  of  the\r\n\r\naverage  student  in  the  US are  good  case  studies  worth\r\n\r\nlearning from.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By creating more teaching and learning institutions of a\r\n\r\nbroader  range to meet the diverse and changing  expectations\r\n\r\nof  the  growing  numbers of \"Generation  Y\"  youth  -  those\r\n\r\ncurrently  under  20  years old - we  will  not  risk  losing\r\n\r\nprecious   human   resources  due  to  a  restricted   school\r\n\r\nassessment   structure,  but  instead   we   will   gain   by\r\n\r\ncomplementing the mainstream education structure  with  other\r\n\r\nflexible,   open   curriculum   which   taps   the   multiple\r\n\r\nintelligences and interests of our young population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also clearly uphold the fundamental principle of\r\n\r\nmeritocracy  which our society thrives on and that  is  -  to\r\n\r\neach  according to his or her own capability; and live up  to\r\n\r\nthe  S21  promise  that  everyone  counts,  by  helping  each\r\n\r\nindividual  structures  his or her  learning.   This  is  one\r\n\r\ncritical step in bridging the digital divide between the more-educated and the less-educated in a KBE.  It achieves  in  an\r\n\r\noverall  sense,  an  even higher level goal  beyond  economic\r\n\r\nones, that is, the goal of educating for the good society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn now to the exemption of children who have\r\n\r\ndisabilities  or  special  needs.  I  agree  that  Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation  must have exemptions as long as we  put  in  place\r\n\r\nsafeguards on setting the appropriate standards.  However,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to know how is the term \"children  with  special\r\n\r\nneeds\"  being  defined.  How do we balance the  judgement  of\r\n\r\nparents  with that of an educationist or vice versa,  in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  a  marginal  child who has merely  slower  learning\r\n\r\ncapabilities but not limiting enough to stay home or attend a\r\n\r\nschool  for the mentally challenged?  The Bill is  silent  in\r\n\r\ndefining this category and in imposing restrictions on  those\r\n\r\nparents who neglect to send their children under the cover of\r\n\r\ngiving them \"home tuition\".  Will the Ministry of Education's\r\n\r\nexperts  be  the final decision-maker, or a panel of  outside\r\n\r\nexperts?  It would be useful to have this spelled out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to read in the Straits Times an informative\r\n\r\nreply  by  Mrs  Mok Choon Hoe from the Ministry of  Education\r\n\r\nabout the development of nine more schools for children  with\r\n\r\nspecial needs.  It reflects the Ministry's strong signal that\r\n\r\nthe  State regards them as a precious resource and  does  not\r\n\r\nshirk  from  its responsibility in giving them the  education\r\n\r\nthat they rightly deserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope that some of these schools are built next to\r\n\r\nthe mainstream national schools to minimise the social stigma\r\n\r\nand   exclusion   of   children  already  disadvantaged,   by\r\n\r\nencouraging some designated area of shared activity and study\r\n\r\nto  enhance peer interaction and motivation.  Another concept\r\n\r\nof  a  satellite  school, meaning a special school  within  a\r\n\r\nschool  catering  to  the  moderately  handicapped  class  of\r\n\r\nchildren who will not benefit from the segregated schools for\r\n\r\nthe  severely handicapped but also cannot completely cope  in\r\n\r\nmainstream schools either, would be very welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is sufficient evidence, Sir, that children with\r\n\r\nmoderate learning disabilities thrive under mainstream school\r\n\r\nsettings  and  interacting with other  children;  over  time,\r\n\r\nthese children will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrow  up to be useful citizens, and less of a liability to  a\r\n\r\nsociety.  In the USA, for example, between 1986 and 1996, the\r\n\r\npercentage of children with disabilities who were educated in\r\n\r\nregular classrooms increased from 26% to 45%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry will broaden its multi-tier approach\r\n\r\nto  special  education  by encouraging  and  committing  more\r\n\r\nresources  to  schools which wish to integrate children  with\r\n\r\nspecial  needs within a normal teaching programme.  Empirical\r\n\r\nevidence  has shown that this integration benefits  even  the\r\n\r\nadvanced  students who will learn to respect differences  and\r\n\r\nreach  out  to  offer a helping hand.  This  is  a  start  in\r\n\r\nnurturing  graciousness,  a subject  that  Dr  Lily  Neo  had\r\n\r\neloquently spoke about in the last session.  I make one  plea\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister,  to put the agenda of the  integration  of\r\n\r\nchildren  with  special needs in mainstream  schools  as  one\r\n\r\npriority  in  his  next  plan  on  the  desired  outcome   of\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to a slightly different, but no less\r\n\r\ncontroversial  issue.   In the context of  fixing  compulsory\r\n\r\nschool  attendance  at  primary  school  level,  is   it   an\r\n\r\nopportunity for the Minister to rethink the school assessment\r\n\r\nsystem  by  examining if the streaming exercise is  disabling\r\n\r\nstudents from wanting to go to school and killing the joy  of\r\n\r\nlearning  far  too  early?  Surely, it  is  not  an  intended\r\n\r\noutcome  that  our  educational machinery becomes  a  sorting\r\n\r\ndevice  that  celebrates the examination-smart  ones  at  the\r\n\r\nexpense  of committing emotional damage to children as  young\r\n\r\nas nine years old who have other kind of aptitudes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can we think out of this habitual box which entraps\r\n\r\nour thinking, and look at other ways of enhancing competences\r\n\r\nand skills without channelling children into gifted, express,\r\n\r\nnormal,  above-average,  average and  below-average  streams?\r\n\r\nCertainly, for the past two decades, we spoke of our students\r\n\r\nas  digits  in  an  industrial economy,  as  manpower  to  be\r\n\r\nefficiently produced for industrial needs.  But, surely, when\r\n\r\nwe now talk about creativity and maximizing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  young  peoples'  potential in a knowledge-based  economy\r\n\r\nwhere  they will undergo several different careers  in  their\r\n\r\nlifetimes, some of which have not even been created - how can\r\n\r\nstreaming be appropriate for this new environment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streaming at an early age has been controversial for\r\n\r\nmany  years,  but  it has always been a  sacred  cow  of  the\r\n\r\nEducation Ministry.  If we are to start from first principles\r\n\r\nnow  and examine every aspect of our education system, I urge\r\n\r\nthat  we re-examine streaming and, at the very least,  modify\r\n\r\nit  substantially.  The recent report by the Teachers'  Union\r\n\r\npublished  on  15th September, offered numerous insights  and\r\n\r\ndiscussions  on the principles of education which  are  worth\r\n\r\nreflecting  upon.  Some aspects of our education system  need\r\n\r\nto  undergo  creative destruction.  With declining fertility,\r\n\r\nit  is  all  the  more  important to  focus  on  every  young\r\n\r\nSingaporean,  and maximise his or her full  potential.   That\r\n\r\npotential, I would argue, is certainly more than a Primary  4\r\n\r\nor   6  education.   Let  us  make  sure  that  every  single\r\n\r\nSingaporean completes a qualifying education programme up  to\r\n\r\n16  years old - is that too ambitious or unrealistic a  goal,\r\n\r\nSir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, may I be permitted to seek a\r\n\r\nclarification  from  Mdm  Claire  Chiang?

Claire Chiang has given such a  long\r\n\r\nexposition  on the whole issue so I shall be very  brief,  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill on Compulsory Education in principle.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have a few reservations to make, which I hope will\r\n\r\nbe addressed by the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a very simple question that I will ask is: why\r\n\r\nshould  we  make  education  for children  compulsory  up  to\r\n\r\nPrimary  6?  The issue is very simple, but I think there  are\r\n\r\ncomplex  problems related to this.  I hope we are not  giving\r\n\r\nthe  wrong  signal  to  people  that  we  now  have  a  lower\r\n\r\nexpectation in education.  I am afraid that such a  benchmark\r\n\r\nis  not  in  sync  with our aspirations to make  Singapore  a\r\n\r\nlearning  nation and give priority to educate people  to  the\r\n\r\nfullest.   Sir, fixing Compulsory Education at Primary  6  is\r\n\r\njust saying to some people, \"Play in the primary league, that\r\n\r\nis  enough\".  I hope this is not the thing that  we  want  to\r\n\r\npromote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, surely we can be more ambitious than that. What\r\n\r\nhas happened to our Singapore 21 drive?  That, Sir, is what I\r\n\r\nam asking.  I think we should be bold and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmake education compulsory up to at least Secondary 3, if  not\r\n\r\nSecondary 4.  This is at least to ensure that we have a  more\r\n\r\neducated  workforce  and  prevent premature  school  leaving,\r\n\r\nwhich  is quite conspicuous at lower secondary school  level.\r\n\r\nI think we should address this upper end of the issue so that\r\n\r\nwe  can tackle educational wastage and, perhaps, enhance  the\r\n\r\npotential of this group of people who otherwise may drift out\r\n\r\nof the secondary education net.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also disappointed that we have excluded\r\n\r\ndisabled  children or special children from  the  purview  of\r\n\r\nCompulsory  Education.  We may argue that they  have  special\r\n\r\nneeds and they should be catered for separately.  I see  that\r\n\r\nsuch a reason is persuasive but, it is unconvincing. Sir, all\r\n\r\nthat  I  am  appealing  is, should we  not  protect  disabled\r\n\r\nchildren  by  ensuring  they are not  denied  education  like\r\n\r\nnormal  children?   All  the more  we  should  protect  them,\r\n\r\nbecause  they  are  most  likely to  be  neglected  in  their\r\n\r\neducation.   Therefore, I see no cogent reason  for  disabled\r\n\r\nchildren to be excluded from Compulsory Education.   Sir,  in\r\n\r\nthis  respect,  are  we not discriminating  against  disabled\r\n\r\nchildren?   One may argue we are not, but by excluding  them,\r\n\r\nwe are keeping them out to some extent from the mainstream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is good that we should accord the same\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education status to all children, irrespective  of\r\n\r\ntheir background.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to say is that it is not Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation  requirement  that  will  have  an  impact  on  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our children.  It is not the legislation  that\r\n\r\ncounts.   Many countries have Compulsory Education, but  many\r\n\r\nchildren remain unschooled.  It is the software which is very\r\n\r\nimportant,  eg,  good  teachers, principals,  good  schooling\r\n\r\nculture,  which will make the difference in the  learning  of\r\n\r\nour  children.   In this respect, I would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  we are taking more bolder  steps  to  make\r\n\r\nprimary education more effective and exciting, and to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  it is able to maximise the potential and provide a very\r\n\r\ngood headstart for our children themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many countries have Compulsory Education, but many\r\n\r\nchildren are not able to get the best from education  itself.\r\n\r\nSo  I  hope that the Ministry of Education would be deploying\r\n\r\nmore resources to provide the best of support we can for very\r\n\r\nyoung children who will be entering into our primary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K.

These objectives were foremost in the minds of the\r\n\r\nCommittee on Compulsory Education, which I chaired.   Indeed,\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Prime Minister asked the Ministry of Education  to\r\n\r\nconsider the introduction of Compulsory Education in  October\r\n\r\nlast  year, he reiterated the need for our children to attend\r\n\r\nschool and be given the same headstart in life to develop his\r\n\r\nor her full potential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Committee recommended Compulsory Education to be\r\n\r\nintroduced in Singapore, and I must thank all the Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  House  who spoke this afternoon; all of  them  were  in\r\n\r\nsupport of introducing Compulsory Education.  I think  it  is\r\n\r\nan  important step for Singapore.  It is an important step in\r\n\r\nensuring  that  our  children are prepared  for  the  future,\r\n\r\nparticularly  for  the  requirements of  the  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy in an age of globalisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my Committee also shared MOE's long standing\r\n\r\nposition  that  Compulsory Education  does  not,  in  itself,\r\n\r\nensure  full enrolment in schools or solve the root  problems\r\n\r\nof non-attendance.  Nor was it the intention of the Committee\r\n\r\nto  use Compulsory Education as a means to improve access  to\r\n\r\nand  support  for  children with special  needs.   These  are\r\n\r\nalready taken care of by existing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasures,  and improvements will continue to be made  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education.

My\r\n\r\nCommittee  was  very  clear that the  principle  of  parental\r\n\r\nresponsibility must be upheld so that Singapore society  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to be rooted in strong families.  Again,  this  was\r\n\r\none  of  the  long  standing  concerns  of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation.    But  because  the  future  of  all  Singaporean\r\n\r\nchildren is important, we need to provide the State with  the\r\n\r\npower to compel parents to send their children to school when\r\n\r\nall  other methods of persuasion fail.  Such children, though\r\n\r\nsmall in number, would otherwise miss out on the benefits  of\r\n\r\neducation in the national schools. This number is small.  Mdm\r\n\r\nClaire  Chiang  has probably looked at the  wrong  source  of\r\n\r\ninformation. What is provided in the Annex of my  Committee's\r\n\r\nReport is the accurate number.  The number was obtained  when\r\n\r\nsome  children  failed  to register during  the  time  of  P1\r\n\r\nregistration.  So we came up with 1,500 children,  two-thirds\r\n\r\nof   whom   did   not  register  either  by  choice   or   by\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  and  the  remaining one-third  could  not  be\r\n\r\ntraced in spite of all efforts by the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of questions on the recommendations of the\r\n\r\nCommittee deal with the reasons why we recommended Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation  only up to primary six. This point was brought  up\r\n\r\nby  Dr  Wang Kai Yuen, Mr Tay Beng Chuan, Mr Chiam See  Tong,\r\n\r\nMdm  Claire Chiang, Dr Vasoo and others.  I think we have  to\r\n\r\nlook   at  the  total  picture  and  the  amount  of  careful\r\n\r\ndeliberation the Committee had put in before we came up  with\r\n\r\nthis  recommendation. We spent a lot of time in  deliberating\r\n\r\non  this. We looked at the experience of other countries  and\r\n\r\nwe realised that in the context of Singapore, the duration of\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education, as well as the form in which it  should\r\n\r\ntake, are two issues which are closely inter-related and they\r\n\r\nmust   be  considered  together.   In  coming  up  with   our\r\n\r\nrecommendation that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education should cover up to primary six education\r\n\r\nin our national schools, our main reasons are two-fold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the problem of school drop-outs at the\r\n\r\nsecondary  school level. At the secondary school  level,  the\r\n\r\nproblems  of  school drop-outs are quite complex.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nthese would not be solved with the introduction of Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation.   Sir,  when adolescents reach  secondary  school,\r\n\r\nsome  of  them drop out for various reasons, often by choice,\r\n\r\nsuch  as the loss of interest in their studies.  No doubt  we\r\n\r\ncan   compel  them  to  remain  in  school  under  Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation,  but  there  is no guarantee  that  they  will  be\r\n\r\nmotivated  to  study  and complete secondary  education.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  even Mr Chiam, who advocated eight years of Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation, that is, to cover up to secondary two,  said,  \"It\r\n\r\nis  useless.   It is a waste of resources to compel  them  to\r\n\r\nstudy beyond that because if they had lost interest, there is\r\n\r\nno point to keep them in the system.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the question of loss of interest, there is\r\n\r\nthe  question  of  how to make sure that they  attend  school\r\n\r\nregularly  - the question of enforcement.  The experience  of\r\n\r\nother  countries  shows that at the secondary  school  level,\r\n\r\nmore  and more resources and more severe penalties will  have\r\n\r\nto be put in place. The government in the United Kingdom, for\r\n\r\nexample, is devoting more than 500 million pounds in the next\r\n\r\nfew  years  to crack the problem of truancy.  They  are  also\r\n\r\nconsidering  whether  to  issue warrants  of  arrest  to  the\r\n\r\nparents  whose  children do not turn up in  school.  In  some\r\n\r\nstates  in  America, they are considering  whether  to  issue\r\n\r\nwarrants to the students, the adolescents themselves, for not\r\n\r\nattending  school regularly.  On the one hand,  advocates  of\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education feel that every means must be brought to\r\n\r\nbear  to  ensure children stay in school up to the  secondary\r\n\r\nlevel.  On the other hand, they do not want extreme measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to make up our mind, we have to balance the\r\n\r\npros and cons, the practicality of enforcement, the amount of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresources  required and see, whether in  the  end,  we  would\r\n\r\nstill  be  able to ensure 100% enrolment and 100% attendance.\r\n\r\nThe  experience of other countries proves that  this  is  not\r\n\r\nassured.  In  fact, 100% is not possible.  Mdm Claire  Chiang\r\n\r\nquoted the example of Hong Kong where, over so many years  of\r\n\r\nCompulsory  Education,  only one case  had  been  brought  to\r\n\r\ncourt, and only a few cases had been fined. But this does not\r\n\r\nmean  that  there  is 100% compliance. This  means  that  the\r\n\r\nmachinery  of enforcement may not be 100% working.   I  think\r\n\r\nthis is the question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we considered and recognised the impracticality of\r\n\r\nimplementing Compulsory Education at the secondary level.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  in the interest of the students who have lost interest\r\n\r\nin  their  studies, a more desirable outcome for them  is  to\r\n\r\nreceive  some vocational skills training to prepare them  for\r\n\r\nemployment.  This course of action is presently available  in\r\n\r\nthe  various  training schemes that the ITE has designed  for\r\n\r\nthem. Specifically, there are courses that lead up to the NTC-3   level  of  certification  for  those  without  'N'  level\r\n\r\nqualifications.  There are also NTC-2  courses,  as  well  as\r\n\r\nCertification  in Office Skills for those students  who  left\r\n\r\nschool  with 'N' level qualifications only.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nthere  are  existing schemes and educational  programmes  for\r\n\r\nstudents  who  drop  out  of secondary  school.   The  better\r\n\r\nsolution  for students who have lost interest in studying  is\r\n\r\nnot  to  force them to attend school, but to give  them  more\r\n\r\nopportunities   to  receive  pre-employment   or   vocational\r\n\r\ntraining.   As  for other students who drop  out  because  of\r\n\r\nfamily  and  financial reasons, please be  assured  that  the\r\n\r\nschool and the community have been doing their best to render\r\n\r\nassistance.   In  fact, before one single student  is  marked\r\n\r\ndown  as  a premature school drop-out, the school would  have\r\n\r\ngone through several layers of tracking, persuasion, help and\r\n\r\nassistance  rendered by the teachers, school counsellers  and\r\n\r\nsocial  workers already.  So we do not give  up  on  them  as\r\n\r\neasily as you would have thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason why the Committee recommended\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto primary six level was because we wanted to accommodate the\r\n\r\nwish of the Muslim community to train their religious leaders\r\n\r\nand   teachers  in  madrasahs.   The  Muslim  community   was\r\n\r\nconcerned about the introduction of Compulsory Education even\r\n\r\nfor a duration of four years.  Members will remember that the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister suggested four years of Compulsory  Education\r\n\r\nup  to  Primary  Four at the beginning.  And even  then,  the\r\n\r\nmadrasahs  were concerned whether, with Compulsory  Education\r\n\r\nin  national  schools,  they would be  able  to  have  enough\r\n\r\nstudents  who would want to study in madrasahs afterwards  to\r\n\r\nbecome   religious  teachers.   Six  years  is  therefore   a\r\n\r\npractical and workable compromise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reiterate, the stand of the Committee on the duration\r\n\r\nof  Compulsory  Education is that the recommended  six  years\r\n\r\nshould  not be seen as the ideal length of education.  We  do\r\n\r\nnot pretend that it is the best length of education that each\r\n\r\nchild must have. In fact, we know its shortcomings. It is not\r\n\r\nthe  ideal.   It  is not an adequate amount of  education  to\r\n\r\nequip  you  and go right into the workforce.  But it  is  the\r\n\r\nfoundation  or  base from which the children  can  go  on  to\r\n\r\nfurther education and training in secondary school.  In fact,\r\n\r\nmore  than  94%  of  our primary school children  go  on  and\r\n\r\nreceive 10 years of education in total.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In coming up with the recommendation for Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation  up to primary six, the Committee was mindful  that\r\n\r\nany  proposal  should take into consideration the  views  and\r\n\r\naspirations  of  our  different  communities.   I  think  the\r\n\r\ncriticism  of  both  Mr  Chiam and  Mr  Jeyaretnam  that  the\r\n\r\ncomposition of the Committee was biased or political  in  its\r\n\r\norientation from the beginning was unfair.  Yes,  there  were\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament  on  the Committee.  There  were  PAP\r\n\r\nMembers,  but they represented the views of different  ethnic\r\n\r\ncommunities in our society. There was also a Nominated Member\r\n\r\nof  Parliament on the Committee, Dr Jennifer Lee. The  others\r\n\r\nwere  educationists.  They were professionals.  There  was  a\r\n\r\nrepresentative from the Ministry of Community Development and\r\n\r\nSports as well.  In our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprocess of deliberation, we consulted a very wide section  of\r\n\r\nsociety.  We  had feedback sessions, closed-door focus  group\r\n\r\ndiscussions with representatives from all walks of life. So I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  unfair  to  say that,  because  of  a  certain\r\n\r\npolitical  bias,  therefore we came up with this  expeditious\r\n\r\npolitical solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Committee found that generally, there was widespread\r\n\r\nsupport  for  Compulsory Education.  But the  various  groups\r\n\r\nthat  gave us feedback wanted sufficient flexibility  in  its\r\n\r\nimplementation to accommodate their interest and concerns.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  our  recommendations have  indeed  accommodated  the\r\n\r\nconcerns and interests of the various communities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Minister Tarmugi has already replied to the points\r\n\r\non  madrasahs, I would not dwell on them. However, I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  Mr  Zulkifli Baharudin's suggestion that the madrasahs\r\n\r\nshould be represented on the Compulsory Education Board is  a\r\n\r\nworkable one, because Compulsory Education, in the context of\r\n\r\nour   intention,  is  Compulsory  Education  within  national\r\n\r\nschools.   Madrasahs are schools outside the national  school\r\n\r\nsystem.  They  are concerned with the religious education  of\r\n\r\nMuslim  children and the Muslim community has  to  decide  on\r\n\r\nwhat  role  the madrasahs play and what would be  the  future\r\n\r\ndirections for its further development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam said that we should give the madrasahs or the\r\n\r\ndesignated institutions, including San Yu Adventist School, a\r\n\r\nreasonable period of time for them to adjust and to meet  the\r\n\r\nbenchmarks.   He  suggested five  years.   In  fact,  in  our\r\n\r\nReport,  we recommended that the madrasahs have up  to  eight\r\n\r\nyears  to  look  into  how they could improve  the  teaching,\r\n\r\nteaching resources, total environment and so on, in order  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  PSLE benchmark.  We are quite mindful of the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  they had no experience in meeting the benchmark and  we\r\n\r\nare   prepared  to  give  them  up  to  eight  years  because\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education would be introduced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo  years  later,  in 2003; and six years  afterwards,  they\r\n\r\nwould have the first batch of primary six children graduating\r\n\r\nwho  would  be benchmarked against the PSLE average aggregate\r\n\r\nscores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi expressed concern that he had heard among the\r\n\r\nMalay-Muslim  community that if some of the  madrasahs  could\r\n\r\nnot reach the benchmark by that time-frame, what would happen\r\n\r\nto  the pupils.  The institutions which, by the agreed  time-frame, cannot still meet the agreed minimum standards,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure   you  will  agree  with  me,  would  not  be  providing\r\n\r\nsatisfactory instruction in the core secular subjects to  the\r\n\r\nstudents.   It  would be unreasonable for the  Government  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to allow these madrasahs in question which  fail  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the minimum standards to continue teaching indefinitely\r\n\r\nthe  core secular subjects and admit students full-time  into\r\n\r\ntheir fold. In such cases, the affected institution will  not\r\n\r\nbe  allowed  to  admit  pupils who  are  required  to  attend\r\n\r\nnational  schools  for full-time education.   For  madrasahs,\r\n\r\nhowever,  they  would  still  be able  to  continue  offering\r\n\r\nreligious  education to students who want it on  a  part-time\r\n\r\nand  after-school  hour basis.  The students  themselves  can\r\n\r\nenrol  in  national schools or they can enrol  in  the  other\r\n\r\nmadrasahs which meet the PSLE benchmark.  So, their  interest\r\n\r\nwould not be compromised.  They would still be able to attend\r\n\r\nschool in the national school system, just like now.  We have\r\n\r\ncases where some parents want to transfer their children from\r\n\r\nmadrasahs  to  national schools.  The receiving  school  will\r\n\r\ngive them a test and see which level they could be placed in.\r\n\r\nSo,  it  will be like now, but the students can also transfer\r\n\r\nto other madrasahs which meet the PSLE benchmark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards home schoolers, I think Dr Wang has put it\r\n\r\nvery  well  regarding the deliberations of the Committee  and\r\n\r\nthe  kind  of  dilemma we faced.  But I would  also  like  to\r\n\r\ncorrect  a slight misimpression, which I think either  he  or\r\n\r\nanother  speaker  conveyed,  that  the  home  schoolers   are\r\n\r\nactually  doing a very good job in schooling the children  at\r\n\r\nhome.  I do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoubt  their keen interest, their good intentions, in wanting\r\n\r\nto  home school their children at home.  They put in a lot of\r\n\r\nenergy.   As  one Member put it, the wife, in one case,  quit\r\n\r\nher  full-time  job and stayed at home to take  care  of  the\r\n\r\nschooling  needs of her children.  But my worry  is  that  in\r\n\r\nspite  of  the good intentions, in spite of the efforts  they\r\n\r\nput  in, are they really able to give the children the  best?\r\n\r\nAnd  the best they give, can it match what we can provide  in\r\n\r\nour national schools?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when I met with them during a couple of the\r\n\r\ndialogue  sessions,  I was a little bit  disturbed  with  the\r\n\r\nvehemence  in which they pleaded their cases.  In fact,  they\r\n\r\neven  went on to say that our schools do not provide  a  good\r\n\r\neducation.  They said, once the children go into the national\r\n\r\nschools, they imbibe the wrong values and fall into the wrong\r\n\r\ncompany.  Therefore, they are very worried and withdraw their\r\n\r\nchildren  from  school.   I  think  this  is  not  the  right\r\n\r\nperspective on our schools.  Our national schools  provide  a\r\n\r\ngood  rounded education.   The home schoolers have a  certain\r\n\r\nbelief  that  they could do the job of the school.   We  said\r\n\r\nthat  if  they  have such keen interest in  their  children's\r\n\r\neducation and if they could provide the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nwith  enough  evidence that their education  meets  the  twin\r\n\r\nobjectives  of  Compulsory Education, then we could  consider\r\n\r\nexemption  for  their children, but only if we are  satisfied\r\n\r\nthat the twin objectives of Compulsory Education are met.  It\r\n\r\nis   also  why  our  Committee  was  a  little  stricter   in\r\n\r\nprescribing the criteria which the home schoolers  must  meet\r\n\r\nbefore  we would continue to grant them exemption.   And  MOE\r\n\r\nwould look into the methods of monitoring the home schoolers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli pointed out that there is a loophole. I\r\n\r\nthink  it will be incumbent on the home schoolers to  provide\r\n\r\nevidence that they could provide a curriculum which will meet\r\n\r\nMOE's  standards and requirements.  The children are required\r\n\r\nto meet PSLE standards, pegged at the same benchmark as those\r\n\r\nrequired   for  children  who  are  exempted  from  attending\r\n\r\nnational schools but who go to San Yu Adventist School.  They\r\n\r\nare also required\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  pass  the national education quiz.  I think  we  have  to\r\n\r\nwatch the situation of the home schoolers a bit closely.  MOE\r\n\r\nwill  look into various methods of monitoring their  progress\r\n\r\nand  will  assess  whether  the criteria  for  exemption,  as\r\n\r\nrecommended by the Committee, are adequate as we go along.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards special education, Mdm Claire Chiang, Dr\r\n\r\nVasoo,  Mr  Loh Meng See as well as some other  Members  have\r\n\r\nasked  why  we  have  exempted children in special  education\r\n\r\nschools  from  the  requirements of Compulsory  Education  in\r\n\r\nnational  schools.   They  reflect  the  sentiments  of  some\r\n\r\nmembers  of the special education community in Singapore  who\r\n\r\nexpressed,   as   I  said,  some  disappointment   with   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Compulsory Education Committee.    But\r\n\r\nlet  me  say  again  that  our Committee  had  examined  very\r\n\r\ncarefully the existing measures to support special education,\r\n\r\nand  found  that  the Government together with  the  National\r\n\r\nCouncil   of   Social  Service  and  the  voluntary   welfare\r\n\r\norganisations  have given extra resources to the  educational\r\n\r\nneeds  of  children with disabilities.  Far from ignoring  or\r\n\r\ndiscriminating  against  such  children,  the   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation  actually  provides funding up  to  2.5  times  the\r\n\r\nrecurrent  cost  of  educating  a  primary  school  pupil  in\r\n\r\nnational  schools.   The National Council of  Social  Service\r\n\r\nprovides  funding  of another 1.5 times, bringing  the  total\r\n\r\nrecurrent funding for special education schools up to 4 times\r\n\r\nthe  recurrent  cost of educating a primary school  pupil  in\r\n\r\nnational schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education also funds 90% of the\r\n\r\ndevelopment cost of each new purpose-built school.   And  NIE\r\n\r\nprovides  teacher training and the Ministry seconds  teachers\r\n\r\nand  principals  to  these  special  education  schools  upon\r\n\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of integration, let me point out that\r\n\r\nthere are different models in providing special education and\r\n\r\nhow  integration is promoted should differ according  to  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the  different groups of children  with  different\r\n\r\nneeds.  This is so with many countries in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworld.   There is no one single model.  We learn  from  them.\r\n\r\nWe  will  adapt  their practices to our local  context.   The\r\n\r\nimportant  point  is that whatever the setting  of  providing\r\n\r\nspecial  education,  it  should  be  one  that  provides   an\r\n\r\nappropriate learning environment that can best cater  to  the\r\n\r\nspecific needs of the special children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there was a spate of letters in the Forum page\r\n\r\nabout my Ministry's provision for special education children.\r\n\r\nOn  3rd October, my Ministry made a detailed reply on what we\r\n\r\nhave  been  providing  to  the  special  children.   Let   me\r\n\r\nreiterate,   very   briefly,  that  for   those   with   mild\r\n\r\ndisabilities  and those who are able to cope with  mainstream\r\n\r\neducation,  MOE  has  already  incorporated  facilities   and\r\n\r\nresources  in  our  national schools for the  integration  of\r\n\r\nthese  children.   There  are in our mainstream  schools  the\r\n\r\nphysically  handicapped,  the mildly  hearing  impaired,  and\r\n\r\nvisually  handicapped  and others who  are  studying  in  our\r\n\r\nmainstream  schools.   They follow our  national  curriculum.\r\n\r\nThey are given extra resources.  They are given remedial help\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those with more severe learning disabilities, we\r\n\r\nfeel  that it would be better off for them if they are taught\r\n\r\nand   educated  in  special  schools  where  they  are  given\r\n\r\nspecially trained teachers, special facilities, and they  are\r\n\r\ngiven  time to pursue their education according to their  own\r\n\r\npace.   So,  the present situation of providing  for  special\r\n\r\neducation children, in the view of the Committee members,  is\r\n\r\nadequate  and  we are assured that the Ministry of  Education\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to help the voluntary welfare  organisations,\r\n\r\nthrough  the National Council of Social Service,  to  address\r\n\r\nthe  needs  of  the  special children.  In fact,  because  we\r\n\r\ndefine  \"Compulsory Education\" as education  within  national\r\n\r\nschools that provide the curriculum and the total environment\r\n\r\nthat  will  meet the two objectives of Compulsory  Education,\r\n\r\nspecial  education  schools are  outside  the  ambit  of  the\r\n\r\nCompulsory  Education framework.

If we enforce Compulsory Education  on  families\r\n\r\nwith  special children, I think it may become a bit too harsh\r\n\r\nfor  them.  These families need all our help.  We should help\r\n\r\nthem  overcome the difficulties, financial or otherwise,  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  coping and so on.  They need help.  They  should\r\n\r\nnot  be brought under the purview of the Compulsory Education\r\n\r\nBill  which  prescribes penalties.  Do not  forget  that  the\r\n\r\nCompulsory  Education Bill prescribes penalties  for  parents\r\n\r\nwho fail to comply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we need penalties? As I said, most of the people\r\n\r\nwhom we talked to are for Compulsory Education.  They have  a\r\n\r\ngood   heart.   They  want  every  child  to  have  the  same\r\n\r\nheadstart.  They want every child to have an education.  But,\r\n\r\nat  the  same time, they do not advocate harsh measures.   We\r\n\r\nare   not  advocating  harsh  measures.   In  fact,  we   are\r\n\r\ninstituting a mechanism of many rounds of community  help   - counselling,  mediation  and  so  forth.   But  in  cases  of\r\n\r\npersistent  flouting  of  the law,  in  cases  where  parents\r\n\r\nwilfully  flout  the  law and are not  cooperative  with  the\r\n\r\nassistance given by schools and counselling agencies, the law\r\n\r\nmust be brought to fall on them.  Otherwise, our legal system\r\n\r\nwill be brought into disrepute.  Our intention is not to  use\r\n\r\nthis  liberally.   In fact, our intention is  that  the  full\r\n\r\nforce of the law will be brought only as a last resort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli Baharudin said that the Compulsory Education\r\n\r\nBoard  has  a very difficult task. It should treat  its  work\r\n\r\nwith   the   greatest  sensitivity  and   flexibility.    The\r\n\r\nCompulsory  Education Board will certainly do so.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  Compulsory Education  Board will comprise  members  from\r\n\r\nthe  voluntary  welfare organisations, community  development\r\n\r\ncouncils,  Community  and  Parents  in  Support  of   Schools\r\n\r\n(COMPASS),  self-help  groups, grassroots  organisations  and\r\n\r\nconcerned individuals.  Members can be assured that we have a\r\n\r\nbroad  representation of people who have the  compassion  and\r\n\r\nthe sensitivity to deal with these issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would just like to echo both Mdm Claire Chiang\r\n\r\nand  Dr  Vasoo's  concern that our primary  school  education\r\n\r\nshould not just emphasise the academic kind of outcomes,  but\r\n\r\nthat   we  should  address  the  multiple  intelligences   of\r\n\r\nchildren.  We should help to develop the child in a  holistic\r\n\r\nmanner and we should pay attention closely to the quality  of\r\n\r\neducation provided in primary school, now that primary school\r\n\r\neducation is compulsory.  I would like to assure both of them\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry has been paying close  attention  to  the\r\n\r\nreview  of  the  entire spectrum of education,  not  just  in\r\n\r\nprimary  schools, but also secondary schools,  pre-University\r\n\r\nand  tertiary  education.  In fact, we  have  introduced  new\r\n\r\ncurriculum,  new  subjects,  new  approaches  and  assessment\r\n\r\nmethods,  beginning  with  the  primary  school  level.    We\r\n\r\nemphasise  the holistic education of children, not  just  the\r\n\r\nintellectual  aspect  but also the social,  moral,  physical,\r\n\r\naesthetic  aspects  of  education.   We  emphasise   thinking\r\n\r\nskills, creativity, life skills, management of self and so on\r\n\r\nin  our new approach in education.  We will give education to\r\n\r\nthese children our best, not only in terms of infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe  PRIME  programme, for example, will renew  many  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting primary schools along with secondary schools  within\r\n\r\nthe next five years.  They would have spanking new facilities\r\n\r\nup  to  the  latest  standards.   Teacher  training  will  be\r\n\r\nimproved.   Curriculum  has  been  improved  and   is   being\r\n\r\ncontinuously reviewed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me say that Compulsory Education can\r\n\r\nonly  be  effective  if  it has the fullest  commitment  from\r\n\r\nparents  and  the  community.   The  recommendations  of  the\r\n\r\nCompulsory  Education Committee, in my view, signify  a  very\r\n\r\nsignificant  step  forward for education  in  Singapore.   We\r\n\r\naffirm the commitment of the Government to give every child a\r\n\r\ngood  headstart in life and give him the foundation on  which\r\n\r\nhe  can acquire further knowledge and skills to be productive\r\n\r\nworkers and to be good citizens in their adult life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, may I respond?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> You may not respond. If you want to\r\n\r\nmake a clarification, I will allow you.  Mr Simon Tay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am not\r\n\r\nquite  sure  what I can add after so many people have  spoken\r\n\r\nand  the clarifications by the Senior Minister of State.  But\r\n\r\nI  think we all have a great belief in education and this  is\r\n\r\nwhy  so  many  of us have spoken today.  Let me  try  not  to\r\n\r\nrepeat what has been said before and let me try to add what I\r\n\r\ncan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think our belief in education stems from the fact that\r\n\r\nwe  believe  that  whatever our beginnings,  we  can  improve\r\n\r\nourselves and be the best that we can be.  Secondly, when  we\r\n\r\nface  social problems, we often look to education to  address\r\n\r\nthe  root  problems.   How  do we promote  education  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety?  We basically have a system of centralised system of\r\n\r\neducation.   This compares to other countries that  emphasise\r\n\r\nmore private, family and community-based education.  Instead,\r\n\r\nour  state provides the vast majority of education  for  most\r\n\r\npeople.  There is, of course, in any case of state provision,\r\n\r\na  danger of having one-size fits all.  But with the  various\r\n\r\nfine-tunings  to  our  system, we are improving  our  system,\r\n\r\ncreating  a centralised system, but one with enough  variety,\r\n\r\none   with  the  participation  of  community  and  one  that\r\n\r\nemphasises  not just the KBE, of raw knowledge  and  thinking\r\n\r\nskills,  but also citizenship, an attribute of being part  of\r\n\r\nbeing Singapore.  In that sense, despite the many points that\r\n\r\nhave  been  raised today, this debate reveals that  there  is\r\n\r\nactually quite a broad consensus that our education system is\r\n\r\non  the right track and that we are trying to do what is best\r\n\r\nfor  the children and the best in the interest of the  child.\r\n\r\nWe  then  come  to this particular question  of  making  this\r\n\r\nrelatively good system compulsory for all.  Again, it is very\r\n\r\nimportant  to emphasise how many people already  are  in  the\r\n\r\nsystem  voluntarily and therefore we are trying to deal  with\r\n\r\nactually a very small number and targeted means may  be  very\r\n\r\nnecessary to reach these people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this issue was first raised in the House, I\r\n\r\nexpressed an initial scepticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough  I  am  a  lawyer,  I do  not  really  believe  that\r\n\r\nsomething  really  becomes so much better  when  it  is  made\r\n\r\ncompulsory  by  law.  It is part of my instinct  that  it  is\r\n\r\nsometimes wrong that whenever we think something is important\r\n\r\nbut  often  unpopular  we think make  it  compulsory  is  the\r\n\r\nsolution.   It  is  like  the debate we  had  about  learning\r\n\r\nliterature  or  history.   Making it available,  interesting,\r\n\r\nrelevant  and  appealing, is even more important.   While  we\r\n\r\ntake  the  step today to make primary school education  entry\r\n\r\ncompulsory,  that is the way of making sure  that  after  six\r\n\r\nyears  of   Compulsory  Education,  as  recommended  by   the\r\n\r\nCommittee,  students can and will want to go on  further  and\r\n\r\ntheir  parents  will want to support them to go  on  further.\r\n\r\nOnce  they  are in the system, this attitude plus counselling\r\n\r\nand  encouragement, can be as effective as legal  compulsion.\r\n\r\nIf we do not take this approach, and we just rely on the bare\r\n\r\nlaw,  we  are  doing the wrong thing.  We may  intend  to  be\r\n\r\nbeneficial  and  liberal in our aims, but  we  end  up  being\r\n\r\ndictators  in  our  means.  I still believe  that  making  it\r\n\r\nillegal  is not enough.  Parents need to be informed, tracked\r\n\r\nand  counselled and the cause of the problem, Government  and\r\n\r\ncivil  society groups should help address those problems.   I\r\n\r\nam  glad for the assurance just given  by the Senior Minister\r\n\r\nof State in this regard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like some more clarification about how in the\r\n\r\nfirst  place  do  we  find  all the children  and  all  their\r\n\r\nparents.   We  have  some  way of  tracking  them  at  birth.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  some may enrol in pre-school, but perhaps  not  all.\r\n\r\nThen we have child doctors who can help track children.   But\r\n\r\nwe  are  talking about some significant numbers,  although  a\r\n\r\nvery small percentage, who just simply do not register in our\r\n\r\nsystem.   Though Singapore is often called the \"nanny state\",\r\n\r\nwe simply do not have a fool-proof net.  No one has.  That is\r\n\r\nsomething  we  should  bear  in  mind  when  we  talk   about\r\n\r\ncompulsion.   The  Director-General in that sense  will  need\r\n\r\nmore resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to my second point. This is that the\r\n\r\nschools and the criteria for allowing exceptions are  not  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  before  us.  Much would therefore  depend  on  the\r\n\r\ndiscretion of the Ministry and of the Director-General to  be\r\n\r\nappointed.   More  guidance and principles  within  the  Bill\r\n\r\nperhaps would have been preferable.  I certainly would  argue\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  to read in part of the Constitution  such  as\r\n\r\nArticle  152(2), which recognises the special rights  of  the\r\n\r\nMalay-Muslims as the indigenous people of Singapore.  I would\r\n\r\nalso  urge that the rights of the Child Convention should  be\r\n\r\nread  into  the criteria for this is the relevant Convention,\r\n\r\nan international UN Convention, that Singapore has signed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point relates to the Government's allowance of\r\n\r\ndiversity.   Let  me first touch on the point  of  madrasahs.\r\n\r\nThere  was some initial fear that the Government would  close\r\n\r\ndown  the  madrasahs.   I  am  very  glad  to  see  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  now  would  allow them to continue  with  certain\r\n\r\nprovisions and certain benchmarks to be set.  In a  sense,  I\r\n\r\nam  welcoming  Government's  allowance  for  other  forms  of\r\n\r\neducation  and the recognition of diversity as  an  important\r\n\r\npart   of  Singapore.   This  upholds  Article  15   of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution which promises us freedom of religion,   Article\r\n\r\n152(2),  which, as I said, recognizes the indigenous position\r\n\r\nof  the  Malays  and their religion.  While I  recognise  and\r\n\r\nwelcome the Government's attitude to diversity, I would  also\r\n\r\nask  the Malay community to take that step forward.  That  is\r\n\r\nto ask them to recognise not only the leeway given to them to\r\n\r\nhave their religious instruction, but also the responsibility\r\n\r\nthey  have  to the wider community and to their own children.\r\n\r\nIn  many  cases, in many countries, where they have  tried  a\r\n\r\nseparate  schooling  system, this  school  system  has  never\r\n\r\nbecome  equal.  Separate and equal is a  principle  that  has\r\n\r\nfailed  too  often  times.  I would  then  ask  them,  as  an\r\n\r\noutsider,  to seek a balance and I am glad to see  that  most\r\n\r\npolls show Malays in Singapore among the most patriotic, most\r\n\r\nSingaporean  segment of the people.  Therefore,  I  have  the\r\n\r\nconfidence that they will find this balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In helping madrasahs meet these benchmarks, there has\r\n\r\nalready been talk that Government will support the madrasahs.\r\n\r\nThere  is  obviously  some need for  people  to  support  the\r\n\r\ncommunity project even from outside that community.  But I do\r\n\r\nwant   to  express  a  concern  about  Article  16   of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution.  This sets limits to using Government funds for\r\n\r\neducational institutions that discriminate based on religion.\r\n\r\nI  hope that no unconstitutional and unrealistic expectations\r\n\r\nare  placed  on  Government coffers to  support  basically  a\r\n\r\ncommunity project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to my last point. This is in regard to\r\n\r\nhome schooling which is to be allowed in principle, according\r\n\r\nto  the report.  Again, as I said, this is welcome because it\r\n\r\nhas a sense of diversity based on educational values.  I bear\r\n\r\nin mind what the Senior Minister of State has said, that some\r\n\r\nparents are well-meaning but may not actually provide   well-thought out, well-delivered programmes, not on par with  what\r\n\r\nour schools deliver.  But I do think that under this category\r\n\r\nof  home  schooling, consideration must be given  to  options\r\n\r\nsuch  as Montissori and what is called the Steiner or Waldorf\r\n\r\nEducation  schools.   These  are  already  in  existence   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, especially the Montissori for pre-school.  But  as\r\n\r\nthe  Senior Minister of State well knows, in other  countries\r\n\r\nthese  are  offered  for  school  years.   I  think  this  is\r\n\r\nrecognised in many countries and it is something that  should\r\n\r\nbe considered seriously in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education had earlier refused to agree\r\n\r\non   Compulsory   Education  but  the  Government   has   now\r\n\r\nreconsidered.    Some  thought  that  madrasahs   and   other\r\n\r\nreligious or particular types of schools would not be  exempt\r\n\r\nfrom  Compulsory Education.  But this has not been the  case.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Ministry, as guided by the Committee, has listened\r\n\r\nand  allowed  diversity.  In so doing, it has now  created  a\r\n\r\nvery  broad  discretion for the Ministry  and  the  Director-General  to  exempt or to decide on whether to  prosecute  in\r\n\r\nsome cases.  I ask that discretion be exercised within the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprinciples  of  valuing  diversity  in  accordance  with  the\r\n\r\nConstitution and the best interest of our children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the wealth of our nation lies in  our  people,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  our next generation.

But  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  enough. We have the responsibility to ensure that  every\r\n\r\none  of  our next generation is also equipped with the basics\r\n\r\nto  face  the New Economy challenges. It is in this  context,\r\n\r\nSir, that I speak in support of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, teaching our young ones is such an emotive subject.\r\n\r\nAlmost  everyone  has a personal stake in it.   Almost  every\r\n\r\nparent  wants  to  have a say on it. Almost  everyone  has  a\r\n\r\nstatement to make and expectations to raise. Almost  everyone\r\n\r\nhas  his  own  concerns about how his children  ought  to  be\r\n\r\neducated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some concerns, on the one hand, are justified and\r\n\r\ndeserve closer attention. I shall elaborate on them later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there are concerns based on parochial\r\n\r\ninterests,  without a fuller understanding of  the  long-term\r\n\r\nconsequences  or  impact on our nation. We must  not  dismiss\r\n\r\nsuch concerns lightly - both now and in future. To do so,  is\r\n\r\nto  seriously  under-rate the emotions of the individual  and\r\n\r\nthe community on this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemotive  subject of educating the young. Instead, we need  to\r\n\r\nbe  perceptive,  sensitive and patient.  The  warmness  of  a\r\n\r\ngenuine heart can melt an iron resolve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am encouraged to note from the Committee's very well\r\n\r\nwritten  Report, that they undertook a rigorous  consultation\r\n\r\nprocess. I am also extremely delighted that an agreement  has\r\n\r\nbeen  reached  with  the  madrasah leaders  on  how  to  move\r\n\r\nforward. The Bill has provided the flexibility for exemptions\r\n\r\nto be made in this regard. The Report also indicates that non-registration  and  drop-out cases  are  very  minimal.  I  am\r\n\r\nthrilled  that the Ministry's serious intent to upgrade  both\r\n\r\nthe hardware and software aspects of education has started to\r\n\r\nbear fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of its vision, purpose and articulated plans,\r\n\r\nMOE  has  done very well. But, there is a reality gap between\r\n\r\nwhat  MOE  intends to achieve and the current situation.  How\r\n\r\nwell  equipped  is  every one of our  children  for  the  New\r\n\r\nEconomy?  I do not think that we are up to the mark  yet.  We\r\n\r\nstill have a long way to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We still have a long way to go, because I know for a\r\n\r\nfact  that some Primary 6 EM3 students are not even  able  to\r\n\r\nstring  together a grammatically correct sentence in English.\r\n\r\nCan  we  say  that  these primary school  leavers  have  been\r\n\r\nequipped  with the basics to face the New Economy challenges?\r\n\r\nI do not think so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must not content ourselves with just casting the\r\n\r\neducation  net  over the entire cohort using this  Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation Bill. Casting this net is but a prelude to  a  more\r\n\r\nimportant  task  - that of preparing the next generation  for\r\n\r\nthe  challenges ahead. We must not only be aiming for a  100%\r\n\r\nattendance  figure.  We  must go beyond  the  statistics  and\r\n\r\nhonestly  ask  ourselves  how well we  have  taught  all  our\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, I wish to raise four main points for the\r\n\r\nMinister's clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Assistance to parents and schools</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, our schools must be given sufficient resources\r\n\r\nto prepare our children for the New Economy challenges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate on this point. MOE correctly recognises\r\n\r\nthat  the  critical success factor in implementing compulsory\r\n\r\neducation  is not by imposing fines or jail terms. These  are\r\n\r\ndeterrents  that  we hope will never be effected.  These  are\r\n\r\nmeasures that will end up punishing both the parents and  the\r\n\r\nchildren.   Instead,  there  will  be  a  mediation   process\r\n\r\ninvolving  MCDS and voluntary welfare organisations  to  help\r\n\r\nparents  and  children. Non-registration and  drop-out  cases\r\n\r\nwill not be referred to the courts unless the counselling and\r\n\r\nassistance prove to be unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with MOE's approach. But I am concerned as\r\n\r\nto whether we are fully equipped to deal comprehensively with\r\n\r\nall counselling and assistance cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee's Report indicated that the number of\r\n\r\nparents  with  financial or family problems  is  very  small.\r\n\r\nThese  are  the  only  known  cases  surfaced  to  MCDS   for\r\n\r\nassistance.   I  am  concerned that the  number  may  not  be\r\n\r\nreflective   of   the  situation  faced  by   some   of   our\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  schools. Is this number only  the  tip  of  an\r\n\r\niceberg?  I am sure that there are many unreported  cases  of\r\n\r\nparents  struggling  to put their children  to  school.  Some\r\n\r\nparents  do not seek help because of their pride, or  because\r\n\r\nthey are too busy to pay attention to their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE's team of psychologists and guidance counsellors and\r\n\r\nthe  teachers  in our schools may be able to  cope  with  the\r\n\r\nsituation now, but you need time to deal with such cases. You\r\n\r\nneed  additional  resources,  more  specialists,  to  provide\r\n\r\nproper  and  proactive counselling to struggling parents  and\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our assistance to struggling parents and children should\r\n\r\nnot   be  on  a  reactive  basis.   We  must  not  apply  the\r\n\r\ncounselling medicine only when the trouble sets in,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly  when the child has stopped attending school for  a  few\r\n\r\ndays.  We must instill in our teachers the mindset that every\r\n\r\nstudent matters. Our teachers must be trained to have a  keen\r\n\r\neye  to  nip problems in the bud.  They must be assured  that\r\n\r\nwhen  they encounter difficult cases that they cannot handle,\r\n\r\nthere are adequate specialist resources to back them up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we are serious about helping every child, then\r\n\r\nwe  need a more proactive and ongoing assistance process,  it\r\n\r\ncannot  be touch-and-go.  We must not be satisfied with  just\r\n\r\ngiving  the  child back to school.  We can only be  contented\r\n\r\nwhen  we see a motivated child returning to school with  full\r\n\r\nparental  support.   For this reason, we should  provide  our\r\n\r\nschools with additional resources to achieve this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister stated in his National Day Rally\r\n\r\nspeech  that he has asked MOE to see how our schools  can  be\r\n\r\nprovided  better administrative support so that teachers  can\r\n\r\nspend  less  time on administration and more on teaching.   I\r\n\r\nfully support the Prime Minister's initiative.  May I add, in\r\n\r\nrelation to this Bill, that schools should also be given more\r\n\r\ncounselling  and  specialist support  so  that  teachers  can\r\n\r\ndevote  more time to teaching.  In any case, not all teachers\r\n\r\nare gifted to counsel.  Those who have just graduated are too\r\n\r\nyoung and inexperienced to handle difficult cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, my first point of clarification to the Minister\r\n\r\nis  whether there is any  intention to shore up the resources\r\n\r\nto  help  teachers, especially in the neighbourhood  schools.\r\n\r\nGiven   the  current  resources  available,  when  does   the\r\n\r\ncounselling process end - will it stop once the child returns\r\n\r\nto   school  or  will  there  be  follow-up  counselling  and\r\n\r\nassistance to parents and students?  What steps will be taken\r\n\r\nto  help  our schools to be more proactive in identifying  in\r\n\r\nhelping struggling parents and troubled children?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Sir, is that to render Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation  more  effective, all children should  begin  their\r\n\r\nlearning journeys on a fairer footing.  According\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the Bill, Compulsory Education will begin only at Primary\r\n\r\n1  and not earlier.  This means that children with pre-school\r\n\r\neducation (or PSE) have a headstart over those with  no  PSE.\r\n\r\nChildren  who  did not attend kindergarten  classes  are  way\r\n\r\nbehind  the  starting  line  when  the  Compulsory  Education\r\n\r\nwhistle is blown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not exaggerating. To illustrate my point, I\r\n\r\nknow  of  a  kindergarten requiring its student to spell  our\r\n\r\nnational  pledge.  Can you imagine the kindergarten  students\r\n\r\nspelling,  \"to build a democratic society, based  on  justice\r\n\r\nand  equality,  so  as to achieve happiness,  prosperity  and\r\n\r\nprogress for our nation\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fault-line for the digital divide really begins very\r\n\r\nearly.   I  am  also  told  that some  kindergarten  children\r\n\r\nalready know how to make a simple Powerpoint presentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, children who have completed PSE are expected\r\n\r\nto  spell and read simple words, not just alphabets, and have\r\n\r\nattended  computer enrichment classes.  When  you  put  these\r\n\r\nchildren  together  with those who did not  go  through  PSE,\r\n\r\nslower  learners will lose their confidence and may  even  be\r\n\r\nlabelled  and  stigmatised.  They are not necessarily  slower\r\n\r\ndue  to a lower IQ but because of deprived opportunities  and\r\n\r\nthe lack of PSE.  Some parents do not send their children  to\r\n\r\nkindergartens  simply because of the fees  involved.   It  is\r\n\r\nmuch  dearer than the subsidised primary school fees and  the\r\n\r\namount  vary according to the prestige and facilities of  the\r\n\r\nkindergartens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that MOE understands that children left out of\r\n\r\nPSE have to play catch up on Day 1, and that the disparity in\r\n\r\nstandards  can  be  quite startling.   I  am  glad  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  recently announced in MOE's workplan  seminar  that\r\n\r\nMOE  intends to devote more resources to give Singaporeans  a\r\n\r\nheadstart in PSE and to review the PSE syllabus.  We  should,\r\n\r\nand  I  quote him, \"give every child a fair shot at achieving\r\n\r\nhis or her hopes and aspirations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this context that I pose my second point of\r\n\r\nclarification to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister.   Can  we  give  every  Singapore  child  a  fairer\r\n\r\nopportunity to enrol in a PSE institution?  Can we  keep  PSE\r\n\r\nfees  at  an  affordable rate for the lower-income  families?\r\n\r\nHow   much  would  it  cost  to  provide  subsidies  to   all\r\n\r\nkindergartens  to make the fee more affordable?   We  have  a\r\n\r\nmuch more intelligent new generation.  Should we consider  if\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education should begin at PSE level?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point, Sir, is that there is a need to review\r\n\r\nhow  we  are  educating our less successful students.   On  a\r\n\r\nnational   basis,   we  have  been  adopting  people-oriented\r\n\r\npolicies to help the less successful in society, and we  also\r\n\r\npay more attention to help students with special needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our concern must not end with just simply\r\n\r\nimplementing   Compulsory  Education.    Our   responsibility\r\n\r\nextends  to  ensuring that proper and adequate assistance  is\r\n\r\ngiven to all our students so that their learning journey will\r\n\r\nnot lead them to a dead end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to MOE's credit that it seeks to address the\r\n\r\nspecial  needs  of  students who are  slow  learners.   MOE's\r\n\r\nLearning  Support programme, started in 1992, is an excellent\r\n\r\nprogramme, except that it is only for students up to  Primary\r\n\r\n2.   About  12,000 students in Primary 1 and 2 are  currently\r\n\r\nreceiving  regular, individualised support  in  language  and\r\n\r\nliteracy  skills under this programme.  The Learning  Support\r\n\r\nprogramme is supplemented by the Encouraging Achievement  and\r\n\r\nBetter Learning programme, or Enable, to help students up  to\r\n\r\nPrimary  3  level in English and Mathematics.  Students  with\r\n\r\nspecial needs have benefited from the two programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are these students with special needs? There are\r\n\r\ntwo  main  groups - those with learning difficulty and  those\r\n\r\nwith  learning  disability.  A sizeable  number  of  students\r\n\r\nexperience  learning difficulty because they  did  not  fully\r\n\r\nattend  kindergarten classes or face family problems.   About\r\n\r\n1,029 are born with learning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisabilities,  like dyslexia, mild autism, attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder,   or  are  educationally   subnormal.\r\n\r\nThese students are the less successful in our schools.   They\r\n\r\nrun a high risk of dropping out from the system.  They cannot\r\n\r\neven  read simple words like \"the\", \"cat\" or \"dog\" when  they\r\n\r\nare in Primary 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the House agrees that every child matters, I think\r\n\r\nthat  we  should  pay  more  attention  to  help  those  less\r\n\r\nsuccessful children with special needs.  Our mildly  autistic\r\n\r\nand dyslexic children require specialist attention, attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder  (ADHD)  students  are   often\r\n\r\nbranded  as  deviants, as the teachers, given the class  size\r\n\r\nthat  they  have  to manage, cannot give these  students  the\r\n\r\nattention   that  their  condition  demands.    Educationally\r\n\r\nsubnormal (ESN) students are those with IQ between 50 and  70\r\n\r\nand need more individualised coaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students with learning disability may attend special\r\n\r\neducation  schools.   But some parents prefer  them  not  to.\r\n\r\nSome  parents  want to hide the fact that their children  are\r\n\r\nESN.   Some  special education schools are too far away,  too\r\n\r\ntiring  and  inconvenient  for the  children.   The  cost  of\r\n\r\nattending special education schools is also a deterrent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that MOE is very supportive of special education\r\n\r\nschools.  MOE has been helping the Autism Resource Centre and\r\n\r\nthe  Dyslexia Association of Singapore with their funding and\r\n\r\nstart  up of new centres.  But the fees are still prohibitive\r\n\r\nto  some  parents.   For example, the term fee  for  dyslexic\r\n\r\nchildren is $450, not for full-time study, but just for twice-a-week tuition.  Not all parents can afford this amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long waiting list is another reason. I understand\r\n\r\nthat three new special education schools are being built  and\r\n\r\nanother  nine  are  being planned.   But  they  can  only  be\r\n\r\ncompleted  in year 2004.  This is a very long wait for  those\r\n\r\non the waiting list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my third point of clarification is whether MOE can\r\n\r\ndevote more attention\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto help our less successful students with special needs?  Can\r\n\r\nthe  Learning  Support  programme be extended  to  go  beyond\r\n\r\nPrimary  2?  Can the Government review its funding level  for\r\n\r\nspecial education schools, making their fees more affordable?\r\n\r\nCan we give more recognition to teachers in special education\r\n\r\nschools, who have a more difficult job than most teachers  in\r\n\r\nmainstream  schools?  Can we speed up the  planning  for  the\r\n\r\nnine  proposed special education schools and in the meanwhile\r\n\r\nprovide alternatives for students on the waiting list?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if Compulsory Education is premised upon the\r\n\r\nprinciple that every child matters, we must do more  to  help\r\n\r\nour  students  with  special needs.   We  must  provide  more\r\n\r\nsupport  to  the voluntary welfare organisations and  special\r\n\r\neducation schools helping these students.  We must give  more\r\n\r\nrecognition  to  our  teachers in the  Learning  Support  and\r\n\r\nEnable  programmes  in our mainstream national  schools.   We\r\n\r\nmust  also  give credit to the teachers and staff in  special\r\n\r\neducation schools for their love, patience and care for these\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth and final point, Sir, is how we are preparing\r\n\r\nour  students for the challenges in the New Economy.  I  have\r\n\r\nalready mentioned that some Primary 6 EM3 students are unable\r\n\r\nto  construct  a grammatically correct sentence  in  English.\r\n\r\nClearly,   this   defeats  a  key  objective  of   Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, one reason for keeping the below average\r\n\r\nstudents  in  school  is to keep them off the  streets.   EM3\r\n\r\nstudents can fail all their subjects from Primary 1 to 6 with\r\n\r\nno  risk  of  being detained in the same level or kicked  out\r\n\r\nfrom the school.  Even if they fail to pick up any skills  in\r\n\r\nschools,  at  least their time with bad company and  negative\r\n\r\ninfluence has been minimised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the New Economy has redefined the requirement of\r\n\r\nbasic  skills.   It  is not good enough just  to  keep  below\r\n\r\naverage  students in schools, to keep them off  the  streets.\r\n\r\nIt is of little use to have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompulsory  Education  in the New Economy,  if  some  of  our\r\n\r\nstudents are not equipped with the basics at the end of their\r\n\r\nlearning journeys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must dedicate more resources to help our weaker\r\n\r\nstudents.   We  should do more to help those weaker  students\r\n\r\nwho  are  under-prepared  for  the  challenges  for  the  New\r\n\r\nEconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Sir, we have parents who over-prepare\r\n\r\ntheir  children  for the New Economy.  Many parents  complain\r\n\r\nthat   our  education  system  has  become  too  competitive.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  they are partly to be blamed as they  inject  their\r\n\r\nkiasuism  into  the  system.  But if so many  parents  engage\r\n\r\nprivate  tuition  teachers, and you are  not  doing  it,  you\r\n\r\nwonder if you are giving enough to your child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many busy dual-income parents engage private tutors for\r\n\r\ntheir  children in the lower primary.  Many secondary  school\r\n\r\nstudents   have   different  private  tutors  for   different\r\n\r\nsubjects.   The  private tuition fee per hour  for  a  junior\r\n\r\ncollege student is a hefty $100.  Not every parent can afford\r\n\r\nthis.   I am not sure what our private tutor to student ratio\r\n\r\nis, but our ranking in the world must surely be very high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have been selling photocopied past year test papers\r\n\r\nfor  the top primary schools, including papers at the Primary\r\n\r\n1  level.   Believe  me,  these are  much  coveted  by  eager\r\n\r\nparents.   Bookstores are flooded with assessment books,  and\r\n\r\nthere  is usually a long queue for these books at the end  of\r\n\r\nthe  year,  because  parents want their children  to  have  a\r\n\r\nheadstart on next year's syllabus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, this is why we have the undesired tag as being\r\n\r\nthe  most-bespectacled nation in the world.  It is  also  not\r\n\r\nsurprising  that  many of our parents are  stressed  up  when\r\n\r\ntheir  children's examination approaches.  I sometimes wonder\r\n\r\nwho  is taking the examination in school - the parents or the\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of many working parents who apply leave to coach\r\n\r\ntheir children for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  examinations, the children's examination, that is.   I\r\n\r\nknow  of  many  couples who refuse to have any more  children\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  stress  of  raising  children  through  our\r\n\r\neducation  system.  Some of these stress factors  were  self-inflicted and unnecessary.  Nevertheless, they are very  real\r\n\r\nto almost every Singapore parent.  And the last thing that we\r\n\r\nall  want  is a generation of overly stressed-up parents  and\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, we cannot put the blame entirely on our\r\n\r\nparents for this kiasu attitude in our education system.   If\r\n\r\nour school system is fully adequate, will there still be such\r\n\r\na  prevalent need for private tuition?  If we have a  smaller\r\n\r\nand   more  manageable  teacher-to-student  ratio,  such   as\r\n\r\nstudents  get  more individual attention from teachers,  will\r\n\r\nprivate  tutors  still be in such high demand?   If  we  have\r\n\r\nsingle  session  primary schools where  weaker  students  are\r\n\r\ngiven extra coaching, will there still be a need for so  much\r\n\r\nhelp  outside the school system?  If we recruit,  retain  and\r\n\r\ntrain  more  teachers, if we ensure more  teaching  time  for\r\n\r\nstudents in school, will parents still need to spend so  much\r\n\r\ntime and additional money on their children's education?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the litmus test for a successful education system\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  is  in making the system so adequate  for  all\r\n\r\nstudents  that, parental support aside, there is  still  need\r\n\r\nfor extra private tuition.  If a huge number of students have\r\n\r\nto  turn to outside help, then the system is surely not fully\r\n\r\nadequate.   On  this basis, I am not convinced  that  we  are\r\n\r\npreparing  all our students and their parents adequately  for\r\n\r\nthe challenges in the New Economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, are we sufficiently preparing our\r\n\r\nbelow average students for the challenges in the New Economy?\r\n\r\nShould  the EM3 system be reviewed?  Can we do more  to  help\r\n\r\nour  weaker students?  Can we help them and ensure that  they\r\n\r\nhave  at  least the basics before they are allowed  to  leave\r\n\r\nschool?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, are our parents unduly stressed and\r\n\r\nover-taxed due to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninadequate  teaching time in our education system?   Are  our\r\n\r\nstudents   getting  enough  individual  attention  from   our\r\n\r\nteachers?   Are we contented to maintain the same teacher-to-student  ratio  of 1 teacher to about 30 to  40  students,  a\r\n\r\nratio  that  we  have  probably been  keeping  for  the  past\r\n\r\ndecades?  Are teachers getting enough attention from  MOE  to\r\n\r\nhelp  them  reduce  the  administrative  workload?   Are   we\r\n\r\ncreating  a conducive environment for our teachers  to  reach\r\n\r\nout to individual students and transform their lives?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill on the premise that every child\r\n\r\nmatters,  especially as we move into the New Economy.   Given\r\n\r\nour   population  size,  the  scarcity  and  value  of  human\r\n\r\nresource,  every  child does matter.   If  every  child  does\r\n\r\nmatter,  we  need to move away from the current system  based\r\n\r\nprincipally on a mass production process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that most of the issues that I have just\r\n\r\nraised  in  relation to the Bill are not necessarily  new  to\r\n\r\nMOE.   I  know that MOE is considering single session primary\r\n\r\nschools, but is only prepared to make a decision on  this  in\r\n\r\ntwo  to  three  years' time.  I know that MOE is  seeking  to\r\n\r\nrecruit  and retain more quality teachers, and with that,  we\r\n\r\ncan  hopefully  have a smaller teacher-to-student  ratio.

We have, similarly, come to a juncture where a\r\n\r\nparadigm shift is needed in how we teach our children in  the\r\n\r\nNew Economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister once said, and I quote him, that \"In the\r\n\r\n21st  century, Education must not just respond to change  but\r\n\r\nbe at the forefront of change.

Some   of   them   have   given   extensive\r\n\r\nrecommendations on how to improve the education system  which\r\n\r\nare not directly connected with Compulsory Education, and the\r\n\r\nMinistry   will   certainly   take   on   board   all   these\r\n\r\nrecommendations and study them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wong has dealt with most of the questions raised by\r\n\r\nthe  Members earlier, and Minister Abdullah Tarmugi has  also\r\n\r\nresponded  to the issues related to madrasahs.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  reiterate  on  this  issue of  the  madrasahs,  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment had no intention, and has no intention,  to  close\r\n\r\nthe  madrasahs.   And quite on the contrary,  the  Government\r\n\r\nrecognises  the  need  of  the  Muslim  community  to   train\r\n\r\nreligious  leaders  from  among its  own  numbers.   This  is\r\n\r\nsomething good for the community and also good for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to address one important issue with\r\n\r\nregard to Compulsory Education before rounding up the debate.\r\n\r\nThis  is  on the issue related to enforcement.  And  this  is\r\n\r\nwhat  indeed makes a difference between Compulsory  Education\r\n\r\nfrom  the  current  situation  today  where  parents  can  be\r\n\r\npersuaded, but cannot be compelled, to send their children to\r\n\r\nschool.   This is really the basic difference between  having\r\n\r\nCompulsory Education and not.  Today there are no  powers  to\r\n\r\ncompel parents to do so, and no recourse if parents refuse to\r\n\r\ndischarge  this  responsibility even  after  all  efforts  at\r\n\r\npersuasion have failed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have suggested that prosecution should\r\n\r\nnot  be  the preferred approach, and some Members - Mr Chiam,\r\n\r\nMr  Iswaran  -  have also expressed concerns that  fining  or\r\n\r\njailing  parents will not help to solve the problem  of  non-compliance but may instead adversely affect the children  and\r\n\r\ntheir family and make things worse.  I agree with them that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprosecution, and certainly jail, is not the preferred or best\r\n\r\napproach, and I have said so in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persuasion is, indeed, the preferred approach to take so\r\n\r\nthat  parents will understand and want to send their children\r\n\r\nto  school  to  take  advantage of  the  excellent  education\r\n\r\nopportunities  available for their children.  The  Government\r\n\r\nprovides school places for all children who want an education\r\n\r\nin  national  schools, and will continue to  ensure  that  no\r\n\r\nchild  is  deprived  of  an education  because  of  financial\r\n\r\nreasons.  In fact, primary school education is free and there\r\n\r\nare a variety of financial assistance schemes in the schools,\r\n\r\nin  the community, from voluntary welfare organisations  and,\r\n\r\nmost  recently,  in the Straits Times, to  help  ensure  that\r\n\r\nbeyond school fees, for the daily needs of the children  when\r\n\r\nthey  go  to  school, whether it is pocket  money,  uniforms,\r\n\r\ntextbooks  -  there are various schemes to help  ensure  that\r\n\r\nchildren  can  go  to  school  regardless  of  the  financial\r\n\r\nsituation of their families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory Education buttresses the commitment of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  by  setting  out  a  framework  for  counselling,\r\n\r\nmediation and further rounds of counselling and mediation  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure that every effort is made to get parents  to  send\r\n\r\ntheir  children to school.  Indeed, these things are  already\r\n\r\nbeing done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if we want to have Compulsory Education and for\r\n\r\nCompulsory  Education  to take effect, then  penal  sanctions\r\n\r\nmust  be  put in place.  This will send a strong signal  that\r\n\r\nthis  House means business when it says that education is  so\r\n\r\nvital  for  our  children that it should be made  compulsory.\r\n\r\nAnd Government must be prepared to enforce such sanctions  to\r\n\r\ngive  Compulsory  Education the force of  law  if  persuasion\r\n\r\nfails.   It  would be better not to have Compulsory Education\r\n\r\nif  we  are  not  prepared  to enforce  Compulsory  Education\r\n\r\nthrough legal means as there would be no action that could be\r\n\r\ntaken  if repeated attempts at persuasion are ignored, or  if\r\n\r\nthe person just refuses to turn up to be persuaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penal sanctions will only be a last resort, after\r\n\r\nextensive efforts in counselling and community mediation have\r\n\r\nbeen   exhausted.   Schools,  the  Ministry   of   Education,\r\n\r\nvoluntary  welfare organisations, the Ministry  of  Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  and  Sports and the Compulsory  Education  Board\r\n\r\nwill play a part in this comprehensive process.  This process\r\n\r\nis  detailed  in  the report of the Committee  on  Compulsory\r\n\r\nEducation.  I believe the Clerk of Parliament has some papers\r\n\r\n(Cols.  971-972),  which I have requested him  to  pass  out,\r\n\r\ndetailing this process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20001009/20001009-HA-0720971.gif\">Chart - Mediation Processes for Cases of Non-Registration and Dropout (Cols. 971-972)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the proposed model of mediation and counselling\r\n\r\nbefore  we  take  any  action,  which  incorporates  existing\r\n\r\nprocedures  I  must  say,  the  Ministry  of  Education  will\r\n\r\nidentify  the children who have not registered with  national\r\n\r\nschools and are not exempted from Compulsory Education at the\r\n\r\nend  of  the Primary 1 registration exercise each year.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education will attempt to contact the parents  of\r\n\r\nthese children at their last known addresses and find out why\r\n\r\nthese children have not been registered for Primary 1.  As Mr\r\n\r\nSimon  Tay has said, despite our reputation for being a nanny\r\n\r\nstate, we do not really know where everybody is all the time,\r\n\r\nand I think most Singaporeans will be glad to know that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education will advise the parents to\r\n\r\nregister  their child for a place in a national  school.   If\r\n\r\nthe advice is not heeded, these cases will be referred to the\r\n\r\nrelevant organisations, such as Family Service Centres run by\r\n\r\nvoluntary   welfare   organisations,  for   counselling   and\r\n\r\nassistance.   They will follow up to counsel  families,  help\r\n\r\nthem  deal with their root problems and persuade the  parents\r\n\r\nto send their children to school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all counselling and assistance efforts to convince\r\n\r\nthese  parents to register their children for schooling fail,\r\n\r\nthe  cases will be referred to counselling officers  who  had\r\n\r\nnot  handled  the cases previously, to bring to the  parents'\r\n\r\nattention the legal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsequences of non-compliance, and to persuade them to enrol\r\n\r\ntheir children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the parents still refuse to send their children to\r\n\r\nschool,  the  Compulsory Education Board will  examine  their\r\n\r\ncase and, if necessary, call them up for a formal\r\n\r\nhearing  to  determine what further action should  be  taken.\r\n\r\nThe Board may then decide whether to refer the cases back for\r\n\r\nfurther  counselling or to the Director-General of Education.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not intended for the Board to be heavily staffed  for\r\n\r\nthe  occasional case that may arise and which it may have  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with.  Instead, the Compulsory Education Board will  be\r\n\r\nable to call upon the resources of the Ministry of Education,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Community Development and Sports,  voluntary\r\n\r\nwelfare  organisations and other organisations which will  be\r\n\r\nable to provide counselling services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At every stage, we have provided for counselling and\r\n\r\nassistance,  so  that parents have every  opportunity  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven  the necessary advice and assistance to register  their\r\n\r\nchildren for school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only parents who persistently refuse to send their\r\n\r\nchildren to school, despite elaborate and exhaustive  efforts\r\n\r\nto  counsel and help them, will be referred to the  Director-General  of  Education to consider taking  action  under  the\r\n\r\nproposed Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even at this stage, the Director-General can decide to\r\n\r\ncompound  the offence and impose fines of up to $2000.   Only\r\n\r\nas a last resort, will the Director-General refer the case to\r\n\r\nthe  courts.   I  am  sure  that the  courts  will  mete  out\r\n\r\npenalties  in  a judicious manner so as to strike  a  balance\r\n\r\nbetween  sending a clear signal to parents about this House's\r\n\r\nseriousness  in wanting to enforce Compulsory Education,  and\r\n\r\nthe  long  term interests of the affected children and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the tools to give effect to the law have to be put\r\n\r\nin place.  Enforcement using legal means is exercised only as\r\n\r\na last resort when all else fails - when the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompulsory  Education Board is of the opinion that  the  case\r\n\r\nhas to be referred to the Director-General of Education.  And\r\n\r\neven  then,  there  is  a gradation of legal  measures.   The\r\n\r\nDirector-General can compound the offences and impose a fine,\r\n\r\nor  refer to the courts which have a range of options in  the\r\n\r\npenalties to be meted out.  But I hope that we do not have to\r\n\r\nuse these tools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has all along taken the\r\n\r\nposition  that  parental responsibility in the  education  of\r\n\r\ntheir  children  must not be undermined.  The recommendations\r\n\r\nof  the Committee on Compulsory Education are consistent with\r\n\r\nthis  position.  The Bill has made it clear that parents  are\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  enrolling  their  children  in  school  and\r\n\r\nensuring that they attend school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsibility of sending children to school still\r\n\r\nrests  firmly  on  parents,  and  Compulsory  Education  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to uphold the tenet of parental responsibility.  The\r\n\r\nBill reinforces this position by making it clear that parents\r\n\r\nhave   this   responsibility  under   the   law.    All   the\r\n\r\nopportunities    are   there.    The   Government    provides\r\n\r\nopportunities for children to get up to 10 years  of  primary\r\n\r\nand  secondary education, and indeed well beyond  that.   And\r\n\r\nmost children go on to do so:  85% to 90% of every cohort  go\r\n\r\non  to post-secondary education in our ITEs, polytechnics and\r\n\r\nthe  universities,  one  of the highest  percentages  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, in Singapore, most parents recognise their\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to  ensure  their  children  receive  a  good\r\n\r\neducation.  Singaporeans do want the best possible future for\r\n\r\ntheir  children  and know that this is best  secured  through\r\n\r\nquality education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory Education builds on this sense of parental\r\n\r\nresponsibility   by  setting  out  the  minimum   educational\r\n\r\nfoundation, and I stress minimum educational foundation - and\r\n\r\non  this  matter I agree with Members of this  House  -  that\r\n\r\nevery  Singaporean child needs, and overlaying  this  with  a\r\n\r\nformal  set of procedures to reach out to parents of children\r\n\r\nwho  have  not  enrolled their children in  primary  schools.\r\n\r\nThis sends out a strong signal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  everyone, especially parents, that education is  critical\r\n\r\nfor  their children to do well in the knowledge age.

May I say why I\r\n\r\nam  raising it.  The main reason is that so far, I have  been\r\n\r\ntalking  about  salaries  of  Ministers,  the  over-excessive\r\n\r\nsalaries paid to Ministers.

I want  to\r\n\r\nshow  that  my concern applies equally to the allowances  for\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament.  I also want to say that  I  am  not\r\n\r\nraising this out of pique, as may be thought by some Members,\r\n\r\nbecause  I am not paid the same allowance.  I only get  about\r\n\r\none-seventh of it.  I am quite satisfied with that.  It  only\r\n\r\nshows  the sort of puny mind of the PAP that they should  try\r\n\r\nand be vindictive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present allowance paid to the Members of Parliament,\r\n\r\nI  am  told, is $11,800, if they opt not to take the  medical\r\n\r\nbenefits that are accorded to Members of Parliament,  and  it\r\n\r\nis  $10,800,  if they opt for medical benefits.  Previous  to\r\n\r\nthis   revision, Members were paid slightly over $9,000.   If\r\n\r\nyou  consider that Members' allowances are exempt  from  tax,\r\n\r\nwhat  do  you get?  Members are being paid something  in  the\r\n\r\nregion of $13,000 or $14,000 a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to put to the House is: do we lack a sense\r\n\r\nof proportion when it comes to paying politicians - Ministers\r\n\r\nand  Members of Parliament?  I say this seriously, Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, when one considers that there are people in our\r\n\r\nsociety who are only paid $600  a month or even less, and for\r\n\r\nworking  for eight hours or more every day.  May I make  this\r\n\r\nobservation that politics is a vocation.  One chooses  to  go\r\n\r\ninto  politics  or go into Parliament and  be  a  Member  not\r\n\r\nbecause it is a job, or because it has an attractive pay, but\r\n\r\nbecause  of  one's feeling of a vocation, one's feeling  that\r\n\r\none  would  like to contribute towards a better society,  the\r\n\r\npresent society which he finds himself.  That is probably why\r\n\r\nthe  term  \"allowances\"  is used rather  than  a  salary  for\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament.  I want to ask:  are  we  lacking  a\r\n\r\nsense  of  proportion  when  we are  paying  the  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  in  this House $14,000 a month?   The  public  is\r\n\r\nentitled  to know, as I have been saying they ought  to  know\r\n\r\nhow  Ministers are paid.  The public is entitled to know  how\r\n\r\nthis sum has been arrived at.

In Singapore, Parliament sits every six weeks\r\n\r\nor  so  and only for an afternoon or perhaps two, or it might\r\n\r\nsometimes stretch to three.  This, of course, is outside  the\r\n\r\nBudget  sessions.  Members are not obliged to give  up  their\r\n\r\nother  work or pursuit of their professions to be Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament.   And  even  beyond that, there  are  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament who have very rarely spoken in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is the workload of Members in this House that\r\n\r\njustifies a payment of the sums that I have said earlier?  Do\r\n\r\nthey have to travel long distances to come into Parliament as\r\n\r\nis  the  case  in other countries?  Do they have to  maintain\r\n\r\nresidences near Parliament to be able to attend the sittings,\r\n\r\nwhich  they  have  to  do in other countries?   How  is  this\r\n\r\ndecided?  What  is the workload?  Has that  been  taken  into\r\n\r\naccount?   I am only talking about Members of Parliament.   I\r\n\r\nhave  dealt  with the workload of Ministers and I  have  said\r\n\r\nthat  their workload did not justify the salaries.   But  the\r\n\r\npublic  is  entitled  to  ask  how  are  Members'  allowances\r\n\r\njustified when Parliament only sits one or two days every six\r\n\r\nweeks and that only for an afternoon of four or five hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Members will say, \"Well, it is not just work\r\n\r\ninside this House.

I   was  a  Member  of  Parliament,   with   a\r\n\r\nconstituency to take charge of, for four or five years and  I\r\n\r\nknow  what  was required outside this House as  a  Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament  -  meeting my constituents once  a  week  in  the\r\n\r\nevenings.

I\r\n\r\nam  quite  serious about this.  Let the public know how  this\r\n\r\npayment  is  justified and not come up with answers  that  we\r\n\r\nwould not be able to attract MPs in.  Is that the reason?  If\r\n\r\nthat  is  the  reason for paying Members of  Parliament  this\r\n\r\namount, then I am afraid it is the wrong reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, politics is a vocation and you seek to\r\n\r\nenter  Parliament because you feel you wish to  do  something\r\n\r\nabout  bettering the society from its present state.  I  hope\r\n\r\nwhoever  replies  will  give us  an  assessment  of  how  the\r\n\r\nallowances  were arrived at.  Unless the public is  satisfied\r\n\r\nthat  politicians do not just go into Parliament  because  of\r\n\r\nsalaries    or   the   benefits,   but   there   are    heavy\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  carried by them, they will  begin  to  lose\r\n\r\ntheir interest or trust in politicians and that will be a sad\r\n\r\nthing  for  Singapore.  And as I have said, many  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  have their own jobs or professions to  follow  or\r\n\r\npractise.  Are they required to absent themselves from  their\r\n\r\nother jobs to attend sittings of Parliament?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us have a sense of proportion about the payments.\r\n\r\nLet  us try and justify to the taxpayers because it is  their\r\n\r\nmoney,  they  are our pay masters, to justify  to  them  that\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament in Singapore do need and justify  the\r\n\r\npayments  that  are  being  made  to  them  in  the  form  of\r\n\r\nallowances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Soo Sen):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam made a\r\n\r\nspeech  on the allowances of Members of Parliament.  He  felt\r\n\r\nthat  Members of Parliament were over-paid and there  was  no\r\n\r\nbasis  for the computation of the allowances.  Let  me  share\r\n\r\nwith   him   the  criteria  on  which  the  allowances   were\r\n\r\nformulated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Are you on the Committee?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> I am not on the Committee. But the\r\n\r\nMember  of  Parliament's allowance has been based on  68%  of\r\n\r\nGrade  G  Administrative Officer's salary.  This has been  so\r\n\r\neven before the July 2000 salary revision.  This same formula\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  apply.  The criteria of arriving  at  Grade  G\r\n\r\nAdministrative  Officer's  salary  have  been  very   clearly\r\n\r\nexplained by the Deputy Prime Minister when he presented  the\r\n\r\nsalary  revision proposal to this House in June. The  formula\r\n\r\nis  what  we  call  the  15P32.  I do  not  know  whether  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam was here when this formula was presented.   It  is\r\n\r\ndefined  as  the principal earned income of the  15th  person\r\n\r\naged  32 belonging to the 6 benchmark professions, and  these\r\n\r\nare  the  bankers, accountants, engineers, lawyers, MNCs  and\r\n\r\nlocal manufacturers.  So, you get the people who are aged  32\r\n\r\nin the six professions, rank them, get number 15, look at the\r\n\r\nsalary,  that is the benchmark for Grade G.  And the  elected\r\n\r\nMembers  of Parliament's allowance is 68% of that.  This  was\r\n\r\nthe  basis  before the salary revision.  This  is  still  the\r\n\r\nbasis  today.   The fact that elected Members of Parliament's\r\n\r\nallowance has gone up by roughly 30% is because the  Grade  G\r\n\r\nbenchmark based on the market has gone up by about  30%.   It\r\n\r\nis  therefore  not  true  that there  is  no  basis  for  the\r\n\r\ncomputation of the elected Member of Parliament's allowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask by way of clarification?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Do you wish to give way, Mr Chan?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> All right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Thank you.

Well said\r\n\r\nindeed.   I would want to assure Mr Jeyaretnam that at  least\r\n\r\nfor  the PAP, we select our candidates based on whether  they\r\n\r\nconsider  politics as a vocation.  We the PAP MPs  are  very,\r\n\r\nvery  clear that we are subjecting ourselves to the  judgment\r\n\r\nof   the  electorate,  and  we  trust  the  judgment  of  the\r\n\r\nelectorate.  The electorate is able to look at every  one  of\r\n\r\nus  and  see  whether this MP comes just to  go  through  the\r\n\r\nmotion  or is he or she really committed to be a good  Member\r\n\r\nof  Parliament.  A good Member of Parliament is on call seven\r\n\r\ndays  a week, 24 hours a day nowadays.  I am not saying  that\r\n\r\nhe  is  physically in the constituency all the  time.

Therefore, fees and charges are reviewed\r\n\r\nregularly  to  ensure that fee increases,  if  need  be,  are\r\n\r\nminimised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last fee revision was more than 21/2 years ago. As a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the   economic crisis, Government  hospitals  and\r\n\r\npolyclinics  refrained from revising their  fees  last  year.\r\n\r\nHowever, with the recovery of our economy this year, there is\r\n\r\na  need  to  revise  the fees to recover  part  of  the  cost\r\n\r\nincreases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hospitals and polyclinics need to revise their fees\r\n\r\nregularly to keep up with the increase in their running cost.\r\n\r\nThe  increase in running cost is in part due to the  rise  in\r\n\r\nmanpower cost, which is the single largest cost component  at\r\n\r\n60%  of  total running cost.  To keep pace with  advances  in\r\n\r\nmedical  technology,  the cost of medical  supplies  such  as\r\n\r\ndrugs,  which  account for another 15% of the  total  running\r\n\r\ncost,   will  also  rise.  The  cost  of  replacing   medical\r\n\r\nequipment,  utilities, etc. will also add to the increase  in\r\n\r\nhospitals' running cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore unrealistic to expect our hospitals and\r\n\r\npolyclinics   not  to  increase  their  fees   and   charges.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  should  therefore  expect  such   regular   fee\r\n\r\nrevisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will, however, continue to bear the major\r\n\r\nresponsibility in absorbing the increase in health care costs\r\n\r\nfor  subsidised patients. Basic medical care in the class  B2\r\n\r\nand  C  wards  of the public sector hospitals and  outpatient\r\n\r\nclinics  will continue to be heavily subsidised,  and  remain\r\n\r\naffordable to the lower income group.

The operators of these cranes are\r\n\r\nrequired  to  complete a course and test at the  Construction\r\n\r\nIndustry  Training  Institute (CITI).   Currently  there  are\r\n\r\nabout 1,500 licensed tower crane operators with approximately\r\n\r\n37% foreigners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last two years, there had been a drop in income\r\n\r\nand  job opportunities for crane operators.  But this is  not\r\n\r\njust  the  result  of  entry of foreigners  into  this  area.\r\n\r\nDuring  this  period the construction industry  went  into  a\r\n\r\ndecline.   For  the first half of this year,  the  industry's\r\n\r\noutput  is only 81% of the 1998 output over the same  period.\r\n\r\nUnder   such  circumstances,  it  is  unfortunate   but   not\r\n\r\nunexpected  that  workers in the industry  will  suffer  wage\r\n\r\ncuts.   Since  there are fewer construction  projects,  fewer\r\n\r\ncranes would be deployed and jobs for crane operator is bound\r\n\r\nto  suffer.   The prospects for crane operators  are  closely\r\n\r\ntied to the prospect for the construction industry.

A  new  Economic\r\n\r\nCreativity  Index  that  measures these  attributes  was  put\r\n\r\ntogether and given one-third of the total weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US was the runaway winner in this category, far\r\n\r\nsurpassing  second-placed Finland  which  ranked  second  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  which  ranked third.  The  US'  number  1  ranking\r\n\r\nreflects its strength as the global leader in innovation  and\r\n\r\ntechnology.

We will only know over the long term how successful we\r\n\r\nare.    Judging   from   the   initial   response   to    the\r\n\r\nTechnopreneurship 21 initiative which was launched  in  April\r\n\r\n1999,  I  am  not  pessimistic.   Rules  and  regulations  to\r\n\r\nsupport enterprise have been changed.  Start-ups can now list\r\n\r\non our stock exchange, our taxation of the ESOP scheme is now\r\n\r\nmore attractive and technopreneurs can set up offices in  HDB\r\n\r\nhomes.   There are now more venture capital funds and joining\r\n\r\na start-up is no longer unusual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of the New Economy will eventually affect all\r\n\r\nsectors of our economy.  The tradeable sectors have responded\r\n\r\nthe  most  quickly.   Many companies have shifted  to  higher\r\n\r\nvalue  added activities in Singapore.  These require  workers\r\n\r\nwho  are  innovative and better trained.  It is a  matter  of\r\n\r\ntime  before  the other sectors are similarly  affected.

The\r\n\r\nproportion  of  job  seekers aged  40  to  54  had  increased\r\n\r\ncompared  with  June 1997, before the onset of  the  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn.  In June 1997, this age cohort accounted for 26% of\r\n\r\njob seekers.  The increase in share of unemployed persons for\r\n\r\nthe  mature  workers  was  also felt across  all  educational\r\n\r\ngroupings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the main focus of Government funded training\r\n\r\nis  to  enhance  the employability of lower  skilled  workers\r\n\r\nbecause  they are more vulnerable to structural unemployment.\r\n\r\nMost  of  training programmes for this group of  workers  are\r\n\r\nfunded  by  the Skills Development Fund (SDF) and the  Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme (SRP).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY98, the SDF committed about $82 million in training\r\n\r\ngrants.   This  helped support the course  fees  for  530,000\r\n\r\ntraining  places  in the areas of Technical  Service  Skills,\r\n\r\nComputer-related  Skills,  Productivity  and  Quality-related\r\n\r\nSkills,  Technical  Production and  Engineering  Skills,  and\r\n\r\nTrade and Craft Skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of course fee subsidy provided by the SDF, the\r\n\r\nGovernment also spent about $20 million per year to fund  the\r\n\r\nabsentee  payroll  for employers sending  their  workers  for\r\n\r\ncertifiable training under the SRP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises that older workers face\r\n\r\ngreater  barriers to re-training. Therefore, the SDF and  SRP\r\n\r\nalso provide enhanced funding for training of workers aged 40\r\n\r\nand  above  with  higher  course fees  and  absentee  payroll\r\n\r\nsubsidies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the retrenched, unemployed or self-employed, SDF and SRP assistance are available to them\r\n\r\nthrough  the  Community  Development Councils  and  self-help\r\n\r\ngroups  acting as surrogate employers.  Individuals can  sign\r\n\r\nup   for  part-time  or  full-time  training  through   these\r\n\r\nsurrogate  employers.  Unemployed individuals are also  given\r\n\r\nsome  financial  support to tide them  over  their  financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties  during their training period.   In  1999,  more\r\n\r\nthan  200  individuals attended full-time training and  about\r\n\r\n4,000   participated  in  part-time  training  through   this\r\n\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approval for subsidy by SDF and SRP is based on the\r\n\r\nrelevance  and  quality  of the training  courses.   This  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to ensure that training leads to skills  upgrading\r\n\r\nand   better  employability.

The report  has\r\n\r\nrecommended   a  \"new  age\"  FTA.   Besides  the  traditional\r\n\r\nelements  of  liberalisation of trade in goods and  services,\r\n\r\nand  investment guarantees, new elements of collaboration  in\r\n\r\nhigh-growth  areas  such  as info-communications  technology,\r\n\r\nfinancial services and life sciences have also been included.\r\n\r\nThe  report, which has been published, has been submitted  to\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Ministers of both sides for  a  decision  on  the\r\n\r\nlaunching of formal negotiations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Mexico-Singapore FTA, we have conducted three\r\n\r\nrounds  of negotiations since my visit to Mexico in May  this\r\n\r\nyear.    As agreed between myself and my Mexican counterpart,\r\n\r\nDr   Herminio   Blanco,  we  should  try  to   complete   our\r\n\r\nnegotiations for a Mexico-Singapore FTA by November, in  time\r\n\r\nfor  PM Goh and President Zedillo to witness its signing when\r\n\r\nthe  President  is in South East Asia for the  APEC  Leaders'\r\n\r\nMeeting.   However, if negotiations cannot  be  completed  by\r\n\r\nthen,  we  will continue the negotiations and aim to complete\r\n\r\nthese   by   the   middle  of  next   year.    The   incoming\r\n\r\nadministration  of  President-elect  Fox  has  expressed  his\r\n\r\nsupport for the free trade agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also held exploratory talks with Canada on a\r\n\r\nCanada-Singapore FTA.  Singapore sees strategic value in such\r\n\r\nan  FTA, that will build a further bridge across the Pacific.\r\n\r\nWe  hope  to  launch  formal negotiations once  the  Canadian\r\n\r\nCabinet gives its formal endorsement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the AEM meeting in Chiangmai last week, the Ministers\r\n\r\nof  ASEAN,  Australia and New Zealand agreed to  put  on  the\r\n\r\nofficial  agenda  the  consideration  of  a  Closer  Economic\r\n\r\nPartnership  (CEP) between AFTA and CER. Such  a  Partnership\r\n\r\nwill  involve an enlarged market size of 530 million  people,\r\n\r\nand a combined GDP of over US$1.2 trillion. A high level Task\r\n\r\nForce,  led  by Mr Cesar Virata, has completed  an  excellent\r\n\r\nreport on the value of such an agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay asked how such FTAs benefit our workforce and\r\n\r\nbusiness  community.   There  are  substantive  as  well   as\r\n\r\nstrategic benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substantively, FTAs provide for a higher level of\r\n\r\nliberalisation  in  trade  in  goods  and  services,  and  in\r\n\r\ninvestment.  Our  manufacturers and traders can  enjoy  lower\r\n\r\ntariff  and  better market access. Provisions  to  facilitate\r\n\r\ntrade  and  to  remove non-tariff barriers will also  promote\r\n\r\nfaster  and  more  efficient flow of goods, thereby  lowering\r\n\r\nbusiness   costs.   These  provisions  include   the   mutual\r\n\r\nrecognition  of standards and conformance measures,  and  the\r\n\r\nsimplification  of  customs procedure.   Our  consumers  also\r\n\r\nbenefit from a greater variety of products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our businesses have also embarked on a\r\n\r\nglobalisation  strategy.   FTAs  help  to  open  up  markets,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  services,  and provide  legal  safeguards  on\r\n\r\ninvestments.  This  facilitates  our  businesses   in   their\r\n\r\noverseas  ventures.  It also helps us to draw in  investments\r\n\r\nand create jobs for our workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FTAs can also have collaboration elements to deepen\r\n\r\neconomic   linkages  between  the  partner  economies.    For\r\n\r\nexample,  the  proposed Japan Singapore Economic  Partnership\r\n\r\nAgreement (JSEPA) includes collaboration in high-growth, high-tech  areas.  These can help us create high value-added  jobs\r\n\r\nin both countries, and enhance our competitiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FTAs are also of strategic importance for our long-term\r\n\r\nprosperity, and to our ability to create jobs.  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nhighly  dependent on trade, which is almost 3 times our  GDP.\r\n\r\nAs  the  world  is  our  hinterland, a strong  and  effective\r\n\r\nmultilateral   trading  system  is  in  our  best   long-term\r\n\r\ninterest.   We  therefore attach the greatest  importance  to\r\n\r\nmultilateral liberalisation under the WTO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liberalisation of trade and investments under the WTO\r\n\r\ntakes  time,  as  138 members are involved. To  catalyse  the\r\n\r\nliberalisation process, like-minded countries can move  ahead\r\n\r\nwith  bolder liberalisation measures.  The benefits  of  such\r\n\r\nmeasures  will have a demonstration effect and build momentum\r\n\r\nfor  further liberalisation.  In this way, FTAs can serve  as\r\n\r\nbuilding blocks to the WTO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, however, important that FTAs do not lead to the\r\n\r\nformation of inward looking, protectionist blocs. Hence,  our\r\n\r\nFTAs  are consistent with WTO requirements, and are  open  to\r\n\r\naccession by other members.   Singapore's FTA partners, which\r\n\r\nspan   different  continents  and  regions,  can  help  forge\r\n\r\nlinkages  across  regions and avert the  danger  of  a  world\r\n\r\nfragmenting into distinct trading blocs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FOREIGN MISSIONS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs  whether it is timely to establish resident  missions\r\n\r\nin  the  capitals  of  Canada and  Mexico,  in  view  of  our\r\n\r\nincreasing economic and trade links with those countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S.

It\r\n\r\nis  an issue that the Foreign Ministry reviews constantly and\r\n\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore, the key issue for our Foreign Service, in\r\n\r\nestablishing new Missions, is that of human resources.  There\r\n\r\nis   a   limited  talent  pool  from  which   we   draw   our\r\n\r\nrepresentatives and we have to send our best people  overseas\r\n\r\nto represent Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something we have explained to many of our\r\n\r\nforeign  partners.  We have to accept the fact that  it  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  possible  to  open  resident  Missions  in  all  189\r\n\r\ncountries in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have tried our best to balance our constraints with\r\n\r\nthe   need   to   advance  Singapore's  interests   overseas.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  have several arrangements  to  represent  our\r\n\r\ninterests  overseas,  even when  we  do   not  have  resident\r\n\r\nMissions.  For instance, we have a system of appointing  Non-Resident Ambassadors (NRAs).  There are now 21 NRAs.    These\r\n\r\nare  successful  and eminent citizens of  Singapore  who  are\r\n\r\nbased   in  Singapore  but  travel  to  their  countries   of\r\n\r\naccreditation  regularly.  For Mexico, we  have  had  a  Non-Resident Ambassador since 1997.  As for Canada, our Permanent\r\n\r\nRepresentative  to New York has been concurrently  accredited\r\n\r\nas  our  High  Commissioner  since  1969.   We  also  have  a\r\n\r\nConsulate in Vancouver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These arrangements, given our limited resources, are\r\n\r\nworking well.  Let me stress that the issue of representation\r\n\r\noverseas  is not a static one.  Our representation must  keep\r\n\r\nup  with changes in the global economy as well as with trends\r\n\r\nin  bilateral  trade and economic linkages.  If our  economic\r\n\r\npartnership   with   certain   countries   strengthens    and\r\n\r\nintensifies, then we will be prepared to review  the  current\r\n\r\narrangements.   Indeed, that is the hallmark  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nforeign policy, ie, to be nimble and flexible.  Let me assure\r\n\r\nthe  Member and the House that my Ministry constantly reviews\r\n\r\nhow  we  should  best  represent and  protect  our  interests\r\n\r\noverseas  in  all countries, including in Canada and  Mexico,\r\n\r\nwhich are, as pointed out by the Member, countries with  whom\r\n\r\nour economic and trade links have been increasing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Manpower\r\n\r\nwhether his Ministry will allow foreign students studying  in\r\n\r\ninstitutions   of  higher  learning  to  take  up   part-time\r\n\r\nemployment  so as to ease the labour shortage in  the  retail\r\n\r\nand service sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1st July 1994, my Ministry had allowed foreign\r\n\r\nstudents  above  14  years  of  age  and  who  are  full-time\r\n\r\nmatriculated  or registered student of approved  institutions\r\n\r\nof  higher  learning  (IHLs), post-secondary,  and  secondary\r\n\r\nschools to work during their vacation without having to apply\r\n\r\nfor a work permit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since January 1997, we had also allowed full time\r\n\r\nforeign  students in our tertiary institutions to  work  part\r\n\r\ntime without the need to apply for a work permit.
