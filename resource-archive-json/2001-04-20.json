The Medisave scheme  is\r\n\r\nprimarily designed to help individuals meet their personal or\r\n\r\nimmediate   family's  hospitalisation  expenses,   especially\r\n\r\nduring old age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has, in fact, over the years received many\r\n\r\nrequests  to allow Medisave to be used for medical  screening\r\n\r\nand  has consistently decided against it.  As the Member  has\r\n\r\npointed  out in the Question, there are many types of  health\r\n\r\nscreening,  and  many of these are really not cost-effective.\r\n\r\nFor  certain health screenings that are cost-effective,  such\r\n\r\nas  mammography  and pap smear, my Ministry  does  make  them\r\n\r\naffordable  by providing heavy subsidies at the  polyclinics,\r\n\r\nin fact, 50% subsidy.  Also, we have introduced the Community\r\n\r\nHealth   Screening  Programme  for  the  elderly  to   detect\r\n\r\ndiabetes, hypertension and high blood pressure.  The cost for\r\n\r\nthis  screening is very minimal as the elderly pays  only  $5\r\n\r\nfor  the  screening  which ordinarily would  have  cost  $20.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Singaporeans need not rely on Medisave to pay  for\r\n\r\ncost-effective health screening.  In any case,  if  we  allow\r\n\r\nMedisave to be used too liberally, it would result in  higher\r\n\r\nrates of contribution into the Medisave account.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On extending Medisave to non-working spouse,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  can  actually  top up  their  immediate  family\r\n\r\nmembers' Medisave if they do not have enough Medisave savings\r\n\r\nto  pay  for their medical bills.  This is in line  with  our\r\n\r\nobjective of promoting family support and resource pooling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FUND RAISING PROJECTS INVOLVING PUBLIC</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Review of laws and control)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Noris Ong\r\n\r\nChin Guan -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.

Unlike members-only  clubs,  proprietary clubs are  wholly  owned  by  their\r\n\r\nshareholders.  Members of proprietary clubs do  not  own  the\r\n\r\nclubs' assets; they purchase memberships in the clubs and pay\r\n\r\nmonthly  subscriptions, in return for access  to  the  clubs'\r\n\r\nservices.  The membership fees and monthly subscriptions  are\r\n\r\nrevenue  for  the clubs, out of which the clubs pay  for  the\r\n\r\nfacilities and their upkeep, and any surplus belongs  to  the\r\n\r\nshareholders of the clubs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of RTC, some members have alleged that they\r\n\r\nwere   misled  into  believing  that  only  5,000   exclusive\r\n\r\nmemberships   would   be  offered,  when  eventually   19,000\r\n\r\nmemberships were\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naccepted.   I  understand from media reports  that  they  are\r\n\r\nconsidering  filing  a  civil suit  against  the  proprietary\r\n\r\nowners of the Club on grounds of misrepresentation.  Our laws\r\n\r\ndo  provide  for aggrieved parties to initiate  civil  action\r\n\r\nagainst misrepresentation.  Since this may be the subject  of\r\n\r\ncourt   proceedings   between   private   parties,   it    is\r\n\r\ninappropriate for me to comment on it at this stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a registered company, RTC is governed by the\r\n\r\nCompanies Act, which sets out the duties of the directors  of\r\n\r\nthe  club,  and  specifies that they shall at all  times  act\r\n\r\nhonestly  and  use reasonable diligence in the  discharge  of\r\n\r\ntheir  duties.   The Commercial Affairs Department  (CAD)  is\r\n\r\ncurrently  investigating the case to  ascertain  whether  any\r\n\r\noffence  under the Companies Act or any other laws  has  been\r\n\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI will wait for the outcome of CAD's investigations\r\n\r\nbefore deciding whether any preventive action is necessary to\r\n\r\nregulate similar future fund-raising projects, especially the\r\n\r\nsale of club memberships to the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask the Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary whether the Ministry in the  meantime\r\n\r\ncan set up a hotline to answer queries from aggrieved members\r\n\r\nor complaints from members and to provide more information to\r\n\r\nthe Ministry or to facilitate CAD's investigations?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> The aggrieved parties may report to\r\n\r\nCAD  or,  alternatively, I would suggest that  the  aggrieved\r\n\r\nparties also report to CASE because CASE can help CAD in  its\r\n\r\ninvestigation, if necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Yes, CASE has received quite a number of\r\n\r\ncomplaints.

Executives and managers are  not  covered  by  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act.  Nevertheless, the Ministry  took  up  their\r\n\r\nclaims with employers and provided conciliation service  with\r\n\r\nthe view to resolving such disputes amicably.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, 157 cases involving executives and managers,\r\n\r\ntogether  with  14  cases carried forward from  the  previous\r\n\r\nyear,  were  dealt  with.   Of these  cases,  some  35%  were\r\n\r\nresolved amicably through conciliation.  14% of the claimants\r\n\r\nwithdrew their claims before conciliation meetings were  held\r\n\r\nas  they  had  either  resolved  their  disputes  with  their\r\n\r\nemployer  directly, or they had found a new job  and  decided\r\n\r\nnot to pursue their claims.  Some 12% of the claimants failed\r\n\r\nto  attend the conciliation meetings arranged by the Ministry\r\n\r\nand hence their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncases  were  closed.  The remaining 39% decided  to  withdraw\r\n\r\ntheir claims after conciliation for various reasons, such  as\r\n\r\ntheir  companies were in a state of insolvency, their  claims\r\n\r\nwere  weak or invalid, or the offers by their employers  were\r\n\r\nnot acceptable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in general, employers are reasonable in dealing with\r\n\r\ntheir  executives on employment issues and would  accept  the\r\n\r\nMinistry's  recommendations for an amicable  settlement.   In\r\n\r\nsituations where the executives' claims could not be resolved\r\n\r\namicably  through  conciliation, they  would  be  advised  to\r\n\r\npursue their claims further through legal action.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the conciliation service provided by the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Manpower,  the Tripartite  Committee  on  Union\r\n\r\nRepresentation  of  Executives  set  up  in  1999  has   also\r\n\r\nrecommended  that junior and middle level executives  without\r\n\r\nsubstantial  managerial responsibilities be allowed  to  join\r\n\r\nand  be  represented by rank-and-file unions on an individual\r\n\r\nbasis  for retrenchment, dismissal and other related  issues.\r\n\r\nThe  recommendation has been accepted by the  Government  and\r\n\r\nthe Industrial Relations Act will be amended accordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its study, the Tripartite Committee also examined\r\n\r\nwhether the scope of coverage of the Employment Act should be\r\n\r\nexpanded  to  cover  executives.  The  Committee  noted  that\r\n\r\nexecutives, by and large, are able to negotiate for their own\r\n\r\nterms  of employment and hence do not need the protection  of\r\n\r\nthe  law.   Their employment problems arose from retrenchment\r\n\r\nand dismissal.  Allowing executives limited representation by\r\n\r\nrank-and-file unions on issues of retrenchment and  dismissal\r\n\r\nwould provide executives with an additional avenue to address\r\n\r\ntheir employment problems without giving rise to conflict  of\r\n\r\ninterest   or  undermining  management  effectiveness.    The\r\n\r\nCommittee  therefore felt that the scope of coverage  of  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act  need not be expanded at this  juncture,  and\r\n\r\nthat my Ministry should monitor developments and carry out  a\r\n\r\nreview at a later stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there are mechanisms available for executives to\r\n\r\naddress   their   employment   problems,   including    their\r\n\r\nrepresentation  by the rank-and-file unions  on  retrenchment\r\n\r\nand  dismissal issues on an individual basis, their interests\r\n\r\nare already adequately served.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MONTHLY VARIABLE COMPONENT IN WAGE SYSTEM</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Progress of implementation)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad</b> asked the Minister for Manpower\r\n\r\nwhether he can provide an update on the progress of companies\r\n\r\nwhich have incorporated a monthly variable component in their\r\n\r\nwage  system  and  what  the  Government  intends  to  do  to\r\n\r\naccelerate the pace of implementation by more companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1999, the\r\n\r\nNational Wages Council recommended the adoption of a  monthly\r\n\r\nvariable component to further enhance the flexibility of  our\r\n\r\nwage structure.

A  recent  survey  by my Ministry  on  the  monthly\r\n\r\nvariable component implementation in the private sector shows\r\n\r\nthat  29%  of  the  unionised companies have implemented  the\r\n\r\nmonthly variable component as at end of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n2000.

Under   PSB's   Jumpstart\r\n\r\nProgramme,  we  help  SMEs  to take advantage  of  ready-made\r\n\r\nsolutions offered by the Application Service\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nProviders, and join one of the e-market-places.  So far,  PSB\r\n\r\nestimates  that about 19,000 SMEs have taken this first  step\r\n\r\ntowards e-commerce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, to help initiated SMEs conduct more of their\r\n\r\nbusiness   transactions  on  the  Net,   we   encourage   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of industry specific e-market-places under the e-Business   Industry  Development  Scheme   (e-BIDS)   jointly\r\n\r\npromoted  by  PSB  and  IDA.   These  vertical  portals   are\r\n\r\ncustomised  to meet the needs of the suppliers and  customers\r\n\r\nin  the respective sectors.  Recent examples of these special\r\n\r\npurpose  e-market places are Kafe 123 (an e-market place  for\r\n\r\nthe  coffee shop trade) and Asia Furniture Hub (a  portal  to\r\n\r\nenable  Singapore  based  furniture  businesses  to  transact\r\n\r\nglobally).   So  far,  close to 2,000 SMEs  have  taken  this\r\n\r\nsecond step.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third step to e-commerce is to help some of the SMEs\r\n\r\nto  re-invent their business with e-commerce.  One example is\r\n\r\nFar East Flora.  Even though the flower trade is very much  a\r\n\r\nbrick-and-mortar  business,  the  company  has  developed  an\r\n\r\nonline   flower  wholesale  business  and  is  beginning   to\r\n\r\ntransform  itself  into a click-and-mortar operation.   About\r\n\r\n<br><br>165&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMEs  have taken this third step.  We hope to  see  more\r\n\r\nSMEs gearing themselves up for the fast emerging New Economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to funding of the people sector to\r\n\r\nincrease  access  to  IT and Singapore  ONE.   I  can  assure\r\n\r\nMembers   that   there  is  adequate  funding   support   for\r\n\r\ninitiatives to bridge the digital divide.  IDA has  committed\r\n\r\nto  spend  up  to $25 million for e-lifestyle  programmes  by\r\n\r\n2003.   We  have  received another $5  million  in  corporate\r\n\r\nsponsorships  for  this purpose.  Many community  groups  and\r\n\r\nprivate organisations have also stepped forward to contribute\r\n\r\ntowards   the  movement  to  transform  Singapore   into   an\r\n\r\nInformation Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DEPOSITS BY EMPLOYERS FOR EMPLOYING FOREIGN MAIDS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Forfeiture)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nManpower whether he\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  review  the law on forfeiting of deposits by  employers\r\n\r\nwhen  their maids run away, as it is physically not  possible\r\n\r\nfor employers to prevent their maids from doing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe) (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\ncurrently,  all  employers of Non-Traditional Source  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers,  including  foreign  domestic  workers  (FDWs),  are\r\n\r\nrequired  to  post a $5,000 security bond with  my  Ministry.\r\n\r\nThe  security  bond  is to ensure that employers  upkeep  and\r\n\r\nmaintain  their foreign workers while they are working  here,\r\n\r\nand  repatriate  their  workers when their  services  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger needed.  The $5,000 security bond will be forfeited if\r\n\r\nthe  worker is not repatriated after the cancellation of  his\r\n\r\nor her work permit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand employers' concern that it is not always\r\n\r\npossible for them to stop their FDWs from absconding, as they\r\n\r\nare  not  in  a  position to monitor their  foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers'   activities  at  all  times.    Nevertheless,   the\r\n\r\nrepatriation of the FDW is one of the responsibilities  which\r\n\r\nthe  employer accepted in bringing her here to work.  Without\r\n\r\nthis  obligation,  we will run the risk  of  having  a  large\r\n\r\nnumber of NTS foreign workers, including the foreign domestic\r\n\r\nworkers,  abandoned  by  their employers  for  a  variety  of\r\n\r\nreasons.

So we give them a sufficient period of\r\n\r\ntime\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor them to do so.  Beyond that, if there are instances which\r\n\r\nwarrant  us  to  reconsider, we will  reconsider.   But  four\r\n\r\nmonths  is  a  fairly  reasonable  period.   As  I  mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier, ie, how we can help, we have advised employers. They\r\n\r\nshould try and get their employment agents, who probably know\r\n\r\nother  maids who know the maid who has run away, and  try  to\r\n\r\ncontact her or find out more particulars about the maid,  her\r\n\r\nfriends, and also work with the embassy because sometimes the\r\n\r\nmaids  report to the embassy when they are not fairly treated\r\n\r\nor  when they have complaints against their employers.  These\r\n\r\nare the types of assistance that we can give to employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I do not think the Minister of\r\n\r\nState  has  answered  my  question.

Employers  pay  foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic workers' levy to the Ministry.

Secondly,\r\n\r\nregarding the period of time, to the Ministry four months  is\r\n\r\nsufficient.   I understand that the purpose of  the  security\r\n\r\ndeposit  is  to  make  sure  that  the  employer  takes  full\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for repatriating the maid.

Sometimes, they can check with  the\r\n\r\nfriends of the maids who are in the neighbourhood, and may be\r\n\r\nable  to  contact  them.

Because if they have\r\n\r\nmanaged  the  maids  properly, and have  looked  after  their\r\n\r\nwelfare,  I  do not think their maids will run  away  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst place.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Minister of State has not\r\n\r\nanswered  my  question.

The levy is not just for the purpose of looking\r\n\r\nafter  maids  who are missing.  We, in fact, give  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nservices  to foreign domestic workers and the employers.

Every case of an FDW who falls from height\r\n\r\nwill  be  investigated  by  the Police.   Employers  who  are\r\n\r\ncriminally negligent can be prosecuted under the Penal  Code.\r\n\r\nThe  Work Permit Department (WPD) will also conduct  its  own\r\n\r\ninvestigations and the employer involved will not be  allowed\r\n\r\nto   recruit  another  foreign  domestic  worker  until   all\r\n\r\ninvestigations  are completed or, if the fall  leads  to  the\r\n\r\nFDW's   death,  until  the  Coroner's  report  is  concluded.\r\n\r\nEmployers who are suspected of exposing their FDWs to  safety\r\n\r\nhazards  will  be  asked to show cause  why  they  should  be\r\n\r\nallowed to employ foreign\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndomestic workers in the future.

It is not designed as a port to handle  general\r\n\r\ncargo,  including  second-hand goods. The steep  increase  in\r\n\r\nsecond-hand  goods trading activities at JFP in recent  years\r\n\r\nhas  also  resulted  in congestion at the  fishing  port  and\r\n\r\naffected   the  efficient  operation  of  the  fish   landing\r\n\r\nactivities  for which the port was built. For these  reasons,\r\n\r\nthe  Agri-food and Veterinary Authority (AVA), which operates\r\n\r\nthe  Jurong  Fishing Port (JFP), has decided to bar  vehicles\r\n\r\ncarrying  second-hand goods from entering  the  fishing  port\r\n\r\nwith effect from 1st May 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second-hand goods dealers can continue their business\r\n\r\nusing  the  nearby  Jurong Port or the Pasir  Panjang  Multi-purpose  Terminal,  which  are properly  equipped  to  handle\r\n\r\ngeneral cargo.

In January 1992, the then  PPD\r\n\r\nwrote  to the second-hand goods traders to say that  if  they\r\n\r\nwished  to  deliver their goods, they could do so,  and  they\r\n\r\nwere  given the procedures.  How did the Government  suddenly\r\n\r\nfind out that the Jurong Fishing Port is not the proper place\r\n\r\nfor carrying on this trade?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, in the early days when the\r\n\r\nfish  landing activities were not very active, the  then  PPD\r\n\r\ngave  special consideration for the second-hand goods dealers\r\n\r\nto use the port.  But since then, the fish trading activities\r\n\r\nhave  increased. In fact, it is not just for fishing vessels.\r\n\r\nWe  also have trucks from Malaysia and Thailand bringing fish\r\n\r\nto  the  port.   So  the  port is pretty  congested  now  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  by  allowing these second-hand  goods  dealers  to\r\n\r\ncontinue buying and selling second-hand goods there, it  does\r\n\r\ncontribute to unacceptable congestion and therefore affecting\r\n\r\nthe efficient operation of the port.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does the Ministry consider that\r\n\r\nsince the second-hand goods traders are allowed to trade, and\r\n\r\nthey  have  been  trading there since  the  early  days,  the\r\n\r\ndecision suddenly to bar them from entry, effectively, it  is\r\n\r\nto  say that they have to get out of the trade?  That is  the\r\n\r\nfirst question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is that I understand that the port\r\n\r\nstill allows vehicles to deliver goods like rice, etc, to the\r\n\r\nfishing boats.

The  Jurong  Port  and the Pasir Panjang  Multi-purpose\r\n\r\nTerminal  are  not  far away.  Yes, they  will  have  to  pay\r\n\r\nhigher charges, but it is not exorbitant.  But to stay behind\r\n\r\nwould cause difficulty to the fishing port, and therefore  it\r\n\r\nis  best that we regularise the activities and ask them to go\r\n\r\nto the port which is designed for such activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the question is that you\r\n\r\nsuddenly decided to bar these second-hand goods traders  from\r\n\r\nentry.

For instance, if they go to the  Jurong  Port,\r\n\r\nthey  probably have to pay a few hundred dollars a  month  in\r\n\r\nfees  to  enter.  So I do not think it is a case  where  they\r\n\r\nwould  not be able to survive if they are asked to go to  the\r\n\r\nproper  place.  As for the Indonesian vessels, they are  here\r\n\r\nto  land their fish.  And let me inform the Member that every\r\n\r\nvessel  that they land, it can fetch up to $14,000  of  fish,\r\n\r\nand this is a lot of money.

Personally, I do  not  think  the\r\n\r\nelectronic voting system is really that awe-inspiring.  Three\r\n\r\ndays ago I attended a briefing on electronic voting conducted\r\n\r\nby  the  Elections  Department, and I feel  that,  basically,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no great difference between electronic voting  and\r\n\r\nthe  traditional paper voting system.  With regard to secrecy\r\n\r\nof vote, reliability of software and hardware, as well as the\r\n\r\naccuracy of counting, so long as the civil servants in charge\r\n\r\ncan  abide  by  the  principles  of  the  Bill,  and  conduct\r\n\r\nthemselves fairly and honestly, the electronic voting  system\r\n\r\nis technically feasible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we cannot view this issue purely from the\r\n\r\ntechnical  point  of view.  No doubt, electronic  voting  has\r\n\r\nalready been used in a number of advanced countries, but  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  frequently reminds us that Singapore's conditions\r\n\r\nare  quite  different  from  the  other  countries.   So   in\r\n\r\nimplementing  electronic voting, we must not forget  that  we\r\n\r\nare indeed different from the other countries in a number  of\r\n\r\naspects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the voters do have doubts on their rights to\r\n\r\nvote.   Some voters are still harbouring the belief  that  if\r\n\r\nthey vote for the Opposition, they may have to face\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsome  dire  consequences.  That being  the  case,  electronic\r\n\r\nvoting will inevitably add on more psychological pressure  on\r\n\r\nthem.   If  the  Government genuinely respects  the  people's\r\n\r\nright  to vote, then it should work harder in convincing  the\r\n\r\npeople that secrecy of the votes can indeed be maintained  by\r\n\r\nthe  electronic  voting system and ensuring the  voters  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  the  right  to vote for the candidates  of  their\r\n\r\nchoice  -  whether  they are from the  ruling  party  or  the\r\n\r\nopposition  parties.  In  other words,  the  voters  must  be\r\n\r\nconvinced  that it is perfectly legitimate for them  to  vote\r\n\r\nfor  the  Opposition as their representatives in  Parliament.\r\n\r\nThis is their basic right.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, when they cast their sacred vote, there must\r\n\r\nbe  some means to indicate that their votes are recorded  and\r\n\r\naccepted  as  valid  votes that count  towards  the  ultimate\r\n\r\nresults of the poll.  In the traditional way of paper voting,\r\n\r\nwhen  a  voter goes into the polling booth, he  puts  a  mark\r\n\r\nagainst  the  name and party symbol of the candidate  of  his\r\n\r\nchoice,  and that gives him a sense of reality, an indication\r\n\r\nthat his sacred vote will be counted as one more vote for his\r\n\r\npreferred  candidate and be added to the final count  of  the\r\n\r\nvotes.   In  the case of electronic voting, the voter  merely\r\n\r\ntouches  the  screen and the voting process is done,  leaving\r\n\r\nthe  computer to do the recording, filing, and counting.  The\r\n\r\nvoter does not know, as a fact, whether his one vote has been\r\n\r\nproperly recorded and counted as one more vote cast  for  his\r\n\r\nchoice  candidate.  He may ask what would happen if there  is\r\n\r\nan  error in the process of recording, filing and counting by\r\n\r\nthe  electronic system. There are always doubts in the  minds\r\n\r\nof the voters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that during the initial stage of electronic\r\n\r\nvoting  to  be  experimented in some selected constituencies,\r\n\r\nthe computer system will print out an acknowledgement slip as\r\n\r\na  kind of safeguard, and in the case of a recount it can  be\r\n\r\nused  as  a  basis for recounting.  The voters  can  see  for\r\n\r\nthemselves that their votes have been acknowledged, and  they\r\n\r\nwill  have greater confidence in electronic voting.   I  feel\r\n\r\nthat this procedure of acknowledgement\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould  be  included in the Amendment Bill so  that  it  will\r\n\r\nbecome a permanent feature of the electronic voting system in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on the display appearing on three screens, I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  it is very confusing, particularly for those  who\r\n\r\nare  not  used to new technology and the senior citizens  who\r\n\r\nmay be illiterate. The Government should consider simplifying\r\n\r\nthe system with display on only two screens instead of three.\r\n\r\nIn addition, symbols rather than words should be used.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the electronic voting system only allows\r\n\r\nvoters  to vote for any of the candidates.  The voters cannot\r\n\r\nexpress their discontent by casting a \"spoilt\" vote.   If the\r\n\r\nGovernment  recognises that the casting of  spoilt  votes  is\r\n\r\nalso a way of voting for the voters to show their disapproval\r\n\r\nof  all the available candidates, then it should be explained\r\n\r\nclearly how spoilt votes can be cast and considered under the\r\n\r\nelectronic voting system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the one-man-one-vote system, which\r\n\r\nreturns our Government and representatives to Parliament,  is\r\n\r\nvery  important for the Government and the country.  It  will\r\n\r\nshow  the legitimacy of the Government. If we want the people\r\n\r\nto be convinced that the Member of Parliament returned at the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Election for that constituency is the one  whom  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the  voters have actually voted  for  as  their\r\n\r\nrepresentative in Parliament, we must ensure that voters have\r\n\r\nthe  confidence of the election system when they  cast  their\r\n\r\nvotes.   Otherwise,  the people may think the  Government  is\r\n\r\nplaying foul.  This kind of mentality is not conducive to our\r\n\r\nnational  cohesiveness,  nor does  it  do  any  good  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  or  the people.  To alleviate and eliminate  this\r\n\r\nkind  of  negative mentality, the Government should  convince\r\n\r\nthe  people  that  they  have  the  right  to  vote  for  the\r\n\r\nOpposition. Civil servants should also be fair and  impartial\r\n\r\nin the execution of their duties.  They should not favour the\r\n\r\nruling party.  All citizens must know that voting is a  basic\r\n\r\nright of the people.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople  can  exercise  their  choice  without  any  fear   of\r\n\r\nrepercussion.  All Singapore citizens should value the  right\r\n\r\nand opportunity that under the one-man-one-vote system, every\r\n\r\nvoter has equal power to vote for the candidate of his choice\r\n\r\nas his representative in Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the introduction of\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill  comprises  two\r\n\r\nimportant features:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) This Bill acknowledges that Singaporeans have\r\n\r\nresponded  to the Government policy to form an external  wing\r\n\r\nto our economy and that while they are not in Singapore, they\r\n\r\nshould not be disenfranchised.  Voting is a fundamental right\r\n\r\nand  privilege of an adult citizen.  This Bill, in making  it\r\n\r\npossible for citizens abroad to exercise their right to vote,\r\n\r\nshows  the  maturity  of our political  system  to  give  due\r\n\r\nconsideration to the minority groups within our  society.   I\r\n\r\nremember  when I first voted in an election - it was  not  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  it  was  in the United Kingdom  -  the  right  of\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  citizens to vote while in  the  United  Kingdom\r\n\r\ninitially surprised me, but it really felt good to be part of\r\n\r\nthe democratic process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In a world that is IT-based, there is a necessity\r\n\r\nto  make provisions to allow electronic or DRE voting.  I  am\r\n\r\nglad this Bill makes it possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while I support the Bill, I have a few\r\n\r\ncomments to make and wish to seek some clarifications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Bill allows a recount to be carried out if\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  difference of 2% or less.  In  the  past  three\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections, there were only two cases  below  2%.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that we are setting the allowance for recounting  at\r\n\r\ntoo  low  a level.  If we adopt a 5% difference, there  would\r\n\r\nhave  been recounting in five constituencies in the 1991  and\r\n\r\ntwo  in  the 1997 general elections.  Surely, in the interest\r\n\r\nof accuracy, a recounting based on 5% is not too much to ask.\r\n\r\nAfter  all,  recounting under this Bill is  not  a  mandatory\r\n\r\nrequirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) There is a requirement to test the DRE voting\r\n\r\nequipment  before  polling  and during  polling.  Surely  the\r\n\r\nequipment should also be tested at the end of the polling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) What are the provisions in the system to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  progressive voting patterns cannot be  revealed  during\r\n\r\nthe period of polling?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Overseas electors on registration will be allocated an\r\n\r\noverseas  polling  station, but it  is  not  clear  to  which\r\n\r\nelectoral division will his or her vote be assigned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) While there are requirements for inspections of\r\n\r\nmachines for tampering, malfunction and damage, what are  the\r\n\r\nsafeguards  in  the procedures to ensure that  the  inspector\r\n\r\ndoes not tamper with the equipment?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) While overseas centres may be set up, we presume,\r\n\r\nand  I think it was said yesterday, in areas and cities where\r\n\r\nthere  are  large numbers of Singaporeans, those living  some\r\n\r\ndistance  away from this major city may find it difficult  to\r\n\r\njourney  down  to vote.  Will the Government consider  postal\r\n\r\nvoting in the interim before a final electronic system is put\r\n\r\nin place?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) If a citizen, after spending some time overseas, returns\r\n\r\nto  Singapore before the General Election, will he be subject\r\n\r\nto the two out of five years' rule on his voting eligibility?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, some Members of Parliament had already\r\n\r\nhighlighted  yesterday  that the  Bill  is  treating  private\r\n\r\nsector   citizens   overseas  differently   from   Government\r\n\r\nemployees overseas.  I find this differentiation disturbing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  yesterday, Mr Jeyaretnam made a statement which I  will\r\n\r\nquote  him  today.  He said, \"I had not thought  of  speaking\r\n\r\nuntil  I  heard the Minister speak\", and he was referring  to\r\n\r\nour  discussions  on  the  Singapore  Broadcasting  Authority\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill.   I will quote him.  I actually  have  not\r\n\r\nplanned to speak, Sir, until I heard him.  But more so,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nuntil  I  read  in  the  press this morning  how  nonsensical\r\n\r\nstatements had been given sense in the press today.  That  is\r\n\r\na  writing  skill  which I must applaud  the  Straits  Times'\r\n\r\njournalist.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I speak? Because I thought that there is some\r\n\r\nmessage  which, if not checked, would have spread  and  would\r\n\r\nhave  done  harm  to our image as a country.   Do  we  really\r\n\r\nbelieve that we would go our way to fiddle or to play  around\r\n\r\nwith  the election results?  I do not think so.  I am not  so\r\n\r\nconcerned   about   Singaporeans  but  I   do   not   believe\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will  be  so  easily  persuaded.   I  am   more\r\n\r\nconcerned  with the international readers, the  tourists  who\r\n\r\ncome  to Singapore, pick up a copy of the Straits Times, read\r\n\r\nand  go  back  and  say, \"Hey, in Singapore,  they  do  silly\r\n\r\nthings.\"  I think that is not right.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me use one anecdote which I hope will be able to\r\n\r\nmake  my point.  In 1979, I stood in a by-election.   When  I\r\n\r\nwas  presented  as a candidate, at a press conference  I  was\r\n\r\nthere  with four or five, maybe six, others of my colleagues,\r\n\r\nand  then the press asked me, \"What have you got to say as  a\r\n\r\ncandidate?\"  I said, \"I have nothing to say.\"  And  then  the\r\n\r\nnext  day, the press came out and said, \"Nothing to say, what\r\n\r\nan MP!  What can he do for his constituents?\"  So a couple of\r\n\r\nmy  colleagues  got  a bit concerned that  I  might  lose  my\r\n\r\nelections.   Anyhow,  I pushed on.  I  had  a  couple  of  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues come to help me.  We fought.  What was the result?\r\n\r\nI won decisively.  Not only were my colleagues surprised, but\r\n\r\nthe candidate who fought me from the United Front (I think he\r\n\r\nwas the Secretary General) was also surprised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the interesting thing was I had a summons to go to\r\n\r\nIstana.  I use the word \"summons\" in a pleasant sense - it is\r\n\r\nnot the punishment that we all expect, but a nice little meal\r\n\r\nwith  the Prime Minister.  Of course, today, he is the Senior\r\n\r\nMinister, and he asked me, \"You won decisively.  You won with\r\n\r\ngood results.  What did you\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndo?   Did  you  give them vain promises?\"  I  said,  \"No.   I\r\n\r\ndidn't do such things.\"  As you know, SM does not speak  very\r\n\r\nmuch.   But  at certain times, you could see, you could  feel\r\n\r\nthis silent nod of approval for my results.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If SM is so careful with his young little candidate\r\n\r\ngoing  out  there  winning results and  winning  properly,  I\r\n\r\ncannot  imagine he would endorse anyone of us, let alone  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs, trying to fiddle with the  results\r\n\r\nof  the elections.  So when I read the press this morning,  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Ah,  this looks as though there is this very  strange\r\n\r\nmessage  going through that the Opposition feels there  is  a\r\n\r\npossibility  of  us fixing the election results  through  the\r\n\r\ncomputers.\"  Then I thought I better say something, if not, I\r\n\r\nwould not be doing my country a favour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have kept this for over 20 years. Nobody knew about\r\n\r\nit,  except SM and myself, not even my wife.  So when I  told\r\n\r\nher  this  morning,  she  said,  \"Oh,  you  really  had  that\r\n\r\nexperience.\"   Yes, I did.  So before it fades away  from  my\r\n\r\nmemory, I thought I would quote this little incident  to  try\r\n\r\nto  do  justice to a truth, and not allow constant repetition\r\n\r\nof untruths become the truths.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my colleagues told me this morning that Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam probably could have come from St. Andrew's School.\r\n\r\nI  expressed a bit of shock because, in St. Andrew's School - I  came from St. Andrew's School, Sir, and I was one of those\r\n\r\nwho  was a very keen sportsman, I was Captain of Rugby  15  - one  of the lessons we learnt is sportsmanship.  When we win,\r\n\r\nwe  win  happily.  When we lose, we lose sportingly.   And  I\r\n\r\nwould  say  to  Mr  Jeyaretnam  and  my  colleagues  in   the\r\n\r\nOpposition,  let  us fight healthily, let us  play  the  game\r\n\r\nproperly, let us win, and win properly.  If we lose, we  lose\r\n\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One incident I had was with Sarawak Rangers. When they\r\n\r\nplayed  the game with me, I had the ball with me.  They  came\r\n\r\nfor  me  and  they punched me under the belt.   My  principal\r\n\r\nsaid, \"Play on.  Don't scold, don't shout.  Push on.\"  And  I\r\n\r\nsuggest that we all do the same.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I rise to speak in support of the Bill.  I applaud  the\r\n\r\nGovernment for its willingness to recognise how globalisation\r\n\r\naffects the democratic process as Singapore citizens continue\r\n\r\nto  become  global citizens.  The Government should  also  be\r\n\r\ncommended  for  its  willingness to  leverage  on  technology\r\n\r\nthrough  the introduction of electronic voting.  The proposed\r\n\r\namendment to minimise the need for unnecessary recounting  is\r\n\r\nalso a step forward in the right direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having proposed all these changes, Sir, I feel that the\r\n\r\nGovernment should go one step further.  In the same  vein  as\r\n\r\nthe  previous  speakers, I would like to urge the  Government\r\n\r\nnot  to deny any Singapore citizens, regardless of where they\r\n\r\nare  residing  in and for whatever the period  of  time,  the\r\n\r\nfundamental right to vote, so long as they remain citizens of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I would also like to appeal to the Government  to\r\n\r\ngo slow in its introduction of electronic voting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in earlier elections, overseas voting may be\r\n\r\ninconceivable due to the logistics and timing involved.   But\r\n\r\nadvancements in communication, technology and IT have blurred\r\n\r\ngeographic  boundaries and shrunk the world.  Meanwhile,  our\r\n\r\nglobal  participation had led some Singaporeans  to  take  up\r\n\r\nresidence  abroad.   In this regard, the Government  must  be\r\n\r\ngiven  credit for its willingness to keep up with the  times.\r\n\r\nHence,  I  am  very pleased that the Government  has  allowed\r\n\r\noverseas voting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, voting is a fundamental right for citizenship. All\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens should have the right to vote  regardless\r\n\r\nof  whether  they are ordinarily resident in Singapore.   The\r\n\r\ntwo  years  out  of  the  five years rule  is  an  artificial\r\n\r\ncriterion.   The  basis  for it is  seemingly  to  sieve  out\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  are  more genuine  Singapore  citizens  by\r\n\r\nvirtue  of  their tenure as residents in the period preceding\r\n\r\nthe  election.  But the proof of longer residency  is  not  a\r\n\r\nfoolproof  argument  that  such  Singapore  citizens  have  a\r\n\r\ngreater stake in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  well-being of Singapore and that they would  cast  their\r\n\r\nvotes with the best interest of the nation at heart and  with\r\n\r\nopen eyes on the impact of their votes.  If this is the case,\r\n\r\ndoes  it  mean that the poverty stricken and the bankrupt  in\r\n\r\nthe  country  should not be given the right to  vote  because\r\n\r\nthere  is  very  little, if at all, any  stake  left  in  it?\r\n\r\nCertainly  not.  Because the right to vote is the fundamental\r\n\r\nright of every Singapore citizen.  Conversely, a short period\r\n\r\nof  residency is not a foolproof argument to assume that such\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens no longer have the interest of the  nation\r\n\r\nat  heart,  that they are no longer patriotic and,  as  such,\r\n\r\ntheir right to vote ought to be forfeited.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans work and live abroad for a varied host of\r\n\r\nreasons which could be the subject of a separate debate.  Due\r\n\r\nto  the  education  and  the environment,  Singaporeans  have\r\n\r\nbecome  global  citizens and it is a credit to the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  that our Singaporeans have become so  mobile  and\r\n\r\nacceptable elsewhere.  But this should not be the  reason  to\r\n\r\ndisenfranchise  them as, in their own way, they  have  become\r\n\r\nambassadors   for  our  island  state  and,  sometimes,   our\r\n\r\nstrongest  supporters in the face of foreign sceptics.   This\r\n\r\nwould not be fair to those who have been working abroad for a\r\n\r\nlong  time and are still sending their money back home.  This\r\n\r\nwould  not be fair to those who are married out of Singapore,\r\n\r\nbut  still  maintain close contacts with  their  families  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and make regular visits back home.  This  is  also\r\n\r\nnot  fair judgement on those who still follow the local  news\r\n\r\nvia our local newspapers' websites or avidly watch Singapore-produced programmes broadcast in the new country of residence\r\n\r\nwhich may be temporary in nature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the right to vote should simply be a fundamental\r\n\r\nright  of  being a Singapore citizen.  As long  as  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  do  not  denounce  their citizenship,  they  should\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  maintain  their stake  in  Singapore  Inc.   In\r\n\r\neffect, they should continue to be a shareholder of Singapore\r\n\r\nInc.  with the right to vote irrespective of where  they  are\r\n\r\nand  how  long they have been there.  If I am a  top  doctor,\r\n\r\nscientist, or academic, who has taken up overseas\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nresidence for many years but I am still a Singapore  citizen,\r\n\r\nI  would  probably  go to the Embassy  to  cast  my  vote  on\r\n\r\nelection  day,  if  I still have the right  to  vote  for  my\r\n\r\ncountry.   I  also  value  the Singapore  Government's  tacit\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of  my  contribution as a Singaporean  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I may even consider an appropriate time to return\r\n\r\nto  Singapore  and  make  my  contribution  in  my  field  of\r\n\r\nexpertise  for  the  best  interest of  Singaporeans  as  the\r\n\r\nlinkage has not been severed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every time local dishes, such as Hainanese chicken\r\n\r\nrice,  char  kuay  teow,  mee  rebus,  and  mee  goreng,  are\r\n\r\nmentioned,  the knees of Singaporeans who take  up  residence\r\n\r\nabroad  will grow feeble.   Even if they have been  away  for\r\n\r\nfive or 10 years, they still crave for their authentic Katong\r\n\r\nlaksa,  the Malay satay and Jalan Kayu roti prata.  Time  has\r\n\r\nno effect in diminishing their taste of what is good and what\r\n\r\nis  Singaporean.  Similarly, time should have  no  effect  in\r\n\r\ndiminishing  the worth of overseas Singaporeans to  vote  and\r\n\r\nthe  worth  of their votes.  We should not presume that  they\r\n\r\nwould not have the interest of Singapore at heart.  We should\r\n\r\nnot  presume that, in future, they do not intend to  take  up\r\n\r\ntheir  stake in Singapore and take up residence in  Singapore\r\n\r\nagain.  In fairness, our Government has done an excellent job\r\n\r\nin getting some of our top brains back home again.  For this,\r\n\r\nI  salute the Government for what it has achieved.  But I  am\r\n\r\nasking the Government to go one step further by allowing  all\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens the right to vote regardless of the length\r\n\r\nof  residency  in  Singapore in  the  run-up  period  to  the\r\n\r\nelection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now urge the Government to go slow in its\r\n\r\nintroduction of electronic voting.  I wish to state,  at  the\r\n\r\nonset,  that  I  am  not  averse to changes  or  the  use  of\r\n\r\ntechnology to keep up with the time.  But my concern is  that\r\n\r\nsome  Singaporeans, especially the older generation, may  not\r\n\r\nbe  adequately  exposed to the IT revolution.   Some  of  our\r\n\r\nolder  Singaporeans  still  stash  their  money  under  their\r\n\r\nmattresses,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrather  than put it into  the bank.  They may harbour  doubts\r\n\r\nas  to  whether the use of electronic voting is  a  foolproof\r\n\r\nsystem,  the results of which cannot be tampered  with.   The\r\n\r\nelectronic  voting  system may be user-friendly.   But  there\r\n\r\nwill still be some who do not trust it completely.  This  may\r\n\r\nbe due to newspapers' reports of glitches in using electronic\r\n\r\nsystem,  for example, the ATM banking machines.  Despite  all\r\n\r\nthe  safeguards that banks have put into  place,  there  will\r\n\r\nstill be the odd  situation of system malfunction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the election, how can we ensure that the\r\n\r\nelectronic  voting system will not fail?  Should we  not  put\r\n\r\nthe electronic system on trial and ensure that the safeguards\r\n\r\nare adequate before implementing it on a broader basis at the\r\n\r\nnext  general election?  In past elections, the manual voting\r\n\r\nand  counting  system gave Singaporean voters a semblance  of\r\n\r\nassurance in the system.  It is not a foolproof system as  it\r\n\r\ncan  still be subject to human error and hence the  need  for\r\n\r\nrecounting.   But  it  is  a  system  with  human  faces,  an\r\n\r\nintervention   that  the  older  generation  of   voters   is\r\n\r\naccustomed   to.    For  them,  manual   counting   is   more\r\n\r\ntransparent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's population is a red dot compared to the\r\n\r\nUnited  States  and  the time that we take  for  counting  is\r\n\r\nwithin  acceptable, accustomed time limits.  It is  something\r\n\r\nthat  we  can  still  tolerate at the next general  election.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we can try out the electronic voting system  on  a\r\n\r\ntrial  basis in a few constituencies, with a parallel  manual\r\n\r\nrun  to  give  voters the confidence that  electronic  voting\r\n\r\nreally works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the Bill aims to\r\n\r\nintroduce serious changes to our election laws.  For a start,\r\n\r\nit  will  introduce overseas voting by Singaporeans  who  are\r\n\r\nworking  or  studying overseas.  It is certainly welcomed  by\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporeans and is in line with Singapore 21  to  make\r\n\r\nevery Singaporean count.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, I would like to reiterate that in\r\n\r\nSingapore, many Singaporeans trust the voting system that  we\r\n\r\nhave  in  Singapore.   Yesterday, as  I  sat  in  this  House\r\n\r\nlistening to the speech made by the hon. NCMP, Mr Jeyaretnam,\r\n\r\nI  was indeed not only embarrassed by the statements that  he\r\n\r\nmade  -  and I, in fact, endorse the statement of the  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker earlier that he made nonsensical statements - because\r\n\r\nfor  a start he cited the examples of the 1980 election,  the\r\n\r\n1993  presidential election, and the 1997 Cheng  San  general\r\n\r\nelection  results  to  highlight that the  results  were  not\r\n\r\nfavourable  to  him and, as such, he has lost  faith  in  the\r\n\r\nelection  system  and  in the voting process.   But  what  he\r\n\r\nfailed  to  highlight - and I think perhaps due to  selective\r\n\r\namnesia  - was that in 1981, he was elected as the Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament  for Anson and he did not explain how he  won  and\r\n\r\nwhether  he  won  at  the behest of the Government.   And  he\r\n\r\nfurther did injustice to the other two Opposition Members  in\r\n\r\nthis House, namely the Member for Potong Pasir and the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hougang,  because by hinting that the  process  was  not\r\n\r\nsomething proper, he again hints that the election  of  these\r\n\r\ntwo  Opposition Members to Parliament itself was not a proper\r\n\r\nprocess.   This  again does injustice both to  the  two  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  of the Opposition and to Singaporeans at  large  who\r\n\r\nvoted for them and for the other MPs of this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let me say, Sir, that many Singaporeans were indeed\r\n\r\nsurprised.   Some  of the friends that I  met  today  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  my  work were also surprised by the statement  he\r\n\r\nmade  because  many Singaporeans, when they  go  to  vote  to\r\n\r\nexercise  their  selection of the Member  of  Parliament  for\r\n\r\ntheir constituency, do it with confidence and do it with free\r\n\r\nchoice.   As  such, Sir, I would like to reiterate  that  not\r\n\r\nonly  myself  but many Singaporeans have great trust  in  the\r\n\r\nintegrity of the election process in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the specific clauses, and\r\n\r\nhighlight matters which are of concern.  First of all, on the\r\n\r\noverseas voting (clauses 3 and 9).  Sir, the amendment  seeks\r\n\r\nto impose a requirement of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nresidence in Singapore of two years out of the preceding five\r\n\r\nyears.   I  would like to ask the Minister the rationale  for\r\n\r\nthe  imposition  of this 2-year residential requirement.   If\r\n\r\nthe  object  is  to  enable  all  Singaporeans  overseas   to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  the  elections and to determine  the  future\r\n\r\ngovernment of this country, I find the requirement  a  little\r\n\r\nonerous.  Some could be employed overseas, and the only  time\r\n\r\nthey come back to Singapore would be during their short leave\r\n\r\nperiod.   I  would request the Minister to consider  lowering\r\n\r\nthe  residency  requirement to about  two  months,  with  the\r\n\r\nprovision  that the period not be one that runs consecutively\r\n\r\nbut the aggregate number of the total number of days spent in\r\n\r\nSingapore during the 5-year period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister as to why the\r\n\r\nexemption  provisions  do not provide for  students  who  are\r\n\r\nstudying overseas, either on a private company scholarship or\r\n\r\nat their own cost.  Sir, I notice that scholars on Government\r\n\r\nor  statutory  board  bonds  are  excluded  from  the  2-year\r\n\r\nresidency   requirement.   As  a  good  number  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nstudents are studying overseas due to their inability to  get\r\n\r\ninto  the  local universities, it will be a pity if they  are\r\n\r\nexcluded  from  being eligible to vote due  to  the  proposed\r\n\r\nprovision.  This is particularly so if they are pursuing post-graduate education.  Sir, it is essential that we get as many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  as possible to participate in the  election  of\r\n\r\nthe  future government, as it will certainly create a greater\r\n\r\nsense  of  participation in determining  the  future  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, secondly, let me move on to electronic voting or\r\n\r\nnew  section 50A.  Sir, I commend the Minister for taking the\r\n\r\nbold  initiative to introduce electronic voting in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  is the way to go for the future.  It will certainly speed\r\n\r\nup the counting of votes and the announcement of the election\r\n\r\nresults  in  future.  We have seen the speed and accuracy  of\r\n\r\nelectronic voting in this House when votes are taken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new section 33A proposes that the DRE voting\r\n\r\nsystem cannot be used\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunless  the  voting system is approved by the Auditor-General\r\n\r\nor any other person appointed by the Minister in consultation\r\n\r\nwith  the  Auditor-General.  I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nto  explain who this other person will be.  I would urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  if  possible,  to define this  other  person,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  a  High  Court judge or any other person,  whom  he\r\n\r\nwants  to  appoint precisely in this Bill so  that  everybody\r\n\r\nknows that this person who is going to audit this system is a\r\n\r\nperson who is impartial and above board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to suggest that in view of the high\r\n\r\nrespect and independence enjoyed by the office of the Auditor-General,  whether  the Minister could consider  changing  the\r\n\r\nconsultation  process into a concurrence or  consent  of  the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to note that the Minister, in introducing\r\n\r\nthe  Bill, referred to the touch-screen method to be used for\r\n\r\nthe DRE system of voting.  From my experience in dealing with\r\n\r\nsenior  citizens, I think the best way to get senior citizens\r\n\r\nto  use  IT services is through the provision of touch-screen\r\n\r\nsolutions which are very easy to use.  Sir, this is something\r\n\r\nthat  many  elderly citizens will find easy to use  and  will\r\n\r\ncertainly catch on very fast.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask the Minister as to whether\r\n\r\nelectronic voting will give voters the same choices  as  they\r\n\r\nhave now, which is (1) to vote for any one of the candidates,\r\n\r\nor  (2)  to spoil the vote or abstain from voting.   Perhaps,\r\n\r\nsome  clarification of the actual process  involved  will  go\r\n\r\ntowards  removing some nagging suspicion on the part of  some\r\n\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move finally to the question of recounting\r\n\r\nof  votes.  New section 49B seeks to introduce some  finality\r\n\r\nto  the recounting of votes.  It imposes the requirement that\r\n\r\nthe  recounting  of  votes  can  only  be  allowed  when  the\r\n\r\ndifference in votes exceeds 2% between the winning and losing\r\n\r\ncandidates.   Even  then, only one recount will  be  allowed.\r\n\r\nSir, I believe that this margin is reasonable, and a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsound  margin for any possible error in counting.  This  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  put  some  finality  to  frivolous  requests   for\r\n\r\nrecounting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nI thank the Members for speaking on this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me clarify that election matters are\r\n\r\nnot  under the Ministry of Home Affairs.  The fact that I  am\r\n\r\ndoing  it is because the Prime Minister has asked me to  lead\r\n\r\nthe  study  group  to  go overseas and  find  out  how  other\r\n\r\ncountries  do  electronic voting.  I have  been  helping  the\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister   also  in  other  matters  concerning   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Elections Act, and that is why I am tasked with\r\n\r\nthis  responsibility  to bring up this  Bill  in  Parliament.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no  secret about this.  I do not know whether  the\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister  will  decide  to  transfer  his   Elections\r\n\r\nDepartment  to  the  Ministry of Home  Affairs.   That  is  a\r\n\r\ndecision for him to take.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have talked about the criteria other\r\n\r\nthan  citizenship  to  be eligible for overseas  voting,  and\r\n\r\nasked  why  not  we include employees of local  companies  or\r\n\r\nmultinational  companies with offices here.  Some  have  also\r\n\r\nmade  the point that voting is a right, not just a privilege,\r\n\r\nand Mr Simon Tay has mentioned Article 12 of the Constitution\r\n\r\nwhich  ensures equality for all citizens.  In  fact,  I  have\r\n\r\ncovered  some  of  these  points in my  speech,  but  let  me\r\n\r\nreiterate them here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 5-year period for the qualifying criterion was\r\n\r\nchosen as it corresponds with a parliamentary election  term,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  five  years.  For an overseas  Singaporean  to  be\r\n\r\ndeemed  to be \"ordinarily resident\", in our view, is that  he\r\n\r\nmust  have an aggregate of two years' residence out of  five.\r\n\r\nThis  is reasonable.  In New Zealand and Canada, a voter must\r\n\r\nnot  be  out  of the country for three years and  five  years\r\n\r\nrespectively  before  he  is eligible  to  vote.   Setting  a\r\n\r\nqualifying  criterion based on residence is not an  invention\r\n\r\nby us.  Others have also done it.  In fact, by expanding\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis  definition of \"ordinarily resident\", we  have  made  it\r\n\r\npossible for certain groups of residents, ie, those who  have\r\n\r\nlived in Singapore two years out of five years, to be able to\r\n\r\nvote  overseas.   Otherwise,  by  the  strict  definition  of\r\n\r\n\"ordinarily  resident\", if Singaporeans have  actually  moved\r\n\r\naway  from Singapore, they have gone overseas to work,  study\r\n\r\nor  whatever,  then  they  are not \"ordinarily  resident\"  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and, therefore, they are not eligible to vote under\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary Elections Act, unless they come back.  And\r\n\r\nprovided,  of  course, if their names  still  remain  in  the\r\n\r\nelectoral register, then they can vote.  So we have  actually\r\n\r\nexpanded  this  definition and made  it  possible  for  these\r\n\r\ncitizens  who  have lived in Singapore for two years  out  of\r\n\r\nfive  years  to  be able to vote overseas.  I  hope  that  is\r\n\r\nsimple enough for people to understand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are suggestions on including other criteria, such\r\n\r\nas  whether they have some assets in Singapore, whether  they\r\n\r\nhave  properties  in  Singapore, whether they  have  economic\r\n\r\ninterests in Singapore or their loyalties to Singapore, their\r\n\r\nties to Singapore, their stakes in Singapore, and so on.   We\r\n\r\ncan  choose a lot of criteria, but we must find one  that  is\r\n\r\neasy to understand, easy to implement and is convenient.   It\r\n\r\nis  difficult  for  us  to define what is  \"stake\",  what  is\r\n\r\n\"emotional  ties\" and so on.  All these are  matters  of  the\r\n\r\nheart, not matters that one can measure.  But when we come to\r\n\r\nresidence,  we can all measure residence - how long  has  one\r\n\r\nlived  here  during this period when one wants to qualify  to\r\n\r\nvote.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not doubting the loyalties or emotional links of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to Singapore just because they  live  overseas.\r\n\r\nWe  believe  that many of them will come back  to  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthey  feel  strongly attached to Singapore, they will  defend\r\n\r\nSingapore's interests whenever Singapore is criticised.   But\r\n\r\nif  we  were  to  find any other criteria  to  determine  the\r\n\r\neligibility  to  vote,  we  will  end  up  with  a   lot   of\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in  implementation.  So since  other  countries\r\n\r\nhave  also adopted a similar, simple, residential requirement\r\n\r\nas  a criterion to vote overseas, I think that is a safe  and\r\n\r\nsimple way to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically on Mr Simon Tay's point on Article 12\r\n\r\nversus  the choice of overseas station, the Bill itself  does\r\n\r\nnot designate the particular overseas polling stations.  That\r\n\r\nis  left  to  the administrative discretion of the  Returning\r\n\r\nOfficer.   Article 12 of the Constitution is  not  really  an\r\n\r\nissue.   Article  12 is infringed only if  a  person  who  is\r\n\r\nsimilarly  situated in that place is treated differently  for\r\n\r\nno  rational basis.  We have a rational basis for designating\r\n\r\ncertain  missions  in  one country  as  an  overseas  polling\r\n\r\nstation  and not another, ie, we have to regard the  size  of\r\n\r\nthe  voting population and the adequacy of the mission  staff\r\n\r\nto  conduct  the  poll  and  the security  of  the  mission's\r\n\r\npremises.   These  are  rational  bases  for  deciding  which\r\n\r\noverseas  missions  will  be polling  stations.   These  same\r\n\r\ncriteria  are also used in Singapore when we decide on  where\r\n\r\nto put a polling station.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be emphasised that no registered overseas voter\r\n\r\nresident in a country that does not have an overseas  polling\r\n\r\nstation  is  in  any  way disadvantaged or  deprived  of  his\r\n\r\nentitlement  to  vote.  He can be allocated  to  the  nearest\r\n\r\noverseas polling station or, if he is already in the register\r\n\r\nof  electors, he can always vote in Singapore when he  is  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   If  he  stays in a country that  is  nearby  the\r\n\r\nmission  where we have an overseas polling station, there  is\r\n\r\nnothing  stopping him from registering himself as an overseas\r\n\r\nvoter and vote in that particular mission.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an example. If a Singaporean who is\r\n\r\neligible  to  vote  stays in Paris, the nearest  mission  for\r\n\r\nvoting is London.  He can actually register and then vote  in\r\n\r\nLondon.   We  have not decided to open a polling  station  in\r\n\r\nParis, not at this time, but when there is a reason to do so,\r\n\r\nwe  will  do  so.   But, for now, we have grouped  all  those\r\n\r\nliving in Europe so that they can vote in London.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not every overseas citizen can be qualified to vote, so\r\n\r\nlong  as  parliamentary elections continue to  be  run  on  a\r\n\r\nconstituency  representation  basis.   And  there  remains  a\r\n\r\nthreat of plural voting.  The Parliamentary\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nElections Act already differentiates between resident and non-resident citizens, as I explained earlier.  Only citizens who\r\n\r\nare  resident here are qualified to be registered  as  voters\r\n\r\nand  to vote.  The residency requirement is necessary so that\r\n\r\nwe  can  allocate  him a particular constituency.   One  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  has  asked,  for an overseas voter,  where  will  his\r\n\r\nconstituency  be.   His constituency must  be  the  Singapore\r\n\r\naddress  for  which he has registered himself as a  resident.\r\n\r\nIt  cannot  be an address in London because we  do  not  have\r\n\r\nconstituencies  in  London.  It is a simple  matter  which  I\r\n\r\nexplained yesterday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment therefore would not remove this\r\n\r\ndistinction  that he must have a Singapore address.  What  it\r\n\r\ndoes is to extend the requirement of residency to include the\r\n\r\ngroups  of  citizens  who are away from  Singapore  for  non-permanent  reasons,  and hence have  sufficient  ties  to  be\r\n\r\nallocated  to  vote in respect of a particular  constituency.\r\n\r\nThey are on overseas assignments or training at the behest of\r\n\r\nthe Government, that is, the Government sent them there, they\r\n\r\nare  made non-resident by reason of the Government's decision\r\n\r\nor  action.  The Government asked them to go.  As for  others\r\n\r\nworking  in  international agencies, for example, the  United\r\n\r\nNations, it is not just any international agency, it must  be\r\n\r\nan  international agency of which Singapore is a member.   If\r\n\r\nhe  says  that he works in a particular international agency,\r\n\r\nbut  Singapore  is  not  a member, then  that  person  cannot\r\n\r\nregister himself as an overseas voter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some MPs have also asked about the distinction between\r\n\r\nthose  sent  by the Government to study or work overseas  and\r\n\r\nother  overseas Singaporeans.  I have just said that for  the\r\n\r\nofficials,  they  are sent overseas by the  Government,  they\r\n\r\nperform an official duty.  For the students, they are sent by\r\n\r\nthe  Government and they are bonded to serve the  Government.\r\n\r\nTherein lies the distinction between them and those who go on\r\n\r\ntheir  own  or work for other companies.  They  go  there  on\r\n\r\ntheir own choice, are sent by their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompanies,  or they go there on their own choice  with  their\r\n\r\nparents'  money to study whereas, for those who are  sent  by\r\n\r\nthe   Government,  we  have  asked  them  to  do  so.    This\r\n\r\ndistinction  is  made  also in the  election  laws  of  other\r\n\r\ncountries  when  they provide for overseas  voting.   I  have\r\n\r\ncited  a  few  examples - such as Canada and New Zealand  are\r\n\r\ndoing the same thing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin and Mr Simon Tay have also suggested that\r\n\r\nthose  who  hold dual citizenship or who have become  PRs  of\r\n\r\nanother  country should not be allowed to register  to  vote.\r\n\r\nFirstly, in order to qualify as a voter, the voter must be  a\r\n\r\nSingapore citizen.  So when registering as an overseas voter,\r\n\r\nthat  person would have to declare that he is still a citizen\r\n\r\nand that he is not disqualified to register as a voter before\r\n\r\nhe  can  vote overseas.  Under section 6 of the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nElections  Act, those citizens who have sworn  allegiance  to\r\n\r\nother  countries,  or those whose names are  entered  on  the\r\n\r\nRegister of Electors in another country, would not qualify to\r\n\r\nvote.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of dual citizenship does not arise because we\r\n\r\ndo  not  recognise dual citizenship.  If a  person  has  dual\r\n\r\ncitizenship, then we can take action to deprive  him  of  his\r\n\r\nSingapore citizenship when we find out.  At the time when the\r\n\r\ncitizen declares that he is a citizen, we do not know  if  he\r\n\r\nis  not already a citizen of another country.  But when he is\r\n\r\nsubsequently found out, then we can take action  against  him\r\n\r\nfor  false declaration, or to deprive him of his citizenship.\r\n\r\nAnd  if he were to return, we can actually prosecute him  for\r\n\r\nmaking a false declaration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards permanent residents, a Singapore citizen who\r\n\r\nis a permanent resident of another country is still a citizen\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, so we cannot say that just because a person is\r\n\r\na  permanent resident of Australia, Britain or United States,\r\n\r\nwe  should  deprive him of his vote.  Until he has  taken  up\r\n\r\ncitizenship of another country and sworn allegiance  to  that\r\n\r\ncountry,  he  is  still  a citizen and  therefore  should  be\r\n\r\neligible to vote.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin also asked whether overseas voting is\r\n\r\ncompulsory.  Voting itself is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompulsory  in  Singapore.   Regardless  of  whether  he   is\r\n\r\noverseas or in Singapore, voting is compulsory.  We have made\r\n\r\nit  available for overseas Singaporeans, those who  have  two\r\n\r\nyears out of five years residency, to register as a voter and\r\n\r\nthey should and could register to vote.  If they do not vote,\r\n\r\nthen  their  names  will be taken off the Register  as  would\r\n\r\nhappen  to them if they were in Singapore.   The practice  is\r\n\r\nno different for overseas voting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some MPs also suggested that to facilitate overseas\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens to vote, why do we not have postal voting.\r\n\r\nPostal  voting  has  its  own set of  problems.   For  postal\r\n\r\nvoting,  we  need  to send the ballot paper  to  that  voter.\r\n\r\nThen, he needs to send the ballot paper back to the Returning\r\n\r\nOfficer.  In the process, the vote can be lost, either in the\r\n\r\npostal  stage when the department sends the ballot paper,  or\r\n\r\nwhen  the  voter  sends the ballot paper back  to  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere  will  be  a  lot  of arguments about  whether  it  was\r\n\r\nactually  done or not.  Besides, our election  period  is  so\r\n\r\nshort.   From the writ of election to nomination and  to  the\r\n\r\nday  of  poll, the time taken for postal voting would not  be\r\n\r\nenough  because  of  our election period.   Also,  votes  are\r\n\r\nsecret.   When ballot papers are sent overseas, who mark  the\r\n\r\nballot papers, who send them back, it is again very difficult\r\n\r\nto  verify  that.   So, the secrecy of  the  votes  would  be\r\n\r\ncompromised, particularly when we do not even know who  marks\r\n\r\nthat ballot paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay also suggested early voting for those who\r\n\r\nhappen  to  leave Singapore.  They are actually in Singapore,\r\n\r\nregistered  as  a Singapore voter, but they happen  to  leave\r\n\r\nSingapore on polling day.  We have considered this.  In other\r\n\r\ncountries, they call this absentee voting.  We again  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  time  to register the absentee voter.  To do  so  means\r\n\r\nthat  we  have to give them the ballot papers beforehand  and\r\n\r\nthe  ballot  papers  cannot  be given  beforehand  until  the\r\n\r\npolling day.  Then, no canvassing is allowed during the  time\r\n\r\nwhen a voter is supposed to vote.  Yet, when he sends in  his\r\n\r\nvote,  for example, somebody may have canvassed him, and  the\r\n\r\nsecrecy of the vote again\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncannot  be  ensured.  It is better that he turns  up  at  the\r\n\r\npolling station to vote.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked whether the Elections Department\r\n\r\ncan  let the candidates know where their overseas voters  are\r\n\r\nresiding  so that the candidates can send whatever  materials\r\n\r\nthat  are  necessary  to keep the voters  informed  of  their\r\n\r\nplatform,  promises, and whatever.  That overseas  voter  has\r\n\r\nregistered  a  Singapore  address.   The  best  way  for  the\r\n\r\ncandidate is actually to send the material to that particular\r\n\r\naddress which the candidate could get by buying the Register,\r\n\r\nand  then  let voter's relatives send him those communication\r\n\r\nmaterials  rather than for the candidate to do  so,  as  that\r\n\r\nwould involve other operational difficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On electronic voting, there are a few questions about\r\n\r\nallowing  the  voter a choice between electronic  voting  and\r\n\r\npaper  voting.  Mr Chiam and Mr Noris Ong asked that  we  try\r\n\r\nout both the paper ballot as well as the electronic ballot on\r\n\r\na pilot basis.  Mr Chiam himself also said that we should not\r\n\r\nhave more than one system operating in an election.   He also\r\n\r\nsaid  that  we  should not implement electronic voting  until\r\n\r\neverything  is  ready and able to be universally  implemented\r\n\r\nfor  all  the  constituencies.  Some also asked  why  we  are\r\n\r\nrushing  into  this  and  that  we  should  not  choose   the\r\n\r\nOpposition wards for trying out electronic voting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Chiam contradicted himself in some of his\r\n\r\ncomments.   On  one  hand, he said that both  the  electronic\r\n\r\nvoting  system and the paper ballot system be made  available\r\n\r\nfor  voters  to  choose  should we decide  to  implement  the\r\n\r\nelectronic voting.  On the other hand, he said that we should\r\n\r\nnot have more than one type of voting system.  We cannot have\r\n\r\nboth  situations.  In the way he argued it, it does not  make\r\n\r\nsense.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing voters to have different systems in the same\r\n\r\npolling station would actually complicate the voting process.\r\n\r\nI  cannot  imagine  a situation where we have,  say,  in  one\r\n\r\nconstituency where e-voting and paper ballot are carried out\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nat  the  same  time, and the voters can do both at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime.   When  that happens, who would ensure that that  voter\r\n\r\nvotes  for the same party, both on the paper ballot  and  the\r\n\r\nelectronic  ballot?  He could press \"PAP\" on the screen,  but\r\n\r\non the ballot paper, he marks, say, \"SPP\" (for the sake of Mr\r\n\r\nChiam).  When the officials do the count, they will find that\r\n\r\nthe  results are totally different and Mr Chiam will then say\r\n\r\nthat  the system cannot be trusted.  It is a very silly idea.\r\n\r\nIt  is  totally impracticable.  It is impossible to implement\r\n\r\nunless  we  have the Presiding Officer standing next  to  the\r\n\r\nvoter and say, \"Let me make sure that you mark \"PAP\" on  both\r\n\r\nthe  electronic  screen as well as on the paper  ballot,  and\r\n\r\nafter that you drop the paper ballot into the box\".  But does\r\n\r\nthe  voter want the election officials to do that - to  watch\r\n\r\nwhat  he  votes?  After all, voting is secret.   I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould not try this idea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why we are only trying this out on a limited\r\n\r\nscale, as some have also noted that this is the first time we\r\n\r\nare  having  electronic voting, I think it  is  not  wise  to\r\n\r\nimplement  electronic voting for all the constituencies  that\r\n\r\nare  being contested.  It is better to start on a small scale\r\n\r\nand  make it easily understood and educate the voters of that\r\n\r\nparticular constituency, make sure people understand  how  it\r\n\r\nworks  and  have confidence in the system before we implement\r\n\r\nit  in  other constituencies.  It has nothing to do with  the\r\n\r\nconfidence  of  the  system.  I am quite sure  that  when  we\r\n\r\nimplement  this  system,  we  will  be  able  to  ensure  the\r\n\r\nintegrity  of voting system.  The votes will be secret.   The\r\n\r\nvoter  could not be traced unless it is ordered by the court.\r\n\r\nAnd  the election official would not know who that voter  has\r\n\r\nvoted  for, even looking at his screen.  I can assure Members\r\n\r\nthat in the verification, certification, testing of the whole\r\n\r\nsystem,   the  Auditor-General,  who  is  tasked  with   that\r\n\r\nresponsibility, would make very sure of that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trying this system out on a small scale is not something\r\n\r\nthat  is  really  new.  Other countries,  like  Belgium,  for\r\n\r\nexample, tried\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nout  electronic voting in 1991 in two electoral cantons.  The\r\n\r\nDutch  tried  out the touch-screen system in  1998  in  eight\r\n\r\nmunicipalities.  I am told that they would be expanding  this\r\n\r\nto  other municipalities and cantons.  It is not uncommon  to\r\n\r\nhave  different voting systems in the same country.  Look  at\r\n\r\nthe  United  States.  They have different voting  systems  in\r\n\r\ndifferent  states, and even within the same state, they  have\r\n\r\ndifferent voting systems in different counties.  We can  have\r\n\r\ndifferent voting systems, provided people are educated  about\r\n\r\nthem  and  officials are trained to do the  job,  and  people\r\n\r\nunderstand the system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam is afraid that we will implement e-voting in\r\n\r\nPotong  Pasir.  I can assure him that since he does not  like\r\n\r\nit, we will not implement it there.  I do not know whether Mr\r\n\r\nLow Thia Khiang would volunteer or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Mr Low does not mind. He has great\r\n\r\nconfidence in the system.  Our Elections Department would  be\r\n\r\nquite  careful to determine where to implement e-voting.   In\r\n\r\nMr  Chiam's case, for example, he is afraid that if he loses,\r\n\r\nthen  what  happens?  Could he put the blame on the  e-voting\r\n\r\nsystem?  For that reason, I think we will definitely not have\r\n\r\ne-voting  in  Potong Pasir.  Otherwise, if Mr Chiam  were  to\r\n\r\nlose,  he  will  blame it on the system,  and  we  will  have\r\n\r\nendless trouble. For Hougang, maybe we will consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam and Mr Jeyaretnam have also asked why are we\r\n\r\nrushing  into this.  They said that the time is so short  and\r\n\r\nthis  is such a great secret.  There is no secret about this.\r\n\r\nThe  fact is that it was made known and we start to tell  the\r\n\r\npublic.  Eventually, we educate the public about it,  and  we\r\n\r\ncannot do this in secret.  If we want this to have widespread\r\n\r\nacceptance  and  easy  to understand,  we  must  tell  people\r\n\r\nbeforehand.   But before the system can even be  implemented,\r\n\r\nit  has  to  be tested and certified before we can implement.\r\n\r\nAnd unless the system is ready  -  in other words, tested and\r\n\r\ncertified before the writ\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  issued   -   we will not implement the electronic  voting\r\n\r\nsystem.   We  can  only  do so when the system  is  certified\r\n\r\nbefore the writ is issued.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question of secrecy of votes seems to trouble\r\n\r\npeople.  Let me assure Members that the secrecy of votes will\r\n\r\nbe  maintained, just as in the paper ballot system.  It is no\r\n\r\ndifferent.   In  the  writing of  the  software  and  in  the\r\n\r\ndesigning of the system, in the machines, in the connections,\r\n\r\nthe  Auditor-General will make sure that  this  will  be  the\r\n\r\ncase.   I cannot get into the technical details of the system\r\n\r\nright  now, but, definitely, voter secrecy is the key feature\r\n\r\nin the e-voting system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the testing process, at the end of it, before it is\r\n\r\nsealed, Opposition parties can send their representatives  to\r\n\r\nsee to it that the system works in the way it is intended  to\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an audit trail in the paper ballot. There will\r\n\r\nalso  be  an audit trail in the e-voting system.   The  audit\r\n\r\ntrail  is  not to check who voted for whom after the election\r\n\r\nby  the  Government.  The audit trail is to  make  sure  that\r\n\r\nindeed a vote was registered by such and such a voter bearing\r\n\r\nthat particular serial number. And, eventually, when there is\r\n\r\nto  be  a check arising from an election petition, then there\r\n\r\nis  a  record  of that vote, voter and so on.   That  is  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of the audit trail.  Nobody will know who voted  for\r\n\r\nwhom  until  there  is an election petition  ordered  by  the\r\n\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The election official will not know how a voter voted\r\n\r\nduring the voting process.  Unless, of course, the voter  who\r\n\r\nneeds   assistance,  say,  a  person  who  is  blind,   needs\r\n\r\nassistance  and says to the election official,  \"Please  mark\r\n\r\nthis for me.\"  And this is nothing new.  This is also done in\r\n\r\nthe  paper ballot system.  So only in that instance will  the\r\n\r\nvote  be  known to the Presiding Officer.  But that Presiding\r\n\r\nOfficer,  the election official, has been sworn  to  secrecy.\r\n\r\nSo Members can be assured that it will be kept that way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of senior citizens and their fear of\r\n\r\nmachines, let me assure\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMembers there will be an extensive public education programme\r\n\r\nto educate the public about the electronic voting system.  We\r\n\r\nwill involve the various community organisations in this.  We\r\n\r\nwill also put this in some of the shopping malls where people\r\n\r\ngo  to.  During the election campaign when a constituency  is\r\n\r\nselected,  we  will  also make extra effort  to  educate  the\r\n\r\nvoters   of  that  particular  constituency,  so   that   the\r\n\r\nconstituents  can go to the community centre, community  club\r\n\r\nor other community buildings and premises to learn how to use\r\n\r\nthe system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On polling day itself, we will also set up demonstration\r\n\r\nmachines.  But the demonstration machines will not  bear  the\r\n\r\nsame  kind of ballot paper symbols as in the actual  contest.\r\n\r\nIt  will be just a mock-up showing different symbols, and the\r\n\r\nvoter will be taught how to use the machines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There could also be a video screening during the time\r\n\r\nthat  the  voters line up to vote, for them to  see  how  the\r\n\r\nvoting  is to be done, just to refresh the memory.   If  they\r\n\r\nstill need assistance, the election officials will be on hand\r\n\r\nto  show them how to vote at the demonstration set.  So there\r\n\r\nwill be a lot of education.  In the process of educating  the\r\n\r\npublic  before  the writ is issued and before the  system  is\r\n\r\ncertified, we will try to get feedback from them.   If  there\r\n\r\nare  good  ideas to incorporate in the system, they  will  be\r\n\r\nincorporated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang and some MPs have asked what happens if the\r\n\r\nsystem breaks down half way.  If the system breaks down  half\r\n\r\nway,  there will be technical staff on standby to try to  fix\r\n\r\nthe  problem.   There  will be power generators  on  standby.\r\n\r\nThere will be extra machines on standby, so that these can be\r\n\r\nused  to  supplement either the power outages or the machines\r\n\r\nthat  cannot  work.  But in the event that everything  cannot\r\n\r\nwork,  we  can still use the paper ballot.  What  happens  to\r\n\r\nthose  voters who have already voted electronically?  Are  we\r\n\r\ngoing  to  call  them  back?  There is no  need  to,  because\r\n\r\nwhatever  votes  that  are recorded in the  machine  will  be\r\n\r\nstored there, and they can be read and counted, and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsystem  will know who have voted.  So we can be rest  assured\r\n\r\nthat  we  will  try to find all possible ways  and  means  to\r\n\r\novercome this problem of machine breakdown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam is not here. His usual practice is to\r\n\r\nraise  points and then he absents himself and does not bother\r\n\r\nto  listen to the answers.  Then, at subsequent sittings,  he\r\n\r\nwill raise the same points again because he did not hear  the\r\n\r\nanswers.   It  is not for his sake, but for the  reason  that\r\n\r\nbecause  he  raised some of these points  -  and I  think  he\r\n\r\nmade  serious  allegations which are totally baseless   -   I\r\n\r\nmust counter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the points he made was that this Bill be referred\r\n\r\nto  a Select Committee.  There is no need to do so because we\r\n\r\nare  not  doing  something which is  totally  new.   This  is\r\n\r\nsomething that has been tried by many other countries, and we\r\n\r\nare  learning and adapting it for our use.  So I do not think\r\n\r\nthere is a need to refer this Bill to a Select Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cited a long list of complaints about fairness and\r\n\r\nunfairness in elections and the confidence of the  people  in\r\n\r\nthe  electoral process.  He tried to discredit our  electoral\r\n\r\nprocess  by  giving  examples of the 1980 election  in  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah  or  the  1997 election in Cheng San where  he  lost.\r\n\r\nThen  out  of  nowhere, he talked about the 1993 Presidential\r\n\r\nelection,  which  he said people had told him  that  Mr  Chua\r\n\r\nshould  have won.  These are totally baseless and  groundless\r\n\r\nallegations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam is a lawyer. He knows the law. I presume\r\n\r\nhe  does.   If he believes that there is electoral  fraud,  I\r\n\r\nthink  given half a chance, he will make a big song and dance\r\n\r\nout  of it.  He will make a big issue of it, and he will  not\r\n\r\nhesitate to take the matter to court.  He has sued the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  but he lost.  That is an example of how he  decided\r\n\r\nthat  he  should  use the court as a process  to  settle  his\r\n\r\nproblem.    He is now suing his party leaders.  He knows  how\r\n\r\nto  make  full use of the law.  So if there is  any  sign  or\r\n\r\nevidence that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>1980&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telok  Blangah election or the 1997 Cheng San  election\r\n\r\nwas  fraudulent, he would have gone straight  to  the  court.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  he did.  He asked somebody.  Maybe he did  not  ask,\r\n\r\nbut  somebody  complained about the 1980  election  in  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah  and he went to court to petition but it  was  thrown\r\n\r\nout.    I  do not know why Mr Jeyaretnam keeps on harking  on\r\n\r\nthese issues, as if it is such a big thing to him when he has\r\n\r\ngot  no basis in his allegation.  The only conclusion that  I\r\n\r\ncan  come  to is that when he raised the point,  he  did  not\r\n\r\nbother  to  listen  to  the  answers.   Then  he  comes  back\r\n\r\nsubsequently  rehashing  the same  old  points  like  an  old\r\n\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam also seems to have a perverse\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of what is a free and fair election.   A  free\r\n\r\nand  fair  election, to him, means that when he wins,  it  is\r\n\r\nfree and fair.  When he loses, it is not free and fair.  Like\r\n\r\nMr Ravindran said, he won in the 1981 by-election.  He won in\r\n\r\n1984.  He did not complain that these were not won freely and\r\n\r\nfairly.   We had four Opposition MPs in 1991  -  Mr  Low,  Mr\r\n\r\nChiam,  Mr  Ling How Doong and Mr Cheo Chai Chen.  They  won.\r\n\r\nThey  have not made allegations that the elections which they\r\n\r\nwon  were  not  free  and  fair.  So it  is  Mr  Jeyaretnam's\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of what is \"free and fair\" election.   To  me,\r\n\r\nhis definition is quite perverse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have any doubt that our Elections Department,\r\n\r\nthe  Returning  Officers and all those who assist  them  will\r\n\r\ncarry  out  their duties fairly and impartially.   He  talked\r\n\r\nabout  other countries having election commissions.  He  also\r\n\r\ncited  the  example of the Philippines where  they  have  NGO\r\n\r\nelection  watchers.  We know what happens in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nDo  they  have free and fair elections?  I do  not  know.   I\r\n\r\nthink only Mr Jeyaretnam thinks so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, it is not a question of whether or not we\r\n\r\nhave  an  independent election commission,  or  an  Elections\r\n\r\nDepartment under the Prime Minister's Office.  Ultimately, in\r\n\r\nevery system or every commission or mission, it is the people\r\n\r\nbehind it.  The people who run and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmanage the system must have the honesty and integrity to make\r\n\r\nsure  that  they do their job properly.  That is  the  litmus\r\n\r\ntest,  not  the number of commissions that we have,  not  the\r\n\r\ntype of systems that we have.  It is ultimately the integrity\r\n\r\nof the people who run it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran asked me who is this other person, apart\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Auditor-General who may be appointed to audit  the\r\n\r\nsystem.   Right now, we do not have any particular person  in\r\n\r\nmind.   But like many of the other statutes that we have,  we\r\n\r\neither get the Auditor-General or somebody else appointed  in\r\n\r\nconsultation  with the Auditor-General to  do  the  auditing.\r\n\r\nThat person must be someone with the skills, the expertise to\r\n\r\ndo  the  job of testing and certifying the electronic  voting\r\n\r\nsystem.   For  example, it could well be one  of  the  public\r\n\r\naccounting firms that has the expertise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have answered most of the points, if\r\n\r\nnot all of them, raised by Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, I just like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister a clarification.  He mentioned just now that  voting\r\n\r\nis compulsory, and that one of the consequences of not voting\r\n\r\nwill be that your name will be expunged from the register  of\r\n\r\nelectors.  If a person were to be overseas and qualifies  but\r\n\r\nhe  happens, for example, to be working in Germany or Norway,\r\n\r\nhe would have difficulty going to London to vote.  Is there a\r\n\r\nduty  on him to register?  And if he registers, must he  also\r\n\r\ntravel physically to London to vote?  What happens if he does\r\n\r\nnot?   Will  his name then be expunged from the  register  of\r\n\r\nelectors and will there be a chance for him to reinstate  his\r\n\r\nname with minimum inconvenience?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I think this situation is no\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  a person who is working overseas  but  whose\r\n\r\nname  appears on the Electoral Register.  So if,  because  of\r\n\r\nwork,  he  cannot come back to vote right now, then his  name\r\n\r\nwill be taken off the register.  But if he has a reason to be\r\n\r\naway - he shows his\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npassport and says he was away in Germany and therefore cannot\r\n\r\ncome  back  to vote - then his name will be restored  in  the\r\n\r\nregister.  Similarly, in the case of an overseas register, it\r\n\r\nis  the  same  thing.   We  open the  register  for  overseas\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to register, they check and they register.   And\r\n\r\nif  they  do not go and vote, their names will be taken  out.\r\n\r\nIf  they happen to stay in Germany but the polling station is\r\n\r\nin  London,  he has a good reason not being able to  turn  up\r\n\r\nphysically  to vote in London, then again his name  would  be\r\n\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Minister has not responded\r\n\r\nto  some of the issues I raised in my speech.  One is that  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that the receipt system should become  part  of  the\r\n\r\nelectronic  voting system in the future.  I  am  also  asking\r\n\r\nwhether it is possible to actually simplify the process of e-voting.   Right  now, you have three panels - languages,  the\r\n\r\nvote, and then \"Yes\" and \"No\".  Can we do away with the first\r\n\r\npanel,  and just have two panels, and also instead  of  \"Yes\"\r\n\r\nand  \"No\" or in other languages, can we not use some symbols,\r\n\r\nwhich would be easier for people who may be illiterate?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I think, for background purposes,\r\n\r\nthere  are  others who do not know what is  actually  on  the\r\n\r\nscreen,  let  me explain.  There was a demonstration  by  the\r\n\r\nElections Department for the MPs a few days ago to  show  how\r\n\r\nthe  screen looks like.  That is only an example of  how  the\r\n\r\nscreen will look like.  Ultimately, how the screen will  look\r\n\r\nlike depends on the submissions made by the tenderers of  the\r\n\r\nsystem.   They  may come back with a different screen.   They\r\n\r\nmay  come back with a different image and we have to  decide.\r\n\r\nBut  I take the point that we should make it simple and  easy\r\n\r\nfor people to understand, and for them to just simply perform\r\n\r\nthe  task without great difficulty.  That is a point that  we\r\n\r\nwill take into account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the paper vote, actually it is a paper receipt, I\r\n\r\nsaid that during this trial we will have a touch screen,  and\r\n\r\nthen to assure the voters that what they touch on the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nscreen  actually  gets recorded, we have a paper  receipt  to\r\n\r\nshow  them  that it is indeed the candidate they have  voted.\r\n\r\nJust  like  in  the supermarket, you have a receipt.   But  a\r\n\r\nvoter  cannot  take that paper receipt with  him  because  he\r\n\r\ncannot take the ballot paper out of the polling station.   So\r\n\r\nthat  paper  receipt is cut and stored in a  box  which  will\r\n\r\neventually  be  sealed together with the other  vote  storage\r\n\r\ncards in the vault of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a trial feature. Whether we will extend this\r\n\r\nfeature in future or not, I think we will have to study this.\r\n\r\nMaybe  in  five or six years' time, after the next  election,\r\n\r\nthere will be a totally different technology altogether  that\r\n\r\nwill  obviate the need for this particular paper trail.   But\r\n\r\nwhatever it is, with or without the paper trail, there is  an\r\n\r\naudit trail, that is, an electronic trail, that can show  the\r\n\r\nvoter,  serial number and his vote, and that is the  ultimate\r\n\r\ntest.   The paper is just to assure the voter.  That  is  it.\r\n\r\nWhen  we want to do a recount, there can be a recount.  There\r\n\r\nis  a paper receipt to do the recount.  But from the examples\r\n\r\nthat  I  have seen in Belgium and the Netherlands,  in  their\r\n\r\nelectronic voting, the touch screen and the card, there is no\r\n\r\npaper.   It is completely electronic.  A recount is all  done\r\n\r\nelectronically.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have forgotten to answer one question on the vote\r\n\r\nmargin  -  why  2%?  Two percent is actually a very  generous\r\n\r\nfigure.   We  can  have 5%; we can have 10%.  But  ultimately\r\n\r\nwhat is it that we want to see?  We want to see that there is\r\n\r\na  fair amount of a margin to take care of a margin of manual\r\n\r\ncounting  error.  Looking at the elections of the  last  many\r\n\r\nyears, actually 2% is already very generous.  In the examples\r\n\r\nthat  I  have quoted, in the United States, some states  have\r\n\r\nonly  0.1%; in Canada's Federal Election, 0.1%; and  in  some\r\n\r\nother  states,  1%.  Of course, there are also  other  states\r\n\r\nwhich have 5%.  There is a variation in the US.  In Malaysia,\r\n\r\nit is 2%.  So if you look at 2%, it is a reasonable margin.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, does the Minister agree that\r\n\r\nthere are important\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nissues  in  this  electronic voting?  One  is  the  issue  of\r\n\r\nsecrecy  of  vote, and the other is how the  votes  cast  are\r\n\r\nrecorded electronically and counted correctly.  I think it is\r\n\r\nnot  enough for the Minister to just say that, \"I assure  you\r\n\r\nthat  the  vote  will be secret.\"  Does he agree  that,  most\r\n\r\nimportantly,  we  must  convince the public  how  the  system\r\n\r\nworks, no matter how technical it is, and how the program  is\r\n\r\nwritten  in  such  a  way that it cannot  be  tampered  with?\r\n\r\nBecause, for instance, someone has asked me, \"How do you know\r\n\r\nthat  the program will not be written in such a way that  for\r\n\r\nevery   two   votes   cast  for  an  Opposition,   one   will\r\n\r\nautomatically  be converted to vote for the  PAP?\"   I  think\r\n\r\nthese  are  issues which require more than  just  saying,  \"I\r\n\r\nassure you\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point which the Minister made about the job\r\n\r\nbeing done by civil servants and that their integrity and the\r\n\r\nhuman  factor  are  important, does  he  agree  that  besides\r\n\r\ntrusting  the  civil servants' integrity in implementing  the\r\n\r\nsystem, it is also important that it has to be transparent so\r\n\r\nthat  the public know what they are doing are done correctly?\r\n\r\nAnd  is  there  any safeguard that the civil servants  cannot\r\n\r\nfollow the rules for the PAP?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I think it is right to say that we\r\n\r\njust  cannot say the vote  is secret, do not worry  about  it\r\n\r\nand  that is it.  We have to assure the public.  I take  that\r\n\r\npoint.   Therefore, in the process of testing and certifying,\r\n\r\nthere is an authority, that is, the Auditor-General.  But  he\r\n\r\nis  not  alone, he is there to do the job, he  will  have  to\r\n\r\ndemonstrate to whoever that are present during the  test  and\r\n\r\ncertification  that this is indeed so.  And we  can  actually\r\n\r\nget  experts to check that.  But where do we end?   Supposing\r\n\r\nwe  get another expert to check on the Auditor-General, maybe\r\n\r\nanother person to check on the expert, and so on and  so  on.\r\n\r\nHere  we  have  the  Elections  Department  working  out  the\r\n\r\nsoftware,  the system and the program.  There is  a  checking\r\n\r\nbody - the Auditor-General - to make sure that it is designed\r\n\r\nto do what it is supposed to do and no more, whether it is to\r\n\r\ntrack  the vote, whether it is to add votes or convert  votes\r\n\r\nof Opposition into PAP.  And how\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore  transparent  can it be when that is  being  tested  and\r\n\r\nchecked by a third party?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This checking by a third party is not something that we\r\n\r\ninvented.   It is something that is also being done  in  some\r\n\r\ncountries.   In Belgium, for example, they have a smart  card\r\n\r\nsystem,  which  is  also electronic.  It is  checked  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  the  Interior, and the Ministry  in  charge  of\r\n\r\nelections is the Ministry of the Interior, the equivalent  of\r\n\r\nHome Affairs Ministry.  There has been no suggestion that the\r\n\r\nMinistry of the Interior is trying to fix the results for the\r\n\r\ngovernment  party.  In the Netherlands, the system  is  being\r\n\r\nworked  out by the election commission officials  and  it  is\r\n\r\nchecked by a team from the university, and they accept  that.\r\n\r\nIn  the United States, there are various systems and they are\r\n\r\nchecked  by a private company.  Again, they accept that,  and\r\n\r\nthere has been no allegation that these systems could produce\r\n\r\nthe fraud that Mr Low just suggested.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, ultimately, it must therefore depend on, firstly,\r\n\r\nthe  people who design the software, who work out the system,\r\n\r\nand  then  the  Auditor-General.  The  Auditor-General  is  a\r\n\r\nscheduled   post  and  that  person  is  trusted   with   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility to ensure that the design would do what it  is\r\n\r\nsupposed to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Yes, there are checks. But is the\r\n\r\nMinister aware of the public perception that all these checks\r\n\r\nare  done by the Government?  There does not seem to  be  any\r\n\r\nthird  party  or  independent party to  witness  or  actually\r\n\r\nconduct the check.  So would he actually consider inviting an\r\n\r\noutsider, not within the Government, for instance, an auditor\r\n\r\nfrom outside the Government, to check the system?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> That is why we have it in the\r\n\r\nprovision that this certification and testing will be done by\r\n\r\n\"the Auditor-General; or any person appointed by the Minister\r\n\r\nin   consultation   with  the  Auditor-General\",   and   that\r\n\r\nparticular  phrase  \"any  person\"  could  well  be  a  public\r\n\r\naccounting firm.  But this is a trial\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproject,  we are doing it for the first time, and we  do  not\r\n\r\nknow the scale of it.  Eventually the Auditor-General may not\r\n\r\nhave  enough people to do the job and we may have to  find  a\r\n\r\nthird  party, those in the private sector, to help to do  the\r\n\r\njob.  So that possibility is not ruled out.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will allow one last clarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, the Minister has\r\n\r\nexplained  the  different treatment  of  the  public  sector,\r\n\r\neither   scholars   or  those  who  are  sent   overseas   on\r\n\r\nassignments, as opposed to those in the private  sector,  and\r\n\r\nthose  who  go and study on their own.  I think he has  cited\r\n\r\nthe   examples   of  the  fact  that  those   on   Government\r\n\r\nscholarships are bonded to come back and serve and  those  in\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service  will return.  But,  nevertheless,  while\r\n\r\nthere  is  merit in this argument and also the precedents  in\r\n\r\nother countries, there will be those who feel aggrieved that,\r\n\r\nin  essence,  really  two  students in  the  same  university\r\n\r\noverseas  pursuing  the same course,  one  sponsored  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the other on his own funding, would be treated\r\n\r\ndifferently.   So I would urge the Minister  to  assure  this\r\n\r\nHouse  whether  there  would be  scope  to  treat  these  two\r\n\r\ncategories  equally since, I think, we can  be  assured  that\r\n\r\nchances are there would be commitment to the country on  both\r\n\r\ncounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, wherever we draw the line, there\r\n\r\nwill  be others who fall outside the line and who would  feel\r\n\r\naggrieved.

But no law is cast in stone and concrete.  So  as\r\n\r\nwe progress, as we learn, as we eventually try to improve the\r\n\r\nsystem, modifications can be made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

We\r\n\r\nalso  sought  the  views  of the relevant  civic  groups  and\r\n\r\nconsidered   the  recommendations  made  by  several   inter-Government Committees looking into issues related to juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments that we are now proposing are the outcome\r\n\r\nof  these  consultations.   Let  me  now  go  into  the  main\r\n\r\namendments of this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, among the sentencing options that the courts\r\n\r\ncurrently have for young offenders, include probation,  fine,\r\n\r\napproved school orders, bonding of parents or guardians, etc.\r\n\r\nClauses 19 and 20 of the Amendment Bill will allow the courts\r\n\r\ngreater  flexibility when meting out sentences by introducing\r\n\r\nnew sentencing options which include:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Family conferencing. This allows the court to bring\r\n\r\ntogether  people  who are directly affected by  a  juvenile's\r\n\r\noffending  behaviour to reach a consensus on  an  appropriate\r\n\r\ncourse  of  action.   It  provides  an  opportunity  for  the\r\n\r\njuvenile  to  make reparations or tender an  apology  to  the\r\n\r\nvictim(s) of his offending behaviour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The community service order. This allows the court\r\n\r\nto  require  a  juvenile  to  perform  community  service  as\r\n\r\nreparation  for  his  offence, either as  a  condition  of  a\r\n\r\nProbation Order or as a Stand-alone Order.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Weekend or periodic detention order. This allows a\r\n\r\njuvenile who has committed a fairly serious offence, but  has\r\n\r\na  supportive family environment, to remain with  the  family\r\n\r\nand  continue his education without disruption.  The juvenile\r\n\r\ncan  be  detained  during  weekends  in  an  institution  for\r\n\r\nstructured programmes as punishment or for rehabilitation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Probation with detention. Where juvenile offenders\r\n\r\ncan be institutionalised over a period of not exceeding three\r\n\r\nmonths,  this  is targeted at juveniles who are suitable  for\r\n\r\nprobation  but  would  benefit  from  exposure  to   a   more\r\n\r\nstructured and disciplined programme.  It is also  meant  for\r\n\r\nprobationers who breach their probation orders and need to be\r\n\r\ndisciplined  without a revocation of their probation  orders.\r\n\r\nIt  is  hoped  that the tougher programme in the  institution\r\n\r\nwould  have a salutary effect on the offender and reduce  the\r\n\r\nlikelihood of his/her re-offending.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 17 and 20 of the Amendment Bill will also\r\n\r\naddress  the problem of parents who relinquish their parental\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  once their child has been  brought  to  the\r\n\r\nattention  of  the  court.  To sustain the  positive  changes\r\n\r\nduring  the  rehabilitation process, the  family  has  to  be\r\n\r\nactive in supporting the child.  The Juvenile Court will have\r\n\r\nthe  discretionary power to order the involvement of  parents\r\n\r\nor guardians in the rehabilitation of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchild  or  young  person.  Parents or guardians  who  do  not\r\n\r\ncomply with any order can be fined up to $2,000 or have their\r\n\r\nbond forfeited.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court will also be able to order the parents or\r\n\r\nguardians   to   appear   before  a   medical   practitioner,\r\n\r\npsychologist or a welfare officer for assessment.  This  will\r\n\r\nenable  a  professional to assess the parent's or  guardian's\r\n\r\nphysical,  psychological, emotional and social well-being  to\r\n\r\ndetermine   the  appropriate  intervention   for   care   and\r\n\r\nprotection cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 16, 26 and 45 of the Bill will enhance the\r\n\r\nwelfare  and protection of children and young persons.   Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  existing provision to protect the identity  of\r\n\r\nchildren and young persons who are subjects or respondents in\r\n\r\nan  investigation into an offence under the Act or the  Penal\r\n\r\nCode from the broadcast media.  Protecting their identity  is\r\n\r\ncrucial in order not to hamper the investigation process  and\r\n\r\nto  minimise  the trauma that may occur with any  disclosure.\r\n\r\nThe  Bill,  therefore, will restrict all media reporting  the\r\n\r\nproceedings  in any Court from disclosing the identity  of  a\r\n\r\njuvenile, unless the Court or the Minister dispenses with the\r\n\r\nrequirement in the interest of justice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments are also being made to protect those who are\r\n\r\nrequired  to  make  a  professional assessment  in  the  best\r\n\r\ninterest  of the child or young person, especially  in  child\r\n\r\nabuse  cases,  where  professional judgement  should  not  be\r\n\r\nhindered  or  clouded  by  fear of legal  implications.   The\r\n\r\nprovision  will  safeguard the interest of medical  officers,\r\n\r\nwelfare  officers and the police who are often  subjected  to\r\n\r\nabuse  and  threat  of legal suits by parents  and  guardians\r\n\r\nduring  the  investigation of child abuse, child  neglect  or\r\n\r\ndelinquent behaviour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children who are emotionally and psychologically abused\r\n\r\nusually  suffer long-term effects, if not helped.   There  is\r\n\r\ncurrently no provision in the Act to require suspected  cases\r\n\r\nof  emotional  or psychological abuse to receive professional\r\n\r\nassessment to ascertain abuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe amendments, Sir, will empower the Protector to require  a\r\n\r\nchild  or  young person, who is suspected to be a  victim  of\r\n\r\nemotional or psychological abuse, to be assessed.   Should  a\r\n\r\nparent or guardian ignore the instruction, the Protector  may\r\n\r\nremove   the  child  or  young  person  for  assessment   and\r\n\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 19 and 44 of the Bill concern the transfer of\r\n\r\nyoung  offenders  to the Reformative Training  Centre  (RTC).\r\n\r\nCurrently,  the Centre, which is under the Prisons Department\r\n\r\nof the Ministry of Home Affairs, only takes in offenders aged\r\n\r\n16-21  years.  The proposed amendments will allow those  aged\r\n\r\n14-16  years who have committed a very serious offence to  be\r\n\r\ntransferred  to  the RTC.  Sir, I would like to  stress  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  strict conditions attached to this new provision,\r\n\r\nto ensure that the young person is given ample opportunity to\r\n\r\nreform within the juvenile justice system.  For example,  the\r\n\r\nyoung  person must have gone through an MCDS Approved  School\r\n\r\nbefore he can be directly admitted to RTC.  Furthermore,  the\r\n\r\noffender  must be such an unruly character that he is  beyond\r\n\r\nthe rehabilitative ability of the juvenile justice system and\r\n\r\nthat  his  presence  in  the MCDS Approved  School  would  be\r\n\r\ndisruptive for the rehabilitation of other juveniles there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 31, 32, 38, 39 and 40 of the Bill concern the\r\n\r\nsecurity    and    management   of   juvenile    correctional\r\n\r\ninstitutions.   The amendments will allow  staff  working  in\r\n\r\nthese  institutions to use reasonable restraint on residents.\r\n\r\nHowever,  Sir,  there are strict guidelines  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nstaff do not overstep the boundaries of their authority.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  reasonable restraint or force is  only  allowed  in\r\n\r\nemergency situations, such as when residents riot in the Home\r\n\r\nor where residents attack staff.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 39 specifically states that every person detained\r\n\r\nunder  the  Act in an approved school or approved  home  will\r\n\r\nserve  the full period of detention and will be deemed to  be\r\n\r\nin  lawful custody until he or she is discharged.  Should the\r\n\r\nperson escape, he or she may be apprehended\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwithout warrant and be brought back to the approved school or\r\n\r\napproved home in which he or she was detained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 40, Sir, will also address the problem of\r\n\r\nparents,   family   members  or  ex-residents   who   smuggle\r\n\r\ncontraband  articles  such as cigarettes,  lighters,  blades,\r\n\r\nglue  and  Chinese tobacco, or what they call \"Ang Hoon\",  to\r\n\r\nresidents  in  approved schools.  Each year, Sir,  there  are\r\n\r\nabout  10  such incidents in the Government-run homes.   With\r\n\r\nthe   amendment,  it  will  be  an  offence  now  to  smuggle\r\n\r\nunauthorised or forbidden articles to residents  in  approved\r\n\r\nschools,  approved homes, institutions or places of detention\r\n\r\nor remand homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry currently administers three approved\r\n\r\nschools,  homes and institutions for juvenile  offenders  and\r\n\r\nchildren  and young persons.  Another three institutions  are\r\n\r\nrun  by  voluntary welfare organisations.  The new  provision\r\n\r\nwill  allow the Minister to appoint Governing Boards for  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  approved homes, schools and institutions  for\r\n\r\nchildren and young persons established under section 62.  The\r\n\r\nBoards will ensure good standards of management and practices\r\n\r\nin these institutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Amendment Bill aims to improve the\r\n\r\ncare,  protection  and rehabilitation of children  and  young\r\n\r\npersons.  These amendments make the legislation more flexible\r\n\r\nand  ensure parental responsibility and participation in  the\r\n\r\nrehabilitation    process.    Parental   responsibility    is\r\n\r\nespecially  important,  as parents  must  ultimately  be  the\r\n\r\ncarers,  nurturers and protectors of our children  and  young\r\n\r\npeople.  So they must take this responsibility seriously  and\r\n\r\nthe state should step in only as a last resort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have\r\n\r\nhad  two days of long debate.  I am sure you would appreciate\r\n\r\nMembers to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  short  and  precise.  I hope that my other Members  would\r\n\r\nalso get to the point as I will be doing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments in the Children and Young Persons\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill will make the Act more comprehensive.   The\r\n\r\nprovisions to deal with psychological abuse and to  prescribe\r\n\r\nother forms of rehabilitation measures for the protection  of\r\n\r\nchildren and young persons are indeed useful.  This brings it\r\n\r\nin  line with the provisions in many developed countries.  It\r\n\r\nalso  meets  the  UN conventions on the rights  of  children.\r\n\r\nWith  these amendments, we have indeed moved to a  very  good\r\n\r\nmilestone  of  development  in terms  of  the  protection  of\r\n\r\nchildren and young persons in the context of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever the rehabilitation measures, I think it is\r\n\r\nvery  important to ensure that families and individuals  take\r\n\r\nresponsibility for their behaviour.  Unless we  ensure  this,\r\n\r\nthen  all  these rehabilitation measures which the  Bill  has\r\n\r\nprovided for will come to nought.  I think that objective  is\r\n\r\nindeed  very  critical  and  very  important  in  the   whole\r\n\r\nrehabilitation procedures that we are going to implement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the protection of children against psychological\r\n\r\nabuse  is indeed important.  This is also timely in  view  of\r\n\r\nthe  increase  in  marital discords and divorces.   Sir,  the\r\n\r\ndivorce rate has increased from 4.5% per thousand in 1989  to\r\n\r\n7.1% per thousand in 1999.  There is an increase, though  not\r\n\r\nsignificant.   But what is most important  is  that  many  of\r\n\r\nthese children are caught between disputes of parents.   Many\r\n\r\nof  these children are innocent and they are in the  line  of\r\n\r\ncrossfires of discords between parents, and they might suffer\r\n\r\npsychological abuse in these cases.  It is very crucial, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  at times of marital discord between parents we are able\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  services  to protect  their  interests  are\r\n\r\navailable  too.  So what I would like to ask the Ministry  is\r\n\r\nwhether  there  are services that are going to  be  developed\r\n\r\nfurther to ensure that the needs of these children are  being\r\n\r\nlooked into.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unlike physical abuse, psychological abuse is an\r\n\r\narea which is very contentious\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  very  difficult to establish.  Therefore, I think  there\r\n\r\nare  likely  to  be  disputes between the  Ministry  and  the\r\n\r\nparents   in   terms   of  what  and  how   one   establishes\r\n\r\npsychological abuse.  This issue has to be looked  into  very\r\n\r\ncarefully, and I want to ask the Ministry what steps it would\r\n\r\ntake  to  ensure  that  a  case  of  psychological  abuse  is\r\n\r\nappropriately  established, and what rehabilitation  measures\r\n\r\nwill be taken to deal with psychologically abusing parents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the rehabilitation of delinquent children and\r\n\r\nyoung  persons,  it  is  important to ensure  that  the  less\r\n\r\nhardcore juvenile delinquents and young persons are separated\r\n\r\nfrom  the hardcore in institutional care and treatment.  This\r\n\r\nis  necessary  because we want to ensure that there  will  be\r\n\r\nless social contamination of those who are affected.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask the Ministry what steps it has taken to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  delinquents  who are less hardcore  are  being  treated\r\n\r\ndifferently and in different institution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the area of mobilisation of community support\r\n\r\nand implementation of community rehabilitation programmes for\r\n\r\njuvenile delinquents and young persons, I would like to  find\r\n\r\nout  from the Ministry whether there are new initiatives that\r\n\r\nare  being undertaken, because institutional care, as we  all\r\n\r\nknow,  is  very  costly,  and it is very  disruptive  to  the\r\n\r\njuveniles and young persons.  It would be the last resort, as\r\n\r\nthe Minister has put it, to institutionalise persons because,\r\n\r\nby  institutionalising  them, one breaks  them  up  from  the\r\n\r\nfamily, and family dynamics are disrupted.  Therefore, it  is\r\n\r\nvery  important  to  ensure  that  we  have  other  means  of\r\n\r\nrehabilitating young persons and juveniles within a community\r\n\r\nsetting.   So  what I want to ask the Minister  is  what  new\r\n\r\nsteps and initiatives are being undertaken to ensure that  we\r\n\r\nhave  in  place  more community rehabilitation programmes  to\r\n\r\nassist   delinquent  juveniles  and  young  persons  in   the\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou  for  allowing me to join in this debate.   Before  going\r\n\r\ninto my\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nspeech,  I  would  like to assure the hon. Member  who  spoke\r\n\r\nbefore me that I intend to heed his advice and keep my speech\r\n\r\nvery much shorter than his.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Children and Young Persons\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill moved by the Minister.  The  objectives  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  are  quite evident and worthy of  support.   Among\r\n\r\nother  things,  the Bill seeks to enhance the  protection  of\r\n\r\nchildren  and  young persons from possible ill treatment  and\r\n\r\nneglect, expand the definition of cruelty, and engage parents\r\n\r\nin  the  rehabilitation of juveniles.  As  mentioned  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  the  Bill  also introduces alternative  sentencing\r\n\r\noptions  for juvenile offenders, such as a formal caution,  a\r\n\r\nreprimand  and community service, whilst remaining  with  the\r\n\r\nfamily.  Sir, I support this approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while I support the Bill, I would like\r\n\r\nto  sound  a  note of caution and perhaps express some  minor\r\n\r\nreservations on certain clauses in the Bill which I hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  and  his  officers would  address.   However  well-intentioned  the provisions of the Bill may be,  I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould  be cautious in handling issues related to the  family\r\n\r\nand   guard  against  the  state  inadvertently  taking  over\r\n\r\nresponsibilities in the upbringing of children  that  rightly\r\n\r\nshould  be  left  with  the family.  Intervention  in  family\r\n\r\nmatters should be done only as a measure of last resort,  and\r\n\r\nI am delighted to hear the Minister share this view.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 4 of the Bill expands the definition of\r\n\r\nill  treatment to include any emotional injury.  However, the\r\n\r\nBill  is  not  quite specific in the definition of  emotional\r\n\r\ninjury, and I share Dr Vasoo's concern for this lack of clear\r\n\r\ndefinition.   There  have been cases overseas  where  parents\r\n\r\nhave  been  arrested and hauled to court for  smacking  their\r\n\r\nunruly  children  in  public.  In some  countries,  there  is\r\n\r\nreally  no  shortage of child experts who advocate  that  any\r\n\r\nform of corporal punishment on the child or a young person is\r\n\r\nan  infliction of lasting emotional injury.  It  is  my  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  implementation of this Bill will  not  lead  to  a\r\n\r\nsituation where parents can no\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlonger decide on how they should discipline their children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill amends section 10 and permits a\r\n\r\nmagistrate's   court,  upon  receiving  any  information   or\r\n\r\ncomplaint  that  a  relevant offence has  been  or  is  being\r\n\r\ncommitted  against  a child or a young  person,  to  issue  a\r\n\r\nwarrant  to  remove the victim to a place of  safety  and  to\r\n\r\nundergo medical and social assessment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not uncommon in child custody cases for\r\n\r\ncontending parties to make allegations of cruelty and neglect\r\n\r\nof  the  child  against  each other.   But  sometimes,  these\r\n\r\nallegations may be quite unfounded.  More harm may be done to\r\n\r\nthe child if he or she is forcibly removed from a stable home\r\n\r\nenvironment while investigations are being conducted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 8 of the Bill also permits the Director,\r\n\r\na  protector  or  a  police officer not  below  the  rank  of\r\n\r\nsergeant to remove a child or young person and commit him  to\r\n\r\na  place of safety, if there are reasonable grounds to do so.\r\n\r\nThe  relevant authority can do this by entering any  premises\r\n\r\nwithout  warrant and with such assistance, and by such  force\r\n\r\nas  necessary, by night or by day, in order to remove a child\r\n\r\nand commit him to a place of safety.  It is not difficult  to\r\n\r\nforesee  situations where such measures are indeed  necessary\r\n\r\nin  order  to  prevent possible harm or further  injury  from\r\n\r\noccurring to the child.  However, it is also not difficult to\r\n\r\nimagine how much more emotional damage could be inflicted  on\r\n\r\nthe  child  if  the complaints were eventually proven  to  be\r\n\r\nfalse.  There should be safeguards implemented to avoid  such\r\n\r\nsituations from arising.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the new section 3 of the Bill which\r\n\r\nclearly defines when a child or a young person is in need  of\r\n\r\ncare and protection, for example, when he is abandoned or  he\r\n\r\nhas no parent or guardian to look after him, or when he is at\r\n\r\nrisk of being ill-treated.  However, I am\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot really comfortable with the inclusion of illegal hawking,\r\n\r\ngambling and other undesirable activities as situations where\r\n\r\na  child  is in need of protection under the law.  I am  sure\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister  would  agree  that  the  definition   of\r\n\r\n\"undesirable activities\" is rather subjective and varies from\r\n\r\nindividual  to  individual.  I hope his  officials  would  be\r\n\r\njudicious  in  the interpretation of this  term  and  I  look\r\n\r\nforward  to  a  clearer definition of the  term  \"undesirable\r\n\r\nactivities\" in future amendments to the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item of business under\r\n\r\ndiscussion  be  exempted  at  this  day's  sitting  from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CHILDREN AND YOUNG PERSONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, while I agree with Dr\r\n\r\nVasoo and Mr Chong that brevity and succinctness are a virtue\r\n\r\nin  this House, I am sure they would also agree with me  that\r\n\r\nin a piece of legislation this important, at least one Member\r\n\r\ncan be allowed to make a longer speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise to speak in strong support of this Bill. It\r\n\r\nis  a  major piece of social legislation designed  to  extend\r\n\r\nprotection  to the most vulnerable in society, possibly  from\r\n\r\nthe  people that they most trust and love.  At the same time,\r\n\r\nsome  of  our young people unfortunately behave in ways  that\r\n\r\nare  damaging  both  to them and to society.   It  is  timely\r\n\r\ntherefore  that this House should address these issues  in  a\r\n\r\nthorough  manner.   With the advancement of medical  science,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in the field of psychiatry, we  are  made  more\r\n\r\naware that the emotional injuries inflicted on a child can be\r\n\r\nmore  serious  and long-lasting than even physical  injuries.\r\n\r\nThe  emotional  scars  can  even  be  transferred  to  future\r\n\r\ngenerations.  We  must  be  bold  therefore  in  setting   up\r\n\r\ninstitutions to identify those\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwho  have been subjected to abuse or mistreatment and to take\r\n\r\na  holistic  view in prescribing the remedy,  whether  it  be\r\n\r\nthrough  medical  or  psychiatric treatment,  counselling  or\r\n\r\nsocial  censure, rather than relying solely on  the  criminal\r\n\r\nsanction.   We  must also understand the causes of  deviance,\r\n\r\nand   look   for  solutions  that  will  rehabilitate   young\r\n\r\noffenders, rather than to ostracise and maroon them from  the\r\n\r\nrest of society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the legislation we are considering today embodies\r\n\r\nnovel  objectives and practical solutions.  I am all for  it.\r\n\r\nThe  point  that I made concerning the details  of  the  Bill\r\n\r\ntherefore  should  be  seen  as supporting  the  aim  of  the\r\n\r\nlegislation and to ensuring that when it comes into force, it\r\n\r\nis effective and implemented with fairness and objectivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new Bill extends a level of protection for\r\n\r\nchildren and young persons significantly.  Under the  present\r\n\r\nprovision, cruelty to children and young persons must  cause,\r\n\r\nand  I quote, \"unnecessary suffering or injury to his health,\r\n\r\nincluding injury through a loss of sight or hearing  or  limb\r\n\r\nor  organ of the body and any mental derangement\".   This  is\r\n\r\nthe  present  section  4.   This is  far  too  restrictive  a\r\n\r\nprovision  and  really  contemplates an  awful  situation  of\r\n\r\ncontinuing  abuse  resulting in serious  physical  or  mental\r\n\r\ninjury.   I therefore welcome particularly the new provisions\r\n\r\ncontained  in  clause 4 which are much wider  in  scope.   It\r\n\r\nspeaks  of parents or guardians neglecting to exercise proper\r\n\r\nsupervision  and  control, resulting in a child  or  a  young\r\n\r\nperson  falling  into  bad association or  exposed  to  moral\r\n\r\ndanger,  or  is  otherwise  beyond  control.   It  speaks  of\r\n\r\nchildren  being at risk of being ill-treated by their  parent\r\n\r\nor  guardian.   Ill-treatment is widely  defined  to  include\r\n\r\nemotional   injury  or  injury  to  the  child's  health   or\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   Development itself is widely defined  to  mean\r\n\r\nphysical,  intellectual,  emotional,  social  or  behavourial\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   Sir, these new terms vastly extend  the  scope\r\n\r\nof  the  legislation and will give rise to several  problems,\r\n\r\nquite apart from the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nopen  textured  nature  of  the words  used.   For  instance,\r\n\r\nreasonable people may disagree as to when a child may be said\r\n\r\nto  be  in  need of protection.  What does being  exposed  to\r\n\r\nmoral  danger  mean, or what is the degree of  risk  of  ill-treatment  that must be present before it would be  right  to\r\n\r\nsay that the child is in need of protection?  All these terms\r\n\r\nwould have to be interpreted and applied by those involved in\r\n\r\nenforcing  the  Act, namely, the Director of Social  Welfare,\r\n\r\nprotectors  and even police officers.  I note  especially  in\r\n\r\nclause  5,  a  police  officer of the rank  of  sergeant  can\r\n\r\nactually  take a decision to enter a home without  a  warrant\r\n\r\nand  remove  a child alleged to be at risk.  My question  is:\r\n\r\nare  police  officers  trained for this sort  of  assessment?\r\n\r\nIndeed, are any of the persons involved trained to assess the\r\n\r\nwider criteria that are now stipulated?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that matter, if I were to ask Members present in\r\n\r\nthis House today to give their views as to what is the degree\r\n\r\nof  risk  that would be necessary before it is legitimate  to\r\n\r\nintervene,  I believe we would not find a general  consensus.\r\n\r\nSome  may  say  that  there needs to be a clear  and  present\r\n\r\ndanger  of  ill-treatment, others may put it  less  strongly.\r\n\r\nThe point is there is likely to be as many interpretations of\r\n\r\nthe degree of risk as there are people asked to interpret it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe therefore that much needs to be done,\r\n\r\neven if this Bill were to pass through today.  There must  be\r\n\r\na serious attempt to set out clear guidelines as to how these\r\n\r\nnew  provisions  are to be interpreted and applied.   Without\r\n\r\nsuch  guidelines, I worry that parents and guardians  may  be\r\n\r\nwrongly subjected to investigations which may, in turn,  give\r\n\r\nrise to undeserved social ostracism or misunderstanding.   In\r\n\r\nour  society, where family values are so enshrined, it  would\r\n\r\nbe  particularly reprehensible for a parent or guardian to be\r\n\r\nwrongly accused of ill-treating his child.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must therefore ask the Minister what are the steps\r\n\r\nthat  his Ministry would take to ensure that in no case would\r\n\r\nthere be precipitous action by some over-zealous\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nofficials  and that each case would carefully and quickly  be\r\n\r\nreviewed before action is taken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the concern is even stronger when we realise that\r\n\r\nthose  who  provide the information on alleged  ill-treatment\r\n\r\nare  specially protected under the proposed legislation.  The\r\n\r\nidentity of these informers cannot be revealed even in court.\r\n\r\nThose who inform cannot through their actions be regarded  as\r\n\r\nhaving breached any code of ethics or professional etiquette.\r\n\r\nIf  he or she acted in good faith, there will be no civil  or\r\n\r\ncriminal  liability.  These are pretty strong  provisions  to\r\n\r\nprotect  informers.  While I can see justification, in  terms\r\n\r\nof  public policy, for protecting identity so given, I am not\r\n\r\nconvinced  that  such protection should  be  given  when  the\r\n\r\ninformer  was found to be malicious or acting in his  or  her\r\n\r\nown self-interest, or for some other undesirable motive.   As\r\n\r\nthe  provision now stands, no witness who knows the  identity\r\n\r\nof the informer, can be compelled to disclose the identity of\r\n\r\nthe informer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like the Minister to confirm that this\r\n\r\nprovision  in  the  new section 84A(4) would  not  prevent  a\r\n\r\nwilling  witness,  who  knows the informer's  identity,  from\r\n\r\ndisclosing  the  identity of the informer.  This  measure  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to ensure that there should be some accountability\r\n\r\non  the  part  of informers.  Good public policy  requires  a\r\n\r\nbalance  between  protecting the  young  and  protecting  the\r\n\r\ninnocent.  In other words, we should ensure at all times that\r\n\r\nthere  should  be  as  small a number as  possible  of  false\r\n\r\naccusations of ill-treatment.  There should be no  protection\r\n\r\nfor  those  who  falsely  accuse  another,  particularly   in\r\n\r\nrelation to ill-treatment of their own children.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>3.57 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I turn now to treatment for juvenile offenders. It\r\n\r\nis a sad fact that in today's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworld, crimes, including serious crimes, are no longer solely\r\n\r\nin  the  domain of the adult. Therefore, the Bill is  clearly\r\n\r\nright in focusing on the reformation or rehabilitation of the\r\n\r\nyouthful  offender, rather than on straightforward punishment\r\n\r\nin  the form of deterrent sentences or incarceration.  It  is\r\n\r\nalso  in  the  right  direction when it seeks  to  involve  a\r\n\r\ngreater  number of orders that the Juvenile Court  can  make,\r\n\r\nincluding  requiring the young person and parent  to  undergo\r\n\r\npsychotherapy or other counselling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, in clause 20, the Bill introduces a new\r\n\r\ninstitution  in relation to the treatment of young  offenders\r\n\r\nand  child  offenders.   This is the convening  of  a  family\r\n\r\nconference and provides in the new section 44A, a  series  of\r\n\r\nmeasures  that  a  family conference may take  to  deal  with\r\n\r\noffenders.    These  include  a simple  reprimand  or  formal\r\n\r\ncaution to requiring the offender to pay compensation  or  to\r\n\r\nperform  community service.  It can also require the offender\r\n\r\nto  apologise  to the victim.  I think now we all  understand\r\n\r\nthat  the  word  \"apologise\" means that saying \"sorry\"  would\r\n\r\ndefinitely not be enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is this. There is no description of what a\r\n\r\nfamily conference is, let alone a definition.  One can deduce\r\n\r\nfrom the provision that family members of the offender may be\r\n\r\nincluded, even though there is no requirement that they  must\r\n\r\nattend. There is no indication as to who else might be in the\r\n\r\nconference or who should chair it or whether it should have a\r\n\r\nchairman  at  all.   Sir,  given that the  family  conference\r\n\r\nappears  to be acting in a quasi judicial capacity,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  know  why  its  nature  and  composition  are   not\r\n\r\nspecifically  provided for in the Bill.  It is  strange  that\r\n\r\nits powers are set out in such detail, but not its nature  or\r\n\r\ncomposition.   Neither is it clear how it would  conduct  its\r\n\r\nproceedings,  or  whether it is possible to  have  a  further\r\n\r\nappeal   against  the  decision  of  the  family  conference,\r\n\r\nassuming  that  it  does  not need to  be  unanimous  in  its\r\n\r\ndecision-making.   May  I  ask the Minister  to  clarify  the\r\n\r\nissues relating to the family conference that I have raised?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is ambitious in scope and intent.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems to require also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na serious commitment of additional resources to implement it.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to ask the Minister what additional  resources\r\n\r\nare available to implement all these new measures. Will there\r\n\r\nbe  more child psychiatrists?  How many are available now and\r\n\r\nhow  many more will be needed?  Are Juvenile Court judges  or\r\n\r\nsocial workers equipped to handle such cases?  The Bill seems\r\n\r\nto  place  great reliance on doctors who may, of  course,  be\r\n\r\nequipped  very well to deal with physical injuries,  but  are\r\n\r\nthey    equally   knowledgeable   about   child   psychiatry?\r\n\r\nEssentially,  are we ready to implement the Bill's  extensive\r\n\r\nprovisions?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we consider the Bill today, I am reminded to\r\n\r\ncall  it  the Children and Young Persons Charter in  that  it\r\n\r\nseeks extensively to protect children and young persons  from\r\n\r\nall  sorts of abuse.  It reminds me of the other charter, the\r\n\r\nWomen's  Charter, and I wonder whether it is really not  time\r\n\r\nto  bring  the two charters together into one family charter.\r\n\r\nThat  should be what we should be driving at.  The  value  of\r\n\r\nthe family is central, it is fundamental to Singapore, it  is\r\n\r\nrecognised  in the S21 report.  We should try  to  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat we have a family charter providing for the protection of\r\n\r\nchildren  or  rehabilitation of young offenders and  also  of\r\n\r\ncourse of women.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I reiterate again my support for this Bill and hope\r\n\r\nthat its coming into force will ensure that more children and\r\n\r\nyoung people will sleep better at night.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nagainst  the backdrop of enhanced powers being given  to  the\r\n\r\nstate,  institutions  and officers in passing  judgement  and\r\n\r\ndirectly impacting the lives of family members, I would  like\r\n\r\nto  raise  my concerns and seek the Minister's clarification.\r\n\r\nLike  what  Prof.  Chin said, on matters as  important  as  a\r\n\r\nlegislation related to the children and their families  which\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  and  AG's Chambers had  taken  four  years  to\r\n\r\ndeliberate on, it is not discharging my due diligence not  to\r\n\r\nraise  my concerns, even though it would take longer than  my\r\n\r\nprevious colleagues.  Sir, I seek your indulgence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on some jurisdictional points in clause 33.\r\n\r\nUnder the current Act, a \"child\" is defined as below 14 years\r\n\r\nof  age.  A \"young person\" is between the ages of 14 and  16.\r\n\r\nAny  young person 16 or older will be tried at the High Court\r\n\r\nor  District  Court, except in those cases where  the  public\r\n\r\nprosecutor decides to try the offence in the Juvenile  Court.\r\n\r\nMy  question is:  is the age of the offender when the offence\r\n\r\nis  committed the determining one to decide which  court  the\r\n\r\noffender  should be judged in, or is his age during the  time\r\n\r\nof  the hearing a determining one?  The Bill is unclear,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore may be unfair,  given the differences in sentencing\r\n\r\noptions  in  both courts.  For example, if a child  or  young\r\n\r\nperson committed an offence when he/she was 15 but turned  16\r\n\r\nby  the  time  the child was brought before the court,  would\r\n\r\nthis  child  go before the Juvenile Court or the District  or\r\n\r\nHigh Court?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the age of the offender at the point of the\r\n\r\ncommission  of  the  alleged offence must  be  a  determining\r\n\r\nfactor in directing which court the offender should be  tried\r\n\r\nin, and this must not be left to the discretion of the public\r\n\r\nprosecutor  who  has  the difficult  task  of  balancing  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the State against the interests of  the  child.\r\n\r\nIn  the event that a child is brought before the District  or\r\n\r\nHigh  Court,  perhaps  it  should  be  the  offender's  legal\r\n\r\nrepresentative, instead of the public prosecutor, who  should\r\n\r\napply  for the case to be tried in the Juvenile Court, as  he\r\n\r\nwould  know  the  offender better and would be  in  a  better\r\n\r\nposition to act in the interest of the child.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, my concern is on what constitutes an \"emotional\r\n\r\ninjury\".   While emotional abuse is a common  form  of  abuse\r\n\r\nwhich  must  be  stopped  to prevent it  from  escalating  to\r\n\r\nphysical  battery and from causing more damage to  the  self-esteem of the  child, I wonder how, in the complexity of  the\r\n\r\ndiverse parenting styles which different families adopt,  our\r\n\r\nenforcement  officers  would be able to  determine  cases  of\r\n\r\nemotional abuse.  My concern is that the application  of  the\r\n\r\nstandards  in  determining \"emotional injury\"  is  a  largely\r\n\r\nsubjective exercise.  Are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nparents who push their children very hard during examinations\r\n\r\nby  locking  them up to study and depriving them of  leisure,\r\n\r\nfood and drinks, emotionally abusing them?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, if caning is accepted by some parents and\r\n\r\nschool   teachers  who  believe  it  is  a   positive   child\r\n\r\ndisciplinary measure, is it consistent that we now  introduce\r\n\r\na  \"softer\"  standard  of \"emotional abuse\",  stating  verbal\r\n\r\nabuse  as an offence under the Act, whilst the affliction  of\r\n\r\nphysical  punishment by the cane on the body of  a  child  is\r\n\r\nnot?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seek the Minister's views on how he reconciles the use\r\n\r\nof the cane against the sanction of a foul or harsh word that\r\n\r\nupsets  the  child.   How  then can we convincingly  persuade\r\n\r\nparents to accept the judgment made by the Director or his or\r\n\r\nher  officer that they have committed an offence of emotional\r\n\r\nabuse  when  all around them there is more violent  behaviour\r\n\r\nthat is being sanctioned?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could we consider substituting the words \"emotional\r\n\r\ninjury\"  with  \"psychological abuse  or  injury\"?   Dr  Vasoo\r\n\r\nearlier on had not made a distinction between the two  words.\r\n\r\nI  feel  that  \"psychological abuse\" is  a  more  appropriate\r\n\r\nstandard  to  be  applied,  as it  can  be  substantiated  by\r\n\r\nprofessional medical opinion regarding the impact of parental\r\n\r\nabuses on the mental health of the child.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third concern is on insufficient checks and balances\r\n\r\non the powers of the Director.   The police officer above the\r\n\r\nrank  of  sergeant,  the  approved welfare  officer  and  the\r\n\r\nDirector  would now be empowered to effectively pass judgment\r\n\r\non  parents  whom  they feel are \"unlikely or  unwilling\"  in\r\n\r\nclause  3(d)(ii), or \"unable or unwilling\" in clause  3(f)(i)\r\n\r\nto  protect the child from ill-treatment, or are \"believed to\r\n\r\nhave  committed  the offence\".  Such broad powers  being  now\r\n\r\ngiven  to  officers to intervene and make moral judgments  on\r\n\r\nthe  competence of parents are both a welcome  initiative  as\r\n\r\nwell as a disconcerting one.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The welcome part is that the designated officers have\r\n\r\nbroader  scope to quickly make decisions on how the child  or\r\n\r\nyoung  person  is  to be taken care of, whether  this  be  by\r\n\r\nremoval to an approved home, provided in Part VIA, clause 66,\r\n\r\nor to undergo a medical examination, in new section 71A, etc.\r\n\r\nAll this is done without the paralysing fear of their actions\r\n\r\ninviting legal repercussions against themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disconcerting part arises from the fact that these\r\n\r\nare  serious  decisions, because they  involve  the  physical\r\n\r\nremoval  of  children from homes which, no  doubt,  would  be\r\n\r\nupsetting  to family units.  Even though I believe  that  the\r\n\r\nDirector and his/her officers would be carefully selected and\r\n\r\nwould  most  likely carry out their official duties  in  good\r\n\r\nfaith,  an  inescapable  query  is  who  then  \"directs\"  the\r\n\r\nDirector  and  scrutinizes  his  or  her  decisions  and  the\r\n\r\ndecisions of his or her officers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have to accept that someone has to be given the\r\n\r\nauthority to pass judgment on our parenting methods, must  we\r\n\r\nalso  accept  that  no  body  of  governance  is  set  up  to\r\n\r\nscrutinize  his or her decisions?  What if the judgment  call\r\n\r\nis erroneous?  The Bill is silent on providing some mechanism\r\n\r\nof  accountability on the powers of the Director and  his  or\r\n\r\nher officers in exercising the discretion afforded them under\r\n\r\nthis Bill.  Instead, the Bill protects them from any personal\r\n\r\nliability  and no suit or other legal proceedings  shall  lie\r\n\r\npersonally   against  the  Director  and   other   protection\r\n\r\nofficers, as provided in Part VIII, clause 84.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realise that this is a difficult balance that the law\r\n\r\nis  being  asked to take here in empowering the Director  and\r\n\r\nhis or her officers on the one hand, and preventing abuse  by\r\n\r\nthese  same  empowered people on the other.   Either  extreme\r\n\r\nwould  be  unacceptable, as it would mean  either  injury  or\r\n\r\ninaction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I hope the Minister can assure me that\r\n\r\nthese  officers  are  qualified  by  training  to  carry  out\r\n\r\nprofessional assessment work and that their judgment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  be  subjected  to experts in the  medical  and  service\r\n\r\ndelivery, including community advocates like informed parents\r\n\r\nand  teachers.  I will be even more confident if a  board  of\r\n\r\ngovernance  can  be  set  up  eventually  to  maintain   high\r\n\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth point is regarding placing children at a place\r\n\r\nof safety.  The Bill in new section 8 provides broader powers\r\n\r\nfor  designated  officers to take a  victim  to  a  place  of\r\n\r\nsafety,  but it does not provide indicators to determine  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  duration and when the offender may be released  from\r\n\r\nthe   approved  home  or  school.   I  acknowledge  that  the\r\n\r\nprobation officers probably know better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to explore a new school of thought which\r\n\r\nargues  that  incarceration of children away  from  home  and\r\n\r\nfamily  constitutes a form of institutional abuse,  and  does\r\n\r\nnot  contribute to the recovery or rehabilitation of children\r\n\r\nand  their  families.  I hope the Ministry will examine  this\r\n\r\nperspective and propose as part of sentencing options a live-in  therapy period, whereby expert facilitators explore  with\r\n\r\nfamily members new ways of relating to one another in  a  new\r\n\r\nand  more  loving  way.   This model is  already  adopted  in\r\n\r\nseveral countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to emphasise that I appreciate that child\r\n\r\nprotection  management  is a complex and  difficult  call  of\r\n\r\nduty.   Officers have to contend with the wishes  of  parents\r\n\r\nwho  feel it is their right to deal with their children their\r\n\r\nway.  How we balance this inalienable duty with the rights of\r\n\r\nthe  parents against the interest of a defenceless  child  is\r\n\r\nunderstandably   the   most   heart-rending   and   difficult\r\n\r\nchallenges  which  our  child  protection  officers  have  to\r\n\r\ndelicately  deal  with, and very often  under  conditions  of\r\n\r\ntremendous  duress and humiliating assaults  from  angry  and\r\n\r\naggressive  guardians.  The job of child protection  officers\r\n\r\nis  admirable,  but unenviable.  I hope more recognition  and\r\n\r\ntraining  opportunities  can  be  given  to  motivate   these\r\n\r\nofficers to undertake this difficult challenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to one more disturbing point. Sir, for\r\n\r\nthose parents who have no\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmoney  to find help for their physically or mentally disabled\r\n\r\nchildren  and yet have to work, sometimes two shifts  a  day,\r\n\r\nare  they  committing  an offence when  they  lock  up  their\r\n\r\nchildren  in  rooms  and  let them  defecate  and  scream  in\r\n\r\nprivate?   As  there are insufficient public institutions  to\r\n\r\ntake in severely mentally handicapped children who are forced\r\n\r\nto  be  tied down at home and languish their time away  while\r\n\r\nthe adults are at work, is this a form of child abuse and who\r\n\r\nis responsible for this crime?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are tough issues but in the context of\r\n\r\narguing  for  care  and  protection  of  children  and  young\r\n\r\npersons,  the  disabled community and their concerns  form  a\r\n\r\ncritical  focus.  Parental neglect in these cases  is  beyond\r\n\r\nthe  parents'  control, because they do not have  the  money,\r\n\r\ntime  and energy to cope with these difficult cases.  I  hope\r\n\r\nwhen  the Director exercises his or her judgment, the  socio-economic   status   of  the  parents  can   be   taken   into\r\n\r\nconsideration  before judgment is passed.  I hope  there  are\r\n\r\nfinancial  schemes  being  set  up  to  support  services  to\r\n\r\nchildren  who have to be committed to the homes when  parents\r\n\r\ncannot afford to pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the more moderate cases of mentally challenged adults\r\n\r\nwho are chronologically 16 or 18 years old, but have an IQ of\r\n\r\na child of 6, how do we handle their public offences, such as\r\n\r\nshoplifting  and touching the opposite sex?   As  they  acted\r\n\r\nwithout understanding and an intention to hurt, which of  the\r\n\r\nlegal   instruments  relating  to  young   persons   can   be\r\n\r\njudiciously  applied to these offenders with  special  needs?\r\n\r\nWith  this Bill, the parents are held responsible and  become\r\n\r\nthe  offender  for not supervising their child in  the  first\r\n\r\nplace.  Is this an appropriate judicial response?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry will review the portfolio of legal\r\n\r\nsanctions relating to offences committed by the disabled  and\r\n\r\nassess if they are adequate in exercising care and protection\r\n\r\nover this community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me shift the focus to parents who neglect their\r\n\r\nchildren.   There  are  two wonderful words  in  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhich, in my view, summarise a perspective on parenting.  The\r\n\r\nwords  are guan jiao (??), meaning to supervise and to teach;\r\n\r\nand  jiao dao (??), meaning to teach and to guide or lead  by\r\n\r\nexample.   Parents are not supervising nor are they  teaching\r\n\r\nand guiding their children, because they do not have the time\r\n\r\nor  they conveniently think it is the job of the schools;  or\r\n\r\nthey may be disciplining their children with the cane without\r\n\r\nteaching and guiding them, so that children do not understand\r\n\r\nthe mistakes they have made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More often than not, parents just simply do not know how\r\n\r\nto  parent,  and as inadequate parents and poor role  models,\r\n\r\nthey  simply  are  too  afraid  of  losing  their  children's\r\n\r\naffection.  So they fail to discipline, reprimand, guide  and\r\n\r\nteach.  \"Neglect\",  which is an offence  in  this  Bill,  can\r\n\r\nsimply mean being unable or disable in the role of parenting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where the new sections of the Bill, sections\r\n\r\n44A,  44B  as  well  as 49A, appear the most  refreshing  and\r\n\r\ninnovative.   By providing additional sentencing options  for\r\n\r\njuvenile offenders, such as family conferencing and community\r\n\r\nservices,  and by ordering mandatory counselling for  parents\r\n\r\nwho  have  to  pay for assessment and treatment  services  of\r\n\r\noffenders  under  their  charge, the State  is  signalling  a\r\n\r\nfundamental   judicial  perspective  in  upholding   parental\r\n\r\ncooperation   and  responsibility  in  the   protection   and\r\n\r\ntreatment  of  their  children.   This  initiative  I   fully\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final query is why is there no mandatory reporting by\r\n\r\ndoctors, neighbours or other persons to report CYPA offences?\r\n\r\nThe lack of service delivery infrastructure arising from high\r\n\r\nlevel reporting and a sense of invasion of family privacy  by\r\n\r\nirresponsible  gossip  mongers  are  two  frequently   raised\r\n\r\nobjections to legislating mandatory reporting.  These are not\r\n\r\ngood  enough  reasons,  Sir, because  we  are  talking  about\r\n\r\nprotection of lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent speech made by the Minister, he reported a\r\n\r\nhigh incidence of reporting\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  consultation by professionals who did  not  hesitate  to\r\n\r\nreport  suspected child abuse cases to relevant  authorities.\r\n\r\nIf   this   is  so,  will  it  not  augur  well  for   social\r\n\r\nresponsibility in Singapore to fix a legislation on mandatory\r\n\r\nreporting  among  institutional professionals  like  doctors,\r\n\r\nnurses,  medical social workers, to signal a  zero  tolerance\r\n\r\nthreshold on violence against children?  Especially since  in\r\n\r\nthe  amendments,  the  Minister has also  made  provision  to\r\n\r\nprotect  socially responsible citizens from  civil  suits  if\r\n\r\nthey act in good faith to report suspected child abuse.  Like\r\n\r\nthe Minister himself said, it is better to err on the side of\r\n\r\ncaution  than  to let a child suffer.  I seek the  Minister's\r\n\r\nresponse on why this legislation leans against imposing  such\r\n\r\na duty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the whole, the legal framework, as proposed in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  is  comprehensive  enough  to  allow  front-line\r\n\r\nofficers the discretion to intervene early to prevent further\r\n\r\ninjury to the child and young person.  In order that the  law\r\n\r\nbe  properly enforced on the ground, it is critical that  the\r\n\r\nresponsible Ministries, critically MCDS, MHA, MOE, MOH,  have\r\n\r\nsufficiently comprehensive and coherent guidelines with which\r\n\r\nto follow through on orders made by the courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to learn that following the formation of the\r\n\r\nInter-Ministry Committee on the Management of Child Abuse  in\r\n\r\nJanuary 1997, numerous initiatives were undertaken by MCDS in\r\n\r\nthis direction: the launches of the manual for management  of\r\n\r\nchild  abuse  in  July 1999 by MCDS, an abridged  manual  for\r\n\r\nProfessionals and Service Providers Working with Children and\r\n\r\na public education booklet \"Love Our Children - Prevent Child\r\n\r\nAbuse\" in February 2001 - the booklets are here [indicating],\r\n\r\nvery  colourful  and child-friendly; as well as  this  manual\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been told to me that it has been very helpful  to\r\n\r\nservice  providers - and the recent Child Protection Link  in\r\n\r\nMarch  this  year  which  is a networking  platform  for  key\r\n\r\nMinistries' officials involved in child protection work.  All\r\n\r\nthese  are  positive  initiatives.  The Ministry  has  indeed\r\n\r\nworked very hard in the last four years.  Thank you, Minister\r\n\r\nand your dedicated\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nofficers.    We   need   to  continue   now   to   strengthen\r\n\r\ncollaborative  training and public education  programmes  for\r\n\r\nall  involved  in  child protection work  to  enhance  skills\r\n\r\nlevels and greater communication between agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a broader level, what we need is a positive child-friendly environment at home, in school and within the\r\n\r\ncommunity.   What we need to do more is to help  families  in\r\n\r\ntrouble.   This  Bill  has kick-started a  central  focus  on\r\n\r\nsafeguarding  the  welfare of children and responsibility  of\r\n\r\nthe family, which in a resource-scarce Singapore state and in\r\n\r\nview  of  our  declining  fertility rate  matched  against  a\r\n\r\nrapidly ageing population, are significant social pillars  in\r\n\r\nshaping our sustainability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that basis, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, at least family members are now drawn in the\r\n\r\nprocess.   With  this amendment, a parent or  guardian  of  a\r\n\r\nchild  can be made to undergo counselling, psychotherapy  and\r\n\r\nother  programmes  or activities.  Also, the  Bill  seeks  to\r\n\r\nwiden  the  scope  of  punishment where more  meaningful  and\r\n\r\nappropriate  punishment can be meted out.   I  see  that  the\r\n\r\ncourt  can prescribe shorter detention, such as over weekends\r\n\r\nor  even  to  require  supervision  of  the  offenders  under\r\n\r\nprobation.    New  section  44,  which  will  allow   younger\r\n\r\noffenders  to  be  sent to the reformative  training  centre,\r\n\r\ntakes  cognisance  that  there are unfortunately  very  young\r\n\r\noffenders who have the capacity for extreme violence and  are\r\n\r\nrecalcitrant in their acts of violence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there are many good points in the Bill. Like\r\n\r\nearlier speakers have pointed out, we need to refine and work\r\n\r\nout  some  definitions.  But while it is going on,  I  recall\r\n\r\nhorror stories that are published in the press of child being\r\n\r\nabused,  and  I am glad that new section 8 will allow  prompt\r\n\r\naction  to be taken where there is reasonable ground  that  a\r\n\r\nchild or young person\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis in need of care and protection.  Prompt action is the only\r\n\r\nthing  that will prevent further damage being done, whilst  I\r\n\r\nacknowledge   earlier  speakers'  concern  that   there   are\r\n\r\ndefinitions to be worked out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also happy to see that new sections 84 and 84A will\r\n\r\nprovide  protection from suit or other legal  proceedings  to\r\n\r\nthe  enforcer  and  witness.  Without such  protection  being\r\n\r\noffered, I can envisage that people will be reluctant to be a\r\n\r\nnotifier  and pretend not to notice what is going on.   Also,\r\n\r\nenforcers will be hesitant to take prompt action if they  are\r\n\r\nbeing  constantly  bombarded with harassment  and  stress  of\r\n\r\nsuits and other legal proceedings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like the amendments to the Bill but I have one major\r\n\r\nreservation, and this has to do with new section  35  on  the\r\n\r\nrestriction  of  publication of information relating  to  the\r\n\r\nproceedings  involving  children  and  young  persons.   This\r\n\r\nsection  is  there to protect the identity of a  child  or  a\r\n\r\nyoung  person.   I  am surprised that the  punishment  for  a\r\n\r\nbreach  of  this section is a mere fine not exceeding  $2,000\r\n\r\nfor  a  first offence and a fine not exceeding $10,000 for  a\r\n\r\nsecond  or subsequent offence.  Such sums are pocket expenses\r\n\r\nfor  the  media.   Besides,  we  should  expect  the  highest\r\n\r\nstandard of governance on the part of the media and a  breach\r\n\r\nof  section  35 must not be tolerated.  In my  mind,  such  a\r\n\r\nbreach  could  not be accidental.  It must be deliberate  and\r\n\r\nthe fines should be at least $100,000 for a first offence and\r\n\r\neven  more  for  subsequent offences with  a  possibility  of\r\n\r\nimprisonment.  How does one value the damage done to a child?\r\n\r\nCould the article be used in the future against the child who\r\n\r\nhas made good and is successful in society?  Could it destroy\r\n\r\nthe  prospect of a child succeeding in life?  Could it  be  a\r\n\r\nfuture  source  of blackmail?  The offender would  have  been\r\n\r\nfined  $2,000  or $10,000 which will probably be  covered  by\r\n\r\nincreased subscription and advertising revenues for  being  a\r\n\r\nsensational press.  I urge the Minister to increase the fines\r\n\r\nproposed  under  this section to one that is truly  punishing\r\n\r\nand not offsettable by any commercial gains from the act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I would like to thank Members\r\n\r\nfor their contributions and strong support for the Bill which\r\n\r\nis  very  timely.  We need these amendments  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nprotection of our children and young persons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, first, address the general concern about\r\n\r\ndefinitions and assessments, and whether or not we are trying\r\n\r\nto  judge or take over the parents' role of how they ought to\r\n\r\nlook  after their children.  Sir, we at the Ministry are very\r\n\r\nconcerned  about these too.  We have thought  long  and  hard\r\n\r\nabout how we define things, how do we ascertain that whatever\r\n\r\nwe  are  doing is correct, what do we know about what  people\r\n\r\nthink of their children and how they ought to be dealing with\r\n\r\ntheir children.  So we are very aware of the difficulties  of\r\n\r\ndefinitions,   coverage,   assessment   and   abuse.     But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  it  is inherent in the  issues  that  we  are\r\n\r\ntalking  about.  We are talking about relationships,  we  are\r\n\r\ntalking about the psychological condition of a person.  These\r\n\r\nare  things which are difficult to really put your finger  on\r\n\r\nand truly measure them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So where do you draw the line? Where do you draw the\r\n\r\nline  between  abuse and discipline?  Where do you  draw  the\r\n\r\nline between what is accidental and what is wilful?  Where do\r\n\r\nyou  draw the line between what is private good and  what  is\r\n\r\npublic good?  And where do you draw the line whether it is in\r\n\r\nthe  interest of the child or in the interest of  the  family\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  talking about?  These are questions  which  we\r\n\r\nagonise over and, indeed, it took us long and hard to  really\r\n\r\nfind  the answers.  But, nevertheless, Sir, the line must  be\r\n\r\ndrawn.   We  cannot  not  draw the line  simply  because  our\r\n\r\nfailure  to do so will mean that there would be children  out\r\n\r\nthere  who  are damaged by the actions of either  parents  or\r\n\r\nrelatives   who   abuse   them  either   psychologically   or\r\n\r\nphysically.  So the line must be drawn.  But what we can  do,\r\n\r\nSir,  is to minimise the subjectivity and sharpen the ability\r\n\r\nfor  us  to assess correctly what ought to be done  and  what\r\n\r\nshould be done for the child.  Therefore, we tilt towards the\r\n\r\ninterest of the child.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how do we go about trying to minimise the\r\n\r\nsubjectivity, if at all, in the issues?  One is to make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  we approach the problem holistically.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nwe  look  at  each  issue in context,  from  all  angles  and\r\n\r\nperspectives  - individual differences, cultural differences,\r\n\r\nnorms.  We take all these into consideration and we make sure\r\n\r\nthat we cover all angles, as it were, by making sure that  we\r\n\r\ninclude   all   professions,  all  expertise,   all   experts\r\n\r\n(psychologists,   psychiatrists,  doctors,  social   workers,\r\n\r\nteachers,  community leaders).  We have an inter-disciplinary\r\n\r\nand  inter-agency approach towards assessment so that we  get\r\n\r\nas  wide  a variety of minds to bear on the problems  and  as\r\n\r\nmany experts to bear on the problems that we have in mind and\r\n\r\nat  issue.   And  we  also  have  protocols,  guidelines  and\r\n\r\nprocedures  which my officers follow stringently  because  we\r\n\r\nknow  that  if  we make a wrong decision, our decision  would\r\n\r\nmean  that  a  child may bear the scars of  what  he  or  she\r\n\r\nsuffers during childhood right up to adulthood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we are very well aware of the problems that Members\r\n\r\nhave   raised  in  terms  of  subjectivity,  sharpening   our\r\n\r\nassessment, and in terms of whether we are doing  it  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the child, the family or the community.  So  that\r\n\r\nis, in general, Sir, what I would like to respond in terms of\r\n\r\nthe  fears and concerns about subjectivity of the issues that\r\n\r\nare involved in child abuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now go to specific questions and comments from\r\n\r\nMembers.   For  example, Prof. Chin asked  what  we  mean  by\r\n\r\nfamily conferencing.  The word \"family\", I think, here  is  a\r\n\r\nbit  of  a misnomer because it really does not mean only  the\r\n\r\nfamily  is involved, but it includes significant others  too.\r\n\r\nIt involves relatives, it involves those who are victims of a\r\n\r\nchild's  offending  behaviour.  This family  conferencing  is\r\n\r\npart  of  the  judicial process.  In other words,  it  is  an\r\n\r\noption  during  the  case discussion, before  the  magistrate\r\n\r\npasses sentence, and it brings together those people who  are\r\n\r\naffected by the juvenile's offending behaviour and this  will\r\n\r\ninclude  the  offender, his or her parent  or  guardian,  the\r\n\r\nvictim, victim's family, and we have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  family conferencing facilitator, an expert at facilitating\r\n\r\nand mediating such meetings.  Through this mediation process,\r\n\r\na  family conference attempts to reach a consensus on what is\r\n\r\nthe most appropriate way an offender can make reparations for\r\n\r\nhis or her offending actions.  The goal of the conference  is\r\n\r\nfor  the  juvenile  to  realise the  impact  of  his  or  her\r\n\r\noffending  behaviour or to express contrition to  the  victim\r\n\r\nand  his  or her family.  The facilitators of this conference\r\n\r\nare selected based on their broad abilities to understand the\r\n\r\nprocesses   of   the   juvenile  court   and   the   juvenile\r\n\r\nrehabilitation   process  as  well   as   their   skills   in\r\n\r\nfacilitating such meetings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the question of jurisdiction of those below 16\r\n\r\nyears  old.   Mdm Claire Chiang asked about the  jurisdiction\r\n\r\nfor  hearings of cases involving those who are below  16  and\r\n\r\nwhether the system is fair in hearing the child and in meting\r\n\r\nout  sentence.   Sir,  the system that  we  have  now  is  an\r\n\r\nefficient  and restorative one and it ensures that the  young\r\n\r\nperson  who is about to turn 16 or who is below 16  is  given\r\n\r\nthe  priority to be heard in the juvenile system.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  we  try  as much as possible and, indeed,  given  the\r\n\r\nefficiency of our courts, such children will be heard in  the\r\n\r\njuvenile system.  The Act provides for such cases to continue\r\n\r\nto  be heard in the juvenile court even after the child turns\r\n\r\nover  16.   All efforts will be made to expedite his  or  her\r\n\r\nhearing  so  that  the principle which governs  the  juvenile\r\n\r\ncourt is extended to young persons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang also asked how do we know that the\r\n\r\nchild  is  to  be released and who is going to determine  the\r\n\r\nchild is to be released.  Sir, this depends very much on  the\r\n\r\nprogress that the youths make during their rehabilitation and\r\n\r\nalso the circumstances of their families.  Our policy is  not\r\n\r\nto  keep  youths in institutional setting.  That is the  last\r\n\r\nthing  we  want to do.  In my speech just now,  I  reiterated\r\n\r\nthat institutionalisation is the last resort.  But while  the\r\n\r\npolicy  is not to keep these youths in institutional  setting\r\n\r\nlonger  than  necessary, we need to strike a balance  between\r\n\r\nwhat is public safety and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not the young person is ready to return  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity and to his or her family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a multi-disciplinary team, comprising\r\n\r\npsychologists, social workers and vocational instructors,  to\r\n\r\nlook  into  the different needs of each resident.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthere  is a committee, there is a group of people.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nas  a  principle, we have groups of experts rather  than  one\r\n\r\nindividual  person  trying to determine whether  or  not  the\r\n\r\njuvenile  ought  to be released or what kind  of  punishment,\r\n\r\npenalty or option which has to be imposed on a child.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked whether we have enough professionals to\r\n\r\naccommodate  the  changes that we  have  made.   Indeed,  the\r\n\r\nchanges  are very comprehensive, and this is in fact  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  biggest changes that we have made to the CYPA.   We  too\r\n\r\nare  very  concerned whether we have enough people.   We  are\r\n\r\nstill  trying to produce enough psychologists, social workers\r\n\r\nand psychiatrists.  Right now, we use both the expertise that\r\n\r\nwe  have  in  Government and also in the private sector.   In\r\n\r\nother  words, we also marshal the expertise - doctors, social\r\n\r\nworkers  - in the private sector to assess and also  help  us\r\n\r\nunderstand the cases that we have.  But, certainly, we  would\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  train  people.  We have, for  example,  engaged\r\n\r\ntrainers  from  the  National Society for the  Prevention  of\r\n\r\nCruelty  to  Children,  which is  based  in  UK,  to  provide\r\n\r\nprofessional  training to our child protection officers.   We\r\n\r\nalso have joint training conducted with the agencies, such as\r\n\r\nthe  police  and medical social workers, to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\ninter-agency system is sufficient and work in the interest of\r\n\r\nchildren.   We are also working with the various agencies  to\r\n\r\nsecure   the  additional  manpower  and  resources   to   run\r\n\r\nadditional programmes.  And we are also tapping the  manpower\r\n\r\nand  resources  in  the voluntary welfare  organisations,  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  psychiatrists and psychologists, to provide  these\r\n\r\nspecialised services for the programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked whether we ought not to merge the CYPA\r\n\r\nand also the Women's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCharter.   Sir,  the  purpose of the  CYPA  and  the  Women's\r\n\r\nCharter is different in the sense that the CYPA is to protect\r\n\r\nvulnerable and dependent children, the young persons who  are\r\n\r\nat  risk  of  abuse or have been abused and they cover  young\r\n\r\npersons  between the ages of 14 and 16.  Whereas the  Women's\r\n\r\nCharter provides for the protection of women and girls  below\r\n\r\n21  years who are in moral danger.  So they are two different\r\n\r\npieces  of legislation which cover two different sections  of\r\n\r\nthe  population.   But I do concede that, at  some  point  in\r\n\r\ntime,  perhaps we could consider merging these two pieces  of\r\n\r\nlegislation and also other legislation on family  issues  and\r\n\r\nfamily matters.  We have not abandoned that idea.  This is an\r\n\r\nidea which we could pursue later when the time is ripe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of safeguards against malicious\r\n\r\ncomplaints, indeed, Sir, we are very well aware of this  too,\r\n\r\ngiven  the fact that it is easy for people to complain  about\r\n\r\ntheir  neighbour's  children being abused,  not  knowing  the\r\n\r\nreality  or  the  full story.  There may be instances  where,\r\n\r\njust because you have a rather lower threshold of discipline,\r\n\r\nyou  also  want  to  complain.  We are  aware  of  this.   My\r\n\r\nofficers  will  certainly sieve through  the  complaints  and\r\n\r\napplications  to ensure that only those which  are  fair  and\r\n\r\nbona  fide  will  be  pursued and those which  arise  out  of\r\n\r\nmalicious  complaints or very spurious  complaints  would  be\r\n\r\ndropped even before we proceed further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of mandatory reporting, this is\r\n\r\nsomething  which has actually been debated a long  time  ago.\r\n\r\nIn countries where mandatory reporting is applied, especially\r\n\r\namong  professionals,  we  found  that  the  level  of   non-compliance even by the professionals themselves is as high as\r\n\r\n60%.   We  have consulted the professionals here in Singapore\r\n\r\nand, by and large, they feel that such laws are not necessary\r\n\r\nhere.    In  particular,  there  is  concern  that  mandatory\r\n\r\nreporting  may  in  fact  deter  parents,  who  are   abusers\r\n\r\nthemselves,  from seeking help, in particular,  medical  help\r\n\r\nfor themselves, their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchildren  or their victims.  And they may also be tempted  to\r\n\r\nkeep  their  children at home rather than send them  to  pre-school programme or to the doctor, thereby in fact insulating\r\n\r\ntheir children from the very people who could help them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, on balance, we feel that the education of\r\n\r\nprofessionals  who have regular contacts with children,  such\r\n\r\nas  doctors and teachers, is a much better approach  so  that\r\n\r\nthey know how to detect and report child abuse.  We have been\r\n\r\nconducting public education programmes for professionals  and\r\n\r\nservice  providers.  Mdm Claire Chiang mentioned it.  Earlier\r\n\r\nthis  year,  I launched an abridged version of  a  manual  on\r\n\r\n\"Marriage  and  Child  Abuse\" and,  certainly,  it  has  been\r\n\r\nhelpful  in  educating the people on how  to  identify  child\r\n\r\nabuse and also how to go about reporting child abuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of discipline and abuse is high in our minds\r\n\r\ntoo.   Maybe,  we  must also be sure that, in some  cultures,\r\n\r\nwhat  is abuse is really discipline.  In other cultures, what\r\n\r\nis  discipline  is really abuse.  We are very well  aware  of\r\n\r\nthat.  Whenever we do come across cases whereby there may  be\r\n\r\na   very  thin  line  between  what  is  abuse  and  what  is\r\n\r\ndiscipline,  we will bring in, as I said, all  the  expertise\r\n\r\nand  various views to ascertain whether whatever is  reported\r\n\r\nis really abuse or discipline.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of parents who are unable to take care of\r\n\r\ntheir  children, either because the child is disabled or  has\r\n\r\ngot  some mental problems, we will not straightaway say  that\r\n\r\nthe parent is abusing the child just by chaining the child to\r\n\r\nthe  wall.  We will look back much further, and not just look\r\n\r\nat  the picture which is presented to us.  In other words, we\r\n\r\nwill  go further and deeper.  Parents who are unable to  pay,\r\n\r\nbecause of low income or no income, we have other avenues  to\r\n\r\nhelp  them.  So we are very open in that sense.  We are  very\r\n\r\nflexible.  We understand that, ultimately, the child must  go\r\n\r\nback  to  the family or, hopefully, the child can go back  to\r\n\r\nthe  family.  Because we too would not want to put all abused\r\n\r\nchildren and all victims into institutions.  We would rather\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat they be rehabilitated.  We would rather that they become\r\n\r\nstable  and,  hopefully, they could go back to  their  family\r\n\r\nbecause  that  is  essentially where the  children  ought  to\r\n\r\nbelong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang also touched about the fate of\r\n\r\nintellectually disabled (ID) offenders.  This  is  important.\r\n\r\nThere  are  provisions  to first ascertain  the  intellectual\r\n\r\nlevel  of  these  children,  either  by  speaking  to  family\r\n\r\nmembers,  interviewing  them about their  background,  mental\r\n\r\ncapacity  and  medical conditions and even  interviewing  the\r\n\r\ncomplainant  about the offender's behaviour.  This  screening\r\n\r\nand  identification  process will help  us  manage  the  case\r\n\r\nappropriately so as to reduce unnecessary trauma  experienced\r\n\r\nby   the  ID  offenders  and  their  families.   During   the\r\n\r\nsentencing  stage,  the courts exercise  their  discretionary\r\n\r\npowers  and take note of the special characteristics  of  the\r\n\r\noffenders, such as their mental or medical condition, in  the\r\n\r\ncourts' decisions.  If an offender is intellectually disabled\r\n\r\nindeed,  the  courts can request for a social report  on  the\r\n\r\noffender with a view to granting probation, for example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, when a probation is granted or recommended for\r\n\r\nan  ID offender, the probation officer will work closely with\r\n\r\nthe  probationer  to  attend specialised  programmes  run  by\r\n\r\ncommunity   agencies,  such  as  the  Association   for   the\r\n\r\nEducationally Subnormal or Bizlink Centre, and upon placement\r\n\r\non  the  probation,  the  ID  offender  will  be  assigned  a\r\n\r\npsychologically   trained  officer  for   supervision   where\r\n\r\npossible.   In MCDS-run homes where there is an ID  offender,\r\n\r\nwe  have  our own psychological services unit to  assess  the\r\n\r\nintellectual  functioning of the offender and  recommend  the\r\n\r\nappropriate rehabilitation programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee asked whether we ought not to impose\r\n\r\nheavier penalties on the media who disclose the identities of\r\n\r\nvictims who are under 16.  Sir, I cannot agree more with  the\r\n\r\nMember that the penalties which we are imposing do not impose\r\n\r\nany  financial  hardship on the media.   For  sure,  it  will\r\n\r\ndefinitely not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompensate the child, the young person and their families for\r\n\r\nany  distress  that they may have caused resulting  from  the\r\n\r\ndisclosure.  But although the fine seems very nominal, it has\r\n\r\nto be commensurate with the other proposed fines provided for\r\n\r\nin the Act.  So that is something we have to follow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we would like to assure the NMP that my\r\n\r\nMinistry has worked and will continue to work with the  media\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that they are mindful of the social  implications\r\n\r\nand  ramifications of reporting or disclosing what they ought\r\n\r\nnot  to  disclose, through continuous education and dialogue.\r\n\r\nBut,  actually, the media here are generally very responsible\r\n\r\nin  their coverage on matters relating to children and  young\r\n\r\npersons.   Of  course, there are rare incidents whereby  they\r\n\r\nhave  the identities of the juveniles revealed to the  public\r\n\r\nand  when we investigated further, we found that these  could\r\n\r\nhave been genuine mistakes, and not through wilful disclosure\r\n\r\nof the facts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo asked about contamination. He feared that\r\n\r\nputting the new juvenile offenders together with the hardcore\r\n\r\nresidents  of rehabilitation homes would somehow  contaminate\r\n\r\nthe  former.   We  are aware of this, Sir, and  we  are  very\r\n\r\nconcerned  about contamination too.  What really  happens  is\r\n\r\nthat  before  residents are put into the homes,  we  classify\r\n\r\nthem, ie, they go through a classification system.  We have a\r\n\r\nsystem called CLASS, which is a classification and assessment\r\n\r\nsystem.   This tool helps the Ministry to identify the  needs\r\n\r\nof   each  juvenile  offender  in  a  very  professional  and\r\n\r\nobjective  manner.   All newly committed  juveniles  will  be\r\n\r\nassessed  by  a multi-disciplinary team for their  character,\r\n\r\nbehaviour and also their rehabilitation needs.  And from  the\r\n\r\noutcome  of these assessments, we will consider an individual\r\n\r\ncare  plan  for  each juvenile.  That is one  strategy.   The\r\n\r\nother  strategy is to separate the two groups and,  based  on\r\n\r\nthe  results  from CLASS, the homes make a  decision  on  the\r\n\r\nphysical  placement  of  the boys and  girls  into  different\r\n\r\nresidential blocks within the homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo also asked whether institutionalisation is\r\n\r\nalways  the  last  resort.  As I said,  we  believe  in  that\r\n\r\nphilosophy.   And,  since  1999, we  have  been  getting  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  very  much involved in the rehabilitation  of  the\r\n\r\nyoung  person  and child.  Since 1999, for example,  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  very  active  in  forging ties with  the  community  to\r\n\r\ninitiate  numerous  community-based services  and  programmes\r\n\r\nthat  are  closely linked with wholesome youth  developments.\r\n\r\nOur  results  have shown that community-based  rehabilitation\r\n\r\nindeed,  when  used appropriately, provides  the  most  cost-effective  and  least  disruptive means to  rehabilitate  the\r\n\r\njuvenile offender.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also, in a way, a response to Mr Charles Chong\r\n\r\nwho is very concerned that we do not really go into the realm\r\n\r\nof  the  family, to intervene in what ought to  be  a  family\r\n\r\nmatter.  Again, as I said, ultimately, our objective  is  for\r\n\r\nthe  family to take charge of the child and we make it  such.\r\n\r\nThe rehabilitative process that we go through is not only  to\r\n\r\nrehabilitate  the child but also to ensure that  the  parents\r\n\r\nwould be able to take care of the child and, therefore, bring\r\n\r\nthe  child  back  into  the family later  on.   That  is  our\r\n\r\nultimate objective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong also raised the question about the\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of  the term \"undesirable  activities\".   The\r\n\r\nterm\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreally  is  meant to protect any child who  may  be  used  by\r\n\r\nadults  for  activities, especially illegal ones,  which  are\r\n\r\ndetrimental  to  the  well-being of the  child,  eg,  illegal\r\n\r\nlotteries,  illegal hawking, gambling or activities  of  such\r\n\r\nmagnitude  or  like.   The  context referred  is  to  illegal\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Could the Minister\r\n\r\nelaborate  on one query?  How do we check the powers  of  the\r\n\r\nDirector?
