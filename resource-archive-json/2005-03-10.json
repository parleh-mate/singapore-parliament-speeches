FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister of State for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon) (for the Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports):&nbsp;</B> &nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I share the hon. Member Mr Sin Boon Ann's&nbsp;concern for mothers with unwanted pregnancies.&nbsp; We want to reach out to these mothers and help them make informed, responsible and safe choices.&nbsp; Our main objective is to ensure that both the baby and mother are safe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MCYS has adopted a three-pronged approach to prevent any pregnancy from becoming a crisis. Firstly, sex education is important in preventing unintended pregnancies especially among younger women.&nbsp; Sex education programme is already part of the school curriculum. MCYS also works with voluntary welfare organisations to conduct talks for teens and workshops for parents on how to guide their children on sex matters.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2248<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, when a woman has an unwanted pregnancy, we ensure there is relevant social service support to help her make informed choices.&nbsp; Expectant mothers who are in a dilemma or distress can call the 24-hour National Pregnancy Helpline.&nbsp; Last month, we also launched the Babes service, which is a collaboration of&nbsp; seven&nbsp;pregnancy help agencies - Beyond Social Services, KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Tanjong Pagar Family Service Centre, Family Life Society, aLife, Andrew and Grace Home and Rose Villa.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, we work with voluntary welfare organisations to provide a safe environment for the expecting mother to carry the pregnancy to full-term.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the mother wants to give up her baby for adoption, social workers will help to make the arrangements. In a certain way, these shelters provide the same help to mothers as baby drops.&nbsp; Last year, through the shelters, 11 babies were successfully adopted and 20 babies were re-united with their natural families.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We understand the intention of calling for legislation for baby drops.&nbsp; However, based on overseas experience, legislation has not been effective in preventing babies from being abandoned.&nbsp; The better approach to take is providing sex education to prevent unwanted pregnancies and assistance to women already in a pregnancy crisis.&nbsp; Long-term solutions to the problem of abandoned babies require preventive efforts and good support services.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often, what is most important to a mother in a pregnancy crisis is the understanding and support of her parents and family. Family members can really make a difference and help the mother make the right decision. The community can also offer a helping hand to any expecting women in distress, and encourage them to seek help early.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</B> Sir, I thank the Minister of State for her reply.&nbsp; I <p align=left>Column: 2249<p>just have a couple of questions.&nbsp; First, she said earlier that similar legislation overseas which allow for baby drops have not been effective.&nbsp; Will the Minister of State be able to clarify what she meant by not effective legislation?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second question essentially relates to social services being readily available and therefore mothers with unwanted pregnancies could go for counselling.&nbsp; I wonder whether the Minister will agree with me that more can be done in this regard to publicise the kind of help that is available.&nbsp; We all remember the telephone number for the Pizza delivery service.&nbsp; But can we recall the number of these help agencies on the top of our head as readily as we do recall the Pizza delivery service?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, although the Government may not be in a position to legislate to allow for baby-drop centres, I would like to ask the Minister whether the Government may be open to such a similar position at some point in time in the future.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;the 24-hour National Pregnancy Helpline number is 1800-MUM-TO-BE.&nbsp; I think it is quite easy to remember than the Pizza number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me thank the Member for his concern.&nbsp; The reason why&nbsp;legislation overseas has not been effective is that, based on overseas experience, legalised baby-drops have&nbsp;benefits and&nbsp; problems, but the problems outweigh the benefits.&nbsp; This includes the misuse of baby-drops to give up babies with sickness, disabled, handicapped and babies who are involved in child trafficking, babies&nbsp;with health risk and whose medical history is unknown, and also legal problems&nbsp;with parental rights if one parent does not know that the baby was given up at a baby-drop.&nbsp; So if we legalise baby-drops, we risk facing similar problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current help arrangement is better as it incorporates the benefits of baby-drop and avoid the problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2250<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If we make it legal to abandon a baby, even at a baby-drop centre, we are sending a wrong signal that it is acceptable for parents to abandon their responsibility towards their child.&nbsp; This contradicts the foundation of our child welfare system and promotion of the family as a cornerstone of our society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our three-pronged approach&nbsp;- preventive, support services, safe environment and crisis shelter - is better than baby-drops, and it looks after the welfare of both mother and baby.&nbsp; Baby-drops may save babies but do not care for the mother's health and welfare.&nbsp; The mother needs proper reproductive healthcare too.&nbsp; Most mothers who are interviewed have indicated that if their daughter is pregnant and has a baby, they want to know, so that they can support the child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spirit of the Children and Young Persons Act which makes abandonment an offence is to protect the safety of children.&nbsp; The law is still relevant for this reason.&nbsp; However, we are providing many other avenues for parents who seek help if they have an unwanted pregnancy.&nbsp; If parents come forward to seek help early, they can be guided to make responsible choices.&nbsp; They will not be prosecuted for abandoning their baby. Each case is handled as confidential and managed with compassion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our approach of using shelters gives us the benefit of the baby-drop and there is no dumping of babies and no prosecution as there is no issue of abandonment.&nbsp; At the crisis shelter, the mother is given all the help she needs.&nbsp; Our approach, therefore, gives priority to the safety, health and welfare of both mother and baby.&nbsp; This is more than what baby-drop provides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member also talked about promotion and also to carry out more activities to help the VWOs to do more in this area.&nbsp; I totally agree.&nbsp; I think there is<p align=left>Column: 2251<p> still room for improvement.&nbsp; Definitely, my Ministry, together with the many-helping-hands approach, will do more.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</B> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister that with regard to&nbsp;promoting awareness of such crisis centres, particularly to teenagers in secondary schools and beyond, are there programmes to inform the secondary school students, especially of the availability of such centres and to counsel them.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon:</B> Sir, I mentioned just now that sex education is already part of the school curriculum.&nbsp; Also, last year, we launched the National Pregnancy Helpline 1800-MUM-TO-BE.&nbsp; Last month, we also launched the Babes service with seven welfare agencies, like the Tanjong Pagar Family Service Centre, Beyond Social Services, Rose Villa and so on.&nbsp; I think they also get support from the SMRT for placing posters and brochures.&nbsp; Maybe if&nbsp;MPs and grassroots organisations want to help us to disseminate the information, we will also give more information to the ground.&nbsp; For instance, the Nominated MP, Miss Olsen, is also one of the spokeswomen for teenage pregnancy.&nbsp; I also welcome our MPs to give a helping hand.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</B>&nbsp; Sir, apart from sex education in schools, I would like to know whether teachers are trained to identify and keep a look out for school girls who may be pregnant, and teachers could basically provide early intervention.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon:</B>&nbsp; Sir, maybe the hon.

In these developed countries, the thinking on occupational safety and health and how to make workplaces safer has advanced dramatically over the past three decades.&nbsp; I spoke not only to regulators, but also to leaders in international construction firms, unionists, academics and researchers working in private institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>is based on the British Factories Act, but the United Kingdom has since revised their regulatory framework.&nbsp; These developed countries have been able to significantly reduce accidents and deaths only after they evolved new principles and legislation to cope with changing practices.&nbsp; They recognise that if we just do more of what we have done in the past, improvements, if any, will only be incremental.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Overhaul framework to accelerate a safety culture</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To achieve higher safety standards will require a change of mindsets of all stakeholders to be intolerant of safety lapses.&nbsp; Accidents can only be prevented if all individuals have embedded deep within them a safety culture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government cannot improve safety standards alone.&nbsp; We have to involve all stakeholders and adopt new principles to accelerate change.&nbsp; We need an overhaul<p align=left>Column: 2254<p> of our present system to ingrain good safety habits in all individuals at the workplace - from top management to the last worker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having looked at other systems and exchanged ideas with experts in those countries with excellent safety records, MOM has formulated a new framework and roadmap to improve the safety culture and achieve a quantum leap in safety standards.&nbsp; While our ultimate goal must be to have zero fatalities, through this new framework, we aim to first reduce deaths at workplaces by a third in five years, and by half within a decade or sooner.&nbsp; If we can achieve this, then we would have attained current standards comparable to the top 10 developed countries in safety.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>New principles to ingrain safety awareness</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three principles are fundamental to our new framework.&nbsp; First, we should reduce risks at the source by requiring all stakeholders to minimise or eliminate risks which they create.&nbsp; Accepting risks presented at the workplace leads to unnecessary loss of life.&nbsp; Instead, under the new framework, those who create risks must be responsible and held accountable to reduce, or better still, eliminate the risks to prevent accidents.&nbsp; We will therefore require assessments to identify the source of risks at workplaces, the actions to reduce these risks, and the parties responsible for doing so.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These responsibilities will involve persons along the whole process chain including top management.&nbsp; As examples, architects and engineers must ensure that their construction projects are safe to build and maintain.&nbsp; Manufacturers and suppliers must ensure that the machinery they supply or maintain is safe to use.&nbsp; Workers have a responsibility to adopt safe work practices.&nbsp; In other words, all persons at work must accept responsibility for their own safety, the safety of <p align=left>Column: 2255<p>those under their charge, and those they affect through their work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second principle is that industry itself must be required to take greater ownership of safety outcomes.&nbsp; They must self-regulate to reduce the loss of life and injury to workers under their charge.&nbsp; Our current Factories Act is prescriptive.&nbsp; This encourages a mindset among management and workers to follow the \u201cletter of the law\ufffd? and not address safety aspects outside prescribed legislation.&nbsp; Ownership for their workers' safety is lessened as some wait for new regulations before taking action.&nbsp; But it will be difficult for legislation and enforcement to always keep pace with the rapid technological changes in existing and new industries.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry, through legislation and enforcement, will continue to maintain standards and set goals for industry to attain our safety targets.&nbsp; But self-regulation must mean that practitioners who are the most knowledgeable about the hazards that occur in their particular situation must be held responsible to develop safe work procedures.&nbsp; Each workplace must design and be required to put into place a safety system to adequately respond to specific hazards identified.&nbsp; These systems must include concrete steps for implementation to put into place safe work practices, machinery and equipment and training of personnel.&nbsp; Qualified safety professionals will audit these systems for adequacy and compliance.&nbsp; However, there will still be prescriptive guidance for clearly defined high-risk hazardous sectors and practices. This will be helpful for small and medium enterprises that will need time to adjust to this new framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third principle is that we should prevent accidents through higher penalties for poor safety management.&nbsp; Safety lapses resulting in mishaps are severely<p align=left>Column: 2256<p> punished, but the penalties for offences in the absence of mishaps are comparatively lower.&nbsp; For example, composition fines are limited to $2,000 per offence.&nbsp; This encourages the industry to tolerate sub-optimal safety practices until accidents occur.&nbsp; MOM will impose greater financial disincentives and penalties on workplaces with unsafe systems, before any accident has occurred.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n<I>Key measures to facilitate change</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To effect the new framework, I will, by the end of this year,&nbsp;introduce a new Workplace Safety and Health Act;&nbsp;set up a new Workplace Safety and Health Council; and&nbsp;establish an International Advisory Panel for Occupational Safety and Health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new Workplace Safety and Health Act will replace the current Factories Act.&nbsp; It will articulate the three principles I have outlined earlier into law.&nbsp; It will specify liabilities for a wider range of stakeholders, strengthen personal accountability of stakeholders and&nbsp;key personnel, and focus more on occupational safety and health goals and systems.&nbsp; Safety plans will be mandated and safety officers given more responsibilities and powers.&nbsp; We will table the Act later this year after consulting all stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will also set up a new Workplace Safety and Health Council to promote self-regulation and instil ownership in safety outcomes.&nbsp; The Council will involve senior management to oversee sector-specific committees to set standards and drive reforms.&nbsp; The Council and its committees will comprise experts and representatives from leading companies in safety and health, professional bodies, insurance companies, employer associations, unions, academics, and relevant Government agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we catch up with the leading countries, they will also advance in their<p align=left>Column: 2257<p> occupational safety and health practices.&nbsp; We need to keep abreast of international developments to achieve our target of being among the top 10 safest places to work.&nbsp; I will therefore establish a standing International Advisory Panel to tap expertise and experience beyond our shores.&nbsp; The Panel will inject fresh and objective views, review and critique our regulatory regime, practices, and standards, and provide international benchmarks.&nbsp; This will identify our strengths and shortcomings, and enable us to continuously improve our systems and laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>A call to action</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accidents in the Nicoll Highway Collapse, Fusionpolis, and the oil tanker blast at Keppel Shipyard last year serve as stark warnings that we tolerate safety lapses at our own peril.&nbsp; If the Nicoll Highway Collapse had occurred at the peak of rush hour with many more cars on the road, or led to the collapse of surrounding buildings, the devastation would have been too horrendous to imagine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These high profile accidents are timely wake-up calls to firm and decisive action.&nbsp; To achieve better safety standards will require the unstinting support of all stakeholders, including regulators, employers, safety personnel, professional associations, unions, and every individual.&nbsp; We will consult all stakeholders as to how we can implement this new framework effectively to quickly achieve our goals.&nbsp; If we are determined in our collective efforts, we can make Singapore, our home, a safer place to work.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It is not about putting in place a system or just some kind of procedures or to appoint a safety officer.&nbsp; Shortcuts should not be taken at the expense of safety.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister, besides the big stick, ie, penalty, how would&nbsp;MOM ensure that employers will do the necessary.&nbsp; And I would also like to ask the Minister, in introducing a new occupational safety and health framework, whether MOM will also review the safety training framework.&nbsp; Look at the last few accidents that happened.&nbsp; Although these areas already have mandatory safety training, accidents still happened.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Member for his questions.&nbsp; I know that Mr Yeo has been&nbsp;at the helm of pushing for a safety review, and for good reason.&nbsp; Yes, I agree that employers need to hoist this in, and that is why this framework squarely puts in place the responsibility to evolve safety plans to show that&nbsp;they have concrete steps to put these plans into action<p align=left>Column: 2259<p> and that&nbsp;they have provided for materials to be bought, for equipment to be provided, to have trained&nbsp;their personnel.&nbsp; That is the gist of this new framework.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a paper exercise?&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the crux of the question that Mr Yeo asked.&nbsp; If anybody thinks that this is a paper exercise, I would advise them to think through this, because this will be enacted into law -&nbsp;harsher penalties for those who do not meet the mark, more rigorous standards and achievements.&nbsp; But the big stick, as Mr Yeo has pointed out, has been applied before.&nbsp; So I think the second element, which I have talked about, is to instil ownership, and this is where the Workplace Safety and Health Council plays an integral part.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But I would like to ask the Minister: why does&nbsp;MOM put such a long timeframe of 10 years to reduce our current worksite fatality rate of 4.9 by half, to match the safety standards achieved by the top 10 developed countries?&nbsp; As every fatality is one fatality too many, should we not have a more aggressive target?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, how does the Ministry see this new approach that places responsibility for safety on all stakeholders in the operation - from the directors, top management, supervisors, right down to the site workers - impacting on business cost?&nbsp; Should the Ministry also not consider, as a supplement to the harsher penalties for offences or breach of safety<p align=left>Column: 2260<p> guidelines, incentives such as plus points to contractors who maintain high safety standards, ie, instead of just administering the big stick, also put the carrot in?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But in setting targets, it is important for us to be realistic.&nbsp; The European countries took about 20 to&nbsp;30 years to reach their current level.&nbsp; As I will explain later during the Committee of Supply, we have reached a stage where you require every individual to participate.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will provide some examples&nbsp;of previous accidents that had occurred.&nbsp;

Indeed, incentives already exist.&nbsp; For example, under BCA or HDB's planning tender contracts, or LTA's contracts, they do put in place incentive systems where someone shows a good safety record, particular incentives are given.&nbsp; I agree that more needs&nbsp;to be done there and we will look into ways that we can incentivise that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2261<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think one key area is for the Workplace Safety and Health Council to put out information into the market about the good as well as&nbsp;those with not so good safety records.&nbsp; In terms of business costs, I take it this would impact companies who have not taken time to build up the safety systems.&nbsp; And indeed, that is the right thing to do.&nbsp; Those who invested time and effort and resources into building up their safety practices&nbsp;need not fear that this will increase costs disproportionately.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for announcing and putting forth this framework.&nbsp; As my colleagues Mr Yeo and Dr Khor said, the key is how to&nbsp;filter it down to operation and action. I am pleased to hear that the Minister is earnestly keen to bring down accidents and improve safety standards.&nbsp; But I have four questions for the Minister.&nbsp; Firstly, I think the Government should actually take the lead in promoting safety standards.&nbsp; How to do this is to actually impose in&nbsp; the Government contracts as&nbsp;the requirements in the tender contracts, whereby specifications should be made very clear as to the&nbsp;minimum safety standards that are needed in accordance with&nbsp;the norms&nbsp;of those industries of the tenders.&nbsp; In this manner, the tenderers themselves are forced by such contracts to apply the required safety standards and therefore improve their own safety measures.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, how can we recognise companies that adopt good practices and safety measures?&nbsp; Again, perhaps, in&nbsp;the tenders, both for Government as well as private sector, it should be encouraged that premiums can&nbsp;be given for companies that propose&nbsp;and practise good safety measures.&nbsp; For example, insurance premiums can be a factor that can help them to lower their cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the Minister mentioned about halving the defects in about 10 years.&nbsp; I<p align=left>Column: 2262<p> share Dr Khor's point&nbsp;on why just half in 10 years.&nbsp; Why not have a more aggressive target?&nbsp; Why not have a zero defect at the workplace?&nbsp; Because as we said, every fatality is still a death that we do not want.&nbsp;&nbsp;We should&nbsp;aim for a zero target in every workplace.&nbsp; It should be a zero defect or zero fatality as&nbsp;the target for all industries and&nbsp;the Government sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally,&nbsp;on compensation.&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the view that we should have&nbsp;higher penalty for the employers. But why not&nbsp; have higher compensations for the injured employees?&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also take care of the injured employees.&nbsp; We should put in the&nbsp;law&nbsp;that employers who have bad practices and cause injuries should actually pay higher compensation&nbsp;for their injured employees.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> Sir, I am cheered by Mr Leong's comments.&nbsp; He represents employers, and all that he has said makes&nbsp;good sense.&nbsp; He represents the group of employers who are enlightened and realised that safety must be internalised through business processes and costs.&nbsp; But we will certainly take his suggestions to heart, in terms of Government taking the lead,&nbsp;and I think that is the right stance. In principle, I agree.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should we also build in systems where insurance companies' premiums can incentivise those with good safety practices&nbsp;and, as a corollary, these incentivise or penalise those with&nbsp;poor performances?&nbsp; I think, yes.&nbsp; France has a very complicated system&nbsp;where they actually compute based on the number of accidents and workmen's compensation.&nbsp; We want to start by putting out the information there.&nbsp; As I said, the Workplace Safety and Health Council can do this at regular intervals.&nbsp; In other words, it should publish to all and sundry, what your workplace safety performance has been.&nbsp; This will impact on the insurance, this will impact<p align=left>Column: 2263<p> on the employees wanting to join the company, and this will also impact on the developers who want to give them contracts.&nbsp; That will&nbsp;make sense.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should we aim for zero fatality?&nbsp; For&nbsp;sure.&nbsp; Let us do it.&nbsp; If we can do it, the faster the better.&nbsp; But, as I said,&nbsp;this is a realistic target.&nbsp; If I&nbsp;fall short of this target, I would ramp up the system.&nbsp; But this is the base.&nbsp;If we can move faster, let us do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of compensation for workmen's injuries, yes, we do need to look at it.&nbsp; The compensation&nbsp;is higher, but the figure is always relative.&nbsp; So if there is a need for review, we will do so.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</B> Sir, there are two points that I would like to seek clarification from the Minister.&nbsp; Firstly, I fully support the framework, focus and emphasis.&nbsp; However, I am a<p align=left>Column: 2264<p> little bit concerned about the emphasis on self-regulation.&nbsp; I understand the purpose is to ensure that there is ownership all along the chain.&nbsp; But the focus on self-regulation is&nbsp;a concern to me.&nbsp; The question I would like to ask is whether it would lead to a dilution on the role and responsibility of the employer.&nbsp; There are many things which the workers have no control.&nbsp; For instance, the workers have no control on how the factory is built, how&nbsp;the machinery and equipment&nbsp;are designed, how the production layout in the factory is done.&nbsp; So they have no control, as&nbsp;they are not&nbsp;a contributing party to the ability to create a safer work environment for themselves, of which the employers must take ultimate responsibility.&nbsp; So would the Minister&nbsp;clarify?&nbsp;&nbsp;Would this focus on self-regulation result in a dilution of the employer's responsibility, a transfer of responsibility to other stakeholders and in&nbsp;particular, it should not result in the transfer of responsibility to the workers?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point I would like to ask is the importance of education.&nbsp; Educating people about the importance of safety is very critical, particularly in Singapore, where there is a higher number of foreign workers working side by side, and foreign workers are from so many nationalities.&nbsp; So there must be a common language when it comes to safety and&nbsp;that everybody can speak and communicate along the line.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> Let me thank Mdm Halimah for allowing me to have the opportunity to clarify.&nbsp; She is quite right.&nbsp; Self-regulation should not be misconstrued as saying, \" I now leave it to your employers to decide on&nbsp;how to do it.\"&nbsp; That is absolutely the converse of what I am saying here.&nbsp; My Ministry, through legislation and enforcement, will continue to set standards.&nbsp; Self-regulation means that you must take ownership and say how you are going to achieve these standards.&nbsp; And as I said, safety plans must be involved.&nbsp; You must show concrete steps<p align=left>Column: 2265<p> to implement this.&nbsp; There will be qualified safety professionals who will audit these plans, both for adequacy and compliance.&nbsp; So rest assured that self-regulation increases; not decreases,&nbsp;management responsibility.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of education of foreign workers, Mdm Halimah has quite rightly pointed out that most countries with a high proportion of foreign workers do have a harder time in achieving safety standards.&nbsp; That is so even for European countries.&nbsp; So if you compare Spain and the Netherlands, or Spain and Sweden, Sweden has a more homogeneous workforce, Spain has higher fatalities.&nbsp; It is more difficult, but it is not impossible.&nbsp; Even in Singapore, we have companies with the same population of foreign workers who have achieved higher safety standards.&nbsp; So I think culture is important.&nbsp; Yes, we have to ramp up education so that all our foreign workers and local workers can understand what it means to have safe habits.&nbsp; We need to really work harder at this.&nbsp; But it can be done.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The main responsibility for the working environment lies with the employers.&nbsp; And the OHS authority in Sweden goes for less prescriptive safety rules and regulations and encourage employers to <p align=left>Column: 2267<p>meet the safety standards in various practical and more innovative ways.&nbsp; The authority also minimises the costs of compliance and takes particular care to work with particularly the small and medium enterprises.&nbsp; This is something the Ministry of Manpower here should also consider.&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot be only targeting at the big factories and&nbsp;to ensure that the big factories are in compliance with all the safety regulations and did not look at the small companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One concern is that, like&nbsp;my colleague, Mdm Halimah, has just now mentioned, the union leaders are also concerned that if the safety regulations are&nbsp;less prescriptive, then they also worry the employers will end up by keeping&nbsp;just their fingers crossed, hoping nothing&nbsp;will happen and not sure what to do.&nbsp; This is also a concern that the Ministry should consider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In France, incentive is given to companies with best records.&nbsp; It is something&nbsp;that we do not have here.&nbsp; These companies pay less contribution to the centralised insurance, and those with high accident compensation claims are asked to pay more.&nbsp; This is also a scheme which we can consider.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last, but not least, at the same time, I would like to once again urge the Ministry of Manpower that, after we have reviewed, revamped and made&nbsp;the safety rules and regulations and legislation more effective, we still have to consider extending the scope of the OHS legislation in Singapore to provide protection to all workers in the workplaces, including non-industrial workplaces.&nbsp; Under the current legislation, the Factories Act only&nbsp;protects one-third of the overall workforce, that is, 700,000 workers.&nbsp; I hope the Ministry can seriously consider this point as well.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Both the employers and employees should share the fruits of success and the prosperity of their enterprises.&nbsp; People in the personnel departments should adopt an open-mind towards all workers, particularly the ones more at risk, ie, the older workers.&nbsp; More importantly, all the people in the company should feel that the contributions and efforts put in by the older and mature workers are rewarded accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I hope&nbsp;that the Ministry will&nbsp;work with the management to try to make the management foresighted enough to warn their workers to prepare for the challenges and put in place adequate training for these workers at risk, so as to help them to meet the challenges ahead.&nbsp; They should be committed in looking after the welfare of their employees, particularly the mature workers, and give them due protection and a sense of belonging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Structural unemployment is unlike other forms of unemployment in that the primary reason is a mismatch between skills sets that workers have and what employers demand.&nbsp; The main factors causing the problem of structural unemployment are: many old and lower educated Singaporean workers do not have the necessary skills that jobs in the current market demand, while many only<p align=left>Column: 2269<p> possess obsolete industry-specific skills.&nbsp; In addition, low education and lack of knowledge of where and how to obtain these relevant skills are also impediments in solving the problem of such a skills mismatch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retraining has been cited time and again as a solution.&nbsp; But are there any statistics to prove that it leads to more people getting jobs or how they still cannot find jobs?&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what is the progress of the various schemes that the Ministry has put in place to help workers cope with such challenges and ensure that the workers, particularly the mature ones, could continue to be employable.&nbsp; I think there is a need to educate the HR practitioner and the management as well to change their mindsets against mature workers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Singaporeans think that MOM's policy has facilitated employers to take in more foreign workers and end up with more local workers being displaced.&nbsp; There is also a sense that MOM does not appear keen to fine-tune the ratio which has increased to allow companies to bring in more foreign workers in good times but has been very sticky downwards even in bad times.&nbsp; Would the Ministry consider providing the statistics of the employment situation of the local and foreign workers over the last five years?&nbsp; Did the Ministry study the impact of the low birth rate of about 1.4% on our labour market in the next 10 years?&nbsp; We also need to ensure that the employers would not abuse the flexibility given, as we have reviewed and revised the dependency ceiling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Employment Act was enacted on the assumption that executives can look after themselves whereas the lower educated employees would need the protection.&nbsp; However, the executives also encounter employment problems and need assistance.&nbsp; Take the salary dispute as an&nbsp;example.&nbsp; The existing way of engaging<p align=left>Column: 2270<p> lawyers to pursue their claim against employers is often costly and time consuming.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary now for the Ministry to review the EA coverage, ie, would we be able to consider allowing the executives to be also covered by the EA?&nbsp; If the objective of the Employment Act is to protect and enhance the welfare of all workers, then would the Government consider how&nbsp;we could also strengthen the protection for&nbsp;contract and part-time workers?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to also review some of the existing labour market practices that actually create the problem.&nbsp; With higher demand for workers in expanding sectors of the economy, the higher pay of these newly-created jobs will incentivise workers to retrain and take on these jobs.&nbsp; However, some training programmes are tied to formal qualifications.&nbsp; For example, an NTC programme has a pre-requisite of at least two O-level subjects.&nbsp; Many of these tie-ups are unnecessary as they are not linked to the ability to perform the jobs which the employers need the employees to do so.&nbsp; The Government needs to work with the employers to cultivate practices that identify skills and talents beyond just pure academic qualification requirements.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, we are just into the third month of 2005, and there are already a total of eight industrial accidents, mainly from negligence, non-compliance and/or a lack of understanding and knowledge of safety procedures.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to me that we have yet to evolve a culture on industrial safety and health.&nbsp; To inculcate such a culture, all stakeholders, from Government to employers, unions, employees as well as<p align=left>Column: 2271<p> Singaporeans in general, must take self-ownership and responsibility for the safety of their living environment.&nbsp; I applaud MOM for its timely announcement of kicking in a safety culture movement in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, despite calls by the authorities for greater safety compliance and educational programmes to promote safety awareness, especially in the last one&nbsp;year, we are still bombarded by frequent outbreaks of industrial accidents.&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a lack of discipline and self-will by stakeholders.&nbsp; This is often contributed by our <I>\"bo chap\"</I> attitude, eg,&nbsp;\"It would not happen to me.&nbsp; It is too '<I>ley chey'</I> to follow the procedures.&nbsp; Rules are meant to be broken.&nbsp; It is about working smart, not hard, or else how to achieve the KPIs that management has set for us?\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, stakeholders must be responsible for minimising and eliminating risks.&nbsp; To complement our educational approach towards inculcating a safety culture, we need to move towards an enforcement approach where the \"carrot and the stick\" may be necessary.&nbsp; It is timely for us to make a determined effort to break through our lethargic safety culture mindset and embark on a pro-active effort in managing safety in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A culture does not evolve instantly, although I know in Singapore we have a knack for instant solutions.&nbsp; To evolve a safety culture, we need to tackle the source, identify the key owners and establish a performance management framework where we must instil disciplinary actions as well as freely dispense incentives for rewards of exemplary behaviours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Government, in reviewing its legislative framework, should establish working committees with industry stakeholders for constant feedback and sharing<p align=left>Column: 2272<p> on safety issues.&nbsp; In fact, the copy-cat approach is a very powerful approach for people to learn.&nbsp; Very often, being aware of what others are doing will spur us to emulate.&nbsp; As such, it will be good if we can learn more of how other countries go about managing their safety culture.&nbsp; Without doubt, embarking on a safety culture movement in Singapore will mean investing efforts, time and resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can we ensure that companies will do this?&nbsp; Will MOM provide financial incentives to encourage companies to embark on this safety culture movement?&nbsp; What will MOM do for those companies that do not comply?&nbsp; What process would be put in place for auditing the safety procedures so as to sustain the safety culture&nbsp;movement in Singapore?&nbsp; How can MOM involve stakeholders in reinforcing the education of stakeholders on safety awareness?&nbsp; Is there a timeframe and a standard that will be set for stakeholders to achieve?&nbsp; How will MOM go about attaining these KPIs?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask&nbsp;whether MOM would be reviewing the Factory (Safety Management System) Order (SMS), which is an important prerequisite for a successful establishment of the OSH Framework.&nbsp; I note that the current SMS is not all encompassing, as not all the factories are covered.&nbsp; What is the rationale for only covering these three categories of factories and limiting to only 100 or more persons for factories engaged in the manufacture of metal products?&nbsp; In fact, I urge MOM to consider instituting a parallel OSH framework for non-factory type of workplaces, such as shopping malls, hawker centres and the markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I note that section 72 of the existing Factories Act is silent on the participation of unions in&nbsp;safety committees.&nbsp; Section 72 merely states that:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"The occupier of&nbsp;a&nbsp;factory, in which 50 or more persons are for the time being employed,<p align=left>Column: 2273<p> shall establish a safety committee on which both employees and management are represented for the purpose of keeping under review, circumstances in the factory which affect or may affect the safety or health of the persons employed therein.\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This means that in unionised environments, both the unions and management can reserve the right to decline the unions' membership in the Safety Committee.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the success of the OSH framework in an unionised environment will hinge on the equal participation of unions in Safety Committees so that unions can partner management to ensure compliance of safety measures and outcomes and to jointly manage cases of non-compliance.&nbsp; Can the Ministry clarify the intention of section 72 in keeping silent on union participation for unionised environment?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I had mentioned earlier about the greater costs that would be incurred as a result of driving a safety culture movement.&nbsp; One important constituent that we must not leave out in this whole exercise of inculcating this&nbsp;safety movement are the doctors.&nbsp; One of the stipulations by MOM for Workmen's Compensation claims is that all injuries incurred by employees whilst at work resulting in four or more days of medical leave will be classified as industrial accidents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are reported cases of small index finger cut or fracture that have resulted in medical leave ranging from three days to 30 days prescribed by doctors.&nbsp; One wonders on what basis did the doctors involved prescribe that range of medical leave.&nbsp; Obviously, there are differing standards of integrity and vigilance from doctor to doctor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every day of absence from the workplace results in double cost to the <p align=left>Column: 2274<p>organisation, in that the absent employee is still being paid a salary and somebody else has to take over his job.&nbsp; So, I would like to check whether MOM will indeed be involving the Medical Council in this aspect.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> Sir, because the Occupational Safety framework which I announced is important, I would like to restrict my first reply specifically on that subject.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Members who have spoken during the COS as well as in response to the Ministerial Statement and, in the light of their comments, let me elaborate on some of the changes and answer their specific queries.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree completely&nbsp;with Mr Yeo&nbsp;who said that we need to take a new approach to create a safer working environment for our workers.&nbsp; If you remember, in the chart that we have distributed, Chart 1 clearly shows&nbsp;that our current approach has reached a limit in improving the accident frequency rate.&nbsp; In other words, our improvements have tapered off.&nbsp; We cannot break through that floor if we just do more of the same.&nbsp; This has been&nbsp;the experience of other countries and they too&nbsp;had to change their framework before they saw improvements.&nbsp; Their experience is consistent with our present situation, where continuing with what is commonly known as a prescriptive legislative framework and one dependent predominantly on the regulator will have diminishing results.&nbsp; In other words, you wait for me to tell you what to do before you do it, it will have diminishing results.&nbsp; You can get very good results when you started on a very low safety base, low standards, and you need this prescription.&nbsp; But up to a point when systems have been in place, it really is about ownership.&nbsp; Therefore, we need to put in place a radically different framework based on the three&nbsp;principles which I had earlier outlined in the Ministerial statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2275<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;We must involve all stakeholders to reduce the&nbsp;risks at the source;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Industry must take greater ownership of safety outcomes; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be higher penalties for poor safety management, not only after&nbsp;accidents occur, but even before accidents occur, so that you are encouraged,&nbsp;facilitated and incentivised to bring your safety systems up to the mark.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past accidents are clear examples why the old framework has its limitations.&nbsp; Take explosions arising from hot works in oil tankers that come for repairs, as an example to start.&nbsp; We have very&nbsp;strict systems, and you can well imagine why -&nbsp;to prevent explosions when they are doing welding works and when they&nbsp;are trying to clean the inside of an oil tanker.&nbsp; But ask yourself this:&nbsp;do we really need laws or regulations to tell you - the worker or the management - that you might cause an explosion when you are operating a naked flame in an enclosed space that was just previously filled with oil?&nbsp; It is intuitive.&nbsp; Any company and its workers with an ingrained corporate culture that really puts safety first would take all necessary precautions because they recognise the inherent risks.&nbsp; Some would sensibly even choose to go beyond the prescribed regulations.&nbsp; To protect themselves and their colleagues, the workers themselves would take all steps practicable to ensure their own safety.&nbsp; They would certainly exercise self-protection and make sure that the oil sludge has been cleared before starting hot works.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>Or an innovative company would seek new ways and technology to reduce the risks, ie,&nbsp;can you weld with other techniques or under different circumstances?&nbsp; We can have laws, regulations, prescriptions and inspections, but out of a thousand times, if you do that work and you <p align=left>Column: 2276<p>slip in vigilance once, that is it.&nbsp; An explosion is caused and deaths have occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without that ingrained safety culture, that is the reason why our fatalities will reach a particular point -&nbsp;we need&nbsp;to move beyond that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A second example -&nbsp;this time&nbsp;it is not of a big company.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may say big companies have good systems, so if you prescribe laws, they will follow.&nbsp; Let me give a second example of a small company. This time, one that dealt with making signs.&nbsp; It happened in Toa Payoh Industrial Park in January last year -&nbsp;four died, two injured. The operator was using an oxy-acetylene torch that had an oxygen cylinder contaminated by&nbsp;flammable gases. The gases mixed, went back into one tank and blew up. A flashback occurred which led to the explosion of the oxygen cylinder, because an effective safety device to prevent this was not used.&nbsp; Again, this&nbsp;is a risk commonly known.&nbsp; It makes sense that you do not mix the two. Clear written regulations, you can have laws,&nbsp;but until all workers take ownership for their own safety, accidents will occur. Would it have helped if we had regularly said that we want to inspect that safety device, every six months?&nbsp;&nbsp;It might.&nbsp; But what about in between the six months?&nbsp; How about three, two or even one month?&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if we inspect the device, if you do not use it properly, are you sure that accidents can be prevented?&nbsp; It cannot, unless it is internalised by workers, until they recognise that there is a safety culture that is required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree completely with Members&nbsp;who have said that we need a framework that shapes&nbsp;the correct mindsets and behaviour. If I may use the problem of construction workers falling from heights, which is one of the leading causes of on-site injuries in Singapore.&nbsp; This New Occupational Safety and Health (OSH)<p align=left>Column: 2277<p> framework will get industry to think more fundamentally to achieve the outcome of&nbsp;zero falls, which some Members have called for.&nbsp; Instead of just complying with regulations which say that you must have sufficient barricades, harnesses, scaffolding requirements, developers and contractors should be instead asking:&nbsp; in the first place, why does the worker have to work higher above than the ground to do his job?&nbsp; Is he doing something that can be done on the ground,&nbsp;then hoisted up?&nbsp; Has he been given the proper training in a language which he understands?&nbsp; Is the safety equipment adequate to protect him and enable him to do this job?&nbsp;&nbsp; These questions I have asked go beyond prescriptive legislation by the Government.&nbsp; To be more effective, we will have to involve all stakeholders and get them to take ownership of outcomes and reduce the risk at source.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Members have painted a rather not so charitable view of employers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this wishful thinking?&nbsp; Can we&nbsp;get employers, management and workers to behave like this?&nbsp; Are we just over-shooting these airy-fairy ideas?&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned about the last study trip to a few countries.&nbsp; During our trip, my delegation spoke to leaders in the construction industry.&nbsp;I was completely impressed by their safety records and their attitude to safety.&nbsp; Many of them, on their own, have gone beyond the law. They operate what we call zero tolerance policies towards accidents, not because the law requires it, but because it is being internalised, even though in some circumstances, it means that they have to increase the operating costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, one UK company informed us that on their own, they initiated a comprehensive safety programme in the 1990s called \"incident and injury free\", not \"fatality free\".&nbsp; Incident and injury free which does not tolerate any level of accidents, no matter how minor or infrequent.&nbsp; Their company, not only for themselves, also requires similar levels of<p align=left>Column: 2278<p> commitment of their sub-contractors by making a good safety record an important aspect of the tender requirements.&nbsp; When they sub-contract, their sub-contractors must also adopt this zero incident and injury free record.&nbsp; In addition, this company's policy is to seek a commitment of their safety philosophy from clients as well, not only of those whom they put out contracts to. They say to their clients, \"If you want us to work for you, you too must adopt this policy.\"&nbsp; So&nbsp;that there&nbsp;is a buy-in and support from their developer.&nbsp; If&nbsp;the developer says, \"I want you to&nbsp;tender for&nbsp;this project.\"&nbsp; They say, \"I have to build in a safety margin.\"&nbsp; The developer says, \"No.\"&nbsp; They would say, \"Then I would not tender for it.\" That is that.&nbsp; They are still profitable. In fact, they are one of the leading companies in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of ownership and a correct mindset that respects life, they have gone beyond the prescribed law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another company we visited shared with us - this was a clear and unequivocal commitment that was exercised daily.&nbsp; It tested their commitment. They just basically said, \"We will withdraw the bonus of the manager of&nbsp; any site with a fatal accident.\"&nbsp; That is it.&nbsp; There is no need to give reasons.&nbsp; As long as there is a fatality, bonuses are withdrawn.&nbsp; And yet, these companies are profitable and secure a significant market share of contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;This tells us they are serious about incorporating a safety culture.&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor mentioned about what it does to business cost.&nbsp; This tells us that incorporating the safety&nbsp;aspect into a business model does not make a company less viable.&nbsp; In any case, it may not impact on the business cost of the company if it does not have high safety standards. That cost has to be borne by others.&nbsp; It affects employees as the morale dips, workers delay, property is damaged,&nbsp;bad publicity affects future contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, take the Nicoll Highway collapse.&nbsp; Did it not cause disruptions to<p align=left>Column: 2279<p> our routines?&nbsp; Did&nbsp;motorists not have to go through other ways and&nbsp;pay ERP? That cost was absorbed by others, perhaps not by the companies. We need companies to internalise that cost.&nbsp; Our local companies need to take this on-board and learn from them on how a progressive safety culture can be achieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did these companies that we visited always start with this premise? The answer is no. They were no different 10, 15 or 20 years ago, ie,&nbsp;the framework changed the culture.&nbsp; If you like, it is like our anti-littering laws or queues in bus-stops. After a while, we internalised that culture and we have to start.&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo is spot-on when she says that the rate of industrial accidents would only fall significantly if all stakeholders in the work process have a safety culture.&nbsp; And this new framework will foster a change in culture and mindsets.&nbsp; It will take time but it can be done. The new framework will get all players moving in the right direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the legislation will facilitate this culture change.&nbsp; Members have asked how does the framework work.&nbsp; Legislation will facilitate this cultural change.&nbsp; It is not a paper exercise. We will replace the current Factories Act with the&nbsp;new Workplace Safety and Health Act later this year.&nbsp; This new Act will clearly define responsibilities and, more importantly, accountability. Simply put, those who create the risks&nbsp;will be held responsible to reduce the risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;The present liability regime is centred on the occupier of a factory or the main contractor of the construction worksite.&nbsp; And liability is only incidentally placed on other workplace parties such as employers, designers, suppliers, etc. When we change the law, we will expand this accountability framework following the regime in other developed countries. Every person at work then becomes responsible for his<p align=left>Column: 2280<p> own safety, for those under his charge and those he affects through his work.&nbsp; Let me just say that safety, after we change it, cannot be relegated to an&nbsp;after-thought or a staff function.&nbsp; It will become integral to every person's work and has to be part and parcel of the line functions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The construction industry, in particular, poses unique challenges to health and&nbsp;safety as each site involves many contractors, suppliers, designers, etc, for each phase of work.&nbsp; To further reduce and mitigate risks along the whole process chain, from design to maintenance, we will begin with the construction industry where we will require health and safety plans.&nbsp; The health and safety plan is an actionable plan.&nbsp; It tells me what you are going to do, with specific targets, taking into account the operational schedules of the project.&nbsp; These plans will be checked by qualified safety professionals to ensure comprehensiveness and compliance even before your project can get started.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo has urged me once again to extend the scope of the legislation to cover more industry sectors.&nbsp; I agree and&nbsp;the new Act will allow us to extend the coverage to all sectors in phases.&nbsp; The pace and timing will be decided in consultation with industry partners and unions and,&nbsp;sensibly, we will start with the sectors that have the most fatalities and accidents.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, self-regulation is the main tool to instil ownership.&nbsp; In order to build and ingrain a safety culture&nbsp;it&nbsp;would not evolve spontaneously.&nbsp; No country has seen it where businesses say, \"Let us be safety conscious.\"&nbsp; You really need a framework to ingrain this.&nbsp; And we will put in place the following structures to strengthen self-regulation:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, a Workplace Safety and Health Council with executive powers. The Council will comprise industry practitioners and it will set, continuously update<p align=left>Column: 2281<p> health and safety standards and practices for each industry sector.&nbsp; It will evaluate&nbsp;accidents when they occur and suggest new ways to improve. It will make safety records&nbsp;of employers available to the public and insurance companies. The Council, as I have said, will produce regular safety reports, provide more information to industry for their own self-regulation and track Singapore's progress in reducing our occupational fatality rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we have set those targets, they will not be forgotten because there will be someone putting up a report card every year, every quarter or every month.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we will&nbsp;mandate risk assessment safety management systems and health and safety plans.&nbsp; Workplaces will have to specify their safety outcomes, identify the risks, set out customised plans, systems and resources to mitigate the risks.&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo has called for legislation for safety management systems to be reviewed, to include workplaces other than those currently covered under the Factories Act.&nbsp; I agree.&nbsp; The Workplace Safety and Health Council will be tasked to identify the sectors that require this and recommend how it can be done effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, more responsibilities and powers for safety officers.&nbsp; MOM inspectors will leverage on the current system of safety officers to help detect and prevent safety problems. We will give safety officers more powers to stop work.&nbsp; If you think that it is really unsafe, stop it.&nbsp; Duty will also be placed on them to report certain lapses to the Ministry.&nbsp; So if they are fearful of stopping, tell us and we will stop it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Step up training and evaluation for workers on safety.&nbsp; I agree that this is integral.&nbsp; MOM will work with industries and unions to enable both foreign and local workers to have appropriate skills and knowledge to do their jobs safely.&nbsp;&nbsp;I <p align=left>Column: 2282<p>want to make it clear because Mdm Halimah has asked whether this means that we are pushing responsibility. The answer is an unequivocal no.&nbsp; I want to make it very clear that strengthening self-regulation and moving towards a goal setting legislation does not mean that we will leave it to industry to independently set up their own standards and practices.&nbsp; MOM, in consultation with the Workplace Safety and Health Council will have to set high standards in order to meet our aims of reducing fatalities.&nbsp; We will set the target and even the pace in consultation with them.&nbsp; But as much as Government wants or wishes to, we cannot improve safety standards alone.&nbsp; We have to get industry practitioners to take ownership and under this new system, management and workers must show proof that their safety plans and systems have adequately addressed and reduced risks at their workplaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither will self-regulation mean that MOM's involvement will be reduced.&nbsp; I want to categorically assure Members of this.&nbsp; Indeed, this new framework will require MOM to devote more resources to safety, as it must have.&nbsp; MOM will increase our enforcement force and build new capabilities.&nbsp; This is related to the third point that&nbsp;enforcement will have to keep pace with changes within the industry.&nbsp;MOM currently has 100 inspectors, regulating about 16,000 workplaces. I know some Members will be very quick to say, \"Why do you not increase to 10,000 inspectors and create jobs at the same time?\"&nbsp; We will increase it to what is practicable.&nbsp; But work processes have become more complex as we dig deeper and build higher and as technology and manufacturing and services advance. The range of chemicals, biological and other hazardous materials in use has also increased.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So in line with the new framework, our new enforcement philosophy will not only focus on non-compliance with technical requirements,&nbsp;instead we want to raise<p align=left>Column: 2283<p> the overall standard in partnership with industry, by helping workplaces identify their systemic weaknesses.&nbsp; We will also upgrade training of safety officers within the industry.&nbsp; We will need to set new performance benchmarks to professionalise this industry to help in our enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM officers will leverage on the network of safety officers to extend our reach to workplaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, as always, appropriate penalties can help shape behaviour.&nbsp; We should not only wait until an accident has happened before we impose hefty penalties or jail negligent offenders.&nbsp; This would put employers out of business, or cause employees to lose their jobs.&nbsp; While this may still be necessary to punish negligent persons, it occurs after the damage has been done.&nbsp; Rather, we would need to impose stiff penalties for workplaces with safety systems that are not up to the mark.&nbsp; This will help them to improve over time and prevent accidents.&nbsp; But I want to assure the House that we will calibrate our enforcement actions, including the use of composition fines, according to the circumstances of each case.&nbsp; While, as I have said,&nbsp;personal accountability will be strengthened, this will be done in a considered manner to ensure that the responsible parties who have taken reasonable steps need not be unduly alarmed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The intention is to punish, as Mdm Ho calls them, \"<I>bo chap</I>\" management that really do not put into place safety systems.&nbsp; For certain employers who are not quite \"<I>bo chap</I>\", which means \"don't care\", but rather \"<I>boey heow</I>\", \"don't know what to do\", and this may be in some small enterprises, we will ensure that there is sufficient expertise on the ground so that they too have no excuse not to comply.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2284<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think Mr Yeo Guat Kwang mentioned a particular aspect about SMEs and I agree that this is a particular sector that we may need to focus on because they&nbsp;just may not have the capability - a&nbsp; few men operation.&nbsp; We have looked at how other countries, which too have SMEs, have regulated it.&nbsp; There are a number of ways they could do it.&nbsp; We will actively reach out to SMEs. First, for example,&nbsp;companies that lack the resources, we will devise safety methods and practices, regulations and codes, that they could follow.&nbsp; Second, we will ensure that they are represented&nbsp;in the Workplace Safety and Health Council, so that they could take ownership.&nbsp; Third, we will ensure that there is effective training and information available to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In UK, for example, the Health and Safety Executive, the equivalent of our Workplace and Safety Health Council, employs mobile exhibits to go to these SMEs and teach them how to do it.&nbsp; Such measures could help to spread the OSH message.&nbsp; We will also study other options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employers in Singapore, as some Members have mentioned, would be concerned about how this new framework will affect business cost.&nbsp; As I said, for those that have spent time and resources building up good safety and health practices, I do not expect cost to be increased much.&nbsp; The new requirements will increase business cost for unsafe workplaces, as it should, because they should have paid attention to the poor safety management in the first place.&nbsp; These increased costs are necessary to safeguard lives and property.&nbsp; They would level the playing field for all companies to compete fairly for contracts.&nbsp; In other words, companies should get the message that when&nbsp;they bid for contracts, safety standards and practices cannot be compromised.&nbsp; This is the right way to do it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2285<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should we also build in incentives, as Mr Leong&nbsp;Horn Kee and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang have suggested?&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that is eminently sensible.&nbsp; As I mentioned, LTA&nbsp;already has this&nbsp;in principle.&nbsp; LTA has a safety performance scheme which rewards contractors with an additional 0.5% of the contract sum, subject to a cap of $1 million, if their safety performance&nbsp;and management are assessed up to the standards of expectation.&nbsp; So the principle has been set.&nbsp; It is already in practice.&nbsp; We should expand this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have so&nbsp;far concentrated more on employers' responsibility in my statement earlier this afternoon, and I want to balance this by enunciating the role of workers.&nbsp; Some Members have talked about&nbsp;training.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Swedes, when we visited them, shared an interesting observation with us, which is that,&nbsp;by and large, safety records of workers from a particular culture stay with their workers wherever the worker is working.&nbsp; For example, Swedish construction workers working in other countries carry their good Swedish safety records and culture with them, even though they may&nbsp;be working in a country with even less developed safety laws and where enforcement of the rules may be more lax.&nbsp; The point is that&nbsp;true success is not measured by the number of laws we enact, regulations we prescribe or how&nbsp;high the penalties are, but by the level to which safety standards are understood and internalised by those whose lives are at risk.&nbsp; In short, only if we achieve a change in the safety culture among our workers and even the foreign workers amongst us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I acknowledge Mdm Halimah's point that it is more difficult to inculcate a safety culture when a large proportion of the workforce is made up of foreign workers.&nbsp; As she said, there are language difficulties, different work custom practices, and they have been used to a different standard.&nbsp; But let me just say<p align=left>Column: 2286<p> this.&nbsp; Whether they have been used to low standards makes no difference.&nbsp; If the building collapses, people would be&nbsp;injured or killed.&nbsp; If accidents&nbsp;occur, all who are in the path get injured.&nbsp; So we must ensure the safety and health of every worker, and this is possible.&nbsp; Some construction companies in Singapore, like Foster Wheeler, have very good safety records.&nbsp; They operate in Singapore with foreign workers, have a very high percentage of foreign workers and they are able to do better than other companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members, especially the labour MPs&nbsp;and NMPs, have asked for more focus on developing our workers.&nbsp; I agree.&nbsp; For this, I would want to seek their active involvement, with the support of unions and other employee organisations to educate their workers, not only on the technical aspects, but also&nbsp;their right to a safe environment and their responsibility not to endanger the lives of others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry will look at ways to encourage employers to keep more experienced and skilled workers who have the proper attitudes towards workplace safety.&nbsp; Mdm Ho asked whether we could entrench the union's right to participate in Safety Committees.&nbsp; She wanted an elaboration of section 72.&nbsp; The principle in section 72 is that workers need to be on the Safety Committee, and I think that is right.&nbsp; It has been silent on unions because it has taken the larger framework of workers, unionised or not.&nbsp; I think on principle, that is correct.&nbsp; Even the unionists would agree with me.&nbsp; Even for those who are not in the unions, they do not say that they should have less rights.&nbsp; They are saying that they could represent their rights better.&nbsp; All workers should have equal rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, employees are given the right to nominate their representatives in the Safety Committee.&nbsp; And for workplaces that have unions, I think it makes eminent sense that the unionists should<p align=left>Column: 2287<p> be on the committee since they would be more effective in mobilising other employees in disseminating important information.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would strongly encourage this.&nbsp; But for the Act, it rightly is principled that workers need to be represented.&nbsp; As mentioned, we will step up training and evaluation for both local and foreign workers to ensure that they have a satisfactory level of safety knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For specific work processes where workers need to handle combustible or potentially explosive materials, mandatory safety courses and tests would be required.&nbsp; For this, I hope that the unions&nbsp;will take a more proactive role in safety training and testing.&nbsp; With their wide reach to members which cover the entire span of industries in Singapore, I feel that they are ideally positioned to perform this effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have set a time frame of 10 years to halve our occupational fatality rate.&nbsp; Some Members say, \"Why so timid?&nbsp; Why not move faster?&nbsp; Can we achieve it earlier?\"&nbsp; I sincerely hope so.&nbsp; But realistically, as I said, these radical changes in our framework will take time to filter through the entire system.&nbsp; As Mdm Ho Geok Choo says, \"We are all used to an instantaneous culture\".&nbsp; I would not underestimate the challenges.&nbsp; I have given you some examples.&nbsp; Until and unless I can reach to that last small factory in the Toa Payoh Industrial Park, to get them to change, where there were four deaths, it would occur and it may occur again, unless we get them to internalise.&nbsp; So, yes, I, above all, want this to become a reality.&nbsp; Realistically, this time frame helps us to match and to evaluate our progress.&nbsp; I certainly hope we could do this faster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at our past record, we took more than 10 years to halve our industrial accident frequency rates to&nbsp;what we have today.&nbsp; The top European countries, as I mentioned, took 30 years, much longer.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2288<p>And to halve our current occupational fatality rate within 10 years is a stretched target.&nbsp; But I agree with Members fully that we need to improve our safety standards as quickly as possible to prevent the further loss of precious lives.&nbsp; I am confident, as we have done to meet many other challenges in the past, with the collective efforts of employers and unions, we will succeed.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

But in 2001 and 2002, it was still difficult but they somehow managed to get a job.&nbsp; Right now, it is much better. Most of the graduates managed to secure a job within&nbsp;six months of their graduation.&nbsp; They have a lot of chances to be called up for interviews.&nbsp; To Dr Lim who wrote more than 1,000 letters without receiving a reply, I would like to console her.&nbsp; I have a resident who came to see me at the meet-the-people session and told me that she had written some 1,000-2,000 letters, yet remained unemployed for 2 1/2 years.&nbsp; Last month, I met her and I asked her whether she had found a job. &nbsp;She replied in the negative.&nbsp; But she<p align=left>Column: 2289<p> managed a smile and said that the situation seems to have become better.&nbsp; She was, at least, called up for interview on several occasions.&nbsp; She has not come back to see me nowadays and I believe she must have found a job already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the economic situation is in a better stage now and I think credit must be given to the Government, NTUC, the Minister for Manpower and his officers for all the good things they have done.&nbsp; I am quite sure our&nbsp; Minister has a lot of tricks under his sleeves. He would have all sorts of&nbsp; measures to improve the situation even further.&nbsp; In fact, there are a lot of professionals in the 40s and 50s who are not without skills or experience, and&nbsp;yet are retrenched.&nbsp; It is a bit more difficult for them to find alternative jobs.&nbsp; Does the Minister have any policy to help them?&nbsp; They are specialists.&nbsp; They do not need to be retrained.&nbsp; They just need the opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, I would like to ask the Minister what is the projected unemployment rate this year. Dr Lim said that she wanted to return to Australia, but even advanced countries like Australia do not enjoy good employment rate, even though their economy is not bad. Their unemployment rate is about 6-7%.&nbsp; In Singapore, the unemployment rate is just 3-4%.&nbsp; I would like to know what is likely to be the unemployment rate in Singapore this year.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, experience tells us that, as the economy progresses, there is always a group of people who find it difficult to catch up in their workplace or rejoin the workforce.&nbsp; A man-in-the-street would tell you that this is not a new problem.&nbsp; It has been in existence since a long time ago, but it is just that the situation is more acute now.&nbsp; He would tell me, \"My father used to tell me the same problem.&nbsp; As you get older you tend to be<p align=left>Column: 2290<p> slower in all aspects.&nbsp; You are not as agile and as skilful as the young people, and yet you are more expensive.&nbsp; Of course, the boss does not want to employ you any more.&nbsp; So what can we do?&nbsp; This is life!\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it is better to have some money in the pocket now because you do not know when you will be retrenched or retired. &nbsp;As the Chinese used to say, \"The waves at the back push the waves in front ahead\", or as the older worker would say, \u201cThe world today belongs to the young.\"&nbsp; In fact, older workers of every generation will say the same thing.&nbsp; I think we all take turns to say this as we grow older.&nbsp; So as our economy becomes more competitive and the pace of change faster, structural unemployment will become a serious problem, as it is the case now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the same group of workers -&nbsp;the older, less competitive and yet more expensive ones who are reaching the age of late 40s and early 50s.&nbsp; The less educated or skilful ones are the most vulnerable workers.&nbsp; If the pace of change continues to quicken, structural unemployment would happen even to younger workers in the early 40s and late 30s.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the rank-and-file workers, the Re-employment Assistance Programme (REAP) and the ComCare Fund introduced by the Government in January this year are important programmes to know.&nbsp; I think more efforts are required to publicise these programmes so that they can really serve their purpose.&nbsp; There are basically three ways to tackle the structural unemployment problem.&nbsp; First, we must find good jobs locally, and not just those low-end jobs, that would suit the physical conditions of older workers.&nbsp; At the moment, we have identified 12 areas where the jobs could be redesigned to suit the older workers.&nbsp; I think this is a move in the right direction.&nbsp; Secondly, we need to work with the employers to redesign <p align=left>Column: 2291<p>these jobs so that they will pay better. &nbsp;Thirdly, we should also consider whether the pay of these jobs is adequate for the workers to meet their basic family expenses.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Many of these retrenchments happened during the economic recession when<p align=left>Column: 2292<p> many companies down sized, right sized or relocated their operations to lower-cost regions.&nbsp; Although a significant number of such unemployed workers came from manufacturing, no segment was spared. Blue and white-collar jobs, production operators to senior managers, younger and older workers, both local and foreign, were affected.&nbsp; So the WDA now serves as a new age adult education board, an agency that we had in the earlier time.&nbsp; Would the Minister for Manpower enlighten us how has the WDA performed since its inception and share where it has met with good success and where it faces challenges?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while the recent past job losses arose from global economic conditions affecting MNCs and their local supply partners causing many to shed parts of their workforces, I anticipate that the future structure of the economy in Singapore will be one weighted&nbsp;less&nbsp;on&nbsp;MNCs and more towards local companies.&nbsp; Under this scenario, many more Singaporeans will be working in local companies, many of them starting life as young entrepreneur-led profit-seeking organisations.&nbsp; By their very nature, they will have to develop their own business systems largely from scratch, not imported from parent headquarters as the foreign MNCs gave us in the 70s and 80s.&nbsp; Singapore companies will also have to learn to grow from small to medium to large, learn to address domestic, then regional, then global markets, and learn to handle the key functions of business, manufacturing, marketing, product development, logistics, administration, etc.&nbsp; In a very real sense, Singapore will be forced to remake its economy at the firm level and redevelop all these company skills again.&nbsp; It is going to get worse before it gets better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The training needs of Singaporean workers will shift from training provided by larger companies to training where the individual employee has to do more by<p align=left>Column: 2293<p> himself or herself.&nbsp; Our manpower training expenditure experience clearly shows that large firms which have mostly been MNCs, GLCs, publicly-listed local companies and the Government agencies themselves are the better people developers, spending more per head count than smaller local companies.&nbsp; We need to anticipate this possible change in the structure of the manpower scenario of the future.&nbsp; Is it therefore possible that the WDA and other private and public training agencies will have to deal not just with training of more mature displaced workers like now but also new job entrants and even management staff&nbsp;as well?&nbsp; I wish to ask the Minister whether MOM has begun to anticipate what would be the future strategies and areas of emphasis for WDA, and how&nbsp;we can use the opportunity to enhance the success of entrepreneurship in Singapore.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, the Prime Minister stated on Sunday that, going forward, we must expect higher unemployment, amidst a backdrop&nbsp;of&nbsp;loss of 5,500 jobs from Maxtor.&nbsp; The economic growth of the past&nbsp;brought jobs and sense of security.&nbsp; The economic growth of the present brings structural unemployment and fear.&nbsp; To put things in another perspective, the job losses in Maxtor in one day in 2005 equal almost 50% of the total job losses in the previous year 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to seek clarification on MOM's report on the employment and manpower situation.&nbsp; It was stated that&nbsp;a total of 66,200 jobs were created in 2004, according to MOM's preliminary estimates.&nbsp; However, it was also estimated that many of the jobs created which grew to 23,300 in the final quarter of 2004<p align=left>Column: 2294<p> were in services and were due to seasonal hiring.&nbsp; I would like to know how much of the job growth will disappear once the seasonal hiring&nbsp;is over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, we all recognise that older and lower-educated workers are most vulnerable to retrenchment and structural unemployment.&nbsp; We also know that training plays an important role in re-employment.&nbsp; However, in the 2004 labour survey findings, there&nbsp;were a number of factors that&nbsp;were considered as motivations or barriers to older workers' participation in skills training.&nbsp; Some of the factors are affordability of fees, location of training centres, information on the courses, convenience of the time of the courses, relevance of the course to the improvement of their career prospects, pace of the course and, more importantly, also the language used in the training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what measures have been taken so far to mitigate the adverse factors of taking up training and to address the needs of the older workers.&nbsp; Sir, these older workers in the 80s and early 90s helped to build the Singapore that we have today.&nbsp; We owe them much more than to leave them to the fate of the market.&nbsp; If creating opportunity is to mean anything beyond political platitudes, it must mean more employment opportunities for this particular group of Singaporeans.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seng Han Thong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In the case of the foreign worker levy, it is just impossible to please anyone.&nbsp; If the levy goes up, employers will complain about business cost going up.&nbsp; If it is adjusted downwards, workers are concerned that their jobs will go to foreigners.&nbsp; PM Lee has assured this House that even if the new $500 levy for companies exceeds the current ratio, there would be a limit in the&nbsp;new<p align=left>Column: 2295<p>dependency ratio.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;is this latest increase of foreign worker levy too soon, as the employers claim?&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, it is not an issue of timing.&nbsp; It is a question of whether we have enough local skilled workers. If we do not, then employers should be allowed to get more foreigners, as they are here to create growth and jobs.&nbsp; If we do have enough skilled workers, then employers should simply employ local workers rather than foreign workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the real issue is this.&nbsp; There are jobs,&nbsp;but there are not enough skilled workers in certain sectors.&nbsp; And there are the unemployed who cannot find a job in any sector.&nbsp; We call this a \"skill gap\".&nbsp; In Chinese, it is said, <I>you ren mei&nbsp;zuo gong, you gong mei ren zuo.&nbsp;</I> Thus, NTUC, with its tripartite partners, has embarked on&nbsp; work redesign and work recreate, so that there are more jobs available for Singaporeans, especially the unemployed.&nbsp; So the theme of&nbsp;NTUC May Day celebrations this year is \"Creating Opportunities for More Jobs\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To create opportunities, we need to be creative and flexible.&nbsp; In this respect, I must commend the good work done by the Singapore Teachers Union together with the WDA.&nbsp; With their concerted efforts, creativity and flexibility, the Teacher Assistant Scheme has been launched, and 74 older unemployed Singaporeans have been trained to be Teacher Assistants, and they are being placed&nbsp;at schools near their homes.&nbsp; This is a good example to show that as long as we have a heart to help Singaporeans find jobs, jobs can be created.&nbsp; If we continue to be creative, if workers continue to be flexible, more jobs could be redesigned and recreated.&nbsp; Then the foreign worker levy will not be such a sensational issue at all.&nbsp; It will&nbsp;just be a simple issue of supply and demand.&nbsp; Thus, I would like to urge the WDA to continue to be flexible<p align=left>Column: 2296<p> and creative, and work closely with the unions so that more jobs could be created for Singaporeans.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> Sir, here, I would like to declare that I work in the MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) industry.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, foreign workers have either unique skills that are not readily available or they take on jobs that Singaporeans shun.&nbsp; Nonetheless, given a choice, companies would prefer to hire locals, because they do not have to comply with complex and time-consuming immigration procedures.&nbsp; I note that the underlying purposes of the foreign worker levy are really to control the number of foreigners in Singapore and to prevent the foreign workers from depressing wages of Singaporeans.&nbsp; However, there are many companies, more specifically in the aviation industry, that are highly dependent upon specialists from overseas.&nbsp; These might include aircraft technicians and engineers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the MRO industry, the skilled aviation personnel from overseas will help the booming aerospace companies to meet their increased manpower needs and grow their business.&nbsp; At the same time, such an interim measure will allow MRO companies to hire the locals who meet the criteria and train them to be aircraft technicians or engineers.&nbsp; Therefore, for an exclusive sector like the MRO with its special requirements, there is a void at the moment with regard to local talent and where wages are not low for skilled talents.&nbsp; I hope&nbsp;MOM will review its policy on the foreign worker levy for this group differently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to ensure that there is no abuse, the MRO companies can be monitored to ensure that efforts are made to train up locals to fill the vacancies.&nbsp; The problem is that the gestation for training up a competent aviation skilled talent takes a long time.&nbsp; It takes about 1-3 years to train<p align=left>Column: 2297<p> technicians and engineers to become skilled aircraft technicians and engineers respectively.&nbsp; Following this, they will have to undergo at least six months OJT before they are fully competent.&nbsp; Hence, for companies that have rapid expansion plans, the reliance&nbsp;on immediate foreign specialists is extremely acute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MRO companies are looking into various innovative ways of churning out skilled personnel.&nbsp; In this instance, it takes the form of wooing polytechnic and ITE graduates to apply for these positions with the promise of putting them through inhouse programmes to train them up for the necessary skills.&nbsp; Another way is to tie up with ITE and polytechnics for tailor-made syllabus that would train interested students for a career in the MRO industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some companies even go to the extent of providing scholarship for their final year programme.&nbsp; Attempts are also made to convince CAAS on the need to waive certain requirements for additional examination type courses that CAAS typically administers before issuance of any certification or licence to these personnel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is&nbsp;a whole host of options that MRO companies have tried to beef up our local talents for these jobs in the MRO industry.&nbsp; But to-date, we have seen little success because of the tough environment that these jobs reside in.&nbsp; Here, I would like to call on the agencies to do more in terms of financial support for the conversion training of local personnel.&nbsp; Although there are various programmes in place, unfortunately, they come with various conditions that make it difficult for the MRO companies to tap them.&nbsp; For example, schemes are targeted at building&nbsp;up skills in cutting-edge technology, rather than in training new entrants on the specific skills set required by the MRO companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am heartened that WDA, EDB and the Association of Aerospace<p align=left>Column: 2298<p> Industries (Singapore) have formed a partnership to drive&nbsp;local workforce development in the aerospace industry in April last year.&nbsp; However, given the long lead time to train skilled workers and until we find a solution locally, there is need for foreign talents for this particular industry.&nbsp; So the decision to increase the foreign worker levy from $50 to $80, eventually rising to $100, as well as the higher levy of $500 for companies that exceed the dependency quota, will have an impact on the business cost&nbsp;of these companies.&nbsp; These industries contribute to Singapore's GDP.&nbsp; The imposed levy hikes&nbsp;will&nbsp; undermine their profit margins.&nbsp; For these reasons, I would like to propose that the levy should not be imposed across the board.&nbsp; Instead, I would urge the Government to consider a fencing-out approach as an alternative to raising the foreign worker levy across as a blanket policy.&nbsp; This would mean that for such companies: (a)&nbsp;the total increase in the levy hike could be spread out over 3-5 years so as to enable these companies to better cope with the increase and to identify locals to be trained up; and (b) the 'exceed quota' dependency levy of $500 to be waived for these companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, I strongly</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Members have asked what the Government can do to help Singaporeans overcome these challenges as well as provide information on what opportunities exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2299<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let me thank&nbsp;Assoc. Prof.&nbsp;Koo Tsai Kee for his comments.&nbsp; He was optimistic and rightly so.&nbsp; Because I agree with him that while competition is tougher with globalisation, Singaporeans can face the future with optimism.&nbsp; The good news is that the sacrifices we have made through wage restructuring and CPF cuts have made&nbsp;the difference.&nbsp; It has not been a jobless recovery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked for the data on local and foreign employment changes for the past five years, and I have circulated the charts.&nbsp; I think it would be instructive.&nbsp; Because the figures over the last few years tell us at the macro economic level, what has been going on and&nbsp;what our policies have been doing.&nbsp; Many Members&nbsp;in this House would agree that 1998 to 2004 were not exactly easy years.&nbsp; They were difficult years.&nbsp; But even through this difficult period, net jobs were added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Mr Low Thia Khiang says, the preliminary estimates show that our overall employment in 2004 grew by 66,200 jobs.&nbsp; Locals took up two-thirds of these jobs, while the remaining one-third went to foreigners.&nbsp; As you can see in the graph,&nbsp;total employment went up: from 1999, local employment went up; foreign employment went down.&nbsp; These trends indicate that our policies, including our foreign worker policy, are working -&nbsp;jobs have been created for Singaporeans.&nbsp; As the chart shows, this is due to a large part through our judicious use of foreign workers, which means that, in difficult times,&nbsp;as less foreign workers were needed, their population shrank; while the local workforce, if you see in the chart, continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace. &nbsp;So even in 1999 to 2002, the local workforce grew.&nbsp; As Members remember, there was September 11, the Bali bomb blast, SARS.&nbsp; Even through these difficult periods, there was net employment<p align=left>Column: 2300<p> creation for locals.&nbsp; Foreigners took the brunt of job losses.&nbsp; When the economy rebounded, it allowed companies access to foreign workers&nbsp;to meet demand.&nbsp; So in both difficult and good economic circumstances, the majority of jobs went to Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall unemployment has now also fallen to 3.7% as at December last year.&nbsp; This is a substantial improvement from the peak of 5.7% in September 2003. &nbsp;We have mentioned that&nbsp;consistently they are&nbsp;preliminary estimates.&nbsp; But the labour report will come out as per international convention,&nbsp;not later than 15th March, where&nbsp;we will&nbsp;show that&nbsp;improvements were generally across the board, affecting most age and educational groups.&nbsp; Even for the elderly, whom we keep speaking about, unemployment has fallen across the board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September last year, job vacancies rose to a three-and-a-half year high. &nbsp;Private sector companies that were surveyed had about 18,900 job vacancies.&nbsp; This was about 5,800 more jobs compared to&nbsp;a year ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, our&nbsp;school leavers this year have found jobs soon after graduation and starting salaries have been maintained.&nbsp;Many of you would have read this. &nbsp;Last year, 91% of our polytechnic graduates found employment within&nbsp;six months of completing their examinations.&nbsp; Their average monthly starting salary for full-time permanent employment was about $1,620.&nbsp; This&nbsp;has been maintained.&nbsp; Our ITE students fared extremely well. 84% found employment within&nbsp;three months of completing their examinations, and had an average monthly starting salary of $1,200.&nbsp; Graduates&nbsp;from our universities are also getting employed faster.&nbsp; About 90% of NUS and NTU graduates have already found jobs, with starting salaries of about $2,370 for NUS and $2,500 for NTU graduates.&nbsp; As for SMU, it reported that its entire first<p align=left>Column: 2301<p>  graduating cohort (100%) had found work.&nbsp; So the improved labour market has filtered down to employment opportunities and the numbers are real.&nbsp; It has not&nbsp;been a&nbsp;jobless recovery.&nbsp; Singaporeans have benefited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These positive results, even in difficult years, tell us that our labour policies have been flexible enough to adapt to economic challenges. But it is never a perfect formula.&nbsp; As Mr Seng Han Thong says, whatever you do, you are going to make somebody less happy.&nbsp; And, indeed, it is the nature of the game.&nbsp; Because from time to time, we will have to adjust the levies and quotas to maintain this fine balance, and it is a very fine balance&nbsp;of access to foreign workers and maintaining jobs for Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some MPs have voiced opposite camps, as I expect.&nbsp; In fact, I would be worried if too much in one camp was happy.&nbsp; That tells me that there is&nbsp;imbalance.&nbsp; Whenever I change, I hope both sides would be equally happy or unhappy.&nbsp; That will tell me that the balance has been achieved.&nbsp; Some MPs have voiced concerns&nbsp;during&nbsp;the Budget Debate about the announced levy increases -&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;Wang Kai Yuen, Dr Ahmad&nbsp;Magad, Dr Teo Ho Pin, Mr Lawrence Leow, Mr Chiam See Tong and Mdm Ho Geok Choo who just spoke during her COS cut -&nbsp;fearing that this will dampen our economic recovery.&nbsp; Others have said that it is too much of a liberalisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to assure this House that the increase is justified and will not affect our recovery.&nbsp; I really do not want to get into a debate about whether our foreign workers add or subtract.&nbsp; The foreign worker levy and quotas are meant to regulate numbers.&nbsp; It is a macro economic tool.&nbsp; And following the footsteps of the Minister for Health, I try not to micro&nbsp;manage as well.&nbsp; We are macro managers.&nbsp; In 2004, the stock of work permit holders increased by slightly above 4% whereas local workers increased by just below 3%.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2302<p> In short, we have more foreign work permit holders and it is&nbsp;&nbsp;growing faster than local workers.&nbsp; You can say that at the individual level, economy is patchy and&nbsp;recovery is patchy.&nbsp; But at the aggregated level, there is more demand, which means that&nbsp;as the rate of growth&nbsp;of work permit holders has been growing faster than local workers, it is timely to restore the foreign worker levy.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will promote the productive use of work permits.&nbsp; Otherwise, the total number will rise disproportionately as employers bring in more foreign workers than they need. &nbsp;Local wages, as Mdm Ho Geok Choo rightly pointed out,&nbsp;will be affected.&nbsp; If you have greater access because they are cheaper, it must drive down all wages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the increase will be graduated, as we announced, from $50 to $80 on 1st July 2005, and, subsequently, to $100 on 1st January 2006, to allow time for companies to adjust.&nbsp; I would like to remind Members, who&nbsp;have quickly forgotten, that this increase is a partial restoration to previous levels.&nbsp; The skilled levy rate was $200 in 1996.&nbsp; This rate was reduced substantially in 1998, again in 1999,&nbsp;to help companies tide over the economic downturn.&nbsp; But our economy grew by over 8% last year.&nbsp; And&nbsp;this new total levy that companies have to pay after the increase remains a small percentage of overall business operating costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo&nbsp;suggested that&nbsp;we should&nbsp;not impose the levy on certain sectors.&nbsp; As I said, this is a macro economic tool.&nbsp; It is not for Government to decide which sector should benefit.&nbsp; All sectors, I am sure, and indeed all companies, can justify that they needed more than company B, and therefore we should help them.&nbsp; It is difficult.&nbsp; We have other schemes to try to help, but it is certainly not through the levy.&nbsp; I understand her passion for the aerospace industry, as she calls it the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) industry, and I recognise their problems.&nbsp; We will work with them <p align=left>Column: 2303<p>to ensure that there is a steady pipeline of local workers who can fill these jobs.&nbsp; Because these industries are growth industries, and she is quite right,&nbsp;it is important to our GDP.&nbsp; But it also represents a very viable career choice, a long-term career choice for Singaporeans.&nbsp; It is high-tech, high value, high earning, high skills, that all these four attributes spelt to me - Singaporean, Singaporean, Singaporean, Singaporean.&nbsp; So when we started the industry&nbsp;and we did not have workers to do this, we allowed these companies to bring in foreign workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some companies brought in as many as 90% foreign workers.&nbsp; It was a special dispensation to be given for a specific time.&nbsp; But as in most things, what is given is considered an entitlement, and when you want to claw it back, albeit at a very snail pace, there is much noise.&nbsp;We started training polytechnic graduates for this industry many years ago.&nbsp; And I am happy to report that those graduates will be graduating soon. &nbsp;I think the first batch is graduating this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept that it will take an even longer time to help them have the experience.&nbsp; But we must start so that it represents viable opportunity choices for Singaporeans.&nbsp; Yes, we will work with her.&nbsp; She mentioned the&nbsp;partnership scheme, where EDB, WDA, the&nbsp;industries and professional organisations work together.&nbsp; But let us see how we can make this a viable career choice for Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also elaborate on the changes which the Prime Minister had announced in his Budget Statement: in allowing companies to hire workers beyond the current dependency ceiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some MPs have asked for clarification on this higher levy of $500,&nbsp;which Mr Seng Han Thong has also brought up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I want to explain to Members and the public&nbsp;that this specific change of $500 is not to allow, at a broader scale,<p align=left>Column: 2304<p>  all companies more foreign workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The operative words&nbsp;&nbsp;are &nbsp;\"all companies\",&nbsp;\"more foreign workers\". &nbsp;It is really to allow those companies who have reached their current ceiling, what we call the dependency ceiling (DC), to respond to surges in demand.&nbsp; We are not liberalising our foreign worker policy.&nbsp; As I said, it works well. &nbsp;We will maintain that fine balance.&nbsp; We are upping the levy and that is on a broader scale.&nbsp; But for specific companies that need more workers&nbsp;than anticipated,&nbsp;under the old scheme, what happened?&nbsp; Under the old scheme, we set, let us say, for manufacturing,&nbsp;a dependency ceiling of 50%;&nbsp;in other words, if you have 50 local workers, you can hire 50 foreign workers, (50:50).&nbsp; If you reach that limit and suddenly your business is good -&nbsp;nobody has predicted that the electronics sector does well -&nbsp;you&nbsp;apply for more foreign workers because it is hard to get local workers or for whatever the reason,&nbsp;under the old scheme we&nbsp;say \"no\".&nbsp; You can remonstrate, jump up and down, we just say \"no\".&nbsp; Or we say \"yes\", but it would be&nbsp;after a laborious process where the company would lobby many agencies, justify with&nbsp;thick letters why they need it; how they&nbsp;are important to the GDP, which we agree; and how it would bring more jobs to the locals, which we agree.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it would be a very reluctant \"yes\",&nbsp;because we knew once we said \"yes\" to one company, others could equally justify their needs.&nbsp; It wasted a lot of time, not only of the parties involved, but also of the companies and&nbsp;economic agencies.&nbsp; So I do not think it is a good system. Even after that laborious process, few companies were allowed to hire foreign workers beyond the DC.&nbsp; So they just could not meet business demand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So instead of this cumbersome system, MOM has decided to use the $500 levy to control the use beyond our current DC.&nbsp; In other words, there is no need to justify.&nbsp; I will just set it at a higher price.&nbsp; If you really need it, then I will give<p align=left>Column: 2305<p>  it to you, but you&nbsp;pay this higher price. &nbsp;In other words, companies that really need it will pay and use it because the demand may be temporary.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this increase&nbsp;is not&nbsp;unlimited.&nbsp; From 1st July, the new dependency ceiling (DC) will go up to 60% for manufacturing companies, which&nbsp;is now&nbsp;50%. &nbsp;The DC for services companies will&nbsp;go up to 40%,&nbsp;which is now&nbsp;30%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, there will be a new higher tier above the existing DC. If you are not already confused, I will confuse you even more later.&nbsp; But let me try to explain to&nbsp;Members simply.&nbsp; Companies which have not reached the current dependency ceiling, whether&nbsp;they are in the manufacturing or services sector, &nbsp;will not be affected by this $500 levy. &nbsp;In other words, they will just be subjected to the new $80 or $100 skilled levy. &nbsp;Currently, some 93% of manufacturing companies and 75% of service companies who hire work permit holders are operating under&nbsp;their DC.&nbsp; In other words, even if you say&nbsp;50% for manufacturing companies and 30% for service companies,&nbsp;they hire workers way below their DC.&nbsp;&nbsp;So the $500 levy will not affect them at all. They still have some capacity and they only pay the new&nbsp;levy, whether it is $80 or $100, which the chart shows.&nbsp; The higher levy only&nbsp;affects the remaining companies that are operating currently at their DC&nbsp;and wish&nbsp;to take&nbsp;on more work permit holders.&nbsp; So if you want to go beyond, as the chart shows, for those extra, you pay $500. Some businesses say, \"Well, 50-60% or 30-40%, this is a very small increase.&nbsp; You load a high levy and yet you don't give us increase in capacity.\"&nbsp; This is where I have to explain patiently using Singapore new Mathematics.&nbsp; You know that we are No. 1 in the world, and I come from the Ministry of Education,&nbsp;so I will explain it to you.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 10% increase in DC actually translates to a potential increase of 50% in foreign workers.&nbsp; I will give you some time to absorb that.&nbsp; This is new Mathematics.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2306<p>  If you look at the chart, the DC&nbsp;reflects the number of foreign work permit holders that a company can hire as a percentage of its total workforce.&nbsp; So, if the DC now is 50%, you can hire 50 foreign workers for 50 local workers.&nbsp; When you say it is 60%, you can actually hire 75 work permit holders, the lower bar, because your workforce is now 125.&nbsp; If you do your Mathematics, 75 divided by 125 is 60%.&nbsp; It is no sleight of hand, it is true Mathematics.&nbsp; But I can well understand why if&nbsp;Members say this is quite hard to understand.&nbsp; And I agree with you that dependency ratios are actually easier, which means that manufacturing companies now with a DC of 50%, the dependency ratio is one to one, ie, you can hire one foreign worker for one local worker.&nbsp; When we change it to 60%, it is 1.5 to 1, a 50% increase.&nbsp; Henceforth, we will change the dependency ratios, because we really do not need to be exercising our minds about ratios and then have to do extrapolations.&nbsp; It will give us a clearer picture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as I said, the raised skilled levy to $100 is to control the numbers; $500 is to give the flexibility.&nbsp; We are doing this because business cycles have become less predictable.&nbsp; Companies need greater flexibility to take advantage of new opportunities quickly.&nbsp; Ensuring that employers&nbsp;get the skilled manpower that they need - which is the point that Mr Seng Han Thong made -&nbsp;will, in turn, help create more jobs for Singaporeans over time when businesses grow.&nbsp; Is the $500 levy cast in stone?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; As the PM mentioned, it is to control numbers.&nbsp; We will watch what happens.&nbsp; If too many people use it and our foreign worker population grows rapidly, we will increase it.&nbsp; If we find that nobody uses it, then it is a wrong figure and we may have to reduce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raised DC only affects&nbsp;the manufacturing and services sectors.&nbsp; The marine industry is not affected because&nbsp;it already has a&nbsp;higher dependency ratio.&nbsp; It can hire three foreign workers for every one local<p align=left>Column: 2307<p>  worker it employs.&nbsp; For construction, the dependency&nbsp;ratio is 1:4.&nbsp; They can hire four foreign workers for every one local worker they hire.&nbsp; But for construction, the main limitation has been&nbsp;the man-year entitlement (MYE) system, which Mdm Cynthia Phua talked about in the Budget debate.&nbsp; She said it was too restrictive and rigid, and we are making it too difficult.&nbsp; You set a quota and companies cannot respond.&nbsp; I agree with her.&nbsp; I have therefore decided to loosen controls to allow the construction industry better use of their manpower resource.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, contractors need to produce MYEs when they renew the work permits of their existing workers or when they take over workers from other contractors, even if these workers have existing work permits.&nbsp; With effect from 1st April 2005:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Contractors will no longer need MYEs when they renew the work permits of foreign workers who have worked with them for six or more years.&nbsp; In other words, the MYE system will be lifted for this particular group of skilled workers who have worked for them for six years or more.&nbsp; They do not require MYEs.&nbsp; The renewal will be capped at one year at a time, and restricted to those involved in on-going projects.&nbsp; The reason is that this will&nbsp;help the industry to retain a core group of experienced and skilled workers, which would also contribute to better safety in the construction sector.&nbsp; A trained worker is a safer worker.&nbsp; Going one step further, in line with this philosophy, MOM will also no longer allow the employment of unskilled foreign workers in the construction sector, with effect from 1st December 2005.&nbsp; The impact on the sector will be very&nbsp;small, since the vast majority of the construction workers now, ie,&nbsp;97%,&nbsp;are already skilled.&nbsp; So, we are just saying, it is only&nbsp;3%, you do not need the unskilled workers, let them all be skilled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2308<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also allow contractors to take on transferred workers - which we did not allow before - ie,&nbsp;change employers for the remaining validity period of the work permits.&nbsp; When they take on these transferred workers, no&nbsp;new MYEs will be required from the employer receiving the workers under the transfer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;We will allow contractors to temporarily \"loan\" their foreign workers to other contractors during lull periods, that is, there is no change of employer in this case, they can work for another employer.&nbsp; Workers must consent to this arrangement and&nbsp;be paid accordingly, and must be involved only in construction work. Their official employer remains responsible for their management, housing, salary, well-being and levy.&nbsp; In other words, we will allow this only if the worker agrees.&nbsp; The idea is, once you are in the system and you want to work for another employer because this employer has a lull in his business, we should allow it; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;Contractors can use up all the MYEs allocated to them for a project as long as the construction project is still on-going.&nbsp; Previously, MYEs expired three months before the end of the project.&nbsp; This will no longer be the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am well aware that reducing upfront these rules to allow industries to utilise manpower more efficiently is the right thing to do. But there are concerns about the potential abuse of the system.&nbsp; These changes are to allow optimal use of manpower.&nbsp; I think it will benefit us all.&nbsp; There probably will be no disagreement on this.&nbsp; But I would like to caution those who abuse these relaxations and illegally deploy construction foreign workers into other sectors.&nbsp; In line with these changes, my Ministry will&nbsp;double the size of our enforcement team from about 70 officers to about 130 in the coming financial year.&nbsp; MOM will intensify its enforcement efforts to police deployment of construction <p align=left>Column: 2309<p> workers outside the sector and contractors who violate the law will be taken to task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me categorically say we will not hesitate to punish errant contractors.&nbsp; Current penalties, I would like to remind everyone,&nbsp;include a lifetime ban from employing foreign workers - what it means is that you might as well give up the industry if you are in it - fines and jail sentences.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to urge contractors that the well-being of foreign workers&nbsp;needs to be ensured.&nbsp; Salaries must be paid on time, and their well-being looked after.&nbsp; In tandem, MOM will educate construction foreign workers on their rights and act on complaints.&nbsp; We will increase their accessibility to tell them which numbers they can call and, as I said, let me reiterate, we will not hesitate to punish contractors who abuse their workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I like&nbsp;now to move on to medium and long-term challenges which Members have brought up.&nbsp; While our present policies have helped us ride through these&nbsp;difficult years, we need to prepare now to face future challenges.&nbsp; Members have asked for projections.&nbsp; Prof. Koo Tsai Kee asked what is the long-term and medium-term outlook like.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after taking into account the unemployment peak in 2003 due to SARS, we still averaged about 3.4% over the period 1997-2003 - those were difficult times - lower than other developed or developing countries. &nbsp;If you look at the chart - compared to other developed countries -&nbsp;Taiwan, at&nbsp;3.7%, is higher than us; even in this difficult period, USA,&nbsp;UK, Hong Kong.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind Members that the specific circumstances which hit Singapore and Singapore only and spared the other countries, and even in that context, Singapore did fairly well in comparison.&nbsp; Over time, as our economy experiences technology-driven productivity improvements, and shifts to higher<p align=left>Column: 2310<p>  value-add activities, we will require fewer but more skilled workers.&nbsp; It is the nature of our industries.&nbsp; Other developed and developing economies have also faced the same situation. &nbsp;Japan has posted negative employment growth since 1993, ie,&nbsp;12 years of negative employment growth. &nbsp;Similarly, whilst Korea, Taiwan, Australia and Hong Kong enjoyed a slight rebound in employment in recent years, their overall employment growth trend since 1991 has been negative.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other developed countries, fewer jobs will be created for the same level of GDP growth.&nbsp; Let me explain to you and give you numbers to illustrate.&nbsp;&nbsp;When we last had 8.0%&nbsp;growth in 1995, and about 8.2% in 1996, that growth&nbsp;created&nbsp;some 109,000 and 103,000 jobs respectively.&nbsp; Last year, as Members will remember, when we had&nbsp;8%&nbsp;growth, our economy created 66,000 jobs, ie, fewer jobs created per percentage growth, but higher value, higher skill added.&nbsp; We are unlikely - and this&nbsp;is not the forecast that we will grow 8% every year, because we are developed - with slower growth, and lower rates of job creation, to see unemployment&nbsp;fall back to the 2% levels of the early 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2005, our economic growth rate is expected to be within the 3-5% range, well below the 8% experienced last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, job growth this year might not be as strong as last year, and unemployment will remain at about 3.5-4.0%.&nbsp; Even at these levels, I want to remind Members, our unemployment rates remain lower than most other countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, our workforce faces the challenge of increased globalisation.&nbsp; To continue to grow, Prof. Koo Tsai Kee asked what tricks do we have up our sleeves.&nbsp; I wish I was a magician.&nbsp; But we stick to fundamentals.&nbsp; We must maintain our cost competitiveness.&nbsp; Over the past 10 years, I want to report to Members of this House that our&nbsp;cumulative increases<p align=left>Column: 2311<p>  in wages have&nbsp;outstripped our&nbsp;productivity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even during the recessionary years after the Asian crisis and during the dot-com bust and September 11 - in other words, when the economy went down - our wages did not fall, as the chart indicates.&nbsp;&nbsp;That orange line has always been above productivity.&nbsp; Only now is the cumulative increase in productivity \u201ccatching up\ufffd? with the increase in real wages.&nbsp; The adjustments were made because of reductions&nbsp;in CPF and wage restructuring.&nbsp; So, it was the right thing to do.&nbsp; When the economy was difficult, we took decisive steps and it has made the difference.&nbsp; Now, as you can see,&nbsp;these cost-cutting measures have worked - the blue line is above the orange - and we have brought&nbsp;our wage costs in line with productivity growth.&nbsp; But the Government cannot keep on reducing CPF, without adversely affecting the retirement security of Singaporeans.&nbsp; Even as our economy improves, we must ensure that our wages do not again move at a faster pace than our productivity increases.&nbsp; Companies must also continue with&nbsp;wage restructuring so that our wages can respond more flexibly to changes in market conditions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am optimistic that so long as our tripartite partnership is strong and we collectively take adequate measures to face our challenges ahead, our economy will grow and jobs will be created.&nbsp; We are in a far better position than countries which have chosen to be protectionist and, as a result, have fallen far behind.&nbsp; Even these&nbsp;countries have had to adjust.&nbsp; Members would have read how some&nbsp;countries with traditionally confrontational labour relations have come to realise that it is unsustainable.&nbsp; The government of the eastern German town of Leipzig persuaded BMW to locate there instead of the neighbouring Czech Republic, and managed to take nearly 500 unemployed<p align=left>Column: 2312<p> persons off the dole and onto BMW's assembly line.&nbsp; How could they do it?&nbsp; The unions played a great part by agreeing to longer working hours during peak phases and to cut hours when demand is low. &nbsp;This would have been unheard of years ago - flexi-time in a predominantly German socialist tradition.&nbsp; This shows what can be accomplished when companies and unions work with the government to turn things around.&nbsp; And we have already moved far ahead.&nbsp; So, we are in a good position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Sir, we cannot shield ourselves or Singaporeans from changes, but we can prepare them to adapt.&nbsp; I share the concerns that Members raised during the Budget debate, eg, Dr Ong Seh Hong, Mayor Teo Ho Pin,&nbsp;that we need to look at&nbsp;skills, security and jobs.&nbsp; MOM and WDA will do more to help&nbsp;Singaporeans know where the job opportunities are.&nbsp; That is one area where we should give more information.&nbsp; We should give assessments of the&nbsp;employment outlook.&nbsp; We currently have vacancies in jobs such as finance and administrative managers, electronics engineers, IT personnel, aerospace technicians, sales representatives, customer service personnel, sales and service workers, security guards, and a host of other occupations.&nbsp; The public sector has another 3,100 job openings for teachers, management executives and for the uniformed services.&nbsp; But it gets very complex.&nbsp; So, what I have told staff to do is: can you improve this communication effort so that the information is packaged into useful, actionable and digestible bite-sized nuggets for specific sectors, targeted so that people know and say, \"OK, this is what I want to plan for in the next few years\"?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, the services sector will continue to create a substantial number of&nbsp;jobs. &nbsp;In the manufacturing sector, most of the growth will be in areas such as biomedical sciences and petrochemical industries.&nbsp; Employment in the electronics<p align=left>Column: 2313<p>  cluster is expected to remain stable, with new jobs created in the higher-end&nbsp;semiconductor and wafer fabrication balancing jobs lost</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>in other areas.&nbsp; On the whole, we expect to see employment in the sector changing its mix towards more skilled manpower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about business outsourcing?&nbsp; Despite the immense competition posed by China and India, we&nbsp;were still ranked the fourth most desirable location for business process outsourcing (BPO) by AT Kearney last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;In another recent study by the Economist Intelligence Unit, Singapore ranked as the top location for outsourcing, with 22.6 projects per million people, well ahead of China and India, and other countries like Ireland, Netherlands and Hong Kong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the world comes to Singapore for business process outsourcing, Singapore is also going to the world, like other small countries such as Switzerland, Denmark and Sweden.&nbsp; We will need people with international skills and capabilities to fill these jobs whose companies must find external markets to survive.&nbsp; Maersk, for example, the Danish shipping company, sends its people wherever it sends its ships.&nbsp; Likewise, so does PSA and SIA, to operate their international port and air networks.&nbsp; My Ministry will work with other agencies to internationalise Singaporeans' mindset and prepare them for these opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Mr Alex Chan and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang that Singaporeans will need to have new skill sets.&nbsp; Mr Chan will recall his involvement in the ERC where we strongly recommended a champion agency for this task. &nbsp;This was indeed the reason that WDA was set up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The WDA recently launched the employability skills system (ESS) to help all workers at all levels, including executives and managers which some Members have<p align=left>Column: 2314<p>  asked for, to enhance their foundational or soft skills, which Mr Seng Han Thong talked about.&nbsp; WDA will push ahead with workforce upgrading&nbsp;in specific industry sectors&nbsp;to raise skills&nbsp;competitiveness and to support Singapore's restructuring to higher value-added activities.&nbsp; We will also work with SMEs to step up workforce development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These CET programmes give our workers opportunities to upgrade and enhance their employability.&nbsp; Some Members have talked about older workers, whether they have adequate access.&nbsp; This is a particular area that we are looking at.&nbsp; I agree with Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mr Ahmad Khalis during the debate on the Budget Statement that we should reduce barriers as much as possible. &nbsp;Some of these barriers have been mentioned by Mr Low Thia Khiang.&nbsp; I agree with him&nbsp;that as far as possible, we cannot use paper qualifications.&nbsp; If I ask him, \"Do you have an \"O\" level certificate?\" -&nbsp;where he did not have that opportunity -&nbsp;and&nbsp;you say, \"You need this certificate before you can upgrade.\"&nbsp; It is a Catch-22 position.&nbsp; He needs that paper certificate so that he can upgrade.&nbsp; That is why we have only required minimal formal entry criteria for our programmes.&nbsp; So be rest assured that the lower skilled who have not completed formal education before can benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our idea is&nbsp;not to keep people out.&nbsp; The key point, as Members have pointed out, including Mr Low Thia Khiang, is that it must translate to more employability, better pay, more value for the job.&nbsp; That is the key.&nbsp; If you can demonstrate that, then I do not care what you have done before.&nbsp; I want to start with a new slate, and push on.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On developing other areas like entrepreneurship, WDA will build on its efforts to help job-seekers take up self-employment in retail businesses.&nbsp; Members have asked for a report on how we are doing.&nbsp; If you ask me how&nbsp;WDA, in <p align=left>Column: 2315<p> partnership with many of our Distributed CareerLink Network partners - NTUC, the CDCs - is doing,&nbsp;I would say that we are much better than we were two years ago.&nbsp; There is room for improvement but our capabilities have improved.&nbsp; More importantly, we have managed to segment the population.&nbsp; We may have started a bit naively, in that we assume that as long as you got training, you were better off.&nbsp; So we trained thousands upon thousands.&nbsp; We would have been indeed naive to say that if you failed in one job training -&nbsp;in other words, you trained in one course and it did not lead you to another job,&nbsp; I should train you in another course -&nbsp;we would&nbsp;train you in multiple courses and allow you to fail multiple times.&nbsp; So triage&nbsp;is important;&nbsp;customised effort, what does this person need?&nbsp; Some basically just need a pat on the shoulder and you say, \"Charge on, you will get a job\", and it works.&nbsp; It will cost you less and it will work.&nbsp; Some really need hand-holding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members would have heard of the enormous efforts&nbsp;Mayor Matthias Yao had to do.&nbsp; Not only did&nbsp;he have to find them job training, find them work, he had to hire a bus to bring these workers to the workplace.&nbsp; Is he overly sympathetic?&nbsp; No, he is realistic.&nbsp; His officers told him that they tried before but these people did not even go to their workplaces.&nbsp; They got lost taking the bus.&nbsp; Others have said that if&nbsp;they can get lost in Singapore, using the public service, then maybe&nbsp;they should not&nbsp;get&nbsp;the job.&nbsp; But his officers realised that they need to deal with the problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would say that we have increased our capabilities.&nbsp; But let me give&nbsp;Members some statistics.&nbsp; We have helped place more than 27,000 Singaporean job-seekers into jobs through our Distributed CareerLink Network (DCN) partners, of whom 17,600 were lower-skilled&nbsp;workers with secondary education or below, and 15,000 of these workers were above 40<p align=left>Column: 2316<p>  years old.&nbsp; I think we are&nbsp;helping the&nbsp;right group.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under our Place and Train programmes, we move away from training for training's sake.&nbsp; I want to find you a job, then I train you.&nbsp; Under our Place and&nbsp;Train&nbsp;programmes, WDA has placed some 1,800 unemployed&nbsp;Singaporeans in new jobs, of whom 45% of&nbsp;these workers are above 40 years old.&nbsp; It is not&nbsp;that we are targeting the easiest group. We can actually target the easiest&nbsp;group to report to you good results.&nbsp; But we are targeting the ones&nbsp;who need it most and where we find&nbsp;that&nbsp;they will benefit more.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we have a programme called&nbsp;TextiLE, where we are working with Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, that will benefit older and lower-skilled workers.&nbsp; Some 124 unemployed Singaporeans have been placed and trained&nbsp;at the start of this programme.&nbsp; From this programme, we know that older Singaporeans can be seamstresses and have a steady job in this career.&nbsp; In this programme, about 68% of workers were aged 40 years and above, and 95% were lower skilled.&nbsp; Another 1,400 unemployed Singaporeans have been retrained and placed into jobs in sectors such as healthcare, under the Strategic Manpower Conversion Programme and other retraining programmes.&nbsp; These are mid-career ones, eg,&nbsp;executives,&nbsp;technicians, professionals, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also help those employed workers upgrade their skills.&nbsp; The SDF did support some 600,000 training places of which 36% went to older workers and 28% went to lower skilled workers, with less than \"O\" level qualifications.&nbsp; In particular,&nbsp;the Skills Redevelopment Programme, jointly promoted by NTUC and WDA, supported some 37,000 places in 2004. Again, 60% went to those above 40 years old and 61% went to lower skilled workers with less than \"O\" level qualifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;I take that we are targeting the right population.&nbsp; Can we do more?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Can we improve?&nbsp; Definitely.&nbsp; We<p align=left>Column: 2317<p>  need to build capability with our partners.&nbsp; Previously,&nbsp;we never needed this capability when we had a 2% unemployment rate.&nbsp; It was just frictional&nbsp;unemployment. &nbsp;We had more jobs than job seekers.&nbsp; What we have done with our partners is to say that we will fund them over a longer term, and build up the capability of their individual officers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ahmad Khalis asked during the Budget debate whether there are barriers, echoed by Mr Low Thia Khiang in this COS.&nbsp; We recognise that they need to be customised. &nbsp;We need to improve access.&nbsp; We will customise our training programmes into bite-sized models, and we will facilitate access and&nbsp;shorten training duration.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, we actively want to overcome the hurdles that others face.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But these schemes and programmes are not just about statistics.&nbsp; They are about real people, and knowing how we can make a big difference in the lives of fellow Singaporeans&nbsp;will spur us on.&nbsp; Let me just give you two examples.&nbsp; Ms Cheong Leng Sin, 50 years old, a former bank supervisor, had been with the company for 23 years before&nbsp;she was retrenched in 2003. &nbsp;A very faithful worker, she stayed with the company for 23 years.&nbsp; Undeterred after her retrenchment, she decided to explore new job opportunities.&nbsp; Subsequently, she attended the NTUC/WDA STEER programme and took up a Nursing Assistance course.&nbsp; Leng Sin's performance during the Nursing Assistance course impressed the National Heart Centre so much that they offered her a scholarship for a full-time nursing course.&nbsp; She now earns less than what she did before, but derives immense job satisfaction in her new career as she is able to reach out and help patients at the Centre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example is Mr Lum Hon Cheong.&nbsp; He worked in a shipyard for almost 13 years before he was retrenched last May.&nbsp; He decided to sign up for the<p align=left>Column: 2318<p>  Trainee Charge-Hand (TRAC) Scheme which places retrenched or unemployed Singaporeans into shipyard jobs as trainee charge-hands or supervisors.&nbsp; He has been working with Jurong Shipyard for the past four months.&nbsp; He had to take a $600 pay cut and bear his own transportation costs.&nbsp; But he is now undergoing a string of certifiable upgrading training sponsored by the company and he can be assured of a promotion to project&nbsp;supervisor if he performs well.&nbsp; On completion of the traineeship, he will be drawing about $1,300 to $1,400 a month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adapting to changing circumstances is not easy, but many have succeeded with the right attitude and persistence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Mr Ong Ah Heng that we must give Singaporeans hope through better and stable careers.&nbsp; He&nbsp;mentioned that the elderly said to him that they are like waves, and their movement is controlled by waves behind them.&nbsp; I agree with him. We cannot control waves, but, at least, we can make our shores and beaches inviting.&nbsp; I was cheered when I read Ms Carmen Tan's letter in the <I>Straits Times'</I> Forum page yesterday, when they were talking about menial jobs.&nbsp; Ms Tan's mother works as a cleaner in Tan Tock Seng Hospital and does so with pride, even though others may think that cleaning or street-sweeping jobs are menial or dirty.&nbsp; Ms Tan said, \"Such jobs may be dirty, literally, but they are decent jobs that should be valued\".&nbsp; How right she is!&nbsp; There is dignity in an honest day's work.&nbsp; We can help further by improving the productivity of current jobs. &nbsp;Members would have read, as mentioned by&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng,&nbsp;about the Job Re-creation Programme and, as Mr Seng Han Thong mentioned, the Teachers' Aid programme.&nbsp; There are opportunities.&nbsp; We can raise productivity, we can improve the image and work conditions of existing jobs and we will do so in many sectors - cleaning, horticulture, healthcare, marine, textile and education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2319<p> \r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong Ah Heng mentioned whether we could tie the ComCare Fund to work assistance.&nbsp; Indeed, there is a principle.&nbsp; He also asked whether we could have mentorship schemes.&nbsp; WDA will be more than willing to work with advisers who want to have their own grassroots members to be mentors. We will train them.&nbsp; We will tie assistance schemes to staying on a job, ie,&nbsp;if you stay in the job for three months, there is an adjustment allowance and we can work with you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang also proposed covering executives under the Employment Act.&nbsp; He is right that the Employment Act does not cover executives and managerial staff because we believe that they are in a position to negotiate their own terms and conditions of employment with their employers.&nbsp; If&nbsp;he remembers, the Ministry amended the Industrial Relations Act to allow representation for executives by&nbsp;the rank-and-file union in the same company on issues relating to unfair dismissal, retrenchment benefit payment and the breach of employment contract.&nbsp; My Ministry's Labour Relations Department will also provide voluntary conciliation service to executives to assist them in settling their disputes with employers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For contract and part-time workers, contract workers in Singapore enjoy the same statutory job protection as their permanent counterparts.&nbsp; Our records show that the percentage of contingent workers who lodged claims to MOM is not higher than the proportion of contract workers.&nbsp; This suggests that the employers of contingent workers generally comply with statutory employment terms stipulated in the Employment Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are challenges to be met.&nbsp; The competition is getting tougher but there is more than ample reason for optimism.&nbsp; We have built up our capability and&nbsp;we have increased our resources to help<p align=left>Column: 2320<p>  those who are vulnerable to structural unemployment.&nbsp; As our economy grows, jobs will be created, restructuring will continue and our focus should be to continue to grow our economy and jobs and help as many workers as we can adjust.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Sir, what is MOM's projection of the estimated job growth for the current year, in the light of the end of seasonal hiring and&nbsp;some retrenchments, such as in Maxtor?&nbsp; What is the estimated net growth?\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> Sir, it is easier for me to compare to what we need to absorb our new labour entrants every year; in other words,&nbsp;what&nbsp;is the number of jobs.&nbsp; We have about 32,000 new net labour entrants in our labour market.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Sir, two short points for&nbsp;clarification from the Minister.&nbsp; The Minister talked about the need to&nbsp;control wage cost, which I do not disagree with him.&nbsp; But&nbsp;I also feel that it is not just wage cost that we should look at because there is a limit to how much&nbsp;one could go on cutting wages.&nbsp; Employers must also look at other ways of increasing revenue.&nbsp; And, of course, it is the responsibility on the part of the Government to ensure that business costs are kept down.&nbsp; So I would like to seek a response from the Minister on that.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second point, I think whilst we focus on getting jobs for people who were retrenched,&nbsp;it is a lot harder once a person is&nbsp;retrenched, particularly if he has to overcome this difficulty of structural unemployment.&nbsp; So our strategy must<p align=left>Column: 2321<p>  continue to focus, as much as possible, on upgrading the skills of the existing workforce.&nbsp; For the 94% or so that are still employed,&nbsp;one of the difficulties we face is that&nbsp;employers are sometimes not too keen to train people outside their immediate job needs, and that is an obstacle, in terms of releasing&nbsp;and supporting them, or even just releasing and not&nbsp;having&nbsp;to support them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Ministry have any strategy to assist us?&nbsp; Upgrading of the 94% of the people employed is absolutely critical to prevent them from going into the area of structural unemployment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> Sir, Mdm Halimah is quite correct.&nbsp; From the point of cost competitiveness, it cannot be due to wages alone.&nbsp; For example, in manufacturing, wages only form 10% of total operating cost.&nbsp; So she is quite right there.&nbsp; In terms of the figures I have shown, where she said that wages are sticky, she is quite correct in that there is a limit to which you can cut wages.&nbsp;&nbsp;But as I showed her, even in a recessionary time, wages were increasing.&nbsp; My point is, we ought to stick to NWC guidelines where wage increases should lag behind productivity growth.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we have to do more in&nbsp;controlling other factors of production, in terms of land, transport, utilities costs, and for employers to be more productive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On workers who are finding it harder to find work once they are retrenched - it is the case.&nbsp; And, indeed, we should focus on in-employment training.&nbsp; The question is, how much we balance it in terms of the funds we allocate from the funding that we have for training?&nbsp; What we have done at WDA or MOM is to parcel out aggregated sums, that is the first cut, where we decide to put&nbsp;in-employment.&nbsp; What we have found is,&nbsp;for those who become retrenched,&nbsp;that you really need to put a lot of resources, in terms of getting them into stable careers.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think that is quite right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2322<p> \r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the ambiguities in in-employment training is that, yes, 94% of them are employed.&nbsp; They need training because once they are unemployed, it is hard to get them a job.&nbsp; But it also works against you if there is indiscriminate training, or you are not sure whether the training helps them keep the job or create value.&nbsp; So I think this is not something that WDA or MOM can decide alone.&nbsp; I think we have to work with the employers and unions and decide how we can make training of any sort, whether it is in-employment or employment for the retrenched, count for more.&nbsp; I think all of us want to seek efficiency and effectiveness, and we have to decide how we can do this with the limited funds that we have.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

What it means is that, in this case, the dependency ratio and ceiling is now up to 60%.&nbsp;&nbsp;It means that for a company which needs to expand their workforce by up to 25%, they can resort&nbsp;to just employing foreign workers instead of making efforts to employ&nbsp;Singaporeans.&nbsp;\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

So on that score he is quite right.&nbsp; Yes, they can do so, but they must pay a hefty levy of $500.&nbsp; The principal mechanism for control is not, in this case, the dependency ratio.&nbsp; It is really the levy.&nbsp; And, indeed, if at the aggregated level, our foreign worker force increases disproportionately, we will raise the levy higher as we said.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Alexander Chan Meng Wah-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I also agree that the 10 years for halving&nbsp;the fatality rate is a reasonable set of targets.&nbsp; In order for the country to approach that, I think individual firms would have to probably adopt&nbsp;zero defects,&nbsp;zero fatality targets.&nbsp; So I do not think it is a compromise.&nbsp; My question is:&nbsp; in order to encourage this, would the Minister consider incentives for firms to either train up on new kinds of discipline, like&nbsp;zero defects?&nbsp;

When they are old and have no skill, it would be even more difficult for them to find a job.&nbsp; That is why they said it is easier for an old man to wed a young foreign wife than to find a job in Singapore.&nbsp; Of course, it is encouraging to find that the situation for the workers above 50 years old has improved in recent months. The unemployment rate has been reduced from 5% in 2003 to 3.5% now, and more older workers can find jobs because there are more jobs that are suitable for the older workers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But just about&nbsp;four days ago, Maxtor retrenched 5,500 workers.&nbsp; This is worrying.&nbsp; The Maxtor factory is in my constituency and a lot of my voters work there.&nbsp; When this news came, I cannot help thinking of the future of&nbsp;their family, their children, their PUB bills, etc.&nbsp; If the company wants to restructure, there is nothing we can do to stop them.&nbsp; The question now is&nbsp; how to put in a concerted effort to help the older workers to find&nbsp; respectable jobs.&nbsp; Just now, the Minister mentioned about respectable jobs for older workers. I am glad that a tripartite taskforce has already been formed to look into the matter. It is important that we find soft but respectable jobs for them.&nbsp; We should make use of their strength and not their weakness.&nbsp; So, when offering the jobs to them, it should not be a \"take it or leave it\" kind of attitude.

For example, the MCYS childcare centres could employ senior citizens to be&nbsp;baby-sitters and the&nbsp;People's Association may employ senior citizens to be administrators in the Residents Committees and Senior Citizens Clubs.&nbsp; The schools could also employ retirees to be traffic wardens.&nbsp; I remember when I was in primary school<p align=left>Column: 2327<p>  I used to see some old people carrying a \"Stop\" sign to direct traffic, but nowadays, some young parents, in order that the children have priority in enrolment to the school, would&nbsp; volunteer to become traffic wardens.&nbsp; I think MOE could employ some retirees for this job.&nbsp; The Ministry of National Development could employ some senior citizens to be gardeners and environment inspectors in HDB estates.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When these retirees return to the workforce, most of them work on a&nbsp; part-time basis and the monthly salary is not much.&nbsp; After deducting CPF contribution, their take-home pay is really very little.

Mr Chairman, Sir, I have in this House raised the issue of artificially setting a ceiling on retirement age.&nbsp; I argued and still stand in the firm belief that chronological age&nbsp;is no indication of a person's psychological, physiological and mental well-being.&nbsp; A person at 62 years could still be very healthy in all aspects and he could expect to live longer if he is actually working.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have also argued that it is not&nbsp;helpful to have a retirement age as it would neutralise the person's economic productivity.&nbsp; This is especially painful to his loved ones as his dependency on them will start the moment he loses his job because of age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Artificially removing a productive worker because of retirement age will also worsen the labour market in the light of our dramatically falling fertility rate.&nbsp;Given that the life-expectancy of Singaporeans is now 77 years for men and 81 years for<p align=left>Column: 2328<p>  women, retiring at 62 years would mean that the dependency of this person on someone else's income would be 15 years or more.&nbsp; In addition, retirement would also mean a downward spiral of inactivity and stagnancy, which could lead to many problems including poor health and depression.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me take this opportunity to challenge the Ministry's&nbsp;view that the prescription of retirement age is a floor, ie, the minimum age whereby a worker can retire and not the ceiling.&nbsp; More often than not, both workers and employees view this as a ceiling.&nbsp; So I would hope that the Ministry would change this erroneous view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ask the Minister: is it not good to keep&nbsp;a person working?&nbsp;&nbsp;Because if someone could continue to work beyond 62 years, he&nbsp;would continue to contribute to the society and depend less on the family and the state.&nbsp; His savings for old age could also last longer.&nbsp; By working, these older workers could also lead a more dignified and meaningful life in their twilight years.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

of 26th June 2004 report, only about half of the present CPF retirees could meet the Minimum Sum requirement.&nbsp; For the next 10 years, the situation will remain the same.&nbsp; The scenario printed in the report is worrying, especially of the volatile economic situation caused by globalisation and the&nbsp;depressed income from employment.&nbsp; I think there is an urgent need to reform the way CPF savings are invested in order that they yield better return on the savings.&nbsp; If we do not tackle the problem now, many Singaporeans may either find their CPF savings insufficient for retirement, or may even face financial difficulties not too long after they retire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2329<p> \r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has allowed CPF members to invest their CPF on approved investment instruments of the members' choice.&nbsp; But based on data released by CPF and also by Prof. Mukul Asher of NUS, the following outcome is unsatisfactory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; As at 30th September 2003, $20.1 billion was invested through the CPFIS, and the rate of return obtained on the whole portfolio under the Ordinary Account was a negative 14.77%.&nbsp; And for the Special Account, it was negative 6.87%.&nbsp; If transaction cost including investment management cost and tax included, it could have been more unfavourable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Insurance products have been the most favourite form of CPF investment scheme among the members.&nbsp; However, for insurance products, the unrealised loss was $802 million, equivalent to about 5.77% of total investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe that we need a more coherent and comprehensive system to invest the CPF savings.&nbsp; The Government&nbsp; should look at ways to invest the CPF savings by pooling the funds together so that CPF members can enjoy economies of scale and, at the same time, individual members can avoid paying hefty financial charges should they invest on their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that the Government has put on hold the proposed private pension fund for CPF members.&nbsp; Would the Minister care to explain the reason?&nbsp; Is the Government looking for other forms of investment schemes?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to ask whether the Government will consider setting up a statutory board to act as an&nbsp;asset management company for CPF members, like the&nbsp;Hong Kong's MPF system, where&nbsp;individual members can select the proportion of retirement savings they<p align=left>Column: 2330<p>  want to allocate to different financial packages available to them.&nbsp; This would allow members to formulate unique financial portfolios with different risk factors and expected returns according to their different risk adversity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, alternatively, since the Singapore Government Investment Corporation (SGIC) has achieved consistent investment returns, higher than international benchmark, would the Government consider allowing SGIC to directly manage the investment of CPF savings in order to achieve a higher rate of return for Singaporeans?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Geh Min (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>CPF Transfers to Homemakers</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Geh Min (Nominated Member):</B>&nbsp; Sir, one of the greatest fears that we all share, as had been aired in the House many times, is a dependent and decrepit old age if our lives should outlast our savings and our health.&nbsp; The Government has recognised this and made provisions in the latest Budget to try to allay these fears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Government also recognises that many young Singaporeans are concerned about the financial responsibilities of starting a family, and it has also done much to create an attractive baby bonus package.&nbsp; But what I feel is lacking, to a certain extent, is more policies or provisions that address the link between these two concerns&nbsp;-&nbsp;the concerns for old age and starting a family.&nbsp; True, these two problems do not arise at the same time.&nbsp; They arise at different ends of our adult life, but the concerns will overlap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because choices we make when we are young determine what options are open to us when we are old.&nbsp; For example, a young woman of child-bearing age can choose to concentrate on family at the expense of her career or could do the reverse, or she could try and have it all<p align=left>Column: 2331<p>  and juggle both to the best of her ability.&nbsp; Some people manage to succeed than others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But whatever choices we make, they involve trade offs, and I think it is fair to say that in the existing system for a woman, one of the trade-offs is that if she concentrates on career, she will have greater self-sufficiency and financial independence.&nbsp; If she concentrates on family, this will result in greater financial dependency on her husband and subsequently her children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, if Government wishes to encourage Singaporeans to plan in advance both for their own old age and also to give young Singaporeans more incentives to have children, I think we should seriously consider certain modifications to the CPF.&nbsp; Firstly, we should allow that a portion of the CPF of the salaried spouse be channelled into the CPF account of the homemaker or worker without CPF at any time, not just after 55.&nbsp; Of course, this should be by choice and not compulsion.&nbsp; But why are there so many restrictions? After 55, the CPF account holder has to have more than double the Minimum Sum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To my understanding, the CPF is not meant just as a personal pension fund or a life jacket for one.&nbsp; It is meant to be more family friendly, to be a survival kit for the whole family.&nbsp; So I do not feel that the present conditions are sufficiently family friendly or promote any form of family bonding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, could we consider additional incentives or tax reliefs be given to spouses who contribute to the CPF accounts of their spouses whose CPF balances are below the Minimum Sum, by perhaps topping up or a&nbsp;matching scheme?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, we could give families the choice to treat the husband and wife's <p align=left>Column: 2332<p> CPF as a joint family CPF rather than an individual CPF owned solely by the income owner.&nbsp; Of course, the rights for withdrawal and investment would then have to be jointly exercised.&nbsp; I believe that this would promote for greater self-sufficiency, not just for the individual, but for the family as a unit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Young women today -&nbsp;thanks to wise policies, better education and greater job opportunities -&nbsp;have far more options than their grandmothers or even their mothers had.&nbsp; They would not choose to be in the same position as the majority of older women today, as the Tsao Aware report which was published recently showed that the majority of&nbsp;older women have the prospect of an insecure old age with an inadequate CPF and savings and are dependent on their children or welfare rather than on themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is more disturbing is that between 1980 and the year 2000, there was an increasing gender disparity in CPF, &nbsp;in actual figures between men and women.&nbsp; In our society, the man is considered the head of the household, but I believe that women exercise a greater say in the size of their families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, these modifications to the CPF should:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) promote better and more effective long-term planning by and for families;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) they should give fair recognition to the contributions made by a homemaker from both the spouse and from society at large; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) they should encourage couples and women especially to feel more secure about starting or enlarging their family without excessively compromising their own ability to provide for their old age.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman:</B> Prof. Ong Soh Khim is not here.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah Yacob.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--> <p align=left>Column: 2333<p> \r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Sir, not all CPF contributors are savvy investors.&nbsp; Many invest their hard-earned CPF money in the hope of making more than the interest that they would otherwise earn if they were to leave the money in their Ordinary Account.&nbsp; Quite a number had their fingers burnt and lost money instead.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One particular investment of concern is the investment-linked insurance plans.&nbsp; Press reports highlighted the predicament of one Kelvin Yeo who was shocked to discover that his policy could lapse as he grew older, or if the investment value of his underlying fund is very poor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, CPF money can be used to purchase investment-linked insurance plans (ILPs).&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a matter of concern as instead of a healthy account, workers may end up depleting their hard-earned money on such financial products.&nbsp; I urge the CPF Board, as the guardians of our CPF money, to do more to safeguard CPF members' interests, so that they do not fall prey to such schemes.&nbsp; Otherwise, instead of a comfortable retirement income, they will have nothing left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am certain that even among the hon.

Members.]&nbsp;</I> Simply put, our&nbsp;declining birth rates over the past years will have a significant, long term impact on our workforce profile and growth.&nbsp; If we look at the chart, in 1988, we had a Dragon Year.&nbsp; In 1990, it was the Year of the Horse, and&nbsp;we experienced a baby boom, which continued until 1998.&nbsp; The lower graph is when they grow older and the demographic echoes are heard.&nbsp; So, from 1998 onwards, the number of births a year fell sharply.&nbsp; This precipitous drop from 1998 will be mirrored later and result in fewer new entrants into our workforce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Dragon Year babies of 1988 are now 17 years old and going to junior colleges, polytechnics and ITE.&nbsp; Some will continue with their education, others will start work.&nbsp; As they and the cohorts following join the labour force, we will experience a mini-labour force boom.&nbsp; It is a five-year projection.&nbsp; So you see the 44,000 figure which has been rounded off<I>.</I>&nbsp; But thereafter, the new cohorts entering the labour force will diminish.&nbsp; There is another five-year projection&nbsp;-&nbsp;24,000 new labour entrants per year over the period 2010-2015.&nbsp; It is a precipitous drop.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a sizable drop and the reduction<p align=left>Column: 2335<p>  in new labour entrants is likely to continue.&nbsp; Even if our recently introduced procreation measures work, improvements will have to wait till these new babies&nbsp;join the workforce some 20 plus years later.&nbsp; And it is still \"if\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there is another major factor driving the profile of our labour force.&nbsp; As Dr Ong Seh Hong said, life expectancies have been rising and will continue to rise with better medical care.&nbsp; Today, men can expect to live till 77 and women to 81.&nbsp; Many Singaporeans have a future&nbsp;of a further 15 to 20 years after their retirement age, and they can still contribute economically if they are able and willing.&nbsp; Already, older workers aged 50-64 are the fastest growing group in our labour force, for both the employed as well as unemployed workers.&nbsp; 29% of our labour force will be aged 50 and above in 2015, as compared to 13% in 1991.&nbsp; These two major structural shifts due to falling birth rates and more older workers will impact our local workforce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has often reminded&nbsp;itself that our most important resource is our human resource.&nbsp; Well, with these demographic changes that I have just described, our most important asset - our local workforce - will grow slower and older.&nbsp; So&nbsp;it is within this context that we must plan our strategies to stay competitive, especially against our regional competitors with younger and larger working populations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of falling birth rates, we will need to increase the labour force participation rate (LFPR) of local workers, to maintain the size of our labour force.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>This must mean helping people to work longer, and for certain groups like women, which Dr Geh Min alluded to,&nbsp;where the labour force participation rate&nbsp;has been&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2336<p> relatively lower, you must encourage more to enter and remain in the workforce.&nbsp; The&nbsp;labour participation rate&nbsp;for those aged 50 to 64 has improved.&nbsp; It was 49% in 1993 and went up by 10 percentage points&nbsp;between 1993 and&nbsp;2004.&nbsp; But I would say that other countries with ageing populations have done better than we have.&nbsp; For example, in Japan, it is 72%, which means that 72% of those aged 50-64 are working.&nbsp; In the United States, it is 70%,&nbsp;and South Korea, 65%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our workforce ages, we will need to address employment and workplace issues faced by our older and local&nbsp;workers.&nbsp; The key problem&nbsp;is not so much that they are&nbsp;vulnerable to unemployment.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp;the unemployment rates for older workers is no different from the general population.&nbsp; The problem is, as many Members have said, that once they get unemployed, it is really harder for them to get re-employed.&nbsp;&nbsp;For those aged 50 and above, only six of 10 retrenched&nbsp;in the second quarter of 2004 were re-employed within six months, and this is compared with 70% of those aged below 30.&nbsp;&nbsp;Correspondingly in June 2004, their risk of long-term unemployment was higher, at 2.1%, compared to the overall average of 1.7%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members have been notified, the Ministry has set up&nbsp;a Tripartite Committee to examine this important issue and it is not just that we want them to work longer. &nbsp;We have to facilitate older workers working longer.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee is chaired by&nbsp;my Permanent Secretary, Ms Yong Ying-I, and comprises our tripartite partners, with the employer representatives led by Mr Stephen Lee, President of Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF); and employee representatives led by Mr John De Payva, President of NTUC.&nbsp; The Chairman for the GPC for Manpower, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Madam Halimah, Nominated MPs Mr Alex Chan and Mr Lawrence Leow are also members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2337<p> \r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome suggestions from other Members in this House.&nbsp; Some, like Dr Lily Neo, Dr Ahmad Magad and Mr Sin Boon Ann, have spoken passionately about this during the Budget debate because they care much&nbsp;about the elderly and their needs.&nbsp; I thank&nbsp;them for their ideas.&nbsp; The Tripartite Committee will look into all&nbsp;these suggestions in greater depth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let me take the opportunity to respond to these issues broadly&nbsp;to three challenges that the older workers face.&nbsp; The first challenge is really on job redesign and re-creation, that we need to expand and facilitate opportunities for older workers.&nbsp; Going forward, we can expect job creation, as our economy continues to grow.&nbsp; But the type of skills and jobs will be different, as many Members have alluded to.&nbsp; For example, the number of clerical job openings has diminished considerably, compared to 10 years ago. &nbsp;Ten years ago, there were about 6,000 clerical jobs.&nbsp; Today, there&nbsp;are only 1,600 vacancies.&nbsp; Simple office applications have become a basic skill for all, it is no longer&nbsp;an occupational skill just for clerks.&nbsp; We cannot promise workers that we will have the same jobs as we used to do in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members have pointed out, we have introduced certain schemes, the Re-employment Assistance Programme, and Re-employment Support Schemes to help&nbsp;Singaporeans&nbsp;adjust.&nbsp; The key is in job redesign, whether old or young, male or female, so that they can do it&nbsp;with the same efficiency.&nbsp; This is an important programme not only for lower skilled workers but indeed vital for many businesses around the world.&nbsp; I am especially proud that NTUC are&nbsp;pioneers in this effort.&nbsp; They have been pushing for this appropriately.&nbsp; NTUC will spearhead this Job Re-Creation Programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You would have read about some successes that we had, particularly, the&nbsp;Conservancy Job Redesign Committee led<p align=left>Column: 2338<p>  by Mr Ang Mong Seng, where a total of more than 550 job vacancies were created over the past six months and 80% of those employed were&nbsp;above 40 years old with below secondary education.&nbsp; We will look into other sectors - cleaning, horticulture, healthcare, marine, textile and education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked whether we could restrict the proportion of foreign workers to 30% in these sectors.&nbsp; Our current foreign worker&nbsp;policies already restrict the proportion of foreign workers through dependency ceilings.&nbsp; However, in specific sectors where Singaporeans are willing to take up long term careers after job redesign, we can progressively tighten up&nbsp;foreign worker&nbsp;access.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Seng Han Thong asked&nbsp;whether the Lifelong Learning Fund (LLF) could be made more accessible and favourable to older workers in terms of skill upgrading.&nbsp; Indeed, we do.&nbsp; Such programmes, as the Employability Skills Systems, do give preference funding rates to those above 40 years old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The real issue is one of cost competitiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;The demographic changes that I have mentioned will result in an ageing workforce with the proportion of older workers increasing as fewer younger workers enter the workforce.&nbsp; Even as our workforce grows older, we must make sure that our competitiveness is maintained.&nbsp; Otherwise, our competitors in the region with younger working populations will have a distinct edge over us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers will have to face market realities and compete against other companies who view our ageing workforce as an advantage for them.&nbsp; Because of competition, employers will generally be reluctant to implement programmes for older workers unless they can build up a business case on how older workers can contribute to the company in areas such as its strategic directions, culture or<p align=left>Column: 2339<p>  bottom line. &nbsp;Take job redesign as an example.&nbsp; A job redesign will not take off if it is simply about changing work processes to accommodate older workers.&nbsp; To convince employers, it will have to make economic sense and yield benefits to the company,&nbsp;in terms of higher productivity or lower staff turnover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some companies have shown that simple changes can improve outcomes even as their workforce ages. A local company, Singapore Food Industries (SFI), for instance, has more than 60% of its bargainable workforce aged above 40 years.&nbsp; SFI used to deliver food to its customers in cartons with a delivery order printed in English.&nbsp; Because of the large number of products and many of the cartons were identical, mistakes were made.&nbsp; SFI then added pictures to the delivery order which made it much easier for delivery attendants to identify the contents of the cartons.&nbsp; It is a simple&nbsp;change.&nbsp; But this simple change&nbsp;helped the company&nbsp;to reduce errors in deliveries and cut down the time it needed to train its delivery attendants.&nbsp; It also benefited all its delivery attendants, including some of the older workers with low literacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another&nbsp;example, International Truck and Engine Corporation, which manufactures trucks in the US, reviewed its manufacturing process and concluded that building trucks from underneath was awkward and caused frequent work-related injuries. &nbsp;To create a safe and comfortable environment for employees, it redesigned the workplace by turning the chassis upside down and replaced heavy hand-held tools with more ergonomic suspended tools and they were productive.&nbsp; I am not suggesting that all work processes would have to be turned upside down.&nbsp; Surgeons would still have to operate the right side up.&nbsp; But these examples should force us to consider afresh, innovative ways to improve<p align=left>Column: 2340<p>  incomes, outcomes and help our workers adapt and remain productive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with some of the comments which were made during the Budget debate.&nbsp; Dr Ahmad Magad spoke about wage restructuring.&nbsp; The seniority-based wage system&nbsp;works against older workers as it makes them more costly to hire and to retain compared to younger workers.&nbsp; That is why we must continue with our wage restructuring efforts.&nbsp; Even as we ask employers to adjust their mindsets, older workers must also adjust their expectations towards wages and benefits as we seek to raise the effective retirement age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third challenge is about changing mindsets, as many Members talked about.&nbsp; Some have pointed out that employers may discriminate against hiring older workers because of negative perceptions, and I agree that that exists, as Mdm Halimah alluded to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran suggested that the Government take legislative action on age discrimination.&nbsp; But other countries that have done so have found that&nbsp;discrimination is generally difficult to establish even if legislation exists.&nbsp; Few employers will tell you that they&nbsp;are not hiring you because you are older or if you are a particular gender or particular race or ethnic group.&nbsp; They will find other reasons to do it.&nbsp; So to prove it is quite difficult, as other countries have found out.&nbsp; So reliance on just legislation may not achieve our desired end.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tripartite Committee will study how to deal with this challenge of employers' perceptions. &nbsp;It will also address the perceptions of older workers themselves towards taking active measures to increase their own employability.&nbsp; We will certainly highlight positive examples, as I have done, and will continue to encourage employers to take an enlightened view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have suggested fiscal incentives.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tripartite Committee can<p align=left>Column: 2341<p>  study these but, as I mentioned, 30% of our&nbsp;&nbsp;workforce would be over 50 years by 2015.&nbsp; So they are no longer the minority and, therefore, fiscal incentives cannot be the sustained basis for helping older workers maintain their competitiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of&nbsp;retirement age, the Retirement Age Act was introduced in 1993.&nbsp; It was a strong signal to employers and employees that the retirement norm should be higher.&nbsp; Dr Ong Seh Hong asked whether we should abolish the retirement age altogether or otherwise raise it.&nbsp; The legislation is still relevant.&nbsp; The progressive raising of the retirement age has yielded a rise in the participation rates.&nbsp; In other words, it has worked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;legislation has a diminishing impact the higher the retirement age is mandated.&nbsp; In other words, if you raised the retirement age&nbsp;from 50 to 55, as we did previously, you might see a significant jump in your labour force participation rate.&nbsp; But the effect is much smaller when the retirement age&nbsp;is raised from 60 to 62 and will be even less beyond 62. &nbsp;To raise the effective retirement age, we still need to examine the deeper and fundamental issues related to their&nbsp;employability and employment of older workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, our participation rate, as I have mentioned, is 59% for those aged 50 to 64.&nbsp; We can&nbsp;learn from countries, such as Japan and US.&nbsp; They have more experience and better HR policies in implementing various measures targeted at older workers such as training programmes, job facilitation, wage subsidies, employment incentive schemes, and anti-age discrimination measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously,&nbsp;not all the measures adopted by other countries will be suitable for Singapore.&nbsp; But some key lessons are obvious: the challenge of helping our older workers retain their employability requires the effort of the Government, industry and workers alike.&nbsp; The Tripartite Committee will need to review these ideas,<p align=left>Column: 2342<p>  and see what works in our context.&nbsp; But&nbsp;for these new ideas to take root in our work culture and practices, we will need everyone to play a part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Members, Dr Ong Seh Hong and Miss Penny Low, earlier in the Budget debate,&nbsp;have asked about retirement adequacy and Mr Low Thia Khiang has also spoken on this.&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF provides a means for many Singaporeans to save for their retirement.&nbsp; The CPF Board will study ways in which we can enhance members' savings through better returns.&nbsp; But, first, let me state categorically two limitations on CPF adequacy.&nbsp; First, in order for members to save enough, they must put aside enough for their retirement and work longer.&nbsp; A generation ago, most would work about 30 years, you would start&nbsp;work in&nbsp;your early 20s stopped in your&nbsp;late 50s, worked for 30 years,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;average life expectancy in the mid 60s.&nbsp; In other words, the economically active period&nbsp;of 30 years was somewhat equal to the inactive period of 30 years -&nbsp;50:50.&nbsp; But today, many take longer to finish their education before working, and are living far longer after they stop work.&nbsp; If you start work at 25 and retire at 60, or hope to retire at 60,&nbsp;35 years of working&nbsp;and live till 80, the ratio has been inverted,&nbsp;it is now 40:60. &nbsp;You work for 40% of your lifetime; 60%, you are not working.&nbsp; This ratio is inherently consumptive.&nbsp; It means that parents must support their children longer before they start work and workers must put aside more for their retirement.&nbsp; So we can talk about enhancing return but the real key issue, whether it is for households, spouses, non-working spouses, or families, is that they must work longer and put aside more for retirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, when it comes to increasing returns through investments, potentially higher returns always come with higher risks.&nbsp; The risk and returns come as a package and are indeed indivisible.&nbsp; This is why we decided to shelve plans for the<p align=left>Column: 2343<p>  proposed&nbsp;role of privately-managed pension plans (PPPs).&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang asked why.&nbsp; Because most of the feedback from Ministries and the&nbsp;public was that many&nbsp;members would underestimate their risks and make unwise investment decisions. &nbsp;We are now studying other possibilities to increase returns for CPF savings within risk levels which members should tolerate and for which the majority can benefit in the longer term.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>Whatever the framework, it cannot be a quick way to make a fortune. &nbsp;There is no free lunch.&nbsp; If you promise people that you&nbsp;have a framework which promises high returns, you must also tell them that there are high risks and that this would be a financially imprudent way of managing our pension funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPF Board has&nbsp;been active in its public education and we need to do more.&nbsp; I agree with what Mdm Halimah spoke about, to educate CPF members and help them make informed decisions when they buy a home or invest their CPF savings.&nbsp; These initiatives include an enhanced website, as well as seminars and roadshows, which have proven to be very popular.&nbsp; We can do more.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are increasing&nbsp;the&nbsp;Minimum Sum required to&nbsp;$120,000 in 2003 dollars by 2013 and, together with the phasing out of the 50% withdrawal rule from 2009, this will increase the provision for retirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Geh Min spoke about putting aside some portion for the non-working spouse.&nbsp; The Government sees the family playing an important role in providing social and financial support to their dependants.&nbsp; Thus, the CPF allows members to top up the accounts of their parents, grandparents and non-working spouses above the age of 55.&nbsp; Tax relief is also given for cash top-ups, subject to a certain sum.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2344<p> The hon. Member said she did not see her CPF funds as a personal pension fund.&nbsp; Indeed, it is.&nbsp; That is the primary principle.&nbsp; Our approach remains that individuals have to be responsible for their own retirement, but we will facilitate CPF members to help&nbsp;other family members when they have enough to meet their own needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach is fair, because each person draws out what he has contributed over his working life.&nbsp; It is also sustainable because the scheme is fully funded for each person's own needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the qualifying conditions for topping-up will be relaxed.&nbsp; More members can do top-ups, and more older members will be able to receive top-ups.&nbsp; The Government will also simplify the rules on the contribution caps on the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) to allow those who earn below the CPF income ceiling and the self-employed to set aside additional savings outside of CPF.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Geh Min asked whether&nbsp;the CPF transfers could be allowed for those&nbsp;below&nbsp;55. &nbsp;Tax incentives for younger members to contribute to their non-working spouses do not really address the problem of the retirement adequacy of the whole family, since it merely effects transfers from one to the other within the same family.&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned earlier, to help households increase their income, we will need to facilitate more non-working spouses&nbsp;to work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, mandating CPF transfers from working to non-working family members does not improve the overall income&nbsp;of that family.&nbsp; Moreover, Singaporeans are generally responsible towards their family members.&nbsp; Of those CPF members who have made a nomination, only 2% do not nominate family members as their beneficiaries.&nbsp; And, of this group, half are single.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to highlight that CPF savings is just one type of asset.&nbsp; It is a<p align=left>Column: 2345<p>  predominant asset but it is not the only asset.&nbsp; Non-working members may have other assets, such as property.&nbsp; Dr Geh Min will be interested to know that of the 592,000 married couples who own HDB flats, the female spouse is joint owner in 91% and sole owner in 3% of them. &nbsp;In other words, the female spouse in 94% of these instances owns the asset.&nbsp; Thus, the majority of wives do own assets, even if they are not working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah asked about investment-linked products.&nbsp; She raised a concern, and she rightly pointed out that many invest even without&nbsp;knowing the increasing charges as they grow older.&nbsp; I would like to assure her that the impact is limited as it pertains only to regular premium insurance-linked products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1st January 2001, the CPF Board has stopped allowing the purchase of regular premium policies under the CPFIS.&nbsp; In other words, we only allow CPF members to purchase single premium ILPs.&nbsp; As at 31st December 2004, about $700 million or less than 8% of the $9 billion of CPF savings invested in ILPs are regular premium ILPs.&nbsp; So, it is a small proportion.&nbsp; We have stopped it anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;CPF&nbsp;also imposes additional safeguards in place to ensure that excessive premiums do not go towards insurance costs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the maturity date for ILPs bought with CPF savings must not be later than the member's 62nd birthday.&nbsp; In other words, you cannot have a policy that extends indefinitely and raise the premiums for older members.&nbsp; Hence, they will not be affected by the increased insurance charges as members age.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, for a given premium, limits have been placed on members' basic sum assured to ensure that a greater proportion of the premium paid is for investment.&nbsp; So, upfront, we have asked the insurance companies to cater for the basic premium as assured.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--> <p align=left>Column: 2346<p> \r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, medical cost is always the concern of the workers.&nbsp; With the revamp of MediShield, which is a big step forward in the restructuring of our national healthcare financing system, I think it is time that the existing employer-provided medical scheme also be revamped to supplement the national scheme.&nbsp; The national MediShield scheme is portable and it takes care of all the big medical bills but there are gaps that we have to close.&nbsp; The existing employer-provided in-patient medical benefits are not portable.&nbsp; Seventy percent of the employers provided in-patient benefits are arranged through the group insurance schemes.&nbsp; Once the workers have left the<p align=left>Column: 2348<p>  company, the benefits and the coverage are gone.&nbsp; So, in this case, we have to see how we can actually protect the interests of the workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, there is a need for employers to work closely with the trade unions and the support of different Government agencies, including the Ministry of Health, Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, Ministry of Manpower and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to study how we could restructure such employer-based in-patient medical insurance scheme funded by the employers as medical benefits in line with the revamped MediShield.&nbsp; This will avoid duplication and make medical benefits more efficient and portable to enable all employees to have medical coverage, not just during their employment but also in between employment and after his or her retirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we help the workers prepare to face the challenges of the workplace, we also need to promote work-life balance.&nbsp; With the initiative launched last year, I would like to ask the Ministry of Manpower for an update and what more the Ministry will do to help to promote more family-friendly practices to help the workers to balance work-life.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

A number of cases where employers do not pay salaries to their workers or when employers have delayed settling their workers' workmen's compensation claims, for example, the case of a foreign worker who was<p align=left>Column: 2349<p>  stranded in Singapore for more than a year and reported in newspapers,&nbsp;show that incidents have increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a spate of industrial accidents, resulting in eight deaths just in the first quarter of this year.&nbsp; In today's <I>Zaobao</I>, a seven-month pregnant childcare teacher was terminated by her employer. According to her, it is because of her pregnancy.&nbsp; Last year, a few such cases of pregnant women being dismissed were reported in the press.&nbsp; The number of people employed on short-term contracts and as part-time employees has also increased.&nbsp; Anecdotally, there is an increasing number of cases where these cases are not paid CPF contributions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these point to the fact that although the unemployment figure has gone down, difficult business conditions and efforts to cut corners and save cost have made the workplace a lot more difficult for workers.&nbsp; Invariably, workers get squeezed and their welfare gets compromised. This also points to the fact that having laws in place alone&nbsp;is not sufficient.&nbsp; What is of greater importance&nbsp;is enforcement of these laws.&nbsp; Equally important is bringing errant employers to task by charging them and making sure that they are penalised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question I would like to ask the Minister is whether MOM can step up enforcement action so as to better protect our workers, particularly now that there are&nbsp;certain categories that are more vulnerable. For example, how many employers have been charged for not paying their workers' wages?&nbsp; How can we reduce the long waiting time before workers are paid their workmen's compensation?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, is there a need to review the number of inspectors that the Ministry employs to ensure enforcement?&nbsp; Thirdly, what more can we do to educate workers on their rights because sometimes, by the<p align=left>Column: 2350<p>  time they discover that they have been shortchanged or they have a problem, it may be too late?&nbsp; What more is being done to educate them?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Your time is up.&nbsp; Mr Teo Yock Ngee.&nbsp; Three minutes.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Yock Ngee (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Workmen's Compensation</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Teo Yock Ngee (Nominated Member)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, I am requesting for an update on the review as regards the salary of employees in respect of the Workmen's Compensation Act and also Part IV of the Employment Act.&nbsp; This is an old question.&nbsp; It has been raised in this House several times.&nbsp; Nevertheless,&nbsp;it is worth looking at it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to 1st July 1992, if a non-manual worker's total earnings exceeded $1,250 per month, he could not claim workmen's compensation under the Act.&nbsp; After the review, with effect from 1st July 1992, the salary of employees, for purpose of claiming the above-mentioned, was amended to $1,500, which was a 20% increase.&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly more than three years later, effective from 1st November 1995, it was again raised to $1,600, an increase of 6.67% which, I believe, was based on the increase in the median salary of workers in Singapore. The respective provisions of the laws were again amended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been more than nine years since the last amendment.&nbsp; May I know what is the position of the Ministry?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sure we are fully aware that this is&nbsp;also tied to Part IV of the Employment Act, which contains provisions on rest days, hours of work, holidays and other conditions of service.&nbsp; The provisions of this Part actually apply to workmen and employees who are in receipt of salaries not exceeding $1,600 a month, not including additional wages such as overtime payment, bonus payment, annual wage supplement and productivity <p align=left>Column: 2351<p> incentive payments.&nbsp; Almost all the relevant clauses in the collective agreements signed between the employers and unions representing the employees are pegged to this salary of $1,600 for purpose of claims under the Workmen's Compensation Act and computing the overtime payment in accordance with Part IV of the Employment Act.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I would like to urge the Ministry to expedite its review process.&nbsp; This is absolutely necessary as the workers in the lower income group would no doubt benefit more, not so much on the claims, but also the additional wages they could receive for their cooperation, support and hard work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Workers' Salary Claim Held on Trust</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Low Thia Khiang</B>:&nbsp; MOM transferred a sum of $25,000 to the Government fund in 2004. This sum consisted of labour court award and salary settlement payments due to workers who are owed money by their employers.&nbsp; The Ministry has not paid the sums over to the workers.&nbsp; I think&nbsp;this is&nbsp;due to&nbsp;an&nbsp;inefficient tracking system.&nbsp; MOM has now required employers to issue cheques in the name of the workers, who are the claimants, instead of MOM, and that the claimants are to collect their cheques within a week.&nbsp; If the workers fail to do so, the unclaimed cheques will be returned to the payers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this may enable&nbsp;MOM to pass the audit by the Auditor-General, is this a responsible solution in helping the workers or is it just an easy way out?&nbsp; First, the employer is now answerable to the workers and not MOM.&nbsp; If the cheque is dishonoured, can the workers afford to sue?&nbsp; Many of them&nbsp;will not have the means to do so.&nbsp; Secondly, the timeframe for collection of cheques is very short.&nbsp; If the cheques are not collected within&nbsp;a <p align=left>Column: 2352<p> week, can MOM, in good conscience, return the cheque to the employer and then wash its hands off&nbsp;the case?&nbsp; Perhaps MOM should take&nbsp;a cue from the Public Trustee's Office which insists on payment for damages&nbsp;of traffic accident victims to go through&nbsp;their bank account and it will ensure that the victims are paid directly.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Volunteer Work Leave</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen (Nominated Member)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, in my maiden speech, I suggested that we have two days of paid leave for employees to do volunteer work.&nbsp; I would like to develop this further to see if the Ministry of Manpower is open to the idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may seem like an odd request, but Singapore is an odd country when it comes to volunteer work.&nbsp; Although our volunteerism rate is catching up with other developed countries, what sets us apart is that there is a drop in the percentage of volunteers when they go into the workforce and it is the reverse elsewhere.&nbsp; Our work-life commitments are such that people may think it is difficult to fit in volunteer work with the demands on their time.&nbsp; Or they may think that volunteer work is the domain of the youth or retirees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The challenge then is to nurture a culture that appreciates and recognises volunteers.&nbsp; For its part, I think all the Government needs to do is to be supportive and provide avenues for the rest of us to take.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paid leave for volunteer work fits the bill.&nbsp; Immediately, volunteerism becomes accessible to everyone.&nbsp; If you know that two days have been set aside for you to volunteer, it heightens your consciousness of community service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a great way to get started.&nbsp; According to a <I>TODAY's</I> article this week, new volunteers prefer \"short-term goal,<p align=left>Column: 2353<p>  oriented assignments\".&nbsp; This is prevalent around the world, but need not be seen as negative, as the work could evolve into \"something more meaningful\", said the report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paid leave for volunteer work&nbsp;has also become the most popular form of support.&nbsp; It is big in Japan and the US. Up to 40% of Australian companies offer paid leave for volunteers and staff are more than willing to take it.&nbsp; There are several ways this can be implemented. Companies can adopt a charity for a year, making it easier to institute a volunteer programme for which staff can use their leave.&nbsp; Or staff can be free to volunteer with organisations in which they have an interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are over 1,000 registered charities in Singapore and more than 800 Institutions of Public Character that could qualify for this policy.&nbsp; It should not be difficult for employers to get written or stamped verification about use of leave for volunteer work.&nbsp; For more flexibility, employees can use the leave on an hourly basis based on the needs of the VWOs they work with.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are all possibilities. What is certain is that numerous studies have shown that paid leave for volunteer work helps to build employee morale.&nbsp; It helps to sustain volunteerism rates and helps to promote good corporate citizenship.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other countries, paid leave for volunteer work is left to companies to decide.&nbsp; But few companies in Singapore provide for this.&nbsp; I know DBS offers its staff two days and KPMG has a community day each September for staff to volunteer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask if the Ministry of Manpower is willing to grant two days' paid leave for local volunteer work under the Employment Act.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Mr Tan Soo Khoon is not here.&nbsp; Mr Ong Ah Heng.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Ah Heng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2354<p> \r\n<p><I>Foreign Domestic Workers</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Ong Ah Heng</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp; Sir, under the new maid guidelines, the maid must be 23 years old and has completed eight years of formal schooling.&nbsp; Because of this stricter requirement, Indonesians maids cannot come to work in Singapore, and the maid agencies face acute shortage of maids to meet the demand.

I am afraid a lot of Singaporeans&nbsp;have the&nbsp;mentality of \"You have it, I must also have it!\".&nbsp; In fact, when given the keys to their HDB flats, many people&nbsp; saw the terrace houses nearby and thought, \"People can stay in terrace houses, why can't I?\"&nbsp; So, they start installing false ornamental ceilings with cornices and&nbsp;hang up chandeliers to satisfy their ego.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether he has any special measures to control the influx of maids due to the reduction in maid levy.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Ratification of ILO Convention 138</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Mdm Halimah Yacob</B>:&nbsp; Sir, Singapore has no child labour.&nbsp; This is obvious to Singaporeans and foreigners alike.&nbsp; Our children are most precious to us and we take great care of their welfare.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in my view, Sir, there is no difficulty for Singapore to ratify key international conventions which deal with the rights of the child.&nbsp;&nbsp;One such international convention is the International Labour Organisation's Convention 138 on minimum age for admission to employment.&nbsp; This is considered a core human rights convention to protect children. &nbsp;Convention 138 is one of the most highly ratified conventions of the ILO.&nbsp; A total of 135 countries out of 176 member states have already ratified it,<p align=left>Column: 2355<p>  including many developed countries which also do not have child labour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the past, we could not ratify Convention 138 because our Employment Act is not in line with it.&nbsp; Under this Convention, children are not allowed to enter the workforce before the age of 15.&nbsp; However, children between the age of 13 and 15 may perform light work if it does not affect their education.&nbsp; Beyond 15, they can work as long as the work is not dangerous or hazardous to their health.&nbsp;With the amendment last year, our law is now in line with the Convention. There appears to be no other difficulty in ratifying this Convention.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to my question in Parliament last September, the Minister had said that the Government would ratify Convention 138 expeditiously.&nbsp; Can I get a clarification from the Minister as to how soon this will be and how expeditious?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower (Mr Hawazi Daipi)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</B> Sir, I would like to thank Members who have spoken on workers' welfare.&nbsp; As we move forward and even as we improve the flexibility and responsiveness of our labour force, we must look after the interests and well-being of our workers, both local and foreign workers.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workers' safety and workmen's compensation are integral components of basic well-being.&nbsp; So I am pleased to inform Mr Teo Yock Ngee that MOM has reviewed the existing workmen's compensation system. We agree that it can be further enhanced to expedite the assessment of compensation for injured workmen.&nbsp; Specifically, we will be setting up a medical board to assist in the settlement of disputes over medical assessments.&nbsp;I think this is the way forward. We want to make sure that the assessment can be concluded expeditiously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2356<p> \r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Teo has asked how workmen's compensation is computed and whether it is adequate.&nbsp; Workmen's compensation is calculated based on the average monthly earnings of the injured worker and takes into account factors such as the injured worker's age, his potential loss of earnings and the percentage of permanent incapacity he sustained. The definition used is in line with international standards.&nbsp; Where the injured worker is unable to perform the essential actions of life, it will also take into account the cost he will incur for constant care.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM periodically reviews the Workmen's Compensation Act to ensure adequacy of coverage of our workforce. The Act which applies to manual workers and non-manual workers with monthly earnings not exceeding $1,600 covers about 47% of the workforce. On average, only 2% of the cases reported to MOM were rejected yearly over the past&nbsp;four years on the ground of income exceeding $1,600.&nbsp; So the proportion of workers who could not qualify to claim under the Workmen's Compensation Act is really small.&nbsp; But even for workers who are not currently covered under the Act, many of those who are in industries with higher risk exposure, such as marine and petrochemical, already enjoy various forms of insurance coverage provided by their employers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now talk about&nbsp;salary payment raised by Mdm Halimah Yacob and Mr Low Thia Khiang. Apart from safety, salary payment&nbsp;by employers is another integral part of the basic well-being of our workforce.&nbsp; There is no excuse for employers not to pay salaries to their workers punctually.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah Yacob asked about the non-payment of salaries, where there have been a few high profile cases last year involving large construction companies defaulting on the salaries of both foreign and local workers.&nbsp; In particular, the case of Wan Soon Construction, which involved some 440 <p align=left>Column: 2357<p> workers, mainly from India, Bangladesh, China and Thailand,</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>attracted much media attention.&nbsp; Fortunately, that case was resolved amicably with the aid of the Indian High Commission.&nbsp; The Wan Soon case illustrates to us the importance of early reporting of salary arrears.&nbsp; Early reporting prevents salary arrears from accumulating and enables MOM to resolve disputes more expeditiously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The total number of cases involving salary arrears in the non-unionised sector last year fell by 4% as compared to 2003, that is,&nbsp;from 6,690 in 2003 to 6,422 last year, and it fell by&nbsp;34% as compared with 2002.&nbsp; The number of companies who have defaulted on employee CPF payments has likewise come down since 2002.&nbsp; So, the situation has improved over the last&nbsp;three years.&nbsp; Sir, notwithstanding this, MOM will continue to strengthen our enforcement measures, including targeted audits of companies in selected industries with high incidences of salary arrears.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also step up the prosecution of companies who deliberately flout labour laws, and directors or other managers who act irresponsibly in the management of their workers' well-being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure the payment of salaries in sectors with higher default rates, one measure which is being studied is to require employers to pay their workers through GIRO.&nbsp; Errant employers who default on salaries could be flagged out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now touch on other benefits, including extended maternity leave and&nbsp;childcare leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has asked for an update on the implementation of the extended maternity leave and childcare leave, which were launched last year.&nbsp; I am pleased to inform Members that both have been well accepted by employers.&nbsp; Following a series of briefings for HR practitioners and union leaders to explain<p align=left>Column: 2358<p>  the policy rationale and provide practical guidelines for implementation, most companies are now able to implement these benefits without any difficulties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry is also administering the Work-Life Works!, or WoW!, Fund that provides funding to companies to implement worklife strategies. Since the launch of the fund in August last year, we have approved 15 applications at a total cost of $343,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Government strongly encourages volunteerism and for employers to support their employees who contribute their time to charitable causes.&nbsp; Most volunteers willingly take their own time and leave to do this.&nbsp; There is no necessity to legislate paid leave for volunteer work as proposed by Ms Eunice Olsen, as this might dilute the sacrifice of their efforts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo also suggested a revamp of the existing employer-provided medical benefit scheme to enable employees to enjoy medical coverage, not only during employment, but also in-between employment and post-retirement.&nbsp; Following the recommendation by the Economic Restructuring Committee to implement either the Portable Medical Benefits Scheme&nbsp;(PMBS), or the Transferable Medical Insurance Scheme (TMIS), a set of tripartite implementation guidelines was issued on 1st October 2003.&nbsp; However, the progress of both the PMBS and TMIS has been slow, with only about 400 companies having implemented either scheme. &nbsp;Under the PMBS, employers make additional monthly contributions to their employees' Medisave accounts to pay for the premiums of MediShield or MediShield equivalent products. &nbsp;As the PMBS rides on the MediShield scheme, many employers have been waiting for the result of the MediShield review by the Ministry of Health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOH has recently announced changes to the MediShield Scheme. In this regard, I agree with Mr Yeo that employers, trade<p align=left>Column: 2359<p>  unions and related Government agencies, including MOM, MOH, MOF and MAS, could work together to examine how&nbsp;PMBS or other employer-provided medical benefits schemes could be refined and integrated into the revamped MediShield framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On foreign domestic workers raised by Mr Ong Ah Heng, Sir, let me say that in this area we have done a lot.&nbsp; Mr Ong&nbsp;has asked whether we are willing to review&nbsp;the&nbsp;inclusion&nbsp;of new&nbsp;countries, such as Cambodia and Vietnam, as source countries.&nbsp; Sir, there are currently many approved source countries from which employers can recruit foreign domestic workers (FDWs). The list includes Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand.&nbsp; The existing list of approved source countries is able to supply sufficient foreign domestic workers who can meet the new entry requirements.&nbsp; The $50 levy reduction which will take effect from 1st April will further ensure that employers could afford to pay more for better quality foreign domestic workers from&nbsp;existing source countries.&nbsp; Nevertheless, my Ministry will continue to monitor the situation and review this, if it is necessary, in future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong expressed concern that the number of foreign domestic workers may increase significantly in response to the levy reduction. &nbsp;Employers who need foreign domestic workers could employ them, but they must also ensure that their foreign domestic workers are being well taken care of.&nbsp; Those who have not done so have been banned from hiring foreign domestic workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Ong also talked about new measures taken by&nbsp;MOM to check for the quality of foreign domestic workers.&nbsp; The FDW entry test should not be viewed in isolation.&nbsp; My Ministry has introduced <p align=left>Column: 2360<p> several measures to raise the quality of FDWs.&nbsp; In January this year, the minimum age for new foreign domestic workers was raised from 18 to 23 years old, and they are required to have had at least&nbsp;eight years of formal education. &nbsp;The entry test is meant as a broad tool to verify that they can read and understand basic safety instructions, as well as have some numeracy and literacy skills in order to perform household tasks and communicate with the employers. &nbsp; English is used because it is the working language.&nbsp; The recent <I>Straits Times</I> feature on foreign domestic workers also highlighted language barrier as the main cause of misunderstandings between the employers and foreign domestic workers.&nbsp; Dr Chia Boon Hock, a psychiatrist who monitors foreign domestic workers' suicide rates, was quoted as saying that foreign domestic workers who \u201cdo not speak English well\ufffd? are \u201clike lost souls\ufffd? in a \u201cstrange new land\ufffd?.&nbsp; Nonetheless, my Ministry has been practical about the entry test, and as far as possible, most of these questions are picture-related or picture-based.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we welcome feedback from Mr Ong, other Members&nbsp;and other interested parties. &nbsp;We will periodically review the format of the test so that&nbsp;it could be re-configured to better meet our goals of bringing in better qualified, more mature, foreign domestic workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Mdm Halimah Yacob has again asked whether the Government will ratify the International Labour Organisation Convention 138.&nbsp; Now that the Employment Act has been amended to raise the minimum working age to be in line with the requirements of Convention 138, we are working towards ratifying the Convention within this year.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The other&nbsp;point&nbsp;I cited is the Auditor-General's report 2004 that about $25,000 was transferred back to Government fund.&nbsp; MOM held in trust the unpaid salary of workers, but failed to track them down, and so the amount&nbsp;was not paid to the workers, thereby requiring the transfer of the money back to the Government.&nbsp; What are the circumstances&nbsp;for MOM&nbsp;not being able to track down the addresses of these workers?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hawazi Daipi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

So it is easier for us to require the employers to pay directly to the workers.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the figure mentioned by Mr Low about the money being transferred back to the Government indicates the difficulties in us tracking the workers, especially foreign domestic workers.&nbsp; Sir, whatever measures we take may not necessarily be foolproof.&nbsp; What we want to do is to ensure, in the first instance, that the number of cases of non-payment of salary is reduced.&nbsp; And one way to do it is by requiring employers, in some industries, to pay their workers through GIRO.&nbsp; So it is easier for us to minimise the problem of non-payment of salary and that would reduce the problem for the workers in future.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Government, in general, encourages voluntarism and we will always encourage civil servants to show examples.&nbsp; But requiring or advising companies or even encouraging them to offer paid leave may instil rigidity in the system and&nbsp;it does not necessarily encourage further voluntarism.&nbsp;

If we say that it only affects you when you are here, and when you leave, the stock out there, and the stock in here, is increasing aggregately all the time.&nbsp; So after a while, you may have actually a few million people that could churn and change your society.&nbsp; So we accept that we are a small country and that there needs to be some restriction.&nbsp; It is a practical approach.&nbsp; We are not ideologically bound by it, but it is&nbsp;a practical approach.&nbsp;

These interest rates are in terms of Singapore Government special securities provided by MOF.&nbsp; So what Mr Low says is not true -&nbsp;that CPF money is put into SGIC specifically to invest and there is one to one market-based return for the interest rates.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp;for CPF to pay 4% and 2.5%, as Members have previously explained, sometimes it is above the market yield.&nbsp; So if&nbsp;we look at the 10-year bond yield, 4% is certainly much higher than our current 10-year Singapore Government&nbsp;securities yield.&nbsp; We have said that in the longer term&nbsp;-&nbsp;and we have said this publicly -&nbsp;we should move towards this&nbsp;long-term yield, and we need time for our own instruments to mature before we know what the right rate is.&nbsp; Currently, we pay 2.5%&nbsp; as a guaranteed floor, and 4%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to Mr Low's specific question on whether we should put it to&nbsp;SGIC to manage, I think it is theoretical.&nbsp;

I agree with the Minister on the three principles of reducing risks&nbsp; - &nbsp;to promote self-regulation, to have ownership for safety, and also to use penalty to develop a safety culture.&nbsp; But what is important in terms of reducing risks, I think we have to have&nbsp;a framework to avoid risks in the first place.&nbsp; For example, in the construction industry, we need to look into durable design, maintainable design and safe design.&nbsp; I think we need to have a framework so that upstream,&nbsp;we will avoid risks rather than to look into reducing risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to check whether the Ministry is working with BCA and MND to look into this area.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What is the framework to carry out enforcement to ensure safety on site?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In terms of reducing risks, he is right.&nbsp; That is one of the cardinal principles which we enunciated&nbsp;- first principle that we should reduce risk at source.&nbsp; Specifically, the UK has what they call the construction, design, management (CDM) legislation, which basically means that you should try to design out&nbsp;risk.&nbsp; When we visited these corporations during our trip, they said, \"Yes, let's build it into the legislation.\"&nbsp; So I teased them and said, \"If Norman Foster decides to build a weird gherkin, will you speak to Norman Foster?\"&nbsp; They said, \"Yes, we have done so, and he has changed the design.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, in their system, they have internalised these aspects and they have designed out risk, not only to build but to maintain.&nbsp; How long will we take to get there? I think it will take&nbsp;some time.&nbsp; We will build the legislation for that but we need to involve our stakeholders as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second point about ownership, what framework do we want to put in?&nbsp; I&nbsp;agree with him that&nbsp;it cannot be done in vacuo.&nbsp; We will have to build a structure and a platform that the industry and partners can congregate and move from.&nbsp; And this is exactly the idea that we have started in terms of the Workplace Safety and Health Council.&nbsp; The Council will comprise representatives - top management&nbsp;&nbsp; - who will steer and drive reforms, and they will be the ones who will set standards and advise the Ministry on what needs to be done and what can be done.&nbsp; The Ministry will still continue to set standards and overall targets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For enforcement, I agree with him that capabilities will have to be built as we<p align=left>Column: 2370<p>  move into this new framework.&nbsp; That is why we are stepping up our own MOM's enforcement agency.&nbsp; We will be sending safety officers for longer attachments to places with better safety records&nbsp; -&nbsp; Sweden, UK&nbsp; -&nbsp; for them to learn how to regulate in this new framework.&nbsp; I am confident that if we put this framework into place,&nbsp; we can build a safety culture.&nbsp; But we will provide periodical updates.&nbsp; The Workplace Safety and Health Council will give annual reports so that we all know where we are headed and whether we have improved.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Geh Min-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Let me look into the details.&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Nominated Member of Parliament may be<p align=left>Column: 2371<p>  alluding to is that for individual spouses, the amount that was used from the&nbsp;CPF to&nbsp;purchase&nbsp;the flat, even after divorce, goes back to the individual member.&nbsp; This would be no different, for example, when we protect the CPF even from liability from creditors.&nbsp; So let me look into the issue because it is a specific question.&nbsp; I do not have the answer at hand.&nbsp; It is not our intention to disregard homemakers.&nbsp; We value them.&nbsp; But as&nbsp;she rightly pointed out, it&nbsp;stands as an individual account.&nbsp; But we do make provision for members to contribute to their family members in a number of ways.&nbsp; For example, you can use Medisave for relatives, you can use CPF to buy jointly for houses, as I showed you the figures, they indeed do.&nbsp; And 94% of spouses own the assets from which the funds may have come predominantly from the other partner.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"center\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal\">[Mr Deputy Speaker&nbsp;(Mr S.

So I think the philosophy is correct.&nbsp; Whether we can move at the margin, I think we can.&nbsp; There will always be room.&nbsp; As for the specific question, I invite the NMP to raise a specific&nbsp;Question for Oral Answer&nbsp;so that I can have more of the facts&nbsp;at hand to answer.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr S Iswaran-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman:</B>&nbsp; Mr Yeo, do you wish to withdraw the amendment?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</B> Sir, I would like&nbsp;to thank the Minister and&nbsp;Senior Parliamentary Secretary&nbsp;for their comprehensive response to our concerns and questions raised.&nbsp; I am particularly pleased with the Minister's reassurance to<p align=left>Column: 2372<p>  strengthen Government's efforts to help Singaporean workers face employment challenges and his commitment to make Singapore a safe workplace for all.&nbsp; With this note, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn</i>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sum of $173,058,340 for Head&nbsp;S ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sum of $47,547,200 for Head&nbsp;S ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:HEAD I - MINISTRY OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, YOUTH AND SPORTS--><p align=left>Column: 2372<p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr S Iswaran-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Head I - Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman:</B>&nbsp; Head I, Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports.

Sir, I stand here today to ask if the Minister would help me&nbsp;keep these promises.&nbsp; We want each MP to be&nbsp;able to leave this House at the end of the day and&nbsp;be able to give the same assurance to their residents.&nbsp; I know that our PM has said that he cannot promise a comfortable life for all.&nbsp; He does not want to breed an \"entitlement mentality\" among Singaporeans.&nbsp; I agree with him that \"the best way to help such lower income households is by creating job opportunities for the unemployed and education&nbsp;opportunities for&nbsp;their children\".&nbsp; This is the long-term way to help them to climb out of the poverty trap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not asking for welfare.&nbsp; All I ask for is, if we can promise a simple life, with a simple promise.&nbsp; I ask if we can promise that no Singaporean child needs &nbsp;to worry that he cannot afford school.&nbsp; That no sick Singaporean will worry that he will be wheeled out of the hospital without care.&nbsp; That no family will be forced to sleep in the streets, if their home is force sold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n <p align=left>Column: 2374<p> \r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these are basic needs.&nbsp; But I know that it is not easy to meet them.&nbsp; Even wealthy countries, such as America and Japan, have people sleeping in the streets.&nbsp; Healthcare is not a simple matter, and the cost of healthcare has increased even as our knowledge of illnesses has increased.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against this backdrop of growing concern for the down and out, I am glad that the Government has now initiated the ComCare Fund to provide added relief and help to allay some of the concerns of Singaporeans.&nbsp; I would therefore like to thank the Prime Minister for initiating this $500 million ComCare Fund.&nbsp; However, they say that the devil is in the details.&nbsp; I just have three quick queries for the Minister.&nbsp; First, in spite of the many existing and different schemes, many people in need may still be unaware of them, to make full use of these resources to alleviate their situation.&nbsp; For instance, the CPF Top-up Scheme, for year 2003, 400,000 eligible Singaporeans have not put in at least $50 into their CPF account to qualify for the second lot of Economic Restructuring Shares, and one third of them are senior citizens.&nbsp; Presumably, many of those who are entitled to&nbsp;handouts are not aware.&nbsp; Can the Minister tell us how this can be addressed for the present schemes as well as for the ComCare Fund?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, with the introduction of ComCare Fund, will any current schemes be discontinued to rationalise and streamline administration of all these existing schemes?&nbsp; And thirdly, there are some Singaporeans who do not meet the criteria for the various schemes, yet they are actually in need of assistance.&nbsp; Will the ComCare Fund be administered with more flexibility?&nbsp; Will it adopt a looser and less strict approach towards such Singaporeans who are deemed too \"rich\" to be eligible, and yet too \"poor\" to sustain their costs of living?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

<B>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B>&nbsp; Sir, I could recall very well when I was a young man, way back in the 70s, we were a family of six, our parents and four siblings.&nbsp; The six of us lived in a rental flat in Mei Ling Street.&nbsp; My father was&nbsp;the sole breadwinner and he worked as a security guard at a shipyard in Jurong, earning a monthly salary of about $700.&nbsp; With that salary and some overtime, he struggled but was able to maintain a decent living for the family and put all of us through school.&nbsp; We all survived, grew up and turned out to be okay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving forward, Sir, to where we are now, 35 years later, our country has developed to a first-class status, with a better standard of living, a more educated population, better infrastructure and facilities, industrialised and modern.&nbsp; Sometimes, I wonder and seriously doubt if a family, like the one that my dad had, would be able to survive with a single salary of a security guard, or even an equivalent job like a cleaner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on a month-to-month basis, with the exception of clothing, prices for all items in the CPI basket of goods and services have increased, with food and education and healthcare seeing large increases in both month-to-month and year-to-year basis.&nbsp; This goes to show that the basic cost of living in Singapore is rising.&nbsp; This is a major concern for all.&nbsp; What are we doing to ensure that ever increasing costs of living do not strip Singaporeans of a decent quality of life?&nbsp; Have we stopped to ask ourselves:&nbsp;are the majority of Singaporeans able to cope with the current cost of living?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just the other day, I had an interesting conversation with some of my colleagues about the so-called \"choosy Singaporean workers\" that we so readily blame for not accepting low paying jobs, jobs that pay around $500 to $800 a month,&nbsp;and how<p align=left>Column: 2376<p>  we praise the foreign workers for their right attitudes in accepting those jobs and how hardworking these workers are compared to our locals.&nbsp; Then I realise we are not comparing apple&nbsp;with apple.&nbsp; Do I agree that a low paying job is still better than no job?&nbsp; We have to be realistic.&nbsp; How do we expect a family of six with school-going children whose household bills, and more, to survive with a salary of $800?&nbsp; Surprisingly, someone suggests that maybe it is better to outsource the care of the family to another country that has a lower standard of living.&nbsp; Then we are comparing apple&nbsp;with apple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have seen the rapid development of our country and sometimes we have seen in other countries&nbsp;that this rapid development unintentionally creates an underclass community which is left behind.&nbsp;I believe that we must have a better understanding of the&nbsp;cost needed to sustain a decent living for a typical Singaporean family.&nbsp;&nbsp;Attention must&nbsp;be given to the cost of procuring the basic necessities.&nbsp; In recent years, we have seen more and more asking for help and falling through the cracks of our system.&nbsp; Though I totally agree with our policy of not becoming a welfare state, we still need to improve our welfare system.&nbsp; Once this is done, we would be in a better position to prevent the creation of an underclass community.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, this Budget has brought much good news for the poor and the&nbsp;underprivileged in Singapore.&nbsp; In particular, I am very heartened to hear about the ComCare&nbsp;Fund that the Prime Minister has announced.&nbsp; Like Mr Sin Boon Ann, I would like to ask how exactly is this fund going to work in its three components of ComCare&nbsp;self-reliance, ComCare grow and ComCare enable.&nbsp; How can we approve the delivery of services to the poor under these new frameworks?&nbsp; How will the role<p align=left>Column: 2377<p>  of VWOs be, especially for things like family service centres?&nbsp; Will they be adequately funded in the light of new stresses on the system with more people out of work?&nbsp; How can we address the problems of children of poor families and how can we still continue to encourage self-reliance?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the poor are not the homogeneous group.&nbsp; One might say there are three groups:&nbsp;those who generally cannot get&nbsp;a job because of infirmity or lack of skills;&nbsp;those who will not accept a job because they deem&nbsp;that the jobs on offer are below their skills and experience level and not worth their while in salary; and those who have gotten a job, no matter how menial or poorly paid because they recognise that something is better than nothing.&nbsp; I hope that the Minister will adjust our policy of assistance to the needy to favour those who have already taken on&nbsp;a job, even if it does not pay enough to meet their current needs as they are proven by their actions, that is, taking on a job that they are prepared to help themselves.&nbsp; I also want to say that for this group, we should particularly look after their children to make sure that their children's education is not compromised because the father's or the mother's salary is insufficient.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many initiatives have been announced for families who fulfil the Singaporean ideal of two children and two legally married parents.&nbsp; This has been so in the past.&nbsp; I would like to highlight the plight of the non-standard families in Singapore, the dysfunctional ones, the single parents who were never married, families hit by divorce and death of a spouse, catastrophic illness, and those who have had too many children.&nbsp; I can understand the rationale for the policies and the signal that we must send that we strongly encourage traditional nuclear families who make responsible decisions to bring a child into the world, either to look after the child themselves or put<p align=left>Column: 2378<p>  them up for adoption by responsible people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I would like to speak up for the children of such families.&nbsp; They did not ask to be born to such a family.&nbsp; When the family is without proper shelter, food or school fees, it is the children who suffer hunger and malnutrition, obesity and sedentary lifestyle because the parents have no time to take them out.&nbsp;It is the children who suffer physical and emotional abuse when parents divorce or go their separate ways.&nbsp; I believe we must find a way to deal with their problems separately from those of their parents.&nbsp; I believe we must acknowledge, deal with and prevent child abuse that tends to arise in such situations.&nbsp; And I thank Mr Hawazi for his assurance that children who have dropped out of school because of poverty must be able to find a way back into the system.&nbsp; I hope that the Minister will continue to share with us how the new ComCare scheme would be able to meet the needs of our poor and needy.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

They are up to<p align=left>Column: 2379<p>  their necks with debts, arrears and mortgage repayments, rental, utility charges, service and conservancy charges, etc.&nbsp; What can be done to help them?&nbsp; Piecemeal solutions are not always suitable.&nbsp; For a resident with problems with his mortgage repayment, we could write to HDB to reduce the monthly repayment or to defer payment for a period.&nbsp; If he needs help with arrears of his utility or service and conservancy charges, we could appeal for affordable instalment repayment plans or to the CDC for help under the Utility and S&amp;CC Assistance Schemes.&nbsp; But if we do not address the underlying causes, the help will be shortlived.&nbsp; This short spell of calm will break when the grace period runs out.&nbsp; When he returns, the situation could be worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problems must be solved holistically.&nbsp; We need to pool all these problems together to understand them as a whole.&nbsp; Doing so, we can then determine the real underlying causes and formulate long-term solutions for the resident.&nbsp; The resident is also helped to understand his problem and the solution that is proposed.&nbsp; But to do this, we must have sufficient social workers and counsellors who are properly trained, whose tasks include seeking holistic solutions, and who are given time and resources to do so.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we also need the support system that empathises with the poor and their problems.&nbsp; I spoke on this matter during the Budget debate.&nbsp; Financial support must be managed with some flexibility.&nbsp; For example, it is not helpful to tell an applicant that he cannot be given financial help because a family member is working when the latter could be earning a few hundred dollars doing odd jobs, an amount hardly enough to support a family.&nbsp; For many needy families, the real answer is jobs that provide a reasonable steady family income for those who can work.&nbsp; They must be helped to find a job to<p align=left>Column: 2380<p>  prepare for one, if necessary.&nbsp; Up to now, those who need jobs are matched and told to go for interviews.&nbsp; Each position usually ends up with several applicants, and all but one will go away disappointed, with travel expenses incurred.&nbsp; Some turn up, only to be told that the vacancy has been filled.&nbsp; Others are mismatched.&nbsp; Those who are matched a few times are dropped from the queue and told to re-apply.&nbsp; Some residents told me that they felt as if the Government is merely going through the motion but is not serious in helping them.&nbsp; We know that is not true.&nbsp; So, civil servants must improve in the delivery of their services and show empathy during their contact.&nbsp; At the bottom line, what we need are more than appropriate jobs for those who are looking for work.&nbsp; However, for the old, those who can no longer work and the very young, the Government and society must work together through many-helping-hands to help them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, our people must make the efforts to help themselves.&nbsp; Some in trouble are in this plight because they did not prepare themselves to face difficult times or old age.&nbsp; Not only that, they may have even spent their future income by borrowing on credit cards and buying things they do not need or can ill afford on hire purchase.&nbsp; How do we promote and develop financial awareness and resilience among Singaporeans?&nbsp; How can we get our people to prepare for difficult times, such as in an economic downturn or a loss of income when we have to stop work or when we grow old, by saving more when we are young or when times are good?&nbsp; Our people must be encouraged to do this.&nbsp; This is crucial when we are moving into the new global economy where change is rapid and inevitable.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Together with the local grassroots organisations, I hope that we can now reach out to those who have fallen through the cracks.&nbsp; I hope that&nbsp;ComCare will pay attention to those who are struggling but ignored by existing assistance schemes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried to make a count.&nbsp; I believe there are&nbsp;at least nine social assistance schemes administered by the CDCs.&nbsp; In addition, we have private foundations, self-help and volunteer groups, each having also set up funds for the poor.&nbsp; So, on the surface, we do seem to have many help schemes.&nbsp; But the question is, how effective are all of us in reaching out to the poor, especially the chronic cases?&nbsp; The set up of a ComCare supervisory committee to customise help programmes that meet specific needs and to streamline existing schemes will be steps in the right direction.&nbsp; However, I ask the Minister to consider giving more flexibility to the CDC and the GROs on the ground to enable them to customise assistance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the 18th February 2005 sitting of Parliament, I asked about the number of children in schools that were below a certain per capita income.&nbsp; Fifty children of this year's Primary 1 intake indicated that their parents are retirees.&nbsp; I have no data on school children with parents who are unemployed.&nbsp; Only the local GROs would be able to sieve out these families and render assistance.&nbsp; Hence, I would like to ask the Minister if he would give the resources to the CDCs and local GROs to come to the aid of the two groups that I believe could benefit from more attention.&nbsp; These two groups are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; The spritely aged who need an income; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; The aged with young kids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2382<p> \r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not asking for dole-outs.&nbsp; Much as we have come across residents in our constituencies asking for their share of hand-outs, by and large, I maintain faith that Singaporeans retain good work ethics.&nbsp; But they must have work.&nbsp; Hence, help that is most appreciated must be in the form of employment for the spritely aged.&nbsp; I came across a 78-year-old woman who spends her mornings selling second-hand goods at a church's thrift shop.&nbsp; I came across a 68-year-old who pressed for a Yakult door-to-door sales licence to help support a grandchild of&nbsp;a divorced son.&nbsp; I came across a 60-year-old man who asked for work as he said that he had spent all his meagre savings on the funeral of his aged mother.&nbsp; He was single all his life, devoting it to looking after his late mother.&nbsp; Now alone, penniless, all he wanted was a job.&nbsp; For these aged, there is no work to be found.&nbsp; Hence, I believe that there is a category of the aged poor who want to be given a chance of self-sustenance and independence.&nbsp; Some may have dependants, but often we hear that their offsprings are already stretched ekeing out a living, much less looking after aged parents.&nbsp; I do not know how many of these aged, unemployed and needy are out there.&nbsp; If there are 20 of them, there must easily be 1,000 of them in the 84 constituencies.&nbsp; They need customised help.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister what is the social safety net for these people?&nbsp; What can we do to create the jobs for them through our local work schemes to get employers to employ them and to make it worthwhile for employers to take on older workers on a part-time basis?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other category that needs attention is aged parents with a young set of children.&nbsp; In the examples that I have come across, they are usually families with low and irregular income, some daily-rated, which means no-work-no-pay.&nbsp; However, once they cannot work for any length of time due to illness or other reasons,<p align=left>Column: 2383<p>  they plunge straight into financial hardship.&nbsp; These families scrape by and are literally hanging by their fingernails.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, rendering help to those in their 50s to 80s with no job, no CPF nor anyone to turn to is of utmost urgency.&nbsp; I hope ComCare funds can be channelled to especially help this group.&nbsp; The women folk are especially vulnerable, as over 90% of women aged 60 and above have less than secondary education and, therefore, fewer work opportunities.&nbsp; Many of the poor, especially the elderly, are often ignorant and isolated from the help that they are eligible for.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will MCYS set up a central register for our destitute, chronic poor and disabled, so that effective and thorough assistance can be rendered to them without anyone falling by the wayside?&nbsp; Will MCYS ensure that there are more social workers, working in conjunction with grassroots and voluntary organisations in the community, trained to engage and follow up on those in this register?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a slew of schemes available to help those in financial hardship that it makes them difficult to follow and to administer.&nbsp; Will MCYS help integrate them and make them more comprehensible?&nbsp; Will MCYS vet through our existing available schemes to remove stifling benchmarks and blanket rules to make sure that fewer fall through the system's cracks and also to factor in the<p align=left>Column: 2384<p>  complexities of an individual's needs?&nbsp; For example, we cannot always presume that the aged will always receive care from their families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, everyone accepts that health promotion and disease strategies to enable the elderly to remain fit and active in the community are the most&nbsp;effective ways in getting the best outcome in an ageing population.&nbsp; Could MCYS set up Centres of Activity to achieve this purpose?&nbsp; These centres aim to keep the mobile elderly fit and healthy for as long as possible through the concept of maintaining physical, mental and social well-being of the elderly, especially the less well-off elderly.&nbsp; Will MCYS set up such centres together with MOH at community centres or RC centres involving the grassroots groups and other volunteers from the community?&nbsp; I hope ComCare Fund can be used to fund such centres island-wide.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Sir, the $1 billion ComCare fund recognises the size of the challenges that we face today and tomorrow.&nbsp; Present challenges are families in various needs and those displaced by the changing economy.&nbsp; Future challenges will be all these, plus the problems of an ageing population.&nbsp; However, depending on the Government alone will never be sufficient.&nbsp; With the $1 billion fund, it is easy to rely on the money to <I>\"pu cai xiao xai\"</I>, just to tackle the problems of today rather than develop long-term strategies to combat the woes of tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, would the Minister elaborate on:\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; The specific strategies of the ComCare Fund;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Whether there is any specific fund allocation for short, medium and long-term challenges that Singapore faces;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; What is the desired tangible outcome of the ComCare Fund?&nbsp; For<p align=left>Column: 2385<p>  example, is there a target education level to be achieved within a specific time period under the ComCare Grow Fund?&nbsp; Will the desired outcome for the ComCare include KPIs of eldercare centres, special work villages for the disabled and the not so physically well and, if so, in what timeframe?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; What is the exact disbursement mechanism of the ComCare Fund?&nbsp; Will CDCs be given a similar budget based on per capita, or compete for funding in a free-for-all first-come-first-served approach?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; How does the ComCare Fund tie in with the many-helping-hands approach?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should build a society that is resilient and values self-help before reaching out to the community or private sector for all kinds of assistance.&nbsp; Cultivating a society of responsible citizens who are proud of their achievements is the only long-term sustainable safety net that Singapore should strive to achieve.&nbsp; I am sure that we do not want our many-helping-hands approach to become a many-grabbing-hands approach.&nbsp; Could the Minister assure this House that&nbsp;ComCare Fund would reinforce the many-helping-hands approach so that people would continue to discharge their family and social obligations towards the needy and the elderly?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, CDCs were set up in 1997 as a district administration for community programmes.&nbsp; Over the last two years, the role of the CDCs has been more active, especially in&nbsp;local job placements and financial assistance.&nbsp; For job placements over the last two years, I hope the CDCs have realised that holding job fairs does not mean successful job placement.&nbsp; It requires personal counselling and even equipping residents with interview skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2386<p> \r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the last two years, for short-term financial help, the CDC has adopted a broad-brush approach to these applicants.&nbsp; This can be seen in the drop of at least two-thirds of the cases for six months' help and those given three months' help.&nbsp; This means that after three months, the cases are dropped off and presumably the residents are back to their feet.&nbsp; With the ComCare Fund, which is targeted at needy families, CDCs need to be more focused.&nbsp; It should be on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; Many cases need financial help, lack family support and need counselling for themselves as well as their dependants.&nbsp; It must be more targeted, with a comprehensive understanding of the family situation, targeted counselling and assistance with follow-up, so that families can be self-reliant as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CDCs' quick and decisive response to the changing needs of the people is critical.&nbsp; With the increasing importance of the CDCs' role of self-help, more appropriate resources must be deployed to the CDCs.&nbsp; We need more social workers who are able to understand their family needs and provide the necessary counselling than general public relations and events organisers.&nbsp; In addition, with the increased budget for financial assistance, CDCs should be transparent in the use of the funds.&nbsp; There must be key performance indicators on the:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Number of cases helped;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(4)&nbsp; Accountability for the administrative cost of managing these funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would use the example of Community Chest.&nbsp; It has prided itself on the low cost of the collection and administration of funds.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

<B>Dr Warren Lee</B>:&nbsp; Sir, what is the Government doing to ensure quality care for the elderly in the community?&nbsp; Can I suggest a solution that brings together the roles of MCYS, MOH and our private sector family physicians?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, GPs&nbsp;are ubiquitous in every HDB community and they are part of the HDB experience that Minister Mah speaks of with&nbsp;such passion.&nbsp; Many would make good and great primary care doctors and case managers for the elderly if they could practise partially-subsidised care.&nbsp; By this I mean that the professional fees will be at private rates but their medication could be at subsidised rates in that the Government could specify a basket of basic drugs for chronic care conditions&nbsp;which GPs could stock at polyclinic prices and which citizens could purchase with their portable healthcare subsidies or with their MCYS benefits, irregardless of whether they see a primary practitioner in the private sector or at the polyclinic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For most people, Sir, it is no more an expensive medication but appropriate use of standard medications that will make the difference. &nbsp;This scheme would make the cost of quality&nbsp;GP care more affordable, allow the sick elderly to&nbsp;grey gracefully in place.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the GP could become the case manager for the elderly without much&nbsp;additional cost and resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many of the medical problems of the elderly and sick are common conditions that are amenable to standardised care algorithms and amenable to be cared by trained staff under the care of a fully trained professional.&nbsp; Older workers, such as retired executives, technical or supervisory staff entering the healthcare sector in their 40s and 50s could have a 15-20-year career as healthcare assistant<p align=left>Column: 2388<p>  professionals and care coordinators and they can&nbsp;help to exercise, transport and accompany the frail elderly to clinics and to assist in social work, physiotherapy and rehabilitative medicine therapy.&nbsp; Instead of needing to employ foreign paramedical staff, Singaporeans could be trained to do these jobs and, in so doing, get employment themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, we will be developing the grey sector and reducing our dependence on foreign labour.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Training older workers and the well-elderly to&nbsp;take care of the frail elderly will free up&nbsp;valuable labour for wealth generating economic activities while relieving many&nbsp;families of the stark choice of looking after the grandmother versus getting a job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, other MPs may have alluded to also the need for more inter-agency cooperation in terms of ensuring a barrier-free&nbsp;environment for our elderly.&nbsp; But I would like to once again bring up the point that creating an elderly-friendly environment in&nbsp;our HDB heartlands requires the cooperation and commonsense judgement of officers from many agencies.&nbsp; I&nbsp;wish to&nbsp;point&nbsp;out that while there has been much improvement in this&nbsp;area, more&nbsp;can and&nbsp;needs to be done.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While each agency, such as HDB, LTA, Town&nbsp;Council and the like has done its part and looked after the buildings, pavements or roads under its purview according to the building-free accessibility&nbsp;and&nbsp;building codes&nbsp;and such other codes, the sum is sometimes less than its parts because it only takes one&nbsp;kerb or step to&nbsp;make it impossible for the elderly or handicapped to get from A to B.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</B> Sir, as our population ages, we will see more and more elderly singles and&nbsp;given the present trends, an increasing number&nbsp;will be&nbsp;singles who have never married before.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2389<p>  We also see a rising number of elderly singles who are married before but either divorced or widowed. &nbsp;Some of them have no family support or come from dysfunctional families.&nbsp; Some&nbsp;of them have become physically disabled through old age and have to rely on walking aids or wheelchairs to get about.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see them at my MPS quite regularly, Changkat being an ageing estate.&nbsp; Besides financial concerns, they are often beset with loneliness and depression.&nbsp; If you visit their flats, it is often quite bleak.&nbsp; Once, I had a woman, a single, in her 50s, who grasped my hands and wailed, \"I am so lonely.&nbsp; Nobody cares whether I live or die.\".&nbsp; I can send a befriender her way, but I doubt it will meet her deep-seated needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what is being done to support elderly singles as most of the activities on the ground are targeted mostly at families and the young.&nbsp; Talking to some of the elderly singles, you sense that there is still a hope in them&nbsp;for love.&nbsp; I notice that the Government tends to focus on marriage rates for those below 40.&nbsp; I hope that we give those above 40s and 50s a sense that there is hope because there are&nbsp;20 or 30 more years to live, that there is a companion that they can turn to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a recent study by the NUS on the quality of life of the elderly in Singapore found that the&nbsp;two domains of life that the elderly are most dissatisfied with&nbsp;are leisure and recreation facilities as well as the arts and culture scene in Singapore.&nbsp; The dissatisfaction is higher among the older age groups and the minority races as most of the activities are targeted at the majority of the population which are Chinese-speaking or English-speaking.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I note that many of the senior citizen groups on the ground at the grassroots level are Chinese-speaking and they tend <p align=left>Column: 2390<p> to centre around karaoke or events where they speak Hokkien or the local dialects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what the MCYS is doing to cater to the older age groups, in particular, those from the minority races, to help them integrate into society better, especially in their winter years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NUS' study also found&nbsp;the lower level of satisfaction being registered by the elderly aged 55 to 67, probably due to adjustment problems after retirement.&nbsp; Increasingly, many of those retiring are highly educated, English-speaking and still active.&nbsp; They cannot fit into the present senior citizens groups which largely cater to the masses and the lower-educated.&nbsp; Not all have the financial resources to go globe-trotting or to play golf.&nbsp; But they do have their own interest and can still contribute their talents to society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, recently, I was in US on my way up to the Grand Canyon.&nbsp; I stopped by a small town, sat in the public square and I found a group of senior citizens ambling by, sitting down with their guitars and violins and striking up a good tune - folk music, country music and basically having&nbsp; a good time.&nbsp; They add colour to the city and the town.&nbsp; I think we should create an environment like that in Singapore where growing old is something exciting - they can still bloom, they can still show their talents and not a time where they just&nbsp;fade into oblivion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would urge the Minister to consider setting up a national grassroots club for the English-speaking&nbsp;older Singaporeans especially those who are still healthy, active and higher-educated to cater to their various interests and to develop their skills and talents even after retirement.&nbsp; I would also urge the MCYS to assist the elderly in their adjustments after retirement by providing appropriate social networks as well as pre-retirement education.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wee Siew Kim--><p align=left>Column: 2391<p> \r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We are surrounded by senior citizens' corners and groups.&nbsp; Yet, more could be done.&nbsp; This group of people built Singapore. &nbsp;All strived to get us to where we are today.&nbsp; Many were born here, worked here and will die here.&nbsp; They are the true sons of the nation.&nbsp; Many came here young, our original foreign imports, stayed on and contributed.&nbsp; There will be more and more elderly people in Singapore.&nbsp; Many are still active and healthy and they want to continue to contribute to their community and the economy and to lead productive and meaningful lives. &nbsp;They want to be self-reliant.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister for his plans to cater for the needs of an increasing number of elderly.&nbsp; What is the Government going to do to ensure quality care in the community?&nbsp; Quality care runs the gamut of accessible and affordable healthcare to those that need a home to care for them, a home that not only provides a roof and meals, but also will see to their medical care and other psychological, social and emotional needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Will Government do more to encourage VWOs to run such homes, one piece of the many-helping-hands mosaic?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are well-informed of wellness and healthy lifestyles.&nbsp; We watch our diet, we exercise and we load up on health supplements.&nbsp; We will live a longer and healthier life.&nbsp; But what will these older chaps with time on their hands do?&nbsp; Can I ask what has the Government done to help the elderly keep active?&nbsp; Amongst the needs and requests that I come across from older residents, I find that the one that&nbsp;is most hard put to address adequately is the request for jobs.&nbsp; Much as we want to enable more Singaporeans to continue working into their 60s and stay active, many today are unable to find employment.&nbsp; These older people who need jobs are generally beyond the age<p align=left>Column: 2392<p>  that most employers would consider seriously, and are generally less educated and less energetic.&nbsp; Once displaced, many are unable to get back into the workforce easily.&nbsp; A focused approach to tackling this problem is key to eventually dwindling down the numbers.&nbsp; An elderly earning his or her own keeps will see his or her own self-esteem rise.&nbsp; For those who are prepared to help themselves and are physically able to do so, we must find ways and means to help them.&nbsp; We could co-opt employer groups for help with these initiatives.&nbsp; MCYS and VWOs could also work together to identify jobs such as cleaning jobs, managing thrift shops and gardening for such elderly people.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Davinder Singh (Bishan-Toa Payoh)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

That proposal, Members may remember, was inspired by an amendment that was made to the Penal Code where this House legislated that for certain crimes against domestic maids, the normal sentencing would be increased automatically by 1.5 times.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister for Home Affairs who addressed that proposal at that time felt it was not necessary to do that for the elderly. He gave two main reasons. The first was that the elderly is not the only vulnerable group. There are children and the handicapped and that if we did that for the elderly, then we should also do that for the other groups. And where do we stop?&nbsp; The other reason advanced was that there is, in any event, effective protection because the prosecution has a discretion when it prosecutes to ask the court to impose&nbsp;a deterrent sentence because of aggravating circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is difficult to argue with the logic of that argument if this issue is only one of law enforcement.&nbsp; But it is not.&nbsp; The question of deterrent penalties for crimes<p align=left>Column: 2393<p>  against elderly raises a wider question of our whole philosophy to the issue of how we treat our elderly.&nbsp; What concrete steps are we prepared to take to repay our debt of gratitude to that generation?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have spent a great deal of time exhorting Singaporeans to practise the virtue of filial piety.&nbsp; I think the message is getting through.&nbsp; Many things are being done on the ground to make sure that the elderly are looked after. &nbsp;But there is&nbsp;something that they cannot do, which is, they cannot make laws.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can.&nbsp; The question is: what compelling reasons are there for us not to have an automatic increased penalty where certain types of crimes are committed against the elderly?&nbsp;&nbsp;We read in the papers regularly about robberies, snatch thefts or scams against the elderly.&nbsp; They are completely vulnerable and continue to be exposed to this kind of crimes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laws not only regulate behaviour between individuals, they actually reflect a society's social and cultural norms.&nbsp; If I take up the point that the Minister for Home Affairs made last year, which is that there are other vulnerable groups as well, so if we protect the elderly, we should do the same for the other groups.&nbsp; But the guiding principle is not only vulnerability.&nbsp; It is moral obligation.&nbsp; Do we or do we not have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to look after those who have looked after us?&nbsp; And if the question is yes, then why are we not imposing deterrent sentences mandatorily in cases of certain crimes against the elderly? &nbsp;These crimes continue.&nbsp; We all accept that they are beyond the bail. &nbsp;Really, they are too important an issue to be left to the discretion of one prosecutor. &nbsp;If we can do this for domestic workers, surely it merits protection and same treatment for our parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would invite the Minister to review this issue.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Mr Chairman, Sir,&nbsp;Census 2000 revealed that there were some 240,000 Singaporeans who are now aged 65 and above.&nbsp; Our aged population is expected to grow rapidly over the next 25 years from the present 7% to about 19% of the population by 2030.&nbsp; The rapid increase in the proportion of older persons is mainly due to three factors.&nbsp; First, the post-war baby boomers who are now 35-54.&nbsp; In a few years' time they would have moved to the age range of 65 and above.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, with better advance in medical sciences, people are more healthy, food&nbsp;is more nutritious and the life-span is longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the low fertility rate, which has dropped from 1.87 in 1990 to 1.37 in 2002.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the trend of our young having&nbsp;fewer&nbsp;children and some even staying single, families would thus face increased pressure to care for both the young and the old.&nbsp; The demand for support to the elderly would thus become even more critical in future.&nbsp; Older Singaporeans have made significant contributions in the early years of our nation building. &nbsp;They deserve our respect and concern.&nbsp; As our Prime Minister said in his Budget&nbsp;speech,&nbsp;\"Nobody should be left behind as Singapore forges ahead\",&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what is the budget that the Government has set aside for eldercare services and would this budget be increased in future in tandem with the increase in elderly population.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, in an ideal world, the elderly and the homemakers should not have to worry about finances when they reach old age, or if the sole breadwinner in the family should suddenly<p align=left>Column: 2395<p>  leave the family or, worse still, meet an untimely death.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal world and, as MPs, we often come across cases in our meet-the-people sessions where the elderly are abandoned by their children&nbsp;or as we have heard earlier from our colleague, Mr Wee Siew Kim, of how an elderly is now forced to look for financial support, having looked after his parents all his life.&nbsp; Or, for that matter, housewives with children in tow, who had to grapple with bills and payments, when their spouses are no longer around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the elderly parents with children, there is at least the Maintenance of Parents Tribunal to turn to for their financial needs.&nbsp; However, while this solution is available, it is not always an option, as some elderly may not have children to lean on or have the energy to pursue their children in court every time they have defaulted on a payment.&nbsp; For them, happy retirement is not a choice.&nbsp; They would need to look at some kind of sustainable employment to secure at least some form of regular income to support their needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The situation for homemakers is not any easier.&nbsp; For many homemakers, they would have spent the better part of their lives being away from the workforce to help look after the family and raise their children.&nbsp; Very often, they are not in a position to hire domestic help because it does not make economic sense.&nbsp; Unfortunately, as they have not worked, they would not have accumulated sufficient CPF monies into their accounts.&nbsp; Quite obviously, Sir, this leaves them rather vulnerable, as they would be severely affected if their spouses were to leave them, or are no longer able to provide for them, through death or disability.&nbsp; Very often, their world would come crashing down should such an unfortunate turn of events were to occur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n <p align=left>Column: 2396<p> \r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could the Government help to increase the level of financial independence for these vulnerable Singaporeans?&nbsp; I truly believe we can.&nbsp; The Ministry could, apart from working closely with WDA and the CDCs to look for employment opportunities, take a leaf from the private-partnership model by actively working with the private sector to create employment opportunities for these people.&nbsp; I had, in fact, touched on this possibility in my earlier speech on the financial policy of the Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very briefly, the Ministry could encourage the CDCs to work with the private sector to set up small ventures that could help these people.&nbsp; My colleague, Ms Irene Ng, for instance, clearly demonstrated this is possible when she convinced Killiney Kopitiam to start an outlet at her Community Club to provide employment opportunities for those who have just left the prison.&nbsp; Another example of such approach could well be to provide a framework for the setting up of cottage industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these are just some examples.&nbsp; My point is to ask the Minister whether the Government is concerned about the lack of financial independence of the elderly and the homemakers and whether they would seriously consider measures, including the ones I mentioned earlier, to help these Singaporeans who may be in need.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

There were about 100 cases of battered and neglected elders each year in the past five years and these cases were just the tip of the iceberg, as most cases were not reported.&nbsp; Like my parliamentary colleague, Mr Davinder Singh, could I beseech MCYS to&nbsp;look at better laws to protect the<p align=left>Column: 2397<p>  abused elders as many of them are helpless for various reasons?&nbsp; Perhaps MCYS should look at having our laws changed to empower social workers, doctors, family members and the homecare givers to protect senior citizens from abuse, in much the same way as they can intervene on behalf of abused children.&nbsp; Presently, the authorities can intervene only if the abused elderly person or a third person has applied for a Protection Order under the Women's Charter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could MCYS also look into our laws to better protect our elderly from financial abuses?&nbsp; For example, banks should be allowed to intervene when a staff suspects that an older person is being defrauded of financial asset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MCYS should enhance public education on the various kinds of abuses such as infliction of physical pain and injury, debilitating mental anguish, unreasonable confinement, wilful deprivation by caretaker of services necessary to maintain mental and physical health and financial abuses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As elderly abuse is seldom reported, would MCYS raise the awareness, targeting especially the relatives and friends of the victims to let them know that help can, and should, be sought for victims? &nbsp;In order to reduce the incidence of elderly abuse, would MCYS look into the availability of support services to give respite to caregivers and prevent the burnt-out syndrome of these care providers, especially those looking after the elderly, with demanding needs such as dementia or terminal illness?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Dr Lily Neo and Nominated MP Ong Soh Khim have said that they wanted caregivers of aged parents to be given income tax relief.&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Ong had also suggested that paid leave be given to those who need time off to care for their elderly dependants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would&nbsp;support these calls but, to broaden them, to include all persons who care for dependants including disabled family members or spouses, or parents of young children, or older children with learning disorders and disabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Prime Minister wants a more inclusive society&nbsp;and I also believe that he means more than just building the obligatory ramp up shopping centres.&nbsp; I believe what he means is to think of the weak and the vulnerable, not just as burdens to be borne, but as members who are part of the larger family.&nbsp; More importantly, our inclusive society must also uphold those who make necessary sacrifices to provide care and comfort to those who need them.&nbsp; We should then make the effort to highlight stories of caregivers and their experiences to inspire and inform other caregivers and the wider public.&nbsp; MCYS could do more to fund more of such public education programmes, and run training sessions for caregivers to help them with their task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can think of an example.&nbsp; A simple thing such as taking a bath may be a special hazard for those who are infirm.&nbsp; Sir, there is a recent book called \"Wish I Knew - Caring for the Sick at Home\" which is a very readable account of the advice that nurses give to caregivers and how caregivers themselves cope with situations.&nbsp; We should have more of such literature, as we have more elderly in our community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we also need more respite care centres that can take care of the elderly and disabled for short periods in order to provide the caregivers a chance to take a<p align=left>Column: 2399<p>  break.&nbsp; At present, we do have a few of these centres, including the AWWA Readycare Centre which is a day rehabilitation centre for the elderly, St Luke's Community Hospital and the Sree Narayana Mission Home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also other community service centres which provide daycare for the elderly, services such as meal delivery, laundry and home nursing.&nbsp; The charges for such respite care can range from $30 to $300.&nbsp; This is not subsidised by the Government and cannot be paid for using Medisave or MediShield.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are some of the voluntary welfare organisations that run hospitals and homes who may waive a portion of their fees for poorer families.&nbsp; I feel that there is a case for the Government to consider increasing the subsidy for such respite care in certain&nbsp;institutions.&nbsp; This is a small start in caring for caregivers but I believe that it would make a great difference to their quality of life.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, caregivers face increasing stress.&nbsp; Demands of a changing job environment, escalating cost of living and medical costs, the need to stay integrated with the community and caring for their charges could be overwhelming.&nbsp; In particular, the sandwich generation that cares for the school-going age and the ageing parents, singles who are caring for ageing parents or disabled siblings, are a growing phenomenon in our ageing demography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In an all inclusive society approach, how could we empower, enable and enhance caregivers' ability to discharge their responsibilities?&nbsp; Is a one-stop centre for caregivers a possible idea?&nbsp; Is there a more holistic way to help the caregivers?&nbsp; I hope the answer to all these and suggestions from my colleagues is a yes.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I read recently that Victor's Cafe hired three intellectually disabled people as waiters.&nbsp; This is unusual for the industry.&nbsp; The cafe owners said that although the intellectually disabled people may look a bit different, \"that doesn't mean they can't do the job as well or even better\".&nbsp; This effort is laudable and should be showcased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President's Address at the Opening of Parliament on 12th January 2005 affirmed the \"many-helping-hands\" approach adopted by the Government to build up a broad range of support services for the disabled.&nbsp; This tripartite relationship between the Government, the citizenry and the voluntary sector has achieved commendable results in the outreach to people with disabilities.&nbsp; In particular, the collaborative efforts of the various agencies have brought about greater focus on employment opportunities for the disabled.&nbsp; Even then, there is anecdotal evidence that some of the disabled are understandably apprehensive about disclosing their medical conditions to prospective employers for fear of discrimination, even if such medical conditions would not hamper their job performance.&nbsp; On the Government's side, the Ministry of Education has continually played a vital part in improving the quality of education for the disabled.&nbsp; But these efforts by the Government alone are not enough to<p align=left>Column: 2401<p> adequately address the issue of facilitating the employment of the disabled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government's response to the Remaking Singapore Committee's proposal to facilitate employment for the disabled stated that, \"A more long-term arrangement and holistic approach is required for the societal integration needs of the disabled\" and that \"MCDS, NCSS and WDA are undertaking a more in-depth study on the skills, abilities and limitations of the different groups of persons with disabilities who are employable so as to market them more effectively to potential employers.&nbsp; Efforts are being made to engage companies to redesign jobs and to pilot employment test beds for employees with disabilities.\".&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to know whether this study referred to has been completed and what efforts have been taken to engage the companies on redesigning jobs and piloting the employment test beds as well as the outcome of these efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the United Kingdom, recent legislative changes in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 have rendered it unlawful from October 2004 for an employer to discriminate against a disabled person when choosing someone for a job or considering people for promotion, dismissal or redundancy.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister if the Government intends to consider legislative changes as part of its strategy to facilitate the employment of the disabled and the chronically ill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such changes through governmental intervention may result in the disabled and the chronically ill getting one foot, perhaps both feet, in the door of a job opportunity.&nbsp; But I have no doubt that that is not the be-all and end-all of the matter.&nbsp; For the spectre of misunderstandings and negative attitudes from co-workers and employers is another battle for them.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2402<p> What is also needed is a focus by employers not on their differences, physically or intellectually, but on their common abilities and skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe that we need to engage the disabled and the chronically ill in society by optimising their employment opportunities in a greater way than we have before.&nbsp; We need to minimise the serious risk that these Singaporeans would not end up as the most vulnerable workers, not only during economic restructuring, but also in good times.&nbsp; These special Singaporeans go through the education system, learn specific skills and arm themselves with professional qualifications.&nbsp; And yet, at the time when they should be setting sail on the sea of their career adventure, society instead sets them sailing on the sea of nowhere, treating them without the dignity that comes with their difference.&nbsp; There needs to be a sea change in the mindsets of employers to welcome this often rejected labour force.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The major complaint I heard from many of my disabled friends in Singapore is the problem of transportation.&nbsp; Given the dominance of high-rise buildings and the fast pace of life in our city, we have to overcome many obstacles to accommodate the physical and social needs of our disabled friends.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are certainly going the right direction with more ramps, lifts in public places,&nbsp;but there are still many areas of disjoints which hinder their movements.&nbsp; As we all know, just one area of disconnect could render a very simple journey \"mission impossible\" for the disabled.&nbsp; And there are&nbsp;implications from such physical&nbsp;inconveniences such as the inability to take on jobs leading to lifelong<p align=left>Column: 2403<p> dependence on family members or financial assistance, depressed self-esteem and so on.&nbsp; Hence, I would like to recommend that MCYS work very closely with MND in the planning and&nbsp;revision of public facilities and infrastructure to ensure that all these little kinks are ironed out.&nbsp; It is also very important that the disabled be given the opportunity to be self-reliant.&nbsp; Many of them, in fact, are eager to contribute and be active and involve members of our community.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Perhaps the question which we should ask ourselves before we speak of building strong families is whether or not we are really having enough families in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, can the Minister give this House an update on the effectiveness of the<p align=left>Column: 2404<p> baby bonus scheme so far?&nbsp; I know that this is a dicey matter to ask for results in matters of the bedroom.&nbsp; But since we are told that this is a serious problem, we ought to know how far we have progressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I want to address two issues in building strong families.&nbsp; The first is the issue of abortion.&nbsp; I wonder if we can look at this issue more seriously and provide some help to women who want to bring their babies to term but who, for whatever reason, decide to give them up for abortion.&nbsp; Can the Minister give us a breakdown of the profile of such women who seek abortions?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not have the latest figures.&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1992 to 1996, the total number of abortions fell from 17,000 to 14,000.&nbsp; But the proportion of teenage mothers aborting their babies has increased slightly.&nbsp; In 1996, about four abortions a week were of teenage mothers.&nbsp; What happened in these instances?&nbsp; Can they be persuaded to keep their babies?&nbsp; How can we help these young people?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second issue is parenting.&nbsp; There are many parents today who need help in coping with children, whether they are toddlers or teenagers.&nbsp; I would like to suggest cash subsidies for parents who attend&nbsp;parenting courses as well as incentives for companies to provide time-off for parents to attend such courses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also need to create some awareness amongst parents to make this a priority.&nbsp; We take gymnastic classes, exercise classes, even language classes.&nbsp; But how many of us, as parents, take time to attend parenting classes?&nbsp; Do we assume that we just naturally become good parents?&nbsp; Or, as I suspect, to many of us, we just&nbsp;leave it to our wives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this is a long haul and a delicate topic.&nbsp; But I feel we ought to give parents more support, since they are the cornerstone of building strong families.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This is in sync with our many-helping-hands approach and also the preferred approach of many of our disadvantaged citizens who are quite conspicuously missing from the public space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, social enterprises have become the preferred type of VWOs and NGOs in the developed countries like Japan,&nbsp;US and UK, which even has a CIC-type of company legislative framework that suits social enterprises.&nbsp; They also organise themselves into various help organisations that provide cross platforms for deeper discussions on administrative, technical and funding issues.&nbsp; These platforms are also excellent grounds for experience exchanges and the alliance to achieve a multiplier effect.&nbsp; Universities like Harvard and Columbia Universities also have extensive studies and developed programmes to jump start the social enterprises.&nbsp; In retrospect, our effort appears quite half-hearted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if we are serious about boosting this sector and cultivating a self-reliant society, let us catch the wave and become a regional player in social enterprises, instead of going through our own learning curve.&nbsp; A way to jump start could be in inviting a few of these establishing international social enterprises to base their regional HQ in Singapore as well as collaborating with successful social enterprises overseas.&nbsp; Perhaps exchange programmes to train our own social entrepreneurs could also be instituted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the power of our people and such social entrepreneurs play a pivotal role in the tsunami relief efforts.&nbsp; It demonstrates that in&nbsp;the event of a disaster, joint effort<p align=left>Column: 2406<p> with the people sector will avert a crisis or at least effectively manage it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Minister intend to encourage such an organisation and, if so, how?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</B> Sir, I would like to share&nbsp;the two key priorities of my Ministry over the next&nbsp;two years.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is to build a caring and inclusive society, where no one&nbsp;will be&nbsp;left behind.&nbsp; As a country, Singapore has made a&nbsp;strategic decision to ride on globalisation, to&nbsp;have an open economy, to run a competitive system, in order for us to tap and harvest every opportunity&nbsp;for economic growth. And we have to do this because we are small and this is the only way to survive.&nbsp; However, the corollary of this strategic decision is that there will be&nbsp;increased competition for our people&nbsp;- competition which we cannot insulate our people from.&nbsp; And it is important that Members of this House appreciate this strategic fact.&nbsp;This sense of competing at the highest level is what makes Singapore exciting, but it is also what causes deep-seated anxiety and even fear in the hearts of some people who are worried that they may not be able to keep up with this fast paced competitive society, and are afraid that they will be left behind in this race. &nbsp;Our job is to make sure&nbsp;that every Singaporean and every family in Singapore has an opportunity to build a better life,&nbsp;to harvest the fruits of our labour as a nation, and an assurance that there will be a helping hand and no one will be left behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with the sentiment that we cannot outsource the poor,&nbsp;because we are not a company.&nbsp; We are a nation and therefore we are in this together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second key priority is that we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;nurture the relationships that give us happiness, fulfilment and significance<p align=left>Column: 2407<p> to our lives.&nbsp; At a personal level, my life is worthwhile because of my relationships with my wife, children,&nbsp;friends, colleagues and my fellow citizens. &nbsp;Family, friends and colleagues give us a reason to live, work and play. &nbsp;Shared experiences and memories are what bind us together as a society and what root us&nbsp;to&nbsp;this precious place called home. &nbsp;We derive a sense of ownership, not just from owning a flat but because of the opportunity to contribute, to build and leave something behind in this place called Singapore to make the difference. &nbsp;And that is why my Ministry focuses on the family, voluntary welfare organisations, racial and religious harmony, volunteerism, philanthropy, sports and opportunities for youth.&nbsp; Ultimately, it is about relationships, and enhancing the relationships that&nbsp;enrich our lives.&nbsp; So just bear these two key priorities in mind&nbsp;-&nbsp;that no one is left behind and it is about enriching our relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now focus on the first priority.&nbsp; Many Members have raised eloquent and deeply-felt pleas on behalf of the poor and needy and have asked how they are faring. &nbsp;As our economy grows and as we go through this painful restructuring, I know that there&nbsp;are&nbsp;Singaporeans out there who are feeling anxious and who are feeling the burden of this restructuring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The past&nbsp;seven years from 1998 to 2004 have been difficult for the&nbsp;lowest&nbsp;&nbsp;20th percentile of our population.&nbsp; Although the cost of living has not risen by much, wages for the&nbsp;less skilled jobs have declined marginally.&nbsp; Although at the statistical level, we may say that these are marginal changes, to real people on the ground facing these situations, these fears and anxieties are amplified.&nbsp; And this is not something that we can wish away - globalisation, recessions, restructuring, terrorism and&nbsp;biological plagues are facts of life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2408<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some workers with&nbsp;only basic education obviously&nbsp;face increased difficulties finding jobs despite their best efforts.&nbsp; There&nbsp;are older Singaporeans who are frail, sometimes without family support, and&nbsp;sometimes with&nbsp;little savings.&nbsp; Similarly, while we have some disabled Singaporeans who are gainfully employed, we all know that it is that much more difficult for disabled persons to find&nbsp;jobs.&nbsp; If a person with no disability already has difficulty finding jobs, it can only be harder for a disabled person.&nbsp; I want to assure Members&nbsp;-&nbsp;and Mr Sin has asked me for an assurance&nbsp;- that we will not neglect such Singaporeans.&nbsp; They deserve their fair share of opportunities and they deserve our assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have distributed a handout enumerating all the current social assistance schemes that exist as of today.&nbsp; One Member just now toted up and said he had counted nine.&nbsp; I do not know whether to be pleased or to be disappointed to inform&nbsp;him that there are 51 -&nbsp;probably more as I still have not toted up&nbsp;all&nbsp;-&nbsp;and if&nbsp;Members look at the details in that handout, there are actually quite a lot of assistance available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We actually have a very robust social safety net in Singapore and one which delivers considerable benefits to our people who need it most.&nbsp; But what is different, unique perhaps, about our social safety net compared with the welfare state that many Members, especially the Opposition Members, keep harping about is that in Singapore, this assistance is focused.&nbsp; It is focused specifically at the lowest 20% and it also takes into account the fact that the lowest 20th percentile are not a homogenous group.&nbsp; They are actually&nbsp;heterogeneous with different circumstances and with different needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, if&nbsp;Members look at what the Government provides for our people, the first tier is what I define as universal subsidies.&nbsp; By this, I mean healthcare, education and housing.&nbsp; The last time<p align=left>Column: 2409<p> we tried to compute a value for this, this worked out to at least $12,000 a year.&nbsp; These are the subsidies for healthcare, housing and education.&nbsp; Over and above this, we have a comprehensive range of assistance schemes which are&nbsp;tailor-made for the different groups in the bottom 20%.&nbsp;The approach we&nbsp;use for each group must be different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give&nbsp;Members a few examples.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>For those who have lost their jobs, we need to provide interim assistance.&nbsp; We obviously need to help them get re-employed and get back on their feet.&nbsp; For another group, whose incomes are low and chronically low, what they need is some ongoing financial assistance to supplement those incomes.&nbsp; In particular -&nbsp;and I am very struck by Mr Zainudin's speech -&nbsp;we need to make sure that their children get a good education because this is the only sure way to ensure that they escape the poverty trap, and that we will get many, many more Zainudins in Parliament and in the upper reaches of our society in the future.&nbsp; And then, at the lowest end, we have those who are frail elderly, disabled, who really cannot get a job and support themselves even if they wanted to.&nbsp; For them, and only them, we provide long-term assistance&nbsp;through our public assistance scheme.&nbsp; But fortunately for us,&nbsp;at this point in time, this is a small group and as of now there are only about 2,700 households receiving public assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me cite a few more examples -&nbsp;real examples -&nbsp;so that you get an idea of how our system works in practice.&nbsp; A family of four approached the South West CDC for assistance a few months ago.&nbsp; Both parents were not working, the family had problems making ends meet.&nbsp; The family received about $1,000 in assistance from the CDC.&nbsp; The father received job search and assistance through the Work Assistance Programme.&nbsp; The two<p align=left>Column: 2410<p> children received school fee subsidies and free textbooks.&nbsp; The good news in the case of this family is that the father will be returning to work at the end of this month.&nbsp; And I understand that he and his wife will receive a combined income of about $1,400.&nbsp; The family see themselves as now having taken that first step towards self-reliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take another example&nbsp;-&nbsp;a divorcee living with her mother and two children.&nbsp; To make things worse, she has not been able to work because of a traffic accident.&nbsp; Since the middle of last year, this family has received financial support through the Interim Financial Assistance Scheme and the Rent and Utilities Scheme.&nbsp; Her older child receives free uniforms and free textbooks.&nbsp; The younger child is able to go to a childcare centre because of subsidies under the Centre-Based Financial Assistance Scheme for Childcare.&nbsp; MUIS has also stepped in with some additional financial assistance.&nbsp; All in, since September last year, she has received about $3,800 in assistance.&nbsp; And over and above this, she also benefits from HDB's Public Rental Scheme where she pays less than $50 a month for her 2-room rental flat.&nbsp; And her family's medical expenses are covered by Medifund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important to understand the significance of Medifund. &nbsp;Medifund, in effect, means that every single person in Singapore has access to healthcare and, in cases of families like this, they often do not even pay a single cent for their healthcare.&nbsp; As a person who has worked at the front-end in hospitals, I can assure you there is no problem as far as access to healthcare for the poor in Singapore.&nbsp; This is something that&nbsp;is in stark contrast to the situation in developed countries, like the United States or even parts of Europe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you another example -&nbsp;an elderly person living alone,&nbsp;a 69-year old childless widow, who has&nbsp;exhausted her savings with&nbsp;no family to turn to.&nbsp; We put<p align=left>Column: 2411<p> her under the Public Assistance Scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not us alone who is looking after her.&nbsp; The Sunlove Neighbourhood Link provides her with free&nbsp;meals.&nbsp; She gets food rations from SATS every alternate month, and she gets <I>ang pows</I> from foundations, like the Hong Leong Foundation and Shaw Foundation.&nbsp; In total, I have been told that she has been receiving about $4,100 a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of this again, she receives assistance through Medifund and also takes advantage of highly subsidised housing under the Public Rental Scheme.&nbsp; Yes, she does not have a lot, but she is taken care of.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help low-income families avoid the poverty trap, we also have this scheme called&nbsp;Home Ownership Plus Education (HOPE).&nbsp; This is a special scheme, preventive or perhaps an incentive scheme, to send&nbsp;the message to these households that if they have smaller families they&nbsp;will be able to focus their resources on these precious few children.&nbsp;&nbsp;They can create a better future for themselves and their children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure Members of this House are aware that the sum total that is provided through HOPE is $100,000.&nbsp; This is a significant sum of money for people in that predicament.&nbsp; As of end January this year, we have 450 families who were signed on to this scheme.&nbsp; And I can assure Members of this House that I hope many more will benefit and&nbsp;take advantage of this scheme which we offer to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our social safety net ensures that our poor have a roof over their heads, food on the table, access to medical care,&nbsp;a chance to seek gainful employment, ie, to be trained for the next job, and education opportunities for their children.&nbsp; That is the guarantee, the hope, the option of social mobility to escape the<p align=left>Column: 2412<p> poverty trap.&nbsp; And this is something which, I think, Singaporeans&nbsp;and, indeed, many of us in this House have not truly appreciated the extent and even, dare I say, the generosity of our social assistance package.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I&nbsp;would put it to you that&nbsp;you will find very few countries, if at all, either capitalist or communist, which have done as well to look after the poor and give the poor hope,&nbsp;a chance to&nbsp;live a meaningful and&nbsp;self-respecting life, with dignity for themselves and hope for their children.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our paradigm is assistance; it is not welfare.&nbsp; The experience of other countries with excessive welfare benefits has taught us that we need to calibrate how we deliver our help.&nbsp; All of us want to help, but we need to translate those good intentions into practical and sensible schemes on the ground.&nbsp; We must not douse the desire to get back&nbsp;on the feet and to be self-reliant.&nbsp; If we do that, we would&nbsp;have fundamentally changed our society,&nbsp;destroyed our ability to compete and survive, going forward.&nbsp; And this is even more critical now than ever before in this globalised world with competition that we cannot shield anybody from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So to put it simply, our approach is assistance, not welfare;&nbsp;mutual obligation, not entitlement.&nbsp; No Singaporean should feel, when he reads the <I>Straits Times</I> tomorrow and sees these 51 schemes, that he has&nbsp;a right to demand every single cent from every single scheme in that handout.&nbsp; Everyone of us must still feel the need to strive and work harder for a&nbsp;better life for ourselves and for our family.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some&nbsp;Members may feel that this is not being very compassionate.&nbsp; But I ask you to consider the consequences of choosing an easy populist route and just say, \"These are the 51 schemes, let us give&nbsp;them all away.\".&nbsp; If we did that -&nbsp;you and I know that there will be many who will not bother to work, much less upgrade their skills -&nbsp;the Government would<p align=left>Column: 2413<p> have to raise taxes, both income tax and GST.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, frankly, that is not the worst of it.&nbsp; The most dangerous fact of going down the populist route is the fact that you will have a welfare system which is not sustainable.&nbsp; And this is the crux of the problem which America and Europe&nbsp;are now struggling to resolve.&nbsp; And you and I know they have not solved it yet and the problem&nbsp;is only going to get worse.&nbsp; So we need to understand that, yes, we must love our neighbours,&nbsp;but we need to do it in a sensible, practical and sustainable way.&nbsp; And what we have so far has worked and can work for the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I come back to the three fundamental principles behind our social safety net.&nbsp; First, to foster self-reliance.&nbsp; Our social safety net must be a trampoline.&nbsp; It must have springs so that someone who falls back on it can spring back up again.&nbsp; It is not meant to be a comfortable, luxury mattress for you to rest for a long term.&nbsp; Second, the family.&nbsp; The family must still remain our primary line of support, including both financial and emotional support.&nbsp; The Government cannot be a surrogate husband, a surrogate father, a surrogate mother or a surrogate brother or sister.&nbsp; Your family must still be there for you.&nbsp; Third, our social safety net is not something that is constructed and held up by the Government alone.&nbsp; We need \"Many Helping Hands\".&nbsp; And that is where ordinary citizens, voluntary welfare organisations and grassroots organisations have an absolutely&nbsp;crucial role to play.&nbsp;&nbsp;My friends, the issue is not money.&nbsp; It is not that the Government &nbsp;is being stingy and trying to save money and therefore asking the VWOs to come forward to help.&nbsp; The truth of the matter is&nbsp;compassion,&nbsp;dedication,&nbsp;sensitivity and passion.&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy of volunteers is something which cannot be matched by paid employees of the Government dishing out dole.&nbsp; There is a world of<p align=left>Column: 2414<p> difference between&nbsp;a volunteer and a paid person, simply following the book and handing you a cheque every month.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is not to say that our current system is perfect.&nbsp; I will be the first to admit it is not perfect, and that is why we need to continually look at it critically and try to improve it.&nbsp; So let me now&nbsp;touch&nbsp;briefly on ComCare because my Minister of State will go through the details.&nbsp; Let me explain the significance of ComCare.&nbsp; What does it mean to all of us?&nbsp; First, it means we are setting up a sustainable source of funds for the poor in Singapore.&nbsp; All of you know that the Ministries are on block budgets.&nbsp; All of you also applauded when you&nbsp;were told that the Ministries' block budgets&nbsp;were going to be cut.&nbsp; All of you also then knew that, in tough times, all Ministries, including my Ministry, would have&nbsp;their budget cut.&nbsp; Consequently, we felt that by setting up an Endowment Fund which will then generate interest, we will be able to have a source of funds which will be available in both good and bad times for our people.&nbsp; That is why although, as of now, it is going to go up to $500 million, in the long term we need a billion dollars&nbsp;or perhaps even more, so that it will truly be sustainable and, in a sense, budget neutral.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point which I want to emphasise about ComCare is that it signifies our commitment to do more.&nbsp; We have an ageing population.&nbsp; We have an economy which is going to be under increased pressure from competition from other parts of the world.&nbsp; So, yes, I think more people will need assistance in the future.&nbsp; There will be new money for new programmes.&nbsp; ComCare for this year will provide $55 million for a start.&nbsp; This is 40% more than we spent on the current schemes last year.&nbsp; This is proof that we are putting our money where our mouth is, that we are going to spend more money</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>where it is needed, not just spend money and dish it out, but do it in a disciplined and sensible way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2415<p>\r\n<p>6.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the establishment of ComCare gives us an opportunity to streamline our schemes.&nbsp; After I looked at that handout, I found 51 schemes.&nbsp; It is no wonder none of us, including the people out there, knew what was available for social assistance.&nbsp; I think this is a wonderful opportunity for us to rationalise and simplify and make it easier for all of us to implement the schemes.&nbsp; It does not necessarily mean that it is going to be easier for people to get more money.&nbsp; I do not think that should be the interpretation.&nbsp; But it means we should have a more rational and simplified interface to assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, many of you have emphasised the need for flexibility, and I agree with you absolutely.&nbsp; Every individual and every family in trouble is different.&nbsp; Yes, for some schemes, we can use strict criteria, eg, whether you are working or not working, how much are you earning, how many people in your family, etc.&nbsp; But beyond the standard criteria-based schemes, there is a need for flexibility at the edges, and ComCare will provide that additional flexibility at the edge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fifth&nbsp;point which is significant about ComCare is that we are now signalling a decentralised approach to the delivery of public assistance.&nbsp; Why CDCs and why VWOs?&nbsp; Because they are on the ground and they consist of people who are living next to you, living amongst you, living in the community, people who&nbsp;know whether you are truly in need or whether you are using the money for beer and cigarettes, people who can see you, live with you and feel your pain and share your burdens.&nbsp; So, I believe the grassroots organisations will bring their local knowledge, their hearts and their human touch into play.&nbsp; And it will not be an impersonal Ministry up in Thomson Road that is giving you assistance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2416<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Minister of State will elaborate on the details later, but there will basically be three categories of funds under ComCare.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one we have called it ComCare Self-Reliance.&nbsp; That is&nbsp;focused on&nbsp;needy families who need interim assistance to tide over periods of unemployment.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second one we have called it&nbsp;ComCare Grow, and that is basically focused on&nbsp;children to ensure that children from needy families - and when I say needy families, let me emphasise that it does not matter whether that is a standard nuclear family, broken family, divorced family or children with single parents or children of elderly parents -all children who need help will receive help.&nbsp; And, in particular, we will look after their educational needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;The third category we have called&nbsp;it ComCare Enable, which&nbsp;focuses on&nbsp;those who need long-term assistance, eg, the&nbsp;frail elderly living alone and people with disabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One specific feature which we are going to construct is a central database because, with so many schemes and so many people doing so many things, there is a real danger of either some people taking advantage and applying for more than what they need.&nbsp; Similarly, there is also a danger of some people falling through the cracks and not receiving the&nbsp;help that they need.&nbsp; So I believe my Ministry's role will be to act as a central interface for this information to be shared by all our many partners on the ground who are delivering assistance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also agree with the sentiment that many of you have expressed - that we do need more social workers and our social workers need to be more equipped and to have the necessary support to do their work.&nbsp; I want to acknowledge here that social workers in Singapore play an incredibly important role and, in fact, have been one of the most under-appreciated, under-recognised professions in Singapore, and we must take steps to correct that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2417<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now move on to ageing issues.&nbsp; Many&nbsp;Members, such as Mr Davinder Singh, Ms Irene Ng,&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo and Dr Warren Lee, have spoken&nbsp;on these.&nbsp; Let me first say that I agree with all of you that we need an inter-agency approach.&nbsp; Ageing issues cut across many sectors, Ministries and agencies, and that is why we do not have a single Ministry for the elderly.&nbsp; We have instead set up a Committee on Ageing Issues (CAI).&nbsp; This is chaired by the&nbsp;Senior Minister of State for Health, Dr Balaji Sadasivan, and co-chaired by my&nbsp;Parliamentary Secretary, Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman.&nbsp; It comprises both Government and VWO representatives, and this&nbsp;committee has been tasked to focus on five priority areas:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Financial security of the elderly;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Improving the&nbsp;employability of older Singaporeans;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Enabling older Singaporeans&nbsp;to live with their families;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Promoting active ageing; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; Making sure that there is a continuum of care, both&nbsp;healthcare and social care services which our elderly need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are not trivial issues.&nbsp; It is not something which we are going to solve overnight, but I put it to you that we have recognised that these are five big areas which we need to look at and&nbsp;address in a significant way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng asked how much we are spending on eldercare and whether&nbsp;this&nbsp;will increase in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;MCYS' and MOH's budget for eldercare services in this financial year will work out to a total of&nbsp;$98 million.&nbsp; It comprises&nbsp;$12 million from MCYS and $86 million from MOH.&nbsp; This represents an annual growth rate of&nbsp;4.5% compared to the&nbsp;$82 million that was spent in FY 2001.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2418<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of our&nbsp;expenditure on&nbsp;the elderly goes into the Eldercare Masterplan.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;where we fund the VWOs to run a range of eldercare services.&nbsp; It&nbsp;ranges from development programmes for the healthy, all the way to services for the frail.&nbsp; And we are currently reviewing this&nbsp;range of services and we will develop a new Eldercare Masterplan for FY 2006 to FY 2010.&nbsp; We will do this in consultation with our service providers and with the users on the ground.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will explore Dr Lily Neo's suggestions; Dr Warren Lee's suggestions on&nbsp;seeing how GPs can play a&nbsp;role; and we will certainly look at Dr Chong Weng Chiew's and Ms Irene Ng's suggestion for match-making services for those over 40 and even the elderly and the disabled.&nbsp; I think love should not have an expiry date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee Siew Kim and Mr Sin Boon Ann talked about creating job opportunities for older Singaporeans.&nbsp; This is going to be a priority&nbsp;area.&nbsp; We have just finished the COS for MOM where we talked about&nbsp;reviewing the retirement age policy.&nbsp; It is not something trivial and easy to do.&nbsp; And&nbsp;identifying employment opportunities for the elderly, promoting an&nbsp;elder-friendly workplace, enlightened&nbsp;human resource&nbsp;practices, and looking into the&nbsp;establishment of&nbsp;informal industries and perhaps even providing micro-credit, as Miss Penny Low has suggested -&nbsp;we need to explore the entire spectrum.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be piloting a community platform where the elderly or homemakers can make a living selling their own products, whether it be cakes, handicrafts or services.&nbsp; This has been helped recently by MND's decision last year to allow HDB homes to be registered as offices.&nbsp; And in due time, I think all the Ministries are also looking at how we can enable this informal economy to thrive at the edges of what still needs to be a globally competitive economy, which is the core<p align=left>Column: 2419<p> of our Singapore economy, and we&nbsp;will certainly look at providing&nbsp;micro-financing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee Siew Kim spoke on the need to keep our elderly active, and I agree absolutely with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping active can mean working.&nbsp; It can also mean being a volunteer or pursuing a hobby, and I believe it is important in delaying the onset of many of the degenerative diseases which you associate with ageing.&nbsp; I have heard this example of&nbsp;Mr Tan Kok Sing, who at age 80,&nbsp;led three generations of his family in skydiving from a height of 8,000 feet.&nbsp; I have not even dared&nbsp; to do that myself.&nbsp; But I am sure, and I hope, that there are many more&nbsp;elderly like Mr Tan, who serves as&nbsp;an inspiration to&nbsp;all of us, both young and old alike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage active ageing further, my Ministry runs an&nbsp;Active Seniors Programme (ASP).&nbsp; This&nbsp;scheme&nbsp;funds up to $200,000 to community groups who want to start projects that will tap on the skills and experience of older Singaporeans.&nbsp; So far,&nbsp;3,000 elderly volunteers have been mobilised under the scheme.&nbsp; One such project is a mentoring scheme run by a local organisation, and it is called&nbsp;the Retired and Senior Volunteer Programme (RSVP).&nbsp; They basically run a scheme in which older Singaporeans act as mentors&nbsp;for latchkey kids.&nbsp; In one scheme, you are addressing both the needs of the elderly and the needs of the young latchkey kids.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to&nbsp;encourage more of such projects, and we will set aside $200,000 out of the $1 million for the ASP fund for small-scale projects which are worth $10,000 or less.&nbsp; If need be, and if there are more ideas out there, we will look for additional funds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will also&nbsp;organise more elderly-focused events, starting with an Inter-Generation Bonding Family Day in <p align=left>Column: 2420<p>June 2005, and a Sports and Mind-Games Carnival in September 2005, and these are in addition to our regular&nbsp;Senior Citizens' Week which is held every November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to&nbsp;also give the elderly more reasons to be active.&nbsp; Some businesses offer discounts to the elderly during the annual Senior Citizens' Week.&nbsp; MCYS will build on this arrangement by introducing a Concessionary Card for seniors aged 65 and above.&nbsp; Examples of these benefits could include discounts at leisure and sports facilities, shopping centres and restaurants.&nbsp; Mind you, we are not asking for handouts.&nbsp; It makes business sense to reach out to the elderly since they are a growing segment of our population.&nbsp; But by organising it, we can optimise this and make it more attractive for the elderly to go out there to shop, to eat, or just to spend time with each other and get out of their rooms and their flats.&nbsp; In addition, we&nbsp;will also be introducing an annual ''Elder-Friendly Award''.&nbsp; This is to recognise&nbsp;organisations that adopt elder-friendly practices or provide elder-friendly infrastructure, services or products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Davinder Singh and Dr Lily Neo brought up this very emotive issue of elder abuse.&nbsp; I sympathise entirely with their views.&nbsp; The issue of whether there should be automatic enhancements of penalties for people convicted of abusing the elderly is a complex one which affects the judicial system and the administration of justice, and one which I will leave it&nbsp;to the Minister for Law to address.&nbsp; But, really, the issue is not just one of punishment.&nbsp; We should be looking at preventing it from happening in the first place.&nbsp; And there are still things which we can do to prevent elder abuse or at least to mitigate the effects of elder abuse.&nbsp; It is worthwhile remembering that actually even today, under current legislation, the elder person who is abused can seek help and redress.&nbsp; The Maintenance of Parents' Act is an avenue for the elderly to seek financial<p align=left>Column: 2421<p> support from unfilial children.&nbsp; Under the Women's Charter, although we call it the Women's Charter, its protection really extends far beyond that of just women.&nbsp; Anyone in the family who suffers physical, emotional or psychological</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>abuse can apply for a&nbsp;Personal Protection Order from a Family Court.&nbsp; And the Family Court can make additional orders, including requiring individuals who are involved in family violence to attend mandatory counselling.&nbsp; A breach of the Protection Order constitutes a seizable offence for which one will be arrested. The Penal Code has provisions to protect the elderly against serious offences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to inform Dr Lily Neo that professionals and caregivers are already legally empowered and obligated to advocate on behalf of the elderly victims and help the elderly make informed decisions to protect their interests.&nbsp; The caregiver can apply for a Protection Order on behalf of the elderly person.&nbsp;&nbsp; And if there is criminal intent, the caregiver should report to the Police. The Police will investigate the matter and take appropriate action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MCYS has established a national network of agencies to ensure that there is effective early detection and intervention for both victims and perpetrators of elder abuse.&nbsp; An elderly person who requires help can access services through these contact points, including Family Service Centres, the Police, hospitals and the court.&nbsp; In the last two years, my Ministry has been conducting regular training sessions to help these service providers intervene appropriately.&nbsp; A booklet on elder abuse and neglect has been developed to guide the service providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning from our experience with child abuse, we have also piloted a programme which we call the Elder<p align=left>Column: 2422<p> Protection Team.&nbsp; This is to manage elder abuse cases.&nbsp; It is a&nbsp;multi-disciplinary team that consists of professionals from fields like geriatrics, psychiatry, law and social work, and it is spearheaded by a VWO called Trans&nbsp;Centre which specialises in family violence.&nbsp; The members constitute representatives from Alexandra Hospital, the Institute of Mental Health, Law Faculty of NUS, the Tsao Foundation and representatives from my Ministry.&nbsp; This will play a primary role in conducting enquiries into the needs of people who are caught in this unfortunate predicament and ensuring that intervention plans are carried out. We will work with the Police and the grassroots organisations to extend our outreach and ensure that the elderly are informed of their rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The point about empowering banks to intervene in cases of financial fraud is not so straightforward.&nbsp; In the case of children, they are not adults, they do not have&nbsp;rights to enter into contracts and sign cheques.&nbsp; In the case of the elderly, they are adults and they have legal rights. Whilst you may want to protect them, we need to do so without depriving older Singaporeans of their legal rights to enter into contracts. So there is a fine balance between protection and removing the autonomy and respect which older Singaporeans should enjoy.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is an issue which we will study in greater detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn very quickly&nbsp;to the&nbsp;other area on helping persons with disabilities.&nbsp; We have&nbsp;two principles governing our approach.&nbsp; First, we want disabled Singaporeans to be&nbsp;integrated into mainstream society.&nbsp; Second, we want to maximise the potential of disabled Singaporeans.&nbsp; We want them to be able to be&nbsp;as independent as possible.&nbsp; It is in their interest and the interest of their families and society in general.&nbsp; My Ministry will be raising its&nbsp;spending on disability-related programmes by one-third to $39 million this financial year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2423<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Integration with society means giving people with disabilities more opportunities.&nbsp; It means making Singapore more disabled-friendly.&nbsp; An example of this also means&nbsp;making sure our transport infrastructure is upgraded and truly disabled-friendly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have taken significant steps to make Singapore more disabled-friendly.&nbsp; We know that LTA has announced&nbsp;that by&nbsp;2006, all existing MRT stations would be retrofitted and be accessible to all, including those with&nbsp;wheelchairs.&nbsp; The pace of the Lift Upgrading Programme has been accelerated by the Ministry of National Development.&nbsp; This and many other issues, for example, where my Ministry cannot do it alone, we need to work closely with MOT, MND, MOH and many other Ministries to achieve this.&nbsp; But I promise we will continue to be the agitator and the champion for increasing the access of the disabled into mainstream society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I now want to touch on the Assistive Technology Fund (ATF).&nbsp; This provides subsidies for assistive technology, basically computer and other high-tech&nbsp;equipment which can enable disabled people to overcome their primary disabilities.&nbsp; Let me give you an example. A secondary three student with muscular dystrophy was one&nbsp;of the recent beneficiaries of this scheme. Through this scheme, he was able to obtain some&nbsp;assistive computer technology which helped&nbsp;him&nbsp;keep up with his school work.&nbsp; By enabling him to keep up with his school work, he would be able to achieve fully and better education and, ultimately, better hope for the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be enhancing this scheme in four ways.&nbsp; First, we will allow pre-school children to benefit from the ATF.&nbsp; That&nbsp; is because intervention at an earlier age is more significant than intervening at a later stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we are going to&nbsp;increase the subsidies available&nbsp;for people under the Assistive Technology Fund. We will<p align=left>Column: 2424<p> increase it&nbsp;by 15%.&nbsp; For households earning less than $300 per person, we will increase the subsidy all the way up to&nbsp;90%.&nbsp; Third, we are going to make&nbsp;it easier for the disabled to apply for the ATF.&nbsp; In the past, the disabled could only apply through&nbsp;six ATF assessment centres. Now, we will enable them to apply for it through any VWO or hospital.&nbsp; Fourth, some disabled require specialised assessment and assistance in using these&nbsp;devices. The Society of the Physically Disabled, with the support of NCSS, has set up a Specialised Assistive Technology Centre to do this.&nbsp; All these enhancements to the ATF will benefit an estimated 1,150 persons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Sin Boon Ann called for improving the employment prospects for people with&nbsp;disabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;We focus&nbsp;our effort on job placement, vocational assessment and training.&nbsp; As at December 2004, Bizlink, which is a non-profit organisation, has managed to place about&nbsp;56% of the disabled who registered with them looking for&nbsp;jobs.&nbsp; This is a considerable success rate if you think of the obstacles that they confront.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are now looking at the development of&nbsp;more employment test beds. An employment testbed is an arrangement where a&nbsp; VWO&nbsp;partners an employer to specially design&nbsp;the job so that the disabled person can do it.&nbsp; Examples have been cited in this House, like restaurants, waiters, etc.&nbsp; This complements the national job redesign programme that NTUC is spearheading.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a pilot employment testbed that we started last year,&nbsp;the Association of Persons with Special Needs (APSN) worked with Training Master Workforce Institute to successfully place 60% of its clients in cleaning jobs.&nbsp; With the success of this testbed, we are going to&nbsp;launch two more employment testbeds this year. We will continue to study this and see how we can optimise this further.&nbsp; But I want to say&nbsp;that I am not in favour of making legislative<p align=left>Column: 2425<p> changes or affirmative action to guarantee access or to improve the access of the disabled people as far as getting jobs is concerned.&nbsp; There are many people who are looking for jobs. We, as a matter of principle, have resisted the temptation to rely on affirmative action and of making legislative changes because of the job and labour rigidity that will create its impact on the competitiveness of our economy.&nbsp; But, more importantly, it will in the long run impair the employability of people with disabilities. They may get token jobs, but not real jobs.&nbsp; It is better that we tackle the upstream&nbsp;- the&nbsp;more difficult part of changing jobs, changing mindsets and redesigning opportunities -&nbsp;before we resort to what seems like an obvious easy solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now touch on maximising the potential&nbsp;of children with disabilities.&nbsp; We know that early intervention makes a difference.&nbsp; Despite the Government subsidies for early intervention centres (or EIPIC), it can still cost a parent up to $400 a month to send a child to&nbsp;such an early intervention centre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why we are now going to liberalise the use&nbsp;of the Baby Bonus for parents who want to send such children for early intervention programmes.&nbsp; This will unlock potentially up to $24,000 per child to be used for these&nbsp;programmes.&nbsp; This will take effect from 1st July this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will touch on other aspects of the Baby Bonus with the remaining time that I have.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo, Mr Sin Boon Ann and Miss Penny Low talked about caregivers. &nbsp;It is a&nbsp; labour of love to care for someone who is elderly, sick&nbsp;or disabled.&nbsp; Caregivers are often under-recognised and need our support and admiration as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do agree that we need to help them, provide them more information, training and emotional support.&nbsp; In order to help them,&nbsp;we will be introducing a&nbsp;\"Care Coordinators\"&nbsp;pilot project at 10 eldercare facilities across the<p align=left>Column: 2426<p> island.&nbsp;&nbsp;A care coordinator will provide information on services that can support the caregiver, assist in referring cases, and provide counselling for the caregiver.&nbsp; The care coordinator will also arrange for training and&nbsp;support programmes to enhance the welfare of caregivers.&nbsp; If this pilot works,&nbsp;we will extend it to more centres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also happy to report&nbsp;that nine days ago, on 1st March, we set up a&nbsp;Disability Information and Resource Centre (DIRC). This is a one-stop centre which will provide information and guidance&nbsp;to all those who&nbsp;need help in looking after the&nbsp;disabled.&nbsp;It will be a hotline service and it&nbsp;also provides&nbsp;face-to-face consultation services as well as web and electronic access. We hope it will&nbsp; ease the burden&nbsp;on caregivers by helping with referrals to the most appropriate&nbsp;agencies -&nbsp;the hospitals, VWOs, CDCs&nbsp;and&nbsp;other&nbsp;organisations which can help the people under their care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To raise the awareness of the importance of home-based caregiving and to publicise other&nbsp;forms of caregiver support, my Ministry will earmark an annual budget of $400,000 to fund sustained public education programmes for caregivers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me just touch on families.&nbsp; All of us cherish our families.&nbsp;They are&nbsp;our greatest source of joy, friendship, emotional satisfaction and moral support.&nbsp; Our families mould us, define our values, and ultimately give our lives meaning.&nbsp; But family life and work all clamour for our attention. All of us need&nbsp;to constantly remind ourselves&nbsp;as to&nbsp;what is truly important in our lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we try to&nbsp;support families at a practical level, the Government has already taken some concrete measures. The&nbsp;five-day work week was introduced in the civil service. We provided&nbsp;childcare leave, additional maternity leave as well<p align=left>Column: 2427<p> as funding for initiatives that promote work-life balance in companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Financial support, in the form of&nbsp; Baby Bonus,&nbsp;is part of the pro-family package.&nbsp; Mr Sin Boon Ann asked whether this money has resulted in any improvement in the birth rates. Sir, I really do not want to&nbsp;count the chickens - or the&nbsp;babies - before they are hatched.&nbsp; But I do want to&nbsp;assure Mr Sin that we are&nbsp;working with the people and the&nbsp;private sector to actively promote strong family bonds.&nbsp; We conduct marriage support and enrichment programmes, parent-child bonding initiatives as well as training on parenting skills and inter-generational bonding activities.&nbsp; We have initiatives like the&nbsp;School Family Education and the \"School Social Work to Empower Pupils to Utilise their Potential\" programme (or STEP-UP), which have been set up in 144 schools, to help parents upgrade their parenting skills while equipping their children with life skills.&nbsp; That said, a strong family&nbsp;only works as an act of will and commitment. The&nbsp;foundation for a family ultimately must be love, respect and communication.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government and the&nbsp;community can only provide a supporting environment.&nbsp; We cannot make it happen.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the effectiveness of the Baby Bonus and other monetary schemes, I want to reiterate this point: the decision to have a baby must be a personal decision made by the two people involved, and not by the Government.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our financial support is not an incentive&nbsp;to \"buy\" more babies.&nbsp; It is your decision, but we will support you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that the cost of raising a child is&nbsp;a key consideration for many couples.&nbsp; So the Baby Bonus was conceived, unintended, as a way to help defray the costs of raising children.&nbsp; The Baby Bonus<p align=left>Column: 2428<p> has a two-tier grant structure.&nbsp; The first-tier is a direct cash gift of $3,000 each for the first and second child, and $6,000 each for the third and fourth child.&nbsp; The second-tier is a co-savings component over&nbsp;six years where Government matches the parents' contributions into the child's saving account,&nbsp;dollar for dollar, up to a maximum amount.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have received much feedback over the last few months asking that this scheme be made more flexible.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made it more flexible in two ways.&nbsp; First, we allow the co-savings to be used to pay the fees of not only MCYS-licensed childcare centres and MOE-registered kindergartens, but we will now allow&nbsp;the Baby Bonus co-savings to be used to&nbsp;purchase MediShield or MediShield-equivalent healthcare insurance for their children from December 2005.&nbsp; This will give parents greater peace of mind over unexpected medical bills, should their children suffer from prolonged medical problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also be more flexible in the way we match the parents' savings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some parents miss out on the contributions every year because they say, \"Well, I am unemployed\",&nbsp;or \"I have cash flow problem and I cannot contribute to&nbsp;it now.\".&nbsp;&nbsp;Others say, \"I want to put all the money in upfront, early.\".&nbsp;&nbsp;We have increased the flexibility so that&nbsp;parents can \u201ctop up\ufffd? the co-savings up to a maximum of $6,000 for the second child and $12,000 each for the third and fourth child, any time within the six-year period, and we will match it.&nbsp;&nbsp;With this flexibility, I would encourage all families to take advantage of the savings scheme&nbsp;and set aside money for their children's long-term future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also make it more convenient for parents to benefit from the Baby Bonus Scheme.&nbsp; In the past, even right now, parents have to&nbsp;fill in an application form for the Baby Bonus cash gift, then<p align=left>Column: 2429<p> they have to&nbsp;make a trip down to a POSB branch to open a co-savings account.&nbsp; We will now move towards&nbsp;a one-stop, one-form,&nbsp;opt-out system, for both the cash gift and the Baby Bonus co-savings, all at the point when you register your&nbsp;child.&nbsp; We want to make it convenient and we want all of you to open this account, and not make it difficult and <I>lechey</I> for you to do so.&nbsp; Our target is to do this by December 2005.&nbsp; But, if I can accelerate it, I will do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adoption leave - we introduced this last year as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;our pro-family package to allow adoptive mothers to care for their newborns, aged 6 months and below.&nbsp; Adoptive mothers are eligible for Adoption leave of up to&nbsp;four weeks if their employers voluntarily grant it.&nbsp; The leave would be granted when the adoption was completed.&nbsp; The only problem was that usually it took more than&nbsp;six months for the&nbsp;adoption process&nbsp;to be completed and, therefore, <I>de facto</I>, hardly anyone could enjoy the leave.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, in response to feedback, we have changed the system.&nbsp; We will now allow adoptive mothers to take their&nbsp;Adoption leave at a much earlier point in the adoption process.&nbsp; With this change, adoptive mothers can take&nbsp;leave at the point when the Court appoints MCYS as Guardian-Ad-Litem, or, in the case of a foreign adoption,&nbsp;when the child has received a&nbsp;dependant's pass.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will&nbsp;mean that the leave will start fairly soon after the child is physically with the adoptive family.&nbsp; I believe this is important, especially for the mother to look after the adoptive newborn, and to bond with the newborn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Families, being the first line of support, are just one of the \u201cMany Helping Hands\ufffd? holding up our social safety net.&nbsp; Other major partners are the people sector and Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs).&nbsp; They play a vital role, as I have said earlier, in delivering <p align=left>Column: 2430<p>services on the ground.&nbsp; They feel, know and understand the problems faced by the less fortunate in our society.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need our VWOs to be professional and innovative.&nbsp; Many of them, in fact, all of them,&nbsp;rely on the public for their funds.&nbsp; We want to encourage them not only to economise on the way they spend the money, but also, as Miss Penny Low has suggested, to look for more sustainable models to generate revenue.&nbsp; And that is where this issue of social enterprise comes in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Social enterprise is basically a business, but a business with&nbsp;a social mission.&nbsp; Profits or surpluses are not generated for the sake of shareholders but are used to further a social objective.&nbsp; &nbsp;I believe&nbsp;if more VWOs try the social enterprise model, they would have a more sustainable and, hopefully, more secure source of funding in the future.&nbsp; It is also another way for VWOs to help create jobs for their target recipients of their assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, to support social enterprises, MCYS&nbsp;has already set up&nbsp;the Social Enterprise Fund a year and a half ago.&nbsp; It provides seed capital for these social enterprises and, to-date, we have awarded about $3.6 million to support 38 projects.&nbsp; Of these, 31 have already started operations.&nbsp; We have&nbsp;linked them up with more established businessmen and people with more experience in business.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make an appeal here for successful Singaporeans with business experience to lend their expertise,&nbsp;business contacts and acumen to these fledgling social enterprises.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are just infant steps.&nbsp; It is only just the beginning.&nbsp; There have been many, many more suggestions coming from MPs and people on the ground.&nbsp; I want to encourage all the people involved<p align=left>Column: 2431<p> in this to share best practices, to network and to be more innovative in coming&nbsp;up with new programmes.&nbsp; We will look&nbsp;into all these suggestions as we nurture this sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, I am not sure there is enough time.&nbsp; I was hoping actually for my Minister of State to deliver more details.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</B> Sir, just a point of clarification.&nbsp; When I mentioned about legislation to facilitate employment for the elderly and the disabled, I was not referring to any form of&nbsp; affirmative action.&nbsp; What I was referring to was the introduction of legislation to make it an offence to discriminate, and this is really quite different from reserving jobs for the elderly, which I understand bucks against<p align=left>Column: 2432<p> the trends of the market forces and may not be in our economic interests.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many countries in the West that have adopted such legislation.&nbsp; I know that one of the difficulties has to do with finding the basis for prosecuting a prospective employer on the basis of discrimination.&nbsp; But I suppose such legislation is not intended to bring about enforcement or prosecution, but to change the mindset and to signal a change on the part of prospective employers that there is a framework out there which compels them to take into account fairness and openness when seriously considering applications from such disabled or elderly persons.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> I sympathise with the intent behind&nbsp;the Member's&nbsp;proposal, but I remain unconvinced that legislation is the most effective way of changing mindsets.&nbsp; I think we have to work on persuasion, education and demonstrating by social pressure that it is wrong to discriminate.&nbsp; But the issue of discrimination goes beyond just the disabled and elderly.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are&nbsp;other cases like&nbsp;gender, ethnic or religious.&nbsp; So there are many issues when we talk about discrimination.&nbsp; So far, as a matter of policy, we have avoided the temptation to legislate against discrimination, not that we feel that it is not important, but the difficulties in enforcement and implementation have led us to hesitate before going down that road.&nbsp; But it is certainly something which you, and many of us, are concerned with, and we will continue to study this.&nbsp; I am not willing to move down that road yet.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lily Neo:</B> Mr Chairman, earlier on, the Minister said that he would leave the law on elderly abuse to the Ministry of Law.&nbsp; Can I ask him: surely, this provision must be initiated by his Ministry, rather than just leaving it to the Ministry of Law?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2433<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I ask the Minister whether he would consider setting up a&nbsp;Central Registry since he is streamlining all the different schemes of assistance and employing more social workers to look into this group that is most in need?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> The proposal from Mr Davinder Singh was for automatic enhancement of penalties for people who have been convicted of elder abuse.&nbsp; He used the precedent set by changes which we made to the law with respect to domestic maids.&nbsp; Again, I will reiterate that I share the sentiment behind it, but I want this House to be aware that every time you legislate so-called automatic enhancements of penalties, or you make mandatory penalties in place, you are actually tying the hands and the discretion of our courts and you are making our legal system less flexible.&nbsp; So there are both pros and cons to this proposal.&nbsp; I have said that I am not convinced that this is the road yet.&nbsp; But looking at what needs to be done to prevent elder abuse, what we need to do to ensure early detection of elder abuse, and what we need to do to support&nbsp;victims of elder abuse have led me to the conclusion that there is a lot more work to be done upstream, rather than opting for this apparently easy quick-fix.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I grant you that it does send a signal but, again, the problem is with implementation and the fact that you are tying the hands and the discretion of the judges.&nbsp; The prosecutors can, and do, ask for deterrent sentences.&nbsp; And that is why I said it is more an issue of the administration of justice, rather than a policy of how important elder abuse is to our society.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is still something which I would study together with my colleague, the Minister for Law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second question on social register.&nbsp; We need to set up a central registry of all people receiving help.&nbsp; Similarly, we <p align=left>Column: 2434<p>also need to keep track of all the people who are involved in this sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree that we&nbsp;need more social workers.&nbsp; But, let me tell you, social workers do not grow on trees, and it is not just a matter of money because social workers need a very special type of person with a special heart and attitude.&nbsp; In the case of Singapore, it is not again something that&nbsp;you can just freely import because the cultural sensitivity, understanding of local conditions, means it is a very precious resource.&nbsp; So I am all for looking for more support for them, but I cannot promise you that overnight you can have a large increase in social workers.&nbsp; It is just not possible.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
