Members for some days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been usual, Sir, in the past to comment at\r\n\r\nthis time on the accounts for the previous year and\r\n\r\nto  give some indication of the probable outcome of\r\n\r\nthe present year's working.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Statements for 1955 have now been\r\n\r\ntabled  and comments on them have been made in  the\r\n\r\nmemorandum  which accompanied the  Draft  Estimates\r\n\r\n[Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 61 of 1956]. I  will  not\r\n\r\nwaste the time of hon. Members by referring to them\r\n\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The probable outcome for 1956 has also been dealt\r\n\r\nwith   at  some  length  in  the  memorandum  which\r\n\r\naccompanied  the Draft Estimates, and,  of  course,\r\n\r\nfurther  details  are  given  in  the  Abstract  of\r\n\r\nExpenditure which appears at pages 15 and 16 of the\r\n\r\nvolume of Draft Estimates. In the circumstances, it\r\n\r\nwill  perhaps  be sufficient if I  now  refer  only\r\n\r\nbriefly to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, the collection of revenue has been\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.   The  yield  on  liquors,   tobacco,\r\n\r\nentertainments and betting is likely to exceed  the\r\n\r\noriginal estimate. The yield on petroleum will show\r\n\r\na  substantial  increase. Although  income  tax  is\r\n\r\nunlikely to attain the original estimate, the yield\r\n\r\nin 1956 will be substantially greater than in 1955.\r\n\r\nIn  this connection, I have now some reason to hope\r\n\r\nthat  the revised estimate may be exceeded. In all,\r\n\r\nit  seems  likely  that  revenue  collections  will\r\n\r\namount  to  about  $217 million compared  with  the\r\n\r\nestimate of $215 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also seems clear that ordinary expenditure\r\n\r\nwill  fall short of the original estimate  of  $231\r\n\r\nmillion, despite the addition during the year of  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  number  of supplementary  votes.  The\r\n\r\nrevised  estimate is $214 million. As in the  past,\r\n\r\nthere   has   been  a  certain  amount  of   under-expenditure   on   personal   emoluments   due   to\r\n\r\ndifficulties   experienced  in   finding   suitable\r\n\r\ncandidates and making appointments to vacant posts.\r\n\r\nAgain, expenditure on grants-in-aid to schools  has\r\n\r\nfallen  considerably  short of  the  estimate.  The\r\n\r\nresponse to the offer of full aid has not  been  as\r\n\r\nsatisfactory as was originally hoped.  It  must  be\r\n\r\npointed  out,  however, that this under-expenditure\r\n\r\nis  only  deferred expenditure. In the near future,\r\n\r\nall  appointments will be filled and grants-in-aid\r\n\r\ntaken up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems probable, therefore, that the working\r\n\r\nfor 1956 will show a small surplus, possibly of the\r\n\r\norder of $2 or $3 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears probable that expenditure on\r\n\r\ndevelopment  will also fall short of the  estimate.\r\n\r\nAs  in  the  past, there have been difficulties  in\r\n\r\nobtaining  sites  and  in clearing  them.  In  some\r\n\r\ncases,  sites  have proved more unstable  than  was\r\n\r\noriginally   thought  and  extensive   piling   and\r\n\r\npreparation  has  been  required.  In  some  cases,\r\n\r\nchanges in plan have caused delays. However, it  is\r\n\r\nexpected that over $40 million will be spent  under\r\n\r\nthe  Development Estimates and I am  happy  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  considerable progress has been made with  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of  new  schools  and  the  expansion  of\r\n\r\nhospital facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial position of the colony is sound.\r\n\r\nThe  Special Reserve Fund is likely to  total  $101\r\n\r\nmillion by the end of the year as a result  of  the\r\n\r\naddition of interest. There should be a balance  of\r\n\r\n$11 million in the Development Reserve Fund and the\r\n\r\nadditional  net assets of the colony  should  total\r\n\r\n$142   million.  Of  these  assets,  however,  $126\r\n\r\nmillion  are bound up in illiquid long-term  loans.\r\n\r\nThe net liquid assets of the colony may be taken as\r\n\r\n$138  million which represents a reasonably  strong\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come now to 1957. Here again, the details of\r\n\r\nthe  Draft Estimates are dealt with at some  length\r\n\r\nin  the memorandum which has been circulated and in\r\n\r\nan  appendix to the Draft Estimates themselves, and\r\n\r\nI  will do no more than draw attention to the  main\r\n\r\npoints about them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue, on the basis of existing taxation, has\r\n\r\nbeen  estimated  at close on $218 million  compared\r\n\r\nwith estimated collections of $217 million in 1956.\r\n\r\nIn  making this estimate, it has been assumed  that\r\n\r\nthe  level of trade and prosperity in Singapore  in\r\n\r\n1957  will not be very different from what  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  in  1956,  and allowance has  been  made  for\r\n\r\ngrowth   of   population  and  possible   temporary\r\n\r\nfluctuations  in trade. Consequently,  the  returns\r\n\r\nfrom    entertainments   duty,   totalisator    and\r\n\r\nsweeptakes  duty, liquor and tobacco are  estimated\r\n\r\nat  much  the  same level as collections  in  1956.\r\n\r\nAllowance  has, however, been made for  a  probable\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  consumption of petrol,  and  the\r\n\r\nlevel   of  prosperity  of  companies  trading   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  1955 and 1956 has  been  taken  into\r\n\r\naccount in estimating income tax at $5 million more\r\n\r\nthan the estimated 1956 collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always a tendency to estimate revenue\r\n\r\nconservatively,   and,  given  a  continuation   of\r\n\r\npresent  trading conditions, it may  well  be  that\r\n\r\nthis  estimate of $218 million is exceeded  in  the\r\n\r\nevent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Draft Estimates of Expenditure (including\r\n\r\nrevotes)  total  $254 million, an increase  of  $23\r\n\r\nmillion on the 1956 total of $231 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase of $23 million is largely due to\r\n\r\nincreases of $11 million on Education, $2.7 million\r\n\r\non  Medical  and Health, $2.5 million on  Pensions,\r\n\r\nand  $1.2 million in the contribution to the  Rural\r\n\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distribution of expenditure between the main\r\n\r\nservices of Government follows closely the  pattern\r\n\r\nof  previous  years. The social  services,  namely,\r\n\r\nEducation, Medical and Health, account\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  40 per cent of the total, Defence and Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity including Prisons and Judicial take 16 per\r\n\r\ncent,  and  Communications and Works  take  12  per\r\n\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some idea of the growth of the Government service\r\n\r\nin sympathy with the expanding economy of Singapore\r\n\r\nand  of  the great expansion of the social services\r\n\r\nmay  be  obtained from the Statement of Expenditure\r\n\r\nincurred from 1947 to 1955 which appears  at  page\r\n\r\n13  of the Draft Estimates. This, together with the\r\n\r\nStatement of Revenue collected for the same period,\r\n\r\nwhich appears at page 9 of the Draft Estimates,  is\r\n\r\na  new  feature of the Draft Estimates which merits\r\n\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is once more a considerable increase in the\r\n\r\nprovision for personal emoluments, the estimate for\r\n\r\n1957  being $113 million compared with $98  million\r\n\r\nin 1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual increments account for a substantial\r\n\r\nproportion  of this increase but there are  also  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable number of new appointments, mainly  in\r\n\r\nconnection with the expanding Education and Medical\r\n\r\nServices, which account for over 70 per cent of the\r\n\r\ntotal.  Details of these, new appointments will  be\r\n\r\nfound on page 7 of the memorandum which accompanied\r\n\r\nthe Draft Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great care has been taken to ensure that only\r\n\r\nposts   which  are  essential  for  the   efficient\r\n\r\ndischarge  of  the duties of Government  have  been\r\n\r\nentered in the Draft Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as departments are concerned, Education\r\n\r\npersonal  emoluments  have  increased  by  over  $7\r\n\r\nmillion,  Medical  and Health  by  $2  million  and\r\n\r\nDefence Services by just under $2 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for Other Charges Annually\r\n\r\nRecurrent  also shows a substantial  increase  from\r\n\r\n$87 million in 1956 to $100 million in 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, the main increases appear under the\r\n\r\nSocial  Services.  Education has  increased  by  $4\r\n\r\nmillion,  Medical  and Health  by  $1  million  and\r\n\r\nSocial Welfare by $1.5 million. The contribution to\r\n\r\nthe  Rural Board has been increased by $1.2 million\r\n\r\nin connection with the expansion of services in the\r\n\r\nrural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  provision for Pensions and Retiring allowances\r\n\r\nhas been increased by $2.5 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for Special Expenditure is $40\r\n\r\nmillion, including a contribution of $20 million to\r\n\r\nDevelopment  and  Re-votes  of  $1.8  million.  The\r\n\r\nprovision  for  new Special Expenditure  proper  is\r\n\r\nlimited  to $18 million. This, of course,  excludes\r\n\r\nthe  provision  made for special expenditure  of  a\r\n\r\ndevelopmental  character  which  is  made  in   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A contribution of $20 million is again made\r\n\r\ntowards   development.  We  have   very   ambitious\r\n\r\ndevelopment plans which will cost over $310 million\r\n\r\nover  the  next  six  years.  It  is  going  to  be\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  obtain all the  funds  necessary  to\r\n\r\nfinance  this development and it is essential  that\r\n\r\nan  annual contribution should be made from revenue\r\n\r\nand that it should be as substantial as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be noted that no provision is made for\r\n\r\nthe  cost of Malayanisation in the Draft Estimates.\r\n\r\nA  compensation  scheme has not yet been  finalised\r\n\r\nand  no  estimate of the possible cost  of  such  a\r\n\r\nscheme,  or how much will fall to be met  in  1957,\r\n\r\nhas yet been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position therefore is that, against an\r\n\r\nestimate  of revenue of $217 million,  we  have  an\r\n\r\nestimate of expenditure of $254 million, and we are\r\n\r\nfaced with an estimated deficit of $37 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is doubtful if the position is quite as\r\n\r\nserious as would appear from these figures. As hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  are  aware, even allowing  for  unforeseen\r\n\r\ncalls on public funds which have arisen during  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of the year - some of them substantial - actual\r\n\r\nexpenditure has in the past invariably fallen short\r\n\r\nof  the estimate. It is likely that this will occur\r\n\r\nagain in 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, recruitment difficulties still\r\n\r\nexist.   Sometimes  suitable  candidates  are   not\r\n\r\navailable.  Sometimes there are unavoidable  delays\r\n\r\nin  selecting candidates and in making appointments\r\n\r\nto  vacant  posts. All these difficulties  tend  to\r\n\r\nreduce expenditure on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npersonal emoluments, and it is not unreasonable  to\r\n\r\nexpect   considerable  under-expenditure  on   that\r\n\r\naccount  on  a total provision of $113  million  in 1957.  This  is  borne  out  by  the  figures   for\r\n\r\nestimated   and  actual  expenditure  on   personal\r\n\r\nemoluments  which  are quoted  on  page  7  of  the\r\n\r\nmemorandum which accompanied the Draft Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not so easy to foresee savings on Other\r\n\r\nCharges  Annually Recurrent votes. These votes  are\r\n\r\nalways pared to the minimum. Experience in the past\r\n\r\nhas   generally   been   that  actual   expenditure\r\n\r\napproximates  closely to the  estimate.  This  will\r\n\r\nprobably prove to be the case with the majority  of\r\n\r\ndepartments  in 1957, despite the economy  campaign\r\n\r\nwhich is now being waged. On the other hand, as  in\r\n\r\nthe  past,  there may be savings  on  some  of  the\r\n\r\nlarger  departments  like  Education,  Medical  and\r\n\r\nHealth   and  Defence  Services,  and  some  under-expenditure  on a total provision of  $100  million\r\n\r\ncan probably be expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will also be some under-expenditure in\r\n\r\nSpecial Expenditure, resulting in revotes in  1958,\r\n\r\nbut this will not be substantial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to make any estimate of actual\r\n\r\nexpenditure  in  1957 which has any pretensions  to\r\n\r\naccuracy.  Too  many unknown factors are  involved.\r\n\r\nHowever, on the basis of past experience and having\r\n\r\nregard  to  the  factors I have  mentioned,  it  is\r\n\r\npossible   that   actual  expenditure   will   fall\r\n\r\nconsiderably short of the estimate. With  increased\r\n\r\ntaxation  on the one hand and under-expenditure  on\r\n\r\nthe  other,  there  is  a  reasonable  prospect  of\r\n\r\nrevenue  and actual expenditure balancing in  1957.\r\n\r\nIf this should not prove to be the case, there will\r\n\r\nbe no alternative but to introduce further measures\r\n\r\nof taxation in order to achieve a balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come now to the Development Estimates for 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before commenting on these estimates, I should\r\n\r\nlike  to draw attention to one important change  in\r\n\r\nfinancial procedure which it is proposed to make in 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, our development commitments\r\n\r\nare such that it is going to be extremely difficult\r\n\r\nto  find all the funds required to meet them. It is\r\n\r\ntherefore  necessary to make all funds, surplus  to\r\n\r\nbasic    reserve   requirements,   available    for\r\n\r\ndevelopment. Again, as I said earlier, our  reserve\r\n\r\nposition  is strong. It is estimated that,  by  the\r\n\r\nend  of  1956, our liquid resources will be of  the\r\n\r\norder of $138 million. These are at present divided\r\n\r\nup  amongst  the  Special Reserve Fund  created  by\r\n\r\nresolution of the Legislative Council in 1954,  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Reserve Fund created at the  same  time\r\n\r\nand  in  the  same  way,  and  surplus  dollar  and\r\n\r\nsterling securities. Experience elsewhere indicates\r\n\r\nthat it is desirable to keep something of the order\r\n\r\nof  four  months' revenue as a basic reserve,  and\r\n\r\nthat any surpluses in excess of this amount can  be\r\n\r\nutilised for other purposes. This basic reserve  is\r\n\r\nthe   sheet  anchor  of  a  colony's  finances  and\r\n\r\nconstitutes  a revenue and expenditure equalisation\r\n\r\nfund from which unexpected shortfalls in revenue or\r\n\r\nunexpected  increases in expenditure  can  be  met,\r\n\r\npending  recoupment either by savings or  increased\r\n\r\ntaxation. In view of our need for funds for capital\r\n\r\ndevelopment,   it  is  now  suggested   that   this\r\n\r\npractice,   which   has  been   thoroughly   tested\r\n\r\nelsewhere, should be followed in  Singapore,  that\r\n\r\nthe  general revenue balance should be  reduced  to\r\n\r\n$70  million (or rather more than 4 months' revenue\r\n\r\nat  the present time), and that the balance of  our\r\n\r\nliquid  resources  should  be  transferred   to   a\r\n\r\nreconstituted Development Fund. Since  the  Special\r\n\r\nReserve  Fund  was  created by  resolution  of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Council, a resolution of this  Assembly\r\n\r\nwill  be  required  to  give  effect  to  this  new\r\n\r\nproposal.  I  hope to move this resolution  on  the\r\n\r\n20th of November. In the meantime, the Statement of\r\n\r\nAssets  and Liabilities on page 8 of the  Estimates\r\n\r\nand the Development Fund Account have been drawn up\r\n\r\non   the  assumption  that  the  proposal  will  be\r\n\r\napproved.  The Statement of Assets and  Liabilities\r\n\r\nhas  been drawn up in duplicate. One copy, on pages\r\n\r\n6  and 7, has been prepared in the old manner.  The\r\n\r\nother  shows the position after the Special Reserve\r\n\r\nFund has been liquidated, the General Reserve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBalance  reduced to $70 million and the balance  of\r\n\r\nliquid assets transferred to the Development  Fund.\r\n\r\nThis  Development Fund is shown on page 367 of  the\r\n\r\nEstimates. On the Income side, it shows the balance\r\n\r\nof  the  liquid assets of the colony including  the\r\n\r\nbalance  of  the  Special and  Development  Reserve\r\n\r\nFunds,   the  annual  contribution  from   revenue,\r\n\r\nColonial     Development    and    Welfare     Fund\r\n\r\ncontributions,  and  repayments  of  principal   of\r\n\r\nexisting  Singapore  Improvement  Trust  and  other\r\n\r\nloans  which  should be credited to the Development\r\n\r\nFund  Account.  On the expenditure  side  is  shown\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on  general development,  on  Colonial\r\n\r\nDevelopment and Welfare projects, and loans to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Improvement  Trust  and  other   quasi-government bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising also out of a consideration of the\r\n\r\nStatement of Assets and Liabilities, is a  proposal\r\n\r\nthat  existing  long-term loans  to  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust  and  other  bodies  should   be\r\n\r\ncharged  to expenditure and not shown as assets  in\r\n\r\nthe   Statement.  This  proposal  is  made  at  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion of the Director of Audit on the  grounds\r\n\r\nthat it is established financial practice that  all\r\n\r\ntransactions, including loans, which  diminish  the\r\n\r\ncolony's free surplus of revenue should be recorded\r\n\r\nas  expenditure  at the time payment  is  made.  In\r\n\r\nSingapore, the practice of showing as assets  long-term  loans,  which in the case  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust are repaid over periods of up  to\r\n\r\n60 years, has sprung up since the war. The position\r\n\r\nhas  now been reached where these assets, which are\r\n\r\nin  no  sense of the term liquid, total about  $126\r\n\r\nmillion  and,  by  being shown  as  assets  in  the\r\n\r\nStatement  of  Assets  and  Liabilities,  paint  an\r\n\r\nentirely  erroneous  picture of  the  strength  and\r\n\r\nliquidity   of  the  colony's  finances.   It   has\r\n\r\ntherefore been decided to agree to the Director  of\r\n\r\nAudit's  suggestion and to charge  these  long-term\r\n\r\nloans   to  expenditure.  This  will  be  done   by\r\n\r\nresolution of the Assembly as soon as the  accounts\r\n\r\nfor  1956  have  been closed and the  exact  totals\r\n\r\ninvolved  are  known. It will  be  appreciated,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, that this is purely a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatter  of  book-keeping. No additional expenditure\r\n\r\nis  involved. The result will be that the Statement\r\n\r\nof  Assets  and Liabilities will give a  much  more\r\n\r\naccurate idea of the strength and liquidity of  the\r\n\r\ncolony's financial position. A Statement of  Assets\r\n\r\nand  Liabilities drawn up on this basis  is,  as  I\r\n\r\nhave said, shown on page 8 of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Estimates are shown on pages 367\r\n\r\nto 405 of the Draft Estimates. The Development Fund\r\n\r\nAccount is shown on page 367.

A start will also be made with a home  for\r\n\r\nthe  chronic sick which will relieve congestion  in\r\n\r\nthe  main hospitals. Roughly $7 million is provided\r\n\r\nfor the development of existing hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the money available for general\r\n\r\ndevelopment has been allocated to other departments\r\n\r\nto meet their more pressing needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the rest, a sum of $15 million has been\r\n\r\nearmarked  for  Public Housing and $5  million  for\r\n\r\nTelephone Development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not expected that all the money shown in\r\n\r\nthese  estimates  will be spent. As  in  the  past,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  difficulties in  obtaining  sites,\r\n\r\nclearing   them  of  squatters,  and   making   the\r\n\r\nnecessary  preparations for building. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  no  provision has been made  for  unforeseen\r\n\r\ncontingencies. On balance, however, it  is  thought\r\n\r\nthat  actual  expenditure will fall  short  of  the\r\n\r\nestimate  and that there will be a balance  in  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund at the end of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, therefore, there seems a reasonable\r\n\r\nprospect  that,  allowing for  increased  taxation,\r\n\r\nrevenue and expenditure will balance in 1957. There\r\n\r\nwill  probably  also  be a  small  balance  in  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund and the general  revenue  balance\r\n\r\nwill  be of the order of $70 million at the end  of\r\n\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is desirable, Sir, at this stage to give an\r\n\r\noutline   of   Government's  future   capital   and\r\n\r\nrecurrent  requirements as  a  background  for  the\r\n\r\nproposals  for  new taxation which I shall  shortly\r\n\r\nintroduce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, the development needs\r\n\r\nof  Singapore are very great, and it  will  cost  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  in  terms  of  capital  and  recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure  to  meet  these  needs.  A  number  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment  plans exist, but they  have  all  been\r\n\r\ngreatly  modified since they were drawn  up.  Ideas\r\n\r\nand  needs  have changed. Experience has  suggested\r\n\r\nnew  approaches. Priorities have altered,  and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, costs have greatly increased. All the plans\r\n\r\nare in need of revision and co-ordination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, no recent attempt has been made to assess\r\n\r\nthe  needs  of the colony as a whole or  to  relate\r\n\r\nthese needs to the funds likely to be available  or\r\n\r\nto the capacity of the colony to meet the recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure arising from the plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for an early re-assessment of the\r\n\r\ncolony's  development requirements on  these  lines\r\n\r\nwas realised by the Chief Minister and he asked Sir\r\n\r\nSydney Caine to study the matter in his capacity as\r\n\r\nEconomic Adviser. Shortly before his departure, Sir\r\n\r\nSydney Caine incorporated the results of his  study\r\n\r\nin a confidential memorandum to the Chief Minister.\r\n\r\nI have the Chief Minister's permission to give hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  the  main  conclusions  reached   in   the\r\n\r\nmemorandum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the capital development requirements of\r\n\r\nthe  colony as a whole for the period 1958-1962 are\r\n\r\nassessed  at  $750 million. Of these  requirements,\r\n\r\ncertain   projects  totalling  $570   million   are\r\n\r\nregarded  as  essential and have been placed  in  a\r\n\r\npriority  list.  This priority list  provides  $226\r\n\r\nmillion for General Development by Government,  and\r\n\r\nincludes $51 million for Education, $40 million for\r\n\r\nMedical  and  Health, $21 million for Commerce  and\r\n\r\nIndustry,  $20 million for Drainage and Irrigation,\r\n\r\n$40  million  for  the Purchase  of  Land  and  $22\r\n\r\nmillion   for  Communications.  $200   million   is\r\n\r\nprovided for the City Council, mainly in connection\r\n\r\nwith  the  development  of public  utilities,  $115\r\n\r\nmillion for the Improvement Trust, $18 million  for\r\n\r\nthe   Harbour  Board,  and  $20  million  for   the\r\n\r\nTelephone Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This constitutes a five-year plan for development\r\n\r\nwhich, I think, is as ambitious, comprehensive  and\r\n\r\nfar-sighted as can be found in any country in  this\r\n\r\npart of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gives expression to the feelings of the\r\n\r\nGovernment in the matter of development  which  are\r\n\r\nexpressed  in  the  words  of  the  memorandum   as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Singapore depends basically on its position as a\r\n\r\ngreat  communications and trading centre. Secondly,\r\n\r\nand  arising  from its trade and shipping  are  its\r\n\r\nmanufacturing activities, first, for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  needs  of  its own population  and  then  for\r\n\r\nexport.   Third  are  other  activities   depending\r\n\r\noriginally upon, but also now adding to, its  value\r\n\r\nas   a  communications  and  trading  centre;   its\r\n\r\nposition as a military and naval base, as a tourist\r\n\r\ncentre,  as  a  convenient place, for international\r\n\r\nmeetings or as a centre of higher education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain its position in all these fields\r\n\r\nSingapore needs, first, good public services;  port\r\n\r\ninstallations,  airport, roads and other  transport\r\n\r\nfacilities;  power  supply - electricity   and   gas;\r\n\r\ndrainage and so on. Secondly, its reputation as  a\r\n\r\nport  of call requires maintenance of public health\r\n\r\nmeasures. Thirdly, it requires the education of its\r\n\r\npopulation; a high level of technical education  is\r\n\r\nespecially  important  for industrial  development.\r\n\r\nAnd  fourthly, it needs investment in the plant and\r\n\r\nequipment necessary for manufacturing industry. The\r\n\r\nfirst  three are almost entirely within the  public\r\n\r\nsector,  the fourth is mainly a matter for  private\r\n\r\nfinance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be a formidable task to raise the funds\r\n\r\nrequired  for  this  essential development  over  a\r\n\r\nperiod of five years, particularly as not very much\r\n\r\nassistance  can  be expected from outside  sources.\r\n\r\nSir Sydney Caine, however, considers that it can be\r\n\r\ndone provided that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Government revenue is increased by stages\r\n\r\nover the next three years, including 1957,\r\n\r\nto yield  at  least an additional $50  million  by      1959, thus allowing a more substantial\r\n\r\ncontribution from revenue to development than  is\r\n\r\nmade at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Other public bodies, but particularly the City Council, can continue to make substantial annual contributions from revenue to development.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) An overseas agency can be persuaded to agree\r\n\r\nto make a loan to the City Council for\r\n\r\nelectricity development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d )Local capital resources are mobilised to the\r\n\r\nfull, a suitable climate and opportunities\r\n\r\nfor investment   are  created,  and  the   general\r\n\r\npublic is made to realise the necessity of\r\n\r\nsaving  and  investment  in  Government  loans  in\r\n\r\norder to obtain the services which it wants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these conditions are not met, development\r\n\r\nplans  will have to be prolonged, reduced  or  even\r\n\r\nabandoned, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore will not get the services which\r\n\r\nthey   require,   and,  perhaps   worst   of   all,\r\n\r\nSingapore's position as one of the main centres  of\r\n\r\nworld trade will be undermined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that none of us in this Assembly would\r\n\r\nwillingly allow this to happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards revenue and recurrent expenditure on\r\n\r\nGovernment  account, it is envisaged that,  on  the\r\n\r\npresent  (1956)   basis  of  taxation  and  given  a\r\n\r\ncontinuation of present trading conditions, revenue\r\n\r\nwill  increase slowly in sympathy with the  growing\r\n\r\npopulation until it reaches a total of something of\r\n\r\nthe order of $235 million in 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, expenditure (excluding any\r\n\r\ncontribution  towards  development)  will  increase\r\n\r\nmuch   more   rapidly  as  development  plans   are\r\n\r\nimplemented  and  as  interest  and  sinking   fund\r\n\r\ncharges  on new loans are added to the total  bill.\r\n\r\nIt  is  considered more than possible that it  will\r\n\r\nreach  a total of over $260 million (excluding  any\r\n\r\ncontribution to development) by 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would be a striking increase over a period\r\n\r\nof  six years and hon. Members will no doubt wonder\r\n\r\nhow   it   can  come  about.  In  this  connection,\r\n\r\nattention  is  once again invited to the  table  of\r\n\r\nactual expenditure from 1947 to 1955 which is given\r\n\r\non  page 13 of the Draft Estimates. From this table\r\n\r\nhon.  Members will see very clearly how expenditure\r\n\r\non  Education in particular is increasing by  leaps\r\n\r\nand  bounds - $15  million in 1952,  $17  million  in\r\n\r\n1953, $24 million in 1954, $30 million in 1955  and\r\n\r\n$35  million estimated in 1956. It may well be  $60\r\n\r\nmillion by 1962. Expenditure on Medical and  Health\r\n\r\nServices  is mounting in a similar way - $15  million\r\n\r\nin  1952,  $16.6  million in 1953, $20  million  in\r\n\r\n1954, $22 million in 1955 and $27 million estimated\r\n\r\nin  1956. As hospitals expand and new hospitals are\r\n\r\nbuilt,  so expenditure will increase. It  has  been\r\n\r\nestimated  that, by 1962, expenditure on  Education\r\n\r\nand Medical and Health combined will have increased\r\n\r\nby  $50 million on present figures. Expenditure  on\r\n\r\nDefence Services\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis only starting to mount and may reach $18 million\r\n\r\nby  1962.  In  short,  the estimate  of  over  $260\r\n\r\nmillion in l962 is not likely to be very far out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, revenue will have to be\r\n\r\nincreased  by taxation by $50 million in  the  next\r\n\r\nthree  years  if  this gap is to be  closed  and  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial  contribution  made  to  the  cost   of\r\n\r\ndevelopment in addition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this can be done. There is a very\r\n\r\nconsiderable taxation potential as yet untapped  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and which can be tapped without detriment\r\n\r\nto  trade,  on  which our prosperity  depends,  and\r\n\r\nwithout  causing undue hardship to any  section  of\r\n\r\nthe  community.  But it means that  every  possible\r\n\r\nsource  of  revenue will have to be  explored,  and\r\n\r\nthat  the people of Singapore will have to accustom\r\n\r\nthemselves  to a much higher incidence of  taxation\r\n\r\nthan they have hitherto experienced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outlook for the future is therefore somewhat\r\n\r\nbleak.  We  all  wish to increase the  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving  of  the  vast bulk of  the  population  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  to make Singapore an  even  better\r\n\r\nplace  to live in than it is at present. If we  are\r\n\r\ngoing to achieve these objectives, we are all going\r\n\r\nto have to pull in our belts, make sacrifices, work\r\n\r\nharder, save more, invest more in Government loans,\r\n\r\nand  be  prepared  to  pay a  great  deal  more  in\r\n\r\ntaxation than we have ever had to pay before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now, Sir, to the measures of new and\r\n\r\nincreased   taxation  which  it  is proposed   to\r\n\r\nintroduce this year. As I have said, these must  be\r\n\r\nregarded  as  the first instalment of a  three-year\r\n\r\nprogramme which must produce at least $50 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, it is proposed to raise income tax,\r\n\r\nincrease  the customs duty on tobacco,  petrol  and\r\n\r\ncertain   liquors,   impose  an  additional   first\r\n\r\nregistration  fee on all motor cars, increase  fees\r\n\r\non driving licences, increase the duties on cheques\r\n\r\nand   sweepstakes,  and  introduce  provisions  for\r\n\r\ntaxation of luxury goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to income tax, it is proposed to\r\n\r\nreduce   the   personal  allowance   for   resident\r\n\r\nindividuals and Hindu Joint\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFamilies by $500, to make the allowance $2,500  for\r\n\r\na  single  individual and for Hindu Joint Families,\r\n\r\nand  $4,500  for a married individual. It  is  also\r\n\r\nproposed  to  increase the rate on  the  first  two\r\n\r\nslabs  of chargeable income from 3 per cent  and  4\r\n\r\nper cent to 5 per cent, making the first $1,500  of\r\n\r\nchargeable  income  taxable  at  5  per  cent.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  it is proposed to increase the graduated\r\n\r\nrates  of  tax on chargeable incomes in excess  of\r\n\r\n$35,000 progressively to make the maximum rate  40\r\n\r\nper  cent instead of 30 per cent. The new  40  per\r\n\r\ncent   rate  applies  to  chargeable  incomes  over\r\n\r\n$55,000.  The  increased rates will apply  to  all\r\n\r\nresident  persons with the exception of  companies,\r\n\r\ntrustees,  excluding the trustees of  incapacitated\r\n\r\npersons, and executors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to bring these changes into effect\r\n\r\nfrom 1st January, 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I proceed, Sir, to explain Government's\r\n\r\npolicy in relation to these proposals, I would  ask\r\n\r\nhon.  Members  to bear in mind that income  tax  in\r\n\r\nthis country is administered on a pan-Malayan basis\r\n\r\nin  the sense that the Income Tax Ordinance in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  and that in Singapore are identical  in\r\n\r\nall  except minor respects, and that each Ordinance\r\n\r\nmakes  provision, for a single return and a  single\r\n\r\nassessment  in the case of persons having  combined\r\n\r\nincome, i.e., income in both territories. The  need\r\n\r\nfor  uniformity,  in  view of  the  close  economic\r\n\r\nrelations existing between the two territories, was\r\n\r\nrecognised when income tax was introduced in  1947,\r\n\r\nand  was  stressed  repeatedly by  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic,  as  well  as  by official  and  unofficial\r\n\r\nMembers  of  both  Governments.  I  think   it   is\r\n\r\ngenerally  recognised  that the  operation  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  over  the  past  nine  years  has  amply\r\n\r\ndemonstrated   the   wisdom  of   the   pan-Malayan\r\n\r\nconception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposals which I have outlined have been\r\n\r\nfully discussed with the Federation Government, and\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government is today introducing  in\r\n\r\nits   Legislative   Council  precisely   the   same\r\n\r\nproposals to amend its Income Tax Ordinance  as  we\r\n\r\nare here in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are no doubt aware, the tax\r\n\r\nimposed by the Income Tax Ordinance, 1947,  is  the\r\n\r\nonly tax levied on income in Malaya. There are not,\r\n\r\nas  in  a  number  of  other countries,  additional\r\n\r\nlevies of one kind or another described as, or akin\r\n\r\nto,   supertax,  surtax,  surcharge,  profits  tax,\r\n\r\nemergency  tax,  excess profits tax,  non-residents\r\n\r\ntax,  or  any  other levies of a similar  character\r\n\r\nadditional to income tax. Income tax in  Malaya  is\r\n\r\nthe  one comprehensive tax on income and it has  no\r\n\r\nsupplements or appendages. Nowadays, virtually  all\r\n\r\ndeveloping countries include the taxation of income\r\n\r\non  a progressive basis as a major feature of their\r\n\r\nfiscal  policy. By comparison with the  income  tax\r\n\r\nsystems  of other countries, the income tax charged\r\n\r\nin  Malaya  may  be  regarded as a  reasonable  and\r\n\r\nequitable  impost, the rates of tax being generally\r\n\r\nlower, and the scales of relief higher, than  those\r\n\r\nin operation elsewhere. As far as I am aware, in no\r\n\r\nother  country,  the  income tax  system  of  which\r\n\r\nincludes a scheme for personal reliefs, is  such  a\r\n\r\nlow rate as 3 per cent charged at the bottom of the\r\n\r\nscale. For example, the minimum rate of tax in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom at present is 11\u00bc per  cent,  and\r\n\r\nover  the past thirty years the lowest rate of  tax\r\n\r\nin  force in that country was 7\u00bd per cent. The  7\u00bd\r\n\r\nper  cent rate was, in fact, in operation  for  one\r\n\r\nyear  only. To carry the comparison a bit  further,\r\n\r\nthe  personal allowance for a single individual  in\r\n\r\nthe United Kingdom is $1,200. Here in Singapore  it\r\n\r\nis  at present $3,000. A married individual in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom  receives a personal  allowance  of\r\n\r\napproximately $2,000. The personal allowance  to  a\r\n\r\nmarried individual in Malaya is $5,000. It  can  be\r\n\r\nseen,  therefore, that Singapore  has  treated  its\r\n\r\nincome  taxpayers a good deal more generously  than\r\n\r\nhas  been found possible in the United Kingdom, but\r\n\r\nI   do  not  consider  that  the  same  degree   of\r\n\r\ngenerosity can be maintained indefinitely.  On  the\r\n\r\nwhole,  the original scheme of the Malayan  tax  as\r\n\r\ncontained in the 1947 Ordinance has remained stable\r\n\r\nover the past nine years. Apart from changes in the\r\n\r\nrate which have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  the effect of levelling the company rate,  the\r\n\r\nrate  for non-resident individuals, and the maximum\r\n\r\nindividual  rate, at 30 per cent,  almost  all  the\r\n\r\namendments  have  been designed  either  to  remove\r\n\r\nanomalies  or to afford further relief to taxpayers\r\n\r\nin  general. However, faced as it is with an urgent\r\n\r\nneed to find additional revenue to meet the cost of\r\n\r\nsocial  and  other  services provided  or  planned,\r\n\r\nGovernment, after very careful consideration,  and,\r\n\r\nas I have said, in consultation with the Government\r\n\r\nof  the  Federation, has decided that the time  has\r\n\r\ncome  to  legislate for moderate increases  in  the\r\n\r\ngeneral rates of income tax, accompanied by a small\r\n\r\nreduction in the individual personal allowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is generally recognised that the situation\r\n\r\nwhereby  the  burden of income tax  on  individuals\r\n\r\nresiding in Singapore falls on only some 19,000  of\r\n\r\nthe  population  cannot continue  indefinitely.  We\r\n\r\nhave,  therefore,  decided to reduce  the  personal\r\n\r\nallowance  by  $500, that is to say, the  allowance\r\n\r\nfor a single individual will be reduced from $3,000\r\n\r\nto  $2,500 and for a married individual from $5,000\r\n\r\nto  $4,500. The allowances for children will remain\r\n\r\nas  at  present.  A married man with  two  children\r\n\r\nwill,  therefore,  obtain reliefs totalling  $5,750\r\n\r\nplus  relief on any contributions he may make to  a\r\n\r\nprovident fund, and on any life assurance  premiums\r\n\r\nhe  may pay. A married man with nine children  will\r\n\r\nobtain  reliefs totalling $7,650; if he contributes\r\n\r\nto  a provident fund, his reliefs will probably  be\r\n\r\nin excess of $8,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction in the scale of personal reliefs is\r\n\r\naccompanied by the abolition of the 3 per cent  and\r\n\r\n4  per  cent  rates  at the bottom  of  the  scale.\r\n\r\nInstead  of  the first $1,500 of chargeable  income\r\n\r\nbeing charged in three slabs of $500 at 3 per cent,\r\n\r\n4  per  cent and 5 per cent respectively, the whole\r\n\r\n$1,500  will  be  charged at  5  per  cent.  It  is\r\n\r\ndoubtful whether charging tax at such a low rate as\r\n\r\n3  per cent is economically justifiable, and it  is\r\n\r\npossible  that  tax payable at this  level  is  not\r\n\r\nsufficient, considered by itself, to meet the  cost\r\n\r\nof assessing and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncollecting   it.   However,   apart    from    this\r\n\r\nconsideration,  it  is  most  unlikely   that   any\r\n\r\nhardship  will be caused to the taxpayers who  will\r\n\r\nbe subjected to the proposed changes in rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the other end of the scale, it is proposed to\r\n\r\nmake   the  highest  rate  applicable  to  resident\r\n\r\nindividuals  40 per cent on chargeable  incomes  in\r\n\r\nexcess of $55,000 instead of, as at present, 30 per\r\n\r\ncent on chargeable incomes in excess of $50,000.  I\r\n\r\nmight  mention,  in  passing, that  in  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  a  rate  of  42  per  cent  is  levied  on\r\n\r\nchargeable   income  in  excess  of   approximately\r\n\r\n$3,000, and much higher rates still where the total\r\n\r\nincome exceeds $17,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other changes in the rates applicable to the\r\n\r\nlarger chargeable incomes include the insertion  of\r\n\r\na  new  rate of 25 per cent which is applicable  to\r\n\r\nthe  $10,000  slab of chargeable income immediately\r\n\r\nabove  the  $35,000  point.  The  next  $5,000   is\r\n\r\nchargeable  at 30 per cent, and the next succeeding\r\n\r\n$5,000  at 35 per cent. This takes us up to $55,000\r\n\r\nworth of chargeable income, above which point it is\r\n\r\nproposed to levy a rate of 40 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expected yield from these changes is\r\n\r\nestimated at $5 million in 1957, most of which will\r\n\r\ncome from the wealthier taxpayers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contributions made by the new taxpayers, who\r\n\r\nwill  be brought in by the reduction in the  amount\r\n\r\nof  the  personal allowance, will be  comparatively\r\n\r\nsmall.  The maximum amount payable by an individual\r\n\r\nwho  was  not previously liable to income tax,  but\r\n\r\nwho is now made liable by the reduction of $500  in\r\n\r\nthe  personal  allowance,  will  be  $25,  and  the\r\n\r\naverage  amount payable by such an individual  will\r\n\r\nbe  $12.50  or approximately $1 per month.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  the  changes made  will  secure  that\r\n\r\nincome tax is paid by a much larger section of  the\r\n\r\npopulation, all of whom will be perfectly  able  to\r\n\r\npay the small sums involved. The principle on which\r\n\r\nGovernment has worked is to broaden the base of the\r\n\r\ntaxation  pyramid so as to increase the  number  of\r\n\r\nindividuals who are required\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto make some direct contribution, however small, to\r\n\r\nthe  general  revenue of the  country.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nconsidered  view of Government that at present  the\r\n\r\nbase,  comprising as it does some 19,000 taxpayers,\r\n\r\nis  much too narrow. Government's proposal for this\r\n\r\nsmall reduction in the scale of personal reliefs is\r\n\r\nestimated to increase the number of taxpayers quite\r\n\r\nappreciably,  and is linked, as I  have  explained,\r\n\r\nwith the increase in the rate of tax applicable  to\r\n\r\nthe  wealthier  members of the community  up  to  a\r\n\r\nmaximum of 40 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  may  be  interested  to  have  some\r\n\r\nsample  figures to show the impact of  the  revised\r\n\r\nrates  and  personal  reliefs upon  taxpayers  with\r\n\r\nincomes  at varying levels. For example,  a  single\r\n\r\nman  with  an assessable income of $3,500 will  pay\r\n\r\n$50 instead of $15 in tax. If his assessable income\r\n\r\nis  $5,000, he will pay $140 instead of $90. If his\r\n\r\nassessable  income  is $8,000,  he  will  pay  $385\r\n\r\ninstead  of  $320.  If  his  assessable  income  is\r\n\r\n$12,000, he will pay $835 instead of $760.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, a married man without children with an\r\n\r\nassessable  income of $5,000 will pay  $25  in  tax\r\n\r\ninstead  of  nothing. If his assessable  income  is\r\n\r\n$8,000,  he will pay $215 instead of $160.  If  his\r\n\r\nassessable  income  is $12,000  he  will  pay  $595\r\n\r\ninstead of $520.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet again, a married man with two dependent\r\n\r\nchildren  with an assessable income of $8,000  will\r\n\r\npay  $122.50  instead  of $75.  If  his  assessable\r\n\r\nincome  is  $12,000, he will pay  $460  instead  of\r\n\r\n$385. If his assessable income is $30,000, he will\r\n\r\npay $3,495 instead of $3,380.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think these examples will serve to show that\r\n\r\nthe changes proposed are unlikely to cause hardship\r\n\r\nto anybody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single individual with an income of $2,500 a\r\n\r\nyear,  or  a married individual with an  income  of\r\n\r\n$4,500  a year, will not be required to pay  income\r\n\r\ntax  at  all, so that the great majority of  manual\r\n\r\nand  daily-paid  workers are still well  below  the\r\n\r\npoint at which income tax is payable. It must  also\r\n\r\nbe  remembered  that allowances for  children  will\r\n\r\nstill  be  deductable at present rates, i.e.,  $750\r\n\r\nfor the first child,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$500  each for the next two children, and so on  up\r\n\r\nto   a  maximum  of  $3,150,  plus  allowances  for\r\n\r\nprovident  fund  contributions and  life  assurance\r\n\r\npremiums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  may wonder why Government  has  not\r\n\r\nproposed  an increase in the rate of tax applicable\r\n\r\nto companies, having regard to the fact that income\r\n\r\ntax  payable  by companies represents a substantial\r\n\r\nproportion of the total yield. The company rate  of\r\n\r\ntax  is  a  matter  of primary importance  to  most\r\n\r\nforeign   investors   since  large-scale   business\r\n\r\ninvestment  is  usually  carried  out  through  the\r\n\r\nmedium  of limited liability companies rather  than\r\n\r\nthrough  other  forms  of commercial  or  financial\r\n\r\norganisations. The company rate charged  in  Malaya\r\n\r\nhas  been  30  per  cent  since  1951,  and  it  is\r\n\r\nreasonably well in alignment with rates payable  by\r\n\r\ncompanies  in comparable territories abroad.  There\r\n\r\nis,  however, one important difference and that  is\r\n\r\nthe  difference between the company rate of tax  in\r\n\r\nMalaya  and  the rate in the United  Kingdom.  This\r\n\r\ndifference has recently narrowed to 12\u00bd  per  cent,\r\n\r\ni.e.  42\u00bd  per cent less 30 per cent,  and  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  view  it is worthwhile  retaining  an\r\n\r\nappreciable margin between the Malayan company rate\r\n\r\nand that of more highly developed countries such as\r\n\r\nthe United Kingdom. The margin is considered to  be\r\n\r\njustifiable  as  an  inducement  not  only  to  the\r\n\r\ninvestment  of capital in Malaya, but also  to  the\r\n\r\nestablishment of local directorates and managements\r\n\r\nof the enterprises set up. There will, in short, be\r\n\r\na  differential  tax advantage in  incorporating  a\r\n\r\nseparate Malayan company rather than in setting  up\r\n\r\na  Malayan branch or unit of some large concern  in\r\n\r\nthe  investor's country of residence. The advantage\r\n\r\nwill,  of  course, endure only so long as  the  tax\r\n\r\ndifferential  is a sizeable factor. The  effect  of\r\n\r\nthe  tax  inducement in securing local rather  than\r\n\r\noverseas direction and management is important in a\r\n\r\nconsideration    of   industrial    and    business\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  Singapore, particularly  from  the\r\n\r\naspect   of  providing  technical,  executive   and\r\n\r\nadministrative   opportunities  in   industry   for\r\n\r\nMalayans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Government  has,  therefore, in consultation  with\r\n\r\nthe Government of the Federation, decided for these\r\n\r\nreasons  not  to  increase  the  rate  of  tax   on\r\n\r\ncompanies in 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to increase the duty on tobacco\r\n\r\nand cigarettes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, duty on tobacco is a\r\n\r\nmost  important  source of revenue to  the  colony.\r\n\r\nOnly  income  tax  yields more. For the  past  three\r\n\r\nyears, the duty on tobacco has amounted to over  $33\r\n\r\nmillion  a year. Approximately 97 per cent of  this\r\n\r\nrevenue  comes from cigarettes, the great  bulk  of\r\n\r\nwhich pay duty at the preferential rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present time, there is a marked difference\r\n\r\nbetween the rates of duty on tobacco and cigarettes\r\n\r\nin  the  Federation and Singapore.  Originally  the\r\n\r\nrates of duty were the same but since the war,  and\r\n\r\nparticularly  since the outbreak of  he  Emergency,\r\n\r\nthe  need  for  additional revenue has  forced  the\r\n\r\nFederation to increase its rates. Now, there  is  a\r\n\r\nwide  difference  in the rates of  duty,  which  has\r\n\r\npersisted since 1953.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as cigarettes are concerned, the\r\n\r\nFederation rates are $10.50 a pound full and $10  a\r\n\r\npound  preferential, whereas the rates in Singapore\r\n\r\nare   $6.70  a  pound  full  and  $6.20   a   pound\r\n\r\npreferential, a difference of $3.80 a pound in each\r\n\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufactured tobacco (excluding cigars and\r\n\r\ncigarettes) imported in containers of any kind  for\r\n\r\nretail  sale  to the public - in other  words,  pipe\r\n\r\ntobacco - is charged duty at $10.10 a pound full and\r\n\r\n$10  a  pound  preferential in the Federation,  and\r\n\r\n$6.90  a  pound full and $6.70 a pound preferential\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, unmanufactured tobacco - that is, leaf\r\n\r\ntobacco - is charged duty at $7.60 a pound  full  and\r\n\r\n$7.40  a pound preferential in the Federation,  and\r\n\r\nat   $4.40   a  pound  full  and  $4.20   a   pound\r\n\r\npreferential in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Federation, manufactured tobacco imported\r\n\r\nfor  use in the manufacture of cigarettes by power-driven  mechanical means is charged duty  at  $8  a\r\n\r\npound. In Singapore, it is charged\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  the  rate of $2.50 a pound, as is shag  tobacco\r\n\r\nimported from neighbouring territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is desirable that, as far as possible, the\r\n\r\nrates  of  duty  in  Singapore and  the  Federation\r\n\r\nshould  be the same. The only reason why the  rates\r\n\r\nin the two territories are not now the same is that\r\n\r\nthe need for increased revenue has been greater  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation than it has been in Singapore.  Now\r\n\r\nthat  the need for more revenue has become  urgent,\r\n\r\nattention is once more directed to the question  of\r\n\r\nincreasing   the  Singapore  rates  to   Federation\r\n\r\nlevels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There appears to be little reason why the rates\r\n\r\nshould not be the same. By and large, salaries  and\r\n\r\nwages  are  much  the same in the two  territories.\r\n\r\nStandards of living and the cost of living  in  the\r\n\r\ntowns,  where the bulk of imported tobacco  smokers\r\n\r\nlive,  are much the same. Income tax is charged  at\r\n\r\nthe  same rates. The only difference is that, while\r\n\r\nthe inhabitants of Singapore pay customs duties  on\r\n\r\nonly   liquors,   tobacco   and   petroleum,    the\r\n\r\ninhabitants  of the Federation, in  addition  to  a\r\n\r\nmuch higher rate of duty on cigarettes and tobacco,\r\n\r\npay  import  duties  on a wide  range  of  consumer\r\n\r\ngoods. In these circumstances it is hard to see any\r\n\r\nreal  reason why duty on cigarettes and tobacco  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   cannot  be  increased,   without   much\r\n\r\nhardship to the population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not proposed, however, to proceed\r\n\r\nimmediately  to Federation levels of  duty.  It  is\r\n\r\nconsidered  that  an increase of  these  dimensions\r\n\r\nwould  be  too  sudden  and  might  result   in   a\r\n\r\ncontraction in consumption or perhaps a  switch  to\r\n\r\ncheaper  brands.  Instead, it  is  proposed  to  go\r\n\r\napproximately half-way to Federation levels. It  is\r\n\r\nconsidered  that this can be done without  hardship\r\n\r\nto  the  individual smoker, without  any  permanent\r\n\r\neffect  on  consumption, and with little danger  of\r\n\r\nany material switch to cheaper brands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from this morning, therefore, the\r\n\r\nrate of duty on cigarettes has been raised to $8.60\r\n\r\na pound full and $8.10 a pound preferential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This increase means that the duty on packets of\r\n\r\nten cigarettes of the great majority of brands will\r\n\r\nbe increased by slightly under 5 cents and that the\r\n\r\nretail  price  will be increased by  5  cents.  The\r\n\r\nprice of larger packs will, of course, be increased\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This increase in the duty on cigarettes\r\n\r\nnecessitates corresponding increases in other types\r\n\r\nof tobacco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty on pipe tobacco has been increased to\r\n\r\n$8.30  a pound full and $8.10 a pound preferential.\r\n\r\nHere  again, the great bulk of imports pay duty  at\r\n\r\nthe  preferential rate which is now the same as the\r\n\r\npreferential rate for cigarettes. Hitherto  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  the practice to charge a slightly higher duty\r\n\r\non  pipe  tobacco  than  on  cigarettes,  it  being\r\n\r\nconsidered that some allowance should be  made  for\r\n\r\npaper,  cork  and filter tips in cigarettes.  There\r\n\r\nappears,  however,  to be little justification  for\r\n\r\nmaintaining this differential and it has  now  been\r\n\r\nabandoned.  The differential between the  full  and\r\n\r\npreferential  rates must be maintained  because  of\r\n\r\nthe  terms  of the General Agreement on  Trade  and\r\n\r\nTariffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty on leaf tobacco will be increased to\r\n\r\n$6.00  a  pound full and $5.80 a pound preferential\r\n\r\ncompared with the Federation rates of $7.60 a pound\r\n\r\nfull and $7.40 a pound preferential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty on shag tobacco will remain as it is at\r\n\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty on manufactured tobacco imported for the\r\n\r\nmanufacture    of   cigarettes   by    power-driven\r\n\r\nmechanical means has been raised to $4.50 a  pound,\r\n\r\nan increase of $2 a pound. The differential between\r\n\r\nthis  rate  and the preferential rate on cigarettes\r\n\r\nis  $3.60  a pound compared with a differential  of\r\n\r\n$3.70  a  pound previously. In the Federation,  the\r\n\r\nrate of duty is $8 a pound which is only $2 a pound\r\n\r\nless  than  the  preferential duty  on  cigarettes.\r\n\r\nThere   will  doubtless  be  opposition  from   the\r\n\r\nmanufacturers of local cigarettes who  import  this\r\n\r\nfinely  cut  tobacco for the manufacture  of  local\r\n\r\nbrands.  It  is  clear, however, that  the  tobacco\r\n\r\nrevenue  might  be  jeopardised  if  too   wide   a\r\n\r\ndifferential were allowed between the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrates  of  duty on imported cigarettes and imported\r\n\r\nmanufactured tobacco of this type. While Government\r\n\r\nis  anxious to encourage local industry, it  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to  lose any part of the important  tobacco\r\n\r\nrevenue.  It  is  not thought,  however,  that  the\r\n\r\nchanges now proposed will have any material  effect\r\n\r\nor  the  sale  of locally manufactured  cigarettes.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  the  mere fact that duties generally  have\r\n\r\nbeen  raised  to  a higher level, the  differential\r\n\r\nremaining  the  same,  may  tend  to  increase  the\r\n\r\nconsumption of the cheaper local cigarettes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will doubtless be protests against these\r\n\r\nincreases in duty. Although we were criticized last\r\n\r\nyear  for not raising the duty on tobacco, we shall\r\n\r\nno  doubt  be criticized this year for having  done\r\n\r\nso. But these protests and criticisms will not,  in\r\n\r\nmy opinion, be justified. The increases in terms of\r\n\r\ncost per packet of cigarettes are not great and are\r\n\r\nunlikely  to cause any great hardship. If  they  do\r\n\r\ncause  hardship in any particular case, the  remedy\r\n\r\nis  either to cut down consumption or change  to  a\r\n\r\ncheaper brand of cigarettes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that the increases will yield\r\n\r\nabout   $9.5  million  in  1957.  They  have   been\r\n\r\neffective  since midnight last night and  an  order\r\n\r\nunder section 11 of the Customs Ordinance has  been\r\n\r\ngazetted and will be tabled in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed to increase the duty on\r\n\r\npetroleum  by  7 cents, raising the duty  from  the\r\n\r\npresent  level of 73 cents a gallon to 80  cents  a\r\n\r\ngallon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consumption of petroleum has mounted steadily\r\n\r\nthrough the years. In 1952, 20 million gallons were\r\n\r\nreleased for local consumption; in 1953, 21 million\r\n\r\ngallons; in 1954, 23 million gallons; and in  1955,\r\n\r\n26  million  gallons. In 1956, it is expected  that\r\n\r\nreleases  will  amount  to  28.5  million  gallons,\r\n\r\ndespite the increase in duty of 5 cents in November\r\n\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that petrol can take a further\r\n\r\nincrease  in duty without any effect on consumption\r\n\r\nand  it is doubtful if the increase will cause  any\r\n\r\nhardship to any section of the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase will have no effect on public\r\n\r\ntransport, which largely runs on diesel oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that this increase in the rate of\r\n\r\nduty will yield approximately $2 million in 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been decided to increase the duty on\r\n\r\nrum and gin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the rates of duty on other liquors were\r\n\r\nraised  in  November of last year,  no  action  was\r\n\r\ntaken  in respect of rum and gin. There has been  a\r\n\r\ntendency  for the consumption of gin in  particular\r\n\r\nto  decrease  over the previous year  or  two.  The\r\n\r\ntaste  for  gin is fairly specialized. In Singapore\r\n\r\nat  least  it  is  not a potential  substitute  for\r\n\r\nwhisky  or  brandy.  There appeared  to  be  little\r\n\r\ndanger  of any marked switch from whisky or  brandy\r\n\r\nto  gin  as a result of the difference in rates  of\r\n\r\nduty.  On  the  other hand, there  was  a  possible\r\n\r\ndanger - although  not  a  very  grave  one - that   an\r\n\r\nincrease in duty might result in a further decrease\r\n\r\nin consumption of gin. In the circumstances, it was\r\n\r\ndecided not to make any change in the rate of  duty\r\n\r\nat least for the time being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation has now been reviewed in the light\r\n\r\nof  experience over the past year. The  consumption\r\n\r\nof  rum remains unchanged at about 3,000 gallons  a\r\n\r\nyear.  There has been no marked switch from  whisky\r\n\r\nand  brandy to gin. Consumption of gin in 1955  was\r\n\r\nslightly  over  the 17,000-gallon mark.  Statistics\r\n\r\nfor  the  first  nine months of 1956  suggest  that\r\n\r\nconsumption will be slightly over the 18,000-gallon\r\n\r\nmark,  an increase of about 1,000 gallons.  At  the\r\n\r\nsame   time,  further  examination  of  the  matter\r\n\r\nsuggests that consumption of gin has now stabilised\r\n\r\nand  that  any tendency for it to drop,  which  was\r\n\r\nnoticed  immediately after the Korean War boom  and\r\n\r\nwhich  suggested a possible change  in  taste,  has\r\n\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, it is considered desirable\r\n\r\nthat  the  duty on gin and rum, which traditionally\r\n\r\ngo together in the tariff, should be increased from\r\n\r\n$37.50  a gallon to $49.50 a gallon. Prior  to  the\r\n\r\nchanges  in  the  tariff  which  were  effected  in\r\n\r\nNovember  last year, there was a duty  differential\r\n\r\nof $11.50 a gallon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetween  whisky and brandy on the one hand and  gin\r\n\r\nand  rum on the other. The new duty on gin and  rum\r\n\r\nbears  much  the same relationship to  the  present\r\n\r\nduty on whisky and brandy as the old duties bore to\r\n\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of duty on gin and rum in bulk and\r\n\r\nrectified  spirit  which are  also  linked  in  the\r\n\r\ntariff  has  been raised in sympathy  to  $63.50  a\r\n\r\ngallon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been decided to increase the duty on\r\n\r\nsparkling  wines from $40 a gallon full and  $30  a\r\n\r\ngallon preferential to $44 a gallon full and $34  a\r\n\r\ngallon preferential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yield from these increased measures is\r\n\r\nestimated at $220,000 in 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that these increases will cause\r\n\r\nany great hardship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed to impose a tax on motor cars\r\n\r\nin  the  form of an additional initial registration\r\n\r\nfee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  will  recall  that  a  proposal  to\r\n\r\nimpose  a  tax  of this nature was considered  last\r\n\r\nyear  but  was  not proceeded with  because  common\r\n\r\naction  with  the Federation was considered  to  be\r\n\r\ndesirable  and  because  the Federation  Government\r\n\r\ncould  not  at that time see its way  to  impose  a\r\n\r\nsimilar  tax.  Now  I  am happy  to  say  that  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government sees its way clear  to  take\r\n\r\ncommon action with the Singapore Government in this\r\n\r\nmatter  and  is  making a similar  announcement  at\r\n\r\ntoday's Budget meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax proposed is an initial registration fee\r\n\r\nof  10  per  cent of the c.i.f. value of all  motor\r\n\r\ncars  registered  for the first time  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwith effect from today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motor cars are defined in the regulations as\r\n\r\n\"motor  vehicles constructed or adapted  solely  or\r\n\r\nmainly  for  the  carriage of passengers  or  which\r\n\r\nhave,  to  the  rear of the driver's  seat,  roofed\r\n\r\naccommodation  fitted or capable  of  being  fitted\r\n\r\nwith side windows\". In other words, all motor cars,\r\n\r\nas  the  man  in the street understands  the  term,\r\n\r\nestate  cars, station wagons and vans used for  the\r\n\r\ncarriage of passengers, but not motor omnibuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fee will be paid in the same way as the\r\n\r\ninitial registration fee at present paid on cars of\r\n\r\nnon-Commonwealth origin, namely,  at  the  time  of\r\n\r\nfirst registration to the Registrar of Vehicles who\r\n\r\nwill decide, after calling for such evidence as  he\r\n\r\nmay  think necessary, what is the c.i.f. value  of\r\n\r\nany particular car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as cars of non-Commonwealth origin are\r\n\r\nconcerned, the new fee will be in addition  to  the\r\n\r\nfee of 15 per cent already charged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cars which have already paid the fee in the\r\n\r\nFederation will, of course, not have to pay  a  fee\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that the yield from this fee will\r\n\r\nbe of the order of $1.5 million in 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will possibly be complaints about this tax\r\n\r\non  the  grounds  that motor cars are  a  necessary\r\n\r\nmeans of conveyance in Singapore, that many members\r\n\r\nof  the  public, particularly in the  lower  middle\r\n\r\nincome  groups,  rely on motor cars  to  take  them\r\n\r\nabout  their business and to get their children  to\r\n\r\nschool,  and  that  any increase  in  the  purchase\r\n\r\nprice,  even a modest 10 per cent of c.i.f. value,\r\n\r\nwill hit these people hardly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is doubtful if these are valid complaints.\r\n\r\nHowever desirable they may be, motor cars cannot be\r\n\r\ncalled necessities even in Singapore, and it  seems\r\n\r\nreasonable that those who can afford to buy and run\r\n\r\nthem  should  contribute  a  little  more  to   the\r\n\r\nrevenues   of   Singapore   than   they    do    at\r\n\r\npresent - particularly those car owners  who  pay  no\r\n\r\nincome tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, in case it should be thought\r\n\r\nthat  no  steps are taken to ascertain whether  car\r\n\r\nowners are liable to income tax, I should say  that\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar of Vehicles informs the  Comptroller\r\n\r\nof  Income Tax of the name and address of every new\r\n\r\nvehicle  owner  and  the  Comptroller  then   makes\r\n\r\nenquiries about his liability to tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed to increase the fee on\r\n\r\ndriving licenses from $2 a year to $5 a year.  This\r\n\r\nincrease  will  be  applied  to  renewals  and   to\r\n\r\nendorsement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present time, the fee in the Federation is\r\n\r\n$5  and there appears to be no reason why Singapore\r\n\r\nshould not raise her fee to the same level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics for 1955 indicate that over 12,000 new\r\n\r\nlicenses  were  issued and that 60,000 licenses  were\r\n\r\nrenewed  during  the  year.  In  addition,   18,000\r\n\r\nprovisional  license were issued  and  over  13,000\r\n\r\nprovisional  license renewed. On these figures,  it\r\n\r\nwould  appear that, at the end of 1955,  about  one\r\n\r\nperson  in  every  twelve  of  the  population   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  either  had  a driving  license  or  was\r\n\r\ntrying  to  qualify to obtain one.  Quite  clearly,\r\n\r\nonly a percentage of these people are car owners or\r\n\r\npeople  who  are required to drive  a  car  and  it\r\n\r\nappears  that if they can afford to pay  $2  for  a\r\n\r\nlicense,  they  can afford to  pay  $5  as  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will probably be argued in this connection\r\n\r\nthat,  in  the  case of people who are  drivers  by\r\n\r\noccupation,  it is unfair to charge  them  $3  more\r\n\r\nthan  they  pay at present for the license  without\r\n\r\nwhich they cannot pursue their livelihood. But  the\r\n\r\nfact  of  the  matter is that $3 is not  a  serious\r\n\r\nincrease in cost. It amounts to precisely 25  cents\r\n\r\na month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yield from these increases is estimated at\r\n\r\n$300,000 in 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to increase the stamp duty on\r\n\r\ncheques from 5 cents to 10 cents, which is the rate\r\n\r\nin the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the matter was last considered in 1952, it\r\n\r\nwas  argued  that any substantial increase  in  the\r\n\r\nstamp duty on cheques would lead to a reduction  in\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  cheques and inhibit people  who  were\r\n\r\ncontemplating opening bank accounts from doing  so.\r\n\r\nAs  a result, when the Federation Government raised\r\n\r\nthe  rate  from  4  cents to  10  cents,  Singapore\r\n\r\nincreased to 5 cents only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the rate in the Federation\r\n\r\napparently  had  no marked effect  on  the  use  of\r\n\r\ncheques  or  on  the number of bank accounts  which\r\n\r\nwere  subsequently  opened, and  it  is  more  than\r\n\r\ndoubtful  if the increase will have any  effect  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yield in 1957 is estimated at $300,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed, Sir, to increase the tax on\r\n\r\nsweepstakes from 20 per cent to 30 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA  substantial return is obtained from the  tax  on\r\n\r\nsweepstakes each year. For example, the  return  in\r\n\r\n1954 was $2.8 million, in 1955 $2.9 million and, on\r\n\r\nthe  present  basis of taxation,  $2.8  million  is\r\n\r\nexpected  in 1956. These figure indicate  the  very\r\n\r\nconsiderable amounts which are spent by the  public\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  on  this  form  of  gaming.  It  is\r\n\r\nconsidered  that the Government is  entitled  to  a\r\n\r\ngreater  share  of the proceeds and it  is  thought\r\n\r\nthat  the rate of tax can be increased without  any\r\n\r\nappreciable  effect on the amount of money  wagered\r\n\r\nannually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yield in 1957 is estimated at $1.25 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yield from all the measures of new and\r\n\r\nincreased   taxation  which  it  is   proposed   to\r\n\r\nintroduce is estimated at $20 million in 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, Sir, also intends to introduce\r\n\r\nluxury  taxes and a Bill on this subject  has  been\r\n\r\ntabled today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is lengthy and complicated. I hope hon. Members will give it careful study so\r\n\r\nthat  any  anomalies  or  procedural  difficulties,\r\n\r\nwhich   may  have  crept  in  and  which   can   be\r\n\r\neliminated,  can  be removed in  Committee  in  due\r\n\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the Bill aims at imposing a tax based on\r\n\r\nwholesale  price at wholesale level on  any  luxury\r\n\r\ngoods which it may be decided to tax in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the point at which the tax should\r\n\r\nbe imposed has been given much consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The easiest point of imposition would, of course,\r\n\r\nbe  at  import  level. Luxury goods  which  it  was\r\n\r\ndesired to tax would merely be added to the customs\r\n\r\ntariff and the Comptroller of Customs would collect\r\n\r\nthe tax at point and time of import in the same way\r\n\r\nas  he  does  duty  on liquor and  tobacco  at  the\r\n\r\npresent  time. This, however, would  be  a  radical\r\n\r\ndeparture  from past policy which, in the interests\r\n\r\nof  the  free port status of Singapore, has limited\r\n\r\ncustoms duties to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  traditional  revenue  earning  commodities  of\r\n\r\nliquor,  tobacco  and  petroleum.  It  would  be  a\r\n\r\ndeparture  which  might have  consequences  in  the\r\n\r\noutside  world out of all proportion  to  what,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  had taken place. Although it is a step which\r\n\r\nmay  well  come  in the end, it is  one  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment would not wish to take precipitously  or\r\n\r\nwithout the most careful examination and thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most difficult point of imposition would be\r\n\r\nat  retail level. When one considers the number  of\r\n\r\nshopkeepers and small traders of all races who deal\r\n\r\nin  luxury  goods  in Singapore, one  realise  that\r\n\r\nadequate  control of any system of luxury taxes  at\r\n\r\nretail level would be quite impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has therefore been decided, for the time being\r\n\r\nat any rate, that luxury taxes will be collected at\r\n\r\nwholesale level on the basis of wholesale prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orders and regulations prescribing the method of\r\n\r\ncollection of tax and the methods of accounting  to\r\n\r\nbe  used  will  be  issued in  due  course.  It  is\r\n\r\nintended  that the Comptroller of Customs  will  be\r\n\r\nresponsible for the collection of Luxury Tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I foresee that this tax will meet with\r\n\r\nconsiderable  opposition,  particularly  from   the\r\n\r\ntrading  community. They will argue that  Singapore\r\n\r\ndepends   on  trade,  that  trade  is  at   present\r\n\r\ndifficult  enough in all conscience, and that  this\r\n\r\nnew tax will add yet another burden to a load which\r\n\r\nis already reaching unmanageable proportions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should say that the difficulties which this tax\r\n\r\nmay   cause   to  traders,  particularly   entrepot\r\n\r\ntraders,  are  fully  appreciated,  and  everything\r\n\r\npossible  will be done to minimise the difficulties\r\n\r\nand  obstructions  in the way  of  forms,  returns,\r\n\r\ndrawbacks  of  duty  which  may  result  from   the\r\n\r\nimposition of the tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hard fact of the matter, however, is that we\r\n\r\nneed all the revenue we can get if we are going  to\r\n\r\nprovide  the  facilities  which  are  necessary  if\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  not  only to  survive  but  grow  in\r\n\r\nmagnitude  and importance as a world port.  Traders\r\n\r\ncan  regard the extra efforts which they will  have\r\n\r\nto put forth to overcome the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficulties inherent in a system of luxury  taxes,\r\n\r\nas  part  of  their contribution to the  future  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the principle of the tax, the fact of\r\n\r\nthe matter is that vast sums are spent each year in\r\n\r\nSingapore on commodities which can only be regarded\r\n\r\nas  luxuries. One has merely to look at  the  trade\r\n\r\nreturns, at the shop windows, at the population  as\r\n\r\nit   goes  about  its  business  and  pleasure   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, to have this fact confirmed.  If  people\r\n\r\nhave  money to spend on these luxury articles - which\r\n\r\nthey   undoubtedly  have - it  is  only  right   that\r\n\r\nGovernment should have a share of it. Even  if  the\r\n\r\nimposition   of   luxury  taxes   were   to   limit\r\n\r\nconsumption of luxury goods, I should be  perfectly\r\n\r\nhappy since it would mean that the population saved\r\n\r\nmore and had more to invest in the Government loans\r\n\r\nrequired  for the provision of services which  they\r\n\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, Sir, is the taxation programme for 1957. It\r\n\r\ncovers  a  fairly  wide  field  and  will  yield  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial amount. On the other hand, it will  not\r\n\r\nbear hardly on the population as a whole, or on any\r\n\r\nparticular  section  of it. I  hope  that  it  will\r\n\r\ncommend itself to hon.

He is an outstanding administrator  and  an\r\n\r\neconomist  of great renown. The services  which  he\r\n\r\nrendered  to  the  Chief Minister as  his  Economic\r\n\r\nAdviser were of the highest order and his departure\r\n\r\nat this stage of the development of Singapore is  a\r\n\r\nvery  great loss.

Sir, there may  be  protests  from\r\n\r\ncertain bankers that the increased duty will reduce\r\n\r\nthe  number of accounts on their books. I shall not\r\n\r\njoin in such protests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as large companies using a great number of\r\n\r\ncheques are concerned, the increase can scarcely be\r\n\r\nof   much  importance  and  will  be  very   easily\r\n\r\nabsorbed. If the effect of the increased duty  will\r\n\r\nbe  for  small  holders  to reduce  the  number  of\r\n\r\ncheques  issued, then many bankers would thoroughly\r\n\r\nwelcome  such a state of affairs, and the  Treasury\r\n\r\nwould  not suffer much from such reduction. Sir,  I\r\n\r\nsupport the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>Committee</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I will explain why it is so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my experience, it is the poor man, the wage-earner, the worker, who invests more in\r\n\r\nsweepstakes.  Sir,  I have been  a  member  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Turf Club for many, many  years.  It  is\r\n\r\nusually  the  rich man who goes to the  race-course\r\n\r\nfor a cup of tea, takes a stroll and hardly invests\r\n\r\nany  money in the sweepstakes; so he goes back home\r\n\r\nwith  his money. On the other hand, it is the  poor\r\n\r\nman  who  invests in sweepstakes and this increased\r\n\r\nduty is an indirect taxation on him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.40 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must disagree\r\n\r\nwith the Member for Telok Ayer. The hardship on the\r\n\r\npoor man is when he is lured into wasting his money\r\n\r\non  gambling instead of spending it on his  family,\r\n\r\nas  he  should  do. Anything which  we  can  do  to\r\n\r\ndiscourage him from, not \"investing\", but  throwing\r\n\r\naway his money in this foolish way is a removal  of\r\n\r\nhardship  from the poor man; and if this  tax  does\r\n\r\nnot  remove the hardship, at least it will  benefit\r\n\r\nthe exchequer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.41 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI welcome the increase in duty on sweepstakes and I\r\n\r\npersonally   hope   that  this  will   prevent   or\r\n\r\ndiscourage many people from investing in lotteries;\r\n\r\nand  if  government  revenue  should  fall  because\r\n\r\npeople  are  going  to refrain  from  investing  in\r\n\r\nlotteries, I think I will feel all the happier  for\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I want Government to take note of one\r\n\r\npoint,  and  that is, if you increase the  duty  on\r\n\r\nsweepstakes,   does  it  not  then   make   illegal\r\n\r\nlotteries  even more attractive to the man  in  the\r\n\r\nstreet? Will it not divert people who might  gamble\r\n\r\non  the  Turf  Club to other forms of  gambling?
