But we should  take  a\r\n\r\nbroader   perspective.    First,  the   Singapore   dollar   has\r\n\r\ndepreciated  against the US dollar and most European  currencies\r\n\r\nsince  July last year.  On an overall trade-weighted basis,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore dollar has been stable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we are not direct competitors with the ASEAN\r\n\r\neconomies  in  most product categories.  An internal  MAS  study\r\n\r\nshows  that,  for both goods and services, our major competitors\r\n\r\nin  the  region  are the NIEs, and within ASEAN, Malaysia.   The\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollar has not appreciated against the Hong  Kong  or\r\n\r\nTaiwanese currencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, what matters to our export competitiveness is the\r\n\r\nreal  exchange  rate, namely, the nominal rate,  which  is  then\r\n\r\nadjusted for cost or inflation differentials between us and  our\r\n\r\ntrading  partners.   The  sharp  depreciation  of  the  regional\r\n\r\ncurrencies  will  eventually  raise  domestic  prices  in  these\r\n\r\neconomies and erode the initial gains in competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fears that a fall in the Indonesian rupiah will drag the\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollar  down  are at this  stage  hypothetical.   The\r\n\r\nIndonesian  government has not yet decided to set up a  currency\r\n\r\nboard system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore dollar should not be unduly affected by\r\n\r\nmovements in the Indonesian rupiah.  Indonesia's exports do  not\r\n\r\ncompete  with Singapore's exports.  The weight of the rupiah  in\r\n\r\nour  basket is small.  Furthermore, our exchange rate policy  is\r\n\r\nnot  mechanically  driven by the trade weights.   MAS  exercises\r\n\r\njudgment  in managing the exchange rate, and takes into  account\r\n\r\nexceptional market factors.  MAS will maintain confidence in the\r\n\r\nSingapore dollar, by intervening in the foreign exchange  market\r\n\r\nwhere necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister, with the lowering of the currency  rates\r\n\r\nin  our  neighbouring countries, like in Indonesia and Malaysia,\r\n\r\nand therefore they have become more competitive and enjoy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlow  manufacturing  cost,  would the  promotion  of  the  Growth\r\n\r\nTriangle concept be more useful?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, indeed, the\r\n\r\nGrowth  Triangle  concept is useful and the lower  cost  in  the\r\n\r\nneighbouring provinces of Malaysia, Indonesia, Johor  and  Riau,\r\n\r\nshould enable our businesses and companies which have operations\r\n\r\nthere also to benefit from this lower cost.  But, as I explained\r\n\r\nearlier,  it  is  the  real exchange rate which  determines  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness, not the nominal one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain the difference. If we trade with Indonesia\r\n\r\nand  the  rupiah  goes down from 2,500 rupiah to 10,000  rupiah,\r\n\r\nother  things being equal, Indonesian costs have gone down  four\r\n\r\ntimes  and  therefore they are four times more competitive  than\r\n\r\nus.  But other things do not remain equal.  When the rupiah goes\r\n\r\ndown,  imports cost more, people are unable to pay, they agitate\r\n\r\nfor  higher wages, and wages go up, inflation goes up.

In  the  fourth\r\n\r\nquarter  of  1997,  4,278 workers were retrenched,  compared  to\r\n\r\n5,506 during the first three quarters of the year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total employment in Singapore increased by 122,800 in 1997\r\n\r\ncompared  with 102,600 in 1996.  The economy continued to  enjoy\r\n\r\nfull  employment  as reflected in the low unemployment  rate  of\r\n\r\n1.8%  for the whole of 1997. However, the last quarter  of  1997\r\n\r\nsaw  higher  unemployment  rate of 2% reflecting  the  increased\r\n\r\nretrenchments  during  that quarter. Fortunately,  for  most  of\r\n\r\n1997, we experienced strong employment growth and a tight labour\r\n\r\nmarket.  Many  retrenched workers found  alternative  employment\r\n\r\nquickly.   Based  on  CPF's records, 79% of  the  local  workers\r\n\r\nretrenched  during the first three quarters  of  1997  were  re-employed  by  December 1997.  The re-employment rate  for  older\r\n\r\nworkers aged 50 and above was lower at 66%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the workers who were re-employed, the average time\r\n\r\ntaken  to secure new jobs was 1.8 months after being retrenched.\r\n\r\nThere  was  no  significant difference in the average  time  for\r\n\r\nworkers in the various age groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the on-going regional economic crisis and a\r\n\r\nless than vigorous rebound in certain sectors of the electronics\r\n\r\nindustry, we saw more retrenchments since the beginning of  this\r\n\r\nyear.   As  the economy is likely to grow at a slower pace  this\r\n\r\nyear,  we are also expecting more retrenchments for the rest  of\r\n\r\nthe  year.   My  Ministry has therefore  decided  to  set  up  a\r\n\r\nTripartite  Panel  comprising representatives  from  EDB,  NTUC,\r\n\r\nSNEF,  PSB and the Ministry itself to assist retrenched  workers\r\n\r\nseeking  re-employment.

Under any of these\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  the  employer is  required  to  give  notice  of\r\n\r\ntermination or salary in lieu  of notice.  Notice of termination\r\n\r\nis  usually provided in the employment contract.  In the absence\r\n\r\nof  such a provision, the period of notice will be in accordance\r\n\r\nwith the Employment Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where an employee's service is terminated on ground of poor\r\n\r\nwork performance, he will not be given compensation. In the case\r\n\r\nof  an  employee whose service is terminated on  ground  of  ill\r\n\r\nhealth, his employer would usually grant an ex-gratia payment to\r\n\r\nassist him financially. For termination on ground of redundancy,\r\n\r\nan  employee who is covered by the Employment Act is eligible to\r\n\r\nclaim  for retrenchment benefit if he has a minimum of 3  years'\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Act does not stipulate the quantum of\r\n\r\nretrenchment  benefits payable. We have taken this  approach  to\r\n\r\nenable  companies  and the affected employees  to  have  greater\r\n\r\nflexibility  in determining the appropriate amount, taking  into\r\n\r\naccount the financial position of the company. Thus, the quantum\r\n\r\nof  retrenchment benefit payable for a non-unionised employee is\r\n\r\nsubject to negotiation with his employer.  Where a non-unionised\r\n\r\nemployee  is dissatisfied with his compensation, he  can  always\r\n\r\nappeal  to  my  Ministry for assistance.  My  Ministry's  Labour\r\n\r\nRelations Department will, through conciliation, help the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployee to pursue claim for retrenchment payment.   In the case\r\n\r\nof  a unionised employee, the amount of retrenchment benefit  is\r\n\r\ndetermined through collective bargaining between the  union  and\r\n\r\nthe company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prevailing retrenchment benefit payable to affected\r\n\r\nworkers  in  the non-unionised sector varies from  a  few  days'\r\n\r\nsalary  for each year of service to one month's salary for  each\r\n\r\nyear  of service.  In the case of the unionised sector, the norm\r\n\r\nof  retrenchment  benefit payable is two weeks  to  one  month's\r\n\r\nsalary  for each year of service, unless the financial  position\r\n\r\nof the company warrants a lower quantum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, the quantum of retrenchment benefit stipulated\r\n\r\nin  collective agreements is higher compared to the quantum paid\r\n\r\nto  those who are not unionised.  This in itself is an incentive\r\n\r\nfor workers to join trade unions.  It should also be pointed out\r\n\r\nthat  employees  with  less  than 3 years'  service,  while  not\r\n\r\neligible to claim for retrenchment benefit, are in practice also\r\n\r\npaid some form of ex-gratia payment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law already enables a retrenched employee with 3\r\n\r\nyears'  service  to  claim  retrenchment  benefit  and  affected\r\n\r\nworkers are paid such benefit based on the financial position of\r\n\r\nthe company or in accordance with the collective agreements, the\r\n\r\nsuggestion  by  the  Member  for  Hougang  that  employers   pay\r\n\r\nretrenchment  benefit  to  employees with  at  least  10  years'\r\n\r\nservice, is not in the interest of workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, is the Minister of\r\n\r\nState  aware  that  there  are  employees  whose  services   are\r\n\r\nterminated by the employer giving just one month's notice or  in\r\n\r\nlieu  of  notice, paying one month's salary without any  further\r\n\r\ncompensation?

I am referring\r\n\r\nto  termination, not necessarily retrenchment.  The employer may\r\n\r\njust  terminate an employee's services by giving him one month's\r\n\r\nnotice,  or in lieu of notice, paying one month's salary without\r\n\r\nspecifying  any reason.  Is there anything under the  Employment\r\n\r\nAct  which could compel  an employer to specify the reasons  for\r\n\r\ntermination?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Under the law, the employer\r\n\r\nhas to give a notice of termination.

If  it  is  poor conduct or poor performance,  then  the\r\n\r\nemployer  may want to give that reason.  But it depends  on  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances of the case.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> In the case of an employer not stating\r\n\r\nany reason at all, would the employee concerned be able to claim\r\n\r\nany compensation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, there is a termination\r\n\r\nclause.   The  employee can also terminate his services  and  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  need to give a reason.  If he finds another  job,  he\r\n\r\njust says, \"Okay, I want to leave the company.\"  Since there  is\r\n\r\na  termination  clause and the employer wants to  terminate  the\r\n\r\nservices  of his employee, he can also exercise it on  the  same\r\n\r\nbasis.   So it is not necessary for him to give a reason  if  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  want  to, because it is on a reciprocal  basis.   The\r\n\r\nemployee  can also give notice of termination.  If  he  finds  a\r\n\r\nbetter  job, he does not need to give a reason to the  employer.\r\n\r\nLikewise,   it  is  up  to  the  employer.   In  the   case   of\r\n\r\nretrenchment, and that was the Question filed, obviously in  the\r\n\r\ncase of a unionised company, the union would be informed and  it\r\n\r\nwill  then  negotiate  on  the type of retrenchment  benefit  or\r\n\r\npayment  that should be paid, and this is based on the financial\r\n\r\nposition of the company.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Other than these strategic investments,\r\n\r\nthe  rest can be privatised in due course.  However, apart  from\r\n\r\nthe obvious considerations of market conditions, the pricing and\r\n\r\nthe capacity of the market to absorb the divestments,  there are\r\n\r\na  number  of  other considerations in deciding whether  we  can\r\n\r\naccelerate  the  process  of  divestment.   In  particular,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has put in much effort and resources to develop  the\r\n\r\nGLCs,  and we would want to divest them in such a way  that  the\r\n\r\nissue  of  management succession is properly addressed and  that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  either  a  single shareholder  or  a  group  of\r\n\r\nshareholders  with  a  significant stake to  provide  management\r\n\r\ndirection  and  to  grow the company.   This  is  important   as\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  want  the GLC to remain  in  relatively  good\r\n\r\nhands.   Government  has also to be fair to the  other  minority\r\n\r\nshareholders  of the GLC and be mindful that its divestments  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  too  adverse an impact on the future of the  company.\r\n\r\nThis   requirement  will,  however,  slow  down  the  divestment\r\n\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management Buy-Outs (MBOs) are not ruled out as a\r\n\r\ndivestment  method for GLCs where the Government  has  a  direct\r\n\r\nstake.   MBO  is  possible if there is interest  as  well  as  a\r\n\r\nwillingness  to  take  the business risk  on  the  part  of  the\r\n\r\ncompanies' management and agreement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  reasonable terms of sale.

Government   will   continue   to   pursue    its\r\n\r\nprivatisation and divestment programme in an orderly  manner  as\r\n\r\nand when the opportunity presents itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b>Sir, in terms of the Government divestment\r\n\r\nprogramme, does the Government also intend to divest management,\r\n\r\nand  not  merely  corporatisation?

Sometimes, young children were used as runners to\r\n\r\ndistribute such flyers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, what has become \"hot\" are VCDs - video compact\r\n\r\ndiscs.  Uncensored\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVCDs,  including  new releases which are not  yet  available  in\r\n\r\nstores,  are sold at pasar malams, trade fairs and other places.\r\n\r\nA  number of these are obscene.  Most have been smuggled in.  Of\r\n\r\nthe  raids  conducted by the Board of Film  Censors  (BFC)  last\r\n\r\nyear, 20% of the items seized were obscene.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BFC officers report that the illegal profits are very high.\r\n\r\nEven  after BFC raids, the sellers would be back the  next  day,\r\n\r\nselling the same obscene VCDs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current penalties are clearly not of sufficient\r\n\r\ndeterrence.   In this Bill, we are therefore proposing  enhanced\r\n\r\npenalties.   For example, for the first offence,  the  fine  for\r\n\r\ndistributing  obscene films or videos will  be  doubled  from  a\r\n\r\nminimum  of  $1,000  to $2,000 per film, and  the  maximum  from\r\n\r\n$40,000  to  $80,000.  For the possession of obscene  films  and\r\n\r\nvideos,  the  minimum  fine will also be doubled  from  $500  to\r\n\r\n$1,000  per  film,  up  to a maximum of $40,000.   We  are  also\r\n\r\nproposing  that the penalty for exhibiting obscene films  should\r\n\r\nbe  increased  from  a minimum of $1,000 per  film  to  $10,000,\r\n\r\nregardless  of the number of films.  The enhanced penalties  are\r\n\r\naimed  at  those who profit from the distribution  and  sale  of\r\n\r\nobscene videos and VCDs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also proposing some new provisions to further\r\n\r\ncontrol  the  trade in obscene videos.  To deter the  inflow  of\r\n\r\nobscene  videos through custom checkpoints, we propose, for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  offence, a minimum fine of $1,000 per film and/or a  jail\r\n\r\nterm  not  exceeding  one year.   To deter  the  duplication  of\r\n\r\nobscene films/videos, a lump sum minimum fine of $20,000  and/or\r\n\r\njail term not exceeding two years is proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although e-mails have been included under the definition of\r\n\r\nelectronic  transmission, MITA has no intention to intrude  into\r\n\r\nprivate  communications.  The inclusion of e-mails is to  enable\r\n\r\nenforcement  action  to  be taken when individuals  complain  of\r\n\r\nobscene  films  sent  to them via e-mail.   Under  the  proposed\r\n\r\namendments,  electronic  transmission  is  covered   under   the\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"supply\" in both the Films Act and the Undesirable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPublications Act.  Adapted from New Zealand law, it is  intended\r\n\r\nto  cover  the  electronic transmission of films  which  do  not\r\n\r\ninvolve the supply of physical copies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to do this. The market place is changing rapidly.\r\n\r\nIn  the  US, cinema chain operators now transmit newly  released\r\n\r\nmovies  electronically, without the need for film  reels.   Even\r\n\r\nindividuals  can  package films and disseminate  them  over  the\r\n\r\nInternet,  especially when broadband becomes  widely  available.\r\n\r\nOur  focus, however, is on those who try to profit from  selling\r\n\r\npornographic material in Singapore, not individuals  who  chance\r\n\r\nupon such material.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Protection of minors</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our concern is particularly for the young. We should have\r\n\r\nno  sympathy  for  those who use children to distribute  obscene\r\n\r\nvideos  or  VCDs.  Under existing laws, it is hard  to  penalise\r\n\r\noperators who use children in this way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we have specifically inserted a new section 29C\r\n\r\nwhich will allow additional penalties to be imposed on those who\r\n\r\nexploit  children  in  the  making, import  or  distribution  of\r\n\r\nobscene  films.   In  other words, those  who  make,  import  or\r\n\r\ndistribute obscene films commit offences and are liable  to  the\r\n\r\npenalties set out in new section 29.  In addition, if  they  use\r\n\r\nchildren  in  committing the offences, they would be  liable  to\r\n\r\nadditional penalties under the new section 29C.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>New technology</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Films Act was enacted in 1981, 17\r\n\r\nyears  ago, before the advent of new technologies like  CD-ROMs,\r\n\r\nenhanced CDs, VCDs and DVDs.  We are redefining \"films\" to cover\r\n\r\nthese  new technologies.  Under the redefinition, computer  file\r\n\r\nformats  with  extensions like .mpg, .dat,  .avi  and  .mov  are\r\n\r\nconsidered as films because they comprise moving images  similar\r\n\r\nto what is found in a movie or video.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Political films</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 1996, the Government rejected an application from\r\n\r\nthe SDP for a licence to sell party political video-tapes.  The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment rejected the application because political videos are\r\n\r\nan  undesirable medium for political debate in Singapore.  In  a\r\n\r\npolitical  video,  political issues can  be  sensationalised  or\r\n\r\npresented in a manner calculated to evoke emotional rather  than\r\n\r\nrational  reactions.   Videos also do not  allow  for  effective\r\n\r\nrebuttals.   There  is  also a risk that  political  debates  on\r\n\r\nserious matters will be reduced to a contest between advertising\r\n\r\nagencies, as indeed has already happened in some countries.  Our\r\n\r\nintention is to keep political debates in Singapore serious  and\r\n\r\nnot  have  them become like the selling of soap.  The Films  Act\r\n\r\nwill  therefore include a provision to disallow the distribution\r\n\r\nand  exhibition  of  party political films  in  Singapore.   The\r\n\r\npenalty  for those infringing this provision is set at a maximum\r\n\r\nof $100,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restriction pertains only to party political films.\r\n\r\nAlthough  this will affect all political parties,  it  will  not\r\n\r\naffect the freedom of political debate in Singapore.  There  are\r\n\r\nalready  sufficient avenues for political parties to  get  their\r\n\r\nviews, platforms and manifestos across to the public.  Political\r\n\r\nparties can print newspapers, publish books and post webpages on\r\n\r\nthe Internet.  Debates in Parliament are reported over radio, TV\r\n\r\nand  in  the  newspapers.  During general  elections,  political\r\n\r\nparties are also free to hold rallies and dialogue sessions, and\r\n\r\nare  given free broadcasting airtime in proportion to the number\r\n\r\nof candidates they field.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendments to the Films Act\r\n\r\nand  indeed to the Undesirable Publications Act, which  I  spoke\r\n\r\nabout  last  week,  are made in response to rapid  technological\r\n\r\nadvances.   We have to extend our various Acts - the Undesirable\r\n\r\nPublications  Act,  the  Films Act, the Newspaper  and  Printing\r\n\r\nPresses  Act and the Singapore Broadcasting Authority Act  -  to\r\n\r\ncover  the new media forms.  We have decided to take it  Act  by\r\n\r\nAct  and  not go for an omnibus legislation covering the  entire\r\n\r\nmedia  field because the technology is still unfolding  and  the\r\n\r\nproblems cannot all be foreseen.  We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould move step by step, be guided by practical experience  and\r\n\r\nnot be too ambitious in our legislation of new laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to amending the laws, we are also restructuring\r\n\r\nthe  censorship  process in MITA.  From 1st April,  the  current\r\n\r\nBoard  of Film Censors, the Censorship Section and the Licensing\r\n\r\nSection  in MITA HQ will be merged into a new department  called\r\n\r\nthe  Films and Publications Department (FPD).  FPD will offer  a\r\n\r\none-stop  service  for the public for all matters  dealing  with\r\n\r\npublications  and  films.   The Films Act  and  the  Undesirable\r\n\r\nPublications Act will be administered under one roof by the same\r\n\r\ngroup of officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not our object to increase the level of censorship in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   As  I said in the debate on the amendments  to  the\r\n\r\nUndesirable  Publications Act last week,  just  maintaining  the\r\n\r\nexisting level of censorship is difficult enough.  What we  need\r\n\r\nis  a  practical  approach and do only what  is  feasible.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  certain categories of videos like those  intended  for\r\n\r\nchildren or for training of company personnel are now completely\r\n\r\nexempted from censorship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased that attention has been drawn to the\r\n\r\nadvancement  of technology which has made the proliferation  and\r\n\r\ndissemination of obscene and objectionable films easier and more\r\n\r\nextensive.   We are aware of the tremendous impact  that  moving\r\n\r\nimages  have on our impressionable youths.  And that  access  to\r\n\r\nsuch  objectionable  and  obscene materials  has  been  enhanced\r\n\r\nthrough  the  use of new media like CD-ROMs, computer  diskettes\r\n\r\nand  electronic transmissions.  In this light, the  redefinition\r\n\r\nof  \"film\"  in  the Bill serves to ensure that the term  remains\r\n\r\nrelevant today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the numerous seizures of obscene materials by the\r\n\r\npolice  and  the extensive publicity by the media over  how  the\r\n\r\npeddlers of obscene material flagrantly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndistribute  their catalogues, even directly to the mailboxes  of\r\n\r\nresidents  in  the  security  of  their  homes,  show  that  the\r\n\r\ndeterrent  effect,  as  the Minister has explained,  of  current\r\n\r\nmeasures is grossly inadequate.  And it is appropriate to revise\r\n\r\nthe penalties now, last reviewed in 1981.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill also serves to address the cynical attempts\r\n\r\nby  such  peddlers  to  circumvent the enforcement  of  the  law\r\n\r\nthrough  the  exploitation  of minors  in  the  distribution  of\r\n\r\nobscene films.  As such, we are encouraged that section 29C,  as\r\n\r\nthe Minister has explained, puts the onus on the part of persons\r\n\r\nhaving  custody  of the children to be directly accountable  for\r\n\r\ntheir action.  And the use of children as couriers in this trade\r\n\r\nis deplorable and we hope that the authorities can make full use\r\n\r\nof this provision to act against the principals behind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I am supportive of the measures tabled in this\r\n\r\nBill  to tackle obscene films and protect public decency,  there\r\n\r\nmay  appear,  in our haste to stem out such negative  films,  an\r\n\r\nunduly  onerous  provision,  and this  is  with  regard  to  the\r\n\r\nforfeiture  clause  in  section 16 of the  Bill  that  seeks  to\r\n\r\nretain any deposit put up by promoters and distributors of films\r\n\r\nfor classification and censorship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe there is already a fee to be paid for\r\n\r\nsubmitting   films  for  classification.   By   including   this\r\n\r\nforfeiture provision, I wonder whether this would deter real and\r\n\r\ngenuine promoters and artists from wanting to submit artistic or\r\n\r\ncommendable films for classification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that we are actively promoting and marketing\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  a  centre for the arts and to be the  renaissance\r\n\r\ncapital  of Asia via the International Arts and Films  Festival,\r\n\r\nwhich  contributes  both to the development of  the  local  arts\r\n\r\nscene  as well as tourism, there is concern that in our  attempt\r\n\r\nto  eradicate  negative  films, we  may  indirectly  stifle  the\r\n\r\ngenuine  growth of the arts scene in Singapore.  I am  therefore\r\n\r\nof  the  view that this provision should be reassessed, as  they\r\n\r\nappear anathema to our goal of being the regional arts and media\r\n\r\ncentre.  And I submit to the Minister that perhaps an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappeal  process  or  an exemption process for classification  of\r\n\r\nfilms for the films festivals and arts events be provided for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we note that there has been some disquiet over the\r\n\r\nextension  of  the  Films Act to disallow the  distribution  and\r\n\r\nexhibition   of  political  videos.   It  cannot   be   stressed\r\n\r\nsufficiently that the national interest is upheld given that the\r\n\r\napplication  of  the Act across the political spectrum  is  even\r\n\r\nhanded.   By  disallowing the debate on political issues  to  be\r\n\r\nconducted through the medium of videos, both the ruling party as\r\n\r\nwell  as  opposition parties surrender their access to  what  is\r\n\r\neffectively  an  efficient  but  dangerous  means  of   debating\r\n\r\npolitical issues, as there is no room for immediate rebuttal  in\r\n\r\na  partisan video.  The impact of the use of such mass media  by\r\n\r\nspecial  interest groups with agendas inimical to the well-being\r\n\r\nand  stability of society has been thoroughly researched in many\r\n\r\nother  countries.  The speed, the intensity and  the  impression\r\n\r\nthat   can   convey  in  a  15-second  film   tape   cannot   be\r\n\r\nunderestimated.   Similarly, the tremendous damage  to  society,\r\n\r\nbased  on distortion of the truth through sensationalisation  in\r\n\r\nthis 15-second film tape, can undermine years of nation building\r\n\r\nand it would be almost impossible to unravel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a multi-cultural, multi-religious and multi-racial\r\n\r\nsmall  society like ours, the second best solution of a  blanket\r\n\r\nban  across-the-board serves better to secure  the  cohesiveness\r\n\r\nand  stability  of our country than allowing the  free  flow  of\r\n\r\ninformation and views which need not necessarily be conducive to\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while western liberals argue that in a market place of\r\n\r\ninformation,  the good ideas will prevail and will  outlive  the\r\n\r\nbad,  and  that the truth will prevail over time,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nguarantee that this will happen here in Singapore.  We  are  too\r\n\r\nsmall  a  country to risk the consequences that a small partisan\r\n\r\npopulist posture and a medium with so much influence can  do  as\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  afford to make mistakes in the path that our  nation\r\n\r\ntakes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am aware of the concern that the scope for genuine\r\n\r\npolitical debate is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlimited by this measure.  However, I am pleased to note that  in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  there  are clear avenues open  for  such  debate  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  unabated,  as  explained  by  the  Minister.   It   is\r\n\r\nspecified  in  new  section 2(3)(a) of  the  Bill  that  current\r\n\r\naffairs  films are deemed non-political, and that is good  news.\r\n\r\nThis  clarity  is  certainly useful as we  consciously  seek  to\r\n\r\npromote  Singapore as a media hub.  Similarly, while  this  Bill\r\n\r\neffectively  prevents  political advertising,  it  respects  the\r\n\r\nintegrity  of  the  terms of political debate  in  Singapore  by\r\n\r\npreventing  serious discussion from degenerating  into  a  sound\r\n\r\nbyte and a video clip or a contest between advertising agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in our effort to be comprehensive towards the\r\n\r\neradication  of  the  use of such medium  to  conduct  political\r\n\r\ndebate,   there   is  a  grey  area  and  uncertainty   in   the\r\n\r\ninterpretation of the Bill.  New section 2(b)(vi) defines a film\r\n\r\ndirected  towards a political end in Singapore as  one  where  a\r\n\r\ncurrent  policy  of  the  Government  or  an  issue  of   public\r\n\r\ncontroversy  in Singapore is involved.  Sir, on  this  point,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to seek clarification from the Minister as to how the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  this  clause applies to the advertising  and  the\r\n\r\npromotion of Government policies and public education drives  by\r\n\r\nthe  various Ministries.  Furthermore, would there be scope  for\r\n\r\nappeal and exemptions for contributions by interest groups  that\r\n\r\nbehave  in  a responsible manner whose main aim is the education\r\n\r\nand  the promotion of desirable causes, such as the professional\r\n\r\nbodies, Action for AIDS, the AWARE group, among others?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The severity of the present draft could be counter-productive towards the development of a civil society and the\r\n\r\nencouragement of more Singaporeans to participate and contribute\r\n\r\nin  our  nation's  development.  I  would  like  the  Minister's\r\n\r\ncomments on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is also not very clear in the Bill, and this is\r\n\r\nalso  a  matter of concern among some Singaporeans, whether  the\r\n\r\nparty  political broadcast or the air-time given by  TCS  during\r\n\r\nthe election campaign is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naffected by the Bill in question.  For the people who are voting\r\n\r\nand wishing to be informed in a medium accessible to them during\r\n\r\ncampaign time, perhaps a provision could be made in the Bill for\r\n\r\nsuch broadcasts during election campaign to be allowed.  I think\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  is not very clear on this.  Perhaps the Minister  may\r\n\r\nwish to clarify.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I support the Bill and I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister  will  be able to clarify some of the concerns  that  I\r\n\r\nhave raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, this\r\n\r\nBill  to amend the Films Act to address the deficiencies in  the\r\n\r\nlaw  arising from technological developments and advancement has\r\n\r\ntwo  main  focuses:   (1) to prohibit and  deter  the  trade  in\r\n\r\nobscene   film,   and  (2)  to  prohibit  the  import,   making,\r\n\r\ndistribution and exhibition of party political film.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first issue, Sir, on obscene film, I support the\r\n\r\nstand  taken  to  ensure  and preserve  the  high  standards  of\r\n\r\nmorality  and decency.  In this regard, the proposal to increase\r\n\r\nthe  penalties for making such films must be supported.  I  must\r\n\r\ncompliment  the  Minister  for the  tough  stand  taken  against\r\n\r\npersons  who allow children and young persons to be involved  in\r\n\r\nthe  production,  distribution or exhibition of  obscene  films.\r\n\r\nThe  penalties  in  terms of fines and imprisonment  are  indeed\r\n\r\nsevere.   But  they are necessary.  Children and  young  persons\r\n\r\nmust  never be tempted into such undesirable acts.  We have  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to  ensure that children and  young  persons  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are not corrupted by sleaze and obscenity.   We  must\r\n\r\nstrive and continue to make Singapore the best possible place to\r\n\r\nraise our children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the proposal to increase the membership of\r\n\r\nthe  Films  Appeal Committee from nine to 15.   They  are  given\r\n\r\npowers to overturn decisions of public officers of the Board  of\r\n\r\nFilm  Censors.  Their participation marks a step  in  the  right\r\n\r\ndirection  of having more civic participation in the  censorship\r\n\r\nprocess and institutionalising such a process in the legislation\r\n\r\nfor    greater    accountability   and   transparency.     Civic\r\n\r\nparticipation is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnecessary  in order to ensure that public officers, in  carrying\r\n\r\nout  their work, are guided by the relevant social and  cultural\r\n\r\nattitudes of our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second issue: to make it an offence to make,\r\n\r\nreproduce,  distribute and exhibit any party political  film  is\r\n\r\nsomething  different altogether.  In the past,  this  House  has\r\n\r\nseen  many changes and amendments made to various Bills to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage of technological changes.  In this instance,  however,\r\n\r\nit  is  my  view that technology which could have been  used  to\r\n\r\nimprove  communication  between  political  parties  and   their\r\n\r\nelectorate  is somewhat unnecessarily prohibited.   Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave  become  very interested in their politics.  They  want  to\r\n\r\nknow  more  about the issues of the state. Contrary  to  earlier\r\n\r\nperceptions,  Singaporeans  are not  disinterested  or  pathetic\r\n\r\nabout  politics  in  Singapore.  They want  more  communication.\r\n\r\nThey  want to be better informed.  Increasing the means and mode\r\n\r\nof  communication  is one such way.  Films  and  videos  provide\r\n\r\nadditional  and more effective means of communication  and  this\r\n\r\nmust be further encouraged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we do not want is excessive politicking, intruding\r\n\r\ninto  our bedrooms through political broadcasts and advertising.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  do  not  want is wrong information or  misinformation.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  do not want is clandestine making and distribution  of\r\n\r\nfilms which will cause instability, racial disharmony, panic and\r\n\r\nrumour-mongering.  However, Sir, we have existing legislation to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  such abuses.  We have already limited the amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney  that  political  parties spend during  elections  or  for\r\n\r\npolitical  campaigns.  We can limit the time  political  parties\r\n\r\nadvertise  or  even  broadcast on radio or television.   In  any\r\n\r\ncase,  Sir,  we  do  not  have  too  many  competing  radio  and\r\n\r\ntelevision stations to cause these problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also other legal recourse. For those who are\r\n\r\nguilty  of defamation, my suggestion is to sue them.  For  those\r\n\r\nwho are guilty of causing racial disharmony and instability, the\r\n\r\nInternal Security Act and the Maintenance of Religious\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHarmony  Act have adequate provisions to deal with such  issues.\r\n\r\nFor  those who breach ethics of broadcasting and journalism,  we\r\n\r\ncan  bring  them  to task either through a panel  consisting  of\r\n\r\nprofessional media persons or from the Elections Department.  By\r\n\r\nall   means, Sir, we should treat the message and the  messenger\r\n\r\nseverely if this is necessary and appropriate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, Sir, the Bill defines \"party political film\"\r\n\r\nextremely broadly.  A ban would extend to any film made  by  any\r\n\r\nperson, not just by political parties, as long as it is directed\r\n\r\ntowards  any  political  end in Singapore.   This  includes  any\r\n\r\npartisan  or  biased  references  to   Government  policies   or\r\n\r\ncontroversial  public  issues.  The amendment  is  sweeping  and\r\n\r\nvague.  Personally, I do not see a problem if the publication of\r\n\r\nPetir or Hammer be made into a video or compact disk.  Yet  such\r\n\r\na video would be illegal.  In fact, it would take much less than\r\n\r\nthat to run foul of the proposed law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fear for the implication it has on the arts in Singapore.\r\n\r\nOn  literal interpretation, it would seem that even a movie like\r\n\r\n\"12  Storeys\", which was Singapore's proud contribution to  last\r\n\r\nyear's International Films Festival, could get the producers  in\r\n\r\ntrouble.   \"12-Storeys\"  included humorous  and  often  critical\r\n\r\nreferences  to  toilet flushing laws, the  SDU  and  many  other\r\n\r\nGovernment  policies.  With the new law,  it  looks  as  if  the\r\n\r\nproducers and distributors of such creative works could be fined\r\n\r\nor jailed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, I am assured that although the proposed law is\r\n\r\nextremely  sweeping, the Minister will assure  us  that  we  can\r\n\r\ntrust  the  Government  to apply it very selectively,  and  that\r\n\r\nproducers  and distributors like that of \"12 Storeys\"  would  be\r\n\r\nsafe.  But this is not a satisfactory way for the legislature to\r\n\r\ndeal  with such issues.  If we believe in the rule of law,  then\r\n\r\nlaws   that  are  passed  by  this  House  must  be  clear   and\r\n\r\ntransparent.  They must not be so sweeping and vague that in the\r\n\r\nend  it  is  entirely up to the Minister's discretion whether  a\r\n\r\nperson  has  broken the law.  Unfortunately,  this  is  how  the\r\n\r\namendment to the Films Act is written or perceived.  In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfact,   if  the  Bill  is  taken  literally,  even  some  recent\r\n\r\ntelevision commercials produced by the Government could probably\r\n\r\nbe  banned.   For  example,  in 1996, before  the  last  general\r\n\r\nelection,  there  were television commercials  highlighting  the\r\n\r\nrole  of  public  service in keeping Singapore  running.   Since\r\n\r\npublic  service was one anticipated election issue, it could  be\r\n\r\nargued  that this television commercial was \"directed towards  a\r\n\r\npolitical end, and that it contained partisan comments on issues\r\n\r\nof public controversy.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be unfortunate if such videos are stopped\r\n\r\nsimply because of this legislation.  On the other hand, if  such\r\n\r\ncampaigns are going to continue, and I think it should, how  are\r\n\r\nthese videos going to be exempted from the ban?  Therefore,  one\r\n\r\nobjection to this Bill is that it is too broad and vague.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill would deny opposition parties one way to reach out\r\n\r\nto  citizens  and  inform them about their political  platforms.\r\n\r\nAlthough  this  Bill  affects both the PAP  and  the  opposition\r\n\r\nparties  equally,  there is a general perception  that  the  PAP\r\n\r\nalready  has  many ways of reaching the public.  The  television\r\n\r\ncompanies and the Radio Corporation of Singapore are Government-owned.    The   newspapers  maintain  pro-Government   editorial\r\n\r\npolicies.   For opposition parties, video tapes are perhaps  one\r\n\r\ntiny  way to redress this imbalance. To deny them, Sir, of  this\r\n\r\nsmall opportunity, is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, on the second issue, Sir, I appeal to the\r\n\r\nMinister  sincerely to give party political films  a  chance  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I agree to the\r\n\r\nmeasures  on the amendment on the obscene films.  I  think  they\r\n\r\nare  a step in the right direction.  I applaud the Minister  for\r\n\r\nthe  good  and  increased use of citizen panels in judging  what\r\n\r\nfilms  should  be treated as obscene.  Let me then  turn  to  my\r\n\r\npoints  of  concern.   This relates to the fact  that  the  Bill\r\n\r\nintends  to ban advertisements by any political party  or  films\r\n\r\ndirected  towards  political end, such  as  attempts  to  affect\r\n\r\nvoting in an election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am well aware that I am not a politician, nor an\r\n\r\nelected Member of this House.  I speak as a citizen, as a  voter\r\n\r\nand I have been a commentator at the last general elections as a\r\n\r\nmember  of the Roundtable.  As a background to what I am saying,\r\n\r\nSir,  may I briefly refer to the comment by the NCMP in the last\r\n\r\nmeeting  of  the House where he said that one of  the  NMPs  was\r\n\r\ntaking  up cudgels for the Government.  My view in making  these\r\n\r\ncomments is that Nominated Members of Parliament such as  myself\r\n\r\nare  neither for the Government nor against it, neither  pro-PAP\r\n\r\nnor anti-PAP.  We try, at least I try, to look at the merits  of\r\n\r\nwhat  is proposed in a non-partisan way, and today I have  tried\r\n\r\nto  consider the Minister's arguments very seriously.  I do  see\r\n\r\nhis point that there are other avenues of debate available.  But\r\n\r\nmy  conviction is that I must stand against this Bill in respect\r\n\r\nof  the  amendments concerning these prohibitions against  party\r\n\r\npolitical  films,  especially in section 29D  as  proposed.   My\r\n\r\nobjection  is both on principles and on the particulars  of  the\r\n\r\namendments.  Let me turn first to the principles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, free and fair elections should be one of the great\r\n\r\nhallmarks of Singapore's politics.  It is something we  can  and\r\n\r\nshould  be  proud about as much as our GNP per capita or  Changi\r\n\r\nAirport.  Competition between political parties in free and fair\r\n\r\nelections  is  what  validates the  PAP's  continued  return  to\r\n\r\nGovernment.   Because of this, a PAP victory must be  recognised\r\n\r\nnot  only  by those who support the present Government  but  all\r\n\r\nthose  who  have contested or voted in the election.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of  legitimacy.   Conversely,  an  unfair  or   unfree\r\n\r\nelection makes victory hollow.  For free and fair elections, the\r\n\r\nmaximum width for political speech should be allowed.  Political\r\n\r\nfree speech has a value.  It is the way in which good ideas  are\r\n\r\nrecognised and adopted while bad ideas are rejected.  Article 14\r\n\r\nof  our  Constitution recognises this.  It enshrines  that  each\r\n\r\ncitizen  should enjoy freedom of speech.  In practice, I believe\r\n\r\nthis  Government  has  always believed in  rational  and  robust\r\n\r\ndebate.   Yes,  there are recognised limits for statements  that\r\n\r\nwould jeopardise public order, incite racial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhatred,   falsehoods,  or  statements  that  damage   individual\r\n\r\nreputation.   But  these  exceptions  should  be  just  that   - exceptions.   And  that is the first reason I  am  against  this\r\n\r\nBill's ban on party political films.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ban does not restrict itself to films that threaten\r\n\r\nthis sense of public order, racial harmony or other common good.\r\n\r\nIt  is  much  more  broadly stated, too  broadly  stated  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion.  Even an innocuous statement such as, \"Vote for me  and\r\n\r\nI  will  upgrade  housing.\" - this if said by a political  party\r\n\r\nwould  be subject to a ban.  It seems to me that the Bill is  so\r\n\r\nwidely  drawn  that  even the usual party  political  broadcasts\r\n\r\nduring  the  election would be potentially subject to  the  ban.\r\n\r\nThese  are telecasts by TCS.  Of course, broadcasting itself  is\r\n\r\naccepted  under the proposed section 2(2)(b).  But the recording\r\n\r\nof  the broadcast on film, video or other material record  could\r\n\r\nbe  an offence since each party in turn calls for people to vote\r\n\r\nfor  them and it therefore is partisan within the meaning of the\r\n\r\nproposed section 2(2)(a).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have suggested, or may say, that this Bill is fair\r\n\r\nbecause  it  applies to all parties in Singapore, including  the\r\n\r\nparty  in power.  This is an equal law on the face of it -  that\r\n\r\nis true.  However, it has an unequal impact.  The PAP is, to put\r\n\r\nit  mildly, well-known, for what it has done in the past and the\r\n\r\nwork  of  the  current Government.  The Workers' Party  and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  People's  Party  too have  their  representatives  in\r\n\r\nParliament.   But  other political parties are  not  represented\r\n\r\nhere  and  are  less  well-known.  They  cannot  showcase  their\r\n\r\nabilities or, in some cases, their disabilities.  There is  also\r\n\r\nthe consistent public perception that the media in Singapore  is\r\n\r\npro-Government.   Several surveys have  shown  that  the  public\r\n\r\nthinks  this is so.  In this context, this equal law  will  have\r\n\r\nunequal impact.  That is the second reason I stand against  this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But more than its impact on different political parties,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  oppose  this Bill for the effect it  can  have  on  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  Singapore.  I think that as Singapore  enters  the\r\n\r\n21st  century,  we  should strive towards  a  greater  political\r\n\r\nmaturity.  Part of that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaturity  is to increasingly allow people to discern things  for\r\n\r\nthemselves.  To do that, we need a system that allows  ideas  to\r\n\r\nbe  communicated as well as their rebuttals and  their  counter-rebuttals.   By banning this avenue for political  free  speech,\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  moves  in the wrong direction.  It shields  citizens\r\n\r\nlike  children,  rather  than prepares them  to  be  mature  and\r\n\r\ndiscerning.  This Government has been the one that has asked  us\r\n\r\nto  be a thinking nation.  Critical thought should apply to  all\r\n\r\nfields,  including the political choice that  a  citizen  makes.\r\n\r\nThis is the third reason I am against the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these three reasons, rather than passing the Bill as it\r\n\r\nstands, what I believe we should do is to, first, require  party\r\n\r\npolitical  films to observe basic limits, such as the  avoidance\r\n\r\nof  falsehoods,  incitement  against  public  order  and  racial\r\n\r\nharmony,  and  defamatory remarks.  Secondly, we should  control\r\n\r\nthe  broad  parameters of what party political films can  do  by\r\n\r\nfixing  expenses, length, the time they can be  distributed  and\r\n\r\nexhibited and the numbers perhaps that each party can reproduce,\r\n\r\nexhibit  and  distribute.  And thirdly, we should  take  up  the\r\n\r\ncitizen  panels which are used for other films and  establish  a\r\n\r\ncitizens' board which will license the political films.  This is\r\n\r\nwhat  is  done  for  other  films,  including  those  which  are\r\n\r\npotentially  considered  obscene.   Political  films  should  be\r\n\r\ntreated in the same way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are my three points and principles why I am against\r\n\r\nthis Bill, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move now to the particulars, and these relate\r\n\r\ngenerally to the over-wide definitions that trouble me.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in the proposed section 2(2)(b), the use of the word\r\n\r\n\"partisan\".   The  word  \"partisan\" is  defined  by  the  Oxford\r\n\r\nConcise Dictionary as being, \"an adherent of party, cause,  etc,\r\n\r\nespecially   unreasoning  one.\"   I  think  if   there   is   an\r\n\r\n\"unreasoning  one\",  an  unreasonable point  of  view,  that  is\r\n\r\nsomething we can agree on.  But the meaning of \"partisan\" in the\r\n\r\nearlier part is broad enough to encompass sincere and reasonable\r\n\r\nbeliefs, and I think these should be allowed rather than  caught\r\n\r\nin this over-wide definition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the list of examples provided in the Bill,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  proposed section  2(2)(b),  I  believe  these\r\n\r\nexamples  are  over-wide.   Section  2(2)(b)  bans  films   that\r\n\r\nquestion  current Government policy.  This potentially handicaps\r\n\r\nvalid  criticisms,  and  valid  criticism  is  the  way  society\r\n\r\nimproves.   For example, a Talking Point programme  that  covers\r\n\r\npresent review of the financial sector and features interviewees\r\n\r\nwho  support  or  propose more changes could be caught  by  this\r\n\r\nBill.   There is an exception, as other speakers have noted,  of\r\n\r\nreporting of current events in section 2(3).  But, arguably, the\r\n\r\nshow  I have imagined goes beyond this protection.  It does more\r\n\r\nthan report because it provides opinion as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will consider excluding the subclause\r\n\r\nand  permitting films that discuss current policies, or to allow\r\n\r\nfilms  directed primarily at reform of existing laws or policies\r\n\r\nby legal means.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third detail which concerns me is in the proposed\r\n\r\nsection  2(2)(a)  and  (2)(b).  This is  the  use  of  the  word\r\n\r\n\"partly\".  These sub-sections mean that the Bill captures  films\r\n\r\nthat are not only wholly but also partly within the definitions.\r\n\r\nI  would  urge  that  the Bill be narrowed  to  films  that  are\r\n\r\n\"substantially\", rather than \"partly\".  If it  is  not,  a  film\r\n\r\nthat  is almost wholly innocuous may run foul because of a  very\r\n\r\nshort, minor section.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may argue that these over-wide definitions can be left\r\n\r\nto  the  discretion  of the authorities to take  care  of.   And\r\n\r\ntherefore  the  examples that I have given are  moot,  TCS  film\r\n\r\nmakers will be saved.  But I caution against this approach.  One\r\n\r\nfunction  of  the  law  must be to guide  people's  actions  and\r\n\r\nexpectations of future action.  Over-wide definitions fail to do\r\n\r\nthis.   Instead, they create uncertainty.  No one knows  whether\r\n\r\nthey  are  in  the wrong, or even if they are, if they  will  be\r\n\r\nprosecuted.   Giving the authorities excessive  discretion  does\r\n\r\nnot help the situation.  It can lead to perception that our laws\r\n\r\nare  not equal or transparently applied to all.  As compared  to\r\n\r\nthese over-wide definitions that I have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmentioned,  I  think  that the Bill omits mention  of  the  most\r\n\r\nobvious and acceptable limits to party political films or indeed\r\n\r\nany  free political speech in Singapore, that is, the limits  of\r\n\r\ncommon  good  I  have  mentioned,  such  as  incitement  against\r\n\r\npolitical  order and racial harmony.  These should be  put  into\r\n\r\nthe Bill for clarity and completeness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, my view is that our democracy\r\n\r\nthrives  on free and fair elections, that all political  parties\r\n\r\nneed  a chance to reach out to the citizens.  Citizens on  their\r\n\r\npart  need  to hear political parties to decide for  themselves.\r\n\r\nDifferent means of communication are available, of which I agree\r\n\r\nfilm  is just one.  But though it is just one, I urge the  House\r\n\r\nto  consider that with proper licensing and limits, this  avenue\r\n\r\nneed  not  and  should  not be closed.   Public  discussion  and\r\n\r\ndebate,  the ability of politicians to convince and the  ability\r\n\r\nof citizens to discern are things we must all believe in.  It is\r\n\r\nsomething I have always thought this Government has believed in,\r\n\r\nand  has been very successful at doing.  I urge the Minister and\r\n\r\nthis  House  to  apply this approach to party  political  films.\r\n\r\nDon't ban them.  Convince the citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport the Bill.  I believe there is a need for us to plug some\r\n\r\nof  the  loopholes  which have surfaced over the  years  due  to\r\n\r\nchanges  in  technology as well as to strengthen  the  deterrent\r\n\r\neffect  of  the Act through increased penalties.  New provisions\r\n\r\nto  prevent  the use of minors in obscene video trafficking  are\r\n\r\nalso  timely.   I believe these provisions dealing with  obscene\r\n\r\nfilms  and videos need no further discussion, as evident in  the\r\n\r\nstatements made by Members earlier.  However, the Bill also sets\r\n\r\nforth new provisions dealing with political films and videos.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When assessing this part of the Bill, the basic question\r\n\r\nthat  we need to ask is what sort of political life we want  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.   There  are  currently  various  avenues  and  ample\r\n\r\nopportunities for political parties to disseminate  their  ideas\r\n\r\nand  programmes.   Political parties  can  publish  newsletters,\r\n\r\nbooks, and periodicals at any time of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear.   During  election  time,  they  are  given  air  time  to\r\n\r\nbroadcast   their  message  and  programmes  to  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nelectorate.   While  there  are those  who  decry  the  lack  of\r\n\r\nopportunities, I believe political parties do, in fact, have the\r\n\r\nopportunities to provide Singaporeans with detailed and in-depth\r\n\r\ninformation through publications and broadcasts.  So  the  point\r\n\r\nmade  by  the hon. NMP, Mr Simon Tay, of unequal impact may  not\r\n\r\nbear with altogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I do agree that at first sight the restriction on\r\n\r\npolitical videos and films may appear heavy-handed.  However, on\r\n\r\nfurther  reflection, I do believe that Singaporeans would  agree\r\n\r\nthat it is better to put the cap on the genie than to let it out\r\n\r\nof  the  bottle.  Highly visual media such as videos  present  a\r\n\r\ngreater   danger   as   manipulatory   propaganda   tools   than\r\n\r\npublications.   Visuals can have an impact that  far  overshadow\r\n\r\nand even distort the substantive issues or messages raised in  a\r\n\r\ncampaign.  The excesses of American political campaigning made a\r\n\r\nvery big impression on me during my stay in the US.  During  the\r\n\r\npresidential  contest between Michael Dukakis and  George  Bush,\r\n\r\nthe  Republicans  launched  an  advertisement  which  in  effect\r\n\r\nreduced  Dukakis' prison reform programmes to that of  releasing\r\n\r\nunrepentant  and dangerous prisoners.  The famous Willie  Horton\r\n\r\nadvertisement highlighted the case of Willie Horton - a prisoner\r\n\r\nwho  committed a crime shortly after being released on a weekend\r\n\r\nfurlough programme in Massachusetts, which was the home state of\r\n\r\nDukakis.   The  advertisement was aired continuously  throughout\r\n\r\nthe  campaign  and  this led to a significant opinion  shift  to\r\n\r\nGeorge  Bush.   Dukakis' prison programme and  crime  prevention\r\n\r\nrecord  as  a  whole  went largely unexamined  by  the  American\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Willie Horton case illustrates, the use of videos\r\n\r\ncan  lead  to  the  sensationalisation of issues,  reducing  the\r\n\r\ncontest of ideas to a process similar to that of selling soap or\r\n\r\ndetergent.   I  do  not  think  we want  political  contests  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  go down that road.  Yes, we need to  protect  the\r\n\r\nSingapore electorate.  Yes, there will be those who will  argue,\r\n\r\nsuch as Mr Simon Tay, that Singaporeans are smart enough\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  discern the honest leader from the snake oil salesman.   But\r\n\r\ndo  we  really want to take our chances and then have to  repair\r\n\r\nthe  damages?  Even in a mature democracy such as the US,  slick\r\n\r\npolitical  advertising  can mislead  the  electorate.   I  would\r\n\r\nrather   that   we   take  proactive  steps   to   ensure   that\r\n\r\nsensationalism  and  demagogic appeals  have  no  place  in  our\r\n\r\npolitical  process.  At the same time, we must also ensure  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have adequate means of examining political  parties\r\n\r\nand  their  programmes for themselves.  Parties can now  publish\r\n\r\nnewsletters,  books and periodicals to disseminate their  ideas,\r\n\r\nprogrammes  or opinions on current policies.  Parties  can  also\r\n\r\nbroadcast  their  local messages during  election  time.   These\r\n\r\ndissemination  opportunities need to be kept open and  protected\r\n\r\nto  ensure  a healthy contest of ideas.  This amendment  is,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  a  reflection of an ongoing process in our  society.   As\r\n\r\nsociety changes and new technology develops, we would need to re-examine our regulatory framework for political discourse.   This\r\n\r\nre-examination will need to seek the proper balance between  the\r\n\r\nneed  to  provide  political parties  with  the  opportunity  to\r\n\r\ndisseminate the ideas and stimulate political discussion and the\r\n\r\nneed to prevent the McDonaldization of political campaigning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even though I support this amendment, I do have some\r\n\r\nconcerns.   Under the leadership of our Prime Minister,  Mr  Goh\r\n\r\nChok  Tong, we are moving towards a more participatory-style  of\r\n\r\nGovernment.   It  is an attempt to involve more  people  at  all\r\n\r\nlevels  in  order to create a thinking nation.  Given  this  new\r\n\r\nthrust  or  attempt  to  create a more  participatory  political\r\n\r\nculture, we should ensure that any legislation must be clear and\r\n\r\nprecise  in  setting  the  parameters of unacceptable  political\r\n\r\nactivities.   We must ensure that non-partisan groups,  such  as\r\n\r\nthose  raised by Mr Chew Heng Ching, which can make  a  positive\r\n\r\ncontribution to policy-making are not frozen out of the process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulation of political life is not borne out of a\r\n\r\ndesire   to  simply  restrict  political  discussion.    Rather,\r\n\r\nregulations are needed to ensure that the Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelectorate is given a fair and honest chance to examine  parties\r\n\r\nand  their  manifestoes and ideas.  If we allow parties  to  use\r\n\r\nvideos,  we  endanger  what we have achieved  thus  far  in  our\r\n\r\npolitical life.  Do we really want this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say, at the\r\n\r\noutset, that I support the Films (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern technology allows for the production of films which\r\n\r\nis   a   result  of  camera  tricks  and,  worse,  the   digital\r\n\r\nmanipulation  of figures and pictures.  We have seen  the  movie\r\n\r\nForrest  Gump in which the actor Tom Hanks is seen in  the  film\r\n\r\nvery realistically shaking hands with dead Presidents and former\r\n\r\nPresidents  of the USA.  We have seen other examples of  digital\r\n\r\nmanipulation  of  advertisements in  which  a  very  plump  lady\r\n\r\nsuddenly  becomes  very slim.  And I think  we  also  have  seen\r\n\r\nexamples,  even without digital manipulation, of pictures  which\r\n\r\nappear  to  present certain ideas and these ideas obviously  are\r\n\r\nfalse.  It could, for example, make a person look sinister under\r\n\r\ncertain lightings and you could then persuade the audience  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  sinister person and in the political broadcast,  it\r\n\r\nwould be to persuade people not to elect him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore prudent and cautious of us to exclude a\r\n\r\nmedium  like this from the hurly-burly of politics and  that  we\r\n\r\nshould   restrict  political  debate  to  arenas  that  can   be\r\n\r\ncontrolled,  in  the sense that publications and rally  speeches\r\n\r\ncan  be  controlled.   There will always  be  opportunities  for\r\n\r\nrebuttal   and  there  will  be  no  opportunities  for   making\r\n\r\nmanipulated pictures like that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my work as the President of the Consumers' Association\r\n\r\nof  Singapore,  very often we have to deal with  advertisements,\r\n\r\nparticularly TV commercials, which we find objectionable because\r\n\r\nthey  make  certain allusions or present certain pictures  which\r\n\r\nlead the viewer into wrong conclusions.  But very often, when we\r\n\r\napproach  the  Advertising Standards Authority of  Singapore  to\r\n\r\npull off the advertisement, the sale has been clinched\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  it is too late for us to stop it.  We can actually pull off\r\n\r\nthe  advertisement but, as they say, the harm is  already  done.\r\n\r\nSo  I  support this Bill to keep political debate to arenas that\r\n\r\nwe are familiar with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I have some points which I hope the Minister\r\n\r\nwill  clarify.  Firstly, clause 2(b) introduces a new definition\r\n\r\nof  \"electronic  transmission\".   I  see  that  this  definition\r\n\r\nexcludes  \"broadcasting\".   Unlike the Undesirable  Publications\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill passed at the last sitting of this House, there\r\n\r\nis  no definition of \"broadcasting\" here.  In our laws, there is\r\n\r\nthe definition in the Copyright Act and a definition of sorts in\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Broadcasting Authority (SBA) Act.  The  Copyright\r\n\r\nAct definition is slightly archaic as it refers to \"broadcasting\r\n\r\nby  wireless  telegraphy\".  The SBA Act is more  up-to-date.   I\r\n\r\nwould  take  it that the meaning of \"broadcasting\" here  is  the\r\n\r\nsame  as  that in the more modern SBA Act.  Whichever definition\r\n\r\nis  adopted, however, I believe the new Bill does not appear  to\r\n\r\ncover  the  use of telecommunication lines to do a  computerised\r\n\r\n\"broadcast\" to all Internet users, for example, which should  be\r\n\r\nan  act  penalised under this new Bill if the films or  pictures\r\n\r\nsent are obscene or of an unauthorised political nature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, clause 2(f) introduces a definition of \"supply\".\r\n\r\nI  know the Minister has said that it is an adaptation from  the\r\n\r\nNew  Zealand  provision.  With due respect,  Sir,  I  find  this\r\n\r\ndefinition  verbose  and  incomprehensible.   I  would  like  to\r\n\r\ncommend the use of plain English in statutes and hope that  more\r\n\r\ncare will be put into drafting such legal provisions in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, clause 2(d) gives a new definition to \"obscene\".\r\n\r\nI  have  discussed  at  length my views on  \"obscenity\"  in  the\r\n\r\nearlier debate on the Undesirable Publications (Amendment)  Bill\r\n\r\nand  received  an answer from the Minister and  so  I  will  not\r\n\r\nrepeat them here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would turn to clause 2(g). This paragraph inserts\r\n\r\na new subsection (2) to section 2 of the principal Films Act.  A\r\n\r\nfilm  is  directed  to a political end if  it  is,  inter  alia,\r\n\r\n\"intended or likely to affect voting in any election or national\r\n\r\nreferendum\".  I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfear  the  words  are  overly broad.  There  are  all  sorts  of\r\n\r\nelections  in  Singapore, including elections at annual  general\r\n\r\nmeetings  of societies and companies and elections on residents'\r\n\r\nviews  in  relation  to  upgrading  projects  and  perhaps  even\r\n\r\nelections to choose popular TV commercials.  I know the Minister\r\n\r\nprobably  has  in mind Parliamentary and Presidential  elections\r\n\r\nonly   and  would  ask  if  he  could  amend  or  clarify   this\r\n\r\naccordingly.  All the other references to \"any election\" in  the\r\n\r\nnew subsection (2)(b) should also be similarly construed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A film dealing with \"an issue of public controversy\" is\r\n\r\nalso  political  under the amendment Bill.  In  most  instances,\r\n\r\nthis  may be right.  Yet, with utmost respect, Sir, I think  the\r\n\r\nwords  are  again over-broad.  The question whether  cloning  of\r\n\r\nhumans   should  be  made  illegal  is  \"an  issue   of   public\r\n\r\ncontroversy\"; so too is the question whether owners of pets  who\r\n\r\ntake  long  holidays  should  be allowed  to  leave  their  pets\r\n\r\nunattended.  Would films on these topics be political?  I submit\r\n\r\nthat they are not.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Minister may\r\n\r\nwish to clarify this point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, could the Minister also consider amending or\r\n\r\nclarifying the provisions of the new subsection (3) which states\r\n\r\nthat  films  solely for the purpose of reporting current  events\r\n\r\nare  not  political.  I expect this would, of course, cover  the\r\n\r\nbroadcast  and  the  filming  of  election  rallies  and   other\r\n\r\npolitical events as news.  But I would like to argue that  films\r\n\r\n\"discussing\"  current events (and not merely \"reporting\"  them),\r\n\r\nsuch as TV talk shows, or shows which contain obviously unbiased\r\n\r\nmaterial  in an attempt to inform or educate the public  (as  in\r\n\r\nmany documentaries we see), are also not political.  I await the\r\n\r\nMinister's views on these points.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I totally support the banning of obscene films and the levy\r\n\r\nof  harsh penalties on offenders in order to protect our  young.\r\n\r\nI  am  concerned, however, by the aspect of the Bill which seeks\r\n\r\nto define and then prohibit production and dissemination of what\r\n\r\nis called \"party political film\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have several specific concerns. Let me elaborate. My\r\n\r\nfirst  concern  is  about the definition of what  constitutes  a\r\n\r\nparty  political  film.  There seems to be two components.   The\r\n\r\nfirst  is  obvious, a film made by or on behalf of  a  political\r\n\r\nparty or a group advertising its views.  The second component is\r\n\r\nfar  more ambiguous and disturbing to me.  The second definition\r\n\r\nof  a  party political film is if \"it is made by any person  and\r\n\r\ndirected  towards  any  political end in Singapore\".   The  term\r\n\r\n\"directed  towards  any  political end\" is  further  defined  to\r\n\r\ninclude specific examples, most of which relate to elections and\r\n\r\ncan  quite  arguably be considered party politics.   However,  a\r\n\r\nfilm  which \"contains wholly or partly either partisan or biased\r\n\r\nreferences to or comments on any political matter, including but\r\n\r\nnot limited to a current policy of the Government or an issue of\r\n\r\npublic controversy in Singapore\" is defined as \"a film which  is\r\n\r\ndirected towards any political end\" and is therefore prohibited.\r\n\r\nThat, I submit, is far too broad, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is biased and what is not biased? What is a political\r\n\r\nmatter   and  an  unpolitical  matter?   An  issue   of   public\r\n\r\ncontroversy  at one time was the COE policy.  Another  time  was\r\n\r\nthe  levy  on the foreign maids.  Only recently, it was  housing\r\n\r\nprices.   Are these not political matters?  And what  about  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  policy  of the Government?  Can anything  be  more  all\r\n\r\nencompassing than this definition?  The concern of the  drafters\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill  surely cannot be trying to  stifle  films  which\r\n\r\nlegitimately  and  constructively comment on Singapore  society.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the Government actively encourages the development of\r\n\r\na  local  film  industry.   On the one hand,  we  complain  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are politically apathetic and the young people  are\r\n\r\nnot  committed  to this society.  We want to develop  a  vibrant\r\n\r\ncultural  scene  where  Singaporeans  can  develop  art   forms,\r\n\r\nincluding  film, which have contemporary relevance.   But  under\r\n\r\nthis  amendment,  any so-called biased reference  to  a  current\r\n\r\npolicy  of Government or an issue of public controversy will  be\r\n\r\nbanned.   We all know that what constitutes \"right\" or  \"wrong\",\r\n\r\n\"biased\" or \"non-partisan\" can be a less\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan  objective  exercise  or  evaluation,  and  the  evaluation\r\n\r\ndepends on who says it, when and with what intention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is the mechanism of evaluation carried out anyway?\r\n\r\nFrom  what I understand, this Bill does not disallow the  making\r\n\r\nof  a  film by any individual nor does it require any film-maker\r\n\r\nto  submit  a story line and film script prior to production  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry for approval.  Film-makers therefore risked  their\r\n\r\nmoney,  time  and talent on a production which may raise  public\r\n\r\ncontroversy  after  it  was screened.  How  would  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nrespond to this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether a film will raise a political controversy in\r\n\r\nsociety is an uncertain and, often times, unintended outcome  on\r\n\r\nthe part of the producer.  Even if it recognises the possibility\r\n\r\nof  political tensions from such a film, it is more difficult to\r\n\r\nassess  its degree of seriousness to justify its ban.  What  may\r\n\r\nresult is an unhealthy situation of individuals, film producers,\r\n\r\npolitical party members as well as political institutions making\r\n\r\nallegations against one another and defending their positions on\r\n\r\ndifferent reasons.  We do not want to be drawn into this kind of\r\n\r\nunguided judgement battles.  Not that such allegations will  not\r\n\r\nbe  made  under  this  existing Bill,  but  the  amendments  now\r\n\r\nproposed  only  give more room for contentious  interpretations.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  the  offender  is liable  to  a  fine  not  exceeding\r\n\r\n$100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our effort to promote the arts, Sir, the spectre of a\r\n\r\nhefty  fine, due to many \"possible\" wrongful allegations can  be\r\n\r\ndaunting.   I  appreciate  the Government's  need  to  establish\r\n\r\nreasonable   limits  to  self-censorship  within  the   artistic\r\n\r\ncommunity,  but  we  need  to offset  this  against  an  equally\r\n\r\nimportant  need  for Singaporeans to free their imagination  and\r\n\r\nintellect to create without ambiguous restrictions.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  our  top  leaders are  intolerant  or  afraid  of\r\n\r\ncriticisms.   They can hold their own in any debate against  any\r\n\r\nof Singapore's detractors.  That makes me all the more perplexed\r\n\r\nas to why this Bill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneeds  to  have  such  a broad definition  of  \"party  political\r\n\r\nfilms\".   Is  this  not  giving  unnecessary  broad  powers   to\r\n\r\nbureaucrats who will want to err on the side of caution and  end\r\n\r\nup banning any social commentary in our home-made film industry?\r\n\r\nI  am  afraid  the  lack  of clear guidelines  and  definitional\r\n\r\ncriteria  will  paralyze appropriate exercise of  judgment  and,\r\n\r\nworse,  it  cripples creative effort in our  young  and  stifles\r\n\r\nquite   legitimate  and  constructive  commentary  on  Singapore\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has once said, on the\r\n\r\nsubject of financial deregulation, that previously what was  not\r\n\r\nexpressly  permitted was prohibited must now change to  what  is\r\n\r\nnot  expressly  prohibited is permitted.  I  believe  that  what\r\n\r\napplies to the finance industry in Singapore should apply to the\r\n\r\nfilm  industry.  I am afraid the amendments to the Act create  a\r\n\r\nsituation which is what is not expressly prohibited is also  not\r\n\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make a specific proposal that the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  \"party  political film\"  be  more  realistically\r\n\r\ndefined  so  that it can only refer to films made  by  political\r\n\r\nparties  or  groups and on specific issues related to  electoral\r\n\r\nmatters  and  that  broad catch-all reference  such  as  current\r\n\r\npolicies  of  Government  or issues of public  controversies  be\r\n\r\ndeleted.  In any Bill to prohibit an activity, I believe  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  onus  of  the  drafters to be as precise  and  specific  as\r\n\r\npossible  and  not  to cover themselves by including  everything\r\n\r\nunder  the  sun.  It is convenient to do so but  it  would  only\r\n\r\nimpede  the development of an open and civil society.   For  me,\r\n\r\nself-censorship is a necessary civic function  but  it  must  be\r\n\r\nexercised  based  on knowledge and acceptance of  terms  of  the\r\n\r\ncontract, not out of fear and muddled understanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which I feel that the Films Act could also\r\n\r\naddress  is  violence, and the question of harm to children.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to suggest that the Censorship Board  broadens  its\r\n\r\nscope to include the issue of violence in films and to develop a\r\n\r\nclassification   scheme   to  define   \"acceptable\"   and   \"not\r\n\r\nacceptable\"  portrayals  of  violence  on  the  screen.   I   am\r\n\r\nconcerned\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  violent  scenes  have  become  more  graphic  and  brutal.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is inadequate research on the extent to which the\r\n\r\nprevalence of violence depiction desensitizes the public.  There\r\n\r\nis  reasonable  ground  to  fear that  children  are  vulnerable\r\n\r\nvictims  because  they  are immature and more  easily  led  into\r\n\r\ncommitting copycat behaviour of violent portrayals in films.  It\r\n\r\nis  important that this Bill allows the Government to  establish\r\n\r\nclear guidelines to ban obscene films as well as political films\r\n\r\nwhich  have  a negative impact on social cohesion,  but  violent\r\n\r\nfilms  which have no regard for women, children and  the  higher\r\n\r\nideals  of  the human condition must also be regulated,  because\r\n\r\nthey  only  degrade our sense of decency, impoverish  our  moral\r\n\r\nuniverse and fray the social fabric.  This is not a gracious and\r\n\r\ngentle society which we promised for the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will seriously reconsider the\r\n\r\namendments to this Act and if need to, perhaps, in the  interest\r\n\r\nof  the public, subject it to a Select Committee for review  and\r\n\r\nrecommendations, to give Singaporeans an opportunity to question\r\n\r\ntheir own civic identity by airing their views on the limits  of\r\n\r\nState  control  vis-a-vis individual rights and  responsibility.\r\n\r\nThis  may  be  a  significant political  and  social  agenda  on\r\n\r\ncommunity building as we enter the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not support the Bill as it is.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity.  At the outset, I would like to  disclose  my\r\n\r\ninterest.  I am a member of  the Indian PAC which is chaired  by\r\n\r\nMr S. Dhanabalan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill introduces a new area, namely, political\r\n\r\nfilms  which are subject to the purview of this Bill.  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhy the need to have this area legislated.  I share the concerns\r\n\r\nshown  by the other NMPs  and I will not repeat them.  Political\r\n\r\nparties still could hold rallies and speak their mind during the\r\n\r\nelection, and yet they have to be subjected to this law if  they\r\n\r\nwere to produce a film with a political end.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a people and as a government, I think we can take\r\n\r\npride,  and I say this seriously and even the opposition parties\r\n\r\nwill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagree,  that  we  have the most fair elections anywhere  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  Issues are debated openly and the voters have the  right\r\n\r\nto   choose.   I  think  we  should  preserve  this.   In  other\r\n\r\ncountries, violence and money politics take the front stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, under the leadership of the Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nstarted building a participatory democracy.  Civil organisations\r\n\r\nare  growing up.  Even the Straits Times'  Forum page,  compared\r\n\r\nto,  say,  20  years ago, has more serious issues  debated.   On\r\n\r\nSaturday,  the political page Insight deals with current  issues\r\n\r\nin some depth.  It airs the views of the various leaders and the\r\n\r\nman-in-the-street.  There will be criticisms of this  Bill  from\r\n\r\nsome quarters, especially the Western press.  I think there will\r\n\r\nbe  some  criticisms by Singaporeans that this Bill is going  to\r\n\r\nsilence the opposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the definition of \"political end\" cannot be\r\n\r\nexhaustive.  I agree.  But the definition, as it stands, is very\r\n\r\nwide.   I  do not have any notion whether any other country  has\r\n\r\ngot  similar legislation.  And in the absence of other  judicial\r\n\r\nauthorities, our courts would have to evolve our own law and  it\r\n\r\nwill take some time for the law to be settled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the question that has to be asked and answered\r\n\r\nis  this: are we sending the wrong signals to Singaporeans  that\r\n\r\nwe  are  becoming less tolerant of political dissent?   We  have\r\n\r\nseen  a  slow nurturing of civic bodies whose aim is to get  the\r\n\r\ncommunity involved in decision making and to provide a  valuable\r\n\r\nlink  to  the policy makers.  In fact, two of the NMPs  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse have come from this background.  The question that we have\r\n\r\nto  ask is: what would happen if one of the civic bodies were to\r\n\r\nmake a film to educate its members?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, a film which has got a political end is\r\n\r\nsubject to the control of the law, even if only a small part  of\r\n\r\nthe  film  is likely to affect voting in any election.  This  is\r\n\r\nindeed  very restrictive.  Even a civic group which  intends  to\r\n\r\neducate  its members may run foul of the law.  Unlike the  other\r\n\r\nMembers,  I  have  no  contention with the second  part  of  the\r\n\r\ndefinition  which tries to contain partisan or biased  comments.\r\n\r\nI think the judge will be in a position to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other concerns, Mr Speaker, Sir, which I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  highlight  in  the House.  Whilst  the  definition  of\r\n\r\n\"obscene\" is something of a question of judgment value,  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat the officials dealing with the matter would be a little bit\r\n\r\nmore liberal in the definition.  Value judgment and question  of\r\n\r\nmorality  change from society to society and from  age  to  age.\r\n\r\nWhat was decadent sometime ago may not be so now in the light of\r\n\r\nnew attributes.  Although the fine line between what is work  of\r\n\r\nart  and what is yellow culture may be strained,  we should  try\r\n\r\nto be more accommodating.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My other concern is on the Committee of Appeal. The\r\n\r\npresent   members  are  distinguished  people  with  very   rich\r\n\r\nbackgrounds.    We   have  a  young  poet,  banker,   architect,\r\n\r\naccountant and people from the academia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a credit to the Minister that he need not have\r\n\r\namended  this  section.   The Minister could  have  allowed  the\r\n\r\nmembership  to  remain at nine and then reduce the  quorum  from\r\n\r\nfive to three, which is a respectable number in most panels  and\r\n\r\ntribunals.  Even our Court of Appeal has three members.  It just\r\n\r\ngoes  to show that the Minister is sincerely concerned with  the\r\n\r\ndecision-making  process and to make  it  more  transparent.   I\r\n\r\nthink this House should applaud this action by the Minister.   I\r\n\r\nwelcome the increase in the number and I hope the Minister would\r\n\r\ninclude  retired  lawyers, civil servants and community  leaders\r\n\r\nwho  could  provide  valuable  inputs  in  this  decision-making\r\n\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I read yesterday's Straits Times and I appreciate the\r\n\r\narguments and sentiments by Koh Buck Song in the editorial page.\r\n\r\nBut I think the quorum should perhaps be increased from five  to\r\n\r\nseven  for cases which are controversial, but not in all  cases.\r\n\r\nBut  for  cases  which  are of public  interest,  it  should  be\r\n\r\nincreased.   It  should  be  left  to  the  discretion  of   the\r\n\r\nCommittee's Chairman or Vice-Chairman.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another area which I would urge the Minister\r\n\r\nto consider and this is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the appointment of two Vice-Chairmen, instead of the present\r\n\r\npractice of choosing by the members themselves when the Chairman\r\n\r\nor Vice-Chairman is not available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we should institutionalise the Committee of\r\n\r\nAppeal's  work.  In landmark cases, it should give  its  grounds\r\n\r\nwhich  should  be published.  By doing so, the  public  and  the\r\n\r\ntrade would know the view of the Committee of Appeal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also concerned that the fines have been increased\r\n\r\nexcessively.  I support the move to increase the fines  but  not\r\n\r\nin  the way it has been done.  I think we have overdone it.  Let\r\n\r\nme  give the House an example.  Under new section 29(4)(b),  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  fine is $100,000.  We all know that the courts normally\r\n\r\ndo not impose the maximum fine, but they always bear in mind the\r\n\r\nquantum  laid  by Parliament, and in this case, it is  $100,000.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  compare the fine imposed in more serious crimes  under\r\n\r\nthe  Penal Code, this House will realise that the proposed  fine\r\n\r\nis excessive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area I am concerned is the definition of young\r\n\r\npersons, which I do not think any of the Members has raised.  So\r\n\r\nI  will raise it here.  I think we should start a new definition\r\n\r\nof  a young person as anybody who is above the age of 12 instead\r\n\r\nof  14.   Most  secondary students have the mental and  physical\r\n\r\nattributes  which their parents 30 years ago may  not  have.   I\r\n\r\nwonder  why  the  Minister wants to conform to  the  traditional\r\n\r\ndefinitions of young person.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, I must congratulate him for giving the\r\n\r\nprotection to young people.  Under the proposed law, they  would\r\n\r\nnot  be  exploited and abused.  This is to be welcomed.  As  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  pointed out, flyers and all sorts  of  literature\r\n\r\nappear  in letter boxes both in HDB estates and even in  private\r\n\r\nresidential estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another area which I would like the Minister\r\n\r\nto  consider.  Both Tamil and Hindi films seem to have  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal of violence and obscenities, not pictorial obscenities  but\r\n\r\nin the words used.  The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfact that the Indian censors have cleared the film must not lull\r\n\r\nour  Board of Censors.  Some of the words, especially in  Hindi,\r\n\r\nare  indeed  obscene and cannot be mentioned.   Not  related  to\r\n\r\nthis,  but I would like to touch on, is the question whether  we\r\n\r\nwant  our  women to be treated in the fashion that some  of  the\r\n\r\nIndian  films  portray.   Sir, the Indian PAC has  conveyed  its\r\n\r\nviews to the Minister about television programmes but censorship\r\n\r\ndoes  not come under our purview.  I hope the Minister will take\r\n\r\nthis  into consideration.  Whilst SINDA and the Indian community\r\n\r\nare trying hard to uplift the Indian community, the Indian films\r\n\r\nare our biggest drawback.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Simon Tay has mentioned that we are here not to\r\n\r\nsupport the Government or the opposition. We are here, chosen by\r\n\r\nParliament, to give our views independently so that the decision-making process of this Parliament would be easier.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I must first question the sweeping\r\n\r\nstatement of the NMP when he said that Singapore has the fairest\r\n\r\nelection in the world.  I wonder whether he has stood in any  of\r\n\r\nthe  elections in Singapore, especially on the opposition  side.\r\n\r\nStanding  as a bystander and observing from the outside,  surely\r\n\r\nhe  cannot  get  the full picture.  Until he  has  stood  in  an\r\n\r\nelection, he has got no right to make such a sweeping statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot support this Bill because the part on banning\r\n\r\nparty  political films is purely political.  It has got  nothing\r\n\r\nto  do with public good or the public interest.  Its purpose  is\r\n\r\nto  give more advantage to the ruling party at the elections and\r\n\r\nto  ensure that the PAP shall never lose its majority  in  every\r\n\r\nelection.   I  can support the part of the Bill disallowing  the\r\n\r\nexhibition  and trade in obscene films as they tend  to  deprave\r\n\r\nand   corrupt   members   of   the  public,   especially   young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Therefore, banning of obscene films  is  for  the\r\n\r\npublic  good and the public interest is served.  I support  that\r\n\r\npart  of the Bill.  But banning party political films is another\r\n\r\nmatter altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does banning party political films help to promote\r\n\r\npublic  good  or  public interest?  In  fact,  it  is  just  the\r\n\r\nopposite.   The  public,  especially in Singapore,  hardly  know\r\n\r\nanything about the opposition.  They only see and hear and  read\r\n\r\nPAP  news.  Anyone who turns on the news on our local television\r\n\r\ncannot  fail  to  see  and  hear anything  but  PAP  news.   PAP\r\n\r\nMinisters'   and  Members'  public  activities  are  prominently\r\n\r\nbroadcast.   Anyone watching local television would  think  that\r\n\r\nthere are no activities organised by the opposition MPs at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Potong Pasir, I organise between five and seven public\r\n\r\nactivities  every  year.   Our Lantern Festival  attracts  about\r\n\r\n1,000  participants  every year.  As for the  Kite  Flying  Day,\r\n\r\nthere  are usually about 200 to 250 persons who come to join  in\r\n\r\nthis   very  delightful  activity.   None  of  these  activities\r\n\r\norganised  at   Potong Pasir over the last 12  years  have  been\r\n\r\nreported  in the local press or over television.  Now there  are\r\n\r\nnew  technologies like the videos and the CD-ROMs which can give\r\n\r\na  chance  for  the  opposition to make known  their  views  and\r\n\r\nactivities,  but  the Government, with this Bill,  is  quick  to\r\n\r\nclamp  down on the use of this new technology by the opposition.\r\n\r\nAny  progressive Singaporean would welcome all new  technologies\r\n\r\nand make use of them to the fullest advantage.  But in Singapore\r\n\r\nthe  situation is different.  New technologies are only good  if\r\n\r\nthey are to advance the cause of the PAP and not the opposition.\r\n\r\nThis  message is loud and clear with the implementation of  this\r\n\r\nBill  when it becomes law.  There is no half measure as  far  as\r\n\r\nthe  Government is concerned.  They want to make sure  that  the\r\n\r\nopposition is completely deprived of new technologies to advance\r\n\r\ntheir cause.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The punishment meted out for disobeying the law is a very\r\n\r\nheavy   penalty  of  a  fine  not  exceeding  $100,000   or   to\r\n\r\nimprisonment  for  a  term  not  exceeding  two   years.    This\r\n\r\npunishment  is  even more onerous than the ones  meted  out  for\r\n\r\nfirst  time  aggravated offence in connection with  dealings  in\r\n\r\nobscene  films  where children and young persons  are  involved.\r\n\r\nFor  the  first timers of aggravated offences involving children\r\n\r\nand  young persons, the upper limit of the fine is only $80,000,\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  maximum prison sentence is 12 months.  As compared  to  the\r\n\r\nfirst  time offenders in relation to party political films,  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  fine is $100,000.  As I said, the maximum jail  is  two\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is in fact no need to impose such heavy fines and\r\n\r\njail  sentences for offenders of party political films.  A  fine\r\n\r\nof $2,000 or a jail sentence of six months would suffice.  Since\r\n\r\nthe whole matter is political, the intention of this part of the\r\n\r\nBill is for the Government to neutralise the opposition parties.\r\n\r\nThis  can be achieved by stopping opposition members from taking\r\n\r\npart  in  elections  by fining them just a mere  $2,000  or  six\r\n\r\nmonths' jail, if they are caught involved in dealing with  party\r\n\r\npolitical films.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Singapore Constitution, once a person is fined\r\n\r\n$2,000  or jailed six months, he is banned from taking  part  in\r\n\r\nany  parliamentary elections for a period of five years.   So  a\r\n\r\nfine of $2,000 or a jail of six months is a sufficient deterrent\r\n\r\nin  regard to party political films.  The present punishment  is\r\n\r\nout of proportion and is really uncalled for.  These heavy fines\r\n\r\nand  jail sentences only indicate that the ruling party  suffers\r\n\r\nreal weaknesses. They think that if the opposition have a chance\r\n\r\nto  use  party political films they can win even more  seats  in\r\n\r\nParliament  or even topple the PAP if such new technologies  can\r\n\r\nbe  exploited  by the opposition to the fullest.   That  is  why\r\n\r\ndraconian  punishments are meted out to completely  deprive  the\r\n\r\nopposition of using new technologies to advance their cause.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the use of new technologies by the opposition something\r\n\r\nbad?   I  do not think so.  I can think of at least five reasons\r\n\r\nwhy  party  political  films should be  allowed.   Firstly,  the\r\n\r\npublic  will have the advantage of more than one point of  view.\r\n\r\nEvery  day, for 365 days a year, and year after year,  from  one\r\n\r\ngeneral   election   to   the  next  and   continued   non-stop,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are bombarded with PAP news.  It is high time  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  opened up and allowed more than  one  point  of\r\n\r\nview.   Singaporeans should be given an opportunity to hear  not\r\n\r\none or two points of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nviews,  but  a  diversity of views.  I believe Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nintelligent  and  mature  enough  to  know  what  is  good   for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  They are discerning people and can accept the  point\r\n\r\nof view that is best for Singapore and for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said that with party political films, the\r\n\r\nopposition  can  give wrong information or  misinformation.   If\r\n\r\nthey  really  do that, they will in fact be shooting  their  own\r\n\r\nfeet  with  a  gun.  Because if they are found out, their  whole\r\n\r\ncredibility will go and they will never get elected again.  So I\r\n\r\ndo  not think that they will dare to be so irresponsible.  There\r\n\r\nshould  be  no fear of allowing Singaporeans to watch  and  hear\r\n\r\nparty  political films.  If Singaporeans are forced to hear  and\r\n\r\naccept  only  one  point of view, very soon an absolute  tyranny\r\n\r\nwill  develop  in  Singapore.  Further, the PAP  is  not  always\r\n\r\nright.  The stop-at-two policy is a glaring example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is a shame if new technologies cannot be used\r\n\r\nto  the fullest.  Singapore encourages its people to be creative\r\n\r\nand  innovative.    It would appear that the mood  now  is  that\r\n\r\nshould  any  more new technologies be invented, they  cannot  be\r\n\r\nused  by the opposition to their advantage, but only by the PAP.\r\n\r\nThis  kind  of  values  promulgated by  the  PAP  is  definitely\r\n\r\nretrogressive and unfair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill only retards the growth of creativity and\r\n\r\ninnovativeness.   Politics is not something dirty  like  obscene\r\n\r\nfilms,  and Singapore should be given a free rein to indulge  in\r\n\r\npolitics using new technologies.  The Government should have  no\r\n\r\nfear  because the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act  and  the\r\n\r\ndefamatory  and  sedition laws are still all in  place  and  the\r\n\r\nInternal Security Act has not yet been abolished.  The only harm\r\n\r\nthat  can  be  done by the opposition or Singaporeans  generally\r\n\r\nusing  party political films is to the PAP and not to Singapore.\r\n\r\nI  hasten  to  say  that  the  PAP is  not  Singapore.   If  the\r\n\r\nopposition is given a climate whereby they can grow and  attract\r\n\r\ngood  men,  in time they too can be just as good as  the  ruling\r\n\r\nparty.   But with this kind of a Bill that is before us, such  a\r\n\r\nclimate I speak of shall never come about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason why party political films should be\r\n\r\nallowed  is  because there are vast numbers of Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nshall  oppose  this Bill.  There are already two opposition-held\r\n\r\nconstituencies  at Hougang and Potong Pasir.   The  majority  of\r\n\r\npeople at these two constituencies shall surely oppose this Bill\r\n\r\nsince they have already voted for the opposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many of the constituencies that were contested, the\r\n\r\nvotes polled by the opposition were over 40%.  Generally, we can\r\n\r\nsafely  say  that  about 40% of the voters  in  Singapore  would\r\n\r\ndefinitely  oppose  the banning of party political  films  since\r\n\r\nthey are not against the opposition. In the results at the first\r\n\r\npoll  for  the Elected President, there were about  40%  of  the\r\n\r\nvoters  who did not vote for the Government candidate.  I  would\r\n\r\nthink  that  they too would be against this move  to  ban  party\r\n\r\npolitical  films.  Indeed, if those parts of the Bill concerning\r\n\r\nbanning party political films were to be put to a referendum, my\r\n\r\nview is that the Government may just not get what it wants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth reason why party political films should not be\r\n\r\nbanned is because the Government is setting double standards  by\r\n\r\nimplementing this Bill.  The Government, under the  new  section\r\n\r\n2(3), is allowed to broadcast party political films through  the\r\n\r\nmass  media  because  the purpose of which  is  purportedly  the\r\n\r\nreporting of current events.  Therefore, at election time, under\r\n\r\nthis  section,  the  Government can report  all  their  members'\r\n\r\nelection  speeches  and election activities  through  the  local\r\n\r\ntelevision  and  radio as current events.   At  the  same  time,\r\n\r\nopposition  members  shall not benefit from such  wide  coverage\r\n\r\nunless,  of  course, the news are bad about the opposition.   By\r\n\r\nthis  Bill, the playing field is further tilted to the advantage\r\n\r\nof the PAP in coming elections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth reason for not allowing the banning of party\r\n\r\npolitical  films  is  that  it is one more  step  to  discourage\r\n\r\npolitical  awareness among Singaporeans.  The Bill also  further\r\n\r\ngives  an  impression  to  our young  citizens  that  discussing\r\n\r\nopposition politics is something to be avoided because  normally\r\n\r\na government would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly  ban something which is bad for the people.  And by banning\r\n\r\nparty  political films which is really aimed at the  opposition,\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore will also have the impression that films\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  opposition must be bad.  They are  to  be  lumped\r\n\r\ntogether with obscene films.  Obscene films are actually  worlds\r\n\r\napart  from party political films.  Yet they are lumped together\r\n\r\nin this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly object to the passing of this Bill banning party\r\n\r\npolitical  films.   On record, by the votes  cast  at  the  last\r\n\r\ngeneral elections, there are almost 50% of those who voted shall\r\r\n\r\nbe  against this Bill as it stands.  On this line, I  would  say\r\n\r\nthat  there are very good grounds to send this Bill to a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee and I call upon the Minister to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could I have a\r\n\r\nclarification from Mr Chiam?  He said that one has to stand  for\r\n\r\nelection to know whether the elections are fair.  I think he  is\r\n\r\nwrong.   In fact, the public of Singapore, the 3 million people,\r\n\r\nknow what is a fair election.  Is he saying to the House that he\r\n\r\ncame to this House by unfair election?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am sorry that the NMP has to ask me\r\n\r\nto  clarify.

Then  he will know the difficulties  as  regards\r\n\r\nelection  rallies, putting up election posters, party  broadcast\r\n\r\ntime, and as regards the Police who are always about.  There are\r\n\r\nmany things that he does not know and I think it is best for him\r\n\r\nto  stand in an election.  Then let him say whether we have  the\r\n\r\nmost fair elections in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nFilms (Amendment) Bill clearly provides for anyone who produces,\r\n\r\ndistributes or exhibits any party political film to be fined  up\r\n\r\nto  $100,000  or  imprisoned for as  long  as  two  years.   The\r\n\r\nSingapore Democratic Party (SDP) once produced a video film  but\r\n\r\nit was banned from distribution by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill further deprives the Opposition of the right to\r\n\r\nmake  use of other media to reach out to the people in order  to\r\n\r\nexpress their views on the nation, society and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment.  However, the Bill also provides that films covering\r\n\r\ncurrent  affairs shall not fall under the category of  political\r\n\r\nfilms.   Then,  the  People's Action Party  (PAP)  will  not  be\r\n\r\naffected,  because the PAP can make use of the  current  affairs\r\n\r\nprogrammes  on  the  television channels to send  their  signals\r\n\r\neffectively  to  the people at any time.   The real  purpose  of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  is not just to prevent the opposition from producing\r\n\r\nand distributing films or video which are not in the interest of\r\n\r\nthe  PAP, but more importantly, it is designed to block out  the\r\n\r\nunfavourable comment on the PAP  by any foreign media.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, the real question is whether this Amendment Bill\r\n\r\ncovers  also the TV broadcast relayed by Singapore Cable  Vision\r\n\r\n(SCV).   We all know that SCV will eventually reach out to  each\r\n\r\nand every household in Singapore.  SCV relays TV programmes from\r\n\r\nother  countries.  Some of these may contain the views of people\r\n\r\nfrom other countries on Singapore, particularly some comments on\r\n\r\npolicy matters, or on the way in which the PAP rules Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP introduces this Amendment Bill just as the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore are beginning to avail themselves of some different\r\n\r\nviews  and  comments from SCV.  In clause 2 of  this  Bill,  the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  political  films is very  wide.  Any  film  that\r\n\r\ntouches on any of the Government's policy, controversial issues,\r\n\r\nor  comments on any political matters shall be deemed  to  be  a\r\n\r\nparty  political film.  In future, if SCV is to telecast any  of\r\n\r\nthese  films, or any programme containing unfavourable  comments\r\n\r\nor criticism on the PAP, will it then be committing an offence?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been telling the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nthat our information is open.  Our people can tune in to foreign\r\n\r\nTV  programmes through SCV.  However, after this Bill is passed,\r\n\r\nif  SCV  is to telecast any programme that contains unfavourable\r\n\r\ncomments on the PAP which are considered to be  biased, and  the\r\n\r\nofficer-in-charge is accordingly found to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  guilty  of an offence,  then is this what the PAP Government\r\n\r\nmean by saying our information is open?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my concern, of course, is\r\n\r\nwith that part of the Bill that seeks to shut out any film of  a\r\n\r\npolitical  activity in Singapore.  I have no  quarrel  with  the\r\n\r\namendments proposed to punish exhibitors of pornographic  films,\r\n\r\nand particularly child pornography.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder, Mr Speaker, Sir, how many people outside this\r\n\r\nHouse  were  aware,  before  the  House  sat  today,  that  this\r\n\r\nGovernment intends to categorise a political activity, and  that\r\n\r\nis, making a film on political issues, and thereby educating our\r\n\r\ncitizens into greater awareness, with obscenity and lewdness.  I\r\n\r\nfind  this totally inexplicable, that the Government should  try\r\n\r\nand  lump a particular form of political activity with obscenity\r\n\r\nand  lewd films.  And that is made clear, if you look at one  of\r\n\r\nthese clauses, that is, clause 11, which seeks to amend  section\r\n\r\n35(1)  of  the Films Act.  And the amendment is that instead  of\r\n\r\nthe  word  \"lewd\", you insert \"a party political  film\".   So  a\r\n\r\nparty  political  film would appear to be in the  minds  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to be the same as  a lewd film.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not propose to repeat what has been\r\n\r\nsaid  before.  I am not going to go over the definitions in this\r\n\r\nBill.   To  me,  it  is  not  just a question  of  amending  the\r\n\r\ndefinitions  and curtailing the impact of this total  ban  on  a\r\n\r\nform  of  political activity in Singapore.  The whole  thing  is\r\n\r\ntotally  unnecessary,  with or without any  amendment,  and  any\r\n\r\namendment is not going to make it any better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister, in introducing the Bill and in attempting to\r\n\r\njustify  the  ban, says a video-tape which contains issues  that\r\n\r\nconcern  Singaporeans may be emotional and perhaps move them  to\r\n\r\naction.  What the Minister forgets, and the PAP forgets, is that\r\n\r\npolitics  is an emotional matter.  People are moved by political\r\n\r\ndecisions  that are made by the Government.  They do not  remain\r\n\r\ncold  and impassive to a decision made by the Government.   Some\r\n\r\nare moved very deeply by a decision of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government.   Is that wrong?  Is that to  be  dismissed  as\r\n\r\nsimply  that  they are emotional?  So I cannot  understand  this\r\n\r\njustification  that  a videotape which tries  to  bring  to  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  any issues that concern them, and politics  is  simply\r\n\r\nnothing  but discussion of issues that concern the people,  that\r\n\r\nit  is emotional.  Politics concerns the body politic. It covers\r\n\r\neveryone.  So if there is any issue that concerns them, then  it\r\n\r\nis politics.  And so I cannot accept the attempt made to justify\r\n\r\nthe ban on the ground that people may be moved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, what is forgotten is that our citizens have to be\r\n\r\neducated  on  issues, and a videotape or a film is  perhaps  the\r\n\r\nmost  effective way to educate our citizens on political issues.\r\n\r\nIt  is  quite  clear  that our Government in  Singapore  has  no\r\n\r\nintention  and has no wish to educate our citizens  politically.\r\n\r\nAll  they  are  concerned with is to drive home to our  citizens\r\n\r\ntheir message, their goals, regardless of whether it is good for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans or not.  And as a result of all these, for the last\r\n\r\n30  years,  this drone of Government propaganda is  churned  out\r\n\r\nover  the  TV every night, churned out over the radio,  and  our\r\n\r\npeople have become resigned, as the former Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nof  this  Government  said,  to hearing  nothing  else  but  PAP\r\n\r\npropaganda, and they are unable to make any judgement on whether\r\n\r\nwhat  the  PAP  proposes is good for the society or  not.   That\r\n\r\nclearly is what the PAP wants.  There is no question about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second justification made by the Minister is that there\r\n\r\nis  already an arena for serious political discussion.  I really\r\n\r\nwonder  whether the Minister has thought about what he is saying\r\n\r\nthat  there  are enough opportunities provided in Singapore  for\r\n\r\npolitical  discussion.  The PAP's record,  ever  since  it  took\r\n\r\npower  in  1959,  is one to stamp out political  discussion,  to\r\n\r\nstamp  out  any  raising of issues by people who feel  concerned\r\n\r\nabout what is happening in the society.  Why has this Government\r\n\r\ncontinued  and  strengthened  the  Internal  Security  Act  when\r\n\r\npreviously there was an appeal to an independent board from  any\r\n\r\ndetention?  This Government took away that appeal and so it  has\r\n\r\na very effective\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntool in silencing any discussion on politics in Singapore.  As I\r\n\r\nsaid,  the  record of this Government is one of  deliberate  and\r\n\r\nsystematic suppression of any political debate or discussion  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politics has become a dirty word in Singapore, and we see\r\n\r\nit  here, it is to be lumped with obscenity.  That is the  place\r\n\r\nfor  politics  in Singapore, not anywhere else.  After  the  PAP\r\n\r\ntook  power  in  1959,  they began a deliberate  and  systematic\r\n\r\nsuppression  of the institutions in Singapore that  may  provide\r\n\r\nopportunities  for political discussion and debate.   I  do  not\r\n\r\npropose to dwell at length on this track record of the PAP.  But\r\n\r\nI  wish to highlight to Singaporeans the principal ways in which\r\n\r\nthey  went  about  this.  The trade unions  were  brought  under\r\n\r\ncontrol.  Trade unions were not allowed to express any views  on\r\n\r\nissues  that  concerned the people at large.   The  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement was put under a man of their own party who was  brought\r\n\r\nout  from Malaysia to lead the trade union movement.  And  after\r\n\r\nhim,  the trade union movement has been put into the care  of  a\r\n\r\nCabinet  Minister.   So what freedom was there  left  for  trade\r\n\r\nunions  to  express  their  views on matters  that  concern  the\r\n\r\nsociety?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was the press. At one time, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  was  some  freedom  in the  press.   It  tried  to  be  a\r\n\r\nresponsible  press.  I recall that, before the  1959  elections,\r\n\r\nwhen the then Secretary-General of the People's Action Party was\r\n\r\nthreatening  fire  and  thunder against  the  press  because  he\r\n\r\nthought  they would be advocating wrong ideas, they  sent  their\r\n\r\nrepresentative  to  Helsinki to protest against  this  intention\r\n\r\nannounced  by  the Secretary-General.  But after  the  PAP  took\r\n\r\nover, by a number of manoeuvres, the press have now become  mere\r\n\r\npropaganda  agents for the Government.  What real  opportunities\r\n\r\nare  there  for  serious  political  issues  to  be  debated  or\r\n\r\nadvocated  through  the press?   We have in  the  Party  sent  a\r\n\r\nnumber of press releases, I have written a number of letters and\r\n\r\na  substantial number of them never see the light of day.  It is\r\n\r\nprobably because they all have got to be cleared first.  So  the\r\n\r\npress  have  ceased to play any part in providing  a  forum  for\r\n\r\npolitical discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the clamp down on professional and religious\r\n\r\norganisations.   One by one the professional bodies  were  told,\r\n\r\n\"You  are  not  to  concern yourself with any  issues  that  may\r\n\r\nconcern  Singaporeans.   You are only to concern  yourself  with\r\n\r\nmatters  that affect your members.\"  And so the Legal Profession\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Act was passed which forbade the Law  Society  from\r\n\r\ncommenting  on  any Bill that was to be presented to  Parliament\r\n\r\nunless  the Bill had first been sent to them for their comments.\r\n\r\nAnd  then  there  were the religious bodies.  Now  we  have  the\r\n\r\nMaintenance of Religious Harmony Act and under which any  cleric\r\n\r\ncan  lose  his licence if he dares to comment on any issue  that\r\n\r\nmay  concern  the Government.  It is again based on the  fallacy\r\n\r\nthat  religion  and  politics  are two  distinct  and  different\r\n\r\nthings,  forgetting that religion has to do with  the  citizen's\r\n\r\nviews  and  attitudes to the society around him.  That  is  what\r\n\r\npolitics  is  all  about.  So you cannot divorce  religion  from\r\n\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was the onslaught against the opposition\r\n\r\npolitical parties.  It is very difficult for anyone who has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  in  any  opposition  party to know  the  difficulties  and\r\n\r\nproblems that are put in the way of opposition parties.  We  are\r\n\r\nnot  allowed any public meetings other than the meetings perhaps\r\n\r\non National Day or Labour Day.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

What I am\r\n\r\nattempting  to  say is that this amendment drives  another  nail\r\n\r\ninto the coffin, an attempt to kill all political activities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  That is what I am attempting to say here,  that  one\r\n\r\nby  one,  all  political  activities are  being  killed  off  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   And it may not be very long before we have  another\r\n\r\nBill presented to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis House which will perhaps even prohibit the publication by a\r\n\r\npolitical  party  of  any newspaper or journal  because  it  may\r\n\r\ncontain  issues concerning the people which might  arouse  their\r\n\r\nemotions.   I can see that coming with this Bill that  seeks  to\r\n\r\nban films put out by a political party to educate the people  on\r\n\r\nany issues in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speakers who spoke after the Minister also made a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  assumptions which I do question.  As  Mr  Chiam  has\r\n\r\nalready  pointed  out, an assumption is made that  elections  in\r\n\r\nSingapore are free and fair.  Knowing how elections are held  in\r\n\r\nother  countries and how elections are held in Singapore, may  I\r\n\r\nsay that elections in Singapore are not free and fair.  They are\r\n\r\nanything but free and fair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again the assumption made by a number of speakers,\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  other areas for serious  discussion.   But  no\r\n\r\nattempt  is  made  to  try and define where these  areas  exist.\r\n\r\nThere are no areas for public discussion of issues in Singapore.\r\n\r\nHas  the  PAP  made  any attempt to call  a  public  meeting  of\r\n\r\ncitizens  to  discuss any policy or Bill that  they  propose  to\r\n\r\nbring  into  Parliament?  Have we heard of any such  meeting  or\r\n\r\nread  of  any such meeting?  This Bill and the way it  has  been\r\n\r\nintroduced  demonstrates  that only  too  clearly.   This  is  a\r\n\r\nmomentous decision, to stop one form of political activity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, you are engaging in\r\n\r\ntedious  repetition.

What I will say\r\n\r\nto  the Government is this.  Why do we not be honest?  Why  does\r\n\r\nthe  Government, the PAP, not say that our brand of democracy  - because  that  is  what  it has often said  -  that  Singapore's\r\n\r\ndemocracy  is something quite different.  Our brand of democracy\r\n\r\nwill  not  permit opposition political parties  to  put  forward\r\n\r\ntheir  views,  unless the views conform to what we say  are  the\r\n\r\nstated goals and objectives.  Then at least one can say that the\r\n\r\nGovernment is being honest about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, a lot of Singapore is pure pretense,\r\n\r\npretense that we have got\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  pretense that people are allowed free discussion  on\r\n\r\nmatters  that concern them, pretense that we have a  responsible\r\n\r\npress, pretense that we have a responsible trade union movement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment Bill seeks only to strengthen the PAP's hold\r\n\r\non  Singapore,  and that clearly seems to be the object  despite\r\n\r\nall  the high-sounding words that have been said to justify  the\r\n\r\namendment to ban all party political films.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is our brand\r\n\r\nof  democracy that has enabled the NCMP to be here in this House\r\n\r\nto  speak on this Bill.

I  have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt that all those who spoke spent a lot of time checking  the\r\n\r\nBill,  the  original Act, looking for inconsistencies,  checking\r\n\r\ndefinitions  in  the Bill with definitions in  other  Acts.   It\r\n\r\nshows how important this Act is to us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I touch on the rather controversial amendment on\r\n\r\nparty  political films, let me first clarify some of  the  other\r\n\r\nissues  which were raised.  By and large, Members supported  the\r\n\r\nother  amendments, but there were some questions raised which  I\r\n\r\nfeel I ought to respond to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching asked whether the threat to forfeit all\r\n\r\nor  part of the deposit might somehow inhibit the growth of  the\r\n\r\nfilm industry.  Not at all.  The purpose is a practical one.  It\r\n\r\nis in response to a practical problem.  Ever since we introduced\r\n\r\nR(A) rating in our cinemas, we have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequired  cinema operators to check the ICs of young people  who\r\n\r\nbuy  tickets  to ensure that they are above 21 before  they  can\r\n\r\nwatch R(A) rated movies.  Sometimes they have been lax and young\r\n\r\npeople  have gotten in.  So this is to ensure that they  can  be\r\n\r\nfined,  that a penalty can be imposed upon them when  they  have\r\n\r\nnot  kept  to  the  conditions  of  their  licence.   It  is  an\r\n\r\nadministrative thing, a provision which we have not had  in  the\r\n\r\npast.  The  only recourse we had in the past was between  giving\r\n\r\nthem  a  warning and withdrawing their licence, and we  felt  we\r\n\r\nneeded something in between.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of MPs asked whether the proposed changes would\r\n\r\nsomehow  stifle  the  arts or stifle  the  growth  of  the  film\r\n\r\nindustry.  Not at all.  In fact, what we have tried to do is  to\r\n\r\nclarify  a  particular area about which I will talk  in  greater\r\n\r\ndetail later.  But our objective remains the same, which  is  to\r\n\r\npromote the arts and to promote the film industry.  In fact,  it\r\n\r\nis  the plan of the Ministry of Information and the Arts to form\r\n\r\na  Films Commission under the National Arts Council specifically\r\n\r\nto  help promote the growth and prosperity of the film industry.\r\n\r\nFilms like Twelve Storeys  will not be affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same process of consultation between BFC and the trade\r\n\r\nwill continue.  If you are not sure whether a film will infringe\r\n\r\ncensorship guidelines, you can consult the censors.   They  will\r\n\r\ngive  you  advice.   They will say, \"These are  the  benchmarks.\r\n\r\nThese are the things we have allowed in the past.  These are the\r\n\r\nthings we have disallowed.  So please adjust accordingly.\"   And\r\n\r\nwe also have a system for classification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether films to educate members of the public produced by\r\n\r\nMinistries will be affected, no.  It is clear in the  Bill  that\r\n\r\nGovernment films are exempted from the provisions of the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh See Kiat asked some questions about definitions.\r\n\r\n\"Election\" is separately defined in the beginning of the Bill to\r\n\r\nmake  it  clear that it does not refer to elections for  private\r\n\r\nclubs or whatever.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of \"broadcasting\" is the dictionary\r\n\r\ndefinition, which is if you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbroadcast  programmes, television or radio, by  wireless  or  by\r\n\r\ncable.  It is a simple definition.  It suits our purpose.  There\r\n\r\nis  no  need  to  define it at this point in time more  clearly.\r\n\r\nInternet   broadcast  will  be  covered  under   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nBroadcasting Act. These are some of the clarifications  which  I\r\n\r\nowe Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to talk about the special amendment to ban\r\n\r\nparty political films.  In 1996, around March, Dr Chee Soon Juan\r\n\r\nof  the SDP wrote to BFC to ask whether he required a licence to\r\n\r\ndistribute political videos. BFC said yes.  Then he submitted an\r\n\r\napplication.  This is the first time anything of this  sort  had\r\n\r\nhappened in Singapore.  For those Members who talked about  this\r\n\r\nrestriction  somehow  affecting  fair  and  free  elections   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we have had free and fair elections all these  years\r\n\r\nin  the  pre-video  age.  I do not think with  or  without  this\r\n\r\nprovision,  it  will affect substantially the way elections  are\r\n\r\nconducted in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman of the Board of Film Censors, sensing that\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  new area, referred the matter to the  Ministry  and\r\n\r\nasked  for policy guidance.  There were two approaches we  could\r\n\r\nhave  taken.  We could have allowed political films.  If we  had\r\n\r\nallowed  party  political films for the SDP, then naturally  the\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Party  and the PAP would all have  jumped  in.   Right\r\n\r\nthrough  the  nine-day campaign period, we  would  all  be  busy\r\n\r\nputting on make-up, combing our hair, dressing up, appearing  in\r\n\r\npolitical videos and distributing them to Singaporeans in  order\r\n\r\nto  win  votes.  Or we could say, do we want everybody  to  jump\r\n\r\ninto this new medium?  The question we have to ask ourselves is:\r\n\r\nwill  this new medium improve democracy in Singapore or  degrade\r\n\r\nit?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of having a debate in this House is that\r\n\r\nthere is an immediate encounter.  A point is raised, a point  is\r\n\r\nrebutted.   Views are immediately clarified.  The  media  is  up\r\n\r\nthere to report on everything that is happening.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do a political video, we worry about sound bites. We\r\n\r\nwatch the tone of our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvoice.    We   smarten  ourselves  up.   We   distribute.    You\r\n\r\ndistribute.  To whom?  I do not know.  We distribute.  To  whom?\r\n\r\nYou  do  not  know.   After  a while,  members  of  the  public,\r\n\r\nreceiving  all these versions, will develop a very cynical  view\r\n\r\nof  who  we are.  We are not film stars.  We are not TCS  stars.\r\n\r\nWe  are  here  elected  by the people of  Singapore  to  discuss\r\n\r\nserious  matters.  And when we have a debate,  let  us  have  an\r\n\r\nencounter, a meeting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you object about something written about you in the\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  you  write  in  to  rebut.   You  write   something\r\n\r\nscurrilous  or libelous in a political newspaper,  the  offended\r\n\r\nparty can require you to clarify, if a case can be put up to the\r\n\r\njudges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On television, do we really want political parties to have\r\n\r\nthe right to buy commercials?  You know how expensive TV airtime\r\n\r\nis.   In  America, before you think about running for elections,\r\n\r\nyou  first  ask  yourself, \"Can I raise  the  money?\"   And  the\r\n\r\nfinancial hurdle is enormous.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a small city state. Even if there were a massive\r\n\r\npower failure and there is no television and the telephone lines\r\n\r\nare  dead, within a few hours, from one end of the island to the\r\n\r\nother,   from  Changi  to  Tuas,  the  grapevine  will  operate.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are not ignorant.  How could we be where we are now\r\n\r\nas  a  major financial trading centre in the world if we are  an\r\n\r\nignorant  people,  if  we  are as suppressed  the  way  Mr  J  B\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam would have us believe?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if we allow this medium, what happens? We will all\r\n\r\nbecome  entrepreneurial.  There will be any number of PR men  in\r\n\r\nSingapore or foreign consultants offering their services to  us.\r\n\r\nYou  know, in America, it is an industry and they are very  good\r\n\r\nat  it.  It is an art form.  They will teach us all kinds of new\r\n\r\ntricks, how we should sit down, how we should look when  the  TV\r\n\r\ncamera  pans  at us, how many seconds of sound bites  we  should\r\n\r\nplan  for,  what  kind  of particular  spin  to  give  to  every\r\n\r\npolitical ball that we kick.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not good for the political process in Singapore. We\r\n\r\nwill reduce it to the selling of detergent.  Every evening, when\r\n\r\nwe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwatch the television, toothpaste, detergents, soaps, hamburgers,\r\n\r\nany number of reasons attractively put across.  With ditties our\r\n\r\nchildren are able to reproduce with accuracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the quality of our democracy in Singapore is reduced to\r\n\r\nthat, our democracy would be debased.  That was the question  we\r\n\r\nhad  to ask ourselves: should we or should we not encourage this\r\n\r\nmedium in Singapore for political debate?  If we do, then all of\r\n\r\nus are in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay talked about unequal impact. If we are in, I\r\n\r\nthink  the  PAP would not necessarily be disadvantaged,  because\r\n\r\nyou will need money, and because of our wide base of support  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, we are likely to be able to raise more money than the\r\n\r\nopposition can.  But to its credit since 1959, the PAP has never\r\n\r\nused  the financial hurdle to keep out the opposition from  this\r\n\r\nHouse.   Till today, does it cost a lot for Mr Chiam and Mr  Low\r\n\r\nThia Khiang?  Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam has a different problem because\r\n\r\nhe  skirts  on the margin of libel and so gets caught  out  from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time. But did it cost Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\nSee  Tong a lot of money to get voted in?  Did they have  to  be\r\n\r\nbusinessmen?   Did they have to be independently  wealthy?   You\r\n\r\ncan  get in today on a shoe-string if you can win the hearts and\r\n\r\nthe  minds  of  the people of Singapore.  And that  is  what  it\r\n\r\nshould  continue to be.  Do not make it show business.  Keep  it\r\n\r\nto  an encounter of ideas so that Singaporeans will decide  whom\r\n\r\nto  vote for, whom to represent them in this House on the  basis\r\n\r\nof ideas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was a very serious matter, I put it up to the\r\n\r\nCabinet.   We had a discussion in the Cabinet.  Then my Ministry\r\n\r\nissued a policy instruction to BFC to say, \"Look, we should  not\r\n\r\nallow  the making and distribution of political films.\"  So  the\r\n\r\nSDP's  application was turned down. That was in July  1996.   At\r\n\r\nthat  time, we had three SDP Members in this House.   We  had  a\r\n\r\nMember  from  the Workers' Party.  Did anyone of  them  raise  a\r\n\r\nsingle question and cause the matter to be debated?  Not a word.\r\n\r\nIf it was such an important matter, so crucial to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noutcome  of the election, all of them would have jumped  up  and\r\n\r\ndown.  Did they?  The records speak for themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could have gotten by, I could have gotten by, without\r\n\r\ntabling  this  Amendment Bill because, under the existing  Films\r\n\r\nAct, we are able to ban political videos, and that's that.   But\r\n\r\nwhy  then did we decide to enact this amendment?  In order  that\r\n\r\nwe  have this debate in the House today.  Because it is such  an\r\n\r\nimportant matter, and is a matter which will recur, it  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant for the public mind that we know what the issues  are,\r\n\r\nand if Singaporeans are excluded from using film as a medium for\r\n\r\npolitical  debate, they know why.  I was under no pressure  from\r\n\r\nthe  opposition, or from anybody for that matter, to enact  this\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked, \"If politics, why not race or\r\n\r\nreligion?\"  In fact, the Films Act does not explicitly state the\r\n\r\ngrounds  on which films can be censored.  We inherited this  Act\r\n\r\nfrom  the  British.  It is left open so that internal guidelines\r\n\r\nwould  build  up  over  a  period of time.   For  obscenity  and\r\n\r\nviolence,  detailed guidelines have been drawn up  and  this  is\r\n\r\nalso  my  answer to the NMP, Claire Chiang.  If a film is  made,\r\n\r\nwhich  inflames public emotions, let us say, the  Indian  Army's\r\n\r\nstorming of the Golden Temple in Amritsar, we will have to  look\r\n\r\nat  it very carefully.  If it is inflammatory or incendiary,  we\r\n\r\nwould have stopped it.  That's that.  This is because the public\r\n\r\ninterest  requires it.  But in this particular case, because  it\r\n\r\naffects  the  evolution of political debate  and  discussion  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, we thought it better to have a full airing so that we\r\n\r\nall  know  why we are doing this. It is not because we have  to,\r\n\r\nnot because we are under pressure to, but because it is good for\r\n\r\nthe development of our democracy in  Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Singapore's own democracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Yes, which allow Mr J. B.\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam to now make this interruption.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Singapore's own brand of democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Every society treats film as a\r\n\r\nspecial  category, because it has a mass impact which books  and\r\n\r\nother  forms of broadcast do not have.  For television,  we  are\r\n\r\nwatching different channels.  We watch desultorily.  I may be in\r\n\r\nthe  toilet, I may come back with popcorn.  There is no  focused\r\n\r\nattention.   For books, we read different books.  For  Internet,\r\n\r\nthere are millions of web pages.  But when you gather a group of\r\n\r\npeople together in a theatrette or an amphitheatre and watch the\r\n\r\nsame  drama,  by words, pictures, music, sound,  you  can  bring\r\n\r\neveryone to laughter and tears into their eyes or you can arouse\r\n\r\nin them deep hatred and a desire for revenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communists and the fascists work this into an art. In\r\n\r\nChina  today, the whole of China, in a year they show 200 films.\r\n\r\nThey  treat  the cinema hall as they do the television  station.\r\n\r\nEvery  year,  we  show over a thousand films in  Singapore.   We\r\n\r\nconsider  them  mostly entertainment.  But in the  wrong  hands,\r\n\r\nfilms  can  have a powerful impact.  It is for this reason  that\r\n\r\nover  a period of time, in  all societies special laws have been\r\n\r\nenacted  to  govern the making, distribution and  production  of\r\n\r\nfilms.   This  is  why  this  Act is different  from,  say,  the\r\n\r\nPublications Act or the Newspapers and Printing Presses  Act  or\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Broadcasting Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members have talked about whether somehow we would\r\n\r\nstop  having discussions on television, whether party  political\r\n\r\nbroadcast  would  cease,  whether we would  stop  foreign  views\r\n\r\ncoming  in through SCV.  None of it.  Because the Act  makes  it\r\n\r\nvery  plain that it does not cover broadcasting.  We are talking\r\n\r\nabout  films  and its variants, videos and new  mutants  on  the\r\n\r\nInternet.   But  we are talking principally about  films,  about\r\n\r\npeople  coming  together  for  a group  exhibition  being  moved\r\n\r\ntogether one way or another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why the heavy fine of $100,000 and up to two years of jail\r\n\r\nsentence?  Because the impact during an election campaign can be\r\n\r\ndramatic.   Let  us  say,  $2,000,  as  proposed  by  Mr  Chiam.\r\n\r\nElection  day minus two, you suddenly mass-distribute throughout\r\n\r\nSingapore in key constituencies and you swing the public vote,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether PAP or opposition.  And we transform the nature of  this\r\n\r\nHouse.   After that, you can pay the fine.  But the  damage  has\r\n\r\nbeen  done.   The  damage can be dramatic and catastrophic.   So\r\n\r\nthere  must be no doubts in people's minds as to the seriousness\r\n\r\nof  this  offence.  Of course, if this is done years  before  an\r\n\r\nelection  and under less serious circumstances, I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\njudge  would take it into account.  But the purpose of having  a\r\n\r\nhigh   maximum   is  because  in  an  election   campaign,   the\r\n\r\nconsequences  of  such  a  wrongdoing  can  affect  gravely  our\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of Members have asked, \"Why can't we just restrict\r\n\r\nthe definition to films made by political parties? Then it is  a\r\n\r\nsimple definition.  It is clear.  I am not a political party.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  make the film.  That's that.\"  But imagine  if  we  had\r\n\r\nconfined  it  in this restrictive way, and you are  a  political\r\n\r\nparty desperate to win votes and wanting to use film as a way to\r\n\r\nwin  votes, what would you do?  You get your friends outside the\r\n\r\nparty to produce and to distribute the films.  You do it in  the\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party, the SDP will do it, the PAP will do it.  This is\r\n\r\nwhy  the second limb has to be constructed because if you do not\r\n\r\nconstruct  the  second limb, that wider definition,  you  cannot\r\n\r\nmaintain  the  position in the first limb.  But  the  intent  is\r\n\r\nclear.  It is not, in non-party political fields, to do anything\r\n\r\nmore than what we are doing now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam and Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam suggested that we are\r\n\r\ndenying  high-tech  to the opposition.  You will  remember  that\r\n\r\nsome years ago, I caused the Young PAP to start an Internet  web\r\n\r\nsite,  knowing  full  well  that we  would  have  to  eventually\r\n\r\nregulate political web sites on the Internet.  Letters which  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam complains are not being printed in the Straits Times,\r\n\r\nhe is quite free to post them on his web site.  Singaporeans are\r\n\r\nfree  to  click in on his web site and be moved by the force  of\r\n\r\nhis  arguments.  I would suggest to members of the  public  from\r\n\r\ntime to time to scan political web sites to see what is on them.\r\n\r\nIf  our  political parties are really so deprived,  so  excluded\r\n\r\nfrom  all channels of communications, so denied of free  speech,\r\n\r\nyou would have thought that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  web  sites  would be flourishing centres  of  debate  and\r\n\r\ndiscussion and enlightenment.  Are they?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have also asked, \"We already have the\r\n\r\nMaintenance  of Religious Harmony Act and the Internal  Security\r\n\r\nAct.  Are they not enough?\"  In an election campaign, you cannot\r\n\r\nlightly  use  the  Internal Security Act  because  it  would  be\r\n\r\nimmediately  misunderstood.  If you use it after  the  elections\r\n\r\nare over, the damage is already done.  It is a blunt instrument.\r\n\r\nWe need something finer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh See Kiat asked whether the definition of political\r\n\r\nfilms would somehow prevent discussion on animal rights or about\r\n\r\nthe moral issues concerning cloning or whatever.  It depends  on\r\n\r\nthe  actual facts of the situation.  If animal rights  become  a\r\n\r\ngripping political issue in Singapore, and all political parties\r\n\r\ntake positions, then, yes.  But if it is just a fringe activity,\r\n\r\nfirstly, I do not think we will take notice, and secondly, if it\r\n\r\nis  unbiased  and  takes in all views, I  think  that  may  well\r\n\r\nqualify  as a reporting rather than anything else.  The key  is:\r\n\r\nis  it partisan?  Is it biased?  Is it intended to influence  an\r\n\r\nelection, or legislation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An MP asked, \"Why not have more civic participation? Why\r\n\r\nnot  have  a  Select Committee?\"  There are so many consultation\r\n\r\nboards  in  Singapore  that I have  quite  lost  count.   In  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  alone,  we  have  proliferated.   So  have  the  other\r\n\r\nMinistries.   Many  Singaporeans complain that  they  are  being\r\n\r\nasked to sit on so many boards and so many panels.  Far from  it\r\n\r\nbeing that we do not consult, if there is a criticism now, it is\r\n\r\nperhaps that we consult a little too lightly and too frequently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this somehow a restriction of free speech, free debate,\r\n\r\nin  Singapore?   Recently,  the two major  financial  television\r\n\r\nchannels  merged, ABN, which is owned by Dow Jones and TCI,  and\r\n\r\nCNBC,  which  has  a  joint arrangement with  Microsoft.    They\r\n\r\nmerged  and  they decided to keep as their common entity,  CNBC.\r\n\r\nCNBC  was based in Hong Kong, and ABN in Singapore.  The  merged\r\n\r\nentity would be called CNBC.  They decided that it should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  based in Singapore and not Hong Kong.  If we blithely  enact\r\n\r\nlaws to prevent debate and free speech and the education of  our\r\n\r\npeople,  would  big  international media corporations  like  Dow\r\n\r\nJones and TCI and NBC have taken such a position?  But this does\r\n\r\nnot  mean  that we should not be masters of our own destiny  and\r\n\r\nshape the evolution of our own democracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I thank Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam for providing\r\n\r\ncontrast  to  our  argument.  He asked why  we  should  separate\r\n\r\nreligion from politics, by which I infer that he would encourage\r\n\r\nmonks and priests and ulamas to talk about politics.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> About issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> On political issues, in places of\r\n\r\nworship.   Mr  Jeyaretnam's position  on  this  is  clear.   Our\r\n\r\nposition  on this is clear.  I think the majority of Singapore's\r\n\r\nposition  on this is also very clear.  So too our proposal  here\r\n\r\nto  exclude film as a very poor medium, and a degrading  medium,\r\n\r\nfor political debate in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister by way of\r\n\r\nclarification?

However, this did not reflect the seriousness  of\r\n\r\nthe ongoing regional economic turmoil which started in July last\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic growth in 1997 was largely shaped by two factors.\r\n\r\nFirst,  we benefited from the recovery in the global electronics\r\n\r\nindustry.   Corrections in inventory overhang  and  healthy  new\r\n\r\norders in US and Europe boosted export demand, and confirmed our\r\n\r\nearlier  assessment  that the slowdown  we  experienced  in  the\r\n\r\nsecond  half  of  1996 was primarily cyclical.  This  turnaround\r\n\r\nprovided  the fillip for the manufacturing sector.   We expected\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nobody expected the second factor - the spread and\r\n\r\nsubsequent deepening of the economic crisis in the region.   The\r\n\r\nspeed and severity of contagion caught everyone off-guard.  What\r\n\r\nstarted  off as a devaluation of the Thai Baht led to widespread\r\n\r\nfinancial  and  economic turbulence in the  region.   One  after\r\n\r\nanother, regional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncurrencies   and   stock  markets  plummeted  as   international\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  the  region as a whole fell and  global  capital\r\n\r\nflowed   out  of  East  Asia.  Singapore,  despite  our   strong\r\n\r\nfundamentals, was not spared.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the impact on the real economy in 1997 was\r\n\r\nmuted.  There were two primary reasons for this.  First, a large\r\n\r\npart  of  Singapore's  regional  trade  consists  of  intra-firm\r\n\r\nmovement  of  parts,  components and final  products  by  multi-national companies (MNCs) for export to end markets in the  OECD\r\n\r\ncountries.   As  final demand from the US and  EU  was  healthy,\r\n\r\nSingapore's overall trade was not too seriously affected by  the\r\n\r\nregional  crisis.    Second, the upswing in  global  electronics\r\n\r\ndemand  also  supported  our  manufacturing  growth,  generating\r\n\r\nfavourable spin-offs for our related hub services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR 1998</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional crisis is far from over. While its impact on\r\n\r\nus  in  1997  was  minimal, the same cannot be  said  for  1998.\r\n\r\nBeing at the heart of South East Asia, we are not isolated  from\r\n\r\nregional  conditions.  We have comprehensive  economic  linkages\r\n\r\nwith   the   region  and  a  strong  stake  in  our  neighbours'\r\n\r\nprosperity.   In particular, our tradable services sectors  like\r\n\r\nfinance and tourism have a strong regional orientation and  will\r\n\r\nbe directly affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is useful to review how the regional crisis started and\r\n\r\nspread,   assess  its  impact  on  the  Singapore  economy   and\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  and  identify the measures  which  the  Government,\r\n\r\ncompanies  and Singaporeans can take to tide over this difficult\r\n\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>What Caused the Crisis</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roots of the crisis can be traced back to the huge\r\n\r\ninflux  of  cheap  foreign capital to the region  in  the  early\r\n\r\n1990s.    With   inadequate  prudential  supervision,   regional\r\n\r\nfinancial   institutions  over-extended  themselves   and   lent\r\n\r\nexcessively,  often to unproductive sectors and projects.   This\r\n\r\nrapid  build up of foreign debt was not sustainable.  It created\r\n\r\nasset  bubbles in the property and stock markets.  For  a  time,\r\n\r\nstrong regional economic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrowth  enabled the countries to service their debt  obligations\r\n\r\nthrough buoyant export revenues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidence in the region's export potential began to waver\r\n\r\ntowards  the mid-1990s, with various exchange rate realignments.\r\n\r\nIn  1994,  China  devalued the Yuan.  In 1995 the  Japanese  Yen\r\n\r\nstarted depreciating against the greenback.  In countries  whose\r\n\r\ncurrencies  were tightly pegged to the US dollar, exports  began\r\n\r\nto  lose  competitiveness.  Economies such as  China  and  Latin\r\n\r\nAmerica   emerged  as  keen  competitors.   These   developments\r\n\r\ncoincided  with  a  cyclical downturn in the global  electronics\r\n\r\nindustry and precipitated a regional export slowdown in 1996.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the export engines stalled, investors and creditors\r\n\r\ngrew  nervous  of the regional countries' continued  ability  to\r\n\r\nservice the growing foreign debt burden.  Eventually, the market\r\n\r\nlost  faith  in  the sustainability of the linked exchange  rate\r\n\r\nsystems adopted by regional economies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thailand was the first to suffer this loss of investor\r\n\r\nconfidence.  Speculative attacks against  the  Baht  mounted  as\r\n\r\nconcerns  about the Thai economy grew.  The breaking point  came\r\n\r\nwhen  Thailand's  foreign reserves dipped below  its  short-term\r\n\r\nforeign  debt  obligations  in  the  middle  of  1997.   Without\r\n\r\nsufficient  reserves to defend its currency, the Thai Government\r\n\r\nwas  forced  to allow the Baht to float on 2nd July  1997.   The\r\n\r\ncontagion  effect of this de-facto devaluation of the Thai  Baht\r\n\r\nquickly  spread to Malaysia and Indonesia as the market switched\r\n\r\nits  attention to other Southeast Asian economies  with  similar\r\n\r\nstructural weaknesses in their financial and banking systems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By September, the financial crisis extended to North East\r\n\r\nAsia.  Hong Kong's US dollar peg came under severe pressure, but\r\n\r\nmanaged to hold.  Long standing structural weaknesses in Japan's\r\n\r\nfinancial  and banking system caused some major institutions  to\r\n\r\nfail.   South Korea, with weaker fundamentals and large  private\r\n\r\nsector debt, took the biggest hit.  A massive US$57 billion IMF-led bail-out package was necessary to stabilise the Won, and  to\r\n\r\nkeep the Korean economy on its feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending on how successfully Governments manage economic\r\n\r\nrecovery,  maintain political and social stability, and  restore\r\n\r\ninvestor   confidence,  the  regional  situation  could   either\r\n\r\ngradually  stabilise  and start to recuperate,  or  continue  to\r\n\r\ndeteriorate  before it gets better.  Even if regional  countries\r\n\r\ntake  all  the right steps and see through painful but necessary\r\n\r\npolitical  and  economic reform policies, the  recovery  process\r\n\r\ncannot  be  immediate.  Overall, we can therefore expect  slower\r\n\r\nregional growth over the short to medium term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Outlook for the Singapore Economy</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, it is difficult to predict precisely the\r\n\r\nimmediate economic outlook for Singapore.  The regional  context\r\n\r\nis  too  volatile  and  fraught with   uncertainties.   Further,\r\n\r\npolitical,  social  and economic changes  can  trigger  off  new\r\n\r\ndiscontinuities, and render past trends irrelevant.  What we can\r\n\r\ndo  is  to  assess  the economic outlook based  on  the  current\r\n\r\nsituation, assuming there are no drastic developments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore economy is expected to feel the full impact\r\n\r\nof  the regional economic crisis this year.  The latest business\r\n\r\nexpectations  survey  results indicate  that  nearly  all  major\r\n\r\nsectors expect weaker business conditions for the next 6 months.\r\n\r\nThe  Composite Leading Index, which leads economic  activity  by\r\n\r\nabout 9 months, has been slowing down since September.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growth in the financial services sector is likely to\r\n\r\nmoderate significantly.  The Asian Dollar Market, one of the key\r\n\r\nfinancial growth engines, will slow considerably.  With the risk\r\n\r\npremium  for  the  region having risen significantly,  financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions   are   adopting  a  wait-and-see   stance   before\r\n\r\ncommitting any new loans to the region.  Activity in the foreign\r\n\r\nexchange and stock markets is also expected to moderate from the\r\n\r\nhigh levels in the second half of 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commerce sector has already registered early impacts\r\n\r\nfrom the regional crisis.  Entrepot trade will moderate as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimport  demand  from  regional  countries  for  consumption  and\r\n\r\ncapital  goods  slows.    The  other  domestic  segments  within\r\n\r\ncommerce  will  also  not be spared.   The  tourism  and  retail\r\n\r\ntrades  are already seeing slower tourist arrivals and  consumer\r\n\r\nspending, with no immediate prospects of a pickup.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transportation sector, especially our air and sea\r\n\r\nports,  will also be adversely affected by the fall  in  tourist\r\n\r\narrivals  and  regional transhipment activities.   However,  the\r\n\r\ntelecommunications sub-sector should continue to expand,  albeit\r\n\r\nat a more moderated pace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In manufacturing, the continuing robustness of our major\r\n\r\nexport markets in US and EU will help to sustain growth.  The US\r\n\r\nis   enjoying   an  unprecedented  stretch  of   strong   growth\r\n\r\naccompanied by low unemployment and low inflation.  The  uptrend\r\n\r\nin US demand for electronics components since the second half of\r\n\r\n1996 is continuing.  Growth in the EU is also expected to remain\r\n\r\nfirm.   The healthy pipeline of investment commitments over  the\r\n\r\nlast  few  years  will also contribute to additional  industrial\r\n\r\ncapacity  in  1998.   These  positive  factors  will  help   our\r\n\r\nmanufacturing   sector,  although  we  will   still   see   some\r\n\r\nconsolidation  in industries where there is global over-capacity\r\n\r\nand keen competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction should see robust growth. Private residential\r\n\r\ndevelopments are sluggish. But growth will be supported  by  the\r\n\r\ncontinued  healthy  pipeline  of  public  sector  infrastructure\r\n\r\nprojects,  including the North-East MRT line and public  housing\r\n\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under present conditions, the Ministry of Trade and\r\n\r\nIndustry  (MTI)  expects  the Singapore  economy  to  slow  down\r\n\r\nsignificantly, but not to the extent of going into a  recession.\r\n\r\nMTI's  economic growth forecast for 1998 is 2.5  to  4.5%.   MTI\r\n\r\nwill continue to monitor future developments closely, and review\r\n\r\nits forecast where necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Lessons from the financial crisis</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid development of the regional crisis and the\r\n\r\nregional  outlook  for 1998 contains two important  lessons  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, even while the external environment appears\r\n\r\nfavourable,  things can deteriorate rapidly.  We  cannot  assume\r\n\r\nthat  the  external environment will remain benign forever.   We\r\n\r\nshould never be complacent.  Policy vigilance is necessary.   We\r\n\r\nmust  save and invest wisely in good times, to build up  a  deep\r\n\r\nand firm economic foundation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the regional crisis has reaffirmed the importance\r\n\r\nof  preserving  and  instilling confidence  internationally  and\r\n\r\ndomestically  for  continued  stability  and  economic   growth.\r\n\r\nInternational  and domestic investors determine  demand,  invest\r\n\r\nment  and  hence the level of business activity.  The Government\r\n\r\nmust  therefore build up the confidence and trust  of  investors\r\n\r\nthrough  credible, consistent and pro-growth  policies.   During\r\n\r\ncrises,  we  must  be  responsive and ready to  effect  rational\r\n\r\nmeasures judiciously and promptly to restore market confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Policy Stance/Adjustments</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should use this period as an opportunity to build on our\r\n\r\nconsiderable  strengths, review our longer term  strategies  and\r\n\r\nposition ourselves for future growth.  Fortunately, our  economy\r\n\r\nis  now  much stronger and more resilient than it was  in  1985.\r\n\r\nOur  economic  structure is more mature, our costs more  aligned\r\n\r\nwith  productivity  and economic growth, and our  people  better\r\n\r\ntrained  and  skilled  than a decade ago.  Our  current  account\r\n\r\nsurpluses and reserves are healthy, our export markets are  well\r\n\r\ndiversified,  and  our industrial and services  base  is  broad.\r\n\r\nOverall, our fundamentals remain sound.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is watching closely the impact of the\r\n\r\nregional  crisis on our economy.  The Committee  On  Singapore's\r\n\r\nCompetitiveness  has  gathered  private  sector   feedback   and\r\n\r\nrecommendations.  We  must make some adjustments   to  keep  our\r\n\r\nbusiness environment competitive, but drastic policy changes are\r\n\r\nnot appropriate or necessary at this juncture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In formulating our policies, the Government's key objective\r\n\r\nis to maintain the framework for economic activity.  Market\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforces  will  compel industries to consolidate and  restructure.\r\n\r\nSome  industries will feel the fall in business demand more than\r\n\r\nothers.   Weak and over-extended companies may have to merge  or\r\n\r\nfold.   We  must  accept  this.  It is  the  normal  process  of\r\n\r\nadjustment  to  new economic conditions.  The Government  cannot\r\n\r\nprevent  it  from  happening, or intervene to support  companies\r\n\r\nwhich are in difficulty, without paying a high price in terms of\r\n\r\nmisallocated resources and moral hazard.  At the same  time,  we\r\n\r\nwill  push  ahead with plans to restructure our economy  towards\r\n\r\nhigher   value-added  activities,  and  enhance   our   economic\r\n\r\ncapabilities and competitiveness to support future growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>(A) Fiscal Policy</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this period of uncertainty, we have emphasised\r\n\r\nfiscal  prudence  in planning the Government  Budget.   We  have\r\n\r\ndecided to adopt a conservative fiscal stance, and target for  a\r\n\r\nmodest budget surplus, smaller than in recent years.  Government\r\n\r\nrevenues  will  be  stagnant.  We are keeping  a  tight  lid  on\r\n\r\noperational   expenditures.   But  we  are  increasing   capital\r\n\r\nexpenditures,  particularly  in  the  key  areas  of  education,\r\n\r\neconomic infrastructure and defence, in order to invest for  the\r\n\r\nlong-term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Education</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human talent has always been our most precious resource,\r\n\r\nand  will  become  increasingly critical as we  develop  into  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based  economy.  The quality of our  education  system\r\n\r\nwill  determine  whether  young Singaporeans  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\naccess, process and apply knowledge creatively.  The Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation (MOE) has embarked on a comprehensive plan to  upgrade\r\n\r\nboth  the  hard  and soft aspects of our school  infrastructure.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  the  Master  Plan for Information  Technology  in\r\n\r\nEducation  seeks to impart thinking, learning and  communication\r\n\r\nskills  through the use of information technology  (IT)  in  our\r\n\r\nschools.   At the same time, the Master Plan aims to continually\r\n\r\nanticipate  the needs of society in future and cater courses  to\r\n\r\nmeet these needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Economic infrastructure</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our world-class infrastructure has helped to keep us in\r\n\r\nfront  in a highly competitive environment by keeping our  total\r\n\r\nbusiness  cost relatively low.  We must continue  to  invest  in\r\n\r\nbuilding  our  longer-term productive  capacity.   Key  economic\r\n\r\ninfrastructure projects we will push on with include reclamation\r\n\r\nat  Changi  East,  Jurong Island Phase 3 and  the  upgrading  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  facilities at Tuas.  This counter-cyclical  spending\r\n\r\nwill boost the economy, and enable us to take advantage of lower\r\n\r\nconstruction costs during the regional slowdown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Defence</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic prosperity depends on a framework of stability and\r\n\r\nsecurity.   A  strong, credible SAF deterrent  has  been  a  key\r\n\r\nelement of this framework.  A professional and effective defence\r\n\r\nforce  with cutting-edge capabilities is not built up overnight,\r\n\r\nbut  through prudent and consistent investment over many  years.\r\n\r\nDefence  spending  must be seen as a long-term  investment,  not\r\n\r\ndependent on the ups and downs of the economy from year to year.\r\n\r\nA   credible   defence  capability  is  the  pre-condition   for\r\n\r\nSingapore's continued peace and prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>(B) Wage Restraint & Skills Upgrading</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our overall cost structure is not significantly out of\r\n\r\nline.  Singapore is internationally competitive, unlike in 1985.\r\n\r\nBut   we  should  be  careful  to  do  nothing  to  weaken   our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  during this period of slower  economic  growth.\r\n\r\nCost containment will be a major concern for all businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wages form the largest component of business costs. We\r\n\r\nneed  to watch wage costs very carefully. Our priority this year\r\n\r\nshould be to protect jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies are already trimming back wage increases, and in\r\n\r\nsome  cases  freezing wages. The Government has  announced  that\r\n\r\nsalaries  of  ministers and civil servants will  effectively  be\r\n\r\nfrozen this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear.  Wage moderation and flexibility are an important part  of\r\n\r\nour response to the regional crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the 1985 recession, our wage system was too rigid.\r\n\r\nThis made it difficult for companies to trim wage costs when the\r\n\r\neconomy  slowed, and contributed to deepening the recession.  To\r\n\r\ntrim costs, we had no alternative but to cut the employers'  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate.   So  after the recession,  we  set  up  the\r\n\r\nflexible wage system. As the economy grew, year by year we built\r\n\r\nup  a variable component of wages, instead of locking in all the\r\n\r\nwage  increases of good years in the fixed wage.  This  variable\r\n\r\ncomponent  would  be  a buffer that could  be  reduced  not  too\r\n\r\npainfully when business conditions changed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1987, when the flexible wage system was introduced, the\r\n\r\nvariable  component was, on average, 11% of total annual  wages.\r\n\r\nToday, in the civil service the variable component has increased\r\n\r\nto  at  least 20% of annual wages, while in the private  sector,\r\n\r\nthe variable component is about 16%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We built up the variable component of salaries precisely to\r\n\r\nmeet  a situation like this year.  If we need to trim wage costs\r\n\r\nthis  year, these variable components will be the first line  of\r\n\r\ndefence. This will depend on the NWC recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slower economic growth also makes it more urgent for\r\n\r\nworkers  to  re-skill,  re-train and upgrade  themselves.  There\r\n\r\nwill  be  retrenchments as industries and companies consolidate.\r\n\r\nWorkers  who  add significant value to companies are  those  who\r\n\r\nwill  keep  their  jobs.  The key challenge for  workers  is  to\r\n\r\nremain relevant and employable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's policy has always been to create the right\r\n\r\nconditions  for  companies to create good jobs, and  to  provide\r\n\r\nample training and upgrading opportunities for workers. We  have\r\n\r\nnot  opted for unemployment insurance, but instead have kept our\r\n\r\nlabour  market flexible.  This approach has served workers  well\r\n\r\nand produced full employment for many years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, despite this, nobody can expect lifetime job\r\n\r\nsecurity. From time to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime  workers  will  be retrenched, even in  a  full  employment\r\n\r\neconomy. When this happens, those who have been retrenched  must\r\n\r\nbe  willing  to  be  flexible  in  their  expectations,  and  if\r\n\r\nnecessary  accept a little less pay to secure a  new  job.   The\r\n\r\nlonger a worker stays unemployed, the more difficult it will  be\r\n\r\nfor him or her to rejoin the workforce.  Even now the number  of\r\n\r\nforeign  professionals and workers is still increasing in  Singa\r\n\r\npore.  There  are  more  jobs  to be  filled  than  Singaporeans\r\n\r\navailable to do them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies too need to tighten their belts during this\r\n\r\nperiod.   They  should  look at streamlining  and  consolidating\r\n\r\ntheir  operations  to  cut  costs. They  should  also  take  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  upgrade their capabilities, and  enhance  their\r\n\r\nexisting  products and services to prepare for the  upturn.   At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, they should make more efforts to upgrade  their\r\n\r\nworkers.   While MNCs and larger companies have made significant\r\n\r\nprogress in worker training, reaching roughly 4-6% of investment\r\n\r\npayroll, smaller companies still lag behind, spending an average\r\n\r\nof  only about 2%.  Just as the Government is not letting up  on\r\n\r\nour  investments in education, companies too should not  neglect\r\n\r\nto improve the quality of their workforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>(C) Local Enterprise Financing Scheme</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key concern of businessmen during this period of\r\n\r\nslower growth is the availability and cost of capital to support\r\n\r\ntheir  business activities.  Some businesses have reported  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  facing  higher interest rates and that  their  credit\r\n\r\nlines are being pulled back.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some tightening of bank credit and increase in interest\r\n\r\nrates  is  inevitable  at a time of regional  uncertainty.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment has explained that it cannot intervene to  ask  banks\r\n\r\nto   extend  loans  or  to  lower  interest  rates.   These  are\r\n\r\ncommercial lending decisions, which the banks themselves have to\r\n\r\ntake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government will enhance its Local Enterprise\r\n\r\nFinancing  Scheme  (LEFS)  to help local  businesses  to  obtain\r\n\r\nworking capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will expand the scope of LEFS to cover more local\r\n\r\nenterprises. For factoring and working loan facilities, we  will\r\n\r\nraise the eligibility threshold for manufacturing companies from\r\n\r\na  maximum  of  $15 million in fixed productive assets,  to  $30\r\n\r\nmillion.   For services companies, the cap on maximum employment\r\n\r\nsize will be raised from 200 to 300 employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Government will share a greater part of the\r\n\r\nrisk  in  LEFS.   Currently, for factoring loans,  the  risk  is\r\n\r\nborne fully by the financial institution administering the  LEFS\r\n\r\nloan,  while for working capital loans, the Government  and  the\r\n\r\nfinancial institution share the risk 40:60.  The Government will\r\n\r\nnow  co-share  the risk for both factoring and  working  capital\r\n\r\nloans  on a 50:50 basis with the financial institution. However,\r\n\r\nthe  financial  institution must still undertake  the  necessary\r\n\r\ncredit  analysis, and satisfy itself that the company is a  good\r\n\r\nrisk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the maximum loan quantum per company for factoring\r\n\r\nand  working capital loan facilities will be increased  from  $5\r\n\r\nmillion to $8 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cater for the expected increase in the volume of LEFS\r\n\r\nloans,  the Government will increase its provision in LEFS  loan\r\n\r\nlines  from $760 million to $1.1 billion.  We will review  these\r\n\r\nenhancements to LEFS in 2 years' time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Productivity and Standards Board and the Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board will be releasing more details of the enhanced\r\n\r\nLEFS shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>(D) JTC/HDB Rentals</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides wages and the cost of capital, rentals form another\r\n\r\nsignificant component of business costs.  In July last year, the\r\n\r\nJurong  Town  Corporation (JTC) implemented several measures  to\r\n\r\nmoderate  or  defer  rental increases for  its  lessees.   These\r\n\r\nmeasures  are  up  for review on 1st July 1998.   Similarly,  in\r\n\r\nDecember   1997,  the  Housing  and  Development   Board   (HDB)\r\n\r\nimplemented  a package of rental concessions for its  industrial\r\n\r\nand  commercial  tenants.  The HDB package  included  moderating\r\n\r\nrental adjustments at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3rd  renewal of tenancies and staggering increases in  rent  for\r\n\r\nsub-letting and assignment cases.  These steps were part of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  continuing  efforts to review  and  moderate  cost\r\n\r\npressures on businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC and HDB will now extend additional rental concessions\r\n\r\nto their tenants and lessees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) JTC and HDB will freeze their posted land rentals\r\n\r\nfor  an additional 12 months, till end June 1999.\r\n\r\nThey  will moderate rental adjustments for  their\r\n\r\nindustrial land lessees who are paying less  than\r\n\r\nthe posted rates.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) JTC will freeze the posted rentals of its\r\n\r\nfactories, workshops and warehouses till end June\r\n\r\n1999,  and  similarly moderate rental adjustments\r\n\r\nfor existing tenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) To help tenants and lessees who may have\r\n\r\ntemporary  cashflow problems, HDB  and  JTC  will\r\n\r\nmake   upfront  collections  of  rental  payments\r\n\r\nmonthly rather than quarterly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC and HDB will be releasing more details of these\r\n\r\nconcessions separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>(E) Government Land Releases</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area of concern is the health of the property\r\n\r\nmarket in Singapore.  An unstable property market will not  only\r\n\r\naffect   the  property  value  of  homeowners,  but   also   has\r\n\r\nrepercussions on the financial and economic system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November, the Government announced adjustments to the\r\n\r\nprivate  residential  policies to avoid aggravating  the  excess\r\n\r\nsupply  in  the market.  The sale of sites for some 2,000  units\r\n\r\nfrom the 1997 Government Land Sales (GLS) programme was deferred\r\n\r\nto the first half of 1998.  The 1998 GLS programme was postponed\r\n\r\nuntil the second half of 1998, and the original sale quantum  of\r\n\r\n5,000 units was to be reviewed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the situation has altered considerably since November.\r\n\r\nThe  Government has decided on further adjustments to  its  land\r\n\r\nsales in 1998 as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Private Residential Properties</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will defer the sale of sites for 2,000\r\n\r\nunits,  scheduled  for  the first half of  1998.   It  plans  to\r\n\r\nrelease   a   total  of  2,500  units  for  private  residential\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  the second half of 1998.  We will  continue  to\r\n\r\nmonitor  the regional and domestic situation, and if  necessary,\r\n\r\nadjust the land sales programme again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy to release sufficient land over the medium term\r\n\r\nto  meet Singaporeans' aspirations to own private properties  is\r\n\r\nunchanged.   The Government will resume selling a steady  supply\r\n\r\nof land when the market recovers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Executive Condominiums</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like private residential properties, the demand for\r\n\r\nExecutive  Condominiums has also been affected by  the  economic\r\n\r\nslowdown.   The  Government  will reduce  the  land  supply  for\r\n\r\nExecutive  Condominiums in 1998 from the 3,000 units  originally\r\n\r\nannounced to 1,500 units.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Commercial Space & Hotel Rooms</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will release land for about 80,000 square\r\n\r\nmetres of nett commercial space in 1998. This is about half  the\r\n\r\n166,000  square  metres made available in 1997, and  takes  into\r\n\r\naccount the demand and supply situation in the medium term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there are enough hotel rooms to meet the needs of the\r\n\r\ntourism  industry  in the medium term, the Government  will  not\r\n\r\nrelease any land for hotel development in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of National Development will separately\r\n\r\nannounce details of the sites to be released in 1998 for private\r\n\r\nresidential  properties, Executive Condominiums  and  commercial\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will also be making some tax changes and\r\n\r\nconcessions  to help ease business costs.  I will  elaborate  on\r\n\r\nthe details in a later part of my speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>CONCLUSION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional financial crisis arose out of financial\r\n\r\nexcesses  and a rapid erosion of investor confidence.   Provided\r\n\r\nstability is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaintained and effective reform measures are implemented, market\r\n\r\nconfidence will be gradually restored in the regional  economies\r\n\r\nand  further fall-out will be minimised.  But if reform measures\r\n\r\nare  unsuccessful or stability is shaken, it could  trigger  off\r\n\r\nfurther uncertainty and economic difficulty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional crisis will affect the Singapore economy\r\n\r\nsignificantly in 1998.  We must all be prepared for  the  slower\r\n\r\ngrowth.    However, Singapore is in a strong position to weather\r\n\r\nthis  regional  storm.   Provided businesses,  workers  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  rally  together, we will successfully  weather  this\r\n\r\ndifficult period and emerge more resilient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intense economic competition is already a reality. When\r\n\r\nthe  region  recovers, the regional economies  will  be  leaner,\r\n\r\nfitter  and more competitive.  Singapore must use this  time  to\r\n\r\ninvest  wisely,  restructure,  consolidate  and  build  up   our\r\n\r\ncapabilities and productive capacities.  Whether we can ride the\r\n\r\nnext  wave of growth when the region recovers depends on whether\r\n\r\nwe continue to add value to the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>II THE FY98 BUDGET</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now present the Budget for Fiscal\r\n\r\nYear 1998.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXPENDITURE POLICY</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating revenue in FY98 is expected to grow by 3.8% in\r\n\r\nFY98,  lower than the average growth rate of 6.7% over the  past\r\n\r\nthree  years.   This  is due to the effects  of  lower  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth and the follow through of tax cuts introduced in previous\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the slower increase in revenues, our\r\n\r\nrevenue  base  remains  robust  and  a  deficit  budget  is  not\r\n\r\nenvisaged.   Adequate funds will be available to  maintain,  and\r\n\r\neven  increase, where necessary, expenditures needed to  support\r\n\r\nlong  term  growth  and  future competitiveness.   As  mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier, this will mainly be in the areas of education, economic\r\n\r\ninfrastructure   and   defence.    However,   because   of   the\r\n\r\nconsiderable uncertainties which continue to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noverhang the region, we will exercise fiscal restraint in  other\r\n\r\nnon-crucial  areas  of expenditure.  The FY98  Budget  Estimates\r\n\r\nhave been prepared on this basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>FY98 EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total Government expenditure in FY98 will increase by 15%\r\n\r\nto $27.2 billion.  This is more than double the expected nominal\r\n\r\nGDP  growth rate, which will provide some fiscal stimulus to the\r\n\r\ndomestic  economy.  As in past years, we have however  continued\r\n\r\nto keep a firm rein on operating expenditure, which will rise by\r\n\r\n7.8%  to $15.5 billion.  This is 9.8% of GDP, up marginally from\r\n\r\n9.7% of GDP in FY97.  On the other hand, development expenditure\r\n\r\nis  expected  to  jump by 25% to $11.7 billion, carried  by  the\r\n\r\nmomentum of economic and infrastructural development which began\r\n\r\nin recent years.  This accounts for 7.5% of GDP, up by more than\r\n\r\n1 percentage point from 6.3% of GDP in FY97.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now highlight the salient features of this year's\r\n\r\nexpenditure  budget  against  the  backdrop  of  our   budgetary\r\n\r\npolicies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>EXPENDITURE PRIORITIES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, this year's budget continues to emphasise the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  priorities on education, security, health,  public\r\n\r\nhousing,  environment, transportation and economic  development.\r\n\r\nChief among these are education and security which have a strong\r\n\r\nbearing on Singapore's long-term strategic interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total spending on education will rise by a hefty 30% from\r\n\r\n$4.4  billion  in FY97 to $5.7 billion in FY98.  The  jump  from\r\n\r\n3.0%  to 3.6% of GDP brings our spending on education closer  to\r\n\r\nthe  medium-term  target of 4% of GDP.  We  can  take  pride  in\r\n\r\nhaving  developed an educational system which we believe is  one\r\n\r\nof  the best in the world.  Our students' performances have been\r\n\r\noutstanding in international mathematics and science surveys and\r\n\r\nOlympiads.   This  year,  higher  enrolments  are  projected  in\r\n\r\nschools and tertiary institutions, leading to a 12% increase  in\r\n\r\noperating  expenditure.  The main boost in the education  budget\r\n\r\nhowever comes from a 80%\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincrease  in development spending on the building of  new  and\r\n\r\nbetter schools and campuses, the single session secondary school\r\n\r\nbuilding  programme and the roll-out of the IT  Master  Plan  in\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defence spending will amount to 4.6% of GDP, up from 4.4%\r\n\r\nin  FY97, but still well below the 6% of GDP that Government  is\r\n\r\nprepared to commit to develop and maintain a strong and credible\r\n\r\ndefence  force.   So  long as revenues hold up,  we  should  not\r\n\r\nslacken  spending in this area since the security of our  nation\r\n\r\nis the very basis of our survival and prosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the emphasis on education, the social and community\r\n\r\nservices sector as a whole will account for the lion's share  of\r\n\r\n37%  of total expenditure in FY98, with security coming in close\r\n\r\nat  34%.   The share of spending on economic and infrastructural\r\n\r\ndevelopment will exceed 20% for the second consecutive year,  up\r\n\r\nfrom  an  average of only 15% over the period in  FY93-96.   The\r\n\r\nincrease   in  this  sector  is  driven  by  higher  development\r\n\r\nspending.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Operating Expenditure</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating expenditure in FY98 is expected to be 9.8% of\r\n\r\nGDP.   As  a  share of GDP, this is consistent  with  levels  in\r\n\r\nprevious  years,  barring  the  one-time  compensation  of  $1.5\r\n\r\nbillion  to  SingTel in FY96 for removal of monopoly privileges.\r\n\r\nAt  around the 10% GDP level, our operating expenditure is  also\r\n\r\nconsiderably lower than that of most developed countries.   This\r\n\r\nis  the  result of a deliberate policy to keep the public sector\r\n\r\nlean  and  trim,  avoiding welfarism and confining  Government's\r\n\r\nrole  to one of providing basic public goods and services,  thus\r\n\r\nfreeing  more  manpower and financial resources to  the  private\r\n\r\nsector as the engine of growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the growth of operating expenditure will\r\n\r\nnot   be   held  down  dogmatically  without  regard  to  public\r\n\r\nexpectations  for  new and higher quality services  as  well  as\r\n\r\nincreased  workload.   Where  warranted,  we  will  provide  for\r\n\r\nincreases in operating expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1994, we have also introduced a financial management\r\n\r\nsystem called Budgeting-for-Results or BFR, to raise the quality\r\n\r\nand efficiency of public services.  Under the BFR programme, the\r\n\r\npublic sector is managed along the lines of Autonomous Agencies,\r\n\r\nor  AAs.  With effect from April last year, all AAs are required\r\n\r\nto  pre-specify output and performance targets that they hope to\r\n\r\nachieve  for  the  budgets voted to them in return  for  greater\r\n\r\nautonomy   in  financial  and  personnel  management.   Wherever\r\n\r\npossible,  they will attempt to link their outputs  directly  to\r\n\r\ntheir funding.  In this way, there is greater accountability for\r\n\r\ndeliverables,  and  transparency in the  utilisation  of  public\r\n\r\nresources.   The  aim is to ensure that public sector  recurrent\r\n\r\nspending  does  not  outstrip  nominal  GDP  growth  rate,  with\r\n\r\ncompensation made for increased workload and new programmes  and\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BFR framework is appropriate and effective in\r\n\r\nregulating  the  running  cost  of  Government  departments  and\r\n\r\nGovernment-funded  statutory boards.  Running  costs  constitute\r\n\r\nmore  than  90%  of  our  operating expenditure.   Since  annual\r\n\r\nincreases  in cost factors are generally lower than GDP  growth,\r\n\r\nany  increase in running costs as a share of GDP is due entirely\r\n\r\nto new programmes and higher workload.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfers, the other component of operating expenditure,\r\n\r\nare budgeted at $1.2 billion.  These constitute less than 10% of\r\n\r\noperating  expenditure.  More than half will go to  restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals as healthcare and medical subsidies, another 16%  will\r\n\r\ngo  to  town councils to subsidise estate management costs,  and\r\n\r\n10%  will  go  to welfare and community self-help organisations.\r\n\r\nThis   reflects   the  Government's  philosophy  on   subsidies.\r\n\r\nSubsidies are given selectively, and only on essentials such  as\r\n\r\nbasic  healthcare  and public housing on a  cost-sharing  basis.\r\n\r\nFor example, medical subsidies on hospitalisation are fixed as a\r\n\r\npercentage of charges and skewed heavily in favour of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  lower  income groups.  At the same time, genuine  cases  of\r\n\r\ndire need are never ignored.  Medifund, set up in 1993 as a fall-back  for those who cannot afford to pay their share of  medical\r\n\r\ncost,  is  expected  to  pay out some  $18  million  in  medical\r\n\r\nsubsidies in FY97 to cover the needs of those who cannot  afford\r\n\r\neven the heavily subsidised C class charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its launch, the Medifund has received $600 million in\r\n\r\ntransfers from the Government to build up its capital endowment.\r\n\r\nBased  on  the  current level of capital in the fund,  projected\r\n\r\nincome will be adequate to meet projected drawdowns in FY98.   I\r\n\r\ndo  not  therefore  propose to make an  additional  transfer  of\r\n\r\ncapital to the Medifund this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The absence of large scale public assistance programmes\r\n\r\nreflects the Government's stand on state welfarism.  We  believe\r\n\r\nthat  extensive  welfare programmes damage  the  fabric  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety  as  they  diminish  individual  responsibility,   self-reliance, community support and the work ethic.  Even in the UK,\r\n\r\nthe  Government has realised that welfarism is not the right way\r\n\r\nto go, and is trying to roll back many of the welfare programmes\r\n\r\nand  policies  introduced  after  the  Second  World  War.   Our\r\n\r\napproach  is  one  of many helping hands, with  co-funding  from\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  public  donations,  and  services  rendered  by\r\n\r\nvolunteers and members of the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Development Expenditure</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a percentage of GDP, we spend much more on development\r\n\r\nthan the G-7 economies.  This reflects the emphasis we place  on\r\n\r\nbuilding  up  a  world-class infrastructure, focusing  on  areas\r\n\r\nwhich  bring high returns and lasting benefits.  We will  invest\r\n\r\nin  infrastructure  to  support economic  activities.   We  will\r\n\r\ndevelop  a  first-rate road and rail network system to transport\r\n\r\npeople  and goods efficiently and more industrial land  will  be\r\n\r\nmade  available  through  reclamation.   School  buildings   and\r\n\r\nteaching  systems  will be constantly upgraded  to  prepare  our\r\n\r\nyoung  to  deal  with  future challenges in  the  workplace  and\r\n\r\nsociety.   We  will  continue to invest in affordable  and  good\r\n\r\nquality\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic  housing,  and  in modern drainage,  sanitary  and  waste\r\n\r\nhandling systems to support healthy living.  Not least, we  need\r\n\r\nto   constantly  upgrade  our  defence  and  internal   security\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  so  that  our  families  and  assets  are   well\r\n\r\nprotected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last three years, that is, FY95-97, spending on\r\n\r\ndevelopment has risen steadily from between 3-5% of GDP prior to\r\n\r\nFY95  to 6.3% in FY97, and now, to 7.5% in FY98.  As Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy graduates from the ranks of developing country status to\r\n\r\nan  advanced developing economy, we will face new challenges and\r\n\r\nstronger  competition.   We will need to  quicken  the  pace  of\r\n\r\neconomic  infrastructural  development  and  renewal,   and   to\r\n\r\naccelerate  the  development  and education  of  our  workforce.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the current regional economic turmoil, we intend\r\n\r\nto  implement all the essential development programmes.  We will\r\n\r\nthen  emerge stronger and more robust once the storm blows  over\r\n\r\nin this part of the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic development programmes under the Ministry of Trade\r\n\r\nand  Industry are expected to cost $2.8 billion and account  for\r\n\r\nthe  largest share of development expenditure.  Its share of GDP\r\n\r\nwill rise from only 0.3% of GDP before FY95 to 1.8% of GDP.  The\r\n\r\nthrust of development is in land reclamation on Jurong Island to\r\n\r\nmeet  expansion  needs  of  the  petroleum,  petrochemical   and\r\n\r\nchemical  industry,  an  important  and  growing  arm   of   our\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector.  More than $1 billion is committed in FY98\r\n\r\nfor  reclamation  of 1,800 hectares and a road  link  to  Jurong\r\n\r\nIsland.   In  addition, another $420 million has been  earmarked\r\n\r\nfor  on-going reclamation and development at Tuas  View.   Funds\r\n\r\nare  also provided under the Economic Development and Assistance\r\n\r\nScheme,  and  the  building  of  a  mega  exhibition  centre,  a\r\n\r\ncentrepiece of the Tourism 21 plan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communications ranks second with a development budget of\r\n\r\n$1.8  billion.  This is 1.2% of GDP, doubling from 0.66% of  GDP\r\n\r\nin  FY96,  as  we  are  committed to create a  world-class  land\r\n\r\ntransport  system.  A sum of $1.2 billion is  provided  for  the\r\n\r\nNorth East MRT Line, Changi MRT Extension,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBukit  Panjang LRT, Sengkang LRT, a new MRT station at Singapore\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  and the construction of a building  directly  above\r\n\r\nand  integrated with the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station.  Also  on  the\r\n\r\ncards are several improvements to our road network, such as  the\r\n\r\nupgrading  of  expressways  and the  building  of  new  junction\r\n\r\ninterchanges and roads to ease congestion for faster movement of\r\n\r\npeople and goods.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, spending on economic and infrastructural\r\n\r\ndevelopment as a whole is set to more than double from  1.3%  of\r\n\r\nGDP  in FY93 to 3.1% of GDP in FY98.  For the second consecutive\r\n\r\nyear, it has overtaken social and community services as the  top\r\n\r\npriority in development spending.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this has not been achieved at the expense of reduced\r\n\r\ndevelopment spending on social and community services.  In fact,\r\n\r\ndevelopment spending on social and community services  has  also\r\n\r\nrisen steadily and strongly over the past five years, from  1.7%\r\n\r\nof GDP in FY93 to 2.7% of GDP in FY98.  This is driven mainly by\r\n\r\nincreased  spending  on education projects,  which  will  almost\r\n\r\ndouble,  from  0.7%  of  GDP in FY93 to 1.2%  of  GDP  in  FY98.\r\n\r\nSpending  on  drainage, sewerage and waste  disposal  facilities\r\n\r\nunder  the  Ministry of the Environment has also gone up  three-fold  from 0.2% of GDP in FY93 to 0.6% of GDP in FY98.   On  the\r\n\r\nslate  are  a  fourth incineration plant, a  landfill  at  Pulau\r\n\r\nSemakau,  and  the  upgrading  of  various  sewerage  works  and\r\n\r\nfacilities  to expand processing capacity to accommodate  future\r\n\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital expenditure on public housing is expected to remain\r\n\r\nat  about  0.5% of GDP, increasing by 8% to about $790  million.\r\n\r\nThis  includes  $150  million in capital  grants  to  HDB,  $350\r\n\r\nmillion  for  the  main upgrading programme,  and  another  $130\r\n\r\nmillion for the interim upgrading programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Estimated revenue collection is  $29.9\r\n\r\nbillion,  while  operating  and  development  expenditures   are\r\n\r\nbudgeted  at $27.2 billion.  The operating surplus for  FY98  is\r\n\r\ntherefore expected to be $2.7 billion or about 1.7% of GDP.   As\r\n\r\na  percentage of GDP, the surplus is much lower than the average\r\n\r\nof  nearly 7% achieved over the five years between 1991 and 1995\r\n\r\nand even lower than the 3.8% average of 1996 and 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the direct impact of the regional turmoil on\r\n\r\nlowering growth and revenue in FY98, there are two other reasons\r\n\r\nfor  the  smaller  surplus.  One is a general  slowdown  in  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  revenue collection due to the cumulative effects  of\r\n\r\ntax  cuts introduced over the past 12 years.  The other  is  the\r\n\r\nsubstantial  rise in development expenditures in  recent  years.\r\n\r\nOver  the  5-year  period  between 1991  and  1995,  development\r\n\r\nexpenditures averaged 4.3% of GDP per year.  In 1996  and  1997,\r\n\r\ndevelopment  expenditures jumped to nearly 6.5% of GDP  when  we\r\n\r\nembarked  on major programmes to upgrade and expand our economic\r\n\r\nand  educational infrastructures.  Development expenditure  will\r\n\r\nrise  further  to 7.5% of GDP in FY98 as implementation  of  the\r\n\r\nEducation  IT  Master  Plan,  North-East  MRT  Line   and   land\r\n\r\nreclamation  programmes  accelerate.   These  expenditures   are\r\n\r\nexpected to peak in FY99.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite slower revenue growth and higher development\r\n\r\nspending, the forecast surplus of 1.7% of GDP will allow  us  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  with the policy of adding to our surpluses each  year.\r\n\r\nThe  need  to  build up our financial reserves  cannot  be  over\r\n\r\nemphasised.   The  regional crisis has clearly demonstrated  the\r\n\r\nimportance of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  reserves,  especially for a small and  open  economy  like\r\n\r\nours.  If not for our strong fiscal and reserves positions,  our\r\n\r\ncurrency  and  stock market would have been much  more  severely\r\n\r\naffected  by  the  fallout  from  the  financial  crisis.    The\r\n\r\ncomfortable reserves position which we enjoy today is the result\r\n\r\nof  prudent fiscal policies steadfastly pursued in the  past  30\r\n\r\nyears.  We are committed to continuing with these policies,  and\r\n\r\nremain  confident  that our strong fundamentals  will  carry  us\r\n\r\nthrough the current financial turmoil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the FY98 budget, substantial increases in\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  expenditure  will  provide  stimulus  to  offset\r\n\r\nslowdowns  in sectors affected by the regional crisis.  Although\r\n\r\nGDP  growth is expected to slowdown substantially this  year,  a\r\n\r\ndecline  to  negative growth is not foreseen, so major  stimulus\r\n\r\ninitiatives  are not contemplated at this time.  Our  tax  rates\r\n\r\nremain competitive and no major tax changes will be made against\r\n\r\na   background  of  declining  revenue  collections  and  rising\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditures.  However, as the economic  outlook  in\r\n\r\nthe   region  this  year  is  volatile  and  unpredictable,  the\r\n\r\nsituation  will  be  closely monitored.  If  a  sudden  downturn\r\n\r\nshould take place, Government will not hesitate to respond  with\r\n\r\noff-budget measures, as we have more than adequate resources  to\r\n\r\ncope  with  any eventuality.  In the interim, we will make  some\r\n\r\nadjustments  to  lower the cost for businesses.   We  will  also\r\n\r\nprovide  some assistance to individuals and households  to  help\r\n\r\nthem tide through a more difficult year. I will elaborate on the\r\n\r\ndetails  later.  In addition, we will continue to fine-tune  our\r\n\r\ntax incentives to promote activities with high growth potential.\r\n\r\nIn  particular, there will be a package of incentives to promote\r\n\r\nthe development of the financial sector.  These refinements will\r\n\r\nsharpen  our  competitive edge and ensure that when  the  region\r\n\r\nrecovers,   we   will  be  ready  to  take  advantage   of   the\r\n\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal first with the tax changes for companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TAX CHANGES FOR COMPANIES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>Tax Incentives to Promote Fund Management</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, fund managers approved under the Tax Exemption\r\n\r\nScheme for Fund Management enjoy a concessionary tax rate of 10%\r\n\r\non  the fee income earned from managing non-resident funds.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  fund managers which manage at least $5 billion  worth\r\n\r\nof non-resident funds can also enjoy a reduction in the tax rate\r\n\r\nto  5%  on  the  incremental  income earned  compared  with  the\r\n\r\nprevious year.  Further, those which manage at least $10 billion\r\n\r\nof non-resident funds are totally exempt from tax for the income\r\n\r\nearned  from managing non-resident funds.  These tax incentives,\r\n\r\ncoupled  with  the  Government's decision to place  more  public\r\n\r\nfunds  with the private sector for management, have boosted  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  our fund management industry.  In 1996 alone,  total\r\n\r\nfunds managed by financial institutions in Singapore jumped  45%\r\n\r\nto  reach  $125  billion.  While growth in the  fund  management\r\n\r\nindustry  may have slowed somewhat amidst the current  financial\r\n\r\nturmoil,   we  remain  optimistic  about  Singapore's  long-term\r\n\r\npotential  as a major fund management centre in the  region.   I\r\n\r\nhave  therefore decided to introduce further measures to enhance\r\n\r\nthe  competitiveness  of  the industry.   These  complement  the\r\n\r\ninitiatives  to promote the fund management industry,  announced\r\n\r\nby DPM Lee on Thursday, 26th February.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage more fund managers to expand their operations\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, I have decided to lower the threshold requirement\r\n\r\nto  qualify  for  the full tax exemption.  Fund  managers  which\r\n\r\nmanage at least $5 billion of non-resident funds will now  enjoy\r\n\r\nthe  full tax exemption for fee income earned from managing non-resident  funds for a period of 5 years.  This will replace  the\r\n\r\nexisting  concessionary tax rates of 5 and 0% for fund  managers\r\n\r\nwhich  manage  $5 billion and $10 billion worth of  non-resident\r\n\r\nfunds  respectively.  For those which already manage $5  billion\r\n\r\nof  non-resident  funds  and  have made  strong  commitments  to\r\n\r\nfurther  increase their level of fund management  activities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  longer  exemption period of up to 10 years may be considered.\r\n\r\nIn  addition, fund managers which manage less than $5 billion of\r\n\r\nnon-resident funds may qualify for the tax exemption for up to 5\r\n\r\nyears  if  they  increase  their fund management  activities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  substantially.  MAS will negotiate  these  conditions\r\n\r\nwith  individual fund managers, on a case-by-case basis, in  the\r\n\r\nsame  way  that  EDB  negotiates pioneer status  and  investment\r\n\r\nallowance awards with individual companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new incentive scheme will be effective from Year of\r\n\r\nAssessment 1999 and will be reviewed after 5 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Tax Incentives to Promote the Bond Market</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has grown in importance as a regional centre for\r\n\r\nthe issue of bonds and other debt securities.  However, our bond\r\n\r\nmarket is still less developed compared to our equity market  as\r\n\r\nmost  corporations  still prefer to raise funds  through  equity\r\n\r\nlisting  on the stock exchange or through direct borrowing  from\r\n\r\nbanks.   This  is  generally true of most markets  in  Asia.   A\r\n\r\nvibrant  bond market is important to the overall development  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  an  international  financial  centre.    I   have\r\n\r\ntherefore  decided  to  introduce a  package  of  incentives  to\r\n\r\npromote  the development of an active bond market in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThey are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) tax exemption on fee income earned by financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions  in  Singapore from arranging  debt  securities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, including the underwriting and distribution  of  such\r\n\r\nsecurities;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a 10% concessionary rate of tax on interest income\r\n\r\nearned  by  financial institutions and corporations in Singapore\r\n\r\nfrom  debt  securities  arranged by  financial  institutions  in\r\n\r\nSingapore;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) tax exemption on interest from debt securities\r\n\r\narranged  by financial institutions in Singapore and  earned  by\r\n\r\nnon-  residents who do not have any permanent establishments  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The exemption will apply automatically to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndebt  securities which meet the criteria.  There will be no need\r\n\r\nto seek approval for the tax exemption for each debt issue as is\r\n\r\ncurrently the case; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) a 10% concessionary rate of tax on income earned by\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions  in  Singapore  from  trading  in   debt\r\n\r\nsecurities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new tax treatment for fee and interest income will\r\n\r\napply  to  debt  securities issued within a period  of  5  years\r\n\r\ncommencing 28th February 1998.  The incentive for income  earned\r\n\r\nfrom trading in debt securities will be granted for a period  of\r\n\r\n5 years from 28th February 1998.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Taxation of Unit Trusts</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1995 Budget, I introduced a tax incentive to promote\r\n\r\nthe  domestic unit trust industry.  Under this incentive, income\r\n\r\nexcept  Singapore dividends received by a designated unit  trust\r\n\r\nwould  be  taxed at the time of distribution instead of  at  the\r\n\r\ntime  when the income was received by the trustee.  The trustees\r\n\r\nare   however   required  to  withhold  tax   on   the   taxable\r\n\r\ndistributions.   The  incentive also  granted  a  concession  to\r\n\r\nresident individual unit holders who were taxed only on  10%  of\r\n\r\nthe  distributions  made  out  of gains  from  the  disposal  of\r\n\r\nsecurities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make investments in unit trusts more attractive to\r\n\r\nresident  individuals, I have decided to remove the tax  imposed\r\n\r\non resident individual unit holders for 10% of the distributions\r\n\r\npaid out of gains from the disposal of securities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, to simplify the management of unit trusts, I have\r\n\r\nalso  decided to remove the withholding requirement  on  taxable\r\n\r\ndistributions  made  to unit holders who are  tax  residents  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Unit holders who are tax residents are however still\r\n\r\nliable to pay tax on the distributions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes will take effect from 28th February 1998.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Tax Exemption Scheme For Syndicated Offshore Credit And Underwriting Facilities</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax exemption scheme for syndicated offshore credit and\r\n\r\nunderwriting facilities was introduced to promote the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment   of  loan  and  debt  syndication   activities   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Under  the  scheme,  income  earned  by   financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions  in  Singapore from arranging and participating  in\r\n\r\nsyndicated facilities denominated in foreign currencies for non-resident  borrowers is exempt from tax.  The scheme has resulted\r\n\r\nin  the  growth  of the loan and debt syndication activities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In the past three years, an average of $13.5 billion\r\n\r\nof  such facilities were syndicated by financial institutions in\r\n\r\nSingapore annually.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme is due to expire on 31st March 1998. I have,\r\n\r\nhowever,  decided  to  extend it for  another  five  years.   In\r\n\r\naddition, I have also decided to extend the scheme to credit and\r\n\r\ndebt  facilities which are syndicated by financial  institutions\r\n\r\nin  Singapore for Singapore borrowers, provided the funds raised\r\n\r\nare used outside Singapore.  These measures will help to further\r\n\r\ndevelop  the  syndication market in Singapore.  They  will  take\r\n\r\neffect from 1st April 1998.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Tax  Deduction for General Provisions Made by Banks and Merchant Banks</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1991, we introduced an incentive to encourage banks and\r\n\r\nmerchant banks to build up their level of general provisions  as\r\n\r\na  cushion  against  unexpected losses.  Each  year,  banks  and\r\n\r\nmerchant  banks  are allowed to claim tax deduction  on  general\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  up  to  25% of qualifying  profits  or  0.5%  of\r\n\r\nqualifying loans and investments, whichever is lower.  For  each\r\n\r\nbank  or  merchant  bank,  the level of tax  deductible  general\r\n\r\nprovisions  on a cumulative basis cannot exceed 3% of qualifying\r\n\r\nloans and investments.  Many banks and merchant banks have taken\r\n\r\nadvantage   of   this  incentive  to  build  up  their   general\r\n\r\nprovisions.   This  has  helped  to  enhance  the  soundness  of\r\n\r\nindividual  banks  and merchant banks, and  also  the  financial\r\n\r\nsystem,  especially  during this period  of  regional  financial\r\n\r\nturbulence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage banks and merchant banks to further build up\r\n\r\ntheir  general provisions, I have decided to temporarily suspend\r\n\r\nthe  annual  limits  of 25% of qualifying profits  and  0.5%  of\r\n\r\nqualifying loans and investments for a period of two years\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  effect from Year of Assessment 1998.  This will give banks\r\n\r\ngreater  flexibility  to  make as  much  general  provisions  as\r\n\r\npossible  to cushion against potential losses arising  from  the\r\n\r\nregional  financial difficulties.  The overall limit  of  3%  of\r\n\r\nqualifying loans and investments, which was raised from 2%  last\r\n\r\nyear, will remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Extension of Tax Holiday for SIMEX</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore International Monetary Exchange Limited\r\n\r\n(SIMEX)  was  granted a 5-year tax holiday  when  it  was  first\r\n\r\nestablished in 1984.  The tax holiday was extended in  1988  and\r\n\r\nagain  in  1993  for additional 5-year periods  to  support  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  SIMEX.  The incentive has enabled  the  Exchange  to\r\n\r\nbuild up its reserves and improve on its trading infrastructure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIMEX is currently the foremost financial futures exchange\r\n\r\nin  the Asian time zone for the trading of international futures\r\n\r\nand  options  contracts.  But there is no room for  complacency.\r\n\r\nIn  order to meet the challenges of global competition  and  the\r\n\r\nemergence of other exchanges in the region, SIMEX must  continue\r\n\r\nto  improve  on  its  facilities and  strengthen  its  financial\r\n\r\nreserves.   I  have therefore decided to extend the tax  holiday\r\n\r\nfor SIMEX by another 5 years to the year 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Extension of Venture Capital Incentives</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been actively promoting the venture\r\n\r\ncapital  industry  since the mid-1980s.  Venture  capital  funds\r\n\r\nmanaged in Singapore have reached $7.7 billion as at end of last\r\n\r\nyear.   Currently, venture capital funds enjoy tax exemption  on\r\n\r\nthe   gains  from  disposal  of  investments,  and  on   certain\r\n\r\ninvestment incomes for a maximum of 10 years.  At the same time,\r\n\r\nfund management companies which manage venture capital funds are\r\n\r\nawarded pioneer status for managing these funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current 10-year limit may be too restrictive for some\r\n\r\ninvestments which have maturity periods which are longer than 10\r\n\r\nyears.   I  have  therefore decided to extend the tax  incentive\r\n\r\nenjoyed by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nventure  capital  funds, on a case-by-case basis,  by  up  to  a\r\n\r\nfurther  5  years beyond the current maximum of 10 years.   This\r\n\r\nwill  encourage  venture capital funds to  take  a  longer  term\r\n\r\nperspective  of  their  investments and  to  minimise  premature\r\n\r\ndivestment.  The extension will take the form of a concessionary\r\n\r\ntax  rate  of not more than 10%.  The fund management  companies\r\n\r\nwhich  manage  these venture capital funds will also  in  tandem\r\n\r\nenjoy concessionary tax rate under the Development and Expansion\r\n\r\nIncentive  beyond  the  tenth  year.   The  changes  will   take\r\n\r\nimmediate effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Transport and Logistics</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our transport and logistics network has played a pivotal\r\n\r\nrole   in   Singapore's  development  as  a   global   city   of\r\n\r\ninternational trade.  Today, the transport and logistics  sector\r\n\r\ncontributes 9% to GDP and employs more than 110,000  workers  or\r\n\r\nabout  7%  of  our  work force.  As an industry  which  provides\r\n\r\nessential  support to our trade sector, it needs  to  constantly\r\n\r\nevolve  new  and  improved services to meet the demands  of  the\r\n\r\ntrade.   Our  continued growth as a global city of international\r\n\r\ntrade and hub port also depends critically on the development of\r\n\r\na  transport  and logistics sector with extensive networks.   To\r\n\r\nencourage  major  transport and logistics operators  to  further\r\n\r\nexpand their businesses in Singapore and use Singapore as a base\r\n\r\nfor  their operations, I have therefore decided to introduce the\r\n\r\nfollowing tax concessions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(a) Tax Exemption for Income Derived from Uplift of Freight</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, tax is levied on the uplift of cargoes from\r\n\r\nSingapore, except for Singapore-flagged vessels and vessels from\r\n\r\ncountries  with  which Singapore has signed a  tax  treaty.   To\r\n\r\nfurther boost Singapore's development as an international  cargo\r\n\r\nand  shipping  hub,  I have decided to exempt non-resident  ship\r\n\r\nowners  and  charterers from tax on their  freight  uplift  from\r\n\r\nSingapore.   This  benefit  will also be  extended  to  resident\r\n\r\nshipping companies and companies under the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approved International Shipping Enterprise Scheme. Removal of\r\n\r\nthe tax on freight uplift would allow shipping companies greater\r\n\r\nflexibility in planning their shipping schedules and operations.\r\n\r\nThe exemption will take effect from Year of Assessment 1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(b) Tax Concession for International Freight and Logistics Operators</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has a long history as the main shipping and\r\n\r\ndistribution  hub  in the region.  To further  enhance  our  hub\r\n\r\nstatus, I have decided to introduce a tax incentive to encourage\r\n\r\ninternational   freight  service  providers  to   expand   their\r\n\r\nactivities  in Singapore.  This incentive will be  available  to\r\n\r\nship   agencies,   ship  management  companies   and   logistics\r\n\r\nproviders.  To qualify for the incentive, the company must  have\r\n\r\nsubstantial operations and a good track record in the  provision\r\n\r\nof  freight and logistics services.  Companies that qualify will\r\n\r\nbe  accorded  a concessionary tax rate of not less than  10%  on\r\n\r\ntheir  incremental income. The incentive will be granted  for  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  five  years  and  will  take  effect  from  Year  of\r\n\r\nAssessment 1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>c) Tax Exemption for Income Derived From Writing Offshore Marine Hull and Liability Insurance Business</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that Asian shipping companies own more than\r\n\r\n40%  of  world shipping tonnage today.  Singapore is well placed\r\n\r\nto  serve  the  marine insurance needs of the companies  in  the\r\n\r\nregion,  particularly  in  the  provision  of  marine  hull  and\r\n\r\nliability  insurance.  I have therefore decided to  exempt  from\r\n\r\ntax  the  income  derived by approved insurance  companies  from\r\n\r\nwriting  offshore  marine hull and liability insurance  business\r\n\r\nfor  a  period of 10 years.  The incentive would allow insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  tap  the  insurance  potential  of  the  shipping\r\n\r\ncommunities in the region.  It would also complement Singapore's\r\n\r\ndevelopment as a shipping hub.  This concession will take effect\r\n\r\nfrom Year of Assessment 1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Tax Incentive For Exhibition Organisers</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is currently a major venue for international\r\n\r\nexhibitions and trade fairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven  our  strategic location and excellent infrastructure,  we\r\n\r\nare  well positioned to develop into an International Exhibition\r\n\r\nCity.   To  provide  further impetus to the development  of  the\r\n\r\nexhibition  industry,  I have decided that  approved  exhibition\r\n\r\norganisers will be granted a concessionary tax rate of not  less\r\n\r\nthan 10% on their incremental income.  The incentive will enable\r\n\r\nexhibition  organisers  to  offer  better  quality  and   bigger\r\n\r\nexhibitions  and  trade  fairs  to  the  international  business\r\n\r\ncommunity.   The  incentive  will  take  effect  from  Year   of\r\n\r\nAssessment 1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Approved Cyber-Trader Scheme</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in technology have revolutionised the mode of\r\n\r\nbusiness transactions.  Internet, for example, is set to  change\r\n\r\nthe  way companies conduct their businesses.  The value of goods\r\n\r\nand services currently being traded on the Internet is estimated\r\n\r\nat  US$46 billion.  It is expected to grow to between US$200-300\r\n\r\nbillion by the year 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internet electronic commerce holds many opportunities for\r\n\r\nbusinesses.  The financial and logistics sectors will gain  from\r\n\r\nthe  increased international trading generated by this new  mode\r\n\r\nof transaction.  The media and communications sectors, including\r\n\r\nadvertising,  information technology, and content creation  will\r\n\r\nalso  benefit from this development.  Local companies  can  take\r\n\r\nadvantage of this new medium to expand their businesses  to  the\r\n\r\nregion  and  beyond  through  direct  marketing  and  other  new\r\n\r\nstrategies.  Foreign companies can also use Singapore as a test-bed for broadband applications and a launch pad for its Internet\r\n\r\ntrading activities in the region.  The uniqueness of Asia  calls\r\n\r\nfor  a  hub  that  can  service this time  zone,  and  meet  its\r\n\r\ndistribution and consumer needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is well placed to become an electronic commerce\r\n\r\nhub.   To  tap this growing market, I have decided  to  grant  a\r\n\r\nconcessionary tax rate of 10% on offshore trading income derived\r\n\r\nfrom  transactions  made over the Internet  under  the  Approved\r\n\r\nCyber Trader Scheme for companies that qualify.

In  support  of\r\n\r\nthis,  I  have  decided to allow companies to claim  double  tax\r\n\r\ndeduction  for  approved  relocation  and  recruitment  expenses\r\n\r\nincurred  in the hiring of talent from abroad.  The  double  tax\r\n\r\ndeduction  will  help to offset the extra costs which  companies\r\n\r\nhave  to  bear in employing such talent to supplement our  local\r\n\r\nwork  force.

Exposure to excessive noise  can\r\n\r\ncause hearing loss, while overexposure to harmful chemicals  may\r\n\r\nresult  in  poisoning and diseases.

Notwithstanding the expected slowdown in  the\r\n\r\neconomy,  I am pleased to confirm that the Government  will  pay\r\n\r\nthe  final  instalment  of  the Pre-Medisave  Top-Up  Scheme  in\r\n\r\nJanuary 1999 as scheduled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top-up will be paid into the CPF Medisave accounts of\r\n\r\neligible  Singaporeans who are 64 years or older  on  1st  April\r\n\r\n1998.   As  with  the third instalment, the co-payment  required\r\n\r\nwill  only be $20, instead of $50 for the first two instalments.\r\n\r\nThe lower co-payment is to help as many elderly Singaporeans  as\r\n\r\npossible  to  benefit  from  the scheme  while  maintaining  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  that  health  care should be a  joint  responsibility\r\n\r\nbetween  the  individuals, their families  and  the  Government.\r\n\r\nEligible  recipients  will have to make the  co-payment  of  $20\r\n\r\nbetween  1st  July 1998 and 31st December 1998  into  their  CPF\r\n\r\nMedisave  Account.  The Government will match this  $20  with  a\r\n\r\ncontribution of $100 to $350 depending on the age group. 250,000\r\n\r\nsenior  citizens qualify for this scheme and the total  cost  of\r\n\r\nthis, if fully taken up, is $70 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Revision of CPF Interest Rates for Special and Retirement Accounts & Voluntary Transfer of CPF Savings from Ordinary Account to Special Account</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the CPF Special Account and Retirement Account\r\n\r\nboth  receive an interest rate premium of 1.25% over  and  above\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinary Account.  From 1st July 1998, the Government  will\r\n\r\nraise the interest rate premium for these two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccounts   by  a  quarter percentage point, to 1.5%,  above  the\r\n\r\nOrdinary  Account interest rate.  This is to enable CPF  members\r\n\r\nto achieve a higher rate of saving in these two accounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, from 1st July 1998, CPF members will be given\r\n\r\nthe  option  of  transferring their savings  from  the  Ordinary\r\n\r\nAccount  to the Special Account.  These transfers will be  on  a\r\n\r\nvoluntary  basis.   The amount that can be transferred  will  be\r\n\r\nsubject to a cap of $40,000 in the Special Account, that  is,  a\r\n\r\nCPF  member  can  only  transfer up to  the  difference  between\r\n\r\n$40,000  and  his  Special Account balance at the  time  of  the\r\n\r\ntransfer.   The  $40,000 limit is equal  to  the  eventual  cash\r\n\r\ncomponent of the CPF Minimum Sum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transferred funds will form part of the Special Account\r\n\r\nand  will  enjoy  the  higher interest rate  applicable  to  the\r\n\r\naccount.  However, the transferred funds will be subject to  all\r\n\r\nexisting  CPF  rules  on  the  Special  Account,  including  the\r\n\r\nrestrictions  on  the  use  and withdrawal  of  funds  from  the\r\n\r\naccount.  Also, all such transfers from the Ordinary Account  to\r\n\r\nthe  Special Account will not be reversible.  CPF members should\r\n\r\ntherefore consider carefully before making such transfers to the\r\n\r\nSpecial Account to earn higher interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two changes to the CPF will help CPF members enhance\r\n\r\ntheir  retirement cash savings.  They are estimated to cost  the\r\n\r\nGovernment more than $100 million per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>OTHER TAX CHANGES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Property Tax Rebate</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help ease cost pressure on companies, I have decided to\r\n\r\ngive  a 15% rebate for commercial and industrial properties  for\r\n\r\nthe  year  commencing July 1998.  The revenue loss to Government\r\n\r\nis  estimated to be $145 million.  HDB, JTC and other Government\r\n\r\nagencies  owning properties will pass on most of this rebate  to\r\n\r\ntheir   tenants.    The  Government  also  strongly   encourages\r\n\r\nlandlords  to  do  likewise, and pass on at least  half  of  the\r\n\r\nrebate to their tenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Property Tax Exemption for Land Under Development</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1986 and 1995, land under development was exempted\r\n\r\nfrom  property  tax.   The  exemption  was  introduced  to  help\r\n\r\ndevelopers tide over the economic downturn during the  recession\r\n\r\nyears.  It was subsequently withdrawn after the economy and  the\r\n\r\nproperty  market  had shown strong recovery.   In  view  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  difficulties  faced  by the  property  sector,  I  have\r\n\r\ndecided  to reinstate the property tax exemption for land  under\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  The  exemption will be for a period  of  up  to  5\r\n\r\nyears,  and will apply from the time construction begins to  the\r\n\r\ntime  the Temporary Occupation Permit is granted.  The exemption\r\n\r\nwill  take  immediate effect.  The estimated revenue  loss  from\r\n\r\nthis measure is $200 million a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Stamp Duties</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, stamp duty is levied on a variety of instruments\r\n\r\nspecified in the First Schedule of the Stamp Duties Act.  In the\r\n\r\n<br><br>1996&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget,  stamp  duty  was  abolished  on  13   types   of\r\n\r\ninstruments.   To  further  reduce costs  and  inconvenience  to\r\n\r\nbusinesses  and  members  of  the public,  stamp  duty  will  be\r\n\r\nabolished  on all instruments, except for those which relate  to\r\n\r\nstock  and  shares,  and  immovable properties.   The  estimated\r\n\r\nrevenue  loss  from these changes is $33 million.   The  changes\r\n\r\nwill take effect from 28th February 1998.

In support of the national  effort  to\r\n\r\ndiscourage  smoking, particularly among the younger  population,\r\n\r\nthe  excise duty on cigarettes will be raised from $115 to  $130\r\n\r\nper kilogram.

It  will\r\n\r\ncommence on 1st April 1998 on the East Coast Parkway (ECP),  and\r\n\r\nwould be phased in to other parts of Singapore over the next two\r\n\r\nyears.   In  conjunction with the introduction of the  ERP,  the\r\n\r\nvehicle tax structure will be rationalised and a package of road\r\n\r\ntax rebates will be given.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes in road tax structure and the road tax rebate\r\n\r\npackage  will result in a revenue loss of about $1  billion  for\r\n\r\nthe Government for the next 5 years.

The\r\n\r\npolicy  measures  introduced in this budget  are  based  on  our\r\n\r\nassessment of the present state of the Singapore economy and the\r\n\r\noutlook  for  the year.  They assume that no major changes  will\r\n\r\noccur in the external economic environment which will affect  us\r\n\r\ndrastically.   But we cannot be certain how the  situation  will\r\n\r\ndevelop.   The Government will monitor the regional  environment\r\n\r\nand economic conditions vigilantly, and keep in close touch with\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector.  If the picture changes, we are  ready  to\r\n\r\nimplement  further measures promptly.  We have the resources  to\r\n\r\ndo  so.  We  cannot  totally neutralise  the  fallout  from  the\r\n\r\nregional  crisis, but we will do everything possible  to  offset\r\n\r\nits impact on Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businesses and individuals must prepare themselves for a\r\n\r\nperiod of slower growth and uncertainty.  They must be ready  to\r\n\r\nrespond to unanticipated developments, and not flinch from tough\r\n\r\nmeasures  where warranted.  Our best approach is to  acknowledge\r\n\r\nthe  realities of the situation, however adverse  they  may  be.\r\n\r\nThis maximises our chances of surmounting the problems.  It also\r\n\r\ndemonstrates  to  investors  and analysts  our  preparedness  to\r\n\r\ntackle problems directly rather than evading them.  This adds to\r\n\r\nconfidence in Singaporeans and in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we stay united in tackling the problems which come our\r\n\r\nway,  we  will  strengthen  our competitiveness,  ride  out  the\r\n\r\ncrisis, and emerge stronger than before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is, \"That Parliament approves the\r\n\r\nfinancial  policy of the Government for the financial  year  1st\r\n\r\nApril,  1998 to 31st March, 1999.\"  In accordance with paragraph\r\n\r\n(1) of Standing Order No. 86, the debate now stands adjourned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate to be resumed on what day, Dr Hu?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Monday, 9th March, 1998, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to Monday, 9th March,\r\n\r\n1998.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Nineteen minutes past Six o'clock pm</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">to Monday, 9th March, 1998.</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1998/19980227/19980227-HA-0680565.htm\">Annexes - ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION ALLOWANCE FOR NOISE CONTROL IN FACTORIES (Cols. 565 - 568)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1998/19980227/19980227-HA-0680569.htm\">Annexes - ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION ALLOWANCES FOR CHEMICAL HAZARD CONTROL IN FACTORIES (Cols. 569 - 572)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1998/19980227/19980227-HA-0680573.htm\">Annex III - INSTRUMENTS WHERE STAMP DUTY IS ABOLISHED (Cols. 573 - 576)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1998/19980227/19980227-HA-0680577.htm\">Annex IV (Cols. 577 - 580)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
