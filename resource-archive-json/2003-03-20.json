Let\r\n\r\nme  continue  with what Mr Ng Ser Miang  had  called  the\r\n\r\ngifted sports classes.  Mr Ng would be glad to know  that\r\n\r\nbesides  Parkview  Primary School,  there  are  11  other\r\n\r\nprimary   schools,   including  Fuchun,   Admiralty   and\r\n\r\nEvergreen Primary schools, involved in this pilot  scheme\r\n\r\nsponsored by the Singapore Sports Council.  Anglican High\r\n\r\nSchool and Temasek Junior College have also started their\r\n\r\nsports  classes.  MOE's approach is to allow schools  the\r\n\r\nautonomy   to  decide  niche  areas,  including   sports,\r\n\r\ndepending on their needs and resources.  However, I would\r\n\r\nlike to clarify that these are not gifted sports classes.\r\n\r\nThe  Sports School, which is scheduled to open  in  2004,\r\n\r\nwill  be in a better position than mainstream schools  to\r\n\r\nlook  after the sports and academic needs of gifted young\r\n\r\nsports  talents.  It is for this reason that MOE supports\r\n\r\nthe establishment of the Sports School by the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCommunity Development and Sports, which determines, among\r\n\r\nothers, the Sports School's entry requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now answer some specific queries from MPs.\r\n\r\nDr  Maliki  suggested  that  the  Ministry  of  Education\r\n\r\nconduct  a study on the profile of the teenagers who  had\r\n\r\nabortions  and  target our sexuality  education  at  this\r\n\r\ngroup  of  teenagers.  Our programme is targeted  towards\r\n\r\nall  pupils  of  different backgrounds and experience  in\r\n\r\nsexuality  matters.  Our main focus is on  education  and\r\n\r\ncharacter building.  Our approach is directed at upstream\r\n\r\nmeasures  and,  hence, proactive in nature.   We  aim  to\r\n\r\nimpart   to  all  pupils  the  necessary  knowledge   and\r\n\r\ninculcate   a  responsible  attitude  towards   sexuality\r\n\r\nissues.  MOE's Sexuality Education Programme was drawn up\r\n\r\nafter studying successful programmes in both Western  and\r\n\r\nAsian  countries.  This programme incorporates strategies\r\n\r\nto  address  the needs of teenagers who are  at  risk  of\r\n\r\nengaging  in  sexual activities that might lead  to  teen\r\n\r\npregnancies and abortions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo asked if schools provide dedicated\r\n\r\nfollow-up services to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents   suspended  from  school.    As   I   mentioned\r\n\r\nyesterday,  the  school would only mete out  disciplinary\r\n\r\naction like suspension, as a last resort, for the student\r\n\r\nto  reflect  on his misbehaviour.  During the suspension,\r\n\r\nthe pupil will be given school assignments to ensure that\r\n\r\ntime is gainfully spent.  Schools tap on professional MOE\r\n\r\ncounsellors  to  work with pupils before and  during  the\r\n\r\nperiod  of his suspension to deal with the root cause  of\r\n\r\nhis  misbehaviour.   Parents are also  involved  in  this\r\n\r\nwhole   process  to  fully  understand  the  purpose   of\r\n\r\nsuspension  and  to  ensure proper supervision  at  home.\r\n\r\nWhen the pupil returns to school, a meeting would be held\r\n\r\nwith him and the parents with the principal, to help  the\r\n\r\npupil  integrate back into school life.  The school would\r\n\r\ncontinue to provide counselling, when necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong asked if our National Education\r\n\r\nprogrammes are kept up-to-date on current developments in\r\n\r\nnational  and  global  issues,  like  terrorism  and  the\r\n\r\nimpending  Iraq  war.  Yes, definitely.  Current  affairs\r\n\r\nprovide  very  useful  opportunities  to  raise  national\r\n\r\neducation  issues for discussion.  Within the  classroom,\r\n\r\nHistory,  Social  Studies and General Paper  lessons  are\r\n\r\nexamples  of  where  this  may  be  done.   Outside   the\r\n\r\nclassroom, dialogue sessions with senior civil  servants,\r\n\r\nannual   pre-university  seminars  and  various  National\r\n\r\nEducation talks are the usual forum to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema Mathi expressed concern with the continued\r\n\r\nimplementation of National Education and values education\r\n\r\nprogrammes  when  principals  are  rotated  and  changed.\r\n\r\nNational  Education and values education are key features\r\n\r\nof  our  education which are implemented in all  schools.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  the  system and processes for  implementing\r\n\r\nthese programmes are already in place in all our schools.\r\n\r\nOur  principals  and  teachers  will  implement  National\r\n\r\nEducation and values programmes regardless of the schools\r\n\r\nthat they are in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, even as\r\n\r\na young boy, I sensed from my school environment that the\r\n\r\narts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsubject  is  one which is least emphasised.   It  is  the\r\n\r\neasiest  to  handle because faring well in it was  really\r\n\r\ninconsequential, unless, of course, the student hopes  to\r\n\r\nuse  the  arts  subject  marks to  pull  up  his  or  her\r\n\r\ncumulative results, then it becomes useful.  On the other\r\n\r\nhand, parents are also not to be blamed.  They respond to\r\n\r\nthe  environment and prepare their children to  face  the\r\n\r\nfuture  where arts have little to contribute to.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthis  is  what they feel.  In times like this,  my  worry\r\n\r\nincreases  as support and resources for arts and  culture\r\n\r\nare  threatened.   We  have, however,  demonstrated  some\r\n\r\ncommitments when funds are given to private arts  schools\r\n\r\nlike  NAFA  and  LaSalle-SIA.  However, the  real  issues\r\n\r\nremain:   what  is  the position of  arts  in  our  local\r\n\r\nschools?  Are qualified teachers teaching the subject, or\r\n\r\nhas  it been reduced to logistics and available manpower,\r\n\r\nie,  any teacher from any discipline that has an hour  to\r\n\r\nspare   will  end  up  teaching  the  subject?   Are   we\r\n\r\nparticular about standards?  Is it still the first to  be\r\n\r\nsacrificed each time the school is shorthanded?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, I am\r\n\r\npleased  that the Ministry of Education has taken several\r\n\r\ninitiatives over the last three years to improve the pre-school  education here.  In December 2000, MOE  announced\r\n\r\nthe minimum qualification of kindergarten principals.  In\r\n\r\nOctober the following year, the minimum qualification and\r\n\r\ncomposition   of  kindergarten  teachers  were   defined.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, a framework of kindergarten curriculum\r\n\r\nhas  been  introduced  and, finally,  the  MOE  announced\r\n\r\nrecently that the new Kindergarten Education Bill will be\r\n\r\nintroduced in Parliament shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are all aimed at ensuring quality pre-school\r\n\r\neducation for our children.  Some of us will remember the\r\n\r\nstory  of \"Meng Mu San Chian\".  Meng Tze is a very famous\r\n\r\nChinese scholar.  His mother Meng Mu shifted house  three\r\n\r\ntimes  -  not to upgrade from a 3-room flat to  a  4-room\r\n\r\nflat,  to a 5-room flat, and then to an Executive flat  - but  to give her son a better environment to study.  This\r\n\r\ngoes  to  show that the children's education is close  to\r\n\r\nthe hearts of parents.  I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntherefore  welcome the greater attention  given  to  pre-school education here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make three points with regard\r\n\r\nto  pre-school education.  With the introduction  of  the\r\n\r\nnew  criteria  and the framework of curriculum,  we  must\r\n\r\nhave a system to monitor the progress of compliance, even\r\n\r\nthough the curriculum is not compulsory, and I agree that\r\n\r\nit  should  not be made compulsory.  We must be  able  to\r\n\r\nknow which kindergarten has adopted it and which has not.\r\n\r\nThe parents must also know, so that when they enrol their\r\n\r\nchildren, they can make informed choices.  Therefore, can\r\n\r\nwe  consider  some kind of accreditation system  to  give\r\n\r\nrecognition to those who have adopted the system?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, additional financial resources may need to\r\n\r\nbe  given to help the lower income families so that their\r\n\r\nchildren  will not be denied pre-school education.   Pre-school  education is generally more expensive than formal\r\n\r\neducation  because  there is limited Government  funding.\r\n\r\nThe  lower  income families may need help to  keep  their\r\n\r\nchildren in the kindergartens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I hope the introduction of the Kindergarten\r\n\r\nEducation Bill will not imply greater rigidity.  We  must\r\n\r\ncontinue  to encourage creativity and diversity.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Government will continue with its light touch policy\r\n\r\non education, more help and guidance, rather than control\r\n\r\nand regulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although pre-school education is not\r\n\r\ncompulsory, it has become very much a way of life for our\r\n\r\nyounger  families.  With MOE placing greater emphasis  on\r\n\r\nimproving pre-school education, I have no doubt that  our\r\n\r\nyoung  ones  will  benefit from a better  run  pre-school\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\napplaud  the  Ministry  for introducing  a  comprehensive\r\n\r\nframework  to improve pre-school education in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nCurrently, pre-school education is not regulated  by  any\r\n\r\nauthority.    Although  it  is  part  of  the   childcare\r\n\r\nservices, it may be subject to MCDS rules.  The structure\r\n\r\nof pre-school education that exists\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntoday is very much geared towards preparing children  for\r\n\r\nprimary  one.   There  is  a lot  of  focus  on  teaching\r\n\r\nchildren to read, write and count, but very little on how\r\n\r\nto  help  them to acquire the kind of skills and thinking\r\n\r\ncapabilities that are needed to help them deal  with  the\r\n\r\nincreased  complexities, both in our  school  system,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  in life.  However, Sir, to achieve the outcomes\r\n\r\nthat  are  desired  under this new  pre-school  education\r\n\r\nframework,  we  must have teachers with the  quality  and\r\n\r\ncapabilities  to  deliver these new standards.   This  is\r\n\r\nwhere  the  new  pre-school  education  teacher  training\r\n\r\nframework   and  accreditation  of  teachers   are   very\r\n\r\nimportant.   Teacher training will be a big challenge  as\r\n\r\nmany of the existing non-profit kindergartens do not have\r\n\r\nenough qualified teachers based on the new framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another challenge for most kindergartens would be\r\n\r\nhow  to  provide kindergarten teachers with a challenging\r\n\r\ncareer  path.   If our teachers upgrade themselves,  they\r\n\r\nwill  need better motivation and career path compared  to\r\n\r\nwhat currently exists.  Sir, with this revamp of the pre-school education system, there is clearly a need to  look\r\n\r\nat  the  primary school syllabus as there  is  a  linkage\r\n\r\nbetween   the  two.   The  Ministry  has  announced   its\r\n\r\nintention  to  introduce  single  sessions  and   smaller\r\n\r\nclasses  for the lower primaries, and I also look forward\r\n\r\nto  a  revamp of the primary education syllabus  so  that\r\n\r\nthere  is a continuous flow from pre-school education  to\r\n\r\nprimary and to secondary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on parent perception. The research\r\n\r\nthat  was  started  by the Ministry on  the  pilot  group\r\n\r\nindicated that most of the parents are happy with the new\r\n\r\npre-school  education change.  I would like to  ask  that\r\n\r\nthe Ministry continue to focus on reaching out to parents\r\n\r\non   the  new  pre-school  education  syllabus.   My  own\r\n\r\nexperience tells me that there are still many parents who\r\n\r\nlike  the old rote learning method.  Recently, one parent\r\n\r\ncomplained to me that the PCF\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkindergarten did not give enough Chinese spelling to  her\r\n\r\nchild,  compared  to  the private kindergarten  that  her\r\n\r\nchild  was  previously attending.   So,  if  parents  are\r\n\r\ngeared towards one mindset, and the MOE wants to put pre-school  education  on  another track,  there  will  be  a\r\n\r\nmismatch.   One suggestion that I would like to  make  is\r\n\r\nfor  MOE  to  encourage those parents covered  under  the\r\n\r\nsurvey   and  who  had  found  that  the  new  pre-school\r\n\r\neducation  is  better to speak up.  In  this  way,  other\r\n\r\nparents will also be more confident and will support  the\r\n\r\nchanges better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one other concern which parents may have is\r\n\r\nincreased  childcare fees.  The improvements  to  teacher\r\n\r\ntraining  and other teaching methodologies will  increase\r\n\r\nthe  cost of childcare education.  This may be passed  on\r\n\r\nto  parents.   I hope that the Ministry can also  address\r\n\r\nthis  point.   The  bottom  20-30%  of  households,   for\r\n\r\ninstance,  is  very  sensitive to changes  in  prices  of\r\n\r\nkindergarten  education, and may pull out their  children\r\n\r\nif  prices go up.  This would be detrimental to the  very\r\n\r\nchildren whom we are trying to help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also hope that the requirement to license\r\n\r\nkindergartens  and  all costs related  thereto  will  not\r\n\r\ntranslate into higher business cost.  I do ask  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry exercise some restraint in imposing licence fees\r\n\r\nor other costs on kindergarten operators, as again I fear\r\n\r\nthat this will get transferred to parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I support the flexibility granted to\r\n\r\nkindergarten  operators to develop their  own  curriculum\r\n\r\nbased on the broad framework set by MOE.  This is a  step\r\n\r\nin  the  right direction and is in line with the need  to\r\n\r\nprovide greater diversity in pre-school education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I hope that we will achieve the\r\n\r\noutcomes  desired  by the Senior Minister  of  State,  Mr\r\n\r\nTharman,   when  he  described  the  kind  of  pre-school\r\n\r\nchildren  he wants to see - eager to learn, confident  of\r\n\r\nthemselves  and willing to persevere, able to communicate\r\n\r\nwith teachers and classmates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>11.15 am\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> Sir, our education reforms and\r\n\r\ntraining  must  create a globally competitive,  creative,\r\n\r\nemployable   workforce.   Our  system   must   facilitate\r\n\r\nSingapore's   transformation   into   a   knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy, and this system begins with the very young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A growing body of research has identified the\r\n\r\ncomplex  interplay between the brain  and  what  a  child\r\n\r\nlearns from his environment.  And that the young immature\r\n\r\nbrain  is  very open to early experiences, good  or  bad.\r\n\r\nThe  fact is that from the time of conception to the  age\r\n\r\nof  five, a child's brain develops at a faster pace  than\r\n\r\nat any other time in his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Association of Education of Young\r\n\r\nChildren  (NAEYC) in the USA believes that  the  children\r\n\r\nwho  have  high-quality early childhood programmes  \"gain\r\n\r\nskills  that  are normally associated with greater  brain\r\n\r\ndevelopment   such  as  problem  solving  and   language,\r\n\r\nmathematics and literacy skills.\"  They also  gain  other\r\n\r\ncompetencies such as self-control, higher motivation  for\r\n\r\nlearning  and social skills.  Thus, it cannot  be  argued\r\n\r\notherwise   that   pre-school  education   provides   the\r\n\r\nfoundation for learning throughout the child's life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, Sir, I am happy to see new initiatives\r\n\r\nsuch as the PSC grants and plans to uplift the pre-school\r\n\r\nstandard.   They are positive steps.  However, I  believe\r\n\r\nmore needs to be done.  I would encourage the approach to\r\n\r\nbe  more holistic  -  things like preparation for school,\r\n\r\ncharacter    development,   discipline,    the    child's\r\n\r\ninitiative, inquisitiveness, creativity and  so  on.   My\r\n\r\nmessage   is  that  the  same  amount  of  emphasis   and\r\n\r\nimportance that we give to formal education must also  be\r\n\r\ngiven to pre-school education in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, I am glad\r\n\r\nthat  since  I  last spoke on this topic in  last  year's\r\n\r\nCommittee  of Supply, the salary scales for  teachers  of\r\n\r\nspecial   education  (SPED)  schools  have  been  raised,\r\n\r\nalthough a gap still exists\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetween  mainstream and special education  teachers.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  some special education teachers who teach children\r\n\r\nwho  are  more  difficult  to handle  are  given  monthly\r\n\r\npremium allowances. However, I understand that the  whole\r\n\r\nissue   of   lack  of  career  development  and  training\r\n\r\nopportunities   of  special  education   teachers   still\r\n\r\npersists.   In  fact, there is a lack of trained  special\r\n\r\neducation teachers today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do understand that SPED teachers are under the\r\n\r\npurview  of NCSS, and not MOE.  However, I would like  to\r\n\r\nurge  MOE,  as  the Ministry in charge of  education,  to\r\n\r\nspearhead  and coordinate the training of these  teachers\r\n\r\nwho  perhaps  need  even  much more  help,  as  they  are\r\n\r\nhandling children with special needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of secondment of mainstream teachers to\r\n\r\nSPED  schools, I understand that MOE's policy is to limit\r\n\r\nthe  secondment to one or two terms of two years, so that\r\n\r\nthese  seconded teachers do not lose out in their  career\r\n\r\ndevelopment   as  against  their  counterparts   in   the\r\n\r\nmainstream schools.  This is indeed well intentioned  but\r\n\r\nit,  inadvertently, deprives SPED schools of a source  of\r\n\r\ntrained,  dedicated teachers with a compassion  for  SPED\r\n\r\nstudents.   Will  it  not  be  possible  to  accord  such\r\n\r\nteachers  equal  opportunities  to  training  and  career\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and advance, even as they are on  secondment\r\n\r\nto the SPED schools?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another avenue by which SPED schools can have more\r\n\r\naccess  to  the  services of well-trained  teachers  from\r\n\r\nmainstream  schools is to have a roster  of  postings  of\r\n\r\navailable  and  willing mainstream  teachers  to  special\r\n\r\nschools  and  give them hardship allowances  during  this\r\n\r\nposting.   This will facilitate the transfer and exchange\r\n\r\nof   skills  and  knowledge,  which  will  also   benefit\r\n\r\nmainstream schools as the teachers become more conversant\r\n\r\nand  compassionate to children with learning disabilities\r\n\r\nin their midst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also pleased to note that, in recent\r\n\r\nyears,  the  inclusion of high functioning children  with\r\n\r\nspecial  needs into mainstream schools has received  much\r\n\r\nhigher understanding from MOE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1999, there has been one mainstream secondary\r\n\r\nschool  per cluster fitted with facilities to accommodate\r\n\r\nchildren with special needs.  However, a recent study  of\r\n\r\ninclusion  of high functioning hearing-impaired  students\r\n\r\nin  mainstream schools shows that more has to be done  at\r\n\r\nthe  operational level to alleviate some of the  problems\r\n\r\nfaced   by  the  physically  challenged  students.    For\r\n\r\ninstance,  in  one case, a hearing-impaired  student  was\r\n\r\npunished  at the school assembly for not doing  what  she\r\n\r\nwas  told.  In fact, the real reason was that the teacher\r\n\r\ndid  not  know  that she could not hear the  instructions\r\n\r\nclearly  and  thought  she was  acting  up.   A  standard\r\n\r\noperating procedure could have been easily put  in  place\r\n\r\nto  help ensure students with hearing impairment to  hear\r\n\r\nthe  instructions,  say, through a  buddy  system.   More\r\n\r\nattention  and thus resources are needed to  improve  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  structure  and systems of  integration  for  the\r\n\r\nspecial needs children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Sir, there are about 20 special\r\n\r\neducation schools today run by VWOs with funding  support\r\n\r\nfrom   the   Government.   There   are   numerous   other\r\n\r\norganisations running special education services  without\r\n\r\nfunding support.  However, there is a need to do more for\r\n\r\nspecial education.  Sir, I should disclose my interest at\r\n\r\nthis  point that I am a director of Care Corner  Limited,\r\n\r\nwhich is operating a learning clinic for children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to request the Ministry to consider\r\n\r\nthree  areas:  firstly, physical facilities  for  certain\r\n\r\ndisabilities, eg, autism.  There is a rather long waiting\r\n\r\nlist  for  admission into special schools.  I  understand\r\n\r\nthat  the special school at Margaret Drive has a  waiting\r\n\r\nlist  of about 200 and the average waiting time is  about\r\n\r\ntwo  years.  We need to increase the capacity to meet the\r\n\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, teacher training. I agree with Dr Amy Khor\r\n\r\nthat this is an area that we should look into.  I believe\r\n\r\nthat  one  of  the constraining factors is  the  critical\r\n\r\nshortage of qualified teachers for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspecial education.  Therefore, the existing teachers  are\r\n\r\nall  burnt out and this has led to even higher attrition.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem is the low remuneration level and the\r\n\r\nlack  of a career path. The Ministry could look into this\r\n\r\nand  see  how we can help train more teachers in  special\r\n\r\neducation and provide them with a career path within  the\r\n\r\nmainstream, so that they do not lose out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, financial assistance. The real cost of\r\n\r\nproviding  education to children with  special  needs  is\r\n\r\nvery high, sometimes four to five times that for ordinary\r\n\r\neducation.  The actual cost varies depending on the  type\r\n\r\nof  disabilities.   Some  children  may  need  individual\r\n\r\nspecialists   to   help  to  cope  with  their   learning\r\n\r\ndifficulties.   Few can afford this.   The  situation  is\r\n\r\ncompounded by the fact that it is quite common  that  one\r\n\r\nof  the parents has to stop work to help take care of the\r\n\r\nchild.   Many  of them are facing physical and  emotional\r\n\r\nstress today.  Sir, these parents need some help to  cope\r\n\r\nwith  the  situation.   I hope that  the  Minister  would\r\n\r\nconsider  providing additional assistance to the  parents\r\n\r\nto  help  them keep their children in the special schools\r\n\r\nif needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, children are our asset and our hope for the\r\n\r\nfuture.  They are a source of joy to our family life.   A\r\n\r\nsmall  number  of  them, unfortunately, need  some  extra\r\n\r\nhelp.   If  help  is  unavailable,  they  may  drop   out\r\n\r\neventually and become a burden to the family, society and\r\n\r\nthe  nation.   But  if we can offer adequate  and  timely\r\n\r\nhelp, most of them may be able to contribute meaningfully\r\n\r\nto the society, and some of them may even make it back to\r\n\r\nthe mainstream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Fang Ai Lian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I too\r\n\r\nwould like to join the chorus to ask for more support for\r\n\r\nspecial  education.

But the fact\r\n\r\nremains,  as  has been said by Mr Gan, that  there  is  a\r\n\r\nqueue waiting to be admitted to special schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have a wonderful education philosophy\r\n\r\nwhich is to accord free and compulsory education for  all\r\n\r\nour  young up to the age of 12.  We should include  these\r\n\r\nkids  into this catchment as well.  Already, quite a  bit\r\n\r\nhas been done.  We have lowered the age of subsidy from 6\r\n\r\nto  4, recognising the need to address this problem at an\r\n\r\nearly  age,  so that these children can gain  faster  and\r\n\r\nfuller development.  There is also a sum of $200,000  set\r\n\r\naside  to train special teachers, but it would take time.\r\n\r\nAnd  that is the right philosophy.  If we do not have the\r\n\r\nteachers, we cannot establish the schools as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, there is also the cost. It costs a lot\r\n\r\nmore,  $12,000 as opposed to $3,000.  But if we  look  at\r\n\r\nother countries like the US and Australia, they, in fact,\r\n\r\nhave  specialist teachers on a one-to-one basis.  And  we\r\n\r\nshould  also  aim  to  achieve this  benchmark  as  well.\r\n\r\nBecause,  in the past, our expectations were  not  there,\r\n\r\nbut this has changed.  In the past, we might be contented\r\n\r\nto  leave  these children at home and allow  siblings  to\r\n\r\nlook after them.  This is not acceptable any more because\r\n\r\nwe  feel that these kids too can be developed.  They  too\r\n\r\ncan  become  self-reliant and contribute  to  society  as\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge that more should be done for special\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nthank you for allowing me to speak on this topic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the views of Dr Khor, Mr Gan and I like\r\n\r\nwhat  Mrs Fang Ai Lian has said that perhaps it  is  also\r\n\r\ntime  to  step back, take a more macro view of the  whole\r\n\r\narea  of  special education, as we have done for  the  JC\r\n\r\ncurriculum, and look at it from all aspects to  see  what\r\n\r\nmore can be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For today, I would like to raise my concerns where\r\n\r\nthe teachers are concerned and argue for the Ministry of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation  to  take them on board as their own  teachers,\r\n\r\nrather  than le them be managed by the voluntary  welfare\r\n\r\norganisations.   Currently, the  teachers  attend  either\r\n\r\nCertificate  in Special Education or Diploma  in  Special\r\n\r\nEducation courses at the National Institute of Education.\r\n\r\nThe NIE training processes do come under the jurisdiction\r\n\r\nof   the   Ministry  of  Education  through  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nTechnological  University.   The  teachers,  as   already\r\n\r\nmentioned by Dr Khor, do not get salaries that are apple-for-apple  comparisons with those  in  national  schools.\r\n\r\nTeachers  with Second Upper degrees earn about $500  less\r\n\r\nthan those in MOE national schools.  Those with 'A' level\r\n\r\ncertificates  earn about $300 less.  While  they  may  be\r\n\r\nteaching in smaller classes, the demands placed on  these\r\n\r\nteachers are quite high.  And many of these teachers  are\r\n\r\nalso  burnt out, as has been mentioned, and the attrition\r\n\r\nrate is one in five.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 2002, 400 teachers with special\r\n\r\neducation training were teaching 4,200 pupils, in a  1:10\r\n\r\nteacher  pupil ratio.  In the year 2000, there  were  476\r\n\r\nteachers for 3,800 pupils, on a better ratio of 1:8 .  So\r\n\r\nwe  do  have a problem here where attrition is concerned,\r\n\r\nwhere   morale  is  concerned,  and  I  found  it  rather\r\n\r\ninteresting  that  the  special education  teachers  come\r\n\r\nunder  the Singapore Mercantile and Manual Workers Union.\r\n\r\nI  hope  the  union  stands by the aspirations  of  these\r\n\r\nteachers  in  the  same way that the  Singapore  Teachers\r\n\r\nUnion stands by teachers in national schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been mentioned, upgrading for these teachers\r\n\r\nis  very much dependent on the funds available with VWOs.\r\n\r\nVWOs, as we already know, do have a problem sometimes  in\r\n\r\nraising  sufficient funds.   My question to the Ministry,\r\n\r\nbarring  historical reasons as to why these  teachers  do\r\n\r\nnot come under the MOE is:  is it possible to review this\r\n\r\nand   bring  them  on  board?   After  all,  the  primary\r\n\r\nobjective is being fulfilled - that they are training our\r\n\r\nchildren   and  the  training  is  based  on  pedagogical\r\n\r\nprinciples  as  directed  by the Ministry  of  Education.\r\n\r\nThis  means that training programmes, career development,\r\n\r\nsalaries, upgrading,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npromotions can all come under one body rather than, right\r\n\r\nnow,   be  dispersed  over  many  VWOs,  which  may  have\r\n\r\ndifferent systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Braema, wind up your speech,\r\n\r\nplease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Currently, the principals\r\n\r\nof these schools are not on any policy management studies\r\n\r\nprogramme.   The  teachers  are  not  in  the   teachers'\r\n\r\nnetwork, and I think these are great avenues for them  to\r\n\r\nshare information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Kian Min, take your two cuts\r\n\r\ntogether, please.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Sir, I recognise the\r\n\r\nneed  for  schools to be upgraded.  Many of our  schools,\r\n\r\ndesigned  and  built in the previous era, cannot  support\r\n\r\nthe  present  demands.  It is the amount  of  funds  that\r\n\r\nschools  have  to raise that worries me.   Among  my  own\r\n\r\nsmall  circle of family and friends, I know of  not  less\r\n\r\nthan  four schools that are actively raising at least  $3\r\n\r\nmillion  each  through  similar activities  such  as  fun\r\n\r\nfairs, concerts and gala dinners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE pays for 95% of the infrastructure upgrading\r\n\r\ncost.   If  principals of PRIME schools  were  to  adhere\r\n\r\nstrictly to the set of standard specifications, they need\r\n\r\nto  fork  out only the balance 5%.  But that alone  could\r\n\r\nwork  out  to  be $800,000, based on the usual  upgrading\r\n\r\ncost  of $15 million.  However, nowadays, there are  more\r\n\r\nand  more  young and dynamic principals at  the  helm  of\r\n\r\nschools.   They have, and we should motivate and  empower\r\n\r\nthem  to  have, greater expectations of how  an  enriched\r\n\r\nlearning environment can impact the holistic education of\r\n\r\nour  children.   They  require more than  these  standard\r\n\r\nfeatures  and  specifications to creatively  nurture  and\r\n\r\ndevelop  the  students under their charge.  For  example,\r\n\r\nthe  notion that learning is not static gives rise  to  a\r\n\r\ndesire  to  have  desks and chairs of various  sizes  and\r\n\r\nshapes placed in different configurations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  different  activities.  The traditional  classrooms,\r\n\r\nwith  just  a  teacher's desk, with rows  of  tables  and\r\n\r\nchairs and a whiteboard, are not tenable any more.  There\r\n\r\nshould  be storage cupboards, shelves, notice boards  and\r\n\r\nother  \"props\"  in the classroom.  These  are  deemed  as\r\n\r\nextras  and  are not within standard specifications  laid\r\n\r\ndown by MOE.  When we look further at computer or science\r\n\r\nlaboratories, the standard items laid down  a  few  years\r\n\r\nago  are not even required or useful any more.  All  non-standard items or space are to be paid for in full by the\r\n\r\nschools concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>11.30 am\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these difficult economic times, to raise $3-$4\r\n\r\nmillion  takes tremendous efforts and resources,  usually\r\n\r\nled  by  the  principal and teachers and involving  their\r\n\r\nstudents and their families.  The teaching staff  has  to\r\n\r\ndevote  a  disproportionate amount of staff  and  student\r\n\r\nresources, energy and time in these fund-raising efforts.\r\n\r\nWhile  there  are  other  sources  of  funding  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  such  as cluster fund and  innovation  fund,\r\n\r\nthese  are  limited and subject to other rationalisation.\r\n\r\nIf  sufficient  funds  are not  raised  by  the  schools,\r\n\r\nprogress  payments cannot be met and the contractors  may\r\n\r\nstop  work.   If the upgrading programme is held  up  and\r\n\r\nmoving  to  the upgraded school is delayed, the students'\r\n\r\nbenefit and enjoyment of the new facilities will also  be\r\n\r\npostponed.  With the deadline to move out of the  holding\r\n\r\nschool  coming up, there will be an increasing  sense  of\r\n\r\nurgency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be grateful if the Ministry could, firstly,\r\n\r\nreview,   update   and  exercise  some   flexibility   in\r\n\r\nadministering  the  standard  specifications  which  were\r\n\r\nfirst  drawn  up some years ago; secondly,  provide  more\r\n\r\nfunds  for  schools  under  the  PRIME  programme;   and,\r\n\r\nthirdly, help to finance the funding shortfall and  allow\r\n\r\nthe  schools  some  leeway to tide  over  this  difficult\r\n\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to move on to my cut on Edusave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have five school-going children and would like to\r\n\r\nask that the Edusave scheme be extended to cover not just\r\n\r\nthe first three children.  I understand that the original\r\n\r\nreason  for  restricting  Edusave  to  the  first   three\r\n\r\nchildren  is  to discourage those who cannot afford  from\r\n\r\nhaving more children and that parents should not rely  on\r\n\r\nthe  State to pay for the expenses of bringing  up  their\r\n\r\nchildren.   Much has already been said in the  media  and\r\n\r\nForum  pages  on this issue.  Perhaps it is opportune  to\r\n\r\nreview this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Singaporean counts. With only 40,000 live\r\n\r\nbirths last year, every child is important.  Once a child\r\n\r\nis born, we should do our utmost especially in his or her\r\n\r\neducation  so  that he or she can grow up  to  contribute\r\n\r\nmeaningfully  to  society.  If we want to  disincentivise\r\n\r\nthose  who  cannot afford from having more, I believe  we\r\n\r\nshould  do  this  in other ways and not  to  deprive  the\r\n\r\nchildren  of  funds for enrichment.  If we  want  to  use\r\n\r\nmonetary disincentives, there are many other ways we  can\r\n\r\ndo  so,  such  as  not giving dental subsidy  or  student\r\n\r\nconcession for public transport.  So, why Edusave,  where\r\n\r\nthe  money  will  be used for the direct benefit  of  the\r\n\r\nchild by helping him to attend educational and enrichment\r\n\r\ncourses?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister's answer to the above is still \"no\",\r\n\r\nand  the  policy  remains,  may  I  suggest  that  it  is\r\n\r\nadministratively easier for the school if  every  student\r\n\r\nhas  an Edusave account.  For those students who are  not\r\n\r\nentitled  to  the  Government Edusave  contribution,  the\r\n\r\nparents  should  be allowed to voluntarily  top  up  this\r\n\r\naccount.  As an added incentive to have more children,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to suggest that any contribution  made  into\r\n\r\nthis account by the parents should qualify for double tax\r\n\r\nrelief.   After all, one gets double tax relief  for  the\r\n\r\nmaid  levy  and, surely, Edusave is more important.   The\r\n\r\nEdusave account is then treated like a bank account  from\r\n\r\nwhich  the  school  can  deduct  money  to  pay  for  the\r\n\r\nenrichment modules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, at the class level, every student is\r\n\r\ntreated the same way, which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmakes it administratively easier.  Otherwise, there  will\r\n\r\nbe some students making payments by cash or cheque.  From\r\n\r\nmy  experience, when my children brought cheques to their\r\n\r\nteachers  to  pay  for their modules,  the  teachers  had\r\n\r\nthought that they or their parents were mistaken, because\r\n\r\ncash  payment  was  not necessary as the  fees  could  be\r\n\r\ndeducted   from  Edusave.   The  payment   handling   and\r\n\r\nadministration system in the school may not be geared  up\r\n\r\nto  handle cash or cheque, as I am sure children  without\r\n\r\nEdusave are far and few between.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, I would like to request\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry  consider some flexibility  in  three\r\n\r\nareas with regard to the use of the Edusave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first area I would like to ask is with regards\r\n\r\nto   the   use   of  Edusave  for  standard  school   and\r\n\r\nmiscellaneous  fees.   Currently, this  is  not  allowed.\r\n\r\nParents  cannot  use  the  Edusave  for  payment  of  the\r\n\r\nstandard and miscellaneous fees, although for fees  above\r\n\r\nthe  basic  they are allowed to do so.  My  argument  for\r\n\r\nasking that some flexibility be allowed is because of the\r\n\r\ncurrent  economic downturn where a lot  of  parents  face\r\n\r\ndifficulties   in   paying   for   these   standard   and\r\n\r\nmiscellaneous fees.  We could, in fact, allow parents  to\r\n\r\nuse  the  Edusave for payment of these basic fees  for  a\r\n\r\nvery short period.  It may not be for a prolonged period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the rationale why they are not allowed\r\n\r\nto  use  the  Edusave for the standard and  miscellaneous\r\n\r\nfees.  The rationale is that parents should bear part  of\r\n\r\nthe  cost of financing the school fees and also there are\r\n\r\nother  help  schemes available.  But I  think  a  general\r\n\r\npolicy  which allows some flexibility in this area during\r\n\r\na  general  economic downturn, which is pretty severe  as\r\n\r\ncompared to many years that we had in Singapore  of  good\r\n\r\neconomic growth, would be really helpful to parents.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  we have allowed some flexibility in allowing  fees\r\n\r\nabove the basic to be used.  That is already a compromise\r\n\r\non  the  policy.  So I do not see why we would not  allow\r\n\r\nflexibility in terms of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallowing  basic  fees to be used for a  short  period  of\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second flexibility I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  with regard to the portion  of  the  unused\r\n\r\nEdusave   when  a  person  reaches  21  years   of   age.\r\n\r\nCurrently,   what  happens  is  that   that   amount   is\r\n\r\ntransferred  to the person's CPF.  I would  like  to  ask\r\n\r\nthat this amount be transferred to a skill save fund kept\r\n\r\nin the CPF.  His own CPF funds to be used for retirement,\r\n\r\nmedical  and  housing would not be affected.   But  I  am\r\n\r\ntalking about the Edusave portion.  The intention is  the\r\n\r\nsame  -  investment in developing human  resources.   So,\r\n\r\ntransferring from the Edusave to the skills fund  in  CPF\r\n\r\nwill  be  a  perpetuation of that policy  of  encouraging\r\n\r\nlifelong learning as well as encouraging people  to  take\r\n\r\npersonal  responsibility and ownership for investment  in\r\n\r\ntheir own development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third flexibility I would like to ask is the one\r\n\r\nwhich Mr Ong Kian Min had already argued earlier on,  ie,\r\n\r\nto  extend  Edusave use beyond three children.   I  think\r\n\r\nsometimes  the  problem is that the Government  tries  to\r\n\r\nachieve  too  many  objectives under  one  scheme  -  the\r\n\r\nobjective of discouraging people who cannot afford not to\r\n\r\nhave  more  children and the objective  of  investing  in\r\n\r\neducation.   I would argue that the primary objective  of\r\n\r\nEdusave  is  to  invest  in the  education  of  the  next\r\n\r\ngeneration,  so that they are prepared for the  knowledge\r\n\r\neconomy.   Does it really matter, in this case, that  the\r\n\r\nchild  is  a  fourth or a fifth child?  As in any  event,\r\n\r\nthis  child will eventually enter the workforce.  And  if\r\n\r\nhe is ill-equipped and he does not have the skills or the\r\n\r\nqualifications, the Government will have to pay  for  his\r\n\r\nretraining and skills upgrading costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, even looking at it from a purely economic\r\n\r\nperspective, I think it is a rational ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Halimah, could you start wrapping\r\n\r\nup your speech, please?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, I take note of your point.\r\n\r\nI  think  they  need the stimulation, and I really  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the  Ministry to  consider  revising  this\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied):</b> Sir, the role private\r\n\r\ninstitution  plays  in  the education  sector  has  grown\r\n\r\nsignificantly  in  the  last few  years.

Today,  aspiring\r\n\r\nstudents   have   a   diverse  choice   of   professional\r\n\r\ncertificates, graduate or post-graduate programmes.  This\r\n\r\nis  in itself a good thing.  However, my concern is  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  few checks on the private sector institutions\r\n\r\nto ensure that what is taught is actually of good quality\r\n\r\nand useful to their students.  The education landscape is\r\n\r\ncharacterised   by   local   companies   that   act    as\r\n\r\nrepresentatives   of  foreign  institutions   of   higher\r\n\r\nlearning.   In  some  cases, I must  say,  these  foreign\r\n\r\nentities  are of high standards.  However, this does  not\r\n\r\ngive the full picture.  Many private institutions act  as\r\n\r\nre-sellers with the goal of gaining as many enrolments as\r\n\r\npossible.  I have heard that it is now possible to get an\r\n\r\nMBA  in  nine months through an accelerated post-graduate\r\n\r\nprogramme.  Enough examples of this cause me to raise the\r\n\r\nconcern that the quality, content and delivery are highly\r\n\r\nsuspect.

This will ensure  the  reputation  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  as a centre for higher learning  and,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  prevent students from being shortchanged  by\r\n\r\nprivate institutions driven purely by profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nfor the long term survival\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, we must learn to live in harmony with  our\r\n\r\nneighbours, our other ASEAN countries and also  globally.\r\n\r\nWe  must  enhance our international links through various\r\n\r\nsectors,  including through our educational institutions.\r\n\r\nHas the Ministry considered opening up more places in our\r\n\r\nschools  and  institutes of higher learning,  and  invite\r\n\r\nmore  students from Malaysia, Indonesia and  other  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries and from as many countries as possible to study\r\n\r\nhere?  These foreign students should be encouraged,  upon\r\n\r\ncompletion of their tertiary education, to return home so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can be our friends and ambassadors,  as  they\r\n\r\nwill  have a soft spot for Singapore as long as they  had\r\n\r\ngood  experiences  and  fond memories  whilst  they  were\r\n\r\nstudying in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Ministry tell us how many foreign students\r\n\r\nare  studying  in  primary and secondary schools,  junior\r\n\r\ncolleges,   polytechnics  and   universities,   and   the\r\n\r\nbreakdown of students by countries?

In  fact,  children's\r\n\r\neducation  is  factored  into  every  family's  decision-making.   Some  families have chosen to go away  to  seek\r\n\r\neasier education for their kids.  But more disturbing are\r\n\r\nexecutives  not  taking on opportunities to  go  overseas\r\n\r\nbecause  it  would  disrupt their  children's  education.\r\n\r\nAgain, there are also executives who choose not to return\r\n\r\nbecause it is, again, about education - how to get  their\r\n\r\nkids   back  into  the  system  which  they  have   grown\r\n\r\naccustomed  to.  In fact, I have a colleague's  neighbour\r\n\r\nwho was on his way from the US, and because he was unable\r\n\r\nto   get   the   Ministry's  assistance   to   get   into\r\n\r\ninternational  schools, he chose to take another  posting\r\n\r\nto  Hong  Kong  for many years until all  his  children's\r\n\r\neducation was completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we seek to regionalise and globalise, we have got\r\n\r\nto  get  rid  of this education obstacle.  A lot  of  MNC\r\n\r\nchiefs   have  also  said  that  we  have  got  wonderful\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, but the minute they are asked  to  take  an\r\n\r\noverseas  posting, they will say \"no\".  This  is  a  real\r\n\r\nwaste   of   opportunities,  and  in  terms   of   career\r\n\r\nadvancement as well.  We do need people to go overseas to\r\n\r\nget  their  exposure and to get their valuable experience\r\n\r\nand to return to Singapore to contribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>11.45 am\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, the Ministry of Education, in the past\r\n\r\nyear,  has  made  quite a number of concessions  to  help\r\n\r\nfacilitate their return to Singapore and to get  admitted\r\n\r\ninto  international schools.  Added to that is the second\r\n\r\nlanguage  problem  and all this makes  it  difficult  for\r\n\r\nparents  to  consider a posting and return to  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry's  assurance is on  a  case-by-case  basis.\r\n\r\nThis lacks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertainty  and, therefore, is a major obstacle which  has\r\n\r\nto   be   overcome.

Its  reputation  precedes  itself  and   it   is\r\n\r\nprecious.   Currently, the education industry contributes\r\n\r\nabout  $3 billion to our economy, which is about 1.9%  of\r\n\r\nour GDP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, we have been providing lots of\r\n\r\ntraining and technical assistance to our ASEAN neighbours\r\n\r\nand  other  third  world countries.  We  have  built  our\r\n\r\nexpertise  and  gained valuable experience.   Hence,  the\r\n\r\nrespect  that  we now enjoy in the area of education  and\r\n\r\ntraining  is  well earned.  However, this reputation  has\r\n\r\nyet  to be fully exploited.  The time has come for us  to\r\n\r\nreap  the  benefits  of our hard work  by  exporting  our\r\n\r\neducation  as  a  business.  It can  be  our  new  niche.\r\n\r\nEducation  service is big business.  Public education  is\r\n\r\nfocused  on  providing  education  for  Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\nmeeting our manpower and capability requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simultaneously, I strongly suggest that we\r\n\r\nsystematically address the opportunities provided by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  brand of education, and not just leave  it  at\r\n\r\nthat.   Additionally,  we must  also  set  up  a  quality\r\n\r\nassurance  system for the private education  industry  to\r\n\r\nensure  that our brand, which is the Singapore  brand  of\r\n\r\neducation,  does not get tarnished.  It is  precious  and\r\n\r\nmust be preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</b> Sir, a few Members, Mr Gan Kim\r\n\r\nYong, Mdm Halimah and Mr Zainudin, have rightly commented\r\n\r\non the importance of the pre-school education sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are basically two thrusts in MOE's approach to\r\n\r\nuplift the quality of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npre-school  education.  First, we have developed  a  pre-school   curriculum  framework,  emphasising  a  holistic\r\n\r\napproach to development and enhanced interaction  between\r\n\r\nteacher  and  pupil.   The curriculum  framework  is  not\r\n\r\nprescriptive in detail, and MOE does not intend  to  make\r\n\r\nit   a   formal   requirement  for   all   kindergartens.\r\n\r\nKindergartens are, instead, encouraged to  use  it  as  a\r\n\r\nguide   to   design  their  programmes.   This   approach\r\n\r\nencourages   diversity   and  experimentation   as   each\r\n\r\nkindergarten operator strives to shape practices to  meet\r\n\r\nthe needs of its pupils, and to make a mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic idea of the new curriculum framework is to\r\n\r\ndevelop and nurture the child in totality, including  his\r\n\r\nability  to  relate  to  others, to  communicate  and  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  an  enthusiasm  for learning.   I  am  glad  Mdm\r\n\r\nHalimah mentioned parents, and I agree with her fully  on\r\n\r\nthe  need  to  reach  out to them.  Kindergartens  should\r\n\r\nengage with parents and give them the confidence that the\r\n\r\nchanges  they  are  making are in the   interest  of  the\r\n\r\nchild.   MOE  will  help  where it  can.   Mdm  Halimah's\r\n\r\nsuggestion  is a useful one, for wider publicity  of  the\r\n\r\nviews  and comments of parents who have found that  their\r\n\r\nchildren are keen to learn and have benefited as a result\r\n\r\nof the new approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents are not wrong to be concerned about their\r\n\r\nchildren's  future performance in primary school  and  to\r\n\r\nexpect  that  pre-schools provide a good  foundation  for\r\n\r\ntheir  children's schooling.  Basic academic skills  like\r\n\r\nreading, writing and numerical or mathematical skills are\r\n\r\nimportant  in the pre-school years.  They should  not  be\r\n\r\noverlooked.    But   we  want  to  avoid   premature   or\r\n\r\naccelerated learning of the Primary 1 syllabus.  It  does\r\n\r\nnot translate, by and large, into the children being able\r\n\r\nto learn better when they get to the upper primary years,\r\n\r\nlet  alone  the  secondary school years.   More  emphasis\r\n\r\nshould  be placed on development of broader communication\r\n\r\nskills,  such as the ability to ask questions,  to  begin\r\n\r\nthinking  for  themselves, to explore,  or  to  sort  out\r\n\r\npuzzles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are moving towards a more interactive and child-centred pre-school environment with more room for\r\n\r\nchildren to explore and experiment.  But we should  never\r\n\r\nbe purists in our approach to pre-school education.  Good\r\n\r\nkindergarten  teachers adopt more than  one  orientation,\r\n\r\nmore than one method, and they mix and match as they  see\r\n\r\nfit  to  meet the needs of their pupils.  Not all  drills\r\n\r\nare  bad.   After all, most kids learn songs and  nursery\r\n\r\nrhymes  that way, although we sometimes find our children\r\n\r\nsinging away lustily but mispronouncing the words!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thrust is to uplift the quality of the\r\n\r\nteaching  force  in  the  pre-school  sector.   MOE   has\r\n\r\narticulated standards of professional qualifications  for\r\n\r\nall major providers of pre-school education to meet.   To\r\n\r\nanswer Mr Gan Kim Yong's question, good progress has been\r\n\r\nmade  in the number of teachers going for training.   All\r\n\r\nthe  major kindergarten providers should be able to  meet\r\n\r\nthe  target  of  having  all their teachers  certificate-trained,  and  one  in  four of their  teachers  diploma-trained.    In  2002, 43% of kindergarten  teachers  were\r\n\r\ntrained  staff.   By  the  end  of  this  year,  74%   of\r\n\r\nkindergarten teachers would have been trained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan, Mdm Halimah and Mr Zainudin have asked about\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance for families, besides the recurrent\r\n\r\ngrants  for  kindergartens.  Let  me  first  clarify  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  the  recurrent grant scheme.   MOE  provides\r\n\r\nrecurrent    grants    to   help   eligible    non-profit\r\n\r\nkindergartens  to  attract and  retain  better  qualified\r\n\r\nprincipals  and  teachers  in  order  to  meet  the   new\r\n\r\nstandards.  The grants can also be used to provide better\r\n\r\nsupport  for  teachers,  in terms of  administrative  and\r\n\r\nteaching  resources.  In short, the grants are  aimed  at\r\n\r\nhelping  eligible  kindergartens to  raise  quality.   In\r\n\r\nanswer  to Mr Zainudin, we expect to maintain the  grants\r\n\r\nat  this level, but any future adjustments would have  to\r\n\r\ndepend on the availability of resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial assistance for families is a separate\r\n\r\nmatter from these grants to kindergartens.

MOE is currently reviewing the legislation for the\r\n\r\npre-school sector.  The Kindergarten Education Bill  will\r\n\r\nbe introduced in Parliament within a few months.  It will\r\n\r\nset  out  the  licensing  framework  and  emphasises  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  having  qualified teachers  and  a  sound\r\n\r\ncurriculum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min raised the issue of funding for the\r\n\r\nupgrading of infrastructure in Government aided  schools.\r\n\r\nTo-date, the Government has spent about $1 billion on the\r\n\r\nPRIME  programme  to upgrade 146 schools  to  the  latest\r\n\r\nspecifications.  Under PRIME, the Government  funds  100%\r\n\r\nand  95%  of the development cost of upgrading Government\r\n\r\nschools  and  aided schools, respectively, based  on  the\r\n\r\ncost  of standard facilities.  The Government's share  of\r\n\r\nthe  development  cost of Government  aided  schools  has\r\n\r\nincreased significantly over the years, from 50% in  1982\r\n\r\nto 95% today.  The Government also pays for 100% of their\r\n\r\nrecurrent  cost.   It is necessary for  Government  aided\r\n\r\nschools to continue to raise funds to pay for part of the\r\n\r\ncost of development of the schools.  This is to show that\r\n\r\nthe Government aided schools are committed to the project\r\n\r\nand  that  they  enjoy  the support of  their  respective\r\n\r\ncommunities.  If the Government were to pay for  100%  of\r\n\r\nboth  the  capital and recurrent costs of  such  schools,\r\n\r\nthey  would  really be no different from  any  Government\r\n\r\nschool.   Aided schools which find it difficult to  raise\r\n\r\nfunds may wish to review and reprioritise their plans for\r\n\r\nnon-standard facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min and Mdm Halimah asked the Ministry\r\n\r\nto   reconsider  the  existing  restriction  of   Edusave\r\n\r\naccounts to the first three children.  Families  need  to\r\n\r\ntake  into careful account the affordability and expenses\r\n\r\nwhen deciding to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave more than three children.  The allocation of Edusave\r\n\r\naccounts to the first three children remains sensible and\r\n\r\nis a workable approach.  However, I do not want to appear\r\n\r\nblind  to  the  feelings  of Mr Ong's  fourth  and  fifth\r\n\r\nchildren.   In  fact,  my own fourth  child  has  already\r\n\r\ncommunicated  her views to me.   So we  are  prepared  to\r\n\r\nconsider  suggestions as to how we can better handle  and\r\n\r\nmanage  feelings of children, in particular those in  the\r\n\r\nhigher order birth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should emphasise, however, that the Edusave\r\n\r\naccount is only one way in which Singapore pupils benefit\r\n\r\nfrom  the Edusave scheme.  Each year, about half  of  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on the Edusave Endowment Fund  goes  to  the\r\n\r\nEdusave accounts; one quarter to Edusave scholarships and\r\n\r\nawards, and another one quarter to the Edusave grants  to\r\n\r\nschools.  The Edusave scholarships and awards and Edusave\r\n\r\ngrants  to  schools  are  available  to  all  Singaporean\r\n\r\nchildren, regardless of their birth order.  In 2002,  $37\r\n\r\nmillion  was disbursed to 141,400 pupils in the  form  of\r\n\r\nscholarships  and awards.  And another  $35  million  was\r\n\r\ndisbursed to schools in the form of Edusave grants to run\r\n\r\nenrichment programmes for all their pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah has asked MOE to allow greater\r\n\r\nflexibility  in  the  use of funds in  Edusave  accounts.\r\n\r\nCurrently, pupils can already use Edusave funds  for  the\r\n\r\nsecond   tier   miscellaneous  fees.    Families   facing\r\n\r\ndifficulties in paying fees can approach the  school  for\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance.  Various forms of  assistance  are\r\n\r\navailable through the MOE financial assistance schemes or\r\n\r\nother  sources,  such  as  financial  assistance  schemes\r\n\r\nadministered   by  the  School  Advisory  or   Management\r\n\r\nCommittees, and community organisations, such as the CDCs\r\n\r\nand  voluntary welfare organisations.  No child  will  be\r\n\r\ndenied  an  education because of financial  difficulties.\r\n\r\nFurther, when the Edusave account holders reach 21  years\r\n\r\nof  age, any unutilised balance is transferred to the CPF\r\n\r\nOrdinary  Accounts and can be used for all  CPF  approved\r\n\r\nschemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan asked how we are building links\r\n\r\nwith  students from the ASEAN countries.  There are  many\r\n\r\nstudents from ASEAN countries studying in our schools and\r\n\r\ninstitutions.   In  addition,  schools  and  institutions\r\n\r\nparticipate   in  student  exchanges  with  other   ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries.  Between 2001 and 2002, close to 800  students\r\n\r\nfrom  Singapore participated in exchanges and  attachment\r\n\r\nprogrammes  with  post-secondary  institutions  in  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries.   Our students have also actively participated\r\n\r\nin  community involvement programmes in ASEAN  countries,\r\n\r\nsuch  as Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand  and\r\n\r\nVietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Fang Ai Lian has suggested that we allow local\r\n\r\nstudents  who  have  returned  from  overseas  to  attend\r\n\r\nforeign system schools in Singapore.  As far as possible,\r\n\r\nwe  believe  that  all Singaporeans  should  be  educated\r\n\r\ntogether  in  national schools.  That way,  they  can  be\r\n\r\nimbued  with  a  common sense of identity and  a  certain\r\n\r\ncommitment to each other that comes from having grown up,\r\n\r\nplayed  and studied together.  It is difficult to  expect\r\n\r\nthe same spirit of Singaporean-ness to be inculcated in a\r\n\r\nforeign  system  school which will  have  a  majority  of\r\n\r\nforeign  students  and follow a foreign  curriculum.   It\r\n\r\ndoes not work that way in practice.  This is also why  we\r\n\r\ndecided that the opening up of the national school system\r\n\r\nto  two  to  three  privately  funded  schools  would  be\r\n\r\nconditional  upon such schools having a  minimum  of  50%\r\n\r\nSingaporeans in the student population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, MOE does recognise the broad economic\r\n\r\nimperative    of   encouraging   Singapore    firms    to\r\n\r\ninternationalise and Singaporeans to venture  abroad  and\r\n\r\ngain experience.  We have implemented a range of measures\r\n\r\nto  meet  the  educational needs of Singaporean  children\r\n\r\nreturning from overseas.  Parents can apply for leave  of\r\n\r\nabsence  at their children's current school to reserve  a\r\n\r\nplace until the child returns to Singapore.  We have also\r\n\r\nprovided  boarding  awards  to  allow  secondary   school\r\n\r\nchildren  to  stay  in local school-based  hostels  while\r\n\r\ntheir parents were overseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We appreciate that some children who have studied\r\n\r\nabroad  for  a  significant period  of  time  could  face\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in  adapting  and  fitting  back   to   the\r\n\r\neducation  system.  MOE is prepared to  be  flexible  and\r\n\r\nwould consider requests for admission into foreign system\r\n\r\nschools for such children on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin had asked how Singapore's education\r\n\r\nsystem   brand  could  be  used  to  economic  advantage.\r\n\r\nEducation  is  also  one  of the  areas  of  high  growth\r\n\r\npotential identified by the ERC.  IE Singapore has  taken\r\n\r\non  the  role  of  helping our local education  providers\r\n\r\nexport  their  services overseas.  However,  the  primary\r\n\r\nfocus  of  the Ministry of Education must remain  in  the\r\n\r\neducation of students in our national schools.  Where our\r\n\r\ninstitutes   of  higher  learning,  or  our   independent\r\n\r\nschools,  have developed the capability to  export  their\r\n\r\nservices,  they  can do so, as long as they  continue  to\r\n\r\nprovide  high quality education in Singapore and  do  not\r\n\r\ndivert   Government   resources  meant   for   delivering\r\n\r\neducation in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Seh Hong asked about the registration of\r\n\r\nprivate  schools  in Singapore.  I share  his  view  that\r\n\r\ndisreputable education providers will not help us develop\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  an education hub.  However,  MOE  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment are not in a position to review the quality of\r\n\r\nsuch  programmes.   Private education providers  offer  a\r\n\r\ndiverse   range   of   education  programmes,   including\r\n\r\nacademic,  continuing  and  adult  education  and   self-improvement programmes, and often in partnership  with  a\r\n\r\nwide  array of overseas partners.  The market is the best\r\n\r\nregulator  of  such providers.  The range  of  programmes\r\n\r\ncaters  to a diversity of needs as students and employers\r\n\r\nwill  ultimately decide on what value they place on their\r\n\r\nprogrammes  and qualifications.  However,  there  may  be\r\n\r\nsome  scope for some form of industry self-regulation  so\r\n\r\nas  to  enhance  the branding and image  of  the  private\r\n\r\neducation  industry.  I believe IE Singapore is currently\r\n\r\nhelping to facilitate discussions among leading education\r\n\r\nsuppliers in Singapore on matters relating to issues such\r\n\r\nas quality certification and control within the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12.00 noon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b> Sir, let me address Members' concerns about arts and\r\n\r\nspecial education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, arts education. Mr Zainudin has asked what\r\n\r\nMOE's level of support and commitment to this is.  He and\r\n\r\nother  Members  will  be  happy to  know  that  the  arts\r\n\r\neducation  environment promises to be more vibrant  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of a number of recent initiatives.  Firstly,  for\r\n\r\nNAFA  and  LaSalle-SIA College of the Arts, MOE  provides\r\n\r\nthese two arts institutions with per capita funding  that\r\n\r\nis  equivalent to the per student subsidies  received  by\r\n\r\npolytechnics and ITE.  MOE will also be providing funding\r\n\r\nof about $180 million for the development and land needed\r\n\r\nfor  their new permanent campuses, which should be  ready\r\n\r\nby  2004  and 2006 respectively.  Every time I  pass  the\r\n\r\nCentral District, I get a sense of excitement.  With  the\r\n\r\nnew SMU, NAFA and LaSalle-SIA College campuses coming  up\r\n\r\nand  the  Arts Museum, I think the area will add vibrancy\r\n\r\nand a glowing buzz to the arts education milieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with the recommendation for NTU to have a\r\n\r\nschool  of  design, media and art will  allow  interested\r\n\r\nstudents a relevant route to the university.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Mr Zainudin has asked about teachers. MOE\r\n\r\nhas  recently  launched a 4-year Art  and  Music  Teacher\r\n\r\nTraining  Scheme,  together  with  NIE  and  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nAcademy  of  Fine Arts.  This scheme will supplement  our\r\n\r\nexisting  recruitment avenues for  these  teachers.   The\r\n\r\nstructural  and manpower provisions will strengthen  arts\r\n\r\neducation  in Singapore.  Arts education is provided  for\r\n\r\nall  students  in  our schools, through the  general  art\r\n\r\nprogramme and the general music programme.  Students  can\r\n\r\nalso opt to offer art at \"O\" and \"A\" levels, and music at\r\n\r\nthe  \"O\"  and  \"A\"  levels as elective  subjects.   These\r\n\r\nmeasures  will  complement  the  12-cluster  art  centres\r\n\r\nserving  97 schools, and one centre for Chinese orchestra\r\n\r\nmusic serving east\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nzone  schools.  We plan to add 10 more such  cluster  art\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address the queries by various Members on\r\n\r\nspecial  education.  I hear clearly and empathise greatly\r\n\r\nwith  the  calls from Dr Amy Khor, Mr Gan Kim  Yong,  Mrs\r\n\r\nFang  Ai  Lian and Ms Braema Mathiaparanam for compassion\r\n\r\nand for us to do more for these children.  As part of  my\r\n\r\nduties,  I  have  to attend many functions  as  guest-of-honour hosted by these VWOs working in concert with other\r\n\r\nagencies  to  take  care  of our disabled  children.   If\r\n\r\nMembers  have  attended any of these  functions,  Members\r\n\r\nwill  agree with me that the passion is palpable,  often-times heart-wrenching.  Your spirits are both lifted  and\r\n\r\nsaddened;  lifted because of the individual  stories  and\r\n\r\nthe  bravery they showed to take care of their  children,\r\n\r\nand  sometimes  saddened because of the  inequalities  of\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, through these functions, I have become more and\r\n\r\nmore convinced that the many-helping-hands approach - the\r\n\r\nphilosophical  stance, if you like - that  MOE  takes  in\r\n\r\nproviding  assistance to these VWOs is the  correct  one,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  engages  the  community  and  unleashes  the\r\n\r\npassion  without which we would have made  our  provision\r\n\r\nless  than  effective.  This many-helping-hands  approach\r\n\r\nthat  we  adopted  since 1989 was in response  to  a  key\r\n\r\nrecommendation of the Advisory Council of  the  Disabled,\r\n\r\nwhich  involves  the  Government, family  and  community.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the many-helping-hands approach must  not  mean\r\n\r\nless subsidy or support from MOE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Fang Ai Lian and Mr Gan Kim Yong have both asked\r\n\r\nfor more to be done in the area of special education.  We\r\n\r\nwill  try  our  best.  MOE, together  with  the  National\r\n\r\nCouncil  of Social Services, has increased the number  of\r\n\r\nSPED schools run by VWOs from 11 to 19.  Today, these  19\r\n\r\nSPED  schools  provide education for about 4,004  pupils,\r\n\r\ndouble   the   figure  in  1989.   MOE  has   started   a\r\n\r\nredevelopment  programme  to improve  the  facilities  of\r\n\r\nthese schools.  Once redeveloped, these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschools  will be purpose-built with facilities customised\r\n\r\nto  their specific needs.  Within the last four years, we\r\n\r\nhave  completed  the redevelopment of four  of  these  19\r\n\r\nschools.   MOE provides capital funding for  90%  of  the\r\n\r\nconstruction cost for this redevelopment programme at  an\r\n\r\nestimated cost of about $100 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members said that there was a queue for these\r\n\r\nschools.   That is not quite correct.  There is  actually\r\n\r\nno  queue  for any child with special disability,  except\r\n\r\nfor  autism.   For autism, it is a world-wide phenomenon.\r\n\r\nFrom the medical point of view, we are not sure why there\r\n\r\nhas  been a sudden rise.  Mrs Fang Ai Lian alluded to it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is more recognition.  Other theories have been\r\n\r\nascribed.  We do not really know why.  There has  been  a\r\n\r\nsudden  ramp  up  and, as Mr Gan said, we  should  expand\r\n\r\ncapacity  for this particular group of children,  and  we\r\n\r\nhave  been trying.  As a result of recent efforts by NCSS\r\n\r\nand  MOE, the number of SPED schools providing programmes\r\n\r\nfor  autism has increased from a previous two to 11.   In\r\n\r\naddition, as Mrs Fang Ai Lian alluded to, we have set  up\r\n\r\na special fund, together with the Autism Resource Centre,\r\n\r\nto  develop  teacher capability in the  SPED  schools  to\r\n\r\nmanage  children with autism.  It is not that  we  cannot\r\n\r\nbuild the buildings; the buildings are there, but we need\r\n\r\nteachers.   As  more teachers are trained, an  additional\r\n\r\n400  children with autism would be catered  for  in  SPED\r\n\r\nschools by 2006.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan said that the cost of education for children\r\n\r\nwith  special needs is very high.  We recognise this and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, SPED schools receive more funding per  student\r\n\r\nfrom MOE and NCSS.  Mrs Fang said indeed quite correctly,\r\n\r\nthat they receive four times the subsidy of a pupil in  a\r\n\r\nmainstream  primary school.  In other words, we  use  the\r\n\r\nchild without disabilities in the mainstream school as  a\r\n\r\nbenchmark, and then we provide four times as much.   That\r\n\r\nworks  out,  as  she said, to $12,000 versus  $3,000  per\r\n\r\nyear.  Eligible pupils who attend these SPED schools also\r\n\r\nreceive a yearly Edusave contribution of $160, like their\r\n\r\ncounterparts in the primary schools, and receive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas well an annual Edusave grant for enrichment programmes\r\n\r\nand purchase of equipment and resource materials.  As for\r\n\r\nthe  fees  charged, they are subject to the  approval  of\r\n\r\nNCSS,  and the NCSS and the VWOs also oversee the welfare\r\n\r\nassistance for needy pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of Members, including Mr Gan Kim Yong, Ms\r\n\r\nBraema Mathiaparanam and Dr Amy Khor, have touched on the\r\n\r\nteachers  in  these  schools.  They have  asked  why  not\r\n\r\nsubsume  these  teachers under MOE.  First  of  all,  the\r\n\r\nprovision of care, while to a great degree is provided by\r\n\r\nour teachers, is not the only avenue of care.  There need\r\n\r\nto  be  a number of elements which will provide for these\r\n\r\nchildren.    There   is  a  balance   between   subsuming\r\n\r\nresponsibility and decreasing stakeholdership.  As I have\r\n\r\nsaid,  the  many-helping-hands approach that engages  and\r\n\r\nsays to the community, \"This is a problem that we have to\r\n\r\ncollectively  address and, therefore,  we  will  have  to\r\n\r\nsignal  to  each  other the level  of  commitment\"  is  a\r\n\r\ncorrect one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, teachers in the SPED schools are provided\r\n\r\ntraining at the NIE.  As of February 2003, 73% or 410  of\r\n\r\nthese teachers have received training, while another  23%\r\n\r\nor  131  are  either  currently undergoing  or  would  be\r\n\r\nstarting  their  training in the NIE  soon.   Every  SPED\r\n\r\nschool is also provided with funds for staff development.\r\n\r\nThis  amounts to about $1,080 per professional staff  per\r\n\r\nyear.   They also have access to MOE programmes, when  we\r\n\r\nrun  them, to facilitate courses and workshops  for  SPED\r\n\r\nschool teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have expressed that there is a lack of\r\n\r\ncareer path and that we should facilitate secondment from\r\n\r\nMOE.   Yes,  teachers from the MOE do undergo  secondment\r\n\r\nand,  if  teachers want to teach in the SPED schools,  we\r\n\r\nwill facilitate it on a case-by-case basis.  The lack  of\r\n\r\ncareer path is due to a number of reasons.  Many of these\r\n\r\nVWOs work as separate entities.  There is nothing to stop\r\n\r\nthem  from coming together to derive economies of  scale,\r\n\r\nand  we will encourage them.  But this is something  that\r\n\r\nthey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  have  to do.  To take it over would also  decrease\r\n\r\nthe  level  of stakeholdership from these VWOs, something\r\n\r\nwhich we should not do, because it is to our detriment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor asked about the assimilation of children\r\n\r\nfrom SPED schools back into the mainstream.  I thank  her\r\n\r\nfor  acknowledging that some of these efforts have  borne\r\n\r\nfruit.   Children with learning or physical  disabilities\r\n\r\nwho  are  able  to  follow the mainstream  curricula  are\r\n\r\nprovided  places  in  mainstream schools.   That  is  our\r\n\r\nprinciple.  Some mainstream schools, she rightly  pointed\r\n\r\nout,  already have full facilities to enable  access  for\r\n\r\npupils  with physical disabilities.  MOE targets to  have\r\n\r\nat  least one such school per geographical cluster of 8-9\r\n\r\nschools.   Currently,  there are  51  mainstream  schools\r\n\r\nequipped  with handicapped-friendly facilities.   As  for\r\n\r\npupils  with hearing or visual impairment, there are  six\r\n\r\ndesignated  schools  where such  pupils  have  access  to\r\n\r\nadditional resource teacher and assistive devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor recounted to this House the case of a\r\n\r\nhearing-impaired   child   who   could   not   hear   the\r\n\r\ninstructions  and  who  was  subsequently  penalised.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve her, and I can well imagine that these things can\r\n\r\nhappen.  But I would think that the teachers do not do it\r\n\r\nbecause  they  are  trying to victimise  the  child,  but\r\n\r\nbecause  they probably did not understand.  I agree  with\r\n\r\nher that a certain standard operating procedure should be\r\n\r\nadopted.   If  Members  know of  individual  cases,  they\r\n\r\nshould  relay  them to MOE, and we will  explain  to  the\r\n\r\nstaff of the relevant schools what the problem is, and  I\r\n\r\nam sure they will take remedial action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children with disabilities who do not attend\r\n\r\nmainstream schools are better served in SPED schools with\r\n\r\nspecially   trained  teachers  supported  by  paramedical\r\n\r\npersonnel.  At these specialised schools, these  children\r\n\r\ncan  learn  at  their own pace through a  curriculum  and\r\n\r\nenvironment specially tailored to their needs.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthose  who are able to - even though they study in  these\r\n\r\nSPED schools\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-  have  an  opportunity to prepare for the PSLE  and  to\r\n\r\ncontinue their education in mainstream secondary schools.\r\n\r\nIn  2002,  39 pupils from SPED schools sat for  the  PSLE\r\n\r\nand, of these, 90% were placed in secondary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Fang alluded to the fact that these children can\r\n\r\nalso  be independent in employment and, indeed, we should\r\n\r\nstrive to.  Through the SPED schools, those who are  able\r\n\r\nto  pick  up  functional literacy and numeracy,  and  the\r\n\r\nVocational  School for the Handicapped  provides  further\r\n\r\ntraining to children with hearing impairment and children\r\n\r\nwith  mild intellectual disability.  ITE also takes in  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of special needs students who are able to  follow\r\n\r\nthe  curriculum  and  function in a workshop  environment\r\n\r\nwithout undue risks to themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Gan that the parents need support,\r\n\r\nand  parental involvement is important.  The SPED schools\r\n\r\nhave put in place such programmes.  MOE will continue  to\r\n\r\nwork  closely with NCSS and the VWOs on the education  of\r\n\r\nchildren  with special needs.  There can never be  enough\r\n\r\ndone for these children, but we should continually strive\r\n\r\nand do so.  To sustain this tripartite partnership, there\r\n\r\nmust  be  active involvement and support of the community\r\n\r\nand  parents.   There must be a passion and participation\r\n\r\nfrom  the  community, coupled with  a  strong  spirit  of\r\n\r\ngiving and volunteerism among Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I thank the\r\n\r\nMinister,   the   two  Ministers  of   State,   and   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary for their comprehensive  replies.\r\n\r\nI  am  grateful to the Minister for his decision on class\r\n\r\nsizes.

Now I am going  to\r\n\r\ngo  on  to chapter two of this story of the golden monkey\r\n\r\nand the yellow wolf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This yellow wolf, which has forgotten how to speak\r\n\r\nthe  wolf language, had a change of fortune.  His ability\r\n\r\nto  speak the monkey language and to communicate with the\r\n\r\nmonkeys brought him a lot of benefits. Consequently, more\r\n\r\nand  more  yellow  wolves began to learn  and  speak  the\r\n\r\nmonkey  language.  For survival sake, they could  not  be\r\n\r\nfaulted for wanting to master another language.  However,\r\n\r\nthe   situation  became  more  and  more  serious.   Some\r\n\r\nchildren and grandchildren of the yellow wolf forgot that\r\n\r\nthey   were  wolves.   They  could  not  speak  the  wolf\r\n\r\nlanguage,  and  some  even despised  the  wolf  language.\r\n\r\nRegrettably, some of these yellow wolves began  to  treat\r\n\r\nthe  monkey  language as their own mother  tongue.   They\r\n\r\nwere  asked to learn the wolf language merely to  appease\r\n\r\nthe  other yellow wolves.  What hurts most is that  those\r\n\r\nin  the pack of yellow wolves who were oblivious of their\r\n\r\norigin  were asking that the monkey language be  used  to\r\n\r\nhelp in the teaching of their own language to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>12.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The declining standard of Chinese in Singapore is a\r\n\r\nfact  beyond  denial.   Yet, the  Ministry  of  Education\r\n\r\nchooses not to look at the matter squarely. In fact, what\r\n\r\nit  has  been  doing is to keep lowering the requirement.\r\n\r\nMother  tongue has been downgraded to that  of  a  second\r\n\r\nlanguage,  and then the lower standard syllabus  'B'  was\r\n\r\nintroduced  just to help them pass the minimum  standard.\r\n\r\nNow  it  is  even  resorting to using  English  to  teach\r\n\r\nChinese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a case of a westerner who has never been\r\n\r\nexposed to Chinese and who wants to learn just to  say  a\r\n\r\nfew simple sentences in Chinese, I will not fault him for\r\n\r\ndoing so. Even in the case of a young child who has  just\r\n\r\nreturned  to  Singapore, after living overseas  for  many\r\n\r\nyears where Chinese is never in use, helping him to learn\r\n\r\nChinese with the use of English is acceptable to  me.   I\r\n\r\nwill support it. However, in Singapore, whether it is  in\r\n\r\nthe  schools  or  in  public places, the environment  and\r\n\r\nopportunities   for   speaking   Mandarin   are   readily\r\n\r\navailable. So using the lack of a Chinese-speaking family\r\n\r\nenvironment  as an excuse and it degenerates  to  such  a\r\n\r\nstage  that  English has to be used to teach  Chinese,  I\r\n\r\nthink it is absolutely groundless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is a will, there is a way. If you want\r\n\r\nto  speak  Mandarin in Singapore, there are opportunities\r\n\r\naplenty here.  A doctor friend of mine, both husband  and\r\n\r\nwife  were English-educated, sent their children  to  the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  kindergarten in order that their  children\r\n\r\nhave more opportunities to speak Mandarin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, we ban the airing of dialect programmes for\r\n\r\nfear  that  the use of dialects may affect the  promotion\r\n\r\nand  learning  of  Mandarin.  So would  not  the  use  of\r\n\r\nEnglish to teach Chinese create similar confusion to  the\r\n\r\nstudents?  I have another story to tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gorgeously-dressed young lady went into a lift and\r\n\r\nsmilingly,  the young man who was inside the  lift,  said\r\n\r\n\"gou  yindang\".  On hearing it, the young lady  was  very\r\n\r\nangry.  She protested, \"Why are you accusing me of  being\r\n\r\nluscious?\",  and  gave the young man a big  slap  on  his\r\n\r\nface. The young man was shocked. \"Why did you hit me when\r\n\r\nI  asked you: Going down?\"  The young lady thought he was\r\n\r\nbeing  cheeky  and  saying that  she  was  \"gou  yindang\"\r\n\r\n(meaning \"very lascivious\").  You see, Sir, when  English\r\n\r\nis confusingly mixed with Chinese, it can cause trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, if we can give concessions to students in\r\n\r\nEnglish-speaking families by using English to teach them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChinese,  will MOE use the respective mother  tongues  to\r\n\r\nteach  English to students coming from the Chinese, Malay\r\n\r\nand Tamil-speaking families?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope that MOE will reconsider its\r\n\r\ndecision of using English to teach Chinese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir, before I answer Dr Ong's question, I would like to\r\n\r\nthank  Dr  Wang and other Members of this House  for  all\r\n\r\ntheir useful contributions to the Education budget debate\r\n\r\nthis  year.   I think we have had a very interesting  and\r\n\r\nconstructive debate and I hope to continue engaging  them\r\n\r\nthroughout the rest of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, I addressed the issue of mother\r\n\r\ntongue  and  the dilemmas that parents in Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nsociety at large and our schools face in trying to follow\r\n\r\nour  policy  of  bilingualism - English  and  the  mother\r\n\r\ntongue  -  to  as high a level as possible  for  all  our\r\n\r\nstudents.  Therefore, MOE has had to respond to  try  and\r\n\r\nachieve this objective in the best way possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piloting of the bilingualism approach in\r\n\r\nteaching  Chinese  is part of our continuing  efforts  to\r\n\r\naddress  the problems that some students have in learning\r\n\r\nChinese in school. This is a reality.  I do not think  we\r\n\r\ncan  will  it  away or pretend that it  does  not  exist.\r\n\r\nThere  are  students who have difficulties  learning  the\r\n\r\nlanguage  and  it is best for us to try and address  this\r\n\r\nproblem  than to push it aside and pretend that  it  does\r\n\r\nnot exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who come from non-Chinese speaking home\r\n\r\nbackgrounds  have  poorer home support for  the  language\r\n\r\nthan   those  who  speak  Chinese  at  home.  Those  with\r\n\r\nexceptional difficulties learning the language  are  like\r\n\r\nsaplings, young trees, which have shallow roots. They  do\r\n\r\nneed  additional  support if they are to  have  a  better\r\n\r\nchance  to  grow.  And you can see this in Singapore.  We\r\n\r\nbuild  a  frame around it, or we put a stick and tie  the\r\n\r\nsapling  there,  and we encourage it to  grow.   If  not,\r\n\r\nthese saplings may never\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrow.   But, with support, these saplings may  well  grow\r\n\r\ninto big, tall trees one of these days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are trying to see if the use of English at\r\n\r\nappropriate   occasions  provides  that  extra   support.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  some of these young children  may  well  lose\r\n\r\nheart and develop the kind of attitude that Dr Ong speaks\r\n\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the pilot programme, students are allowed to\r\n\r\nuse  some English to help express themselves more clearly\r\n\r\nwhen  asking and answering questions, while teachers  use\r\n\r\nEnglish  to  help students to understand the text  better\r\n\r\nand faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese is still the main medium of instruction in\r\n\r\nthese  classes.  Examination standards remain  unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe   interim  findings  of  the  pilot  have  been  very\r\n\r\nencouraging.  The Ministry has received positive feedback\r\n\r\nfrom  the  teachers involved in the programme that  their\r\n\r\nstudents  are more confident in the learning  of  Chinese\r\n\r\nand  have  better  rapport with  them.  The  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation will be conducting a more comprehensive  review\r\n\r\nat  the  end of this year when the pilot has run for  two\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong himself said that if there is a will, there\r\n\r\nis  a  way. So, we should keep an open mind about how  we\r\n\r\nteach  the  Chinese language and be willing to experiment\r\n\r\nand  find out what works best for our children - they are\r\n\r\nnot  all  the same.  Different methods may be  suited  to\r\n\r\ndifferent  groups  of pupils.  And by catering  to  these\r\n\r\nvarying  needs,  we  give the Chinese language  the  best\r\n\r\nchance of flourishing in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for his\r\n\r\nreply.

In\r\n\r\nthis  way, we can ensure a collective national effort  to\r\n\r\ndevelop   Singapore   into  a  creative   and   connected\r\n\r\ninternational   city.   And  more   and   more   ordinary\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  now realise that the creative industry  has\r\n\r\nthe  potential  to become a key propeller of  Singapore's\r\n\r\ncreative economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During these hard times, it is heartening to note\r\n\r\nthat  jobs  are  created for both young and  old  in  the\r\n\r\ncreative   industry.   And  with  the  opening   of   the\r\n\r\nEsplanade,  we see cheerful young men and women,  working\r\n\r\nas ushers and at the restaurants. With the opening of the\r\n\r\nAsian  Civilisation  Museum and the exhibitions  held  at\r\n\r\nother  museums and heritage centres, we are  also  seeing\r\n\r\njobs being created for the older fellow citizens too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rise of a creative economy, may I ask what\r\n\r\nplans  are  in the pipeline to capitalise on  Singapore's\r\n\r\ncultural scene for the arts to bloom and create jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Sir, a vibrant,\r\n\r\ncreative   arts  environment  is  integral  to  realising\r\n\r\nSingapore's dream to be the premier Asian cultural hub.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already invested $1 billion in\r\n\r\nbuilding  a  world-class arts and culture infrastructure.\r\n\r\nOur investments are paying off.  The creative arts sector\r\n\r\nhad value-added of almost $5 billion in 2002 or about  3%\r\n\r\nof GDP. We seem to be on the right track for success. For\r\n\r\ninstance,  the  creative  cluster  employs  about  72,000\r\n\r\nemployees  in Singapore, representing about 3.5%  of  the\r\n\r\nworkforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, an estimated 1,500 new creative arts\r\n\r\ncluster graduates who are trained in the performance arts\r\n\r\nand  related management services will be available to the\r\n\r\ncreative  cluster.  Granted, some may end up in  jobs  or\r\n\r\neven  careers that may have little or nothing to do  with\r\n\r\ntheir training.  There would be those who will be looking\r\n\r\ntowards  being  employed in their disciplines.   Sir,  we\r\n\r\nhave a feeder of people who are trained in specific areas\r\n\r\nto support the arts cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we invest and increase in our cultural\r\n\r\ncapital,  I  wonder  if there are enough  jobs  for  such\r\n\r\ngraduates upon completion of their arts courses. Perhaps,\r\n\r\nsome  scrutiny  may  be timely, to  see  if  courses  are\r\n\r\nturning out too many for too few jobs.  Perhaps, an inter-ministry  unit  can  be  set  up  between  MITA  and  the\r\n\r\ninstitutions  to  oversee this.  The  unit  can  look  at\r\n\r\nspecific clusters that will require certain talents, work\r\n\r\nwith  institutions to design courses,  have  an  industry\r\n\r\nplayer  to sit in the unit to advise on such courses,  to\r\n\r\nensure that they are relevant and updated. This will also\r\n\r\ngive  a  heads-up as to the employment of such people  in\r\n\r\nthe respective areas of the arts cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit can also arrange for our graduates or\r\n\r\nundergraduates to be attached to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwork with the production crew of world-class performances\r\n\r\nthat we are now able to attract to our stages.  Then, our\r\n\r\nown  creative  cultural capital, in  the  form  of  these\r\n\r\ngraduates,  can  learn  from the  best  sound  and  stage\r\n\r\nmanagers,   special  effects  directors,  set  designers,\r\n\r\nlighting  managers  as well as performers.   I  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to consider these suggestions as this will  not\r\n\r\nonly increase the skills and exposure of our arts cluster\r\n\r\nstudents  but  also create employment opportunities  when\r\n\r\nthey  complete their courses.  I believe that  the  value\r\n\r\nadded  to  this  human  capital will  truly  enhance  the\r\n\r\ncultural capital that we are creating that will, in time,\r\n\r\nmake Singapore the premier cultural hub, not only in  the\r\n\r\nregion but in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, competition from\r\n\r\nother countries in the traditional economic activities is\r\n\r\nincreasing.   As  our  economy is rapidly  changing,  the\r\n\r\nservices  sector  looks  set  to  grow  to  become   more\r\n\r\nimportant.  If you look at Venice, Paris, London and  New\r\n\r\nYork, we see many visitors who come to enjoy the cultural\r\n\r\nand  arts resources and activities. Such tourists are  an\r\n\r\nimportant  economic sector of these cities.  I  therefore\r\n\r\njoin  my  GPC Chairman, Mr Seng Han Thong, and my  fellow\r\n\r\nGPC  member, Mr Arthur Fong, in asking the Government  to\r\n\r\npay more attention to the growth of this cultural sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore should also develop our human capital and\r\n\r\nculture and the arts.  Like in those cities, culture  and\r\n\r\narts  tourists can be an important economic  sector.   To\r\n\r\ngrow  this  sector, we have to develop our  hardware  and\r\n\r\nsoftware  in the culture and the arts.  Our hardware  are\r\n\r\nthe  Esplanade, our museums, Chinatown, Little India  and\r\n\r\nour   libraries.  Our  software  are  our  artists,   our\r\n\r\nperformers, our people who manage our hardware and  their\r\n\r\nskills and know-how. We have to develop and nurture them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important component that we need to have are\r\n\r\nthe customers, people who enjoy arts and the culture.  In\r\n\r\nany  country, culture and the arts need a core  of  local\r\n\r\nsupporters to sustain and to grow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem.   When  the  sector  becomes  established,  foreign\r\n\r\nvisitors  will  come  and enjoy our shows,  museums,  art\r\n\r\ngalleries  and  libraries.  Our culture and  arts  sector\r\n\r\nwill  then  grow.  We thus need to nurture and  grow  all\r\n\r\nthree components.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Minister revealed the intention of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry to develop the culture and arts sector.   I\r\n\r\nwould thus like to ask the Minister for an update of  our\r\n\r\nefforts  to develop our cultural capital and the  culture\r\n\r\nand  arts  sector into an important economic  sector,  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the  three  components  that  I  have   just\r\n\r\noutlined.   What  are some of the future plans  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry has to develop this sector?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>12.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, for the\r\n\r\ncreative industry, MITA has a desired outcome to  have  a\r\n\r\nvibrant and self-sustaining creative cluster, and  it  is\r\n\r\nbasically  the  fusion  of arts,  culture,  business  and\r\n\r\ntechnology.  I must say that it is a tall order,  and  it\r\n\r\nis  a  tremendous challenge for MITA to accomplish  this.\r\n\r\nIf   they  are  successful,  they  will  increase   their\r\n\r\ncontribution  to our GDP and result in job  creation  and\r\n\r\nwealth to the country.  But, Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister what other conditions and an environment that we\r\n\r\ncan create in Singapore to facilitate this success in the\r\n\r\nstory  of  a  creative industry.  In a very stress-driven\r\n\r\nsociety,  creativity can be a result of our  backs  being\r\n\r\nagainst  the  wall.   But there must  be  conditions  and\r\n\r\nenvironment  where you need the calm, the reflection  and\r\n\r\nmeditation, for people to explore ideas.  I would like to\r\n\r\nask   whether  enough  conditions  and  environment   are\r\n\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talent is a very severe constraint. We are\r\n\r\nsuccessful in setting up schools for the arts, design and\r\n\r\nmedia  right up to the university level.  Are there plans\r\n\r\nto  move  such schools from the Ministry of Education  to\r\n\r\nMITA?   Is  there  a  business case for  a  very  special\r\n\r\npurpose  school  under  MITA?

I appreciate\r\n\r\nthat.    Sir,   the  creative  industry  is   universally\r\n\r\nacknowledged  as  an engine of growth in  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomies.   In  the UK, the annual value output  of  the\r\n\r\ncreative industry reaches 50 billion, and is 16%  of  its\r\n\r\nGDP.   In  New  England, four out of  every  10  creative\r\n\r\nworkers are self-employed, and in Portland, the mean wage\r\n\r\nfor  the  creative services cluster in 1999 is about  60%\r\n\r\nabove the regional average.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this backdrop, and Singapore's need to\r\n\r\ncreate  high-value add goods and services, the  arts  and\r\n\r\ncreative scene is now thrust into the limelight.  Art  is\r\n\r\nno  longer  for  art's sake, but that  there  is  a  real\r\n\r\neconomy  within.  We also call it cultural capital.   The\r\n\r\ncreative  industry  is  now prized  as  a  propellant  of\r\n\r\ngrowth.   However, what price creativity?  Does  it  mean\r\n\r\nthat now all artists should learn to produce commercially\r\n\r\nviable  goods and learn to market their products,  rather\r\n\r\nthan   deepen  their  experience  in  the  arts  so  that\r\n\r\ncreativity can come from experiments and expressions from\r\n\r\nwithin,  or  is there still room for art for art's  sake?\r\n\r\nIf  so,  how can we help the creative cluster to overcome\r\n\r\nfunding,  housing and exposure issues so that  they  will\r\n\r\nnot  look  like  the 1960s' image of a poor tuberculosis-stricken Chinese calligrapher who coughs blood and dies a\r\n\r\npauper, or the pathetic blind, black sunglass erhu player\r\n\r\nwho  is  accompanied by his young but, equally, pathetic-looking songstress singing the famous tune of \"lok kai mo\r\n\r\nchin mai meen pow\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, how does the Minister intend to strike a\r\n\r\nbalance   between  the  need  to  commercialise  artistic\r\n\r\nproductions    vis-a-vis   the    need    to    encourage\r\n\r\nexperimentations and expressions of art for  art's  sake?\r\n\r\nWhat are the specific plans to translate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nart  and culture, which are raw materials and undoubtedly\r\n\r\nthe  cradle  of  creativity  into  successful  commercial\r\n\r\nproducts  or services, without compromising the  artistic\r\n\r\nspirit and culture?  Both UK and New England have a  deep\r\n\r\nhistory  in arts appreciation, which has become part  and\r\n\r\nparcel  of  the  society's psyche.   It  is,  hence,  not\r\n\r\nsurprising  to  see  a  high rate of entrepreneurship  in\r\n\r\ntheir  creative industry.  The situation  is  reverse  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  as years of academic numbers have overwhelmed\r\n\r\nthe  development of the creative cradle.   What  are  the\r\n\r\nspecific  plans to accelerate the growth of the  creative\r\n\r\nsector given the lack of depth in arts appreciation here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the issue on vision. Does the\r\n\r\nMinister have a specific vision of a cultural capital  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?   If so, does it look more like  that  of  the\r\n\r\nLondon of the East, as Minister BG George Yeo has said in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of MTI, or is it the Switzerland of the  East,\r\n\r\nwhere  artistic talents are evident in the production  of\r\n\r\nalmost  all  goods,  from the famous  watch  industry  to\r\n\r\nmusical boxes to church organs?  What are the steps  that\r\n\r\nare taken to bring us closer to our vision, and are there\r\n\r\nany measurable indicators?  Singapore has a rich cultural\r\n\r\nheritage,  one  that  blends  the  East  and  West.    We\r\n\r\ninherited the British legacy and are exposed to  American\r\n\r\ncultural  imperialism, yet we are very  Asian  at  heart.\r\n\r\nWith   an   open-door  policy,  cultures  of  the   world\r\n\r\ncongregate  here  to give us a unique  blend  and  unique\r\n\r\ncultural  experience and exposure.  How can we take  full\r\n\r\nadvantage  of this blend to create and put a  premium  on\r\n\r\nour goods and services?  A good example would be that  of\r\n\r\nAngsana Spa Resort in Australia, Queensland.  It cleverly\r\n\r\nblends  the  refined eastern traditional decor  with  the\r\n\r\nAustralian outback to make it one of the best resorts  in\r\n\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artistic talents are mobile. How do we then intend\r\n\r\nto  first groom them and then keep them?  Creativity also\r\n\r\nmeans  thinking out of the box, which means  out  of  the\r\n\r\nnorms.   How far are we willing to go to tolerate out-of-the-norms thinking and behaviour?  What does this trans-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlate into in the area of censorship?  How liberal are  we\r\n\r\nprepared  to  be?  After all, out-of-the-norm  behaviour,\r\n\r\nonce  endorsed, becomes acceptable and gets  proliferated\r\n\r\nover time to become a norm.  Where do we draw the line?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, given that the creative\r\n\r\nindustry  is a multi-disciplinary industry,  is  there  a\r\n\r\nsupra  agency  overseeing  the  execution  of  the  ERC's\r\n\r\nServices  Sub-Committee's  recommendation,  in  order  to\r\n\r\nensure  its  success?   Given that the  majority  of  the\r\n\r\nbusinesses  in the arts and creative industry are  mainly\r\n\r\nsmall  and  medium size, a national agency  could  render\r\n\r\nsome  help  to design, package, market and,  even  export\r\n\r\ntheir  products  and  services.   Sir,  ultimately,   the\r\n\r\ncreative  industry  is important to us  not  only  as  an\r\n\r\neconomic  engine  of  growth,  but  also  enhancing   our\r\n\r\ncultural environment.  Hence, I would urge the Government\r\n\r\nto  pump-prime  the sector through an adequate  framework\r\n\r\ncomprising   fiscal  measures,  employment   and   social\r\n\r\nsecurity   considerations,  as  well  as   the   relevant\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> In the current\r\n\r\neconomic  climate and given the world  as  it  is  today,\r\n\r\ncreativity is no longer an option.  Creativity is the key\r\n\r\nto  our survival in this very different world.  For  that\r\n\r\nreason,  I  would like to ask the Minister  what  we  are\r\n\r\ndoing to encourage creative arts in Singapore as well  as\r\n\r\ncreative  designs.   The  way  of  the  future   is   not\r\n\r\nSingaporeans sitting back and asking the Government  what\r\n\r\njobs  there are available.  The Government will play  its\r\n\r\npart,  I  am  sure, in providing jobs,  but  the  key  to\r\n\r\nsurviving  in this very challenging world is the  ability\r\n\r\nto  actually  create or come out with things  that  might\r\n\r\nactually grow or encourage your own employment.   One  of\r\n\r\nthese  areas  is creative design.  Just take  handphones,\r\n\r\nfor  example.   The  three popular designs  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  be  handphones by Motorola, Nokia,  and  Ericsson.\r\n\r\nThe  reason why they are so successful is because the way\r\n\r\nthese handphones were designed - easy to hold, press  and\r\n\r\nuse.  Design is actually the key for a lot of things that\r\n\r\nare going to be marketed in the future and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  issue is how we can harness the talent that we  have\r\n\r\nto create creative industry in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to sound a very upbeat note on this because I\r\n\r\ndo not think it is a situation where Singapore has a lack\r\n\r\nof talent.  Most people, when they think of Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nthink of us as technocrats, a little dull and boring, and\r\n\r\nI  think  that was what prompted Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon  to\r\n\r\ntalk about Singapore being a \"wow\" city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the occasion, this week, to encounter what I\r\n\r\nconsider to be very powerful talents in Singapore.   This\r\n\r\nwas  an  exhibition  done by Henderson Secondary  School.\r\n\r\nThey  have a project known as \"Matchbox Project\" done  by\r\n\r\ntheir  aesthetic club, and they have actually  taken  the\r\n\r\nart  works and pottery done by the students and exhibited\r\n\r\nit  in a gallery at South Bridge Road called Utterly Art.\r\n\r\nI  was  invited  to come down and have  a  look  at  this\r\n\r\nexhibition.   When I saw the works of art  there,  I  was\r\n\r\nreally  blown  away because the works of  art  that  were\r\n\r\nhanging  on the walls were done by 15-year old  students.\r\n\r\nThe  kind of depth and sheer raw power that emanated from\r\n\r\nthose  paintings were illustrative of maturity far beyond\r\n\r\n15-year  olds.   For  anybody  who  has  not  seen   that\r\n\r\nexhibition  yet, I strongly encourage you to go  and  see\r\n\r\nit,  including  the Minister, because it  is  very,  very\r\n\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the paintings, for example, was done by a 15-year old girl. She had lost her dog. So, the painting\r\n\r\nwas of a poodle suspended on the hands of a clock against\r\n\r\nthe  background of a clock.  It was very Salvador Dali's.\r\n\r\nIt  was  not a copy, but you could see elements of  that,\r\n\r\nwithout  the  kind  of  darkness that  you  see  in  some\r\n\r\nSalvador   Dali's  paintings,  but  it  had   a   certain\r\n\r\nlightheartedness about it that was just excellent.  There\r\n\r\nwere other paintings hanging up there which reflected the\r\n\r\nvarious  thoughts and feelings of the pupils.  There  was\r\n\r\none  of  HDB housing which I had strongly encouraged  the\r\n\r\nprincipal   to  donate  to  the  Ministry   of   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause  I  happened  to think of the  particularly  good\r\n\r\npiece  of  work.  So the point that I want to  sound  out\r\n\r\nhere  is  that  we have no lack of talent.   We  have  an\r\n\r\nenormous  depth of raw talent.  It is just a question  of\r\n\r\nhow  we harness it and I hope the Minister would be  able\r\n\r\nto expand on how we can channel the energy that the young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, there is\r\n\r\nmoney in movie making.  The Hollywood movie \"Titanic\",  a\r\n\r\nmovie  about the sinking of a British luxury  liner,  was\r\n\r\nreputed  to be made with about US$252 million.   But,  it\r\n\r\nraked in world-wide a record sum of about US$520 million,\r\n\r\nmore  than  double  its  outlay  of  capital.   Our   own\r\n\r\nSingapore  movie,  made  by Jack  Neo,  entitled  \"I  Not\r\n\r\nStupid\",  is said to have made $1.6 million, and  it  was\r\n\r\nscreened  internationally, in Malaysia, Hong Kong,  Japan\r\n\r\nand  South  Korea,  and was very well received  in  those\r\n\r\ncountries.   Jack  Neo's  latest  movie  does  show  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans do have creative talent to make a movie  and\r\n\r\nbe  accepted internationally and make money at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, George Lucas of \"Star Wars\" fame, for the past\r\n\r\n25 years in Hollywood, pioneered film-making with the use\r\n\r\nof computer technology and sound technology.  Sir, I have\r\n\r\nbeen  told that Singapore has such technology, especially\r\n\r\nsound  technology  as pioneered by Mr  Sim  Wong  Hoo  of\r\n\r\nCreative Technology.  Sir, it would appear that Singapore\r\n\r\ndo  have  creative and talented people, and expertise  in\r\n\r\ncomputer and sound technology.  We do have the people and\r\n\r\nthe  technology  to make films that can be  sold  in  the\r\n\r\nworld  market.  Can the Minister comment on why, up  till\r\n\r\nnow, Singapore has not developed a vibrant movie industry\r\n\r\nof international standard?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E.

They  have  raised   many   good\r\n\r\nsuggestions  and  asked many searching  questions.

It is a story about a principal and\r\n\r\nher  problem.   I  call  it  my \"Lipstick  Story\".   This\r\n\r\nheadmistress had a problem with her girls, and it was not\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the policy measures introduced yesterday  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Education.  I think those are all  very\r\n\r\nwelcomed.   Her  problem  was  that  every  evening,  the\r\n\r\ncleaner  would  discover that the mirror  in  the  girls'\r\n\r\nbathroom would be full of lipstick prints.  The girls had\r\n\r\ntaken  to  this little prank and they would put  lipstick\r\n\r\non,  all the different colours and shades, and they would\r\n\r\nkiss  the  mirror.  Every night, the cleaner would  spend\r\n\r\nthe  greater  part of the night cleaning it up,  and  the\r\n\r\nnext day it would all come back again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the principal decided to speak to her girls at\r\n\r\nthe  assembly.   She told them what an irresponsible  act\r\n\r\nthis  was.   It  did not help.  The lipstick  marks  were\r\n\r\nstill there.  The next day, she tried a different speech.\r\n\r\nShe  told them about how hard a time the poor Ah Soh  had\r\n\r\ncleaning the lipstick marks off the mirror.  That did not\r\n\r\nhelp.   She  thought  of  calling  the  Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment, but she thought the better of it.   So,  she\r\n\r\ncalled  the  parents instead.  But that only made  things\r\n\r\nworse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days, she decided on a new course of\r\n\r\naction.   One afternoon, she called a few of  the  girls,\r\n\r\nthe  ones  that she suspected, but could not prove,  were\r\n\r\nthe ringleaders behind this.  She called all of them down\r\n\r\nto  that girl's bathroom and she said, \"I'd like  you  to\r\n\r\nsee  something.  I'd like you to meet someone.\"   And  in\r\n\r\nwalked  the  cleaner.   She is  a  typical  cleaner,  50-something,  got the job as a cleaner of the  school  from\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry of Manpower's Job Connect programme.  She walked\r\n\r\nin  with an old mop.  One of the girls looked at her  and\r\n\r\ntaunted  her.  She said, \"Old lady, where is your  pail?\"\r\n\r\nThe cleaner looked at her and said, \"Ai yah, I don't need\r\n\r\na pail.  You just watch.\"  So she walked up to one of the\r\n\r\ntoilet bowls, lifted the lid and said, \"Ah neh la sam\"  - so  dirty.  So she pressed the flush and she looked at it\r\n\r\nagain and said, \"Still a bit dirty, but never mind.\"  She\r\n\r\ntook  the  mop  and  she stuck it into the  toilet  bowl,\r\n\r\nswirled it around, took it out, and started cleaning  the\r\n\r\nmirror.   The  headmistress did not have a problem  after\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I tell this story, from time to time, when I\r\n\r\ntalk  about  the creative industry, or when I talk  about\r\n\r\ninnovation.   Because being creative is not always  being\r\n\r\nhigh-tech.   It  is  how  we  think.   But  the  creative\r\n\r\nindustry  certainly  will be an  important  part  of  our\r\n\r\nfuture  economy.  Unlike manufacturing, we cannot  easily\r\n\r\nsay   what  makes  up  this  industry.   It  ranges  from\r\n\r\narchitecture  to  fashion, from artists  to  copywriters.\r\n\r\nBut  what we do know is that this industry creates a  lot\r\n\r\nof value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years back, American architect, Frank Gehry,\r\n\r\ndesigned the Guggenheim Museum at Bilbao in Spain.   Your\r\n\r\nfirst  impression of this museum is that it is a  tangled\r\n\r\nmass  of  metal.   There  are no  straight  surfaces,  no\r\n\r\nstraight  lines.  Everything is curved and twisted.   But\r\n\r\nit  is  an  architectural  marvel.   That  building,  the\r\n\r\nGuggenheim Museum at Bilbao, transformed a stagnant steel\r\n\r\ntown  into  a major tourist draw.  The Museum cost  about\r\n\r\nUS$200 million to build, but I am told that the tourists'\r\n\r\nspending  within  two years more than made  up  for  that\r\n\r\namount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take another example. Japanese designer,\r\n\r\nKitoshiyuki Kita, designs TV sets for Sharp.  Sharp is  a\r\n\r\nmanufacturer  of  LCD  TV  screens,  a  very  competitive\r\n\r\nmarket.   And Sharp needed a more attractive  product  to\r\n\r\ngain market share.  When Mr Kita's design hit the market,\r\n\r\nSharp's sale of LCD TVs went up five-fold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global success stories are endless. What we\r\n\r\nwant to do is to have more of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  to  be  Singapore stories.  The  creative  industry\r\n\r\naccounts for about 3% of our GDP today - and about 70,000\r\n\r\njobs.  But in the UK and the US, they account for 5-8% of\r\n\r\nGDP.   And  this means that there is tremendous potential\r\n\r\nfor  creative  industries to grow and to create  tens  of\r\n\r\nthousands of good new jobs.  MrsYu-Foo would say this  is\r\n\r\ndefinitely a \"wow\" industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kinds of jobs we can create are wide-ranging.\r\n\r\nMr Seng Han Thong and Mr Arthur Fong have both noted that\r\n\r\nthe  Esplanade generated new jobs.  It created about 320,\r\n\r\nboth  full  and part-time, and numerous more in  all  the\r\n\r\nshops and arcades that are located at the Esplanade,  and\r\n\r\nfor  all  the artists who perform there.  But  more  than\r\n\r\njust jobs at the Esplanade, we can create high value jobs\r\n\r\nin   design,   media  and  other  areas   of   arts   and\r\n\r\nentertainment.  Some jobs will be glamorous like  fashion\r\n\r\ndesigners or movie stars.  But there will also  be  other\r\n\r\nkinds   of   challenging  work,  like  sound  and   stage\r\n\r\nengineers, graphic designers and animation artists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond jobs, the creative industry also has a\r\n\r\npowerful  indirect impact on other industries  by  adding\r\n\r\nstyle,  aesthetics  and freshness to  everything  we  do,\r\n\r\nresulting  in more exciting products and services.   This\r\n\r\nwill   add   vibrancy  to  our  companies   and   enhance\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness of our industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But being creative is not something we can order\r\n\r\nupon  on a menu.  Sometimes, as Mr Loh Meng See says,  we\r\n\r\nneed  to be pressed to the wall.  At other times, we need\r\n\r\nquiet  and  solitude.  We are also, sometimes, stimulated\r\n\r\nby  the  buzz  of a lively city to come up with  original\r\n\r\nthoughts.   And  this  is where cultural  capital  is  so\r\n\r\nimportant.  The richer our cultural capital, the more  it\r\n\r\nnourishes  us  and  it gives us that unexpected  insight,\r\n\r\nthat perspective or that sudden thought that allows us to\r\n\r\nbreak through and come up with winning ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultural capital is hard to define, because it is in\r\n\r\neverything that we do.  It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincludes  our sense of aesthetics, beauty, identity,  our\r\n\r\nimagination and emotions, how we communicate  and  relate\r\n\r\nto  each  other, how we deal with stress and  respond  to\r\n\r\nopportunities.   But what we know is  that  the  more  we\r\n\r\nwiden   and  deepen  our  cultural  capital,  the  better\r\n\r\nequipped we will be to compete in the creative industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is why I fully support Mr Seng Han Thong, Dr\r\n\r\nTan  Boon  Wan and the others who have called for  us  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  our cultural capital.  To do this,  we  need  to\r\n\r\ngive  our  people  wider perspectives  of  life,  through\r\n\r\nliterature,  history, the arts.  This is a big  and  wide\r\n\r\ntask, but we have the ingredients and the institutions in\r\n\r\nplace to take off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday and today, my colleagues in the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Education have talked themselves hoarse, talking about\r\n\r\nall  the  different things we will do in our schools,  to\r\n\r\ncreate  the  space  for  our  children  to  become   more\r\n\r\ncreative.   MITA  will  also do its  part.   Through  our\r\n\r\nheritage  programmes,  promotion  of  the  arts  and  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  library systems, I will recount  briefly\r\n\r\nhere  the progress we have made in these areas.   We  are\r\n\r\nreaching   out  to  more  people  through  our   heritage\r\n\r\nprogrammes and museums.  Last week, for example,  DPM  Dr\r\n\r\nTony  Tan  launched our third Heritage  Festival  and  we\r\n\r\nexpect  about  200,000 people at these activities.    Two\r\n\r\nweeks  before that, the Prime Minister opened  the  Asian\r\n\r\nCivilisations  Museum.  And three  years  from  now,  the\r\n\r\nexpanded  Singapore  History Museum  will  be  completed.\r\n\r\nTaken  together,  our  museums  attract  half  a  million\r\n\r\nvisitors  a year, a large part of them Singaporeans.   We\r\n\r\nhave  more facilities and activities now than ever before\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans to explore and to discover their roots.\r\n\r\nIn  the arts, we had record performances last year and  a\r\n\r\nrecord  number  of  people attending  them,  despite  the\r\n\r\ndownturn in the economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opening of the Esplanade has branded Singapore\r\n\r\nas  a  city with an ambition for the arts.  The NAC  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  work  on that brand to turn  ambition  into\r\n\r\nreality by bringing our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nartists  to  international events and  by  continuing  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  number and quality of  art  activities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See and Miss Penny Low have raised\r\n\r\nvarious questions about the arts and arts school,  and  I\r\n\r\nwill respond to them later in the debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our libraries, last year, we saw more than\r\n\r\n32,000  visits,  an  average  of  10  visits  for   every\r\n\r\nSingaporean, and the numbers are still rising.   But  now\r\n\r\nthat   we   have   succeeded  in  making  our   libraries\r\n\r\nattractive, we will focus on how we can get borrowers  to\r\n\r\nread  more  deeply  and  more  widely,  and  to  use  our\r\n\r\ninformation services to excel in the knowledge economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These efforts we make to increase our cultural\r\n\r\ncapital  will  take  time to bear  fruit.   They  have  a\r\n\r\ncumulative  effect.  But, over time, more  reading,  more\r\n\r\nawareness  of our roots, more exposure to the  arts  will\r\n\r\nchange  us in ways that we cannot exactly describe.   And\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  more of us who, like Ms Indranee  Rajah,\r\n\r\nwill  jump up and be enthused about the arts.  If we keep\r\n\r\nat  it,  we will become a more gracious society   -   big\r\n\r\nhearted,  imaginative and we will create such  a  vibrant\r\n\r\nand  lively city that the creative industries cannot  but\r\n\r\ngrow and flourish here.  This is our goal.  But how do we\r\n\r\nachieve it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to some immediate steps we can take\r\n\r\ntowards that goal.  MITA will take a focused approach and\r\n\r\nwe  will concentrate on just two key areas for a start  - design   and  media,  both  areas  where  we  have   some\r\n\r\nstrengths.   We  pick  design because  good  designs  can\r\n\r\ncreate  a lot of value.  I gave examples earlier  on  but\r\n\r\nlet  me  cite just one more.  Inter Brand, which  studies\r\n\r\ncompanies' brand values reported in its 2002 survey  that\r\n\r\nSamsung's  brand  value  gained  30%,  rising  to  US$8.3\r\n\r\nbillion, because it used bold designs to transform itself\r\n\r\ninto a premium seller of consumer products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, what a good design does is that it\r\n\r\nallows  companies  to differentiate  their  products  and\r\n\r\nservices, and to gain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  competitive advantage. This allows them to work on the\r\n\r\nrevenue  side  of the equation to increase revenues,  and\r\n\r\nnot just make profits by containing costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We aim to make Singapore one of Asia's leading hubs\r\n\r\nfor  design excellence.  To do this, MITA will  launch  a\r\n\r\nmulti-agency design Singapore initiative, promote  design\r\n\r\nas a strategic capability in Singapore.  Design Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  do three things in the coming year.  Firstly,  MITA\r\n\r\nwill  work  closely with the economic and  education  and\r\n\r\nresearch  institutions  to  develop  new  capability   in\r\n\r\ndesign.   NTU's recently announced plans to  establish  a\r\n\r\nSchool of Design and Media is one example of how the  new\r\n\r\ncapability  we like to see develop.  This will complement\r\n\r\nthe  architecture and industrial design offerings at NUS,\r\n\r\npolytechnics  and  arts colleges,  like  LaSalle-SIA  and\r\n\r\nNAFA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, MITA will work with EDB to attract and\r\n\r\nanchor  leading  industrial  design  companies  from  the\r\n\r\nregion  and the world to Singapore.  Currently,  we  have\r\n\r\nMNCs,  such  as  Philips,  Motorola  and  Hewlett-Packard\r\n\r\nalready  designing some of their products  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  will work with them and also with other companies  to\r\n\r\nincrease the scope of such activities here and strengthen\r\n\r\nour position as a global design and manufacturing centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we will take a cluster approach to develop\r\n\r\nthe  design services in Singapore.  This approach  allows\r\n\r\nus to maximise our limited resources and to synergise our\r\n\r\ncreative capabilities.  MITA, working with MTI, will  set\r\n\r\nup   the  Design  Singapore  Council  to  spearhead   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  this cluster.  This  Council  will  pool\r\n\r\ntogether  the  efforts of Government's institutions  and,\r\n\r\nmost   importantly,  industries  to  promote  Singapore's\r\n\r\ndesign culture and design industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council will include many top executives from\r\n\r\nindustry, because do we not only need creativity  but  we\r\n\r\nalso  need business and marketing skills to make the most\r\n\r\nof  our  creativity.  Mr Edmund Cheng,  MD  of  Wing  Tai\r\n\r\nHoldings and Deputy Chairman of the Singapore Arts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCouncil, will chair this Council.  Mr Tham Kai Meng,  Co-Chairman  of Oglivy and Mather, Asia Pacific,  and  board\r\n\r\nmember  of  the National Arts Council will be the  Deputy\r\n\r\nChairman.  The Council will be set up shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me update Members on what we plan to do in\r\n\r\nthe media industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Mr Chiam See Tong for his support to develop\r\n\r\nthe film industry in Singapore.  Indeed, I agree with him\r\n\r\nthat not only would this create jobs but, by making films\r\n\r\nthat  reflect  our way of life, it can also contribute  a\r\n\r\ncultural  identity.   As Mr Chiam has  pointed  out,  the\r\n\r\nmedia industry is a huge global industry.  In 2001, total\r\n\r\nworldwide  spending  in  the  media  industry  was   US$1\r\n\r\ntrillion.   We  shall ride on this growth and  work  with\r\n\r\nstudios to attract some parts of the value chain, such as\r\n\r\ndigital  animation and pre- and post-production work,  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me sound a word of caution. I have said\r\n\r\nbefore  that developing the film industry is a  challenge\r\n\r\nfor  us  because of our much smaller size.   Whether  one\r\n\r\nmillion  or 100 million people watch the movie, the  cost\r\n\r\nto  make it is the same.  Mr Chiam said it cost more than\r\n\r\n$250  million  to make the Titanic.  But if  100  million\r\n\r\npeople  pay $5 to watch the movie, then you can get  $500\r\n\r\nmillion of revenue.  I do not know how much Jack Neo paid\r\n\r\nto  make  his movie \"I Not Stupid\".  But then  far  fewer\r\n\r\npeople paid to watch the movie, and that is why he made a\r\n\r\nlittle bit less than what the Titanic made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We face two key challenges. First, we have fewer\r\n\r\ntalents  compared to the large countries, simply  because\r\n\r\nof our small size and not because we do not have talented\r\n\r\npeople.   Secondly,  we are smaller  scale  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nmarket.  Notwithstanding these limitations, we have  seen\r\n\r\nencouraging signs of success.  Apart from Jack  Neo's  \"I\r\n\r\nNot Stupid\" movie that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Chiam  mentioned, the Singapore-France  co-production\r\n\r\n\"Song of the Stork\" and other movies have won recognition\r\n\r\nat  foreign  film  festivals, and  a  few  of  them  have\r\n\r\nsucceeded at the box office in a modest way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our local production houses are now winning major\r\n\r\noverseas  contracts.   They  are  recognised  for   their\r\n\r\nquality  and  creative  abilities.   We  have  built   up\r\n\r\ncapabilities   in  animation,  pre-  and  post-production\r\n\r\nfacilities.  Our arts scene is creating buzz, and that is\r\n\r\nattracting venture capitalists who sense that  there  are\r\n\r\nopportunities opening up.  But, most of all,  our  strong\r\n\r\nIP  regime  in  Singapore is attracting  foreign  content\r\n\r\ncompanies  which want to finance, produce or trade  their\r\n\r\nmedia  contents and manage their intellectual  properties\r\n\r\nhere under the protection of our laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Media Development Authority (MDA), newly formed\r\n\r\nto  help  develop the media industry, has outlined  three\r\n\r\nthrusts to building on these promising trends.  The first\r\n\r\nis to develop \"Made-by-Singapore\" content, not just \"Made-in-Singapore\".   By  this, we mean content  that  can  be\r\n\r\ncreated either in Singapore or elsewhere, and not just by\r\n\r\nSingaporean  companies but also through co-production  or\r\n\r\njoint ventures with international partners.  But to  make\r\n\r\ncontent,  we need money.  Substantial upfront  funds  are\r\n\r\nneeded  to  develop TV productions, films  and  animation\r\n\r\nprojects.   MDA is drawing up plans to set up  a  Content\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund that will be invested in media  projects\r\n\r\nin  co-funding arrangements with the industry.  To  seize\r\n\r\nthe opportunities that are available today and so that we\r\n\r\ndo  not lose the momentum that we have built, MDA has set\r\n\r\naside  $20 million of its own funds to seed projects  and\r\n\r\nto launch this new fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thrust is to develop Singapore into a\r\n\r\nmedia  exchange  -  a marketplace for  the  distribution,\r\n\r\ntrading  and management of intellectual property, digital\r\n\r\nrights and other media products.  Last year, it organised\r\n\r\nthe  Asia  Media Festival which comprised six  concurrent\r\n\r\ntrade events.  That attracted 2,200\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustry  professionals  to  Singapore  to  pitch   their\r\n\r\nproducts,  sell  and distribute their  creative  content.\r\n\r\nMDA  and  EDB will work on making this event bigger  each\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, MDA is collaborating with JTC to build a\r\n\r\nprototype  environment called \"Fusionpolis\" in One-North.\r\n\r\nI launched this about a month ago.  It will be for people\r\n\r\nin  the  media, infocomm and other creative companies  to\r\n\r\nwork,  live,  play and learn.  It will  be  completed  in\r\n\r\nthree  years'  time  and will have  state-of-the-art  art\r\n\r\nstudios  and  production facilities that infocomm,  media\r\n\r\nand  arts  companies can use to integrate or  fuse  their\r\n\r\nideas together, to generate new products and new business\r\n\r\npropositions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the first steps that MITA will take\r\n\r\nto develop the design and media industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC has identified the creative industries as an\r\n\r\nimportant   component  of  Singapore's  future   economy.\r\n\r\nGrowing   these  industries  is  risky,  because  success\r\n\r\ndepends  strongly on whether we can develop  and  attract\r\n\r\ntalents to work in the industry, and that, in turn,  will\r\n\r\ndepend on whether we can develop our cultural capital and\r\n\r\nmake our city attractive, lively and stimulating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing this will require new thinking. But we can\r\n\r\ntake  encouragement from what others say of us, what they\r\n\r\nsee  in our efforts to achieve our ambitions.  Just a few\r\n\r\nweeks back, Motorola's top designer, Mr Iulius Lucaci, in\r\n\r\nan  interview with Streats, said that Singapore  has  the\r\n\r\npotential  to become a leading industrial design  centre.\r\n\r\nMr  Lucaci  should know.  He was one of the two designers\r\n\r\nbehind  Motorola's  revolutionary  V70  handphone,  whose\r\n\r\nsales exceeded $500,000 shortly after its launch.   If  I\r\n\r\nmay quote Mr Lucaci, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Form is now as important as function. Technology\r\n\r\nhas become a commodity, and it is the design that sets  a\r\n\r\nproduct apart from competitors.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the end, whether we fail or succeed depends\r\n\r\nnot just on the completeness of our plans.  It depends on\r\n\r\nour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspirit  and  will  to  see this through.   With  Members'\r\n\r\nsupport  and working closely with partners from  relevant\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies and the private  sector,  MITA  will\r\n\r\nendeavour to develop the design and media industries, and\r\n\r\nwe  will  endeavour  to  make the creative  industries  a\r\n\r\ncornerstone of our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Sir, the successful launch of\r\n\r\nthe  Esplanade  with  1.03 million  attendees  and  1,300\r\n\r\nartistes from 22 countries should be commended.   It  has\r\n\r\nbecome  a  centre  of  attention,  as  mentioned  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister.  Our dreams of becoming a regional arts hub and\r\n\r\na  global art city with a good world-class performing art\r\n\r\ncentre will come too sooner than expected.  And I learned\r\n\r\nthat  from  April to December last year, S$80 million  in\r\n\r\nmedia  advertising value was generated, with 1,200  media\r\n\r\narticles,  of  which one-third was overseas publications,\r\n\r\nincluding the New York Times, Washington Times, USA Today\r\n\r\nand  South China Morning Post.  The other key achievement\r\n\r\nis  that  the Esplanade staged 421 free performances  and\r\n\r\nover-1,000  visual  arts  exhibitions  for  1.5   million\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is another intangible achievement\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Minister may know.  It is that even  ordinary\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are cracking jokes on the Esplanade.  I will\r\n\r\nalso  consider  this as an achievement.  That  shows  the\r\n\r\nEsplanade belongs to the ordinary Singaporeans.  Since we\r\n\r\nhave time and, Mr Speaker, you are in good mood ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are catching up quite fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Yes. I will give a very quick\r\n\r\njoke.   One day, the Minister, Senior Minister of  State,\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary Secretary, the Permanent Secretary and\r\n\r\nsome  senior officials were deciding on the name of  this\r\n\r\nbuilding.   So  they reviewed all the proposals  -  there\r\n\r\nwere  long  names,  short names - sexy  names,  sensitive\r\n\r\nnames, and they went through them one by one.  Some  were\r\n\r\ntoo  sensitive,  eg, if you pronounce it  in  Hokkein  or\r\n\r\nCantonese, it may convey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother meanings.  So the Minister decided that they should\r\n\r\ncall   for  coffee/tea  to  excite  them  to  give   more\r\n\r\nappropriate  names.   So  coffee  was  served,   and  the\r\n\r\nMinister asked the three girls who served coffee, \"Girls,\r\n\r\nwe have problem in naming this building.  Can you give us\r\n\r\nsome ideas?\"  So one Malay girl said, \"Explain, lah!  Why\r\n\r\nyou  give this building a funny shape of a durian?\"   The\r\n\r\nIndian  girl  asked, \"Explain, lah!  Why  you  have  this\r\n\r\nfunny  fly  eyes?\"  The third girl asked, \"Explain,  lah!\r\n\r\nIf  we  open this up, what will we see inside?\"  So  when\r\n\r\nthey  left,  the Minister said that since the Malay,  the\r\n\r\nChinese  and the Indian girls all said, \"Explain,  lah!\",\r\n\r\nlet  us  decide on \"Esplanade\".  I would say this  is  an\r\n\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the durian scent to entice Singaporeans to\r\n\r\ntaste  this  fruit has spread wide.  In  Chinese,  it  is\r\n\r\ncalled   liu   lian   piao   xiang,   chu   chu   wen   (\r\n\r\n).   I  would  like  to  urge MITA to  ensure  that  this\r\n\r\n\"durian\"  can  sustain its drive with adequate  attention\r\n\r\nand budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Miss Penny Low. No more durian joke,\r\n\r\nplease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, I would like to continue this\r\n\r\ntalk on the Esplanade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Renaissance City Report 1, the stated aims\r\n\r\nwere  to  make  Singapore into a global arts  city.   The\r\n\r\nEsplanade   opened  with  great  fanfare  last   October,\r\n\r\nsignalling  that  Singapore is  geared  up  to  the  next\r\n\r\nsparkling star in the global arts scene.  Much money  and\r\n\r\nhopes are on the Esplanade.  Hence, I would appreciate it\r\n\r\nif  the Minister can provide some interim numbers on  the\r\n\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What has been the box office income since\r\n\r\nopening,  and the number of performances and audience  it\r\n\r\nhas attracted?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The accounts for FY 2001/2002 show that there\r\n\r\nis  a  substantial Government grant of over $12  million,\r\n\r\nfor which a total of $7 million was expended.  There\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis therefore an excess of $5 million of Government grant.\r\n\r\nCould  the  Minister shed light on how the  excess  grant\r\n\r\nwould be utilised?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that to make it affordable, many of the\r\n\r\nshows in Esplanade are actually subsidised.  What is  the\r\n\r\nextent  of  this subsidy, and how much will it  cost  the\r\n\r\nMinistry on a yearly basis?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that many marketing initiatives\r\n\r\nhave  been  planned  for this year.  Would  the  Minister\r\n\r\nplease comment on what will be the expected results as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  these activities, and how it will  place  the\r\n\r\nEsplanade  as a sought-after performance venue  vis-a-vis\r\n\r\nthat of Sydney Opera House, Carnegie Hall, and even Royal\r\n\r\nAlbert  Hall of London?  In addition, what is the  amount\r\n\r\nthat  has  already  been spent on the  publicity  of  the\r\n\r\nEsplanade,  and is there any measure of  the  return?   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  the international  press  has  actually\r\n\r\npicked  up on the Esplanade quite a bit.  Perhaps  it  is\r\n\r\ngood   to   share  the  good  news  with  the   rest   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could I also refer you to the table that I have\r\n\r\njust     distributed,    comparing    Singapore's    arts\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  and  audience participation  with  bigger\r\n\r\ncities like London and New York, as well as similar  size\r\n\r\ncities like that of Glasgow, Hong Kong and Melbourne.  It\r\n\r\nis  quite obvious from the figures that Singapore's  arts\r\n\r\nscene lags far behind the cities listed, both in terms of\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  as well as software like  arts  companies\r\n\r\nand  audience.   What  are  the  plans  that  will  bring\r\n\r\nSingapore a step closer and, realistically, when can this\r\n\r\nobjective be achieved?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps to accelerate the appreciation and\r\n\r\nparticipation  in  the  arts among the  local  community,\r\n\r\ncould  the  Minister consider more internship  programmes\r\n\r\nfor  both school goers as well as members of the  public;\r\n\r\nmore educational backstage tours for locals and tourists;\r\n\r\nand perhaps to dedicate a week per year to show off local\r\n\r\ntalents,  ie,  a local talent festival of sorts,  in  the\r\n\r\nEsplanade,  as  the Esplanade is seen as the  prestigious\r\n\r\nperformance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvenue and a great morale booster for all involved?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, is there any plan to build\r\n\r\nsmaller but good performance theatres, so there could  be\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  good  productions  like  the   highly\r\n\r\nacclaimed  local  musicals,  Siamese  Twins,  to  have  a\r\n\r\npermanent performing stage?  This is, in fact, one of the\r\n\r\ncritical success factors in grooming the performing  arts\r\n\r\nscene  like that in London, New York and even Las  Vegas.\r\n\r\nWe  may  not have the critical mass to sustain the shows,\r\n\r\nbut  this  is  also  the  case in  the  venues  that  are\r\n\r\nmentioned  above.  Most of them, in fact, depend  on  the\r\n\r\ntourist market and have been relatively successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> The National Arts Council's\r\n\r\nsupport for local arts professionals cannot be emphasised\r\n\r\nenough here.  Its mission to nurture the arts and make it\r\n\r\nan  integral part of the lives of the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nis  clearly  an  important one.  NAC's  progress  in  the\r\n\r\npromotion  of arts appreciation includes the arts  grants\r\n\r\nand  awards,  arts  in  the  heartland  programme  and  a\r\n\r\nsignificant increase in the number of quality arts events\r\n\r\nand  festivals.  This has added colour to our arts scene.\r\n\r\nWe  are  providing funds and building the  infrastructure\r\n\r\nrequired.  However, I believe that an equal importance to\r\n\r\nthe  arts  professionals exposure is  important  too.   A\r\n\r\nplatform  to  be  heard by crowds can  also  propel  them\r\n\r\nforward.  Hence, I support the call by Miss Penny Low  to\r\n\r\nprovide  the opportunity for our local arts professionals\r\n\r\nand artists on the scale of the Esplanade, for example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I have the following questions for the\r\n\r\nMinistry.  What else are we doing to improve the exposure\r\n\r\nof  local  talents  and artists?  Do we  give  our  local\r\n\r\nperformers  equal  or better treatment  compared  to  the\r\n\r\nforeign ones?  How do we select recipients of grants  and\r\n\r\nawards?   Can the process be more transparent?   To-date,\r\n\r\nhow many and who are the recipients of these awards and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrants?

It is commonly known as  busking  and\r\n\r\nit  is  an  art form that dates back to the old  days  of\r\n\r\ncourt  jesters  and travelling minstrels.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\ncolourful  buskers are rather inconspicuous here,  and  I\r\n\r\nwonder if the Minister would do more to encourage it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I surfed the website of the National Arts\r\n\r\nCouncil to see what it takes to be a busker in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  litany of do's and don'ts,  conditions  and\r\n\r\nindemnities  and,  of  course, the  omnipresent  fine  of\r\n\r\n$10,000  for  breaching  the  Public  Entertainment   and\r\n\r\nMeetings Act.  In order to perform in Singapore, first, a\r\n\r\nbusker  has to secure a letter of endorsement  from  NAC.\r\n\r\nWith  NAC's  endorsement, the busker would then  have  to\r\n\r\nseek  approval from property owners and then go  back  to\r\n\r\nkeep  NAC  informed.   Over and above  this,  any  monies\r\n\r\nreceived are to be donated to an arts group or charity of\r\n\r\ntheir  choice after offsetting their transport and  other\r\n\r\nexpenses.   In other words, we do expect them to  perform\r\n\r\nfree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we want a vibrant, dynamic and entertaining\r\n\r\nbusking scene in Singapore, we need to relook at some  of\r\n\r\nthe  terms and conditions surrounding busking activities.\r\n\r\nLet  me  state that I am not against rules, but I am  for\r\n\r\nsimplifying them.  It would make a lot of sense to have a\r\n\r\none-stop  registration for buskers,  instead  of  two  or\r\n\r\nthree  stops process.  Or what about an online system  to\r\n\r\nkeep   pace  with  the  e-Government  initiative?    Some\r\n\r\nprofessional buskers are travellers who are in  Singapore\r\n\r\nfor  just  a  few days and to devote a full  day  running\r\n\r\naround  Government buildings is certainly  not  on  their\r\n\r\nagenda.  It would dissuade buskers to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the rule on income. Buskers are not\r\n\r\nallowed  to  earn  their keep.  Is it  because  they  are\r\n\r\nperceived as the traditional buay ko-yok men who in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChinese  movies are half-skilled, half-beggar or  conmen?\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  some are.  But many modern buskers are  serious\r\n\r\nartistes whose craft demands skills and experience, and I\r\n\r\nthink  we  should  respect that.   They  are  actors  and\r\n\r\nactresses  in  the theatre of life when  no  audience  is\r\n\r\nguaranteed.  Success depends on their skills to draw  and\r\n\r\nkeep  a  crowd.  Obviously, outright soliciting of  money\r\n\r\nshould  be  frowned upon, but money given voluntarily  in\r\n\r\nappreciation of the busker's art form should be perceived\r\n\r\nas their rightful reward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have had successful buskers festival every\r\n\r\nyear  since 1997 and have established ourselves as Asia's\r\n\r\nsecond  largest busking festival attracting some  400,000\r\n\r\nparticipants,  both  local  residents  and  visitors   to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We can do better.  Let me just benchmark  our\r\n\r\nbuskers festival to some of the more successful festivals\r\n\r\naround  the  world.  I present a table that I  have  just\r\n\r\ndistributed  for Members' reference.  In the  year  2002,\r\n\r\nSingapore  River  Buskers Festival saw an  attendance  of\r\n\r\n400,000  and 17 international artistes.  The duration  of\r\n\r\nthe  festival  was  seven days.  In Italy,  there  was  a\r\n\r\nFerrara   Buskers   Festival   that   attracted   800,000\r\n\r\nattendance, but they had 669 international artistes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Miss Low, you have got to end your\r\n\r\nbusking soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> And, of course, in New Zealand too.\r\n\r\nI  could  refer  you  to the table.   Sir,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nguarantee  that simplification of the rules  itself  will\r\n\r\nbuild numbers.  I would like to suggest that perhaps even\r\n\r\na corner be considered to be allocated to the buskers, as\r\n\r\nin  the  case of Centre Pompidou in Paris where the  area\r\n\r\nserves  as  a  meeting  point  for  busker-wannabes   and\r\n\r\nveterans,  to  learn  and exchange tips  and  experience.\r\n\r\nThis  place  has in fact become a tourist  attraction  as\r\n\r\ntourists  flock  to see a side of the real  life  in  the\r\n\r\ncity.   This  way,  we  can  encourage  both  local   and\r\n\r\ninternational  buskers to do a second take  on  Singapore\r\n\r\nand, at the same time ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Time is up, Miss Low.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> --- increase tourist visits and add\r\n\r\nto the vim, wild and WOW! to liven up Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, last year, the North West CDC\r\n\r\nset up five cultural focus points to provide monthly arts\r\n\r\nand  cultural performances in the community.  A total  of\r\n\r\n53  performances were organised attracting  about  35,000\r\n\r\nresidents.  The CDC has worked with partners, such as the\r\n\r\nNational Arts Council, grassroots organisations,  schools\r\n\r\nand  various performing groups, to bring arts and culture\r\n\r\nto  the community.  The community outreach programme  has\r\n\r\nenhanced  the  quality of life of  our  residents.   Many\r\n\r\nresidents  have given positive feedback to these  various\r\n\r\nperformances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to thank the Ministry and the National\r\n\r\nArts  Council for the support they have given to the  CDC\r\n\r\nin  bringing  these performances to the  heartlands.   We\r\n\r\nhope  that more can be done to increase the collaboration\r\n\r\nbetween  the  CDC and the Ministry and the National  Arts\r\n\r\nCouncil.  May I ask the Minister two questions?  What are\r\n\r\nthe resources allocated by the Ministry for the community\r\n\r\narts  and  culture outreach programme?  And  what  public\r\n\r\neducation efforts are in place to increase the  level  of\r\n\r\nappreciation of arts and culture among Singaporeans?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, in our effort to move towards\r\n\r\na  renaissance  city and build a creative  industry,  one\r\n\r\nmajor prerequisite is the presence of a large talent pool\r\n\r\nto draw from, as well as the need to send a strong signal\r\n\r\nto  cultivate  and reward talents.  One such  signal  can\r\n\r\ncome  in  the form of a formal Arts School, where talents\r\n\r\nare identified and developed from a young age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I advocate a model similar to the Sports School with\r\n\r\na  tight  timeframe set.  The Arts School could emphasise\r\n\r\non  the  learning of techniques and exposure to the  arts\r\n\r\nwithout sacrificing the basic 3R's of Arithmetic, Reading\r\n\r\nand  Writing.   In addition, subjects like arts,  history\r\n\r\nand sociology could also be adequately taught\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso that artists and people in the creative industry could\r\n\r\nbe  up  to par with the socio-economic developments.   In\r\n\r\nshort,  the  Arts  School  is a  necessary  institutional\r\n\r\nsupport and push for the artistically-inclined, not  just\r\n\r\nto  learn to build basic foundations in arts, but also to\r\n\r\ngive greater exposure to the world and the world of arts,\r\n\r\nvia  different  works,  techniques, exchange  programmes,\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graduates of the Arts School should aim to be\r\n\r\ndynamic,  be able to communicate with the global audience\r\n\r\nand  improve  their  access  to  markets  and  career  or\r\n\r\nbusiness   opportunities.   Similarly,  they  should   be\r\n\r\ncapable  of encapsulating society's development  in  arts\r\n\r\nand   contribute  to  the  creative  goods  and  services\r\n\r\ncluster.   A  good example would be the designers  behind\r\n\r\nthe  Benetton clothes and Swatch watch who  are  able  to\r\n\r\ncommunicate  their idea on a small canvas and  market  it\r\n\r\nacross cultures and the globe with much success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we able to produce such people? I think so. We\r\n\r\nhave,  as  our  national pride, Mr  Tan  Swie  Hian,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Cultural  Medallion winner,  who  has  brought\r\n\r\nSingapore to the global stage recently by being the first\r\n\r\nSingaporean   to  be  conferred  the  prestigious   World\r\n\r\nEconomic Forum's Crystal Award at Davos, Switzerland.  He\r\n\r\njoins  world-renowned  artists,  like  Ravi  Shankar  and\r\n\r\nSidney  Poiter.   We have many others like  maestro  Choo\r\n\r\nHuei, potter Iskandar Jalil and the late playwright,  Kuo\r\n\r\nPao  Kun,  who  can bring glory to our country  with  the\r\n\r\nright system, infrastructure and incentives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if only just 1%, or approximately 400, of each\r\n\r\nstudent cohort gets talent spotted and groomed in an Arts\r\n\r\nSchool,  we  would  have  created  a  critical  mass  and\r\n\r\nmomentum  for  a  snowball effect to boost  our  creative\r\n\r\nindustry.   Let us not be half hearted about it  and  get\r\n\r\nthe  hardware,  which is the Arts School established,  so\r\n\r\nthat   the  software,  which  is  our  talents,  can   be\r\n\r\ninstalled, running and upgrading all the time, to help us\r\n\r\nface  the  challenges  of the New  Economy  at  broadband\r\n\r\nspeed!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> Sir, I must say that we have\r\n\r\ndone rather well lately in promoting the appreciation  of\r\n\r\narts.   We  have  clearly demonstrated  our  support  and\r\n\r\naspiration  to  turn  Singapore  into  an  artistic   and\r\n\r\nculturally  rich  society, rooted in  our  multi-cultural\r\n\r\nheritage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We still have some way to go. But I am certain we\r\n\r\ncan  turn Singapore into a vibrant, global city  for  the\r\n\r\narts  with  three  key  factors which  are  essential  in\r\n\r\nenhancing the current situation.  They are infrastructure\r\n\r\nand   facilities;   a  pool  of  talents,   artists   and\r\n\r\nprofessionals; and arts education and training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to hear the initiatives and efforts spelt\r\n\r\nout  by Dr Ng Eng Hen earlier on the part of MOE on  arts\r\n\r\neducation.   But  for MITA, my concerns are  as  follows:\r\n\r\nWhat  else  are  we doing to improve arts  education  and\r\n\r\nappreciation?  Is Singapore going to have an Arts School?\r\n\r\nIf  yes,  when  and  who  are MITA's  partners  for  this\r\n\r\nproject?   Is  Government's support and  funds  for  arts\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  reduced in this current economic  climate?\r\n\r\nAre the Esplanade and NAC working closely with schools to\r\n\r\nexpose  our  students  to world-class  quality  arts  and\r\n\r\nperformances?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, I should try to keep you in a\r\n\r\ngood mood.  But I think my mood has turned a bit.  So  no\r\n\r\nstories to begin with.  I thank Mr Seng Han Thong for his\r\n\r\njoke and shall count it as a joke for this session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arts, as many Members have noted, plays an\r\n\r\nimportant  part  in increasing our cultural  capital  and\r\n\r\ngrowing  our creative industries.  That actually is  good\r\n\r\nenough  reason.  However, we should continue  to  develop\r\n\r\nand  to  support the arts.  Let me recount  some  of  the\r\n\r\nprogress and reply to Members' queries and suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I do so, I want, at the very outset, to\r\n\r\naddress the point that Miss Penny Low has raised earlier,\r\n\r\nwhen  we  talked about creative industries, and  that  is\r\n\r\nwhether or not we will continue to promote art for  art's\r\n\r\nsake.  Yes, we will.  As I told this House last year, the\r\n\r\narts plays three important\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nroles  in  our society.  Firstly, it is a foundation  for\r\n\r\nour  cultural  heritage.  Secondly, it  is  a  source  of\r\n\r\naesthetic   inspiration  and  intellectual   stimulation.\r\n\r\nThirdly,  it  is a resource for the creative  industries.\r\n\r\nMITA values each and every one of these roles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, yes, we will continue to promote art for art's\r\n\r\nsake,  but we will also try to eke as much economic value\r\n\r\nout  of the arts as we can.   Mr Seng Han Thong has noted\r\n\r\nthat  the  opening of the Esplanade was one of  the  most\r\n\r\nsignificant events in the arts calendar last year.   More\r\n\r\nthan  1  million  people turned up  and,  now,  they  are\r\n\r\ncracking jokes about it.  Well, that is good.  Even  more\r\n\r\nsignificant  is  that  the event has  made  headlines  in\r\n\r\ninternational press and in arts magazines.  Net of ticket\r\n\r\nsales, we spent about $7 million on the opening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question has been asked: was it worth the money?\r\n\r\nI  think it was.  And I think Mr Seng will agree with me,\r\n\r\nespecially if I tell him that the Esplanade has estimated\r\n\r\nthat the publicity that we gained from the articles,  the\r\n\r\neditorials,  the testimonials written up on  the  opening\r\n\r\nfestivals were by themselves worth the equivalent of  $18\r\n\r\nmillion  of  paid advertising, and paid advertising  does\r\n\r\nnot  have  the  same  credibility as an  editorial  or  a\r\n\r\ntestimonial.     The   endorsements   from    world-class\r\n\r\nperformers    and   international   arts   critics    are\r\n\r\nimmeasurable.  And they have now placed the Esplanade and\r\n\r\nSingapore on a must visit, must see stop on their tours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benson Puah, the CEO of Esplanade, told me that, in\r\n\r\nthe  past,  it was hard for Singapore to get  world-class\r\n\r\norchestras to play here, and even if they were willing to\r\n\r\ncome,  they  would  ask  for  very  high  fees.   At  the\r\n\r\nEsplanade's   opening,  not  one  but   two   world-class\r\n\r\norchestras played - the London Philharmonic and  the  New\r\n\r\nYork  Philharmonic - in addition to our  own  SSO.   Now,\r\n\r\nBenson tells me, they get enquiries from top artists  and\r\n\r\ntroupes asking them when there is a slot available,  when\r\n\r\ncan they come and perform\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat the Esplanade.  They still ask for somewhat high fees,\r\n\r\nbut  he  has got a bargaining chip now and he can  haggle\r\n\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Esplanade has increased the value of Singapore's\r\n\r\nbrand  name  and it can do for us what the  famous  Opera\r\n\r\nHouse  has  done  for Sydney.  This will be  an  enduring\r\n\r\nasset, and it will have a tremendous impact, not just  on\r\n\r\nthe  arts  community  but on the  whole  economy.   This,\r\n\r\nagain,  is  reason why we must continue to  maintain  and\r\n\r\nsupport the Esplanade as a world-class facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, significant and impactful as the opening of the\r\n\r\nEsplanade was, it was only one of the many things we have\r\n\r\ndone  to  promote the arts in Singapore.  Several Members\r\n\r\nhave  offered suggestions and asked questions as to  what\r\n\r\nmore  we can do to promote the arts to support our  local\r\n\r\nartists.  Let me take Members back three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years ago, my predecessor, Mr Lee Yoke Suan,\r\n\r\npresented  to  this  House the Renaissance  City  Project\r\n\r\n(RCP)  to  make Singapore a global city of the arts,  and\r\n\r\nParliament approved a budget of $50 million to  be  spent\r\n\r\nover five years to further promote what some Members have\r\n\r\ncalled the software and customer aspects of the arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to report that this project has\r\n\r\nyielded  dividends.  Although I will  not  have  time  to\r\n\r\nrecount   all   the  successes,  I  will   mention   some\r\n\r\nhighlights.   Last  year, for the first  time  ever,  the\r\n\r\nfigure of ticketed attendance for performing arts crossed\r\n\r\nthe $1 million mark.  This was about 5-6% higher than the\r\n\r\nyear  before,  and  very creditable, given  the  economic\r\n\r\nconditions.   I  think  it shows  that  Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nbeginning  to take an interest in the arts and  beginning\r\n\r\nto see the value, because these are ticketed performances\r\n\r\nwhere they have to come up with hard cash in order to see\r\n\r\nthe performances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there are many reasons why there is this\r\n\r\ngreater interest.  For one, the NAC has worked very  hard\r\n\r\nto create\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreater  awareness  and  also to raise  the  quality  and\r\n\r\nvariety of programmes that are available at the different\r\n\r\nvenues.  So, there is now something to suit every  taste.\r\n\r\nAnother reason - and one that I would want to single  out\r\n\r\n- is the rising quality and fame of our own artists.  Our\r\n\r\narts companies are making a name for themselves globally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Singapore Dance Theatre performed\r\n\r\nto  8,000 people at the Cervantino International Festival\r\n\r\nin  Mexico  last  year, the first time a  Singapore  arts\r\n\r\ngroup  took part in that event.  In 2001, two years  ago,\r\n\r\nfour  of our young artists - Suzzan Victor, Matthew Ngui,\r\n\r\nSalleh  Japar and Chen KeZhan - were invited, again,  for\r\n\r\nthe first time ever, to the Venice Biennale, which is the\r\n\r\nmost  important visual arts exhibition and  show  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  This year, three more artists, ie, Tan Swie Hian,\r\n\r\nFrancis  Ng  and  Heman Chong, had been  invited  to  the\r\n\r\nVenice  Biennale.  I think the world has taken note  that\r\n\r\nwe  do  have some good artists.  And, as Miss  Penny  Low\r\n\r\npointed   out,  Tan  Swie  Hian  was  also  awarded   the\r\n\r\nprestigious Crystal Award by the World Economic Forum  in\r\n\r\nJanuary this year, the first Singaporean to receive  this\r\n\r\naward.  Ong Keng Sen was invited to curate at Berlin arts\r\n\r\nfestival, In Transit, last year in Germany, and the plays\r\n\r\nof  the  late  Kuo  Pao  Kun were performed  to  sell-out\r\n\r\naudiences at the Biennale Asian Arts Festival in Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many, many more deserving artists and arts\r\n\r\ngroups that I am unable to acknowledge, for lack of time.\r\n\r\nBut,  as Members can see, Singapore artists are making  a\r\n\r\nname  for themselves, and they are not the blind pathetic\r\n\r\nerhu players that Miss Low talked about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MITA will continue to help source new opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  our  artists  to gain international  exposure.   One\r\n\r\nexample of this is an MOU that we are working with China,\r\n\r\nwhich  we hope to conclude this year, that will pave  the\r\n\r\nway  for  our  artists to perform there  regularly  every\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure Miss Penny Low and Mr Zainudin that we are\r\n\r\nvery mindful of helping\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour local artists to grow and excel.  We have the talents\r\n\r\nand,  if  we  continue to nurture them,  recognise  their\r\n\r\ntalents,   take  pride  in  their  work,   attend   their\r\n\r\nperformances, I am sure we will have even more  successes\r\n\r\nto report in the years ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, we are now entering the fourth year of the\r\n\r\nRenaissance  City  Project.  Demand for  RCP  funding  is\r\n\r\nstrong because of the rapid growing interest in the arts,\r\n\r\nboth  by the public at large and also the private sector.\r\n\r\nSo, we are now working on plans for a second RCP project.\r\n\r\nWe  should move quickly into this next phase and build on\r\n\r\nthe  momentum  that  the first RCP has  created,  because\r\n\r\nother countries in Asia are doing so.  They have seen the\r\n\r\nimportance  and the benefits of the arts,  and  they  are\r\n\r\ninvesting  and  implementing major arts  projects.   Hong\r\n\r\nKong,  for  example, has embarked on  a  40-hectare  West\r\n\r\nKowloon  Reclamation Project that will house Hong  Kong's\r\n\r\nnew cultural belt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three major art shows have established themselves in\r\n\r\nAsia   -  Shanghai,  Guangdong,  and  Kwangju  in  Korea.\r\n\r\nPractically  overnight,  these  have  become   the   most\r\n\r\nimportant  art  shows  in  Asia.   Shanghai  opened   its\r\n\r\nShanghai  Grand  Theatre  five  years  ago  and  is   now\r\n\r\ndeveloping the Oriental Art Centre at Pudong, which  will\r\n\r\nfeature, like we have, a 2,000-seat hall and a 1,800-seat\r\n\r\ntheatre.   We must move quickly and with equal speed  and\r\n\r\nconfidence,  if  we  are  not to lose  the  standing  and\r\n\r\ngoodwill that we have earned from the Esplanade  and  our\r\n\r\nRCP programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address some specific issues Members have\r\n\r\nraised.   Dr  Teo Ho Pin and Mr Zainudin wanted  to  know\r\n\r\nwhat  we  would do to promote community arts and culture.\r\n\r\nI  agree  with Dr Teo that we must do more to  bring  the\r\n\r\narts to the people and the people to the arts.  This way,\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans can enjoy the arts, not just the  well-heeled.  We have programmes to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Esplanade, for example, has made an on-going\r\n\r\ncommitment  to  stage  community arts  performances  that\r\n\r\nwould appeal to a wide spectrum of people.  I do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot think we should just set aside one week a year to  do\r\n\r\nthis,  but we should have programming all throughout  the\r\n\r\nyear  that  is  accessible and open to the  community  at\r\n\r\nlarge.   Last year, NAC sponsored some 90 community  arts\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  such as Concerts in the Park, and  community\r\n\r\narts  groups, and many community arts groups  took  part,\r\n\r\nand we will continue to do so this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also encourage more corporations to follow\r\n\r\nthe  excellent example of the LTA to make more provisions\r\n\r\nfor  arts  to  be  displayed in corporate  buildings  and\r\n\r\npremises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low suggested that we should simplify our\r\n\r\nrules for busking and allow buskers to keep more of their\r\n\r\nearnings.  These ideas have also surfaced in the Remaking\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  discussions.   I  agree.    Buskers   add\r\n\r\nliveliness to our city and to our neighbourhoods,  and  I\r\n\r\nwill  ask my officials to work with the relevant agencies\r\n\r\nto  make  it easier for the buskers to busk, but  without\r\n\r\ncausing   too  much  nuisance  and  disruption   to   the\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low also asked whether we have plans to\r\n\r\nbuild new performance theatres.  I am glad to inform  her\r\n\r\nthat  the new National Library at Victoria Street,  which\r\n\r\nwill be completed by the end of 2005, will house the  new\r\n\r\nDrama  Centre.  This new centre will comprise a  642-seat\r\n\r\ntheatre  for mid-sized productions, and also  a  120-seat\r\n\r\nblack  box  theatre  for  experimental  theatre.   If  we\r\n\r\ncompare  ourselves to other countries, we  can  say  that\r\n\r\nthere are other cities that have more facilities than  we\r\n\r\nhave.   There  are larger, older cities with  a  stronger\r\n\r\ntradition  in  the  arts.   But  we  are  not  short   of\r\n\r\nfacilities  in  Singapore and, as we make  use  of  these\r\n\r\nfacilities,  ie, the hardware that we already  have,  and\r\n\r\nbuild  up the software, I think we can consider  and,  at\r\n\r\nthe right time, look to see what other new facilities  we\r\n\r\nneed to build.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have to do it as much as possible in as\r\n\r\nclever a way as we can to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmake full use of the limited funds that we have.  By  co-locating the new Drama Centre at the National Library, we\r\n\r\nnot  only  make  better use of that space -  because  the\r\n\r\nlibrary  can  also use it - but we put it in  a  district\r\n\r\nwhere  there  are  many  other  arts  institutions   and,\r\n\r\nhopefully, that would spark off more synergy.   So,  this\r\n\r\nis  the  approach that we want to take, to try to cluster\r\n\r\nthese activities and groups together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin wanted to know whether funds would still\r\n\r\nbe  available  for  local arts groups,  in  view  of  the\r\n\r\nlimited  money we have in our budget.  For  the  artists,\r\n\r\nmoney  is  always not enough.  But I am glad  to  let  Mr\r\n\r\nZainudin  know that MITA will maintain our existing  arts\r\n\r\nschemes  to  support our local arts groups.  But  funding\r\n\r\narrangements for the Esplanade - which is what some local\r\n\r\narts  groups have raised as a concern - will not draw  on\r\n\r\nthe  funds that we have already set aside for these other\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   But  we  are  in  the  midst  of  difficult\r\n\r\neconomic times, and I hope arts groups will understand if\r\n\r\nwe have to tighten our belts a little.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to look for new sources of support.\r\n\r\nOur  private companies have been very supportive  of  the\r\n\r\narts,  but  our  goal  really is not  just  to  look  for\r\n\r\ncharitable contributions.  Our goal is to work  with  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector to get them to see where the arts  can  be\r\n\r\nof  value  to  them to raise their image to impact  their\r\n\r\ncorporate activities and, in some way, to get more  value\r\n\r\nout  of the arts for the businesses, and then we will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  ask  the businesses to contribute more  to  the\r\n\r\narts.  Last year, private corporations gave $37.1 million\r\n\r\nto  the  arts, about the same amount as the  year  before\r\n\r\nand,  given again the difficult conditions, I think  that\r\n\r\nis good support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, Mr Loh Meng See, Miss Penny Low and Mr\r\n\r\nZainuddin have asked about arts education in our schools,\r\n\r\nwhether  MITA intends to start an Arts School.   I  agree\r\n\r\nthat  we should have a stronger emphasis for the arts  in\r\n\r\nour  schools,  and I am indeed glad to  see  the  various\r\n\r\nmeasures that MOE has already\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaken  today.   In 2002, NAC's arts education  programme,\r\n\r\nwhich we do with the support of the schools, reached  out\r\n\r\nto  98%  of our schools - practically everyone of them  - and  involved about 60% of our total student  population.\r\n\r\nSo,  about  60%  of  our students had an  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  or  look  at arts  programmes.   But  as\r\n\r\ninterest in the arts grows, it is timely that we look  at\r\n\r\nthe  feasibility  of setting up an Arts  School  or  some\r\n\r\nother  means  to  provide an enhanced curriculum  in  the\r\n\r\narts, in tandem with an academic programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure that the Arts School will follow\r\n\r\nexactly the model of the Sports School.  Our goal is  not\r\n\r\njust  to produce artists.  Certainly, if we have  such  a\r\n\r\nschool  or arrangement, we would want to prepare some  of\r\n\r\nthe students to become professional artists or to take up\r\n\r\nan  arts career.  But, at the same time, I think  we  can\r\n\r\nalso produce students who have a strong foundation in the\r\n\r\narea of the arts that they enjoy, and then go on to other\r\n\r\ncareers.  In this way, we can give our students, who have\r\n\r\na  bent  for the arts, more career options while  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time  nurturing their artistic talents.  MITA  will\r\n\r\nset  up  a committee to look at this shortly and it  will\r\n\r\ninvolve  and  work  very closely  with  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although we have made much progress in the\r\n\r\narts,  there is still much that needs to be done to  grow\r\n\r\nand  support the arts.  I will ask NAC to look  into  the\r\n\r\nmany suggestions that the other Members have raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year was a milestone year for us in the arts,\r\n\r\nbut  it was also a sad year with the demise of two of our\r\n\r\nmost  outstanding and well-loved artists, Brother  Joseph\r\n\r\nMcNally and Kuo Pao Kun.  The arts community mourns their\r\n\r\npassing   but,  at  the  same  time,  we  celebrate   the\r\n\r\nfoundation that they had laid, the legacy that  they  had\r\n\r\nleft behind.  They have built a very good foundation  for\r\n\r\nmany generations of artists to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the foundation of all who have laboured to build\r\n\r\nthe  arts, and with the support of this House, MITA  will\r\n\r\nendeavour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  make Singapore a global city for the arts.  I do  not\r\n\r\nknow  if  we will become the London of the East,  or  the\r\n\r\nParis  of  the East or the New York of the East,  because\r\n\r\nthese  are all great arts cities.  But I think if we  all\r\n\r\ncontribute,  and  we can build up our  cultural  capital,\r\n\r\ncreate  a more gracious society and contribute to a  more\r\n\r\nvibrant  economy, this will be a city that  we  will  all\r\n\r\nwant to live in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Sir, since your mood has\r\n\r\nchanged, I will not tell another joke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Censorship Review Committee's Report will be out\r\n\r\nsoon.   Could  the Minister enlighten us on the  possible\r\n\r\nrecommendations it is likely to make?  Will there be  any\r\n\r\nmajor  shifts in the censorship standards and approaches,\r\n\r\nand  if  there  are, whether adequate consultations  have\r\n\r\nbeen  made  by the Committee to ensure that  the  various\r\n\r\nsectors   of  our  society  are  comfortable  with   such\r\n\r\nrecommendations?  While we allow for greater  choice  for\r\n\r\nindividuals, along with a greater exercise of  individual\r\n\r\nresponsibility,  we  need  to strike  a  balance  between\r\n\r\nindividual choice and community's preference.  One lesson\r\n\r\nthat  we  can learn from the last CRC's Report  was  that\r\n\r\nMITA had to modify the \"R\" rating to \"R(A)\" due to public\r\n\r\noutcry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, on censorship, obviously\r\n\r\nsociety   has  changed  and  we  are  seeing  the   rapid\r\n\r\nintroduction  of technology, so the mood is  for  greater\r\n\r\nliberalisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to urge the Ministry to be very cautious\r\n\r\nin their response to opening up because I think there are\r\n\r\nfundamentals that we need to maintain.  I am particularly\r\n\r\nconcerned  with regard to the young. We are  seeing  over\r\n\r\nthe  Internet  young girls who innocently got  themselves\r\n\r\ninto  trouble because of massacre raiding adults.   Here,\r\n\r\nparents  play a very important role and we have to  teach\r\n\r\nour  young to be independent, and not to succumb to  peer\r\n\r\npressure, and to be well-equipped to stand up against all\r\n\r\ntemptations and situations that compromise themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have seen in the case of smoking, because we\r\n\r\ntake  an easy attitude, we are finding now that more  and\r\n\r\nmore of our young ladies are taking up smoking.  That  is\r\n\r\na form of censorship.  That is a lesson that we can learn\r\n\r\nwhen  we  try to open up, especially in finding a balance\r\n\r\nwith regard to how much to open up.  I think we should be\r\n\r\nespecially  cautious when the media can reach  our  homes\r\n\r\nand  the  children can have access to them.   For  public\r\n\r\nperformances,  we have to make sure that  there  are  not\r\n\r\nonly  the  audiences  involved but  also  the  performing\r\n\r\ngroups. It is important that we also uphold the integrity\r\n\r\nof all the performing arts groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, I would like to talk about\r\n\r\nTV  programmes.  Over the last few years, the quality  of\r\n\r\nour  TV programmes has, in fact, gone up.  They are  much\r\n\r\nbetter now. We see a lot of good documentaries on TV.  We\r\n\r\nalso  see  good Sitcoms like Phua Chu Kang and Under  One\r\n\r\nRoof,  which  capture nuances and different  flavours  of\r\n\r\nlife  in  Singapore  and which are  very  interesting  to\r\n\r\nwatch.  More of such programmes are definitely welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in recent times, there has been a\r\n\r\nspate  of TV programmes - I am specifically referring  to\r\n\r\nreality TV programmes - which I am a little bit concerned\r\n\r\nabout.   Let  me  assure Members that  these  reality  TV\r\n\r\nprogrammes are neither real nor realistic.  In fact,  the\r\n\r\nkind  of  values  and  lifestyles that  they  project  as\r\n\r\nacceptable, glamorous and fun, are clearly not consistent\r\n\r\nwith our own value system in society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to cite, in particular, two reality TV\r\n\r\nprogrammes  and  they  are  Temptation  Island  and   The\r\n\r\nBachelor.   Temptation  Island, if  Members  are  not  so\r\n\r\nfamiliar  with  the programme, refers to the  show  which\r\n\r\ncaptures a few young couples that are put together in one\r\n\r\nplace  and the real test of life for them is to show  how\r\n\r\nloyal they are to their partners.  For The Bachelor,  the\r\n\r\nprogramme concerns a man who is look-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ning  for  a  woman of his dream and the dream  women  are\r\n\r\nsupposed  to live up to his standards.  They have  to  do\r\n\r\nall kinds of things to try and attract his attention.  If\r\n\r\nMembers are interested in more details, they could  watch\r\n\r\nthe  television programmes.  I assure Members that  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  watch these programmes every night.  On one of those\r\n\r\ndays  when  I had a hard day in Parliament, I  went  back\r\n\r\nhome  to  do some channel surfing and happened to  chance\r\n\r\nacross these programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that the media has a tremendous\r\n\r\ninfluence  on the young.  Recently, a parent  told  about\r\n\r\nher  young  kid who, after watching the news coverage  on\r\n\r\nmurders  in  Singapore, and we had a few these  last  few\r\n\r\nmonths,  was wondering why people are killing each  other\r\n\r\nall the time and whether that was the norm. Obviously, we\r\n\r\nknow  that  is not the norm because people do not  murder\r\n\r\neach  other  every day in Singapore.  It is very  unusual\r\n\r\nand   rare.   But  children  cannot  distinguish  between\r\n\r\nreality  and  fiction.   So  certain  facts,  which   are\r\n\r\nconstantly  repeated, get distorted in their  minds.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we  are also concerned about the values  of  our\r\n\r\nyoung people. We see a lot of babies being abandoned,  we\r\n\r\nknow  of  cases of abortions increasing and so  on.   The\r\n\r\nsituation  is  very  complex now  because  young  people,\r\n\r\nunlike  in  the  past, are now subject to  all  kinds  of\r\n\r\ndifferent  ideas and messages.  In those  old  days,  the\r\n\r\nmessage  that constantly gets reinforced in  us  is  very\r\n\r\nclear - from parents, schools, the community. But now, it\r\n\r\nis  very  diffused.  It is different kinds of values  and\r\n\r\nmessages that get transmitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of that, Sir, the questions that I would\r\n\r\nlike   to   ask  are:   who  is  monitoring  our   media,\r\n\r\nparticularly  our  television?  Is  there  a  cause   for\r\n\r\nconcern?   What  can  be done to counter  some  of  these\r\n\r\nnegative  values that are being portrayed in the national\r\n\r\nmedia, particularly television?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, I would like to speak up for the arts community\r\n\r\nconcerning censorship laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our censorship laws fall short of what our vibrant\r\n\r\nsociety deserves. In any case,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Internet  has  made  censorship  almost  irrelevant\r\n\r\nbecause  it  allows  almost unrestricted  access  to  all\r\n\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Censorship should be replaced by regulation with a\r\n\r\nlight  touch.   Arts  requires  a  free  environment   to\r\n\r\nflourish  and  any set of rules which is too  restrictive\r\n\r\nwill  undermine the renaissance city goal.  The following\r\n\r\nthree  principles, as proposed by the arts community,  in\r\n\r\nfavour of rules, should be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, the rules should acknowledge the diversity of\r\n\r\nmodern  Singapore  and, in fact, allow for  the  greatest\r\n\r\npossible  expression of that diversity.  That requires  a\r\n\r\nclimate   of   reciprocal  tolerance,  which   means   an\r\n\r\nacceptance  of  other's  right  to  express  and  receive\r\n\r\ncertain  ideas and actions, and others accepting that  we\r\n\r\nhave  the  right not to be exposed against  our  will  to\r\n\r\none's expression of ideas and actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, classification by rating, supported by zoning\r\n\r\nand  belting.   Diversity requires  tolerance.  Tolerance\r\n\r\nenables choice. That exercise of choice is based  on  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  limited access and exposure,  rather  than\r\n\r\ntotal  blanket  bans  or  censors over  any  questionable\r\n\r\nmaterial.   A  regulatory system which bans nothing,  but\r\n\r\nallows  everything, through regulating  the  distribution\r\n\r\nand  access, should be set up. The model should be  based\r\n\r\non  a  system  of  rating, zoning  and  belting.   Rating\r\n\r\nclassifies  works,  like films, books, plays,  magazines,\r\n\r\netc,  according to their content, and imposes age  limit,\r\n\r\nlike  the current film ratings that we have.  Under  this\r\n\r\nsystem, no work is banned outright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoning classifies geographical areas when works of\r\n\r\ncertain  ratings are restricted to certain parts  of  the\r\n\r\ncity  or  certain areas within a bookshop, video shop  or\r\n\r\nretail  shop.   Belting classifies time period,  like  on\r\n\r\ntelevision or radio or types of media, such as newspapers\r\n\r\nor  restrictive circulation like magazines, according  to\r\n\r\nreach, imposing stricter limits on time period and  media\r\n\r\nwith  greater  reach according to the  rating.   So,  for\r\n\r\nobjectionable materials, like what\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMdm  Halimah has quoted earlier, it should be shown at  a\r\n\r\nlater time belt on TV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, the principle of brown-bagging should be\r\n\r\napplied  for printed works which fail the general  rating\r\n\r\ntest.

Politics in Singapore  has  been\r\n\r\ndominated and controlled very clearly and convincingly by\r\n\r\nthe People's Action Party since our independence in 1965.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be argued, Sir, that the PAP, through the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  has  in many ways, been very  successful  in\r\n\r\ncontrolling  or influencing the mass media,  directly  or\r\n\r\ndirectly, through legislation, rules and regulations,  or\r\n\r\nappointments  in senior positions, be it  on  radio,  TV,\r\n\r\nnewspapers  and  the relevant Ministries,  including  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Information, Communications and the Arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Ministry interested in the thinking of our\r\n\r\npeople  on politics in Singapore who may not be connected\r\n\r\nto  the  PAP or, for that matter, any political party  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  eg, political scientists in the  universities\r\n\r\nand  think-tanks, like the Institute of  Policy  Studies,\r\n\r\nInstitute of Southeast Asian Studies, Singapore Institute\r\n\r\nof   International   Affairs,  etc,  the   various   non-governmental   organisations  and   civic   groups,   the\r\n\r\nundergraduates and even commentaries and reports of local\r\n\r\nand   international  publications,  and  reports  by  the\r\n\r\nforeign  press,  TV  and  radio  broadcasters,  like  the\r\n\r\nBritish Broadcasting Corporation?  The perception is that\r\n\r\nthere  is  still a very strong control from the political\r\n\r\nleadership and the OB markers, as far as politics and the\r\n\r\nmedia  are  concerned, seem to be one of  less  tolerance\r\n\r\ncompared  to  the  other activities in Singapore.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult, the citi-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nzenry would remain passive when it comes to discussion on\r\n\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister also confirm that our\r\n\r\njournalists,  political  news  commentators  on  TV   and\r\n\r\npublications  are  given freedom to write  critically  on\r\n\r\npolitical matters in Singapore?  If the Ministry does not\r\n\r\nagree with this perception of control and if it is of the\r\n\r\nview  that  politics and the media in  Singapore  are  as\r\n\r\nliberal  as it can possibly be, may I invite the Ministry\r\n\r\nto  seriously have a dialogue session with interested and\r\n\r\nconcerned  Singaporeans and stakeholders to  revisit  and\r\n\r\nanalyse critically what needs to be done in terms of  the\r\n\r\npieces   of  legislation  on  politics  and  the   media,\r\n\r\nincluding  the Internet laws, the composition  of  senior\r\n\r\nofficials in the mass media and the avenues available  to\r\n\r\nthe  citizenry to be involved in politics and the  media,\r\n\r\nnot by politicians, but by the ordinary citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our citizens become more educated and assimilate\r\n\r\nideas  and freedom of the press in the western democratic\r\n\r\ncountries,  and with the easy access to information  from\r\n\r\nthe Internet and various publications, and the variety of\r\n\r\nnewspapers  available  in the global  arena,  it  may  be\r\n\r\nadvisable for us to be more liberal in order to create  a\r\n\r\nmore  vibrant  political spirit in Singapore.  Would  the\r\n\r\nMinistry,  on  the assumption that they are not  directly\r\n\r\ninvolved,  relay  the message, indirectly  through  their\r\n\r\ngreat  influence to the mass media, especially radio  and\r\n\r\nTV,  to  foster greater political debate and  discussions\r\n\r\namongst Singaporeans and have more political programmes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, I hope this will be my last\r\n\r\nspeech,  I  hope, before the break.  Sir,  let  me  first\r\n\r\naddress the issues that Mr Chandra Mohan has raised.   In\r\n\r\ngist,  he  is asserting that the Government controls  the\r\n\r\nmedia  in such a way that it does not allow for political\r\n\r\nviews to be heard.  Sir, this is not true.  You only have\r\n\r\nto open the newspapers and look at the Forum pages to see\r\n\r\nthat there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare   all  kinds  of  views  expressed  about  Government\r\n\r\npolicies.   I think every conceivable argument  on  every\r\n\r\nrelevant policy has been raised.  And, every time  a  new\r\n\r\nissue  comes  out you get a flood of letters  coming  in.\r\n\r\nTrue,  not every letter gets published because  there  is\r\n\r\nonly so much space available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think the editors make an effort to present a\r\n\r\nrepresentative slate of views and opinions when they pick\r\n\r\nthe  letters.   Sir,  when editors or journalists  decide\r\n\r\nwhat  they are going to write, or articles to publish  or\r\n\r\nwhat  letters they will print in the media, they have  to\r\n\r\nconsider whether these articles and letters, will inflame\r\n\r\nemotions,  whether they will harm our  social  fabric  or\r\n\r\ncompromise our national interests, or whether  they  will\r\n\r\nbreak  or contravene the laws of the land.  A responsible\r\n\r\neditor  will therefore not publish a letter or an article\r\n\r\nif   he   thinks  that  it  is  potentially   defamatory,\r\n\r\nseditious,  likely to cause racial hatred,  or  otherwise\r\n\r\nbreak the law.  For an editor to make such a decision, it\r\n\r\nis  responsible  journalism.   It  is  not  a  matter  of\r\n\r\npolitical censorship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me turn to the issue of censorship that the\r\n\r\nother  Members  have  raised.  We do have  censorship  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, as they do have in all countries.  Is it still\r\n\r\nrelevant,  as Mr Steve Chia has asked?  If censorship  is\r\n\r\nnot  relevant  because we can get all of these  materials\r\n\r\nanyway  on  the Internet, then would Mr Chia  expect  any\r\n\r\nreaction  at all tomorrow when we publish a  photo  of  a\r\n\r\nnude person on the front page of the newspapers?  I think\r\n\r\nhe  himself  would  not think that that was  appropriate,\r\n\r\neven  though  these  materials can  be  obtained  on  the\r\n\r\nInternet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah has expressed grave concerns that TV\r\n\r\nprogrammes such as Temptation Island or The Bachelor  can\r\n\r\ninstill  the wrong values in our children and  youth.   I\r\n\r\nhave  seen  half an episode of Temptation  Island.   Like\r\n\r\nyou,  on a busy day, at the end of the day when we switch\r\n\r\non  the  TV at night for a moment of relaxation,  and  it\r\n\r\ncomes  on  only  late  at night.  I  have  not  seen  The\r\n\r\nBachelor and so I cannot comment on it, but it does\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsound interesting and I will see if I can catch the  next\r\n\r\nepisode  -  the next time.  But it is for the  reason  of\r\n\r\nyour  concern that we have devised a set of  measures  to\r\n\r\nguide  our media on what can be shown, and at what times,\r\n\r\nand  on  which  channels.  Similarly, we  have  developed\r\n\r\nguidelines  for the theatres and the arts to  address  Mr\r\n\r\nLoh  Meng See's concern, that in the area of the arts  we\r\n\r\nshould  also  not  have artistic licence degenerate  into\r\n\r\nunacceptable expressions.  But, at the same  time,  I  am\r\n\r\nmindful  of the early exhortation when we discussed  arts\r\n\r\nand  the creative industry, that we should allow for more\r\n\r\nfreedom in our censorship rules.  Miss Penny Low  and  Dr\r\n\r\nTan Boon Wan have raised this.  If you want to succeed in\r\n\r\ncreating  a  livelier and more innovative  society,  they\r\n\r\nhave argued that we have to be a bit loose and a bit more\r\n\r\nrelaxed.  How can we do this and yet address the concerns\r\n\r\nthat Mdm Halimah and Mr Low have raised.  And this is the\r\n\r\nchallenge that we face in setting the rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our censorship rules and policies have been drawn\r\n\r\nup,  finessed  over time, and they have served  us  well.\r\n\r\nPeriodically, we do surveys and consistently they show  a\r\n\r\nhigh  level  of acceptance and comfort with  the  current\r\n\r\ncensorship norms.  We will never have 100% of the  people\r\n\r\nagreeing  with  us.   But, if we can get  70-80%  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation saying, \"Yes, we are quite comfortable.  These\r\n\r\nare  the  right standards\", I think we are not doing  too\r\n\r\nbadly.  Because, for the 20-30%, half of them wants us to\r\n\r\nbe  more  relaxed,  and the other half  wants  us  to  be\r\n\r\nstricter.   Having said that though, our society  is  not\r\n\r\nstatic  and  unchanging.  We are not insulated  from  the\r\n\r\nrest  of  the world, quite the contrary.  If we  want  to\r\n\r\nremake ourselves into a global city, we must become  even\r\n\r\nmore  aware of what is happening elsewhere, what are  the\r\n\r\ntrends,  what are the fashions, what are their  cultures,\r\n\r\nwhat  are their values, so that we can interact with  the\r\n\r\nrest  of  the  world and do business with.   And,  as  we\r\n\r\ntravel  and become more widely exposed, our own  people's\r\n\r\ninterests and attitudes and values will also become  more\r\n\r\ndiverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was why I decided last year to convene the\r\n\r\nCensorship Review Committee (CRC) to seek their views  on\r\n\r\nwhat  we should do to bring our censorship system  up-to-date.  Mr Seng Han Thong has asked about the progress  of\r\n\r\nthe  CRC  and  its  recommendations.  The  committee  has\r\n\r\nalmost  completed its work.  I will ask him to be patient\r\n\r\nand it would be out in a month or two.  But over the past\r\n\r\nyears,  they have held 21 meetings.  They have  consulted\r\n\r\nextensively.   They  have had 15 focus group  discussions\r\n\r\nand talked to more than 300 people and received many more\r\n\r\nrepresentations from the public at large.  They have also\r\n\r\ntaken in the views expressed in articles and commentaries\r\n\r\ncarried by the media, and commissioned a survey to obtain\r\n\r\ndirect public feedback on key censorship issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have raised a number of specific changes to\r\n\r\nour  censorship rules and I will pass these on to the CRC\r\n\r\nfor  consideration.  But, allow me to briefly  make  some\r\n\r\nobservations.   Mr Steve Chia has raised the  concept  of\r\n\r\nrating, zoning and belting.  This is not new.  We do this\r\n\r\nnow   in  terms  of  film  classifications,  as  he   has\r\n\r\nindicated,  in terms of shifting certain programmes  onto\r\n\r\nlate  night  television  or  allowing  certain  types  of\r\n\r\nprogrammes  only  on paid television and not  free-to-air\r\n\r\ntelevision, and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has hinted at the idea of brown-bagging\r\n\r\nmaterials.   I am not quite sure what he means.   But  in\r\n\r\nAmerica, where I lived for quite some time, brown bagging\r\n\r\nis  only done for pornographic materials.  I do not  know\r\n\r\nif Mr Chia is suggesting that we should have pornographic\r\n\r\nmaterials  on  sale in Singapore and, if so,  whether  he\r\n\r\ntruly  believes  that this will make Singapore  a  better\r\n\r\nsociety,  or  whether  he is just arguing  a  choice  for\r\n\r\nchoice's  sake.   If  we talk about such  materials,  the\r\n\r\nquestion  is not a question of choice.  It is a  question\r\n\r\nof  boundaries and where we want to draw the line.   Most\r\n\r\npeople,   I  think,  could  find  pornography  repulsive,\r\n\r\ndebasing, unacceptable.  Some may argue where exactly the\r\n\r\nline  should  be drawn between pornography  and  art  for\r\n\r\nentertainment.  Crossing this line would change the moral\r\n\r\ncharacter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  our  society.  So, in considering this point that  Mr\r\n\r\nChia  advocates,  we  must  ask ourselves  this  question\r\n\r\nwhether,  and  to  what  extent, we  want  to  shift  the\r\n\r\nboundaries  on pornography, and why?  Or, we  should  not\r\n\r\napproach it as a choice for choice's sake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See mentioned that we should be careful\r\n\r\nabout  what we show over the media in the homes.  I agree\r\n\r\nthat  we should be stricter in our free-to-air programmes\r\n\r\nbecause  that is what our children have easy  access  to.\r\n\r\nBut,  here  again, we have another dilemma.  Parents  may\r\n\r\nnot  always  agree on whether a particular  programme  is\r\n\r\nsuitable  for children or not.  In such instances,  would\r\n\r\nit not be better to let parents decide where they want to\r\n\r\ndraw   the   line  for  their  children,  and   to   take\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for their decision?   This  is  different\r\n\r\nfrom the point that Mr Chia had raised because it is  not\r\n\r\na  matter  of  shifting  the  boundaries  but  rather  of\r\n\r\nproviding  choice  within  the  broadly  accepted   moral\r\n\r\nmarkers  of  our  society.   But,  if  we  move  in  this\r\n\r\ndirection,   then  we  must  ensure  that  parents   have\r\n\r\npractical  tools  to  help control  what  their  children\r\n\r\nwatch.  And, there are tools today.  On subscription  TV,\r\n\r\nfor  example, the remote control allows parents to switch\r\n\r\noff  the programmes or the channels that they do not want\r\n\r\ntheir children to watch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the CRC expects to publish its report in a\r\n\r\nmonth  or  two, and so any comments at this  time  by  me\r\n\r\nwould be inappropriate by way of pre-empting what the CRC\r\n\r\nmay recommend.  But I can say that the CRC is considering\r\n\r\na wide range of issues including, inter alia, a review of\r\n\r\na   classification   standard   for   film,   video   and\r\n\r\nsubscription  TV,  the licensing and regulation  of  arts\r\n\r\ngroups,  and  whether other media, such  as  publications\r\n\r\nshould  also  be  classified  or  rated.   Whatever   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  and  changes  we  decide  to  make,  the\r\n\r\nchallenge is how to meet the opposing demands of allowing\r\n\r\nfor  more  choices, on the one hand, and  protecting  our\r\n\r\nyoung and our core values, on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in responding to the CRC report, I will be\r\n\r\nguided by a number of basic considerations.  Firstly,  we\r\n\r\nmust  develop our own approach.  We are a young  society,\r\n\r\nraised  on traditional values and seeking to fit  into  a\r\n\r\nglobal world.  We are also multi-religious, multi-racial,\r\n\r\nmulti-cultural.   We  therefore  cannot   simply   follow\r\n\r\nforeign  norms  or import ideas from societies  that  are\r\n\r\nculturally different from us.  It simply would not  work.\r\n\r\nWe  must develop our own formula and base these on  sound\r\n\r\nand clear principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we must look at the issues from all sides.\r\n\r\nThis is almost axiomatic.  But if we do not see or try to\r\n\r\nsee  the concerns of others, there is no reason why  they\r\n\r\nshould  see  our  concerns.  And if any  one  insists  on\r\n\r\nabsolute  freedom for himself, then he denies all  others\r\n\r\nany freedom at all.  So, if we hope to find workable ways\r\n\r\nto accommodate our different views and values, we must be\r\n\r\nprepared for some give and take, and to take progress one\r\n\r\nstep at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we should aim to move at a pace that the\r\n\r\nsociety,  as  a  whole,  can accommodate.   We  have  not\r\n\r\ndramatically changed our approach to censorship over  the\r\n\r\nlast  10 years, and yet anyone who has lived during  that\r\n\r\nperiod  will  recognise that we have  eased  up  in  many\r\n\r\nareas.   Friends who have come to visit us after  a  long\r\n\r\nwhile  feel  that it is different now, and yet acceptance\r\n\r\nof our current censorship norms is still very high.  This\r\n\r\nmeans  that  we have managed to find a workable  balance,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  the  tension between being too inflexible  and\r\n\r\nchanging too quickly, and we should continue to work  for\r\n\r\nsuch a balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, we must recognise that decisions\r\n\r\neventually have to be taken and then we have to move  on.\r\n\r\nAs  the CRC process demonstrates, the views of the public\r\n\r\nare widely canvassed when developing censorship policies.\r\n\r\nLikewise,  we  have many advisory and review  and  appeal\r\n\r\ncommittees.  The public inputs are obtained to guide  the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of censorship rules.  But  in  the  final\r\n\r\nanalysis, the Government, as elected leaders,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  decide  what the policies will be,  and  where  the\r\n\r\nlines, for the time being, will be drawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I appreciate the Members' concerns over our\r\n\r\ncensorship  rules.   MITA  will  study  the  CRC   Report\r\n\r\ncarefully when it comes out and we will look not only  at\r\n\r\nwhether some of the rules should be changed, but also how\r\n\r\nthe process of administering these rules can be improved.\r\n\r\nI  hope Members will continue to support us, give us  the\r\n\r\nfeedback, so that together, we can make a better  society\r\n\r\nfor our children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, since the dot.com saga, and\r\n\r\nthe  problems  of  the  telecommunication  industry,  the\r\n\r\ninterest in the infocomm industry appears to have  waned.\r\n\r\nThis  would be a great mistake.  It is right to cool  the\r\n\r\neuphoria  of  IT and telecommunication, but we  must  not\r\n\r\nlose  sight  of its relevance and importance to  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy.   Information  and telecommunication  technology\r\n\r\nunderpins  the  new  economy.  We have irrevocably  moved\r\n\r\ninto  a network and knowledge-based economy.  Traditional\r\n\r\neconomies  will  transit over to the new economy.   There\r\n\r\nwill  be  many  opportunities  for  us  in  the  infocomm\r\n\r\nindustry.   I  would thus like to ask the Minister  about\r\n\r\nthe  status of the infocomm industry.  What progress  has\r\n\r\nit achieved last year?  In view of its continuing growing\r\n\r\nimportance,  what plans does IDA have to further  develop\r\n\r\nthe  industry?

We\r\n\r\nhave   to   watch  domestic  competition,  but   domestic\r\n\r\ncompetition is not really important.  It is  how  we  can\r\n\r\ncompete against others in the region.

One  of  its   six\r\n\r\nstrategies is e-powering the people sector which  entails\r\n\r\nimproving  accessibility of infocomm technology  to  all,\r\n\r\nbridging  the digital divide and encouraging the adoption\r\n\r\nof e-lifestyle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in support of the Infocomm Plan 21, North West\r\n\r\nCDC has set up 24 IT training centres with 24 schools  in\r\n\r\nour district.  Last year, we trained 300 students to be e-ambassadors  to assist in our IT training programmes  for\r\n\r\nresidents.  We have also trained 1,300 residents in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNational IT Literacy course.  I wish to thank the IDA for\r\n\r\nits support given to the CDC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further encourage e-lifestyle, we hope to\r\n\r\norganise more IT outreach programmes for our residents in\r\n\r\nthe district.  In this regard, I wish to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Ministry  can  provide  more  resources  to\r\n\r\nsupport the CDC's efforts in e-powering our residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following\r\n\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) What is the status of development of the Infocomm Plan 21?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Are there specific programmes to support CDCs in e-powering our people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) What are the plans to promote e-Government services\r\n\r\nto Singaporeans, especially the heartlanders?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, may I take the\r\n\r\nopportunity to clarify on what the Minister said  earlier\r\n\r\nabout  pornography.   With regard to  pornography,  I  am\r\n\r\nactually  asking  about a light form of nudity  where  it\r\n\r\ncould  be  allowed  under  brown  bagging,  and  not  the\r\n\r\nhardcore pornography, as what the Minister may think.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will go on to my speech on e-mail spamming.\r\n\r\nAs  e-mail becomes more popular, many users are receiving\r\n\r\nan  increasing amount of the unsolicited commercial  mail\r\n\r\nknown  as spam.  Not only does spam make it difficult  to\r\n\r\nidentify  valid  e-mails,  some spams  contain  offensive\r\n\r\nmessage and images.  While I understand the difficulty of\r\n\r\nregulating  spammers and catching them, we  should  guard\r\n\r\nagainst  their  growth  within  our  community.    As   I\r\n\r\nunderstand   it,   there  are  private  individuals   and\r\n\r\nSingapore registered companies that are collating e-mails\r\n\r\nending  with dot.sg and selling them for a profit.   Such\r\n\r\nmarketing  of  private  individual  e-mail  addresses  is\r\n\r\nequivalent  to  the selling of our private telephone  and\r\n\r\nfax  numbers to telemarketers who will call us up and try\r\n\r\nto sell some redundant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproducts.  We need to guard against this proliferation as\r\n\r\nit will cause great inefficiencies and a breakdown of our\r\n\r\ne-mail  communication system.  As a Straits  Times  forum\r\n\r\nreader  puts it, \"as a company with 10 e-mail  addresses,\r\n\r\nimagine our daily frustration as our mail servers have to\r\n\r\ncope with the same junk e-mail multiplied 10 times.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this rare instance, I am in favour of legislation\r\n\r\nbanning  the  sale of private e-mail addresses.   At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, IDA needs to seriously do something  to  stop\r\n\r\nthe  growth of the spamming industry.  I look forward  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry to come out with a creative solution  to  a\r\n\r\ndifficult  problem.  Meantime, can the  Ministry  explain\r\n\r\nwhat course of action can victims of spamming take?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan (Senior Minister of State for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</b> Sir, let\r\n\r\nme  first  reply to the cuts on infocomm by Dr  Tan  Boon\r\n\r\nWan,  Mr  Loh  Meng See and Dr Teo Ho  Pin.   Their  cuts\r\n\r\nreminded  me of a speech I made just three weeks  ago  at\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Computer Society's Gala Dinner.   My  key\r\n\r\nmessage  to  them  that night was this: \"Let's  get  sexy\r\n\r\nagain!\"   Sir, this is not my solution to our  low  birth\r\n\r\nrates.   But like Dr Tan Boon Wan and others, I  sense  a\r\n\r\ncertain  loss of confidence in the infocomm industry.   I\r\n\r\ndecided  that I should give them a pep talk to point  out\r\n\r\nthe positives and urge them not to lose heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In infocomm, we have been sexy globally, and we can\r\n\r\nbe sexy again.  Just the other day, someone pointed me to\r\n\r\na  local  website, a chat group.  He said that there  was\r\n\r\nsome  discussion about my speech after it  was  made.   I\r\n\r\nremember reading this entry from, presumably, a lady.   I\r\n\r\nthink  she wrote something like, \"Actually, I rather  get\r\n\r\nsexy  with somebody like F4, one of the most popular  boy\r\n\r\nbands  now  in  Taiwan  -  tall, dark and handsome.   But\r\n\r\nsince  that is not possible and Minister made the  offer,\r\n\r\nokay lor,  boh pian\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, my serious speech and message were\r\n\r\ncorrectly received and understood by the ICT industry.  I\r\n\r\nreceived\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis e-mail from Mr Saw Ken Wye, Chairman of Singapore IT\r\n\r\nFederation.  He thanked me for my speech and the  message\r\n\r\nwhich  he  agreed.  And he wrote, \"The final chapter  for\r\n\r\nSingapore's IT industry has not been written yet  and  we\r\n\r\nhave  barely finished Chapter one.  And the beauty  about\r\n\r\nIT  is  that  it  is  an  industry that  can  continually\r\n\r\nreinvent  and rejuvenate itself.\"  I totally  agree  with\r\n\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at some hard data. The infocomm\r\n\r\nindustry is large.  In Singapore, it made up 7.9% of  our\r\n\r\nGDP.   It  is worth $28 billion and employs over  100,000\r\n\r\nICT  professionals.   Throughout the Asian  crisis,  from\r\n\r\n1998  to  2000, it grew by an average of 5.6% per  annum,\r\n\r\nhigher than the overall economic growth rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even now, the industry looks healthy. Where is the\r\n\r\nevidence?   First,  infocomm investments  remain  strong.\r\n\r\nLast  year,  it was the largest contributor of investment\r\n\r\ncommitments  in the services industry, with $870  million\r\n\r\nof  business spending, that will create $1.9  billion  of\r\n\r\ntotal value-add and 2,300 new jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, infocomm salaries remain attractive. Last\r\n\r\nyear,  salary increments averaged 3.5%, higher than  that\r\n\r\nfor other economic sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, our global ranking (in terms of networked\r\n\r\nreadiness) by the World Economic Forum went up from   No.\r\n\r\n8 to  No. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, we can be optimistic about our growth\r\n\r\nprospects.   As Mr Saw put it, the industry is resilient,\r\n\r\nbeing able to reinvent and rejuvenate itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Members should read the current issue of the\r\n\r\nEconomist,  where there is a special section on  what  it\r\n\r\ncalled  \"Telecoms  II\".   Its  conclusion  is  that  \"new\r\n\r\nwireless  technologies that render  bandwidth  irrelevant\r\n\r\ncould  kindle a revolution in communications bigger  than\r\n\r\nthe Internet\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industry players are betting big money on this\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  Just last week, Intel launched  its  latest\r\n\r\nchip,  the Centrino.  Intel already has its Pentium chips\r\n\r\nin almost all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndesk-top computers, and it is now betting on its Centrino\r\n\r\nchip  to be in most laptop computers.  It hopes that  its\r\n\r\n\"Intel  inside\"  act I could be followed by  a  \"Centrino\r\n\r\ninside\" act II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intel believes Centrino's spread will trigger a\r\n\r\nwireless  revolution  akin  to the  1960s  transformation\r\n\r\nbrought  about by the transistor radio.  That revolution,\r\n\r\nyou  may  remember, gave us all the freedom  to  use  the\r\n\r\nradio anytime, anywhere, any place.  Intel hopes that its\r\n\r\nCentrino  will  now allow us to use our laptop  computers\r\n\r\nanytime, anywhere, any place.  Now, that is cool!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SUN Microsystem has its own vision of this future,\r\n\r\nof course, based on its Java solution.  Scott McNealy was\r\n\r\nin town just a couple of days ago, and Members would have\r\n\r\nread about his plan in the newspapers.  Microsoft and IBM\r\n\r\nare no less ambitious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is well positioned to ride on these waves,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  our consistent efforts over  many  years  in\r\n\r\npromoting  infocomm, from Intelligent Island, through  IT\r\n\r\n2000 to Infocomm 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked about Infocomm 21. We continue to make\r\n\r\nprogress.  In two years, our telecommunications bandwidth\r\n\r\nhas  expanded by 400 times.  We now have 21  terabits  of\r\n\r\nhigh-speed   submarine   cable  bandwidth   with   direct\r\n\r\nconnections   to   more   than   100   countries.    Full\r\n\r\nliberalisation,  as  Members know,  has  already  brought\r\n\r\ntelecommunication costs down sharply for  both  consumers\r\n\r\nand business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globally, we are now a leading e-Government and have\r\n\r\nwon various international awards.  Our courts of justice,\r\n\r\nour  libraries,  our electronic road pricing  system  are\r\n\r\nworld-class showcases of e-Government efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, one in three Singaporeans uses broadband to\r\n\r\naccess on-line content from home, school or office.   The\r\n\r\nnumber  of  broadband users will soon reach one  million.\r\n\r\nThere are now more than eight wireless Local Area Network\r\n\r\n(LAN) service\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproviders  and  more  than  240  wireless  LAN   hotspots\r\n\r\nthroughout Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last month, I patronised a Japanese restaurant\r\n\r\nat  the  Esplanade.  It is one of such wireless hotspots.\r\n\r\nCustomers can access Internet on their laptops  at  high-speed.   Waiters  are armed with PDAs  so  that  customer\r\n\r\norders  are captured immediately and electronically,  and\r\n\r\ntransmitted  on-line to the kitchen, and, of  course,  to\r\n\r\nthe  cashier.   With  this  infrastructure  in  place,  I\r\n\r\nsuppose  the  next  step  for them  is  to  transfer  the\r\n\r\ninformation to the suppliers real-time, so that raw  fish\r\n\r\ncan be replenished as and when needed!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know if you plan to turn this House\r\n\r\ninto a wireless hotspot.  If you do, then some of us  can\r\n\r\nfollow  the development in Iraq real-time without  having\r\n\r\nto walk in and walk out, even as we debate the Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now reply to the specific queries by Members.\r\n\r\nDr  Tan  asked  about e-commerce.  It  has  continued  to\r\n\r\ngather momentum in Singapore.  Last year, the total value\r\n\r\nof business-to-business (B2B) transactions remained above\r\n\r\n$100  billion,  as  in the previous  year.   Business-to-consumer  (B2C)  spending has grown  by  20%,  from  $2.5\r\n\r\nbillion to $3 billion in 2002.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh asked about security concerns as they may\r\n\r\nhinder  the  growth of on-line businesses.  I agree  with\r\n\r\nhim that we need to maintain a trusted environment for e-commerce to flourish.  That is why much effort is put  to\r\n\r\ndeveloping  on-line security technologies  and  policies.\r\n\r\nOur approach is to adopt a combination of (a) legislation\r\n\r\nby  the  Government; (b) industry initiatives; (c)  self-regulation  by  the  industry; and  (d)  user  education.\r\n\r\nTime,  however, does not allow me to go into the  details\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked about e-Government. As I said just\r\n\r\nnow,  we can be proud of our achievements here.  Nine  in\r\n\r\n10  public  services can now be accessed  and  transacted\r\n\r\nelectronically, a total of over\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n1,500  public  services.  The e-citizen portal  attracted\r\n\r\nnearly seven million hits every month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also asked about the National IT Literacy\r\n\r\nProgramme (NITLP).  The purpose is to help bring basic IT\r\n\r\nskills  to  Singaporeans who missed out on IT  education.\r\n\r\nThe  target was to equip 315,000 Singaporeans with  basic\r\n\r\ncomputer  and Internet skills over three years.   Working\r\n\r\nthrough  28  training centres, the programme has  so  far\r\n\r\nbenefited more than 113,000 people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About six in 10 Singaporeans are now IT literate.\r\n\r\nOne  significant  achievement  is  this  mindset  change.\r\n\r\nThere  are many anecdotes of Singaporeans taking  to  the\r\n\r\nconvenience  of  e-Government,  SMEs  leveraging  on  the\r\n\r\nInternet for their business, and housewives logging  onto\r\n\r\nthe  Internet  for information and leisure.  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ndo  not  resist  IT for fear of layoffs or  displacement.\r\n\r\nThis  is a big achievement that many other countries  are\r\n\r\nstill working on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See talked about our telcos going\r\n\r\nregional  and whether our FTAs will be one  way  to  help\r\n\r\nthem  open up the market.  Although our domestic telecoms\r\n\r\nmarket  is still growing, our telcos know that they  need\r\n\r\nto  go  regional to secure long-term double digit growth.\r\n\r\nThe  activities of SingTel and StarHub in the region  and\r\n\r\nfurther afield have been well reported in the press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunities are there. First, growing middle\r\n\r\nclass   will  increase  the  market  size.   Second,   as\r\n\r\ncountries  open  up  their regime and lift  the  domestic\r\n\r\nprotection, there are new businesses for our  players  to\r\n\r\nparticipate.  Our various FTAs certainly help to speed up\r\n\r\nthe  process, as we persuade our FTA partners to give  us\r\n\r\nbetter market access.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh asked if the opportunities are more in\r\n\r\napplications  development or infrastructure  integration.\r\n\r\nI  think  it is both.  But industry players will have  to\r\n\r\nfocus,   as   always,  on  their  core   competency   and\r\n\r\ndifferentiate themselves from the competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now reply to Mr Steve Chia's cut on the\r\n\r\nsubject of junk e-mails, commonly called e-mail spamming.\r\n\r\nThere are really two parts to this issue.  First, can  we\r\n\r\nprosecute e-mail spammers?  Yes, we can.  E-mail spammers\r\n\r\ncan be prosecuted if the e-mail spam is serious enough as\r\n\r\nto  cause  a  degradation  of  the  computer  system  and\r\n\r\nresulting  in disruption of service.  Victims can  report\r\n\r\nto the Police who can pursue it under the Computer Misuse\r\n\r\nAct.   Members may remember -  I think it was  two  years\r\n\r\nago  -  there was such a case when someone was prosecuted\r\n\r\nfor  bombarding HDB's computer department with  something\r\n\r\nlike  7,500 junk mails over a period of 21/2 hours.   But\r\n\r\nthe  act  of  sending  unsolicited email  is  itself  not\r\n\r\nillegal.    When  used  appropriately,  it  is   a   very\r\n\r\nlegitimate form of marketing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect: is the unauthorised selling of\r\n\r\nemail  addresses  illegal  in  Singapore?   We  do   have\r\n\r\nsectoral legislation that contains provisions to  protect\r\n\r\nan   individual's  personal  information  and  that  will\r\n\r\ninclude  his or her email addresses.  For example,  under\r\n\r\nthe  Banking Act, banks are not allowed to sell the email\r\n\r\naddresses  of  their  customers.   Likewise,  under   the\r\n\r\nPrivate  Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act, it  would  be\r\n\r\nillegal  for hospitals and clinics to pass on  the  email\r\n\r\naddresses of their patients to a third party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if a company has collated email addresses\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Internet  or  from  the  Singapore  Directory,\r\n\r\nrepackage  it  and resell the information  to  interested\r\n\r\nmarketers,  the  marketers are basically  buying  already\r\n\r\npublic  information,  which they could  otherwise  obtain\r\n\r\nfree of charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last week, Minister David Lim received an\r\n\r\nunsolicited  email  from a company promoting  a  software\r\n\r\npackage  which  it  claims can,  and  I  quote,  \"harvest\r\n\r\nhundreds of thousands of email addresses within seconds\",\r\n\r\nand the word used is \"harvest\".  And this is the type  of\r\n\r\nspider which the industry talks about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, email spamming is a global phenomenon. We are\r\n\r\nnot alone.  It can be a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnuisance but overall the extent of spamming here is still\r\n\r\nrelatively  low.  How do other countries respond  to  it?\r\n\r\nIs there any good model for us to follow?  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nthe answer is no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is legislation effective? The US experience is that\r\n\r\nanti-spam laws are not effective.  The US has state  laws\r\n\r\nagainst  spamming, some dating back several  years.   But\r\n\r\ndespite  the  law, successful suits against spammers  are\r\n\r\nrare  and  the extent of spamming has not gone down.   In\r\n\r\nfact, it has gone up.  Australia too has concluded, after\r\n\r\na  study in August last year, that legislation alone will\r\n\r\nnot be effective in curbing spams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One reason why spams are difficult to eradicate is\r\n\r\nthat the majority of them originate from overseas.  Anti-spam  laws,  even  if  enacted,  do  not  have  effective\r\n\r\njurisdiction against spammers who are based overseas.  We\r\n\r\nhave  just to adopt a practical approach, comprising  (a)\r\n\r\nindustry  self-regulation; and  (b)  consumer  education.\r\n\r\nThis  approach  takes  into  account  and  balances   the\r\n\r\nlegitimate interests of businesses and consumers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this approach, our Internet Service Providers\r\n\r\n(ISPs)  have all adopted best practices to counter  spams\r\n\r\noriginating  from  their subscribers.   Each  ISP  has  a\r\n\r\npolicy  of  suspending  the  email  account  of  its  own\r\n\r\ncustomers.    Users  should  also  take   some   personal\r\n\r\nresponsibility to safeguard their email information, just\r\n\r\nas  we all do for our other personal particulars, such as\r\n\r\ntelephone numbers and residential addresses.  Some simple\r\n\r\ntips  I  would offer include the following: do not freely\r\n\r\ndisclose  your  email address; only disclose  your  email\r\n\r\naddress   to  organisations  or  websites  that  practise\r\n\r\npersonal  data  protection  principles;  and  of  course,\r\n\r\ninstall  anti-virus software.  As a parent, I  constantly\r\n\r\nremind my daughters about these tips.

I  think  it  is  one  of  the  most\r\n\r\ninnovative  statutory boards that we have  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand it is a challenge to make it even better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Sir, an area that I thought the Library can\r\n\r\nlook  into - in fact, I am surprised that they are  doing\r\n\r\nright  now in Shenton Way having that promotion -  is  to\r\n\r\nencourage   as  many  adult  readers,  particularly   the\r\n\r\nprofessionals, to make use of our public  libraries.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  if  we were to visit the library on a normal  day,\r\n\r\nthey  are  mainly  made  up  of  children,  students  and\r\n\r\nretirees making use of the facilities.  So, I think it is\r\n\r\nof  greater value and benefit, if more such adult readers\r\n\r\nmake use of our facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Sir, is the organisation of our libraries.\r\n\r\nThough  we  have regional libraries, I am just  wondering\r\n\r\nwhether some means can be found to provide for niche\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlibraries,  in  the sense that, either based  on  certain\r\n\r\nthemes  or interests, we can have a better collection  in\r\n\r\nparticular  areas  and  locations,  rather  than   having\r\n\r\nlibraries where the collection would actually be few  and\r\n\r\nfar between.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> Sir, personally, I feel that\r\n\r\nthe  National  Library Board (NLB) is  one  of  the  most\r\n\r\nprogressive statutory boards, as mentioned by Mr Loh Meng\r\n\r\nSee  just now.  It has done a highly commendable job,  in\r\n\r\nterms of providing accessibility to resources, and it has\r\n\r\nalso  effectively  utilised  technology.   However,   the\r\n\r\njourney  surely  cannot  end here.   The  library,  as  a\r\n\r\nknowledge centre, is still at its infant stage,  and  its\r\n\r\npotential for growth is immense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our economy slowly makes its way to become a full-fledged knowledge, I hope that the library will parallel\r\n\r\nthis  growth  or, better still, pave the way  and  create\r\n\r\nspace for lively debate and the sharing of knowledge.  It\r\n\r\ncan  very well be our next icon and join the ranks of the\r\n\r\nlibraries of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concerns are the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) What are the future plans of the NLB towards\r\n\r\nmaking our libraries the community knowledge centres?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) What is the progress of the library\r\n\r\nconstruction  and  development  in  Singapore,  eg,   the\r\n\r\nNational Library and the Community Libraries?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Many have expressed regrets and sadness on the\r\n\r\npossible  loss  of our National Library.   What  are  the\r\n\r\nplans of NLB for the new National Library?  Would it be a\r\n\r\nlibrary that many will treasure and be proud of, as  with\r\n\r\nthe past National Library?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Can NLB turn our new National Library into a\r\n\r\nfuture  icon,  and  perhaps make  it  one  of  the  great\r\n\r\nlibraries  of  the  world or, if not,  at  least  of  the\r\n\r\nregion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, Total Defence\r\n\r\nand NEWater exhibitions are great national events that we\r\n\r\nshould be very happy with.

These  are\r\n\r\nmostly elderly people.  The editorial of Lianhe Zaobao on\r\n\r\n5th  March commented, \"Though our civil servants are  the\r\n\r\nelite in the frontline, they lack the basic understanding\r\n\r\nof  our  own residents in the rear.  The result  is  that\r\n\r\nwhile  the  Government is busy building the \"Ideal  Home\"\r\n\r\nfor   the   next   generation,  many  older   folks   are\r\n\r\nincreasingly  feeling  as though they  are  strangers  in\r\n\r\ntheir own homeland.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask our civil servants whether they\r\n\r\nare  unaware of the existence of the non-English speaking\r\n\r\nmasses or do they just simply could not be bothered  with\r\n\r\nthem,  to the extent that they become so insensitive  and\r\n\r\nindifferent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large scale activities like the Total Defence and\r\n\r\nNEWater  exhibitions   are meant  to  reach  out  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.

As such, I urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to expressively stipulate that activities like\r\n\r\nthese  should provide explanatory notes in all  the  four\r\n\r\nofficial  languages  for  the  exhibits.

In 1979,  the  Speak  Mandarin\r\n\r\nCampaign was launched by the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan\r\n\r\nYew.   The  slogan  was  \"Speak more  Mandarin  and  less\r\n\r\ndialect\".   This was subsequently followed  by  concerted\r\n\r\nefforts  in  eradicating dialect songs,  talk  shows  and\r\n\r\nstory-telling programmes, as well as dialect  commercials\r\n\r\non TV and radio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Programme Advisory Committee, in recommending\r\n\r\nthe  return of dialect programmes on TV, had argued  that\r\n\r\nmost  young  people  are  now  effectively  bilingual  in\r\n\r\nMandarin   and  English.   Therefore,  allowing   dialect\r\n\r\nprogrammes  would  have no adverse impact  on  the  Speak\r\n\r\nMandarin policy.  Other reasons given are that  it  is  a\r\n\r\ngood  way to let young Singaporeans know something  about\r\n\r\ndialect,  as  dialect  is  still  part  of  our  cultural\r\n\r\nheritage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Literature has shown that many nations use language\r\n\r\nas  a  means to unify the country, eg, in China, the  US,\r\n\r\nEurope and India.  The different languages that were once\r\n\r\nspoken converge into one or two major ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This move by MITA is significant for Singapore. The\r\n\r\nunique geopolitical context of Singapore, with its unique\r\n\r\nmulti-racial setting and immigrant origins would  require\r\n\r\nyoung  Singapore to be fundamentally strong in  just  two\r\n\r\nlanguages  that  will  serve to  unify  its  multi-racial\r\n\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our political leadership made the major\r\n\r\ndecision  more  than  20  years  ago  to  implement   the\r\n\r\nbilingual policy, many good reasons were given.   I  have\r\n\r\nrequested  Speaker of the House to allow me to distribute\r\n\r\nsome   extracts   of  the  reasons  from  our   political\r\n\r\nleadership.   I am also distributing a table  that  shows\r\n\r\nthe  proficiency that Chinese Singaporeans have  made  in\r\n\r\nEnglish,  Mandarin  and  Chinese dialects  in  the  years\r\n\r\nbetween 1990 and 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it took the Chinese Singaporeans 10 years to\r\n\r\nachieve  a  15%  in  the  number of Chinese  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nembracing the language.  In the same period, the  use  of\r\n\r\nChinese dialects dropped from 50.3% to 30.7%, ie, a 19.6%\r\n\r\ndrop.  Yes, we are making progress in embracing Mandarin.\r\n\r\nBut,  contrary  to  what  the Media  Advisory  Panel  has\r\n\r\nalluded to, we are not proficient in the language yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I was told, students who have scored A1\r\n\r\nfor  Chinese in their GCE \"O\" levels have said  that  all\r\n\r\nthey had to do was to mug 3,000 Chinese characters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  then remember them by heart.  After that, they  will\r\n\r\njust  discard  the use of the words.  And these  are  our\r\n\r\ncreme de la creme.  In other words, the language has  not\r\n\r\nbeen internalised in most of the students and it does not\r\n\r\ncome as second nature to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issues I would like to raise are as\r\n\r\nfollows:   will  the  lifting of  the  ban  result  in  a\r\n\r\nslowdown  of the good progress we have been making?   How\r\n\r\ncan we ensure that our progress rate, including embracing\r\n\r\nour bilingual policy, will not be affected?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should be mindful of the fact that while we\r\n\r\nhave  succeeded  in  our  bilingual  policy,  there   are\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  are  not able  to  effectively  master\r\n\r\neither  English or Mandarin.  My next question  therefore\r\n\r\nis:  by allowing dialect to co-exist with Mandarin,  even\r\n\r\nif they are on ad-hoc basis and limited in scale, will we\r\n\r\nexpect some degree of deterioration in the proficiency of\r\n\r\nMandarin?  There is evidence that learning more than  one\r\n\r\nlanguage  can lead to the learners making errors  because\r\n\r\nof what linguists call \"language interference\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third issue, the bilingual policy is a\r\n\r\nfundamental   national  policy.   By   allowing   dialect\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to  be shown over national TV,  what  signals\r\n\r\nwill  we be sending to Singaporeans who have been brought\r\n\r\nup in a culture of bilingual policy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also concern that such a move by MITA may\r\n\r\nlead  to  other racial groups also requesting for similar\r\n\r\nviewing of dialect shows, in which case, where do we draw\r\n\r\nthe line?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the variety can be interesting and rich, will\r\n\r\nthe  viewing  of such dialect shows lead  to  norming  of\r\n\r\ndialect  groups, which can extend into the way  we  live,\r\n\r\nwhere  we  work, as had happened in the past?   We  would\r\n\r\nrecall  that  our bilingual policy has an impact  on  our\r\n\r\nhousing, occupation and lifestyle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Sir, let me first reply to the\r\n\r\ncuts on public libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with both Mr Loh Meng See and Mr Zainudin\r\n\r\nthat  public libraries have important roles to play.   As\r\n\r\nMr  Zainudin  put  it,  knowledge centres,  to  encourage\r\n\r\nreading and to promote continuous learning.  That is  why\r\n\r\nwe  were  so  concerned  when  visitorship  to  libraries\r\n\r\ndeclined and libraries were - this was some 11 years  ago\r\n\r\n-  at risk of becoming irrelevant.  The then Minister for\r\n\r\nInformation  and  the Arts, BG George  Yeo,  assembled  a\r\n\r\nLibrary  2000 Taskforce to try to reverse the  trend.   I\r\n\r\nhad the honour of being a member of that taskforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Cantonese say: ngow mng yam tsui, dim gam\r\n\r\nngow  tou  dai,  ie, if the cow does not want  to  drink,\r\n\r\nthere  is no way you can get it to bend its head  to  the\r\n\r\ntrough.   If  Singaporeans do not come to the  libraries,\r\n\r\nthen  either we bring the libraries to the people, or  we\r\n\r\nmake  the libraries compelling for them to want to visit.\r\n\r\nWe  decided to do both.  As a result, we have been  quite\r\n\r\nsuccessful in reversing the trend.  I thank both  Mr  Loh\r\n\r\nand Mr Zainudin for the compliments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our libraries have now become so buzzy that I\r\n\r\nremember  reading about some complaints against noise  in\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers  recently.  Because libraries  have  been\r\n\r\ntransformed,  we  now find visitors  who  had  previously\r\n\r\nnever stepped into any library.  We can be proud of  this\r\n\r\ntransformation  of our public libraries.  The  successful\r\n\r\ntransformation  of our libraries even  became  a  Harvard\r\n\r\ncase study.  Some of the visitors that we now receive are\r\n\r\nfellow  librarians from many other countries.  They  have\r\n\r\nread  about  our success, and they came here to  see  for\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can libraries do to promote adult reading?\r\n\r\nGetting  more  adults to visit the library regularly  and\r\n\r\nfrequently is one important step.  I think this  we  have\r\n\r\nlargely succeeded.  So, the next step is to have them  to\r\n\r\nread  more.  I think they do.  I do not think they  visit\r\n\r\nour  libraries merely to look at the decor  or  to  drink\r\n\r\ncafe  latte.  One evidence is the sharp increase in  book\r\n\r\nloans.   The  number of loans from the adult  collections\r\n\r\nhas  more  than doubled from six million in  1995  to  13\r\n\r\nmillion  this year.  But this is a continuous effort  and\r\n\r\nwe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  to be creative in the promotion efforts.  So,  last\r\n\r\nmonth  we  launched the Library Ambassador  programme  to\r\n\r\npromote  reading  and  learning.  We have  personalities,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  our  national  bowler, Remy  Ong,  and  Channel\r\n\r\nNewsAsia  presenter Suzanne Ho as our Ambassadors.   They\r\n\r\nfan  across  our 24 libraries to take part in activities,\r\n\r\nsuch  as story-telling, meet-the-star sessions, Celebrate\r\n\r\nyour  Festival Series.  As Mr Loh pointed out, just  this\r\n\r\nweek,  we  launched another programme, the Library@Office\r\n\r\ncampaign  to  promote  to office workers,  professionals,\r\n\r\nexecutives  and  businessmen  on  our  varied   services,\r\n\r\nresources and extensive distribution channels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh asked if all libraries should be general\r\n\r\nlibraries or is it not better for some to specialise.  He\r\n\r\ncalled it niche libraries.  We agree with Mr Loh that not\r\n\r\nall  libraries should be the same.  Indeed, they are not.\r\n\r\nWherever possible, we try to tailor the character of each\r\n\r\nlibrary  to  reflect  the targeted  niche  audience.   In\r\n\r\nselected  libraries, we set up special collections.   For\r\n\r\nexample, the Bedok Community Library has a Malay  library\r\n\r\nservice, and the Tampines Regional Library has a  Chinese\r\n\r\nlibrary  service.  I have just visited the newly upgraded\r\n\r\nAng   Mo   Kio   Community  Library  which   is   in   my\r\n\r\nneighbourhood; a wonderful transformation.  I  notice  it\r\n\r\nhas an Indian library service there.  And, of course, the\r\n\r\nlibrary@esplanade is a great example of a niche  library.\r\n\r\nIt  focuses  on  the four performing arts: dance,  music,\r\n\r\ntheatre and film.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are responding to these niche libraries\r\n\r\nand  niche  services  with great  enthusiasm.   They  are\r\n\r\nsaying  that we are on the right track, and we will  push\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin hopes that we can make our new National\r\n\r\nLibrary  an international icon of learning and knowledge.\r\n\r\nWe  will  try, but within the sensible limits of  budget.\r\n\r\nWe  do  not have the huge budget of the British  Library,\r\n\r\nbut we will stretch what we have been given, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncreate something different and of value to Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is like our newly opened Asian Civilisation\r\n\r\nMuseum  at  Empress Place.  Our collections  are  modest,\r\n\r\ncompared to what you can find in the museums in Delhi  or\r\n\r\nBeijing.   Ours is relatively small, in terms of quantity\r\n\r\nand  perhaps  even  quality.  However,  through  creative\r\n\r\ncuratorship,  I  think we have created a  product,  quite\r\n\r\nworld-class, and which we can all be proud of.   This  is\r\n\r\nthe  same  approach we will be taking on the new National\r\n\r\nLibrary. So, stay tuned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on Dr Ong Seh Hong's cut on the\r\n\r\ngreater  use of official languages in public exhibitions.\r\n\r\nLet  me  state MITA's own guideline for our  own  museums\r\n\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our museums provide all panel texts in English. But\r\n\r\nwe  do  supplement  with other languages,  in  two  ways.\r\n\r\nFirst,  we  often provide panel texts in other languages,\r\n\r\ndepending  on  the  content, theme and  target  audience.\r\n\r\nSecond,  we  have handouts and brochures in the  relevant\r\n\r\nofficial   languages  for  all  our  exhibitions.   These\r\n\r\nhandouts  and brochures provide the synopses and  explain\r\n\r\nthe main themes of the exhibitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the current \"Exhibition on 20th Century\r\n\r\nChinese  Paintings\" in the Singapore Art Museum  contains\r\n\r\npanel  texts  in both English and Chinese.  For  the  new\r\n\r\nAsian  Civilisation Museum at Empress Place, panel  texts\r\n\r\nare  in English.  But we have gallery guides in brochures\r\n\r\nin Chinese, Malay and Tamil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guideline also applies to our travelling\r\n\r\nexhibitions.  The only exceptions are school  exhibitions\r\n\r\nand  temporary exhibitions of very short duration,  where\r\n\r\nonly  the  translation of the synopses  in  the  official\r\n\r\nlanguages will be provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, I agree with Dr Ong that we should be\r\n\r\nsensitive  to  the non-English speaking Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\ncater  to their needs as far as possible.  At the end  of\r\n\r\nthe  day, the purpose of a public exhibition is to  reach\r\n\r\nout.  It would be quite silly not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  use  the other languages, unless we are quite certain\r\n\r\nthat  the  targeted audience is already comfortable  with\r\n\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me spend some time on this very\r\n\r\nimportant topic of dialect.  I think Mdm Ho Geok Choo was\r\n\r\na   bit   mistaken.  She  read  in  the  newspapers   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of  the  Programme  Advisory   Committee\r\n\r\n(PAC).   MITA's  policy  is  quite  different.   We  have\r\n\r\nalready  announced it and replied to the  newspaper.   We\r\n\r\nstand  firm on the current policy.  I am glad  that  this\r\n\r\nparticular MITA's policy, which we are standing firm, has\r\n\r\nthe  support of Mdm Ho. She understood the importance  of\r\n\r\nMandarin  as  a  unifying language to  bond  the  Chinese\r\n\r\ncommunity.  As  she  has  pointed  out,  we  should   not\r\n\r\ninadvertently  reverse  the  progress  we  have  made  in\r\n\r\ngetting  our people to use Mandarin, through  a  careless\r\n\r\nliberalisation of our dialect policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not ban dialects. Where practical, we allow\r\n\r\nsome  dialect  programming to service the needs  of  some\r\n\r\nolder  Singaporeans and the arts community.  But when  we\r\n\r\nmake  such concessions, we do it carefully to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  concessions  do  not undermine  our  Speak  Mandarin\r\n\r\nCampaign.   That  is   why  some dialect  programmes  are\r\n\r\navailable on radio, on the arts channel and on cable  TV.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, Arts Central occasionally carries  dialect\r\n\r\noperas   and  art-house  movies  in  dialect.   FM   95.8\r\n\r\nbroadcasts dialect news daily, and dialect programmes are\r\n\r\navailable on cable TV's TVBJ channel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, however, kept Channel 8 and Channel U free\r\n\r\nfrom  dialect  as  these channels are watched  by  school\r\n\r\nchildren.   We  should not confuse them by,  on  the  one\r\n\r\nhand,   promoting  Mandarin,  and  on  the  other   hand,\r\n\r\nbroadcasting dialect programmes on these channels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share my personal experience. I grew up in a\r\n\r\nHokkien-speaking  family.  My parents  could  only  speak\r\n\r\nHokkien,  although they could read and write in  Chinese.\r\n\r\nI  then  entered  a  Chinese kampong primary  school  and\r\n\r\ngradually picked\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup  Mandarin,  English and Bahasa.  But  even  then,  the\r\n\r\nschool  environment  was  largely  Hokkien-speaking.    I\r\n\r\nrecall  that  we  did not take languages  too  seriously,\r\n\r\nexcept to pass school examinations.  At that time, we did\r\n\r\nnot have compulsory PSLE examinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I joined high school and because it took in\r\n\r\nstudents  from all over, with varying language abilities,\r\n\r\nwe  were  all put through an extra year, called  \"Remove\"\r\n\r\nclass, before we began formal secondary school education.\r\n\r\n\"Remove\"  class was really an extra year for the students\r\n\r\nto brush up on their English as all other subjects, other\r\n\r\nthan languages, were taught in English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I entered university in Australia and had to\r\n\r\npick  up  more languages: computer languages  -  Fortran,\r\n\r\nBasic  and Cobol.  I do not belong to that small minority\r\n\r\nof  people  like Mr Seng Han Thong, or our colleagues  in\r\n\r\nthe   interpretation  booths,  who  can  handle   several\r\n\r\nlanguages competently with ease.  I am just your ordinary\r\n\r\nfellow, with an average brain capacity. So in my last  50\r\n\r\nyears,  I  found  myself with competencies  in  different\r\n\r\nlanguages at different periods of my life.  During my six\r\n\r\nyears  in  primary school, I was fluent  in  Hokkien  and\r\n\r\nMandarin.   During secondary school, I was  strongest  in\r\n\r\nEnglish and Bahasa. I neglected my Mandarin somewhat.  In\r\n\r\nuniversity, I was most fluent in English and  Fortran,  a\r\n\r\ncomputer  language.  After graduation, I began  to  again\r\n\r\nspend  time  on Mandarin, but even then, it  never  quite\r\n\r\nreached  the same competency as my English.   My  Hokkien\r\n\r\nand  Bahasa are now probably at primary three level.   My\r\n\r\ncomputer languages have become totally obsolete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we face a constant struggle with limited time\r\n\r\nand  limited brain capacity.  We only have 24 hours  each\r\n\r\nday.   If we spend more time on X, we have less time  for\r\n\r\nY.   It is as simple as that.  We all want to be good  at\r\n\r\nX, Y and Z, but it is often just humanly not possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we have achieved some success in our Speak\r\n\r\nMandarin Campaign is an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noutcome that is not irreversible.  It was an uphill task,\r\n\r\nbut we have managed to push that rock up the slope.  Some\r\n\r\nof  us  can  now take the hands off the rock and  perhaps\r\n\r\nlisten to shan ge in dialect.  But if everyone does that,\r\n\r\nthe rock will immediately roll down the slope.  My advice\r\n\r\nto Chinese Singaporeans is san si -  think thrice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this House has heard the debate of Mandarin\r\n\r\nversus dialect many times.  The arguments are well  known\r\n\r\nto  all,  including the members of the Programme Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee   (PAC).   These  are  rational   establishment\r\n\r\npeople.   So why did they suddenly argue for a relaxation\r\n\r\nof our dialect policy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was curious, so I sniffed around and I think I\r\n\r\nfound  out  why.  It is Jack Neo's \"I Not  Stupid\".   You\r\n\r\nsee,  \"I Not Stupid\" has been such a roaring success that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans want more of it.  I myself have  watched  it\r\n\r\ntwo and a half times.  Once, in the cinema; once, on VCD.\r\n\r\nThe third time was when it was screened on Channel 8.   I\r\n\r\nonly  saw part of it, because when \"lim-peh\" became  \"ni-lau-pa\",  something was missing.  \"I Not  Stupid\"  became\r\n\r\nkind of stupid, and I switched it off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be many like me in the Programme Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee who felt the same way.  I am speculating, but I\r\n\r\nthink this led to their call for some dialect programming\r\n\r\non free-to-air TV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to resolve the contradiction in this\r\n\r\ninstance is to screen \"I Not Stupid\" in its original form\r\n\r\non Arts Central, but not on Channel 8 or Channel U.  This\r\n\r\nway, we uphold our Speak Mandarin Campaign and still  get\r\n\r\nto  enjoy Jack Neo's masterpiece free-to-air.  MITA  will\r\n\r\nconsider  this  and other programmes from time  to  time.\r\n\r\nBut  we must always bear in mind that in exercising  such\r\n\r\nflexibility,  we  do not dilute or harm  our  efforts  to\r\n\r\npromote Mandarin to our young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to remind Members that\r\n\r\nwe are behind time on this amendment.

The fact\r\n\r\nthat this cut comes under MITA suggests the focus of  the\r\n\r\nSIF  is  to project a specific image of Singapore to  the\r\n\r\ninternational community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that SIF has several programmes, including\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Volunteers Overseas Programme  and  Youth\r\n\r\nExpedition  Programme and so on.  Most of the  programmes\r\n\r\ninvolved   Singaporeans  going  overseas  and  performing\r\n\r\ncommunity  activities at work, certainly  benefiting  the\r\n\r\npeople and the communities that they are serving.  Sir, I\r\n\r\nam  sure  SIF will be able to give us a list of the  many\r\n\r\nschools  we have built, the many children we have  helped\r\n\r\nimmunised, and certainly the many lives we have touched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while these are all well and good, I wonder how\r\n\r\nmuch  has  been  spent so far in sending Singaporeans  on\r\n\r\nthese overseas community projects.  The SIF annual report\r\n\r\nshowed  that  for  last year alone, we  spent  some  $4.6\r\n\r\nmillion on overseas programmes, plus another $2.9 million\r\n\r\non  staff  cost.  My concern relates to the old  adage  - that  charity  begins at home.  In this current  economic\r\n\r\nclimate, we have heard so much about how Singaporeans are\r\n\r\naffected by the economic downturn.  It may not make sense\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans that we are spending so  much  to  help\r\n\r\nother people, when our own people may need equal, if not,\r\n\r\nmore help.  I would like to ask the Minister:  how can we\r\n\r\njustify to Singaporeans that the amount of money that  we\r\n\r\nare  spending  in  making the lives of  people  of  other\r\n\r\ncountries better, when Singaporeans' lives may  be  worse\r\n\r\noff?   Specific  examples are those  without  electricity\r\n\r\nsupply and water supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the desired outcomes of the SIF programmes?\r\n\r\nHow do SIF programmes benefit Singapore and Singaporeans?\r\n\r\nIn  this regard, I would like to ask the Minister:   what\r\n\r\nare some of the requirements that SIF has of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  have  served  overseas  and  contributing  back   to\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my interaction with young people, especially\r\n\r\nwith  those  in tertiary institutions, my sense  is  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  a  very  global  perspective  and  many  have\r\n\r\naspirations  to  do  community work overseas,  with  very\r\n\r\nlittle  mention  of  doing community work  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nCertainly,  the  SIF  provides an  excellent  avenue  and\r\n\r\nopportunities for them.  But I am concerned  how  we  can\r\n\r\nencourage and ensure that these young people continue  to\r\n\r\nfeel  for their fellow Singaporeans so much as they  feel\r\n\r\nfor  the  people in other countries.  I hope the Minister\r\n\r\ncan also provide insights into the processes that SIF has\r\n\r\nput  in place to achieve this end. Also, with these young\r\n\r\nminds,  how can we ensure that we will continue  to  root\r\n\r\nthem to Singapore?  Being exposed to different levels and\r\n\r\nmanifestation  of  poverty and  different  political  and\r\n\r\nsocial  systems, how can we allow them to  process  these\r\n\r\ndifferences and appreciate Singapore better?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ensure that Singaporeans understand why we\r\n\r\nneed to help others because I am sure, in the process, we\r\n\r\nare   helping   ourselves  to  be  a  more   mature   and\r\n\r\ncompassionate society.  Even if charity does not begin at\r\n\r\nhome, just make sure that it returns home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Some advertisements are misleading. In order\r\n\r\nto  achieve the effects of advertising, some  go  to  the\r\n\r\nextent    of    posting   exaggerative   and   misleading\r\n\r\ninformation.  People who are not careful and  believe  in\r\n\r\nthe  misleading advertisement may lead to disappointment,\r\n\r\nfinancial  losses and, sometimes, lose their lives.   Now\r\n\r\nlet me cite some examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hair growth advertisement: A friend of mine told me\r\n\r\nthat  the model she used for a hair-growing advertisement\r\n\r\nhad well-groomed dark hair. A photograph was taken of him\r\n\r\nwith  dark, thick hair on his head. They then shaved  off\r\n\r\nthe major\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npart of his beautiful hair, and had a photograph taken of\r\n\r\nthe  \"Mediterranean Sea\" on his head. The two photographs\r\n\r\nwere  then  shown  on  the advertisement  to  depict  the\r\n\r\n\"before\"  and  \"after\"  the  treatment  which  they  were\r\n\r\npromoting. But the sequence was reversed to suggest  that\r\n\r\nthe  bald  head had turned into a head of thick and  dark\r\n\r\nhair.  This  advertisement is misleading  and,  in  fact,\r\n\r\ndeceiving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water filter advertisement: There is also an\r\n\r\nadvertisement  on a water filtering machine.   It  claims\r\n\r\nthat  water  that  passes through the  filtering  machine\r\n\r\ncomes  out many times cleaner than the tap water supplied\r\n\r\nby  PUB.   In  other  words, it misleads  the  public  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  PUB water is dirty and not fit  for  human\r\n\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is yet another one which appeared in Wanbao,\r\n\r\nwhich is even more absurd. It claims that by wearing  the\r\n\r\nslimming shorts, blood circulation can be improved by  as\r\n\r\nmuch as 30%.  I think this is grossly exaggerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are really too many advertisements which\r\n\r\ncontain varying degrees of untruth in them. I would  like\r\n\r\nto  ask the Minister whether something should be done  to\r\n\r\nstop such misleading advertisements from appearing in the\r\n\r\nmedia.  The  merchants  who put  up  such  advertisements\r\n\r\nshould be taken to task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> I am\r\n\r\nhere  to  ask  the Ministry for clarity on  its  role  in\r\n\r\ngoverning  such advertisements as Assoc.  Prof.  Low  has\r\n\r\nbrought  up, and in this case I am talking about slimming\r\n\r\nadvertisements.  Each day, there are at  least  two  huge\r\n\r\nadvertisements in the print media and many  smaller  ones\r\n\r\nin  the  other  media.  These advertisements  prey  on  a\r\n\r\nwoman's  insecurities over her body  and  also  reinforce\r\n\r\nnotions  that she is just there to be attractive  to  her\r\n\r\nhusband.   Let me recite some examples that  appeared  in\r\n\r\ntoday's paper:  \"Let your wellness radiates from within\",\r\n\r\n\"Become  now  a  beautiful mother\", \"To be attractive  to\r\n\r\nyour husband\", \"She has gained back her\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeautiful body even after having two children\".  And then\r\n\r\nthe  lady  goes  on  to say how she is  grateful  to  her\r\n\r\nhusband  for  encouraging her to  go  for  this  slimming\r\n\r\ncourse, whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not here to dispute the claims made by these\r\n\r\nadvertisements or the efficiency of the agencies that are\r\n\r\nrunning  these  courses to bring women back  into  shape.\r\n\r\nWhat  I  am here is to ask the Ministry - as I have  just\r\n\r\nheard  from Mr Yatiman that there are two representatives\r\n\r\nas  constituent  members  of  the  Advertising  Standards\r\n\r\nAuthority  of Singapore (ASAS) alongside with many  other\r\n\r\nreputable representatives - how is the Singapore Code  of\r\n\r\nAdvertising  practice being administered and governed  by\r\n\r\nthese  representatives on ASAS.  On top of that, I  would\r\n\r\nalso  like to draw attention to this book which  has  got\r\n\r\nwonderful  clauses  in Appendix H relating  primarily  to\r\n\r\nslimming    advertisements.    When   I    compare    the\r\n\r\nadvertisements  to 2.1.5, I do not really  see  a  direct\r\n\r\ncorrelation.  Is it time then to review these guidelines?\r\n\r\nAlso, there is a chapter in this Code, primarily catering\r\n\r\nto how children are being used.  I wonder why is there no\r\n\r\nsuch  provision where women are concerned, because  women\r\n\r\nare  used  all  the  time in so many  advertisements  for\r\n\r\ndifferent purposes.  Lastly, it took a while to find this\r\n\r\nCode  and  I  thank  the  parliamentary  librarians   for\r\n\r\ntracking  it  down.  It is not on the web, and  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof):</b> First of all, I would like to thank Dr\r\n\r\nMaliki  for  his comments on the Singapore  International\r\n\r\nFoundation (SIF).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIF is an NGO (non-governmental organisation), but\r\n\r\nit  is funded in part by the Government as its mission is\r\n\r\nin  line  with the Government's aims and goals.   For  FY\r\n\r\n2002, the SIF received $9 million of funding support from\r\n\r\nthe  Government through MITA, MFA and the National  Youth\r\n\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SIF was set up in 1991 with two core missions.\r\n\r\nFirst,   to  connect  Singaporeans  living  overseas   to\r\n\r\nSingapore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthus  strengthening  their sense  of  being  Singaporean.\r\n\r\nSecond,  to  help  shape a positive image  for  Singapore\r\n\r\ninternationally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SIF programmes are geared towards these two\r\n\r\nmissions.   Externally, they seek  to  generate  goodwill\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore  and other nations and  peoples,  thus\r\n\r\nsupporting  our  efforts  to grow  an  external  economy.\r\n\r\nDomestically,  SIF  programmes  help  to  develop   civic\r\n\r\nsociety  through  fostering  a  spirit  of  volunteerism,\r\n\r\ncompassion and active citizenry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the SIF has carried out a wide range\r\n\r\nof   programmes.   One  key  programme  is  its  Overseas\r\n\r\nSingaporeans programme.  SIF runs support activities  for\r\n\r\na global network of 91 clubs and 109 student associations\r\n\r\nto  strengthen the Singapore identity and connectivity to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another is the Friends of Singapore programme. SIF\r\n\r\nhas  received more than 1,000 visitors from 17  countries\r\n\r\nin  the  past  decade, as part of its  efforts  to  forge\r\n\r\nstrong networks of goodwill and friendship for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under its Singapore Volunteers Overseas programme,\r\n\r\nmore  than 500 Singaporeans have become volunteers in  14\r\n\r\ncountries.  They work on many meaningful projects.   Some\r\n\r\nhelp  to bring basic healthcare to the poor in the  rural\r\n\r\nareas.   Some help to bring IT and Internet to  those  on\r\n\r\nthe  wrong  side  of the digital divide.   We  have  some\r\n\r\nreports  in  the  newspapers showing the success  of  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes carried out by the SIF, including going to the\r\n\r\nremote  areas to help those having toothaches.  So  these\r\n\r\nare clear examples of how our volunteers are really going\r\n\r\ninto remote areas, linking Singapore to people living  in\r\n\r\nthose places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, through its Youth Expedition Project, SIF has\r\n\r\nalso  trained over 2,000 young Singaporeans in leadership\r\n\r\nand life skills through overseas community services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Review Committee envisages Singapore\r\n\r\nbecoming a globalised,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiversified and entrepreneurial economy.  With its  reach\r\n\r\nto  Singaporeans overseas, SIF is well positioned to play\r\n\r\nan important role to draw Singaporeans everywhere to be a\r\n\r\npart  of  this expanded space that we operate in  and  to\r\n\r\nmake  their  contributions.  Through the SIF,  and  other\r\n\r\noutreach  programmes  like  Contact  Singapore  and   the\r\n\r\nMajulah Connection, we can help our overseas Singaporeans\r\n\r\nfeel   connected  to  Singapore,  and  be  part  of   the\r\n\r\nSingaporean  community  worldwide.   In  turn,   overseas\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   can   help  us  to   enhance   our   image\r\n\r\ninternationally  of a globally oriented Singapore.   Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  win-win  approach  for  both  Singapore  and\r\n\r\noverseas  Singaporeans, and this  is  why  SIF  is  worth\r\n\r\nsupporting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me go to the question of misleading\r\n\r\nadvertisements  raised  by  two  speakers.    Ms   Braema\r\n\r\nMathiaparanam and Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay talked about\r\n\r\npeople  who  are  losing their hair  and  those  who  are\r\n\r\noverweight  falling victims to misleading advertisements.\r\n\r\nI  share their concerns because at my age when people are\r\n\r\nalso talking about losing their hair and gaining unwanted\r\n\r\nextras  all over their bodies, I too and you too, Members\r\n\r\nfrom this Chamber, could be victims.  The question is: is\r\n\r\nthe   existing   regulatory  framework   for   misleading\r\n\r\nadvertisements sufficient, in light of the  proliferation\r\n\r\nof  weight-loss and other related advertisements  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers and TV broadcasts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two bodies that could address their\r\n\r\nconcerns.  First, the Advertising Standards Authority  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  (ASAS)  and,  second,  the  Media  Development\r\n\r\nAuthority (MDA).  ASAS polices advertising standards  for\r\n\r\nadvertisements.   ASAS  is a local  advertising  industry\r\n\r\nself-regulating  body  comprising  representatives   from\r\n\r\nvarious   entities  including  advertisers,   advertising\r\n\r\nagencies, Government agencies and media owners.   She  is\r\n\r\nright when she said that MDA is represented in ASAS.   It\r\n\r\nis  an advisory council to the Consumers' Association  of\r\n\r\nSingapore (CASE).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ASAS has a Code of Practice called the\r\n\r\nSingapore Code of Advertising Practice (SCAP), which sets\r\n\r\nstandards on accuracy, authenticity and good taste.  This\r\n\r\nCode  was  recently updated and re-issued in early  2003,\r\n\r\nand  includes guidelines pertaining to slimming  products\r\n\r\nand services, scalp products and environmental claims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever there are cases of misleading\r\n\r\nadvertisements or complaints, ASAS would review and  take\r\n\r\naction  against the dubious advertisements that  seek  to\r\n\r\nexploit   the  consumers.  These  actions  could  include\r\n\r\ndirecting the advertiser or advertising agent to amend or\r\n\r\ntotally  withdraw the advertisements, or  requesting  the\r\n\r\nmedia to impose sanctions on the errant party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since local media owners and advertising agents\r\n\r\nsupport  the ASAS Code, advertisers who do not  amend  or\r\n\r\nwithdraw   their  misleading  advertisements   may   find\r\n\r\nthemselves denied access to space in both the  print  and\r\n\r\nbroadcast media.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, if there is any breach of our\r\n\r\ncensorship  guidelines,  eg,  Code  for  TV   and   Radio\r\n\r\nAdvertising  issued  by MDA, Media Development  Authority\r\n\r\ncan  also step in to investigate and take action  against\r\n\r\nthe advertisements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, although regulators can take care of\r\n\r\nmisleading  or  objectionable  advertisements,  consumers\r\n\r\nshould  also  play a role by using judgement  and  common\r\n\r\nsense when interpreting advertisements.  New products and\r\n\r\nservices are being offered all the time.  Some are driven\r\n\r\nby real advances in technology, others may be repackaging\r\n\r\nof   existing  products  and  services.   Hence,  it   is\r\n\r\nimportant  that  the  public should always  be  alert  to\r\n\r\noffers that are too good to be true, or miracle solutions\r\n\r\nthat solve problems with little effort or cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the book that Ms Braema raised,\r\n\r\nwe  will look into whether the question of children  used\r\n\r\nin advertisements could be extended to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwomen too.

The  Media Competition Code is to ensure  limited\r\n\r\ncompetition within Singapore's mass media market.  I have\r\n\r\nfour  questions  to ask the Minister.  One,  whether  the\r\n\r\nanti-competitive  practice will be  effective  enough  to\r\n\r\nensure  fair  competition or prevent vicious  competition\r\n\r\nleading  to  a media war.  Second, what are  the  guiding\r\n\r\nprinciples in setting the Government's standards?  Third,\r\n\r\nhow  will  the authorities monitor the Code and how  will\r\n\r\nbreaches  be  dealt with?  Lastly, how will the  public's\r\n\r\ninterest be safeguarded by the Code?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Sir, competition in the media\r\n\r\nindustry  in  Singapore  has to be  limited  because  our\r\n\r\nmarket  is  such a small one.  I remember  talking  about\r\n\r\nthis  last week when replying to Mr Steve Chia's question\r\n\r\non  a  second  pay  TV.  But, whether it  is  limited  or\r\n\r\notherwise, anti-competitive practices cannot be condoned.\r\n\r\nThe  Media Market Conduct Code sets out the ground  rules\r\n\r\nfor  fair competition and fair market conduct.   Some  of\r\n\r\nthe  anti-competitive practices that we  frown  upon  are\r\n\r\nspelt  out  in the Code, eg, the Code prohibits predatory\r\n\r\npricing.   If  a  dominant  player,  with  deep  pockets,\r\n\r\ndeliberately prices itself, for example,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvertisement  rates below its marginal  cost,  with  the\r\n\r\nview  to  make life difficult for a new player  or  small\r\n\r\nplayer, this is predatory pricing.  Regulators will frown\r\n\r\non such practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Code imposes special obligations on dominant\r\n\r\nplayers.   The  purpose is to prevent them  from  abusing\r\n\r\ntheir dominant position to stifle the development of  new\r\n\r\nplayers.   For  example, mandatory bundling services  are\r\n\r\nalso frowned upon.  If a dominant player, let us say, who\r\n\r\nowns  several  newspapers, insists that  all  advertisers\r\n\r\nmust  advertise in all its newspapers, he will  find  the\r\n\r\nregulator   knocking   at  his  door.    The   Code   has\r\n\r\ncomprehensive enforcement procedures to check  on  errant\r\n\r\nplayers.   The regulator can either initiate  enforcement\r\n\r\nactions  or  act  upon complaints.  There are  prescribed\r\n\r\nprocedures  in  the Code to investigate  anti-competitive\r\n\r\nconduct.   Enforcement measures will  range  from  simple\r\n\r\nwarnings,  knocking at the knuckles to  severe  financial\r\n\r\npenalties of up to $1 million per contravention.  In this\r\n\r\nway  the  Code  serves  the  wider  public  interest   by\r\n\r\nfacilitating fair and effective competition in  the  mass\r\n\r\nmedia market.  By spelling out the ground rules for  fair\r\n\r\nplay,  new entrants to the market will have a fair chance\r\n\r\nto  establish  themselves.  This will,  in  turn,  foster\r\n\r\nfurther investments in and development of the mass  media\r\n\r\nmarket.  Their success, in turn, will add to the range of\r\n\r\nquality  media services available to Singaporeans,  thus,\r\n\r\ngiving them more choices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (3), Mr Seng.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q of the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates be reduced by $10  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nCode QI 5200.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this topic is on heritage centres and museums.\r\n\r\nI  must commend the National Heritage Board's decision to\r\n\r\nopen  our museums every day, a marketing drive to attract\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  visit the museums  free  during  public\r\n\r\nholidays.  This is one of the effective ways to cultivate\r\n\r\nthe   museum-going  culture.   The  NHB's  heritage   bus\r\n\r\nlaunched  earlier this year is another move  targeted  at\r\n\r\nthe  community.  May I ask what is the NHB's overall plan\r\n\r\nin  developing museums and heritage centres and fostering\r\n\r\nthe museum-going culture?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, first and foremost, I would\r\n\r\nlike   to  extend  my  congratulations  to  the  National\r\n\r\nHeritage  Board for a job well done and also  the  recent\r\n\r\nopening  of the Asian Civilisations Museum.  We  are  now\r\n\r\none  step  closer to realising the goals set out  in  the\r\n\r\nRenaissance  City  Report.  Over the years,  millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars  have  been dedicated to retain our heritage  and\r\n\r\nthus  giving us a sense of identity and historical roots.\r\n\r\nWe   can   now  say  that  we  have  world-class  museums\r\n\r\nshowcasing  Singapore's history and  rich  heritage.   In\r\n\r\norder to promote the arts and get our population to  have\r\n\r\na  greater appreciation of our roots, would the  Minister\r\n\r\nconsider,  first,  engaging  our  schools  to  adopt  the\r\n\r\nheritage  centres and museums and, in the process,  train\r\n\r\nour  students to be guides or ambassadors of the museums?\r\n\r\nThe  students  can  be engaged on special  school  tours,\r\n\r\nschool   holidays  or  during  foreign  student  exchange\r\n\r\nvisits.   The advantage of such a scheme is that it  will\r\n\r\nbroaden  the  scope of understanding of  their  subjects,\r\n\r\nwhich are social studies and history of Singapore.   This\r\n\r\nis  one  way  we  can groom our young to  have  a  deeper\r\n\r\nappreciation  of  both  the  arts  and  the  history   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Perhaps the Minister could explore this  idea\r\n\r\nwith the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we, currently, have a total of 18 museums and\r\n\r\ngalleries.  In the Renaissance City Report, MITA has also\r\n\r\nstated  that  it  would work with the  Singapore  Tourism\r\n\r\nBoard  to promote arts and cultural tourism \"capitalising\r\n\r\non opportunities in conferences, conventions and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexhibitions.\"  Sir, may I suggest that an all-in-one  day\r\n\r\npass  or  season pass be offered to cater to the  diverse\r\n\r\ninterest of tourists, which I am sure our 18 museums  can\r\n\r\naccommodate.    This type of day pass is not  unusual  in\r\n\r\ncities  like  Paris or London where visitors  can  choose\r\n\r\nfrom a range of museums and art galleries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Miss Low, we have two other amendments\r\n\r\nto deal with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Another spin-off from the all-in-one\r\n\r\ntype of pass is that of riding on bigger attractions, and\r\n\r\nit would help build attendance for smaller museums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Seng Han Thong\r\n\r\nand  Miss  Penny  Low for their encouraging  remarks  and\r\n\r\nsuggestions for our museums.  The National Heritage Board\r\n\r\n(NHB)  is  currently  working on a  number  of  marketing\r\n\r\nstrategies  to promote a museum-going culture by  forging\r\n\r\nstronger partnerships with the public, private and people\r\n\r\nsectors.  Let me elaborate quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our museums are positioned as lifestyle centres. Mr\r\n\r\nSeng and Miss Penny Low may be happy to know that many of\r\n\r\nthe  suggestions raised have been incorporated  into  the\r\n\r\nNHB's  operations.  Lifestyle elements, such as food  and\r\n\r\ndrinks,  retail shops, arts and cultural activities,  are\r\n\r\nintegrated  to  enhance the visitor's  total  experience.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  art appreciation workshops and  Lindy  Hop\r\n\r\ndance  classes are regular features in our  museums.  Our\r\n\r\narts and heritage facilities, such as the Singapore Tyler\r\n\r\nPrint   Institute   and  Reflections@Bukit   Chandu   are\r\n\r\navailable for corporate functions as well as arts-related\r\n\r\nevents,  such  as poetry-reading, public talks,  location\r\n\r\nfilming  and  staging of plays.  Like the  newly-launched\r\n\r\nAsian   Civilisations  Museum  at  Empress   Place,   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  History Museum will have a variety  of  retail\r\n\r\nspaces  and  function rooms for public bookings  when  it\r\n\r\nreopens in 2006.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng and Miss Low suggested that we issue pass\r\n\r\ncards  to  encourage museum visitorship.  I  am  glad  to\r\n\r\ninform them that the NHB offers an annual pass\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  unlimited  entry  to  all three  national  museums,\r\n\r\nnamely, the Singapore History Museum, Asian Civilisations\r\n\r\nMuseum  and  Singapore  Art  Museum,  and  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nPhilatelic Museum.  NHB also works closely with partners,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  STB  and its network  of  tour  operators,\r\n\r\nhotels,  community  organisations  and  NTUC,  for  joint\r\n\r\npromotions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NHB is currently working with STB on a day pass with\r\n\r\nattractive  benefits for tourists, as requested  by  Miss\r\n\r\nLow.  Day passes catering to different niche groups, such\r\n\r\nas  families,  youths  and the  elderly  are  also  being\r\n\r\nconsidered.  NHB will study the feasibility of  extending\r\n\r\nsome of these passes to other smaller museums in the near\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Low also suggested that we should collaborate\r\n\r\nclosely  with  schools.  I am glad to say  that  this  is\r\n\r\nalready  being  done.   For  many  years,  NHB  has  been\r\n\r\nactively  reaching  out  to  students  and  getting  them\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  our museums.  About 70% of the  schools  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  members  of the NHB's  School  Membership\r\n\r\nScheme.   On average, member schools visit our museum  at\r\n\r\nleast  twice  a year as part of their school  curriculum.\r\n\r\nTogether  with the Ministry of Education,  NHB  has  been\r\n\r\ninvolving  students as museum guides and facilitators  in\r\n\r\nits   volunteer  programmes,  as  well  as   in   museums\r\n\r\ndocumentation  and  research  work.   Chong  Fu   Primary\r\n\r\nSchool,  for  example, has adopted the Singapore  History\r\n\r\nMuseum.   The  School has been working closely  with  the\r\n\r\nmuseum  to provide museum guide services and performances\r\n\r\nfor  special occasions.  We welcome more schools to  take\r\n\r\npart in these programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Low also suggested that our museums encourage\r\n\r\nlong-term  loans  or donations from private  collections,\r\n\r\nand we are looking into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Seng, would you like to withdraw\r\n\r\nyour amendment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (4), Mr Tan Soo Khoon.\r\n\r\nYou have three minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code QM 3100.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am disappointed with IDA's decision to\r\n\r\ncontinue the practice of receivers of mobile phone  calls\r\n\r\npaying  for  half the cost of mobile calls.   This  means\r\n\r\nthere  is no free incoming calls.  I raised this  subject\r\n\r\nsometime  last  year, and I was quite  hopeful  that  the\r\n\r\npresent system, whereby the receiver of a call, in  fact,\r\n\r\nsubsidises  by  half  the cost to the  caller,  would  be\r\n\r\nscrapped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the latest decision fails to recognise\r\n\r\nfundamental flaws in the current system.  Why should  the\r\n\r\nconsumer  pay  for something he did not  initiate?   This\r\n\r\nmeans   consumers  have  no  control  over  their   final\r\n\r\nbillings.   Why should the consumer pay for something  he\r\n\r\nhas  no  control, such as paying for wrong calls made  to\r\n\r\nhis   number  or  unsolicited  calls  from  people   like\r\n\r\ntelemarketers?   Does this not mean that those  who  make\r\n\r\ncalls do not realise the full cost of making a call?   In\r\n\r\nasserting  that  changing the format may not  mean  lower\r\n\r\ncost  to  consumers,  IDA has not provided  us  with  any\r\n\r\nevidence to back up its claim.  On the contrary,  I  have\r\n\r\nread  a  lot of studies that have shown that the calling-party-pay system encourages more use of the handphone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tan, there is one minute left for\r\n\r\nthis cut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> On the contrary, the smallest\r\n\r\ntelco,  Starhub, is providing free incoming  local  calls\r\n\r\ntill  March  next  year, and there is  a  possibility  of\r\n\r\nextending  it  further.  One may  say,  \"Why  not  switch\r\n\r\ntelco?\"  But there again, we run into other problems.  If\r\n\r\na person is a subscriber of SingTel or M1 and he wants to\r\n\r\nswitch  to  Starhub, he cannot retain  his  phone  number\r\n\r\nunless he pays a monthly charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo  he either bears the inconvenience of a new number  or\r\n\r\nhe bears the burden of additional charges.  If we realise\r\n\r\nthat  SingTel  has a 49% market share and M1  has  a  33%\r\n\r\nmarket  share,  we can see that Starhub is disadvantaged,\r\n\r\nand such a decision of IDA does not encourage the type of\r\n\r\ncompetition that we would like to see and which I thought\r\n\r\nIDA is supposed to promote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Khaw, you have 30 seconds to reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> I agree with Mr Tan Soo Khoon that\r\n\r\nit  is logical to make the calling party pay for the call\r\n\r\nhe or she initiates.

Measures such as promotion  of  community\r\n\r\nsports and mutual self-help groups that cut across ethnic\r\n\r\nlines  would  be  some  of the measures  that  should  be\r\n\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the material divide, the income gap is widening\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  The average household income ratio at the\r\n\r\nbottom  10% has increased from 14.1 times in 1998  to  18\r\n\r\ntimes  in the year 2000, and the gap is expected to widen\r\n\r\neven further in the years ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social stratification may result if measures are not\r\n\r\ntaken  now  to  ameliorate the effects  of  the  widening\r\n\r\nincome  gap.

It would  be  made  even  more\r\n\r\nsensitive   and   potentially  divisive   when   external\r\n\r\ndevelopments  and forces come into play.   The  war  with\r\n\r\nIraq and the continuing fight against terrorism, with its\r\n\r\nMuslims and perceived Islamic connection, will make MCDS'\r\n\r\ntask more onerous and formidable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to touch briefly on the Iraq crisis\r\n\r\nand  its immediate impact on our cohesion.

Even among Muslims generally, there  is\r\n\r\nno  love lost for President Saddam Hussein but they  are,\r\n\r\nnonetheless, disturbed like many millions of  other  non-Muslims,  as they worry for the innocent Iraqis  who  are\r\n\r\nalso  victims  of the situation.  We pray and  hope  that\r\n\r\nthey  will be spared a prolonged disaster.  And we, as  a\r\n\r\ncountry  and a people, Muslims and non-Muslims  alike,  I\r\n\r\ntrust we rally to the call to provide humanitarian aid to\r\n\r\nthe Iraqi people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, back to MCDS, how are MCDS' efforts for better\r\n\r\nintegration taking shape, especially through IRCCs,  GROs\r\n\r\nand VWOs?

The better\r\n\r\nmixing  and  meeting  of hearts  and  minds  at  the  HDB\r\n\r\nheartlands  should  be one success criterion.

Its ramifications will be  seen  and\r\n\r\nfelt around the world in the coming days.  Singapore  may\r\n\r\nalso  be  affected.  We certainly hope that the  conflict\r\n\r\nwill   be  short  and  the  suffering  minimised  through\r\n\r\nhumanitarian efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore, what should our priorities be in this\r\n\r\nsituation?   Clearly, we have to concentrate on  tackling\r\n\r\nmatters  that are within our influence because our  goals\r\n\r\nmust  be  to act in our national interest.  Economically,\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  watch carefully the impact of the  war  and\r\n\r\npotential disruption to trade and production.  The bottom\r\n\r\nline is the impact on our ability to attract investments,\r\n\r\nexport our goods and services so that there will be  jobs\r\n\r\nfor Singaporeans. On security, we have to up our antenna,\r\n\r\nguard  against  potential terrorism  and  sabotage,  take\r\n\r\ndecisive  action  to  forestall and neutralise  any  such\r\n\r\nthreat  so  that  all  who live in,  work  in  and  visit\r\n\r\nSingapore  will continue to have confidence to  do  this.\r\n\r\nBecause this again is crucial to our livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the social front, Sir, we must step up all\r\n\r\nefforts  that  promote  and  strengthen  our  racial  and\r\n\r\nreligious  harmony.  For multi-racial and multi-religious\r\n\r\nSingapore, racial and religious harmony is not a nice-to-have quality.  It is the very glue that holds the various\r\n\r\nparts together, allowing for not only tolerance and  give\r\n\r\nand  take,  but  also mutual respect and mutual  support.\r\n\r\nUnder no circumstances must we let our racial harmony  be\r\n\r\nundermined or strained, or else all Singaporeans will pay\r\n\r\na heavy price for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the time for Singaporeans of all races\r\n\r\nand  religions, especially for leaders of all groups that\r\n\r\nrepresent  them, to stand together and clearly articulate\r\n\r\nthe message of unity above all.

Singapore  did  not\r\n\r\nwish for this war to happen, but it has.  And I hope that\r\n\r\nwe   can   therefore   make  use  of  the   circumstances\r\n\r\nnevertheless  to  strengthen our  unity  and  resilience.\r\n\r\nBeyond the current circumstances, I urge MCDS to consider\r\n\r\njoint  leadership seminars for the leaders of the various\r\n\r\nracial   groups   because   this   will   provide    more\r\n\r\nopportunities in a structured form for the leaders of the\r\n\r\ndifferent  races  to  meet, to learn  from  one  another,\r\n\r\nespecially  to  get  to  know one  another  better.

If there are indications of children  and\r\n\r\nother  citizens  being  more Singaporean  through  inter-racial   and/or  inter-religious  marriages   and   their\r\n\r\noffsprings  being  likewise, should the Ministry  promote\r\n\r\nsuch  marriages?   If  so,  and  if  it  is  a  necessary\r\n\r\nenticement, should our Government consider, as  examples,\r\n\r\ngranting  of tax incentives for inter-racial  and  inter-religious  marriages  and also priorities  for  entry  to\r\n\r\nprimary  schools,  as has been done in other  situations?\r\n\r\nIf  such  measures can promote a better multi-racial  and\r\n\r\nmulti-religious  society, which Singapore  always  boasts\r\n\r\nof,  let  us  test  it seriously, unless  of  course  the\r\n\r\nleadership  feels  that  race should  not  be  mixed  for\r\n\r\nwhatever reasons.

All\r\n\r\nthree  women could surface today only because  they  have\r\n\r\nfound  a  strong support group who, in the  words  of  Ms\r\n\r\nChua,  shared  information, thus empowering patients  and\r\n\r\ntheir caregivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last 15 years, we have unbridled growth\r\n\r\nand a very rapid pace of change, and the stress level  is\r\n\r\nhigh.  At various points in time, people did help to cope\r\n\r\nand  move  on.   The retrenched need help,  the  sandwich\r\n\r\ngeneration needs help, the physically disabled or  unwell\r\n\r\nneed  help, the alcoholic or smokers need help,  and  the\r\n\r\nlist goes on.  As a responsible Government, we must reach\r\n\r\nout to this group of people by providing some assistance,\r\n\r\nboth  financially and infrastructure-wise, to  help  them\r\n\r\nmove  on with the predicament.  We can reach out to  this\r\n\r\ngroup of people, so they know that they are not alone  in\r\n\r\nthe  darkest moments of their lives.  Support groups  can\r\n\r\nact  as  self-help  and mutual help  groups.   These  are\r\n\r\npressure-release valves, a stabiliser for the despondent,\r\n\r\nand the light of hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often said that it is in these darkest hours\r\n\r\nthat   a   listening  ear,  a  helping   hand,   and   an\r\n\r\nunderstanding smile are the balms that soothe  the  pain.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, MCDS can tangibly assist these mutual and  self-help groups by:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) providing trained facilitators and social\r\n\r\nworkers;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) publicising the existence and easy\r\n\r\naccessibility to such a group, perhaps a form of a  guide\r\n\r\ncould  be published to facilitate better access to  these\r\n\r\ngroups;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) providing some very basic start-up funds or\r\n\r\nmeeting  venues  in  different  parts  of  Singapore   to\r\n\r\nfacilitate their meeting; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) taking a proactive stand to encourage the\r\n\r\nformation of suitable support groups for both the  client\r\n\r\nand the patient, and the caregivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the last case, I read that Mrs Catherine Cheong\r\n\r\nis  keen to start a support group for vitiligo sufferers.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, MCDS could consider reaching out to her and give\r\n\r\nher a hand to form maybe the first vitiligo support group\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports (Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):</b> Sir, as we\r\n\r\nnegotiate the economic restructuring and show concern for\r\n\r\nthose  who need help, as war begins in Iraq and the world\r\n\r\nfaces  greater  uncertainty, the  need  for  us  here  in\r\n\r\nSingapore to continue to re-affirm our way of life  as  a\r\n\r\ncohesive,  harmonious society is ever more  pressing.   I\r\n\r\nappeal  to  all Singaporeans to stand united and  weather\r\n\r\nthis  temporary storm together.  We had done  so  in  the\r\n\r\npast and, each time, we had emerged stronger as a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This afternoon, while we focus on our domestic\r\n\r\nissues,  let  us  not lose sight of the  turmoil  in  the\r\n\r\ninternational arena.  We must not take safe  harbour  for\r\n\r\ngranted,  and must continuously work towards  maintaining\r\n\r\nnational peace and harmony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I thank Mr Charles Chong and other Members\r\n\r\nfor  raising their concerns about social cohesion, racial\r\n\r\nharmony and our society in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to also acknowledge the 98 cuts\r\n\r\nthat  MCDS  received - the most among all the Ministries.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  MOS Chan Soo Sen and I will  endeavour  to\r\n\r\nanswer all the queries to the best of our abilities  and,\r\n\r\nhopefully,  to the satisfaction of all Members  who  have\r\n\r\ntaken a keen interest in the work of our Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MCDS' vision is for Singapore to be a cohesive\r\n\r\nand  resilient society.  However, unlike Ministries  that\r\n\r\ndirectly  deliver  the  end  outcomes,  such  as  a  good\r\n\r\neducation or health system, MCDS primarily plays the role\r\n\r\nof  facilitator, enabler and catalyst.  We encourage  and\r\n\r\nenable the individual to show resilience, the family\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto show care and support, and the community to show inter-group  understanding  and interaction.   We  may  be  the\r\n\r\ncheerleaders,  and  sometimes  even  the  coach  or   the\r\n\r\nphysiotherapist, but we are not the players.  The players\r\n\r\nare each and every Singaporean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cohesive society is one that displays unity in\r\n\r\ndiversity.   We  want  to ensure we  have  strong  social\r\n\r\nnetworks amongst Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Players matter most. That is why they are valued\r\n\r\nmore  than  coaches or physiotherapists.  A  soccer  team\r\n\r\ncannot  perform at its best on the pitch, if the  players\r\n\r\ndo  not  get  along off-pitch, whether because  they  let\r\n\r\ntheir  different backgrounds come in the way, or  because\r\n\r\nof  other  reasons, such as stolen girlfriends or  flying\r\n\r\nboots.  In the same way, Singapore's ability to cope with\r\n\r\ntough times would also be affected, if Singaporeans  from\r\n\r\nvarious segments of society are not united.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our society has also been likened to a dish of rojak\r\n\r\n-  many  different  pieces, each with its own distinctive\r\n\r\nfeel  and  flavour,  with the prawn  paste  binding  them\r\n\r\ntogether and enhancing their taste.  The test of  a  good\r\n\r\nrojak is in the paste.  A cohesive society is like a good\r\n\r\ndish  of  rojak, with thick prawn paste being the  inter-group understanding, the interaction and cooperation,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as the shared values and aspirations that bind  the\r\n\r\nvarious  ethnic  groups together.  Our  challenge  is  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  we have the right paste, or the appropriate\r\n\r\nconnectors  that can only be developed through  enlarging\r\n\r\nour common space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social cohesion is about building social capital.\r\n\r\nSocial  capital  refers to the social  trust,  norms  and\r\n\r\nnetworks  that  people can draw upon for mutual  benefit.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words,  people getting  together  and  growing\r\n\r\ncomfortable  with one another, eg, through dialogues  and\r\n\r\nnetworking, as well as working and interacting on  common\r\n\r\nprojects.   In this manner, we build social  capital  and\r\n\r\nnot  allow social exclusion to take place.  If any  group\r\n\r\nfeels  that it does not belong, and feels excluded,  then\r\n\r\nour rich social tapestry is at risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as Mr Charles Chong has said, social cohesion\r\n\r\nmust go beyond racial and religious harmony, and includes\r\n\r\ncollaboration   between  various  groups,   eg,   between\r\n\r\nreligious  and secular groups, between the rich  and  the\r\n\r\npoor, between the young and the old, and between citizens\r\n\r\nand  foreigners.    We want to create  opportunities  for\r\n\r\nsuch  groups to interact in all aspects of life, such  as\r\n\r\nthrough   the  arts,  culture,  sports  and  recreational\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cohesive society should also go beyond mere talk\r\n\r\nto  action.  Volunteerism, philanthropy and mutual  self-help  groups can enable people to connect, cooperate  and\r\n\r\nbuild  bridges  across social divides.  These  activities\r\n\r\nenable  social  groups  to  interact  and  affirm  common\r\n\r\nvalues,  such  as  helping the  less  fortunate.   Common\r\n\r\nvalues  that all groups can uphold are a vital  dimension\r\n\r\nof  the  common space.  We also want more of the  support\r\n\r\ngroups that Miss Penny Low talked about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is widely believed that one test for social\r\n\r\ncohesion  in Singapore is the war on Iraq, which  started\r\n\r\nthis  morning.   Both Mayor Zainul and  Mayor  Heng  have\r\n\r\ntouched upon this.  As reported in the newspapers,  there\r\n\r\nis  some  feeling against the war, and this feeling  cuts\r\n\r\nacross racial and religious groups, even though there  is\r\n\r\nstrong support for the Government's stand as rational and\r\n\r\nin  Singapore's interest.  Such variations in  views  are\r\n\r\ninevitable.  They are found even in the US.  Whatever our\r\n\r\npersonal views, I am confident that we will maintain  our\r\n\r\nshared  perspectives  as Singaporeans.   We  have  passed\r\n\r\nprevious tests, and I am confident we will pass this one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst a cohesive society is one that displays unity\r\n\r\nin diversity, a resilient society is one that shows unity\r\n\r\nin  adversity.   Singapore has had  a  relatively  smooth\r\n\r\nride,  although a carefully managed one, in the  past  25\r\n\r\nyears.   But  now  we  are  entering  into  a  much  more\r\n\r\ncompetitive,  volatile  and uncertain  environment,  both\r\n\r\neconomically as well as geo-politically.  The ability  to\r\n\r\nrecover\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquickly from setbacks, whether from the loss of a job, of\r\n\r\nloved  ones,  or  from something like the  shock  of  the\r\n\r\nJemaah   Islamiyah  arrests,  these  are  tests  of   our\r\n\r\nresilience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be able to bounce back from misfortune and\r\n\r\ncope positively with challenges.  In fact, we must tackle\r\n\r\nchallenges  head-on.   To  enable  this,  MCDS   promotes\r\n\r\nindividual  resilience, family resilience  and  community\r\n\r\nresilience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the individual level, MCDS promotes personal\r\n\r\nresponsibility  and self-reliance.  We  provide  a  basic\r\n\r\nsocial  safety  net to look after the well-being  of  the\r\n\r\nsocially disadvantaged.  This net will help them build up\r\n\r\ntheir  self-esteem, so that they can get  back  on  their\r\n\r\nfeet  as  much as possible.  A good example of individual\r\n\r\nresilience is the story of Elim Chew, highlighted in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  last  week.   She  left  school  early,   but\r\n\r\ncontinued her education in the school of hard knocks, and\r\n\r\nturned   out   as  an  extremely  successful   streetwear\r\n\r\nretailer.   A firm believer in an attitude of  gratitude,\r\n\r\nshe even gives half her income to community causes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the family level, we help create a social\r\n\r\nenvironment  that  is  conducive to having  children  and\r\n\r\nraising  families.   We help facilitate  programmes  that\r\n\r\nstrengthen families, so that they can continue to be  the\r\n\r\nfirst  line of care and support for the individual.   The\r\n\r\nState can provide financial support to needy individuals,\r\n\r\nbut  it  can never replace the emotional care and  social\r\n\r\nsupport  that  only  family members  can  give.   A  good\r\n\r\nexample  of family resilience is the story of Kenny  Goh.\r\n\r\nHis  company, Ken-Air, may have collapsed, but his family\r\n\r\nties have strengthened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the community level, we promote the principle of\r\n\r\n\"Many  Helping  Hands\"  and enable communities  to  solve\r\n\r\ntheir  problems together.   The haves should help  bridge\r\n\r\nthe  social divide by helping the have-nots.   More  than\r\n\r\nthat,  there  should  be more collaboration  between  and\r\n\r\nwithin groups.  Community activities nurture human bonds,\r\n\r\nmutual support and social networks, which neither the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState  nor  the  market can provide.  A good  example  of\r\n\r\ncommunity resilience is the Seniors Befrienders programme\r\n\r\nrun  by the Lions Befrienders Service Association.  Quite\r\n\r\na  number  of the befrienders, who provide meal  delivery\r\n\r\nand  errand  running,  among other  things,  are  elderly\r\n\r\nthemselves.  In fact, 23 befrienders are 80 years old  or\r\n\r\nolder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with Mr Charles Chong, Mr Zainul\r\n\r\nAbidin  and other Members that we must continue to  forge\r\n\r\nracial  and  religious harmony.  Last  year,  I  reported\r\n\r\nfindings  from a benchmark Survey on the Social Attitudes\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans conducted by MCDS in 2001.  The findings\r\n\r\nwere  very  positive.  Nine out of 10  Singaporeans  were\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with  race and religious  group  relations  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  However, the 2001 survey was conducted before\r\n\r\nthe  September  11 terrorist attacks in the  US  and  the\r\n\r\narrest  of  JI  members  in Singapore  in  January  2002.\r\n\r\nHence,  I  said  that  my Ministry  would  be  conducting\r\n\r\nanother survey in 2002, to see if the views have changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong has asked for an update on the\r\n\r\nsecond  survey.  I am very happy to report that,  despite\r\n\r\nthe  two key events in the one-year interval, there  have\r\n\r\nbeen  no  significant  changes in satisfaction  with  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  state  of racial and religious group  relations.\r\n\r\nNine out of 10 Singaporeans continue to be satisfied with\r\n\r\nrace  relations, but with small differences, if the  data\r\n\r\nis  analysed by race: Chinese community, 88%, Malays 91%,\r\n\r\nand Indians 93%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second survey also found that almost all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  99%, were comfortable  with  the  idea  of\r\n\r\nallowing  their children to play with children  of  other\r\n\r\nraces.  96% of Singaporeans also thought that it was good\r\n\r\nto  have  people of different races living  in  the  same\r\n\r\nneighbourhood.   There  were no  significant  differences\r\n\r\nbetween the races in this regard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the more personal level, we found that the\r\n\r\nproportion  of Singaporeans who had close  friends  of  a\r\n\r\ndifferent race rose significantly, from 70% in 2001 to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n76% in 2002.  In fact, a much higher proportion of Malays\r\n\r\nindicated  that they have close friends of another  race,\r\n\r\nfrom 71% in 2001 to 86% in 2002.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these findings speak well of the current racial\r\n\r\nand religious group relations.  It suggests that there is\r\n\r\na  certain amount of social resilience among Singaporeans\r\n\r\nin  general,  a social resilience that provides  a  sound\r\n\r\nfoundation  for  safeguarding and  enhancing  racial  and\r\n\r\nreligious  group relations in Singapore, despite  shocks,\r\n\r\nsuch as terrorism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one note of concern is that, unlike 2001,\r\n\r\nin  2002  we  found that only six out of 10  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwith  tertiary education were satisfied with current race\r\n\r\nand  religious group relations.  This might be due  to  a\r\n\r\ngreater  sensitivity to the global terrorist  threat,  as\r\n\r\nwell   as   perhaps  increasing  expectations   of   what\r\n\r\nconstitute good racial and religious group relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the basic characteristics of Singaporean\r\n\r\nlife  is  the  presence  of, and the  continued  need  to\r\n\r\nenhance our common space.  Our common space reflects what\r\n\r\nmakes  us  uniquely  Singaporean,  while  embracing   the\r\n\r\ndiverse cultures and faiths that we come from.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of the common space allows for the\r\n\r\ndiversity  to  flourish primarily because what  brings  a\r\n\r\ndiverse  people  to the common space are the  values  and\r\n\r\naspirations  that define us all as Singaporeans.  Without\r\n\r\nthis  shared aspiration and the common values that define\r\n\r\nus,  there will be no Singapore. But how the common space\r\n\r\ngrows  depends  largely on how the different  communities\r\n\r\nsee  the  value  in  preserving  a  uniquely  Singaporean\r\n\r\nidentity.  Hence, we need to continuously  encourage  the\r\n\r\nbuilding   of  ties  across  all  groups,  in  order   to\r\n\r\ndemonstrate this value to all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of us would have experienced the idea of being\r\n\r\nin  a common space one way or the other as part of living\r\n\r\nin Singapore and being Singaporean at heart.  Let me cite\r\n\r\nsome everyday examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports is a universal activity and passion for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  regardless  of  age,  gender,   race   and\r\n\r\nreligion.  During the last World Cup finals, big  screens\r\n\r\nwere  set  up at a few public areas, and even  hospitals,\r\n\r\nfor  people to enjoy the match together.  You could  even\r\n\r\nfind  crowds  sitting or standing outside  shops  selling\r\n\r\ntelevision  sets,  watching soccer together.   And  every\r\n\r\ntime  a  goal was scored, they would cheer together,  and\r\n\r\nevery  time the referee made a bad call, they would  jeer\r\n\r\nhim together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also not many countries where you can find\r\n\r\ntemples, mosques and churches peacefully co-existing next\r\n\r\nto one another.  Just look at our Chinatown, Little India\r\n\r\nor Geylang East.  We know of several places of worship in\r\n\r\nSingapore   built  with  generous  donations   from   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  regardless  of  race  or  religion.    For\r\n\r\nexample,  Dr  Theyvendran, who oversaw the renovation  of\r\n\r\nthe Sri Senpaga Vinayagar Temple in Ceylon Road, told  me\r\n\r\nthat  the  temple  received donations from  Muslims,  and\r\n\r\ninvolved Chinese architects in its design.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we respect diversity within the common space,\r\n\r\nso  that all can be comfortable and feel at home  in  it.\r\n\r\nDiversity goes beyond race and religion. The common space\r\n\r\nincludes  diverse  groups, with different  interests  and\r\n\r\nneeds.  Examples include environmentalists,  arts  groups\r\n\r\nand  sports enthusiasts.  In other words, it is  a  space\r\n\r\nthat all Singaporeans have a stake in, no matter what  we\r\n\r\nare  and  what  our  interests  are.   Common  space   is\r\n\r\nunderpinned by our shared values, such as our  belief  in\r\n\r\nnurturing  strong families, meritocracy,  multi-racialism\r\n\r\nand a corrupt-free Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some are concerned that by enlarging the common\r\n\r\nspace,  our  private  values and ways  of  life  will  be\r\n\r\nthreatened.  It is not a zero-sum game. While we have our\r\n\r\nprivate  needs  and preferences, we can  accommodate  and\r\n\r\nappreciate others who are different within\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  common space. What we do in our private space should\r\n\r\nnot  make  it  harder  to  mingle and  understand  others\r\n\r\noutside  of  our belief systems. Cultural  and  religious\r\n\r\nvalues,  when  practised in the spirit  intended,  should\r\n\r\nhelp to enrich and enlarge the common space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Mr Charles Chong and Mr Zainul Abidin have\r\n\r\npointed  out,  as  a society, we need  to  find  ways  to\r\n\r\nmeaningfully   engage   one   another,   negotiate    our\r\n\r\ndifferences    and   move   forward.    The    Grassroots\r\n\r\nOrganisations  (GROs),  Inter-Racial  Confidence  Circles\r\n\r\n(IRCCs) and Harmony Circles are some of these platforms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IRCCs and Harmony Circles are avenues to expand the\r\n\r\ncommon  space.  The IRCCs are in a good position to  help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  make  sense  of events  that  affect  their\r\n\r\nlives.  The  IRCCs comprise a diverse group  of  national\r\n\r\nleaders from the local community.  Currently, the members\r\n\r\ncomprise 23% Malays and 16% are Indians.  Half are people\r\n\r\nfrom outside the grassroots network, including community,\r\n\r\nschool and religious leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the IRCCs, community and religious leaders\r\n\r\nform friendships and better understand one another. Armed\r\n\r\nwith a good understanding of other communities as well as\r\n\r\ntheir  own communities, the IRCC members are in a  better\r\n\r\nposition  to  help  their own communities  and  followers\r\n\r\nnavigate through sensitive or difficult issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The friendships and understanding built up will also\r\n\r\nhelp  manage the ground reactions during times of crisis.\r\n\r\nWhile  some people doubt the value of visiting  religious\r\n\r\nplaces of worship, IRCC members told me that this is like\r\n\r\nvisiting  someone in his own home.  It really breaks  the\r\n\r\nice among the members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IRCCs also add value to grassroots organisations by\r\n\r\ngiving  suggestions on how their activities can  be  more\r\n\r\ninclusive.   For example, avoiding evening activities  on\r\n\r\nThursday nights, as Muslims tend to congregate in mosques\r\n\r\nat those times for extended prayers.  And this culminates\r\n\r\nwith the Friday afternoon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprayer  session.  Many Hindus, for  example,   visit  the\r\n\r\ntemple on Friday evenings, just as many Christians go  to\r\n\r\nchurch  on Sunday mornings. Besides playing this advisory\r\n\r\nrole,  IRCCs  also  reach  out to promote  cross-cultural\r\n\r\nactivities  that  attract  all races  and  religions  and\r\n\r\nengage in public education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Bishan-Toa Payoh North IRCC,\r\n\r\ntogether  with  five  religious  groups  and  the  Inter-Religious  Organisation,  reached  many  residents  in  a\r\n\r\npublic  education  effort called  \"Celebrating  New  Year\r\n\r\nthrough  Community  Bonding\".  Some  35,000  participants\r\n\r\nturned  up at the Carnival last weekend on 15th and  16th\r\n\r\nMarch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November last year, Fengshan IRCC had a Community\r\n\r\nQuiz  targeted at young people from primary and secondary\r\n\r\nschools,  and  the voluntary sector.  The  quiz  promoted\r\n\r\ngreater  awareness and understanding of  ethnic  cultures\r\n\r\namong school students.  The feedback from the schools was\r\n\r\nvery  positive.  Fengshan IRCC, together with South  East\r\n\r\nCDC,  is  now  thinking of developing a puzzle  book  for\r\n\r\nyounger children in the South East District.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next phase, IRCCs will expand their efforts\r\n\r\nto get their members more actively engaged.  The National\r\n\r\nSteering  Committee on IRCCs will be putting  together  a\r\n\r\nresource  guide for IRCC members to help  them  do  their\r\n\r\nwork.   The Committee is also planning more training  for\r\n\r\nIRCC members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further support such bottom-up community\r\n\r\ninitiatives, my Ministry will give more than $80,000  for\r\n\r\nfour  community projects under the pilot  phase  for  the\r\n\r\nCommunity  Harmony  Grants  Scheme.   Let  me  give   two\r\n\r\nexamples of the approved projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inter-Religious Organisation will develop an\r\n\r\ninter-faith  manual  to  guide community  and  grassroots\r\n\r\ngroups  who  wish  to  organise more inclusive  community\r\n\r\nevents  and activities that would cater to the  needs  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans of various faiths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joint Social Service Centre in Central Singapore\r\n\r\nCDC  will be starting a course for frontline staff,  such\r\n\r\nas  nurses  and social workers, to enable them to  better\r\n\r\nappreciate ethnic differences and serve their clients  of\r\n\r\ndifferent races more effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are just two examples. We would, of course,\r\n\r\nbe  very  happy  to  hear new ideas from  any  Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament or member of the public on activities that can\r\n\r\nbring about better inter-group understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from facilitating inter-racial and inter-religious activities, the Government has also worked with\r\n\r\nreligious  groups to reaffirm Singapore's  commitment  to\r\n\r\nfundamental principles that have held Singapore  together\r\n\r\nas a multi-religious society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Community Development and\r\n\r\nSports,  Mr  Chan Soo Sen, has been leading this  effort.\r\n\r\nHis  working committee has held many dialogues with  main\r\n\r\nreligious  groups  and  achieved  a  consensus   on   the\r\n\r\nDeclaration  on Religious Harmony.  He will be  ready  to\r\n\r\nshare about the Declaration soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one concrete way of strengthening ties and\r\n\r\nbonds  in our society and bridging social divides  is  to\r\n\r\npromote   volunteerism  and  philanthropy.   Philanthropy\r\n\r\nrefers   to  the  giving  of  money  and  resources   for\r\n\r\ncharitable  purposes.  It comes from the Greek  word  for\r\n\r\n\"love  for  mankind\".  This sense of giving back  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  cuts across all boundaries, be it class,  age,\r\n\r\ngender, race or religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a strong charitable culture in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Foundations, clan associations and  religious\r\n\r\nand  community groups, work tirelessly to raise funds for\r\n\r\nvarious  causes.   Most  people would  expect  charitable\r\n\r\ngiving  to fall in bad times.  But the numbers show  that\r\n\r\neven  in bad times, the haves are doing more to help  the\r\n\r\nhave-nots.  Donations to Institutions of Public Character\r\n\r\nrose every year from $157 million in 1995 to $381 million\r\n\r\nin 2001, despite the financial crisis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  1997  and the economic downturn in 2001.   Similarly,\r\n\r\nour  national  volunteerism rate increased from  9.3%  in\r\n\r\n2000 to 14.9% last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have the 2002 figures yet, but recent fund-raisers such as the President's Challenge and the Ren Ci\r\n\r\nHospital  Charity Show have received overwhelming  public\r\n\r\nsupport.   The  donations  to the  President's  Challenge\r\n\r\nincreased  50% from $4.1 million in 2001 to $6.3  million\r\n\r\nin  2002.  The Community Chest, which raised $37  million\r\n\r\nin  FY  2001, expects to meet its fund-raising target  of\r\n\r\n$40  million  in  FY 2002.  All this shows  that  we  are\r\n\r\nindeed a caring, cohesive and compassionate society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philanthropic activities in Singapore are not new.\r\n\r\nBut  we  need more modern-day versions of Lee Kong Chian,\r\n\r\nGovindasamy  Pillai, CJP Paglar and  Mohammed  Eunos  Bin\r\n\r\nAbdullah - people who had a passion and did good for  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.  We should preserve the spirit of philanthropy\r\n\r\nand  broaden  its  base.  Philanthropy is  about  \"giving\r\n\r\nback\"  to society.  It provides an important channel  for\r\n\r\nthe  more  successful to help others and  to  better  our\r\n\r\nsociety.  It is an important bridge, nurturing people  in\r\n\r\na   world   of  increasing  income  inequality.   Besides\r\n\r\nbringing  people together, philanthropic  activities  are\r\n\r\ncritical  in  complementing the Government  in  providing\r\n\r\nfinancial support for social causes.  There is  room  for\r\n\r\nmore philanthropists in Singapore.  So I fully agree with\r\n\r\nMr  Charles  Chong that more needs to be done to  promote\r\n\r\nphilanthropy in Singapore as a way of bridging the income\r\n\r\ndivide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An excellent example of a modern-day philanthropic\r\n\r\norganisation in Singapore is the Tsao Foundation.  It  is\r\n\r\nguided  by  the vision of their founder, Mrs Tsao  Ng  Yu\r\n\r\nShun,  who was 86 years young when it was first chartered\r\n\r\nin 1993.  She wanted to do something about the challenges\r\n\r\nof  growing old.  Tsao Foundation became one of  the  few\r\n\r\nphilanthropic   organisations  in  Asia   that   provides\r\n\r\nservices rather than grants.  The Foundation carries  out\r\n\r\na\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwide  range  of  programmes, including a  community-based\r\n\r\nhealthcare  programme, which runs a  domiciliary  medical\r\n\r\nclinic service, and a community care management service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, my Ministry will provide more resources to\r\n\r\nthe  National  Volunteer Centre to promote  philanthropy.\r\n\r\nThe   National   Volunteer  Centre   currently   promotes\r\n\r\nvolunteerism as a way of life. Promoting philanthropy has\r\n\r\ngood   synergy  with  volunteerism,  as  both   call   on\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to give of their time, talent and resources,\r\n\r\nto make a difference to the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I mentioned earlier, Singaporeans donate\r\n\r\ngenerously.   They do so as they trust and are  confident\r\n\r\nthat  the  charities will do the right thing.  We  should\r\n\r\nnot  take  this trust for granted.  Charities  should  be\r\n\r\nprepared to show that the donations are spent wisely, and\r\n\r\ngo towards programmes that make a difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenges we face go beyond encouraging charity\r\n\r\nand  keeping faith with the donors.  Philanthropy has  to\r\n\r\nbe  increasingly  strategic,  and  directed  at  emerging\r\n\r\nsocial  needs. Money raised should be invested  for  good\r\n\r\nresults.  Some social problems need to be tackled via the\r\n\r\nroot  causes.   For  those who  can  be  helped  to  help\r\n\r\nthemselves, we should empower them, rather than provide a\r\n\r\ncrutch.  For those who need lifelong support, there  must\r\n\r\nbe  a safety net to protect them. We need to channel  our\r\n\r\npassion and resources strategically to tackle the  social\r\n\r\nchallenges that we face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In developed countries, donors, especially rich\r\n\r\nphilanthropists  and foundations, are  moving  towards  a\r\n\r\nmodel of social investment.  They want to be involved  in\r\n\r\nenterprising,  outcome-driven  programmes.   They  donate\r\n\r\nfunds, share expertise with non-profit agencies, and take\r\n\r\nan  interest in the programmes.  For example,  the  Robin\r\n\r\nHood  Foundation  was set up by an investment  banker  to\r\n\r\nraise funds and partner organisations to fight poverty in\r\n\r\nNew York.  Programmes are regularly reviewed for results,\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   foundation  also  sources  for  expertise  to  help\r\n\r\nprogrammes do better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to find new ways of getting the best social\r\n\r\nvalue  from the charity dollar. We need to find  ways  of\r\n\r\nencouraging  new  philanthropists, who  expect  and  want\r\n\r\ngreater involvement for the funds they donate, to come to\r\n\r\nthe  fore.  Our infrastructure has to support the  growth\r\n\r\nof  more foundations and philanthropists, and enable  our\r\n\r\ncharities to run the distance. Corporations can add value\r\n\r\nby   partnering   non-profit   organisations   in   their\r\n\r\nprogrammes, and exercise social responsibility. They will\r\n\r\nalso  infuse  corporate  expertise  into  the  non-profit\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another concrete example of community self-help\r\n\r\nis  social entrepreneurship.  Social entrepreneurship  is\r\n\r\nabout  bringing business practices or innovation to solve\r\n\r\nsocial problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example is the recently-established Food from\r\n\r\nthe  Heart  programme, which delivers unsold  bread  from\r\n\r\nbakeries  across  the island to charity  homes.   It  was\r\n\r\ninitiated by a couple, who used their logistics expertise\r\n\r\nand  implemented  a mobile tracking system.  The  system,\r\n\r\naccessed by handphones, coordinates the times and  routes\r\n\r\nvolunteers take to transport bread and pastries  to  some\r\n\r\n35  homes.  A social enterprise is essentially a business\r\n\r\nwith a social mission, not merely commercial objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Voluntary Welfare Organisations like MINDS,\r\n\r\nTeen  Challenge  and  the Singapore  Association  of  the\r\n\r\nVisually   Handicapped   also  have   humble   commercial\r\n\r\nactivities or what may be termed as social enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social enterprises are becoming more sophisticated.\r\n\r\nOne  example  is the Industrial Services and  Cooperative\r\n\r\nSociety, commonly known as ISCOS, set up in 1989, to help\r\n\r\ndischarged inmates re-integrate into society through work\r\n\r\nrehabilitation.   It  promotes self-esteem  and  economic\r\n\r\nindependence   by   developing  businesses   to   provide\r\n\r\nemployment  opportunities.  ISCOS  is  financially  self-sufficient, and profitable with healthy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrevenue.   Another example is the Development of  Economy\r\n\r\nfor  Women  Credit  Cooperative Ltd, or  DEW,  which  has\r\n\r\nassisted   1,500  women  since  1981  to  save   together\r\n\r\nregularly and lend to one another from the savings  at  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  rate  of  interest.  DEW members  assist  one\r\n\r\nanother  through  mutual  cooperation.   To  foster   and\r\n\r\nsupport  emerging social enterprises,  MCDS  will,  as  a\r\n\r\nstart,  establish a $2 million Social Enterprise Fund  in\r\n\r\nFY03.    The  fund  will provide some capital  to  social\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs seeking to invest in start-up  projects  or\r\n\r\nto scale-up fledgling social enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Sin Boon Ann made some comments on social\r\n\r\nassistance  but  I  will address them  later  when  other\r\n\r\nMembers  speaking  on  the same  topic  have  made  their\r\n\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low spoke about encouraging the formation\r\n\r\nof support groups.  I agree with her and I am glad to see\r\n\r\nsupport  groups  springing up in Singapore.   Members  of\r\n\r\nsuch   groups   give   one  another  emotional   support,\r\n\r\ninformation  and  other  resources.   Many  are  run   by\r\n\r\nvolunteers.    They  exemplify  the  spirit   of   active\r\n\r\ncitizenry and self-help.  There are many such groups that\r\n\r\nwe may not know about.  Allow me to highlight a few.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancer Story.com was founded by Lee Soh Hong to\r\n\r\nshare  her  experience in dealing with  cancer  and  help\r\n\r\npatients  and  their  families face  the  battle  against\r\n\r\ncancer.   Another example is the Amputees Caring Together\r\n\r\n(ACT)  Club  at the Alexandra Hospital which was  started\r\n\r\nlast year.  The Club brings together people who have lost\r\n\r\ntheir  limbs  and are struggling to cope with  the  loss.\r\n\r\nThe   Club   is   an   initiative   of   the   Hospital's\r\n\r\nRehabilitation Department and its key organiser, Ng  Hwee\r\n\r\nHian,  is a physiotherapist.  A support group was  formed\r\n\r\nto  help the amputees talk through their fears, and  help\r\n\r\nthem and their families cope so that they can live normal\r\n\r\nlives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Volunteer Centre supports such support\r\n\r\ngroups as well as volunteer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhosting organisations by providing start-up grants of  up\r\n\r\nto  $50,000  on a co-funding basis.  The Centre  provides\r\n\r\ninformation  which people sector groups find useful,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  on  how to start an organisation  or  go  about\r\n\r\ngetting  fund-raising permits.  It also gives advice  and\r\n\r\ntraining  on  volunteer recruitment  and  management  and\r\n\r\nfacilitates  volunteer recruitment through  its  website,\r\n\r\nand through its partners such as companies.  The National\r\n\r\nVolunteer  Centre  currently  has  a  list  of  volunteer\r\n\r\nhosting  organisations on its website, including  support\r\n\r\ngroups.  It intends to expand the listing so that  it  is\r\n\r\nmore  comprehensive.  I also urge more  established  VWOs\r\n\r\nand  people  sector  organisations to take  such  support\r\n\r\ngroups  under their wings, to use their premises  and  so\r\n\r\non,  in the spirit of people sector partnership.   So  to\r\n\r\nthe  lady  that  Miss  Penny Low has mentioned,  I  would\r\n\r\nencourage her to approach the NVC and I am sure we can do\r\n\r\nsomething to help her start a new support group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ultimately, Singaporeans must want to be in such\r\n\r\ngroups.   As  mentioned by Miss Penny Low, Straits  Times\r\n\r\njournalist,  Ms Chua Mui Hoong, who recently  shared  the\r\n\r\nstory of her battle with cancer, recounted in her article\r\n\r\nhow  she  found comfort in support groups in the  US  but\r\n\r\nfelt  that those with cancer in Singapore tended to  keep\r\n\r\nto  themselves.   Singaporeans  need  to  learn  to  come\r\n\r\ntogether.  This is what social capital is about: building\r\n\r\nnetworks of trust for mutual benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chandra Mohan has also raised the point\r\n\r\nabout  whether  or not we want to encourage  inter-racial\r\n\r\nmarriages  and  the adoption of children  from  different\r\n\r\nracial  groups.   Sir, this is a personal  decision.   We\r\n\r\nsupport  marriages.  MCDS is pro-marriage and pro-family,\r\n\r\nbut  ultimately groups will have to decide  what  is  the\r\n\r\nbest  outcome  for themselves.  Currently, there  are  no\r\n\r\nstudies  that  we know of to show that marriages  between\r\n\r\ntwo  people  of  different races  would  promote  greater\r\n\r\nunderstanding.   I  can  speak  from  my   own   personal\r\n\r\nexperience  for my wife is not a Malay.  I  think  it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult to say whether\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor not my son will be more tolerant, or more integrative,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  would depend upon the values of the  parents\r\n\r\nand  not  their racial backgrounds.  At the same time,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to assure Mr Mohan that we are serious  about\r\n\r\nintegration  and about the need to promote a more  caring\r\n\r\nsociety.   But that seriousness need not be reflected  in\r\n\r\nour  willingness  to encourage such inter-racial  unions.\r\n\r\nThis  is  ultimately up to each individual to decide  who\r\n\r\nshould their partner be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan also has said that we should\r\n\r\npromote  more  schemes to promote compassionate  feelings\r\n\r\ntowards the poor and the needy among our school children.\r\n\r\nAs  I  understand it, MOE has a programme to promote such\r\n\r\nactivities  within the schools and I will not touch  upon\r\n\r\nthat.  But, at the more general level, I have given  some\r\n\r\nexamples  on  some of the things that  we  have  done  to\r\n\r\nachieve  their objectives.  A lot is being done  by  MCDS\r\n\r\nand  its  partners.  I will be most happy to  provide  Mr\r\n\r\nMohan with some of the details of these programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, I have outlined MCDS' programmes that\r\n\r\nwill  help  to build our cohesiveness as a society.   But\r\n\r\nultimately,  the  choice is ours.  If  every  Singaporean\r\n\r\nsees   the  value  in  persevering  and  continuing  this\r\n\r\nexperiment called Singapore, then our efforts will not be\r\n\r\nin  vain.  Sir, I am optimistic about Singapore's  future\r\n\r\nas  a  nation.  Under all that bellyaching and complaints\r\n\r\nthat  we  hear at our meet-the-people sessions and  other\r\n\r\nmeetings, lies a strong spirit of wanting to see  through\r\n\r\nthese difficult times together as a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It warms my heart to see one of my staff, a Chinese\r\n\r\nSingaporean,  stopping her car at the top  of  the  hill,\r\n\r\nwhere  MCDS  is located, in order to give a  ride  to  an\r\n\r\nelderly  Malay Singaporean man down the hill.  The  basic\r\n\r\nhuman  instinct  to  help  a  fellow  man  is  alive   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   My feeling is that even those who  criticise\r\n\r\ndo so because they care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, Mr Speaker, I am confident that the choice\r\n\r\nthat  the Old Guard made in 1965, in taking the  leap  of\r\n\r\nfaith to be on our own, with a vision of a peaceful and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogressive  nation  that offers  opportunities  to  all,\r\n\r\nregardless  of race, language or religion, will  continue\r\n\r\nto  be supported and built upon further by generations to\r\n\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have addressed most of the questions, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, many of our disabled are\r\n\r\ncapable  of  making  valuable  contributions  to  society\r\n\r\nshould  they  be given the opportunity to  achieve  their\r\n\r\nfull  potential  and  assistance  to  live  and  function\r\n\r\nindependently.

Like  Mr  Charles\r\n\r\nChong  and many others, under various Ministries we  have\r\n\r\nalready raised this issue on the disabled.  Today,  I  am\r\n\r\nhere  to again talk about the disabled and children  with\r\n\r\nspecial needs, but I am parking this right now under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Community Development and Sports because  it\r\n\r\nis  my hope that the ownership to look at the whole issue\r\n\r\nin  an integrated manner will be taken on by the Ministry\r\n\r\nso that we can have a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  integrated approach to issues of the disabled,  and\r\n\r\nthis includes Ministry of Manpower for job opportunities,\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Transport for better  equipped  buses,  and\r\n\r\naccessibility to buildings where the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment   is  concerned.   I  think   there   is   an\r\n\r\nopportunity  here  as  the IMC on Ageing  has  filed  its\r\n\r\nreport and, with much less work and fewer resources,  one\r\n\r\ncan  piggy-back ride on that report to look at the issues\r\n\r\nrelated  to  people with disabilities in Singapore.   For\r\n\r\nfar  too long they have fallen between the cracks, caught\r\n\r\nup  in  the bureaucracy, or in silo minds.  This is quite\r\n\r\nsimilar  to  the  crow  situation  that  Dr  Teo  Ho  Pin\r\n\r\nmentioned  yesterday, depending on where the crow  lands,\r\n\r\nthat  is, the Ministry that picks up the issue where  the\r\n\r\ndisabled are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testimony to how this mindset has played out on the\r\n\r\nground  is evident, if I can give an example.  Imagine  a\r\n\r\ndisabled person in a wheel-chair coming out of the MRT  - it has to be the North East Line because that is the only\r\n\r\none  right  now  with disabled-friendly  features  -  and\r\n\r\ngetting to the bus-stop but got stuck because there is no\r\n\r\nbus.   A friendly taxi driver picks him up and sends  him\r\n\r\nto  a  shopping  complex, but this is a shopping  complex\r\n\r\nwhere the BCA guidelines are not mandatory and perhaps it\r\n\r\ndoes not have a ramp for the person to get in.  So we are\r\n\r\nstuck again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this has gone on for far too long and it is\r\n\r\nmy  appeal  that the Ministry will take the ownership  to\r\n\r\nget  representatives  from different  Ministries  to  get\r\n\r\ntogether to look at this issue from the beginning to  the\r\n\r\nend.  Even a simple thing like finding a Braille greeting\r\n\r\ncard is tough in Singapore.  So we have small issues  and\r\n\r\nlarge issues and hopefully we will not have to come to  a\r\n\r\nstage  where  we spend $78 million later to retrofit  all\r\n\r\nthe MRT stations.  It is my hope that this will come true\r\n\r\nand  it can begin with a demographic profile study of the\r\n\r\npeople with disabilities in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would like to add to what the two hon. Members\r\n\r\nhave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njust mentioned regarding the issue of transport needs.  I\r\n\r\nfeel  very strongly, Sir, that this issue should  rightly\r\n\r\nbe a transport issue and not a welfare issue.  What is my\r\n\r\ncontext  for saying so?  We heard earlier today  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse how MOE is providing funding and other support  for\r\n\r\nspecial  education.   MOH is also helping  nursing  homes\r\n\r\nmanaged by VWOs meet their financial requirements besides\r\n\r\nother   forms  of  assistance.   In  other   words,   the\r\n\r\neducational needs of children with disabilities  and  the\r\n\r\nnursing  care  of  older adults are not seen  as  welfare\r\n\r\nconcerns  and,  therefore,  the  responsibility  of  MCDS\r\n\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the public transport needs of people with\r\n\r\ndisabilities  should not be so regarded.   However,  Sir,\r\n\r\nsince  my cut was diverted from the MOT line to the  MCDS\r\n\r\nline I shall now flag my question to the Minister on  the\r\n\r\nsame  lines as my colleagues earlier on.  So, apart  from\r\n\r\nthe  measures by MOT and LTA to make MRT and LRT stations\r\n\r\nand  trains disabled-friendly, what other steps have been\r\n\r\nand  will  be taken to maximise opportunities for  people\r\n\r\nwith  disabilities to utilise public transport, including\r\n\r\ntaxis, for schooling, employment, social and recreational\r\n\r\npurposes?   Sir, in resolving the disabilities' transport\r\n\r\nissue  between  the  relevant  authorities,  I  earnestly\r\n\r\nrequest that the gap between goodwill and political  will\r\n\r\nbe  bridged - since the Minister has mentioned  bridge  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  times - to avoid any sense of  ill-will  from\r\n\r\nemerging later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, one of the most\r\n\r\ndreaded  diseases  is  mental illness.   Mental  diseases\r\n\r\ncause  loss  of enthusiasm to live and affect  the  self-esteem  of  persons affected.  Human beings are generally\r\n\r\nreluctant    to   associate   themselves   with    mental\r\n\r\ninstitutions and mentally handicapped people.  There is a\r\n\r\nphobia  of sorts, and unless you have a family member  or\r\n\r\nclose friend or relative hospitalised there, you try  and\r\n\r\navoid  such institutions.  There is generally,  wittingly\r\n\r\nor  unwittingly,  stigmatisation of mentally  handicapped\r\n\r\npeople in our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsociety.   This must be looked at seriously and  remedial\r\n\r\nmeasures taken.  What can the Ministry and all of  us  do\r\n\r\nto  try and de-stigmatise mental illness and take care of\r\n\r\nthe  mentally handicapped?  Our Government does care  for\r\n\r\nthis, but can do more, I believe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Dr Siegmund Freud's day, one may argue that\r\n\r\nscientific  advances made in psychiatry, mental  disorder\r\n\r\nand  mentally handicapped research have not been so  far-reaching that we now understand fully how the mind really\r\n\r\nworks,  how mental problems arise and what the cures  are\r\n\r\nfor   mental   illnesses,   be   it   manic   depression,\r\n\r\nschizophrenia or any other mental illness.   The  various\r\n\r\npsychiatric  medicines  available  today,  for   example,\r\n\r\nLithium,  Proziac,  Respadol, etc,  and  ECT  doses,  ie,\r\n\r\nelectrical doses to the brains, have reduced the  problem\r\n\r\nof  psychiatry compared to the 1950s.  Equally  important\r\n\r\nwould  be  the care and concern shown by the  psychiatric\r\n\r\npatient's family members, relatives and friends  and  the\r\n\r\ncommunity as a whole.  What are the measures taken,  Sir,\r\n\r\nby  the Ministry to educate our people on psychiatry  and\r\n\r\nthe  mentally handicapped and how do we adopt  programmes\r\n\r\nto   help   society   to  be  more  knowledgeable   about\r\n\r\npsychiatric illness and bring about de-stigmatisation  of\r\n\r\nmental  illness  in  our  society?   We  should  try  and\r\n\r\ninstitutionalise  psychiatric  and  mentally  handicapped\r\n\r\nsupport  groups, have websites and promote organisations,\r\n\r\neither voluntary or Government-sponsored, and I hope  our\r\n\r\nSingaporeans would go the extra mile to do more  for  the\r\n\r\nmentally handicapped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Over the next five\r\n\r\nyears,  we will spend $60 million more on programmes  for\r\n\r\nthe disabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, our programmes will focus on early\r\n\r\nintervention to give\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren  with disabilities the best chance to lead  life\r\n\r\nas  independently as possible.  With early  intervention,\r\n\r\nwe  can  improve the number of disabled children who  can\r\n\r\nbenefit  from mainstream schooling.  Specialists  at  KKH\r\n\r\nand    NUH   estimate   that   with   appropriate   early\r\n\r\nintervention,  up  to 80% of children with  developmental\r\n\r\nproblems  would  be  able to attend  normal  schools  and\r\n\r\nsubsequently  lead  independent adult lives  compared  to\r\n\r\nabout  a  third  today.  Those who  cannot  benefit  from\r\n\r\nmainstream schooling will have Special Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 300 children aged 0-6 years are already\r\n\r\nbenefiting from early intervention programmes for infants\r\n\r\nand  children.  Take the example of Matthew (not his real\r\n\r\nname),  who  suffers from ataxia, a degenerative  nervous\r\n\r\ntissue  condition,  and delayed gross motor  development.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  Asian  Women  Welfare  Association's  Special\r\n\r\nSchool's  early  intervention programme,  he  had  weekly\r\n\r\ntherapy   and   progressed  well  enough  to   attend   a\r\n\r\nkindergarten  class  at  the  PAP  Community   Foundation\r\n\r\nEducation Centre.  Now 7 years old, he is in Primary  One\r\n\r\nin a mainstream school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From April this year, my Ministry will co-fund these\r\n\r\nprogrammes with NCSS to reach more children like Matthew.\r\n\r\nThere  are  currently  three centres  funded  by  MOE  to\r\n\r\nprovide early intervention for infants and children.   We\r\n\r\nwill  now  fund  these, and plan to  set  up  three  more\r\n\r\ncentres, catering to at least another 150 children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, my Ministry is working with\r\n\r\nchildcare  centres to take in children with  disabilities\r\n\r\nunder   the   integrated   childcare   programme.    This\r\n\r\ndevelopmental programme enables these children to  attend\r\n\r\nthe  same childcare centres as non-disabled children  and\r\n\r\ninteract with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you the example of a girl named Lisa\r\n\r\n(not  her  real name), a child who had mild developmental\r\n\r\ndisabilities  and  attended  the  Presbyterian  Community\r\n\r\nServices  integrated childcare programme.  Lisa responded\r\n\r\nwell to the integrated childcare programme and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade  great  improvements  in  communicating  with  other\r\n\r\nchildren  and  her teachers.  She has since  gone  on  to\r\n\r\nPrimary  One, in a mainstream school, and can  now  speak\r\n\r\nboth  in  English  and  Mandarin.  With  greater  funding\r\n\r\nsupport,  we hope to see more children like Lisa  succeed\r\n\r\nin  getting  a  mainstream  education  because  of  early\r\n\r\nintervention.   Six centres will provide  places  for  60\r\n\r\ndisabled children this year.  We plan to expand  this  to\r\n\r\nprovide  places for 250 disabled children over  the  next\r\n\r\nfive  years.  More places can be considered if  there  is\r\n\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like any other person, a disabled person wants to be\r\n\r\ngainfully employed, self-reliant and a part of mainstream\r\n\r\nlife.   To  this  end,  we  will work  with  partners  to\r\n\r\nidentify  more  jobs and training needs of  persons  with\r\n\r\ndisabilities.   We  want  to see  more  employers  coming\r\n\r\nforward  and  giving  the  disabled  a  chance  to  prove\r\n\r\nthemselves.   A  company like Trusted Hub,  for  example,\r\n\r\nwhich  deals  in high end digital data storage  solutions\r\n\r\nfor  office documents, makes the effort to hire  disabled\r\n\r\npersons.   They  now  make  up  more  than  70%  of   its\r\n\r\nworkforce.   We  will  step up efforts  to  raise  public\r\n\r\nawareness and correct negative attitudes towards  persons\r\n\r\nwith disabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistive Technology (AT) can improve the\r\n\r\nproductivity of persons with disabilities and  facilitate\r\n\r\ntheir  learning  and employment.  The  use  of  Assistive\r\n\r\nTechnology  is  still  sporadic  today  as  much  of  the\r\n\r\nequipment is imported and costly, and so out of reach  to\r\n\r\nmany  of those who could benefit from it.  To ensure that\r\n\r\ndisabled   persons  can  afford  and  access  appropriate\r\n\r\nenabling   technology,  we  will  set  up  an   Assistive\r\n\r\nTechnology Fund to provide grants to needy individuals to\r\n\r\nco-pay for assistive technology that could enable them to\r\n\r\nlearn or gain employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just give you one example, Sir. The fund\r\n\r\nwill  help more Singaporeans with disabilities to  manage\r\n\r\ntheir  tasks  expected in the school  or  the  workplace.\r\n\r\nTake Ms Lim Lin Li, as an example.  A graduate of Nanyang\r\n\r\nPolytechnic in 2001 with a Diploma in Accountancy and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaxation,  she  is  confined to a  wheelchair  due  to  a\r\n\r\nweakening of muscles in her limbs.  She is now working as\r\n\r\nan  accounts assistant with the Salvation Army  -  thanks\r\n\r\nto  the  special  keyboard and numeric pad  for  PC  work\r\n\r\nprovided by the Society for the Physically Disabled.  So,\r\n\r\nby  the  use  of AT, she is able to work like  any  other\r\n\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting the technology alone is not enough. We need\r\n\r\npartners  in  the  private and  people  sectors  to  come\r\n\r\nforward  and  help  users get the most  of  this  scheme.\r\n\r\nToday,  a  number of VWOs are already providing assistive\r\n\r\ntechnology  support  to  their  clients.   They  will  be\r\n\r\nengaged to help assess their clients' needs, acquire  the\r\n\r\nequipment, train and provide the necessary support to the\r\n\r\nusers.   My Ministry is still working out the details  of\r\n\r\nthe scheme which will be released in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has not neglected caregivers of the\r\n\r\ndisabled.  We are working with NCSS to set up a  one-stop\r\n\r\ninformation and referral centre to help caregivers of the\r\n\r\ndisabled find the right information, advice and services.\r\n\r\nWe  will  also  set up Special Student Care  Centres  for\r\n\r\nchildren  with  disabilities while their parents  are  at\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with Ms Braema that we need to give\r\n\r\nthe disabled a helping hand to be part of the mainstream.\r\n\r\nThe measures I have just outlined will help achieve this.\r\n\r\nThe  IMC  on the Ageing Population already has its  hands\r\n\r\nfull  dealing  with  the issues on the  elderly,  and  we\r\n\r\nshould  let it focus on these efforts.  However, some  of\r\n\r\nthe   initiatives  for  the  elderly  also  benefit   the\r\n\r\ndisabled,  eg,  the  work on barrier-free  access.   Over\r\n\r\ntime, we will see improvements in the situation for  both\r\n\r\nthe elderly and the disabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong, Ms Braema and Prof. Ngiam have all\r\n\r\nraised  important issues on the transport needs  for  the\r\n\r\ndisabled.   The  problem of an accessible  transportation\r\n\r\nsystem for persons with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisabilities  is  not  new.  The  NCSS  has  a  Transport\r\n\r\nFinancial  Assistance Scheme to help  needy  people  with\r\n\r\ndisabilities attending approved programmes with MRT,  bus\r\n\r\nand  taxi subsidies.  Taxi subsidies are meant for  those\r\n\r\nwho cannot take public transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voluntary welfare organisations have put two\r\n\r\nother  schemes  in place to help those  who  cannot  take\r\n\r\npublic transport:  there is the contract bus service  for\r\n\r\nthe   ambulant   but   who  need  a   helper,   eg,   the\r\n\r\nintellectually  disabled  and those  with  neuro-muscular\r\n\r\ndisabilities.   The  Adapted  Vehicle  Transport  Service\r\n\r\n(AVTS)  is  for  those  with severe ambulatory  problems,\r\n\r\nmostly the wheelchair bound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCSS spends a total of $1.9 million each year on\r\n\r\nthese transport schemes for the disabled.  Concerned with\r\n\r\nthe high cost of AVTS and the long-term sustainability of\r\n\r\nthe  Transport  Fund, the NCSS formed a Work  Group  with\r\n\r\nrepresentatives from MCDS, MOT and LTA in 2000 to  review\r\n\r\ntransport  options for disabled persons.  The Work  Group\r\n\r\nhas  studied  various  systems  overseas  and  considered\r\n\r\nvarious  models.   It has recommended a  centralised  and\r\n\r\ndedicated  transport  service for the  wheelchair  bound,\r\n\r\nincluding  people with disabilities and the elderly.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry  will review this proposal with the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nTransport.     As  the  Work  Group's  proposal   implies\r\n\r\nconsiderable cost, there is a need to further  study  how\r\n\r\nthe  objectives  can be more efficiently and  effectively\r\n\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we recognise that the responsibility for\r\n\r\ntransportation for the disabled cannot lie with the  NCSS\r\n\r\nalone.  The schemes by the VWOs target their clients  and\r\n\r\nnot   the   general   disabled  or  elderly   population.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  the  NCSS  has  no  expertise  to   develop\r\n\r\nsustainable  transport  solutions  for  the  elderly  and\r\n\r\npeople with disabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be more disabled and elderly persons who\r\n\r\nare  ambulant or semi-ambulant, and who could take public\r\n\r\ntransport on their own or with a companion, only  if  the\r\n\r\npublic transport system\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  disabled-friendly and elder-friendly.  A person  with\r\n\r\npoor  or  very  low vision, for example, needs  voice  or\r\n\r\ntactile aids to find his way around.  I am glad that  the\r\n\r\nMRT  stations, for one, have been progressively made more\r\n\r\naccessible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Members that transport needs and\r\n\r\nsolutions  for  the  disabled and the elderly  should  be\r\n\r\naddressed.  They depend on mass transport services to get\r\n\r\naround,  to work, to socialise, and to study,  just  like\r\n\r\nother  Singaporeans.  My Ministry will continue  to  work\r\n\r\nclosely  with  MOT, LTA and the NCSS  to  look  into  the\r\n\r\ntransport   needs   of  the  various  segments   of   our\r\n\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong has also expressed concern for the\r\n\r\nsupport  given to disabled sportsmen.  I will cover  this\r\n\r\nunder the help for sportsmen in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the point raised by Ms Braema on the need\r\n\r\nfor  a demographic study, I would agree with her that  an\r\n\r\nintegrated  approach  is needed and  we  need  to  better\r\n\r\nunderstand  where the needs are, and where  our  disabled\r\n\r\nare  located.   We  are, at this point in  time,  working\r\n\r\ntogether  with the various Government agencies to  arrive\r\n\r\nat  an  integrated  approach, as  the  example  given  in\r\n\r\nmeeting the transport needs of the disabled.  At the same\r\n\r\ntime,  we  are  also  doing a study  on  the  profile  of\r\n\r\ndisabled  persons,  and  this  will  help  us  better  in\r\n\r\ndevising new policies and programmes to help our disabled\r\n\r\nbetter integrate into society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the care and concern for the disabled, as I\r\n\r\nmentioned, is not just the responsibility of MCDS or  the\r\n\r\nNCSS.   The needs of the disabled are best met  when  all\r\n\r\nrelevant  agencies  and partners  play  their  part.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry,  as  I  said earlier, will work  with  relevant\r\n\r\npartners  in  the public, private and people  sectors  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  services for the disabled and  to  create  an\r\n\r\nenvironment for the disabled to participate in the social\r\n\r\nmainstream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, more people have come for help\r\n\r\nduring  this difficult period.  Over time, some of  these\r\n\r\ncases\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  become \"hard\". These are people who are  unable  to\r\n\r\nfind  jobs  over a prolonged period, and their  financial\r\n\r\nsituations have deteriorated rapidly and deeply.  After a\r\n\r\nprolonged  period of unemployment, the chance of  finding\r\n\r\nwork has become even less.  It is more difficult for them\r\n\r\nto  get  back  to  work.  More help is needed  for  these\r\n\r\npeople.   We need a more focused or targeted approach  so\r\n\r\nthat  assistance can be rendered to the deserving parties\r\n\r\nin a timely manner before the cases become \"hard\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is right that we should help those who are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  help themselves.  But even if they  do  not\r\n\r\nwant to put in the efforts to get themselves out of their\r\n\r\npredicament,  we  still  need  to  assist  their   family\r\n\r\nmembers,  especially the old and the  young.   The  young\r\n\r\nmust  be helped with their education.  Without education,\r\n\r\nthe  young  will go through the same sad path that  their\r\n\r\nparents took.  We will then have a group of chronic poor.\r\n\r\nSome people want to help themselves, but they do not know\r\n\r\nhow  to  help themselves.  What are really their problems\r\n\r\nand  how deep are their problems?  We need people who can\r\n\r\ncounsel  them, especially with regard to their  financial\r\n\r\npositions  and options.  If they do not understand  their\r\n\r\nproblems  or how deep are their problems, they  are  less\r\n\r\nable  to  find  a  way  out.  It is very  frustrating  to\r\n\r\nprovide  help  on a piecemeal basis.  They come  in  with\r\n\r\ntheir  utilities supply problem one evening, the  service\r\n\r\nand  conservancy  charges next, and you  think  you  have\r\n\r\nhelped  them  solve their problems.  And they  come  back\r\n\r\nwith  their  school fees problem, and then they  ask  for\r\n\r\njobs.  Then this problem cycle starts again from the very\r\n\r\nbeginning.  It is very sad and frustrating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore would like to ask the Minister to review\r\n\r\nthe  help  that is now available to help people  who  are\r\n\r\ngenuinely  in need.  Is the help provided adequate?   Are\r\n\r\nthe  resources available adequate?  Can we  also  provide\r\n\r\nfinancial counselling to those in need of help,  so  that\r\n\r\nthey can have a holistic picture of their problems?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Sir, with the Iraq war\r\n\r\non  now  and due to Singapore's open economy,  many  more\r\n\r\npeople\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1807</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay be affected by the economic situation, either due  to\r\n\r\nreduced  income or loss of job.  I would like to  commend\r\n\r\nMCDS for the many financial and social assistance schemes\r\n\r\nthat  they  introduced to help the lower income  families\r\n\r\nand  families  that are affected by the downturn  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two concerns on disabled children. However,\r\n\r\nthis has been answered by the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share Mr Chandra Mohan's concern on the mentally\r\n\r\ndisabled.  In view of this downturn in the economy,  many\r\n\r\nare  very  stressed with their financial  and  employment\r\n\r\nsituation.  Many may have some kind of mental illness but\r\n\r\nthey are, however, not serious enough to be warded in the\r\n\r\nhospital,  and  they  do not have  the  necessary  family\r\n\r\nsupport.   I have just one question.  Is MCDS considering\r\n\r\nsetting  up  step-down facilities and daily care  service\r\n\r\nwhich   would  be  of  great  help  for  such   families,\r\n\r\nespecially  when  the  breadwinner is  affected  and  the\r\n\r\nspouse needs to find alternative employment to supplement\r\n\r\nthe family income?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the many social and financial assistance\r\n\r\nschemes  initiated by MCDS and CDCs, would  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nconsider  streamlining all these schemes and ensure  that\r\n\r\nthey  are better coordinated with CDCs as a one-stop help\r\n\r\ncentre?   This is in line with Dr Tan's appeal.  Just  to\r\n\r\ngive  Members an example.  A family in need of  financial\r\n\r\nhelp to send their children to childcare and student care\r\n\r\ncentres  will need to understand at least five  financial\r\n\r\nschemes  before  she  can apply  -  the  Flexi  Childcare\r\n\r\nScheme,  the  Government childcare subsidy,  the  Centre-based  Financial Assistance Scheme, the Baby Bonus Scheme\r\n\r\nwhere  they  can  use  the money  to  pay  even  for  the\r\n\r\nchildcare   service,  and  Student  Care  Fee  Assistance\r\n\r\nScheme.    Most   of  these  schemes  have   very   minor\r\n\r\ndifferences.   So  could the Ministry  please  look  into\r\n\r\nthat?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Sir, with the downturn\r\n\r\nin  the economy, there are two groups of children whom  I\r\n\r\nwould  be  very  much concerned about.  The  first  group\r\n\r\nwould  be  the children from poor families who have  been\r\n\r\npreviously poor.  Many of these families are large,  they\r\n\r\nhave  had low incomes and they have been in the cycle  of\r\n\r\npoverty with very little support.  MCDS has done much for\r\n\r\nthis group, but much more needs to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other group really would be the ones who might\r\n\r\nbe  newly  poor,  or newly in need, because  the  parents\r\n\r\npreviously having been able to look after the family  are\r\n\r\nnow  in  financial  difficulties,  as  a  result  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn.   Some of these  children  and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies  have  been unwilling to come forward  for  help\r\n\r\nbecause  of embarrassment.  Others are in great need  but\r\n\r\nare  still  in  the  process  of  making  their  relevant\r\n\r\nadjustments  to their family lifestyle.   Some  of  these\r\n\r\nchildren  actually  are  in the  kindergarten  age  group\r\n\r\nwhere,  I believe, there is a list of help available,  in\r\n\r\nterms  of being unable to pay for children's kindergarten\r\n\r\nfees.   But  the long-term impact on the kindergartens  - although it is not compulsory education - would  be  very\r\n\r\nimportant, in terms of giving these children a head-start\r\n\r\nin the education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What plan does MCDS have to address this problem?\r\n\r\nThese children are our future.  I hope that MCDS would be\r\n\r\nable to come up with some schemes, maybe for the next few\r\n\r\nyears at least, to address their needs.  In particular, I\r\n\r\nwant to bring forth the plight of those children who come\r\n\r\nfrom  families who have actually heeded the nation's call\r\n\r\n\"to  have  three  or more, if you can  afford  it\";   and\r\n\r\nsometimes,  there  is  a fourth  child.   Some  of  these\r\n\r\nchildren  will not enjoy many of the subsidies  available\r\n\r\nto  the  first and the second child.  Families  may  have\r\n\r\nactually  thought  that they could afford  looking  after\r\n\r\nthese  children, two or five years ago.  But  because  of\r\n\r\nthe  downturn, they may be in trouble.  Can we find  ways\r\n\r\nto help them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Sir, the National Council\r\n\r\nof Social Service has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompiled  a very comprehensive list of all the assistance\r\n\r\nschemes   that   are  available  under  this   assistance\r\n\r\nprogramme,  and they update it monthly.  Looking  at  all\r\n\r\nthe  schemes that are on the website, just as an example,\r\n\r\nunder financial assistance, there are already 33 schemes;\r\n\r\nhelp  to pay bills, etc, there are 12 schemes; assistance\r\n\r\nfor  training opportunities, there are 29; on  education,\r\n\r\nthere  are 49; childcare, there are 6.  The point that  I\r\n\r\nam  driving  at is that there are plenty of  schemes  out\r\n\r\nthere,  and  I  share  Mdm Cynthia Phua's  and  Dr  Tan's\r\n\r\nviewpoints too, that it is difficult for a lay person  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  schemes.  The schemes are  difficult  to\r\n\r\nadminister where form filling, checking of document, etc,\r\n\r\nare concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the other point which I am concerned about is\r\n\r\nthe  criteria  schemes that are used  under  the  various\r\n\r\nassistance  programmes.  For example, the CCC  short-term\r\n\r\nfinancial aid programme gives money ranging from  $50  to\r\n\r\n$300  for families in distress.  Under the PA, it is $230\r\n\r\nto  $670 for different criteria schemes.  So, at the  end\r\n\r\nof  it all, we have just one example, ie, from April 2001\r\n\r\nto  March  2002, $6 million has been given out  to  5,300\r\n\r\npeople  under  the public assistance scheme.   When  much\r\n\r\nmoney  is going out to many different people who  are  in\r\n\r\nneed, we need to ride by them.  When we have this complex\r\n\r\nstructure  of  different schemes, it  is  also  important\r\n\r\nthat,  like  what  Mdm Cynthia Phua has said,  we  should\r\n\r\nstreamline them, and relook the criteria schemes that  we\r\n\r\nare using under various schemes.  Maybe the means testing\r\n\r\nwill be a solution here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, there is also too much of hopping where\r\n\r\nrecipients  are  concerned, and that  can  be  a  problem\r\n\r\nbecause we might overlook someone who is really in  need,\r\n\r\nbecause there is usually a quota too on how much aid  one\r\n\r\ncan give.  Therefore, I ask for a review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Sin\r\n\r\nBoon  Ann and Dr Tan Boon Wan for raising concerns  about\r\n\r\nthe  poor  and  needy families who may have  fallen  into\r\n\r\nfinancial difficulties due to economic restructuring.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve Dr Warren Lee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand Mdm Cynthia Phua have also raised the same concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, our CDCs have seen more applications for\r\n\r\nshort-term assistance in the past year.  For example, the\r\n\r\nnumber   of   applications  for  the  Interim   Financial\r\n\r\nAssistance  Scheme (IFAS) doubled from 5,501 in  2001  to\r\n\r\n11,291  in  2002 over the same nine-month period  (April-December) in 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry is committed to helping those most\r\n\r\nin  need.   We  will  work with the community  and  other\r\n\r\npartners  to ensure that the social safety net meets  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the  poor and the under-educated,  those  most\r\n\r\nvulnerable  to  economic restructuring.  Every  case  for\r\n\r\nassistance will thus be assessed on its merits and needs.\r\n\r\nSocial  assistance officers have the flexibility to  help\r\n\r\ncases   at   the  margins.   The  help  will   be   given\r\n\r\nholistically.    Poorer   families   with    school-going\r\n\r\nchildren,  for  example, may be referred  to  the  School\r\n\r\nPocket  Money Fund for help or to the schools for  school\r\n\r\nfee  assistance.   My  Ministry also  provides  financial\r\n\r\nassistance for student care services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But social assistance is only a temporary relief.\r\n\r\nWork  is still the best form of welfare.  It is not  good\r\n\r\nfor  a person to remain unemployed for too long.  He will\r\n\r\nfind  it  harder to get back to work and lose self-esteem\r\n\r\nand  respect.  Thus, apart from financial assistance,  we\r\n\r\nhelp  best if we can help the individual get quickly back\r\n\r\nto work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Sir, I announced that we would link short-term financial assistance to training, re-skilling, and\r\n\r\njob  placement  schemes.  My Ministry is working  closely\r\n\r\nwith  the  Ministry of Manpower and CDCs to  ensure  that\r\n\r\neach  client  is able to get back to work as  quickly  as\r\n\r\npossible  by  linking  the Interim  Financial  Assistance\r\n\r\nScheme (IFAS) recipients to job assistance services under\r\n\r\nthe  Distributed Career Link Network for the  unemployed.\r\n\r\nThe  principle of self-help is an important  one.   Those\r\n\r\nable  to  work  will be given the IFAS grants  for  three\r\n\r\nmonths initially, but will be required to show job search\r\n\r\nefforts or go for training.  Those who are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1811</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreally  unable to find a job after three months,  despite\r\n\r\nsincere  effort,  will be given IFAS grants  for  another\r\n\r\nthree  months, so six months in all.  During  this  time,\r\n\r\nthe  CDCs  will do their best to help the person  find  a\r\n\r\njob.   The assistance is not indefinite, so those on  the\r\n\r\nIFAS-job link need to make use of the opportunity to land\r\n\r\na  job  during  the  time they are on the  scheme.   Many\r\n\r\nolder,  less  skilled and low educated workers  who  have\r\n\r\nlost  their jobs will need more help making a  switch  to\r\n\r\njobs  different from what they have been used  to.   They\r\n\r\nwill  be given job counselling to help them face the  new\r\n\r\nrealities and find new jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to report that the work ethic is\r\n\r\nalive  and  well.   Yes,  needy Singaporeans  are  coming\r\n\r\nforward for help, but they do want to get back to work as\r\n\r\nsoon   as  they  can  and  not  depend  indefinitely   on\r\n\r\nGovernment  handouts. According to CDCs,  from  April  to\r\n\r\nDecember  2002, 97% of IFAS cases were on assistance  for\r\n\r\nsix months or less.  88% were on IFAS for three months or\r\n\r\nless.   Most  of the cases who were taken off  IFAS  were\r\n\r\nable   to   find   work   and  regain   their   financial\r\n\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members an example of someone who was on\r\n\r\nsocial  assistance, but has adjusted his job expectations\r\n\r\nand  is  now  self-reliant.   He  deserves  our  respect,\r\n\r\nbecause  he  had the will to accept a new job,  albeit  a\r\n\r\nlower  paying one, and get back on his own feet.  He  has\r\n\r\ndisplayed the kind of resilience that I spoke on earlier.\r\n\r\nThis  is a case of a 51-year-old man who was jobless  for\r\n\r\nseven  months.  He has three school-going  children.   He\r\n\r\nused to have a white-collar job as a storekeeper.  As  he\r\n\r\nsuffered from poor vision and could not spend long  hours\r\n\r\nin  front of his computer, he had to leave his job.   The\r\n\r\nfamily made adjustments.  His wife worked as a babysitter\r\n\r\nto support the family.  The CDC helped him with grants on\r\n\r\nthe  Interim Financial Assistance Scheme for  six  months\r\n\r\nwhile assisting him with job matching.  He was also given\r\n\r\none-off  assistance  of $150 to buy school  uniforms  and\r\n\r\nbooks for his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1812</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren.   When CDC offered him a cleaner  position,  he\r\n\r\naccepted the job even though it meant a major job  switch\r\n\r\nand lower pay.  This is clearly an example of someone who\r\n\r\nfaced   reality  and  was  willing  to  adjust  his   job\r\n\r\nexpectations because he saw the need to get back into the\r\n\r\ngame.  The family took hard knocks, but they are on their\r\n\r\nown feet again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to assure Mr Sin Boon Ann and Dr\r\n\r\nTan  that my Ministry will continue to review the  social\r\n\r\nsafety  net  with  partners,  such  as  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower  and CDCs, so that the genuinely needy  get  the\r\n\r\nhelp   they  need.  The  Government's  social  assistance\r\n\r\nschemes have not shrunk; in fact, the schemes are revised\r\n\r\nregularly  and in the past few years, these reviews  were\r\n\r\nbrought   forward   to  respond  to   the   fast-changing\r\n\r\nenvironment   and  circumstances  on  the  ground.    For\r\n\r\nexample,  my  Ministry  enhanced  the  Interim  Financial\r\n\r\nAssistance Scheme at the end of 2001 to help families  in\r\n\r\npurchased  flats with difficulties paying their utilities\r\n\r\nbills.  In January this year, the Public Assistance rates\r\n\r\nwere revised between 13% and 23%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These schemes are augmented by other programmes and\r\n\r\nschemes  run  by the community.  Families  in  need,  for\r\n\r\nexample, can seek help from their Family Service  Centres\r\n\r\n(FSCs)   for  counselling,  including  help  with  budget\r\n\r\nplanning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry shares the concern raised by Dr\r\n\r\nWarren  Lee concerning children from low-income families,\r\n\r\nand  I  take the point also surfaced by Mdm Cynthia Phua.\r\n\r\nLet  me  just  elaborate on the programme  that  we  have\r\n\r\nstarted in order to help low-income families to give them\r\n\r\na headstart in school.  Last year, we introduced an early\r\n\r\nintervention programme called \"Healthy Start\" for  babies\r\n\r\nand  young children from families `at risk'.   Five  FSCs\r\n\r\nnow  deliver  this  programme for  families-at-risk  with\r\n\r\nnewborn  children.  Another two are in the  middle  of  a\r\n\r\npilot programme that reaches out to older children from 2-6 years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For children from families earning $1,500 or less,\r\n\r\nthe Centre-based Financial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssistance  Scheme  tops  up  the  Government   childcare\r\n\r\nsubsidies.  The rates were raised in January this year so\r\n\r\nthat for the very low income, the Government co-pays some\r\n\r\n95%  of  the  average childcare fee at a VWO-run  centre.\r\n\r\nThere  were  1,234 children on the Scheme at the  end  of\r\n\r\nlast  year.  Children from Public Assistance and  Special\r\n\r\nGrant  families receive free childcare and we will ensure\r\n\r\nthat  cases on the Healthy Start, RUAS (which is the Rent\r\n\r\nand  Utilities Assistance Scheme) and the Small  Families\r\n\r\nImprovement  Scheme can afford to make  their  co-payment\r\n\r\nquantum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these, as mentioned earlier, the Student\r\n\r\nCare  Fee  Assistance Scheme supports  children  in  non-profit  Student Care Centres with subsidies up  to  $150.\r\n\r\nFamilies  earning below $2,500 are eligible  but  orphans\r\n\r\nand  children from families in difficulties,  such  as  a\r\n\r\nparent being imprisoned, or having mental incapacity will\r\n\r\nalso  be considered.  The CDCs and VWOs may also consider\r\n\r\nhelping families more with their co-payment when this  is\r\n\r\nwarranted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can empathise with families that had coped\r\n\r\nwell  before  and  who may now feel awkward  tapping  the\r\n\r\nschemes.  Some may prefer to withdraw their children from\r\n\r\nchildcare  or  student care because they  can  no  longer\r\n\r\nafford  the  fees.  They should apply for  help.   May  I\r\n\r\nassure  Members that the VWOs and the CDCs will  preserve\r\n\r\nthe   confidentiality  of  all  applications   for   such\r\n\r\nassistance schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people who need the schemes we offer may need\r\n\r\nto  know  about  their benefits.  My Ministry  will  give\r\n\r\nwider  publicity  to our schemes.  We will  also  partner\r\n\r\nwith  VWOs  and self-help groups, who know their  clients\r\n\r\nwell,  to draw up suitable Family Life Education packages\r\n\r\nto help low-income families acquire coping skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Ms Braema Mathiaparanam, Mdm Cynthia Phua and\r\n\r\neven Dr Warren Lee have raised some concerns about the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmultitude and plethora of schemes which are available.  I\r\n\r\nam  not  sure about the number of schemes that Ms  Braema\r\n\r\nhas  mentioned that is available on the NCSS website, but\r\n\r\nI  am  sure these schemes are there to inform.   I  would\r\n\r\nassure Members that we would look into all our schemes to\r\n\r\nensure that some form of streamlining takes place. At the\r\n\r\nsame  time, Sir, I would like to assure Members that  any\r\n\r\none  who needs any help can go down to the Family Service\r\n\r\nCentres  or the CDCs, and there will be people  there  to\r\n\r\nassist  them  to  navigate and  guide  them  through  the\r\n\r\nvarious schemes which are available, those schemes  which\r\n\r\nthey are entitled to, and how they could apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus far, Sir, we have not received any major\r\n\r\ncomplaints  from  our  partners in implementing  some  of\r\n\r\nthese schemes.  But, I would like to assure Members  that\r\n\r\nwe  would look into some of the difficulties that Members\r\n\r\nmay  have come across, and we would study how these could\r\n\r\nbe remedied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final point I want to make, which Ms Braema\r\n\r\nhas  raised,  is  the problem of hopping or  shopping  by\r\n\r\nvarious  client  groups.   This is  an  inevitable  fact,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is very difficult for us to ensure  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  one  global  system.  But let me  assure  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  that  if the family enters the FSC,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nsystem  that is in place where we can help the family  to\r\n\r\nnavigate  all  the possible options and ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nfamily  is  helped.   As  in the  example  I  have  given\r\n\r\nearlier,  ie,  the  IFAS scheme, we  not  only  help  the\r\n\r\nbreadwinner  to  gain employment, but we  also  help  the\r\n\r\nfamily  in  terms  of  school needs and  the  payment  of\r\n\r\nutilities,  and whatever assistance that they  need.   In\r\n\r\nthat  manner,  we  can ensure that there  is  a  holistic\r\n\r\napproach towards helping those who are in need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have addressed most of the concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, in order to upgrade the\r\n\r\nsocial service sector, MCDS, in July 2002, increased  the\r\n\r\nrecurrent funding of programmes run by voluntary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwelfare  organisations  by about $7  million  each  year.\r\n\r\nVWOs  also  depend  on public support, donors  and  well-wishers  for  support.

No matter how much we think the needs\r\n\r\nare,  when  it actually comes to absolute numbers,  these\r\n\r\nnumbers  are  relatively small, and  training  may  be  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit difficult to fund locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does MCDS have schemes in place for working towards\r\n\r\ngreater numbers of people who have specialised skills for\r\n\r\nthe  management of the elderly?  At the same time,  I  am\r\n\r\nheartened  by  the  various schemes that  have  been  put\r\n\r\nforward  regarding  the retraining of  older  workers  as\r\n\r\nhealthcare  workers, and as just aides to help  with  the\r\n\r\nmobility  and  feeding of the elderly.  I  think  schemes\r\n\r\nlike  these are very good, but I would also like  to  see\r\n\r\nwhether  there  is  actually  provision  for  specialised\r\n\r\nmanpower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Sir, just a clarification\r\n\r\non  the  earlier cut.

It is just that the criteria scheme is a maze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is right now regarded as an advanced\r\n\r\nsociety  and I think our needs are getting more  complex.\r\n\r\nWe have, on the one hand, people who still need financial\r\n\r\naid  on a daily or monthly basis so that they can get  on\r\n\r\nwith  their lives; and on the other extreme, we also have\r\n\r\npeople   who  need  help  dealing  with  burn-outs,   eg,\r\n\r\nrelationships  in  the  office,  home,  school,   and   a\r\n\r\nmultitude of services have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncropped  up  in recent years to try to help  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ndeal  with  both spectrums and those who  are  caught  in\r\n\r\nbetween.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am raising here is that, as already mentioned\r\n\r\nby the Minister, a lot of services have cropped up.  This\r\n\r\nis  wonderful because people are taking the ownership and\r\n\r\ndifferent  organisations are coming  into  the  scene  to\r\n\r\nbuild  up services for the people in Singapore.  However,\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to ask the Ministry on its role  when  it\r\n\r\ncomes  to the following areas, so that what is given  has\r\n\r\ngot a certain kind of consistency with it:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The quality of training with which these people\r\n\r\nwho  are dealing in direct services have.  I have  raised\r\n\r\nthat before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The duplication of services - when cooperative\r\n\r\nmodels  might work better, where economies of  scale  are\r\n\r\nalso  concerned, who governs, who sets up what  services,\r\n\r\nand in what areas, etc?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In the whole concept, which the Minister has\r\n\r\nalready mentioned, ie, social entrepreneurship, how do we\r\n\r\nexcite  an  organisation to go further perhaps  with  its\r\n\r\nproject,  such  that we can have sustenance  as  well  as\r\n\r\nindependent programmes coming through their initiatives?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The very delicate positioning between VWOs and\r\n\r\nCDCs  is  such  that the ownership of VWOs does  not  get\r\n\r\nsubsumed  under  CDC activities, so that the  cooperative\r\n\r\nmodel  can  take  place and both parties  work  in  happy\r\n\r\ntandem; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The different demands placed on the charity\r\n\r\ndollar by different organisations.

There  may  be\r\n\r\nvarious reasons that can explain this rise in demand.  In\r\n\r\na  career  talk  on  the  social service  sector  that  I\r\n\r\nconducted not too long ago, I was impressed by the number\r\n\r\nof  people who are looking for second careers.  Some  are\r\n\r\nlawyers  and businessmen, and one a banker.   People  are\r\n\r\nmore aware of the range of services available as well  as\r\n\r\nthe  growing diversity of needs, and also their interest.\r\n\r\nThis  is hardly surprising, as the social service  sector\r\n\r\nprovides  very  many intangible benefits and  significant\r\n\r\nrewarding experiences to its members as they help  others\r\n\r\nto enrich their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, commensurate with this growing interest in the\r\n\r\nsocial  services,  there seems to be a  proliferation  of\r\n\r\ntraining  courses  run by different organisations.   This\r\n\r\ncertainly provides opportunities for people to  get  into\r\n\r\nthis sector.  Their duration ranges from a couple of days\r\n\r\nto  a  couple of years, some using the same title though,\r\n\r\neg,  counselling,  family  therapy,  psychotherapy,  etc.\r\n\r\nMany  who  are  graduates of these  courses  happily  and\r\n\r\nproudly   identify  themselves  as  counsellors,   family\r\n\r\ntherapists,  and  some as psychotherapists.   They  offer\r\n\r\ntheir services to people who meet them, and the demand is\r\n\r\nrising, given the very stressful lives that we lead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, dealing with human lives and emotions is not a\r\n\r\nsimple matter.  It is complex and requires, among others,\r\n\r\nthe   person's  proficiency,  maturity  and,  of  course,\r\n\r\ncompetency  in  the  area  of  practice.   Thus,  it   is\r\n\r\nimperative that certification of such courses is  checked\r\n\r\nand    accredited.    Who   is   responsible   for   such\r\n\r\naccreditation processes?  Who is ensuring the  standards?\r\n\r\nAs  the  sector  is so diverse, what are MCDS'  plans  to\r\n\r\nensure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  standards and the supply of professionals  into  the\r\n\r\ndifferent   sectors?     Who   is   to   determine   what\r\n\r\nqualifications allow one to practise in what aspects?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from ensuring that the proper mechanisms\r\n\r\nare  in  place to ensure the close monitoring and control\r\n\r\nover  the sector, we should also ensure that Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare  given adequate information and knowledge to  discern\r\n\r\nbetween    the    qualified   and    the    non-qualified\r\n\r\npractitioners.   To many, a counsellor is  a  counsellor.\r\n\r\nAs  long as you have a good heart, you can listen  to  my\r\n\r\nproblems,  you  call yourself a counsellor,  you  have  a\r\n\r\npaper  that hangs on your wall to support it, I am  okay.\r\n\r\nIs  there  any  avenue  for  Singaporeans  to  check  the\r\n\r\nauthenticity of such qualifications?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask the Minister what\r\n\r\nproportion  of  our social service sector  personnel  are\r\n\r\nEmployment Pass holders?  In this regard, who ensures and\r\n\r\nmonitors that the qualifications that they bring  in  are\r\n\r\naccredited accordingly?  This is important, as  they  may\r\n\r\ncome  from  cultures that are different  from  ours,  and\r\n\r\ntheir intervention may cause more harm than good to their\r\n\r\nservice users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many people have said that there is an inverse\r\n\r\nrelationship between the economic downturn and the growth\r\n\r\nof  the social service sector, as more people need  those\r\n\r\nservices.  Let us ensure that the numbers do not increase\r\n\r\nbecause  of incompetent practitioners who enter  when  we\r\n\r\nare not keeping watch on the gate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

To\r\n\r\ndeliver   good   programmes  and  use   their   resources\r\n\r\neffectively, VWOs must practise effective governance  and\r\n\r\nmanagement.   The  National  Council  of  Social  Service\r\n\r\n(NCSS)  has  conducted workshops on board governance  for\r\n\r\nover  200  VWO  Board  members,  and  has  also  provided\r\n\r\nconsultancy  to  several VWOs.  VWOs can also  apply  for\r\n\r\ntraining and consultancy grants from the $30 million  VWO\r\n\r\nCapability  Fund  to  upgrade their  internal  management\r\n\r\ncapabilities.  To expand on current efforts, NCSS intends\r\n\r\nto  roll  out a Code of Governance for the VWOs  in  June\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Code covers important areas, such as resource\r\n\r\nmanagement  and  evaluation  of  outcomes,  conflict   of\r\n\r\ninterest,  financial  management  and  fund-raising,   to\r\n\r\nachieve    high    standards    of    transparency    and\r\n\r\naccountability.  The NCSS is in the process of consulting\r\n\r\nthe  VWOs to improve the Code.

So, I\r\n\r\nam  glad that Dr Maliki has been giving talks to bankers,\r\n\r\nlawyers and engineers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Putting in place a comprehensive training\r\n\r\nframework.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Addressing issues of attraction and retention\r\n\r\nof personnel in the sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to elaborate on these three\r\n\r\nstrategies.    We   have   created   opportunities    for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  take  up jobs  in  the  social  service\r\n\r\nsector.    The  recently  introduced  Strategic  Manpower\r\n\r\nConversion   Programme   now  makes   it   possible   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to make a career switch into the  sector  by\r\n\r\nbeing   trained   as  social  workers  or   social   work\r\n\r\nassistants.   By  2006,  we  expect  some  150  graduands\r\n\r\nthrough this programme; some 90 will be trained as social\r\n\r\nwork   assistants  via  a  Specialist  Diploma  in  Human\r\n\r\nServices,  and  about 60 will qualify  as  fully  trained\r\n\r\nsocial  workers via the Graduate Diploma in Social  Work.\r\n\r\nThis will relieve the shortage of trained social workers,\r\n\r\ngiven  that  only about half of the 120 NUS graduates  in\r\n\r\nsocial  work actually enter the field every year.   Other\r\n\r\nthan    social   workers   and   assistants,   we    will\r\n\r\nsystematically bring other critical social  service  jobs\r\n\r\nunder the ambit of the Manpower Conversion Programme,  so\r\n\r\nthat  mid-career people can be trained for jobs in social\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we started another scheme, \"Training for\r\n\r\nEmployment in the Social Services\" (or TESS) in  December\r\n\r\nlast  year aimed at workers with secondary education  and\r\n\r\nbelow,  particularly  older  Singaporeans  who  may  face\r\n\r\nstructural unemployment. Generous subsidies now  make  it\r\n\r\nattractive  for VWOs to recruit and send older  and  less\r\n\r\neducated   Singaporeans  for  training.    The   training\r\n\r\ncurrently   covers  therapy  aides,  nursing  aides   and\r\n\r\nhealthcare attendants.  The first batch of 32 people  has\r\n\r\nbeen  trained and will be starting work in the  VWOs.  We\r\n\r\nhope  to have trained at least 450 persons by 2006, under\r\n\r\nthe six  certificate programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to announce that with MCDS support, the\r\n\r\nNational  Council of Social Service will set up a  Social\r\n\r\nService  Training Institute in April  2003.   This  is  a\r\n\r\nmajor  milestone in the development of the social service\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institute will ensure that the training needs of\r\n\r\nall personnel in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsocial  service  sector, from social workers,  management\r\n\r\nstaff,   therapists,   counsellors,   special   education\r\n\r\nteachers,  social  work  assistants  to  social   service\r\n\r\nvolunteers  are systematically addressed.  Such  training\r\n\r\nwill  help  upgrade the quality of services and personnel\r\n\r\nin the social service sector, as well as allow mid-career\r\n\r\npeople to be trained to take up jobs in the sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Social Service Training Institute will run a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  119  courses in its first year  of  operation,\r\n\r\nenabling  some  768  staff from  the  sector  to  undergo\r\n\r\nprofessional training.  So the concern of Dr Maliki about\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of social workers or people in  the  social\r\n\r\nservice  sector  could be addressed if they  undergo  the\r\n\r\ntraining  programme.  Leadership and management  training\r\n\r\nfor  executive directors and senior managers of voluntary\r\n\r\nwelfare  organisations will be another key training  area\r\n\r\nthat   the  Institute  will  be  driving  together   with\r\n\r\naccredited institutions of higher learning, such  as  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Management University.  Course  fees  will  be\r\n\r\naffordable.   VWOs will also be able to tap  on  the  VWO\r\n\r\nCapability  Fund which will subsidise up to  70%  of  the\r\n\r\ncourse fee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As highlighted by Ms Braema Mathiaparanam, there is\r\n\r\na   need  to  develop  specialists  in  the  sector.  The\r\n\r\nInstitute will organise specialist training in areas such\r\n\r\nas  elderly, youth and family services.  My Ministry  and\r\n\r\nthe   National  Council  of  Social  Service  also  offer\r\n\r\nspecialist  scholarships  ranging  from  Social  Work  to\r\n\r\nGerontology Counselling and Disability Studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki asked about the accreditation process and\r\n\r\nwho  would  ensure the standards of training provided  to\r\n\r\nsocial  service  professionals.   As  Dr  Maliki  already\r\n\r\nknows,  professionals in the social service sector,  such\r\n\r\nas  social  workers,  psychologists and  therapists,  are\r\n\r\ngenerally required to have a minimum undergraduate degree\r\n\r\nin  their respective field.  The Ministry is of the  view\r\n\r\nthat  it is for the industry or professional associations\r\n\r\nto regulate themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Social Service Training Institute, in\r\n\r\nconsultation  with the relevant professional institutions\r\n\r\nand the industry, will,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhowever,  look  into the standards of  training  for  all\r\n\r\nlevels of jobs in the social service sector. It will also\r\n\r\nensure  that  courses  run  by the  Institute's  partners\r\n\r\nadequately  equip  trainees for the  job.   For  example,\r\n\r\nnursing  aides,  health  attendants  and  therapy   aides\r\n\r\ncurrently  undergo a formal full-time training  programme\r\n\r\nranging  from  one to six months. The training  providers\r\n\r\nand the Institute will jointly certify these courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large group of personnel in the social\r\n\r\nservice sector today, who did not have the opportunity or\r\n\r\nlack  the  necessary  qualifications  to  undergo  formal\r\n\r\ntraining.  My Ministry will reach out to them with  \"bite-size\"  practical  training at the workplace  through  the\r\n\r\nNational Skills Recognition System.  The eldercare sector\r\n\r\nwill  be  the first in the community-based social service\r\n\r\nsector  where  such modular training programmes  will  be\r\n\r\ndeveloped and certified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Government-funded services, my\r\n\r\nMinistry   is   working   on  specifying   the   relevant\r\n\r\nprofessional  competencies  which  must  be  met  by  the\r\n\r\nservice  providers.  For example, counsellors  at  Family\r\n\r\nService  Centres  who  provide counselling  services  are\r\n\r\nexpected  to possess a Diploma in Counselling in addition\r\n\r\nto a Bachelor Degree in Social Work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A perennial issue facing VWOs is how to attract and\r\n\r\nretain  good  staff.  Our efforts to professionalise  the\r\n\r\nsector  through formal and accredited training will  help\r\n\r\nattract Singaporeans to make a career in this sector.  It\r\n\r\nis  also  necessary  to have adequate  remuneration.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry,  together  with  NCSS,  recently  reviewed  VWO\r\n\r\nfunding and we intend to conduct regular reviews, so that\r\n\r\nVWOs  can  pay  appropriate remuneration to their  staff.\r\n\r\nMembers  may  recall that in July last year, my  Ministry\r\n\r\nincreased funding to the VWOs by an average of 17%, or $7\r\n\r\nmillion per year.  My Ministry is also working with  NCSS\r\n\r\nto  find  ways to reduce attrition in the sector  due  to\r\n\r\nfactors   such  as  burn-out.   To  this  end,  the   VWO\r\n\r\nleadership  and  management staff are being  educated  on\r\n\r\ngood HR practices and work-life strategies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last but not least, my Ministry will be\r\n\r\nlaunching  a public education programme to introduce  the\r\n\r\nsocial   service  sector  and  career  opportunities   to\r\n\r\nstudents  and  people contemplating a mid-career  change.\r\n\r\nThis would help Singaporeans better understand the sector\r\n\r\nand the various rewarding careers in the social services.\r\n\r\nWe  also want to correct the wrong impression that social\r\n\r\nworkers are volunteers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Ngiam has also asked how my Ministry plans to\r\n\r\nensure  professional service standards of social services\r\n\r\nin  the  light  of higher expectations in the  community.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  believe Ms Braema has also raised the same  issue\r\n\r\nwith respect to the quality of training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a key factor is the competence and\r\n\r\nprofessionalism  of  the staff.   I have  already  talked\r\n\r\nabout  the efforts of MCDS and NCSS and the role  of  the\r\n\r\nSocial  Service Training Institute in ensuring  competent\r\n\r\nmanpower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and above these efforts, we will be requiring\r\n\r\nVWOs, which deliver services funded by MCDS and NCSS,  to\r\n\r\nmeet    specified   requirements,   including    relevant\r\n\r\nprofessional standards.  MCDS and NCSS have also  put  in\r\n\r\nplace a Programme Evaluation System (PES) that all funded\r\n\r\nVWOs  have to comply with and report on.  This  helps  us\r\n\r\nensure  that  social service programmes are relevant  and\r\n\r\neffective,  carried  out  appropriately  and   meet   the\r\n\r\nrequired professional standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of services provided by various\r\n\r\ncommunity and religious groups with their own funds,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  encourages them to use programme evaluation  to\r\n\r\nascertain  whether they are meeting their own  objectives\r\n\r\nand  to use consultancy services offered by the NCSS,  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  their standards. Ultimately, their  funders  and\r\n\r\nstakeholders  would have to be satisfied  that  they  are\r\n\r\ndoing a good job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NCSS has also issued the Best Practice\r\n\r\nGuidelines which cover\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nareas  such  as  good  management  and  service  delivery\r\n\r\nprocesses,  for example, in the areas of human  resource,\r\n\r\nfinancial management, fund raising, and case management.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me address some of issues raised by Ms\r\n\r\nBraema  first.   She  spoke  about  the  duplication   of\r\n\r\nservices and who is supposed to determine to set up  what\r\n\r\nservice.  I would like to assure her that there is  close\r\n\r\ncoordination  between MCDS, NCSS and the  CDCs  where  we\r\n\r\nbasically do an overall planning in some of the  services\r\n\r\nwhich  are key to the community, to ensure that there  is\r\n\r\nminimal duplication to services like Student Care Centres\r\n\r\nand  Family Service Centres.   But I can understand  that\r\n\r\nas  emerging needs are coming up, there will always be  a\r\n\r\nneed  for us to review these on a regular basis, and this\r\n\r\nis  something that is being done constantly between MCDS,\r\n\r\nNCSS and CDCs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with her that we should excite the VWOs to\r\n\r\nengage in social entrepreneurship.  I will be most  happy\r\n\r\nto  listen to any ideas that she may have on how  we  can\r\n\r\nencourage  more  of the VWOs to find,  for  the  lack  of\r\n\r\nbetter words, \"new revenue streams\" from within their own\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of balance between the VWOs and\r\n\r\nCDCs,  I  would like to assure her that the CDCs  do  not\r\n\r\nprovide  services. The services are provided through  the\r\n\r\nVWOs.   For  example, Family Service Centres are  run  by\r\n\r\nVWOs,  but  they  are linked up with  the  CDCs  for  the\r\n\r\npurposes of referral and, in a sense, case management, to\r\n\r\nensure that holistic help is being given to the family in\r\n\r\nneed.   I  would  like to assure her  that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nattempt on the part of the CDCs to take over the role  of\r\n\r\nthe  VWOs.  But if there is an instance that she has come\r\n\r\nacross,  we will be most happy to address that,  together\r\n\r\nwith  the Mayors involved to see if there is any form  of\r\n\r\noverlapping between the CDCs and the VWOs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on her point about the different\r\n\r\ndemands  on the charity dollar, I think this is something\r\n\r\nthat we have to address on a continuous basis.  I spoke\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nearlier about trying to promote more philanthropy so that\r\n\r\nwe  have more people who can come forward.  Yet,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  as I have said earlier, we need to  be  more\r\n\r\nstrategic in the way we address this issue.  To bring  in\r\n\r\nnew  philanthropists into the system, we have to be  able\r\n\r\nto  give them a stake in the programme, as in the example\r\n\r\nthat  I  have given on the Robin Hood Foundation.   I  am\r\n\r\nsure  we can find some creative means to bring a lot more\r\n\r\npeople into the sector by engaging them, not just only as\r\n\r\ndonors, but also as partners in the programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki has raised a particular question about the\r\n\r\nnumber  of employment pass holders who are on the  social\r\n\r\nservice sector.  I do not have the numbers but I will  be\r\n\r\nmost  happy to provide.  I would like to assure him  that\r\n\r\nthe  FSCs  and the VWOs are constantly ensuring that  the\r\n\r\nstandards  of their social workers and people working  in\r\n\r\nthe  VWOs  are indeed met, because this is important  for\r\n\r\ntheir clients.  But, nonetheless, I will endeavour to get\r\n\r\nthe numbers for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, the marriage rate among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans has shown a steady decline over  the  years.\r\n\r\nThis  is  in  spite of the efforts of the SDU  and  other\r\n\r\nmatchmaking agencies and, more recently, the  efforts  of\r\n\r\nthe Romancing Singapore Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is it timely that we review the effectiveness\r\n\r\nof  the  programmes and the policies of the  Government's\r\n\r\nmatch-making  agencies  with a view  to  improving  their\r\n\r\nsuccess rates?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our total fertility rate has shown a decline\r\n\r\nover  the years, from approximately 1.8 in 1990 to  about\r\n\r\n1.1   in  2002.   With  the  replacement  rate  at   2.1,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  steadily and very  surely  headed  for\r\n\r\nextinction,  unless  something is done  to  increase  our\r\n\r\nfertility rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000, the Prime Minister appointed a Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee to look into the issue of the falling fertility\r\n\r\nrate  in  Singapore.  Supporting this Committee  was  the\r\n\r\nWorking Committee on Marriage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  Procreation.  The Ministerial Committee  recommended\r\n\r\nthe  introduction of the Baby Bonus, the Third Child Paid\r\n\r\nMaternity Leave Scheme and additional childcare benefits.\r\n\r\nThese incentives were mainly monetary in nature, and were\r\n\r\nto encourage Singaporeans to have three or more children,\r\n\r\nif they could afford it. But if they could already afford\r\n\r\nit,  would  monetary benefit alone be a strong  incentive\r\n\r\nfor  them to have more children?  Surely, there  must  be\r\n\r\nother  non-monetary motivational factors that could  make\r\n\r\nit more conducive for Singaporeans to have more babies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of our impending extinction, would the\r\n\r\nMinister  recommend the formation of an Inter-Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee,  perhaps  named  as  the  Making  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nCommittee,  that  will  review all  family  policies  and\r\n\r\nformulate  new  initiatives to raise our  fertility  rate\r\n\r\nbefore it is too late?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I\r\n\r\nwish  to comment on the family planning policies  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  In this uncertain world economic  situation,\r\n\r\nthe  family  is  the  most important  foundation  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry.  It is the best safety net for us.  It gives  us\r\n\r\nstability,  warmth and solace.  The MCDS  has  set  up  a\r\n\r\nPublic  Education Committee two years ago. The  Committee\r\n\r\npublished a book entitled: Looking After the Family,  and\r\n\r\nhad  made some 70 recommendations in 2001.  Some of these\r\n\r\nrecommendations  were   incorporated  into  some  of  our\r\n\r\nnational events such as Romancing Singapore.  May  I  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  whether  any of the other  recommendations\r\n\r\nhave been implemented?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong asked whether we need to set up\r\n\r\nanother Inter-Ministerial Committee as we already have  a\r\n\r\nCommittee  on Marriages and Procreation.  What  has  this\r\n\r\nCommittee  achieved since its inception? We may  have  to\r\n\r\ntake  into  consideration  the  changing  environment  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and make adjustments to some of  the  present\r\n\r\narrangements. For example, shall we not outsource our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatch-making  activities, instead of  confining  them  to\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies such as the Social Development  Unit,\r\n\r\netc.?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that the question of marriages and\r\n\r\nprocreation is not something which can be settled by MCDS\r\n\r\nalone. Collective efforts from all quarters are required.\r\n\r\nThis  matter has a very wide-ranging implication. In MOM,\r\n\r\nwe have lifelong learning; in MOE, we have sex education,\r\n\r\nand  so  on.  Many Ministries have to be  consulted,  and\r\n\r\nwhatever policy we implement, it must be consistent.  So,\r\n\r\nI  would  urge  the  MCDS to combine efforts  with  other\r\n\r\nMinistries   and   agencies  to  promote   marriage   and\r\n\r\nprocreation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people consider this question of marriage and\r\n\r\nprocreation to be taboo, but I feel we should  not  avoid\r\n\r\ndiscussing  it.   Something has  to  be  done  about  it.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  efforts we put in may not yield  immediate\r\n\r\ntangible  effects, I am sure, in the long run, they  will\r\n\r\nbear  fruits and benefit our future generations.  In  the\r\n\r\nmeantime,  we  should encourage our young people  to  get\r\n\r\nmarried  and  have children while they are  still  young.\r\n\r\nMiss the boat, and you will regret for life!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Charles\r\n\r\nChong has mentioned incentives like Baby Bonus Scheme and\r\n\r\nthe  Inter-Ministerial Committee.  Mrs  Yu-Foo  has  just\r\n\r\ntalked about the promotional part, the PEC on the family.\r\n\r\nThere  are  many  other  efforts  that  MCDS  is  making,\r\n\r\nincluding a very good Work-Life Unit that does tremendous\r\n\r\nwork   in   supporting  and  promoting   good   work-life\r\n\r\npractices.   We  have now maternity leave for  the  third\r\n\r\nchild,  and  in the civil service, sick child care  leave\r\n\r\nhas  been extended to fathers as well.  For all of  these\r\n\r\nefforts, our fertility rate has not budged one  bit.   In\r\n\r\nfact, it has budged, but has gone in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nMy   question  now  is:  what  do  we  do  next?   Simple\r\n\r\nenhancements  -  like further developing  child-  minding\r\n\r\nservices  and  home-help  services  to  be  delivered  at\r\n\r\ncommunity level, beyond CDC level down to Residents'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommittees, and even block level, trying to replicate the\r\n\r\nold  informal  neighbour-type networks,  and  being  more\r\n\r\ntargeted with the different messages to different groups,\r\n\r\nlike  the higher educated women may have more flexibility\r\n\r\nin  their  choices,  whereas for  those  from  the  lower\r\n\r\neconomic strata for whom dropping out of the workforce is\r\n\r\nnot  an option, and they cannot totally decide on that  - may not actually make any impact at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three big categories of determinants of\r\n\r\nfertility rates, and that is, economic, social,  cultural\r\n\r\nand  institutional.  And all of them  interplay  and  all\r\n\r\nthree  of  them are important in a couple's  decision  to\r\n\r\nstart a family.  Across the board, are we truly doing all\r\n\r\nthat  we  can to address all the issues in all the  three\r\n\r\nareas?   It  is  impossible to try to cover  all  of  the\r\n\r\ngrounds  in a 2-minute cut.  So, at this point  in  time,\r\n\r\nwhat I do want to raise for Government's consideration is\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not we should be looking for examples,  like\r\n\r\nthe  European  experiences, to see what  lessons  we  can\r\n\r\nlearn from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the traditional and conservative South European\r\n\r\ncountries of Italy and Spain, the fertility rate has gone\r\n\r\nsouth,  so to speak, all the way to 1.2.  In the Northern\r\n\r\nEuropean countries, the Scandinavian countries of  Norway\r\n\r\nand  Finland, where the Government has pulled out all the\r\n\r\nstops to support family formations, in terms of very high\r\n\r\nsubsidy  for  childcare, like over  80%,  providing  very\r\n\r\ngenerous   paternal  leave,  and  aggressively  promoting\r\n\r\nfathers'  involvement, the rate is at the level  of  1.8.\r\n\r\nSo,  are we willing to pull out all the stops and  go  to\r\n\r\nthis  extent?   If we are unable to persuade  more  young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to get married and to have children,  maybe\r\n\r\nto  have  one  or two, or more children, the  only  other\r\n\r\nalternative  is  to grow our population entirely  through\r\n\r\nincoming migration.  Do we throw in the towel and  settle\r\n\r\nfor this option?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister share with us what might be the\r\n\r\nthoughts of the leadership on this very important  issue,\r\n\r\nupon which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhangs  our  continued  long term existence?   Indeed,  Mr\r\n\r\nCharles Chong did talk about extinction.  It is an  issue\r\n\r\nas   important,   if   not  more  so,   than   our   cost\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness, which is getting so much attention  now,\r\n\r\nand  the  quality of our workforce, as it  addresses,  in\r\n\r\nfact, whether we will have a workforce at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang:</b> Sir, like the hon.\r\n\r\nMember, Dr Jennifer Lee, the issues regarding the  family\r\n\r\nare actually very far-reaching, wide and complex.  Whilst\r\n\r\nwe are still grappling with various schemes, measures and\r\n\r\npolicies, I would like to zoom in on two main areas  that\r\n\r\nhave   to  do  with  changing  the  mindsets  of  couples\r\n\r\nintending  to  get married, and couples who  are  already\r\n\r\nmarried,  in  the  hope  that this might  encourage  more\r\n\r\ncouples  to go in for responsible marriages, and then  to\r\n\r\nwork at their marriages with the level of commitment that\r\n\r\nis  required.   I am referring specifically  to  marriage\r\n\r\npreparation courses and marriage enrichment  courses.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  the Government is  not  ready  to  make\r\n\r\nmarriage preparation courses mandatory for ROM marriages.\r\n\r\nIf  such is the case, what steps are taken to enhance the\r\n\r\nrole of religious organisations, for example, mosques and\r\n\r\nchurches,  VWOs and the GROs in organising such  courses?\r\n\r\nWe  understand  that with a materialistic  lifestyle  and\r\n\r\nwith   the   onslaught   of  globalisation,   the   whole\r\n\r\ninstitution  of  marriage and having responsible  parents\r\n\r\nand  families is probably in danger of erosion here.   So\r\n\r\nwe  need to take active steps.  Maybe such courses  could\r\n\r\nbe  even  eligible for not just subsidies for the service\r\n\r\nproviders,   but  also  tax-breaks  or  subsidies   under\r\n\r\nContinuing Education and Training programme.  We have  to\r\n\r\ntake  this very seriously now, and not just leave  it  to\r\n\r\nindividuals  to figure out the value systems,  the  roles\r\n\r\nand responsibilities on an ad hoc basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Iswaran is not here.

Some critics are very quick  to  highlight\r\n\r\nthat  this is the epitome of the sad state of our society\r\n\r\n-  not  only  do  we  need to be  taught  on  the  social\r\n\r\netiquette in public toilets, now we need to be taught  or\r\n\r\nencourage to show or express our love.  Sir, real or not,\r\n\r\nanother perception of the Romancing Singapore campaign is\r\n\r\nto  address  the  issue  of low marriage  rates  and  the\r\n\r\nperennial problem of our fertility rate, which have  been\r\n\r\nmentioned by many of the other Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that some $400,000 was spent on\r\n\r\nRomancing  Singapore.  I wonder what was  MCDS's  desired\r\n\r\noutcome  when  embarking on such  a  one-month  campaign?\r\n\r\nAlso, since we are talking about encouraging Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  get  married, I would like to discuss  the  role  and\r\n\r\nperformance of SDU and SDS.  SDU was established in 1984.\r\n\r\nNext  year,  it will be celebrating its 20th anniversary.\r\n\r\nSir, this is almost one generation.  We are probably  now\r\n\r\ncourting the children of our pioneer SDU couples  to  get\r\n\r\nmarried  soon.  Two decades, and we are still needing  to\r\n\r\nspend  money to encourage people to get married and  have\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I would like to ask the following\r\n\r\nquestions:  How much is spent every year on SDU  and  its\r\n\r\nrelated   programmes  that  aim  at  encouraging   family\r\n\r\nformation?   How  successful have these programmes  been?\r\n\r\nWe  saw  the  number of marriages is  coming  down  -  2%\r\n\r\ndecrease last year.  The proportion of single people over-35  years  has  jumped from 18.7% to 30.3%  in  just  one\r\n\r\ndecade.   Could  these figures have  been  worse  without\r\n\r\nthese programmes and efforts?  I would like to ask if the\r\n\r\nMinistry  has done a thorough review of these  programmes\r\n\r\nto  see  if  they are meeting the needs of  the  changing\r\n\r\nprofiles of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is crucial, as 20 years is a long time and\r\n\r\nthe recent MCDS survey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  many other surveys have indicated changing profiles,\r\n\r\nattitudes and needs of Singaporeans towards marriage  and\r\n\r\nfamily life.  Sir, the Census 2000 also showed the  other\r\n\r\n\"problem\"  with regard to family formation.   The  highly\r\n\r\neducated  women  and  the  lowly  educated  men  are  not\r\n\r\nmarrying.   My undergraduates have no qualms  in  raising\r\n\r\ntheir  hands when I ask how many of them do not  plan  to\r\n\r\nget  married.  It is quite worrying.  What is being  done\r\n\r\nin this regard, and has there been any improvement in our\r\n\r\nefforts in the last two years since Census 2000?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, part of romancing, and I must declare that I am\r\n\r\nnot  an  expert in it, is about appreciation and  respect\r\n\r\nfor  one's  partner.   It  is  about  understanding  each\r\n\r\nother's  expectations.  It is about  being  ready  for  a\r\n\r\ncommitment.  It is about living lives together within the\r\n\r\nsame  environment.   And it is about  sharing  a  vision.\r\n\r\nAffairs  of the heart are really hard to understand,  but\r\n\r\nunderstand they must.  One of the issues, I think, is for\r\n\r\nmen  to  understand the changing expectations of women  - not  just about romancing - but about being husbands  and\r\n\r\nfathers.  I encourage the Ministry to focus more  efforts\r\n\r\non  the  men  to understand these changes and reciprocate\r\n\r\nwith appropriate actions as they continue to romance into\r\n\r\nthe  hearts  of  their womenfolk.   Perhaps  we  need  to\r\n\r\ninitiate  a  men's movement to catch up with the  women's\r\n\r\nmovement  that  had started some 30 years  ago.   Indeed,\r\n\r\nmany of them are leaving their men behind, and my message\r\n\r\nto my fellow men - run after them.  Maybe we can give the\r\n\r\nmen some steroids to stimulate their chase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Ho Geok Choo is not here.

Hopefully,\r\n\r\nthat  works  out.   Much  has been said  about  declining\r\n\r\nfertility.  The rate is reportedly very low.   We  talked\r\n\r\nabout  the possible extinction of Singaporeans.   And  we\r\n\r\nintroduced the Baby Bonus Scheme about two years\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nback.  What was the target when it started?  How far  are\r\n\r\nwe  from the target?  How many people have benefited from\r\n\r\nthe scheme so far?  And I would also like to ask how much\r\n\r\nhas been spent on the Baby Bonus Scheme.  We all know the\r\n\r\ncritical  situation for Singapore.  Have we attempted  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  more why Singaporeans are still reluctant  to\r\n\r\nhave children?  Are there plans to improve the package to\r\n\r\nmotivate  more  people?  Studies have  shown  that  other\r\n\r\nfactors are important in the decision to have babies, one\r\n\r\nof  them  being  the  rising medical cost.   Perhaps  one\r\n\r\naspect of the bonus would be to help them purchase health\r\n\r\ninsurance  for  their babies, if this is  really  one  of\r\n\r\ntheir  concerns.  Some have told me that it is the nitty-gritty, even buying diapers and baby formulas could be an\r\n\r\nissue  to them.  Certainly, we do not want the Government\r\n\r\nto  be surrogate parents to their children.  But I wonder\r\n\r\nhow  the Ministry has taken all these into consideration,\r\n\r\nespecially those that have been mentioned by Dr  Jennifer\r\n\r\nLee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another related issue is that we are assuming\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  would at least want to have one  child  and\r\n\r\nthus  the  bonus  is  only for the  2nd  and  3rd  child.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  if  the situation is desperate enough,  we  may\r\n\r\nwant  to  consider  extending it for the  1st  child  and\r\n\r\nthereby motivate having the 2nd and 3rd, if not more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously we heard that 12,000 abortions take place\r\n\r\nevery year, on the average.  Every unborn child is a loss\r\n\r\nto   our  country.   I  recognise  the  need  for  us  to\r\n\r\nunderstand the reasons behind these abortions.  Are there\r\n\r\nexamples  in  other  countries on  programmes  where  the\r\n\r\nStates work with these mothers and motivate them to carry\r\n\r\ntheir  babies  to  full term, and then  perhaps  put  the\r\n\r\nbabies  up  for  adoption?   Perhaps  we  can  give  them\r\n\r\nbonuses.  Such informal schemes are already happening  in\r\n\r\nthe adoption sector, where the adopting family offers the\r\n\r\nmother an ang pow in giving up the baby for adoption.  We\r\n\r\nmay want to consider that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many people are saying that money is not the\r\n\r\nonly thing that motivates the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  to  have children.  While, in most circumstances,\r\n\r\nmoney talks, in this case, perhaps, we need to understand\r\n\r\nwhat else makes baby talk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, young\r\n\r\nmarried  couples often worry about who will take care  of\r\n\r\ntheir  babies  when they go to work.  This is  one  major\r\n\r\nreason  why they put off having more babies.  They cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to live on a single income.  So both husband  and\r\n\r\nwife  need  to go back to work, and not all of them  have\r\n\r\nmothers  or  mothers-in-law to turn to  for  baby-sitting\r\n\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has led to the present situation where infants\r\n\r\nare  being fostered out to strangers untrained  in  baby-sitting, and with some babies being brought home only  on\r\n\r\nweekends, or being cared for by foreign maids.   This  is\r\n\r\nless   than  ideal.   We  should  provide  couples   with\r\n\r\naffordable  and  quality  infant  care  centres  in   the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood that offer full-day care, so  that  working\r\n\r\nparents  can take their infants home and spend time  with\r\n\r\nthem after work.  I believe this is important for parent-child  bonding and for the development of the child.   At\r\n\r\nthe same time, working parents would have their minds  at\r\n\r\nease during the day, as their infants would be cared  for\r\n\r\nby professionally-trained and caring nannies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I did a survey in my constituency to check\r\n\r\nthe  demand for infant care, and I found that there is  a\r\n\r\nneed  for  such an infant care centre.  There  is  now  a\r\n\r\ndearth of infant care facilities, and the very few infant\r\n\r\ncare  centres available charge very high rates.  Some  of\r\n\r\nsuch  centres  had previously closed down,  because  they\r\n\r\nwere losing money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infant care, for babies aged two months to 18\r\n\r\nmonths,  requires a higher staff-child ratio as  well  as\r\n\r\nspecial facilities.  And to provide good quality care  to\r\n\r\ninfants, we need to provide a ratio of at least one well-trained babysitter to about three to four babies, to make\r\n\r\nsure that each infant gets the close attention that he or\r\n\r\nshe needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrast this to the childcare centres for children\r\n\r\nabove  18 months, where the ratio is one teacher to about\r\n\r\neight  children.  It costs mothers about $400 a month  to\r\n\r\nput a child into a childcare centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my constituency, we did our sums and found\r\n\r\nthat  it  would  be expensive to set up  an  infant  care\r\n\r\ncentre.  To be viable, the minimum charge to care  for  a\r\n\r\nbaby  would have to be at least $700 a month.  This would\r\n\r\nbe too much to bear for most couples who need infant care\r\n\r\nservices for their babies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, the Government provides childcare subsidy\r\n\r\nof  $150  for  working  mothers and $75  for  non-working\r\n\r\nmothers.   It does not differentiate between infant  care\r\n\r\nand childcare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge the Minister to consider giving\r\n\r\ngrants  to help community-based organisations to  provide\r\n\r\ninfant care facilities and to provide higher subsidies to\r\n\r\nmothers for infant care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, I would like to argue for\r\n\r\nmore support for the Singapore family, as many others  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  before me had done so, particularly  in  the\r\n\r\nworkplace.   I  would argue that it is  in  the  national\r\n\r\ninterest  to do so if the family is not to end up  as  an\r\n\r\nextinct species.  It also makes good economic sense, as a\r\n\r\nlook  at  many  Fortune 500 companies show that  many  of\r\n\r\nthese  companies  could  attract  and  retain  the   best\r\n\r\ntalents, because they adopt family-friendly practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I worry that the lack of employment policies to\r\n\r\naccommodate  working  parents is forcing  individuals  to\r\n\r\nmake  painful choices between job security and parenting.\r\n\r\nIn  Singapore's case, we have seen the impact due to  the\r\n\r\nnature of the roles of men and women in our society,  the\r\n\r\nprimary responsibility for family care-taking often falls\r\n\r\non   women.   As  a  result,  more  women  have  remained\r\n\r\nunmarried or, if married, delay having children.  Despite\r\n\r\nall  the  financial incentives, we now  have  the  lowest\r\n\r\nfertility rate in 14 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware of the tripartite initiatives that are\r\n\r\ncurrently  in  place  to promote work-life  balance,  but\r\n\r\nprogress  is  still slow.  Such initiatives are  laudable\r\n\r\nand  should  continue, but I fear that they  may  not  be\r\n\r\nenough.  Dr Jennifer Lee had said that what is needed may\r\n\r\nbe more than just incremental changes.  To me, any change\r\n\r\nwould  be better than no change at all.  So I do ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister whether he will consider introducing legislation\r\n\r\non  family care leave.  Such a legislation would allow an\r\n\r\nemployee, both female and male, to take leave  so  as  to\r\n\r\ntake  care  of  a  child, parent or spouse  with  serious\r\n\r\nhealth  conditions.  Because, now, the issue is not  just\r\n\r\none  of  taking care of an infant or a young  child,  but\r\n\r\nbecause  of the ageing population, there is an  increased\r\n\r\nburden  on  families  to take care of  sick  and  elderly\r\n\r\nparents as well as sick and elderly siblings.  We do  not\r\n\r\nhave that kind of a support in our society right now.  If\r\n\r\nthe  argument against legislation is that it would create\r\n\r\nrigidity, an argument which I am well aware of and  I  am\r\n\r\nalso  equally concerned, coming from the trade union,  or\r\n\r\nthat  it would increase cost, then I would argue that  it\r\n\r\nis equally costly for employers to lose trained staff and\r\n\r\nto  incur additional cost to recruit new staff and  train\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the use of such leave can be subject to\r\n\r\nconditions,  such as minimum employment  period  and  the\r\n\r\nleave  can be limited to one week, for instance.  At  the\r\n\r\nend  of  the  day,  I think that society  must  strike  a\r\n\r\nbalance.   We  want economic progress but  we  must  also\r\n\r\nunderstand that without social progress, there cannot  be\r\n\r\neconomic  progress.   So  society  must  provide   enough\r\n\r\nsupport to the family, so that the family can nurture and\r\n\r\ndevelop  talents, so that our economy can  grow  and  our\r\n\r\nsociety  can  progress even further.  Sir,  instances  of\r\n\r\nsuch  leave are common in other countries, including  the\r\n\r\nUS,  which is the bastion of free trade and free  market,\r\n\r\nand  it  has the Family and Medical Leave Act  which  was\r\n\r\npassed in 1993.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Cynthia Phua is not here.

They  really do not have  many  options,\r\n\r\napart from leaving their children at childcare centres or\r\n\r\nwith  maids.   We  may  want to note that,  increasingly,\r\n\r\nraising grandchildren is not part of the retirement plans\r\n\r\nof many grandparents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS can play a vital role to facilitate the\r\n\r\navailability of affordable and professionally run  infant\r\n\r\ncare  and  toddler care services.  This  would  give  the\r\n\r\nquality  assurance and would help ensure the  safety  and\r\n\r\nwell-being of infants and toddlers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how many childcare centres that cater to\r\n\r\nchildren below 18 months of age are available?  What kind\r\n\r\nof  fees  are these centres charging?  Would MCDS support\r\n\r\nthe  setting  up  of  24-hour care  centres?   The  ideal\r\n\r\ncaregivers  of  infants  are,  of  course,  the   parents\r\n\r\nthemselves.   But such centres may be of use,  especially\r\n\r\nduring  emergency,  for  short  periods  when  there   is\r\n\r\ndisruption of the usual care arrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Childcare centres at the workplace are convenient\r\n\r\nfor  many  parents.  This calls for more assistance  from\r\n\r\nthe   Government  to  encourage  employers  to   consider\r\n\r\nproviding  childcare centres at the workplace.   Have  we\r\n\r\nachieved better progress in this area?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, studies have shown that very young children\r\n\r\nfare  better  with  family-based childcare.   Would  MCDS\r\n\r\nsubsidise such family-based childcare in lieu of care  at\r\n\r\nchildcare  centres?  Granting subsidy here may  encourage\r\n\r\nsuitable  housewives and retirees to  work  and  to  have\r\n\r\nincome  whilst  staying home.  These  caregivers  can  be\r\n\r\naccredited  or  monitored  and  registered  under   MCDS'\r\n\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, I just want to\r\n\r\nfocus  on  childcare  issues in relation  to  low  income\r\n\r\nfamilies.  One of the things that I find quite a  lot  in\r\n\r\nmy  work  is  that  many low income  families  have  many\r\n\r\nchildren.  And one of the problems\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat they face is really the choice of whether the mother\r\n\r\nwants to go out to work or not, and that is dependent  on\r\n\r\nthe  number of children that they have, because childcare\r\n\r\nfees sometimes are pretty high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that we have the Centre-based Financial\r\n\r\nAssistance for Childcare scheme of MCDS, and I think this\r\n\r\nis  a very good programme.  I am happy to note that a lot\r\n\r\nmore  families are participating in this programme.  But,\r\n\r\nsometimes,  it also depends on the fees that are  charged\r\n\r\nby  the  childcare centres to enable a family to  send  a\r\n\r\nchild  to the childcare centre.  I just want to make  the\r\n\r\npoint  that  childcare will benefit low  income  families\r\n\r\nbecause  it  will  not only provide stimulation  for  the\r\n\r\nchildren in their social and intellectual development, it\r\n\r\nalso  increases the sense of self-esteem  of  the  mother\r\n\r\nwhen she is able to work and be independent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have several questions in relation to the\r\n\r\nCentre-based  Financial Assistance for  Childcare  (CFAC)\r\n\r\nscheme.  First, how many people have applied for CFAC but\r\n\r\nnot  successful?  What were the reasons  for  them  being\r\n\r\nunsuccessful?   Are there plans to review the  scheme  in\r\n\r\nthe  light of these unsuccessful applications?  Also,  in\r\n\r\nthat  light,  are there sufficient affordable  places  in\r\n\r\nchildcare centres for these CFAC applicants to  make  use\r\n\r\nof?    Because,  sometimes,  it  really  depends  on  the\r\n\r\nlocation of the childcare centres, and I am not sure  the\r\n\r\nextent  to  which such affordable childcare  centres  are\r\n\r\nlocated sufficiently in different parts of Singapore.  At\r\n\r\nthe  end of the day, if the cash outlay required  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily  is  high,  it will demotivate them  from  sending\r\n\r\ntheir children to childcare centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue is that of childcare operators. I\r\n\r\nhave  heard that sometimes the childcare operators choose\r\n\r\nnot  to be processed under the CFAC scheme, because  they\r\n\r\nfind   it   cumbersome.   I  wonder  whether  the   claim\r\n\r\nprocedures are indeed tedious and cumbersome, which  make\r\n\r\nthe  childcare  operators  not actually  encouraging  the\r\n\r\npotentially  low  income families  from  benefiting  from\r\n\r\nchildcare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister can address these issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, so far, eight babies\r\n\r\nhave  been found abandoned here since February last year,\r\n\r\nand two were found dead.  In Singapore, it is a crime  to\r\n\r\nabandon  a baby.   The parents can be jailed up to  seven\r\n\r\nyears,  fined  or both.  I know that, in  Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has been quite flexible and has not prosecuted\r\n\r\nsome  mothers  who  have abandoned their  babies  safely.\r\n\r\nBut,  obviously, the fear of breaking the law has  caused\r\n\r\nmany  to  abandon their babies unsafely.  This opens  the\r\n\r\nbaby to the risk of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should consider adopting the safe haven baby\r\n\r\nabandonment  laws  found in many states  in  the  US  and\r\n\r\nseveral  parts  of  the developed world,  which  allow  a\r\n\r\nparent  to  anonymously drop off an  unharmed  infant  at\r\n\r\ncertain  identified places  -  no questions asked.   Such\r\n\r\nsafe  drop-off points are identified clearly in the laws,\r\n\r\nand   they  can  include  places  like  hospitals,   fire\r\n\r\nstations, police stations and child welfare agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One reservation that some of us may have is whether\r\n\r\nsuch laws might promote irresponsible parenting.  I would\r\n\r\nargue  that the intent of these laws is to save the lives\r\n\r\nof   the   babies.   The  important  issues  of  teaching\r\n\r\nresponsibility and good values should be dealt separately\r\n\r\nwith  other  programmes.  In any case,  consider  how  we\r\n\r\nlegalise  and even facilitate abortions.  We  do  not  go\r\n\r\ninto  a  moral tizzy and say, \"Oh, we should not make  it\r\n\r\neasy  to  abort  so that we don't send the wrong  message\r\n\r\nabout irresponsible parenting.\"  But when we try to  save\r\n\r\nthe  lives of abandoned babies and making it easier, this\r\n\r\nconcern arises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason why our authorities seem uneasy with\r\n\r\nthe  \"no  questions asked\" rule is their  obsession  with\r\n\r\ngetting  the  medical history and biological heritage  of\r\n\r\nthe  abandoned baby.  To get that, they need the  details\r\n\r\nof  the mother and the need to interview her.  But if  we\r\n\r\nhave to choose between a dead baby\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndumped in the open and to being abandoned safely with  no\r\n\r\nmedical records, the choice seems obvious to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some states in the US, any information provided\r\n\r\nby the parent is on a voluntary basis.  She does not have\r\n\r\nto  give  her  name or answer any questions, but  medical\r\n\r\nforms  will be offered to her.  She may fill them  up  at\r\n\r\nthe  safe haven or she may take them home and return them\r\n\r\nby mail. All information will be kept confidential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mothers who abandon babies are typically young,\r\n\r\nunmarried  and  pregnant for the first  time.   They  are\r\n\r\noften  afraid  that  others will  find  out  about  their\r\n\r\npregnancies and they want utmost secrecy.  Often, mothers\r\n\r\nmay  see  abandoning  their child as  an  alternative  to\r\n\r\nabortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we may have a complication if the\r\n\r\nmother abandoning the newborn is a foreign maid.  Then we\r\n\r\nhave  to decide which is more important to us  -   saving\r\n\r\nthe  life  of  a  baby  or punishing  the  maid  for  her\r\n\r\nfoolishness and deporting her.  If a foreign  maid  knows\r\n\r\nshe  will be punished, she will not come forward to leave\r\n\r\nher  baby in safe hands.  For me, the choice will  be  to\r\n\r\nsave the life of the baby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, teenage births have risen from 704 in 1997 to\r\n\r\nabout  850  last  year.  We need to step  up  our  social\r\n\r\nprogrammes aimed at pregnancy prevention, pre-natal  care\r\n\r\nand  counselling for at-risk girls.  We must  also  reach\r\n\r\nout  to  the boys, perhaps more so to the boys.  We  must\r\n\r\nteach the boys the consequences of their actions and  the\r\n\r\nneed to take responsibility for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGirls will not get pregnant if the boys are responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know a case of a teenager who gave birth\r\n\r\nalone  in  the toilet and stuffed her baby down  a  pail.\r\n\r\nThe baby died and it became a Coroner's case in 1987.   I\r\n\r\ncovered  that  case when I was a court reporter  for  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times, and I learnt that her boyfriend left  her\r\n\r\nwhen she told him about her pregnancy and he did not help\r\n\r\nher.   She  hid her pregnancy from her mother by  wearing\r\n\r\nbaggy  clothes.  And when her mother found her in a  pool\r\n\r\nof  blood in the toilet, the teenage girl called out  her\r\n\r\nboyfriend's  name and asked her mother to take revenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to act now to make sure that our system\r\n\r\ncan  address  the multi-faceted problem of  babies  being\r\n\r\nabandoned and left to die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
