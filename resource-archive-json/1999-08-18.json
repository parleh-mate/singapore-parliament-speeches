The list of  companies\r\n\r\nthat   the  Government  has  sent  scholars  to  include   Shell\r\n\r\nInternational  in  London, Singapore Airlines, Singapore  Power,\r\n\r\nStraits  Steamship  Land,  Temasek Holdings,  Media  Corporation\r\n\r\n(formerly SIM) and DBS Bank.  The Civil Service will continue to\r\n\r\nprovide  such training and development opportunities,  including\r\n\r\npostings  and attachments, for civil servants to learn from  and\r\n\r\nbe  in  touch  with the private sector, as well  as  the  people\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, would the Government\r\n\r\nconsider creating a separate career path for these scholars  who\r\n\r\nhave  signed  up  with  the  Civil Service  as  part  of  career\r\n\r\ndevelopment  rather than to spend part of their service  in  the\r\n\r\npublic   service  and  then  move  on  to  the  private   sector\r\n\r\nsubsequently?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I think this may be difficult because\r\n\r\nwhen  somebody joins the public service, the expectation is that\r\n\r\nhe  will spend most of his career in the public sector.

But if a person wants  to\r\n\r\nspend most of his career in the private sector, then he joins  a\r\n\r\nbank, a multinational corporation, or a law firm.  I think it is\r\n\r\nvery  hard to have an arrangement where you are half in and half\r\n\r\nout.

Normally,  there  is   an\r\n\r\nunderstanding  that when we second somebody out or  somebody  is\r\n\r\nseconded to us there is a \"no poaching\" rule.  You cannot at the\r\n\r\nend  of the period say, \"I am keeping this person.\"  So I do not\r\n\r\nthink  we have any recent problems.  But we have to continue  to\r\n\r\nmonitor  this.

We\r\n\r\nhave ratified a total of 20 ILO Conventions including two of the\r\n\r\nseven  core  conventions, namely Convention 98 on the  Right  to\r\n\r\nOrganise and Collective Bargaining, and Convention 29 on  Forced\r\n\r\nLabour. As a member state of the ILO, Singapore participates  in\r\n\r\nrelevant   ILO   activities.  We  monitor  the  development   of\r\n\r\ninternational   labour  issues  closely   and   assess   whether\r\n\r\nadditional ILO conventions could be ratified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convention 100 on \"Equal Remuneration\" aims to ensure a non-discriminatory payment of salary for men and women for work of\r\n\r\nequal  value.  In  Singapore, working women  enjoy  good  social\r\n\r\nstatus   and   income  that  are  comparable   to   their   male\r\n\r\ncounterparts. Our employment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npractices  emphasize payment of salary based on performance  and\r\n\r\nmeritocracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convention 138 on \"Minimum Age\" aims at protecting children\r\n\r\nby establishing a minimum age for certain types of work.

However,  ratification  of  ILO\r\n\r\nConventions entails obligations to fully comply with  all  their\r\n\r\nprovisions.  My Ministry will carry out a thorough study on  the\r\n\r\nrequirements  and  our  follow-up  actions  under  each  of  the\r\n\r\nconventions,  in  consultation  with  NTUC,  Singapore  National\r\n\r\nEmployers' Federation (SNEF) and other relevant agencies, before\r\n\r\nwe can consider ratifying Conventions 100 and 138.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central):</b> Sir, can the Minister\r\n\r\ninform  the  House  about  the number  of  complaints  that  his\r\n\r\nMinistry  received on gender based discrimination over the  past\r\n\r\nfew  years?

While it is not a problem in Singapore, can  the\r\n\r\nMinister  tell us the number of companies which has  been  found\r\n\r\nemploying underaged youths in the past few years?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member has raised\r\n\r\nthree  supplementary  questions.   One  is  on  the  number   of\r\n\r\ncomplaints received on gender based discrimination.  Apart  from\r\n\r\na   small  number  of  complaints  about  gender  discriminatory\r\n\r\nrecruitment advertisements, my Ministry has so far not  received\r\n\r\nany   complaints  concerning  gender  discriminatory  employment\r\n\r\npractices adopted by any company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that in March this year, my Ministry,\r\n\r\ntogether   with  the  NTUC  and  Singapore  National  Employers'\r\n\r\nFederation,   had  jointly  issued  tripartite   guidelines   on\r\n\r\nrecruitment  advertisements.  I am pleased to inform  the  House\r\n\r\nthat since the release of these guidelines,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrecruitment  advertisements which specify gender, age,  race  or\r\n\r\nreligion  had dropped from about 30% to less than 1%.   We  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  persuade  the last few  employers  to  adopt  non-discriminatory practices when they advertise for new employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second supplementary question is on women doing part-time work and also flexi-time arrangements with their employers\r\n\r\nand  how  we  will  protect  them from discrimination  based  on\r\n\r\ngender.  Sir, currently, employees taking up part-time or flexi-work  are  covered  by the Employment Act and  its  regulations.\r\n\r\nTheir  terms  and conditions, in respect of statutory  benefits,\r\n\r\nare pro-rated based on the number of hours that they work vis-a-vis  the  regular working hours of their full-time  counterparts\r\n\r\nwithin  the company.  Our employment laws and practices  are  of\r\n\r\ncourse  gender neutral.  Sir, my Ministry is also  looking  into\r\n\r\nhow  our  employment  laws  could  be  made  more  flexible   to\r\n\r\nfacilitate the employment of women in such work arrangements  so\r\n\r\nthat they can better balance work and family responsibilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he asked the number of employers who have been\r\n\r\nfound  employing underaged youths in the past few  years.   Sir,\r\n\r\nunder  the  Employment Act, a child below the age  of  12  years\r\n\r\nshall not be employed in any occupation at all.  My Ministry has\r\n\r\nnot   received  any  complaint  of  such  underaged   employment\r\n\r\npractices for more than 10 years.  Under the Act, young  persons\r\n\r\nbelow  the  age  of  14 years are also not allowed  to  work  in\r\n\r\nindustrial  undertakings.  They can only be  employed  in  light\r\n\r\nwork suited to their capability and capacity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For young persons between the ages of 14 and 16 years, a\r\n\r\nsmall number are employed in industrial undertakings.  Employers\r\n\r\nmust  notify  the Commissioner for Labour with  details  of  the\r\n\r\nyoung  person and medical report to certify his fitness for  the\r\n\r\njob.   Last  year, the Commissioner received notifications  from\r\n\r\n1,200  young  persons  to  work in industrial  undertakings.   I\r\n\r\nshould  hasten to point out that almost all of them are  working\r\n\r\npart-time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  fast food restaurants and such kind of establishments.  Fast\r\n\r\nfood restaurants are classified as industrial undertakings under\r\n\r\nthe  Factories Act because cutting machines and other  apparatus\r\n\r\nfor food preparation are used in the premises.  So employers  of\r\n\r\nyoung  persons between the ages of 14 and 16 years in fast  food\r\n\r\nrestaurants have to notify the Commissioner for Labour  on  this\r\n\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> May I ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister, when he says that our women in Singapore are paid\r\n\r\ncomparable  wages,  is  he able to assure  the  House  that  all\r\n\r\nemployers  in Singapore, whether they are in the private  sector\r\n\r\nor  public  sector, pay equal wages to men and women  doing  the\r\n\r\nwork  of  same value or the same work?  Is that the fact?   And,\r\n\r\nsecondly,  he says the Ministry, in conjunction with  the  NTUC,\r\n\r\nwill make a study of the provisions in these two conventions.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not know how long ago the conventions were promulgated.  Why\r\n\r\nhas  it taken the Ministry all this while and has it started  in\r\n\r\nits study of the provisions?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to equal\r\n\r\nwages  for  men  and  women, my Ministry has  not  received  any\r\n\r\ncomplaint that companies adopt discriminatory practices.  If the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  is  aware of such discriminatory  practices  being\r\n\r\nadopted by any employer, please bring it to our attention and we\r\n\r\nwill look into the matter.  As far as we are aware, employers in\r\n\r\nSingapore adopt the practice of paying their employees the  same\r\n\r\nwages  for  the same kind of work being done.  If the Member  is\r\n\r\nalluding  to  the  fact  that  when  you  look  at  the  overall\r\n\r\nstatistics, there is some wage disparity between male and female\r\n\r\nemployees,  let  me clarify that wage disparity in  the  overall\r\n\r\nstatistics   of   our  labour  force  is  not  the   result   of\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory practices.  It is due to the differences  in  the\r\n\r\nprofile  of  male and female workers in Singapore.  Many  female\r\n\r\nworkers  drop out of the labour force when they get married  and\r\n\r\nstart  a  family.   As  a result, the current  stock  of  female\r\n\r\nemployees is generally younger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompared  to the male employees who are older because they  stay\r\n\r\nin  the  labour force longer.  So when we average out, the  wage\r\n\r\nwould indicate that the males tend to get a higher pay than  the\r\n\r\nfemale.   But that is because of this pattern of female  workers\r\n\r\ndropping  out of the labour force earlier than the male workers,\r\n\r\nand not because the employers deliberately pay them less.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, a lot of our female workers are also employed\r\n\r\nin  the production and related-type of work and as a result, you\r\n\r\nwill  find  that the overall earnings of female workers  may  be\r\n\r\ndepressed.   There  again,  it is not  because  they  have  been\r\n\r\ndiscriminated  against but because of the nature  of  work  that\r\n\r\nthey  do.   If you go to an electronics factory, you  will  find\r\n\r\nthat  the  vast  majority of the assembly workers or  production\r\n\r\nworkers  are females.  So, they are paid according to  the  work\r\n\r\nthey are doing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the study to look into whether we can accede to\r\n\r\nratify Convention Nos. 100 and 138, let me point out to the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  that there are many countries or nations who are members\r\n\r\nof the International Labour Organisation. They do not ratify all\r\n\r\nthe  conventions.   Even the United States of America  does  not\r\n\r\nratify all the conventions of ILO. In fact, the United States is\r\n\r\none  of  the  countries that has ratified the fewest  number  of\r\n\r\nconventions  compared  to  many  other  countries.   It  is  not\r\n\r\nsurprising that we have not ratified all the conventions because\r\n\r\neach  country's laws are crafted based on the special  needs  of\r\n\r\nthe country.  ILO provides a supranational legal framework.   It\r\n\r\nis  only  when we feel fully comfortable and confident that  our\r\n\r\nlegal  framework  will  not  in any way  clash  with  the  legal\r\n\r\nframework  imposed  by  ILO that we then  proceed  to  ratify  a\r\n\r\nconvention.  That is why I am saying that since we have  reached\r\n\r\nthis  stage, there is no discrimination on the basis of  gender,\r\n\r\nin  terms of wages and also our minimum age laws will not  clash\r\n\r\nwith  what  ILO is espousing, that we can now look further  into\r\n\r\nthis  matter to see whether in fact we should proceed to  ratify\r\n\r\nthese two conventions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister\r\n\r\nanother supplementary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nquestion?   Does  he accept that unless there  is  a  law  which\r\n\r\nrequires equal pay for men and women, there is very little point\r\n\r\nin  women complaining to his Ministry? He says that his Ministry\r\n\r\nhas never had any complaints so far.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me explain again\r\n\r\nto  the hon. Member that even ILO does not require countries  to\r\n\r\nenact a legislation on equal remuneration if they want to ratify\r\n\r\nthe  convention.   In some instances, ILO will  only  require  a\r\n\r\ntripartite  declaration to the effect that  the  wages  will  be\r\n\r\nbased  on  the work performed rather than on the gender  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.   There is no reason for us to adopt his approach  that\r\n\r\nfor  every  issue, we must create or establish a law  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the matter is dealt with.  We have, over all these  years,\r\n\r\nmade  progress  and  demonstrated that the  meritocratic  system\r\n\r\nworks and employees will be paid according to the value of their\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  the  company  and  no  employer  is  going  to\r\n\r\ndeliberately  circumvent  this  by  paying  his  female  workers\r\n\r\nsignificantly  less than what he pays to his male  employees  if\r\n\r\nthey are doing the same job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RESTORATION OF WORKERS' RIGHTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Manpower\r\n\r\nwhether  the Government has any intention to restore to  workers\r\n\r\nthe rights which were taken from them in 1968.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> The Industrial Relations Act was amended\r\n\r\nin  1968  to  provide  a  sound basis for  enhancing  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations.   The  amendments  drew  a  distinction  between  the\r\n\r\nfunctions  of  management and trade unions while  balancing  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  both  parties.  Thus,  under  the  new  provision,\r\n\r\nmatters   like   promotion,  transfer,   hiring,   retrenchment,\r\n\r\ndismissal  and assignment of duties were classified  as  matters\r\n\r\nnot   for   collective  bargaining  between  trade  unions   and\r\n\r\nemployers.   To  prevent  abuses  by  employers,  the  amendment\r\n\r\nprovided  for  workers and trade unions to seek redress  through\r\n\r\nconciliation and adjudication, including appeals against  unfair\r\n\r\ndismissal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislative amendments in 1968 also involved the\r\n\r\nrationalisation of the basic terms and conditions of  employment\r\n\r\nand the rights and obligations of employees under the Employment\r\n\r\nAct.   For  example, an employee would be entitled to two  days'\r\n\r\npay  for  work on a holiday instead of three days' pay  provided\r\n\r\nthe  employee  does  not  absent himself without  valid  grounds\r\n\r\nimmediately before and after the holiday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While employers were given the discretion to carry out\r\n\r\ntheir managerial functions without being subjected to collective\r\n\r\nbargaining, the right of trade unions to take industrial  action\r\n\r\nwas  not removed.  Such rights continue to be enshrined  in  the\r\n\r\nlaw.  The main difference is that a union, which intends to take\r\n\r\nstrike action, must first obtain the consent and mandate of  its\r\n\r\nmembers  through a secret ballot.  This requirement of a  secret\r\n\r\nballot  is  in line with the democratic principle that  such  an\r\n\r\nextreme  action  should  reflect the collective  wishes  of  the\r\n\r\nmembers.  The need to seek the mandate of members through secret\r\n\r\nballot  before an industrial action has also been introduced  in\r\n\r\nother  countries  such  as Malaysia, Australia  and  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to executives joining the rank-and-file unions,\r\n\r\nMembers  will recall that I had already, in reply  to  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang on 3rd August, informed the House that\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry  is  studying  the  issue.   We  have  convened   a\r\n\r\nTripartite Committee to consider how to bring our laws on  union\r\n\r\nmembership  up  to  date especially with  regard  to  executives\r\n\r\njoining  unions  and  the areas for which  union  representation\r\n\r\nshould be allowed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1968 amendments of the Employment Act and Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  Act succeeded to strike a fair and equitable  balance\r\n\r\nbetween the interest of workers and employers.  As a result,  we\r\n\r\nhave  enjoyed  more  than  30  years  of  harmonious  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations,  steady  economic  growth  and  higher  incomes   for\r\n\r\nworkers.  Our legal framework has been a key factor for BERI  to\r\n\r\nrank the Singapore workforce as No. 1 in the world for almost 20\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHence, we should only make changes which will better equip us to\r\n\r\ndeal with the evolving workforce and business environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister: did the trade\r\n\r\nunions  not  have all these rights before 1968:   the  right  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate  for  better  wages, the  right  to  be  consulted  on\r\n\r\ndismissals  and transfers, before the law was amended  in  1968?\r\n\r\nDid  they  not have these rights?  And were they not taken  away\r\n\r\nfrom them?  Is the Minister aware that the Senior Minister, some\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  said  in a BBC interview that he had  to  tell  the\r\n\r\nworkers  then that they should give up these rights because  the\r\n\r\nBritish  were  withdrawing their bases and it was necessary  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  do  something about its economic programme  which\r\n\r\nwould   be  affected  as  a  result  of  the  withdrawal?    The\r\n\r\nimplication, he said, was that they would be restored  once  the\r\n\r\neconomy  improved  and the situation made it  possible  for  the\r\n\r\nrights to be restored.  How long have the workers got to wait?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the right of workers to\r\n\r\nnegotiate for better wages is enshrined in the law.  That is our\r\n\r\nsystem  of  collective  bargaining and  it  is  being  exercised\r\n\r\nregularly  by workers as represented by their unions  when  they\r\n\r\nnegotiate  for their collective agreement.  None of  that  right\r\n\r\nhas  been  taken away or eroded.  With regard to  dismissal  and\r\n\r\ntransfer, I have already said in my main reply that this was  in\r\n\r\nfact  removed  for good reason because it was considered  to  be\r\n\r\nrightfully  the functions of management.  The way they  promote,\r\n\r\ntransfer,  hire,  retrench  or dismiss  employees  should  be  a\r\n\r\nmanagerial  decision or management function.  But  at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  we have provided a mechanism for employees who feel  that\r\n\r\nthey   are  wrongfully  dismissed  or  their  services  unfairly\r\n\r\nterminated to make an appeal to the Ministry for their cases  to\r\n\r\nbe  studied  and investigated and the Ministry would  then  take\r\n\r\naction  to ensure that if they were in fact wrongfully dismissed\r\n\r\nor their services unfairly terminated, they would be fairly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompensated or reinstated as the case warrants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the point he mentioned about what the Senior Minister\r\n\r\nstated,  I  did not have the exact context of what was  said  on\r\n\r\nthat  particular occasion.  But what I want to say here is  that\r\n\r\nwhatever changes that we make to our labour law must be  changes\r\n\r\nthat can help us to better compete in a globalising environment.\r\n\r\nYou  know that the world is undergoing rapid changes. There  are\r\n\r\nno longer barriers to movement of capital and technology.  If we\r\n\r\nwere  to  change our labour laws and as a result of the  change,\r\n\r\nintroduce   a  lot  more  confrontation,  adversarial  relations\r\n\r\nbetween  the unions representing the workers and the  employers,\r\n\r\nwe may, in effect, be putting ourselves at a disadvantage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 1968, our labour law had severe inherent\r\n\r\nweaknesses.   These weaknesses resulted in constant  bickerings,\r\n\r\nconfrontations  and disputes between the unions  and  employers.\r\n\r\nUnions were exploiting loopholes in the law.  Workers themselves\r\n\r\nwere also exploiting loopholes in the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give the Member an example. Prior to 1968, workers\r\n\r\ncould claim triple pay for working on a holiday.  The outcome of\r\n\r\nit  was  that  there  were many reported  instances  of  workers\r\n\r\nabsenting  themselves on the day before and the  day  after  the\r\n\r\nholiday, but turning up to work on the holiday itself to collect\r\n\r\ntriple pay.  So, in effect, he got two off-days for working  one\r\n\r\nday.   I do not think this kind of practice should be encouraged\r\n\r\nand  we proceeded to amend our law to plug such loopholes in the\r\n\r\nlaw.   I  think  what  we have today is a better  framework  for\r\n\r\nmanaging our industrial relations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, before 1968, the trade unions were not\r\n\r\nrequired  to  have  a  secret ballot before  they  took  extreme\r\n\r\nindustrial  action in launching a strike.  In fact,  many  trade\r\n\r\nunions  took action without securing a mandate first from  their\r\n\r\nmembers.  They called their union members out on strike  without\r\n\r\nany  due regard to the interest and welfare of the workers,  and\r\n\r\nthe consequences to the company. Trade unions in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthose  days,  before  the 1968 amendments,  also  intervened  on\r\n\r\nissues  which,  as  I have said earlier on,  should  rightly  be\r\n\r\nwithin  management domain, such as hiring, promotion,  transfer,\r\n\r\ndismissal  and  even the assignment of duties.  Those  were  the\r\n\r\ndays  where trade unions would confront and challenge  employers\r\n\r\nover  issues, such as redeployment of their members  within  the\r\n\r\ncompany.   I  do  not  think we should  try  to  reinstate  such\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  the  law because that would result  in  unending\r\n\r\ndisputes  between workers and the employers.  And this was  what\r\n\r\nhappened  in  the  60s. The legal framework  in  existence  then\r\n\r\nresulted  in  endless  disputes  leading  to  confrontation  and\r\n\r\nstrikes at the workplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give the Member an example. In 1955 alone, there\r\n\r\nwere 275 strikes, resulting in a loss of almost one million man-days.   In one year alone, there was a loss of one million  man-days.   In  1961, the industrial disputes also resulted  in  116\r\n\r\nstrikes,  and the loss of more than 400,000 man-days.  So,  that\r\n\r\nkind   of  legal  framework  resulted  in  an  adversarial   and\r\n\r\nconfrontational industrial relations climate.  I  do  not  think\r\n\r\nthat  will  equip  Singapore to deal  with  today's  competitive\r\n\r\neconomic  conditions.  If anything, perhaps the hon. Member  may\r\n\r\nbe  trying  to  hamper our economic prospects  by  advocating  a\r\n\r\nreturn  to  the  bad old days of industrial relations.   We  can\r\n\r\nsurmise what would be his reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is quite clear, obviously, is that in an adversarial\r\n\r\nand  confrontational  industrial relations climate,  very  often\r\n\r\npolitical  parties  are  able  to exploit  unhappy  trade  union\r\n\r\nmembers  and  even  the leadership, and this is  precisely  what\r\n\r\nhappened  in  the  60s  where political  parties  were  able  to\r\n\r\ninfluence  various trade unions and to use them  for  their  own\r\n\r\npolitical objective.  I am not saying that the hon. Member is in\r\n\r\nfact having such a strategy in mind.  But I am saying that if we\r\n\r\ntake  his advice and proceed to do what he is urging us  to  do,\r\n\r\nthen  we  are  likely to end up in a situation where  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement, instead of serving the welfare of the  workers,\r\n\r\ncould  well  end  up being an instrument to be used  to  advance\r\n\r\nother people's interest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand agenda, and not necessarily that of the workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, before I ask the Hon.

The\r\n\r\npoint  that  the first generation leaders of the PAP,  including\r\n\r\nthe   then  Secretary-General  and  Prime  Minister,  were  very\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  the  trade union movement does not  invalidate  my\r\n\r\npoint.  They were there to serve the interests and the rights of\r\n\r\nthe  workers  who had engaged their service, unlike  others  who\r\n\r\nwere  there  to use the trade unions and their organisations  to\r\n\r\nadvance  their  own  political agenda  at  the  expense  of  the\r\n\r\ninterests  and  the  rights  of the  workers.   So  there  is  a\r\n\r\ndifference.  And if the hon. Member is not aware of it, I  would\r\n\r\nurge  him to read Senior Minister's memoirs, because it  is  set\r\n\r\nout  quite clearly what the Senior Minister tried to do  in  his\r\n\r\nyounger days in championing the rights of the workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on unfair dismissal, this has been a question that he\r\n\r\nhas  trotted out at every opportunity, and since it is the  same\r\n\r\nquestion,  I  am bound to give him the same answer, because  the\r\n\r\nanswer  cannot vary just because he trots out the same  question\r\n\r\non  a  different occasion.  The answer is that workers who  feel\r\n\r\nthat they have been unfairly dismissed have a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvery  efficient and low cost mechanism to which they can  appeal\r\n\r\nto  seek  redress.  Our experience at the Ministry is  that  the\r\n\r\nmechanism has worked very well, in fact, over the last 30 years.\r\n\r\nWe  deal with thousands of cases a year, and our decisions  have\r\n\r\nalways  worked in the interest of both parties.   We  have  been\r\n\r\nable to secure a mutually satisfying resolution to many of these\r\n\r\ndisputes.   Whether it is unfair termination  or  dismissal,  we\r\n\r\nhave always been able, after conciliation, to reach an agreement\r\n\r\nbetween  the  employer and the employee in the vast majority  of\r\n\r\ncases.  So we see no reason now to proceed on a different  tack,\r\n\r\nthe one that is advocated by the hon. Member, to enact a new law\r\n\r\nfor  dealing with such cases.  We already have a mechanism  that\r\n\r\nworks,  a mechanism that is efficient, low-cost and expeditious.\r\n\r\nSo, why do we need to create a new framework?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ALEXANDRA HOSPITAL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Geriatric specialization services)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Dr S Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for Health whether there\r\n\r\nare  plans  to  develop  geriatric  specialization  services  at\r\n\r\nAlexandra Hospital.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   geriatric  services  have  been  developed  at  Alexandra\r\n\r\nHospital.

E-Stamping  will  replace  the  current\r\n\r\nphysical stamping of documents with franking machines or revenue\r\n\r\nstamps.   A stamp certificate will be issued on-line to  certify\r\n\r\nthat a dutiable instrument has  been duly stamped.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When fully implemented, E-stamping allows users, mainly\r\n\r\nlawyers and other tax agents, to e-stamp dutiable instruments in\r\n\r\nthe convenience of their own offices. E-Stamping also goes hand-in-hand  with electronic payment of stamp duty. This  would  not\r\n\r\nonly  minimize the exposure to risk related to manual processing\r\n\r\nof  dutiable  documents  and  payments,  but  also  enhance  the\r\n\r\nefficiency of collection of stamp duty.

It also requires a company's liquidator\r\n\r\nto   make  full  provisions  for  the  payment  of  duty  before\r\n\r\ndistributing the company's assets to shareholders.

In that  case,  the  judge\r\n\r\nsaid  that \"Every man is entitled if he can to order his affairs\r\n\r\nso  that  the tax attaching under the appropriate Acts  is  less\r\n\r\nthan it otherwise would be.

These principles apply even more  so  to\r\n\r\nstamp  duties  as  they  are  a tax on  documents  and  not  the\r\n\r\nunderlying transactions per se.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides encroaching on the above established principles,\r\n\r\nthe new provision also seems to me to be particularly antecedent\r\n\r\nto  the spirit of encouraging greater freedom and creativity  in\r\n\r\nthe  financial  sector  in Singapore.   Recently,  it  has  been\r\n\r\nrecognised  that there needs to be a radical change  in  mindset\r\n\r\ntowards  financial regulation in Singapore.   The  new  approach\r\n\r\nwill be central to the long term development of Singapore into a\r\n\r\nworld-class  financial hub.  It is hoped that the  change  would\r\n\r\nremove  the  self-imposed shackles on the financial institutions\r\n\r\nhere  and  lead to more new and creatively structured  financial\r\n\r\nproducts.  In view of this change in approach, it seems to me to\r\n\r\nbe  taking  a step backwards to give the Commissioner such  wide\r\n\r\npowers  in  an  area  that impacts on so  much  of  commerce  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the short and medium terms also, we must not forget\r\n\r\nthat  we  are still in a critical period of recovering from  the\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis  of  the  last two years.   Already  there  are\r\n\r\nobservations that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmomentum of corporate restructuring has slowed and companies are\r\n\r\nbecoming  less  committed to reform as the  short  term  outlook\r\n\r\nbecomes   better.   By  itself,  restructuring   involves   many\r\n\r\ndifficult  decisions, and companies should not be burdened  with\r\n\r\nthe additional uncertainty in this area of stamp duty planning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in achieving a particular commercial result, there may\r\n\r\nbe  many  different ways of structuring the transactions leading\r\n\r\nto  it.   Tax mitigation is admittedly one of the more important\r\n\r\nfactors  in  deciding which way to carry out  the  transactions.\r\n\r\nThe   proposed  section  33A  raises  concerns  as  to  how  the\r\n\r\nComptroller  or  the  Commissioner  will  view  such  commercial\r\n\r\nstructures,  some  of  which  have become  a  matter  of  common\r\n\r\npractice today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, an outright sale of a property by way of\r\n\r\nconveyance  will attract stamp duty ad valorem at  the  rate  of\r\n\r\napproximately  3%  of the consideration.   So  if  the  purchase\r\n\r\nconsideration is $1 million, the stamp duty chargeable is  about\r\n\r\n$30,000.  However, if the property is owned by a special purpose\r\n\r\ninvestment  holding company, the shareholders can sell  all  the\r\n\r\nshares  of  the company to the purchaser instead who  will  then\r\n\r\nobtain  effective  ownership and control of the  property.   The\r\n\r\nsale  of  the  shares will attract stamp duty at a substantially\r\n\r\nlower  rate  of  0.2% of the value of the  shares.   So  if  the\r\n\r\nproperty asset is valued at $1 million, but the company has bank\r\n\r\nborrowings  and  other liabilities of $500,000,  the  total  net\r\n\r\nvalue  of  the  shares  will be $500,000,  and  the  stamp  duty\r\n\r\nchargeable on the transfer of all the shares is only $1,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using this example, could the Minister clarify whether the\r\n\r\nexception  in  the  new  section  33A(3)(b)  might  help?   This\r\n\r\nsubsection  states that section 33A  \"shall  not  apply  to  any\r\n\r\narrangement carried out for bona fide commercial reasons and had\r\n\r\nnot  as  one  of its main purpose the avoidance or reduction  of\r\n\r\nduty\".   But in subsection (2), \"arrangement\" means \"any scheme,\r\n\r\ntrust, grant, covenant, agreement, disposition, transaction  and\r\n\r\nincludes  all  steps by which it is carried into effect.\"   Does\r\n\r\nthis mean that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of  Stamp  Duties will scrutinise  any  particular\r\n\r\nintermediate  step and rule that that particular step  has  been\r\n\r\nput  in  place for the purpose of reducing stamp duty?   In  the\r\n\r\nsale   of  property  example  above,  although  the  bona   fide\r\n\r\ncommercial  reason for the whole arrangement is the transfer  of\r\n\r\nthe  property, the main purpose of choosing a sale of the shares\r\n\r\nof the property-owning company, and not the property itself, may\r\n\r\nvery well be to reduce the amount of stamp duty payable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another example, for financing of a project development,\r\n\r\nthe  bank will usually take as security, among other things,  an\r\n\r\nassignment of the building contract, an assignment of  the  sale\r\n\r\nproceeds,  as  well as a mortgage over the land.  If  the  legal\r\n\r\nassignment were stamped as a primary security, it would  attract\r\n\r\nad  valorem duty at the rate of 3% of the contract value.  It is\r\n\r\nthus  common  for  banks to take the mortgage as  the  principal\r\n\r\nsecurity  and nominate the others as secondary security.   Stamp\r\n\r\nduty  on  mortgages is capped at $500, and the  other  documents\r\n\r\nwill attract nominal stamp duty of $10 each.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many more examples of stamp duty planning schemes\r\n\r\nwhich are widely used in commerce and by individuals to minimise\r\n\r\nthe  amount  of  stamp  duty payable, as allowed  by  law.   The\r\n\r\nbusiness  community is rightly anxious about the  new  provision\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  vague and silent about these tried  and  tested\r\n\r\nschemes.   Could  the  Minister clarify the  scope  of  the  new\r\n\r\nsection  33A and also place on record what would not  be  within\r\n\r\nits ambit?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like income tax, stamp duty is wholly a creature of\r\n\r\nstatute   and  it  is  an  established  principle  of  statutory\r\n\r\ninterpretation  that  clear  words  are  needed  to  impose  tax\r\n\r\nliability on a person, and that any ambiguity should be resolved\r\n\r\nin favour of the taxpayer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this point, I would have liked this Amendment Bill to\r\n\r\naddress  the  perennial  uncertainty in relation  to  the  share\r\n\r\nreconstruction exemptions under the present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsection  15 of the principal Stamp Duties Act.  Because  of  the\r\n\r\nuncertainty  in  the  definition of \"scheme of  reconstruction\",\r\n\r\nmany  companies and practitioners have had to write  in  to  the\r\n\r\nStamp  Duty  Office  to  seek  confirmation  as  to  whether   a\r\n\r\nparticular  restructuring exercise falls  within  the  exemption\r\n\r\nafforded by section 15.  Unfortunately, the criteria adopted  by\r\n\r\nthe  Stamp  Duty  Office appear to have shifted internally  over\r\n\r\ntime  and  now  include a condition that the restructured  group\r\n\r\nshould  not be publicly listed within two years after completion\r\n\r\nof  the  restructuring.  This is surely an  area  in  which  our\r\n\r\nexisting legislation is due for clarification.  In this  regard,\r\n\r\nwe  might look to the Hong Kong example, where under their Stamp\r\n\r\nDuties  Ordinance, there is much clearer and more  certain  \"90%\r\n\r\nshareholding\" rule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial transactions are of course extremely varied. I\r\n\r\nunderstand  it is not possible for the Minister to clarify  each\r\n\r\nand  every transaction in this House.  The Commissioner of Stamp\r\n\r\nDuties should therefore issue clear guidelines from time to time\r\n\r\non  the  provisions of the Act.  These measures are  crucial  in\r\n\r\nensuring  that  our  tax  laws  are  transparent  and  could  be\r\n\r\ninterpreted with a sufficient degree of certainty by  foreigners\r\n\r\nand  locals  alike.   I  believe a predictable  and  stable  tax\r\n\r\nenvironment is fundamental to the continued development  of  the\r\n\r\nfinancial and other business sectors in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not a tax\r\n\r\nexpert  like  the hon. Member Mr Ong Kian Min.  So  I  will  not\r\n\r\ntouch on the taxing aspects of this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see this Bill however as an opportunity to reform and\r\n\r\nstreamline  our  laws for the world of Internet trading  and  to\r\n\r\nprepare  our  country and our business and  public  sectors  for\r\n\r\nelectronic document and information management systems.  So even\r\n\r\nthough  this  Bill, as it stands before the House, is  primarily\r\n\r\none to deal with the physical attachment of E-stamps to physical\r\n\r\ndocuments through electronic processes, I would like to urge the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinister to perhaps look wider and further especially in  future\r\n\r\nexercises  to amend the Stamp Duties Act and the different  Acts\r\n\r\ndealing with taxes, duties and Government charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4, for example, deals with the stamping of\r\n\r\ndocuments.  And in the First Schedule of the main Act, there  is\r\n\r\nmention of the stamping of contract notes.  I would just like to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister if he would clarify if these  contract  notes\r\n\r\nwere  to  be  electronic, whether these would also  need  to  be\r\n\r\nstamped, or whether the duty would be waived.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a new section 6B proposed in clause 5 of the Bill,\r\n\r\nand this also deals primarily with the electronic procedures for\r\n\r\nthe  E-stamp  certificates  where  the  electronic  stamping  of\r\n\r\ndocuments  will  one  day  be possible for  documents  that  are\r\n\r\ncreated  online.  So if future developments lead  that  way,  as\r\n\r\nthey would especially when we have Internet stock trading and so\r\n\r\non,   then  there  would  be  a  need  to  perhaps  clarify  the\r\n\r\nterminology  of  this  provision when it  deals  with  the  word\r\n\r\n\"certificate\", for example, whether such certificates  could  be\r\n\r\nextended to electronic equivalents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently our Electronic Transactions Act does not permit\r\n\r\nmost  of the documents in the First Schedule of the Stamp Duties\r\n\r\nAct  to  be electronic.  But there could come a day when perhaps\r\n\r\neven  the  Ministry  of  Finance  finds  it  comfortable  to  do\r\n\r\nsomething like this in a paperless fashion.  Perhaps even  there\r\n\r\nmight  come  a  day  when the Government needs  to  include  new\r\n\r\ninstruments to be stamped, so I think there is a need to clarify\r\n\r\nif these certificates would one day be completely electronic and\r\n\r\nonline.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 30 of the Bill deals with certain powers for the\r\n\r\nCommissioner to exercise.  As the Minister has said, it is based\r\n\r\non  the  Income  Tax  Act and the powers of the  Comptroller  of\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax.   I think section 70C that is proposed,  especially\r\n\r\nsubsection (2), is a good provision to have in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis Bill and in the Income Tax Act and in any of the other  tax\r\n\r\nActs  that we have, in addition to any other Acts that deal with\r\n\r\ncustoms duties, excises, Government charges and fees, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe  reason I say this is that it makes it very clear  that  the\r\n\r\nComptroller or the Commissioner of each of these respective Acts\r\n\r\nhas  got the power to look at computer records.  By implication,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  computer records for tax purposes or  tax  documents\r\n\r\nare  permitted and legal in the law.  And I have to say this  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  because  there  is  a very  strong  misapprehension\r\n\r\namongst  many lawyers, auditors and businessmen that it is  fine\r\n\r\nto  have  an information technology-based information system  or\r\n\r\ndocument management system, but these systems are good only  for\r\n\r\nin-house  records.  But the moment you need  to  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nInland   Revenue   Authority  of  Singapore  and   the   Customs\r\n\r\nDepartment, you must produce paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, despite the provisions that we already have introduced\r\n\r\nin  the Electronic Transactions Act and Companies Act permitting\r\n\r\nelectronic   record  keeping,  such  people   still   have   the\r\n\r\nmisapprehension that they cannot do so and therefore it would be\r\n\r\ngood if the Minister could clarify at this opportunity presented\r\n\r\nbefore the House to clarify these points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the\r\n\r\nMember  for Pasir Ris GRC that the public should only pay  taxes\r\n\r\nin accordance with what the law requires, and no more.  However,\r\n\r\nI  would  point  out that stamp duty is an important  source  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  revenue.  In fiscal year 1998,  stamp  duties  worth\r\n\r\n$950  million  were  collected.  And in  fiscal  year  1997,  it\r\n\r\namounted to $1.7 billion.  The general anti-avoidance provision,\r\n\r\nwhich is similar to that of the Income Tax Act, is introduced to\r\n\r\nensure  that there are sufficient measures to safeguard  revenue\r\n\r\nand  to  deter parties from scheming to reduce or systematically\r\n\r\navoid  payment  of  stamp  duty on  dutiable  instruments.   The\r\n\r\nintroduction of new section 33A is neither to stifle  bona  fide\r\n\r\ncommercial transactions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnor  to hamper corporate restructuring.  It simply empowers  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  to  disregard  and  make  adjustments  to  certain\r\n\r\narrangements which are clearly carried out solely or principally\r\n\r\nto evade tax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax avoidance schemes are purely tax-driven with little or\r\n\r\nno  commercial value or rationale.  This is unlike tax  planning\r\n\r\nwhere  the  transactions or schemes have some commercial  basis,\r\n\r\nand  where  the  issue  is  structuring the  most  tax-efficient\r\n\r\narrangement   in   accordance  with  the  relevant   tax   laws.\r\n\r\nGenerally,  tax planning, if carried out within the confines  of\r\n\r\nexisting  laws,  would  not be caught  under  section  33A.   In\r\n\r\nassessing whether a particular scheme or arrangement would  fall\r\n\r\nunder  the  ambit of section 33A of the Act, the Inland  Revenue\r\n\r\nAuthority  would  amongst other things look at the  presence  of\r\n\r\nartificiality or contrived transactions to reduce or  avoid  tax\r\n\r\nliabilities but which have little or no commercial basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress that the aim of the new section is\r\n\r\nto  reduce blatant or contrived tax avoidance arrangements which\r\n\r\ncan  lead  to  systematic or significant revenue losses  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   It  is not intended to affect genuine  and  normal\r\n\r\ncommercial   transactions,   but  because   anti-tax   avoidance\r\n\r\ntransactions  are  getting more complex  that  the  Commissioner\r\n\r\nneeds  a  general  anti-avoidance provision  to  enable  him  to\r\n\r\neffectively  counter  tax avoidance, and  also  to  serve  as  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent  in  order to safeguard revenue.  Members  may  recall\r\n\r\nthat  this same issue was debated in the House in 1988 when  the\r\n\r\ncurrent anti-avoidance provision was put in place in the  Income\r\n\r\nTax  Act.   The concerns then were that this would  be  a  major\r\n\r\nimpediment  to  the  development of our commercial  enterprises.\r\n\r\nBut  the  concerns have proved unfounded.  Since 1988, IRAS  has\r\n\r\nnot   seen   the  need  to  invoke  the  general  anti-avoidance\r\n\r\nprovision.   Thus,  it  has  been very  effective  simply  as  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent.  Likewise, section 33A in the Stamp Duties  Act  will\r\n\r\nnot be invoked unless it is absolutely necessary.  To reduce any\r\n\r\nuncertainty,  IRAS  would  also  be  prepared  to   assist   any\r\n\r\nindividual\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor  company wishing to consult them on specific transactions  as\r\n\r\nto  whether their transactions would fall under the ambit of the\r\n\r\nnew  section  33A,  provided details  of  the  transactions  are\r\n\r\nclearly presented to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has given two scenarios to illustrate his\r\n\r\npoints.  In a property sale example, the purchaser may choose to\r\n\r\nacquire  all shares of the company owning the property  and  pay\r\n\r\nthe  lower  stamp duty of 0.2%.  However, if it is  subsequently\r\n\r\nproven  that  the purchaser has schemed with the seller  to  pay\r\n\r\nstamp  duties at a lower rate, such a scheme would  fall  within\r\n\r\nsection  33A.   This could arise, for instance, when  many  such\r\n\r\nspecial  purpose  property  holding companies  are  set  up  and\r\n\r\nfrequently traded, amongst other factors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member's other example on the financing\r\n\r\nscheme  for  project  development,  the  borrower  is  assigning\r\n\r\ncertain  assets  to the bank as a security.  If the  assets  are\r\n\r\nreconveyed  back  to the borrower upon full  settlement  of  the\r\n\r\nloan, such an assignment by way of security is stamped with  the\r\n\r\nmortgage  duty  and capped at $500, and not the  3%  ad  valorem\r\n\r\nstamp  duty.   The 3% conveyance duty is applied only  when  the\r\n\r\nassignment is effectively a sale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 15 of the Stamp Duties Act provides relief from\r\n\r\npayment  of  ad  valorem duty on transfers made  pursuant  to  a\r\n\r\nscheme  of  reconstruction or amalgamation.  The  concession  is\r\n\r\ngranted on the principle that there is no substantial change  in\r\n\r\nownership  after the reconstruction.  Hence a key criterion  for\r\n\r\nremission is that at least 90% of a company must be involved  in\r\n\r\none  single  reorganisation exercise.  To prevent abuse  of  the\r\n\r\nstamp duty remission, a two-year freeze on the ownership is also\r\n\r\nimposed  on  the restructured companies and to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nbeneficial  interest  in  the  shares  or  undertaking  acquired\r\n\r\nremains substantially with the same people.  Hence the condition\r\n\r\nthat the restructured group should not be publicly listed within\r\n\r\ntwo years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criteria in section 15 are constantly reviewed and\r\n\r\nrevised,  if  necessary, to meet the changing circumstances  and\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the business community.  Successful applicants  under\r\n\r\nsection  15  only  pay  a fixed duty of $10  on  each  transfer.\r\n\r\nWhereas  a  transfer of an undertaking consisting  of  immovable\r\n\r\nproperties  and shares will attract stamp duty at  3%  and  0.2%\r\n\r\nrespectively  on  the  value  of  the  undertaking  sold.   This\r\n\r\nrepresents substantial savings.  In order that the concession is\r\n\r\nnot  open to abuse, it is essential that the applicants  make  a\r\n\r\nformal  application  setting out the scheme  together  with  all\r\n\r\nrelevant  documents to justify that the restructuring  qualifies\r\n\r\nunder  the relevant sections.  Hence, the need to make a  formal\r\n\r\napplication in writing.  There have been cases where claims  for\r\n\r\nsection  15 were made despite that the conditions spelt out  for\r\n\r\nremission were not met.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Hong Kong, the relief is confined to\r\n\r\nconveyance  between  associated bodies,  and  does  not  include\r\n\r\namalgamation  between  unassociated parties.   To  qualify,  one\r\n\r\ncorporate  must  own at least 90% of the issued capital  of  the\r\n\r\nother.   To our knowledge, adjudication is also required in  the\r\n\r\nHong Kong legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members can be assured that IRAS will assist and advise\r\n\r\ncompanies seeking their assistance on specific transactions.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  IRAS  regularly liaises with lawyers and  tax  agents  of\r\n\r\ncompanies on matters relating to corporate restructuring.   Many\r\n\r\nof them are well aware of the conditions governing exemptions or\r\n\r\nremissions  of stamp duties.  They are made transparent  to  all\r\n\r\napplicants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now refer to the questions raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nAljunied  GRC.   Presently,  stamp  duty  is  payable  only   on\r\n\r\ninstruments  effecting transfers, sales,  leases,  mortgages  of\r\n\r\nimmovable properties as well as stocks and shares.  I assume the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member is therefore making reference to contract notes  on\r\n\r\nstocks and shares.  If an electronic contract\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnote  or  any  other electronic instrument is an instrument  for\r\n\r\nstamp   duty  purposes,  it  will  accordingly  attract  duties.\r\n\r\nHowever,  for the Member's information, stamp duty for  contract\r\n\r\nnotes  for  stocks and shares is currently suspended until  30th\r\n\r\nJune 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to whether the definition of \"stamp\r\n\r\ncertificate\"  is  too  restrictive, let me  briefly  explain  to\r\n\r\nMembers  how  the  E-Stamping system works.   E-Stamping  is  an\r\n\r\nintegrated electronic system on the Internet.  The whole process\r\n\r\nis  performed  electronically, starting with the  submission  of\r\n\r\ndocument details, computation of duty and late penalty, followed\r\n\r\nby  electronic payment and ending with the issuing of the  stamp\r\n\r\ncertificate electronically.  The stamp certificate is issued on-line and users can choose to store the records electronically or\r\n\r\nin printed format at their premises.  Thus the E-Stamping system\r\n\r\ncan be easily extended to all on-line instruments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to thank the Member for his suggestion to\r\n\r\ninclude a provision similar to section 70C(2) in the other Acts,\r\n\r\nsuch as the Income Tax Act, the GST Act and the Customs Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to inform Members that there are currently\r\n\r\nprovisions  under the Income Tax Act and the GST  Act  to  allow\r\n\r\ntaxpayers  to keep their records electronically.  IRAS  has,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  in  consultation with the Institute of  Certified  Public\r\n\r\nAccountants in Singapore, issued two sets of guidelines in  July\r\n\r\n1999.  As long as these criteria are met, taxpayers can apply to\r\n\r\nthe Income Tax authority to keep their records electronically.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the Customs Act provides for the Director-General of Customs to permit records to be kept electronically.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PUBLIC UTILITIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon\r\n\r\nYeo):   Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill  be  now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Act empowers the Public Utilities\r\n\r\nBoard (PUB) to discharge its roles as the Water Authority and as\r\n\r\nthe  Regulatory  Authority  of the  electricity  and  piped  gas\r\n\r\nindustries in Singapore.  This Act was last amended in 1995 when\r\n\r\nthe electricity and gas operations of PUB were corporatised.  In\r\n\r\nthe last four years, we have gained experience in the regulation\r\n\r\nof   the  electricity  industry  and  some  amendments  to   the\r\n\r\nlegislation are needed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed are mainly to:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) put in place further regulatory measures in the\r\n\r\nevolving electricity industry and to address the industry's need\r\n\r\nfor high quality electricity supply;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) increase the penalty for the offence of damaging a\r\n\r\nhigh-voltage electricity cable;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) protect the property rights of the Board and\r\n\r\nfacilitate the maintenance of water mains; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) protect the interest of consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first go through the amendments that are required in\r\n\r\nthe  Board's  function  as  the  Regulatory  Authority  for  the\r\n\r\nelectricity and gas industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Regulation of Supply</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there is no provision in the Act to regulate\r\n\r\nthe  supply  of electricity generated outside Singapore  to  any\r\n\r\nperson  or  premises in Singapore, or the supply of  electricity\r\n\r\ngenerated  in  Singapore  to  any  person  or  premises  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.   It  is  proposed  that the  present  definition  of\r\n\r\n\"supply\"  in section 2 of the existing Act be amended to  enable\r\n\r\nthe PUB to regulate such supply of electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWith this amendment, without being licensed by the PUB to do so,\r\n\r\nno  person may supply electricity generated outside Singapore to\r\n\r\nany  person  or premises in Singapore, and no person may  supply\r\n\r\nelectricity  generated in Singapore to any  person  or  premises\r\n\r\noutside Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Power Dips & Cable Damage</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback from industry indicates that companies,\r\n\r\nparticularly those in high-tech industries which rely heavily on\r\n\r\nsensitive  computerised  control systems,  have  been  adversely\r\n\r\naffected  by voltage dips in their power supply.  Voltage  dips,\r\n\r\nunlike  power outages or blackouts, are momentary reductions  of\r\n\r\nthe voltage levels in the power supply system, which can disrupt\r\n\r\nthe functions of sensitive computerised control systems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voltage dips occur some 25-30 times a year. They have a\r\n\r\nsevere   impact  on  some  industries,  particularly  high-tech,\r\n\r\nprocess   industries   like  the  wafer  fabrication   industry.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Economic Development Board (EDB), voltage  dip-related  losses  suffered  by five high-tech  companies  between\r\n\r\nAugust 1997 and November 1998 amounted to some $3 million.  This\r\n\r\nfigure  does not include the cost of production downtime, labour\r\n\r\nand  delayed  product deliveries.  The production  downtime  can\r\n\r\namount  to  as  much  as 10% of the monthly output  of  a  wafer\r\n\r\nfabrication company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, 57% of voltage dip complaints arose because of\r\n\r\ncable  damage.   Although the number of voltage dips  caused  by\r\n\r\ncable damage is relatively small (5 out of 36 in 1996, 2 out  of\r\n\r\n21  in  1997 and 4 out of 30 in 1998), the effect of such damage\r\n\r\nto  high-voltage cables can be major.  For Singapore to continue\r\n\r\nto  attract  high-tech,  knowledge-based activities  like  wafer\r\n\r\nfabrication, we must ensure the high quality and reliability  of\r\n\r\nour power supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To minimise damage to high-voltage cables in the course of\r\n\r\nconstruction  work,  section 95 of the Act will  be  amended  to\r\n\r\ndifferentiate the requirements for earthworks in the vicinity of\r\n\r\nlow-voltage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nelectricity  cables from those in the vicinity  of  high-voltage\r\n\r\nelectricity cables.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new section 95(A) is proposed to require PowerGrid Ltd,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  the  owner  of high-voltage electricity  cables,  and\r\n\r\ncontractors to work together to prevent damage to cables.   This\r\n\r\nnew  section  will regulate earthworks and cable detection  work\r\n\r\nwithin the vicinity of any high-voltage electricity cable  which\r\n\r\nbelongs  to  or which is under the management or  control  of  a\r\n\r\npublic   electricity  licensee.   Offenders  face  a  fine   not\r\n\r\nexceeding  $100,000, or imprisonment for a  term  not  exceeding\r\n\r\nfive years, or both fine and imprisonment, if they do not follow\r\n\r\nthe legislated procedures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The serious consequence to the economy as a result of\r\n\r\ndamage  to high-voltage cables makes a severe penalty necessary.\r\n\r\nA  deterrent  penalty  of $1 million is therefore  proposed  for\r\n\r\ndamage  to a high-voltage cable.  Section 107(3) will be amended\r\n\r\nto  enhance  the  current fine of $200,000 to $1  million.   The\r\n\r\nenhanced   fine  is  the  same  as  that  provided   under   the\r\n\r\nTelecommunication  Authority  of  Singapore  Act  for   damaging\r\n\r\ntelephone  cables.   At  the  present  level  of  penalty,  some\r\n\r\ncontractors  are  tempted to risk hitting a  cable  rather  than\r\n\r\nsuffer project delay and payment of liquidated damages.  A  fine\r\n\r\nof $1 million will deter such irresponsible behaviour.  With the\r\n\r\namendments,  offenders will face a maximum fine of  $1  million,\r\n\r\nimprisonment  for  five years, or both.  The  maximum  five-year\r\n\r\nterm  of  imprisonment for high-voltage cable damage remains  as\r\n\r\nbefore.  At the same time, section 95 as amended will reduce the\r\n\r\nmaximum  term  of imprisonment for damaging a low voltage  cable\r\n\r\nfrom three years to 12 months, as this is less serious.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from a deterrent penalty, we will require reasonable\r\n\r\nprecautions  to be taken against damage to high-voltage  cables.\r\n\r\nThese  are covered in the amendments to section 69.  Firstly,  a\r\n\r\npublic   electricity  licensee  which  lays   any   high-voltage\r\n\r\nelectricity  cable on any private land or premises will  have  a\r\n\r\nduty to:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) insulate and encase the electricity cable in such a\r\n\r\nmanner  as  to  effectively  protect  it  and  prevent  it  from\r\n\r\nconstituting a source of danger;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) mark the location of the electricity cable in the\r\n\r\nprescribed manner; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) notify the owner or occupier of such private land or\r\n\r\npremises  of  the  location  of the electricity  cable  and  the\r\n\r\nprecautions to be taken if any earthworks are to be carried  out\r\n\r\non such land or premises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it will be an offence for any person to\r\n\r\nobliterate, remove, damage, alter or tamper with any mark placed\r\n\r\nby a public electricity licensee wilfully and without reasonable\r\n\r\nexcuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Administrative Amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other amendments of an administrative nature\r\n\r\npertaining  to the electricity industry.  A new subsection  (3A)\r\n\r\nis  added  to  section  47 to ensure that a  public  electricity\r\n\r\nlicensee authorised to generate, transmit or supply electricity,\r\n\r\ndoes not or omits to do any act, whether directly or indirectly,\r\n\r\nto  jeopardise the security and stability of electricity supply.\r\n\r\nA  new subsection (4A) is added to section 50 making it the duty\r\n\r\nof  a  public electricity licensee to comply with any  direction\r\n\r\nthat the PUB may give to it from time to time for the purpose of\r\n\r\nregulating  the  prices to be charged by  the  licensee  to  any\r\n\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Access to Water Mains</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more effective management of Singapore's water supply\r\n\r\nsystem,  a  new section 32A will facilitate the speedy  repair\r\n\r\nand  maintenance  of water mains.  This new section  32A  will\r\n\r\nempower  the  PUB to require the removal of any  structure  or\r\n\r\nsubstance that is likely to hinder or obstruct access  to  any\r\n\r\nwater  main  or  connecting pipe belonging to  the  PUB.   The\r\n\r\nproposed amendments to the Public Utilities Act will give  the\r\n\r\nPUB  the  scope to perform better its functions as Singapore's\r\n\r\nWater  Authority  and  as  the  Regulatory  Authority  of  the\r\n\r\nelectricity and gas industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto  express  my  support for the Public Utilities  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill presented by the Minister for Trade and Industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me first to declare my interest that I am a board\r\n\r\nmember  of  the  Public  Utilities Board.   One  of  the  main\r\n\r\nobjectives  of  the  proposed amendments is  to  minimise  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  incidents  of damage to underground  high  voltage\r\n\r\nelectricity  cables.  It is my understanding that the  damages\r\n\r\nto  the  cables  in  the  past have  been  largely  caused  by\r\n\r\nearthwork contractors in the course of construction work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damage to these cables would cause voltage dips to be\r\n\r\nfelt  over large areas and the effect is felt island-wide when\r\n\r\nthe  damage is to 230 kv cables.  The extent of the impact  is\r\n\r\nevidenced  by the disproportionately large number  of  voltage\r\n\r\ndip  complaints received relative to the incidents which  give\r\n\r\nrise to the voltage dips.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister has explained at length, the impact on\r\n\r\nhigh-tech  industries  due  to such  voltage  fluctuations  is\r\n\r\nparticularly  severe.  Feedback from industry  indicates  that\r\n\r\nthe production facilities of high-tech companies such as wafer\r\n\r\nfab    companies,   sensitive   micro-electronics    component\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  and  others are highly susceptible  to  voltage\r\n\r\ndips   caused   by   damage   to  underground   cables.    The\r\n\r\ninterruptions  of  electricity supply upset  these  companies'\r\n\r\nproduction  schedules and delivery commitments and  result  in\r\n\r\ncostly  losses  in production time and work in progress  items\r\n\r\nwhich often have to be discarded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for us to be able to continue to attract high\r\n\r\ntechnology and high value-added investments into Singapore, we\r\n\r\nhave  to  ensure  that the quality of our  electricity  supply\r\n\r\nremains  consistently  high.   The  proposed  legislation   as\r\n\r\npresented  by the Minister is therefore necessary and  timely.\r\n\r\nIt would require the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nearthwork  contractors and PowerGrid Limited  which  owns  the\r\n\r\nelectricity  cable  network to work  together  to  proactively\r\n\r\nprevent damage to the electricity cables.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support this Amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nin  the  light  of deregulation of electricity supply  in  our\r\n\r\nnation, it is inevitable that the regulations are changing  to\r\n\r\nsuit the new operating environment.  Hence, I can see this new\r\n\r\nPublic  Utilities (Amendment) Bill will serve to provide  more\r\n\r\nprecise   definition   and   to   place   more   duties    and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities on the public electricity licensees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3A in particular requires the licensees to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  they  would not do any act that would adversely  affect,\r\n\r\ndirectly   or  indirectly,  the  security  and  stability   of\r\n\r\nelectricity  supply.  As the Minister presented earlier,  this\r\n\r\nis  an  important point because Singapore is a  modern  nation\r\n\r\nwhich cannot afford to have major voltage dips or blackouts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill goes further in section 69 to ensure that the\r\n\r\npublic electricity licensee maintain the cables with due  care\r\n\r\nand  protection  and to mark out the location  of  electricity\r\n\r\ncables  in some prescribed form.  And this is a very  positive\r\n\r\nstep   forward   towards  more  manageable   and   predictable\r\n\r\nunderground  excavation and earthwork as  broadly  defined  in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill.   Until now, there have been grievances  that  the\r\n\r\nlocation maps of the underground cables, especially those laid\r\n\r\na  long  time ago, during the British days, are very  big  and\r\n\r\ninaccurate.  Mishaps often occur when excavations  took  place\r\n\r\nat   locations  not  suspected  of  underground  cables.   The\r\n\r\nprescribed  manner stated in section 2B(b), I hope,  would  be\r\n\r\nakin  to something like a chartered survey map, and not  those\r\n\r\nthat would make reference to, for example, the nearest tree or\r\n\r\nfire hydrant.  This latter method suffers from the shortcoming\r\n\r\nof  losing  the  location  of the cables  when  the  so-called\r\n\r\nreference tree or fire hydrant is removed.  Hence, it  follows\r\n\r\nnaturally that in new section 95, it is a requirement to  have\r\n\r\ncable detection works carried out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprior  to  any  earthwork at the low and  high  voltage  cable\r\n\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill particularly spells out a new procedure for\r\n\r\nexcavation  near  high voltage cables.  It requires  a  proper\r\n\r\nnotice   to  be  served  on  the  licensee  before  commencing\r\n\r\nexcavation  and  to get information from the licensee  on  the\r\n\r\nlocations  of  the high voltage cables.  Of course,  it  is  a\r\n\r\nrequirement  to  engage licensed cable  detection  workers  to\r\n\r\nperform detection work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 95A(5) further requires a licensee to\r\n\r\npromptly give the location of the high voltage cables  to  the\r\n\r\nperson  who  serves the notice and to advise on the precaution\r\n\r\nto  be  taken  to  avoid  damage  to  the  cables.  With  this\r\n\r\nprovision, it now becomes reasonable for the person performing\r\n\r\nthe excavation to follow the procedures set out in section 95A\r\n\r\nand he now has a defence in court when charged for damaging  a\r\n\r\ncable.  This is well and good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have four queries. The Bill requires one to\r\n\r\nserve  notice on the licensee if he is to carry out excavation\r\n\r\nnear high voltage cables.  But how would he know that it is  a\r\n\r\nhigh  voltage  cable area?  Secondly, which licensee  does  it\r\n\r\nbelong  to?  And thirdly, what if the licensee  disclaims  the\r\n\r\naccuracy of the information he gives to the person who carries\r\n\r\nout  the  excavation, and this is often done?   Fourthly,  how\r\n\r\ncapable  are  the  cable detection workers and  what  kind  of\r\n\r\nliabilities do they have?  What would be considered reasonable\r\n\r\nperformance of a cable detection worker?  This amendment would\r\n\r\nbe  more  complete if it can answer the above four  questions,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  last  one  whereby a  person  performing  the\r\n\r\nearthwork   may  be  deemed  not  to  have  taken   reasonable\r\n\r\nprecaution  and exercised due diligence to avoid the  offence,\r\n\r\nshould a cable detection worker be found negligent in carrying\r\n\r\nout his work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deterrent penalty for damaging a high voltage cable\r\n\r\nis raised to $1 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  jail  sentence remains the same at five years.  It  would\r\n\r\nonly  be reasonable if the Bill would further define this area\r\n\r\nto avoid any doubt or any presumption of guilt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, please let me now switch from speaking\r\n\r\non  electricity cable to water mains.  This new Amendment Bill\r\n\r\nintroduces a new section 32A which basically requires  one  to\r\n\r\nremove  any structure, object or accumulation that  exists  in\r\n\r\nthe  vicinity of a water main or connecting pipe if the  Board\r\n\r\ndeems  that  it  hinders or obstructs access.   I  think  this\r\n\r\nclause  is  far  too  broad.   It does  not  define  the  word\r\n\r\n\"vicinity\"  nor the words \"hinder access\".  If an  underground\r\n\r\npipe  is to burst near an existing home and the easiest access\r\n\r\ncan  be  obtained by demolishing part of the  house,  then  it\r\n\r\nappears  that  this amendment would apply and the  poor  house\r\n\r\nowner will, at his own cost, move out of the house or hold  on\r\n\r\nto  the house to facilitate access.  Another possible scenario\r\n\r\nhere  is  this. When a house owner engages an architect  whose\r\n\r\ndesign  happens  to infringe this condition,  because  of  the\r\n\r\nweakness  of  this  clause, then who is  responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nremoval  of the structure?  Is it the architect or  the  house\r\n\r\nowner?   Would  this  clause be precise enough  for  insurance\r\n\r\npurposes if the architect is to carry a professional liability\r\n\r\ninsurance policy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having made the above comments, I wish that the Minister\r\n\r\nwould consider them before legislating the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just\r\n\r\nwant to make a short clarification. I understand the Amendment\r\n\r\nBill is to severely punish contractors who damage high voltage\r\n\r\ncables.   How  about  a  power supply company  that  causes  a\r\n\r\nvoltage  dip which is equally damaging to the economy and  the\r\n\r\ncompany  concerned as well? I would like to know what  is  the\r\n\r\npenalty.   I  believe that it is in the Bill.  How  about  for\r\n\r\nthose voltage dip cases which the Minister cited just now that\r\n\r\nwere  not  caused  by  damaged cable?  For  those  cases,  was\r\n\r\npenalty  imposed on PowerGrid and, if so, what was the penalty\r\n\r\nimposed?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nthank the Members for their support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chuang Shaw Peng asked how would an earthwork\r\n\r\ncontractor  know  that he is in the vicinity of  high  voltage\r\n\r\ncables.   He  has to find out from the licensee, which  means,\r\n\r\nPowerGrid Private Limited and PowerGrid is under an obligation\r\n\r\nto   speedily  provide  the  detailed  information   and   the\r\n\r\ninformation must be detailed to enable the cables which are in\r\n\r\nthe vicinity to be accurately marked out by licensed detection\r\n\r\nworkers.   Which licensee?  There is only one right now  which\r\n\r\nis  PowerGrid.   They  own  all the  high  voltage  cables  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chuang asked what happens if the licensee disclaims\r\n\r\nthe accuracy of the information he provides to the contractor.\r\n\r\nHe  cannot.  Under the law, he is required to provide accurate\r\n\r\ninformation.  As for the training of cable detection  workers,\r\n\r\nthis  is  done  by  PowerGrid.  In fact, under  its  licensing\r\n\r\nconditions,  it  is responsible to provide training  on  cable\r\n\r\ndetection and the person would only be granted a licence as  a\r\n\r\ncable  detection worker if he has successfully  completed  the\r\n\r\nprescribed  course  conducted  by  PowerGrid  and  holds   the\r\n\r\nrequired  qualifications and relevant experience.   Mr  Chuang\r\n\r\nthen  asked  what if the licensed cable detection  worker  was\r\n\r\nnegligent.  I think, if this can be established legally,  that\r\n\r\nshould be a defence for the contractor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the amendment to the section on water mains, to\r\n\r\nbegin  with,  structures or objects should not  in  the  first\r\n\r\nplace  be  built or positioned in such a way that water  mains\r\n\r\ncannot be maintained or repaired.  When we talk about \"in  the\r\n\r\nvicinity  of  water mains\", it is with respect to  whether  it\r\n\r\naffects the ability of PUB to maintain or repair these  mains.\r\n\r\nMr Chuang also asked in the event that the architect designs a\r\n\r\nstructure  which  causes an obstruction, then  who  should  be\r\n\r\nliable?   That  really  is a private  matter  to  be  resolved\r\n\r\nbetween   the  owner  and  his  architect.  Equally,   whether\r\n\r\ninsurance  should  cover such liabilities is  also  a  private\r\n\r\nmatter, defined in contract.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked whether the power supply company\r\n\r\nis under an obligation to provide reliable power.  Yes,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey are.  As to what the penalty involves, I do not have them\r\n\r\nwith me here now.

Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Objective</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Building Control Act to put in\r\n\r\nplace measures to minimise incidents of falling air-conditioning\r\n\r\nunits from certain premises or buildings.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rationale</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1994, 8 cases of fallen air-conditioning units have\r\n\r\nbeen  reported.   Out  of the 8 cases, 7  occurred  because  the\r\n\r\nwooden frames these units were mounted on have decayed over  the\r\n\r\nyears.  These 7 cases occurred in populated HDB estates.  It was\r\n\r\nfortunate that no one was injured or killed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have introduced several measures since 1990 to\r\n\r\nforestall  the  problem of falling air-conditioning  units.   We\r\n\r\nrequired  all  new air-conditioning units in  HDB  flats  to  be\r\n\r\nmounted  properly  on stainless steel brackets.   An  additional\r\n\r\nmeasure  was  introduced in 1997 to ensure that trained  workers\r\n\r\nwere engaged to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninstall new air-conditioning units.  This is to ensure that  the\r\n\r\nunits  were  properly installed so as to minimise  the  risk  of\r\n\r\nfalling  air-conditioning  units  due  to  poor  workmanship  in\r\n\r\ninstallation.   However,  the stock of wooden  frames  installed\r\n\r\nbefore  these  measures were introduced will remain  substantial\r\n\r\nfor  some  time to come.  These air-conditioning units therefore\r\n\r\nrepresent a growing risk to the public as the condition  of  the\r\n\r\nframes  deteriorates with time.  To minimise the possibility  of\r\n\r\nfurther  accidents  from  happening,  wooden  frames  should  be\r\n\r\nreplaced  with  properly-installed brackets  made  of  stainless\r\n\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Main Features of the Bill</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now elaborate on the main features of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 names the Bill as the Building Control (Amendment)\r\n\r\nAct 1999.  The clause also allows the Minister to bring the Bill\r\n\r\ninto operation by notification in the Gazette.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 addresses the meaning of \"air-conditioning unit\"\r\n\r\nfor  the purpose of the Building Control Act.  In addition,  the\r\n\r\nclause  also  transfers  the definition  of  the  \"Building  and\r\n\r\nControl  Authority\" and \"trained workers\" from the  Schedule  to\r\n\r\nthe  main  Act for the purpose of the new provisions  regulating\r\n\r\nair-conditioning works which I shall elaborate on later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As air-conditioning units do not affect the structural\r\n\r\nintegrity  of a building and their installations are  considered\r\n\r\nreally  to  be  minor works, clause 3 continues to  exempt  air-conditioning  works  from Part II of the Building  Control  Act.\r\n\r\nThat  is,  there  is  no  need  to  submit  building  plans  for\r\n\r\ninstalling air-conditioning units to the BCA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now elaborate on the main provisions\r\n\r\nregulating  the  installation  of air-conditioning  units  under\r\n\r\nclause 4 of the Bill.  Clause 4 introduces a new Part IIA to  be\r\n\r\ninserted into the Building Control Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>New Part IIA</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Part IIA contains six sections. New section 21A limits\r\n\r\nthe application of the Part to air-conditioning units that would\r\n\r\npose   a  danger  to  the  public.   As  air-conditioning  units\r\n\r\ninstalled  in landed properties would not pose a danger  to  the\r\n\r\nsafety  of  the  general  public, these are  exempted  from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of this Part.  The same goes for units that  do  not\r\n\r\nprotrude outwards from buildings or premises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 21B makes it mandatory for any person who\r\n\r\ndesires  to install air-conditioning units to engage a  \"trained\r\n\r\nworker\"  to  properly  install  the  air-conditioning  unit.   A\r\n\r\ntrained  worker  holds  a  certificate  from  the  Building  and\r\n\r\nConstruction  Authority for the installation of air-conditioning\r\n\r\nunits.    This   section  consolidates  what  we  have   already\r\n\r\nintroduced  in  1997,  to  prevent  accidents  of  falling  air-conditioning units due to poor workmanship in installation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions I have elaborated so far cover air-conditioning units that are to be installed. I will now move on\r\n\r\nto section 21C which deals with existing air-conditioning units.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have previously issued advices to many flat\r\n\r\nowners to retrofit existing wooden air-conditioning frames  with\r\n\r\nproperly-installed brackets made of approved  material,  namely,\r\n\r\nstainless steel, many air-conditioning unit owners have not been\r\n\r\nforthcoming  in taking up the advice.  Currently,  about  45,000\r\n\r\nair-conditioning  units in HDB estates  and  under  20,000  air-conditioning  units  in private estates are  mounted  on  wooden\r\n\r\nframes.  These would pose a danger to the general public as  the\r\n\r\nwooden  frames  deteriorate over time.   As  such,  section  21C\r\n\r\nrequires  the  owner  of  the building or  premises  where  air-conditioning units are mounted on wooden frames to replace these\r\n\r\nframes  with  properly-installed stainless  steel  brackets.   A\r\n\r\ngrace  period of one year from the date of commencement of  this\r\n\r\nAct  will  be given to the owner of the building or premises  to\r\n\r\ncarry out the retrofitting works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 21D allows the Commissioner of Building Control\r\n\r\nto  require  retrofitting  works for any  other  dangerous  air-conditioning units.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 21E provides in the main body of the Act an\r\n\r\nexisting  requirement  that  the  trained  worker  shall,   upon\r\n\r\ncompletion of the installation or retrofitting works,  submit  a\r\n\r\nproperly  completed installation report to the  Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nBuilding Control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties for any person who contravenes section\r\n\r\n21B(1), 21C, 21D or 21E(1) are prescribed in new section 21F  of\r\n\r\nthe  Building Control Act.  Under this section, any  person  who\r\n\r\ncontravenes or fails to comply with the said provisions shall be\r\n\r\nguilty  of an offence and shall be liable upon conviction  to  a\r\n\r\nfine  not  exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for  a  term  not\r\n\r\nexceeding six months or to both.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 allows the Minister to make regulations in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  the installation and retrofitting works  for  air-conditioning  units.   The Minister can  also  make  regulations\r\n\r\nstipulating  the  duties  and responsibilities  of  the  trained\r\n\r\nworkers in carrying out their works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequential amendments are made under clause 6 of the\r\n\r\nBill,  which tidies up the references to air-conditioning  units\r\n\r\nmade under the existing Schedule to the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the Bill is necessary to protect the general\r\n\r\npublic from the potential injury that could be caused by falling\r\n\r\nair-conditioning units.  Although we could also let the  problem\r\n\r\nresolve  itself as the older air-conditioning units  mounted  on\r\n\r\nwooden  frames  break down and are replaced by  new  and  better\r\n\r\nsupporting  structures, we are concerned that further  accidents\r\n\r\nmight  occur.   The  Bill is thus introduced to  accelerate  the\r\n\r\nreplacement  process and ensure a safer environment,  especially\r\n\r\nin  the HDB estates where many air-conditioning units mounted on\r\n\r\nwooden frames still exist today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to support the Building Control (Amendment) Bill 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I commend the Government for taking proactive\r\n\r\naction  on the subject of falling air-conditioning units in  HDB\r\n\r\nestates  before  anybody is injured.  We  are  told  that  these\r\n\r\nincidents have occurred because the wooden frames that the  air-conditioning units were mounted on have decayed over the  years.\r\n\r\nSuch decay of wooden frames is not surprising, given the kind of\r\n\r\nhot and wet weather we have in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few queries and clarifications to make regarding\r\n\r\nthe  main  features of the Bill.  In new section 21B,  the  Bill\r\n\r\nrequires  such  air-conditioning units  to  be  installed  by  a\r\n\r\ntrained  worker.  The Bill does not give details about the  pre-requisites  or qualifications for such a trained worker,  except\r\n\r\nthat  he is a person who holds a certificate issued by the  BCA.\r\n\r\nWould this be linked to any NTC qualification later to make  the\r\n\r\nrequirement more clear and transparent?  What is the  number  of\r\n\r\ntrained  workers that we have in the industry right now?   Would\r\n\r\nthere  be enough trained workers so as to keep such installation\r\n\r\nworks at reasonable price levels?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 21C also says that the installation will use \"such\r\n\r\nmaterial as may be prescribed.\"  Given that wood is not suitable\r\n\r\nin  such  a  climate, what will be the new acceptable  materials\r\n\r\nthat can be used in its place?  I believe that this is not given\r\n\r\nin  the  Bill.   Can  the Bill be a bit more  specific  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the deterioration of timber frames, I understand\r\n\r\nthat the brackets can also corrode and give way, posing the same\r\n\r\ndanger  to  residents.  Will the Building Commissioner  consider\r\n\r\nrequiring   building  owners  to  inspect  and   maintain   air-conditioners and their mountings on a regular basis?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill does not seem to address the issue of service or\r\n\r\nmaintenance   of  air-conditioning  units  after   installation.\r\n\r\nObviously, apart from having the units installed securely,  they\r\n\r\nshould also be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninstalled  in  a manner that allows them to be serviced  safely.\r\n\r\nThere  should be adequate provision for working space to prevent\r\n\r\nincidents  of falling tools and components as well as to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the worker can attend to the unit without exposing himself\r\n\r\nto  undue  danger.   The  design of such air-conditioning  units\r\n\r\nshould   also   incorporate  devices  that  allow   for   proper\r\n\r\ninstallation.  The Building Control Authority may want  to  seek\r\n\r\nthe  assistance of the PSB and the product design of  such  air-conditioners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am given to understand that apart from incidents of\r\n\r\nfalling  air-conditioning units, there have also been  instances\r\n\r\nof  falling casement windows in HDB flats.  They pose an equally\r\n\r\nsevere   threat   to  the  safety  of  residents.    Would   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Buildings consider imposing similar  legislative\r\n\r\ncontrol  regarding  the proper installation and  maintenance  of\r\n\r\nsuch windows?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments and queries, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is timely to introduce some control on the\r\n\r\nfixing  of  air-conditioners in HDB estates.   It  is  indeed  a\r\n\r\nfrightening  thought of an air-conditioning  unit  falling  down\r\n\r\nfrom  a  10-storey flat and hitting someone below.  The accident\r\n\r\nis  bound to be fatal.  The requirement for the installation  of\r\n\r\nan  air-conditioning unit by trained workers is a  move  in  the\r\n\r\nright direction.  However, that alone will not be able to ensure\r\n\r\nthat   the   unit  is  installed  according  to   the   required\r\n\r\nspecifications,  notwithstanding that a report has  to  be  made\r\n\r\nafter the installation.  Some form of inspection has to be  made\r\n\r\nin order that the installation requirement be followed.  I think\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  and town councils are in the best position to  provide\r\n\r\nthis safeguard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to request the\r\n\r\nSenior Parliamentary Secretary to consider looking into two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nother  aspects, apart from ensuring the structural soundness  of\r\n\r\nthe  installation of air-conditioners.  First, noise  pollution.\r\n\r\nVery  often, air-conditioners, if not properly fixed or  due  to\r\n\r\nits  age and lack of maintenance, will generate tremendous noise\r\n\r\nand  vibration.   This  will invariably be  a  nuisance  to  the\r\n\r\nadjoining  flats,  especially to those without  air-conditioners\r\n\r\nand have to sleep with their windows open.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, drainage problem. A lot of air-conditioning\r\n\r\nunits are not provided with proper drainage, ie, provision of  a\r\n\r\ntray  to drain off water, resulting in water splashing onto  the\r\n\r\nflat  below  them,  especially  units  which  are  not  properly\r\n\r\nmaintained.   I  hope that some form of control  and  regulatory\r\n\r\nmeasures  are  introduced to address these two  very  widespread\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nhighlighted this issue during the Budget debate last  year,  and\r\n\r\nasked  the  Ministry  to  do  something  about  it.   The   then\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary, in his response, had indicated that the\r\n\r\nBuilding  Control Authority would look into the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nlegislating  the requirements for window air-conditioning  units\r\n\r\ninstalled  in high-rise buildings.  Sir, it was sheer luck  that\r\n\r\nin all the eight cases of falling air-conditioning units, no one\r\n\r\nwas injured or killed.  I therefore welcome this Bill as it will\r\n\r\nhelp  to enhance the safety of living in a highrise environment.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  have  some clarifications to seek from  the  Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 21B requires a trained worker to fix the work. A\r\n\r\n\"trained  worker\" means a person who holds a certificate  issued\r\n\r\nby  BCA.  My question is: will experienced service providers who\r\n\r\nare  without formal education or training be also considered for\r\n\r\nthe certificate?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Bill also requires that only approved\r\n\r\nmaterials  can be used.  Are there any other approved materials,\r\n\r\napart   from   stainless   steel,  mentioned   by   the   Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary just now?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there are about 60,000 such units with wooden\r\n\r\nframes.  If we spread over a period of 12 months, each month  an\r\n\r\naverage  of about 5,000 units need to be retrofitted.   Can  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  assure  that owners would not have difficulty  meeting\r\n\r\nthe deadline?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport   this  Amendment  Bill  to  ensure  safe   and   proper\r\n\r\ninstallation  of  air-conditioners in HDB estates.   However,  I\r\n\r\nhave  a  few  suggestions for the consideration  of  the  Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Amendment Bill provides that air-conditioners be\r\n\r\ninstalled only by trained workers.  I feel that we should go one\r\n\r\nstep  further  to stipulate that  installation  work  should  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out only by registered companies, for better protection\r\n\r\nto  the  flat-owners.  The HDB should also carry  out  a  proper\r\n\r\ninspection after the air-conditioners are installed.  A  sticker\r\n\r\ncan  then be affixed to the air-conditioner to certify  that  it\r\n\r\nhas been properly installed according to the specifications laid\r\n\r\ndown  by  the HDB. This may help to solve the problems of  noise\r\n\r\npollution and water drainage due to improper installation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we must ensure that the installations are not\r\n\r\ncarried out without prior approval from the authority.   I  have\r\n\r\nreceived  complaints  during  my meet-the-people  sessions  that\r\n\r\ncontractors  employed by the flat-owners  to  install  the  air-conditioners  did  not  make  a formal  application  to  HDB  as\r\n\r\nrequired,  before  they commenced work. Some even  proceeded  to\r\n\r\ninstall  the  air-conditioners without obtaining  the  necessary\r\n\r\napproval.   Later on, when the flat owners were to resell  their\r\n\r\nflats,  they  will encounter problems, as their air-conditioners\r\n\r\nwould be deemed to be unauthorized installation.   If there  are\r\n\r\nstickers affixed  on the air-conditioners, these problems  would\r\n\r\nnot arise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the rising standard of living in Singapore, more\r\n\r\nand  more residents, especially the new flat owners, are  having\r\n\r\nair-conditioners installed.  I hope\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  in designing the new HDB flats, the architects could  make\r\n\r\nprovision for air-conditioners to be installed in such a way  as\r\n\r\nto  give  the  flat owners and technicians access  to  the  air-conditioners   to  facilitate  easy  checking,   servicing   and\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of  the  said  air-conditioners.   As   most   air-conditioners  are now installed outside the windows  or  on  the\r\n\r\nexternal walls, flat owners find it very difficult for  them  to\r\n\r\ninspect  or  service  the  air-conditioners,  and  it  is   very\r\n\r\ndangerous too.  They have to bend out of the windows to  do  it.\r\n\r\nIf  they are not careful, it is not the air-conditioners but the\r\n\r\npersons  themselves  will be falling  over.    This  is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant matter of safety to consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, at the\r\n\r\nmoment some  65,000 units of  air-conditioners are being mounted\r\n\r\non  wooden  frames, and the flat owners are required to  replace\r\n\r\nthe  wooden frames with stainless steel frames within one  year.\r\n\r\nWill  there  be enough contractors to carry out the retrofitting\r\n\r\nwork of all these 65,000 air-conditioners within one year?  Will\r\n\r\nthis result in a steep rise in the cost?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of housing estates which have been selected for\r\n\r\nthe  SERS scheme, the residents will have to move out soon.  Can\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  exercise some flexibility in dealing  with  these\r\n\r\ncases?   Since they are moving out very soon, there is  no  need\r\n\r\nfor  them  to spend extra money to retrofit the installation  of\r\n\r\nair-conditioners.   But  we  must  of  course  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nexisting wooden frames are still in good condition.  I hope  the\r\n\r\nSenior Parliamentary Secretary will consider my suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, one of the major causes of air-conditioning units falling off is the deterioration of the air-\r\n\r\nconditioning unit over time.  But we must not forget that  these\r\n\r\nwooden  frames  were installed by HDB.  They were  provided  for\r\n\r\nwhen  the  owners moved in.  HDB, as a developer, provides  such\r\n\r\nwooden  frames.  I wonder whether the Bill should  also  require\r\n\r\ndevelopers  (both HDB and private developers)  to  provide  air-conditioning  frames from materials which would not  deteriorate\r\n\r\nover time, and thus cause a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npotential  danger  in the future.  I wonder whether  HDB  has  a\r\n\r\nmoral  responsibility to replace the existing wooden  frames  in\r\n\r\nHDB  estates.   Do  not forget, Sir, it is not  only  those  who\r\n\r\ninstall  air-conditioning units on wooden frames that cause  the\r\n\r\nproblem,  but the frames themselves cause a problem as well  for\r\n\r\nthose who do not have an air-conditioning unit.  This is because\r\n\r\nas  the wooden frame deteriorates, there is the problem of water\r\n\r\nleakage  which  they  have to solve.  I would  urge  the  Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary to consider whether HDB  would  replace\r\n\r\nthe wooden frames as a matter of goodwill, as a one-time basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, may I take the last\r\n\r\nquestion first in answer to Mr Low Thia Khiang.  HDB did provide\r\n\r\nsome  HDB  flats with wooden frames to facilitate the owners  to\r\n\r\nput in their window air-conditioning units.  These wooden frames\r\n\r\nwere  placed  on  a goodwill basis because there  were  requests\r\n\r\nprior  to HDB's guesture.  In the past when HDB did not  provide\r\n\r\nthe  frames,  owners had to hack a big hole to insert  the  air-conditioning unit into the hole.  Then they have to fix the air-conditioning  unit into the hole by inserting wooden  frames  on\r\n\r\nthe four sides.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB is unable and will not replace the wooden frames for\r\n\r\nthe  flat owners because this was done on a goodwill basis.  Any\r\n\r\nwooden  frame that has deteriorated over time should be replaced\r\n\r\nby  the owner.  Once the owner takes over the apartment,  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  owner's  responsibility for maintaining  all  the  internal\r\n\r\nfixtures within the flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having learnt the lesson, what is HDB doing now? For the\r\n\r\nnew  generation  flats,  HDB  is putting  them  in  the  service\r\n\r\nbalconies.   If you look at the new generation flats,  you  will\r\n\r\nfind  that  there is a service balcony where owners can  put  in\r\n\r\ntheir split condensers.  At the same time, HDB has also explored\r\n\r\nareas  within  the wash areas.  We have put in the ledgers  with\r\n\r\nrailings  to mount the air-conditioners.  This is to  facilitate\r\n\r\nreplacement.  So HDB has progressed ahead and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  are  now tackling a problem that is actually rooted  in  the\r\n\r\npast.   We are asking the owners to look at their wooden  frames\r\n\r\nand  take  the effort to change these wooden frames  within  one\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is one year sufficient time to change all the 65,000 air-conditioning units, of which 45,000 are in HDB flats and 20,000\r\n\r\nin  private  estates?  We have a pool of 4,000  trained  workers\r\n\r\ncertified  to  install steel brackets on to these existing  air-conditioning units.  We have an existing problem of 65,000  air-conditioning  units.  So there should be enough time.   We  have\r\n\r\n4,000 workers and we expect more workers to be trained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the qualification of a worker? It is not very high\r\n\r\nbecause it is a very simple task actually.  We require a  person\r\n\r\nto  take a test.  If he says he is qualified, he has the  skills\r\n\r\nbut  he has no certificate, we will require him to take a  test.\r\n\r\nIf  he says, \"I do not know how to do the installation\", then he\r\n\r\nundergoes a course.  The course is 17 hours conducted by BCA  at\r\n\r\nthe  Construction Industry Training Institute at Braddell  Road.\r\n\r\nThe  course  fee  is  $410 per participant and  we  conduct  the\r\n\r\nclasses  in Mandarin or English, or if there is enough  critical\r\n\r\nmass of about 24 students, it can be conducted in any dialect or\r\n\r\nlanguage.  Companies can sponsor their workers for this  course.\r\n\r\nThey  can  pay a one-time fee of $9,840 for one class  organised\r\n\r\nfor  a  company.  We have settled the problem whether  there  is\r\n\r\nsufficient time.  The answer is yes.  Are there enough  workers?\r\n\r\nThe answer is also yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the best approved material? At this point in time,\r\n\r\nwe  think stainless steel is the best material.  That will be in\r\n\r\nthe  subsidiary  legislation.   Stainless  steel  is  relatively\r\n\r\ncheap, readily available and easily installable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen talked about noise pollution problem. Yes,\r\n\r\nit  is indeed a problem.  As the air-conditioning unit ages, the\r\n\r\nnoise  level  does  go  up.  I will refer  the  problem  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of the Environment.  They have a Noise Pollution  Unit\r\n\r\nwhich monitors the noise level of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nair-conditioning units and other industrial machineries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards drainage problem, before HDB allows an air-conditioning unit to be installed, the person who installs the\r\n\r\nair-conditioning unit must satisfy HDB that the drainage problem\r\n\r\nis solved before we issue a permit for the air-conditioning unit\r\n\r\nto be installed.  I do not think this is a serious problem.  But\r\n\r\nat the MUP stage where old flats are undergoing MUP, various MUP\r\n\r\ncommittees have tackled this problem systematically and some  of\r\n\r\nthem actually put a pipe all the way down from the top floor  to\r\n\r\nthe  bottom floor so that the window air-conditioning units  can\r\n\r\nbe  connected to such an improvised down pipe.  But  this  is  a\r\n\r\nsystem  solution which can only come about when there is a  MUP.\r\n\r\nBut for individual cases, they have to solve it within the unit.\r\n\r\nUsually, what they do is that they bring the pipe back into  the\r\n\r\nbathroom or into the toilet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Ang Mong Seng's question, he suggested that we should\r\n\r\nnot license the workers but we should license the companies.  It\r\n\r\nis difficult to license the companies.  In any case, it is not a\r\n\r\nvery  difficult  job to install steel brackets  to  window  air-conditioners. If we license companies alone, I think it will  be\r\n\r\nmaking  a  big deal out of a small problem.  In any case,  there\r\n\r\nwill not be enough companies.  We have 4,000 workers.  We do not\r\n\r\nhave  4,000 companies.  And we have set a time limit of one year\r\n\r\nbecause  we  think that while the problem is not severe  enough,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a possibility that one or two air-conditioners  might\r\n\r\nfall off in the one-year period.  So we want to be very safe, we\r\n\r\nwant  to  make sure the problem is solved in as short a time  as\r\n\r\npossible,  and we want to allow a qualified competent person  to\r\n\r\ndo  the  job.  I think a trained worker with a certificate  from\r\n\r\nBCA  can  do the job.  In any case, companies come and  go,  and\r\n\r\nthere is no assurance either.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng suggested that after the completion of the\r\n\r\njob,  the  trained worker or the company should  stick  a  label\r\n\r\nthere  to certify that the job has been done satisfactorily.   I\r\n\r\nwill pass this back to the BCA and HDB to ask them to consider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBut, off my head, I think that the sticker solution may not be a\r\n\r\nfool-proof solution because you can always tear off a sticker or\r\n\r\nyou can stick on a fixed sticker.  But anyway it is one area  we\r\n\r\ncan look at and I will ask the authority to look at it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exemption for flats undergoing MUP and IUP is something\r\n\r\nthat  I  will talk to HDB and we will see what we can  do.   The\r\n\r\nMember  was  suggesting that flats which have been targeted  for\r\n\r\nSERS should be exempted.  A SERS programme takes five years from\r\n\r\nannouncement to completion.  So five years is a very long  time.\r\n\r\nIf  it  is  for SERS, I would be very reluctant to  exempt  them\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  a  long time.  Because when we  announced,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  the  en-bloc redevelopment at Hillview this  year,  it\r\n\r\nwill take some time for the residents to be physically relocated\r\n\r\nto  the  new  location.   So in five years'  time  anything  can\r\n\r\nhappen.  But the Member's area is a new area, so probably  steel\r\n\r\nbrackets  are already in place.  But anyway I will  ask  HDB  to\r\n\r\nlook  at  it.   But off my head I think we should think  through\r\n\r\nthis  again.  For MUP, maybe we can look at it.  MUP could  take\r\n\r\ntwo to three years.  The time-frame is much shorter.  But in any\r\n\r\ncase,  if  the wooden frame needs to be changed, it  has  to  be\r\n\r\nchanged, and I think we should not compromise on safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered all the questions. If I have not,\r\n\r\nplease remind me.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, may I clarify with the\r\n\r\nSenior Parliamentary Secretary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary in his answer says that\r\n\r\nthe  wooden air-conditioning panel and the opening were provided\r\n\r\nby  HDB  on  a goodwill basis.  But I wonder whether all  owners\r\n\r\nwould  want this goodwill in the first place because I notice  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  them  do not use the air-conditioner opening  provided.\r\n\r\nEither  the  position is not correct or it  is  going  to  cause\r\n\r\nproblems  to them because of noise nuisance.  But bear  in  mind\r\n\r\nthat this is initially a goodwill.  When the Bill is passed,  it\r\n\r\nbecomes  a \"bad will\", because if you do not do anything  to  it\r\n\r\nand it drops off, it is your responsibility,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  you  are going to be punished under the Act.  So  when  the\r\n\r\ngoodwill becomes a problem, would the HDB not be responsible  to\r\n\r\nat  least  help  to  facilitate the owners  with  this  goodwill\r\n\r\nprovided by helping them to solve the problem?  So can  we  have\r\n\r\nanother  goodwill  from  the  HDB to  replace  the  wooden  air-conditioning panel?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Sir, just a point of clarification.\r\n\r\nCan the Senior Parliamentary Secretary tell us how much does  it\r\n\r\ncost to replace a wooden set into a stainless steel set?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> The cost to replace the wooden\r\n\r\nframe  with stainless steel brackets is very small.  It is about\r\n\r\n$200  to  $250.  That includes labour and parts.  It  will  only\r\n\r\ntake a few hours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to Mr Low's problem. He said that many flat owners do\r\n\r\nnot  use the wooden window frame.  If they do not use the wooden\r\n\r\nframe,  that means there is no air-conditioning unit  there  and\r\n\r\nthe  air-conditioner cannot fall off.  So there is  no  problem.\r\n\r\nBut  if  they do use the window frame to put an air-conditioning\r\n\r\nunit  there, then they have used up the goodwill, in which  case\r\n\r\nif the wooden frame were to rot, then the owner must replace the\r\n\r\nwooden frame with steel brackets.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Leakage.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Similarly, you live in a  flat,  you  cannot\r\n\r\nexpect  HDB  to go in and fix every small little problem.

And he told me it costs only about $100.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng:</b> Sir, just now I proposed that stickers\r\n\r\nbe  provided by HDB and not by a trained worker.  Because  after\r\n\r\ninstallation, I think the HDB should send their staff to make an\r\n\r\ninspection  to make sure that everything is installed  according\r\n\r\nto the standard.  The stickers should be provided by HDB and not\r\n\r\nby the trained worker.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> $100 is a good deal. We are\r\n\r\ntalking about good stainless steel.  Anyway, the figure  I  have\r\n\r\nis about $200 to $250, including labour and parts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the installation, Mr Ang suggested that HDB should\r\n\r\ninspect the installation and then certify it.  I will ask HDB to\r\n\r\nlook at it.  But I think it is really unnecessary.  What is  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  certifying the worker?  We have trained the  worker\r\n\r\nand  certified him.  It is a relatively simple job, and  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  Branch officer to go and look at it again is providing\r\n\r\n200%  redundancy.  No building authority in the world legislates\r\n\r\nthe installation of air-conditioning units.  So we are almost  a\r\n\r\nfirst  here  but  partly because we have got too many  high-rise\r\n\r\napartments.   But I think it is a very simple problem.   In  any\r\n\r\ncase,  if an air-conditioner is inserted into a hole, by  itself\r\n\r\nit will not drop because there is a fulcrum and friction effect.\r\n\r\nIn the case where the hole is too big, you put in a wooden frame\r\n\r\nto  make the hole smaller, again there is a fulcrum effect,  and\r\n\r\nthe  window does not fall off.  Now we are saying we  put  steel\r\n\r\nbrackets  to  reinforce  that installation  and  fix  the  steel\r\n\r\nbrackets onto the wall, we are providing already 100% redundancy\r\n\r\non  top  of  the wooden frame support.  I think with  the  steel\r\n\r\nbracket  installation, the window unit should not  fall  off  at\r\n\r\nall.   Anyway, I will take the Member's suggestion.  I will  ask\r\n\r\nHDB  to look at whether it is implementable or not.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to amend the Bankruptcy Act to put in\r\n\r\nplace  measures  in  support of the Technopreneurship  21  (T21)\r\n\r\ninitiative  and  to  make  related amendments  to  the  Business\r\n\r\nRegistration Act and the Companies Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that the Bankruptcy Act had a major and\r\n\r\nfundamental    revision   in   1995   aimed    at    encouraging\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.   The  Bill  therefore   does   not   seek   a\r\n\r\nfundamental   overhaul  of  the  bankruptcy  regime.    Instead,\r\n\r\namendments   are  proposed  to  fine-tune  our  legislation   to\r\n\r\nencourage  technopreneurial activity and to enhance  Singapore's\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial climate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Voluntary Arrangements</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1995, to promote entrepreneurship, a reorganisation\r\n\r\nregime  called \"Voluntary Arrangement\" was introduced to provide\r\n\r\nan  avenue  for debt settlement without resorting to bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nThis  however  has  not been widely used.   As  greater  use  by\r\n\r\ndebtors  of Voluntary Arrangements will reduce the incidence  of\r\n\r\nbankruptcy,  this  process should be encouraged.   The  measures\r\n\r\nproposed by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  to  encourage use of Voluntary  Arrangements  are  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Firstly, the amendments extend the deadline for a\r\n\r\nbankrupt  to make a proposal for voluntary arrangement  from  28\r\n\r\ndays   to  42  days.   Currently,  after  the  Court  orders   a\r\n\r\nmoratorium,  the debtor has 28 days to make a proposal  for  the\r\n\r\nsettlement  of his debts.  The extension of this  period  to  42\r\n\r\ndays  would allow more time for the debtor to put up a  proposal\r\n\r\nand increase the chances of Voluntary Arrangements succeeding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Secondly, the amendments allow the Minister for Law to\r\n\r\nmake  rules  prescribing the scale of  fees  to  be  charged  by\r\n\r\nnominees assisting debtors in respect of Voluntary Arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe  reason  for  this is that currently, the fees  are  set  by\r\n\r\nnominees.   There  is a general perception that  fees  currently\r\n\r\ncharged  are  too  high.  A fixed scale  of  fees  will  provide\r\n\r\ncertainty  and  encourage  debtors  to  make  use  of  Voluntary\r\n\r\nArrangements.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Measures to allow Bankrupts to be economically productive - Amendments  to  the Companies Act and the Business  Registration Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point is that it is important that a bankrupt\r\n\r\nremains  economically productive even during  bankruptcy.   This\r\n\r\nwill allow the bankrupt to settle his debts earlier and get  out\r\n\r\nof  bankruptcy more speedily. It will also allow the bankrupt to\r\n\r\ncontinue contributing economically to society during bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, a bankrupt cannot act as a company director or\r\n\r\nengage  in the management of a company or business, except  with\r\n\r\nleave of Court.  However, very few bankrupts apply to court  for\r\n\r\npermission to do business, deterred by the costs and trouble  of\r\n\r\nhaving   to   apply  to  Court.   The  Official   Assignee,   as\r\n\r\nadministrator  of  a  bankruptcy estate, frequently  deals  with\r\n\r\nbankrupts and is more knowledgeable of their affairs.   He  will\r\n\r\ntherefore be able to consider the merits of each case before  he\r\n\r\ngrants permission.  Allowing the Official Assignee to grant such\r\n\r\npermission will also make the process cheaper, simpler and  more\r\n\r\naccessible to the bankrupts.  The Official Assignee is also best\r\n\r\nplaced to assist bankrupts and to ensure that a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nportion  of  profits made from businesses are paid to creditors.\r\n\r\nThe Bill therefore proposes:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to amend the Companies Act to give the Official\r\n\r\nReceiver power to allow bankrupts to be company directors and be\r\n\r\ninvolved in the management of companies; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to amend the Business Registration Act to give the\r\n\r\nOfficial Assignee the power to allow bankrupts to be engaged  in\r\n\r\nthe management of business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, keeping this as a discretionary measure allows persons\r\n\r\nwho  become  bankrupts through misfortune to  be  differentiated\r\n\r\nfrom  those  who have become so through malpractice.   It  would\r\n\r\nalso   encourage  bankrupts  to  co-operate  with  the  Official\r\n\r\nAssignee  to  expedite their discharge from  bankruptcy.   These\r\n\r\ncannot  be  achieved  by total lifting of  restrictions  against\r\n\r\nbankrupts doing business.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Measures  to  speed  up  the  bankruptcy  discharge  process  in deserving cases</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Official Assignee takes into account the cause of\r\n\r\nbankruptcy  and the efforts made by the bankrupt  to  repay  his\r\n\r\ncreditors  when deciding whether to discharge a bankrupt.   This\r\n\r\nscheme which was introduced in 1995 with a major revamp has  the\r\n\r\nadvantage  of being an inexpensive way of discharging  deserving\r\n\r\nbankrupts  expeditiously,  whilst  creating  an  incentive   for\r\n\r\nbankrupts  to work towards their discharge.  It also  serves  to\r\n\r\npromote  entrepreneurship without eroding  financial  discipline\r\n\r\nand  commercial  morality.  Indeed, Sir, the scheme  has  worked\r\n\r\nwell  and  has  been  rated by the Commonwealth  Association  of\r\n\r\nPublic   Administration  and  Management  in  1998   as   \"truly\r\n\r\ninnovative  and  worthy  of  recognition\"  with  the  Insolvency\r\n\r\nService being awarded a Certificate of Achievement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the scheme's usefulness in rehabilitating\r\n\r\ndeserving  bankrupts, the Bill proposes that the Bankruptcy  Act\r\n\r\nbe amended to reduce the period for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neligibility  for discharge by certificate from the current  five\r\n\r\nyears to three years.  This will allow the Official Assignee  to\r\n\r\nbegin considering a bankrupt for discharge after three years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me stress that this is a discretion that the\r\n\r\nOfficial Assignee will exercise only in deserving cases.   There\r\n\r\nwill  be  no  automatic  discharge.  This amendment  will  allow\r\n\r\ndeserving  bankrupts  to return to society  more  quickly.   The\r\n\r\nthree  year  period was chosen to provide greater incentive  for\r\n\r\ndeserving bankrupts to work towards an early discharge.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Measures to streamline procedures and reduce the need to  resort to the courts</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, two amendments to the Act are proposed to streamline\r\n\r\nprocedures and reduce the need to resort to the courts:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, currently under the Act, when a bankrupt makes an\r\n\r\noffer  of  composition or proposes a scheme  of  arrangement,  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  meeting of creditors must be convened to  consider  the\r\n\r\noffer  or scheme. The Bill amends the Act to allow for the offer\r\n\r\nor  scheme  to  be  accepted by the creditors  by  post  without\r\n\r\nconvening a general meeting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there are currently two situations where a\r\n\r\nbankrupt  is  required to apply to court for a discharge.  These\r\n\r\nare first when a bankrupt has fully repaid all his debts or when\r\n\r\nthe creditors have, by special resolution, accepted an offer  of\r\n\r\ncomposition or scheme of arrangement from the debtor.   Sir,  in\r\n\r\nthese  two situations, the courts will invariably discharge  the\r\n\r\nbankrupt.   The Bill amends the Act to provide for the  Official\r\n\r\nAssignee to issue a certificate to discharge a bankrupt in these\r\n\r\ntwo situations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two amendments, the last two that I have enumerated,\r\n\r\nwould  save  time and costs and further expedite the process  of\r\n\r\ndischarging a bankrupt.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to the above amendments, the Bill also\r\n\r\namends the Companies Act to increase the debt limit for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nservice  of  a  statutory  demand on a company  from  $2,000  to\r\n\r\n$10,000.  This amendment brings the debt limit for companies  in\r\n\r\nline  with the bankruptcy debt limit which has been raised  from\r\n\r\n$2,000 to $10,000 early last month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in formulating these changes, we have sought to strike\r\n\r\na proper balance between the interests of debtors and creditors.\r\n\r\nWe  were  mindful  that over-liberalisation  of  the  bankruptcy\r\n\r\nregime  may erode creditors' rights and make it more costly  for\r\n\r\nbusinesses to obtain financing. Changes that would work  against\r\n\r\ncreditors' interests have therefore been avoided.  Instead,  the\r\n\r\nproposed amendments focus on, firstly, facilitating bankrupts to\r\n\r\ncontinue   being  economically  active  and  productive   during\r\n\r\nbankruptcy;  secondly,  saving costs by streamlining  procedures\r\n\r\nand reducing the need to resort to the courts.  These amendments\r\n\r\nwill help to create a climate more conducive to entrepreneurship\r\n\r\nand responsible risk-taking while preserving commercial morality\r\n\r\nand  financial discipline.  They will also help to  prepare  our\r\n\r\npeople   to  take  advantage  of  the  emerging  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy;   and,   thirdly,  these  amendments  would   encourage\r\n\r\nbankrupts to work towards a speedier discharge from bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any move we make to aid technopreneurship drive is always\r\n\r\nwelcomed,  Sir.   Bankruptcy and the  difficulty  of  getting  a\r\n\r\ndischarge  is  a  major  impediment to entrepreneurship.   I  am\r\n\r\ndelighted that we have progressively lowered the legal hurdle in\r\n\r\ndischarging the bankrupts since 1995.  One can only  hope  that,\r\n\r\nby  lowering  the legal hurdle, we can lower the  public  stigma\r\n\r\nattached to bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we lower the legal hurdle, I get the distinct\r\n\r\nimpression that we may not be discharging bankrupts fast enough.\r\n\r\nFor example, I am aware of a case in which a bankrupt was in the\r\n\r\nprocess of seeking a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndischarge under the old guidelines.  But when the new guidelines\r\n\r\nwere  implemented in which the debt was raised to  $200,000,  he\r\n\r\nwas  not  given  the  discharge as he  was  still  governed  and\r\n\r\nconsidered  under  the old guidelines.  The distinct  impression\r\n\r\ngiven  is  that  while  we  have the law,  perhaps  we  are  not\r\n\r\nimplementing  the law sufficiently fast.  Perhaps, the  Minister\r\n\r\nof  State  would like to comment on how fast we are  discharging\r\n\r\nour  bankrupts and the number of cases of discharge that we  had\r\n\r\ndone  since  1995.  Will the new guidelines apply to all  cases,\r\n\r\neven those who are in the process of being discharged under  the\r\n\r\nold policy guidelines?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to improve the rate of discharge, so to speak, I would\r\n\r\nlike  the Minister of State to also explain to this House if  we\r\n\r\nhave  sufficient manpower in the office of the Official Assignee\r\n\r\nto implement the law.  It is one thing to have the law but we do\r\n\r\nnot have the manpower to do that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I refer to clause 7 in amending section 125(2) of\r\n\r\nthe  Bankruptcy Act.  Sir, the time bar of five years which  has\r\n\r\nnow  been lowered to three years to obtain a certificate is most\r\n\r\nwelcomed.   However, I am of the view that the  three-year  time\r\n\r\nbar  is  still an impediment in truly deserving cases since  the\r\n\r\ndischarge  is  not  automatic.  Perhaps, the Government  or  the\r\n\r\nMinistry would like to review a further lowering of this  limit,\r\n\r\nespecially in cases whereby the person has started an e-commerce\r\n\r\nbusiness which is what we are trying to promote.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we lower the legal hurdle in discharging\r\n\r\nbankrupts  and  helping to lower the social stigma,  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nstate  that  it  is still necessary to instill or reinforce  the\r\n\r\nbasic  fundamental  principles that hard work  and  honesty  are\r\n\r\nintegral qualities in commerce.  No one should take advantage of\r\n\r\nthe  bankruptcy laws to shy away from this obligation  to  repay\r\n\r\nhis  debts  and  I  think the law should not help  him  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwish to speak in support of this Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister of State has said earlier, the proposed\r\n\r\namendments  are  in  response to measures to be  implemented  in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the  Technopreneurship  21  initiative.   The  main\r\n\r\nobjective  is to make it easier for businessmen who have  failed\r\n\r\nand  are declared bankrupt to have a chance to recover and start\r\n\r\nafresh   in   the   shortest   reasonable   time.    To   enable\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurship to thrive in Singapore, we need  to  create  a\r\n\r\nmore  conducive business environment and a climate that is  more\r\n\r\ntolerant  to  business failures.  Hence, people who have  failed\r\n\r\nshould be given second, third or even more chances to try again.\r\n\r\nWe  know  of many successful entrepreneurs who have gone through\r\n\r\nseveral trials and failures before they finally succeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am generally in support of the Bill, I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask  the Minister of State for some clarification on  clause\r\n\r\n11.  Clause 11 empowers the Official Assignee to give permission\r\n\r\nto  an  undischarged  bankrupt  to  act  as  a  director  of   a\r\n\r\ncorporation  or  to manage a corporation.  My query  is  on  the\r\n\r\neffective  implementation of this power given  to  the  Official\r\n\r\nAssignee.  While I agree that it will be expedient for the power\r\n\r\nto  be  given  to  the Official Assignee to allow  a  person  to\r\n\r\nrestart a business, or act as a director, though he is still  an\r\n\r\nundischarged  bankrupt,  my concern is how  would  the  Official\r\n\r\nAssignee  be  able to exercise good judgement on the suitability\r\n\r\nof  a  person to continue running a business.  Now, the onus  of\r\n\r\npassing  the  judgement  is on the Official  Assignee.   If  the\r\n\r\nOfficial  Assignee is too lenient and makes a wrong  assessment,\r\n\r\nhe  may be allowing a crook or a cheat to restart a business and\r\n\r\nthereafter he can defraud or cheat new and more victims of their\r\n\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the clause is welcomed as it gives the\r\n\r\nOfficial  Assignee  the power to allow genuine  businessmen  who\r\n\r\nhave  failed to try again.  Perhaps, I would like to suggest  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister of State that there should be some means  for  the\r\n\r\nOfficial  Assignee to consult, perhaps, a committee or a  panel.\r\n\r\nThis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npanel can comprise experienced businessmen and professionals who\r\n\r\ncan  give  their independent judgement and views to any bankrupt\r\n\r\nwho  applies  to  be  allowed to start a business  or  become  a\r\n\r\ndirector.  Therefore, this allows our Official Assignee  to  get\r\n\r\nsome professional advice on this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to say that I am encouraged that\r\n\r\nthe Minister of State has taken some bold steps in amending this\r\n\r\nBill  and  I  am  confident that this will be a good  signal  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and those who plan to become entrepreneurs that  we\r\n\r\nare indeed moving towards an environment where we wish to foster\r\n\r\ngreater  tolerance for failure.  Sir, many start-ups, especially\r\n\r\nhigh-tech ones, are typically risky in nature and not all  ideas\r\n\r\ncan develop into successful business opportunities.  However, if\r\n\r\nsome  of these ideas do become good business ventures, the gains\r\n\r\ncan  be  tremendous, as evidenced by the many Internet start-ups\r\n\r\nwhich have achieved impressive market capitalisation around  the\r\n\r\nworld.  In cases where a venture fails, the entrepreneur and the\r\n\r\ninvestors  could  suffer  substantial  losses  and  our  current\r\n\r\nlegislation,  especially  the  bankruptcy  law,  can   be   very\r\n\r\nunforgiving and intolerant to those who dared to take  the  step\r\n\r\ntowards entrepreneurship and technopreneurship.  So I am hopeful\r\n\r\nthat  the  changes  proposed will encourage greater  risk-taking\r\n\r\namong Singaporeans, a trait we lack currently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in today's context, being a bankrupt is a very big\r\n\r\nstigma  and leaves a permanent scar in their lives.  Such people\r\n\r\nare   treated   badly  by  society  and  not  many,   especially\r\n\r\ninstitutions like banks and Government agencies, will be willing\r\n\r\nto give them a second chance to try again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I strongly support the Minister of State's intent to\r\n\r\ngive  differential treatment for persons who get into  financial\r\n\r\nproblems due to normal business risks versus those who do so  as\r\n\r\na result of mismanagement and malpractice, the Bill however does\r\n\r\nnot attempt to clearly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndifferentiate  the two circumstances and it leaves  entirely  to\r\n\r\nthe judgement of the Official Assignee.  I would like to suggest\r\n\r\nthat the Minister of State consider stating these clearly in the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that business failure need not result in\r\n\r\nbankruptcy and therefore we should encourage and strengthen  the\r\n\r\nuse  of informal debt settlement as an alternative and therefore\r\n\r\nmediation  should be made a prerequisite before  any  bankruptcy\r\n\r\nproceedings  go  to the courts.  I hope that the requirement  of\r\n\r\nmediation  before going to the courts can be formalised  in  the\r\n\r\nBill.   This will be a cheaper process and, in my opinion,  will\r\n\r\ngive  the  creditors a better chance to recover their money.   I\r\n\r\nhope  the Minister of State will institutionalise pre-bankruptcy\r\n\r\nmediation  in  the Bill.  This will save many  people  from  the\r\n\r\nunpleasant experience of becoming bankrupt, a stigma  that  will\r\n\r\nlast a life time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sections 95 and 95A attempt to streamline the process\r\n\r\nof discharge from bankruptcy.  By allowing a bankrupt to make an\r\n\r\noffer  of composition or propose a scheme of arrangement without\r\n\r\ncalling  a  general  meeting of creditors will  make  the  whole\r\n\r\nprocess  less cumbersome.  By allowing the Official Assignee  to\r\n\r\nadministratively  discharge  a bankrupt  through  a  certificate\r\n\r\nafter  this arrangement is passed by a special resolution  means\r\n\r\nthat there is no need to bring the process to the court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the new section 123A does not require a person\r\n\r\nto  go back to the courts to be discharged from bankruptcy if he\r\n\r\nhas  paid  his  debts.  By empowering the Official  Assignee  to\r\n\r\nissue  the  Certificate of Annulment, or discharge, the  process\r\n\r\nwill be much faster, saving both time and cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these changes are big steps that show the Government's\r\n\r\nwillingness to help those who have failed to get back  to  their\r\n\r\nnormal mode of living by removing some major obstacles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to ask the Minister of State to\r\n\r\nclarify whether the Official Assignee will be able to issue such\r\n\r\nCertificate  of  Annulment within the minimum  three  years,  as\r\n\r\nstipulated in the Bill, or will the bankrupt still have to wait\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  this  time  period  to  be up  before  being  eligible  for\r\n\r\ndischarge  by  a Certificate, especially in the case  where  the\r\n\r\nbankrupt has already paid up all the debts that he owes  to  the\r\n\r\ncreditors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the next amendment in section 125. I am\r\n\r\nglad  that the minimum period of bankruptcy before a Certificate\r\n\r\nof  Discharge can be issued has been reduced from five years  to\r\n\r\nthree  years.  Can I, however, ask the Minister of State whether\r\n\r\nhe  will consider reducing this period to less than three years?\r\n\r\nAt  this  juncture,  in fact, I would like to  suggest  that  we\r\n\r\ndefine in our legislation two categories of bankruptcy. One that\r\n\r\noccurs  as  a  result of failure of business venture  especially\r\n\r\nthose  of  high-tech in nature and, the second, as a  result  of\r\n\r\nmalpractice and mismanagement.  Our current \"one size fits  all\"\r\n\r\nruling treats all failures equally and this, in my opinion, will\r\n\r\ndiscourage many technopreneurs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the Ministry does have the intent to institute a\r\n\r\ndifferential treatment for the two categories, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest    that   the   Ministry   study   the    proposal    of\r\n\r\ninstitutionalising a two-tier bankruptcy ruling where those  who\r\n\r\nbecame bankrupts by virtue of true business failure, without the\r\n\r\nintent  of malice or mismanagement, be allowed an easier  option\r\n\r\nto  be  discharged.  This  will achieve  two  objectives  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion.  First, it will encourage more people to embark on high-risk  technological start-ups and, second, it will allow  people\r\n\r\nwho  failed to become more productive and to try again at a much\r\n\r\nfaster pace than the current legislation allows.  As an example,\r\n\r\nin the Silicon Valley in the USA, once a person who has become a\r\n\r\nbankrupt proves that he has no other assets that can be used  to\r\n\r\ndistribute  to his creditors, automatic discharge  is  possible.\r\n\r\nThis  of  course  is an ideal approach.  This has  made  Silicon\r\n\r\nValley in the USA a vibrant place for many new start-ups because\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurs do not have to wait too long before  starting  up\r\n\r\nnew   ventures  again.   In  my  opinion,  such  a  change  will\r\n\r\ndefinitely shift mindsets among Singaporeans towards being  more\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By amending section 148 of the Companies Act, we\r\n\r\neffectively allow bankrupts to be economically productive.  This\r\n\r\nis  an  excellent  move  because I feel that  this  allows  many\r\n\r\ntalented people to contribute their knowledge and experience and\r\n\r\nperhaps  even establish successful ventures in the process.   It\r\n\r\nis  a waste of our valuable resources by not allowing them to do\r\n\r\nbusiness  or to act as company directors or to manage companies.\r\n\r\nThe  new  arrangement of empowering the Official  Assignee  will\r\n\r\ndefinitely make it easier for them to become economically active\r\n\r\nfaster.   Can  I suggest that we take a bolder step by  amending\r\n\r\nthis section to read as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Bankrupts should be allowed to act as company directors\r\n\r\nunless the Official Assignee disagrees.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  this approach, such bankrupts would automatically be allowed\r\n\r\nto  do  all  the  things that we have mentioned without  getting\r\n\r\npermission,  but if someone wants to object, then  the  Official\r\n\r\nAssignee  can  come in and take action based on that  objection.\r\n\r\nThis would give a more positive outlook to our legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last comment I have is on section 254(2)(a) where the\r\n\r\ndebt threshold for filing bankruptcy has been raised from $2,000\r\n\r\nto  $10,000.   While the increase looks big and is  welcomed,  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  many  high-tech start-ups  can  be  very  much  more\r\n\r\nexpensive  than the $10,000 and this $10,000 limit  may  not  be\r\n\r\nhelpful  if  such ventures fail.  Here again, having a  two-tier\r\n\r\nbankruptcy  rule where perhaps, we set a much higher  limit  for\r\n\r\nhigh-tech  start-ups and for ventures that require  a  lot  more\r\n\r\ncapital to be accorded a different limit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to add that the changes\r\n\r\nproposed  in  this Bill reflect the desire of the Government  to\r\n\r\npromote a conducive environment for technopreneurs and will give\r\n\r\na  good signal of the type of changes we need to make for T21 to\r\n\r\nbe successful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that this will not be the end of the changes we are\r\n\r\nwilling to make to this Bill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand I hope that the Minister of State will be willing to be more\r\n\r\naggressive and consider some of the recommendations I have  made\r\n\r\nin reviewing the Bill again in the near future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before commenting on the\r\n\r\nBill, I would like to declare my interest as a lawyer in private\r\n\r\npractice where from time to time, I advise clients on bankruptcy\r\n\r\nand insolvency matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the Bankruptcy Act, the Companies Act and\r\n\r\nthe  Business Registration Act proposed under the Bill  seek  to\r\n\r\nput   in   place   important  measures   in   support   of   the\r\n\r\nTechnopreneurship  21  initiative  which  we  are  promoting  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The proposed amendments are welcomed as concrete and\r\n\r\npractical  measures to relax the rules and procedures  affecting\r\n\r\nbankrupts  in  Singapore.  It is hoped that these  changes  will\r\n\r\nhelp  encourage  greater risk-taking amongst  entrepreneurs  and\r\n\r\nwould-be   entrepreneurs   and  will  reduce   the   unnecessary\r\n\r\nrestrictions  and  burdens  on those  who  may  have  failed  in\r\n\r\nprevious business ventures but have the resolve to try again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the measures to encourage the bankrupt to work\r\n\r\ntowards  a  speedier  discharge of his bankruptcy,  perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State could also consider relaxing the  conditions\r\n\r\nfor bankrupts to travel and work outside Singapore.  I have come\r\n\r\nacross  a  number of cases where the bankrupts  have  failed  in\r\n\r\ntheir  business ventures in Singapore, or had been  structurally\r\n\r\nretrenched from their jobs, but who are willing to travel abroad\r\n\r\nto  take up employment opportunities in other countries in order\r\n\r\nto  earn a living to provide for their families, to repay  their\r\n\r\ndebts and to secure a discharge of their bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have discussed on many occasions in this House the\r\n\r\nproblems  of  structured  unemployment  .   Where  a  person  is\r\n\r\nretrenched  because  of  the particular  industry  he  has  been\r\n\r\nengaged  in  is  going  through a period  of  consolidation  and\r\n\r\nstructural changes, it would not be easy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  him  to find another job in Singapore.  And it would  be  a\r\n\r\ndouble  whammy  for  that person if, because  of  the  financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties arising from unemployment, he is made a bankrupt as\r\n\r\nwell.   Under  the existing rules, a bankrupt has  to  seek  the\r\n\r\npermission  of  the Official Assignee (OA) to do  so.   However,\r\n\r\nsuch  permission from the OA may be declined or  delayed  for  a\r\n\r\nwhole  host of reasons.  One of the key concerns is in  ensuring\r\n\r\nthat  the  bankrupt  would  fulfil his obligations  towards  his\r\n\r\ncreditors and the OA when he is free to leave the country.  Yet,\r\n\r\nthe  job abroad may offer just the most crucial opportunity  for\r\n\r\nthe bankrupt to turn his life around.  Therefore, I believe that\r\n\r\nwe  should  find ways of fine-tuning the present  conditions  to\r\n\r\nallow  the  bankrupt to work overseas while  at  the  same  time\r\n\r\nsecuring his return to repay his debts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although changes to existing legislation are necessary for\r\n\r\nthe  changing  needs of our society, we must of course  bear  in\r\n\r\nmind the need to balance the interest of the individual bankrupt\r\n\r\nand  those of his creditors.  It is also important that the  new\r\n\r\nrules  are not open to abuse.  In this connection, I would  like\r\n\r\nto   make  the  following  comments  on  some  of  the  specific\r\n\r\nprovisions proposed under the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the proposed amendment to section 95 of the\r\n\r\nBankruptcy  Act is intended to simplify the existing  procedures\r\n\r\nfor  a  bankrupt  to  propose  the  composition  and  scheme  of\r\n\r\narrangement  of his debts to his creditors and to  obtain  their\r\n\r\napproval.   The composition or scheme of arrangement  may  under\r\n\r\nthe  re-enacted  section 95 be voted on at  a  physical  general\r\n\r\nmeeting of creditors, or the votes may be put in writing through\r\n\r\nthe   post   by  the  creditors.   This  makes  it  easier   for\r\n\r\ncompositions   and  schemes  of  arrangement   to   be   settled\r\n\r\nconveniently and with less hassle.  However, the new section  95\r\n\r\nprovides  that anyone who fails to attend a meeting of creditors\r\n\r\nor  who  fails  to signify his assent or dissent in  writing  is\r\n\r\ntaken  to  have  voted  in favour of the  resolution.   This  is\r\n\r\ndifferent  from the present position whereby such  a  creditor's\r\n\r\ndebt  will  merely be disregarded in calculating the percentages\r\n\r\nof rates for or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nagainst  the  resolution. The new provision appears  to  detract\r\n\r\nfrom  the  fundamental  principle of law  that  silence  is  not\r\n\r\nassent.   The objection to this is not merely academic,  as  the\r\n\r\neffect of a successful composition under the new section  95  is\r\n\r\nthat  the rights of the creditors may be affected, ie, that they\r\n\r\nmay  have  to accept less than 100% of their debt or  compromise\r\n\r\ntheir  priority status in the ranking of creditors.   While  the\r\n\r\nnew procedures are in general welcomed, I wonder if it would  be\r\n\r\ngoing  too  far  to put undue pressure on creditors  with  these\r\n\r\ntechnicalities.   A creditor may fail to attend  a  meeting  for\r\n\r\ngood  reasons, for instance, the notice for the meeting may have\r\n\r\ngone astray.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, could the Minister clarify what is the result\r\n\r\nwhere  nobody  attends  the  meeting  or  replies  to  the  OA's\r\n\r\ninvitation to vote?  As there is no longer a requirement  for  a\r\n\r\nquorum,  it appears that composition will go through  with  100%\r\n\r\nvoting in favour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point relates to clause 8 of the Bill. The\r\n\r\nproposed section 157 deals with service of \"any summons,  notice\r\n\r\nor  document\"  and  is  thus wide enough  to  cover  service  of\r\n\r\nstatutory demands and creditors' petitions.  The old section 157\r\n\r\nmade  it  clear  that  it did not apply to the  service  of  any\r\n\r\ndocument   for  which  a  special  mode  of  service  had   been\r\n\r\nprescribed.    Thus,  the  old  section  157  operated   without\r\n\r\nprejudice  to the rule relating to personal service of statutory\r\n\r\ndemands and the rule relating to personal service of petition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 157 is not restricted in this manner and by\r\n\r\nreference  to the rules, it appears to be intended  to  override\r\n\r\nthe  rules  and  thus will conflict with these  rules.  The  new\r\n\r\nsection  157  should therefore make it clear whether  it  is  to\r\n\r\noperate  without  prejudice to the rules or notwithstanding  the\r\n\r\nrules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My preference is that it should operate notwithstanding\r\n\r\nthese  rules, which should then be repealed. This will  make  it\r\n\r\neasier  for  creditors to serve such documents  on  debtors  who\r\n\r\nfrequently evade service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHowever, this may go against the spirit of the amendments  which\r\n\r\nis to be more protective of debtors' interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this juncture I would also like to raise an\r\n\r\nancillary  point  on  the  present  section  123(1)(b)  of   the\r\n\r\nprincipal Act where there appears to be a typographical mistake.\r\n\r\nThe word \"paid\" in the second line of subsection (b) should read\r\n\r\nas  \"proved\".   This may be a good opportunity to  rectify  this\r\n\r\nerror.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point relates to the powers of the court. The new\r\n\r\namendments to the Bankruptcy Act, Companies Act and the Business\r\n\r\nRegistration Act will widen the powers of the Official Assignee.\r\n\r\nSome  of these powers were only exercisable by the Court in  the\r\n\r\npast, but now they will be exercisable by the Official Assignee.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it appears that no procedure has been provided to  allow\r\n\r\nthe  Court  to  oversee the exercise of the  OA's  discretionary\r\n\r\npowers.  There is no objection in principle in giving these wide\r\n\r\npowers to the OA.  However, the law should provide some form  of\r\n\r\nmechanism for a dissatisfied creditor to apply to the  Court  to\r\n\r\nreview, and if found fit, to have the exercise of the power  set\r\n\r\naside.  Although it is recognised that the OA's office is  in  a\r\n\r\nbetter  position than the Courts in many cases to deal with  the\r\n\r\nparticular matters which the new powers relate to, there may  be\r\n\r\nspecial circumstances in which the Courts' intervention  may  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  to bring about a fairer balance between the  interest\r\n\r\nof  the  bankrupt and those of the creditors.  In line with  the\r\n\r\nspirit of the new amendments, such a mechanism for review  could\r\n\r\ntake  the form of a quick and simple application under  the  Act\r\n\r\nrather than by cumbersome procedures for judicial review.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nthank you for giving me this opportunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill. May I suggest to the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider changing the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntitle  of  the  Act  from \"Bankruptcy Act\" to \"Insolvency  Act\".\r\n\r\n\"Bankruptcy\"  is  a  much disliked word  these  days.   We  have\r\n\r\ntransformed our bankruptcy law in the last few years and this is\r\n\r\nvery  progressive, and I would like to thank  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\ntaking  the initiative and bringing in the amendments at such  a\r\n\r\nshort notice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have some suggestions. Could the office of the\r\n\r\nOfficial Assignee and Public Trustee be corporatised to be  more\r\n\r\nservice-oriented in the long term?  I am not suggesting that  it\r\n\r\nshould  be done today.  But we should look into this on a  long-term  plan.  I have at the 1998 Budget debate praised  the  good\r\n\r\nwork  of the Official Assignee and Public Trustee.  In fact,  my\r\n\r\nfeedback  is  this.  I have had some dealings with the  Official\r\n\r\nAssignee  and Public Trustee and the department has improved  by\r\n\r\nleaps and bounds.  I have seen how effectively a bankrupt's case\r\n\r\nis being managed now and dividends paid at a shorter period than\r\n\r\nit was previously. What used to take a few years now takes a few\r\n\r\nmonths.   The backlog has been cleared not only in the  judicial\r\n\r\nsystem but also by the Official Assignee, and I think this House\r\n\r\nshould be grateful for the work done by this department.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important that businessmen who have failed\r\n\r\nshould   be   given  a  second  chance.   This  would  encourage\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.  I am glad that under clause 4, creditors  can\r\n\r\naccept  composition of this scheme by special resolution.   This\r\n\r\nclause  lays down the procedure for doing it.  I do not have  to\r\n\r\nrepeat  it.  It is gratifying to note that under section 35A  of\r\n\r\nthe Act, the Official Assignee has the power of annulment before\r\n\r\ngoing  to  Court.  Previously, applications had to  be  made  to\r\n\r\nCourt  and it was expensive and time-consuming.  Now, this power\r\n\r\nis vested in the OA and it is a very laudable clause.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a little concerned about subsection 2 of this section.\r\n\r\nIt  says  that \"notice of annulment shall be advertised  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Gazette  in  any  local  newspaper\".   I  think,  in\r\n\r\nfairness,  Sir,  the  advertisement should  be  in  one  English\r\n\r\nnewspaper  and  one  in  a vernacular language  newspaper.   The\r\n\r\ndecision should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe left to the Official Assignee as to which newspaper he wishes\r\n\r\nto choose.  But perhaps one consideration should be the debtors.\r\n\r\nIf  the  debtor  is an Indian, he may want to publish  in  Tamil\r\n\r\nMurasu.  Similarly, if he is a Malay, he may want to publish  in\r\n\r\nBerita Harian.  I think we should bear this in mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another suggestion is that the Official Assignee should\r\n\r\nfarm out some of its work to accountants and lawyers. This would\r\n\r\ngive  an opportunity for young lawyers and young accountants  to\r\n\r\npractise some insolvency laws as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I welcome section 123A. It allows for annulment\r\n\r\nof bankruptcy orders for debts that are being fully paid up.   I\r\n\r\nam  also  glad  that  section 157 has brought about  fundamental\r\n\r\nchanges.   Previously, we had what is called \"personal service\".\r\n\r\nNew section 157(1) says that service could be effected by:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(a) delivering it to him;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) by delivering it to any adult person residing at his\r\n\r\nusual or last known place of residence .;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) by leaving it at his usual or last known place of\r\n\r\nresidence or business; or\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) by forwarding it by registered post in a cover\r\n\r\naddressed  to him at his usual or last known place of  residence\r\n\r\nor business or at any address furnished by him.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing I am glad, Sir, is the composition that the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  mentioned earlier.  I am glad that  it  has  been\r\n\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the benefit of going through Mr Inderjit\r\n\r\nSingh's  speech earlier, and I support his call for  a  two-tier\r\n\r\ncategory.    I  think  it  is  something  that  is   worthy   of\r\n\r\nconsideration. Although it may not be practical now, I think  we\r\n\r\nshould give it serious thought.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a very judicious Bill. The interests of the\r\n\r\ncreditors  and  the  debtors have all been taken  into  account.\r\n\r\nFinally, I owe it to the Attorney-General's Chambers.  I wish to\r\n\r\ncongratulate  them  for this Bill which is in  simple  language.\r\n\r\nPlain  English is taking place now and I am glad.   Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister  could write a note to the Attorney-General's  Chambers\r\n\r\non this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You write.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Thank you, Mr Jeyaretnam. I will do it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> First, let me thank all the\r\n\r\nspeakers  who  have spoken.  Sir, indeed, as the  speeches  have\r\n\r\nunderscored,  it  is important to keep a proper balance  between\r\n\r\nthe interests of the creditors and the debtors.  There were some\r\n\r\nspeeches  in  this House which have reflected some  concerns  of\r\n\r\ndebtors,  and  other  speeches in this House  asking  for  more,\r\n\r\nreflecting  concerns of creditors.  I think  this  is  something\r\n\r\nwhich  we always keep in mind.  I am glad that Members  can  see\r\n\r\nthat in other exercises concerning bankruptcy laws which we had,\r\n\r\nfirst,  the  revamp in 1995, and then we continued to  fine-tune\r\n\r\nthe  law  over the last 2-3 years, we have kept this balance  in\r\n\r\nplace.  Indeed, as one or two Members have asked whether or  not\r\n\r\nthere  can  be  further refinements, the  answer  will  be  yes,\r\n\r\nbecause  no  laws  are  cast in stone,  particularly  laws  like\r\n\r\nbankruptcy  and  as  has been shown from our  track  record.   I\r\n\r\nthink, where appropriate, to maintain this balance in the  light\r\n\r\nof  changing  circumstances, as have happened,  with  the  drive\r\n\r\ntowards  technopreneurship.  These amendments have  been  partly\r\n\r\ndriven by this drive towards technopreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take the points of Members now. On Mr Chng Hee\r\n\r\nKok's  main point, he says that there are some people who  still\r\n\r\nsee  bankruptcy discharge proceedings as being rather  slow.   I\r\n\r\nthink  a  lot must depend on the bankrupt.  Because in terms  of\r\n\r\nrefinements,  firstly, to the procedures and, secondly,  to  the\r\n\r\ninsolvency  service of the Insolvency and Public Trustee  Office\r\n\r\n(IPTO),  the  Official  Assignee and his staff  have  made  many\r\n\r\nimprovements to the procedures and process of bankruptcy.   Many\r\n\r\nunits, for example, have been formed.  One unit, for example, is\r\n\r\nthe  Bankruptcy  Unit for Discharges, a special unit  formed  to\r\n\r\nspeedily  process  all  bankruptcy  discharges.   And  it   also\r\n\r\nmaintains a hot line to inform bankrupts of the status of  their\r\n\r\ncases.  Indeed, some of its innovations, like I have said,  have\r\n\r\nbeen recognised by other world-wide agencies.  One\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexample,  besides  the one I mentioned in my speech,  where  the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth Association of Public Administration and Management\r\n\r\nrecognised  its discharge by certificate process,  is  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the  IPTO last year became the first legal institution  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and the first insolvency service in the world  to  be\r\n\r\nawarded  the  ISO  9002.   And I am glad  Mr  Rai,  through  his\r\n\r\npractical  experience,  also testifies  to  the  fact  that  the\r\n\r\nprocesses  have  improved.  I think that is the first  thing  to\r\n\r\nnote.   If there is any delay in the discharge of any particular\r\n\r\nbankrupt, it is not because of the processes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OA tells me that he has in fact hired temporary staff\r\n\r\nwhen  the  need arose to cater to the demand.  He also tells  me\r\n\r\nthat  from his experience, there will always be about 20-25%  of\r\n\r\nbankrupts  who do not cooperate with his office.   They  do  not\r\n\r\nfile statements.  They do not turn up for meetings.  So it is  a\r\n\r\nmatter of getting people to understand that it is to their  full\r\n\r\nbenefit to cooperate with the OAPT, particularly in view of  the\r\n\r\ndischarge by certificate process.  It has worked for many cases,\r\n\r\nbecause this process, in fact, encourages deserving bankrupts to\r\n\r\ncooperate.  And if they do and they fit within the requirements,\r\n\r\nthen the OAPT can consider selecting such deserving bankrupts to\r\n\r\nbe discharged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other group of people who may hold up discharges are\r\n\r\nthe  creditors.   So  besides  the  bankrupts,  there  are  also\r\n\r\ncreditors  who  hold  up the discharge process,  in  respect  of\r\n\r\noffers of composition by bankrupts.  They do not respond to  the\r\n\r\nOA's letters, despite many reminders.  This can be quite taxing.\r\n\r\nThis is in fact one of the problems being addressed by the Bill,\r\n\r\nthat debtors who come forward, cooperate and who are able to put\r\n\r\ntogether an offer of composition or scheme of arrangement should\r\n\r\nnot  be  held back by creditors who do not respond to  the  many\r\n\r\nletters calling for meetings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok also asked whether the new guidelines will\r\n\r\napply to bankrupts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhose  process  of  discharge has begun.   Of  course,  the  new\r\n\r\nguidelines  will apply to all outstanding cases.  So  they  will\r\n\r\nbenefit should they satisfy the requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh is another strong proponent for\r\n\r\ncreditors.    He  applauds  the  Government  for  making   these\r\n\r\ninnovations to the Bill and, indeed, I want to thank him because\r\n\r\nI  think  he  captures the spirit behind the Bill, which  is  to\r\n\r\nencourage  entrepreneurship.  On the other  hand,  like  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid, we have to keep in mind the central point that we want  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  a  balance  between  the  interest  of  creditors  and\r\n\r\ndebtors.  So we cannot go overboard.  We must keep this in mind,\r\n\r\nbecause otherwise if bankrupts are able to get out of bankruptcy\r\n\r\ntoo  easily without showing effort on their part, that may  also\r\n\r\nincrease  business costs.  That may also increase the reluctance\r\n\r\nof  bankers  to lend money.  I think that is the central  point.\r\n\r\nHis points are well made, but, at the same time, we have to keep\r\n\r\nthis balance in mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his suggestion for a faster discharge process for high-tech businesses, as I have said, we have moved it down from five\r\n\r\nyears  to  three  years.  The three years will enable  the  OAPT\r\n\r\nsufficient  time  to study the circumstances of the  bankruptcy,\r\n\r\nand  will also give the bankrupt an opportunity to show that  he\r\n\r\nis prepared to work with the OAPT.  All these factors are indeed\r\n\r\ntaken  into consideration.  If he does meet the criterion,  when\r\n\r\nthree  years  are  up, he will be considered  for  discharge  by\r\n\r\ncertificate.  I think we should keep it at that, and  not  lower\r\n\r\nthe 3-year criterion.  Let us see how the process works, and  if\r\n\r\ncircumstances warrant it, of course, we can consider it down the\r\n\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is not to put this 3-year limit as an absolute\r\n\r\nbar.   If  a  bankrupt is able to make an offer of  composition,\r\n\r\nwhich  is accepted by the creditors or indeed has paid up fully,\r\n\r\nthen  he  will  be  discharged immediately, once  the  creditors\r\n\r\nagree.   So  the  3-year  bar  is not  an  impediment  in  those\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  Indeed, the OAPT tells me that there  have  been\r\n\r\nbankrupts who have been able to get out of bankruptcy  within  a\r\n\r\nweek.  So a lot depends on how quickly they cooperate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His observations on the importance of pre-bankruptcy\r\n\r\nmediation are very valid ones.  Indeed, Mr Singh will  be  happy\r\n\r\nto  know  that  the  Ministry of Law is  now  working  with  the\r\n\r\nOfficial Assignee and the Singapore Mediation Centre on  a  pre-bankruptcy  mediation programme.  Once the  details  are  ready,\r\n\r\nthey  will  be announced.  In the meantime, the OAPT is  already\r\n\r\nexploiting  mediation, not at the pre-bankruptcy stage,  but  at\r\n\r\nthe  post-bankruptcy  stage.  A Bankruptcy  Mediation  Unit  was\r\n\r\nformed  earlier  this  year  to provide  mediation  services  to\r\n\r\nbankrupts  and  creditors to encourage them to  work  towards  a\r\n\r\nsettlement.  I have been told that to-date, 104 cases have  been\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  mediated.  So lessons which are  learned  by  this\r\n\r\nUnit  can,  of  course,  be applied to pre-bankruptcy  processes\r\n\r\nwhich  are also important, because then it will keep the  person\r\n\r\naway from the bankruptcy regime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Inderjit Singh also asked about\r\n\r\nthe criteria and the process by which the OA will decide whether\r\n\r\nor  not  to allow bankrupts to manage businesses or be directors\r\n\r\nof  companies.  Both in New Zealand and Malaysia, it is  the  OA\r\n\r\nwho grants such permission.  The OA is looking into the criteria\r\n\r\nthat  are used in these countries before finalising the  factors\r\n\r\nthat he would consider.  What is important is that in processing\r\n\r\nsuch  applications, the OA will consider the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\npublic,  the  creditors and the bankrupt.   He  will  take  into\r\n\r\naccount a number of factors which will include, first, the cause\r\n\r\nof  bankruptcy;  secondly,  previous  involvement  in  a  failed\r\n\r\nbusiness   or  company;  thirdly,  liability  of  the   proposed\r\n\r\nbusiness; and, fourthly, whether creditors will benefit from the\r\n\r\nproposed  business.  These are the factors which will guide  his\r\n\r\ndeliberations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said just now that the OA is well placed to make\r\n\r\nthis  consideration  because he and  his  staff  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nbankrupt on a continual basis.  So he will be able to assess not\r\n\r\njust their ability to pay but their character and whether or not\r\n\r\nthey  will fulfil these criteria.  Certainly, when he makes  his\r\n\r\ndecision,  he  is  not  going to act alone.   There  will  be  a\r\n\r\ncommittee that will assist him in the OA's office.  The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommittee will include other professionals like accountants  who\r\n\r\ncan  also help him make a professional judgment.  Let me  assure\r\n\r\nthis House that the OA will make his decisions very judiciously,\r\n\r\ntaking into consideration the factors that I have mentioned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min asked about this perennial question of\r\n\r\ntravelling  for bankrupts, particularly bankrupts  who  want  to\r\n\r\nwork  overseas.  He says in the past, it was so difficult.   The\r\n\r\nbankrupt works overseas to help him pay off his debts,  get  him\r\n\r\noff  the  bankruptcy,  helps everybody,  but  the  bankrupt  has\r\n\r\ndifficulty travelling.  I think he will be very pleased to  know\r\n\r\nthat  this is a problem of the past, because the OAPT  tells  me\r\n\r\nthat  in so far as working overseas is concerned, he is now more\r\n\r\nrelaxed.   This  is  set  out  in  a  brochure,  The  Bankruptcy\r\n\r\nInformation  Sheet  No. 5.  There are many  such  pamphlets  and\r\n\r\nbrochures on various matters which have been produced and  which\r\n\r\nare  easily available, helping bankrupts along.  This one  deals\r\n\r\nwith  travelling  overseas, which says that a bankrupt  will  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to travel overseas or remain abroad if he is   required\r\n\r\nto do so in the course of his employment.  All that the bankrupt\r\n\r\nneeds  to do is to produce the employer's letter indicating  the\r\n\r\nneed to travel.  Indeed between August 1998 and July 1999, there\r\n\r\nwere 1,509 applications for bankrupts to travel for purposes  of\r\n\r\nemployment.   And  of these, only 6 or 0.4% were  rejected.   So\r\n\r\nthis will be good news for bankrupts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min makes a few points about the Bill itself.\r\n\r\nOne concern that he expresses is the amendment to section 95, as\r\n\r\nto  the creditors' silence on a composition offer, whether  that\r\n\r\nis  unfair  to the creditors.  On the other hand, other  Members\r\n\r\nwho  have  spoken  appreciate the thrust behind this  amendment.\r\n\r\nBecause here is a situation where you have creditors who, in the\r\n\r\npast,  might have received letters informing them of the meeting\r\n\r\nbut  they  did not attend.  This holds up the process.   Really,\r\n\r\nthe  important  point is that the notice of the meeting  or  the\r\n\r\nnotice  that  they can object in writing must  be  sent  to  the\r\n\r\ncreditors.  And this will be done because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nregistered  post  will  be used.  Since a  large  percentage  of\r\n\r\ncreditors are institutions, companies, businesses  -  more  than\r\n\r\n80%   -   the  likelihood of wrong address  or  the  letter  not\r\n\r\nreaching  the place is very minimum.  Indeed, the OAPT tells  me\r\n\r\nthat   for   many  of  these  situations,  creditors   who   are\r\n\r\ninstitutions  have  written off these  debts  and  are  not  too\r\n\r\nconcerned.   In fact, they may agree to the composition  but  in\r\n\r\nthe  past  they have never replied.  So this new amendment  will\r\n\r\nhelp  expedite the process.  Indeed, this is not a new situation\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have  other  provisions in our  law  where  silence\r\n\r\nconstitutes  consent.  Those lawyers who do  criminal  law  will\r\n\r\nknow  that.  An accused person who is served a notice of warning\r\n\r\ncontaining charges made against him, if he keeps silent, adverse\r\n\r\ninference  can  be drawn against him.  Even in the  Act  itself,\r\n\r\nsection  126  provides for a similar provision for discharge  by\r\n\r\ncertificate of the OA, which says that if the creditor does  not\r\n\r\nobject  to  a  notice  of  the OA's  intention  to  discharge  a\r\n\r\nbankrupt,  he  is deemed to have no objection to the  discharge.\r\n\r\nSo this, in fact, has already been used in the current discharge\r\n\r\nscheme  which has worked very well.  It is really just  applying\r\n\r\nit  in other situations where it can be seen that from practical\r\n\r\nexperience  the OA is very clear that it will help expedite  the\r\n\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is section 157. Mr Rai also brings up this\r\n\r\npoint.   Of  course, the amendment makes it easier  for  various\r\n\r\nnotices  and summons to be served.  However, in so  far  as  the\r\n\r\ndocument  relates  to  the  creditor's petitions  and  statutory\r\n\r\ndemands,  the current position of the need for personal  service\r\n\r\nstill  applies.  It must be so because these amendments  are  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the bankrupt.  It is not to dispense with personal service\r\n\r\nwhere  the creditors want to petition him for bankruptcy.   This\r\n\r\nis  done  because there are express provisions in the Bankruptcy\r\n\r\nAct  (sections 52 and 62) which specifically mention that  these\r\n\r\ndocuments are to be served in a manner which is prescribed,  and\r\n\r\nthe  rules  in fact prescribe personal service.  These  sections\r\n\r\nclear up this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that Mr Ong mentioned is recourse to\r\n\r\ncourts.  I do not know whether he knows that section 30  in  the\r\n\r\nBankruptcy Act states very clearly that the OA is subject to the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of the court, and section 31 specifically empowers  the\r\n\r\ncourt  to  review the OA's act on application of a  dissatisfied\r\n\r\nbankrupt,  creditor or any other person.  This is a very  simple\r\n\r\nprocess.  All it entails is an application to court which  would\r\n\r\nbe  heard in chambers, like any other summons.  Even though  the\r\n\r\nAct  does give more powers to the OA, firstly, the assurance  to\r\n\r\nthe  House  is  that the OA, as the record shows, will  exercise\r\n\r\nthese  powers  judiciously.   Secondly,  these  amendments   are\r\n\r\nprocedural rather than substantive.  Thirdly, sections 30 and 31\r\n\r\nwill enable recourse to the courts by any dissatisfied bankrupt,\r\n\r\ncreditor  or any other person who may want to seek redress  from\r\n\r\nan OA's action.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai makes two suggestions, one complimenting the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General and the other about improving  service  in  the\r\n\r\nIPTO.  I think he will know that the IPTO was made an autonomous\r\n\r\nagency  some  years ago and that has improved its services.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  if the need arises, and if it is useful for  it  to  be\r\n\r\ncorporatised, that can be considered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the remaining items on the Order\r\n\r\nPaper  for  today  be exempted at this day's  sitting  from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House endorses the Principles for Determining and\r\n\r\nSafeguarding the Accumulated Reserves of the Government and  the\r\n\r\nFifth Schedule Statutory Boards and Government Companies as  set\r\n\r\nout  in  the  White Paper (Paper Cmd. 5 of 1999)  [presented  to\r\n\r\nParliament on 2nd July 1999].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after listening to the Prime Minister, the\r\n\r\nSenior Minister and the Minister for Finance yesterday, I was in\r\n\r\ntwo  minds about whether I should proceed with the motion.  Some\r\n\r\nBackbenchers felt that I should not proceed.  I have  considered\r\n\r\nthe position and I am going to proceed with this motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Principles laid down in the White Paper were\r\n\r\narrived  at  after  consultation  with  the  President  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   It is reassuring to note that if any issues  arise\r\n\r\nand  are  not  addressed  in the Principles,  the  parties  will\r\n\r\nresolve  in  accordance  with  the  spirit  and  intent  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.   I  repeat the words \"spirit and  intent  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution\".   This  is  in  keeping  with   the   spirit   of\r\n\r\nconciliation and consensus we are trying to build in this  young\r\n\r\nrepublic.  It is a part of our Shared Values as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the importance of the Principles, I can do no better\r\n\r\nthan  to quote the President's letter.  I quote: \"will make  for\r\n\r\ngreater  certainty and clarity in approaching matters  affecting\r\n\r\nthe  reserves\".   Here  again the key words  are  certainty  and\r\n\r\nclarity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper will serve as a public record of the\r\n\r\nconvention,  and  convention  forms  an  important   branch   of\r\n\r\nconstitutional law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper will become an important reference\r\n\r\npoint  in future.  May I have your permission to quote from  the\r\n\r\ndocument itself:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The constitutional practice embodied in these Principles\r\n\r\nis  open to future evolution and refinement by future Presidents\r\n\r\nand  Governments.  This is necessary as over time the Government\r\n\r\nwill make new transactions and policies, and the Principles will\r\n\r\nneed  to  be  extended or adapted to deal with  these  presently\r\n\r\nunforeseen situations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By endorsing this motion, we would be giving the Principles\r\n\r\nsanctity of a resolution which I think this White Paper  rightly\r\n\r\ndeserves.  It will gain public confidence and it will  have  the\r\n\r\napproval  of  the  highest  forum of the  land,  that  is,  this\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our Elected Presidency is a new\r\n\r\ninstitution.  It will take some time to shape.  We must give the\r\n\r\ninstitution  a  chance to develop.  We must  not  get  ourselves\r\n\r\nunduly  concerned  if  there are minor  differences  as  to  the\r\n\r\nmethods  of  achieving the Principles enshrined  in  this  White\r\n\r\nPaper as well as in the Constitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a practising lawyer and a student of constitutional law,\r\n\r\nlet me share with this House my belief in the Constitution.   In\r\n\r\nour  Constitution, the President is still the  titular  head  of\r\n\r\nstate.   He  is  elected by the people but he has  no  executive\r\n\r\npower.   He  acts on the advice of the Cabinet but he  is  given\r\n\r\nextra powers to protect the reserves as well as the integrity of\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service.  He has veto power dealing  with  religious\r\n\r\nharmony  and ISA.  If there is a hung parliament, as it  happens\r\n\r\nin   India,  he  plays  an  important  constitutional  role   in\r\n\r\nappointing the Prime Minister.  Let us pray and hope that we  do\r\n\r\nnot have a hung parliament in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President does not have the power to initiate policies.\r\n\r\nThis  still remains in the domain of the government of  the  day\r\n\r\nwhich  derives its legitimacy from the mandate it  obtains  from\r\n\r\nthe electorate at General Election where political parties offer\r\n\r\ntheir policies to the electorate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President does no such thing. The Presidential\r\n\r\ncandidate  does  not  go before the country with  any  political\r\n\r\nplatform.  Mr S. R. Nathan has not gone to the country with  any\r\n\r\npolitical platform.  He asks the country to give him the mandate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  discharge his constitutional responsibilities.  And I repeat\r\n\r\nthe words \"constitutional responsibilities\" which I have defined\r\n\r\nearlier.   This  distinction  must be  appreciated.   The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and  his  Cabinet are accountable to this  Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe President does not have to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make this clear because some people think that\r\n\r\nthe  power base has changed.  It has not.  Having said that,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, we cannot run away that the President is the  Head\r\n\r\nof  State.  He symbolises our nationhood.  We owe our loyalty to\r\n\r\nhim.   He bestows honour to our citizens.  He is patron to  many\r\n\r\ncharities  and art groups.  In short, he is a symbol  of  power.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore of utmost importance that the powers bestowed on\r\n\r\nhim should be respected.  His standing must never be undermined.\r\n\r\nHe   is   not  the  ruling  Party's  President  or  Opposition's\r\n\r\nPresident.  He is our President, the entire country, and we must\r\n\r\nbear this in mind at all times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the idea of Elected Presidency came from the mind of\r\n\r\nthe  then  Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.  He  has  given  his\r\n\r\nthinking  during the Straits Times interview recently.   Members\r\n\r\nhave  read  it.   I  do  not  have to repeat  it.   His  younger\r\n\r\ncolleagues  accepted  the principle of  Elected  Presidency  and\r\n\r\nworked for it.  It became an electoral issue in 1988 and the PAP\r\n\r\nwon  the  battle  against the Opposition's call to  curtail  the\r\n\r\npower.   We have had a lengthy debate on the Elected Presidency.\r\n\r\nTwo White Papers were published.  Public hearings took place  in\r\n\r\nthe  Select Committee where there was an exchange of ideas.  And\r\n\r\nI  think  some of the ideas from the representors were  in  fact\r\n\r\nincorporated in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the nature of the office, in my submission\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Select Committee, I had pleaded that the Presidency\r\n\r\nshould  be  above  party politics and I am  glad  all  political\r\n\r\nparties  have  done so.   While the Cabinet and  other  MPs  are\r\n\r\nentitled  to  support  the  Presidential  candidates,  political\r\n\r\nparties  must  never  get  involved  in  the  campaign  for  the\r\n\r\nPresidential Election.  Otherwise the President\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  be  beholden.  Sir, I have a terrible dislike of the  word\r\n\r\n\"beholden\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the President's address to the press has\r\n\r\ngiven  rise to public concern about the constitutional mechanism\r\n\r\nto  safeguard  our reserves.  We must address  and  answer  this\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitution is not a writ in stone. It is a living\r\n\r\ndocument   that  requires  changes,  interpretation   and   even\r\n\r\namendments  from  time to time to meet the requirements  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  If the Constitution has to be amended, so be  it.   We\r\n\r\nshould debate it in public and see if it could be accepted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elected President and the Government have both worked\r\n\r\nin a very harmonious manner.  It must be so.  I remember vividly\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister,  who  was  then  the  First  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  said  that the Government was prepared  to  have  its\r\n\r\nwings clipped.  There was no clamour to change the system.   The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister did on his own initiative for the  good  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  The Prime Minister said, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Bear in mind that in introducing this Bill, the present\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  in  fact  clipping  its  own  wings.   Once  the\r\n\r\nConstitutional amendment is effected, this Government will  have\r\n\r\nsome of its powers checked.  The new Prime Minister will need to\r\n\r\nseek  the  concurrence of the President in certain key areas  of\r\n\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has rightly pointed out his position.\r\n\r\nHowever, the power base did not change, and in fairness  to  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister he did tell the House, and I quote again:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Let me stress here, however, that the Bill does not\r\n\r\ntransfer  the power of government to the Elected President,  nor\r\n\r\nvest  in  him  absolute veto power.  Firstly,  even  though  the\r\n\r\nPresident  is  elected by the people, he  is  not  the  Head  of\r\n\r\nGovernment.   He  is the Head of State.  He  is  not  the  Chief\r\n\r\nExecutive  of  the  country.   The  Prime  Minister  is.     The\r\n\r\ninitiative and responsibility of governing Singapore stays  with\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government, Ministers and civil\r\n\r\nservants  must at all times try to help the President by  giving\r\n\r\nhim the necessary information.  If the President and his Council\r\n\r\nof  Advisers are not given the necessary information,  then  the\r\n\r\nPresident is hampered from making\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhis  decision.   This  will  do no good  to  the  country.   The\r\n\r\nPresident  must  have the right to call for  papers  and  summon\r\n\r\nofficers when the need arises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist the President, I am proposing to the Government\r\n\r\nthat  a  high  ranking officer be appointed by the President  to\r\n\r\nassist  him.   This  high ranking officer should  have  his  own\r\n\r\nofficials  to  assist  him.  We can call him  Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nPresident.  I leave it to the draftsman to think of a name.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to know that the President\r\n\r\nhas  no  problem  in  safeguarding the integrity  of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice.  This is very comforting.  I take pride in this because\r\n\r\nwithout  an  honest and dedicated civil service  we  will  never\r\n\r\nsucceed in building a peaceful and prosperous Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another concern in the President's address\r\n\r\nwas  the  need for a good and honest government.   Many  of  us,\r\n\r\nespecially  those who are young, take it for granted that  there\r\n\r\nwill  always  be honest government.  We have maintained  a  high\r\n\r\nstandard of integrity and honesty.  It is to the credit  of  the\r\n\r\nfounding fathers who paid a premium on a clean government.  Some\r\n\r\nyounger Members may not remember the clown and corrupt Ministers\r\n\r\nwe  used to have in this House.  They do not even know who  Chew\r\n\r\nSwee  Kee  is.  It is important that whichever party  forms  the\r\n\r\ngovernment, we must maintain this high standard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no use having the constitutional protection in the\r\n\r\nPresidency if we do not have an honest and open government.   It\r\n\r\nis  in this spirit that we must institutionalise the process and\r\n\r\nI  urge all political parties in Singapore to make it as a  part\r\n\r\nof their political platform and culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corruption here is indeed almost non-existent. Whenever\r\n\r\ncorruption  charges are before the courts,  the  courts  take  a\r\n\r\nserious view.  Mr Speaker, Sir, hon. Members travel from time to\r\n\r\ntime to other countries.  We can see how the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncustoms  and immigration officials conduct their work.  In  some\r\n\r\ncountries,  they  ask for baksheesh as if  it  was  their  birth\r\n\r\nright.   Corruption is indeed almost non-existent here.   It  is\r\n\r\npart of a political culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want hon. Members to consider this aspect rather\r\n\r\nthan  the earlier aspect more closely.  We are a country without\r\n\r\nnatural   resources  except  our  people  and  our   system   of\r\n\r\ngovernment.   We  must institutionalise this  virtue  of  honest\r\n\r\nGovernment in every sphere of our life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like good health, we take good government for granted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I end my speech with this remark. We are a young\r\n\r\nnation.   Our institutions are still evolving.  We must  try  to\r\n\r\nevolve  a  system of government that suits, and  I  repeat,  our\r\n\r\nsocial,  economic  and political needs.  We cannot  just  borrow\r\n\r\nfrom  other  countries' constitution.  We must  custom-make  our\r\n\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in two weeks' time, the President will leave the\r\n\r\noffice.   I  want  hon. Members to join me in thanking  him  for\r\n\r\nhaving  discharged his responsibility with dignity  and  honour.\r\n\r\nHe  has won the hearts of the people.  The House will join me in\r\n\r\nwishing  him  the best in the days to come.  Mr  President,  you\r\n\r\nhave made us proud.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask hon. Members to support the motion which I have moved\r\n\r\nand which has the support of my colleague, Dr Lee Tsao Yuan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have an amendment to the\r\n\r\nmotion, but before I speak on the amendment, I have a few  words\r\n\r\nto say on the motion itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am objecting to the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On what grounds, Mr Rai?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Could I have the floor, Mr Jeyaretnam?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You can object to the amendment later,\r\n\r\nunless you are saying it is a question of principle.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Point of order and clarification as\r\n\r\nwell, Mr Jeyaretnam.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your objection, Mr Rai?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> May I have the floor, Sir?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam has totally taken\r\n\r\naway  my motion.  It is not an amendment to the motion.  He  had\r\n\r\nbeen the Registrar of the Supreme Court.  He knows the procedure\r\n\r\nvery  well.   He must have my amendment in some form  or  other.\r\n\r\nWhat  he has done is that he has completely taken out my  motion\r\n\r\nand  put in his amendment, which is wrong.  I want a ruling from\r\n\r\nyou, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam's amendment is before the House.\r\n\r\nUnder Standing Order No. 35, an amendment may be proposed to the\r\n\r\nmotion  if it is relevant thereto.  The question now is  whether\r\n\r\nthe amendment is relevant to your motion or not, Mr Rai.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erskine May is very clear on this matter. It states that\r\n\r\nthe object of an amendment may be either to modify a question in\r\n\r\nsuch a way as to increase its acceptability or to present to the\r\n\r\nHouse  a different proposition as an alternative to the original\r\n\r\nquestion.  This latter purpose may be effected by moving to omit\r\n\r\nall  or  most of the words of the question after the first  word\r\n\r\n\"That\"  and to substitute an alternative proposition which  must\r\n\r\nhowever be relevant to the subject of the question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Mr Jeyaretnam's amendment, I find that the words\r\n\r\nin  his  amendment are relevant to the subject under  discussion\r\n\r\nand  that, being the case, I rule that Mr Jeyaretnam's amendment\r\n\r\nis in order.  You may proceed, Mr Jeyaretnam.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Thank you for your ruling, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. I hope you\r\n\r\nwill give me another five minutes stolen by Mr Rai.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am sorry.

As I said, I\r\n\r\nhave a few words to say on the motion and that is, first of all,\r\n\r\nI  must  express the amazement I felt when I received the notice\r\n\r\nfrom the Clerk that Mr Shriniwas Rai was moving this motion.  If\r\n\r\nany  motion  is to be moved, I would have thought it would  have\r\n\r\ncome from one of the Ministers of the Government.  They are  the\r\n\r\nparty  to this agreement, not Mr Shriniwas Rai, and he is not  a\r\n\r\nMinister  of the Government, unless he thinks he is a member  of\r\n\r\nthe Government already.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is a very\r\n\r\nuncalled-for remark.  I am not part of the Government and  I  do\r\n\r\nnot aspire to be part of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> So I was surprised to see that it comes\r\n\r\nfrom a Nominated Member of Parliament.  Be that as it may, it is\r\n\r\nmy  proposition  here  that  this agreement  has  lost  all  its\r\n\r\nvalidity now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong assumed the post of President in 1993 and just three\r\n\r\nmonths  before he leaves his office, an agreement is  presented,\r\n\r\nsetting out what should be the pattern of behaviour between  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the President.  One would have thought  that  as\r\n\r\nsoon as the President has been appointed the first thing to have\r\n\r\ndone would be to come to an understanding on how the institution\r\n\r\nwas  going  to  be worked, but, no.  What is more surprising  is\r\n\r\nthat  it  comes after the Government would appear to  have  made\r\n\r\nknown  to Mr Ong that it would not support his re-election.   We\r\n\r\nwere  told  by  the  Prime Minister yesterday  that  it  was  in\r\n\r\nFebruary of this year that Mr Ong mentioned to him that he might\r\n\r\nseek re-election.  And then, apparently, the Cabinet immediately\r\n\r\ngot into a huddle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nabout  it, called for the medical reports and then informed  him\r\n\r\nthat the Cabinet could not support his re-election as President.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  the  purpose of having this agreement when  there  was\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be another new President?  Should you not wait  until\r\n\r\nthe new President takes office and then have the agreement?   So\r\n\r\nI  do  not  see  that  there  is any purpose  in  debating  this\r\n\r\nagreement at the moment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there is the Constitution which sets out clearly,\r\n\r\nI  should  have thought, the powers of the President  and  that,\r\n\r\naccording to the President, was not being strictly observed.  So\r\n\r\nwhat  guarantee  is there that this agreement will  be  strictly\r\n\r\nabided by?  I think it is a waste of time at the moment debating\r\n\r\nthis agreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have something more serious. The question that I am\r\n\r\ngoing  to  raise before this House is whether the PAP,  when  it\r\n\r\ninstituted this office of an Elected President to have executive\r\n\r\npowers over the Government, was serious or whether it was all  a\r\n\r\nshow.   I  am  going  to explain why I ask this  question.   The\r\n\r\nquestion that has to be answered is: was all this just a show, a\r\n\r\npretence, a game of make-believe or did the Government seriously\r\n\r\nintend to do what it said it was proposing to do?  What was  the\r\n\r\npromise that was made in July 1988 to the people of Singapore in\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper?   There  was great  publicity  given  to  it,\r\n\r\nalthough there was not enough public debate, and the analogy  of\r\n\r\nthe second key was used that the President would have the second\r\n\r\nkey;  the  Government cannot open the safe unless the  President\r\n\r\nhimself joins in and opens the safe for them.  It was said  that\r\n\r\nif  the  Government wanted to spend any past reserves,  it  must\r\n\r\nobtain the concurrence of the Elected President.  This was to be\r\n\r\na precondition, according to the PAP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what is more? The White Paper went on to say, in grand\r\n\r\nwords, \"The legitimacy and moral authority of the President  can\r\n\r\nonly  be derived from the will of the people as expressed in  an\r\n\r\nelection.\"   He  must have the moral authority  and  that  moral\r\n\r\nauthority must come from the will of the people as expressed  in\r\n\r\nan election.  And then the White Paper\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontinues,  \"The President will have the discretion to  withhold\r\n\r\nconcurrence  to decisions of the Prime Minister and  Cabinet  on\r\n\r\nthe spending of reserves and assets.  For a Cabinet decision  to\r\n\r\nbe  valid,  the second key must be used.\"  And what is important\r\n\r\nis  that  the  White  Paper sets out, \"The  President  shall  be\r\n\r\nentitled  at his request to any information on matters requiring\r\n\r\nhis  assent.   All public officers [mark these  words]  will  be\r\n\r\nplaced  under  a  legal  duty to inform the  President  whenever\r\n\r\nassets or reserves are to be used or pledged.\"  So this is  what\r\n\r\nthe  PAP  Government was telling the people, \"We are an  honest,\r\n\r\ngood  Government.   We  are  now providing  you  with  a  second\r\n\r\nsafeguard.  He is going to safeguard your reserves.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Bill was presented in Parliament, the mover of the\r\n\r\nBill,  our  present Prime Minister, then the First Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, said again that \"The President will have the right  to\r\n\r\nveto  budgets  if they draw down past reserves.\"  Bear  in  mind\r\n\r\nthat these words have been quoted by Dr Lee yesterday.  Bear  in\r\n\r\nmind  that in introducing this Bill, the present Government  was\r\n\r\nsaying it was, in fact, \"clipping its own wings\".  \"Clipping its\r\n\r\nown  wings\" means that it is depriving the Government from doing\r\n\r\nsomething  which  it previously had the power to  do.  There  is\r\n\r\nsomething  else to it where he says, \"This Government will  have\r\n\r\nsome  of its powers checked.\"  And he says in the Third Reading,\r\n\r\n\"I  am  putting my money where my mouth is.  I am subjecting  my\r\n\r\nGovernment to these new checks and balances.\" In other words, he\r\n\r\nsaid  he would accept the authority of the President over  these\r\n\r\nmatters and he would be subject to his decisions.  That was  the\r\n\r\npromise and the people were told \"we are honest men, we are  men\r\n\r\nof  integrity\".  The Government would not wait for any  loss  to\r\n\r\noccur   and   was  taking  all  sufficient  safeguards   because\r\n\r\nParliament  was  not  competent at  the  moment.   And  why  was\r\n\r\nParliament not competent?  It was simply because Parliament  was\r\n\r\ndeprived  of  an  effective opposition.  It is  very  heartening\r\n\r\nwhen, at last, the Senior Minister has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncome  to  the  realisation about the role of  an  opposition  in\r\n\r\nParliament.   He  has said what we have been saying  all  along,\r\n\r\nthat  if  you  want  a check on Government,  then  vote  in  the\r\n\r\nopposition.   And  we  hope the electorate will  remember  that.\r\n\r\nHave the opposition in.  So that was the promise of the PAP when\r\n\r\nthey introduced the office.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is the reality? We now hear from the President in\r\n\r\nhis  press conference that it was not exactly what the  PAP  had\r\n\r\npromised.   The  President was, one could see,  very  restrained\r\n\r\nwhen he spoke to the press.  He pulled his punches.  But despite\r\n\r\nall that, it was quite clear to anyone reading between the lines\r\n\r\nthat the President was disillusioned with what was promised  and\r\n\r\nthe  reality.  He spoke of a long list of problems.   I  am  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  go  into all what he said because I do not  have  the\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, we heard from the Minister, and no less than the\r\n\r\narchitect of this office, and the Prime Minister replying to the\r\n\r\nPresident.  I am not here to make a judgment on who is right and\r\n\r\nwho  is  wrong.   The President was accused of not  setting  out\r\n\r\nfacts accurately. They did not exactly call him a liar but  they\r\n\r\nsaid  he was not setting out the facts accurately.  May  I  tell\r\n\r\nthe  Government that if you think this matter should be  cleared\r\n\r\nonce and for all, then it should not just be brought before  the\r\n\r\nHouse in a debate.  You should have a committee to look into  it\r\n\r\nand  to  report  on  the  situation  that  existed  between  the\r\n\r\nPresident  and  the  Government.  And I  am  commending  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  if  they are really serious,  they  appoint  a\r\n\r\nParliamentary  committee consisting of the three opposition  MPs\r\n\r\nand  three  backbenchers  from the Government  to  consider  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  that the President said that he  had  experienced.\r\n\r\nNow that the President is leaving his office, he can be summoned\r\n\r\nby that committee to answer questions and to explain everything.\r\n\r\nAnd   so  can  the  Government  Ministers  be  summoned  by  the\r\n\r\ncommittee.   If you are serious, that is the only step  open  to\r\n\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we do not have to accept everything that the President\r\n\r\nhas said.  The Senior\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinister - I am sorry he has left the House as soon as I started\r\n\r\nto  speak, I wish he had stayed on - attempts to explain  and  I\r\n\r\nsee  he  has, in his explanations revealed the intention of  the\r\n\r\nPAP,  knowingly or unknowingly.  He has revealed the truth.   He\r\n\r\nsays,  \"There are a lot of misconceptions.\"  I do not know there\r\n\r\nwere a lot of misconceptions.  But if there were misconceptions,\r\n\r\nwho  is  responsible  for  those  misconceptions?   If  you  say\r\n\r\nsomething  and the listener or the reader understands  it  in  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  meaning, then it is obvious that you  have  not  made\r\n\r\nyourself clear.  But I thought that the Government had  made  it\r\n\r\nclear.   But he says, \"There are misconceptions.\"  Then  who  is\r\n\r\nresponsible, if not the PAP Government?  He says, \"No  executive\r\n\r\npower was granted to the President.\"  Are we playing with words,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir?  Here was the Prime Minister saying  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  with  this office we are \"clipping our wings\".   We  are\r\n\r\nsubjecting  ourselves to the President's powers.\"  I  asked  the\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister  yesterday that when the President  chooses  to\r\n\r\nexercise  his  veto, is he not using his executive  power?   The\r\n\r\nSenior Minister evaded that question and said, \"I am not here to\r\n\r\nargue  as to whether it is executive or not.\"  So are we playing\r\n\r\nwith words?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he said, \"It was never intended that the President's\r\n\r\noffice  should  be  an  independent  office  to  check  on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\"   Has he not read or heard what Mr  Goh  Chok  Tong\r\n\r\nsaid when he was moving the Bill?  He said, \"We are providing an\r\n\r\nindependent body to check.  You have this second key held by  an\r\n\r\nindependent  person.\"  What was Mr Lee doing when  Mr  Goh  said\r\n\r\nthese things in Parliament?  Was he not in Parliament then  when\r\n\r\nMr  Goh  said that the Government would be \"clipping its wings\"?\r\n\r\nHe  says,  \"I  would  never had used those  words.  It  was  not\r\n\r\nintended  that the Government's wings should be clipped.\"   Then\r\n\r\nwhy  did he not correct it then?  He was the architect.   If  he\r\n\r\nwas  the architect and he sees the workman putting a brick which\r\n\r\nshould  not be put, he should have said, \"No, no, that brick  is\r\n\r\nout  of  place.  I did not want that brick there.\"  But  nothing\r\n\r\nwas said and the people were allowed to think\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  was  really  giving  the  President   the\r\n\r\nexecutive power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, we do not just have the President's outburst. We\r\n\r\nhave  Mr Lee revealing what he thought were the powers that were\r\n\r\nbeing  given  to the President which was what the PAP  intended.\r\n\r\nBut  that  was  not what the PAP said they were  giving  to  the\r\n\r\nPresident.  So, the question is:  was all this a show,   a  show\r\n\r\nin  front of the public not meant to be carried out, but just  a\r\n\r\nshowcase, a pretext?  Singapore, Mr Speaker, Sir, is  a  lot  of\r\n\r\npretence.  We pretend that we have a national press when  we  do\r\n\r\nnot have any national press. We have a PAP press.  I do not want\r\n\r\nto go on but there are so many other things which are a pretence\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This episode has attracted attention not only in Singapore\r\n\r\nbut  outside Singapore.  It has drawn into question the  honesty\r\n\r\nand integrity of this Government. What did it mean to do when it\r\n\r\nbrought this office into being?  Did they intend to carry out or\r\n\r\nwas  it  simply a wayang and the Government continued as it  had\r\n\r\ndone  previously?  Was there any directive to the civil  service\r\n\r\nafter  the  office was instituted that they should  provide  the\r\n\r\nPresident with all information he needed because the White Paper\r\n\r\nsaid  that that would be the duty of the Ministers and the civil\r\n\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have much more time, Mr Speaker, Sir. I am going\r\n\r\nto  suggest  to the Government that it can still redeem  itself.\r\n\r\nIt  can recover some of the credibility that it has lost and  it\r\n\r\ncan  only  do  that if it now goes before the people  again  and\r\n\r\nexplain  to  them  why this has arisen.   I  say  that,  in  all\r\n\r\ndecency,  this Government should resign and I mean it.   It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  shown  up  to have instituted something which  it  had  no\r\n\r\nintention  to allow to work.  It is a confidence trick,  nothing\r\n\r\nshort  of  it.  If the Government feels that it is not necessary\r\n\r\nfor  the  whole Government to resign, then I am sorry the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  should resign.  It was he who promised the  people  in\r\n\r\nParliament what the office would be.  He should resign and go to\r\n\r\nthe people.  Let us not forget, as I keep saying in this House\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nagain  and again that it is the people that matter.  So we  have\r\n\r\ngot  to  satisfy the people.  At the moment, there is a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmumbling  going  on outside this House.  There is  a  perception\r\n\r\nthat the PAP did not want Mr Ong Teng Cheong to continue because\r\n\r\nthey  found it difficult to get along with him.  So there  is  a\r\n\r\nperception which has been lodged with me several times  that  Mr\r\n\r\nNathan  is just the Cabinet's man.  Of course, we know  it.   It\r\n\r\nwas  revealed to us.  It was the Cabinet who chose him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the words that Mr Goh used when he asked the\r\n\r\nHouse to pass the amendment?  May I repeat again:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The President must have, and be seen to have, the\r\n\r\nlegitimacy  and  moral authority derived from the  will  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  [not from the will of the Cabinet, but from the will  of\r\n\r\npeople].\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does Mr Nathan have the will of the people?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> He was elected by the people!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does Mr Nathan have the will of the people?\r\n\r\nWe  posed  this question in a press release but, of course,  the\r\n\r\nStraits Times, true to its tradition of being a servile follower\r\n\r\nof  the  Government, does not publish the press release.   So  I\r\n\r\nsay,  Mr Speaker, as we said in this press release, let us  stop\r\n\r\nall  this  pretence.  Let us be honest.  Let us go back  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  explain  to them why this has  happened.   Let  the\r\n\r\npeople  make the judgment.  And I say quite seriously  that  the\r\n\r\ninstallation of Mr Nathan should be postponed and that an Acting\r\n\r\nPresident  should  be  appointed  until  the  people  are   told\r\n\r\neverything and the matter is resolved to their satisfaction,  so\r\n\r\nthat  Singaporeans may say honestly and proudly that we  have  a\r\n\r\nPresident  that  we  elected into office, not  that  we  have  a\r\n\r\nPresident who has been foisted on us by the Cabinet.  We have no\r\n\r\nchoice and yet the PAP said, \"(its President) must be elected by\r\n\r\nthe people.\"  But after saying it, they went out of their way to\r\n\r\nsee that people will not vote anyone of their choice.  So let us\r\n\r\nstop all this humbug, all this pretence.  Let us, as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI said, be honest now with ourselves and with the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The couplet in Shakespeare comes to my mind:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To thine ownself be true\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it must follow as day follows night\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou canst not be false to anyone'\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  I  tell the PAP Government, be true to yourself.

Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  to  speak  against  the amendment  proposed  by  the  Non-Constituency Member, Mr J B Jeyaretnam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many tributes have been paid to President Ong and his\r\n\r\ndevotion  to duty, especially in the midst of grief.   Many  who\r\n\r\nwatched  the  National Day Parade have remarked on  the  courage\r\n\r\netched on the face of the President, his serenity  and composure\r\n\r\nshowing   a   fine  President  and  a  true  Singaporean.    All\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   owe  an  enormous  debt  to  our  first   elected\r\n\r\nPresident.  That is why I am particularly dismayed and  saddened\r\n\r\nthat at the end of his term in office, we in this House have  to\r\n\r\nconsider an amendment in the name of the Non-Constituency Member\r\n\r\nthat  seeks  to  bring  out all the disapproving  and  unhelpful\r\n\r\nelements in an otherwise impeccable Presidential term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Non-Constituency Member has had many opportunities\r\n\r\nyesterday to clarify his doubts, and he took advantage of  them.\r\n\r\nHe  asked  questions of the Prime Minister and Senior  Minister,\r\n\r\nand  they  were answered, though perhaps not in the way  he  had\r\n\r\nhoped  or  expected.   Yet,  at this time,  when  we  should  be\r\n\r\nconsidering   the   positive  aspects  of  the   first   elected\r\n\r\nPresidency, we are asked to make deprecatory remarks  about  the\r\n\r\nrelationship between the President and the Government.   Sir,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  we  should reject this amendment and proceed  with  the\r\n\r\noriginal motion standing in the name of the Nominated Member, Mr\r\n\r\nRai.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Non-Constituency Member repeated matters that were\r\n\r\ncomprehensively  dealt  with  in  the  Ministerial   Statements.\r\n\r\nWhilst  not  wishing to prolong discussion on them, may  I  just\r\n\r\ndraw  on  the  main  points  of the two  Ministerial  Statements\r\n\r\nyesterday  to  rebut the Non-Constituency Member's  observations\r\n\r\nthat  there needs to be a committee of inquiry.   First of  all,\r\n\r\nthere was no attempt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  block  the  President's efforts to  exercise  his  custodial\r\n\r\npowers.  And that in the one incident referred to regarding  the\r\n\r\nCPF  Board,  the  issue was one of accounting standards  and  of\r\n\r\ncorrectly interpreting the Budget figures, and this is also  the\r\n\r\ncase with the meaning of the net investment income vis-a-vis the\r\n\r\npast reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, and more broadly, both the Prime Minister and\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance have reiterated that the Government,  ie,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers and the civil service, treated the President with\r\n\r\ngreat respect and answered all his queries.  There is no failure\r\n\r\nto  give  the President the cooperation to enable him to perform\r\n\r\nhis  functions.  There is  nothing to regret or deplore  in  the\r\n\r\nrelationship  between  the  President  and  the  Government.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that Members have all heard the accounts given  by  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister and the Minister for Finance yesterday, and  that\r\n\r\nwe  are satisfied with the explanations given.  There is no need\r\n\r\nfor  a committee of inquiry.  It is demeaning to the process  of\r\n\r\ngovernment.   There  is no case for it.   The  matter  has  been\r\n\r\nadequately resolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we should reject this amendment and\r\n\r\nconsider  the very positive effects that have emerged  from  the\r\n\r\nfirst  Presidency.  The White Paper that has  the  status  of  a\r\n\r\nconstitutional convention is a significant document.  It shows a\r\n\r\nclose  working  relationship  between  the  President  and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  for  it  is  a  convention  that  is   reached   by\r\n\r\nconsultation and consensus.  This does not suggest, as the  Non-Constituency  Member  suggests, a  confrontational  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween the two institutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we, in Singapore, have adopted a unique form of\r\n\r\ngovernment,  of  two elected institutions  -  the President  and\r\n\r\nParliament.  We have also laid down in our Constitution that the\r\n\r\nPresident  generally shall act in accordance with the advice  of\r\n\r\nthe  Cabinet.    The executive powers reside with  the  Cabinet,\r\n\r\nwhich  in turn comprises Ministers who  are all Members of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  and  answerable  to it.  The principle  of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ngovernment remains paramount.  This is so whether the  President\r\n\r\nis elected or not, and we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  playing  with  words.  The President is very  much  like  a\r\n\r\npassenger in a car with his hand hovering over the handbrake  in\r\n\r\ncase the driver does something rash.  When the car is travelling\r\n\r\nwell,  there  is  no need for the passenger to worry  about  the\r\n\r\ndriver.   It  is only when the driver becomes rash  or  reckless\r\n\r\nthat  the  passenger  would  need to  have  his  hand  over  the\r\n\r\nhandbrake in case there is any unintended danger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President, as a custodian, has veto powers on the use\r\n\r\nof  past reserves and the appointment of senior public officials\r\n\r\nconferred  on  him.  The relationship between the President  and\r\n\r\nthe Government is regulated both by the written Constitution and\r\n\r\nby  constitutional conventions.  That is clearly  correct.   The\r\n\r\nuse  of constitutional conventions allows the President and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to evolve and keep in touch with the growth of ideas.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it keeps the Constitution up to date.  Such a convention\r\n\r\nmakes the Constitution a living constitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, Sir, I ask that the amendment moved by the\r\n\r\nNon-Constituency Member be speedily and decisively rejected.\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport the amended motion moved by the Secretary-General of the\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1990, the PAP Government amended the Constitution to\r\n\r\ninstitute  the office of Elected President in what was  supposed\r\n\r\nto  be  a  move to \"clip the wings\" of the Government.  Yet,  in\r\n\r\n1994,  the  PAP  Government again amended the Constitution,  and\r\n\r\nthis time, it was to clip the wings of the President.  Under the\r\n\r\namended  Constitution, the President's consent is  not  required\r\n\r\nfor  defence expenditure.  Even if he knows it, he has no  power\r\n\r\nto  veto  it  and to make it public.  The Monetary Authority  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  (MAS)  no longer comes under the supervision  of  the\r\n\r\nPresident.  There were also some other amendments.  As a result,\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noriginal  intention  of having the President  to  safeguard  the\r\n\r\nnational  reserves is thus diminished.   Although  it  was  said\r\n\r\nthat  the Elected President was holding a \"second key\", the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment changed the lock!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has become apparent to us that it is not the President\r\n\r\nbut  the Council of Presidential Advisers who is having the veto\r\n\r\npower.    More  than  half  of the members  of  the  Council  of\r\n\r\nPresidential Advisers were appointed by the Government,  and  in\r\n\r\nthe event of a tie in the votes, the Chairman of the Council has\r\n\r\nthe  last say.   Even if the President vetoes the advice of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil,  Parliament can also overturn the President's  decision\r\n\r\nby a two-thirds majority.  Under the current circumstances of  a\r\n\r\nPAP  dominated Parliament, the Elected President is  actually  a\r\n\r\nnominal   post.   Can  he  effectively  safeguard  our  national\r\n\r\nreserves and our security?  No.  From our experience of the  way\r\n\r\nthe  first  Elected  President operated, we can  see  that  this\r\n\r\nsystem  is  not  functioning effectively at all.   There  is  no\r\n\r\ntransparency  in  the workings between the  Government  and  the\r\n\r\nPresident.   It  is  only after the first Elected  President  is\r\n\r\nabout  to  step  down  that we see problems  exist  between  the\r\n\r\nPresident and the Government.  It has already become a thing  of\r\n\r\nthe past, and only then do the people know about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Elected President is actually nominated by\r\n\r\nthe  Government.   The word \"elected\" is a  misnomer.   Even  if\r\n\r\npeople  were  to vote,  they  can only vote for those  whom  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   had  certified  to  be  eligible.    The   public's\r\n\r\nparticipation  in  the  whole process is  subject  to  what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  provided  for  them.   This  system   of   pre-qualification is ineffective.  It has resulted in people who are\r\n\r\neligible  refusing  to  offer themselves for  nomination,  while\r\n\r\nthose  who are willing and ready to stand for election  fail  to\r\n\r\nqualify under the rules set by the Government.  As a result, the\r\n\r\ncandidate endorsed and nominated by the Government just walks in\r\n\r\nand   is  returned  unopposed.  The  so-called  \"election\"   and\r\n\r\n\"participation  of  the  people\" have become  just  a  means  to\r\n\r\nlegitimatize the institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Workers' Party feels that if we want to\r\n\r\neffectively  safeguard the people's assets and the  security  of\r\n\r\nthe   country,  we  should  have  more  opposition  Members   in\r\n\r\nParliament so that the Government will be checked when  it  does\r\n\r\nanything against the interest of the people, they have  to  face\r\n\r\nthe   challenge  of  opposition  and  the  prospect  of   losing\r\n\r\nparliamentary seats in elections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 12th August 1988, when the then First Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister was speaking on the amendment, he said, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A weak and/or opportunistic Government together with a\r\n\r\nweak  opportunistic President, and both belonging  to  the  same\r\n\r\nparty.  Under that scenario, I think it is hopeless.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were the words of the Prime Minister. In fact, what\r\n\r\nthe  people have to worry about is not a scenario in which there\r\n\r\nis  an  opposition  party taking over the  Government.  What  we\r\n\r\nreally  need to worry is that you have a dominant PAP Government\r\n\r\nand  a  PAP  approved Elected President but  have  no  effective\r\n\r\nopposition  having  the  ability to  serve  as  a  mechanism  to\r\n\r\nexercise  checks  and  balances on the  Government.   Under  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  there  may come a day when  the  PAP  Government\r\n\r\nsquanders away all the reserves of the nation and then Singapore\r\n\r\nreally is \"hopeless\", as the PM had said.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Thank you, Sir, for\r\n\r\nallowing  me  to join in the debate.

It\r\n\r\nhad good reasons to do so.  It persisted that the institution of\r\n\r\nthe  Elected  President was installed so that it could  be  used\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Opposition should the Opposition be  elected  into\r\n\r\npower.   I can see that some of the younger Members are  smiling\r\n\r\nin  this House.  They think that the Opposition cannot get  into\r\n\r\npower,  but the Senior Minister and the older PAP Members  think\r\n\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1981, Anson was lost. Then in the 1984 general\r\n\r\nelections, not only two seats fell to the Opposition  but,  more\r\n\r\nimportantly,  there  was  a 12.3% swing  of  the  votes  to  the\r\n\r\nOpposition. That massive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nswing of the pendulum towards the Opposition shocked and angered\r\n\r\nthe  Senior  Minister, who was then the Prime  Minister.   Those\r\n\r\nMembers who watched television at 3.00 on the morning after  the\r\n\r\npolling  was  over in 1984 would remember the grim face  of  the\r\n\r\nSenior Minister. That election result shocked him.  He knew that\r\n\r\nif  the pendulum swing continued at that rate, the PAP shall  be\r\n\r\nout  of  office  in another two or three general elections.   He\r\n\r\ntook  the  12.3% swing of the votes to the Opposition seriously.\r\n\r\nHe knew that if nothing was done, the Opposition shall come into\r\n\r\npower  in  10 or 15 years' time.  I believe it was the shock  of\r\n\r\nthe  big  swing of the votes to the Opposition in 1984 that  got\r\n\r\nthe Senior Minister to moot the idea of the GRCs and the Elected\r\n\r\nPresident, purportedly to preserve national wealth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members know what happened after that. The election laws\r\n\r\nwere  drastically changed to prevent further  PAP  loss  at  the\r\n\r\npolls.  The Constitution was amended to bring in the institution\r\n\r\nof  the  Elected President to protect and preserve the  national\r\n\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the institution of the Elected President is in\r\n\r\nplace, the Opposition has to make efforts to make sure that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment abides by the Constitution, and not to ride roughshod\r\n\r\nover  the Presidency.  This can easily happen since the  Elected\r\n\r\nPresident  is  very much alone.  Whereas on the other  side,  we\r\n\r\nhave  an  all-powerful, overwhelming Government which  could  be\r\n\r\nquite intimidating to the lone elected President.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Teng Cheong, the current President, dared to speak\r\n\r\nup.   Many  have  asked: how come he dares to do  so?   For  the\r\n\r\nanswer,  we  must look at the man himself.  He  was  a  die-hard\r\n\r\npolitician.  He has been toughened at the hustings.  He was also\r\n\r\na trade union man, and not an armchair one at that.  I have read\r\n\r\nthat  he  had  led  an industrial action once.   So  he  was  no\r\n\r\npushover.  He had guts.  He had courage.  I believe that it  was\r\n\r\nthis  nature of Mr Ong which compelled him to speak up to  voice\r\n\r\nhis dissatisfaction of the way the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment treated the office of the Elected President.   We  in\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition support Mr Ong's press conference of 16th  July.\r\n\r\nWe  are  happy  that  he  dared  to  speak  out,  criticise  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and  voice his dissatisfaction  with  the  way  the\r\n\r\nGovernment treated the office of the Presidency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elected President has two important custodial powers.\r\n\r\nOne  is to oversee new appointments, and the other is to protect\r\n\r\nthe reserves that have been accumulated by previous governments.\r\n\r\nWe in the Opposition shall assist the Elected President to carry\r\n\r\nout  his duties. We shall speak up in Parliament if there is any\r\n\r\nhint  that  the  Government attempts to  block  the  President's\r\n\r\neffort to exercise those powers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the amended motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, do I have the right to reply\r\n\r\nto the Member now or do I wait till I conclude?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> You have to reply at the end of the motion.

You will\r\n\r\ncontinue, Mr Rai.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was at pains\r\n\r\nexplaining to the House earlier the nature of the office of  the\r\n\r\nPresidency.   The  President is never  an  Executive  President.\r\n\r\nLeave  the Constitution alone.  Do not go to the Hansard because\r\n\r\nthe  Hansard  is  not the Constitution.  But I will  go  to  the\r\n\r\nHansard  since Mr Jeyaretnam has quoted from the Hansard  and  I\r\n\r\nwill give him his piece.  Speaking on the Second Reading of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 3) Bill\r\n\r\non 4th October 1990, the Prime Minister said, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Objective of the Bill:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for an Elected President to safeguard the\r\n\r\nreserve and integrity of the public services.  Specifically, the\r\n\r\nPresident will have:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the right to veto the annual budgets of the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  statutory boards and key Government  companies,  if\r\n\r\nthey draw down reserves accumulated during the terms of previous\r\n\r\ngovernments;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the right to veto key public service appointments; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) safeguard roles with respect to the Internal Security\r\n\r\nAct,  the  proposed Maintenance of Religious Harmony  Bill,  and\r\n\r\nCPIB.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  will  go  further.   What the Prime Minister  said  is  worth\r\n\r\nlistening to.  He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We are singularly lucky that able and honest men were in\r\n\r\ncharge of Singapore for the last 31 years.  They have not abused\r\n\r\ntheir  powers.  They have worked the parliamentary  system  very\r\n\r\nwell.   And because they have worked the system very well,  this\r\n\r\nhas  caused some people to conclude that there is nothing  wrong\r\n\r\nwith  the  present  system and that we  should  therefore  leave\r\n\r\nthings alone - do not make any modifications to the Constitution\r\n\r\nor to the system.  But in my view, the marvellous working of our\r\n\r\nparliamentary  system is due less to the merits  of  the  system\r\n\r\nthan to the integrity and quality of the people working it.  And\r\n\r\nwhile  honest men are still in charge, it is prudent for  us  to\r\n\r\ninstitute  a  system  of checks and balances  in  our  political\r\n\r\nsystem,  instead  of banking on good fortune to  throw  up  good\r\n\r\ngovernments for the next 30 years.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> There are \"checks and balances\". That\r\n\r\nis what he said.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Yes, the checks and balances are there.\r\n\r\nBut  he  was saying something more.  Sir, the other thing  I  am\r\n\r\nsaddened is this:  Mr Jeyaretnam is a lawyer and he knows  that.\r\n\r\nMr S.R.

Nathan's choice\r\n\r\nis  not just the Cabinet's choice.  He is qualified for the  job\r\n\r\nbecause  he was a former Permanent Secretary.  And may I declare\r\n\r\nmy  interest, Sir.  Mr S.R. Nathan is a member of SINDA.  I have\r\n\r\nworked  with him in SINDA.  I was at the Nomination Centre  this\r\n\r\nmorning to endorse him.  I spoke about him in May this year when\r\n\r\nthe   motion on Singapore 21was being debated and I paid tribute\r\n\r\nto  the  man  who,  because of his ability, has transformed  one\r\n\r\ncommunity  organisation.  And let me quote from Prof. Tommy  Koh\r\n\r\nwho had issued a statement to the public at large.  He says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Ambassador Nathan has the intellectual ability and moral\r\n\r\ncourage to discharge his constitutional duties as President.  Of\r\n\r\nhis intellectual powers there can be no doubt.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  was  hoping that Mr Jeyaretnam will never bring up the office\r\n\r\nof  the Presidency again, but since he has decided, he wants  us\r\n\r\nto   postpone  the  installation.   Let  us  not  shut  out  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.   Let us accept this fact.  He has  been  elected,\r\n\r\nand  I  use  the word \"elected\" by the people.  As  I  said,  he\r\n\r\nshould assume office.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with Prof. Chin that the office of\r\n\r\nPresidency should go by convention.  And that is why  I  brought\r\n\r\nup  this White Paper today to have the approval of this House to\r\n\r\ngive it the sanctity of a resolution of this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to prolong the agony of this House. Let\r\n\r\nus reject this amendment.  It does not deserve the consideration\r\n\r\nof  this  House.   Mr Chiam has said some good words  about  the\r\n\r\nsystem, but still I do not agree with him and my good friend, Mr\r\n\r\nLow,  here.   I  would  urge my NMP colleagues  and  the  entire\r\n\r\nMembers of the ruling Party to reject this, and I will reply  to\r\n\r\nother Members at a later stage, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question before the House is the amendment\r\n\r\nmoved by Mr J.

In spite  of  his  illness\r\n\r\nwhich  he  and his late wife suffered, he discharged his  duties\r\n\r\nwell.   I  would  also  like to put on  record  my  wholehearted\r\n\r\nendorsement  of  Mr S. R. Nathan's candidature for  the  Elected\r\n\r\nPresidency.   In  my capacity as Director of  the  Institute  of\r\n\r\nPolicy Studies, I have come to know and to work closely with  Mr\r\n\r\nNathan  in his capacity as Director of the Institute of  Defence\r\n\r\nand  Strategic  Studies.   I have the  highest  regard  for  his\r\n\r\nintegrity and sound judgement, and have not the slightest  doubt\r\n\r\nthat,  if  necessary, Mr Nathan as President will  exercise  his\r\n\r\ncustodial  powers responsibly and will by no means be a  yes-man\r\n\r\nof the Government.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.35 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the motion which I fully support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper carefully lays out for the first time the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  what  constitutes  past  reserves,  how   budget\r\n\r\nsurpluses are treated, what should be done in a transition  year\r\n\r\nand  the  frequency and type of information to be given  to  the\r\n\r\nPresident.   It is a meticulously written document.   I  applaud\r\n\r\nthe effort that went into producing the paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also fully endorse the objective of the White Paper which\r\n\r\nis  to  enable the President and Government to have a harmonious\r\n\r\nworking relationship.  The clarity and transparency achieved  by\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper go a long way towards removing some ambiguities\r\n\r\nwhere  reserves are concerned.  My only reservation is that  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper should have gone further in its clarification.   It\r\n\r\nis  a good first step but it is not enough.  I am rather puzzled\r\n\r\nas  to why there is such an easy escape clause.  So long as  the\r\n\r\nPresident  and  the Government agree that the Principles  apply,\r\n\r\nthey  apply.  But in the event that one party notifies the other\r\n\r\nthat it does not wish to abide by the Principles, they no longer\r\n\r\napply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to give a concrete example as an illustration.\r\n\r\nSuppose that in future the government of the day decides to sell\r\n\r\na piece of state land.  The White Paper states that the value of\r\n\r\nthe  state  land is its fair market value, in other  words,  the\r\n\r\nhighest acceptable bid by tender, and that all of this amount is\r\n\r\nconsidered  to  be past reserves.  Suppose it is boom  time  and\r\n\r\nproperty prices have doubled.  The fair market value at the time\r\n\r\nof  transaction is $20 million but the Government  returns  only\r\n\r\n$10  million to past reserves, retaining $10 million as  current\r\n\r\nreserves,  giving the reason that the fair market value  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  value  at  the  time of transaction but at  the  time  they\r\n\r\nassumed  office,  which was $10 million.   And  hence  only  $10\r\n\r\nmillion is considered to be past reserves.  In other words,  the\r\n\r\ngovernment  of the day decides not to abide by the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nand  that it then unilaterally informs the President of the  day\r\n\r\nthat  this  is the case and proceeds to return only $10  million\r\n\r\nand not $20 million to past reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What recourse does the President have to prevent the\r\n\r\nGovernment  from  doing so?  Since the Principles  are  only  in\r\n\r\noperation when both sides agree, it would appear that apart from\r\n\r\npublicising the disagreement and applying public pressure, there\r\n\r\nis very little else that the President can do.  After all, it is\r\n\r\nnot  a  dispute  regarding the use of past reserves.   It  is  a\r\n\r\ndispute regarding the definition of past reserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This simple example illustrates the point that the\r\n\r\ndisagreement  over  what  constitutes  past  reserves  can  have\r\n\r\nserious consequences for the size of past reserves, particularly\r\n\r\nwhere  the  treatment of state land is concerned.  In  my  view,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  steps should be taken to prevent the  occurrence  of\r\n\r\nsuch  a  scenario in future where the government of the day  can\r\n\r\nmerely  by  formally notifying the President not  abide  by  the\r\n\r\nPrinciples in the White Paper.  This is too easy.  It should  be\r\n\r\nmade  more difficult for either party if they wish to do so.   I\r\n\r\ntherefore  believe  that these Principles should  eventually  be\r\n\r\npart of the Constitution sometime in the future.  It should  not\r\n\r\nbe  done  so  now,  because  to cast them  in  stone  now  would\r\n\r\nintroduce too much rigidity, while an element of flexibility  is\r\n\r\nneeded  at  this  early  stage of  the  office  of  the  Elected\r\n\r\nPresidency.   The  Principles should first  be  tested  out  and\r\n\r\nrefined,  and then at some later stage, be incorporated  in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.  But I do believe that we should not stop  at  the\r\n\r\nConstitutional convention that we have now, but, at  some  later\r\n\r\nstage that these Principles should be enshrined in law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister and Dr Richard Hu clarified many of the\r\n\r\nother  queries which I had.  Dr Hu has stated that by accounting\r\n\r\nconvention,  net  investment  income  is  regarded  as   current\r\n\r\nreserves  and hence it is not described in the White  Paper.   I\r\n\r\nwas  initially going to argue that the President's staff  should\r\n\r\nbe  increased.   But the Prime Minister has clarified  yesterday\r\n\r\nthat  the President's Office should function much like the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's Office, which only has a few staff, and therefore the\r\n\r\nPresident and his staff have the right to query public  servants\r\n\r\nin   the   course   of  his  carrying  out  his   constitutional\r\n\r\nresponsibilities,  regardless  of  whether  it  is  safeguarding\r\n\r\nreserves,  safeguarding key public appointments, in  conjunction\r\n\r\nwith  Internal  Security Act or corruption  investigations.   If\r\n\r\nthis  is  indeed the case, then I think that it is not necessary\r\n\r\nto  increase the President's staff so long as they can  function\r\n\r\nmuch like that of the Prime Minister's Office.  I therefore hope\r\n\r\nthat  future Presidents and their staff will not experience  any\r\n\r\nmore unpleasant encounters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I agree that a harmonious working\r\n\r\nrelationship between the President and the Government is in  the\r\n\r\nbest  interest  of the country.  It is therefore in  support  of\r\n\r\nthis  objective that the White Paper was published and  hence  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  it  is a commendable move.  I fully  support  the\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rise in support of the motion in the name of Mr Shriniwas\r\n\r\nRai.  Although most of the issues have been clarified yesterday,\r\n\r\nI  wish to emphasise a number of points and implications in  the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I think the clarification yesterday has given a lot\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans a sense of clarity and a sense of comfort  over\r\n\r\nsome  of the issues that have disturbed some Singaporeans  prior\r\n\r\nto  this.

I\r\n\r\nthink  that is a good thing that has happened out of it. I  wish\r\n\r\nto  raise a number of points.  One is that I would like  to  see\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper as one of the more notable contributions of the\r\n\r\nElected Presidency.  Through his experience and clarifying  some\r\n\r\nof  his problems, I think we are now better able to clarify many\r\n\r\nof   the   technical  issues  related  to  the  Principles   for\r\n\r\ndetermining  and  safeguarding our  accumulated  reserves.   And\r\n\r\ntherefore  there  is  a  good outcome out  of  all  these.   The\r\n\r\ndifferences  on  this matter have brought about a  positive  and\r\n\r\nconcrete  outcome  in terms of the White Paper.   The  provision\r\n\r\ntherefore provides for a more effective channel of communication\r\n\r\nto  deal  with  the  matter.  While the clarification  had  been\r\n\r\nnecessary, it was no doubt uncomfortable and I think  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  today  can serve as a better platform for future  Elected\r\n\r\nPresidents and the Government to deal with many of the  problems\r\n\r\nthat can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe expected to evolve over time as we continue to strengthen the\r\n\r\ninstitution of both the Government and the Presidency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, as we now move towards instituting a new President,\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper  can  also  serve  to  facilitate  the  smooth\r\n\r\ntransition  of  office for the next Elected  Presidency.   Every\r\n\r\nElected President by sheer qualification will be a man of strong\r\n\r\ncharacter  and can be expected to exercise his own judgement  on\r\n\r\nthe  power  that is bestowed on him.  However, being an  elected\r\n\r\nprocess,  despite  the  stringent  qualification,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nguarantee  that  the new President will abide and  keep  to  the\r\n\r\nconventions  agreed  between  the Government  and  the  previous\r\n\r\nPresident.   We have seen how, in my view, completely unsuitable\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  made comical attempts to contest for  the  Elected\r\n\r\nPresidency.  Perhaps I would like to suggest that we find a  way\r\n\r\nto  get the new President to, amongst other things, as his first\r\n\r\nduty,  confirm  his  desire  to  abide  by  the  terms  of   the\r\n\r\nconvention; or perhaps at some future date, consider translating\r\n\r\nthe White Paper into a stronger legislative process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, I think we have had a very good outcome of\r\n\r\nall  these discussions.  And I hope one day we can look back and\r\n\r\nsay  that  one  of  the more solid contributions  of  the  first\r\n\r\nElected  Presidency has been the White Paper which  I  am  quite\r\n\r\nsure will in the long run strengthen not only the institution of\r\n\r\nElected Presidency but the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker,  Sir,  at  the  swearing-in  ceremony  on   1st\r\n\r\nSeptember  1993,  President Ong Teng Cheong gave  the  assurance\r\n\r\nthat  he  would do his best to unite the people of Singapore  to\r\n\r\njointly  build  up  a  prosperous,  gracious  and  compassionate\r\n\r\nsociety to make Singapore a wonderful country. He also vowed  to\r\n\r\ncarry out his duties fearlessly, selflessly and without bias  or\r\n\r\nprejudice,  to protect the interest of the people of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nto  reach  out  to fellow citizens from all walks  of  life,  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  their aspirations, and at the same time  maintain  a\r\n\r\ngood working relationship with the Prime Minister, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment,  so  as to create a rational system  of  checks  and\r\n\r\nbalances on the political system of Singapore, thereby enhancing\r\n\r\nthe political stability of Singapore and ensuring that Singapore\r\n\r\nhas a government of high standing that will continue to work for\r\n\r\nthe well-being of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past six years, President Ong encountered many\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  However, he lived up to the  expectation  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  and earnestly practised what he advocated to  undertake\r\n\r\nthe  heavy responsibilities and accomplish the very high  target\r\n\r\nthat he had set for himself.  This has enabled Singaporeans from\r\n\r\nall  stations  of  life to stay united amidst the  recent  Asian\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis  to  tide  over the  crisis  and  emerge  even\r\n\r\nstronger to march into the next century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the working experience and knowledge accumulated\r\n\r\nduring his term of office, President Ong also collaborated  with\r\n\r\nthe  Government in formulating the principles to  safeguard  our\r\n\r\nnational  reserves  in the form of a White Paper  which  is  the\r\n\r\nsubject  matter of our debate today.  As the Prime Minister  has\r\n\r\nsaid  yesterday, President Ong has proved that this \"second key\"\r\n\r\nsystem   of   safeguarding  our  national   reserves   and   key\r\n\r\nappointments in the civil service is indeed feasible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is even more commendable that President Ong has\r\n\r\nimpartially  and  selflessly  revealed  some  of  the   problems\r\n\r\nencountered  by him in the execution of his duties, just  before\r\n\r\nhe steps down, to enable the people to openly discuss the issues\r\n\r\nand  have a better understanding of the real object and  working\r\n\r\nof  our  Elected President system.  As Senior Minister Lee  said\r\n\r\nyesterday,  this debate is useful as part of the  education  for\r\n\r\nour  people.  More importantly, this will enable the  Government\r\n\r\nto  take stock of the views and reactions of the people on  this\r\n\r\nsystem after it has been in operation for six years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Ong has announced his decision not to seek re-election. This is indeed a great pity. However, we should\r\n\r\nrespect his decision.  We must record our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naffirmation and appreciation for the great contributions he  has\r\n\r\nmade  to the country and the people.  Therefore, I am very  glad\r\n\r\nto  learn that the Government will be giving a farewell party to\r\n\r\nPresident  Ong  on  30th  August to pay  tribute  to  the  great\r\n\r\ncontributions he has made to the country and the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, President Ong once said, \"Having a\r\n\r\ngood  government is far better than having a good  President  to\r\n\r\ncheck  on the bad government.\"  These sincere words and  earnest\r\n\r\nwishes truly bring out President Ong's love for the country  and\r\n\r\nthe  people, and his noble sentiments.  As a matter of fact, the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore can be said to be extremely lucky  to  have\r\n\r\nnot  only  a  good  Government, but also a  good  President.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  it is the common prayer of all the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nthat we continue to have a good Government and a good President.\r\n\r\nHowever, from the long-term point of view, this is not something\r\n\r\nto  be  taken  for granted.  Apart from the wise choice  of  the\r\n\r\nvoters,   we  must  also  endeavour  to  fine-tune  the  Elected\r\n\r\nPresident system through extensive practice and exploration,  so\r\n\r\nthat  this system will give full play to its fullest effect when\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the business community\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  let  me  take  this  opportunity  to  offer  our\r\n\r\nheartfelt congratulations to Mr Nathan who was returned  as  the\r\n\r\nsecond  Elected  President  of the Republic  of  Singapore  this\r\n\r\nafternoon.   I  firmly believe that he will be a  well-respected\r\n\r\nand popular President, like President Ong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Government instituted this office of an Elected\r\n\r\nPresident,  its  intention  must  surely  be  that  the  Elected\r\n\r\nPresident  would no longer be having just a ceremonial function.\r\n\r\nThe  President   has also the custodial power to  safeguard  our\r\n\r\nnational  reserves  and  maintain the  integrity  of  our  civil\r\n\r\nservice.   In  view of this, the responsibility of  the  Elected\r\n\r\nPresident  is  indeed very heavy and important.   Such  a  heavy\r\n\r\nresponsibility will be put to test only when our nation faces  a\r\n\r\nvery  serious internal or external crisis, or a severe  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrequires  the  Government to draw on the reserves,  or  when  an\r\n\r\nimportant  decision has to be made on some key  appointments  in\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service.   As such, we have to be prepared  for  the\r\n\r\nworse,  and fine-tune our Elected President system based on  the\r\n\r\nmost  fundamental interest of our country so that  we  would  be\r\n\r\nable to deal with any sudden crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, from the views expressed by the\r\n\r\nmedia  and the public, it is apparent that our people  are  very\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  our  present Elected  President  system.   Some\r\n\r\npeople  would  like  to  know  how  the  Government  views   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  encountered by President Ong in the  execution  of\r\n\r\nhis  duties, and whether the Government is determined to seek  a\r\n\r\nlong-tem solution to the problems, or to give the President more\r\n\r\nresources  to  exercise  the  powers  vested  in  him   by   the\r\n\r\nConstitution.  Is the Government happy with the way the election\r\n\r\nfor  the  first and the second Elected Presidents was conducted?\r\n\r\nWhat  is  the people's reaction to the nomination of the  second\r\n\r\nElected   President?   If,  in  future,   candidates   for   the\r\n\r\npresidential   elections  have  to  be  proposed  and   endorsed\r\n\r\ncontinuously  by  the Government before they can  be  considered\r\n\r\neligible to stand or worthy of support, then will this  not  run\r\n\r\ncontrary  to  the  original intention of the  Elected  President\r\n\r\nsystem?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, based on the working experience\r\n\r\nover  the past six years, President Ong and the Government  have\r\n\r\nentered into a convention and formulated a set of principles  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  the  national reserves and this is published  in  the\r\n\r\nform of a White Paper for the people of Singapore to read.  This\r\n\r\nis very encouraging.  However, because the Government originally\r\n\r\nhad no intention to move a motion in Parliament for the contents\r\n\r\nof   the  White  Paper  to  be  debated,  it  has  caused   some\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   to   be  skeptical  over  the   feasibility   and\r\n\r\nsustainability  of  these principles.  The people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwant to know in the event of an Elected President having to face\r\n\r\na  strong  but  free-spending and persistent government  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture, under the present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmechanism, can this set of principles be solely relied  upon  to\r\n\r\nstop the government from squandering away our reserves?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Prime Minister, the Senior Minister and the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister,  Dr  Richard Hu, had  already  given  a  very\r\n\r\ndetailed  explanation  on  the  problems  encountered   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  President  Ong  during  the  past  six   years.\r\n\r\nHowever, from the long-term point of view, it is apparent to  us\r\n\r\nthat  there are still a lot of  worrying and complicated  issues\r\n\r\nwhich  need  to  be resolved.  In view of this,  I  support  the\r\n\r\nmotion standing in the name of Nominated MP Mr Rai to give  this\r\n\r\nHouse the opportunity to further discuss the issues, and give  a\r\n\r\nclear explanation to the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I sincerely hope that through this\r\n\r\nround  of  frank  and  sincere discussion, and  with  the  joint\r\n\r\nefforts   and  mutual  cooperation  between  the  next   Elected\r\n\r\nPresident  and  the  Government, our  unique  Elected  President\r\n\r\nsystem  will make further progress, thereby laying a  solid  and\r\n\r\neffective foundation for our political development, and for  the\r\n\r\nlong-term benefit of our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, everything in this world is\r\n\r\ncontinuously  changing  and  developing.   Our  unique   Elected\r\n\r\nPresident system is no exception.  It is, after all, just a  six\r\n\r\nyear-old  little boy. It needs to be carefully looked after  and\r\n\r\nnurtured  by  his  parents.   He  also  needs  regular   medical\r\n\r\nexaminations, takes the medicine and receives medical  treatment\r\n\r\nwhenever he is sick.  Only then, can he grow up to be strong and\r\n\r\nhealthy.  Therefore, I suggest that the Government should  reach\r\n\r\nout to the people and collect feedback from the people on how to\r\n\r\nperfect  this Elected President system, and make this  a  \"World\r\n\r\nClass Political Project\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, if there is a need to amend the\r\n\r\nConstitution again to perfect this system, the Government should\r\n\r\ngo ahead and do it without any hesitation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nthe debate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  this  motion takes place amidst the context of  considerable\r\n\r\ncontroversy  and  the  incoming President.   There  are  factual\r\n\r\ndifferences  between  what  President  Ong  said  in  his  press\r\n\r\nconference and the Ministerial Statements given yesterday by the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister, Dr Richard Hu, and the Prime  Minister.   The\r\n\r\nOpposition have been quite opportunistic in seizing the comments\r\n\r\nby President Ong to their own advantage.  I myself find I cannot\r\n\r\ncomment  on  these  factual differences.  They  are  not  in  my\r\n\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish, in this sense, to avoid the question of\r\n\r\npersonalities.   At  most,  I think all  of  us  would  join  in\r\n\r\nthanking  President  Ong for the service he  has  given  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry  and to welcome the incoming President, Mr S  R  Nathan.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  would like to place my thanks to President Ong alongside\r\n\r\nthe  thanks  of  many, many Singaporeans and my well  wishes  to\r\n\r\nPresident-designate Mr S R Nathan among the well-wishers of many\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond this, I wish to focus on the Presidency as an\r\n\r\ninstitution because Presidents come and go, but for the  present\r\n\r\nand  future,  for our children, the principles set  out  in  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  before us and of the Constitution are  what  would\r\n\r\nendure.   There  has  been great debate in various  media  about\r\n\r\nwhether  this Presidency we now have is executive, or custodial.\r\n\r\nAnd  many other terms have been bandied about by me as  well  as\r\n\r\nother  people.   We  know for a fact that the President  is  now\r\n\r\nelected.   But  these other terms are not in  the  Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe  Constitution does not call it \"executive\", \"custodial\",  or\r\n\r\n\"largely   ceremonial\".   None  of  these  is   there   in   the\r\n\r\nConstitution.  These are words, analogies that different  people\r\n\r\nhave used differently to try to simplify for the public the very\r\n\r\ncomplex issues and laws in the Constitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go through some of these quite briefly in this\r\n\r\nHouse.   In classic constitutional theory, there is a separation\r\n\r\nbetween  only  three  arms of the state  -  the  Executive,  the\r\n\r\nLegislature  and the Judiciary.  In these three-fold  divisions,\r\n\r\nthe President is clearly part of the Executive.  He acts in this\r\n\r\nclassic model.  The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPresident,  while  being  the Head of  State  and  part  of  the\r\n\r\nExecutive,  does  not  hold powers or discretionary  initiative.\r\n\r\nThe  running of the Government is indeed with the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand  his  Cabinet once they have been appointed to  the  office.\r\n\r\nThe President or the monarch - in the case of England, it is the\r\n\r\nQueen  - reigns but does not rule.  It is almost all ceremonial.\r\n\r\nThis  is what Singapore used to have before the creation of  the\r\n\r\npresent presidential system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we now have? As I said, in our Constitution, if\r\n\r\nyou  look  at  it  carefully,  there  is  no  use  of  the  word\r\n\r\n\"custodial\", \"ceremonial\", or \"executive\".  On the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nthere is no term like \"executive President\".  The definition  of\r\n\r\nthe  words  \"Elected President\" is not even there.  It  is  just\r\n\r\nsimply  the  definition of the word \"President\",  which  is  the\r\n\r\nperson  elected  to  that office.  The main  provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nPresident  are found in Part V of the Constitution and  this  is\r\n\r\nthe  same  Part, under the title of the \"Government\",  where  we\r\n\r\nfind the provisions of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.  None\r\n\r\nof  these is to say therefore that the President is the Head  of\r\n\r\nGovernment or the CEO.  I tend to agree with the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nin  this sense.  All things done by Government are done  in  the\r\n\r\nname  of  the President, eg, in giving the Presidential Address.\r\n\r\nBut  it is clearly the agenda set by the Prime Minister and  his\r\n\r\nCabinet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Article 21(1) of the Constitution, it is clear that the\r\n\r\nPresident  acts  on the advice of the Cabinet.  But,  here,  the\r\n\r\nword  \"advice\"  is not simply a nice suggestion you  give  to  a\r\n\r\nfriend.   The  word  \"advice\" here is a  polite  way  of  saying\r\n\r\n\"instruction of the Cabinet\".  How then is the present system of\r\n\r\nthe  President different from the old form?  The President today\r\n\r\ndiffers  from  what we had before in that he  can  exercise  his\r\n\r\ndiscretion and make up his own mind on a limited set of matters.\r\n\r\nThese  matters are set out in Article 21(2).  There are  various\r\n\r\nshorthand ways of saying what these powers are.  Some people say\r\n\r\nthat  this  is the second key, custodial. Generally, people  say\r\n\r\nthe Elected President acts as a check on the use of reserves and\r\n\r\non key appointments. These short forms are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot sufficient to a full understanding of what the President can\r\n\r\nor cannot rightfully do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NMP, Mr Shriniwas Rai, earlier mentioned - correct me\r\n\r\nif  I  am  wrong - that the President can veto on  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Act  or  the Maintenance of Religious Harmony  orders.\r\n\r\nWell,  he  has a role in it.  But look carefully,  and  I  quote\r\n\r\nArticle  22(I)  that the President can only  act  on  orders  on\r\n\r\nreligious  harmony  if  first,  the  Presidential  Council   for\r\n\r\nReligious  Harmony  disagrees  with  the  Government.   If   the\r\n\r\nPresidential  Council agrees with the Government, the  President\r\n\r\ncannot veto.  This is what I mean that we are dealing with  very\r\n\r\ncomplex  issues which in the end we must try to simplify  to  be\r\n\r\nunderstood  by the people who elect the President.  These  short\r\n\r\nforms  are not exact.  They never would be.  But we can, through\r\n\r\nvarious  exercises such as this, try to educate our  people  and\r\n\r\nourselves in trying to understand these concepts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, when we say the President guards the reserves,\r\n\r\nit  is  clearly not all the reserves.  Those not accumulated  by\r\n\r\nthe  present Government are protected. Those accumulated by  the\r\n\r\npresent  Government can be used at their discretion and are  not\r\n\r\nsubject  to the Elected President's veto.  More importantly,  it\r\n\r\nmust  be seen that the President does not exercise this function\r\n\r\nabsolutely  or  alone.  There is  a  role  for  the  Council  of\r\n\r\nPresidential Advisers as well as other balancing institutions or\r\n\r\npillars  such as I have mentioned, the Presidential Council  for\r\n\r\nReligious  Harmony.   In  exercising discretionary  powers,  the\r\n\r\nPresident is not an absolute ruler.  He is independent but he is\r\n\r\nneither  wilful nor singular.  The President can  disagree  with\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister but there is no guarantee that the President\r\n\r\nwill always prevail in case of such a disagreement.  The role of\r\n\r\nthe Council of Presidential Advisers is critical.  It is said so\r\n\r\nin  Article  21(3) of the Constitution that the President  shall\r\n\r\nconsult the Council of Presidential Advisers, and he may  do  so\r\n\r\nin other circumstances set out in Article 21(4).  If the Council\r\n\r\nof Presidential Advisers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nagrees  with  him, the President can carry the  issue.   If  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  does  not  agree with the Elected President,  then  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister can override if two-thirds of Parliament supports\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister.  This is clearly seen in Article  22(2)  as\r\n\r\nregards certain appointments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's Parliament, I would dare say that if the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  wants the two-thirds majority, he would get it.   That\r\n\r\nis  the  standing  of the Prime Minister in today's  Parliament.\r\n\r\nBut this is not always vouchsafe for the future.  It is possible\r\n\r\nthat  the future Prime Minister would have a majority but not  a\r\n\r\ntwo-thirds  majority.  And so we must see that  the  President's\r\n\r\npowers  in  the Council of Presidential Advisers and  Parliament\r\n\r\nsit  in a very intricate balance that may well change over  time\r\n\r\naccording to certain numbers.  The President, in that sense, can\r\n\r\nwin  in  some  circumstances but the point  today  is  that  the\r\n\r\nPresident  can act, even without the concurrence of the  Council\r\n\r\nof  Presidential  Advisers.   He may  act  but,  ultimately,  be\r\n\r\ndefeated.   But in acting, he would raise issues, an alarm  bell\r\n\r\nwould  have been raised and a controversy would have begun.   It\r\n\r\nis  therefore a question of judgement and discretion on the part\r\n\r\nof the President whether to act alone and risk defeat or whether\r\n\r\nto  only  act when the Council of Presidential Advisers is  with\r\n\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a new and unique institution. The Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand  Elected  President Ong had, in their own ways,  pointed  to\r\n\r\nteething problems.  We have to accept this as part of the  price\r\n\r\nfor embarking on a bold constitutional adventure to create a new\r\n\r\nsystem  of  Government.  The  White  Paper  is  therefore   very\r\n\r\nimportant  in  this  context.  It seeks to  record  the  present\r\n\r\nPresident's  agreement on ways to smooth  over  these  problems.\r\n\r\nThe  Member of Parliament, Dr Tan Cheng Bock in 1988 in a debate\r\n\r\nin  this House on 12th August 1988 [Hansard, Vol. 53, Cols.  578\r\n\r\nto  579] put it correctly on the issues that the White Paper now\r\n\r\ntouches on.  Let me quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I shall now touch on financial assets and reserves. The\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"assets\" is indeed very wide and may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  practice  mean  every cent and every  square  centimetre  of\r\n\r\nGovernment land in Singapore.  Singaporeans want to know if this\r\n\r\nmeans  that  every parcel of land sale must be approved  by  the\r\n\r\nPresident.   Must  the sale of HDB properties have  his  assent?\r\n\r\nWill  the sale of every HDB unit or every block or every defined\r\n\r\nestate have his assent?  What about resale?.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have therefore to thank President Ong for trying with\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister to make some of these matters  clearer.   I\r\n\r\ndare  say if we had somehow managed to do the White Paper before\r\n\r\nPresident  Ong  came  to  office, half  the  controversies  that\r\n\r\nPresident  Ong alluded in this press conference would have  been\r\n\r\navoided.   Of course, this could not have been done.   But  now,\r\n\r\nhaving the White Paper, I think it helps the next President.  We\r\n\r\nare trying to clarify and we will come to a position of clarity.\r\n\r\nI think the White Paper also does a very good service in setting\r\n\r\nout   some   ideas  about  the  Net  Investment  Income   (NII).\r\n\r\nCommonsense  tells us that capital, the reserves and  return  on\r\n\r\ncapital are different.  Many businessmen will agree that NII can\r\n\r\nbe  used  by  the present Government.  The Finance Minister,  Dr\r\n\r\nRichard Hu, says that this might be defined to protect some part\r\n\r\nof  the  NII  in the next year.  Of course, this  can  be  done,\r\n\r\nperhaps  to take care of inflation or rise in replacement  costs\r\n\r\nof  certain assets.  But the essential principle is that the NII\r\n\r\nis part of income, return on investment and not past reserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I think that there is a point to say that the\r\n\r\nvaluation  of  assets should be at the point of  transaction  of\r\n\r\nsale  or  alienation rather than to try to sit down at  any  one\r\n\r\npoint  in time and take stock of everything in Singapore.   This\r\n\r\nis  not easy to do and actually it is not much sense in doing it\r\n\r\nbecause  the value of property changes according to use and  the\r\n\r\nrules  you allow a property to be used for.  It is sensible  and\r\n\r\nworkable therefore in what the White Paper recommends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while the White Paper is a step forward, it is not the\r\n\r\nonly  thing we need to do.  We need to make the system  work  in\r\n\r\npractice.  Yesterday in this House, the Prime Minister  told  us\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  no  need  for  parallel  government  under  the\r\n\r\nPresident's office.  I agree.  People want\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nless  government and less red tape, not more. They do  not  want\r\n\r\nanother  bureau,  another  bureaucracy.   But  people  do   want\r\n\r\ntransparency and accountability and they do see the President as\r\n\r\nan  important  additional element in ensuring  transparency  and\r\n\r\naccountability, in addition to the direct accountability of  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister and his Cabinet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitutional duty of the civil service set out in\r\n\r\nArticle  22F  is to reply to the request of information  by  the\r\n\r\nPresident.   This  should be reinforced in the  mindset  of  our\r\n\r\ncivil  servants in case it is ever forgotten.  It is not just  a\r\n\r\nnice  thing you should do because the President is a  nice  guy.\r\n\r\nIt  is part of the burden of their office and the obligation  to\r\n\r\ndefend  the Constitution. I would venture to say that while  the\r\n\r\ncivil service must observe their constitutional duties and while\r\n\r\nthere  is no need for a parallel government, there may  be  some\r\n\r\nneed   for  additional  staff  and  resources  for  the  Elected\r\n\r\nPresident.   Perhaps, this question should be left to  the  next\r\n\r\nPresident to decide within a reasonable mandate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me next turn to the nature of this White Paper. This\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  is not binding on either this House  or  the  next\r\n\r\nPresident.   This is despite the suggestion in paragraph  10  of\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper  itself that it should be so unless  the  next\r\n\r\nPresident  disagrees.  Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's  point  in\r\n\r\nParliament yesterday bears repeating.  What we say in this White\r\n\r\nPaper  or in Parliament are not of the same effect as the  words\r\n\r\nin  the  actual Constitution. Therefore, the White Paper  is  of\r\n\r\nlimited  use.   We  must understand this.  It  can  be  open  to\r\n\r\nquestions  by the next President or indeed it can be subject  to\r\n\r\njudicial interpretation under Article 100 of the Constitution if\r\n\r\nmatters should be brought to the tribunal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the system work, another point must be that the\r\n\r\nPresident  should be entrenched sometime in the next  term.   By\r\n\r\nthis, I mean that, as it stands presently, this House, under the\r\n\r\nleadership of the Prime Minister or another leader, could  amend\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution and limit the powers of the President  without\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPresident's  approval.   Only  if  it  is  entrenched  can   the\r\n\r\nPresident  be assured that his powers will not be nibbled  away.\r\n\r\nI  think this matter is not a light matter because once  we  are\r\n\r\ndoing that, we are locking ourselves into such a position.   But\r\n\r\nI  think it must be seriously looked at and considered over  the\r\n\r\nnext  term  of  the President and I am glad the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nindicated  yesterday  that  he  would  look  seriously  at  this\r\n\r\nquestion.  Only then can we have an assurance that the President\r\n\r\nis  an institution that is strongly established and accepted  by\r\n\r\nall.   This  White Paper and the other measures I have suggested\r\n\r\nare  necessary to make it work.  But perhaps they themselves are\r\n\r\nnot  sufficient.  Institutions are necessary but  never  enough.\r\n\r\nWe  do  need a President with moral courage.  I can do no better\r\n\r\non this part than to quote from then Deputy Prime Minister's Goh\r\n\r\nChok  Tong's speech in this House on 5th October 1990  [Hansard,\r\n\r\nVol. 53, Col. 560].  He said,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We are actually looking for people with competence. They\r\n\r\nmust  be  competent people before they can stand  for  election.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  they  must be trustworthy. Thirdly,  they  must  have\r\n\r\nsound judgement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They must have the moral courage because the President may\r\n\r\ncome  from  the  same  party as the Prime Minister.  But  if  he\r\n\r\ndisagrees  with  the Prime Minister on the use of  reserves  for\r\n\r\nwasteful  welfare  programmes, then the Elected  President  must\r\n\r\nhave the moral courage to tell the Prime Minister that he is not\r\n\r\ngoing to spend the reserves.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>We  do  need men of such moral courage to fill that office.   We\r\n\r\nalso  need a Prime Minister who is committed to making this very\r\n\r\nnew  and unique system work, as Prime Minister Goh has said that\r\n\r\nhe is committed to doing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elected President is supposed to check if we ever had,\r\n\r\nGod forbid, a so-called bad government or rogue government.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  it  need  not  be  a  rogue government.  There  can  be\r\n\r\nreasonable disagreements between reasonable people.   But  while\r\n\r\nwe  are  planning  for  a  scenario of  a  rogue  government  or\r\n\r\ndisagreement, it is ironic that to make the presidency  work  in\r\n\r\nthe  first  place,  it  must be put into  operation  by  a  good\r\n\r\ngovernment and by a good President. Only when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nboth  these two important officers are concerned with the future\r\n\r\nof  Singapore and the future of institutions will this  new  and\r\n\r\nunique  system be strongly embedded in the hearts and  minds  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and the way our system works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments, I will support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, Sir, first let me thank Mr Rai for  moving  the\r\n\r\nmotion  for  the House to endorse the principles for determining\r\n\r\nand  safeguarding the accumulated reserves of the Government and\r\n\r\nthe Fifth Schedule Statutory Boards and Government Companies  as\r\n\r\nset  out  in  the White Paper and also to the other Members  for\r\n\r\nspeaking in support of the principles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this motion has taken the debate in several\r\n\r\ndirections.  I have no wish to clarify or explain all the issues\r\n\r\nthat  have  been raised.  Many of the issues have been addressed\r\n\r\nyesterday.  I just want to make a few key points after listening\r\n\r\nto the debate so far.  First, because of the perceptions and the\r\n\r\nconfusion   through  the  use  of  the  terms  like   \"executive\r\n\r\nPresident\", etc, the Government decided to clarify the  role  of\r\n\r\nthe Elected President and his specific roles in the two areas  - protection  of past reserves and key civil service appointments.\r\n\r\nThis clarification, in my mind, is not intended to diminish  the\r\n\r\nrole  of the Elected President.  It is because of this confusion\r\n\r\nthat we thought it necessary to re-establish or to re-visit  the\r\n\r\nobjectives in setting up the elected President.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Simon Tay has gone through at great length the\r\n\r\nrole  of  the  President.  So I have  no wish to go through  the\r\n\r\nsame  ground.   But  just  to  highlight  to  Members  that   by\r\n\r\nintroducing  the elected President, we have made  a  very  major\r\n\r\nchange in the way future governments will run Singapore, whether\r\n\r\nfuture governments come from the PAP or come from the Opposition\r\n\r\nparties.   And  this change is that all future governments  will\r\n\r\nfind  that they have to run the government on a balanced budget,\r\n\r\nbecause at every stage of their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nterm  of  office,  they can only make use of  current  reserves.\r\n\r\nWithout  the  elected President mechanism, the government  could\r\n\r\nuse  past  reserves without it being clearly made known  to  the\r\n\r\npublic.   But  with  this mechanism now  in  place,  future  PAP\r\n\r\ngovernments or future  Opposition party government, if there  is\r\n\r\none,  will find it incumbent to run the government on a balanced\r\n\r\nbudget.   Any time any government wants to use the old reserves,\r\n\r\nthey  have to seek the President's agreement to unlock the  past\r\n\r\nreserves.   So this is a fairly significant change  to  the  way\r\n\r\nfuture governments should be run.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is a lot of talk about the need for good\r\n\r\nand  honest  government.  I endorse that entirely.  But  Members\r\n\r\nmay  not  realise that, in fact, the elected President mechanism\r\n\r\nis  also  important even if there is good and honest government.\r\n\r\nYou  do not need a bad and dishonest government to dig into  old\r\n\r\nreserves.   This  elected  President  mechanism  is  not   about\r\n\r\ncorruption.   It  is about using past reserves.   So  it  is  to\r\n\r\nprotect  ourselves  against a government  that  is  honest,  not\r\n\r\ncorrupt at all, but wants to spend old reserves for well-meaning\r\n\r\nand  even  well-supported policies.  With the elected  President\r\n\r\nmechanism  in  place, if such a government  wants  to  spend  on\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  however well-meaning, honest or  well-supported,  a\r\n\r\nred  flag will be flashed.  The President will have to come into\r\n\r\nplay.   The President has to agree that such a programme  is  in\r\n\r\nthe  interest  of  Singapore.  And as the  Senior  Minister  has\r\n\r\nexplained,  this is a hurdle so that Singaporeans  are  alerted.\r\n\r\nBecause we  are a small country with limited resources, we  have\r\n\r\ndecided to set aside past reserves.  And if we are now going  to\r\n\r\nspend  on  programmes using the past reserves,  let  that  be  a\r\n\r\ntransparent fact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of the elected President is not just to guard\r\n\r\nagainst  dishonest government.  In fact, it is equally effective\r\n\r\nagainst a good, well-meaning but profligate government.   So  we\r\n\r\ndo  not need to have a rogue or a bad government for the elected\r\n\r\nPresident to be effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the main benefit of these two days' discussion is\r\n\r\nthe  ability for us to clarify the role of the elected President\r\n\r\nand to better understand how this new mechanism that we have put\r\n\r\nin  place  would change the nature of future Budgets and  future\r\n\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the Government put the principles in a White Paper?\r\n\r\nAs  explained in the White Paper, the objective of  the  elected\r\n\r\nPresident  is  clear.  How to operationalise it is  a  lot  more\r\n\r\ncomplicated, because it is a complex issue.  We have  to  define\r\n\r\nmany terms.  We need to come to a common understanding, a common\r\n\r\nagreement  on  what these terms are and how to  interpret  them.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  White  Paper  is important  to  set  out  these\r\n\r\ndefinitions  and  to spell out the working arrangements  between\r\n\r\nthe  President  and  the Government, so that  both  parties  can\r\n\r\nfulfil their respective roles effectively and smoothly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr J B Jeyaretnam asked why not put out this White Paper at\r\n\r\nthe  beginning of Mr Ong's term and not at the end of his  term.\r\n\r\nAs  explained  in  the  White Paper, many  of  these  principles\r\n\r\nrequire  time for them to be operationalised, to be  documented,\r\n\r\nformalised and then institutionalised into the White Paper.   We\r\n\r\nwould  have liked to do it earlier, but it is in the  nature  of\r\n\r\nsuch complex issues that we can only complete it towards the end\r\n\r\nof  the  term.  And for this, I think we have to thank President\r\n\r\nOng for setting the pace and wanting to make sure that the White\r\n\r\nPaper is completed before the end of his term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper is a statement of how we would proceed with\r\n\r\nthe  administrative actions to implement the  objective  of  the\r\n\r\nelected  President.  So it is not an agreement between President\r\n\r\nOng and the Government, as Mr J B Jeyaretnam tried to argue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few Members asked about the role of the civil servants.\r\n\r\nI  can  only  reiterate what the Prime Minister said  yesterday.\r\n\r\nThe  civil  servants have a constitutional role to  support  and\r\n\r\nadvise  the President in his role in the two areas that  we  are\r\n\r\nconcerned about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low, Mr Chiam and Mr J B Jeyaretnam talked about\r\n\r\nclipping  the wings of the Government.  In the context  which  I\r\n\r\nexplained  just  now, the institution of the  elected  President\r\n\r\nwould  mean  that all future governments, whether PAP government\r\n\r\nor  an  Opposition  party government, would have  to  operate  a\r\n\r\nbalanced budget.  If they operate anything other than a balanced\r\n\r\nbudget,  they  have to go to the President to  unlock  the  past\r\n\r\nreserves.  And if that is not clipping the wings, I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhat  is.  It is a very major restraint on the way we run future\r\n\r\nBudgets and the way we run future governments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members asked about giving the President more\r\n\r\nresources.   Again, the Prime Minister has explained,  that  the\r\n\r\nPresident  can  call  upon the entire  resources  of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  in executing and implementing his role.  He is assisted\r\n\r\nby  his Principal Private Secretary (PPS) who is a civil servant\r\n\r\nin  the Administrative Service of Deputy Secretary Grade.  So he\r\n\r\nis  a  very senior Administrative Officer and can call upon  the\r\n\r\nentire  resources of the civil service.  It is the same way  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister operates through his PPS, the same way the Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  operates through his PPS as well as the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinisters operate through their PPSs.  So we do not see the need\r\n\r\nfor  additional staff for the President for him to implement his\r\n\r\nrole effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to how the White Paper would bind future\r\n\r\nPresidents  and future governments.  As indicated in  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper, these are principles which both the President, his  staff\r\n\r\nand the Government had worked together to establish, and we find\r\n\r\nit  effective  and  we  intend to make this  binding  on  future\r\n\r\nPresidents  and future Governments.  At the same time,  we  know\r\n\r\nthat  these  principles cannot be cast in  stone  and  therefore\r\n\r\nthere  must be a mechanism by which either party can be  allowed\r\n\r\nnot  to  follow  the  principles if they  think  these  are  not\r\n\r\napplicable.   But  there  is tremendous moral  pressure  in  the\r\n\r\nexample  that  Dr Lee Tsao Yuan raised.  If indeed a  government\r\n\r\ndoes not want to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreturn the money from a sale of land, using the argument that it\r\n\r\nwill  return the money at market value at the start of the  term\r\n\r\nand  not  at  the time of the sale, I think that is  clearly  in\r\n\r\nviolation  of  the preservation of the past reserves.   And  the\r\n\r\nPresident   will  be  well  within  his  power  to   veto   that\r\n\r\ntransaction,  because  that would  mean  a  draw  down  on  past\r\n\r\nreserves.  So I think both the principles as well as the  intent\r\n\r\nand spirit of the Constitution are quite clear.   That would  be\r\n\r\ndeemed as a draw down on past reserves, and the President  would\r\n\r\nindeed either veto the transaction or gazette and make it  known\r\n\r\nthat the Government has  drawn down past reserves, in which case\r\n\r\nthe  Government would be forced to replenish the  past  reserves\r\n\r\nfrom its current reserves.  So there is no ambiguity in that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just conclude by saying that we have worked hard to\r\n\r\nestablish the principles between the President's Office and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   We  believe  that  the  principles  set  out  very\r\n\r\neffectively the common understanding of how we will  proceed  to\r\n\r\nimplement  the  safeguarding of the  past  reserves.   It  is  a\r\n\r\ncomplex issue and we are glad that we are able to complete  this\r\n\r\nWhite Paper on time.  The White Paper can indeed be said to be a\r\n\r\nlegacy  of  President Ong and this White Paper will help  future\r\n\r\nPresidents in performing their constitutional functions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, can I have a clarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> What is your clarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> The Minister said that the principles in\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper are binding and that if a future government  so\r\n\r\ndecides  to  define fair market value as not  at  the  point  of\r\n\r\ntransaction  but at the time it took over office, then  that  is\r\n\r\nclearly in violation of the definition of past reserves.  But as\r\n\r\nfar  as  I remember in the White Paper, there is a provision  to\r\n\r\nsay  that so long as either party does not wish to agree to  the\r\n\r\nprinciples  of the White Paper, they can notify the other  party\r\n\r\nin  writing and therefore the principles of the White Paper  are\r\n\r\nnot binding on that particular\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngovernment.  Could I please ask for clarification of this point?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, the principles will be binding for\r\n\r\nfuture Presidents and future governments.  And there is, as  the\r\n\r\nMember  has  described it, an escape clause, that if either  the\r\n\r\nPresident  or  future government does not  want  to  follow  the\r\n\r\nprinciples,  they  are  allowed to say  that  it  is  no  longer\r\n\r\nbinding.   But  that does not deviate from the  requirement  and\r\n\r\nthe  spirit  of  the  Constitution, which is protection  of  our\r\n\r\nfinancial assets and protection of our land and buildings, which\r\n\r\nare  deemed  as  past reserves.  State land is  deemed  as  past\r\n\r\nreserves,  and  if  you sell State land at  anything  less  than\r\n\r\nmarket  value,  you are running down on past reserves,  and  the\r\n\r\nelected President will veto that transaction.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Another clarification, please. As far\r\n\r\nas  I  understand  from the White Paper, and I could be  obtuse,\r\n\r\nsupposing  you  have  a  future  government  that  informs   the\r\n\r\nPresident  of  the day that it disagrees with the definition  of\r\n\r\nthe value of State land, in other words, the value of State land\r\n\r\nat  fair  market value at the point of transaction,  then  those\r\n\r\nprinciples  no longer apply.  So it is not a question  of  using\r\n\r\npast reserves.  Here, it is a question of the definition of  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of State land, which is very clearly stated in the  White\r\n\r\nPaper.   Therefore,  unless  those principles  are  indeed  made\r\n\r\nbinding, then future governments can have the leeway to say that\r\n\r\nthey  do  not  agree with the valuation of State  land  at  fair\r\n\r\nmarket  value.  This is my understanding of the White Paper.   I\r\n\r\ncould be wrong.  If I am wrong, please clarify.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, the Member's understanding of the\r\n\r\nbinding  agreement is correct.  But whatever principles you  may\r\n\r\nnot  agree  with in the White Paper, the fact remains  that  the\r\n\r\nConstitution  says  that the President protects  past  reserves.\r\n\r\nAnd  what  constitutes past reserves?  They  are  net  financial\r\n\r\nassets  and  State  land and buildings.  And if  the  Government\r\n\r\nsays, \"No, that past reserve is defined as the value at the time\r\n\r\nof the change over of government,\" and the President says,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\"No,  it  must  be at the point of transaction.\", the  President\r\n\r\nwill  say,  \"This  is  my  view  supported  by  the  Council  of\r\n\r\nPresidential  Advisers.  I  will veto it.\"  The Government  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  either  challenge it, if it can.   It  will  be  under\r\n\r\nscrutiny by the public.  In that very simple example, the public\r\n\r\nwill  quite clearly be on the side of the President to say, \"You\r\n\r\nsell a piece of state land, it must be at the market value at at\r\n\r\nthe  point  of sale.\"  I do not think there is any confusion  to\r\n\r\nthe public who is right in that scenario that she painted.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Rai, can you reply?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I have got two clarifications for the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Why not you put them all in your reply?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> All right. I know Members are eager to\r\n\r\nend  this  debate soon and I will do so.  I would not take  much\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am grateful to the many Members who spoke, ie, those\r\n\r\nwho  have  supported the motion and even those who have  opposed\r\n\r\nthe motion, because they have added to this debate.  There is no\r\n\r\ndoubt, as my good friend, Mr Tay Beng Chuan said, that President\r\n\r\nOng  has  endeared and has done the Constitution and the country\r\n\r\nproud  by  the  way he has discharged his duties.   The  Elected\r\n\r\nPresident  is still in its infancy.  It will take some  time  to\r\n\r\nshape.  The Minister has been very assuring and I have no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat the Government intends to abide by the principles laid down\r\n\r\nin the Constitution and the White Paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two clarifications for the Minister. (1) Should the\r\n\r\nin-coming President ask for a staff, I hope the Government  will\r\n\r\nconsider  it favourably.  (2) Should there be a dispute  between\r\n\r\nthe   President  and  the  Government,  would  it  go   to   the\r\n\r\nConstitutional Court for a decision?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new President has won the admiration of my\r\n\r\ncolleagues, Dr Lee, Mr Tay Beng Chuan and others, and I think\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMembers  will  join  me in wishing him well.   He  has  a  heavy\r\n\r\nresponsibility in discharging his duties, but I  have  no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat  his  vast experience and the mandate he has received  from\r\n\r\nthe public will enable him to discharge his duties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he is an intellectual, he is a man of the ground.\r\n\r\nHe has friends from all walks of life.  I was surprised when his\r\n\r\nfruit seller came to the People's Association this afternoon  to\r\n\r\nwish him.  He was delighted and talked to him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give another example of the humility of the man.\r\n\r\nAfter  he  was returned unopposed at the Nomination  Centre,  he\r\n\r\nwent around thanking people.  An NTUC official came and told  me\r\n\r\nthat  he  has  moved away without meeting one  sector,  ie,  the\r\n\r\nIndian  activity  group from the PA.  When I whispered  this  to\r\n\r\nhim, he said, \"Yes, I am sorry, let us go.\"  That is the quality\r\n\r\nof  the  man.  He has finished his tour but he felt that he  has\r\n\r\nleft out one group and he must meet them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask Members to endorse the motion\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly.   I  would also ask the  Opposition  Members  to\r\n\r\nendorse the motion, even though they have filed an amendment  to\r\n\r\nthe  motion and spoke in favour of it.  This is not a  political\r\n\r\nissue.  It concerns the future of the country.  It concerns  how\r\n\r\nwe  are  going  to rule.  The Government has introduced  a  very\r\n\r\nunique\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconstitutional mechanism which has no parallel anywhere  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.   I think we owe it to ourselves to evolve the system  by\r\n\r\nassisting.   When  the  Prime  Minister,  Senior  Minister   and\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance spoke yesterday, I was  relieved  by  the\r\n\r\npicture that they have painted because there were some doubts in\r\n\r\nthe  minds of some members of the public.  This morning I had  a\r\n\r\nchance to speak to some people and they were relieved that  they\r\n\r\nhave  now been presented with the facts of the issue.   Whenever\r\n\r\nthere   is  any  difference  between  the  Government  and   the\r\n\r\nPresident, it is only fair that the public should know  it.   In\r\n\r\nthis way, we can talk and debate on it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge Members to vote for the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House endorses the Principles for Determining and\r\n\r\nSafeguarding the Accumulated Reserves of the Government and  the\r\n\r\nFifth Schedule Statutory Boards and Government Companies as  set\r\n\r\nout in the White Paper (Paper Cmd. 5 of 1999).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed. \" - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Twenty four minutes to Seven o'clock pm</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">to a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
