I  heartily  agree  with  him   that\r\n\r\neducation is just not book learning and the passing\r\n\r\nof   examinations.  There  are  other  aspects   of\r\n\r\neducation which have to be met by teachers, and  in\r\n\r\nthis  respect,  extra curricula activities  are  of\r\n\r\nimportance  which  the  Ministry  would   like   to\r\n\r\nencourage.  That  being so, the Ministry  has  been\r\n\r\nthinking for some time of including extra curricula\r\n\r\nactivities into the school curriculum, because with\r\n\r\nour  extremely  large  school  population  and  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  use  to which school buildings  are  being\r\n\r\nput - most  schools  are now on a two-session  basis,\r\n\r\nand certain schools are on a three-session basis to\r\n\r\naccommodate the adults at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnight -   it  would be very difficult for schools  to\r\n\r\nhave   extra  curricula  activities  outside  their\r\n\r\nschool  hours;  in other words, for pupils  in  the\r\n\r\nmorning  session  to return in  the  afternoon  for\r\n\r\ntheir  normal extra curricula activities, and  vice\r\n\r\nversa.  Unfortunately, we are not in a position  to\r\n\r\nimplement  this for this year since Government  has\r\n\r\ndecided  to  appoint this Commission of Inquiry  to\r\n\r\nreview   the  whole  of  the  educational   system,\r\n\r\nincluding the six-day week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin did stress that our schools\r\n\r\nshould  not be too examination-conscious. Whilst  I\r\n\r\nagree  with him in this respect, I must also  state\r\n\r\nthe  firm  view of the Government that it does  not\r\n\r\nfavour   the   automatic  promotion  system   which\r\n\r\nunfortunately  existed in the  English  stream  for\r\n\r\nquite a number of years and has had serious effects\r\n\r\nnot  only on pupils but also on teachers. With  the\r\n\r\nstoppage  of  automatic promotion for  the  English\r\n\r\nstream   in   1959,  there  has  been  a   distinct\r\n\r\nimprovement  in the quality of work not  only  from\r\n\r\nthe  pupils  but  also from the teachers.  This  is\r\n\r\nreflected  in the improvement in the percentage  of\r\n\r\npasses  for  the Primary School Leaving Examination\r\n\r\nfor the last two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now wish to deal with the remarks made by my\r\n\r\nformer  Parliamentary  Secretary,  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon Gardens, who is not in the House  at  the\r\n\r\npresent  moment.  But  he has  said  his  piece,  I\r\n\r\npresume, on behalf of the Barisan Sosialis which he\r\n\r\nrepresents today. I must say I am very grateful  to\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson for moving this motion instead\r\n\r\nof  withdrawing it, although he said last month  he\r\n\r\nwould,  to give me this opportunity first to listen\r\n\r\nto  my  former  Parliamentary  Secretary  who  says\r\n\r\ncertain things about the education policy, and  for\r\n\r\nme to reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has stated that he fully supports the\r\n\r\nCommission  of  Inquiry that is  to  be  formed  to\r\n\r\ninquire   into  the  educational  policy   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. But he does not agree that a Commission\r\n\r\nof   Inquiry  should  investigate  into   political\r\n\r\nactivities  in schools. I would like to remind  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Serangoon Gardens that there  are  two\r\n\r\nCommissions of Inquiry. The first one would be to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvestigate  into  the  examination  boycott  which\r\n\r\nwould  also  include  an  investigation  into   the\r\n\r\npolitical  activities and machinations  in  primary\r\n\r\nand  secondary  schools. This  Commission  will  be\r\n\r\nheaded by a High Court Judge, because we feel  that\r\n\r\nit  is  most essential that politics should be  got\r\n\r\nrid  of  in  our school system. In fact, my  former\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary must  have  had  a  mental\r\n\r\nblack-out   (after  he  changed  sides   from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  bench and walked across to be  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis)  to  hear  that  under  the\r\n\r\nEducation Ordinance, 1957, there are published  the\r\n\r\nSchool  Regulations,  1957.  At  page  18  of   the\r\n\r\nRegulations, Part XVIII, is a section  which  deals\r\n\r\nwith  political propaganda in schools. The marginal\r\n\r\nheading reads as follows: \"No political teaching or\r\n\r\nactivity  detrimental to the State  of  Singapore.\"\r\n\r\nRegulation 110 reads as follows - I shall  only  read\r\n\r\nparagraph  110; there are two sections.  \r\n\r\nThe  first section:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No instruction, education, entertainment,\r\n\r\nrecreation,  propaganda or  activity  of  any  kind\r\n\r\nwhich  shall be in any way of a political or partly\r\n\r\npolitical nature or detrimental to the interests of\r\n\r\nthe State of Singapore or of the pupils or contrary\r\n\r\nto the approved syllabus shall be permitted amongst\r\n\r\nthe  teachers  or  pupils either  upon  the  school\r\n\r\npremises  or  elsewhere upon the  occasion  of  any\r\n\r\nschool activity or combined schools activity.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Subsection (2) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The use or display by teachers or pupils either\r\n\r\nupon  the  school  premises or elsewhere  upon  the\r\n\r\noccasion of any school activity or combined schools\r\n\r\nactivity   or  salutes,  songs,  dances,   slogans,\r\n\r\nuniforms, flags or symbols which have a customarily\r\n\r\npolitical association shall be unlawful.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens stated that a\r\n\r\nCommission   of  Inquiry  should  look   into   the\r\n\r\neducational  policy  of  the  Government  which  he\r\n\r\ntermed  \"has many defects in its policy\".  This  is\r\n\r\ntypical  of the Barisan Sosialis type of allegation\r\n\r\nand  accusation. They do not mean that. Why did the\r\n\r\nMember for Serangoon Gardens not state exactly what\r\n\r\nare  the  defects, and what do the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nsay  should be done? In fact, Sir, it is the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Serangoon  Gardens, formerly my  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary,  who dissociated himself  from  all  the\r\n\r\ndecisions taken by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhim  for  the last two years until his  removal  as\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary on 21st July, 1961. Was  he\r\n\r\nnot supposed to be my adviser on Chinese education,\r\n\r\nand that I sought his views first before I made any\r\n\r\ndecision?  So  much so that I had to disappoint  my\r\n\r\nloyal colleagues, the Member for Bras Basah and the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tiong Bahru, when they had problems  on\r\n\r\nChinese  education.  I had to tell  them  first  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss with the Parliamentary Secretary who is now\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Serangoon Gardens. They  said  they\r\n\r\nwere  so  frustrated that it was no use talking  to\r\n\r\nhim;  nothing was done. That was why  they  had  to\r\n\r\ncome to me. I should therefore like the Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Gardens to name the number of  occasions\r\n\r\nwhen  I rejected his recommendations when they were\r\n\r\nsubmitted to me, and for what reasons. I notice the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Upper  Serangoon is all  smiles,  Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause   he   also  acted  as  the   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  the  Minister for Education  for  at\r\n\r\nleast  one  or  two  months  when  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Gardens  went  to  New  Zealand   on   a\r\n\r\nU.N.E.S.C.O. Seminar. When files continued to drift\r\n\r\ninto  the room of the Parliamentary Secretary,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Upper Serangoon came to  my  room  and\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Stop  sending all these files to  me.  Stop\r\n\r\nconsulting me. You should just decide and carry on.\r\n\r\nI  cannot stand the number of files that are coming\r\n\r\nto  me. You are the Minister. Get on with the job.\"\r\n\r\nSuch  are the types of ex-colleagues we have.  They\r\n\r\nwished  to  be consulted, and when we  did  consult\r\n\r\nthem,  they threw up their hands because there  was\r\n\r\ntoo much work to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I do ask the Member for Serangoon Gardens, if\r\n\r\nhe  must  criticise the educational policy  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  should  he   not  try  to  confine  his\r\n\r\ncriticisms to the educational policy, if any,  that\r\n\r\nappears  to  be  wrong to him  after  he  has  been\r\n\r\nexpelled from the P.A.P. Government? That is,  from\r\n\r\nJuly  1961  until now. Or would he? The Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Gardens wants me to produce  files  upon\r\n\r\nfiles  in  the Ministry of Education  to  show  his\r\n\r\nsignature and his initial indicating his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecisions on matters of Chinese education,  but  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  want to honour his own initial  and  his\r\n\r\nsignature. One evening he stated that in the matter\r\n\r\nof the 4:2 system for Chinese secondary schools, if\r\n\r\nonly  Government had postponed the holding  of  the\r\n\r\nSecondary  IV examination last year for  one  year,\r\n\r\nthere would have been no trouble. Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask  who  decided that the  1961  Secondary  IV\r\n\r\nexamination in Chinese schools should take place? I\r\n\r\nwill  not  bore the House except to make references\r\n\r\nto  certain files - Education File No. 1134/60, folio\r\n\r\n36,   - in  which the minutes of the meeting  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Senior  Middle III  Examination  Board,\r\n\r\n1960, dated 18th November, 1960, were submitted  to\r\n\r\nme  on  23rd  November.  1960.  My  minute  to  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary,  now  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nSerangoon Gardens, was a short one: \"O.K.?\" I got a\r\n\r\nreply after one week. It takes a very long time for\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Serangoon Gardens to come  to  .any\r\n\r\ndecision. In fact, Sir, after his removal,  sad  to\r\n\r\nsay,  documents, letters, appeals, which  I  passed\r\n\r\ndown  to  him to attend and to \"please  deal  with\"\r\n\r\nwere  found stacked in the drawers, chockful, until\r\n\r\nmy new Parliamentary Secretary turned up -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang):</b> Ha, ha!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> What is there to\r\n\r\nlaugh about?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> There were silver-fish and\r\n\r\ncockroaches  inside the drawers and he  wants  this\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> Inquiry first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Certainly.

Therefore,\r\n\r\nSir, if in 1960 it was decided to proceed with  the\r\n\r\nfirst  Government  Secondary IV examination  to  be\r\n\r\nheld  in  1961, it was on the advice of  my  former\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary, the Member for  Serangoon\r\n\r\nGardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be very interesting to know that\r\n\r\nwith  this  controversy between  the  3:3  and  4:2\r\n\r\nsystems,  at  one  stage  the  Chinese  educational\r\n\r\nbodies  were  upset that schools  could  not  issue\r\n\r\ntheir  school  certificates after  an  examination.\r\n\r\nHere again, Sir, who decided that the schools could\r\n\r\nnot  issue  their school certificates in accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the usual practice? I refer to Education file\r\n\r\n1299/61,   folio  (3)  in  which  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Gardens,  as my Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\nthen,  on the 5th July. 1961, gave approval to  the\r\n\r\nissue  of this circular which reads as follows.  It\r\n\r\nwas dated 11th July, 1961. The circular is numbered\r\n\r\nEducation 1299/61/39:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Issue of certificates to pupils of Secondary IV\r\n\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the practice of Chinese Middle Schools to\r\n\r\nissue  their own Senior Middle III Certificates  to\r\n\r\npupils  who completed their Senior Middle III.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry has decided that this practice should  not\r\n\r\nbe  extended  to pupils who sit for the forthcoming\r\n\r\nSchool  Certificate Chinese examination. Principals\r\n\r\nare,  therefore, requested not to issue  their  own\r\n\r\nschool certificates to such pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. This ruling does not apply to the school\r\n\r\nleaving  certificate issued by the  school  when  a\r\n\r\npupil leaves a school at any standard.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mind you, Sir, this decision was taken in spite  of\r\n\r\na warning by an official dated 4th July that it was\r\n\r\nexpected that a section of the public would clamour\r\n\r\nfor  the retention of the traditional practice  for\r\n\r\nschools  to  issue  their own school  certificates.\r\n\r\nThat was my adviser on Chinese education! He took a\r\n\r\ndecision  and now he would like to make  it  appear\r\n\r\nthat  he  was  not  consulted,  nor  does  he  know\r\n\r\nanything about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the points which he considered the\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry should look into.  They  were\r\n\r\nfive  in  number.  The  first  one  was  this.  Did\r\n\r\nGovernment  assist aided schools to  expand,  since\r\n\r\nthere were so few Chinese aided schools but so many\r\n\r\nEnglish Government schools? The answer is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery  simple,  Sir.  Assuming  that  we  have  done\r\n\r\nnothing,  it  can be asked, in whose  hands  did  I\r\n\r\nleave the question of looking into the question  of\r\n\r\nthe  granting of capital aid to schools, which  are\r\n\r\nmainly  Chinese? Whose recommendation was I waiting\r\n\r\nfor,   if   it  was  not  my  former  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary,   the  present  Member   for   Serangoon\r\n\r\nGardens, who sits on files like a hen squatting  on\r\n\r\neggs to hatch?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he referred to the retirement of teachers in\r\n\r\naided  schools whom he said Government has no  plan\r\n\r\nto assist. He said that when they retire they would\r\n\r\nbe  jobless  and  unemployed. Sir,  there  is  this\r\n\r\ndistinction about teachers being employed in  aided\r\n\r\nschools   and   teachers  employed  in   Government\r\n\r\nservice.  Whereas a teacher wishing to be  employed\r\n\r\nin  an  aided  school could approach an  individual\r\n\r\nschool to see the Principal and get the approval of\r\n\r\nthe   Committee   of  Management   prior   to   his\r\n\r\nappointment, particulars of which, of course, would\r\n\r\nhave  to  be forwarded to the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nfor  approval,  in  the case  of  employment  in  a\r\n\r\nGovernment   school,  there  would   be   an   open\r\n\r\nadvertisement,  and  should  there  be  a   hundred\r\n\r\nvacancies, it is likely that at least 500 or  1,000\r\n\r\nwould  apply  for such vacancies.  There  would  be\r\n\r\nstrict  selection by a Selection Board  deputed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Public Service Commission, and the best people\r\n\r\nwould  be  selected for service. But the prize  for\r\n\r\nbeing  selected  to Government service  would  mean\r\n\r\nthat a teacher in Government service is liable  for\r\n\r\ntransfer  anywhere  within  the  State,  whereas  a\r\n\r\nteacher in an aided school remains more or less  in\r\n\r\nthat  school for a long time. There are  advantages\r\n\r\nand disadvantages, whether one happens to serve  in\r\n\r\nan  aided school or a Government school. It is  not\r\n\r\nvery  easy  to  equate the terms and conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice.  Whereas  the  Government  servant  would,\r\n\r\nafter  a long period of service, be entitled either\r\n\r\nto  a part gratuity and pension; in the case of  an\r\n\r\naided  school teacher, there would be his share  of\r\n\r\nthe  Provident  Fund; so either a  teacher  gets  a\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund or he is entitled to a pension.  It\r\n\r\nis up to him to make up his mind what he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  have  in his old  age.  He  cannot\r\n\r\npossibly  have both. If, therefore, teachers  would\r\n\r\nlike to look forward to a pension, they should then\r\n\r\napply  for a post in the Government service.  There\r\n\r\nis, of course, this further advantage of serving in\r\n\r\naided schools, as we have examples here, Sir.  They\r\n\r\nare  able  to take part in politics and  elections,\r\n\r\nget returned and become hon. Assemblymen; whereas a\r\n\r\ncivil servant would not be entitled to take part in\r\n\r\nactive  politics. However, the Government is  fully\r\n\r\naware  that Chinese aided schools did not get  full\r\n\r\naid till 1957. The Central Provident Fund, I think,\r\n\r\ncame  into  existence only in 1957, that is,  about\r\n\r\ntwo  years  before the new Government took  office.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  knowing  full well  that  many  Chinese\r\n\r\nteachers  in aided schools would not have a  proper\r\n\r\nnest  egg for retirement, the Ministry took a  very\r\n\r\nlenient view when the subject of the retirement  of\r\n\r\nteachers  came  up  for consideration.  The  normal\r\n\r\nretiring  age is 55 and the Government has actually\r\n\r\nagreed  that  not  only civil  servants,  but  also\r\n\r\nteachers  in aided schools could continue to  serve\r\n\r\nup  till  60,  provided, of  course,  the  teachers\r\n\r\nconcerned  are medically fit and also  serve  their\r\n\r\npurpose  in  schools; that they have a satisfactory\r\n\r\nrecord of teaching, and could be of service to  the\r\n\r\ncountry;  and even then, Sir, we were  prepared  to\r\n\r\nlook  into individual cases of Chinese teachers  in\r\n\r\naided  schools who were over 60, if they felt  that\r\n\r\nthey could still carry on and were given permission\r\n\r\nto  have their service extended year after year.  I\r\n\r\nhanded over to the Member for Serangoon Gardens, as\r\n\r\nmy  Parliamentary Secretary, the responsibility  to\r\n\r\nlook  into  individual cases, make  recommendations\r\n\r\nand  to allow for extensions. But I hear that there\r\n\r\nis  an  impression outside that many aged  teachers\r\n\r\nwho  wished  to  continue in  service  were  rather\r\n\r\nroughly treated by my ex-Parliamentary Secretary. I\r\n\r\nam  afraid  I  cannot be responsible  for  his  bad\r\n\r\nmanners, but that was the impression I got after he\r\n\r\nstopped  being my Parliamentary Secretary  in  July\r\n\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then touched upon the subject of the bleak\r\n\r\nfuture for students in our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschools  and  mentioned the fact that  many  Senior\r\n\r\nMiddle  III  and Secondary IV graduates of  Chinese\r\n\r\nsecondary schools are unemployed. Sir, this is  not\r\n\r\ntypical  of Chinese schools. The unfortunate  thing\r\n\r\nabout  the Member for Serangoon Gardens is that  he\r\n\r\nis  only able to look from one angle. He is unable,\r\n\r\ndespite the two years he was under my tutelage,  to\r\n\r\nsee  education  as a whole. We have  four  language\r\n\r\nstreams.  In  his  position, he  should  have  been\r\n\r\ntrained  to  look  at education in  more  than  one\r\n\r\nstream. Therefore, I would say that the problem  of\r\n\r\nunemployment  in  the ranks of those  who  graduate\r\n\r\nfrom  our  secondary schools, be  they  Chinese  or\r\n\r\nEnglish, and in the near future from the Malay  and\r\n\r\nTamil streams, is a fact which this Government  was\r\n\r\nfully aware of before it came into office. That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  we have tried to produce our development plan;\r\n\r\nit  was  originally meant to be  five  years,  but\r\n\r\nbecause  by the time it was published one year  was\r\n\r\nalready  over, it became a Four-Year Plan  - 1961  to\r\n\r\n1964.   We   were  fully  aware  of  the  unhealthy\r\n\r\nunemployment position which would be aggravated  by\r\n\r\nthe  thousands  that would be leaving  our  schools\r\n\r\nseeking   employment.   There   is   a   need   for\r\n\r\nindustrialisation and a need for the conversion  of\r\n\r\nthe educational system which we have inherited from\r\n\r\nthe  past, in order to bring about greater emphasis\r\n\r\nand  stress  on vocational and technical  education\r\n\r\nand  not academic education as we have known for  a\r\n\r\nlong, long time. Therefore, before embarking  on  a\r\n\r\nlarge  programme of very expensive  vocational  and\r\n\r\ntechnical  education,  we  decided  to  set  up   a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry into Vocational and Technical\r\n\r\nEducation. This Commission's Report was  tabled  in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly two months ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens then went on to\r\n\r\nmake  a  false  statement that  many  Secondary  IV\r\n\r\nstudents  are  not  able to  join  Upper  Secondary\r\n\r\nclasses. Now, entry to the Upper Secondary  classes\r\n\r\nin  the  Chinese medium which started this year  is\r\n\r\nthrough    passing   the   Secondary   School    IV\r\n\r\nExamination. Of 2,348 pupils who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npassed  the  Secondary School IV  Examination  last\r\n\r\nyear,  2,080  or  88  per  cent - close  to  90   per\r\n\r\ncent - have been admitted to Upper Secondary  classes\r\n\r\nas at 13th of January this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member next alleged that the Ministry has not\r\n\r\nrecruited   any  temporary  teachers  pending   the\r\n\r\npublishing of the results of the Senior Middle  III\r\n\r\nExamination  and the Secondary 1V Examination  next\r\n\r\nmonth. This again is not true. We are employing and\r\n\r\nwill  employ those who have taken either the Senior\r\n\r\nCambridge Examination, 1961, for the English stream\r\n\r\nand  those  who  have taken the  Government  Senior\r\n\r\nMiddle III Examination and the Government Secondary\r\n\r\n1V  Examination in the Chinese medium last month as\r\n\r\ntemporary  teachers  for our  schools.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nthere  has been a first recruitment of teachers  as\r\n\r\ntemporary   teachers.  There  will  be   a   second\r\n\r\nrecruitment  based  on  the  fact  that  the  first\r\n\r\nrecruitment was on the basis that teacher  trainees\r\n\r\nwere  regarded as one unit for purposes of staffing\r\n\r\nin  the  schools,  and  it has  been  decided  that\r\n\r\nteacher  trainees  may have more free  periods  and\r\n\r\ncould be regarded as .92 unit for 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point which the Member for Serangoon\r\n\r\nGardens made and which he said should be put before\r\n\r\nthe  Commission of Inquiry was the question of  the\r\n\r\nrecognition of Nanyang University degrees. From the\r\n\r\nanswer  given by the Government to questions  posed\r\n\r\nby  the  Chinese Chamber of Commerce at  the  forum\r\n\r\ndebate at the Victoria Theatre on 13th January,  he\r\n\r\nsaid  he understood it to mean that the Government,\r\n\r\nafter  merger,  would seek recognition  of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity degrees, but that they should proceed to\r\n\r\nrecognise this now. It would, I think, be  fair  if\r\n\r\nthe  full questions and answers were stated in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly. It is very dangerous just picking out one\r\n\r\nline  and then asking questions on that one  line.\r\n\r\nIt  should  be  in the context of the question  and\r\n\r\nanswer. It is not very long, Sir. If you will allow\r\n\r\nme,  this  is  question No. 15. The question  posed\r\n\r\nwas:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"After merger, will the academic qualifications of\r\n\r\nMiddle  School graduates and University  graduates,\r\n\r\nincluding those of Nanyang\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversity, be recognised by the Central Government\r\n\r\nof  the new Federation; and will such graduates  be\r\n\r\nallowed to teach or enter Government service in any\r\n\r\npart of the Federation?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official text of the answer is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The question of academic qualifications of Middle\r\n\r\nSchool and University graduates, including those of\r\n\r\nNanyang University, being recognised by the Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  of the new Federation is a  matter  for\r\n\r\nthe Central Government of the new Federation. Alter\r\n\r\nmerger,  the  Singapore  Government  will  put  the\r\n\r\nmerits  of  the  case  for recognition  before  the\r\n\r\nCentral Government. However, after merger and  with\r\n\r\nautonomy  in  education,  Nanyang  graduates   will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be  recruited  for  service  in   the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Government  and   in   schools.   Since\r\n\r\nSingapore  would enjoy autonomy in education  after\r\n\r\nmerger,  the  Singapore Government would  naturally\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  recruit Nanyang University  graduates\r\n\r\ninto  Government  service, including  the  teaching\r\n\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it necessary to expand on that\r\n\r\nquestion  and  answer. Suffice it to say  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore    Government   has   given   conditional\r\n\r\nrecognition to Nanyang University degrees, a  stand\r\n\r\nthe Government took two years ago when the Gwee  Ah\r\n\r\nLeng  Review Committee Report on Nanyang University\r\n\r\nwas  tabled in this House, and I had then  occasion\r\n\r\nto   state  the  Singapore  Government's  stand  on\r\n\r\nNanyang University. I refer, Sir, to Hansard,  Vol.\r\n\r\n12,  No.  3, col. 143. I will just read one  and  a\r\n\r\nhalf paragraphs:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`From the Review Committee's Report, it appears\r\n\r\nthat  the curriculum of Nanyang University shows  a\r\n\r\nlack   of   systematic  planning  and  proper   co-ordination,  and  individual  guidance  from  staff\r\n\r\nmembers appears to be lacking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then is the Singapore Government's stand on\r\n\r\nNanyang University in view of the findings  of  the\r\n\r\nGwee Ah Leng Review Committee? Despite the critical\r\n\r\nfindings   contained  in  the  Review   Committee's\r\n\r\nReport,  the  Singapore Government has  decided  to\r\n\r\nemploy   Nanyang   University  graduates   and   to\r\n\r\nrecognise   the  Nanyang  University  degrees   as\r\n\r\nequivalent   to  Pass  Degrees  of   a   recognised\r\n\r\nuniversity.  Selection  will,  as  usual,   be   on\r\n\r\nindividual  merits through interview by the  Public\r\n\r\nService Commission.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is  the  stand  of  the Singapore  Government\r\n\r\npending the reorganisation of Nanyang University in\r\n\r\naccordance  with the main principles of the  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee's Report. This stand on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNanyang  University was a stand in which  at  least\r\n\r\nfour  Members of the Barisan Sosialis who were then\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretaries were consulted before the\r\n\r\nstatement   was   made.  They   included   my   ex-Parliamentary   Secretary,  now  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Gardens, the Member for Upper Serangoon,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Havelock and the Member  for  Nee\r\n\r\nSoon. They were then Parliamentary Secretaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Sir, the Member for Nee Soon said more\r\n\r\nthan once that by giving Nanyang University parity\r\n\r\nof  treatment with that of the University of Malaya\r\n\r\nI would become a hero of Chinese education. At that\r\n\r\ntime,   the  Member  for  Queenstown  was   not   a\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary in the P.A.P.  Government;\r\n\r\nhe was then an Assemblyman. We took the Assemblymen\r\n\r\ninto   confidence  before  the   release   of   the\r\n\r\nstatement, but he objected, as usual, that  he  was\r\n\r\nnot  being consulted. Everything was cut and  tried\r\n\r\nand there was no use of making any contribution.  I\r\n\r\nremember he was very agitated. The attitude of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis is just like that of  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown. If he is consulted, then it is all\r\n\r\nright - consultation has taken place with the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  But  if he is not  consulted,  then\r\n\r\nthere has been no consultation in anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, two Members of the Barisan Sosialis,\r\n\r\nthen   Parliamentary  Secretaries  in  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment,  were  members of  the  very  important\r\n\r\nLiaison  Committee which was established, composing\r\n\r\nof   Government  members  and  members  of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity,   namely,  the  Member  for   Serangoon\r\n\r\nGardens  and  the Member for Upper Serangoon.  They\r\n\r\nhad  all  the  chance in the world  to  make  their\r\n\r\ncontributions to bring about a settlement with Nanyang University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, this is classic of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis:  Is  the Government going  to  reorganise\r\n\r\nChinese schools according to the English schools as\r\n\r\na  model?  In other words, will Chinese schools  be\r\n\r\nanglicized;  will they follow the English  pattern;\r\n\r\nwill  they follow the colonial pattern? Sir,  every\r\n\r\ncountry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas   to  evolve  its  own  education  system,  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  is no different. We intend to  take  the\r\n\r\nbest  of what is available in the four streams.  In\r\n\r\nprewar  days, the Government only conducted  Junior\r\n\r\nMiddle III Examinations for the Chinese schools and\r\n\r\nit  was only in 1951 that they conducted the Senior\r\n\r\nMiddle III Examinations. After a six-year secondary\r\n\r\neducation, the certificate was only made equivalent\r\n\r\nto  the Cambridge School Certificate which could be\r\n\r\ntaken  after four years in the English stream.  But\r\n\r\nwhatever  it  is, outside of Singapore,  the  lower\r\n\r\nsecondary  education system is five years  starting\r\n\r\nwith Form I to Form V for the English stream before\r\n\r\nthey   were   ready   for  the   Cambridge   School\r\n\r\nCertificate Examination. In Singapore, it is  quite\r\n\r\nsome time now since children in English schools are\r\n\r\nable  to  take  the Cambridge Examination  in  four\r\n\r\nyears  and not five years. So Singapore is somewhat\r\n\r\nunique   in  that  pupils  are  able  to  take   an\r\n\r\nexamination in four years, whereas in the  rest  of\r\n\r\nthe  world, including the United Kingdom, they have\r\n\r\nto do it in five years. But, of course, if I do not\r\n\r\nmention  the Upper Secondary education, the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   will  say,  \"There  you  are,  secondary\r\n\r\neducation only in four years.\" We have two years of\r\n\r\nthe  Higher School Certificate and it is just  nice\r\n\r\nfor  us  having  to  integrate  the  four  language\r\n\r\nstreams to bring about secondary education  in  two\r\n\r\nparts: four years for the first part and two  years\r\n\r\nfor  the higher upper secondary section so that you\r\n\r\ndo  six  years  before you go to a University.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  times have changed, Sir,In the  good  old\r\n\r\ndays,   in   fact,   after  the  Senior   Cambridge\r\n\r\nExamination   - after nine years  of  education:  six\r\n\r\nyears  in primary and three in secondary (Standards\r\n\r\nI  to  IX)   - it  was possible to do  the  Cambridge\r\n\r\nExamination and walk into a University.  Six  years\r\n\r\nprimary  and three years secondary, and we  are  at\r\n\r\nuniversity  level. But standards have  been  raised\r\n\r\nhere  as anywhere else in the world, and it is  now\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  have  a 12-year education - six  years\r\n\r\nprimary and six\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears secondary - before one is considered reasonably\r\n\r\nmature  and adult t& join a University. So  that  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  dangerous talk indulged  in  by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis,  and more  so  I  am  unable  to\r\n\r\nforgive  my  former  Parliamentary  Secretary   for\r\n\r\ntalking  in  this  strain: Is Government  going  to\r\n\r\nanglicize the Chinese schools and so on?  At  least\r\n\r\nif  he  could have made a suggestion on what  other\r\n\r\nmodel he has to put forward for consideration, that\r\n\r\nwould   have  at  least  been  constructive.   \"The\r\n\r\nSingapore  educational system should  be  this  and\r\n\r\nthat,\" but there is nothing to offer as a solution.\r\n\r\nHere,  Sir,  having raised this question  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment may want to anglicize Chinese schools on\r\n\r\nthe  pattern  of  English schools in  Singapore,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to refer to one of the files  again - No.\r\n\r\n1299/61.  There is a document here 28  (C)  by  the\r\n\r\nAssistant  Director of Education (Chinese)  to  the\r\n\r\nChief   Examinations  Officer   - School  Certificate\r\n\r\nChinese Examination:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Parliamentary Secretary [that is, the Member for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Gardens]  has agreed  to  amendments  to\r\n\r\nRegulations  governing  the  award  of  the  School\r\n\r\nCertificate  (Chinese) [that is, the  Secondary  IV\r\n\r\nExamination) so as to bring them in line  with  the\r\n\r\nCambridge  [they  do  not like  to  hear  the  word\r\n\r\n\"Cambridge\" because it is English and therefore  it\r\n\r\nis colonial] School Certificate standard.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Therefore, if the Barisan Sosialis have some  model\r\n\r\nor  some  pattern to suggest to the  Government,  I\r\n\r\nwould like them to say so. What pattern is it  that\r\n\r\nthey would like the Singapore educational system to\r\n\r\nfollow?  And  not  just hide  behind  a  facade  of\r\n\r\npretence and a silly allegation that the Government\r\n\r\nintends to do certain things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore deeply indebted to the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson   for  having  proceeded  with  this  motion,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  gave me the opportunity to  listen  to\r\n\r\nwhat  was  said by my former colleague - I think  the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park has congratulated me  on  my\r\n\r\nloss,  which  is no loss but a gain - and  to  answer\r\n\r\npoint by point his allegations which are unfounded,\r\n\r\nmalicious and dangerous, and for which he  and  his\r\n\r\nown Party must bear full responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.28 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, having listened to the\r\n\r\nspeech  by the Minister for Education, I  have  the\r\n\r\nimpression  that  the  P.A.P.  Government  is  very\r\n\r\nsatisfied with the present state of affairs in  the\r\n\r\nEnglish and Chinese schools in Singapore. According\r\n\r\nto   his  speech,  the  people  can  come  to  this\r\n\r\nconclusion.  If  there  are  any  problems  in  the\r\n\r\nschools  in  Singapore, if the  teachers  have  any\r\n\r\ncomplaints  and  if  there is any  complaint  about\r\n\r\nNanyang  University, they said that these  are  all\r\n\r\ncreated  by the Barisan Sosialis. The Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation put the blame for the mistakes and errors\r\n\r\nin   the   Ministry  of  Education   on   his   ex-Parliamentary Secretary. Just now, the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation  gave  many examples. He said  all  these\r\n\r\nwere   done  on  the  recommendation  of  the   ex-Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation. From this, if it is so, then the  people\r\n\r\ncan  see  our Minister in the past two and  a  half\r\n\r\nyears has been useless. I feel that if it is so, he\r\n\r\nshould  refund  the  salaries  which  he  has  been\r\n\r\ndrawing  for the past two and a half years  to  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, later on I shall reply to the\r\n\r\ncriticisms   made  by  the  Minister   against   my\r\n\r\ncolleagues.  Let me now express my  views  on  this\r\n\r\noriginal  motion.  Mr Speaker, I  feel  that  this\r\n\r\nmotion  is  a very constructive one. The Government\r\n\r\nshould   not  treat  it  as  one  with  which   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  want to attack the Government,  because\r\n\r\ntoday   there  are  many  things  on   policy   and\r\n\r\nadministration  which should be reviewed  since  we\r\n\r\nall know that the P.A.P. when they came into office\r\n\r\nafter  the general elections in 1959 did  not  have\r\n\r\nany  long-term plan. It was a result of  historical\r\n\r\ndevelopments that they came to form the Government.\r\n\r\nUnder  these circumstances, on complicated problems\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  education problem,  any  responsible\r\n\r\nParty will not boast that it has all the experience\r\n\r\nto  deal  with them. To the P.A.P., when  they  are\r\n\r\nconfronted with this education problem, it is a new\r\n\r\nexperience to them when they try\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto solve it. They should admit that when performing\r\n\r\nthis   important  task,  there  are  bound  to   be\r\n\r\nmistakes. Apart from this, in the matter of policy,\r\n\r\nthey  have  not  seen eye to eye with  the  people.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  today one Member in this  Assembly  has\r\n\r\nmoved  this  motion  to  set  up  a  Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry. This is a very good suggestion. The P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  remember this  motion  and  the\r\n\r\nresult  of  this Commission will not  only  benefit\r\n\r\nthose who support it. It is the teachers and pupils\r\n\r\nin  the  schools who will derive benefit  from  the\r\n\r\nresult of the Commission of Inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me explain why there should be such a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry. At the same time,  what  are\r\n\r\nthe  terms  of  reference  of  this  Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry?  First  of all, let me briefly  cite  some\r\n\r\nexamples.  For instance, in the matter of  building\r\n\r\nnew schools by the Government, the distribution  of\r\n\r\nschools in the island in the past two years has not\r\n\r\nbeen  satisfactory. Has it been satisfactory?  Will\r\n\r\nthe  distribution of schools enable those who  live\r\n\r\nin crowded areas go to a school which is near their\r\n\r\nresidence? In building schools, does the Government\r\n\r\ntake  into  consideration  the  confidence  of  the\r\n\r\npeople who live in this island?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the reunification of all streams of\r\n\r\neducation,  what should be the criterion?  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  the  P.A.P. never stated clearly  in  its\r\n\r\nFive-Year  Development Plan its  education  policy.\r\n\r\nThey just mentioned the policy of reunification  of\r\n\r\nthe  four  streams of education without giving  any\r\n\r\nconcrete   scheme.   Does   it   mean   that    the\r\n\r\nreunification of the four streams of  education  is\r\n\r\nto  be  based  on  the  policy of  anglicising  all\r\n\r\nvernacular  schools?  This  policy  needs   to   be\r\n\r\nreviewed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about textbooks used in schools. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  could  only  talk  about  standardising\r\n\r\nsyllabuses, but they could not give ample  time  to\r\n\r\nthe  publishers  to print the textbooks.  So  today\r\n\r\nthere is much confusion and a lot of trouble in the\r\n\r\nschools in regard to the availability of textbooks.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Junior IV students in Chinese\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschools  have  to  spend more money  on  textbooks,\r\n\r\nbecause  there are textbooks on Physics, Chemistry,\r\n\r\nGeometry,  Algebra, and others.  In  the  past,  in\r\n\r\nChinese schools every year the students study  only\r\n\r\none  subject.  Now  because of the  change  in  the\r\n\r\nsystem they have to have the same subjects as  used\r\n\r\nin the English schools. But these textbooks are not\r\n\r\navailable  in  the  market.  Therefore,  when   the\r\n\r\nschools reopen this year, the students will have to\r\n\r\nbuy  more textbooks and their parents will have  to\r\n\r\nincur a lot of expenses. The burden on the students\r\n\r\nas  well as on the teachers will also increase.  On\r\n\r\nthis  subject  the  Government has  to  review  its\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the P.A.P. came to power, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  adopted  a  new  education  policy   in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the training of teachers, that  is  to\r\n\r\nsay,  the teachers have to teach as well as  attend\r\n\r\ntraining classes every day. As a result, there have\r\n\r\nbeen  a  lot of complaints by the teachers. In  the\r\n\r\nmorning they have to teach in far-away schools  for\r\n\r\nhalf  a day and in the afternoon they have to  rush\r\n\r\nto   the  Teachers'  Training  College  to  receive\r\n\r\ntraining.  Every day about two or three hours  will\r\n\r\nbe  wasted on transport. Is this kind of  system  a\r\n\r\nvery  good and ideal system for teachers' training?\r\n\r\nThis  is another question which causes the teachers\r\n\r\nmuch dissatisfaction and also needs review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is that of the applications from\r\n\r\naided  schools to expand or build new schools.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment's   restrictions  and   regulations   as\r\n\r\nregards  these applications have also  resulted  in\r\n\r\nmany  complaints from the applicants.  Today  there\r\n\r\nare about 3,000 teachers who have been teaching for\r\n\r\nmany  years, but because they do not have  the  so-called   recognised  certificates,  their  position\r\n\r\ncannot  be safeguarded and they cannot have  yearly\r\n\r\nincrements  as  the other teachers  have.  I  think\r\n\r\nthere  are about 1,000 such teachers and  they  are\r\n\r\nvery dissatisfied with the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about school administration and students\r\n\r\nin schools. We know that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsince  the  beginning of this year there  has  been\r\n\r\nmuch  confusion  in schools because  some  teachers\r\n\r\nhave  been transferred. Because some students  have\r\n\r\nalso   been   transferred  to  other  schools   and\r\n\r\nexamination centres, there have also been  quite  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  complaints from them.  I  would  ask  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers in this House to pay attention to them. Can\r\n\r\nall these causes be blamed on the Barisan Sosialis?\r\n\r\nWhat  are  the causes? I hope the P.A.P. have  the\r\n\r\ncourage to admit that they have probably made  some\r\n\r\nmistakes. They should have the courage to  confront\r\n\r\nthese  problems and seek an honest way  to  rectify\r\n\r\ntheir  mistakes  and  not take this  Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  as  something to achieve  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nputting  the  blame on certain people  and  finding\r\n\r\nscapegoats. In the past few days, we have heard the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  say  in  this  Assembly  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  intends to form about four  Commissions\r\n\r\nof   Inquiry  to  investigate  into  four  separate\r\n\r\ntopics.  Under these circumstances,  I  am  of  the\r\n\r\nopinion   that  it  is  more  necessary   for   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to ensure that the correct  motive  for\r\n\r\nthe  establishment of these Commissions of  Inquiry\r\n\r\nshould  be to investigate into the mistakes of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  order  that  it  can  rectify   its\r\n\r\nmistakes.  If  it  does not give this  undertaking,\r\n\r\nthen  there can be an impression outside this House\r\n\r\nthat  the Government's intention to establish these\r\n\r\nCommissions of Inquiry is to find out who have been\r\n\r\nbad  men, who have been evil-doers, who have  taken\r\n\r\npart  in strikes, in the boycotting of examinations\r\n\r\nand  so  on. Therefore, the Government must clarify\r\n\r\nits intention in establishing these Commissions  of\r\n\r\nInquiry.  It  must say that it has no intention  of\r\n\r\ntrying  to pin the blame on anybody. It should  say\r\n\r\nthat  this is not the purpose of the Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry.  The  work  of the Commission  of  Inquiry\r\n\r\nshould   result  in  alleviating  the   fears   and\r\n\r\nsuspicions  in the minds of teachers,  parents  and\r\n\r\nstudents  and the public generally. Only then  will\r\n\r\nit serve its purpose. I suggest that the Government\r\n\r\nshould  establish, first of all,  a  Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry to investigate into matters in the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Education. After the conclusions are arrived\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat,  the Commission could look into student boycott\r\n\r\nof  the  Government's Junior IV  examinations.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should not try to mix up  these  issues\r\n\r\ntogether by allowing them to be investigated by one\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I had not intended to talk too\r\n\r\nmuch,  but  just  now  the Minister  for  Education\r\n\r\nlevelled  a lot of criticisms at my colleague,  the\r\n\r\nformer Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation, in relation to his personal work in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry. Therefore, I find it necessary to  say  a\r\n\r\nfew  words. When I was still in the P.A.P.,  I  was\r\n\r\nnot  satisfied  with the education policy  and  the\r\n\r\nmeasures   taken  by  the  P.A.P.   Government   in\r\n\r\nimplementing it. Therefore, at various  conferences\r\n\r\nof  Parliamentary Secretaries, I very often said to\r\n\r\nthe   Prime  Minister  that  in  dealing  with  the\r\n\r\neducation policy, the P.A.P. Government is  like  a\r\n\r\nship.  Every  year there are a lot  of  passengers,\r\n\r\nnamely,  the students, who want to board the  ship.\r\n\r\nSo it would appear that the ship should be enlarged\r\n\r\nto  provide for more accommodation. There should be\r\n\r\na   larger  ship  to  accommodate  the  number   of\r\n\r\npassengers, that is, the pupils. If the  Government\r\n\r\ncould  achieve  this, then it would  be  fortunate.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  its  socialist policies  could  not  be \r\n\r\nrealised.  So  the Government should  try  to  find\r\n\r\nappropriate means to advance its socialist aims and\r\n\r\nto achieve socialist policies. Therefore, education\r\n\r\nhas  a great part to play in the Government's  aims\r\n\r\nand policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Minister for Education is a very hard-working\r\n\r\nman.  But in dealing with the education policy,  he\r\n\r\nis  not  very sure of himself. In making  policies,\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister has to give his  direction  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the political aspect. When the  former\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation  was still in his Ministry, the  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself   could   not   deny   that   his    former\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary was very hard-working  and\r\n\r\ndiligent.  He  was very punctual in  going  to  the\r\n\r\noffice, and very often he even stayed in the office\r\n\r\nafter  4.30  p.m.  Why  should  there  be  such   a\r\n\r\nsituation?  Well, it was because in the  policy  of\r\n\r\norganisation, the Minister for Education himself\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould not make his own decision. So he had to  work\r\n\r\nvery  hard.  But  politically  he  was  lacking  in\r\n\r\nexperience. I can give you an example to illustrate\r\n\r\nthis point. As pointed out by the Minister himself,\r\n\r\nI   had   occasion  to  act  as  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  the Minister for Education.  When  I\r\n\r\nwent there, I discovered there was a terrifying lot\r\n\r\nof  work  to  do. This was because almost  all  the\r\n\r\ndocuments relating to Chinese schools in Singapore,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  those  concerning the  teachers  and  the\r\n\r\nprincipals, and even those concerning the  hawkers,\r\n\r\nthe  ice-cream hawkers, the canteens and the  tuck-shops  in  the  schools had to be referred  to  the\r\n\r\noffice of the Parliamentary Secretary. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nyou  can imagine that under such circumstances, you\r\n\r\nwould have to spend even the whole of your life  on\r\n\r\nthese  papers without being able to make  a  proper\r\n\r\nreorganisation of the education system. The  reason\r\n\r\nwhy    the   question   of   education   and    its\r\n\r\nadministration has not been properly solved is very\r\n\r\nsimple.  There  is  a  shortage  of  administrative\r\n\r\nofficers  who  know  Chinese  in  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation. Some of the officers who have to act  as\r\n\r\nliaison  officers  between  the  Ministry  and  the\r\n\r\nChinese  schools do not know Chinese. They have  to\r\n\r\nspeak  in English. Same officers and principals  of\r\n\r\nschools   who  do  not  know  English   find   some\r\n\r\ndifficulty  about  it.  Those  officers  who   know\r\n\r\nEnglish  have  no  knowledge of the  conditions  in\r\n\r\nChinese   schools,  and  they   are   also   having\r\n\r\ndifficulty.  In the primary and secondary  schools,\r\n\r\nthe  principals do not know very much English. This\r\n\r\nis  a  fact. So if the Government does not want  to\r\n\r\nreorganise in this respect, that is, to achieve the\r\n\r\naim  of  having good liaison between the Ministry's\r\n\r\nofficers and the school authorities, then how could\r\n\r\nwe  improve  our education? It is impossible.  Take\r\n\r\nanother  example.  Inspectors  of  schools  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education are engaged on the condition\r\n\r\nthat  they  must have a good standard  of  English.\r\n\r\nThey must be able to make reports on their findings\r\n\r\nin  the schools in English. So when we engage  this\r\n\r\nkind  of inspector to go round the Chinese schools,\r\n\r\nhe is in a very difficult position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  is  up  to the Ministry itself to get  suitable\r\n\r\nofficers to do such work. It is necessary for me to\r\n\r\nsay  a few words in defence of my colleague who has\r\n\r\nbeen criticised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when I was still a Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary,  I found that our views were  not  final\r\n\r\nviews.  The Prime Minister himself had occasion  to\r\n\r\ntell  us  about this. My colleague, the Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon Gardens, has pointed out that he was  not\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with  the policy of  the  Government  in\r\n\r\nrespect   of   capital  grant  for   the   building\r\n\r\nprogrammes  for  Chinese schools.  His  suggestions\r\n\r\nwere   not   only   expressed   at   meetings    of\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretaries but were also  mentioned\r\n\r\nat  meetings of Members of the Assembly, so that he\r\n\r\ncould  get  the  support of other  members  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. in   order  to  come  to  a   satisfactory\r\n\r\nconclusion.  But after he did this,  there  was  no\r\n\r\nimprovement  in respect of the building  programmes\r\n\r\nfor the Chinese schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take another example again. We have given our\r\n\r\nviews  on  other aspects of education. For example,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance has occasion after office\r\n\r\nto  go to some schools. He noticed there were  many\r\n\r\ncars  parked along the road leading to the schools.\r\n\r\nSo  he  formed  the opinion that  there  were  many\r\n\r\npeople  who were car owners. Therefore, he intended\r\n\r\nto  increase the school fees to $10 per month  just\r\n\r\nbecause  he  had  seen  so  many  cars  around  the\r\n\r\nschools.  But  for  us the Assemblymen  who  raised\r\n\r\nobjections  to  it, this increase  of  school  fees\r\n\r\nwould  have been imposed, and if it had been  done,\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. would have been in a worse position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the appointment of Inspectors of Schools and\r\n\r\nthe registration of teachers, the decision was that\r\n\r\nthe Member for Serangoon Gardens could make his own\r\n\r\nviews  as  to  the  registration  of  teachers  and\r\n\r\nappointment  of inspectors. But today  many  school\r\n\r\nteachers  in Chinese schools as well as  principals\r\n\r\nwill  remember  that in the initial  stage  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. taking power, there was really a tremendous\r\n\r\nnumber  of  circulars issued  by  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation. Every day they received at least half  a\r\n\r\ndozen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncirculars  from  the Ministry of  Education  asking\r\n\r\nthem  to  do  this and to do that. These  circulars\r\n\r\nwere  normally  contradictory. The  first  circular\r\n\r\nwould ask them to do this; then the second circular\r\n\r\nwould say, \"Oh, you do not have to do this\". And  a\r\n\r\nthird circular would again make another change.  So\r\n\r\nif   the  former  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Education had not done  his  best  to\r\n\r\nchange  the  whole situation, I believe the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment would have been ridiculed more and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the new Parliamentary Secretary to the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Education will not be too  satisfied\r\n\r\nwith  himself.  The  Ministry is  not  paying  much\r\n\r\nattention to the issue of circulars at the  moment.\r\n\r\nAll the Chinese school teachers know what kind of a\r\n\r\nlabour man our present Parliamentary Secretary  is.\r\n\r\nA  few  days ago I had occasion to meet  a  primary\r\n\r\nschool teacher in a Chinese school. He told me that\r\n\r\nthe  circulars issued in Chinese from the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education were actually unintelligible and that\r\n\r\nin  order to understand such circulars, he must get\r\n\r\na  teacher  of English to refer to the original  in\r\n\r\nEnglish  before he could understand the translation\r\n\r\nas  to  the instructions contained in the circular.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  this  is  because  our  Minister  and  his\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary are on top.  They  are  too\r\n\r\nhigh-sounding  and  50 many teachers  are  treating\r\n\r\nthis as a laughing stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to take up too\r\n\r\nmuch  of  the time of this House to enumerate  more\r\n\r\nexamples  of  the  mistakes  made  by  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  in respect of education.  I  hope  they\r\n\r\nwill  understand and realise that in  dealing  with\r\n\r\neducation,  they are inexperienced  and  they  have\r\n\r\nmade many mistakes which could have been avoided. I\r\n\r\nhope  they will not treat the establishment of  the\r\n\r\nCommission  of Inquiry as one intended  to  find  a\r\n\r\nscapegoat for their own mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  rise  to support the motion to  appoint  a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry for four reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first reason is that education today is playing\r\n\r\na greater and greater role\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan ever before in the progress and prosperity  of\r\n\r\na nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second reason is that education has been\r\n\r\ninternationally recognised as the answer to most of\r\n\r\nthe  problems  especially of newly independent  and\r\n\r\ndeveloping nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third reason is that a policy that was suitable\r\n\r\nfor  the  Colony of Singapore is no longer suitable\r\n\r\nfor  a  Singapore  that is rapidly  moving  towards\r\n\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth and last reason, Sir, is that there are\r\n\r\na  number  of educational problems which,  if  left\r\n\r\nunsolved,  will  lead not only to  stagnation,  but\r\n\r\nalso  to  retro-gradation, discontent and  probably\r\n\r\neven disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old days when I was a pupil, the duty of\r\n\r\nthe  teacher  was  to teach the three  Rs,  and  to\r\n\r\nprepare  the pupils for a white collar  job.  Today\r\n\r\nthose functions still exist, but are definitely not\r\n\r\nsufficient.  The standard of living of  a  country,\r\n\r\nthe health of the people, the morals and morale  of\r\n\r\nthe population, the extent of juvenile delinquency,\r\n\r\ndepend  upon the system of education today. Whether\r\n\r\nthere  is a population explosion or not, even  that\r\n\r\ndepends   on   how  educated  the  population   is.\r\n\r\nProsperity in trade, agriculture, commerce and  the\r\n\r\nextent  of crime, all these depend on education  in\r\n\r\nthe  country.  That is why I feel the  question  of\r\n\r\neducation  is so vital. International organisations\r\n\r\nlike the Economic Council of Asia and the Far East,\r\n\r\nthe  World Health Organisation, etc., do  not  have\r\n\r\neducation specially placed within their ambit.  But\r\n\r\nif you read reports of all these organisations, not\r\n\r\na  single  one  of  them  has  failed  or  has  not\r\n\r\nmentioned  education as the answer to the  problems\r\n\r\nthat are facing especially new nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said, a policy that is suitable for\r\n\r\nthe  Colony  of  Singapore is  no  longer  suitable\r\n\r\ntoday,  because  today loyalty  to  the  State  and\r\n\r\nnation of Malaya and national pride must be part of\r\n\r\nour  education system today. There are 12 important\r\n\r\nmatters, Sir, which I feel the Commission should go\r\n\r\ninto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter concerning the different language\r\n\r\nstreams  of  education.  The  education  system  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  is more complicated than in many  places\r\n\r\nin other parts of the world. I am not blaming the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Education. He  could  not  help  it.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  the  multi-racial  character  of   the\r\n\r\npopulation,  different  streams  of  education   in\r\n\r\ndifferent languages are necessary, and the Minister\r\n\r\nhimself  will  admit, I believe, that  the  present\r\n\r\nsystem  is causing discontentment amongst a section\r\n\r\nof  the  people. I feel the recommendations of  the\r\n\r\nCommission would be very useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter that I would like to raise is\r\n\r\nthe  shortage  of teachers. Again, Sir,  I  am  not\r\n\r\nblaming the Minister for Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> It is partly the result of\r\n\r\nthe stagnation of teachers' training and stagnation\r\n\r\nof  education  during the Japanese  occupation  and\r\n\r\nalso  the  rapidly increasing youth  population  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But I would like to draw the Minister's\r\n\r\nattention  to  the  detrimental  effects   of   the\r\n\r\nshortage  of  teachers  and  to  urge  him  to   do\r\n\r\neverything within his power - I know it is difficult,\r\n\r\nbut  a Commission of experts might be able to  give\r\n\r\nsome recommendations to try and solve this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a student of the Senior Cambridge in December\r\n\r\nwho  depends on adults to run his life for  him  in\r\n\r\nDecember suddenly finds in January that he has been\r\n\r\nput as a teacher, an adult running the lives of  40\r\n\r\nlittle children. That sudden switch usually is  too\r\n\r\nmuch  for a youth of 18, 19 or 20 to take all of  a\r\n\r\nsudden.  The disaster is not only on him, but  also\r\n\r\non the 40 little children at a most delicate age. I\r\n\r\nknow  the problem is very difficult -  again I stress\r\n\r\nI  am not blaming the Minister - but I do urge him to\r\n\r\ndo  something to see what can be done to avoid this\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third matter is the shortage of secondary\r\n\r\nschools.  Parents are quite concerned because  they\r\n\r\nfeel  that they have been kept in the dark  of  the\r\n\r\nbasis of promotion or absorption into the secondary\r\n\r\nschools  of  Primary  Schools Entrance  Examination\r\n\r\npasses; not that they suspect any foul play, I  did\r\n\r\nnot mean that, Sir. They feel that they do not know\r\n\r\nwhether  a  student is promoted  on  his  aggregate\r\n\r\nmarks, or has he got\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  pass  special subjects, or is  there  a  quota,\r\n\r\nthrough  which the promotion into secondary schools\r\n\r\nis made. If it is on merit, what is the standard of\r\n\r\nmerit that they have to reach, and is that standard\r\n\r\nconsistent  every year? Or does it  depend  on  the\r\n\r\nquota  of available seats in the secondary schools?\r\n\r\nParents feel that they do not know all this and the\r\n\r\ndanger is this. Because of ignorance, it has  given\r\n\r\nrise  to  this suspicion. I want to make  it  clear\r\n\r\nthat I am not making it as an allegation that it is\r\n\r\nhappening.  I  am  just  making  a  statement  that\r\n\r\nparents   have   come  to  me  stating   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, in order to show that they have lots of\r\n\r\nvacancies  and that they can absorb all the  passes\r\n\r\nof  the  entrance  exam  nation  from  the  primary\r\n\r\nschools,  are  using what they  call  a  trick,  it\r\n\r\nseems,  by  sifting  out  those  students  who  are\r\n\r\nabsorbed  into  the secondary school  Form  II  and,\r\n\r\nafter one year, when they get to Form III, for some\r\n\r\nreason if they do not reach a certain standard that\r\n\r\nis  required, they are sacked. Therefore, more  and\r\n\r\nmore vacancies are created to get students from the\r\n\r\nprimary  schools into Form II. Now, this  situation\r\n\r\nmay  not exist, Sir, and I am not alleging that  it\r\n\r\ndoes.  But  I  am just saying, because parents  are\r\n\r\nbeing kept in the dark as to how the children  from\r\n\r\nthe  primary  schools  are being  promoted  to  the\r\n\r\nsecondary   schools,  all  sorts  of  doubts,   and\r\n\r\nsuspicions are being created. It would be good  for\r\n\r\na commission to sit and inquire into this and bring\r\n\r\nto  light  how primary school entrance  examination\r\n\r\npasses  are  judged,  and on what  basis  they  are\r\n\r\npromoted to secondary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my fourth subject is discontentment among\r\n\r\nChinese school students. You yourself know  of  the\r\n\r\ndiscontentment.  I  am  not  standing  up  for  the\r\n\r\nstudents.  Where I am concerned,  as  I  have  said\r\n\r\nbefore, and I stand by it, I think the 4 : 2 system\r\n\r\nis  better,  because it brings the  Chinese  school\r\n\r\npasses  up  to  standard and  they  have  the  same\r\n\r\nqualification as the English schools; and  if  they\r\n\r\nare  going  to stand for competition for Government\r\n\r\njobs  or  professions, I think it is a  good  thing\r\n\r\nthat they do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncome  up  to the same level and be reads for  equal\r\n\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.14 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fifth point is discrimination against women,\r\n\r\nespecially   the   legally  married   teachers.   I\r\n\r\nemphasise \"the legally married teachers\". Sir, this\r\n\r\ninjustice has been perpetuated for 13 years and the\r\n\r\nfact  that this injustice could be traced  back  to\r\n\r\nhistory  is  no  reason  for  justification  for  a\r\n\r\nsocialist Government, or a Government which  claims\r\n\r\nto  be  socialist, which promised in the  elections\r\n\r\nthat  they  would implement - not only was  it  their\r\n\r\nbelief - equal  pay for equal work. Two  and  a  half\r\n\r\nyears  have gone by and nothing has been done.  You\r\n\r\nwill agree with me, Sir, that unjust discrimination\r\n\r\nagainst anybody at all causes unhappiness and, to a\r\n\r\ncertain  extent,  an  inferiority  complex.   Women\r\n\r\nteachers  are  usually employed in primary  schools\r\n\r\nwhere  they  deal with children of a  delicate  and\r\n\r\ntender  age. An unhappy teacher with a  feeling  of\r\n\r\ninferiority complex is by no means an ideal teacher\r\n\r\nfor young children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next subject is textbooks. I quite\r\n\r\nappreciate  the  difficulty  of  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  concerning this subject  because,  as  I\r\n\r\nhave  said,  we  are moving towards an  independent\r\n\r\nSingapore  and the contents of textbooks will  have\r\n\r\nto   be  changed  from  a  foreign  background  and\r\n\r\natmosphere  to a Malayan background and atmosphere.\r\n\r\nNational pride and loyalty have to be fostered. The\r\n\r\nemphasis on white-collar jobs is now giving way  to\r\n\r\nthe  importance  of science, and even  moral  codes\r\n\r\nconcerning   certain  subjects,   especially   with\r\n\r\nreligious    bodies,   are   changing.   Therefore,\r\n\r\ntextbooks have to be changed. I quite realised  and\r\n\r\nI  appreciate that the Education Department - if I am\r\n\r\nnot  mistaken - has a Textbooks Committee working  on\r\n\r\nthis and that textbooks are slowly being changed to\r\n\r\nsuit the occasion. But, Sir, I urge the Minister to\r\n\r\ntake an interest in this textbook question and  put\r\n\r\nall that he can into it because it is causing a lot\r\n\r\nof  hardship.  Changes are necessary.  But  let  me\r\n\r\npoint\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  to you that unnecessary changes are causing  a\r\n\r\ngreat strain on the pockets of poor parents.  If  a\r\n\r\npoor  man has six children, he expects to  buy  one\r\n\r\nset  of  books to be passed on year by year to  his\r\n\r\nchild  number  two, number three, and  so  on.  But\r\n\r\nbecause of the frequent changes in textbooks, every\r\n\r\nyear,  a  parent with six children has to  buy  six\r\n\r\nsets  of textbooks every year and he cannot  afford\r\n\r\nit,  with the result that his children have  to  go\r\n\r\nwithout   education.  That  is  what   is   causing\r\n\r\nilliteracy  in  the country. So although  it  looks\r\n\r\nvery  innocent - the cost of textbooks, say, is  $30:\r\n\r\nsix  children, $180 (one month's pay or  more  than\r\n\r\none  month's pay) -  the parents cannot afford it and\r\n\r\nthis is the cause of illiteracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge the Minister to go into the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  textbooks  very  thoroughly.  Another\r\n\r\npoint, Sir: the Government does lend free textbooks\r\n\r\nto  school children who cannot afford them, but the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  books is limited, and if the Government\r\n\r\nor  the  schools  keep on changing the  books,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment too are wasting money because they  have\r\n\r\nto  buy  new  textbooks every  year  as  the  books\r\n\r\nreturned by the previous year's students cannot  be\r\n\r\nused  the  next year because the schools are  using\r\n\r\ndifferent  textbooks.  That  is  why  I  feel   the\r\n\r\ntextbook  problem is very important and I hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will do something about it  and  let  the\r\n\r\nCommission go into the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My seventh point is syllabuses. I have mentioned\r\n\r\nbefore   that   school-leavers  of  the   different\r\n\r\nlanguage streams will have to compete equally  with\r\n\r\nthe  world  outside for jobs. I do agree  with  the\r\n\r\nMinister  that  the  syllabuses  will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nstreamlined  so that they do reach a certain  level\r\n\r\nwhen  the  children of the different streams  leave\r\n\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My eighth point is that there are anomalies among\r\n\r\nthe people of equal qualifications in the Education\r\n\r\nDepartment.  I do not want to go into details,  but\r\n\r\nif  the  Minister would like to see me   - if  he  is\r\n\r\ninterested - I can tell him the different  posts  and\r\n\r\ndifferent  qualifications affected. Although  I  do\r\n\r\nnot   know  the  names  of  the  officers  who  are\r\n\r\ninvolved,   I   do   know   the   posts   and   the\r\n\r\nqualifications that are involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My ninth point is the system of having one\r\n\r\nprincipal   running  the  morning   and   afternoon\r\n\r\nschools. He is expected to go to one session. He is\r\n\r\nnot expected to stay the whole of the two sessions.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he has to be responsible for things that\r\n\r\nhappened  during  a session at  which  he  was  not\r\n\r\npresent. I think the Government Is making an effort\r\n\r\nto have senior teachers or something like that, but\r\n\r\nI  still feel that even with a senior teacher,  the\r\n\r\nprincipal is ultimately responsible, and he or  she\r\n\r\nis responsible for something which he or she has no\r\n\r\ncontrol over. I feel that by having two heads - one\r\n\r\nfor   the   morning  session  and   one   for   the\r\n\r\nafternoon - it  gives  more  opportunities  to  young\r\n\r\nteachers to rise to headmastership or headmistress-ship  and  it promotes a more efficient running  of\r\n\r\nthe   schools,   because  whoever   is   there   is\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  whatever happens  then, and  not\r\n\r\nsomebody who is at home or attending a class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now my tenth point is adult education. Sit, if you\r\n\r\nwill look at the 1957 census, you will see that  48\r\n\r\nper  cent  of  the over ten-year old population  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  are illiterate. The sad part  of  it  is\r\n\r\nthat out of this 48 per cent, which is 455,000,  94\r\n\r\nper   cent  are  citizens.  How  I  came  to   this\r\n\r\nconclusion  is  this.  We know  that  the  Chinese.\r\n\r\nMalays  and Indians (including Pakistanis) are  the\r\n\r\nmain  races  that form the citizens  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nOther races like Europeans, Australians, Americans,\r\n\r\nand  so  on who are citizens of Singapore are  very\r\n\r\nfew.  You will see that 54 per cent of the  Chinese\r\n\r\nare  illiterate; amongst the Malaysians, it  is  38\r\n\r\nper cent: amongst the Indians and Pakistanis, it is\r\n\r\n25  per  cent. But amongst the other races,  it  is\r\n\r\nonly   six  per  cent.  Therefore,  the   bulk   of\r\n\r\nilliterates are citizens of Singapore. I feel  that\r\n\r\nsomething  must be done. I know that the Government\r\n\r\nhas  organised language classes and adult  classes,\r\n\r\nbut  I  tin  not know how much these  classes  have\r\n\r\nhelped to reduce illiteracy among the citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my eleventh point is education through the\r\n\r\nradio.  In  more advanced countries, the radio  has\r\n\r\nbeen regarded as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na very strong arm of education. But in Singapore  - I\r\n\r\ndo not know whether, the Minister has been too busy\r\n\r\nto  look  into this  - it is an important thing.  The\r\n\r\nlistening  facilities  in  the  schools   and   the\r\n\r\nguidance  of education through the radio is  a  new\r\n\r\nsubject.

I have made  my\r\n\r\nruling  during the earlier part of the debate  when\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary Secretary was  replying  to  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Serangoon Gardens. He was replying  to\r\n\r\nwhat he had said last night in this Chamber. If the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  thought  that  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Gardens was going out of the motion,  he\r\n\r\nshould have raised it last night. Afterwards I have\r\n\r\nruled   that   it  is  quite  in  order   for   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary  to  reply  to  the  point\r\n\r\nraised  by  the Member for Serangoon Gardens-  that\r\n\r\nthe  commission of Inquiry should not go  into  the\r\n\r\npolitical  aspects,  and he touched  on  that  last\r\n\r\nnight.  Since the Barisan Sosialis have touched  on\r\n\r\nit, I think it would be fair to the Government side\r\n\r\nto  reply  to that. Nobody is going to  amend  this\r\n\r\nmotion. So far no amendment has been moved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the Member for Upper Serangoon  has\r\n\r\nsaid just now that education is closely related  to\r\n\r\npolitics.  Now  I  am  not  trying  to  digress  by\r\n\r\nbringing  in  other matters. I am  just  trying  to\r\n\r\nreply  to  what  he  has said.  He  says  that  our\r\n\r\nMinister for Education only knows how to work  hard\r\n\r\nwithout knowing what politics is like. He says that\r\n\r\npolitics  and education are closely related.  Since\r\n\r\nhe says that is so, how is it that he says that the\r\n\r\nCommission   of  Inquiry  should  not   look   into\r\n\r\npolitical activities as well?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also says that my predecessor had a lot of\r\n\r\nwork.  I  have  already touched upon that.  In  the\r\n\r\nmeantime, on certain aspects. I admit that  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education the work of the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary is rather heavy. But the Member for Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon  said  that in the course  of  two  years\r\n\r\nthere  was a shortage of officers who knew  Chinese\r\n\r\nand  there was too much work to be done.  Now  when\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  lot of work, we have to exercise  our\r\n\r\nbrains. We should not just work blindly. We have to\r\n\r\nfind  the  proper  system  in  order  to  get  good\r\n\r\nresults. I believe if my predecessor was really co-operative with the Minister for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation,  then they could easily have  found  the\r\n\r\nmeans to solve the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the Member for Upper Serangoon seems to be\r\n\r\ndefending   my  predecessor.  He  says   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is now trying to put all the  blame  on\r\n\r\nthe shoulders of my predecessor. In this respect, I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  is  not  so.  Frankly  speaking,  my\r\n\r\npredecessor  and  I  are still  on  good  terms  as\r\n\r\nbefore.  But  I  think  that  in  doing  his  work,\r\n\r\nespecially   in  his  attitude  towards   the   old\r\n\r\nteachers,  he  has  brought  the  Government   into\r\n\r\ndisrepute  among the schools. Some  principals  can\r\n\r\nstill  remember the occasion when he spoke  to  the\r\n\r\nold-timers  in  education. He  was  then  not  only\r\n\r\nimproper  in his attitude, but when the  principals\r\n\r\ncame to see him he also made them wait, instead  of\r\n\r\nasking them to sit down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> This has no relevance at all\r\n\r\nto  the  motion.

He  also\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the  Minister  for  Finance  wanted  to\r\n\r\nincrease the school fees to $10, but this  was  not\r\n\r\nput  into  practice as a result  of  the  objection\r\n\r\nraised  by  the  Assemblymen. Was he  not  slapping\r\n\r\nhimself?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again he talked about the circulars issued by the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of   Education  which   he   said   were\r\n\r\nunintelligible. But he did not produce any evidence\r\n\r\nof which particular sentence was unintelligible. I\r\n\r\ncan  also  say at random that so and so's  book  is\r\n\r\nunintelligible.

Members  on  the  Government  side   have\r\n\r\nchanged  the basis for establishing this Commission\r\n\r\nof  Inquiry. They have distorted facts.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nwant   to   say  it,  but  then  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary   to  the  Minister  for  Education   has\r\n\r\nmentioned  my  colleague,  the  Member  for   Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang, saying that he wanted to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontrol the Sin Min School. I have been teaching  in\r\n\r\nthe Sin Mm School. I am very familiar with what  is\r\n\r\ngoing  on in it. Everything going on there is  very\r\n\r\nclear.  The- Parliamentary Secretary says that  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Pasir Panjang wanted to  control  that\r\n\r\nschool. This is an entirely baseless accusation. If\r\n\r\nthe Member for Pasir Panjang and several members of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis have contributed money to the\r\n\r\nschool,  they  are,  of  course,  sponsors  of  the\r\n\r\nschool.

I do not think this Assembly\r\n\r\nis interested in any evidence at the moment.

Therefore,   the\r\n\r\ndirectors   of  the  Management  Board   were   not\r\n\r\nsatisfied and so he resigned.

If\r\n\r\nthey  persist  in  saying that they  are  the  true\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the people of  Singapore,  they\r\n\r\nshould  guide  themselves  in  a  manner  in   this\r\n\r\nAssembly  which would not only gain the  confidence\r\n\r\nof  Members of this Assembly but also of the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we look carefully again into the motion\r\n\r\nthat  is  before  us, it is clearly indicated  that\r\n\r\nwhat is in the mind of the Member for Anson is that\r\n\r\nthere should be \"a Commission to enquire into the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  Education  Policy,  its  content  and\r\n\r\nadministration in all fields other than  vocational\r\n\r\nand  technical  education ...\" The  motion  clearly\r\n\r\nindicates  that the Commission should go  into  all\r\n\r\naspects of the educational policy of the Government,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexcept  in  the  fields  of  vocational  and\r\n\r\ntechnical education.

This is a very\r\n\r\nimportant question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I listened with regret to what\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Education said. Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  think  you  will  agree that we  cannot  achieve\r\n\r\nperfection in dealing with any matter. The  purpose\r\n\r\nof  this motion is to find out whether the Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Education  has  made  any  mistakes  in   his\r\n\r\neducation  policy  so that there  can  be  a  clear\r\n\r\nsolution.   But   he   has   tried   to   put   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  on  others. I  feel  this  is  very\r\n\r\nunjust.  I  think the setting up of this Commission\r\n\r\nof Inquiry should be above politics. Only then will\r\n\r\nit  have any value. This question not only concerns\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House, but I believe that  outside\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly,  parents,  students,  teachers  and\r\n\r\nmanagement  committees of schools  also  have  many\r\n\r\nopinions  and  views to offer on this question.  If\r\n\r\nthis   Commission  of  Inquiry  gets  involved   in\r\n\r\npolitics, then the public will not be interested in\r\n\r\nit.    I   believe   that   not   only   is   there\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction in Chinese schools,  but  there  is\r\n\r\nalso discontentment in other schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We of the U.P.P. have three points to put forward.\r\n\r\nFirst,  when this Commission of Inquiry is set  up,\r\n\r\nit should be above politics.

He was good enough to say that I  write\r\n\r\nin  and indicate my views. I wrote in, and then  he\r\n\r\nwas good enough, Mr Speaker, Sir, on 21st December\r\n\r\nto  give  an  assurance  in this  House  that  that\r\n\r\nCommission would be appointed; and in all sincerity\r\n\r\nI  asked leave to withdraw. But I was told I had to\r\n\r\nfollow  a certain procedure. Mr Speaker,  at  that\r\n\r\ntime I expressed gratification and appreciation  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister. Unfortunately, he seems  to  have\r\n\r\ntaken it as being personally directed against  him,\r\n\r\nand  he  said  that I was gleeful - as though  I  was\r\n\r\ncelebrating  a victory. I can assure  the  Minister\r\n\r\nthat that was not the intention in my mind, however\r\n\r\nmuch   he  may  in  his  ultra-sensitiveness   have\r\n\r\nmisunderstood  me.  But we  all  assumed,  at  that\r\n\r\njuncture, particularly as he had indicated that the\r\n\r\nGovernment would not introduce the measures it  had\r\n\r\nin  mind  for  the relaxation of the  six-day  week\r\n\r\nbecause of the appointment of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  Commission,  that he would forthwith  appoint\r\n\r\nthat Commission so there would be no undue delay in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  matters vital to vast numbers  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation.  In  common,  I  am  sure,  with   many\r\n\r\nMembers,  I  learned  with consternation  from  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  in answer to my  question  on  the\r\n\r\nCommission  in respect of the People's  Association\r\n\r\nthat  the  Commission suggested by this motion  was\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  the last of four that  he  wanted  a\r\n\r\nSupreme Court Judge to chair, and that since  there\r\n\r\nwas  only one Judge available the Commission  would\r\n\r\nbe  appointed in the never, never future of  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nfogland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was then, Mr Speaker if you will remember, as\r\n\r\nyou  were present on the Monday, that I urged  that\r\n\r\nit  was  not necessary to have a Judge. He  pointed\r\n\r\nout  that  the  second  limb  of  the  motion,  the\r\n\r\nproposed terms of reference which I had sent in  in\r\n\r\nmy   letter   and  which  referred   to   political\r\n\r\nmachinations  in schools, did require  a  Judge.  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Well,  could  you  not  join  that  to  the\r\n\r\nCommission  you  have in mind  in  respect  of  the\r\n\r\nboycott of the first secondary school examination?\"\r\n\r\nAnd  his  reply, Mr Speaker, if you will remember,\r\n\r\nwas, \"Oh, this is a radically new matter. Would you\r\n\r\nwrite to the Minister for Education?\" It was  on  a\r\n\r\nMonday  evening at about 3 o'clock. The  very  next\r\n\r\nmorning  on  a  basis of urgency  I  wrote  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  using the words, \"I urge that you  should\r\n\r\nnow  touch on the second limb of the proposed terms\r\n\r\nof  reference to the political commission and leave\r\n\r\nthe  terms of reference including the six-day  week\r\n\r\nto  a commission of educationists.\" And \"Would  you\r\n\r\nplease\" - I said \"please\", Sir, I may use the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's favourite word politely and these\r\n\r\nare the words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As regards the first part of my terms of\r\n\r\nreference  which  incorporate the words  \"including\r\n\r\nthe six-day week\" in the Motion before the House, I\r\n\r\nwould urge that the only proper body to investigate\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  body of educationalists and  that  the\r\n\r\nappointment of such a body should be proceeded with\r\n\r\nwith  vigour  and  finalised this  month.

The very fact that he has  in  mind  a\r\n\r\nrelaxation  of the six-day week means that  finally\r\n\r\nhe  has  been  convinced that there  is  widespread\r\n\r\nintense and genuine dissatisfaction on the part  of\r\n\r\nparents  and  educationists who say, \"Our  children\r\n\r\nneed time for human activities, to make friends, to\r\n\r\ngo  on picnics, to indulge in the many things  that\r\n\r\nbuild  human character. We don't want our  children\r\n\r\nto  be  made  into  P.A.P. machines.  We  want  our\r\n\r\neducational system to produce decent human  beings.\r\n\r\nIt  doesn't  matter whether they are fully  stuffed\r\n\r\nwith  this, that or the other. We want decent human\r\n\r\nbeings.\" And you cannot have that if you have their\r\n\r\nnoses to the grindstone six days a week. Be fair to\r\n\r\nour future citizens. We recognise it is legitimate,\r\n\r\nand  yet, Sir, they have the gall to come here  and\r\n\r\nsay to us:\r\n\r\n\"First, we will postpone the relaxation of the six-day  week  we have in mind. Second, you  will  have\r\n\r\nyour  Commission  in the never never  land  of  the\r\n\r\nfoggy future of the dying P.A.P.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the six-day week freeze, as one newspaper has it headlined, is unwarranted. I do repeat that in fairness to our school population, to the parents and the teachers too! (But they, to me, Sir, are not as important as the school children.) Whatever was contemplated by way of\r\n\r\nrelaxation, let us have now. But it is no  question\r\n\r\nhere   of   anything  being  sub  judice.   I   say\r\n\r\nfurthermore,  Sir, that this Commission  should  be\r\n\r\nappointed  with all speed. We have had three  weeks\r\n\r\nsince  the Minister promised us. He complains  that\r\n\r\nhis former Parliamentary Secretary sat on the files\r\n\r\nand the silver\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfish escaped from his drawer into his Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary's  drawer.  It  seems  to  me  that   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary's  silver  fish  have  now\r\n\r\nescaped into the Minister's drawer, because he  has\r\n\r\nhad  three weeks, Sir,I for one believed that  he\r\n\r\nwas quite honest when he said that he was going  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  commission. I for one anticipated a  Press\r\n\r\nstatement  at least to indicate the appointment  of\r\n\r\nthis  Commission.  We have had three  whole  weeks,\r\n\r\nSir - three  whole  weeks in which nothing  seems  to\r\n\r\nhave been done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is one small point I would like to correct and which seems to have been misunderstood.\r\n\r\nI have been asked why has there been an  exclusion \r\n\r\nof vocational and technical  training from the scope\r\n\r\nof this Commission. I would like  to remind  Members  \r\n\r\nthat  there  is  a  Commission  on\r\n\r\nvocational and technical training. In fact, we  had\r\n\r\na  Report from it on the 25th of October.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhy   I   am  excluding  vocational  and  technical\r\n\r\ntraining from this motion. I repeat, Sir,  that  it\r\n\r\nis obvious from the sentiments expressed in fact by\r\n\r\nboth sides of the House when they were slinging mud\r\n\r\nat  each  other  in a curious contest  of  throwing\r\n\r\nthings,  like  a quarrelsome, ill-mannered  husband\r\n\r\nand  his wife who have separated. When matters were\r\n\r\nreferred   to   which  were  pertinent,   everybody\r\n\r\nrecognises  the  validity of the request  for  this\r\n\r\nmotion  whose  intent is not to  criticise  but  to\r\n\r\nascertain after a lapse of time where we are going,\r\n\r\nwhether  it is in the right direction, and  how  we\r\n\r\nare  to  trim our future course. As the Member  for\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai has quite rightly emphasised,  and  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to repeat it most emphatically,  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  intended to be limited in any sense whatsoever\r\n\r\nto any single stream of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I do urge that this Government recognise the responsibility forthwith to introduce\r\n\r\nthe  best measures available for the relaxation  of \r\n\r\nthe  six-day week, and that the appointment of this\r\n\r\nCommission of inquiry into education should be made now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes, 45; Noes, Nil; Paired,\r\n\r\n4; Absent, 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n            Ayes.

This followed our Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis Press statement on 28th December, 1961, in\r\n\r\nwhich  we  made  it abundantly clear  that  we  are\r\n\r\ncompletely  with  the Indonesian  people  in  their\r\n\r\nhopes  and aspirations on this issue, because  West\r\n\r\nIrian is a clear-cut example of remnant colonialism\r\n\r\nin   this  part  of  the  world.  Here  the   Dutch\r\n\r\ncolonialists   have  hoped  to   perpetuate   their\r\n\r\ncolonial rule by force of arms, occupying a part of\r\n\r\nIndonesian  territory  in  spite  of  their  having\r\n\r\nrecognised the independence of Indonesia and having\r\n\r\ntransferred    sovereignty   to   the    Indonesian\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  December 1949.  It  is  no  wonder,\r\n\r\ntherefore, that since then repeated calls have been\r\n\r\nmade  by  Indonesian  leaders to  drive  the  Dutch\r\n\r\ncolonialists from their homeland and to  regain  in\r\n\r\ntoto Indonesian territorial integrity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the campaign to liberate West Irian has\r\n\r\nrecently  been stepped up, after patience has  been\r\n\r\nexhausted. The Indonesian Government have now shown\r\n\r\nbeyond  doubt their determination to achieve  their\r\n\r\nobjective this time. Efforts have been made in  the\r\n\r\npast  by  well-wishers,  including  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment,  to  bring the disputing  parties   - the\r\n\r\nDutch and the Indonesian Governments - together to an\r\n\r\namicable   agreement  regarding  the  transfer   of\r\n\r\nsovereignty  of West Irian from the  Dutch  to  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Government. So far no  fruitful  result\r\n\r\nhas come about. The dispute has also gone up to the\r\n\r\nUnit-ed  Nations on many occasions since 1954.  But\r\n\r\nto this day, the issue is still not yet settled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Indonesia is a foreign country and we have no\r\n\r\nwish to meddle in the affairs of a foreign country.\r\n\r\nBut  Indonesia  is  also our neighbour.  Living  so\r\n\r\nclose   together,  we  in  Malaya  cannot  but   be\r\n\r\ninfluenced  and affected by events that take  place\r\n\r\nonly  a stone's throw, as it were, from our shores.\r\n\r\nJust as events from the Federation will affect  our\r\n\r\neveryday  life in Singapore, so events in Indonesia\r\n\r\nwill similarly affect us here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  it  is  more  than neighbourly  affection  and\r\n\r\nsympathy  that has prompted us to move this  motion\r\n\r\nbefore  the House today. We move this motion today,\r\n\r\nSir,  because the struggle of the Indonesian people\r\n\r\nis   not  merely  a  struggle  of  the  Indonesians\r\n\r\nthemselves.  It is not an isolated struggle  but  a\r\n\r\npart  of  the global struggle of oppressed  peoples\r\n\r\nagainst colonial domination. It is only a chain  in\r\n\r\nthe events of historical developments now unfolding\r\n\r\nbefore the world. As you know, Sir, colonialism  is\r\n\r\nthe scourge of the modern world. It gives cover  to\r\n\r\nthe   practice   of   racial   discrimination   and\r\n\r\nexploitation and to the practice of injustices  and\r\n\r\ninequalities on subject peoples. But since the turn\r\n\r\nof the century and especially so since World Wars I\r\n\r\nand  II,  people all over the world  have  awakened\r\n\r\nfrom their slumber in increasing numbers; and under\r\n\r\nthe  relentless pressure of the tide of nationalism\r\n\r\nand  self-determination of  the  awakening  masses,\r\n\r\ncolonialism is gradually forced on the retreat  all\r\n\r\nover  the  world.  More  and  more  countries   are\r\n\r\nregaining their dignity and self-respect. More  and\r\n\r\nmore countries are gaining their independence,  and\r\n\r\nmore  and  more countries are today represented  in\r\n\r\nthe   forum  of  the  United  Nations.  But  though\r\n\r\ncolonialism is on the retreat, it will not  retreat\r\n\r\nof  its  own  accord.  It will only  retreat  under\r\n\r\nrelentless pressure from the anti-colonial  forces.\r\n\r\nWe  have  vividly seen colonialism  fighting  last-ditch   battles   against  the   rising   tide   of\r\n\r\nnationalism  and anti-colonialism. For example,  in\r\n\r\nwhat  was  formerly French Indo-China, it  was  the\r\n\r\nutter  defeat at Dien Bien Phu which finally forced\r\n\r\nthe  French to retreat from the Far East.  Recently\r\n\r\nin  Goa, it was the strength of t-he Indian  people\r\n\r\nafter   more   than  four  centuries  of   colonial\r\n\r\nexploitation  that finally lowered  the  Portuguese\r\n\r\nflag  on  Indian soil. But in Indonesia, the  Dutch\r\n\r\nare still holding out, still clinging on leech-like\r\n\r\nat  the  expense of the Indonesian  people.  It  is\r\n\r\nobvious  that Dutch colonialism has not learnt  the\r\n\r\nbitter   lessons  of  history  or,  with   stubborn\r\n\r\nstupidity, have chosen to ignore such lessons,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not so long ago the Dutch themselves were\r\n\r\nsubjected  to  the same humiliating  experience  of\r\n\r\nhaving  to  live under the heel of Fascist  hordes.\r\n\r\nTheir own struggle for freedom should have been  an\r\n\r\nobject  lesson to the colonialists and should  have\r\n\r\nbrought  home  to  them that  of  all  basic  human\r\n\r\nrights,  one of the most important is the  inherent\r\n\r\nright of peoples to be free. Instead, the Dutch now\r\n\r\npractise  suppression themselves.  The  Dutch  must\r\n\r\nrealise that the tide of anti-colonial sentiment is\r\n\r\nnow enveloping all Afro-Asia and Latin America. But\r\n\r\nnow  because of their stupid obstinacy to  see  the\r\n\r\nwriting  on  the wall, an explosive  situation  has\r\n\r\ndeveloped  and is still developing in  West  Irian.\r\n\r\nSurely  the Dutch colonialist must know  that  t-he\r\n\r\ncourse of world history cannot be held back by  the\r\n\r\nintransigence of the imperialists. Today, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian people have decided on the liberation of\r\n\r\nWest  Irian.  In  their struggle  to  recover  West\r\n\r\nIrian,  in their struggle to bring it back  to  the\r\n\r\nfold  of  their  fatherland, the Indonesian  people\r\n\r\nwill  have to contend with stiff, strong opposition\r\n\r\nfrom   the  Dutch  colonialists,  backed  by  other\r\n\r\ncolonial and pro-colonial forces. We all know  that\r\n\r\nHolland is a staunch member of the Western bloc and\r\n\r\nwe  have  no  doubt that SEATO will be alerted  for\r\n\r\npossible intervention in an effort to frustrate the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  nationalist  attempt  to  recover  West\r\n\r\nIrian. We have no doubt that the Dutch stand on the\r\n\r\nissue  of  West Irian has won them the support  and\r\n\r\nsympathy  of  the Western powers. Already  we  have\r\n\r\nwitnessed   the   eagerness   of   the   Australian\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  come to the rescue  of  the  Dutch.\r\n\r\nHeadlines on the 12th of January this year tell  us\r\n\r\nthat  83,000 men in Australia are virtually on call\r\n\r\nfor  service in West Irian if required. We can see,\r\n\r\ntherefore, that the Indonesian struggle will not be\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Dutch  alone, but  also  against  the\r\n\r\ncombined might of colonialism in this part  of  the\r\n\r\nworld.  It  will therefore not be an easy struggle.\r\n\r\nIt  is  for  this reason, Sir, that we  admire  the\r\n\r\ncourage and determination of the Indonesian people.\r\n\r\nThey have refused to be cowed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the show of superior force of warships and  jet\r\n\r\nfighters of the Dutch colonial diehards. Sir,  such\r\n\r\na  show  of  superior arms does not hide  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat,  at the most, the imperialists can only delay\r\n\r\nthe  day of final reckoning. The strength, the will\r\n\r\nand  the  determination of the people  to  be  free\r\n\r\nbecome   an  irresistible  force  that  cannot   be\r\n\r\nstopped. Of course, in expressing our sympathy  for\r\n\r\nthe  anti-colonial movement, we are also expressing\r\n\r\nthe   hopes  and  aspirations  of  our  people   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Singapore is still a  colony.  We  have\r\n\r\nonly incomplete internal self-government. We shall,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  look  forward to the day  when  we  too\r\n\r\nshall be free. As the Federation has indicated that\r\n\r\nfull  merger  is  not possible, we  must  therefore\r\n\r\nthink  of  our  next  milestone  in  constitutional\r\n\r\nadvance -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

As  a  people  who  have\r\n\r\nexperienced  and  are  still experiencing  colonial\r\n\r\ndomination,  we  know full well  the  anguish,  the\r\n\r\nbitterness,  the  frustration and  the  humiliation\r\n\r\nexperienced  by  oppressed people. We  share  their\r\n\r\ncommon  hope for the abolition of hunger,  poverty,\r\n\r\nignorance  and disease. We share their common  hope\r\n\r\nfor  peace, progress, prosperity, equality, justice\r\n\r\nand democracy. And we share their common hope for a\r\n\r\nbetter society, a better livelihood for the people,\r\n\r\nand   an   increase   in  material   and   cultural\r\n\r\nadvancement for all mankind. Hence our sympathy for\r\n\r\nthe   heroic  struggle  of  the  Indonesian  people\r\n\r\nagainst colonial exploitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is heartening to know that there is\r\n\r\nalready  indirect  or  maybe  even  direct  contact\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Dutch and the Indonesian  Governments\r\n\r\nthrough  the  help of intermediaries. Let  us  hope\r\n\r\nthat  such  contact  this  time  will  bring  about\r\n\r\nfruitful negotiations that will lead to a lessening\r\n\r\nof  international tension and to a  final  peaceful\r\n\r\nsolution to the West Irian dispute, especially  now\r\n\r\nthat  self-determination  has  been  promised   the\r\n\r\nPapuans   by   the  Indonesian  Government.   This,\r\n\r\nhowever,  must  not  mean that  if  the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nnationalists  are compelled by the    recalcitrant\r\n\r\nDutch  colonialists to abandon the peaceful  method\r\n\r\nof  solution, we should condemn the Indonesians for\r\n\r\nusing force and so support the Dutch. We have  seen\r\n\r\nhow  even  Nehru's  patience was exhausted  by  the\r\n\r\nobstinate  Portuguese colonialists. Let  those  who\r\n\r\ncall  for  a peaceful settlement of the West  Irian\r\n\r\nissue  bear  in mind that it is not the  Indonesian\r\n\r\npeople  who  want to use force. Let  them  remember\r\n\r\nthat  the  Dutch are holding on to  West  Irian  by\r\n\r\nforce.  If  there is anyone who should  stop  using\r\n\r\nforce  right now, then it is the Dutch and not  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday's and today's news have already\r\n\r\nconfirmed the earlier reports that the first shots\r\n\r\nhave  been fired. The Dutch have claimed that  they\r\n\r\nacted   in   self-defence  and  have  captured   50\r\n\r\nIndonesian prisoners. But the Indonesian spokesman\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  made  it  quite  clear that  it  was  not  the\r\n\r\nIndonesians but the Dutch who fired first and  that\r\n\r\nthe  incident  definitely occurred  outside  Dutch-claimed territorial waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whichever version we may accept, the grim\r\n\r\nfact  is  that  the situation can  worsen  and  can\r\n\r\nfurther deteriorate. War or peace we in Malaya  are\r\n\r\nbound  to  be  affected and we can only  hope  that\r\n\r\nsaner counsel may yet prevail before it becomes too\r\n\r\nlate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I repeat, we all love peace and want peace,\r\n\r\nand  we  hope and want to have peaceful settlements\r\n\r\nto all disputes whenever possible. But it takes two\r\n\r\nparties  to come to a peaceful settlement.  Already\r\n\r\nthere are threats of \"racial war\" and of white  and\r\n\r\ncoloured  conflict coming from people who  believe\r\n\r\nin  racial  discrimination. This has been countered\r\n\r\nby  equally  stern  warnings of \"last-peace-offers\"\r\n\r\nfrom the Indonesians to the Dutch. In the midst  of\r\n\r\nall  this,  it  is indeed unfortunate that  another\r\n\r\nattempt  has  been  made on the life  of  President\r\n\r\nSoekarno. I am sure the House will join with me  in\r\n\r\ncondemning such barbaric activities which can  only\r\n\r\nadd  fuel  to  this  dispute and which  might  well\r\n\r\nrender  unavoidable a conflagration that the  whole\r\n\r\nworld  hopes  will not take place in spite  of  the\r\n\r\nfirst shots having been fired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We realise, Sir, that merely passing a resolution\r\n\r\nin   this  House  will  not  materially  help   the\r\n\r\nIndonesians  in their struggle against  imperialist\r\n\r\ndomination. But we are on the side of the righteous\r\n\r\nstruggle for justice and the struggle for the basic\r\n\r\nrights  of nations. We therefore would like to  add\r\n\r\nour  small  voice to the forum of world opinion  of\r\n\r\nmore  than half the people of the world in  support\r\n\r\nof the Indonesian people to liberate West Irian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like the motion in support of the Algerian\r\n\r\npeople  and  the  motion in  condemnation  of  the\r\n\r\nmurder of Lumumba, our resolution will merely be  a\r\n\r\ngesture; but, Sir, it is a gesture full of  meaning\r\n\r\nbecause  the struggle of the Indonesian people  is,\r\n\r\nin truth, a part of the world struggle of oppressed\r\n\r\npeoples\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagainst  colonial and imperialist  domination.

Sir, there are really\r\n\r\ntwo  approaches  to this motion on the  West  Irian\r\n\r\nissue.  One is in terms of Indonesian politics  and\r\n\r\nIndonesian  aspirations. The other is in  terms  of\r\n\r\nthe  increasing  difficulties and apprehensions  of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis in search of a gimmick. It  is\r\n\r\nnecessary for us to keep in mind these two  aspects\r\n\r\nof  the motion: the West Irian issue in relation to\r\n\r\nIndonesia:  and  the West Irian  issue  as  it  has\r\n\r\nrepercussions in Singapore and in so far as it acts\r\n\r\nas  a vitamin pill to restore the waning vigour  of\r\n\r\npolitical  forces which have already passed  in  so\r\n\r\nshort a time from a juvenile to a senile stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, insofar as it concerns the Indonesian people,\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. has made its stand clear long before the\r\n\r\nWest  Irian  issue came into prominence nearly  two\r\n\r\nyears  ago.  The P.A.P.'s stand on the  West  Irian\r\n\r\nissue  was contained in a joint statement  made  by\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister and Indonesia's First  Minister\r\n\r\nDjuanda  when the Prime Minister paid  a  visit  to\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  This  recognition of  the  validity  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia's  claim to West Irian, as  far  as  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  concerned, is  based  on  the  same\r\n\r\nprinciples and arguments which have led many of  us\r\n\r\nto support the liberation of Malaysia from colonial\r\n\r\nrule.  That  is why, Sir, we find it a little  more\r\n\r\nthan  odd  that  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  who   are\r\n\r\nfighting  Malaysia tooth and nail  on  a  different\r\n\r\nprinciple,  should  have  at  the  same  time  come\r\n\r\nforward  as  fervent champions of  merger  of  West\r\n\r\nIrian  with Indonesia. What are the principles  and\r\n\r\nreasons  to justify our contention that West  Irian\r\n\r\nis an integral part of Indonesia and that the Dutch\r\n\r\nshould retreat gracefully and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeacefully from the territory of West Irian? It has\r\n\r\nbeen  contended  by the Dutch that  West  Irian  is\r\n\r\nlinguistically,    culturally,     racially     and\r\n\r\ngeographically distinct from the rest of Indonesia,\r\n\r\nand  that the ultimate destiny of West Irian is  to\r\n\r\nbecome  a  separate self-governing State under  the\r\n\r\ntrusteeship  and tutelage of the Dutch.  The  Dutch\r\n\r\nobjective is self-determination for West Irian. The\r\n\r\nDutch  colonialists say they cannot hand over  West\r\n\r\nIrian  to  the  Indonesians  without  having  first\r\n\r\nascertained the wishes of the Papuans,  the  people\r\n\r\nof  West  Irian  - whether they want to  be  part  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia,   whether  they  want  to   merge   with\r\n\r\nIndonesia, and whether they want to exchange  Dutch\r\n\r\nrule for Indonesian rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, one would have thought\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> You are quoting the\r\n\r\nBarisan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, Sir, I am quoting the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  Sir, one would have thought  that  these\r\n\r\narguments  by  the  Dutch colonialists  would  have\r\n\r\nappealed  to  the  sense of logic  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, because they have used the same  argument\r\n\r\nto  oppose merger and Malaysia. Are we not  handing\r\n\r\nover  British colonies in North Borneo to the Tunku\r\n\r\nwithout  first  consulting the people,  the  people\r\n\r\nbeing  defined as the frightened and desperate  men\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan Sosialis? But in the case of  West\r\n\r\nIrian,  there is no mention by the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nabout  consulting  the people  of  West  Irian.  No\r\n\r\nquestion  is being asked whether internal  security\r\n\r\nwill be in the hands of the people of West Irian or\r\n\r\nof the Central Government of Indonesia. There is no\r\n\r\ndemand that elections should first be held in  West\r\n\r\nIrian to determine whether the Papuans do or do not\r\n\r\nwant to merge with Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from insisting on such conditions, the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  not  only  in  this  Chamber  but   also\r\n\r\noutside,  are ready to support a military  invasion\r\n\r\nof  West  Irian  by Indonesia. In  fact,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown told us earlier that  there\r\n\r\nwas a rally at which 10,000 people were present. As\r\n\r\nfar  as  I know  - and it was checked up - the  figures\r\n\r\nquoted by the newspapers (both the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish  and the Chinese) are stated to be  between\r\n\r\n5,000  and  6,000. And by the time the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown   ended  his  speech,  he   made   fresh\r\n\r\ncalculations  and said that there  were  more  than\r\n\r\n10,000  people. So in half an hour the  figure  had\r\n\r\nslightly increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, Sir, but more important - apart from\r\n\r\nsaying  that the Indonesians (and we believe  quite\r\n\r\nrightly)  are entitled to take West Irian by  force\r\n\r\nif  necessary, the Barisan Sosialis supporters, who\r\n\r\nwant  to  show that they support a forceful taking-over  of  West Irian by Indonesia, have volunteered\r\n\r\nto  fight for the liberation of West Irian. Sir, as\r\n\r\nan  indication, we had in the Straits Times of  4th\r\n\r\nJanuary,  1962,  a  picture and a  story  of  three\r\n\r\nSingapore  women  enlisting  for  the  West   Irian\r\n\r\ninvasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We want to eradicate colonialism from the face of\r\n\r\nAsia,\"  says  trio.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three young Singapore women,\r\n\r\nincluding  a  mother  of four, today  enlisted  for\r\n\r\nservice with Indonesian forces against the Dutch in\r\n\r\nWest Irian.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are impressed with very courageous women\r\n\r\nenlisting  for  service in West  Irian,  especially\r\n\r\nseeing  a  photograph of three  women  prepared  to\r\n\r\nvolunteer for service in West Irian. This only goes\r\n\r\nto  show  that the spirit of chivalry is  not  dead\r\n\r\namong  the Barisan Sosialis males. They believe  in\r\n\r\nwomen and children first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has made it quite clear in a\r\n\r\nstatement  issued that it has no wish  to  put  any\r\n\r\nhindrance in the way of any Barisan Sosialis men or\r\n\r\nwomen  who  may wish to participate  in  the  armed\r\n\r\nbattle for the liberation of West Irian. All we ask\r\n\r\nof  the  Member for Queenstown is that  he  should\r\n\r\nconcede to us non-violent, unromantic stay-at-homes\r\n\r\nthe  privilege  of  liberating  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nBorneo  territories from British rule  by  peaceful\r\n\r\nconstitutional  means. I say this, Sir,  because  I\r\n\r\nknow  that  the  Secretary-General of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, in a speech delivered during a mass rally\r\n\r\nin  support of West Irian, which, according to  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown,  drew  10,000  people  but\r\n\r\nwhich,  according to other more reliable witnesses,\r\n\r\namounted to between 5,000 and 6,000, drew for us at\r\n\r\nthis meeting what he called the lessons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be  learnt from the West Irian and Goa  issues.\r\n\r\nOne   of  the  things  he  said  is  that  in   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional game there is a lesson to  be  drawn\r\n\r\nfrom  the West Irian struggle, which was put across\r\n\r\nto what we say \"between 5,000 and 6,000 people\" but\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Member for Queenstown says amounted  to\r\n\r\n10,000  people. He said  - I quote from  the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes of 8th January:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`West Irian, they said, was the symbol of Western\r\n\r\ndomination  in  Asia  and the Western  powers  were\r\n\r\ntherefore keenly interested in preserving this ugly\r\n\r\nsymbol of their past glory. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We realise that the moment is coming when we too\r\n\r\nwill  receive the support and help of other  peace-loving people to free us from colonial domination,\"\r\n\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim called on the people of Singapore to draw a lesson from the West Irian and Goa issues.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This is what he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Let us not for one moment believe that forces\r\n\r\nsympathetic to Western imperialism want  to  assist\r\n\r\nus in our struggle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Colonialism cannot be ended by any form of\r\n\r\nconstitutional imposition,\".'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"cannot  be  ended  by any form  of  constitutional\r\n\r\nimposition\". I was not quite clear what  it  meant.\r\n\r\nSo  I  got  somebody to translate the same  article\r\n\r\nfrom  the Nanyang Siang Pau of the same day. I will\r\n\r\njust  give  the  translation which is  a  hit  more\r\n\r\nextensive:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`\"Colonialism cannot be ended [says Mr Lim] by\r\n\r\ndepending  on constitutional arrangement  from  the\r\n\r\ntop  to the bottom ... In our struggle it is stupid\r\n\r\nto  line  up  with pro-colonial forces....  Playing\r\n\r\nabout with constitutions is useless.\".'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I trust the Minister is not going to\r\n\r\nembark on a debate on that because that has nothing\r\n\r\nto  do  with  the motion. That is quite a  separate\r\n\r\nissue. The motion deals strictly with West Irian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to draw\r\n\r\nthe  lesson  that this motion put  forward  by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis wants to convey to the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   This  motion,  as   the   Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown says, has certain implications  for  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. I want to convey to you,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhat  the real implications of this motion are,  in\r\n\r\nso far as it relates to Singapore. Is it really\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the people to know that?  What  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis is trying\r\n\r\nto  do is to tell the people of Singapore that  the\r\n\r\nWest  Irian  lesson is simple - that if you  want  to\r\n\r\ncarry  forward the anti-colonial struggle,  do  not\r\n\r\nplay   about  with  the  constitutional   struggle.\r\n\r\n\"Constitutions  are  useless.\" The  implication  is\r\n\r\nquite clear, Sir. If you want to carry forward what\r\n\r\nthey  call  the anti-colonial struggle in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  in  the  Borneo territories,  obviously  other\r\n\r\nmeans are called for. It is very important that  we\r\n\r\nshould not allow this motion to be approved without\r\n\r\nour  making it quite clear that we are not  drawing\r\n\r\nthe  same  lesson from that motion as  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nleaders want the people of Singapore to draw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least it is quite clear to us, Sir, and it is\r\n\r\nsignificant to Singapore that some Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nmembers  are  growing weary of  the  constitutional\r\n\r\nstruggle.  Many of them may believe, as  Communists\r\n\r\ndo  believe, that power must eventually emerge from\r\n\r\nthe  barrel  of a gun. That may be the lesson  that\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis is drawing from the West Irian\r\n\r\nissue.  But our advice to them is that  this  is  a\r\n\r\nmost  disastrous lesson for them to draw.  Whatever\r\n\r\njustifications there may be for the Indonesians  to\r\n\r\nuse  force for the liberation of West Irian,  there\r\n\r\nis  none in Singapore or in Malaya or Malaysia.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  Sir,  in the course of the same speech,  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  made\r\n\r\nanother  equally significant observation   - I  quote\r\n\r\nagain  from the Straits Times of 8th January.  This\r\n\r\nis what he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"`We realise that the moment is coming...\"',\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>this is in connection with the West Irian rally,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`\"... the moment is coming when we too will receive\r\n\r\nthe  support and help of other peace-loving  people\r\n\r\nto free us from colonial domination,\"'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for many of us, the term \"peace-loving\r\n\r\npeople\" might have the obvious meaning. But  for  a\r\n\r\nCommunist cadre, the term \"peace-loving people\" has\r\n\r\na  specific  and precise meaning. If you  read  any\r\n\r\nCommunist document or publication, when they  refer\r\n\r\nto \"peace-loving people\", it is a term they use for\r\n\r\ncountries which are Communist. So if we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nread  it  not as people who are not well versed  in\r\n\r\nthe  Communist  jargon  but as  trained  Communists\r\n\r\nwould  read  it,  we realise that  \"the  moment  is\r\n\r\ncoming  when  we too will receive the  support  and\r\n\r\nhelp   of   other  peace-loving  people  of   other\r\n\r\nCommunist  countries  to  free  us  from   colonial\r\n\r\ndomination.\" These are the lessons, Sir, which  the\r\n\r\npro-Communist elements in the Barisan Sosialis want\r\n\r\nto  put across to their followers by using the West\r\n\r\nIrian issue as a cover -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Here is the man who  says  it\r\n\r\nis  useless.  And  in relation to West  Irian,  the\r\n\r\nlesson  is  quite  obvious.  The  other  statement,\r\n\r\n\"other   peace-loving  people,  other  peace-loving\r\n\r\ncountries which will come to our assistance.\" Whose\r\n\r\nassistance?  Therefore,  Sir,  though  we  are   in\r\n\r\nsupport of the motion, we must make it quite  clear\r\n\r\nthat  the lessons we draw from the West Irian issue\r\n\r\nare  not the lessons that the Barisan Sosialis  and\r\n\r\ntheir   mentors  want  to  put  across   to   their\r\n\r\nfollowers, to their cadres and their organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real lesson that we should draw from West\r\n\r\nIrian  for Singapore is not that constitutions  are\r\n\r\nuseless   but  that  it  is  impossible   for   the\r\n\r\nCommunists  to halt the unification of  territories\r\n\r\nwhich   the   retreating   colonial   powers    had\r\n\r\nadministered for so long as a coherent economic and\r\n\r\npolitical unit. Sir, political boundaries are  man-made,  though  the  making of them  may  follow  no\r\n\r\nprecise and accepted rules. They are established by\r\n\r\nmany   means;   by  settlement,  by  invasion,   by\r\n\r\nconquest,  by sale and transfer, and by many  other\r\n\r\nways.  In Asia the boundaries of many nation States\r\n\r\nare  those established by the colonial powers which\r\n\r\nexercised dominion over them. What we call India on\r\n\r\nBurma or Malaya\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor   Indonesia  are  comprised  within   boundaries\r\n\r\nlargely drawn up by the colonial powers that  ruled\r\n\r\nover  these  territories.  For  example,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nhistory  and  boundaries of Malaya or of  Indonesia\r\n\r\nwould have been different if these territories  had\r\n\r\ncome,  say, under the rule of the British or  under\r\n\r\nthe  rule  of  the Dutch. But because  the  British\r\n\r\nhappened to carve up Malaya, Singapore upwards: the\r\n\r\nDutch   starting  from  Sumatra  to   West   Irian;\r\n\r\ntherefore,   the  boundaries  of   what   we   call\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  and  what  we  call  Malaya  have  been\r\n\r\ndefined  for us by the colonial powers.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthough  boundaries  cannot  be  logically  defined,\r\n\r\nnobody can say why Malaya should comprise Singapore\r\n\r\nand the Federation, or why Malaysia should comprise\r\n\r\nMalaya,  Singapore and the Borneo  territories.  We\r\n\r\nstart  off by accepting that at any given time  the\r\n\r\nboundaries  of a State today are those  which  have\r\n\r\nbeen  established as States or colonies which  have\r\n\r\nbecome   independent  or  are   going   to   become\r\n\r\nindependent.  The boundaries are those  which  were\r\n\r\nthere  when  the  colonial power was  administering\r\n\r\nthese  countries as a single unit. Such a unit  may\r\n\r\nhave  embraced  a diversity of races and  cultures,\r\n\r\nbut   the   fact  that  the  colonial   power   had\r\n\r\nadministered  it  for decades or  centuries  as  an\r\n\r\nintegrated  unit  has encouraged  nationalists  who\r\n\r\nhave  taken over from the colonial power to  regard\r\n\r\nthe  colonial frontiers as the national  frontiers.\r\n\r\nThe   colonial   frontiers  become   the   national\r\n\r\nfrontiers. The evacuating colonial powers,  on  the\r\n\r\nother hand, when they were forced to, have given up\r\n\r\ndominion over a colonial territory and have gone in\r\n\r\nfor  dismemberment of their former empires into new\r\n\r\nand  often contending States. That has happened  in\r\n\r\nIndia, in Indo-China, in Indonesia and in Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such Balkanisation of former colonial territories\r\n\r\nwhen  they gained independence invariably  resulted\r\n\r\nin  the  emergence of weak and unstable States  and\r\n\r\ntherefore,   far   from  becoming  independent   by\r\n\r\ndismemberment, by Balkanisation, they  become  more\r\n\r\namenable to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontrol either by the evacuating colonial power  or\r\n\r\nby  any  other power which is stronger than any  of\r\n\r\nthe  individual  units which form part  of  a  more\r\n\r\nintegrated  territory.

Sir, as far as  the\r\n\r\nWest  Irian  issue is concerned,  they  are  a  bit\r\n\r\nuncomfortable because the Barisan Sosialis are  the\r\n\r\nDutchmen of Singapore and Malaya. The fact is  that\r\n\r\nthey  have brought up the motion on West Irian with\r\n\r\ntheir tongues in their cheeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

When  we  had\r\n\r\ntrouble  in  the community centres, the women  were\r\n\r\nout   to  fight.  Fortunately,  Sir,  we  took  the\r\n\r\nprecaution  of  sending  women  police.   But   the\r\n\r\nnationalists  have for this reason always  resisted\r\n\r\nBalkanisation and fragmentation of former  colonies\r\n\r\nby  the  colonial  powers on the pretext  of  self-determination for this or that ethnic, religious or\r\n\r\ncultural group, because once you accept that  every\r\n\r\nethnic,  cultural  or racial group  in  a  colonial\r\n\r\nterritory  should be asked its opinion,  should  be\r\n\r\nallowed self-determination first, then there is no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nend to it. We can start off with Singapore. Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai   probably  can  ask  for  self-determination\r\n\r\nbecause  they  say  that area is constituted  by  a\r\n\r\nparticular ethnic group, with particular religious,\r\n\r\ncultural  and  racial  affinities,  and  therefore,\r\n\r\nGeylang  Serai must be given autonomy.  The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Havelock  can  claim that Havelock  should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  autonomy  because  it  comprises  a  certain\r\n\r\nsection  of  clans  from China who  speak  slightly\r\n\r\ndifferent  dialects from those in the  neighbouring\r\n\r\nconstituency of Hong Lim, and so on.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nend  to  arguments that can be brought  forward  to\r\n\r\njustify  self-determination for this or that  group\r\n\r\nin  a  colonial  unit when, in fact,  the  colonial\r\n\r\npower  has administered that political unit as  one\r\n\r\nunit for hundreds of years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Dutch can, when they say that West Irian is\r\n\r\nsomething  separate. Of course, logically  you  can\r\n\r\nsay  so.  These people are different. But the  same\r\n\r\nargument  which  can  be  used  for  giving   self-determination to West Irian can also  be   used  for\r\n\r\nisolating  Celebes or Bali. But the  fact  is  that\r\n\r\nthey  do  not do so because in the case of  Celebes\r\n\r\nand  Bali, they were accepted as integral parts  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia simply because they had been administered\r\n\r\nas  parts  of Indonesia by the Dutch. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  Malaya, Singapore and the Borneo territories\r\n\r\nhave  not  been  regarded  as  parts  of  Indonesia\r\n\r\nbecause  they had been administered as  territorial\r\n\r\nunits of the British Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in unqualified support of the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  claim  that  West  Irian  is  part   of\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  the Barisan Sosialis are  conceding  to\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesians what they refuse  to  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nnationalists.

So  if  the  Member  can\r\n\r\nconfine himself to the motion, it would be better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will\r\n\r\nonly take a few lines and you can rest assured that\r\n\r\nthis is within the limits of the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The masses of Singapore and Malaya are very\r\n\r\nsympathetic towards the Indonesian revolution.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The West Irian fight is a part of the Indonesian\r\n\r\nrevolution. That is why I bring up the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`They will not want to do anything which will hurt\r\n\r\nthe  bonds  of  friendship of the two  peoples.  We\r\n\r\nbelieve,  through brotherly friendship  and  mutual\r\n\r\naid,  our  two  peoples will  triumph  against  the\r\n\r\ncommon  enemy  and achieve ultimately  a  just  and\r\n\r\nprosperous society.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, colonialism is dying out\r\n\r\nin  all  parts of the world.

We in the United People's Party  also\r\n\r\nmade a New Year announcement of our support of  the\r\n\r\nIndian   recovery  of  Goa  from   the   Portuguese\r\n\r\ncolonialists.

If the Dutch do not understand the history\r\n\r\nof  revolution, as they have not in the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nstruggle,   then   they   should   face   all   the\r\n\r\nconsequences. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we hope that\r\n\r\neveryone in this Assembly will support this  motion\r\n\r\nsincerely  and honestly because we believe  in  the\r\n\r\nanti-colonial movement, and we hope, as before  the\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  by-election,  when  the  cases  of   the\r\n\r\nAlgerian motion and the Lumumba motion were brought\r\n\r\nup  in  this Assembly, it will receive a  unanimous\r\n\r\nvote from this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the stupidity\r\n\r\nand  silliness of the P.A.P. logic was demonstrated\r\n\r\nby  none other than the Minister for Culture in his\r\n\r\nspeech  just  now.

It is a very simple fact.  In\r\n\r\nthe  case  of the claim of Indonesia, the Dutch  do\r\n\r\nnot  support the claim, whereas the P.A.P. type  of\r\n\r\nmerger is supported by the Colonial Office.

This fact  of  course  is  also\r\n\r\nconceded by the P.A.P. If Irian Barat is  part  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  how  is  it that the  Dutch  can  still\r\n\r\ncontrol  the  country  and  directly  exploit   its\r\n\r\nnatural  resources and the people? Sir, the obvious\r\n\r\nanswer  is that the Dutch are there by force.  They\r\n\r\nhave  occupied  the place by force  and  they  have\r\n\r\nmaintained  control by virtue of their armed  might\r\n\r\nbacked  to the hilt by N.A.T.O., including Britain,\r\n\r\nwhich supports the so-called liberation of Malaysia\r\n\r\nplan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even today the newspapers talk of Holland's\r\n\r\nradar-equipped Neptune air-craft,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nheavily armed aircraft-carriers and warships\r\n\r\nthat  are  stationed in West Irian.

The\r\n\r\nIndonesian  people have tolerated Dutch  occupation\r\n\r\nof  part of their territory for more than a  decade\r\n\r\nnow.  They  have  shown patience and  a  determined\r\n\r\neffort  to avoid the use of force in their  attempt\r\n\r\nto  liberate  their country. But this patience  has\r\n\r\nbeen  taken by the Dutch colonialists as a sign  of\r\n\r\nweakness. The patience displayed by the Indonesians\r\n\r\nis  only  matched by that of the Indian  people  in\r\n\r\ntheir  efforts  to  liberate Goa,  Damao  and  Diu.\r\n\r\nDespite   15  years  of  attempts  at  a   peaceful\r\n\r\nsettlement, the Portuguese had adamantly refused to\r\n\r\nsee   reason.   The   only  language   that   these\r\n\r\ncolonialists understand is force. Sir, the  Indians\r\n\r\nwere forced to use force.
