their\r\n\r\nnegative  impact on the Singapore economy; and (ii) introduce\r\n\r\nfurther measures to help the Singapore economy should  it  be\r\n\r\nbadly affected by the events.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I would like to\r\n\r\ntake Question Nos. 1 and 2 together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The recent terrorist attacks\r\n\r\nagainst  the  US are bound to impact the global economy.   It\r\n\r\nhas already caused significant disruptions to the US economy.\r\n\r\nThe  financial,  insurance and airline industries  are  badly\r\n\r\nhit,  although  the  interest rate cuts  by  the  US  Federal\r\n\r\nReserve  and the European Central Bank have helped to cushion\r\n\r\nthe shock to financial markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to this event, there were some indications that\r\n\r\nthe  US  economy  might be close to bottoming  out,  but  the\r\n\r\nSeptember  11 attacks have diminished markedly the  prospects\r\n\r\nof  an early recovery.  Consumer confidence and spending  are\r\n\r\nexpected to decline, increasing the risk of a US and a global\r\n\r\nrecession significantly.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore economy will be adversely affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the immediate impact of the attacks was\r\n\r\nfelt  by our financial markets.  The Straits Times Industrial\r\n\r\nIndex  fell by 7.3% while the Singapore dollar rose  by  1.1%\r\n\r\nagainst the US dollar on 12th September as investors sold off\r\n\r\nthe  US  dollar and stocks affected by the attacks.  Air  and\r\n\r\nsea  transport was held up temporarily when the US closed its\r\n\r\nairports  following the attack.  Our export-oriented  sectors\r\n\r\nlike  manufacturing, tourism and transport services will slow\r\n\r\nfurther as a result of weaker US demand in the short-term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is still fluid and will depend on how\r\n\r\nevents unfold in the coming months.  The chain of events  set\r\n\r\noff by the terrorist attacks has not yet fully played out, as\r\n\r\nthe  US  considers  its  response, and  as  terrorist  groups\r\n\r\nundoubtedly  plan  further moves.  But the events  last  week\r\n\r\nhave  already  changed  the world.   There  will  be  greater\r\n\r\nuncertainties,  and all economic forecasts will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nreviewed.  What is clear is that an economic recovery in  the\r\n\r\nshort term is unlikely.  At this point, we expect our overall\r\n\r\neconomic  growth this year to become negative.   Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmust therefore be prepared for a more prolonged downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last few months, the Government has been\r\n\r\nworking  on  a  second package of additional  measures  which\r\n\r\nmight  be  needed  to help ease the burden on  companies  and\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  The World Trade Centre attacks have  increased\r\n\r\nthe  urgency of the second package and the scale of  measures\r\n\r\nrequired.  We are still finalising the package.  The  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  will  address the question on  the  timing  of  the\r\n\r\npackage in his reply.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to ask the Minister a supplementary question  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  commenting  conceptually on  the  extent  of  pump\r\n\r\npriming   that   the  Government  would   consider   in   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nthink we are ready yet to announce the details of the package\r\n\r\nbut  conceptually  there  will be a  modest  amount  of  pump\r\n\r\npriming.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, may I ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  whether his Ministry has now revised  the  GDP\r\n\r\nforecast  for the whole year?

The markets are still volatile.  I think it\r\n\r\nis  too  early for us to be overly sure of what the  ultimate\r\n\r\nimpact  would be.  The war has not yet started.   We  do  not\r\n\r\nknow how long it will last and what all the consequences will\r\n\r\nbe.    We   are  on  the  pessimistic  side,  so  we   expect\r\n\r\nunemployment this year and next year to be worse than what we\r\n\r\nhad earlier projected.  As to how much worse, it is premature\r\n\r\nto say.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, as\r\n\r\nin  the  US, which has announced a bail-out package  for  its\r\n\r\nairline industry, would the Minister consider bailing out SIA\r\n\r\nshould  this become necessary, at least to save jobs  because\r\n\r\nSIA has announced plans to retrench some workers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> On the issue of insurance,\r\n\r\nGovernment has already taken a quick decision yesterday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On preserving jobs in the airline industry by Government\r\n\r\nsubsidy,  I think that would be a very bad principle.

There  is naturally an over-reaction  and  many\r\n\r\npeople  have reduced their travels.  Many meetings have  been\r\n\r\ncancelled  and this has had an immediate impact on  airlines,\r\n\r\nhotel  and  convention business.  The dust  will  settle  and\r\n\r\nthings  will assume a certain normality and we will  have  to\r\n\r\nanalyse  the  situation then and decide what our  appropriate\r\n\r\nresponses should be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>OFF-BUDGET MEASURES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Minister for Finance, in\r\n\r\nview  of  the deteriorating economy, when will the Government\r\n\r\nannounce and implement further off-Budget measures to  assist\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and local industries affected by  the  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, when the $2.2 billion off-Budget  package  was\r\n\r\nannounced  in  July  this year, we said that  the  Government\r\n\r\nwould  do  more to assist Singaporeans if the global economic\r\n\r\nsituation worsened in the coming months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the intervening months, leading indicators suggest\r\n\r\nthat  the economy has worsened further and it is likely  that\r\n\r\nthe  third quarter results will be substantially weaker.

Senior Minister visited\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur last year in August, with Prime Minister  Goh's\r\n\r\nagreement,  to  try  and  narrow  the  differences  over  the\r\n\r\noutstanding bilateral issues. Following discussions  with  Dr\r\n\r\nMahathir,  Senior Minister had written to Tun Daim  regarding\r\n\r\nSingapore's proposals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step came, in February this year, when\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Abdullah  Badawi  visited\r\n\r\nSingapore  and discussed with Prime Minister Goh the  package\r\n\r\nof  outstanding issues. At this meeting, Prime  Minister  Goh\r\n\r\nagreed  in-principle to Malaysia's request to move their  KTM\r\n\r\nrailway station from Tanjong Pagar to Kranji, and to have the\r\n\r\nKTM trains run in an underground tunnel from Johor to Kranji,\r\n\r\nas  part of the larger package of issues. They both agreed on\r\n\r\nthe  need to resolve these outstanding issues on the  package\r\n\r\nas soon as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah\r\n\r\nBadawi's  visit,  Senior Minister received a  reply  from  Dr\r\n\r\nMahathir  in  March  2001  regarding  Singapore's  proposals.\r\n\r\nMembers will recall that I told the House on 13th March  that\r\n\r\nour  preliminary study showed that there were  variations  on\r\n\r\nsome points between Dr Mahathir's reply and Senior Minister's\r\n\r\nunderstanding  with  Dr Mahathir during his  visit  to  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur last year. I added, however, that at first blush,  the\r\n\r\ndifference did not appear that great.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior Minister's recent visit to KL was a follow-up to Dr Mahathir's reply. After consulting Prime Minister\r\n\r\nGoh, Senior Minister visited KL again to continue discussions\r\n\r\non the package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the outcome of the most recent\r\n\r\ndiscussions  between  Senior Minister  and  Dr  Mahathir.  As\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister  has  made clear in his comprehensive  press\r\n\r\nconferences in KL, there is now accord on the basic  skeletal\r\n\r\nor framework agreement, which would form the basis to resolve\r\n\r\nthe outstanding issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This framework agreement, firstly, spells out the\r\n\r\nelements of the package; secondly, indicates the areas  where\r\n\r\nthere is agreement on both sides; and thirdly, sets out areas\r\n\r\nwhere further discussions are needed to close the gaps.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To recapitulate, the key elements of the broad agreement\r\n\r\nare  the long-term supply of water to Singapore beyond  2061,\r\n\r\nimplementation of the POA, the proposal for a new  bridge  to\r\n\r\nreplace  the existing Causeway, use of Malaysian airspace  by\r\n\r\nthe  RSAF  and  the  early withdrawal of CPF  funds  by  West\r\n\r\nMalaysians.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On water, for the period 2011 to 2061, Malaysia has\r\n\r\noffered  to provide Singapore with an additional 100  mgd  of\r\n\r\ntreated  water  to  replace the 1961 Water  Agreement,  which\r\n\r\nexpires  in 2011. While Singapore has agreed to the quantity,\r\n\r\nSingapore  has proposed that this continue to be provided  in\r\n\r\nraw form as Singapore has the necessary filtration capacity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 2061 to 2161, Malaysia has offered to provide\r\n\r\n350  mgd  of  water to Singapore - 100 mgd raw  and  250  mgd\r\n\r\ntreated water. Singapore has agreed to 350 mgd of water,  but\r\n\r\nhas  proposed  to draw 150 mgd of raw water and  200  mgd  of\r\n\r\ntreated water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the source, Singapore's position is that\r\n\r\nthe  source of additional water to be provided from 2011, and\r\n\r\nfrom  2061-2161  must  be the Johor River.  Furthermore,  the\r\n\r\nproduction of treated water to be supplied to Singapore after\r\n\r\n2061 will be done jointly between Singapore and Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the price of water, for the existing supply of\r\n\r\n350   mgd  of  raw  water  under  the  1961  and  1962  Water\r\n\r\nAgreements, Singapore has agreed to a revision of  the  price\r\n\r\nof  raw water purchased. Singapore has proposed to revise the\r\n\r\nprice from 3 sen to 45 sen per 1,000 gallons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the additional raw water to be supplied from 2011-2061, and from 2061-2161, Singapore has agreed to the price\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n60 sen per 1,000 gallons, to be reviewed every five years for\r\n\r\ninflation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan asked when will the price increase to\r\n\r\n45 sen commence, and whether it will significantly affect the\r\n\r\nretail  price of water in Singapore.  The answer to  that  is\r\n\r\nthe  proposed  price increase will commence only  after  full\r\n\r\nagreement  on  the package has been finalised with  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nand  only  after  it is signed by both Prime Ministers.   The\r\n\r\nincrease  from  3  sen to 45 sen is, of course,  significant.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  retail  price  of water  also  includes  other\r\n\r\ncomponents,   including   manpower   costs,   treatment   and\r\n\r\ndistribution   costs,   and  the  Water   Conservation   Tax.\r\n\r\nTherefore, any increase in the overall retail price of water,\r\n\r\narising from the higher raw water price paid to Johor, should\r\n\r\nbe manageable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the POA, let me first stress that the new agreement\r\n\r\nwill  not supersede the 1990 Points of Agreement, unless they\r\n\r\nare   explicitly  varied  as  part  of  the   wider   package\r\n\r\nnegotiations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned earlier, Singapore agreed for the\r\n\r\nKTM  station  to be relocated from Tanjong Pagar  to  Kranji,\r\n\r\nwith  the  KTM trains running in an underground  tunnel  from\r\n\r\nJohor  to the Kranji railway station.  Malaysia will pay  for\r\n\r\nthe cost of building the underground tunnel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rail Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ)\r\n\r\nfacilities  will  move from its current  location  to  Kranji\r\n\r\nfollowing  the completion of the railway tunnel. Pending  the\r\n\r\nshift  to  Kranji,  we  have proposed that  the  KTM  railway\r\n\r\nstation will be located temporarily at Woodlands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plot of land at Tanjong Pagar currently occupied by\r\n\r\nKTM will be exchanged for a plot at Shenton Way of equivalent\r\n\r\nvalue for joint development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Singapore has agreed to variations of the\r\n\r\nPOA  to  include  12  lots at Bukit Timah together  with  the\r\n\r\noriginal three land parcels to be jointly developed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the causeway and the bridge, Singapore has agreed to\r\n\r\nMalaysia's proposal for a bridge to be built between\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaysia.  However, Singapore proposed that the\r\n\r\ndemolition of the causeway take place after 2007,  when  both\r\n\r\nthe  bridge  and the tunnel have been completed and  provided\r\n\r\nthe  tolls  charged at the bridge do not exceed  the  present\r\n\r\ntoll rates at the causeway adjusted for inflation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will reclaim its side to the maximum and build\r\n\r\nits  side  of  the bridge to meet the Malaysian side  at  the\r\n\r\nboundary.   Singapore's toll rates at the bridge  will  match\r\n\r\nthat of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards airspace, Malaysia will reinstate all the\r\n\r\narrangements  and  understandings for RSAF  aircraft  to  use\r\n\r\nMalaysia's  airspace (including the South China Sea  Training\r\n\r\nAreas) for transit and training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards CPF, Singapore will allow the early\r\n\r\nwithdrawal, on an individual basis phased over two years,  of\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  monies  of West Malaysians who have left  Singapore\r\n\r\npermanently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as Members can see, there has been progress.\r\n\r\nHowever,  many  details still have to be sorted  out  by  the\r\n\r\nofficials of both countries to be put in a form of words into\r\n\r\nan Agreement which the respective Prime Ministers can agree.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress two important points. Firstly, all the\r\n\r\nitems  are  to be considered as part of a package.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nthe  skeletal  or framework agreement has to be completed  by\r\n\r\nsettling the details that remain to be resolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ang Mo Kio has asked whether Singapore\r\n\r\nhad  received  a  fair deal from the broad agreement  reached\r\n\r\nbetween  Senior Minister and Dr Mahathir.  This question  has\r\n\r\nalso  been  raised in the media.  Senior Minister  had  dealt\r\n\r\nwith  this  issue during his press conference in  KL,  but  I\r\n\r\nshall also touch on it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first say, Sir, that, in the nature of\r\n\r\ninternational  negotiations,  the  broad  agreement   reached\r\n\r\nbetween Singapore and Malaysia was a compromise made by  both\r\n\r\nsides  to  move  the long-standing bilateral issues  forward.\r\n\r\nHaving been\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsubjects  of  contention  for  so  long,  the  deal  marks  a\r\n\r\npsychological breakthrough in our bilateral negotiations.  It\r\n\r\nshows  that despite sporadic problems in our relations,  both\r\n\r\ncountries recognise the value of cooperation and each country\r\n\r\nhas  a  stake in the other's stability and growth.  I believe\r\n\r\nthis will place relations on a surer footing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viewed in that context, Singapore has decided to try to\r\n\r\nreach an agreement with Malaysia.  Some of the items are  not\r\n\r\nbalanced  in  our favour like reducing our water request  for\r\n\r\nsome  750  mgd  to  350  mgd without  any  reduction  of  the\r\n\r\nconcessions we are making.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key question Singaporeans should ask ourselves is\r\n\r\nthis:  Are  we better off concluding a deal, or  by  allowing\r\n\r\nsuch  outstanding issues to fester?  I think both  sides  are\r\n\r\nbetter  off with the outstanding issues resolved.  We decided\r\n\r\nit was best to have a deal with Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have decided to reach a deal with Malaysia, let\r\n\r\nme  assure  Members that we will continue with our plans  for\r\n\r\ndesalination,  as  well  as  water  reclamation  to   produce\r\n\r\nNEWater,  a process which involves micro-filtration  followed\r\n\r\nby  Reverse  Osmosis  based on membrane technology.   We  can\r\n\r\nexpect  advancements in membrane technology  to  continue  to\r\n\r\nreduce the costs of these two alternative sources of water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this package will put behind us the outstanding\r\n\r\nissues  and  it can have positive effects for both  Singapore\r\n\r\nand Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have\r\n\r\nthree supplementary questions.  The first question is on  the\r\n\r\nissue  of CPF withdrawal.  Is this a total withdrawal  by  an\r\n\r\nindividual, or is it going to be transferred to the Malaysian\r\n\r\nEPF?    And  related  to  that,  would  not  this  create   a\r\n\r\ndisadvantage or unfair situation for Singaporeans who  cannot\r\n\r\nwithdraw their CPF until retirement?  What would be the rules\r\n\r\nthat would not create this disadvantaged position for us?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is on the 12 new plots of land that\r\n\r\nhave been released in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nplace  of  the relocation of the railway.  Does the  Minister\r\n\r\nhave the current market value of the 12 pieces of land?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is, while we have got the broad\r\n\r\nstrokes of agreement, when do we expect the agreement  to  be\r\n\r\nfinally  concluded, as we know the POA was something that  we\r\n\r\nthought would have been implemented, but was not implemented?\r\n\r\nWill  this  be  another example of something  that  has  been\r\n\r\ndiscussed, but not implementable?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I thank Mr Inderjit Singh for his\r\n\r\nquestions.   The first question concerns CPF, and the  answer\r\n\r\nto the question is that it is a withdrawal by individuals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it will put Singaporeans at a disadvantage, let\r\n\r\nme say that, as I mentioned in my main answer, the withdrawal\r\n\r\nis for Malaysians who were working here and who have returned\r\n\r\nto  Malaysia  permanently.  So that  would  be  an  important\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question whether I have with me the current\r\n\r\nmarket  value of the 12 plots at Bukit Timah, I do  not  have\r\n\r\nthat particular detail with me.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question was, with regard to a general point,\r\n\r\nwhether  we  expect  any  new  agreement  to  be  implemented\r\n\r\nconsidering our experience with the POA.  Let me say that, as\r\n\r\nwith  any international negotiation with any country, we must\r\n\r\napproach the deal in good faith that both sides will keep  to\r\n\r\nthe  terms of the agreement when we do settle the details and\r\n\r\nfinalise the agreement, and it is signed.  The items  in  the\r\n\r\nbilateral  package would have to form part of a  new  written\r\n\r\nagreement which has to be formally concluded between the  two\r\n\r\ncountries.   And  the  two countries  would  be  bound  under\r\n\r\ninternational law to comply with the terms of the  agreement.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would not want to speculate on a situation where\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysians choose not to abide by the terms, and so  on.\r\n\r\nLet me also point out something which both the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand I have mentioned on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  previous occasion when a similar question was raised  and,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  as  these agreements are major agreements  between\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and Singapore, both the Prime Minister and  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid  that  it  is  the  intention that  we  should  come  to\r\n\r\nParliament and place the agreements before the House after it\r\n\r\nhas been signed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister\r\n\r\nis  there  a  specific timeframe within  which  the  detailed\r\n\r\nnegotiations are targeted to be concluded for the  agreements\r\n\r\nto  be signed?  I ask this because experience has shown  that\r\n\r\nour  negotiations  on  these matters  have  taken  unexpected\r\n\r\ntwists and turns leading to long delays.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I wish I could answer Mr Iswaran by\r\n\r\ngiving a clear date when it is expected to be concluded.  But\r\n\r\nI  am unable to do so for the reason that there are very many\r\n\r\ndetails  on important matters to be sorted out.  What  I  can\r\n\r\nsay  is that, certainly on our side and also on the Malaysian\r\n\r\nside,  the  desire  is to resolve this as  soon  as  possible\r\n\r\nbecause we really have to put this behind us.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I have two\r\n\r\nsupplementary  questions.  The first concerns  the  price  of\r\n\r\nwater.   The Minister, in his main answer, has said that  any\r\n\r\nprice  increase in retail water, arising from  the  agreement\r\n\r\nwould  be manageable.  I would like to know from the Minister\r\n\r\nwhat  does he mean by \"manageable\".  How much would he expect\r\n\r\nthe  retail price of water to increase and has the Government\r\n\r\nstudied  the impact before agreeing to pay Malaysian  45  sen\r\n\r\nper  1,000  gallons  of raw water?  The second  question  is:\r\n\r\nunder  what  consideration did the Government  agree  to  the\r\n\r\nadditional 12 plots of land in Bukit Timah for Malaysia?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I do not have with me the\r\n\r\ndetails.  My Ministry does not deal with the details of water\r\n\r\nprice  by PUB.  All I am able to say, at this stage, for  the\r\n\r\nreasons  I  have given, is that whatever price  increase  may\r\n\r\ntake place, it will be manageable.  The details will be given\r\n\r\nto  this  House at a later stage.  When we agreed to  various\r\n\r\nincreases, and when we put forward certain proposals, have we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmade  our calculations?  I think the House must expect  that,\r\n\r\nyes,  we  do not put forward proposals lightly.  We  have  to\r\n\r\ntake  into account what advances our interests, what  we  can\r\n\r\nmanage, and we will not put forward a proposal - particularly\r\n\r\non  the  price  of water - that we are unable to  justify  to\r\n\r\nourselves.  So, our national interests are always at the back\r\n\r\nof our mind in such international negotiations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the KTM lands, let me say that this is really not\r\n\r\na new issue.  If Members cast their minds back to 1997, Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  spoke to this House on the difficulties  about  the\r\n\r\nPOA  and  his approach to solving the problems with  Malaysia\r\n\r\nwithin  the context of a framework of wider cooperation.   He\r\n\r\nalready  mentioned  that if there is  a  framework  of  wider\r\n\r\ncooperation  and there can be a resolution of  a  package  of\r\n\r\nitems, he is prepared \"notwithstanding the terms of the  POA,\r\n\r\nto  agree  to the joint development of the KTM land in  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah,  in  addition  to  the agreed three  parcels  of  land\r\n\r\nreferred  to  in the POA.\"  In other words, as  part  of  the\r\n\r\noverall  package  deal - we are not under  an  obligation  to\r\n\r\ninclude  the additional land in Bukit Timah - but if we  want\r\n\r\nto  advance  the  process and to solve  the  package,  he  is\r\n\r\nprepared  to consider this as part of the package deal.   And\r\n\r\nthat is the approach we have taken.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nput  on  record  that the Opposition is very  happy  that  an\r\n\r\nagreement has been reached between Singapore and Malaysia  on\r\n\r\nthe  outstanding  issues.  This is a great  progress  in  the\r\n\r\nrelationship  between Singapore and Malaysia.   I  hope  that\r\n\r\nbefore  we  finally  sign the agreement,  that  there  is  an\r\n\r\nassurance  from  Malaysia  that Malaysia  shall  continue  to\r\n\r\nsupply raw water to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not asking a question.

The whole package has evolved.  At one time, it\r\n\r\nwas  electric train (fast train) - POA-water.  It evolved  to\r\n\r\nwater-and-loan.   Then it evolved to POA-water-bridge-tunnel.\r\n\r\nI  think we have taken it as far as we can to this point.  It\r\n\r\nis in our interest to try to wrap it up as early as possible.\r\n\r\nThe  Senior  Minister explained in his press  conference  why\r\n\r\nthat  is  so.   Both  countries face various  challenges  and\r\n\r\nproblems.  The region also faces problems.  So, as we  tackle\r\n\r\nthese problems, let us not be bedevilled by these outstanding\r\n\r\nproblems.  And when the Senior Minister said that,  that  was\r\n\r\nbefore  11th September.  You have heard Minister  George  Yeo\r\n\r\nand Minister for Finance talking about how the global economy\r\n\r\nand  the  region  may  be affected by  the  recent  terrorist\r\n\r\nattacks.   So  both  countries and the region  face  enormous\r\n\r\nchallenges and therefore it is good for both countries to try\r\n\r\nto put these behind us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will there be more surprises and twists and turns? I\r\n\r\ncannot  guarantee that but, certainly, I hope  that,  and  am\r\n\r\nsure,  all Members of the House share my hope that  will  not\r\n\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, my question is about the\r\n\r\neffective date of the new water price.

But\r\n\r\nwould  it  not  be  possible to actually  ask  that  the  old\r\n\r\nagreement, which has the old price of about 3 sen, be allowed\r\n\r\nto run its full\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nterm, before the new price is implemented at a later date?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> If I understand Mr Leong Horn Kee,\r\n\r\nwhat he is saying is that the new price should only apply  to\r\n\r\nthe  extension of agreements after 2011 and after  2061,  and\r\n\r\nthat the existing price be untouched.  We did assessments and\r\n\r\nin  the negotiations, it was considered that this proposal to\r\n\r\nadjust  the  existing price - which is not a legal obligation\r\n\r\non  our side - was a factor to advance the negotiations.   So\r\n\r\nwe  may  not be able to make any advance if that package  did\r\n\r\nnot have that element.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister about the issue of the CIQ.  I remember  a  few\r\n\r\nyears ago we debated on this and many Singaporeans were quite\r\n\r\nemotional  about locating the CIQ within Singapore,  being  a\r\n\r\nsovereign issue for us.  Is there a plan in the agreement  to\r\n\r\nfinally  locate  the CIQ back to Malaysian soil  rather  than\r\n\r\nkeeping it in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> If we look back at the CIQ issue - what was the key issue in the CIQ? The key issue was that\r\n\r\nwherever  the  CIQ is located, where sovereign functions  are\r\n\r\nbeing  performed - such as immigration and customs - it  must\r\n\r\nbe  with the consent of Singapore.  That was the key issue on\r\n\r\nthe  controversy.   As  events developed  and  there  was  an\r\n\r\nexchange  of  letters, it was not controverted by Malaysians.\r\n\r\nIf  the  CIQ  was  located here, it is with  the  consent  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   If that basic issue is not challenged,  then  we\r\n\r\ncan  discuss where else the CIQ can be located.  But that  is\r\n\r\nthe key principle.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, there is speculation outside\r\n\r\nthis  House  as  to  why the Senior Minister  was  tasked  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate  this agreement with Malaysia instead of the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  Would the Minister like to explain that?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I thought that the Senior Minister had\r\n\r\nanswered  this question quite comprehensively  in  the  press\r\n\r\nconference.

He explained this fully in  the  press\r\n\r\nconference.  There ought not to be any speculation.  One more\r\n\r\npoint - the Senior Minister, in all the negotiations, made it\r\n\r\nclear  that  the  agreements and discussions that  had  taken\r\n\r\nplace  will,  of course, be subject to the agreement  of  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE EXCHANGE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Suspension of trading of Links shares)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister, in\r\n\r\nthe  light  of  the  recent disquiet over the  suspension  of\r\n\r\ntrading  of  certain  shares, what steps  will  be  taken  to\r\n\r\nreassure  the  investing public that the  Singapore  Exchange\r\n\r\nwill  adequately  explain  (i)  the  circumstances  for   any\r\n\r\nsuspension  of  the trading of shares; (ii) the justification\r\n\r\nfor  the  period of suspension, if resumption is not  readily\r\n\r\ncontemplated; and (iii) how it attempts to treat all affected\r\n\r\nshareholders fairly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister if\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Exchange rules need to be reviewed to make  it\r\n\r\nmore equitable in the light of the Links Island case.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, with your permission, I will take Question Nos.\r\n\r\n7 and 8 together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Trading in the shares of a company\r\n\r\nlisted  on  the Singapore Exchange (SGX) may be suspended  at\r\n\r\nthe request of the company or of the exchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A company may request that trading in its shares be\r\n\r\ntemporarily suspended before announcing material information,\r\n\r\nto  give time for the information to be disseminated  to  the\r\n\r\ninvesting public.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SGX may suspend trading in the shares of a particular\r\n\r\ncompany  where  it  is likely that trading of  the  company's\r\n\r\nshares  will  not  be conducted in a fair or orderly  manner.\r\n\r\nThis  may  occur,  for instance, where  a  company  fails  to\r\n\r\ndisclose   or   ensure  proper  dissemination   of   material\r\n\r\ninformation  to  the  investing public.   Alternatively,  the\r\n\r\ncompany's shares could be the subject of market manipulation.\r\n\r\nSGX's  power  to suspend trading is necessary to protect  the\r\n\r\nintegrity   of  the  marketplace  and  safeguard   investors'\r\n\r\ninterests.   All major international exchanges operate  under\r\n\r\nsimilar rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SGX suspended trading in Links shares on 16th August\r\n\r\n2000,  after  the exchange's preliminary review  showed  that\r\n\r\ntrading in these shares had been irregular during the  period\r\n\r\nleading up to 16th August 2000.  On the same day, SGX  issued\r\n\r\na   public  announcement,  stating  that  it  was  conducting\r\n\r\ninquiries into whether a corner situation had arisen  in  the\r\n\r\ncounter.   SGX  also stated that the exchange  considered  it\r\n\r\nappropriate  to impose a trading suspension in  view  of  the\r\n\r\nirregular  market in Links shares and pending the outcome  of\r\n\r\nthe inquiries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once imposed, any trading suspension should be as short\r\n\r\nas  possible  in order not to deprive market participants  of\r\n\r\nliquidity.  But whether trading should be allowed  to  resume\r\n\r\ndepends  on  whether the concerns that led to the  suspension\r\n\r\nbeing  imposed  in  the first instance have  been  addressed,\r\n\r\nthereby allowing an informed and orderly market to prevail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Links, it was only after a thorough\r\n\r\ninvestigation lasting nearly one year that SGX  was  able  to\r\n\r\nconclude,  on  26th  July 2001, that a corner  situation  had\r\n\r\narisen  in  Links  shares in the period  leading  up  to  the\r\n\r\ntrading suspension.  As mentioned in SGX's press statement of\r\n\r\n26th July 2001, the investigation was complicated by the need\r\n\r\nto   examine  the  trades  of  more  than  50  parties,   the\r\n\r\nsignificance  of  the  commercial and personal  relationships\r\n\r\namong  them, and the cash flows and trading patterns  of  the\r\n\r\nindividuals and institutions that traded in Links shares.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If SGX had allowed trading to resume before establishing\r\n\r\nwhether  Links  shares were cornered, it could  have  further\r\n\r\nexposed investors to an irregular market in those shares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In retrospect, given the duration of the inquiries, the\r\n\r\nexchange could have updated the investing public periodically\r\n\r\nthat the investigation was still ongoing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having established that a corner situation had arisen in\r\n\r\nLinks  shares, SGX decided that all outstanding market trades\r\n\r\nin Links shares transacted during 14th to 16th August 2000 be\r\n\r\nsettled  by  way  of cash instead of delivery,  at  the  fair\r\n\r\nsettlement  price  of  $1.21.  The fair settlement  price  is\r\n\r\nintended  to  settle all outstanding market trades  in  Links\r\n\r\nshares  done during the 3-day period in a manner that  would,\r\n\r\non  balance,  be  most  equitable to  all  parties  to  those\r\n\r\ntransactions.  This is not an easy task.  To be fair  to  all\r\n\r\npersons  who traded in Links shares during those three  days,\r\n\r\nthe  settlement  procedure had to treat all contracts  alike,\r\n\r\nregardless of whether they were done by investors  with  long\r\n\r\nor   short   positions.   After  considering  the  particular\r\n\r\ncircumstances   of   this  case,  the  Settlement   Committee\r\n\r\ndetermined that the weighted average price of Links shares on\r\n\r\n14th, 15th and 16th August 2000 would be the most appropriate\r\n\r\nfair settlement price.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various alternatives for dealing with the outstanding\r\n\r\ntransactions  in Links shares have been suggested.   SGX  has\r\n\r\nconsidered these proposals, and found them no better or  more\r\n\r\nequitable than SGX's decision.  MAS concurs with SGX.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, one suggestion was to allow those sellers\r\n\r\nwho  hold Links shares to settle by delivery instead of cash,\r\n\r\nand  apply  the  fair  settlement  procedure  only  to  short\r\n\r\nsellers.  However, under this alternative, CDP would  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to  treat  all buyers equally.  The  CDP  acts  as  the\r\n\r\ncentral counterparty to both sellers and buyers in all market\r\n\r\ntrades.   If  a  seller elects to deliver Links shares  under\r\n\r\nthis proposal, CDP would have to deliver those shares to  the\r\n\r\nbuyers who contracted to buy those same shares.  On the other\r\n\r\nhand, if a buyer has contracted to buy\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nLinks  shares  from a short seller, the buyer would  have  to\r\n\r\ncontend  with  cash settlement at the fair settlement  price,\r\n\r\neven  if  he  may  have preferred receiving Links  shares  in\r\n\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another proposal was to lift the trading suspension on\r\n\r\nLinks   temporarily  so  that  investors  could  unwind   any\r\n\r\noutstanding   positions  they  may  hold  in  Links   shares.\r\n\r\nProponents  of  this alternative point to SGX's reinstatement\r\n\r\nof  trading in Malaysian stocks on CLOB International for two\r\n\r\nweeks  after  the initial trading suspension,  which  allowed\r\n\r\ninvestors  to square their positions before trading  on  CLOB\r\n\r\nInternational was ceased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current situation is different. In the CLOB\r\n\r\nInternational case, the trading of Malaysian stocks continued\r\n\r\non  the KLSE and there was no suspicion of a false market  in\r\n\r\nthose  stocks.   But in the Links case, the company's  shares\r\n\r\nhad been cornered, and there could have been no assurance  of\r\n\r\na fair and orderly market in those shares if trading had been\r\n\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commercial Affairs Department is currently\r\n\r\ninvestigating whether criminal offences had been committed in\r\n\r\nrelation  to trading in Links shares.  If any of the  persons\r\n\r\nunder  investigation is convicted, he will be liable  to  pay\r\n\r\ncompensation to those aggrieved investors in Links who traded\r\n\r\nwith  him.   The  affected  investors  can  seek  such  legal\r\n\r\nrecourse any time within six years of an offence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This criminal prosecution regime will be complemented by\r\n\r\na  civil  penalty  and civil claim regime when  the  proposed\r\n\r\nSecurities and Futures Act (SFA) comes into force.   MAS  can\r\n\r\nalready  institute an action for civil penalties in  relation\r\n\r\nto  insider trading.  This will be extended under the new Act\r\n\r\nto  other  forms of market misconduct such as market rigging,\r\n\r\nthe employment of fraud or deceit in trading, and failure  to\r\n\r\nmake continuous disclosure of material information.  Further,\r\n\r\nthe  offender  will be liable for civil damages to  investors\r\n\r\nwho  suffer losses as a result of the market abuse.   Instead\r\n\r\nof having to institute their own legal action, aggrieved\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninvestors  can  file within six years of the offence,  claims\r\n\r\nfor  compensation with the Court on the strength of  criminal\r\n\r\nconvictions or civil penalties imposed by MAS.  Under the new\r\n\r\nregime,  MAS  will also have enhanced enforcement  powers  in\r\n\r\ninvestigating suspected offences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors should analyse information and understand the\r\n\r\nfundamentals  before they invest.   Investors who  intend  to\r\n\r\ntrade  heavily in a counter which has doubled or  tripled  in\r\n\r\nprice  within a short period of time for no apparent  reason,\r\n\r\nshould  recognise the risks involved and consider whether  it\r\n\r\nis  within  their means and risk appetite to do  so.   Market\r\n\r\nintermediaries who extended credit to such investors must  be\r\n\r\nprepared for the consequences if the counter is suspended and\r\n\r\nlater declared cornered.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  DPM  whether the new Securities and Futures Act will  be\r\n\r\nmade retroactive in the Links case.

Depending on a country's degree of\r\n\r\neconomic self-sufficiency, reserves at these levels should be\r\n\r\nsufficient  to  support  a  temporary  dislocation   in   the\r\n\r\ncountry's economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Singapore, with its high dependency on\r\n\r\nimports, our level of reserves should clearly be in the upper\r\n\r\nbound  of  the  three  to  six months'  range  and  more,  if\r\n\r\npossible.   Our current official foreign reserves  of  around\r\n\r\nUS$75 billion is equivalent to about seven months of imports.\r\n\r\nHowever,  as  a  country without natural resources,  our  aim\r\n\r\nshould  be to accumulate, over time, as much reserves  as  we\r\n\r\ncan  afford  to  do  so without over-taxing  our  people  and\r\n\r\nwithout  denying  ourselves  the expenditures  necessary  for\r\n\r\neconomic  growth.  Over the years, Mr Chiam will have  noted,\r\n\r\nGovernment has lowered personal, corporate and property taxes\r\n\r\nsubstantially  in  order to stimulate growth.

External\r\n\r\nconsultants  can bring knowledge of best practices  from  all\r\n\r\nover the world.  In some cases, such as the liberalisation of\r\n\r\nthe   telecommunications  and  power   industries,   external\r\n\r\nconsultants  have  acquired considerable  proprietary  expert\r\n\r\nknowledge,  gained from having worked on similar projects  in\r\n\r\nother  countries.

Government agencies\r\n\r\nmake  no  distinction  between local or foreign  consultants.\r\n\r\nConsultancy contracts are awarded to the vendor who  is  best\r\n\r\nqualified to do the job and offers the best value for  money,\r\n\r\nusually  through an open tender.

In\r\n\r\nSingapore,  when we engage consultants or when we  spend  any\r\n\r\nGovernment  money, it is a very careful decision.  There  are\r\n\r\ntender procedures which have to be followed.  We must satisfy\r\n\r\nourselves that this is money spent on a good purpose which is\r\n\r\nworthwhile   doing  and  furthermore,  that  the   price   is\r\n\r\nreasonable.   There  are procedures for approving  all  these\r\n\r\nGovernment expenditures.  If it is going to be very large  or\r\n\r\nlikely  to  be contentious, the Cabinet is aware of  it,  and\r\n\r\nthere  have not been cases where the Cabinet has argued  over\r\n\r\nwhether it is worth spending the money.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can the Minister tell us whether or\r\n\r\nnot they have paid consultants up to $1.5 million at a time?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I do not have an off-hand answer,\r\n\r\nbut  I  would  not  be surprised if we have  had  consultancy\r\n\r\nprojects  which are worth more than that.

The  public should  not  associate  the\r\n\r\nownership of a building with a bank's financial strength.   A\r\n\r\nbank's  strength lies in the size and quality of its  overall\r\n\r\noperations.

I\r\n\r\nthink  it all depends on the party that is holding the rally.\r\n\r\nIf  they have interesting speakers and they are able to  hold\r\n\r\nthe  participants' interest, there could be a high  interest.\r\n\r\nIt is the intrinsic nature of political rallies.  Like I have\r\n\r\nsaid,  it  is the nature of the speeches being made  and  the\r\n\r\nfact  that the audience can be a mixed audience  -  some  are\r\n\r\nsupporting you, some are not.  So I think it is better to  be\r\n\r\nsafe than sorry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, would the Police impose the\r\n\r\nsame  condition  of requiring CISCO guards during  elections?\r\n\r\nSecondly,  why  is  the  Police or  the  Government  treating\r\n\r\npolitical  parties  the   same  as  any  other  organisation?\r\n\r\nBasically,  political  parties hold  rallies  to  disseminate\r\n\r\ncertain  information  and  to institute  public  debate.   By\r\n\r\nimposing  the  condition of requiring  the  hiring  of  CISCO\r\n\r\nguards,  does  the Minister of State not think that  it  will\r\n\r\nrestrict   the  ability  of  political  parties  to  organise\r\n\r\nrallies,  given  the fact that it costs a  lot  of  money  to\r\n\r\nemploy CISCO guards?  Is this one way to restrict and curtail\r\n\r\nthe  ability  of  the  Opposition in having  activities  like\r\n\r\nrallies and dissemination of information?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, first of all, the general\r\n\r\nelection  (GE)  is  a national event.  So  political  rallies\r\n\r\nduring GE do not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrequire the hiring of CISCO guards.  The Police takes  charge\r\n\r\nof that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that Police takes a professional\r\n\r\nattitude towards all these events, whether it is organised by\r\n\r\nany political party or by any other organisers where there is\r\n\r\npotential  law  and  order problem.   It  is  a  professional\r\n\r\njudgment that must be made because, ultimately, law and order\r\n\r\nmust  be  maintained.  Like I have said, in  particular,  for\r\n\r\npolitical  rallies,  given the nature  of  the  topics  being\r\n\r\nraised  and  the  mixed crowd involved,  Police  professional\r\n\r\njudgment is that there is potential for law and order problem\r\n\r\nand  hence the need for CISCO guards.  Like I have said, this\r\n\r\nis  not  just for political rallies but also for other events\r\n\r\nas  well.  For the Singapore International Marathon  and  the\r\n\r\nrecent  football  international match between  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nLiverpool, Police made the same judgment.  This is not to say\r\n\r\nthat  we  are trying to prevent the Opposition from  reaching\r\n\r\nout  to their supporters and Singaporeans, because there  are\r\n\r\nmany  other ways of doing it.  And indeed Opposition  parties\r\n\r\nare doing it through various means  -  Internet, publications\r\n\r\nand  so  forth.    To  require  political  parties,  in  this\r\n\r\ncontext,  the  SDP, to pay about $3,400 for 13 CISCO  guards,\r\n\r\nwhich  works  out  to about $65 per hour per  officer  is,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  not  asking too much.  I am sure any  organiser  will\r\n\r\nwant to avert any problems, because that will also reflect on\r\n\r\nthe organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BUKIT PANJANG LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Service disruptions and accidents)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Communications\r\n\r\nand Information Technology (a) why is the Bukit Panjang Light\r\n\r\nRail  Transit still encountering frequent service disruptions\r\n\r\nand  accidents despite 20 months of rectification works since\r\n\r\nits  opening; and (b) what are the measures taken  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthe safety and convenience of LRT commuters.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology (Dr John Chen Seow Phun) (for the Minister for Communications and Information Technology):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the launch of\r\n\r\nthe   Bukit   Panjang  LRT  system  on  6th  November   1999,\r\n\r\nimprovements have been made to the hardware and  software  of\r\n\r\nthe  system  to improve service availability.  The  operator,\r\n\r\nSLRT,  has  also  continued  to improve  its  operations  and\r\n\r\nmaintenance  procedures and processes over this period.   The\r\n\r\nnumber  of  service disruptions lasting more than 20  minutes\r\n\r\nreduced  sharply  from  35  in  the  first  eight  months  of\r\n\r\noperation to 7 in the following six months. This year, up  to\r\n\r\nnow, 6 such service disruptions have occurred; unfortunately,\r\n\r\nthe  last 2 occurred within seven days of each other, on 29th\r\n\r\nAugust   and  6th  September.   The  second  disruption   was\r\n\r\nconsequential to the first.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system has, on the whole, stabilised, and the\r\n\r\nservice  availability target of 99.7%,  which  translates  to\r\n\r\nservice  disruption of not more than 4 minutes over a 20-hour\r\n\r\ndaily operation, has been achieved on most days over the past\r\n\r\n12 months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA has completed its investigations into the cause of\r\n\r\nthe service disruption on 29th August and 6th September.  The\r\n\r\ndisruption  on  29th  August was due  to  a  minor  technical\r\n\r\nproblem.   A  permanent solution to prevent a recurrence  has\r\n\r\nbeen  installed.   However, LTA is of the  opinion  that  the\r\n\r\ndisruption  on 6th September was a result of shortcomings  in\r\n\r\nthe repair work carried out by the operator to rectify damage\r\n\r\nsustained  during the 29th August incident.  LTA  intends  to\r\n\r\nimpose  a  penalty  on  SLRT for the  6th  September  service\r\n\r\ndisruption.\r\n\r\n.     The frequency of the recent service disruptions is  not\r\n\r\nacceptable.   The  LRT  operator  is  required  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nstandards  for  service  quality,  safety,  maintenance   and\r\n\r\noperation  prescribed  by LTA in its  Licence  and  Operating\r\n\r\nAgreement.  Penalties are imposed when the operator fails  to\r\n\r\nmeet a standard.  I have asked LTA to review and tighten  the\r\n\r\npenalty framework in order to spur the operator to devise the\r\n\r\nnecessary  preventive and corrective maintenance  regimes  to\r\n\r\navoid\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsevere  delays.

What is the  redress\r\n\r\navailable   to   LRT   commuters  who  have   suffered   much\r\n\r\ninconvenience  and financial loss?

So this is of  world-class standards.  The safety and reliability aspects are  all\r\n\r\nbenchmarked  against world standards.  As for the time-frame,\r\n\r\nLRT  has been improving since it begins operation.  It is not\r\n\r\nunusual   for   train   operations  to  experience   problems\r\n\r\ninitially,  even for MRT.  When it first started, there  were\r\n\r\nproblems.   And  these  problems  will  get  less  and   less\r\n\r\nfrequent.  Even today, MRT also encounters problems from time\r\n\r\nto time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the audit, as a first step, we have SLRT to work\r\n\r\nwith the system supplier and, if need be, we will bring in  a\r\n\r\nconsultant  to do an audit.  I do not know whether  Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\nwill be happy about that.  But, if necessary, we will do it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for redress, SLRT has provided free bus services\r\n\r\nduring  the  disruptions.   So if there  is  any  claim  from\r\n\r\nresidents, who were affected by the service disruptions, they\r\n\r\ncan claim back from the operator.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister of State\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Ministry  will also  consider  asking  SLRT  to\r\n\r\ninstall railings on the track.

However, while the merger of  all\r\n\r\npublic   transport  operators  (PTOs)  may  provide   greater\r\n\r\neconomies  of  scale, it is in the interest  of  the  general\r\n\r\npublic  for sufficient competition to exist in the  industry.\r\n\r\nCompetition  ensures  that the PTOs will  strive  to  improve\r\n\r\ntheir   service  and  provide  better  value  for  money   to\r\n\r\ncommuters.

These guidelines are based on the latest status of the\r\n\r\nWorld  Health  Organisation (WHO) EMF Project  which  is  the\r\n\r\ninternational benchmark for research in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While noting that research is in progress, international\r\n\r\nscientific committees that have evaluated the current\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbody  of  evidence,  have reached the same  conclusion:  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  no established health effects from EMF  exposures\r\n\r\nbelow these internationally set guideline limits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to question (b), the Infocomm Development\r\n\r\nAuthority  of Singapore (IDA) gives type approval  of  mobile\r\n\r\nphones.  Part of this type approval includes radiation safety\r\n\r\nstandards  and the requirement for manufacturers  to  provide\r\n\r\ntheir Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) value for mobile phones.\r\n\r\nSo   these   radiation   safety  standards   are   based   on\r\n\r\ninternational safety standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to question (c), mobile cellular base stations\r\n\r\nare  commonly installed in both indoor and outdoor locations.\r\n\r\nThey function to provide mobile cellular subscribers with the\r\n\r\nrequired  mobile service coverage.

The details of  the\r\n\r\nEldershield insurance scheme was released by the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth on 24th August this year.  The Ministry of Health  had\r\n\r\ndecided  to  allow CPF members to use their Medisave  savings\r\n\r\nfor  the  Eldershield  premiums.  It had  also  designed  the\r\n\r\nEldershield insurance scheme to operate as an opt-out  scheme\r\n\r\nto attain as wide a coverage as possible.  To provide for the\r\n\r\nuse  of Medisave for Eldershield premium, the CPF Act has  to\r\n\r\nbe amended.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, the CPF Act allows the withdrawal of\r\n\r\nMedisave savings to pay for the premiums of medical insurance\r\n\r\nschemes  such  as Medishield, NTUC Income's Incomeshield  and\r\n\r\nAIA's Healthshield.  Such schemes are defined as insurance to\r\n\r\nreimburse  the  CPF members' hospitalisation  expenses.   The\r\n\r\nEldershield  is  a severe disability insurance  scheme  which\r\n\r\nprovides coverage for long-term care, including home care and\r\n\r\ndoes  not  cover  hospitalisation expenses.  Hence,  the  CPF\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill  before the House today  introduces  a  new\r\n\r\nprovision to allow CPF members to use their Medisave  savings\r\n\r\nto  pay  for  premiums  of  any healthcare  insurance  scheme\r\n\r\napproved  by the Minister for Health.  For those who  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  enough  Medisave  savings, they can  use  the  Medisave\r\n\r\nsavings  of their spouse, children, parents or grandchildren.\r\n\r\nThis will give CPF members greater flexibility in using their\r\n\r\nMedisave  savings  to pay for approved healthcare  insurance,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  Eldershield.  Sir, this is in line  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health's  objective of expanding  the  role  of\r\n\r\nhealthcare   insurance  to  meet  the  healthcare   cost   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Eldershield will operate as an opt-out scheme.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced that the  opt-out\r\n\r\nage  will be set at age 40 and the maximum entry age will  be\r\n\r\nset  at 70.  A special one-off exercise will be conducted for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans aged between 40 and 69 to decide whether to opt-out of Eldershield.  MOH has also announced that to encourage\r\n\r\ngreater private sector participation in the severe disability\r\n\r\ninsurance\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2089</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmarket, they will tender out Eldershield to private insurers.\r\n\r\nTo  enable  private  insurers to  operate  opt-out  insurance\r\n\r\nschemes,  the  CPF Board will need to provide these  insurers\r\n\r\nwith  certain  information.  Hence, the Bill  also  seeks  to\r\n\r\namend  the CPF Act to allow the CPF Board to release relevant\r\n\r\ninformation  to  an  insurer administering  or  operating  an\r\n\r\napproved insurance scheme, without the need for authorisation\r\n\r\nby  the Medisave account holder.  In the case of Eldershield,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  MOH  would  require  the  CPF  Board  to  pass\r\n\r\ninformation  such as the names, addresses and gender  of  CPF\r\n\r\nmembers  aged between 40 and 69, to the approved insurers  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate the running of the scheme.  For those who did  not\r\n\r\nopt out of Eldershield but have insufficient Medisave balance\r\n\r\nto pay for the premiums, the insurance companies have to know\r\n\r\nthe  premium shortfall so that they could request  these  CPF\r\n\r\nmembers to top up the outstanding balance by cash.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, CPF members may ask what are the safeguards and\r\n\r\nprevention of possible abuses of such information disclosure.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to  reassure hon. Members  that  CPF  account\r\n\r\ndetails would be safeguarded.  For Eldershield, only the  CPF\r\n\r\nmember's name, address, gender and premium shortfall, if any,\r\n\r\nwill be released to the insurer.  Insurers will not have free\r\n\r\naccess to CPF members' account details. For the vast majority\r\n\r\nof  members  who  have  enough  Medisave  to  pay  for  their\r\n\r\nEldershield  premium, information on their  Medisave  account\r\n\r\nbalance  will  not be released to the insurer.   The  insurer\r\n\r\nwill  know  only  when a CPF member does not have  sufficient\r\n\r\nMedisave  for  the Eldershield premium to be deducted.   This\r\n\r\nmakes  it convenient for CPF members, as they do not need  to\r\n\r\nseparately  check whether they have sufficient  Medisave  for\r\n\r\nEldershield premium.  As Medisave savings can be used to  pay\r\n\r\nfor  hospitalisation  expenses and other  approved  insurance\r\n\r\npremium  payments,  releasing  information  on  the  member's\r\n\r\nEldershield  premium  shortfall  is  not  indicative  of  the\r\n\r\nsavings  that  he  has  accumulated over  the  years  in  his\r\n\r\nMedisave account.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed amendments also stipulate that the\r\n\r\ninsurer  may  not use the information for any  other  purpose\r\n\r\nother than for those connected with the administration of the\r\n\r\nscheme.   The  insurance companies will  not  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\ndivulge  such  confidential information  to  their  insurance\r\n\r\nagents  or other parties for any other purposes.  An  insurer\r\n\r\nwho   misuses   or   wrongfully   communicates   confidential\r\n\r\ninformation  will  be  guilty  of  an  offence.   Under   the\r\n\r\nStatutory  Bodies  and  Government Companies  (Protection  of\r\n\r\nSecrecy) Act, the insurer shall be liable on conviction to  a\r\n\r\nfine  not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  12  months,  or to both, and  under  the  Official\r\n\r\nSecrets Act, the insurer shall be liable on conviction  to  a\r\n\r\nfine not exceeding $2,000 and to imprisonment for a term  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  two  years.  I would like to reiterate  that  only\r\n\r\ninformation that is essential for the administration  of  the\r\n\r\napproved  healthcare  insurance will be  passed  to  approved\r\n\r\nprivate  insurance companies, and that the approved insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies  will  be required to use the information  strictly\r\n\r\nfor  the  purpose of enrolling Singaporeans in  the  approved\r\n\r\nhealthcare insurance schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, this is a straightforward Bill\r\n\r\nand  the  provisions are very good.  I would like to  support\r\n\r\nit.  But I have a few questions for the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How would the CPF Board counsel those CPF members who\r\n\r\nwant  to opt out of the Eldershield scheme, considering  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  a good scheme for them?  On the supply and  use  of\r\n\r\ninformation  on  any  member that  the  insurer  requires,  I\r\n\r\nwelcome  the  Minister's assurance that the  Government  will\r\n\r\ntake  very  seriously any misuse of information.  But  it  is\r\n\r\nvery  important to every account holder that the  information\r\n\r\nabout him is not divulged to third parties.  So I would  like\r\n\r\nto ask the Minister how would the Government ensure that such\r\n\r\ninformation on the account holders is not divulged  to  third\r\n\r\nparties.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there plans by the Government to widen further the\r\n\r\nuse  of  CPF  savings  by account holders  to  buy  insurance\r\n\r\npolicies  and any other schemes that would help  workers  and\r\n\r\nbenefit  their elderly parents to make full use of their  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings?   Would the Minister inform the House of the  number\r\n\r\nof  active CPF account holders who use their CPF savings  for\r\n\r\nmonthly premiums for insurance schemes other than the schemes\r\n\r\napproved  or  administered  by the  Ministry  of  Health  and\r\n\r\nrelated  agencies?   Would  the CPF  Board  advise  both  the\r\n\r\naccount  holders as well as the insurers, if  the  Board  has\r\n\r\nreasons to believe that, in some other insurance scheme,  the\r\n\r\nCPF  member  may  not have the means to pay,  using  his  CPF\r\n\r\nbalance?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is very important to ensure that CPF members do\r\n\r\nnot  overuse their CPF balances which could result  in  their\r\n\r\nnot  having  the full benefits of the insurance schemes  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  signed  up  for, if they have  to  terminate  the\r\n\r\nservice  only  on  account  of their  inability  to  pay  the\r\n\r\npremium.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, when I read the Bill, my\r\n\r\nconcern was the loss of confidentiality of the CPF member  in\r\n\r\nregard  to  his CPF account.  I have just heard the  Minister\r\n\r\nsay that there are good preventive measures against insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies  abusing  their  ability  to  have  access  to  CPF\r\n\r\naccounts.  But from what I read here, the insurance companies\r\n\r\ndo not only have access to the main account of the CPF member\r\n\r\nbut   also  including  information  relating  to  the  amount\r\n\r\nstanding  to  his credit in his Medisave account.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords, they not only have access to the Medisave account, but\r\n\r\nalso  to  the  other accounts.  So maybe the  Minister  could\r\n\r\nclarify on that point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the Minister has thought of any other\r\n\r\nschemes  whereby  CPF  members could approach  the  insurance\r\n\r\ncompany  and it could tell them whether or not they  qualify,\r\n\r\nrather  than for the insurance company to be given a  blanket\r\n\r\nright  to look into CPF accounts.  Sir, I know the CPF  Board\r\n\r\nis  very strict on this point.  Even we, as lawyers, have  no\r\n\r\naccess to our clients' CPF accounts.  If we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwant  to know what is in our CPF accounts, sometimes when  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  know  that,  we have to get  the  member's  written\r\n\r\nconsent  or  authority  before we can  have  a  look  at  his\r\n\r\naccount.  So perhaps the Minister could assure the House that\r\n\r\nthis  access to CPF accounts is definitely not likely  to  be\r\n\r\nabused.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also heard the Minister saying that insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies  wanting to participate in this scheme are  subject\r\n\r\nto  tenders.   I hope that the Government shall  be  fair  in\r\n\r\napproving insurance companies which wish to run this  scheme,\r\n\r\nand  not  only  to  give  a  few select  preferred  insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies to have the monopoly of the business.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Members\r\n\r\nwho support the Bill.  I will now answer the questions raised\r\n\r\nby both Mr Hawazi and Mr Chiam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi asked whether the CPF Board will help to\r\n\r\ncounsel  members so that they do not opt out of  the  scheme.\r\n\r\nCertainly, when the Ministry of Health launches this  one-off\r\n\r\nexercise to ask those aged above 40 and up to age 69  whether\r\n\r\nthey are going to opt out or not, we will participate in  the\r\n\r\nprocess of educating and informing our CPF members.  We  will\r\n\r\nurge  them  not  to  opt  out recklessly.   This  is  a  good\r\n\r\ninsurance scheme.  Eldershield will help to provide for their\r\n\r\nold  age.  About 8% of the elderly population will be in need\r\n\r\nof such assistance.  So it will be good for these people.  It\r\n\r\nwill  be  good for us.  We do not know when we may be  struck\r\n\r\ndown by a disease or an ailment that requires long-term care.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is  a  very affordable insurance scheme  and  members\r\n\r\nshould   not   just   opt  out  without  making   a   careful\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi also asked whether the CPF Board would ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  information would not be used for other  purposes,\r\n\r\njust   like   Mr  Chiam  also  raised  the  same   point   on\r\n\r\nconfidentiality.   In  my  Second  Reading  speech,  I   have\r\n\r\naddressed this point.  The Board is very concerned  and  well\r\n\r\naware  of  its responsibility as trustees to the CPF  members\r\n\r\nfor  their  CPF savings.  We do not unnecessarily reveal  any\r\n\r\ninformation concerning members' accounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to access to members' particulars provided\r\n\r\nfor  in  this Amendment Bill, we are only limiting it to  the\r\n\r\nMedisave  account,  because it  is  related  to  the  use  of\r\n\r\nMedisave to pay for the premiums for Eldershield.  So we will\r\n\r\nnot allow the insurance companies to have direct access to  a\r\n\r\nmember's  CPF  account in toto.  For instance, the  insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies will not have access to the balance in his Ordinary\r\n\r\naccount.  Also, to further safeguard confidentiality, we will\r\n\r\nnot  be  conveying  to  the insurance  company  the  member's\r\n\r\nbalance position in his Medisave.  As I have explained in  my\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading  Bill,  our  intention  is  to  expedite  the\r\n\r\noperation  of this Eldershield insurance scheme  to  make  it\r\n\r\neasy.  If we have too many requirements, the cost of managing\r\n\r\nthe  insurance will go up, and premiums will, therefore, have\r\n\r\nto go up.  We want to make it affordable by designing it as a\r\n\r\nsimple, workable and pragmatic insurance scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are going to do is only to inform the insurance\r\n\r\ncompany when the member's account balance falls below what is\r\n\r\nrequired  for  him  to  pay  the premium.   So,  knowing  the\r\n\r\nanniversary date of his Eldershield policy, that we will have\r\n\r\nto  deduct  a  certain  amount of money for  the  Eldershield\r\n\r\npremium, and knowing from our records that he does not have a\r\n\r\nsufficient  balance in his account, we will then  inform  the\r\n\r\ninsurance company that so-and-so does not have enough to  pay\r\n\r\nthe  full premium and that it will have to collect from  him,\r\n\r\nsay,  \"X\" dollars in cash, to make up for the premium so that\r\n\r\nthe  policy  does  not  lapse.  In that  sense,  we  are  not\r\n\r\nrevealing all the information concerning the Medisave account\r\n\r\nto the insurance company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said in my Second Reading speech, the fact that he\r\n\r\nmay  not  have  a sufficient balance in his Medisave  account\r\n\r\ndoes not reflect on his financial position at all, because he\r\n\r\nmay  well  have somebody in the family who fell ill  recently\r\n\r\nand was hospitalised and his Medisave account was used to pay\r\n\r\nthose  hospitalisation expenses.  If he continues to  have  a\r\n\r\njob,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhe  continues to be able to service his mortgage, he  has  no\r\n\r\nfinancial  difficulty at all.  That is, in fact, a very  poor\r\n\r\nreflection of the state of his financial affairs.  So members\r\n\r\nshould  not worry that this Eldershield insurance will result\r\n\r\nin  the  confidentiality of their CPF account  details  being\r\n\r\nbreached.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi also asked whether we intend to widen the use\r\n\r\nof  CPF  savings  for  the  purchase of  insurance  policies.\r\n\r\nToday,  under the CPF Investment Scheme, we do allow  members\r\n\r\nto use their CPF savings, both in their Ordinary and in their\r\n\r\nSpecial  accounts,  to  purchase investment-linked  products.\r\n\r\nThese are insurance policies with an investment component.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think  we  have allowed the use of  CPF  savings  to\r\n\r\npurchase  an  ordinary  life  insurance  policy  without   an\r\n\r\ninvestment component.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there plans to widen the use of CPF savings for\r\n\r\ninsurance policies?  Under this Amendment Bill, I would  like\r\n\r\nto  point  out  to  Members that this is only  pertaining  to\r\n\r\nhealth insurance.  Hon. Members will notice that clause 3  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  amends section 77(1)(ja) of the CPF Act, and  that\r\n\r\nthe  section  refers to \"the withdrawal  of  money  from  the\r\n\r\nMedisave account of a member for payment of premiums  payable\r\n\r\nby the member or his dependant who is assured under a medical\r\n\r\ninsurance  scheme approved by the Minister charged  with  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  health.\"  So it is  strictly  a  health-related insurance scheme.  And the answer then would be, yes,\r\n\r\nI  believe the Ministry of Health is looking at other  health\r\n\r\ninsurance schemes which will meet their requirements, and  we\r\n\r\nwould  be  encouraging  CPF members to  consider  alternative\r\n\r\nforms of health insurance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi asked for the number of CPF members who have\r\n\r\nused  their CPF savings to purchase insurance schemes.  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  I  do not have the numbers with me, but if  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember has an interest in that, he can either file a Question\r\n\r\nor I can convey the answer to him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi also asked whether the CPF Board would advise\r\n\r\nCPF  members and insurers if the Board has reason to  believe\r\n\r\nthat a member is buying a policy that may\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwell  exceed  his means to service.  This is, of  course,  an\r\n\r\narea  of  some concern to us, especially in investment-linked\r\n\r\nproducts.   That is why last year we stopped the use  of  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings  for the purchase of annual premium investment-linked\r\n\r\nproducts, because there is a chance that the member  may  not\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  service a future premium and  the  policy  will\r\n\r\nlapse,  and  he stands to lose quite a large sum of  his  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings.   We  will  continue to advise and  to  educate  CPF\r\n\r\nmembers on making prudent decisions with regard to the use of\r\n\r\ntheir CPF savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Chiam urged that the Government should be\r\n\r\nfair  in approving companies to be named as the insurers  for\r\n\r\nthe  Eldershield  insurance scheme.  Let me assure  Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\nthat the Government is always fair and always above-board  in\r\n\r\nits  choice  of  service providers, whether it  is  just  for\r\n\r\nordinary  service  or  for  a  special  scheme  such  as   an\r\n\r\nEldershield  insurance  premium.   I  understand   that   the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health will invite insurance companies to  submit\r\n\r\ntheir tenders to participate in the scheme, and the merits of\r\n\r\neach  tender will be studied carefully, and only  those  that\r\n\r\nmeet  the requirements imposed by the Ministry of Health will\r\n\r\nbe  selected.   We are looking at, potentially,  up  to  four\r\n\r\ninsurance  companies  to  be selected  to  run  the  national\r\n\r\nscheme.   I  hope this will reassure Mr Chiam  that  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue, as always, to be fair and above-board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TREASURY BILLS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 3(1) of\r\n\r\nthe  Local  Treasury  Bills Act (Chapter  167,  1988  Revised\r\n\r\nEdition),   resolves  that  the  Minister  for   Finance   be\r\n\r\nauthorised  to  borrow, by the issue  of  Treasury  bills  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  a  revolving  sum not exceeding  twenty  thousand\r\n\r\nmillion Singapore dollars (S$20,000,000,000).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 4th May 1999, Parliament resolved, in accordance\r\n\r\nwith  section  3(1) of the Local Treasury Bills Act  (Chapter\r\n\r\n167),  that the Minister for Finance be authorised to borrow,\r\n\r\nby  the issue of Treasury bills in Singapore, a revolving sum\r\n\r\nnot  exceeding  S$15  billion.  This  limit  applies  to  the\r\n\r\noutstanding amount of Treasury bills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demand for Treasury bills has grown rapidly in the\r\n\r\npast  two  years  due  to an expansion of banks'  liabilities\r\n\r\nbase.  The outstanding amount of Treasury bills issued as  at\r\n\r\nend-July  2001  amounted  to  S$14.6  billion.   The   banks'\r\n\r\nliabilities base is expected to continue to expand  over  the\r\n\r\nnext  few  years, thus increasing their demand  for  Treasury\r\n\r\nbills  as  liquid  assets.   In  addition,  MAS'  efforts  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  issuance of Treasury bills to support  capital\r\n\r\nmarket  development  have also contributed  to  the  need  to\r\n\r\nincrease the borrowing limit for Treasury bills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed, therefore, that the current ceiling for\r\n\r\nborrowing  by  Treasury bills of S$15 billion, be  raised  by\r\n\r\nanother S$5 billion to a total of S$20 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament is requested to enable the Government to\r\n\r\nissue  the  Treasury bills up to a total amount not exceeding\r\n\r\nS$20 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 3(1) of\r\n\r\nthe  Local  Treasury  Bills Act (Chapter  167,  1988  Revised\r\n\r\nEdition),   resolves  that  the  Minister  for   Finance   be\r\n\r\nauthorised  to  borrow, by the issue  of  Treasury  bills  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  a  revolving  sum not exceeding  twenty  thousand\r\n\r\nmillion Singapore dollars (S$20,000,000,000).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT TO A DATE TO BE FIXED</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That, at its rising today, Parliament do now adjourn to\r\n\r\na date to be fixed.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SUPPORT FOR AND CONCERNS OVER ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS WITH CHINA</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.31 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): An article appearing on the 20th of August issue\r\n\r\nof  the  Yazhou  Zhoukan (Chinese version of Asiaweek)  ended\r\n\r\nwith  this  conclusion: \"The fast and  continuing  growth  of\r\n\r\nChina's  economy will change the economic structure of  Asia,\r\n\r\nand  end  the era dominated by the four dragons and  conclude\r\n\r\nthe leadership roles played by America and Japan in directing\r\n\r\nthe  economy of Asia.\"  In other words, China has now  become\r\n\r\nthe  new  leader in the economic fast train in Asia and  will\r\n\r\naffect  the  growth and prosperity of the region in  definite\r\n\r\nways.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these trends, our top leadership, including\r\n\r\nMinisters, senior civil servants and business leaders had led\r\n\r\nmany  delegations to China to explore new opportunities.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  for Trade and Industry, BG George Yeo also  made  a\r\n\r\ncall  to  Singaporeans to hurry up and join the ride on  this\r\n\r\nfast-tracked economic train to China. This call has generated\r\n\r\na  lot  of discussions.  But to take the ride, you must first\r\n\r\nbuy  the  tickets for the train.  Can you secure the tickets?\r\n\r\nCan  you  afford  it?   From where  could  you  purchase  the\r\n\r\ntickets?   Where is the embarkation point and  where  is  the\r\n\r\ndestination point?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the small and medium enterprises, do we\r\n\r\nhave  the  economic robustness and potential to be aggressive\r\n\r\nplayers  in  the  Chinese market?  As the Chinese  market  is\r\n\r\ndynamic  and  complex, are our Singaporeans savvy  enough  to\r\n\r\nidentify  the way to go? Even if they have the guts  to  give\r\n\r\nChina a try, many do not know how to adopt the next step.  We\r\n\r\nall  know  that  this kind of venture into China  is  a  very\r\n\r\ndifficult and arduous one and many give up half-way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our forefathers migrated to Singapore from\r\n\r\nChina,  the  generations after them have  changed.   The  new\r\n\r\ngeneration of Singaporeans are not familiar with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2098</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  background, culture, history,  law and systems of China.\r\n\r\nAt  the  operation  level,  China first  entered  a  business\r\n\r\nrelationship  on the basis of human sentiments,  followed  by\r\n\r\nreason,  then  secured by laws. Singaporeans  are  the  exact\r\n\r\nopposite.    Recently,  a young reader was  reported  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspaper  to  have openly expressed  contempt of  China  and\r\n\r\ndenied  his own cultural identity.  This shows that a segment\r\n\r\nof  our young people are short-sighted in perspective.   This\r\n\r\nincident  led  to  another question  which  was  subsequently\r\n\r\nraised by many: Will the following generations of Chinese  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   become  culturally  \"rootless\"  in  their   total\r\n\r\nacceptance of western influence?  If this might have been the\r\n\r\nresult  of coping with political, economic and ethnic  forces\r\n\r\nbeyond  the control of the government  and any racial  group,\r\n\r\nthen how can this destiny help us now to identify a group  of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  willing and daring to  break  into  the  China\r\n\r\nmarket?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been promoting bilingualism in Singapore. Yet,\r\n\r\nour  standard of Chinese is way below that in Malaysia,  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  and  Taiwan.  This is evident from the poor performance\r\n\r\nof  our  students  in  the inter-varsity debates  and  essay-writing  contests  held recently. Under our present education\r\n\r\nsystem, Chinese is only a second language and it has not been\r\n\r\ngiven adequate emphasis.  Our students study Chinese just  to\r\n\r\npass  the examination, and once the examination is over, they\r\n\r\nsimply discard the little Chinese that they have studied.  As\r\n\r\na  result,  our students are not able to read newspapers  and\r\n\r\nmagazines and  it explains why the standard of Chinese  among\r\n\r\nour students is low.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though language is not an absolute barrier against\r\n\r\ninvestment  opportunity  in  China,  it  is  nevertheless  an\r\n\r\nimportant bridging factor in relationship- building.  Because\r\n\r\nChinese  is one of the five official languages of the  United\r\n\r\nNations,     it  is incumbent on us to make it  a  policy  to\r\n\r\nimprove   our   standard  and  ability   to   speak   Chinese\r\n\r\ninternationally so that we can compete internationally.   For\r\n\r\nexample, when Deputy Prime Minister BG Lee went to China,  he\r\n\r\nwas able to cite Chinese poems from the Tang Dynasty,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand it left an excellent impression on the officials and\r\n\r\npeople of China. We should be able to establish better\r\n\r\nunderstanding and communication with the Chinese using the\r\n\r\nChinese language which is our mother tongue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are clear about this need, is it time now to\r\n\r\nrevitalise  our  search for cultural roots, seriously  review\r\n\r\nand  reform  our bilingual strategy, and have a comprehensive\r\n\r\noverhaul of our bilingual policy?  There is a famous  Chinese\r\n\r\nsaying to the effect that for a workman to do his work  well,\r\n\r\nhe  must first sharpen his tools. In the last few years,  the\r\n\r\npolitical,  business  and  worker  sectors  had   worked   in\r\n\r\npartnership to search for new economic measures. I would like\r\n\r\nto  propose five measures, which are not strictly economic in\r\n\r\nnature, which in the short-run are immediately implementable,\r\n\r\nand  in  the  long-run, form the foundation prerequisites  in\r\n\r\ncoping with the continuing Chinese economic challenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge our Ministers and senior civil servants to\r\n\r\nspeak  in  Mandarin  when interviewed by the  Chinese  media,\r\n\r\nparticularly  when  it is to be telecast  over  the  Chinese-language  television channels. All along,  the  promotion  of\r\n\r\nMandarin in the Speak Mandarin campaigns has been focused  on\r\n\r\nthe   private sector.  It is time for the Ministers  to  take\r\n\r\nthe lead through various activities such as singing, speaking\r\n\r\nand  other activities.  I notice that in this House, the vast\r\n\r\nmajority  of  speeches  are made in  English.   Outside  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  we  are talking about bilingualism. Why  is  it  that\r\n\r\ninside  this  House, we are not practising bilingualism?   We\r\n\r\nmust  have  people  on the top take the  lead  in  practising\r\n\r\nbilingualism in this House. As the Chinese saying  goes,  \"if\r\n\r\npeople  in  power  champion  a  cause,  there  will  be  many\r\n\r\nfollowers indeed.\"  I am not playing up Chinese chauvinism by\r\n\r\nstressing  the  importance of the  Chinese  language.   I  am\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated.  But since young, I have not  abandoned  my\r\n\r\ninterest in reading and studying Chinese and have never found\r\n\r\nit  to  have  in any way diluted my sense of being  a  multi-cultural  Singaporean,  or  my relationship  with  the  other\r\n\r\nethnic groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are facing the economic reality of a huge\r\n\r\nmarket  of  1.3 billion people in China, we have to  come  to\r\n\r\ngrips  with  the  destiny  and work  harder  at  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage.  When  addressing the gathering  of  World  Chinese\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  in Nanjing recently, the Chinese  Premier  Zhu\r\n\r\nRong  Zi said, \"To help develop the Chinese economy, we  need\r\n\r\nprofessionals  in  all  sectors, specialists  who  thoroughly\r\n\r\nunderstand the working of the international market,  and  who\r\n\r\nalso  understand  the traditional culture of China.\"  (Lianhe\r\n\r\nZaobao,  September  20).  His pronouncements  are  worth  our\r\n\r\nserious scrutiny and reflection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I propose that we set up a professional\r\n\r\ntranslation  bureau  to provide batches  of  translators  and\r\n\r\ninterpreters equipped with the different language  competence\r\n\r\nto  assist  the  business community in successfully  managing\r\n\r\nbusiness  discussions.  I was told that many Singaporeans  in\r\n\r\nChina  are incapable of reading Chinese documents and reports\r\n\r\nor taking notes in Chinese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I propose that we create a pro-Chinese economic\r\n\r\nstrategy  by starting first with our young persons.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  future  generations of our students would be given  more\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  take  part  in  exchange  programmes  with\r\n\r\nforeign  countries,  including China.  We must send  students\r\n\r\nand  teachers at all levels to visit China so that we  should\r\n\r\nnot  be seen as being arrogant and harbouring the mindset  of\r\n\r\n\"we  are  better than you\".  I hope that in our  Budget  next\r\n\r\nyear,  we  should have more funds allocated  to  enable  more\r\n\r\nstudents  and teachers to visit China.  At the same  time,  I\r\n\r\nhope  more  resources can be poured into setting up  Chinese-language  Internet  stations,  to  encourage  those  who  are\r\n\r\nInternet  users to also use the Chinese Internet stations  to\r\n\r\naccess the enormous virtual and real marketplace dominated by\r\n\r\nthe Chinese language.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we should form a special information resource\r\n\r\ndepartment to enhance our understanding on doing business  in\r\n\r\nChina  and assist Singapore businessmen overcome the  initial\r\n\r\nanxiety in their venture into the Chinese market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, we should compile case studies of earlier\r\n\r\npioneers  and investors in the Chinese market and hear  their\r\n\r\nexperiences and observations. As a Chinese saying goes, after\r\n\r\nwe  have  done  our  homework, we are prepared  and  fear  no\r\n\r\nconsequences.  By knowing the differences between  China  and\r\n\r\nourselves, we are more able to win the battles. Upon  knowing\r\n\r\nthe  differences, we have to learn the ways to manage them  - this  becomes  a required lesson that must be  learnt  before\r\n\r\nanyone marches on to China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago, I wrote Stepping Out, stories of our\r\n\r\npioneers who came from China to seek for their livelihood  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. This time round, we should be talking about  Going\r\n\r\nBack. Our pioneers once said, \"By stepping out, we will  find\r\n\r\na  livelihood.  Today, we must say, \"Let's go back  and  find\r\n\r\nnew ways.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my brother learnt that I was moving this motion in\r\n\r\nParliament,  he wrote me a letter and urged me to  share  his\r\n\r\nexperience  with this House. He said that when he first  went\r\n\r\nto  mainland China in 1989, he came across many difficulties,\r\n\r\nexperienced many setbacks, and witnessed a lot of  irrational\r\n\r\nhappenings. However,  he insisted on doing things the  proper\r\n\r\nway,  rather than going through the \"backdoor\".  As a result,\r\n\r\nhe commanded the respect of the local government and relevant\r\n\r\nauthorities  and  received strong support from  them.   After\r\n\r\nmany   years   of   perseverance  and  hard   work,   through\r\n\r\ncommunication  and  understanding with the various  quarters,\r\n\r\neverything seems to be smooth and ready for him now,  and  he\r\n\r\nhas  attained certain achievements in his endeavour. As such,\r\n\r\nhe feels the best opportunity for our local SMEs is in China.\r\n\r\nThey  can  use  mainland China as the  production  base,  and\r\n\r\ndevelop  their  products  and receive  orders  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nHowever,  he reminds would-be investors to China  that  China\r\n\r\nwould  not  roll out its red carpet to receive the investors,\r\n\r\nbut it would provide all kinds of facilities to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many foreign investors go into China but are unable to\r\n\r\nadapt to the Chinese\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nenvironment and they often go in with prejudices.  They  also\r\n\r\ncome  to  the  wrong  conclusion  that  they  are  just   not\r\n\r\ncompatible with the Chinese environment.  He also  said  that\r\n\r\nmany people, Singaporeans included, feel that the Chinese are\r\n\r\nlazy  and incapable.  I think this is all a misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nNow  the  Chinese,  especially the young ones,  are  full  of\r\n\r\ndrive.  They are responsible, they are hardworking  and  they\r\n\r\ncan  think  and  adapt to changes. They all  want  to  change\r\n\r\nthemselves, change their environment. With the liberalisation\r\n\r\nof  the media, ideological changes are taking place in  China\r\n\r\nand  the  young people in China are able to accept new  ideas\r\n\r\nfrom outside China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that I have mentioned just now should not be\r\n\r\nconfined to the Chinese Singaporeans.  As far as possible, we\r\n\r\nshould  also  bring  up our Indian and Malay  compatriots  as\r\n\r\nwell,  so  that together we can go into the China market  and\r\n\r\ntake a ride together, so that we can do our best in the China\r\n\r\nmarket. With cooperation among the various ethnic groups,  we\r\n\r\ncan also achieve higher level objectives in other non-Chinese\r\n\r\nspeaking  territories, like the west, the Indian  and  Muslim\r\n\r\nworlds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The event on September 11 brought to us a traumatic\r\n\r\nturning  point, reminding us once again of the importance  of\r\n\r\npolitical stability and multi-ethnic harmony. This moment  we\r\n\r\nmust specially cherish in gratitude the prosperity which this\r\n\r\ngovernment has provided for us in the last 36 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 36 years of arduous nation-building effort behind\r\n\r\nus,  the  Singapore  national identity is beginning  to  take\r\n\r\nroot.  We can stand firm on our multi-cultural legacies,  and\r\n\r\nby  integrating  the  wisdom of the Asian  cultures  and  the\r\n\r\ncreativity  of the western culture, we can shape the  winners\r\n\r\nfor  this  millennium. This process does not need  to  depend\r\n\r\nonly  on  the  State.   Community  agencies,  including   the\r\n\r\nbusiness   groups   and  organisations  as   well   as   clan\r\n\r\nassociations, can all play a part in building the bridges  in\r\n\r\npromoting  Singapore  and  Chinese business  development  and\r\n\r\ncultural understanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am anxious to move this motion on the Chinese\r\n\r\nchallenge in this House because I feel that we cannot dismiss\r\n\r\nChina  any  longer.   If we can hurry up  and  ride  on  this\r\n\r\neconomic  train to China, we are closer to taking that  small\r\n\r\nlittle  bite  in  the  huge economic pie  and  find  the  new\r\n\r\npathways  of  livelihood and business route for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nIf  we do not hurry now and embark on this exploration,  then\r\n\r\nwe  shall  soon become irrelevant and by the time we  realise\r\n\r\nour destiny, I think it will be too late.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In facing this uncertain and economic landscape, we\r\n\r\nshould  all  work  together to have a  single  heartbeat  and\r\n\r\nachieve our prosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen (Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Peter Chen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Mdm Chiang for raising\r\n\r\nsome very pertinent issues about China and her urgent call.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that we need to raise awareness among\r\n\r\nSingaporean business leaders, the younger generation and also\r\n\r\nthe  students about the many opportunities and the importance\r\n\r\nof  China, and also provide avenues for information  exchange\r\n\r\nand  networking  to  facilitate our  companies'  ventures  in\r\n\r\nChina.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China is emerging as a major economic power. In the\r\n\r\nlast  20 years, its GDP grew 9.7% per annum and in the  1990s\r\n\r\nalone,  at  10% per annum.  Few other countries in the  world\r\n\r\nhave achieved such impressive growth over this period.  While\r\n\r\nthere  are potential risks that may slow down China's growth,\r\n\r\nanalysts forecast that China's real GDP will continue to grow\r\n\r\nat about 8% for the next 10 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore already enjoys strong and growing bilateral\r\n\r\neconomic  relations with China.  Bilateral trade  grew  at  a\r\n\r\nrobust rate of 15% per annum in the last decade, and China is\r\n\r\ncurrently  Singapore's seventh largest trading  partner.   In\r\n\r\n1997, China became Singapore's top investment destination  in\r\n\r\ncumulative  terms.   Today, Singapore is also  China's  fifth\r\n\r\nlargest foreign investor.  But let me add, however, that  the\r\n\r\nexperiences of our businessmen in China have been mixed.   In\r\n\r\nthe early\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndays,  not  a  few  were  cheated.  Even  now,  not  everyone\r\n\r\nactually  makes  money.   It  is  therefore  important   that\r\n\r\nSingapore investors go into the China market with their  eyes\r\n\r\nwide   open  and  learn  both  from  the  happy  and  unhappy\r\n\r\nexperiences of others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Development Board (TDB) is the lead agency\r\n\r\npromoting   external   trade   and   investments,   including\r\n\r\ncompanies'  market  expansion efforts into  China.   However,\r\n\r\nrecognising that our engagement of China requires a concerted\r\n\r\neffort by many different Government agencies, MTI will set up\r\n\r\nan  International Business Division (IBD) next month.  For  a\r\n\r\nstart,  IBD will focus on China alone, and play the important\r\n\r\nrole  of  coordinating efforts and reviewing progress  across\r\n\r\nthe  various  agencies.  It is important for our  businessmen\r\n\r\noperating in China to do so on the basis of deep knowledge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address Mdm Chiang's suggestions, which can be\r\n\r\nbroadly  classified into two categories: first, disseminating\r\n\r\nof  information and, second, facilitating companies'  efforts\r\n\r\nto  tap  on  the many opportunities in China.  On  the  first\r\n\r\npoint,  Singapore needs to be aware of the tremendous changes\r\n\r\nthat  have taken place, and continue to take place in  China.\r\n\r\nIt  is important for us to deepen our knowledge of  China and\r\n\r\nunderstand the opportunities and also the pitfalls.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the sharing of good and bad experiences\r\n\r\namong  Singapore businesses, TDB will set up  Network  China.\r\n\r\nAs  the  name  implies, this will serve  as  a  platform  for\r\n\r\nnetworking  among  businessmen.   The  aim  is  to  encourage\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  to  share  their experiences  and  knowledge  on\r\n\r\nChina,  and  shorten the learning curve for  other  Singapore\r\n\r\ncompanies.   In  addition,  this platform  will  also  create\r\n\r\nopportunities  for collaboration among Singapore  businessmen\r\n\r\nentering  China  as well as for partnering Chinese  companies\r\n\r\nfor  other markets.  Apart from Singapore companies,  Network\r\n\r\nChina  will  also  involve MNCs and the various  Chambers  of\r\n\r\nCommerce  and  Industries, including  the  Malay  and  Indian\r\n\r\nChambers.  Mdm Chiang's point is well taken.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Chamber of Commerce and Industry in China\r\n\r\nwill be set up by our businessmen who are now in China by the\r\n\r\nend of this year.  Headquartered in Beijing, the Chamber will\r\n\r\nalso   have  extensions  in  key  cities  such  as  Shanghai,\r\n\r\nGuangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian later on.  I am confident  that\r\n\r\nthis  private  sector  driven effort will  provide  a  useful\r\n\r\nplatform  to  sieve  on-the-ground  market  intelligence  for\r\n\r\ndissemination back to Singapore through Network China.   Such\r\n\r\na   grouping   also  creates  opportunities   for   Singapore\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  based in China to network with one another.   In\r\n\r\nthis  way,  they  can learn from one another, and  assimilate\r\n\r\nmore easily into the new environment, both business-wise  and\r\n\r\nsocially.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help raise Singaporeans' awareness about business\r\n\r\nopportunities  in  China, TDB will set up  a  China  Business\r\n\r\nInformation Centre (CBIC) in Singapore.  Besides serving as a\r\n\r\nfirst-stop   centre  to  handle  China  business  information\r\n\r\ninquiry  services,  the Centre will conduct  market  studies,\r\n\r\ncollect market information and disseminate the information to\r\n\r\nSingapore companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chiang made a very good suggestion of providing\r\n\r\ninformation  on the web.  TDB will follow up on this  and  to\r\n\r\nadd depth to its existing portal to reach a large audience in\r\n\r\na  timely fashion.  But information by itself is not  enough.\r\n\r\nConverting   it  into  knowledge  is  much  more   difficult.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have a reputation in China as straight  dealers,\r\n\r\nbut that also means that we get taken advantage of sometimes.\r\n\r\nIn  a different way, some too may have lost a little of their\r\n\r\ninnocence.   We  must  make  sure that  our  good  reputation\r\n\r\ntranslates into an asset, and not a liability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We note Mdm Chiang's suggestion that we have to create a\r\n\r\nconducive  environment  for  Singapore  students   to   learn\r\n\r\nChinese,  and also to improve the facility for the  language.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry  of Education strongly encourages  students  to\r\n\r\nstudy  their mother tongue for as long as possible and to  as\r\n\r\nhigh a level as they are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncapable  of.   We  currently have 10 Special Assistance  Plan\r\n\r\n(SAP)  schools offering Higher Chinese at the secondary level\r\n\r\nand  three  Junior  Colleges offering  the  Chinese  language\r\n\r\nelective  programme.  At the university level,  NUS  and  NTU\r\n\r\nwill  introduce  a  bonus  points  scheme  for  admission  to\r\n\r\nselected courses of the Chinese language and Chinese  Studies\r\n\r\nCourse from academic year 2002/2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education also offers teaching\r\n\r\nscholarships  tenable  in China, and our  local  universities\r\n\r\nalready  have exchange programmes for Singaporeans  to  spend\r\n\r\nsome  time  in  a Chinese university.  Besides,  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave  the  opportunity to interact with many Chinese students\r\n\r\npursuing their MBAs here in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond a better grasp of the Chinese language, as has\r\n\r\nbeen   emphasised  repeatedly,  it  is  also   necessary   to\r\n\r\nunderstand  China better.  For a start, seven  officers  from\r\n\r\nthe  economic  agencies under the Firefly programme  will  be\r\n\r\nsent   to  Tsinghua  University  and  Fudan  University  this\r\n\r\nOctober.   They  will  pursue  an  International   MBA.    An\r\n\r\nimmersion  into  China  and  in  understanding  the  business\r\n\r\nculture will equip our economic officials to better formulate\r\n\r\npolicies  to  deepen economic linkages with  China.   In  due\r\n\r\ncourse,  we  hope we can also create a corps of officers  who\r\n\r\nare steeped in both the language and culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond knowing China better, we also need to facilitate\r\n\r\nSingapore companies' entry into, and subsequent expansion  in\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese market.  To do so, TDB is looking into expanding\r\n\r\nits network of offices in China.  TDB is also looking at ways\r\n\r\nto  provide  more  and better services to help  companies  in\r\n\r\ntheir  initial  foray  and  subsequent  expansion  in  China.\r\n\r\nDetails will be announced at a later stage when finalised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, TDB led 10 missions to China to explore trade\r\n\r\nand  investment  opportunities,  and  TDB  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nspearhead  business  missions to China.  These  missions  are\r\n\r\nuseful  for  SMEs  that are less likely to  explore  overseas\r\n\r\nmarkets by themselves.  To achieve greater synergy\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  results,  the missions will take on a stronger  industry\r\n\r\nfocus  leveraging  on  Singapore's  strengths,  or  a  market\r\n\r\nexploration  focus  to help Singapore companies  explore  new\r\n\r\nemerging  areas in China.  Some of these have been, and  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to be, jointly organised with Chambers of  Commerce\r\n\r\nand  Industry associations.  It is good that in most business\r\n\r\ndelegations,  there  is  now  a  good  mix  of  veterans  and\r\n\r\nfreshies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China is growing by leaps and bounds. Singapore needs\r\n\r\nto  focus  on industry clusters where we have strengths,  and\r\n\r\npenetrate  regions  where these strengths  are  valued.   Our\r\n\r\ncompanies will need to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconstantly upgrade their technology and management skills, or\r\n\r\nrisk  being  left  behind  by  the  Chinese,  or  by  foreign\r\n\r\ncompetitors  in China.  However, we must also recognise  that\r\n\r\nChina   is  a  difficult  market  with  a  complex  operating\r\n\r\nenvironment  and,  unless one understands this  fact,  it  is\r\n\r\neasier to lose money there than to make money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Three Minutes to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Three o'clock pm to a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>ORAL ANSWER NOT ANSWERED BY 2.00 PM</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE OPEN UNIVERSITY</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Use of CPF balances for degree courses)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Thomas Thomas</b> asked the Minister for Manpower if\r\n\r\nhe  will,  in  line with the national objective of  promoting\r\n\r\nlifelong  learning,  allow  Central  Provident  Fund  account\r\n\r\nholders  to  use their balances to pay for degree courses  at\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Open  University and  for  distance  learning\r\n\r\ncourses from reputable overseas universities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members of Parliament have in the past raised\r\n\r\nthe  issue  of allowing CPF for part-time courses,  including\r\n\r\nthose  offered by the Singapore Open University and  distance\r\n\r\nlearning degree courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the desire of individuals who wish to have\r\n\r\nthe  flexibility  to  use  their CPF  savings  for  part-time\r\n\r\ncourses.   Since the special exception was made  in  1989  to\r\n\r\nallow  CPF  for local full-time tertiary education,  we  have\r\n\r\nreceived many requests to liberalise the CPF Education Scheme\r\n\r\nto  cover  overseas  education, part-time  courses,  distance\r\n\r\nlearning, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF is meant for a member's retirement, housing and\r\n\r\nmedical needs.  We have allowed CPF to be used for local full-time  tertiary education as a concession to help  low  income\r\n\r\nfamilies  support  their  children  through  local  full-time\r\n\r\ntertiary   education.    To  ensure  that   the   fundamental\r\n\r\nobjectives of the CPF in meeting the retirement, housing  and\r\n\r\nmedical  needs  of  its members will not be  undermined,  the\r\n\r\nscheme  was  confined  to  full-time  tertiary  education  at\r\n\r\napproved local institutions, because such courses are heavily\r\n\r\nsubsidised by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPF members who are working adults and wish to pursue\r\n\r\nfurther education at the Singapore Open University or take up\r\n\r\ndistance learning courses are advised to plan in advance  for\r\n\r\ntheir studies, and set aside sufficient cash savings to  meet\r\n\r\ntheir  education expenses. Those who intend to  pursue  part-time  distance learning courses should plan ahead  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat they can meet the course fees and the time to devote  to\r\n\r\nsuch courses before embarking on the course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have found that the dropout rates for part-time\r\n\r\nstudents in our institutes of higher learning are much higher\r\n\r\nthan  that for full-time students.  Allowing CPF savings  for\r\n\r\npart-time  courses could therefore result in erosion  of  the\r\n\r\nold age savings. In view of the above, CPF savings should not\r\n\r\nbe   used  for  part-time  studies  at  the  Singapore   Open\r\n\r\nUniversity and distance learning degree courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ENROLMENT FOR PRIMARY ONE CLASSES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Dr Tan Boon Wan</b> asked the Minister for Education if\r\n\r\nhe  will consider allowing children, who were born a few days\r\n\r\nafter  the  cut-off  date but who are ready  to  start  their\r\n\r\nprimary education, to enrol early for Primary One.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been the policy of the Ministry of Education to\r\n\r\nadmit  children to Primary One who are age 6 and above as  on\r\n\r\n1st  January in the year of admission.

The polyclinic  should\r\n\r\nbe  ready  by  2004.  In the meantime, we have  extended  the\r\n\r\nPrimary  Care  Partnership Scheme to Sengkang so  that  needy\r\n\r\nelderly  residents  have the added convenience  of  receiving\r\n\r\nsubsidised care at private General Practitioner (GP)  clinics\r\n\r\nnear their homes instead of travelling to a polyclinic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BICYCLE LANES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications  and Information Technology  if  his  Ministry\r\n\r\nintends  to  improve  the roads in Singapore,  especially  in\r\n\r\nnewer  housing estates, to cater for bicycle lanes,  so  that\r\n\r\nmore  residents  can adopt the healthy lifestyle  of  cycling\r\n\r\nwhen  they  need  to  travel  short  distances  within  their\r\n\r\nestates, instead of relying on cars or feeder buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In land scarce Singapore, road space is limited and\r\n\r\nshould  be  used for the efficient movement of people,  goods\r\n\r\nand  services.  Thus  far, we have only set  aside  dedicated\r\n\r\nlanes  on our roads for public buses.  This is because  buses\r\n\r\nprovide  an efficient form of mass transportation.  Bicycles,\r\n\r\non  the  other hand, do not offer such efficiencies. We  must\r\n\r\nalso  recognise  that  our hot and  humid  weather  makes  it\r\n\r\nunlikely   for   cycling  to  become   a   major   means   of\r\n\r\ntransportation. Hence, to provide dedicated bicycle lanes  on\r\n\r\npublic roads will not be an efficient use of our limited road\r\n\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we do recognise that cycling is a good form of\r\n\r\nexercise, and in this regard, we have been providing  cycling\r\n\r\ntracks  and facilities for our residents. The Park  Connector\r\n\r\nNetwork  being developed by the National Parks Board  is  one\r\n\r\nsuch  example.    This  is a network of jogging  cum  cycling\r\n\r\ntracks that links our major parks and nature sites.  They\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalso  link  urban and residential areas, providing convenient\r\n\r\nroutes to places such as MRT stations, bus stops and markets.\r\n\r\nIn  addition,  we have also provided bicycle  stands  at  MRT\r\n\r\nstations  to  cater to commuters who want  to  cycle  between\r\n\r\ntheir homes and transport nodes such as MRT stations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Town Councils may provide cycling tracks within their\r\n\r\nHDB  estates.  The Pasir Ris Town Council, for  instance,  is\r\n\r\nproviding for cycling tracks within its estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>WRITTEN ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BUS AND MRT FARES FOR STUDENTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications  and Information Technology  why  is  it  that\r\n\r\nstudents  from the polytechnics pay adult fares for rides  on\r\n\r\nbuses and on the MRT whereas those from junior colleges  only\r\n\r\npay student's concession rates, when both are of the same age\r\n\r\nand are students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public transport operators grant concessionary\r\n\r\ntravel  to  various groups of individuals, such as pre-school\r\n\r\nchildren,  students and senior citizens, to help lower  their\r\n\r\ncost  of  travelling. The privileges and types of  concession\r\n\r\noffered differ from group to group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public transport operators have a different\r\n\r\nconcessionary   travel  scheme  for  students   in   tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions  compared to those in schools. The  polytechnics\r\n\r\nare considered as tertiary institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For tertiary students, the operators offer two types of\r\n\r\nconcession  schemes. The first is the monthly bus  concession\r\n\r\nstamp,  which allows the holder to take unlimited  number  of\r\n\r\ntrips  on  buses for the month that he or she holds  a  valid\r\n\r\nstamp.  The other is the monthly MRT concession ticket, which\r\n\r\nentitles  the holder of a valid ticket to travel on  the  MRT\r\n\r\nand LRT systems up to 4 trips a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, a tertiary student who makes extensive use of the\r\n\r\npublic  transport  system can cut down his or  her  transport\r\n\r\nexpenditure  by  making  use  of  the  available   concession\r\n\r\nschemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public transport operators are listed companies and need\r\n\r\nto  earn a profit for their operations.  At the urging of the\r\n\r\npublic,  they have granted concessions to various  groups  of\r\n\r\npeople.  However  the more concessions that are  granted,  it\r\n\r\nwould  mean  that other commuters would have  to  pay  higher\r\n\r\nfares to make up the difference.\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
