It is  only  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of non-manual workers that the ceiling  of\r\n\r\n$400 earnings per month is fixed so that non-manual\r\n\r\nworkers  earning more than $400 per month will  not\r\n\r\nbe eligible for workmen's compensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Ordinance is amended in the manner suggested\r\n\r\nby the Member for Kallang, it would have the effect\r\n\r\nof denying workmen's compensation for manual\r\n\r\nworkers should their earnings exceed $750 per\r\n\r\nmonth. As for non-manual workers, statistics for\r\n\r\nthe 11 months of January to November 1969 show that\r\n\r\nthe number of non-manual workers who were paid\r\n\r\nworkmen's compensation was 14 out of a total of \r\n\r\n7,952.

Where the victim is permanently disabled, the\r\n\r\nworkmen's  compensation is calculated on 48  months\r\n\r\nof  his monthly earnings or $9,600 whichever is the\r\n\r\nless.  The  maximum payable for death or  permanent\r\n\r\ndisablement of the employee is based on an  earning\r\n\r\nof $200 per month.

Nothing can be  done  to\r\n\r\nprevent rainfall or to alter the movement of tides.\r\n\r\nHowever,  our drainage system can be improved.  But\r\n\r\nfinance is the limiting factor. We can construct  a\r\n\r\ndrainage  system augmented by huge pumping stations\r\n\r\nthat will meet all eventualities, but this will  be\r\n\r\nextremely costly and difficult to justify.

The use of protective masks,  therefore,\r\n\r\nfor  this  purpose alone is not practical  as  such\r\n\r\nmasks  restrict  movement, are  uncomfortable,  and\r\n\r\nhave   never   been   popular  with   the   workers\r\n\r\nthemselves.

Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, many people believe that the\r\n\r\nprimary  object of the Abortion Bill is to  provide\r\n\r\nan  additional  check on the population  growth  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  particularly when contraceptives  fail.\r\n\r\nIf this is truly the primary intention of the Bill,\r\n\r\nthen I cannot accept it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family planning in Singapore has been a great\r\n\r\nsuccess  and  our  crude  birth  rate  has   fallen\r\n\r\ndramatically in recent years to 2.3 per  cent.  For\r\n\r\nthis,  I  must congratulate the former and  present\r\n\r\nMinisters  for  Health, and  I  am  sure  with  the\r\n\r\ncontinued efforts by the present Minister on family\r\n\r\nplanning, the expected target of two per  cent  by\r\n\r\n1970  will be within our reach. I therefore  cannot\r\n\r\nsee the need to introduce this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My contention is that despite the great advances\r\n\r\nmade in science, now that man is able to travel  to\r\n\r\nthe  moon, man is still unable to create human life\r\n\r\nin  a  science  laboratory. Since we cannot  create\r\n\r\nhuman life, we have no right to destroy human life.\r\n\r\nExcept for medical emergencies when both the lives\r\n\r\nof the mother and the unborn baby are at stake, and\r\n\r\nunless the resort to abortion can save at least the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmother, I cannot agree to abortion under any  other\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that population control is absolutely\r\n\r\nnecessary for the preservation and even survival of\r\n\r\nthe community, but is it necessary at this stage of\r\n\r\ngreat  success  in family planning that  we  should\r\n\r\nresort to killing of the foetus in order to control\r\n\r\npopulation  growth? The Minister has  not  proposed\r\n\r\nthat  it be made illegal for anyone to have  five,\r\n\r\n10  or  even 12 children, though the father may  be\r\n\r\ndeprived   of  income  tax  relief,  free   primary\r\n\r\neducation,  etc, in  respect  of  the  fourth  and\r\n\r\nsubsequent  children. Yet it should be pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat  for every abortion done to reduce the  number\r\n\r\nof  births by one, its effect is cancelled  by  the\r\n\r\nmany  unwanted  births to others who  already  have\r\n\r\nseveral  children. Therefore, the answer  seems  to\r\n\r\nlie  not  in  abortion,  but  in  compulsory  birth\r\n\r\ncontrol  for  people with more than, say,  two  or\r\n\r\nthree  children. Mr Speaker, Sir, with due respect\r\n\r\nto the Minister, I cannot accept the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would leave this thought with\r\n\r\nthe  House - if this Bill had been introduced, say,\r\n\r\n50  years ago, would we be so fortunate as to  have\r\n\r\nall our 11 Ministers with us today?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the noticeable trends in\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries  is  that  parents  with  more\r\n\r\neducation  have  much smaller families  than  those\r\n\r\nwith less education. This trend is also discernible\r\n\r\nin    urbanised,   though   still   underdeveloped,\r\n\r\nsocieties like Singapore. If these trends  continue\r\n\r\nto  their logical conclusions, then the quality  of\r\n\r\nthe population will go down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all societies, there are the more intelligent\r\n\r\nand the less intelligent. Professor Richard Lynn, a\r\n\r\nmember   of   the  Economic  and  Social   Research\r\n\r\nInstitute,  Dublin, wrote in the New  Scientist  of\r\n\r\n20th March, 1969, that geneticists have come to the\r\n\r\nconclusion   that   intelligence   is   principally\r\n\r\ndetermined  by  heredity.  One  of  the   ways   of\r\n\r\ndemonstrating  this  is  through   the   study   of\r\n\r\nidentical   twins  reared  in  different  families.\r\n\r\nInvestigations in Britain, America and Denmark\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave   invariably  revealed  a  high   measure   of\r\n\r\nagreement  between the I.Q.s of  identical  twins,\r\n\r\neven  though  they have been reared in families  of\r\n\r\ndifferent  educational and cultural standards.  The\r\n\r\nI.Q. classification of the levels of  the  various\r\n\r\noccupations  was  quoted by  the  same  author  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n       Occupation                      Mean I.Q.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n  Higher professional and executive       150 \r\n\r\n  Lower professional and executive        130 \r\n\r\n  Highly skilled and Clerical             118\r\n\r\n  Skilled workers                         108                                \r\n\r\n  Semi-skilled workers                     97\r\n\r\n  Unskilled workers                        86         \r\n\r\n</pre>  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not unlikely that many other attributes of\r\n\r\nmind and body are also inherited. But whatever  the\r\n\r\ninheritance,  man,  more  than  any  other   living\r\n\r\ncreature, depends on nurturing and training for his\r\n\r\ncapacity to mature and to develop. Man needs to  be\r\n\r\nreared  for one-third of his life span in order  to\r\n\r\nbe  productive for the next two-thirds.  In  highly\r\n\r\ndeveloped societies, students are supported for  25\r\n\r\nto  27 years until they get their Ph.D.'s, and then\r\n\r\nbegin  to  repay their debt to society.  His  final\r\n\r\nperformance  is  affected  by  diet,   health   and\r\n\r\ncultural,  social  and  educational  opportunities.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  less educated who are also in the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  groups  have large families,  the  problems\r\n\r\nthey  create  for  their children  are  compounded.\r\n\r\nResources,  time, attention and care,  lavished  on\r\n\r\none  or  two children, can nurture and develop  the\r\n\r\nendowments of the children to their fullest extent;\r\n\r\nwhen  spread and frittered over six or more in  the\r\n\r\nfamily,  prevent any child from getting the chances\r\n\r\nhe could have had in a smaller family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In urbanised Singapore, this can become an\r\n\r\nacute  problem.  Free  pre-natal  care,  post-natal\r\n\r\nhealth  and  almost  free  medical  services   have\r\n\r\nreduced infant mortality to the low rates of highly\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries. Free education and subsidised\r\n\r\nhousing lead to a situation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere  the  less economically productive people  in\r\n\r\nthe  community are reproducing themselves at  rates\r\n\r\nhigher than the rest. This will increase the  total\r\n\r\npopulation of less productive people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our problem is how to devise a system of disincentives,\r\n\r\nso that the irresponsible, the social delinquents, do not\r\n\r\nbelieve that all the have to do is to produce their \r\n\r\nchildren and the government then owes them and their\r\n\r\nchildren sufficient food, medicine, housing, education\r\n\r\nand jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain areas of activity over which\r\n\r\ncontrol  by  any government is both  difficult  and\r\n\r\nrepugnant.  One  such area is  the  choice  of  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  children a father and mother decide  to\r\n\r\nrear.  One  day  the pressure of circumstances  may\r\n\r\nbecome  so acute that attitudes must change.  Until\r\n\r\nsuch  time  when  moral inhibitions  disappear  and\r\n\r\nlegislative or administrative measures can be taken\r\n\r\nto  regulate the size of families, we must  try  to\r\n\r\ninduce  people  to  limit their families  and  give\r\n\r\ntheir children a better chance. The quality of  our\r\n\r\npopulation  depends on raising not  only  the  I.Q.\r\n\r\nlevel but also getting parents to care, nurture and\r\n\r\neducate  their  children and to develop  all  those\r\n\r\nother  qualities  so  crucial to  effective  living\r\n\r\nsummed up in the word \"character\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every person, genius or moron, has a right to\r\n\r\nreproduce himself. So we assume that a married pair\r\n\r\nwill  want  to be allowed two children  to  replace\r\n\r\nthem.  This is already the average size  family  of\r\n\r\nthe   skilled  industrial  worker  in  Europe.   In\r\n\r\nSingapore  we  still allow three for good  measure.\r\n\r\nBeyond  the three children, the costs of subsidised\r\n\r\nhousing,  socialised medicine  and  free  education\r\n\r\nshould  be  transferred  to  the  parent.  We  have\r\n\r\nchanged  the priorities in public housing,  by  not\r\n\r\nawarding more points for more children. One day  we\r\n\r\nmay  have to put disincentives or penalties on  the\r\n\r\nother social services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By introducing this new abortion law together\r\n\r\nwith the companion voluntary sterilisation law, we\r\n\r\nare  making  possible  the  exercise  of  voluntary\r\n\r\nchoice. But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe must keep a close watch on the result of the new\r\n\r\nlaws and the patterns of use which will emerge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not unlikely that the people who will want\r\n\r\nto  restrict their families are the better educated\r\n\r\nparents  in  better paid jobs. They are the  people\r\n\r\nwho already understand that their children's future\r\n\r\ndepends  on  their  being able to  care  for  their\r\n\r\nhealth, education and upbringing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the crucial yardsticks by which we shall\r\n\r\nhave  to judge the results of the new abortion  law\r\n\r\ncombined with the voluntary sterilisation law  will\r\n\r\nbe  whether  it tends to raise or lower  the  total\r\n\r\nquality of our population. We must encourage  those\r\n\r\nwho earn less than $200 per month and cannot afford\r\n\r\nto  nurture and educate many children never to have\r\n\r\nmore  than  two. Intelligent application  of  these\r\n\r\nlaws  can  help  reduce  the  distortion  that  has\r\n\r\nalready  set in. Until the less educated themselves\r\n\r\nare   convinced  and  realise  that   they   should\r\n\r\nconcentrate their limited resources on one  or  two\r\n\r\nto  give their children the maximum chance to climb\r\n\r\nup  the  educational  ladder, their  children  will\r\n\r\nalways be at the bottom of the economic scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unlikely that the results will be\r\n\r\ndiscernible before five years. Nor will the  effect\r\n\r\nbe felt before fifteen to twenty years. But we will\r\n\r\nregret  the  time lost if we do not  now  take  the\r\n\r\nfirst  tentative steps towards correcting  a  trend\r\n\r\nwhich can leave our society with a large number  of\r\n\r\nthe   physically,  intellectually  and   culturally\r\n\r\nanaemic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was expecting to see, as a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the numerous representations submitted,\r\n\r\nsome  basic  changes  and amendments  made  by  the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee on the Abortion Bill but this  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  so.  The  Minister  for  Health  in  his\r\n\r\nstatement  last Tuesday in this House  stated  that\r\n\r\nthere  were  some minor amendments but  that  there\r\n\r\nwere    no   substantial   changes,   though   many\r\n\r\nrepresentations had been submitted  to  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee. And studying the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSelect Committee's Report, I am somewhat struck  by\r\n\r\na number of points raised in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do not wish to go back to those\r\n\r\npoints  I made in this House on Tuesday, 8th April,\r\n\r\n1969. My stand has not been changed since then  and\r\n\r\nI  do not wish to waste Members' time by repeating\r\n\r\nwhat  I  said then. Therefore, Sir, suffice that  I\r\n\r\nshall confine my remarks to the Report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it can be seen that out of 29 written\r\n\r\nrepresentations  and not 33, Sir,  the  other  four\r\n\r\nwere on the Voluntary Sterilization Bill - received\r\n\r\nby the Select Committee on the Abortion Bill, there\r\n\r\nwere  no  less than 21 that were either opposed  to\r\n\r\nthe  Bill in principle or at least were opposed  to\r\n\r\nthe present broadly worded \"socio-economic\" clause,\r\n\r\nfound  in  clause 5 (2) (b). In spite of  this,  it\r\n\r\nappears  to me that the Select Committee  not  only\r\n\r\ndid  not  see fit to propose any amendment to  this\r\n\r\nclause, but also they did not appear to have  spent\r\n\r\nvery  much  time  discussing the arguments  against\r\n\r\nthis    clause   which   were   made    in    those\r\n\r\nrepresentations. The arguments put forth by some of\r\n\r\nthem  I  consider to be extremely well-founded  and\r\n\r\nforceful.  Take  Paper No. 14, in page  A4l  as  an\r\n\r\nexample.  I  refer to points Nos. 7  to  12.  These\r\n\r\npeople  consider themselves as teachers who have  a\r\n\r\nresponsibility to perform, and they are of the view\r\n\r\nthat clause 5 (2), if passed, will have ill-effects\r\n\r\n\"on the character of the nation\". And so, too, have\r\n\r\nmany  of the representations been made on the point\r\n\r\nthat  the  human  foetus has at  least  some  human\r\n\r\nrights. Yet nowhere in the Minutes of Evidence do I\r\n\r\nfind  the  Select Committee seeking  to  have  this\r\n\r\npoint  discussed,  much less conceded  to.  Surely,\r\n\r\nthis is the central issue: if the human foetus  has\r\n\r\nno  human  rights, then there is no  need  for  any\r\n\r\nlegal  restrictions on abortion; but if the  foetus\r\n\r\ndoes  possess some human rights, then the law  must\r\n\r\nexercise  extreme caution to protect  those  rights\r\n\r\nfrom  being  violated.  It is  regretted  that  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee did not seem to have thought  fit\r\n\r\nto  raise the question of the rights of the  foetus\r\n\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me, Sir, to another point about\r\n\r\nwhich I feel very, very strongly. In referring to\r\n\r\nthose who sent in written representations on the\r\n\r\nAbortion Bill, the Minister for Health in his\r\n\r\nspeech said in this House and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Some took their stand in accordance with their\r\n\r\nparticular religious persuasion, although they of\r\n\r\ncourse did not want openly to admit it.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, I consider this remark a\r\n\r\ngratuitous insult to the authors of the\r\n\r\nrepresentations. It accuses them, by implication,\r\n\r\nof insincerity, of concealment and of crookedness.\r\n\r\nI consider it not only insulting but blatantly\r\n\r\nunjust and uncalled for. I know that amongst the\r\n\r\nmemoranda sent in by religious organisations, the\r\n\r\nlargest number came from the Catholic bodies. Yet\r\n\r\nreading the representations, do we find them\r\n\r\narguing that abortion should be prohibited because\r\n\r\nthe Catholic Church teaches that it is wrong? We do\r\n\r\nnot. We find them arguing that abortions should be\r\n\r\nprohibited because it is bad for the nation. They\r\n\r\nask that their case should be judged not on the\r\n\r\nmerits of their religious beliefs but on the\r\n\r\nstrength of their arguments. We may agree or\r\n\r\ndisagree with their arguments, but we have no right\r\n\r\nto doubt the integrity of those who oppose it. I am\r\n\r\na Catholic. I am also opposed to abortions. I am\r\n\r\nopposed to abortions not because I am a Catholic -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> - but because I think it is\r\n\r\nwrong. Just as I am opposed to murder because I\r\n\r\nthink it is wrong. All Members of this House think\r\n\r\nthat murder is wrong too. You do not have to be a\r\n\r\nCatholic, or for that matter a Hindu, a Muslim or a\r\n\r\nBuddhist to think that abortion is wrong. I am\r\n\r\nopposed to a liberalised abortion policy because I\r\n\r\nthink this would be bad for our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very easy to write off the opposition to\r\n\r\nthis Bill as \"religious objections\".

They were fulfilling what\r\n\r\nthey considered to be their duty towards the State\r\n\r\nby expressing their genuine misgivings about the\r\n\r\nsocial consequences of this Bill. Instead of being\r\n\r\nglad and grateful that there are such people,\r\n\r\npeople who are concerned about the welfare of the\r\n\r\nnation, people with initiative to clarify their\r\n\r\nmisgivings, people with courage to express them,\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Health has seen fit to treat them\r\n\r\nwith ridicule and to brush them off with a cheap\r\n\r\nsmear, and I quote, \"although they of course did\r\n\r\nnot want openly to admit it.\" This sort of attitude\r\n\r\non the part of the Minister is hardly calculated to\r\n\r\nenhance the atmosphere of religious tolerance and\r\n\r\nmutual respect for which Singapore has been\r\n\r\nhitherto renowned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> By imposing your views on others?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Minister, you will have plenty of time to\r\n\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now refer to my next point on \"conscientious\r\n\r\nobjection\" which is in respect of clause 10 (2) of\r\n\r\nthe Bill. It is gratifying to note that the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee has made it clear that a statement under\r\n\r\noath or on affirmation will establish proof of\r\n\r\nconscientious objection. This is what the Minister\r\n\r\nsaid. However, in dealing with sub-clause (3) of\r\n\r\nclause 10, I am surprised to note that no\r\n\r\ncognisance appears to have been taken of the\r\n\r\ndoctor's responsibility towards the foetus. Once\r\n\r\nagain, it seems to be assumed that the foetus has\r\n\r\nno rights at all. In this connection, it seems to\r\n\r\nme that the Minister for Health has misinterpreted\r\n\r\na clause in the Declaration of Geneva, because\r\n\r\ntwice in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\ncourse  of  the  examination of the  witnesses,  he\r\n\r\nraised  this point. I refer to pages B78  and  B98,\r\n\r\nparagraphs 591 and 750. The Declaration  of  Geneva\r\n\r\nis,  in part, reproduced in paragraph 32 of Dr  S.\r\n\r\nR.  Salmon's  representation, Paper  No.  27.  This\r\n\r\nparagraph is in the Report at page A73. I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I will not permit considerations of religion,\r\n\r\nnationality,   race,  party  politics   or   social\r\n\r\nstanding  to  intervene  between  my  duty  and  my\r\n\r\npatient.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  think, Sir, the clear and obvious meaning to  it\r\n\r\nis  this.  I  will  not refuse to treat  a  patient\r\n\r\nbecause I disagree with his religion, or disapprove\r\n\r\nof his nationality or dislike his race or abhor his\r\n\r\npolitical views or consider his social standing  as\r\n\r\nbeneath me. In other words, it is talking about the\r\n\r\nreligion of the patient and not about that  of  the\r\n\r\ndoctor.  Furthermore, let us not  forget  that  the\r\n\r\ndoctor   who   has  conscientious   objections   to\r\n\r\nabortion, objects to abortion precisely because  he\r\n\r\nsees  it  as being against his duty to one  of  his\r\n\r\npatients. Sir, may I refer Members to page  A50  of\r\n\r\nthe  Select  Committee's Report?  Paragraph  10  of\r\n\r\nPaper No. 21 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As doctors we consider it our duty to safeguard\r\n\r\nthe  life  and  health of our patients.  What  non-medical  people apparently fail to realise is  that\r\n\r\nwhen a pregnant woman comes to a doctor, the doctor\r\n\r\nconsiders  that he has two patients to look  after.\r\n\r\nThis  is  not the opinion based on metaphysical  or\r\n\r\ntheological  speculation. This  is  a  simple  fact\r\n\r\nbased on scientific evidence.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, since the Minister for Health is so\r\n\r\nconcerned about the Declaration of Geneva,  I  wish\r\n\r\nthat he had also referred to another clause in  the\r\n\r\nDeclaration.  In  paragraph 32  of  Paper  No.  27,\r\n\r\nreproduced   on  page  A73  of  the   Report,   the\r\n\r\nDeclaration reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I will maintain the utmost respect for human life\r\n\r\nfrom the time of conception;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> When is that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Ask yourself.

Some people  think  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  undesirable, so we will make a few  minor\r\n\r\namendments  to placate them.

He  has\r\n\r\nliberated  them from unwanted pregnancies.  He  has\r\n\r\nalso  come  out  with  a solution  to  solving  the\r\n\r\ndelinquency  problem and improving the  quality  of\r\n\r\nchildren  to be born in future. This, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  sounds to me like the views of an  extremist,\r\n\r\nbecause  if we were to speak in the same manner  as\r\n\r\nhe  did  on  the point of liberating the rights  of\r\n\r\nthis  or  that category of persons, then  would  he\r\n\r\nconsider fighting for the rights of groups  of  men\r\n\r\nwho   would   want,  on  their  own,  to  patronise\r\n\r\nbrothels,  or  watch  obscene  films  without   the\r\n\r\nharrassment  of the police? There is at  present  a\r\n\r\nlaw against such type of entertainment which is, in\r\n\r\nfact, in the manner of the Health Minister, denying\r\n\r\nthe  rights of certain categories of our  citizens.\r\n\r\nIs   he  also  not  worried  about  the  rights  of\r\n\r\nthousands of women who perhaps for months and years\r\n\r\nhave been out of job and to whom we, as Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament, have had to attend sometimes  at  meet-the-people   sessions?  And   would   he   consider\r\n\r\nlegalising  prostitution, because that could  be  a\r\n\r\nvery  profitable profession today  in  our  present\r\n\r\nsituation?  But for him to speak as  he  did  would\r\n\r\nonly   incur  probably  the  displeasure  of  many,\r\n\r\nbecause there are such things as public morals  and\r\n\r\npublic concern for matters like this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also mentioned the solving of the\r\n\r\ndelinquency  problem, or something to that  effect.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  he  should  turn  his  attention  to   the\r\n\r\ndelinquency problem in England, and in places where\r\n\r\nabortion  is already legalised.

This is  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  all  this  while,  the  quality   of\r\n\r\nchildren born before the enactment of this Bill  is\r\n\r\nquestionable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now view the whole Bill\r\n\r\nas  it  stands. Leaving aside the minor  points,  I\r\n\r\nthink   the  Bill  can  be  reduced  to  two  major\r\n\r\nunderlying  principles, namely,  that  abortion  is\r\n\r\npermitted (1) on medical grounds, and (2) on socio-economic  grounds. The first principle  on  medical\r\n\r\ngrounds   would  also  include  cases  on   eugenic\r\n\r\ngrounds,  and cases of rape which could  result  in\r\n\r\nthe mental health being affected. This could be the\r\n\r\nmain underlying principle behind this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first principle, namely, on medical\r\n\r\ngrounds,  I think there is in existence today  some\r\n\r\nprovisions  in the Penal Code permitting  abortions\r\n\r\nto  be carried out under limiting circumstances  on\r\n\r\nmedical grounds. It may be necessary that the scope\r\n\r\nand  area in which an abortion could be carried out\r\n\r\non  medical  grounds should be extended. Therefore,\r\n\r\nany  feature of this Bill relating to the  question\r\n\r\nof  permitting  abortions  to  be  carried  out  on\r\n\r\nmedical grounds will find no objection from me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My objection, and what I consider as a very\r\n\r\nhighly  controversial point in this  Bill,  is  the\r\n\r\nclause that permits abortions to be carried out  on\r\n\r\nsocio-economic grounds. To begin with, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  term  \"socio-economic grounds\"  is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  to define and to assess. For example,  a\r\n\r\nmiddle-aged  couple may find it very  difficult  to\r\n\r\nhave  two  or  even  one child because  they  would\r\n\r\nprefer   to  have  a  car,  a  television  set,   a\r\n\r\nrefrigerator, and all the modern comforts of  life.\r\n\r\nAnd  if  they have a car, a television set,  and  a\r\n\r\nrefrigerator,  they would further prefer  a  bigger\r\n\r\ncar,   a   bigger  television  set,  and  a  better\r\n\r\nrefrigerator.  On the other hand, a couple  with  a\r\n\r\nlow income may find it quite acceptable to have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  than two or three children, because  they  do\r\n\r\nnot  care very much for the modern luxuries of life\r\n\r\nbut  they  care more for the love and affection  of\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families amongst the vast majority of workers in\r\n\r\nthe low-income group are too large because they  do\r\n\r\nnot  believe in family planning. I think the  right\r\n\r\nstep to take to help reduce the plight and size  of\r\n\r\nsuch families in the low-income group is to step up\r\n\r\nthe  family planning campaign and to make a genuine\r\n\r\neffort  to get these big families in the low-income\r\n\r\ngroup to participate in family planning programmes.\r\n\r\nBut  to do it through abortion will, I think,  lead\r\n\r\nto  a  great  deal of other complications,  because\r\n\r\nabortion  is not as simple a matter as the  removal\r\n\r\nof an appendix but an operation that involves wider\r\n\r\nimplications.  Abortion  means  the  removal  of  a\r\n\r\nfoetus.  Whatever our religious views  are  on  the\r\n\r\nstatus  of the foetus, no one can deny that  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  source  of life, a potential life.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nits removal is not a matter to be taken lightly. It\r\n\r\nis precisely because of our respect for the foetus\r\n\r\nirrespective  of  whether it is life  itself  or  a\r\n\r\npotential life, and because we hold a high  respect\r\n\r\nfor  life itself that we should be very careful  in\r\n\r\ntaking any step that will cause disrespect for  the\r\n\r\nfoetus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said already both from within and\r\n\r\nfrom  without  this  House on the  implications  of\r\n\r\nabortion, and I feel it is not necessary for me  to\r\n\r\nrepeat  all the arguments against the complications\r\n\r\nand   implications  of  such  a  move.  My   point,\r\n\r\ntherefore, Mr Speaker, is that abortion is  not  a\r\n\r\nsimple matter. It has other repercussions and other\r\n\r\nimplications.  We  will allow  an  abortion  to  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out only under very good grounds.  But  to\r\n\r\nlegalise  abortion  and to allow  abortions  to  be\r\n\r\ncarried out on socio-economic grounds will lead  to\r\n\r\nmany  serious undesirable results. Because of that,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  not  convinced  by  the\r\n\r\nevidence   appearing  in  the  Select   Committee's\r\n\r\nReport, and I do not think that the speech  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health can change my views  on  this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Abortion Bill was read\r\n\r\na  Second time in this House, I did not speak on it\r\n\r\nbecause  I thought many of my colleagues  here  had\r\n\r\nalready  expressed their views. I  had  hoped  that\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Bill was considered in Select Committee,\r\n\r\nGovernment  would accept the views of the  majority\r\n\r\nand would introduce certain amendments to the Bill.\r\n\r\nBut  after  the Bill had been considered in  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee and brought up for Third Reading in  this\r\n\r\nHouse, I find that the Select Committee's Report is\r\n\r\nvery disappointing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My views on this Bill centre on two points.\r\n\r\nFirst,  I  would like to give my views as a  woman.\r\n\r\nSecond, in respect of the future of our country,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to give a warning. All of you  are  not\r\n\r\nwomen.  Of  course, all of you think that  whatever\r\n\r\nyou  want  to  do,  you can and  will  do  it.  For\r\n\r\nexample,   when   Government   wanted   to   reduce\r\n\r\npopulation   growth,  it  implemented  the   family\r\n\r\nplanning campaign. This is beneficial to the future\r\n\r\nof  our  country as well as to the family. In  this\r\n\r\nrespect, women have sacrificed a great deal. In the\r\n\r\nwhole  process of family planning, those  adversely\r\n\r\naffected  are the women. Whenever you are free,  go\r\n\r\nto  the family planning clinics and you will find\r\n\r\nthat those who go there are women, not men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our women have played their part for the country.\r\n\r\nThis fact is well recognised by the country and the\r\n\r\npeople   themselves.  Quite  often  it   has   been\r\n\r\nemphasised that, in terms of population growth, the\r\n\r\nfamily planning campaign is a great success because\r\n\r\nit  has  managed  to reduce the population  growth.\r\n\r\nThis  should  be a source of great satisfaction  to\r\n\r\nall of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government does not sufficiently\r\n\r\naccept   the   success  of  this  family   planning\r\n\r\ncampaign. Instead it is proposing to adopt  another\r\n\r\ncourse  of  action, i.e., when a woman is  pregnant\r\n\r\nand  does  not  want  the baby,  she  can  have  an\r\n\r\nabortion. According to the Minister for Health, the\r\n\r\nprocess is painless\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand will not affect the mother's health. Perhaps it\r\n\r\nis  because he is not a woman that he does not know\r\n\r\nhow  it  feels.  Whether  the  performance  of   an\r\n\r\nabortion  is painful and whether it is damaging  to\r\n\r\nthe mother's health, only a woman can tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us consider this Bill very carefully. Those\r\n\r\nwomen  who go for abortions usually come  from  the\r\n\r\nlower  income group, i.e., their standard of living\r\n\r\nis  poor.  Quite  often they lack  the  nourishment\r\n\r\nnecessary after an abortion. If we move from family\r\n\r\nplanning  to abortion, then I am afraid  that  more\r\n\r\npregnant women will go for abortion, and in the end\r\n\r\nthose  who suffer will not be the fathers  but  the\r\n\r\nmothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nmentioned  that  from  the point  of  view  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy of the country it is necessary to curb  the\r\n\r\npopulation  growth of the country.  Since  we  have\r\n\r\nrecognised  the  fact  that  the  family   planning\r\n\r\ncampaign  has been successful, why must we  pass  a\r\n\r\nBill  to  legalise abortion? By doing so,  we  will\r\n\r\nencourage  people  to  do  things  which  are   not\r\n\r\nbeneficial to the country. We can see that in  many\r\n\r\ncountries  they  have  not found  it  necessary  to\r\n\r\nlegalise  abortion  in order to  reduce  population\r\n\r\ngrowth  and  thus  improve  the  economy  of  their\r\n\r\ncountry.  They  do not rely on the legalisation  of\r\n\r\nabortion  to  raise  the living standard  of  their\r\n\r\npeople.  Take China as an example. We can say  that\r\n\r\nit  is  the most heavily populated country  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  But  its economy is also one  of  the  most\r\n\r\nstable.  Why is this so? Why cannot we  learn  from\r\n\r\nthe  example of China as well as of other countries\r\n\r\nin  our effort to improve our economy and raise the\r\n\r\nliving  standard of our people? Why must we take  a\r\n\r\nretrogressive  step  by  introducing  the  Abortion\r\n\r\nBill? It is not an act of a responsible government.\r\n\r\nThe  Singapore  Government has  already  emphasised\r\n\r\nthat we must try to establish our prestige in South-east Asia. At the same time, we must also try to be\r\n\r\na  model  country in South-east Asia.  But  are  we\r\n\r\ntrying to establish ourselves as a model country by\r\n\r\nthis  Abortion Bill? If the Government thinks  that\r\n\r\nour population is too big and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat it is having an adverse effect on our economy,\r\n\r\nwhy  does  it not kill some people? Is this  not  a\r\n\r\nbetter  way? Legalisation of abortion is tantamount\r\n\r\nto  murder. But it is not a direct form of  murder.\r\n\r\nIt  is an indirect form of murder. If we go through\r\n\r\nwith  this  Bill,  then in time  to  come  we  will\r\n\r\nrealise  that what we are doing now is wrong.  From\r\n\r\nthe  short-term point of view, it may appear to  be\r\n\r\nthe  correct course of action. But from  the  long-term  point  of view, it is wrong. We must  try  to\r\n\r\neducate  our  people not only on sex  but  also  on\r\n\r\nevery  other  aspect of life. That  is,  make  them\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  problems arising out  of  a  large\r\n\r\nfamily  and  their effects on the  economy  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry.  This  is  what  a responsible  government\r\n\r\nshould   do.  The  P.A.P.  Government  should   not\r\n\r\nintroduce  this  Bill  and other  Bills  that  will\r\n\r\nencourage  promiscuous behaviour in our people.  We\r\n\r\nknow  that  our people conduct themselves  properly\r\n\r\nbecause they live in a society governed by law  and\r\n\r\norder. They realise that in a democracy there is  a\r\n\r\nlimit  to  their  freedom. But by introducing  this\r\n\r\nBill  to legalise abortion, we are giving them more\r\n\r\nfreedom. This is an undesirable action on the  part\r\n\r\nof the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to remind the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health that our women will  suffer  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal more if the Bill is passed.  We  should\r\n\r\nreconsider  it and take into account the  long-term\r\n\r\npoint  of view and its effect on the country  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in every democratic government,\r\n\r\nthe motivation for introducing new laws or changing\r\n\r\nold ones is based on two factors. First, it can  be\r\n\r\nthe  result  of a public outcry for  or  against  a\r\n\r\ncertain  matter.  The  second  factor  is  when   a\r\n\r\nsituation  is  so very critical that Government  is\r\n\r\ncalled  upon  to  introduce  emergency  laws.  With\r\n\r\nabortion,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, there  is  no  public\r\n\r\noutcry  for  the introduction of a  law.  Even  the\r\n\r\ndoctors themselves do not like the abortion law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  so  far  as the liberalisation of  abortion  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, I have a feeling that the law  is  cock-eyed  since  there  is  an Authorisation  Board  to\r\n\r\nterminate  pregnancy. We all know that  a  pregnant\r\n\r\nwoman or any woman who carries an unwanted baby  is\r\n\r\na  desperate woman and she will not submit  to  the\r\n\r\nembarrassment  of  presenting  herself  before  the\r\n\r\nAuthorisation  Board.  No  one  will  go   to   the\r\n\r\nAuthorisation Board. Women who are in a financially\r\n\r\nsound  position will see a private doctor. However,\r\n\r\nthose  who are poor will still resort to the  back-street  practitioners for an  abortion.  These  are\r\n\r\nfacts which we cannot deny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am a realist and I always speak with facts\r\n\r\nand  figures to back me up, unlike the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth who always speaks in abstract terms. Let  us\r\n\r\nlook at the figures of population growth in 1968. I\r\n\r\nam  quoting  from the Monthly Digest of  Statistics\r\n\r\npublished  by the Ministry of Labour in  1968.  The\r\n\r\nfigure  for  live  births in 1968  is  47,241.  The\r\n\r\nfigure  for  deaths in the same year is 10,982.  So\r\n\r\nfor  1968  we  have a net gain of  36,259.  Let  me\r\n\r\nproject  it for ten years, from 1969 to  1979.  The\r\n\r\npopulation  increase  will  only  be  360,000.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, 360,000 is a little bit more than one-third of a million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> What is the basis of your projection?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> On the same basis as the figure for 1968 where\r\n\r\nthe  difference in live births and deaths  gives  a\r\n\r\nnet gain of 36,259, Assuming that this rate remains\r\n\r\nconstant, in ten years' time our country will  have\r\n\r\nan increase in population of only 360,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> What is the basis of your assumption?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> This is no assumption, Mr Speaker.

At first, I was rather anxious  to\r\n\r\nhear  some  more new points that they  might  bring\r\n\r\nforward  to oppose the Bill. But, unfortunately,  I\r\n\r\nfind that they have repeated the familiar arguments\r\n\r\nin  opposition  to  the Bill and  it  has  left  me\r\n\r\ngreatly disappointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Any new point would have fallen on deaf ears!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> However, may I just say this? After listening to\r\n\r\nthe  very  ardent speech by the Member for Punggol,\r\n\r\nmay  I  say  that  I  do admire his  doggedness  in\r\n\r\nopposing  this Bill? He did not, as expected,  lose\r\n\r\nany opportunity to oppose this Bill once again even\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\non  its Third Reading. I do respect his persistence\r\n\r\nand  the courage of his convictions in speaking out\r\n\r\nquite  loudly  and strongly against it.  But  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  I cannot likewise have similar respect  for\r\n\r\nthe  cogency  of  his arguments in opposing  it.  I\r\n\r\nadmire  all  the more his dogged opposition  to  it\r\n\r\nsince I have every reason to believe that his  last\r\n\r\nstand  against it must necessarily end  up  in  the\r\n\r\ndust-bins of history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I take the arguments of Members one at a\r\n\r\ntime?  To  begin with, of course, I must  give  the\r\n\r\nhonour  to the Member for Punggol. In his argument,\r\n\r\nhe  did say that out of the 29 representations made\r\n\r\non  the  Bill in Select Committee, 21 were  against\r\n\r\nthe  inclusion of the socio-economic clause or  the\r\n\r\nenvironmental  clause  in the  Bill.  I  think  his\r\n\r\nargument  is  that there was strong  opposition  to\r\n\r\nthis    clause   judging   by   the    number    of\r\n\r\nrepresentations made on it. May I just  remind  him\r\n\r\nthat  the multiplicity of representations does  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  mean the strength of  the  opposition.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  if  you just look  at  some  of  the\r\n\r\naddresses  of the representations in opposition  to\r\n\r\nthe Bill, you will find that a number came from the\r\n\r\nsame  address. Two of them came from 96 Bras  Basah\r\n\r\nRoad  and  three of them came from  76  Bras  Basah\r\n\r\nRoad,  but,  of course, under different  names  and\r\n\r\ndifferent labels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> That is very unfortunate!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I hope my point is quite clear. The other point\r\n\r\non  which  the  Member for Punggol  did  express  a\r\n\r\ncertain  amount  of  sorrow  is  that  the   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  did not think fit to debate whether  the\r\n\r\nfoetus  has  a right to life or whether  it  should\r\n\r\nhave  human  rights like anyone of us. This,  as  I\r\n\r\nhave  said  again and again, will involve ourselves\r\n\r\nin   the  argument  which  primarily  springs  from\r\n\r\nreligious  and  ethical  considerations.  When  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Punggol made this assertion, he  forgot\r\n\r\none medical fact - that, as far as I know, from the\r\n\r\nmedical  point of view, the foetus  is  not  yet  a\r\n\r\nhuman  being, and as such, logically,  how  can  it\r\n\r\nhave human rights?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol did take strong exception\r\n\r\nto my remark that some of the opposition comes from\r\n\r\npersons  who  take their stand in  accordance  with\r\n\r\ntheir  religious persuasion, although they  do  not\r\n\r\nwant to admit it openly. I suppose it would suffice\r\n\r\nfor me to say that the truth does hurt. Some of the\r\n\r\nopponents  to the Bill say that they do not  oppose\r\n\r\nit  on  religious or ethical grounds, but  when  we\r\n\r\nexamine their arguments more deeply, we are sure to\r\n\r\nfind that they revolve around certain religious  or\r\n\r\nethical dogmas. I have said this in my introductory\r\n\r\nspeech and I do not think I need go further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol made a great deal of play\r\n\r\non  The Sunday Times report of \"baby bonuses\" which\r\n\r\nwas  attributed to a speech made by  my  colleague,\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Communications. May I say this? My\r\n\r\ncolleague's prediction that Singapore may  have  to\r\n\r\noffer  baby  bonuses to mothers in the  late  1970s\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the great success in slowing  down  of\r\n\r\npopulation  growth  in  Singapore,  is  in  no  way\r\n\r\ninconsistent  with  the  main  objectives  of   the\r\n\r\nAbortion Bill. The Member for Punggol thought  that\r\n\r\nit  was  a  bonus  for him to use  it  against  the\r\n\r\nAbortion  Bill. I am afraid he is under  a  serious\r\n\r\nmisconception   again.  I  have  time   and   again\r\n\r\nreiterated that it is not the purpose of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nto  be  used  as  a  means of  population  control.\r\n\r\nHowever, time and again, some opponents of the Bill\r\n\r\nwho,  of  course, include not only the  Member  for\r\n\r\nPunggol  but also the Members for Delta, Anson  and\r\n\r\nBras Basah, have tried the all too familiar tactics\r\n\r\nof  labelling  it as such so as to find  sufficient\r\n\r\narguments  to  oppose the Bill. This, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  only  serves  to indicate the  bankruptcy  of\r\n\r\ntheir arguments against the Bill. May I just repeat\r\n\r\nonce again that the main purpose of the Bill is  to\r\n\r\nliberate  our  women from the tyranny  of  unwanted\r\n\r\npregnancies, and that, as far as is possible, every\r\n\r\nchild born in Singapore will be a wanted child  who\r\n\r\nwill be cared for so that he can grow up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto lead a meaningful life. This Bill will also be a\r\n\r\ntremendous  aid and will complement our efforts  to\r\n\r\nhelp  our people plan their families. Any reduction\r\n\r\nin the birth rate as a result will be an incidental\r\n\r\nbenefit, and not the main purpose of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have emphasised before, and I repeat, the\r\n\r\nrelationship between family planning by the use  of\r\n\r\ncontraceptive  methods  and legalised  abortion  is\r\n\r\nlike  that between prevention on the one  hand  and\r\n\r\ncure  on  the  other. There will be a close  tie-up\r\n\r\nbetween  the  administration of the  Abortion  Bill\r\n\r\nwhen   it  becomes  law  and  the  national  family\r\n\r\nplanning programme. The family planning staff will,\r\n\r\nwhen  this  Bill  is implemented,  interview  every\r\n\r\nwoman  who  has  been granted an  abortion  in  the\r\n\r\nhospital,  as  they do now, and encourage  them  to\r\n\r\ntake  up  family  planning.  If  a  woman  has  not\r\n\r\nsubsequently    adopted   family   planning,    the\r\n\r\nTermination  of  Pregnancy Authorisation  Board  is\r\n\r\nlikely  to  take  an  extremely  dim  view  of  any\r\n\r\nsubsequent application by a woman for an  abortion.\r\n\r\nThe  recommendation for abortion  from  the  Family\r\n\r\nPlanning   and   Population  Board,  supported   by\r\n\r\nevidence  of  the practice of family  planning  and\r\n\r\nother records, will make it very easy for women  to\r\n\r\nget  an  abortion in case of contraceptive failure.\r\n\r\nFurther,  I have already stated that the Government\r\n\r\nhas decided to make a woman with three or more live\r\n\r\nchildren  accept  voluntary  sterilisation   as   a\r\n\r\ncondition for the authorisation of abortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to clear any further\r\n\r\nmisconceptions, perhaps I should explain here  what\r\n\r\nfamily  planning  means. Family planning  does  not\r\n\r\nmerely mean restriction of population growth.  What\r\n\r\nit,  in  fact,  means is that a  couple  who  adopt\r\n\r\nfamily  planning  plan not only  the  size  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily  but  also when pregnancy should  occur,  so\r\n\r\nthat they can have children when they want them.  I\r\n\r\nhope  that  disposes  of  the  misconceptions.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  if misconceptions are doggedly adhered  to\r\n\r\non  grounds of dogmas, I do not think I can go  any\r\n\r\nfurther!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which the Member for Punggol\r\n\r\nbrought  up was when he waved a copy of The  Sunday\r\n\r\nTimes showing a picture of people adopting unwanted\r\n\r\nbabies.  I  think his point is that there  will  be\r\n\r\npeople  to  adopt  these unwanted babies  and  that\r\n\r\nthese  unwanted  babies  will  provide  solace   to\r\n\r\nchildless couples. But the fact remains that  these\r\n\r\nbabies are unwanted babies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to the conscientious objection clause,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Punggol pointed out that, according\r\n\r\nto  him,  the  doctor's responsibility towards  the\r\n\r\nfoetus should be given due consideration. That is a\r\n\r\nfamiliar  argument brought up by him. He  keeps  on\r\n\r\nharping on the foetus. By doing so, he forgets  the\r\n\r\nplight  of  the unfortunate pregnant mother.  As  I\r\n\r\nhave   stated  in  my  introductory  speech,   this\r\n\r\npreoccupation  with  the  right  of   the   foetus,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, ends up in lack of consideration for\r\n\r\nthe  mother.  As  I  have also stated  before,  the\r\n\r\nCatholic dogma is that the foetus has the right  to\r\n\r\nlife.  This assumption can put the Catholic  doctor\r\n\r\nin  a  moral  dilemma -to choose between destroying\r\n\r\nthe  foetus in order to save the mother's life,  or\r\n\r\nallowing  the mother to die in the hope  of  saving\r\n\r\nthe  foetus.  This  Catholic preference  for  doing\r\n\r\nnothing to assist the mother, in fact, amounts to a\r\n\r\npreference of the foetus over the mother,  and  may\r\n\r\namount to a sentence of death for both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to the principles of the Declaration of\r\n\r\nGeneva   where   a   doctor   should   not    allow\r\n\r\nconsiderations of religion, political  affiliation,\r\n\r\netc.,  to  come  between him and his  patient,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Punggol very cleverly used a  twist  by\r\n\r\nsaying  that these principles refer to the religion\r\n\r\nof political affiliation of the patient and not the\r\n\r\ndoctor.  But  how do you split this? Will  not  the\r\n\r\nreligious  and ethical conviction of the doctor  be\r\n\r\nequally relevant?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the Member for Anson. He\r\n\r\nintroduced  in his last remarks a very  interesting\r\n\r\npoint  about compulsory birth control, but  he  did\r\n\r\nnot  elaborate  on it. Members will  remember  that\r\n\r\nfive   days   ago   the  Member   for   Anson   was\r\n\r\ncongratulated by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  for  Law  on  the  courage  of  his\r\n\r\nconvictions  when he raised a lone  voice  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  against  the abolition of the  jury  system.\r\n\r\nSir,   it  would  be  amiss  on  my  part  not   to\r\n\r\ncongratulate  him  similarly on raising  his  voice\r\n\r\nagainst the Abortion Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I\r\n\r\nthink  he  has just repeated the familiar  argument\r\n\r\nthat  abortion  will  lead to promiscuity.  I  have\r\n\r\nalready  replied to the same point he  made  during\r\n\r\nthe   Second  Reading  of  the  Bill.  Will  family\r\n\r\nplanning  by contraceptive means not also encourage\r\n\r\npromiscuity if his argument is correct?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now come to the Member for Ulu Pandan? He\r\n\r\nhas  quite  categorically stated that after  having\r\n\r\nread  the Select Committee's Report he has come  to\r\n\r\nthe   conclusion,  a  very  strong  conclusion,   I\r\n\r\nsuppose,  that he is now against the Bill, although\r\n\r\nhe  abstained from voting on the Second Reading. He\r\n\r\nhas  also  made certain remarks that the  Bill  has\r\n\r\nbeen  introduced  because  Government  intends   to\r\n\r\nencourage tourism. Mr Speaker, Sir, I do  not  see\r\n\r\nwhat  relevance  tourism has to the Abortion  Bill.\r\n\r\nAlthough  an  old man, perhaps he has  allowed  his\r\n\r\nimagination to run riot. Further, he harps  on  the\r\n\r\ntheme  that  the Abortion Bill has been  introduced\r\n\r\nfor  the  purpose  of population control.  On  this\r\n\r\npoint,  I do not wish to repeat what I have already\r\n\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the Member for Moulmein, he repeats\r\n\r\nthe  familiar argument and says that if we legalise\r\n\r\nabortion,  then what about legalising  prostitution\r\n\r\nor  allowing the viewing of blue films? This  point\r\n\r\nagain  is repetitious.

It is\r\n\r\nnow  left for me to conclude. But before I  do  so,\r\n\r\nmay I just raise one particular point not mentioned\r\n\r\nby the Members of this House?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A letter was recently published in the press. It\r\n\r\nexpressed  concern  that the Select  Committee,  by\r\n\r\nagreeing  to add the word \"serious\" to qualify  the\r\n\r\nrisk  to life or injury to the physical and  mental\r\n\r\nhealth  of the pregnant women in clause 5 (2)  (a),\r\n\r\nhas made it impossible for the unmarried college or\r\n\r\nworking girl, caught with an unwanted pregnancy, to\r\n\r\nhave  an institutionalised abortion. This is indeed\r\n\r\na  serious  misconception of  the  meaning  of  the\r\n\r\nproposed amendment, and should not be allowed to go\r\n\r\nunrefuted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only the writer of this letter had read my\r\n\r\nspeech carefully, it would have been quite clear to\r\n\r\nhim  that the amendment was on the medical  reasons\r\n\r\nfor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  an  abortion may be authorised.  As  I  have\r\n\r\nexplained,  it may probably restrict  the  area  of\r\n\r\nmanoeuvre of the medical practitioners, but it does\r\n\r\nserve to clarify the position of this provision. It\r\n\r\ndoes  not  in  any  way  affect  the  environmental\r\n\r\ngrounds on which an institutionalised abortion  may\r\n\r\nbe  authorised. As a matter of fact,  it  has  been\r\n\r\nenvisaged that the case of unmarried mothers, which\r\n\r\nthe  writer  of the letter was so concerned  about,\r\n\r\nwould normally come under the environmental clause,\r\n\r\ni.e.,  clause  5 (2) (b). In fact, when  discussing\r\n\r\nthe environmental reasons for authorising abortions\r\n\r\nin my speech moving the Second Reading of the Bill,\r\n\r\nI stated that common examples would be, and I quote\r\n\r\n[Hansard Vol. 28, No. II dated 8-4-69, col. 864]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'When the pregnancy will bring about social ruin as\r\n\r\nwhen  the woman is unmarried, is deserted  or  when\r\n\r\nshe is on the threshold of a career;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>However,  I  would  like to say  that  the  concern\r\n\r\nexpressed by the writer for the plight of unmarried\r\n\r\nmothers  is indeed admirable, and I would  like  to\r\n\r\nassure  him that it is well taken care  of  in  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to reiterate\r\n\r\nthat the central purpose of the Bill is to liberate\r\n\r\nour women from the tyranny of unwanted pregnancies.\r\n\r\nIt  will  serve to ensure that, as far as possible,\r\n\r\nevery  child born in our Republic will be a  wanted\r\n\r\nchild  who  will  have  the  opportunity  of  being\r\n\r\nproperly  nurtured and educated, so  that  whatever\r\n\r\ngood  qualities he has inherited will be  developed\r\n\r\nto  their full capacity so that he can grow  up  to\r\n\r\nlead  a  meaningful life and contribute his maximum\r\n\r\nto  our society.

As   defined   in   the\r\n\r\noriginal text, the surgical removal of the  female\r\n\r\nor  male reproductive organs would all come  under\r\n\r\nthe  purview of this Bill. It was pointed out that\r\n\r\nthis  was  too broad a definition. The  definition\r\n\r\nhas,  therefore, by the amendment, been restricted\r\n\r\nto  exclude the removal of such organs  which  are\r\n\r\nessential  for  reasons of medical treatment.  The\r\n\r\nsuggestion  was  made  by  Professor  L.C.

Under this amendment, sterilization of a\r\n\r\nwoman  by the ligation of the tubes may be  carried\r\n\r\nout  immediately after birth or at  the  same  time\r\n\r\nwhen  an  abortion is performed. This is the  usual\r\n\r\npractice  now.  The  operation  of  tubal  ligation\r\n\r\nimmediately  after  birth  is  a  very  simple  one\r\n\r\ncompared to the same operation if performed  later.\r\n\r\nThe  provisions  of the Bill as it stands,  without\r\n\r\nthis amendment, would prevent such an operation  to\r\n\r\nbe  carried  out immediately and could  defeat  the\r\n\r\npurpose of sterilizing persons when it is so simple\r\n\r\nand  safe to do. If these persons have to wait  for\r\n\r\n30  days  at  least  before the  operation  can  be\r\n\r\ncarried out, the operation is much more difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have said before,\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  together with its  companion  Abortion\r\n\r\nBill  when they become law, will liberate our women\r\n\r\nfrom  the  tyranny  of unwanted  pregnancies.  They\r\n\r\nhave,  therefore, been rightly described  as  Bills\r\n\r\nrelating to human rights.
