The  Government  is  not\r\n\r\nafraid of supplying the 7 or 8 million gallons  per\r\n\r\nday, and supplying it free. It is not the cost that\r\n\r\nworries us. It is the wastage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am sure that Members of this House\r\n\r\nhave  seen on many an occasion someone washing  his\r\n\r\nlorry or motor-bike, or using a long tube from  the\r\n\r\nstandpipe  to his house about 500 yards  away,  and\r\n\r\nusing  the water for domestic purposes - that would\r\n\r\nbe  well  and good. But normally they  use  it  for\r\n\r\ntheir  motor-cars, their lorries and  their  motor-bikes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have reached a stage in Singapore where we\r\n\r\nfind  it  most  inadvisable  to  put  in  any  more\r\n\r\nstandpipes. In fact, we intend to reduce the number\r\n\r\nof  standpipes  as far as possible. This  does  not\r\n\r\nmean that we will not supply water; instead we will\r\n\r\nsupply  it  direct  to  every house  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhether  that  house is authorised or unauthorised,\r\n\r\nnumbered or unnumbered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangab)</b> rose -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

It was full of life and vigour. The  Budget\r\n\r\nfor 1967, like the one for last year, is a balanced\r\n\r\none.  Although  the Government  does  not  seek  to\r\n\r\nincrease  taxes,  yet  it is able  to  balance  its\r\n\r\nbudget.  It has also been able to get a surplus  of\r\n\r\n$5-odd  million, and $30 million is transferred  to\r\n\r\nthe  Development Fund. When we analyse this budget,\r\n\r\nwe  will  find  that there are more surpluses.  For\r\n\r\nexample, we have contributed a sum of $23.3 million\r\n\r\nto  the International Monetary Fund and a sum of $1\r\n\r\nmillion  to the World Bank. And these two  sums  of\r\n\r\nmoney are meant for investment in order to boost up\r\n\r\nour  economic development. These two items are  not\r\n\r\nrecurrent  expenditure. There are some items  which\r\n\r\nhave  been  increased. For example, the development\r\n\r\nitem  for Education. This year, the item was  $15.8\r\n\r\nmillion,  but  for next year the  amount  voted  is\r\n\r\n$26.5  million, an increase of about $10.7 million.\r\n\r\nThis  is  an  increase of 68 per cent.  The  amount\r\n\r\nvoted  for the Ministry of the Interior and Defence\r\n\r\nthis year was $33.67 million, but for next year the\r\n\r\namount  to  be  voted  will be $78.89  million,  an\r\n\r\nincrease of about -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Therefore, there is a  further\r\n\r\nimprovement in our national financial situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the countries around us in South-East Asia. Whenever a budget is brought into\r\n\r\nParliament, whenever a Finance Minister tables  his\r\n\r\nbudget, he will have either to increase taxation or\r\n\r\nborrow money from other countries. As a result, his\r\n\r\ncountry's  foreign debt will accumulate. Therefore,\r\n\r\nit  is  small wonder that our Finance Minister  has\r\n\r\nsaid that, as the Finance Minister for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo  successive years, he has been fortunate enough\r\n\r\nto be able to maintain a balanced budget and end up\r\n\r\neven  with a small surplus. I feel that it  is  not\r\n\r\nonly  the good fortune of the Finance Minister  but\r\n\r\nit  is  also the good fortune of all the people  in\r\n\r\nour  Republic. We do not have to worry,  as  people\r\n\r\nelsewhere   do,  whether  we  will  have  increased\r\n\r\ntaxation whenever the Government tables its budget.\r\n\r\nThe  fundamental spirit of the budget  is  that  of\r\n\r\nprogress  in  the midst of stability.  This  is  no\r\n\r\nexaggeration. This budget incorporates the elements\r\n\r\nof   encouragement,  vigour  and  the  spirit   for\r\n\r\nbetterment.  This is evident from  the  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates which total about $411 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as a Government which professes\r\n\r\nto  carry  out democratic socialism,  there  is  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that the purpose of our economic development\r\n\r\nis  not  just for the benefit of a few capitalists.\r\n\r\nIt is not to widen the gap between the rich and the\r\n\r\npoor  so that the rich becomes richer and the  poor\r\n\r\nbecomes  poorer. If this were so, then our economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  would  lose  its  meaning.   What   is\r\n\r\nsignificant in our economic development?  What  are\r\n\r\nits  objectives? I am of the view that the  purpose\r\n\r\nof  economic  development  is  to  consolidate  our\r\n\r\nnational  economy. It should boost up  our  economy\r\n\r\nand raise the standard of living of our people.  It\r\n\r\nshould  create  more  job  opportunities  for   our\r\n\r\npeople. In other words, the benefits accruing  from\r\n\r\neconomic  development should be shared  equally  by\r\n\r\nall the people. Only thus can it be compatible with\r\n\r\nthe  principle of democratic socialism.  Only  thus\r\n\r\ncan we carry out, step by step, our high ideals  of\r\n\r\ndemocratic socialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past five years, because\r\n\r\nof the active encouragement given by the Government\r\n\r\nin  the  field of industrial development,  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  able to create 58,000 more jobs. Nonetheless,\r\n\r\nthere  are  still  about  60,000  people  who   are\r\n\r\njobless.  They  are waiting for us  to  help  them.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  unemployment is still a  very  critical\r\n\r\nand grave social problem in our nation. As\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Finance Minister has said, unless we can during\r\n\r\nthe  coming five years reduce this spectre then all\r\n\r\nthe economic gains would be lost in the turmoil  of\r\n\r\nsocial and political unrest. He has also said  that\r\n\r\nover  the  next  five  years, from  1966  to  1970,\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  need not only  to  wipe  out  the\r\n\r\nbacklog  of  the  existing  unemployed,  but   also\r\n\r\nprovide  another 95,000 jobs for our  youths.  They\r\n\r\nwould be leaving schools and seeking entry into the\r\n\r\nlabour  market.  Therefore,  it  is  not  a   small\r\n\r\nproblem.  It  involves  the very  survival  of  our\r\n\r\nnation. Five years from now, if we are not able  to\r\n\r\nsolve this grave problem of unemployment, then  our\r\n\r\npeople  will suffer and all construction programmes\r\n\r\nwill have to come to a standstill. Our struggle for\r\n\r\ndemocratic socialism will come to a critical stage.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we must concentrate all our efforts  and\r\n\r\ngo  all out to expand our industrial programme.  We\r\n\r\nshould  also expand our trade to provide more  jobs\r\n\r\nfor   our  people  in  order  to  solve  the  grave\r\n\r\nunemployment problem. Only thus can we realise  the\r\n\r\nideals of democratic socialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to talk on the\r\n\r\nsubjects of industrial progress and external  trade\r\n\r\nand  to  offer my views on them. Undeniably in  the\r\n\r\npast  one  year our industrial programme under  the\r\n\r\nguidance of the Economic Development Board has made\r\n\r\ngood  progress. Let me now quote a certain  portion\r\n\r\nof  the  speech by the Minister about  the  pioneer\r\n\r\nindustry.  He  says  there are  about  165  pioneer\r\n\r\nindustries. In 1964 there were only 113. At present\r\n\r\nabout  103 are already in production, while 33  are\r\n\r\nin  various stages of implementation. By  September\r\n\r\n1966  the total investment of these pioneer  firms,\r\n\r\nin  terms  of  fixed assets, has  grown  from  $255\r\n\r\nmillion  at  the  end of 1965  to  more  than  $300\r\n\r\nmillion,  showing an increase of $45  million.  The\r\n\r\ntotal value of output of these firms is expected to\r\n\r\nreach  $450  million  this  year  as  against  $318\r\n\r\nmillion  in  1965,  showing  an  increase  of  $132\r\n\r\nmillion.  In terms of employment, the total  number\r\n\r\nof workers in pioneer firms has grown from 5,400 at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  1964 to 12,000 today, an increase  of\r\n\r\nmore than 120 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, we can see that our industrial programme\r\n\r\nhas been carried out in practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that in the past two or three years\r\n\r\ncertain  ignorant politicians, including the  anti-national  Barisan  Sosialis, have  made  statements\r\n\r\nmocking our industrial programme. They ridiculed it\r\n\r\nsaying that it would be a flop. They said that  the\r\n\r\nJurong industrial estate was a stretch of bleak and\r\n\r\ndesolate land; but now, after a few years, this so-called  bleak and desolate land has become a  grand\r\n\r\nindustrial  town, with chimneys springing  up  here\r\n\r\nand  there. The Jurong industrial estate  has  been\r\n\r\nable to earn a large amount of foreign exchange for\r\n\r\nus.  I  do not know what is their reaction  to  the\r\n\r\npresent  site at Jurong now. The reasons  for  such\r\n\r\nsuccess are that, firstly, the Government has  been\r\n\r\nactively   encouraging  and  promoting   industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  The  Economic Development  Board  has\r\n\r\nbeen  giving  all  sorts of aid to  the  investors,\r\n\r\nincluding  industrial  financing,  and  a  tax-free\r\n\r\nperiod  of  five  years.  Secondly,  there  is  the\r\n\r\neconomic and social stability in our country,  plus\r\n\r\nour advantageous geographical position. All this is\r\n\r\nconducive  to  confidence  and  investment  in  our\r\n\r\ncountry.  Thirdly,  there is labour  stability.  We\r\n\r\nhave  quite a lot of skilled workers. In  the  past\r\n\r\nfew  years, under the guidance of the N.T.U.C., our\r\n\r\ndemocratic trade unionism has been put on the right\r\n\r\ntrack  and workers in various sections of  industry\r\n\r\nhave   been  better  organised.  No  doubt,  labour\r\n\r\nstability   is   a  very  important  factor   which\r\n\r\ncontributes   to   the   success   of    industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment, because with the help of large  armies\r\n\r\nof labour, we will be in a better position to carry\r\n\r\nout  our industrial programme and to boost  up  our\r\n\r\noutput.  But, at the same time, we must also  treat\r\n\r\nthe  workers well. This is our basic task. In  this\r\n\r\nfield,  I believe the N.T.U.C. will look after  the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, according to the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister, in the past five years, although we have\r\n\r\nbeen able to create 58,000 more jobs for our people\r\n\r\nby industrial development, we still fall short of\r\n\r\nthe number envisaged, which is 70,000 jobs. We are\r\n\r\nstill short of about 12,000 jobs. This goes to show\r\n\r\nthat our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  programme has  not  reached  the\r\n\r\nanticipated  target and we have to strive  further.\r\n\r\nMuch  more  effort must be made and better  schemes\r\n\r\nmust be devised. More incentives must be devised to\r\n\r\nhelp  industrialisation, such as those  which  have\r\n\r\nbeen announced by our Finance Minister, in order to\r\n\r\ndevelop  our  pioneer industry  in  the  next  five\r\n\r\nyears,  and to cope with our unemployment  problem.\r\n\r\nWe  are  glad  to hear of the three new  incentives\r\n\r\nannounced  by our Finance Minister which have  been\r\n\r\nwell  received  by  our businessmen  and  investors\r\n\r\nalike.  With the passage of time, I hope a  lot  of\r\n\r\ninvestment  will go into our industry, either  from\r\n\r\nlocal  sources  or  from abroad. We  welcome  their\r\n\r\nactive   participation  in  our   industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that the international\r\n\r\nmarket has become highly competitive. Therefore, we\r\n\r\nmust  try  our  best to raise the  quality  of  our\r\n\r\nproducts  and  to  lower costs. Only  thus  can  we\r\n\r\ncompete with products from other countries. Another\r\n\r\nmethod  to  market our produce is to encourage  our\r\n\r\npeople  to  use  locally-manufactured  goods.   The\r\n\r\nEconomic  Development Board and  our  manufacturers\r\n\r\nshould  jointly  hold  trade fairs  and  industrial\r\n\r\nfairs  in order to introduce and sell our goods  to\r\n\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the increase in productivity, as far\r\n\r\nas I know, certain factories in Jurong have started\r\n\r\na campaign to raise output and yields. They do this\r\n\r\nby  giving  cash  and other encouragement.  On  the\r\n\r\nother   hand,   the  N.T.U.C.,  the  Manufacturers'\r\n\r\nAssociation and the Employers' Federation have also\r\n\r\ndrafted a charter for industrial progress in  order\r\n\r\nto  guide and encourage the growth of productivity.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of democratic socialism,  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in  output and profit must be accompanied\r\n\r\nby  an  increase  in wages, because our  industrial\r\n\r\nprogramme  can be successful only if  the  benefits\r\n\r\nare mutually shared by management and labour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me review our external trade. According\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister for Finance, our  external  trade\r\n\r\nexport  and  import  trade -  totals  about  $7,200\r\n\r\nmillion.  This  is an increase and  the  reason  is\r\n\r\nthat,  firstly,  we have pursued a non-aligned  and\r\n\r\nneutral foreign policy and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  have been able to gain the respect of countries\r\n\r\nall over the world. Many countries have established\r\n\r\nfriendly  trade  links with us. We  have  not  only\r\n\r\nmaintained our links with our old friends in trade,\r\n\r\nbut    have    also   established   new    friendly\r\n\r\nrelationships, including trade relationships,  with\r\n\r\nour  new  friends,  including  countries  such   as\r\n\r\nRussia,  America,  Britain, Bulgaria  and  Hungary.\r\n\r\nThey  have all concluded trade treaties with us  on\r\n\r\nequal  terms, and African countries are  continuing\r\n\r\nto  trade with us. Indonesia has now discarded  its\r\n\r\nconfrontation policy and has resumed trade with us.\r\n\r\nThis   will   encourage  our  trade   and   further\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  our economic prosperity.  Secondly,\r\n\r\nour   favourable   and  advantageous   geographical\r\n\r\nposition  will be a great help. We are situated  at\r\n\r\nthe  hub  of South-East Asia and at the cross-roads\r\n\r\nof  Europe  and Asia. We have favourable conditions\r\n\r\nfor  a trading centre in South-East Asia, plus  our\r\n\r\nharbour which can accommodate big steamers of up to\r\n\r\nthousands of tons. On top of this we have very good\r\n\r\nharbour   facilities  and  banking  and   insurance\r\n\r\nfacilities. All these contribute to our  being  the\r\n\r\ntrading  centre of South-East Asia. It  is  not  an\r\n\r\naccident of history. In fact, our port is the fifth\r\n\r\nlargest  in  the  world. It  has  contributed  very\r\n\r\ngreatly to our economic life and prosperity and has\r\n\r\nearned for us a lot of foreign exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I want to talk about public construction by\r\n\r\nthe Government. The development in this respect has\r\n\r\nbeen  rapidly carried out. The building of bridges,\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  roads and various  projects  will\r\n\r\nrequire  millions  of dollars.  Many  projects  are\r\n\r\nnearing completion. When the road linking Connaught\r\n\r\nDrive and the Katong area is completed, the traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion in this area will be relieved. There are\r\n\r\nexpansions   of  road  surface  and  other   public\r\n\r\nprojects. All these will tend to solve our  traffic\r\n\r\nproblem. The Government's vote for the Public Works\r\n\r\nDepartment next year amounts to $34.8 million. This\r\n\r\nis  a  large  sum of money. This will be  used  for\r\n\r\nvarious projects in both the rural and urban areas.\r\n\r\nOne of the projects will be construction work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  alleviate the flood situation in certain areas,\r\n\r\nand  this  will  be good news to the  residents  in\r\n\r\nthese areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on another point -\r\n\r\neducation. The vote for Education for next year  is\r\n\r\nthe  highest, amounting to $143 million. Other than\r\n\r\nrecurrent expenditure, $26.5 million will  be  used\r\n\r\nto  set up primary and secondary schools to develop\r\n\r\nfurther  our education. From this we can  see  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is paying great attention  to  our\r\n\r\neducation problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year's vote for Health will be $4 million,\r\n\r\nwhich will provide medical facilities to take  care\r\n\r\nof  the  health of our people. The vote for  social\r\n\r\nwelfare is $10 million for next year, which will be\r\n\r\nused to advance the welfare of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, the budget for next year is a very\r\n\r\nprogressive one. Judging from the point of view  of\r\n\r\ndemocratic  socialism, it is  an  ambitious  budget\r\n\r\nbecause  it  reflects  our  firm  determination  in\r\n\r\neconomic development. It also reflects our wish and\r\n\r\ndesire  to  promote the standard of living  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.  It also manifests our resolute spirit  and\r\n\r\nconfidence    in    marching   towards    a    more\r\n\r\nindustrialised  and modernised  Republic.  I  fully\r\n\r\nsupport the Government's budget for next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the  budget,  introduced   by   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance and after  its  publication,\r\n\r\naccording  to  what I have learnt,  has  been  well\r\n\r\nreceived  by our society. We know that our Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  wants to build an ideal  society  and\r\n\r\nachieve  economic  prosperity  in  Singapore.   His\r\n\r\nambition  and  desire have been reflected  in  this\r\n\r\nbudget.  On the whole, it is a successful  one  and\r\n\r\nshould be supported by all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In discussing it, we normally have two things to\r\n\r\nconsider. One is to maintain the balance of revenue\r\n\r\nand  expenditure. The other is to project into  the\r\n\r\nfuture   to  see  whether  the  various  items   of\r\n\r\nexpenditure    can   meet   our    basic    minimum\r\n\r\nrequirements, and whether it is possible to make or\r\n\r\nwhether  we  have  already made  full  use  of  our\r\n\r\neconomic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncapacity  and have tapped every possible source  of\r\n\r\nrevenue. On these various aspects I would  like  to\r\n\r\nair my views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the budget of a country should not\r\n\r\nonly  contain economic significance but should also\r\n\r\nembody  political as well as cultural significance.\r\n\r\nThe  Communists regard cultural revolution  as  the\r\n\r\npre-requisite to political revolution and  economic\r\n\r\nrevolution - as a guiding force for the two or as a\r\n\r\nprecursor to them. Ours is not a Communist country.\r\n\r\nIn  this initial period of nation-building,  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  have very strong inclinations towards cultural\r\n\r\nconstruction and we have not placed it  on  top  of\r\n\r\neconomic construction. But it does not mean that we\r\n\r\nmust   entirely   neglect  cultural   construction.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  feel  that  the  contents   of   the\r\n\r\nMinister's  Budget  Statement  in  regard  to   the\r\n\r\ncultural  aspects should be reviewed. The  vote  in\r\n\r\n1967   for  Culture  and  Social  Affairs  is  $4.3\r\n\r\nmillion. Compared with $7.6 million for 1966, it is\r\n\r\nnearly half of the previous vote. The Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  has explained that it is because  a  large\r\n\r\npart of the previous vote was spent on the building\r\n\r\nof  T.V. and Radio stations before 1966; they  were\r\n\r\nthe  major  projects then. Therefore, in  1967  the\r\n\r\nvote has been reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can also see from the budget that the vote for\r\n\r\ncultural    construction   for   1967    is    very\r\n\r\ninsignificant. In this respect, there is  provision\r\n\r\nonly for the setting up of a library in Queenstown.\r\n\r\nIt  is the only outstanding project and seems to be\r\n\r\nthe  only project in cultural construction in which\r\n\r\nGovernment is interested. I would like to point out\r\n\r\nthat  the  meaning  and  significance  of  cultural\r\n\r\nconstruction  are  not highlighted  in  the  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement.  Therefore, it is not quite  in  keeping\r\n\r\nwith  the  requirements of our present-day society.\r\n\r\nWe  need  to  give some consideration  to  cultural\r\n\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this budget and the various items of revenue\r\n\r\nwe  can see the general picture. For instance,  the\r\n\r\npossible  revenue  from the Victoria  Theatre  next\r\n\r\nyear  shows a significant decrease. Perhaps  it  is\r\n\r\ndue to the fact that next year the theatre will  be\r\n\r\nundergoing repairs,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresulting  in  the  decrease of revenue  from  this\r\n\r\nsource.  But revenue from criminal fines and  other\r\n\r\nfines has shown a marked increase. For instance, in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  Customs, the revenue will increase  by\r\n\r\n$90,000;  in respect of Public Works, the  increase\r\n\r\nwill be $20,000; in respect of various other items,\r\n\r\nthe amount to be derived from fines will amount  to\r\n\r\n$218,000.  This can only be explained by  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  culture  is  deteriorating, whereas  criminal\r\n\r\nactivities  are  on  the increase  and  this  is  a\r\n\r\nsymptom of deterioration in social morality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Tang See Chim in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allocation by Government for cultural\r\n\r\nactivities  is  very  small, but  the  estimate  of\r\n\r\nrevenue  from advertisements on T.V. and  Radio  is\r\n\r\nmuch  larger, about $5.3 million - an  increase  of\r\n\r\n$1.3  million over the previous year. This can only\r\n\r\nbe  explained  by the fact that the  Government  is\r\n\r\nmore  willing  to  add  some commercial  colour  in\r\n\r\ncultural  activities  and  is  not  interested   in\r\n\r\ndeveloping  culture itself. It is  praiseworthy  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government to make provision to build a branch\r\n\r\nlibrary  in  Queenstown.  But  our  development  in\r\n\r\nsociety  requires that the Government must  have  a\r\n\r\nnew  prison  in Queenstown at the same  time.  That\r\n\r\nmeans the prison and the library will be seen  side\r\n\r\nby  side, which is not a good sight for anybody  at\r\n\r\nall.  We  would  like to see more cultural  centres\r\n\r\ninstead  of more prisons in our society. Of course,\r\n\r\nwe  fully  appreciate that if one is not fully  fed\r\n\r\nand   clad,  one  cannot  talk  about  culture  and\r\n\r\nceremonies.  But  a  certain standard  in  cultural\r\n\r\ndevelopment  must be maintained in  order  to  keep\r\n\r\npace  with  economic development, otherwise  solely\r\n\r\neconomic  development will mean the  production  of\r\n\r\nmore  well-clad and fully fed nincompoops  who  are\r\n\r\ngood for nothing and uncultured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to economic progress, we must do our\r\n\r\nbest to have some kind of social education together\r\n\r\nwith  academic education for our citizens. Although\r\n\r\nwe have made great achievements and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\nprogress  in academic education, socially speaking,\r\n\r\nsocial education is still in a state of immaturity.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry  of  Culture has not  got  sufficient\r\n\r\nfinancial  resources to push forward  our  cultural\r\n\r\nmovement.  This is a defect which must be corrected\r\n\r\nin good time. The National Theatre is not receiving\r\n\r\nfinancial  aid  from  the  Government  because   of\r\n\r\ninsufficient  funds  allocated  for  the   cultural\r\n\r\nmovement.   Initially,  it   depended   on   public\r\n\r\ndonations.  As soon as the building was  completed,\r\n\r\npublic donations became rather unreliable, although\r\n\r\nthey  came in useful in the initial stage. Now that\r\n\r\nit  is in the self-development stage, the situation\r\n\r\nmay  arise  where  it is not enough  to  depend  on\r\n\r\npublic   donations   alone  for  its   development,\r\n\r\notherwise  we  will  be  in the  same  position  as\r\n\r\nNanyang  University,  which in  the  past  depended\r\n\r\nsolely  on  public  donations but  now  also  needs\r\n\r\ngovernment  aid.  Public donations  alone  are  not\r\n\r\nsufficient  to  maintain existing institutions  and\r\n\r\nthey  are not sufficiently of help to their further\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  The  present  situation   which   the\r\n\r\nNational Theatre faces should be an eye-opener  for\r\n\r\nus in cultural development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see from the Budget Statement that there are\r\n\r\nsigns  of  prosperity in economic  development  all\r\n\r\nround  Singapore.  We also hope that  in  the  next\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement  he  will be  able  to  add  some\r\n\r\ncultural  colour and instill optimism  in  cultural\r\n\r\nconstruction.  The  Budget  Statement  itself,   of\r\n\r\ncourse,  is  not very much concerned  with  culture\r\n\r\nbut, generally speaking, it is very encouraging.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to express my full support for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.06 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nSir, I would like to take this opportunity to raise\r\n\r\na few points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Singapore achieved independence, it has\r\n\r\nmade remarkable progress and development in various\r\n\r\nfields, such as economy, culture, education, health\r\n\r\nand  construction. Within a short year,  tremendous\r\n\r\nprogress in concrete form\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas   been  achieved.  Even  foreigners  who  visit\r\n\r\nSingapore are full of praise for Singapore. It is a\r\n\r\ncredit to the efforts put in by the Government. But\r\n\r\nas  the  Prime Minister has said, we  must  not  be\r\n\r\ncomplacent about our achievements so far.  We  must\r\n\r\nredouble  our  efforts  with  a  view  to   greater\r\n\r\nachievements. Therefore, I would like to take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to speak on some problems existing  in\r\n\r\nour country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question deals with capital which is a\r\n\r\ndriving  force  behind our economic activities.  We\r\n\r\nall  know  that the Economic Development Board  has\r\n\r\nplayed  a  very important and leading role  in  the\r\n\r\neconomic  development  of  our  country,  and   its\r\n\r\nachievements  are very impressive and  encouraging.\r\n\r\nIt  is clear that the Government has made very good\r\n\r\nprogress in encouraging capitalists to come in  and\r\n\r\ninvest. Certain concessions have been announced  to\r\n\r\nattract  more capitalists and foreign capital  into\r\n\r\nour  country. In the Budget Statement, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance: has said that he has been able to add\r\n\r\nto these concessions. He has announced that certain\r\n\r\nnew  concessions  will be made to  new  industries.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  wise move. I hope that both local  and\r\n\r\nforeign   capitalists  and  investors   will   take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of these concessions by coming  here  to\r\n\r\ninvest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one point which I would like to\r\n\r\nbring to the attention of the Government, and  that\r\n\r\nis   whether  it  has  been  able  to  attract  all\r\n\r\navailable  idle  capital into  industry.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  is  there not a great deal of idle  capital\r\n\r\nwhich is hesitant to come forward to invest because\r\n\r\nof  certain restrictions and requirements? This  is\r\n\r\nthe  question  we have to answer.  I  believe  that\r\n\r\ncapital  investment is a must for greater  economic\r\n\r\nprosperity.  But are we doing our best  to  attract\r\n\r\nall  available capital - idle or otherwise  -  into\r\n\r\nproduction in the interest of our national survival\r\n\r\nand  social  prosperity? Where it is necessary,  we\r\n\r\ncan  relax certain restrictions and regulations  so\r\n\r\nthat, within a short space of time, a great deal of\r\n\r\nhidden  idle  capital may also  be  attracted  into\r\n\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have discovered that there are two kinds of\r\n\r\nidle  capital which may be attracted into  industry\r\n\r\nto  boost our economic development. Firstly, people\r\n\r\nwho  have come to stay here have been residents for\r\n\r\nmany  years.  Some  of them have  become  permanent\r\n\r\nresidents while others have even become citizens of\r\n\r\nour  country.  These people have  accumulated  some\r\n\r\ncapital  outside  Singapore - in their  country  of\r\n\r\norigin.  If  they  are allowed to  bring  in  their\r\n\r\ncapital  from  outside for investment purposes,  it\r\n\r\nwill be a good thing for our economy. But so far as\r\n\r\nI am aware, these people have not transferred their\r\n\r\nliquid  assets from foreign countries to  Singapore\r\n\r\nto extend their business here or to invest in fresh\r\n\r\nenterprises. There is one factor which  makes  them\r\n\r\nhesitate to do this. If they transfer their foreign\r\n\r\ncapital  or  convert their foreign properties  into\r\n\r\nliquid  assets  here in Singapore,  the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  tax 40 per cent of their capital remitted  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  according to the income tax regulations.\r\n\r\nSo  a  great  deal of their capital is knocked  off\r\n\r\neven  before  it is invested locally. This  is  not\r\n\r\nvery  pleasant for them. Therefore, I feel that  in\r\n\r\norder  to  encourage more capitalists to invest  in\r\n\r\neconomic production, it is necessary - in  fact,  I\r\n\r\nwould say it is a prerequisite - in this context to\r\n\r\nrelax certain regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another kind of idle capital\r\n\r\ncomes  from  our  own people.  Some  of  them  have\r\n\r\ncapital  for  which  they  are  unable  to  account\r\n\r\nlegally because it may be difficult for them to  do\r\n\r\nso.  So  because  of  this necessity  for  them  to\r\n\r\naccount  for  their capital, it remains  idle.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, it is necessary for us to investigate\r\n\r\ninto the sources of income in certain respects, and\r\n\r\nI  do  not,  in fact, advocate that the  Government\r\n\r\nentirely  relaxes  all  the  regulations  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose.  But there are certain accomplished  facts\r\n\r\nin respect of which we may be able to relax certain\r\n\r\nregulations.  For example, some people  might  have\r\n\r\nacquired  money through illegal means or through  a\r\n\r\nwindfall.  But  because  of the  regulations  which\r\n\r\nrequire them to account for their capital, money or\r\n\r\nincome, they have to hide it away. So, in my  view,\r\n\r\nin order to give further\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimpetus  to our economic development, such  capital\r\n\r\nshould  be  made  use of. Certain  devices  may  be\r\n\r\nworked out to encourage people with such capital to\r\n\r\ncome  forward to invest. I would suggest that  some\r\n\r\nmeasures may be worked out so that within a  period\r\n\r\nof  six months people with unaccountable income  or\r\n\r\ncapital  may be allowed to invest within  limit  in\r\n\r\ncertain kinds of production. We will then have more\r\n\r\ncapital to develop economically. On the other hand,\r\n\r\nwe  can  also  prevent a lot of  capital  remaining\r\n\r\nidle.  This is a good thing to those who have  such\r\n\r\nidle  capital, and it is also a good thing  to  our\r\n\r\nnation  and  society as a whole.  I  believe  that,\r\n\r\napart   from  attracting  and  encouraging  foreign\r\n\r\ncapital,  our Government must also encourage  local\r\n\r\nand national capitalists to come forward to invest.\r\n\r\nSo  certain positive measures must be worked out to\r\n\r\nattract  this  frozen idle capital into  our  local\r\n\r\nproduction so that it will become useful capital. I\r\n\r\nmust,  of course, stress that, by so doing, we  are\r\n\r\nnot  going  to  encourage people in trying  to  get\r\n\r\nmoney  through illegal means, but in the past  some\r\n\r\npeople  did so. So if we encourage them by relaxing\r\n\r\ncertain  regulations for the time being  or  for  a\r\n\r\ncertain limited period of time, I think it will  be\r\n\r\na   more  realistic  approach.  Otherwise,  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance has said in his Annual  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement,   this  capital  would   invariably   be\r\n\r\ninvested  in  some finance companies  which  borrow\r\n\r\nmoney at high interest rates to be lent out in turn\r\n\r\nat even higher interest rates, thereby making these\r\n\r\nfinance companies a very risky enterprise, which is\r\n\r\nno  security  to the depositors. As  far  as  I  am\r\n\r\naware,  a lot of poor people have saved some  money\r\n\r\nand  deposited  it  in such finance  companies.  If\r\n\r\nthese  finance  companies do  not  have  sufficient\r\n\r\nfunds  and  are engaged in risky enterprises,  then\r\n\r\nthe  people who suffer will be the poor people  who\r\n\r\nhave  saved up some money and invested it in  these\r\n\r\nfinance  companies. It is, therefore,  praiseworthy\r\n\r\nthat   the  Finance  Minister  is  proposing   some\r\n\r\nlegislative action against these finance companies.\r\n\r\nBut  if the idle capital that I have mentioned just\r\n\r\nnow can be used gainfully, as I have suggested,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  a  lot of finance companies would not compete\r\n\r\namong themselves for more deposits at high interest\r\n\r\nrates,  and  at the same time the depositors  would\r\n\r\nhave  their  money  safely invested  in  productive\r\n\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to talk now about trade relations in\r\n\r\nAsia as a whole. As we all know, in the past decade\r\n\r\nit  has  been the international tendency to  switch\r\n\r\nfrom international and long-distance trade to short-distance local and regional trade. This is  because\r\n\r\nit  has been realised that it is important to  have\r\n\r\nregional  co-operation. Short-distance  trade  will\r\n\r\nsave  a great deal of financial and human resources\r\n\r\nand  time,  particularly in the case of a  backward\r\n\r\nand  emerging country. This kind of trade  must  be\r\n\r\nstrengthened and consolidated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our country is positioned in the central part of\r\n\r\nAsia and it is the gateway to the East and West. So\r\n\r\nour  fate is inseparable from that of the whole  of\r\n\r\nAsia. We have all the facilities and infrastructure\r\n\r\nfor  trade and commerce with other Asian countries.\r\n\r\nWe  are in a very advantageous position and  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  us to set up new trade  links  with\r\n\r\nother  countries and strengthen existing ones  with\r\n\r\nother  Asian  countries.  After  our  independence,\r\n\r\nseveral  trade missions have been sent  to  African\r\n\r\nand  East European countries, and, as a result,  we\r\n\r\nhave  concluded  several  trade  pacts  with  those\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one big country in Asia which has\r\n\r\nbeen  overlooked and with which we have no official\r\n\r\nrelations.  I refer to China which has a population\r\n\r\nof 700 million. This population provides us with  a\r\n\r\ntremendous  market  which  we  must  not  overlook.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly  we  must recognize  that  our  foreign\r\n\r\npolicy  is neutral and non-aligned. This is  in  so\r\n\r\nfar  as politics is concerned. But for our survival\r\n\r\nand for more prosperity, economically speaking, our\r\n\r\neconomic  activities must have a  wider  scope  for\r\n\r\nexpansion,  since  this  is  in  keeping  with  our\r\n\r\npolicy.  We  must  make friends with  more  people,\r\n\r\nirrespective  of their political ideology.  It  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  a  good thing that  we  should  set  up\r\n\r\ncommercial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  trade relations with China, which is  a  great\r\n\r\nnation in Asia. Whether it is for us to do business\r\n\r\nwith them or to sell our finished products to them,\r\n\r\nis  all  to our advantage. Perhaps some people  may\r\n\r\ncriticise  me  for  making this suggestion,  but  I\r\n\r\nwould  say  that if they do so, they are trying  to\r\n\r\nadd  political colour to purely economic relations.\r\n\r\nWe   want   to  survive.  We  want  to  have   more\r\n\r\nprosperity.  Therefore, it  is  necessary  that  we\r\n\r\nshould send some form of trade mission to China  to\r\n\r\nwin over this tremendous market for our country. We\r\n\r\nmust set up some kind of reciprocal trade relations\r\n\r\nwith China. This is necessary and essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the financial policy of\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.22 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have read\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  Statement by the Finance  Minister.

It is appreciated that if  each\r\n\r\nsector plays the role assigned to it, there can  be\r\n\r\nno  reason  why  we should harbour any  fears  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  will not solve not only its unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem  but  also set an example to  the  rest  of\r\n\r\nSouth-East  Asia, including our hostile  neighbour,\r\n\r\nthat we have really become a welfare State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is gratifying to note that the economy is\r\n\r\nforging  ahead with substantial increases in  gross\r\n\r\ndomestic product, external trade market, and so on.\r\n\r\nWhile   identifying  myself  with  the   sentiments\r\n\r\nexpressed by the Minister for Finance, I cannot for\r\n\r\na  moment  subscribe  to his undue  optimism  which\r\n\r\napparently is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot matched by a stroke of realism. I am not for  a\r\n\r\nmoment making any suggestion to the effect that  we\r\n\r\nare   misled   by   our  Finance   Minister,   but,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, as a Backbencher of the ruling  Party\r\n\r\n-  not  on the Opposition, of course and as a trade\r\n\r\nunion  leader who has the interests of the  working\r\n\r\nclass  at  heart, I cannot but express reservations\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to  the  Finance Minister's  approach\r\n\r\ntowards  the solution of confronting problems  that\r\n\r\nappear  to face Singapore both in the economic  and\r\n\r\npolitical spheres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is whether the economy can afford to\r\n\r\nproduce  more  or less the number of  new  jobs  to\r\n\r\nreduce   the   present   rate   of   increase    of\r\n\r\nunemployment, especially when we have  one  of  the\r\n\r\nyoungest populations in this region, and also  when\r\n\r\nwe recognise the fact that 10 to 15 per cent of the\r\n\r\neconomically  active population are  unemployed.  A\r\n\r\ncasual  look  at  the  speech with  regard  to  the\r\n\r\nunemployment figures appears to convince me that  -\r\n\r\nto borrow his own expression:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Singapore would need not only to wipe off the\r\n\r\nbacklog  of  the  existing  unemployed,  but   also\r\n\r\nprovide  another  95,000 jobs for our  youths,  who\r\n\r\nwould be leaving schools and seeking entry into the\r\n\r\nlabour market.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we add these figures, Mr Speaker, Sir, to the\r\n\r\nnumber  of unemployed at the end of 1965, that  is,\r\n\r\n56,300,  we  arrive at the shocking  figure, viz.,\r\n\r\n151,300 unemployed. The pioneer industries, the pet\r\n\r\nproject  of  our  Government, and our  people  have\r\n\r\nprovided jobs for only 12,000 up to today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'During the period 1961-1965, employment\r\n\r\nopportunities increased by 57,600 jobs.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, four very important facts appear to\r\n\r\ncrystallise  out of these figures provided  by  the\r\n\r\nFinance   Minister.  First  of  all,  the   pioneer\r\n\r\nindustries have only provided one-fifth of the  new\r\n\r\nemployment  available during the past  five  years.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we are faced with the tremendous task  of\r\n\r\nproviding  employment for 151,300 during  the  next\r\n\r\nfive  years. Thirdly, based on our past  experience\r\n\r\nas  well  as from the information provided  by  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister, if we keep up the present rate of\r\n\r\nan average of 11,520 jobs per year during the next\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfive years, even with our herculean efforts and our\r\n\r\nexcellent  optimism, we will only be in a  position\r\n\r\nto  provide new jobs for 57,600 people during 1966-1970. In other words, there will be a spill-over of\r\n\r\n93,700 in the labour market of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister has stressed the fact that\r\n\r\nthe   manufacturing   sector  alone   can   provide\r\n\r\nemployment during the next few years. Based on past\r\n\r\nperformances, the manufacturing industries can only\r\n\r\nprovide  new  employment for 5,729 per annum;  from\r\n\r\nhis  figures  which  I  have  taken  (47,217  minus\r\n\r\n41,488). Thus during the next five years the  total\r\n\r\nnew  employment opportunities in the  manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustries would be 28,645. I am not for  a  moment\r\n\r\nignoring   the  multiplier  effect  of   employment\r\n\r\nprovided    in    the   manufacturing   industries.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  I  would  rather  warn  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister that in his unwarranted optimism he  might\r\n\r\nbe  caught in the pitfalls of the economy. I wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  the manufacturing sector can really  raise\r\n\r\nthe  employment figures thrice in a matter of  five\r\n\r\nyears from today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have also to recognise the\r\n\r\nfact  that  every  year 19,000  teenagers  will  be\r\n\r\nentering  the labour market, based on  the  figures\r\n\r\nsupplied by the Finance Minister. I wonder  whether\r\n\r\nthe  present system of liberal education has \"tuned\r\n\r\nand   tailored\"  the  labour  force  to  meet   the\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  our industrialisation.  Otherwise\r\n\r\nyou  will have a very strange paradox that, on  the\r\n\r\none  hand,  you  will  have a  large  reservoir  of\r\n\r\nunemployed with a secondary education, and, on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  you will find a lack of  skilled  and\r\n\r\nsemi-skilled labour force. This situation  is  fast\r\n\r\ndeveloping in Singapore and I am glad to note  that\r\n\r\nthe  Finance  Minister has accepted  my  suggestion\r\n\r\nduring my criticism of the budget last year when  I\r\n\r\nadvocated   a   crash  programme   to   solve   the\r\n\r\nunemployment problem. I am all for gearing  up  the\r\n\r\npresent    educational   system   to    meet    the\r\n\r\nrequirements.  It  is high time  that  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  also  thinks in terms of incorporating  a\r\n\r\ntraining programme within plants and industries for\r\n\r\nproducing specialised labour. If the employers  and\r\n\r\nGovernment will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsider these suggestions, the unions in Singapore\r\n\r\nwill go all out to make it a success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding our industrialisation programme, while\r\n\r\ncongratulating the Finance Minister on initiating a\r\n\r\nbold  approach, I cannot give the seal of  approval\r\n\r\nof the trade union movement, especially with regard\r\n\r\nto   all  the  steps  to  increase  production.  We\r\n\r\ndefinitely  support  the  Government's  efforts  to\r\n\r\nattract   both  foreign  and  indigenous   capital.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  I would prefer to sound  a  note  of\r\n\r\ncaution  or  warning with regard to the quality  of\r\n\r\nforeign capital that enters the Singapore arena. We\r\n\r\ndo  not  want  to  encourage  those  entrepreneurs,\r\n\r\nwhether  they  are from Hongkong or Timbuctoo,  who\r\n\r\nwould  be only interested in exploiting labour  and\r\n\r\naccumulating  profits  on  the  basis  of   sweated\r\n\r\nlabour.  Many  of  them might have exhausted  their\r\n\r\nquotas  in  foreign market from their countries  of\r\n\r\norigin,  and these birds of passage might  consider\r\n\r\nSingapore as a convenient place for exploitation of\r\n\r\nlabour  and  building up new quotas. This  type  of\r\n\r\ncapital is unlikely to be helpful to the economy or\r\n\r\nthe  larger  interests of this nation in  the  long\r\n\r\nrun.  Hence,  I will be extremely grateful  if  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister can give an unqualified assurance\r\n\r\nto  the  labour force in this country that  in  his\r\n\r\nenthusiasm  to  create  a  climate  favourable  for\r\n\r\nforeign  capital,  he  will  not  follow  a  policy\r\n\r\nconsistent  with  a Gladstonian economy.  Unless  a\r\n\r\ncategorical assurance is given to the workers,  the\r\n\r\npossibility of our co-operation is rather remote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister's advocacy for a\r\n\r\nproductivity  drive  is well taken  by  the  labour\r\n\r\nforce.  But  he  should realise that  labour  alone\r\n\r\ncannot increase productivity. Secondly, even  in  a\r\n\r\nplant  or  industry where the productivity  is  not\r\n\r\nhigh,  it  need  not necessarily mean  that  labour\r\n\r\nshould be held responsible. Low productivity  might\r\n\r\nbe   due   to   inefficient,   unqualified   family\r\n\r\nmanagement,  which employs cousins and nieces,  and\r\n\r\nexcessive    investment   on    overheads,    wrong\r\n\r\npredictions   made  by  the  entrepreneurs,   large\r\n\r\ninventory  due to lack of understanding of  market,\r\n\r\nabsence of specialised\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nskill due to inadequate training programme  of\r\n\r\nthe  industries,  and so on. The  possibility  does\r\n\r\nexist  of an industry even with 100 per cent labour\r\n\r\nefficiency which is still unable to make the grade.\r\n\r\nSo  why  blame  only  labour  for  not  helping  to\r\n\r\nincrease  productivity? Hence it is high  time  the\r\n\r\nTreasury  benches  refrain from  the  over-emphasis\r\n\r\nthat  labour  should further tighten  its  belt  to\r\n\r\nincrease  productivity.  Labour,  of  course,  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  co-operate in  increasing  efficiency\r\n\r\nprovided  the  management will answer the  question\r\n\r\n\"At  what  price  do  you want labour  to  increase\r\n\r\nproductivity?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder what the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  had  in mind when he mentioned  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  hold  \"a  fair  balance   between\r\n\r\nmanagement  and  labour\". If he  had  in  mind  any\r\n\r\ndecision  to be made by the Government, ipso  facto\r\n\r\nto  be  accepted and implemented by labour,  he  is\r\n\r\nsadly  mistaken.  Any unilateral  approach  coupled\r\n\r\nwith  the  hysteria  of \"industrialisation  at  any\r\n\r\ncost\" would be completely rejected by labour if  it\r\n\r\namounts to the exploitation of the interest of  the\r\n\r\nworking  class.  I am greatly disappointed  at  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance with regard to his budget  for\r\n\r\n1967   making  no  provision  for  its  daily-rated\r\n\r\nemployees. The Finance Minister knew full well that\r\n\r\nthe 1961 collective agreement solemnly entered into\r\n\r\nbetween  the  management as  an  employer  and  the\r\n\r\nPublic Daily-Rated Employees Unions Federation  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  implemented by the authority. During  my\r\n\r\nbudget speech last year, after the Finance Minister\r\n\r\nhad  presented his budget, I made the case for  the\r\n\r\ndaily-rated  Government employees  quite  explicit,\r\n\r\nand  I  was  under  the impression  that  he  would\r\n\r\nintroduce  the necessary provision in  this  year's\r\n\r\nbudget  which  will  meet the requirement  of  this\r\n\r\nparticular  case. But, unfortunately,  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister, who quoted Dr Benham last year to reject\r\n\r\nthe demand of the Government daily-rated employees,\r\n\r\nhas  maintained a Sphinx-like silence this year  by\r\n\r\nmaking  no  provision  in the  budget  estimate  in\r\n\r\nmeeting the requirement under the terms of the 1961\r\n\r\nagreement. In short, are we supposed to come to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconclusion  that  when the Government  attests  its\r\n\r\nsignature  to  any  agreement as  an  employer,  it\r\n\r\ndeserves to be treated as a scrap of paper and that\r\n\r\nimplementation  of a collective agreement  is  only\r\n\r\napplicable  to the private sector and  not  to  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector?  If Government can flout  its  past\r\n\r\nagreements and assurances, I do not see any  reason\r\n\r\nwhy a private employer should not follow suit. I am\r\n\r\nextremely doubtful how we can increase productivity\r\n\r\nwith  a  dissatisfied, disillusioned and  disgusted\r\n\r\nlabour  force. It is high time the Finance Minister\r\n\r\nand the Prime Minister wake up from their \"slumber'\r\n\r\nand  prove  to the workers that they do believe  in\r\n\r\nthe expression, \"Industrial Peace With Justice\".  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  say here in this  House,  for  the\r\n\r\ninformation of Members, that today the situation in\r\n\r\nregard  to  the  dispute between the Public  Daily-Rated   Employees   Unions   Federation   and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  explosive.  If  we  cannot  find  a\r\n\r\nsolution, then there is no way out, they are  going\r\n\r\non  strike. If you have read the editorial  of  the\r\n\r\nSin   Chew  lit  Poh  yesterday,  even  the   paper\r\n\r\nsuggested,  \"Why cannot both parties  get  together\r\n\r\nand talk and negotiate, and if they cannot talk and\r\n\r\nnegotiate, why cannot the Government send this case\r\n\r\nto  the  court?\" Now the Government says,  \"No,  we\r\n\r\nwill break the strike.\" Suppiah says, \"We are going\r\n\r\non strike and let you break it.\" So, where do we go\r\n\r\nfrom here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> On a point of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> We are not on Government-labour\r\n\r\nrelationship.

If  my\r\n\r\nrecollection   is   correct,  Mr   Ho,   you   are\r\n\r\nanticipating  something for which you  have  got  a\r\n\r\nQuestion  down for tomorrow or the day  after,  and\r\n\r\nthere  is a Standing Order against anticipation  of\r\n\r\nmatters that are coming up in some other form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shudder to\r\n\r\nthink  that, as in 1962, the same thing will happen\r\n\r\nagain  within two or three weeks' time. All of  you\r\n\r\nare aware that in 1962 Singapore was plunged into a\r\n\r\nstate of chaos. You saw night-soil vans overturned,\r\n\r\nheaps of rubbish everywhere. Do we want to see this\r\n\r\nkind  of  situation  happen?  So  why  cannot   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  refer  this matter to  the  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt?  Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said,  how  can\r\n\r\nyou expect labour to increase productivity? Further\r\n\r\nit  is highly unrealistic to suggest that the wages\r\n\r\nof  daily-rated employees, who have put in 5 to  20\r\n\r\nyears'  service in the different Ministries, should\r\n\r\nbe  compared with the existing rate in  the  labour\r\n\r\nmarket,  before  a  decision could  be  taken  with\r\n\r\nregard to wage revision. In that case, applying the\r\n\r\nsame principle, I wonder whether the senior boys in\r\n\r\nthe  Treasury,  who might have helped  our  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister to prepare the budget, would be willing to\r\n\r\naccept  salaries consistent with the existing  rate\r\n\r\nin  the  labour market for a fresh Honours graduate\r\n\r\nfrom  a  university.  I do not  believe  they  will\r\n\r\naccept  the  rate. So why blame the  public  daily-rated workers? Perhaps our Government, particularly\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister and the Finance Minister,  will\r\n\r\nprovide    the    necessary    candle-power     for\r\n\r\nenlightenment. Give an explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While stressing on the so-called fair balance\r\n\r\nbetween management and labour and the necessity  to\r\n\r\nprovide basic facilities, the Finance Minister  has\r\n\r\nnot  sufficiently emphasised the role of the  State\r\n\r\nEconomic   Consultative   Council   which    should\r\n\r\nnecessarily  be  the  back-bone  in  smoothing  the\r\n\r\nprocess of industrial relations. So far it has  not\r\n\r\nbeen that effective and it is high time the Council\r\n\r\nis  rejuvenated  and  that more sub-committees  are\r\n\r\nformed within the orbit of the Consultative Council\r\n\r\nso   that   problems   in   industrial   relations,\r\n\r\nproductivity   and   so   on,   affecting   labour,\r\n\r\nmanagement or the Government can be thrashed out in\r\n\r\nan atmosphere of understanding and appreciation. It\r\n\r\nwill  relieve  tension and also help  in  exploring\r\n\r\nmore  avenues  of co-operation so that  labour  and\r\n\r\nmanagement   can  form  a  basis  of  understanding\r\n\r\nwithout losing their respective identities.  It  is\r\n\r\nmy fervent hope\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government will take the  initiative  in\r\n\r\nthis  direction if it sincerely wants  to  smoothen\r\n\r\nthe process of industrialisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to industrialisation, it is gratifying to\r\n\r\nnote  that  the Finance Minister has  accepted  the\r\n\r\ncrash   programme   which  I  advocated   in   this\r\n\r\nParliament a year ago. But he should remember  that\r\n\r\nhe has to take into account two factors, namely:  a\r\n\r\npolicy with regard to raw materials and markets.  A\r\n\r\nfew   among   our  industries,  like  the   plywood\r\n\r\nindustry,   depend   on  our  neighbour   for   raw\r\n\r\nmaterials.  A  situation is fast developing  where,\r\n\r\nwith  open  hostility,  our neighbour  is  exerting\r\n\r\neconomic  pressure on us with a view  to  crippling\r\n\r\nour  economy. So we should look elsewhere  for  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials.  If  we are not careful about  this,  it\r\n\r\nmight  result  in  a  ban  on  the  supply  of  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials  which  in turn might  create  jerks  and\r\n\r\njolts  in  our  economy. Under  such  conditions  I\r\n\r\nwonder whether it is possible in future to think in\r\n\r\nterms  of  establishing industry with raw  material\r\n\r\nfrom  abroad at competitive rates so that  we  will\r\n\r\nnot  face  a  situation with the sword of  Damocles\r\n\r\nhanging over our head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further in his speech the Minister for Finance,\r\n\r\nwhile   quoting   facts   and   figures   of    the\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  programme,  has  not  told  this\r\n\r\nHouse  whether any market survey has been conducted\r\n\r\nby  the  Economic  Development  Board.  Without   a\r\n\r\nknowledge  of and understanding backed by  relevant\r\n\r\nfacts and figures of international markets for  our\r\n\r\nproducts,  we are unlikely to make much headway  in\r\n\r\nour  industrialisation programme. I am quite  eager\r\n\r\nto   know  what  steps  have  been  taken  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in this direction and where they  stand\r\n\r\nwith regard to markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister appears to have gloated over\r\n\r\nthe  fact that the Gross Domestic Product  in  1965\r\n\r\nhas  increased  by $206 million to $3,017  million,\r\n\r\nrepresenting  the rate of growth of  7.3  per  cent\r\n\r\nover 1964. While admitting the fact\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  economy  is surging forward,  we  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to relax as Socialists unless and until  we\r\n\r\nhave  relevant and reliable information with regard\r\n\r\nto  the distribution of income. If the increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  rate of growth has not resulted in eliminating\r\n\r\ninequalities but perpetuating them we cannot afford\r\n\r\nto  congratulate him on presenting these attractive\r\n\r\nfigures before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, speaking in general terms the\r\n\r\nBudget  for  1967 is rather pragmatic and  also  is\r\n\r\nconsistent    with    our   general    policy    of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation. The allocation  for  development\r\n\r\nexpenditure and the fund reserved for education and\r\n\r\nsocial services are sufficient, bearing in mind our\r\n\r\nfinancial resources and also our goal for a  better\r\n\r\nand  more prosperous Singapore. Further the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  has not introduced new taxes  which  will\r\n\r\nhit  the  less privileged class in Singapore.  From\r\n\r\nthat  point  of view, I must say that  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  may get all the bouquets from the  common\r\n\r\nman.  Nevertheless,  the people  of  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nlikely to watch every step the Government takes  in\r\n\r\nimplementing its programme and I only wish that  in\r\n\r\nits  over-enthusiasm during the transformation from\r\n\r\nan  entrepot economy to an industrialised State, it\r\n\r\nwould  not  sacrifice the interests of the  working\r\n\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nstanding  here  to  give a little  bouquet  to  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister, not like my colleague, the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember for Bras Basah, who is giving him additional\r\n\r\ngrey  hairs with his speech! The second  budget  of\r\n\r\nthe independent Republic of Singapore presented  by\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. Minister for Finance in the House on  5th\r\n\r\nDecember marks a better and brighter future for our\r\n\r\nnational economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is also gratifying to note that he has\r\n\r\npresented a surplus budget in this House at a  time\r\n\r\nwhen  quite  a  number of developing countries  are\r\n\r\nhaving a deficit budget session at this moment.  To\r\n\r\na newly independent, stable and progressive society\r\n\r\nlike ours, such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  fiscal  policy  adopted by the Finance  Minister\r\n\r\nwould  encourage  more economic activity,  and  the\r\n\r\ninvestment  is beneficial to our initial  stage  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  development. The 1967 Budget  not  only\r\n\r\ngives the public a sense of economic stability  and\r\n\r\nprosperity,  but  also  a  sense  of  security  and\r\n\r\nsurvival of our country in this turbulent  part  of\r\n\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, it would be a sound\r\n\r\nand  efficient  fiscal policy for our  budget  next\r\n\r\nyear  if  it  was not for the increase  of  driving\r\n\r\nlicence  fees.  This  affects all  driving  licence\r\n\r\nholders. Furthermore, it directly affects the  wage\r\n\r\nearners  and lower income group. The rich will  not\r\n\r\nmind  this  increase, but the poor  and  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  group,  like those who  earn  a  living  as\r\n\r\nirregular  or part-time drivers, will experience  a\r\n\r\ncorresponding fall in their income. Therefore, they\r\n\r\nwill  be  shouldering an additional  burden.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  Sir, the very poor and lower income  group\r\n\r\nseems  to pay a somewhat larger proportion of their\r\n\r\nincome  than  the  middle and  upper  income  class\r\n\r\ngroups. It may not be the intention of the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister to add another burden to the lower  income\r\n\r\ngroup  just  to get an additional revenue  of  $1.8\r\n\r\nmillion. But the fact is that with such a  fall  in\r\n\r\nthe  income of this lower income group, there  will\r\n\r\nbe  less butter and bread for their families.  Sir,\r\n\r\nhow   can   the  desired  standard  of  living   be\r\n\r\nmaintained   in  such  a  state?  With   his   wide\r\n\r\nexperience and knowledge of economics, the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister could have easily found alternative  means\r\n\r\nto  raise  the  additional revenue of $1.8  million\r\n\r\nfrom  sources such as luxury products, e.g., whisky\r\n\r\nand  brandy, which all the rich men drink  and  not\r\n\r\nthe  poorer men, instead of increasing this driving\r\n\r\nfee licence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all in all, I think the 1967 Budget is a\r\n\r\nvery  sound  one  and  I wish to  congratulate  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

If  we do not impose a similar  rise  as\r\n\r\nMalaysia has done, our economy will be affected.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  our Minister would not have increased  the\r\n\r\ntax  if  Malaysia had not already  done  so.  After\r\n\r\nSingapore became an independent State, its progress\r\n\r\nhas been remarkable, which is due to the efficiency\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister for Finance. This is commendable.\r\n\r\nThere  is  every prospect that we will continue  to\r\n\r\nprosper in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to associate\r\n\r\nmyself   with  the  sentiments  expressed   by   my\r\n\r\ncolleagues who have supported the Budget  Statement\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister for Finance. We  see  it  as  the\r\n\r\ninitial  budget  of  a budding nation.  Though  our\r\n\r\nnation   lacks  natural  resources,  it   has   the\r\n\r\ndetermination  and  has  taken  positive  steps  to\r\n\r\ndevelop and protect the interest of our people  and\r\n\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the indulgence of the Minister, I wish\r\n\r\nto  speak  on a few points in the Budget Statement.\r\n\r\nIt  is  noted  that the annual rate of increase  in\r\n\r\nGross  Domestic Product during the period  1960  to\r\n\r\n1965  is  only 8.5 per cent, and that in  1965  the\r\n\r\ngross capital formation increased by 11.8 per  cent\r\n\r\nover 1964, accounting for about 15 per cent of  the\r\n\r\nGross Domestic Product.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is encouraging to note the frankness of the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance in admitting that this  falls\r\n\r\nshort  of the 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent rate  of\r\n\r\ncapital  accumulation which is considered necessary\r\n\r\nfor self-sustaining growth in developing countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is noted from the external trade\r\n\r\nfigures  that  the re-export of goods has  declined\r\n\r\nfrom  37.9  per cent in 1964 to 36.2  per  cent  in\r\n\r\n1965.  Although  it may be argued  that  a  certain\r\n\r\npercentage  of imported goods have to  be  retained\r\n\r\neither   as  raw  materials  or  capital  equipment\r\n\r\nrequired  for  new and developing  industries,  the\r\n\r\nfigures of import valued at $3,017.9 million during\r\n\r\nthe first nine months of this year as compared with\r\n\r\nexports  amounting  to  only $2,494.6  million  are\r\n\r\nquite   disconcerting.   They   show   a   definite\r\n\r\nunfavourable balance of trade, despite an  increase\r\n\r\nof 13.3 per cent in exports over last year. If this\r\n\r\ntrend continues, we shall soon be a nation in debt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I trust that with the establishment of\r\n\r\ndirect trading relations with other countries, as a\r\n\r\nresult  of  visits  of  their  trade  missions   to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and with the possibility of  resumption\r\n\r\nof  trade with Indonesia, there will be hope for an\r\n\r\nexpansion of our external trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget Statement shows an external\r\n\r\nreserve  of  $1,038 million - an increase  of  $123\r\n\r\nmillion  over last year. It also shows an  external\r\n\r\ndebit  account of $61.75 million - an  increase  of\r\n\r\n$2.75 million over last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the separation of currency in June next\r\n\r\nyear,  though  our currency will be  supported  and\r\n\r\nissued at par value of our external reserves,  with\r\n\r\nthe  unfavourable balance of trade and the  payment\r\n\r\nof  interest on international loans, there is  fear\r\n\r\nthat  there  may be a considerable depreciation  of\r\n\r\nour   external  reserves  unless  proper  care   is\r\n\r\nmaintained  and our external trade and  balance  of\r\n\r\npayments are watched very carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has a population which is nearing\r\n\r\ntwo  million and more than half of this  population\r\n\r\ncomprise young people. In addition, 40,000 children\r\n\r\nare  born  every year and about 20,000 are  leaving\r\n\r\nschool yearly to look for jobs and swell the  ranks\r\n\r\nof our unemployed every year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the efforts of the Minister for Health\r\n\r\nin  advocating family planning are praiseworthy,  I\r\n\r\nwonder  to what extent does he really believe  that\r\n\r\npopulation  growth can be controlled by  Government\r\n\r\neffort to push through contraceptives?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, bearing in mind our ever-increasing\r\n\r\npopulation,   we  are  faced  with  the   attendant\r\n\r\nproblems of providing more houses, more schools and\r\n\r\nmore jobs. These are really domestic problems.  But\r\n\r\nour improved port facilities should be utilised  to\r\n\r\nprovide  employment opportunities  and  sources  of\r\n\r\nrevenue  for  our  Republic.  Exports  have  to  be\r\n\r\nincreased  so that we will be able to pay  for  the\r\n\r\nconsumer goods imported for the use of our  growing\r\n\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the next subject I would like\r\n\r\nto  touch  upon is rural development. Although  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance in his Budget Speech has  laid\r\n\r\nstress  on  the importance of industrial and  urban\r\n\r\ndevelopment, he has regrettably omitted  sufficient\r\n\r\nmention  of  rural  development  schemes.   It   is\r\n\r\nunlikely  that  in  the near  future  all  land  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  be utilised for urban  development\r\n\r\nand,  hence, of necessity, some land will still  be\r\n\r\navailable for rural development schemes,  and  this\r\n\r\naspect   of  development  should  be  given   equal\r\n\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rural areas, our farmers and producers of\r\n\r\nprimary  products  are  working  hard  to  increase\r\n\r\noutput.  I feel that encouragement should be  given\r\n\r\nto  them  to  enable  them  to  produce  sufficient\r\n\r\npoultry,   livestock,  etc, to  make   appreciable\r\n\r\nexports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that if sufficient attention and drive is\r\n\r\ngiven  to  rural  development and to  producers  of\r\n\r\nprimary  products  as  has  been  given  to   urban\r\n\r\ndevelopment and industry, the output of farmers can\r\n\r\nbe   increased  considerably  for  the  benefit  of\r\n\r\nSingapore as a whole and of our export trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, as a Back-bencher echoing the\r\n\r\nsentiments  of the general public of  Singapore,  I\r\n\r\nshould  like to observe that the present Government\r\n\r\nis  one  of the best in South-East Asia. Our people\r\n\r\nhave  every  confidence  in  the  commitments   and\r\n\r\nsincerity and integrity of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Furthermore, the countries  around  us\r\n\r\nalso  share the same view, which I feel is a  great\r\n\r\ntribute to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.39 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Budget\r\n\r\nas presented to this House is a useful and down-to-earth  one. This is to be expected in view  of  the\r\n\r\nspecial circumstances in which Singapore is placed.\r\n\r\nWe  are  a  small nation with no natural resources.\r\n\r\nOur  only resources are our manpower. This at  once\r\n\r\nis  our asset and our problem. We have a tremendous\r\n\r\nreservoir  of manpower which, if properly  deployed\r\n\r\nand  developed,  would lead us to fortune,  but  if\r\n\r\nneglected  would be the cause of our failure.  This\r\n\r\nbasic problem of ours is realised by our Government\r\n\r\nand  positive steps are being taken to  combat  it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  this is a problem which  cannot  be\r\n\r\nsolved overnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gives me confidence, however, to observe that\r\n\r\nthe Minister in charge of financial affairs was the\r\n\r\nperson   who,  as  Chairman  of  the  Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board, was responsible for breaking the\r\n\r\nback  of our housing problem. He is now at the helm\r\n\r\nof   our  financial  affairs  actively  engaged  in\r\n\r\ntackling  this unemployment problem.  In  order  to\r\n\r\nsolve it, a great deal of thought has been spent on\r\n\r\nindustrialisation;  but in order  to  industrialise\r\n\r\neffectively, we need a market. Singapore by  itself\r\n\r\nis  too small to provide a market to absorb all the\r\n\r\nproducts  that  our  factories can  turn  out.  Our\r\n\r\nattention, therefore, is turned to export. However,\r\n\r\nour  industrialists are not quite familiar with the\r\n\r\nexport  market.  Therefore, in order  to  encourage\r\n\r\nthem  to  export,  we  have to  offer  them  export\r\n\r\nincentives.  In  last  year's  budget,  there  were\r\n\r\ncertain  incentives offered, but these  were  found\r\n\r\ninsufficient and I am glad to observe that in  this\r\n\r\nyear's  budget, the incentives we offer  are  of  a\r\n\r\nbold  and  imaginative kind and should do  well  to\r\n\r\nencourage our industrialists to export.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, however, I find that the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance was practically silent on  the\r\n\r\nprospects of our export markets. A great  deal  was\r\n\r\nsaid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlast  year about the finding of export markets with\r\n\r\nthe help of the Government. Mr Speaker, Sir, may I\r\n\r\nread  from  last year's Budget Speech contained  in\r\n\r\nVolume 24, No. 2, column 49 of Hansard in which the\r\n\r\nMinister,  with  reference to prospective  markets,\r\n\r\nsaid, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I should like, Mr Speaker, to go into some\r\n\r\ndetail  on the question of prospective markets  for\r\n\r\nour  manufactured  goods. These fall  roughly  into\r\n\r\nfour categories :-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Markets in the developed, highly\r\n\r\nindustrialised countries of the world;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) New markets in Africa and Eastern Europe;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Markets to be provided by those countries\r\n\r\nwhich    have   been   consistently    running\r\n\r\nfavourable balances of trade with us; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Markets in those countries which have a\r\n\r\nvested  interest  in ensuring  that  Singapore\r\n\r\nremains  viable and stable so that,  in  turn,\r\n\r\ntheir   own   security   interests   are   not\r\n\r\njeopardized.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I am afraid no further reference to this particular\r\n\r\ndevelopment  is  contained in  the  present  Budget\r\n\r\nSpeech,  especially in regard to  category  (d)  as\r\n\r\ncontained  in  last  year's Budget  Speech  of  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  -  that  is,  markets  in  those\r\n\r\ncountries which have a vested interest in  ensuring\r\n\r\nthat Singapore remains a viable and stable country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the Minister for Finance in his\r\n\r\nreply will inform the House what progress has  been\r\n\r\nmade  in this particular respect and what prospects\r\n\r\nthere  are for our industrial products being  taken\r\n\r\nup by these particular markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the year, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  were  certain bi-lateral agreements  entered\r\n\r\ninto  with  East European countries, but  it  would\r\n\r\nappear  that we were significantly unsuccessful  in\r\n\r\ngetting  a foothold in the African market in  spite\r\n\r\nof  the fact that a trade mission had been to  that\r\n\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read the debate on last year's budget and\r\n\r\nI  notice that there was a good suggestion from the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  for  Punggol: he recommended  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to consider the question of creating  an\r\n\r\nexport credit guarantee agency. This may be one  of\r\n\r\nthe ways of helping our exporters. As\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  hon. Member for Punggol argued, exporters  are\r\n\r\nusually  unfamiliar with export markets,  and  they\r\n\r\nare  not  quite willing to risk their resources  in\r\n\r\nsuch  markets unless they can be reasonably assured\r\n\r\nthat there is a return on their exports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is difficult to comment upon\r\n\r\nthe  Budget Speech in view of the fact that we were\r\n\r\ngiven  so little time in which to prepare and  also\r\n\r\nthe  fact that a lot of information is not  at  our\r\n\r\ndisposal. However, I would like to touch on  a  few\r\n\r\nsubjects  that  appear  in the  current  Budget  as\r\n\r\npresented by the Finance Minister. May I, first  of all,   take   the   question   of   building    and construction? As appearing in the Budget Statement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The value of buildings commenced in the first\r\n\r\nsix  months of this year stood at $56.5 million  as\r\n\r\nagainst  $80.7  million for the  same  period  last\r\n\r\nyear.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, therefore, a drop of something like $24\r\n\r\nmillion.  I think the responsibility for this  drop\r\n\r\nin  the  development of buildings and  construction\r\n\r\nmust  be laid at the door of high rates. I am  glad\r\n\r\nthat in the present budget the Finance Minister  is\r\n\r\nmaking  provision  to lower the  rate  for  special\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and  for  development  in   designated\r\n\r\nareas.  Unfortunately it would appear that this  is\r\n\r\nrather  restricted  and  is  not  broad  enough  to\r\n\r\nencourage   private  development,   especially   of\r\n\r\ncommercial  buildings. A great deal  of  labour  is\r\n\r\nemployed in the construction industry and  a  boost\r\n\r\nto  that industry will, in fact, be one of the ways\r\n\r\nof helping the unemployment problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I\r\n\r\nrecommend  the  Government to have a  look  at  the\r\n\r\npresent  legislation regarding  rent  control?  The\r\n\r\npresent  legislation may be an  impediment  in  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment    of   building   and    construction,\r\n\r\nespecially  of  commercial buildings.  Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nGovernment may wish to have a look at this  problem\r\n\r\nand  possibly decide, for example, on selective de-control. This could first be done in the commercial\r\n\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another solution to this problem may be the\r\n\r\nsetting up of a tribunal to settle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  question  of  disputes between  landlords  and\r\n\r\ntenants  on the amount of compensation payable  for\r\n\r\nremoval.  If  this suggestion does not find  favour\r\n\r\nwith  the Government, I wonder whether it  will  at\r\n\r\nleast  appoint a committee to look into  the  whole\r\n\r\nquestion  of  rent  control  and  its  effects   on\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad to see the announced intention of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to  control finance  companies.  I\r\n\r\nthink this is the appropriate time to do so. We are\r\n\r\nan  affluent  society. A lot of us  are  living  on\r\n\r\ncredit. In fact, we may term our present economy as\r\n\r\nan H.P. (hire-purchase) economy. I think it is high\r\n\r\ntime  that  legislation  should  be  introduced  to\r\n\r\nprotect  the  consuming public against unscrupulous\r\n\r\nfinance companies, not only, as the Minister in his\r\n\r\nstatement says, to protect the depositors but  also\r\n\r\nto protect the borrowers from the finance companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that in the Budget Statement there is no\r\n\r\nmention  whatsoever of our public transport system,\r\n\r\nalthough sometime ago we saw in the Press that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wanted  the  companies  running  public\r\n\r\ntransport  to come together to work out  a  certain\r\n\r\nscheme to better serve the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> On a point of\r\n\r\nclarification, Mr Speaker.

But we have heard nothing of\r\n\r\nthat  since,  and  I  was  wondering  whether   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  now  contemplate  legislation  to\r\n\r\nnationalise  public transport so  that  the  public\r\n\r\ntransport  system  can  be  a  more  rational   and\r\n\r\nefficient one than it is at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with industrialisation, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  as we said in the debate  over  the\r\n\r\nsubject  of resettlement last Monday, I  think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment may be paying far too much attention  to\r\n\r\nindustrialisation and not enough to the problems of\r\n\r\nthe  farming  community. As I  have  said,  farming\r\n\r\nproperly developed may again be one of the ways  of\r\n\r\nfinding  more job opportunities for our unemployed,\r\n\r\nsince, at the present stage of development, it is a\r\n\r\nlabour intensive industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see from the financial statement, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  a tremendous amount of money  is  being\r\n\r\ngiven out on loan to the Economic Development Board\r\n\r\nfor the development of Jurong. Jurong, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  is  an imaginative scheme. I think  it  is  a\r\n\r\nscheme  of  which we in Singapore should be  justly\r\n\r\nproud. On the other hand, Mr Speaker, Sir, if  you\r\n\r\ngo  to  Jurong you can see that a lot of sites  are\r\n\r\nnot  being  taken up and it would possibly  benefit\r\n\r\nthe  Government to spend more thought on attracting\r\n\r\nforeign  manufacturers to Jurong before  developing\r\n\r\nJurong further. There is no point in developing the\r\n\r\nsites  when they are not being taken up.  It  would\r\n\r\nonly  be  locking  up a lot of financial  resources\r\n\r\nwhich  could be better deployed elsewhere.  On  the\r\n\r\nwhole,  Mr  Speaker, this is  a  practical  budget\r\n\r\ndevoid  of  dramatic changes which,  unfortunately,\r\n\r\nin, our  present state of development the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister is not able to make. I support the budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, for the Budget Speech  for  1967\r\n\r\ndelivered  by  him on 5th December, 1966,  we  must\r\n\r\nshower congratulations on the Minister for Finance,\r\n\r\nalthough there has been an increase in road tax and\r\n\r\ndriving licences too. We understand that to develop\r\n\r\na  new  emergent State like ours in  Singapore,  we\r\n\r\nmust  have  a  balanced budget  in  line  with  the\r\n\r\ndevelopments which we have made. We also appreciate\r\n\r\nthe  increased  allocation  for  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs  to  establish  missions   in   12\r\n\r\ncountries.  There is a possibility that the  number\r\n\r\nmay increase in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Budget Speech we find\r\n\r\nthat  the  road  tax  and licence  fees  have  been\r\n\r\nincreased. What I am referring to here is that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance,  in  preparing  his  Budget\r\n\r\nSpeech,  naturally  must  have  taken  considerable\r\n\r\ntime, and due consideration must have been given to\r\n\r\nhow  to  raise  more  money and  increase  revenue.\r\n\r\nPossibly  in  raising new taxes  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance thinks that licence holders are car owners.\r\n\r\nIf  that is his assumption, then it is an erroneous\r\n\r\none.  There  are licence holders who  are  not  car\r\n\r\nowners  but who work as drivers. When we  levy  the\r\n\r\nnew  taxes  on drivers and licence holders,  it  is\r\n\r\ncertain  that, as has been mentioned  by  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Changi, it will be an extra  burden  to\r\n\r\nthem as they belong to the lower income group.  But\r\n\r\nit  is not so with licence holders who, at the same\r\n\r\ntime,  are  car owners. They cannot only afford  to\r\n\r\npay  the increased licence fees, but they can  also\r\n\r\nemploy drivers. To such people, the increased rate,\r\n\r\nin  my  opinion, is not a burden. They can pay  not\r\n\r\nonly  $10 but $20. But to those who become  drivers\r\n\r\nby occupation, it will be a bitter pill for them to\r\n\r\nswallow.  I wonder if the Minister for Finance  can\r\n\r\nfind  ways and means to exempt them from the  newly\r\n\r\nincreased road tax, if they are employed as drivers\r\n\r\nin  a  Ministry  or in a commercial  firm.  Licence\r\n\r\nholders  who are car owners should not be exempted.\r\n\r\nIn  the  case  of drivers, I ask the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance to give due consideration as to whether the\r\n\r\nextra  tax should be levied upon the employers,  or\r\n\r\nto do whatever he thinks best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the whole, the financial\r\n\r\npolicy   for  1967  is  fair  because  a   lot   of\r\n\r\ndevelopment is being carried out at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  the  1967 Budget Statement given  by  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  is  a very encouraging  one.  It\r\n\r\ngives us great stimulation and impetus, and,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult,  the people have full confidence  in  their\r\n\r\nfuture.  I  believe this Budget Statement  will  be\r\n\r\nwelcomed by the people at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main feature of this financial policy is\r\n\r\nthat,  apart from some adjustments in road tax  and\r\n\r\nan increase in driving licence fee, there have been\r\n\r\nno  increases in other taxes. We cannot only arrive\r\n\r\nat  a  balance in the budget, but we can also  have\r\n\r\nsome  surplus. This surplus reflects  the  economic\r\n\r\nstability  of  our  country,  which  is  of   great\r\n\r\nimportance  to  a  developing  country.   In   many\r\n\r\ncountries,  particularly in the emerging countries,\r\n\r\nfinancial and economic instability always leads  to\r\n\r\npolitical   unrest  and  social  chaos.  Therefore,\r\n\r\neconomic  stability  is one of the  most  important\r\n\r\nfactors in the Government policy in order to  bring\r\n\r\nabout  an  improvement  in the  livelihood  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  to lead our country into  a  state  of\r\n\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we first achieved independence, some people\r\n\r\nexpressed doubts and were very sceptical about  our\r\n\r\nability  to survive. But after a year of  struggle,\r\n\r\nwe  can show, from the present financial statement,\r\n\r\nthat  we  are not only able to survive but  we  are\r\n\r\nalso   able  to  do  something  better  to  develop\r\n\r\nourselves.   Mr  Speaker,  the  Budget   Statement\r\n\r\nreflects the realistic foresight of our Government.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are devoid of any natural resources, we\r\n\r\nare able to expand our industrialisation and to win\r\n\r\nmore foreign markets for our local products. We are\r\n\r\nalso able to create more job opportunities for  our\r\n\r\npeople.  From this Budget Statement we can see  for\r\n\r\nourselves  that  the  Government  is  giving   full\r\n\r\nencouragement to various quarters. This is all very\r\n\r\nencouraging.  Government  is  encouraging  our  own\r\n\r\npeople  to  take  part  in  industrial  and   urban\r\n\r\ndevelopment by giving them some kind of  incentive,\r\n\r\nsuch  as the reduction of property tax from 36  per\r\n\r\ncent  to  12 per cent. This is a far-reaching  plan\r\n\r\nwhich  is  welcomed. But we can also see  that  the\r\n\r\nconcession of property tax is not so well  modelled\r\n\r\non  the pioneer concessions given in the industrial\r\n\r\nsector.  There  is  no  time limit  given  to  this\r\n\r\nconcession on property tax. Because of  this,  the\r\n\r\npeople  who  participate  in  urban  renewal   will\r\n\r\nforever enjoy this kind of concession, particularly\r\n\r\nowners of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproperty in the designated areas, thus perpetuating\r\n\r\nthe gap between the rich and the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, our financial development is\r\n\r\ndependent upon the co-operation between capital and\r\n\r\nlabour. If this is overlooked, then the future will\r\n\r\nbe  very  gloomy, because there will be  industrial\r\n\r\nunrest  which  may  lead to  economic  collapse  or\r\n\r\npolitical  instability. So I urge trade  unionists,\r\n\r\nbefore  they take any industrial action,  to  think\r\n\r\ntwice before they launch any such campaign. If they\r\n\r\ntake  haphazard  industrial action, thereby  giving\r\n\r\nrise  to social chaos, then the people will suffer.\r\n\r\nOn  the  other  hand, if there is full co-operation\r\n\r\nbetween  management and labour, and if  both  exert\r\n\r\ntheir joint efforts for our development, then there\r\n\r\nwill be a better future and greater prosperity  for\r\n\r\nour people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in view of this, I fully support the\r\n\r\nfinancial policy of the Government for 1967.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport the financial policy of the Government  for\r\n\r\n1967.  In  doing  so,  I wish to  congratulate  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister on his realistic and down-to-earth\r\n\r\nbudget.   It   would   not   have   required   much\r\n\r\nintelligence or courage, especially in a House with\r\n\r\na  dominant  majority, for a  Finance  Minister  to\r\n\r\nweave a budget with yarns of expectations and hope.\r\n\r\nThere  is an abundance of economists and even  more\r\n\r\nof  economic theories to help a Finance Minister to\r\n\r\ndodge  his problems and tasks. But it really  takes\r\n\r\ncourage  and  common  sense to prepare  a  balanced\r\n\r\nbudget that firmly plants the country's feet on the\r\n\r\nground and allows the hands to get to work. Such is\r\n\r\nthe budget before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our eviction from Malaysia, we were faced with\r\n\r\none  country  dedicated  to  our  destruction,  and\r\n\r\nanother  to  our economic ruin. Another  government\r\n\r\nand  another people might have given up in despair.\r\n\r\nOur  determination and our will pulled us  through;\r\n\r\nand  very  nicely too. Our Gross National  Product,\r\n\r\nour   External   Reserves,  our   trade   and   our\r\n\r\nmanufactures have all gone up. There was  indeed  a\r\n\r\nmiracle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the development programme for the\r\n\r\npublic  sector  for next year, I am amazed  at  the\r\n\r\nmagnitude of our problems and our capacity to  meet\r\n\r\nthem.  Bearing  in  mind that we  have  a  balanced\r\n\r\nbudget  before  us,  our public sector  development\r\n\r\nprogramme  is  really  astounding.  The  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore are asked to invest in this sector, a sum\r\n\r\nwhich comes to nearly 70 per cent of the budget and\r\n\r\nwhich  represents an outlay of over $200 for  every\r\n\r\nman,  woman  and child. In other words,  for  every\r\n\r\ndollar  we  spend on ordinary expenses,  we  invest\r\n\r\nanother 70 cents either from savings or from loans.\r\n\r\nThis  rate  is, I am sure, something  a  number  of\r\n\r\ndeveloping  countries would envy. Furthermore,  the\r\n\r\ndistribution   of   this  massive   investment   is\r\n\r\nsomething  which  many developing  countries  would\r\n\r\nfind  it  difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.\r\n\r\nNo  other country in this region has been  able  to\r\n\r\nallocate  57  per cent to economic development,  36\r\n\r\nper cent to social development and only less than 7\r\n\r\nper cent to public administration and defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the budget itself, I note that in spite\r\n\r\nof  the  calls  for inducements and incentives  for\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs, it remains a very socialist one.  Of\r\n\r\nthe  $590  million of revenue, income tax, property\r\n\r\ntax,  taxes  on  property  transfers,  customs  and\r\n\r\nexcise on liquor, petroleum and tobacco account for\r\n\r\nnearly $360 million. Reimbursements, sales of goods\r\n\r\nand   services  and  income  from  investments  and\r\n\r\nproperty amount to over $122 million. Together, the\r\n\r\nitems I have narrated account for over 80 per  cent\r\n\r\nof  the  budget. And in this big sector,  the  poor\r\n\r\ncontributes but little.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On expenditure, I note that education and public\r\n\r\nhealth  alone take up over $211 million, or  nearly\r\n\r\n40  per  cent.  Special expenditure or  expenditure\r\n\r\nlargely  of a capital nature accounts for over  $93\r\n\r\nmillion  or  some  14  per  cent.  Culture,  social\r\n\r\nwelfare, public parks and gardens and public  works\r\n\r\nexpenditure come to nearly $60 million, or some  10\r\n\r\nper  cent. Statutory expenditure comes to some  $76\r\n\r\nmillion or over 11 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts which I have just mentioned account for\r\n\r\nmy  support of the 1967 Budget. There is,  however,\r\n\r\none point\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninsignificant though it may be to the House but  of\r\n\r\nvital  importance  to me as a  trade  unionist,  on\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Finance  Minister  is  silent.   I   am\r\n\r\nreferring  to  the  casualty  of  labour   in   the\r\n\r\ntransition of the Republic from an entrepot  to  an\r\n\r\nindustrial centre. Ample provisions are made in the\r\n\r\nbudget,  as I have said, to induce foreign  capital\r\n\r\nto flow into the Republic. But no provision is made\r\n\r\nto  enable  the  labour force  which  may  be  made\r\n\r\nredundant through the closing down of firms engaged\r\n\r\nin  the  import trade - a necessary side effect  of\r\n\r\nthe Government's export drive - to be retrained and\r\n\r\nchannelised  into the industrial  sector.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect, I should think something in the nature  of\r\n\r\na  National Employment Insurance Scheme may well be\r\n\r\nconsidered by the Finance Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, however, hasten to say that the point which I\r\n\r\nhave just raised may have been fully considered  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister, and for his own reasons he  has  not\r\n\r\ndealt  with  it in his 1967 Budget. It should  not,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  detract from my support of  the  budget\r\n\r\nwhich  is  progressive and sound. I  wholeheartedly\r\n\r\nsupport  the Finance Minister for such  a  balanced\r\n\r\nbudget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the people of Singapore  have  been\r\n\r\ngreatly   encouraged   by  the   Budget   Statement\r\n\r\ndelivered  on  the 5th of December by  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister.  Everyone says that it is an  encouraging\r\n\r\none.  But  as a Back-bencher, I would not  like  to\r\n\r\npraise it excessively. Otherwise, people would  say\r\n\r\nthat  I  am the loud-speaker of the Government.  My\r\n\r\nduty  is  to play the role of the Opposition  Party\r\n\r\nand  to  make  certain criticisms and  comments  on\r\n\r\ncertain  parts  of  the  Budget  Statement,   where\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I would like to point out\r\n\r\ninvolves  the  100  per cent  increase  in  driving\r\n\r\nlicence fees. I feel that this is in conflict  with\r\n\r\nthe  principle of the P.A.P. I do not know  whether\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers in the Government are aware that our\r\n\r\nParty's  aim is to bridge the gap between the  rich\r\n\r\nand the poor. When\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Finance Minister raises this licence fee, I  do\r\n\r\nnot know whether he himself has paid enough thought\r\n\r\nto  it, as most of the driving licence holders  are\r\n\r\npoor  people.  If  70 per cent  of  them  are  rich\r\n\r\npeople,  then  I  will acquiesce in this  increase.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in  point of fact, most  of  the  driving\r\n\r\nlicence  holders are from the lower  income  group.\r\n\r\nThey  are  poor  people. They  work  for  the  rich\r\n\r\ntowkays, because most of the towkays have big  cars\r\n\r\nand they do not have to have driving licences. They\r\n\r\ncan  engage chauffeurs by paying them about $100  a\r\n\r\nmonth.  Such a meagre income is hardly adequate  to\r\n\r\nsupport  the  livelihood of a  family.  Some  other\r\n\r\ndriving  licence holders are earning money for  the\r\n\r\ncapitalists,  e.g.,  the  taxi  drivers   and   bus\r\n\r\ndrivers.  These  taxi  drivers,  bus  drivers   and\r\n\r\nchauffeurs who work for their towkays are only able\r\n\r\nto earn about $100 a month. But the Government goes\r\n\r\nout of its way to increase the licence fee from  $5\r\n\r\nto  $10 per year, and this is done when the country\r\n\r\nis  experiencing  a  period of economic  stability.\r\n\r\nThis  is  really  beyond my understanding.  If  the\r\n\r\nMinister can assure us, as suggested by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kampong  Kapor, that the increase  in  driving\r\n\r\nlicence fee is to be paid by the employers of these\r\n\r\nwage-earners and chauffeurs, I will gladly  support\r\n\r\nit.   Otherwise  this  will  be  contrary  to   the\r\n\r\nprinciple of an egalitarian society. The budget, on\r\n\r\nthe  whole, is a sound one. Therefore, I will fully\r\n\r\nsupport  it notwithstanding what I have  said  just\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should\r\n\r\nlike  to congratulate the Hon. Minister for Finance\r\n\r\non  a  realistic and sound Budget Speech. There  is\r\n\r\npractically  nothing in it that one can  criticise.\r\n\r\n\"The  economy continues to move forward\"  were  the\r\n\r\nvery  words  of the Hon. Minister and  these  words\r\n\r\nmust  have  acted like a shot in  the  arm  to  the\r\n\r\npublic. The Hon. Minister said that it was his good\r\n\r\nfortune  as  Finance  Minister for  two  successful\r\n\r\nyears not to have had to raise revenue by increases\r\n\r\nin  the  rates of taxation. I am sure the taxpayers\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  country must have sighed with relief to  know\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  a Finance Minister  who  knows  his\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Minister has stated that the only\r\n\r\nchange  is one of increasing the motor vehicle  tax\r\n\r\nand  this  would bring in a small increase  of  $5\u00bd\r\n\r\nmillion  in revenue, an increase which  we  do  not\r\n\r\nreally need, as this increase is incidental to  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of sound principles of  taxation.  If\r\n\r\nthis  is really so, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would  have\r\n\r\nexpected the Hon. Minister to spread the benefit of\r\n\r\n$5\u00bd  million among the lower income group  so  that\r\n\r\nthese  citizens would have to pay less  income  tax\r\n\r\nfor  the  year 1967. Perhaps our very understanding\r\n\r\nMinister will consider what I have just said and be\r\n\r\nthe  first Finance Minister in South-East  Asia  to\r\n\r\nstart  a good example by lowering income taxes  for\r\n\r\nthe lower income group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.29 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I support the Minister in his presentation  of\r\n\r\nthis  budget, but I would not, like other  Members,\r\n\r\ncongratulate him on so doing. He has admitted  that\r\n\r\nit  has  been  his good fortune for  the  last  two\r\n\r\nsuccessive  years  not to have  raised  revenue  by\r\n\r\nincreases in the rates of taxation. For 1967 it has\r\n\r\nbeen not only his good fortune but I would say  the\r\n\r\ngood  fortune  of  the  people  of  Singapore  that\r\n\r\nincreased  revenue is forthcoming  because  of  the\r\n\r\nrising revenue in the major taxes. The only new tax\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been  imposed  is  the  change  of  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  the motor vehicle tax and  also  the\r\n\r\nincreased rate in driving licence fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we were in Malaysia, there were two\r\n\r\nvery controversial taxes. I refer to the sugar  and\r\n\r\ndiesel taxes. When these taxes were imposed in  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Parliament, I believe that our Government\r\n\r\nleaders very vigorously opposed these two forms  of\r\n\r\ntaxation. I would like the Minister for Finance  to\r\n\r\nexplain  to  this  House why  it  is  necessary  to\r\n\r\ncontinue imposing customs duty on sugar which is  a\r\n\r\nbasic  essential food of the people. I am not aware\r\n\r\nthat we have started a sugar refinery. Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister can enlighten us on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other controversial tax which was imposed on\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore during the Malaysia period\r\n\r\nwas  the diesel oil tax. This affected the cost  of\r\n\r\nliving  of  our  people  with  increased  costs  in\r\n\r\nelectricity, the manufacturing industries  and  our\r\n\r\ntransport industry. I would also like the  Minister\r\n\r\nto  explain why the imposition of this duty  should\r\n\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now touch on one point\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to export incentives  which  was  not\r\n\r\ncovered  by the Minister for Finance in his  Budget\r\n\r\nSpeech.  I  would say that the incentives  proposed\r\n\r\nare  very attractive to the manufacturing industry.\r\n\r\nBut  one  point which I feel he may have overlooked\r\n\r\nis that for our export industry to be successful we\r\n\r\nwill  also  have  to  depend on  transportation.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  our Government has no  control  over\r\n\r\nfreight  rates  and ships which call at  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand that freight rates can be controlled by foreign\r\n\r\nshipping companies by increasing the rates for  the\r\n\r\ncarriage of goods from Singapore to export  places,\r\n\r\nthus  serving  as a deterrent to our  manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has quite rightly been encouraging\r\n\r\nthe  development  of the building industry  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector. According to the Minister's  Budget\r\n\r\nSpeech,  the  encouragement is  mostly  centred  on\r\n\r\nthose  urban  areas where sites have  already  been\r\n\r\ncleared   for  development,  and  this   will   not\r\n\r\ntherefore create a problem. But I believe there are\r\n\r\nother  sites  in  the  urban  areas  where  private\r\n\r\nenterprise  would like to redevelop but  are  being\r\n\r\nhindered  by  the  provisions in the  Rent  Control\r\n\r\nOrdinance, on which, I believe, the Member for Choa\r\n\r\nChu  Kang  has  spoken. I would  suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister look into this Ordinance to see whether he\r\n\r\ncan   repeal   any  provisions  which  hinder   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the building industry and  to  bring\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance up to date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am disappointed to note that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Finance has  not  made  certain\r\n\r\nprovisions  in this year's budget for  Government's\r\n\r\nparticipation in the public road transport  system.\r\n\r\nI  will not dwell in detail on this subject at  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  but I will raise it again in the Committee\r\n\r\nof Supply during the debate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the  Deputy Prime Minister's Ministry.  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat the road transport industry is the only public\r\n\r\nutility  still  in the hands of private  enterprise\r\n\r\nwith no Government participation at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If there are no other Members\r\n\r\nwishing to speak, I will call upon the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance to reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.41 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in full\r\n\r\nagreement  with  the Member for Sembawang  when  he\r\n\r\nrightly  gives  a large part of the credit  to  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore for the fine performance of the\r\n\r\neconomy  during this year, as a result of which  we\r\n\r\nare  getting a larger surplus than anticipated, and\r\n\r\nalso  I  am in the happy position of being able  to\r\n\r\npresent  a  balanced budget for the  year  1967.  I\r\n\r\nthink   we  can  count  ourselves  fortunate   that\r\n\r\nalthough added responsibilities have come to us  on\r\n\r\nachieving  our  independence, I need  not  have  to\r\n\r\nraise further taxes, with the exception of revising\r\n\r\nthe method of taxing motor vehicles and an increase\r\n\r\nin  driving  licence fees, because of  the  energy,\r\n\r\ndrive  and  entrepreneurship of the  people.  Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  this, I need not have to raise further  taxes\r\n\r\nto  meet additional commitments. In reviewing these\r\n\r\ntaxes,  I think I have made it very clear  that  we\r\n\r\nstill  adhere to our socialist principle,  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  tax  those who are best able to afford  it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in revising the road tax, we saw  to  it\r\n\r\nthat  only  those  who  can afford  will  pay.  The\r\n\r\nmajority who own smaller cars will not have to bear\r\n\r\ntoo  much of the incidence of taxation. Here again,\r\n\r\nin  raising the driving licence fee from $5 to  $10\r\n\r\nper annum, I do not think that we have been bearing\r\n\r\ndown unduly hard on the poor section of the people.\r\n\r\nI  doubt very much the statement of the Member  who\r\n\r\nsays  that the majority of driving licence  holders\r\n\r\nare   poor.  There  are  roughly  360,000   driving\r\n\r\nlicences  in Singapore and the holders  of  driving\r\n\r\nlicences  belong to the rich, the  very  rich,  the\r\n\r\npoor and the not so poor, and they are asked to pay\r\n\r\n$5  more not per month, per week, per day, but  per\r\n\r\nyear,  which means, in effect, that if the  average\r\n\r\nsmoker  forgoes three cigarettes per week, he  will\r\n\r\nmore than be able to meet this $5 more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall take up as many as I\r\n\r\ncan remember of the points made by hon. Members  of\r\n\r\nthe House. The Member for Bukit Merah has said that\r\n\r\nhe is quite disappointed with the smaller provision\r\n\r\nmade  to  the  Ministry of Culture. I think  it  is\r\n\r\nwrong to assume, solely from this vote allocated to\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry   of  Culture,  that  the   cultural\r\n\r\nactivities  in  Singapore  are  financed.  Cultural\r\n\r\nactivities   are  being  undertaken   through   the\r\n\r\nEducation Department, the People's Association  and\r\n\r\nvarious other bodies, and I do not believe that  we\r\n\r\ncan  relate the level of cultural activities to the\r\n\r\namount  of money that is being voted for.  I  quite\r\n\r\nagree  with  him  that one of  the  most  important\r\n\r\naspects  in  nation-building is  the  promotion  of\r\n\r\nculture,  and I can assure him that we are spending\r\n\r\nquite  a  sizable sum of the revenue  in  promoting\r\n\r\nculture in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan has suggested to me\r\n\r\nthat in order to attract capital here we should  be\r\n\r\nflexible  with some regulations and think  of  some\r\n\r\ndevice  to waive some of the Income Tax regulations\r\n\r\nto  allow people who have money but cannot  account\r\n\r\nfor  it  to bring it in and invest. I do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhat regulations or what device he has in mind.  If\r\n\r\nhe  is thinking of any device which will compromise\r\n\r\nthe  Government and make it appear that we  condone\r\n\r\nany irregularities just because we want capital  to\r\n\r\ncome in, I can assure him that we will not agree to\r\n\r\nany  such  device which he may have  in  mind.  For\r\n\r\nthose people who, he says, have assets overseas and\r\n\r\nwho are resident here and would like to bring their\r\n\r\nmoney in but are afraid to do so because the Income\r\n\r\nTax  Department would be after them and they  would\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay 40 per cent of whatever they  brought\r\n\r\nin,  under the Income Tax laws if it can be  proved\r\n\r\nthat  these  are  assets  which  a  non-Singaporean\r\n\r\nresiding here has built up by monies earned by  him\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore prior to his coming  here,  then\r\n\r\nthey  are  not  taxable. Anyone who  has  got  such\r\n\r\nassets  and would like to bring them in here  would\r\n\r\nbe welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been sending trade missions all over in\r\n\r\norder  to find an export market. We have said  that\r\n\r\nwe will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe friends with everybody and willing to trade with\r\n\r\nanyone. We will allow trade missions to China if it\r\n\r\ncan  be proved that they are going to China to sell\r\n\r\nour products and not to buy. At the moment, we have\r\n\r\nan   unfavourable  balance  of  trade  with   China\r\n\r\nannually, running into an odd $100 million. In  the\r\n\r\npresent circumstances, Sir, I think it would not be\r\n\r\nin  our  interest to allow further missions  to  go\r\n\r\nthere  if its purpose is to buy goods made in China\r\n\r\nand  not  to  sell our products. But  if  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  can  assure me that if a trade  mission  to\r\n\r\nChina  is formed in Singapore and that it  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  sell our products there, I will willingly\r\n\r\nrecommend that this mission be allowed to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad, Sir, that the Member for Bras\r\n\r\nBasah  realises  that  the most  important  problem\r\n\r\nfacing  us is unemployment. But I do not understand\r\n\r\nhow  he  came  to  the conclusion that  I  am  most\r\n\r\noptimistic in feeling that the unemployment problem\r\n\r\ncan  be solved. In fact, if he has been paying  the\r\n\r\nattention  which  he  says he  has  to  the  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement,  he  will  remember  that  I  sounded  a\r\n\r\nwarning that unless and until every sector  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy  understands the problem that we  face  and\r\n\r\npull  up  their socks and work together,  then  the\r\n\r\nfuture is going to be very bleak indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has also mentioned that\r\n\r\nhe  would  like to see training within industry.  I\r\n\r\npresume he has got a copy of my Budget Speech,  but\r\n\r\nI will refer to col. 455 where I said, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Economic Development Board has already\r\n\r\nstarted,  on  a  limited  scale,  the  training  of\r\n\r\ntechnicians  and skilled workers in tool  and  die-making,  electro-plating and  heat  treatment.  The\r\n\r\nspecialised training programmes help to upgrade the\r\n\r\nskill  of  our  workers in the existing  industries\r\n\r\nand, ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn    addition,   specialised   production   teams,\r\n\r\nincluding workers, will be sent overseas for on-the-job training . . . By building up a large reservoir\r\n\r\nof  technicians and skilled workers, and by gearing\r\n\r\ntraining to the industrial promotion programme,  we\r\n\r\ncan  quickly enter into a more sophisticated  stage\r\n\r\nof industrial development.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the point that he has made has been\r\n\r\nprovided for - we are giving training in industries\r\n\r\nand giving our people special skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Below par.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I do not know, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhere  in  my Budget Statement I implied -  was  it\r\n\r\nimplied  that  I am blaming labour  for  not  being\r\n\r\nproductive?

On the other hand, he\r\n\r\nis  not  unaware  that, with a large  reservoir  of\r\n\r\nunemployed  on our hands, the unskilled  labour  in\r\n\r\nthe  public daily-rated unions is the highest  paid\r\n\r\nunskilled labour in South-East Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> After putting in 20 years'\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> And yet, after having agreed\r\n\r\nthat  this is no time for wage revision,  that  the\r\n\r\npublic daily-rated workers are the highest paid  in\r\n\r\nSouth-East  Asia, and that there are thousands  and\r\n\r\nthousands  of unemployed, he is asking for  a  wage\r\n\r\nrevision  at  a  time when we are  going  to  fight\r\n\r\nunemployment and when we have got to prove that  we\r\n\r\nare more efficient than the rest in order really to\r\n\r\nattract  entrepreneurs with industrial  schemes  to\r\n\r\ncreate  more  employment. He  is  doing  all  these\r\n\r\nthings knowing full well what the implications are.\r\n\r\nI do not think he can rightly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsay   that  the  daily-rated  labourers  are  being\r\n\r\nexploited. From his own experience and from my  own\r\n\r\nexperience  and from the experience of a  few,  not\r\n\r\nonly  are  they the highest paid, but I think  they\r\n\r\nare being worked the least.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah did mention that we\r\n\r\nmust  not forget in our industrialisation programme\r\n\r\nto  bring  in industries which will purchase  their\r\n\r\nraw  materials from all over the world. Here again,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, if he has been paying  as  much\r\n\r\nattention to the Budget Statement as he has said he\r\n\r\nhad,  he  will  find somewhere  there  that  I  did\r\n\r\nmention that we are giving every incentive in order\r\n\r\nto  attract entrepreneur manufacturers, with world-wide  connections who can purchase their  materials\r\n\r\nfrom  all  over the world and who have got  markets\r\n\r\nall  over the world, in joint ventures with our own\r\n\r\ncitizens. As far as markets are concerned, we  have\r\n\r\nfeasibility   studies  before  we   allow   pioneer\r\n\r\nindustries to receive pioneer certificates, and  we\r\n\r\nhave  agents  in  some of the main  cities  of  the\r\n\r\nworld.  It is our intention that later on, when  we\r\n\r\nhave  set  up  embassies, to attach to  them  Trade\r\n\r\nCommissioners  who  will be  able  to  provide  the\r\n\r\nnecessary market information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Farrer Park, he is a bit\r\n\r\nworried that if we keep on retaining more and  more\r\n\r\nof our imports, our balance of payments will become\r\n\r\nmore  and more unfavourable. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  it\r\n\r\nall  depends  upon whether we use retained  imports\r\n\r\nfor  manufacture of products to be re-exported,  or\r\n\r\nwhether  we consume the retained imports ourselves.\r\n\r\nI think I have made it very clear that the increase\r\n\r\nin retained imports is largely due to the fact that\r\n\r\nour  increasing number of industries are using more\r\n\r\nand  more  raw  materials  which  are  turned  into\r\n\r\nfinished products and re-exported. And if  he  will\r\n\r\nlook  through  my  statement  on  the  question  of\r\n\r\nfinancing  for  development for the year  1967,  he\r\n\r\nwill  see that, on Development Expenditure of round\r\n\r\nabout $411 million for 1967, we will be drawing  on\r\n\r\nour reserves of the Development\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFund to the extent of only $32 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I did not mention export markets in my\r\n\r\nBudget Statement, it does not mean that nothing  is\r\n\r\nhappening  in that sphere and that we  are  keeping\r\n\r\nstill.  I did not mention it for the simple  reason\r\n\r\nthat  during the course of the year, when we signed\r\n\r\nbi-lateral trade agreements with Bulgaria and  some\r\n\r\nEast  European countries, sufficient publicity  had\r\n\r\nbeen  given and I thought it would be wasting  time\r\n\r\nto mention that again. I think sufficient publicity\r\n\r\nhad  been  given during the time when we  sat  down\r\n\r\nwith  the  Americans to negotiate  on  the  textile\r\n\r\nquota.  So, Mr Speaker, Sir, although  I  did  not\r\n\r\nmention  or  enlarge on the statement I  made  last\r\n\r\nyear  about  looking  for new markets,  things  are\r\n\r\nhappening there, though at a much slower rate  than\r\n\r\nI or anyone of us would like it to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot agree with the statement that the\r\n\r\nsubstantial drop in building and construction  last\r\n\r\nyear  was  due  to the high rate of  property  tax.\r\n\r\nBuilding  and  construction is the  most  sensitive\r\n\r\nsector  of  the  economy,  and  if  there  are  any\r\n\r\npolitical changes, it is bound to suffer. I do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  very clearly what the Member  for  Choa\r\n\r\nChu  Kang meant when he said that unless and  until\r\n\r\nthe  property tax on building of commercial  houses\r\n\r\nis  reduced,  there  would be no  progress  in  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of commercial houses. I think he probably\r\n\r\nmeant the re-building of commercial houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> On a point of clarification,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I think I  said  that  the\r\n\r\nconcession  was not generous enough or not  general\r\n\r\nenough  to  embrace the whole of  the  economy  and\r\n\r\npossibly a reduction in the rates would serve as an\r\n\r\nincentive to the building trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I probably\r\n\r\nmisunderstood  him. But I thought  it  was  implied\r\n\r\nthat  if  no reduction in property tax is given  to\r\n\r\ncommercial building, there would be no progress  in\r\n\r\ncommercial  building. I would say  that  under  the\r\n\r\nurban  renewal  scheme it is exactly to  commercial\r\n\r\nbuilding that the reduced rate will apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the removal of rent control, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  time will come, much sooner than  we  at\r\n\r\nfirst expected, when it would be possible to remove\r\n\r\nrent control without great hardship to the majority\r\n\r\nof  the poorer tenants, because with the success of\r\n\r\nthe  low-cost building programme, we find that more\r\n\r\nthan  50 per cent of the people who were living  in\r\n\r\nthe  city have now moved into low-cost houses,  and\r\n\r\nvery  soon more and more will go out and then  that\r\n\r\nwould  be  the  time  to  consider  removing   rent\r\n\r\ncontrol. I am very sure that if we were to  pass  a\r\n\r\nBill now to remove rent control, the House would be\r\n\r\nreally   divided  on  this  issue.  But   for   the\r\n\r\ninformation  of  Members who  feel  that  something\r\n\r\nshould  be  done in order to assist the development\r\n\r\nof  the  city, we are thinking along the  lines  of\r\n\r\nsetting up a tribunal in order to be able to settle\r\n\r\ncompensation  payable for removal  for  development\r\n\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the nationalisation of public\r\n\r\ntransport,   I  personally  feel  that   once   you\r\n\r\nnationalise  public  transport,  it  may  be   more\r\n\r\nrational, but it would not be more efficient.  That\r\n\r\nis  one  thing  I am very sure of. I have  not  the\r\n\r\nslightest  desire  to nationalise public  transport\r\n\r\nnor  would  I  recommend it, because  that  is  the\r\n\r\nquickest way to lose Government revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Choa Chu Kang, while agreeing that\r\n\r\nwe  should  industrialise,  felt  that  not  enough\r\n\r\nemphasis has been given to the agricultural sector.\r\n\r\nI cannot agree with him on this. Within our limited\r\n\r\nconfines we are doing everything we can to  promote\r\n\r\nagriculture  - not  agriculture  in  the  sense   of\r\n\r\nplanting  rubber trees - and we have not  done  too\r\n\r\nbadly.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, if  you  will  remember,\r\n\r\nabout  three  or  four years ago we were  importing\r\n\r\npigs,  poultry  and  eggs, but  now  we  are  in  a\r\n\r\nposition to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexport pigs, poultry and eggs, and I think we  have\r\n\r\ngot  a  really good herd of locally-bred stud  pigs\r\n\r\nwhich I think very few countries in South-East Asia\r\n\r\nhave. Therefore, the Primary Production Department,\r\n\r\nunder  the  Ministry  of National  Development,  is\r\n\r\npushing ahead and improving pig-rearing, husbandry,\r\n\r\npoultry  rearing and market gardening  methods.  So\r\n\r\nwithin  the  very limited space in this island,  we\r\n\r\nare  doing everything we possibly can in  order  to\r\n\r\ntake   full  advantage  of  modern  technology   in\r\n\r\nintensive  farming poultry breeding and its  allied\r\n\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon - is it Serangoon? -\r\n\r\nTelok  Blangah, yes. Mr Speaker, he proposed  that\r\n\r\nwe  should look after the unemployed by bringing in\r\n\r\na  national  unemployment insurance scheme.  I  can\r\n\r\nassure him that we are trying to get an actuary  to\r\n\r\nwork  out  unemployment insurance for this country,\r\n\r\nand  so far we have not been successful. But I hope\r\n\r\nduring the course of next year to be able to put up\r\n\r\na  scheme for consideration by the Cabinet  and  by\r\n\r\nthis House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, to come to the Member for River Valley\r\n\r\nwho  wants  me to give an explanation  why  certain\r\n\r\ntaxes which were imposed during Malaysian days have\r\n\r\nnot  been  removed. It is not true to say that  the\r\n\r\ncost  of living has gone up because there is a  tax\r\n\r\non diesel oil, and that electricity rates have gone\r\n\r\nup  because of the tax on diesel oil. In fact,  the\r\n\r\nP.U.B. is given exemption from paying this tax, and\r\n\r\nbecause of its desire to raise loans from the World\r\n\r\nBank,  it  is  now forced really to look  into  its\r\n\r\nsystem of trading and put it on a very firm trading\r\n\r\nbasis, as a result of which it has found that it is\r\n\r\nin  a  very peculiar position, in that the more  it\r\n\r\nsells, the more it loses! Therefore, before we  can\r\n\r\nget  a  loan from the World Bank, we first have  to\r\n\r\nput  our  house  in order, that is, the  P.U.B. in\r\n\r\norder,  and to see that it really conforms  to  the\r\n\r\norganisation  and  to the principle  of  a  trading\r\n\r\nconcern,  that is, the more you sell, the more  you\r\n\r\nshould  be  able  to make, and not  the  other  way\r\n\r\nround.  So  it  is  not true that the  increase  in\r\n\r\nelectricity is due to the diesel oil taxes. In  any\r\n\r\ncase, the P.U.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis not paying tax because it has been exempted from\r\n\r\nthe tax on diesel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His point on shipping is noted, and it has been\r\n\r\nexercising the minds of the officers of my Ministry\r\n\r\nto  see  in  what way we can break the stranglehold\r\n\r\nthat  the  Shipping  Conference  have  on  shipping\r\n\r\nrates.  We will try as far as possible to see  that\r\n\r\nthis  monopoly  does  not in  any  way  put  up  an\r\n\r\ninsuperable   barrier   to  our   industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme.  In  fact, we have managed  to  get  the\r\n\r\nAustralian-Singapore run to accept two of our local\r\n\r\nsteamers to be members of the Conference,  so  that\r\n\r\ngoods  manufactured  here  could  be  exported   to\r\n\r\nAustralia   in  their  bottoms  and   at   a   rate\r\n\r\ncompetitive with freight rates elsewhere. I think I\r\n\r\nhave  touched on most of the points that have  been\r\n\r\nraised, and before I sit down, Mr Speaker, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwould like -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> On a point of information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I must thank the Member for reminding me.\r\n\r\nThe  reason  why  the  tax on sugar  has  not  been\r\n\r\nremoved  is that there will be a sugar refinery  in\r\n\r\nSingapore soon. From what I understand, the factory\r\n\r\nis in an advanced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstage  of  construction, and when  it  is  refining\r\n\r\nsugar, there would have to be a protective duty. So\r\n\r\nrather  than removing the duty now and  putting  it\r\n\r\nback  later  on, we thought it best to  leave  well\r\n\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, before I sit down, may I\r\n\r\nrequest  the trade union leaders always to keep  in\r\n\r\nmind  that  the biggest problem facing  us  is  the\r\n\r\nunemployment  problem, and that far  from  allowing\r\n\r\nlabour  to  be  exploited by  management,  we  have\r\n\r\nalways   maintained  that  there   should   be   no\r\n\r\nexploitation  of  one by the other,  and  that,  in\r\n\r\nspite  of the fact that there is a large number  of\r\n\r\nunemployed, we would not allow any entrepreneur  to\r\n\r\ntake advantage of the situation. But still, at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  I  hope the trade union  leaders  will\r\n\r\nrealise  the  significance of it and that  for  the\r\n\r\nsuccess  of our industrialisation programme,  which\r\n\r\nultimately will mean more employment and prosperity\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore, everyone of us should pull  up  our\r\n\r\nsocks,  do our best, understand the problem  before\r\n\r\nus,  and do not do anything at all which will bring\r\n\r\nharm to our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of\r\n\r\nthe Government for the year 1967.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That the House do now adjourn.\"-[Mr Lim Kim San]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Fifteen minutes past Seven o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1966/19661214/19661214-HA-0250677.pdf\"\">Estimate of Expenditure of Singapore for the Year 1967 (Cols 0677-0680) </a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
