Unfortunately, in December 1971, his health\r\n\r\nsuffered  a setback whilst under examination in  hospital\r\n\r\nat  Houston, Texas. Those of us who knew how gravely  ill\r\n\r\nhe was, before and after he had his operation in December\r\n\r\n1971,  were  deeply concerned. However, he  overcame  the\r\n\r\nsetback. Slowly and steadily, he pulled himself  up  from\r\n\r\nthe  aftermath  of  such a major operation.  Courage  and\r\n\r\ntenacity  summed  up  the spirit in  the  man.  He  never\r\n\r\ntreated himself as an invalid and, as a consequence,  his\r\n\r\ndoctors were surprised and delighted, within less than  a\r\n\r\nyear of the operation, to report that he could resume his\r\n\r\nnormal duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firmly but surely, he adjusted life to his new\r\n\r\ncondition and settled a format for an active intellectual\r\n\r\nlife.  He resumed his regular protocol and social duties.\r\n\r\nHe also resumed his teaching and demonstration classes at\r\n\r\nKandang Kerbau Hospital, imparting his considerable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexperience and expertise to young doctors aspiring to  be\r\n\r\ngynaecologists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has carried his office with unassuming dignity,\r\n\r\napplication  and self-discipline. He has won the  respect\r\n\r\nof  all  who came to know him. He takes his official  and\r\n\r\nsocial  duties  seriously.  He  has  a  keen  and  lively\r\n\r\ninterest in his work. He reads up the background  to  all\r\n\r\nthe  papers that constitutionally have to go to him,  and\r\n\r\nthus is abreast of what is going on in government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving his re-election, my colleagues and I have\r\n\r\nevery  confidence that he will continue to discharge  his\r\n\r\nduties  ably. He has now gained wider experience,  and  a\r\n\r\ngreater  understanding of the ways of  men  and  nations.\r\n\r\nEvery  dignitary who has had to call on him has  received\r\n\r\nunfailing courtesy. To everyone of them, he has paid  the\r\n\r\ndeepest compliment any Head of State can pay, namely,  to\r\n\r\ntake  a  real  interest in the man, learn about  him  and\r\n\r\nabout the country or causes he represents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion to re-elect Dr Benjamin Henry Sheares as the President of the\r\n\r\nRepublic of Singapore for a second term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since his appointment as President, Dr Benjamin Sheares\r\n\r\nhas  demonstrated his capability and efficiency as a Head\r\n\r\nof State. He is not only a gentle man of kind disposition\r\n\r\nand  manners  but  also  one  who  is  far-sighted.  What\r\n\r\nconvinced us is his character and demeanour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe  has  an interest in all spheres of life, not only  in\r\n\r\nsocial  life but also in religious celebrations organised\r\n\r\nby the various communities in Singapore. For instance, in\r\n\r\nthe  annual celebration of the Prophet Mohamed  organised\r\n\r\nby  the  Muslim  Missionary in  Lorong  12,  Geylang,  to\r\n\r\ncommemorate the birth of Prophet Mohamed, leader  of  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  faith  and the apostle of God, President  Sheares\r\n\r\nhas  never  rejected  such  an  invitation.  Instead   by\r\n\r\nattending such meetings he contributed valuable  speeches\r\n\r\nfor   the  Muslim  people  in  the  Republic.  In  brief,\r\n\r\nPresident Sheares is not only a Professor in Surgery, and\r\n\r\nan  efficient  one at that, but he is  also  a  wise  and\r\n\r\nefficient Statesman who has won the hearts and  minds  of\r\n\r\nthe people. A leader who possesses these qualities can be\r\n\r\na  symbol of unity among our multi-racial, religious  and\r\n\r\ncultural communities in our Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the re-election of Dr\r\n\r\nBenjamin Henry Sheares for a second term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

An  example\r\n\r\nof  his qualities can be found in the Commonwealth  Heads\r\n\r\nof  Government Conference held in our Republic.  You  may\r\n\r\nrecall  that it was just before that Conference that  our\r\n\r\nPresident  first  assumed  the  responsibilities  of  the\r\n\r\noffice of Head of State. During that important and trying\r\n\r\nperiod,   when  there  were  so  many  leaders   of   the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth, our President performed his duties as  Head\r\n\r\nof  State and received these dignitaries with accord  and\r\n\r\nearned  a  good reputation. He has established  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat he is in every respect fit to be a President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, sincerely support the re-election of Dr\r\n\r\nSheares,  who has gained experience in the  duties  of  a\r\n\r\nHead  of  State, and I am sure all hon.

He  has  to\r\n\r\nshoulder onerous and important missions of state.  Hence,\r\n\r\nit  is  very  important to choose someone  with  profound\r\n\r\nlearning,   good  character  and  quality,  and   eminent\r\n\r\nreputation  as President. Looking for such a  person  may\r\n\r\nnot be too difficult a problem with big countries, but to\r\n\r\na  small country with a small population such as ours, it\r\n\r\nreally is not an easy task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since assumption of office of the President of the\r\n\r\nRepublic  of Singapore, Dr Sheares has fully demonstrated\r\n\r\nhis  fine qualities in this appointment. His efforts over\r\n\r\nthe  past  few  years  have won for our  country  a  high\r\n\r\nreputation  and  prestige abroad.

Its members are paid nominal\r\n\r\nallowances  for their services during duty  hours.  Their\r\n\r\nemployers  are  under  no  obligation  to  pay  them  the\r\n\r\ndifference  between their civilian pay and the allowances\r\n\r\npaid  by  the  Police for their services. To  assist  the\r\n\r\nmembers of the Special Constabulary the Police Force has,\r\n\r\nas  far as possible, arranged their duty hours such  that\r\n\r\nthey   suffer   minimal  disruption  in  their   civilian\r\n\r\noccupations   or  suffer  loss  of  personal  emoluments.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in  view  of  a severe manpower  shortage,  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force intends to utilise the Special Constabulary\r\n\r\nmore  intensively.  This may result in  loss  of  pay  to\r\n\r\nmembers of the Special Constabulary unless the Government\r\n\r\nis in a position to compensate the losses through make-up\r\n\r\npay,  as  is  being done in the case of national  service\r\n\r\nreservists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like the Special Constabulary, the People's\r\n\r\nDefence Force is also composed of national servicemen and\r\n\r\nvolunteers. Recently the Force was reorganised to  enable\r\n\r\nit to undertake additional operational duties. Members of\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Defence  Force are  only  paid  allowances\r\n\r\nduring  their training periods. Unless they are  national\r\n\r\nservice reservists, their employers are under no obligation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto pay them any make-up pay. As a result they  too\r\n\r\nwould lose in terms of pay if they are not compensated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended to remedy the situation through this\r\n\r\nAmendment  Bill.  The Bill seeks to repeal  and  re-enact\r\n\r\nsection  24  of  the  Enlistment Act  (i.e, the  present\r\n\r\nprovision  providing for make-up pay). Apart from  making\r\n\r\nprovision  for  makeup  pay for the  categories  who  are\r\n\r\nalready eligible, the Bill requires employers to pay make-up  salary to both the volunteers and national servicemen\r\n\r\n(i.e, those who are performing part-time service) in  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Defence Force and the Special Constabulary  when\r\n\r\nthey are called up for training or reserve service and to\r\n\r\nvolunteers  in  these  Forces when  they  are  mobilized.\r\n\r\nEmployers  may deduct the amount paid from their  payroll\r\n\r\ntax.  Those  employers who are not liable to pay  payroll\r\n\r\ntax, and those whose payroll tax is insufficient for such\r\n\r\ndeductions, may claim reimbursement from Government. Self-employed  members of the People's Defence Force  and  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Constabulary can claim reimbursement  also  from\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that employers of volunteers in\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Defence Force and the Special Constabulary\r\n\r\nare   to   continue  to  make  Central   Provident   Fund\r\n\r\ncontributions to the extent that they would be liable had\r\n\r\nthe  volunteers not been mobilized for full-time  service\r\n\r\nor called up for training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill repeals section 13 of the Vigilante Corps Act\r\n\r\nand  with this repeal, volunteers in the Vigilante  Corps\r\n\r\nwill not be liable for full-time mobilization. There  are\r\n\r\ntwo  main reasons for repealing section 13. First, it  is\r\n\r\nunfair  to  impose  the  liability  of  mobilization   on\r\n\r\nvolunteers in the Vigilante Corps. Secondly,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nintended to mobilize the volunteers anyway, as there  are\r\n\r\nlarge  numbers  of  national servicemen  doing  part-time\r\n\r\nservice in the Vigilante Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other important points in the Bill relate to\r\n\r\nreinstatement   in   employment,   prohibition    against\r\n\r\ndismissal  and leave of absence when performing  service.\r\n\r\nThe  provisions in respect of these matters are found  in\r\n\r\nsections 21, 22 and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23 of the Act.

There  does\r\n\r\nnot  seem  to be any provision with regard to daily-rated\r\n\r\nworkers.  I think there is provision for those  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen employed continuously for a period of six months  or\r\n\r\nfor  those  who are self-employed. But what about  daily-rated people, such as building site workers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am happy to clarify that.\r\n\r\nThere  are  two types of daily-rated workers.  One  is  a\r\n\r\nperson who, although he may be daily-rated, is on regular\r\n\r\nemployment  in a firm. To that extent, he is  covered  by\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  of this Bill. The other type  are  often\r\n\r\ncasual   workers  going  from  one  place   to   another,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in the construction industry.  It  is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult   to  cover  them  here  because  they   change\r\n\r\nemployers  so  often  that you cannot  pin  them  to  any\r\n\r\nparticular  employer. In effect, such people  would  come\r\n\r\nunder  the  category of \"own account\" workers,  of  which\r\n\r\nthere are quite a substantial number in the reservists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. -[Dr Goh Keng Swee].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE COUNCIL OF SOCIAL SERVICE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.02 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Council of Social Service (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill  was introduced in Parliament on 23rd October, 1974.\r\n\r\nThis Bill, now before the House, seeks to make amendments\r\n\r\nto  the Singapore Council of Social Service Act, 1968, in\r\n\r\nthe  light  of  the experience gained by the  Council  in\r\n\r\nadministering the Act over the years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council was formally established with the following\r\n\r\nobjectives:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to co-ordinate the voluntary welfare activities in\r\n\r\nSingapore not only between its member organisations,  but\r\n\r\nalso with other organisations;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to maintain and improve standards of voluntary\r\n\r\nsocial work and to encourage voluntary welfare efforts in\r\n\r\nfields not fully covered by Government;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to assist member organisations in their efforts to\r\n\r\npromote welfare activities in Singapore;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to initiate, assist and organise forms of relief\r\n\r\nand schemes of social service;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) to disseminate information to members of the public\r\n\r\nand  interest  them  in  social welfare  matters  and  to\r\n\r\nencourage their participation in these matters; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) to make recommendations to Government regarding\r\n\r\nlegislation in the field of social welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of administering the Act to achieve these\r\n\r\nobjectives, the Council has encountered some problems and\r\n\r\nthis  is  why my Ministry has proposed the amendments  in\r\n\r\nthis Bill. I shall now elaborate on these problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past experience shows that many purely religious and\r\n\r\nnon-welfare related organisations have sought affiliation\r\n\r\nwith the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Council's main interest and focus is on\r\n\r\nwelfare and social service. It is therefore proposed that\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Council of Social Service Act be amended to\r\n\r\nlimit    purely   religious   and   non-welfare   related\r\n\r\norganisations  from seeking affiliation to  the  Council.\r\n\r\nSuch organisations which seek to carry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  welfare  and social service activities and  wish  to\r\n\r\naffiliate  with  the  Council must establish  a  separate\r\n\r\nstructure  for  social and welfare activities  and  could\r\n\r\nthen seek affiliation in their own right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under current legislation, any person, firm,\r\n\r\ncorporation  or  organisation which subscribes  not  less\r\n\r\nthan  $25  per  year may be an associate of the  Council.\r\n\r\nLikewise, any organisation affiliated to the Council must\r\n\r\nsubscribe  not less than $10 to the Council. The  Council\r\n\r\nhas,  among  its  associates and member organisations,  a\r\n\r\nwide-ranging  group of bodies, including many  well-known\r\n\r\nfirms  and corporations. The present subscription of  $25\r\n\r\nper annum for associates can be considered negligible. My\r\n\r\nMinistry  therefore proposes an amendment  to  allow  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  to  charge any subscription it  thinks  fit  for\r\n\r\nassociates as well as for member organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many people who are interested in welfare\r\n\r\nwork but who, for some personal reason, do not wish to be\r\n\r\nattached  to  any  particular welfare organisation.  Such\r\n\r\npeople  should be encouraged, nevertheless, to contribute\r\n\r\ntowards the work of the Council. It is proposed that  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  be empowered to appoint such people as  honorary\r\n\r\nmembers, in addition to the patrons-in-chief and  patrons\r\n\r\nwhom  the  Council is already authorised to  appoint.  In\r\n\r\nthis  way, more people could contribute actively  towards\r\n\r\nthe  work  of  the Council. Such honorary  members  will,\r\n\r\nhowever, be restricted from holding office and voting  in\r\n\r\nthe Board of Management of the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Board of Management, whose members are\r\n\r\nelected   by   the   Council  from   among   its   member\r\n\r\norganisations  and associates or are ex-officio  members,\r\n\r\nthere   is  a  provision  in  the  Amendment  Bill  which\r\n\r\nstipulates  that  only those who are confirmed  as  still\r\n\r\nbeing representatives of member organisations can be  re-elected  to office in the Board. In this way, the Council\r\n\r\nhopes  to  ensure that only those who are still  actively\r\n\r\ninvolved  in the work of its various members are  allowed\r\n\r\nto be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelected  or to hold office on the Board of Management  of the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Annual General Meeting, the Council\r\n\r\nalso  holds  two  general meetings  each  year.  This  is\r\n\r\nspecified in the Singapore Council of Social Service Act.\r\n\r\nHowever, administratively the Council is now able to work\r\n\r\nmuch more closely with members and keep them informed  on\r\n\r\ndevelopments  through the various committees  set  up  to\r\n\r\nservice   members   as   well  as   other   channels   of\r\n\r\ncommunication  such  as circulars,  news  bulletin,  etc.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  there is no further need to have two  general\r\n\r\nmeetings  a  year.  This is why it is proposed  that  the\r\n\r\nfrequency of general meetings be reduced to just  once  a\r\n\r\nyear  (excluding the Annual General Meeting) in order  to\r\n\r\nencourage  greater participation on the  committee  level\r\n\r\nwhich  is  a  much more effective means of  relating  and\r\n\r\ninvolving members to come together to further the objects\r\n\r\nof the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed that the Council be vested with the\r\n\r\npower  to  make its own regulations concerning procedural\r\n\r\nmatters  on  application for and withdrawal of membership\r\n\r\nin  the Council, the conduct of general meetings and  the\r\n\r\nsubmission   of   reports   and   returns    by    member\r\n\r\norganisations.  It is felt that the Council  should  have\r\n\r\nthese  powers in order to be more effective  as  the  co-ordinating  body  for  voluntary  welfare  activities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It  also  keeps  the  public  and   community\r\n\r\ninformed  on  current trends and developments  among  its\r\n\r\nmember   organisations  and  the  welfare  community   in\r\n\r\ngeneral.  The  regulations which the Council  intends  to\r\n\r\nmake  are  subject  to the approval of the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nSocial Affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to remove doubt as to whether the Council is\r\n\r\nauthorised to accept gifts and procure contributions  not\r\n\r\nonly to the Singapore Council of Social Service Fund  but\r\n\r\nto  establish and administer trust funds, it is  proposed\r\n\r\nto amend the Act to enable the Council to administer such\r\n\r\ntrusts.   From  time  to  time,  the  Council  has   been\r\n\r\napproached by Foundations and Trusts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto hold monies in trust but because of the uncertainty\r\n\r\nregarding its power in this matter, the Council has been\r\n\r\nunable to act on these offers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the need to maintain the spirit of voluntary\r\n\r\nsocial  work  among  Singaporeans,  it  is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nprovide  the Council with an effective framework for  the\r\n\r\nachievement of its objectives.

It also seeks to revise the\r\n\r\npenalties provided for certain offences prescribed  under\r\n\r\nthe Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to repeal subsection (2) of\r\n\r\nsection  3 of the Act which enables an unlawful  occupant\r\n\r\nof State land to defeat the action of the Commissioner of\r\n\r\nLands  to  recover  possession of State  land  by  merely\r\n\r\nraising  a  claim of title to the land.  In  most  cases,\r\n\r\nthere  is no substance in the claim, which merely  delays\r\n\r\nproceedings.  A  new subsection is to be enacted  in  its\r\n\r\nplace  to provide that when a claim of title is  made  by\r\n\r\nthe  occupant  charged  with the unlawful  occupation  of\r\n\r\nState land, the defendant may apply to the High Court for\r\n\r\nthe  action to be transferred to that Court on the ground\r\n\r\nthat the defendant is claiming title to the land.

Under clause  3,\r\n\r\nwhich  amends  section 4 of the Act, the Government  will\r\n\r\nnow  be  empowered  to  seize  and  forfeit  any  movable\r\n\r\nproperty  found  on  State land when it  is  not  removed\r\n\r\nwithin 28 days of an eviction notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 4, which amends section 7 of the Act, it\r\n\r\nwill  be  an offence for any person to trespass on  State\r\n\r\nland  by  depositing, placing or throwing any article  or\r\n\r\nthing  whatsoever, or any waste, refuse  or  other  thing\r\n\r\nonto  State  land.

It was debated  with  an\r\n\r\nintensity  not  often seen in the recent history  of  our\r\n\r\nparliamentary proceedings. This was for the  reason  that\r\n\r\nit  raised  important social, economic, humanitarian  and\r\n\r\nreligious issues which touched the conscience of many.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the debate, points for and against the\r\n\r\nBill were exhaustively put and argued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposing arguments against the Bill that were put\r\n\r\nforward   were  of  three  categories.  They   were   the\r\n\r\nReligious,  Moral or Ethical, and Medical  objections  to\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.  I  had  then refuted the opposing  arguments,\r\n\r\nalthough many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  them were highly theoretical and speculative.  As  it\r\n\r\nhas  turned out, nearly five years of experience  of  the\r\n\r\noperation of the Abortion Act has proved that many of the\r\n\r\nmoral  and medical objections to the Bill were unfounded.\r\n\r\nFor  example, availability of legalised abortions has not\r\n\r\nled to the breaking down of moral standards and increased\r\n\r\npromiscuity. Neither has it led to increase  in  maternal\r\n\r\nmortality and morbidity for our pregnant women. In  fact,\r\n\r\nduring  the whole period of nearly five years  there  was\r\n\r\nnot  one  single death or permanent disablement resulting\r\n\r\nfrom the several thousands of legalised abortions done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the religious arguments against legalised\r\n\r\nabortions for obvious reasons could not then as  well  as\r\n\r\nnow  be  proved or disproved. As I have stated  then,  to\r\n\r\nallow   ourselves  to  be  tied  up  with  the  religious\r\n\r\narguments  for and against abortions, which in  any  case\r\n\r\nwould  never result in any conclusion even if the  debate\r\n\r\nwent on till the cows came home, was entirely futile. The\r\n\r\nreligious viewpoints must necessarily be based  on  one's\r\n\r\nown  religious  beliefs and faith as well as  conscience.\r\n\r\nAnd these must differ from individual to individual. They\r\n\r\ninclude  one's  belief as to whether the  foetus  can  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  human  life, which learned  men,  medical  or\r\n\r\notherwise for centuries have still not been able to agree\r\n\r\non.  Of  course, the religious beliefs and conscience  of\r\n\r\nany  individual is to be respected. But at the same time,\r\n\r\nshould  not a pregnant woman be entitled as of  right  to\r\n\r\nrequest  in  good  conscience  for  and  be  granted  the\r\n\r\ntermination  of  her pregnancy if it  will  lead  to  her\r\n\r\ngreater  benefit and happiness? Further, is it  right  in\r\n\r\nour   multi-racial   and  multi-religious   society   for\r\n\r\nopponents to the liberalisation of the law on abortion to\r\n\r\nimpose their moral or religious standards upon the entire\r\n\r\ncommunity?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in drafting the Act and in its introduction\r\n\r\nfive  years ago, it was in deference to some of the  more\r\n\r\nvalid  arguments  against unrestricted liberalisation  of\r\n\r\nabortion that many safeguards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere   included  in  the  Act.  For  some  who  supported\r\n\r\nlegalised   abortion  it  appeared  to  be   rather   too\r\n\r\nrestrictive. In fact, Mr Speaker, Sir, you as one of  the\r\n\r\nspeakers supporting its introduction, as Member  for  Joo\r\n\r\nChiat, stated then that the Act was too restrictive to be\r\n\r\neffective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was for this reason that the Bill was sent to Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.   Here  oral  and  written  submissions   were\r\n\r\ncarefully  considered and weighed, resulting in  some  of\r\n\r\nthe  suggestions being incorporated in the final  version\r\n\r\nas passed by Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also for the same reason that the Act was given\r\n\r\na  limited life span of four years of operation with  the\r\n\r\npossibility of extension of one year, and one year  only.\r\n\r\nThe object was that Parliament should have an opportunity\r\n\r\nto review operations and effects of the Act at the end of\r\n\r\nthe  stated  period. Parliament would  then  be  able  to\r\n\r\ndetermine whether the Act should be allowed to lapse  and\r\n\r\ncast  into limbo as a social experiment which has  failed\r\n\r\nor  to  be re-introduced and made a permanent feature  of\r\n\r\nthe Statutes of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to report to Parliament here that this\r\n\r\nsocial  experiment on legalised abortions has been highly\r\n\r\nsuccessful. In some instances it has more than  fulfilled\r\n\r\nour  expectations. I therefore urge this House to support\r\n\r\nand pass this re-enacted legislation which has been drawn\r\n\r\nup  on the experience of operating the Act over the  last\r\n\r\n4\u00bd years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information of the past 4\u00bd years is best given in\r\n\r\nthe  form  of  figures which should speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe  tables are given in the Addendum (Appendix I, cols 1151-4), \r\n\r\nto my speech which I have distributed to Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me highlight some of the facts as we may derive\r\n\r\nfrom these figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of abortions done each year since the law\r\n\r\nwas  brought into effect in 1970 was gradually built  up,\r\n\r\naveraging around 4,000 a year. Relating these figures  to\r\n\r\nthe total number of live births, as it is usually done in\r\n\r\nreporting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1974/19741106/19741106-HA-0331151.pdf\"\">APPENDIX I - CHARACTERISTICS OF WOMEN WHO HAD LEGALISED ABORTION 1970-1973 (Cols 1151-1152) </a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1974/19741106/19741106-HA-0331153.pdf\"\">APPENDIX I - RESULT OF APPLICATION FOR LEGALISED ABORTION (Cols 1153-1154)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  figures for purposes of comparison, the  number  of\r\n\r\nabortions  which were procured under the Act  was  7  per\r\n\r\ncent  of  all live births in Singapore from 1970 to  1972\r\n\r\nand 10.3 per cent in 1973. The rate in 1974 projected for\r\n\r\nthe  whole  year may exceed this figure. You will  recall\r\n\r\nthat  the  estimates  given  at  the  time  the  Act  was\r\n\r\nintroduced was that it would amount to about 10 per  cent\r\n\r\nof  all  births.  The rate of abortion recorded  is  thus\r\n\r\nwithin our original estimate. It is also well within  the\r\n\r\nrates  reported  in other countries, which  have  similar\r\n\r\nliberalised abortion laws. In the United Kingdom the rate\r\n\r\nis  14  per  cent  of  all births. In  Denmark  the  rate\r\n\r\nrecorded was 12.7 per cent in 1970, the United States  13\r\n\r\nper cent in 1971, in Sweden 16.8 per cent in 1971 and  in\r\n\r\nJapan 37.8 per cent in 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to the fears expressed in the original debate,\r\n\r\nour pregnant women have not been turning to abortions  in\r\n\r\ngreat numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The categories of women who had aborted provide some\r\n\r\nfurther interesting information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ethnic groups of those who had aborted were in\r\n\r\napproximate   proportion  of   their   numbers   in   the\r\n\r\npopulation.  In  other words, abortions had  been  sought\r\n\r\nequally by all our ethnic groups. This indicates  that  a\r\n\r\ncommon  need  for  legalised abortion among  these  women\r\n\r\nwhich  transcended  cultural and religious  barriers  had\r\n\r\nbeen met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breakdown of the abortion figures by class of\r\n\r\npersons  on  the basis of the combined income  of  family\r\n\r\nindicates  that  the  vast majority  of  women  who  seek\r\n\r\nabortions are those in the lower income group. The median\r\n\r\nincome is less than $300 per month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the marital status of the women who had\r\n\r\nabortions,  more  than 90 per cent of them  were  married\r\n\r\nwomen.  The  median number of children they  had  is  4.3\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to the warnings made by those who opposed\r\n\r\nabortions  that legalisation of abortions would encourage\r\n\r\npromiscuity, the number of unmarried\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwomen  who had abortions numbered only 5 per cent of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  number of abortions done in the first four  years,\r\n\r\nand 9 per cent in the first half of this year. This is in\r\n\r\ncontrast  with  the experience in other  countries  where\r\n\r\nabortions on the unmarried were very much higher. In  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom it amounted to nearly 50 per cent of  all\r\n\r\nabortions done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these are conclusive proof that our expectations of\r\n\r\nthe  Act  were  correct. The Act provided  an  avenue  of\r\n\r\nescape  for  our married women, especially those  in  the\r\n\r\nlower  income  group, to be freed from the burden  of  an\r\n\r\nunwanted or unintended pregnancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another fear that was voiced was that our women would\r\n\r\nprefer    abortions   to   the   somewhat    inconvenient\r\n\r\ncontraceptive practice. It was argued that they will turn\r\n\r\nto  abortions  and come over and over again for  repeated\r\n\r\nabortions whenever they become pregnant. This fear is now\r\n\r\nproved  to be unfounded. The number of persons  who  have\r\n\r\nhad  more  than one abortion have numbered only  6.6  per\r\n\r\ncent of the total number of abortions undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fear can also be put to rest on the basis of the\r\n\r\nfollowing  two  facts:  (a)  since  the  Act  came   into\r\n\r\noperation  4\u00bd  years  ago, the  total  number  of  family\r\n\r\nplanning acceptors attending the family planning  clinics\r\n\r\nhas  consistently been in excess of the targets set;  (b)\r\n\r\ncontraceptions  must  have been practised  in  increasing\r\n\r\nnumbers  to have reduced both the crude birth  rates  and\r\n\r\nthe  absolute  number of children born  in  Singapore.  A\r\n\r\npaper studying the various methods which have contributed\r\n\r\nto this fall in birth in Singapore ascribed contraceptive\r\n\r\npractice  as being responsible for about 50 per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthe  births averted while abortions were responsible only\r\n\r\nfor about 6 per cent of births averted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, there is evidence to suggest that overall\r\n\r\ncontraceptive  practice improved since the liberalisation\r\n\r\nof   abortions,  due  to  post-abortal  family   planning\r\n\r\ncounselling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To quote figures in support, in 1972, there were 788\r\n\r\npost-abortal sterilizations. This works out to  about  14\r\n\r\nper  cent of the total number of sterilizations in  1972.\r\n\r\nIn  1973, the number of post-abortal sterilizations  rose\r\n\r\nto  2,056  which works out to 23 per cent  of  the  total\r\n\r\nnumber  of  sterilizations in that year. In  1972,  there\r\n\r\nwere  428  new  family planning acceptors  through  post-abortal motivation. This works out to about 2.4 per  cent\r\n\r\nof  the  total number of new acceptors in 1972. In  1973,\r\n\r\nthe   number   of  new  acceptors  through   post-abortal\r\n\r\nmotivation rose to 483 which works out to 2.5 per cent of\r\n\r\nthe total number of new acceptors in that year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore clear that contraceptive practice is\r\n\r\nthe accepted and preferred mode of limiting the number of\r\n\r\nchildren  in families. This is as it should be.  Further,\r\n\r\nto   encourage  contraceptive  practice,  women  must  be\r\n\r\nconfident  that  if these fail - as they do  sometimes  - they  can  fall back on readily available abortion.  Thus\r\n\r\nlegalised abortion is a very important complement to  our\r\n\r\nalready comprehensive family planning programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another expressed fear was on the safety of the\r\n\r\nprocedures  for  an operation of abortion.  Here  no  one\r\n\r\ncould  deny  the fact that under any operative  procedure\r\n\r\nthere  would be an element of risk, no matter how  small.\r\n\r\nThe  mortality  figures of abortions published  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries had ranged from 2 to 30 deaths per one  hundred\r\n\r\nthousand. We were very conscious of such hazards.  But  I\r\n\r\nam glad to announce that throughout this entire period of\r\n\r\n4\u00bd  years, not a single death has occurred from abortions\r\n\r\nperformed  under the provisions of the Act. In  contrast,\r\n\r\nyou  will  have read recent reports in the press relating\r\n\r\nto deaths from illegal abortions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complications resulting from abortions under the Act\r\n\r\nhave also been of a very minor nature. There have been  a\r\n\r\nfew  complications such as excessive bleeding. But in all\r\n\r\nof these the patients were restored to health without any\r\n\r\npermanent disablement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been suggested, in certain studies, that there\r\n\r\nmight  be  adverse psychological effects, such  as  guilt\r\n\r\nfeelings   and   emotional  aftermaths   resulting   from\r\n\r\nabortions. A study on the psychological effects, if  any,\r\n\r\non  patients  who had undergone abortions  was  therefore\r\n\r\nundertaken  by  our  psychiatrists and  psychologists  in\r\n\r\ncollaboration with our obstetricians. The total number of\r\n\r\npersons investigated were all the cases done in the first\r\n\r\nyear.  They  were  followed  up  throughout  the  period.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  full analysis of the results  is  not  yet\r\n\r\navailable, the preliminary indications are that there has\r\n\r\nbeen  no  major or minor psychological effects:  such  as\r\n\r\nemotional upset or mental anguish in the short  term  nor\r\n\r\nhas  there been any adverse effects observed in the women\r\n\r\nin  the long term. On the contrary, the findings indicate\r\n\r\nthat  the  women  have been immensely relieved  when  the\r\n\r\nabortions were over and perhaps, for these reasons,  have\r\n\r\nbenefited mentally by having had the abortions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A psychiatrist reporting on the psychological effects\r\n\r\nof  abortion  had stated that the notion of post-abortion\r\n\r\nmental illness is probably a myth, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Abortion far from being a precipitative of psychiatric\r\n\r\nillness,  is actually a defence against it. For  a  woman\r\n\r\nwho  has  let her life be directed by forces  outside  of\r\n\r\nherself,  to make a decision to take charge of  her  life\r\n\r\ncan  be  an  extremely liberalising, positive experience.\r\n\r\nFor  the first time in her life she is master (or  rather\r\n\r\nmistress) of her destiny.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Conversely, a British woman psychiatrist, contended from\r\n\r\nher studies on British women that -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If they are refused (abortions) their mental and\r\n\r\nphysical health, their family life and often their\r\n\r\nchildren's future can be catastrophically affected.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of various disincentives against\r\n\r\nlarge  family  size  and to promote acceptance  of  small\r\n\r\nfamilies, there should be made available the entire range\r\n\r\nof  facilities ranging from family planning  services  to\r\n\r\nabortion facilities. Failure, Mr Speaker, Sir, to provide\r\n\r\nthese  facilities  would be regarded  as  perpetrating  a\r\n\r\ncruel fraud on our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In concluding the review, it is with a sense of\r\n\r\nsatisfaction  and fulfilment to know that  this  historic\r\n\r\nsocial  experiment was timely and had achieved  its  main\r\n\r\nobjectives.  It has freed our women from the  tyranny  of\r\n\r\nunintended  and unwanted pregnancies. It has  provided  a\r\n\r\nreliable,  safe  method  in  terminating  these  unwanted\r\n\r\npregnancies,  particularly for the benefit of  women  who\r\n\r\ncould  least  afford to continue with  such  pregnancies.\r\n\r\nThese  were  achieved without the dire  consequences,  as\r\n\r\nprophesied by some, of a lowering of moral standards  and\r\n\r\nincrease   in   promiscuity.  Nor  has  there   been   an\r\n\r\nabandonment  of  contraceptive  practice  in  determining\r\n\r\nfamily  size. Abortions were resorted to by a  relatively\r\n\r\nsmall segment of the population. It acted as an important\r\n\r\ncomplement    to   family   planning   by    conventional\r\n\r\ncontraceptive methods. A spin-off from this has been that\r\n\r\nlegalised   abortions  have  contributed   to   a   small\r\n\r\npercentage of the total number of births averted  in  the\r\n\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was, however, one objective, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhich  was  not  reached. This was the reduction  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  illegal  abortions. We did  not  expect  that\r\n\r\nillegal abortions could be eradicated completely  but  it\r\n\r\nwas hoped that these would be reduced to an insignificant\r\n\r\nnumber.  It is not possible, of course, to determine  the\r\n\r\nexact   numbers   which   have   been   done   illegally.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  an  indication of  their  numbers  is  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  septic  abortions which are  treated  in  the\r\n\r\nhospitals.  These  abortions are  done  through  criminal\r\n\r\ninterference, mainly by unqualified quacks. Although  the\r\n\r\nnumber of septic abortions treated in our hospitals  have\r\n\r\nmore  than  halved what they were during  the  first  two\r\n\r\nyears  when the law was brought into effect, it is  still\r\n\r\nsignificant.  This is a problem which was borne  in  mind\r\n\r\nwhen the new Bill now before the House was being drafted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Bill now before the House is the result of the\r\n\r\nsum  total  of  experience gathered in the  4\u00bd  years  of\r\n\r\noperation of the Abortion Act. Thus, Mr Speaker, Sir,  we\r\n\r\nare  now  in  a much happier position than when  we  were\r\n\r\nformulating the Abortion Act five years\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nago.  We then had no experience of our own to go  by  but\r\n\r\nhad  to  depend  on certain assumptions as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nexperience  of  other  countries.  We  then  had  to   be\r\n\r\nextremely  cautious. On the other hand, in drafting  this\r\n\r\nnew Bill we have before us all the concrete experience of\r\n\r\nthe achievements as well as the drawbacks of the existing\r\n\r\nAct.  We  therefore have the advantage of being  able  to\r\n\r\nmake decisive amendments to the Act free from speculative\r\n\r\ndoubts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, since five years ago the attitudes of the vast\r\n\r\nmajority of our people towards family planning, legalised\r\n\r\nabortions   and   voluntary  sterilizations   have   also\r\n\r\nundergone  radical change. More than 60 per cent  of  our\r\n\r\neligible  population are currently using  contraceptives.\r\n\r\nAnother  17 per cent have used contraceptives  some  time\r\n\r\nearlier  although not currently practising  contraception\r\n\r\nfor various reasons such as planning for a child, husband\r\n\r\naway and so on. Another 11 per cent have been voluntarily\r\n\r\nsterilized. Thus the attitude towards family planning  is\r\n\r\nnow one of acceptance on the part of the vast majority of\r\n\r\nour   people.  Favourable  attitudes  towards   voluntary\r\n\r\nsterilizations and legalised abortions are  fast  gaining\r\n\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attitudes towards legalised abortions have also changed\r\n\r\nconsiderably  in many countries of the world.  There  are\r\n\r\nnow  55  countries  in  the world  which  have  legalised\r\n\r\nabortions on \"extended\" grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since the passage of our Abortion Act\r\n\r\nthere  have  also  been  advances in  the  techniques  of\r\n\r\nprocuring abortions. Technically the conventional  method\r\n\r\nat  the time when the Act was passed, was to evacuate the\r\n\r\nwomb  by  dilation and curettage. Now there  are  simpler\r\n\r\ntechniques  which are just as effective,  less  traumatic\r\n\r\nand  very  much  safer,  such  as  evacuation  by  vacuum\r\n\r\nsuction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most promising advances are in the use of drugs\r\n\r\nto  procure  abortions. There are now abortificant  pills\r\n\r\nwhich  are known in common parlance as \"the morning after\r\n\r\npill\" and others euphemistically as \"menstrual regulating\r\n\r\npills\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  ones under intensive testing are the \"prostagladins\"\r\n\r\nwhich  appear  to  be  the most efficient  abortificants.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  these are still mainly  experimental.  We\r\n\r\nhave  on  our  own  been conducting large-scale  clinical\r\n\r\ntrials  of  several  of  these drugs  in  our  Government\r\n\r\nhospitals  but  they  have not  as  yet  been  completely\r\n\r\nevaluated to justify release for general use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence with these new developments and with the changed\r\n\r\nclimate of thinking and attitudes this new Abortion  Bill\r\n\r\nis presented for re-enactment. The basic change reflected\r\n\r\nin the Bill over the existing Act which will be repealed,\r\n\r\nis  that the decision to carry out an abortion will  rest\r\n\r\nwith  the  pregnant  woman  and  the  registered  medical\r\n\r\npractitioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have deliberately avoided the use of this phrase\r\n\r\n\"abortion on demand\". It tends to be emotive. Some  would\r\n\r\nuse this term to describe the position when abortions can\r\n\r\nbe  done,  but within prescribed conditions.  This  would\r\n\r\nmean  removing  from  the penal and  medical  codes,  all\r\n\r\nconditions   that  make  abortion  subject   to   special\r\n\r\nrestrictions, penalties or procedures except  those  that\r\n\r\napply  generally to sound medical practice. Others  would\r\n\r\nrestrict usage of the term \"abortion on demand\" where the\r\n\r\nrequest  for  abortion  must be acceded  to  on  pain  of\r\n\r\npenalty  to  the  doctor approached by a pregnant  woman.\r\n\r\nThis,  in  fact, is the present position in Sweden  under\r\n\r\ntheir legislation. The position envisaged in this Bill is\r\n\r\nakin   to   the  former  position  plus  certain  special\r\n\r\nsafeguards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safeguards in the existing Act are retained. This\r\n\r\nhas  been  done particularly to ensure that the  abortion\r\n\r\nprocedures   are  undertaken  safely.  The  conscientious\r\n\r\nobjection  clause against participation in  treatment  to\r\n\r\nterminate pregnancy has also been retained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, two major restrictive provisions in the\r\n\r\nAct have been removed. They are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The abolition of the Termination of Pregnancy Board;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The period of pregnancy where abortion can be done\r\n\r\nhas been extended from 16 weeks to 24 weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing Act all applications for abortions\r\n\r\nhad  to  be  authorised by the Board before any abortions\r\n\r\ncould  be  undertaken  except  of  course  in  cases   of\r\n\r\nemergencies.  Experience has shown that the  need  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough  the  Board has resulted in delays. Although  the\r\n\r\nBoard  processed  applications with  des-patch,  it  took\r\n\r\nabout  a  week  from  receipt of  an  application  to  an\r\n\r\nabortion  being done. This might appear  to  be  a  short\r\n\r\nperiod  but  a  delay of a week is crucial  in  procuring\r\n\r\nabortions. The reason is that with every passing day  the\r\n\r\npregnancy  advances and the more difficult and  hazardous\r\n\r\nthe operation becomes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the figures, it is noted that between 12 per cent\r\n\r\nand  25  per  cent  of  those  who  had  their  abortions\r\n\r\nauthorised  by  the  Board  did  not  turn  up  for   the\r\n\r\noperation. A study of these cases revealed that  a  large\r\n\r\nnumber were rather desperate and were unable to wait even\r\n\r\nfor  one  week for their abortions to be done. Many  thus\r\n\r\nwent to have the abortions done illegally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the other reasons advanced as to why illegal\r\n\r\nabortions still flourish is that many persons who want an\r\n\r\nabortion are very reluctant to apply to a Board and  have\r\n\r\ntheir applications assessed by a panel of persons. It  is\r\n\r\ntrue that no matter how reliably secret records are kept,\r\n\r\nwomen  would  naturally shy away from making known  their\r\n\r\nsecrets.  In  the United Kingdom a Commission  which  was\r\n\r\nappointed  to  review their Abortion Act touched  on  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion  that  a  panel should be formed  to  consider\r\n\r\napplications  for abortions. The Justice Lane  Commission\r\n\r\n(as  it  was  called) quite categorically  rejected  this\r\n\r\nnotion  of setting up panels for adjudication. A  Supreme\r\n\r\nCourt  ruling in the United States in 1973 by Mr  Justice\r\n\r\nHarry  Blackmun also rejected the demand that a panel  of\r\n\r\npersons should approve abortions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second major departure from the existing Act is\r\n\r\nthat  the period of pregnancy when abortions can be  done\r\n\r\nhas been extended from 16 weeks to 24 weeks. This may, on\r\n\r\nsuperficial consideration, be considered a risky step. It\r\n\r\nshould, however, be noted that the existing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAct allows for abortions to be undertaken up to  the\r\n\r\n24th  week on medical ground but up to the 16th  week  on\r\n\r\nsocio-economic grounds. Therefore, this extension does no\r\n\r\nmore  than reflect the basic change in the Bill which  is\r\n\r\nthat the decision to carry out an abortion should be made\r\n\r\nby  a qualified doctor and his patient. As it should  be,\r\n\r\nthe  decision  will depend on the doctor's assessment  of\r\n\r\nwhether or not an abortion can be safely done. If in  the\r\n\r\ndoctor's  assessment  the abortion  should  not  be  done\r\n\r\nbecause  it might be too advanced, even if it is  at  the\r\n\r\n16th week, then the abortion should not be carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An upper limit of 24 weeks is imposed as it is\r\n\r\ngenerally  accepted that a foetus may be  viable  outside\r\n\r\nthe  mother after the 24th week. Thus after 24  weeks  of\r\n\r\ngestation the operation should be looked upon as inducing\r\n\r\na premature birth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the safeguards in the existing Act which are\r\n\r\nretained  in the new Bill are as follows. Abortions  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  carried out in Government hospitals  or  in\r\n\r\napproved   institutions.  The  doctors  who   carry   out\r\n\r\nabortions   will  have  to  be  officers  working   under\r\n\r\nsupervision in Government hospitals or those who have the\r\n\r\nprescribed  qualifications  and  experience.  It  is   an\r\n\r\noffence  to  coerce a person to submit to abortion.  Also\r\n\r\nretained  is  the provision that abortions  can  only  be\r\n\r\nundertaken on Singapore citizens or their wives  and,  in\r\n\r\nthe  case of other women, only if they have been resident\r\n\r\nin Singapore for at least four months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking into the future when abortions may be procured\r\n\r\nentirely  by  prescription,  a  new  provision  has  been\r\n\r\nintroduced  in  the Bill which will allow any  registered\r\n\r\nmedical practitioner to abort a pregnant woman if  it  is\r\n\r\nprocured solely by drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons that the law has proven to have met a\r\n\r\nneed  that  it  offers  a  safe and  reliable  method  of\r\n\r\nterminating unintended and unwanted pregnancies and  that\r\n\r\nmany  of  the  misgivings  expressed  by  those  who  had\r\n\r\nreservations about the law have proved unfounded,  I  now\r\n\r\nurge  the House to overwhelmingly approve this Bill  that\r\n\r\nwill further liberalise our laws on abortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the re-enactment of this Bill, the liberation of\r\n\r\nour  women from unwanted and unintended pregnancies  will\r\n\r\nbe enshrined in a permanent statute of our Republic. This\r\n\r\nwill also ensure that every child born in Singapore is  a\r\n\r\nwanted child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, however, fully conscious that however\r\n\r\noverwhelming  the  evidence,  be  they  medical,   socio-economic, or humanitarian that is presented to prove that\r\n\r\nthe  re-enactment of the Bill is m the best  interest  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore, there will still be  some  who\r\n\r\nwill  oppose  it  on  grounds of  religious  beliefs  and\r\n\r\nconscience. But these opposing views must remain personal\r\n\r\njudgments. They will, of course, be respected. But it  is\r\n\r\nnot right in our multi-racial and multi-religious society\r\n\r\nthat  these personal judgments and dogmas be imposed upon\r\n\r\nthose who do not hold such views and beliefs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember in the debate in this House five years ago\r\n\r\non  the existing Act, I referred to a minority group  who\r\n\r\non  their out-of-date beliefs had hitherto stood  opposed\r\n\r\nto  the introduction of birth control in Singapore. As  I\r\n\r\nsaid  then,  Mr  Speaker,  the  negative  stand  of  this\r\n\r\nminority  group  had  found itself  in  the  dustbins  of\r\n\r\nhistory.  I had also stated then that the opposing  stand\r\n\r\nto the Abortion Bill would in the course of time also end\r\n\r\nup  in  the dustbins of history. I can now say  that  the\r\n\r\ncourse of history in the last five years has proved  this\r\n\r\nprediction to be correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, in respecting the religious and ethical\r\n\r\nbeliefs  of  individual hon. Members, is withdrawing  the\r\n\r\nWhip in this debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have every confidence in\r\n\r\nthe   good   sense  of  judgment,  fair  play  and   high\r\n\r\nhumanitarian principles of our hon. Members in that  they\r\n\r\nwill  not oppose the re-enactment of the Bill when it  is\r\n\r\nclear  to  them  that it is in the best interest  of  the\r\n\r\npeople   of  Singapore  even  though  some,  because   of\r\n\r\nreligious  beliefs, may not personally be  in  favour  of\r\n\r\nabortion.

Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth  has  given a very long explanation  on  abortion.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no doubt that he has made mention  of  Western\r\n\r\ncountries or Europe, but he has never made any mention of\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Is not Singapore in Southeast Asia?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> It is in Southeast Asia, but\r\n\r\nmention  has been made of Singapore only, and  not  other\r\n\r\ncountries. You may recall that when the Abortion Bill was\r\n\r\nfirst introduced in Parliament five years ago, I was  one\r\n\r\nof  those who spoke against it. However, it was passed by\r\n\r\na  majority decision, and I had no choice but to abide by\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today this Act is being amended. I wonder why the\r\n\r\nTermination  of  Pregnancy Board is to be abolished.  The\r\n\r\nAbortion  Act  is being liberalised and this  causes  the\r\n\r\nfear   that   henceforth  many  people  may  abuse   this\r\n\r\nprivilege.  I wonder whether the Minister is  encouraging\r\n\r\nthe  further killing of the foetus in the mother's  womb.\r\n\r\nDuring  the last few weeks, after this new Abortion  Bill\r\n\r\nwas  introduced in this Chamber, controversial  views  on\r\n\r\nthe  subject have been expressed by both doctors and  the\r\n\r\npeople,  some  of  which  have  appeared  in  the   daily\r\n\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I also understand that after the first\r\n\r\nAbortion  Bill was passed five years ago, there had  been\r\n\r\ncases  where  some  doctors were  not  happy  to  perform\r\n\r\nabortions. I have also learned that some doctors who were\r\n\r\nrequired  to perform abortions had pushed their cases  to\r\n\r\nother  doctors because they felt very bad  about  it.  In\r\n\r\nfact, a few of them had resigned from the service because\r\n\r\nof the nature of their duties. I do not know whether this\r\n\r\nis  right  or  wrong, but the Minister  should  know  it.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  Sir,  I do not support the abolition  of  the\r\n\r\nTermination of Pregnancy Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nSingapore  has a very limited land area. With no  natural\r\n\r\nresources and with a population of about 2.2 million,  it\r\n\r\nis  necessary  for  us to achieve zero population  growth\r\n\r\nthrough  family planning, sterilization and abortion.  If\r\n\r\nwe want to maintain our present standard of living and to\r\n\r\nenjoy  political and economic stability, it is  necessary\r\n\r\nfor  every one, especially the younger people,  to  limit\r\n\r\nhis  family  to two children. One must realise  that  the\r\n\r\npeace,  progress and prosperity of a country can only  be\r\n\r\nachieved  through  the  quality of  its  people  and  not\r\n\r\nquantity. Too many children in a family would be a burden\r\n\r\nto  oneself,  to society and to the government.  Unwanted\r\n\r\nchildren  are  not  cared for,  and  are  not  given  any\r\n\r\nparental  love.  They will not have nourishing  food  and\r\n\r\nproper  accommodation, and will thereby suffer physically\r\n\r\nand mentally. This will affect their ability to study and\r\n\r\neventually  they  will become school  dropouts,  juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquents,  drug addicts, gangsters and armed  robbers.\r\n\r\nTo  avoid all this misery and suffering, it is better  to\r\n\r\nlimit  one's  family to two children only through  family\r\n\r\nplanning,  sterilization and, if necessary only,  through\r\n\r\nabortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in legalising the case for abortion, I would\r\n\r\nrequest the Minister for Health and Home Affairs  to  get\r\n\r\nhis  staff  in the Medical Department to explain  to  the\r\n\r\nwomen through the media of publicity to make them realise\r\n\r\nthat  frequent  abortion  will affect  their  health  and\r\n\r\nendanger their lives. The Medical Department should  also\r\n\r\nexplain  to  them the advantages of family  planning  and\r\n\r\nsterilization,  which  are  far  better  than  undergoing\r\n\r\nabortion.  I would also like to suggest that the  charges\r\n\r\nfor  performing  an  abortion  should  be  fair  and,  if\r\n\r\npossible, limited to a certain rate to avoid unfair  high\r\n\r\ncharges.  The charges should be within the means  of  the\r\n\r\nlower income group workers too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after\r\n\r\nhearing the Minister for some 20 minutes, it appears that\r\n\r\nhe crows over the achievement of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbortion Act. According to the Minister's arguments,  the\r\n\r\nAbortion  Act  is to protect the woman who is  afraid  of\r\n\r\nhaving  more children. If that is the case, then I  think\r\n\r\nthis  Abortion Bill does not justify our support. I think\r\n\r\nthe  intention  of the Bill is more than  that,  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister has failed to explain it. That is why we  cannot\r\n\r\nagree  with him. Our arguments which had been put forward\r\n\r\nfive   years  ago  when  the  first  Abortion  Bill   was\r\n\r\nintroduced  in  this House still hold  water  today.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  has  said that the Abortion Act has  not  shown\r\n\r\nincrease  in  promiscuity.

He can get a battery of doctors under him to\r\n\r\nexplain  that there is no risk, and so forth.

But\r\n\r\nI  will not agree that liberalised abortion is to protect\r\n\r\nwomen because they do not want to have more children, nor\r\n\r\ndo  I  agree  with  him  that the  woman  just  wants  an\r\n\r\nabortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\npassing  of the Abortion Act five years ago was traumatic\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore, and now the liberalising of the Act  will\r\n\r\nbe  much  worse for us. I am just wondering  whether  the\r\n\r\nHon.  Minister's conscience is not pricked. It is  really\r\n\r\nstrange  that  he  comes  up with arguments  saying  that\r\n\r\npromiscuity has not increased in Singapore -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> As a result of abortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> - as a result of legalising abortion. From\r\n\r\nfigures I have before me, in 1970 there were 91 unmarried\r\n\r\nWomen  who  had legalised abortions; 1971 - 145;  1972  - 190;  1973  -  316;  and  January  to  June  1974  -  304 abortions.  These are unmarried women,  mind  you.  Among\r\n\r\ndivorced,  separated  and widowed  women,  there  was  an\r\n\r\nincrease from 21 in 1970 to 26 in 1971, 35 in 1972 and 47\r\n\r\nin 1973, and 42 between January and June 1974. This tells\r\n\r\nme  that  promiscuity has increased because of  legalised\r\n\r\nabortion.  In  addition to that, the Hon.  Minister  says\r\n\r\nthat  repeat abortions have decreased. Repeat  abortions,\r\n\r\naccording  to the figures, show: 1971 - 111;  1972  -269;\r\n\r\n1973  -  356;  January to June 1974 --379.  Here  again,\r\n\r\nthere  has been an increase of repeat abortions. I cannot\r\n\r\nfollow  the Hon. Minister's arguments and neither,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure,  can the other Members in the House. Not  a  single\r\n\r\ndeath,   he  says,  has  occurred  because  of  legalised\r\n\r\nabortions. How about the dying foetus? A foetus  that  is\r\n\r\nalive  with a soul, a foetus that is living in the mother\r\n\r\n-~   it  is  now  dead  because  of  abortion,  legalised\r\n\r\nabortion, legalised murder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fail to follow his arguments really and I exhort hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  not to support the Abortion Bill that  is  being\r\n\r\npresented to the House today. Our population needs to  be\r\n\r\nreduced, I agree; but Education, hon. Minister,  is  what\r\n\r\nis  required to get the people to realise that we need to\r\n\r\ndecrease our population because we do not have sufficient\r\n\r\nfood,  because we do not have sufficient land space,  and\r\n\r\nbecause  we  do not have what we need to have to  support\r\n\r\nsuch a large population. A decrease in sexual activity is\r\n\r\nwhat  we have to look for. Has the Minister done anything\r\n\r\nto  get  facts and figures to enable Singaporeans through\r\n\r\neducation to reduce their sexual activity? I believe that\r\n\r\nwe  are  trying  to  get away by using  the  easy  method\r\n\r\n-legalised abortion. That is how it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworks.  It  is surprising that with such intelligence  we\r\n\r\ncannot come up with something that will not harm not only\r\n\r\nthe mother but the living foetus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that this Abortion Bill will not involve the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in any extra financial expenditure.  This  is\r\n\r\ntrue. No extra financial expenditure is needed, hut I can\r\n\r\nassure  the Government that it will be involved in  extra\r\n\r\n\"moral and spiritual expenditure\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nmy  contribution is not as sex-oriented as  the  previous\r\n\r\nspeaker,  but  whatever the views against  abortion,  the\r\n\r\nproblem of too many bodies and so little food stares some\r\n\r\nnations  in the face, and what the future holds for  many\r\n\r\nof  the  people  of these nations is the tragedy  of  our\r\n\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid hardship among ourselves as a result of an\r\n\r\nundisciplined growth in the family unit in  our  society,\r\n\r\nwe  have family planning and family planning facility for\r\n\r\nour  peoples.  For 4\u00bd years now abortion  has  been  made\r\n\r\navailable  under certain conditions to our womenfolk  who\r\n\r\nrequest  for  it.  This Bill seeks to release  applicants\r\n\r\nfrom  some  o  these conditions and offer abortion  under\r\n\r\nminimal control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, Sir, there are matters for concern. Unless\r\n\r\nand  until family planning education reaches the populace\r\n\r\nin    general   and   secure   their   response   through\r\n\r\ncontraception and sterilization, there is in  my  view  a\r\n\r\nreal  likelihood that many may have to resort to abortion\r\n\r\nbecause  of  carelessness or indiscretion.  Abortion  may\r\n\r\nthen  be  accepted by the people and, in fact,  become  a\r\n\r\nprimary  means of controlling or planning their families.\r\n\r\nThis can be an unhealthy situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abortion in my view is both tragic and traumatic. There\r\n\r\nis  a  moral  disorganisation in  the  person  undergoing\r\n\r\nabortion,  the extent of the disorganisation  depends  on\r\n\r\nthe sensitivity of the person's moral character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying this situation at a societal level, there can\r\n\r\nresult  what is termed an anomie in society - a situation\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsociety  where  people  find it no  longer  pertinent  or\r\n\r\nmeaningful to relate their conduct with social norms as a\r\n\r\nresult of their personal experience or interpretation  of\r\n\r\nthe  pettiness of life and its qualities. It,  therefore,\r\n\r\nbecomes  imperative for the well-being of our society  to\r\n\r\nensure that our efforts in family planning education  are\r\n\r\nnot  relaxed.  Easily  available  abortion  must  be  and\r\n\r\nremain, as the Minister himself says it, a complement  to\r\n\r\ncontraception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the problem which this Bill attempts to deal with\r\n\r\ncannot  be gain-said. I believe we need to size down  our\r\n\r\nfamilies as proposed, in order that our children may live\r\n\r\nin  some  comfort  and  experience in  some  measure  the\r\n\r\nquality of life in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Sir, despite the\r\n\r\nconsiderable  self-satisfaction, even aplomb,  confidence\r\n\r\nand,  very  likely  in his mind, the positive  assertions\r\n\r\nwith  which the Minister has presented this Abortion Bill\r\n\r\nto  further liberalise the law relating to abortion,  the\r\n\r\nfacts   still  remain  that  abortion  is  a  very  vexed\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this House in 1969 and even now, you hear all sorts\r\n\r\nof  views, some very emotionally expressed, some  with  a\r\n\r\nlacing  of purported wit. Even the Minister has not  been\r\n\r\nfree   from  certain  emotion-charged  phraseology.  This\r\n\r\nproblem of abortion is certainly a very vexed question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many people in Singapore who look upon this\r\n\r\nAct  with grave misgivings; people who feel that abortion\r\n\r\nis  even  an outright abomination. These people  are  not\r\n\r\nrebels,  Mr  Speaker, Sir. They are not bad people.  They\r\n\r\nare  not  anti-Government. They  are  decent  law-abiding\r\n\r\npeople. I would expect that more than 70 per cent of such\r\n\r\npeople  voted  for the Government in the  last  election.\r\n\r\nThey  support the Government. The Minister would consider\r\n\r\nthem  very  sane, intelligent, rational,  and  even  good\r\n\r\nlooking   people.   I  myself  would  like   to   express\r\n\r\nconsiderable sympathy with the views of these people, and\r\n\r\nI would express it in as sombre a way as I can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt in\r\n\r\nmy  mind whatsoever that this Bill will be passed  today.\r\n\r\nLet  us  look at the reality of it all. Arranged opposite\r\n\r\nare  people  who will definitely cause this  Bill  to  be\r\n\r\npassed. Arranged on this side are people who are speaking\r\n\r\nwith  opposing voices. There is no doubt that  this  Bill\r\n\r\nwill  be  passed. At the same time, a climate of apparent\r\n\r\nsocial  approbation has been aroused  by  very  effective\r\n\r\nGovernment   propaganda,  and  I  am   using   the   word\r\n\r\n\"propaganda\" in the same way as it is used in  propaganda\r\n\r\nfide,   propagation  of  faith.  I  do  not  intend   any\r\n\r\npejorative implication. There has been effective  planned\r\n\r\npropaganda to sell the idea to the people, and the people\r\n\r\nhave  responded.  But  it is necessary  for  people  like\r\n\r\nmyself   and   others  to  assert  their  own  particular\r\n\r\nviewpoint and, having asserted that, to see what  can  be\r\n\r\ndone that is practical and what are the realities of  the\r\n\r\nsituation.  This  is the art of the possible.  We  expect\r\n\r\nthat there may be some ill-effects of this Bill. What can\r\n\r\nbe  done to mitigate such ill effects? One of the  things\r\n\r\nwe should try to encourage as much as possible is greater\r\n\r\nand  more  intensive family education, not merely  family\r\n\r\neducation  for  the  sake of family planning  but  family\r\n\r\neducation  to bring home to the people in a family  their\r\n\r\nresponsibility to each other - how they have  to  provide\r\n\r\nsupports  one for the other in a family. This is  a  very\r\n\r\ntraditional  local ethic and it has to be  encouraged  as\r\n\r\nmuch  as possible, with emphasis on the integrity of  the\r\n\r\nindividual  in  the family. Of course, with  this  family\r\n\r\neducation, one has to intensify understanding  of  family\r\n\r\nplanning  in  all  sorts  of ways  so  that,  as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible, people can avoid resorting to abortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, Mr Speaker, Sir, I crave your\r\n\r\nindulgence  to  let  me make an appeal  to  people,  like\r\n\r\nleaders  of  religious  faiths, to  intensify  their  own\r\n\r\nefforts  to bring home to their own adherents the  notion\r\n\r\nof the value of life and respect for the integrity of the\r\n\r\nindividual.  For  those  who are against  abortion,  they\r\n\r\nshould try as far as they can to bring home to their own\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  such  knowledge of family planning  practices  as\r\n\r\nthey  themselves  find approvable,  and  those  people  - religionists,  adherents of faiths who have international\r\n\r\naffiliations - should give all the support  they  can  to\r\n\r\nresearch  to provide, if possible (and I do not think  it\r\n\r\nis  impossible), the means of family planning which  they\r\n\r\nfind approvable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another point is that we should as far\r\n\r\nas  possible  encourage  those who,  in  my  own  way  of\r\n\r\nthinking,  regretfully want abortion. We should encourage\r\n\r\nthem to have their abortions as early as possible. I mean\r\n\r\nwhen  they  understand  that  a  child  is  coming,   the\r\n\r\nrealisation comes early. If a person indeed has  to  have\r\n\r\nan abortion, then it should be done as early as possible,\r\n\r\nand  this  is  tied  up with the question  of  additional\r\n\r\nknowledge  or  complete knowledge in  respect  of  family\r\n\r\nplanning.  I  hope  this is not taken  to  imply  that  I\r\n\r\nsupport abortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> But you are!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> No. But it is in the circumstances that\r\n\r\nwe  find  ourselves faced with, that I am just seeking  a\r\n\r\nway  out  that is possible. At the same time,  those  who\r\n\r\ncome  for  abortion should be given adequate counselling.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister referred to the Lane Report. But  the  Lane\r\n\r\nReport  also  referred  to  the  necessity  for  adequate\r\n\r\ncounselling  for those who come for abortion, counselling\r\n\r\nthat  will perhaps avoid abortions later on, by  which  I\r\n\r\nmean  a  return  for  further  abortions.  The  rate   of\r\n\r\nrecidivism in abortions, according to the Minister's  own\r\n\r\nfigures, seems to be quite high. I would urge that  these\r\n\r\npeople be given adequate counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which the Minister has not mentioned in\r\n\r\nrespect  of the Lane Report is that it has also  referred\r\n\r\nto  the  necessity that should a pregnancy be  terminated\r\n\r\nafter  24  weeks the abortion would be for  induction  of\r\n\r\nbirth.  We  should  also provide that particular  measure\r\n\r\nwhen people come for abortion. I think we should try  our\r\n\r\nbest,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  not  to touch the  tradition  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety  as  far as we can-the tradition  that  holds  on\r\n\r\nmoral, ethical or religious grounds, that abortion  is  a\r\n\r\nregrettable act and one that should be avoided as far  as\r\n\r\npossible.  Abortion,  therefore, should  not  be  a  mere\r\n\r\nsubstitute  for family planning. We should  encourage  as\r\n\r\nmuch  as possible those who do come for abortion to weigh\r\n\r\nall  the  considerations. There  has  been  apparently  a\r\n\r\nweighing of considerations, in view of the figures  given\r\n\r\nof  those  who were permitted abortions but who  did  not\r\n\r\neventually accept. We should encourage this consideration\r\n\r\nso  that  respect  for  life is something  that  we  hold\r\n\r\nvaluable in our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

This\r\n\r\nis found in Hansard, Vol. 28, col. 1043.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is what the Minister said. I did not say it, but the\r\n\r\nMinister said it, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We are not in favour of abortions on demand because,\r\n\r\nas  I have stated in my opening speech, this may lead  to\r\n\r\nrecurrent demands for abortion and we know, as a  medical\r\n\r\nfact, that repeated abortions result in a higher rate  of\r\n\r\nmortality and morbidity.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Further down the column, Sir, I quote again:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where is the abortion on demand? It is a fantasy that\r\n\r\nwas  flourished again and again by the opponents of  this\r\n\r\nBill.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  I crave your indulgence to give me a little bit  of\r\n\r\ntime to get my notes right. The Explanatory Statement  to\r\n\r\nthe Bill says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This Bill seeks to consolidate and amend the law\r\n\r\nrelating to abortion by further liberalising that law  in\r\n\r\ncertain major respects and to repeal the Abortion Act.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  the  last  paragraph  of the  Explanatory  Statement\r\n\r\naccompanying this Bill states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Finally, it should be mentioned that it is intended\r\n\r\nthat  the  legislation will no longer be of  a  temporary\r\n\r\nnature as is the existing Act. The Bill when passed will,\r\n\r\ntherefore, become a permanent feature of our laws.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, I cannot follow or understand the explanation of the\r\n\r\nMinister concerned when he said that this new Bill before\r\n\r\nthe  House would further liberalise abortion. Towards the\r\n\r\nend of his speech on the Second Reading of this Bill,  he\r\n\r\nsaid  that  he did not want to use the term \"abortion  on\r\n\r\ndemand\". The Minister can correct me if I am wrong. To my\r\n\r\nmind,  this Bill is in fact a way out for women  who  are\r\n\r\npregnant and who do not wish to have the child.  In  such\r\n\r\ncases  the  Bill says that abortion can be  allowed.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  tried  to whiz himself out  of  the  debate  by\r\n\r\ntrying to forestall any argument and saying that - and  I\r\n\r\nam  not  putting words into his mouth -all the criticisms\r\n\r\nof  the  opponents  of  the Bill  spring  from  religious\r\n\r\ndogmas, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not going to be concerned with this particular\r\n\r\naspect of the Bill, but I am going to talk on the ethical\r\n\r\naspect  of  this Bill. In one of the deliberations  about\r\n\r\nethical  considerations of the Abortion Bill, as recorded\r\n\r\nin Hansard,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVolume 28, col. 878, the Minister himself referred  to  -\r\n\r\nand I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Ethical, moral and social reasons form the second\r\n\r\ncategory. Based on religious premises, moral reasons  arc\r\n\r\nadvocated against abortions and these reasons are further\r\n\r\nextended to social issues.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>There  were  ethical  considerations.  But  that  was   a\r\n\r\ncriterion.  Here  he  has  quoted  the  Prime   Minister;\r\n\r\nHansard, Volume 29, col. 348:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As has been stated by the Prime Minister, one of the\r\n\r\nsocial  yardsticks by which we shall have  to  judge  the\r\n\r\nresults  of  the  new  abortion law,  together  with  the\r\n\r\ncompanion sterilization law, will be whether it tends  to\r\n\r\nraise or lower the total quality of our population.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  I myself do not follow how the Minister could  come\r\n\r\nto  that conclusion. If he wants a higher quality type of\r\n\r\npopulation in Singapore, then does he not realise that if\r\n\r\nhe  has a house - I am sure he has - he has got to employ\r\n\r\nservants or gardeners. Now what sort of quality of people\r\n\r\ndoes  he want? He has a car. But who drives the car? Does\r\n\r\nanybody  sit  by his side in the car? Is  the  amount  of\r\n\r\nremuneration  the  same? Why do they  have  a  Government\r\n\r\ncomprising the Cabinet? Why do they have Members  elected\r\n\r\nto  Parliament?  Why do we have the white collar  workers\r\n\r\nand  blue  collar workers? What sort of  quality  of  the\r\n\r\npopulace  do  you want to have? I do not understand  that\r\n\r\nyardstick, and neither do many of my Friends on this side\r\n\r\nof  the  House.  Therefore, the question is  whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  more concerned with human values  of  the\r\n\r\nsociety  as  a  whole or whether Government is  concerned\r\n\r\nwith  the  efficiency of population control. The Minister\r\n\r\nhas  vigorously  denied this, and he has  given  us  some\r\n\r\nfacts and figures. But from the facts and figures one can\r\n\r\nsee  that abortion is on the increase, whatever  the  age\r\n\r\ngroup.  As I have said, this Bill actually means abortion\r\n\r\non  demand.  If it is so, then I oppose it, because  even\r\n\r\nthough the Minister has vigorously tried to forestall the\r\n\r\ncriticisms,  the  opponents to the Bill would  say,  \"All\r\n\r\nright, if you have abortion on demand, then you are going\r\n\r\nto breed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npermissiveness.\" That is exactly so. Or can the  Minister\r\n\r\nascertain that this will not be so?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out to Members of this House that\r\n\r\nit  is  my  belief  that a permissive society  inevitably\r\n\r\nbreeds  permissiveness and promiscuity, a word which  the\r\n\r\nMinister   has   been  trying  hard  to  pronounce.   And\r\n\r\npromiscuity  further breeds diseases like gonorrhoea  and\r\n\r\nV.D.  Incidentally  he  is also  the  Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs.  There are laws with heavy penalties  and  fines\r\n\r\nfor  those  who indulge in drug-taking, drug peddling  or\r\n\r\ndrug  pushing. He can therefore be likened to a  pair  of\r\n\r\nSiamese  twins  trying to outbox each other.  We  have  a\r\n\r\nsituation   where  one  Ministry  fights   against   drug\r\n\r\ntrafficking,  permissiveness,  drug-taking  and   against\r\n\r\nincreases  in  the  incidence  of  V.D, and  gonorrhoea.\r\n\r\nCampaigns have been mounted. And the other Ministry says,\r\n\r\n\"Yes,  by all means, have abortions.\" Where is the logic?\r\n\r\nI  do not follow. I do not know whether the argument that\r\n\r\nI  put forward today will stand the test of time. If not,\r\n\r\nhe  will come out and say, \"it has not stood and will  be\r\n\r\nswept into the dustbins of history.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one looks up the 1969 debate on the Second Reading\r\n\r\nof  the  Abortion  Bill,  the Hon. Minister  consistently\r\n\r\nfought  back and declined a discussion of the  points  on\r\n\r\nwhat  he  called  \"religious  or  ethical  dogmas\".   Any\r\n\r\nfundamental   objection  to  the  Bill  was,   he   said,\r\n\r\nattributed  to concealed religious premises, even  though\r\n\r\nat  least  one  of the Backbenchers, my good  Friend  the\r\n\r\nMember for Bras Basah, had said when he opposed the  Bill\r\n\r\nin 1969 that he was a freethinker. I think he is still  a\r\n\r\nfreethinker,  and he has just opposed this present  Bill.\r\n\r\nIf   anyone  wants  to  challenge  the  validity  of   my\r\n\r\nstatement, Sir, I have got all the proof here. Sir, it is\r\n\r\nnot  yet  five  years since the last debate in  December,\r\n\r\n1969.  My  good Friend is sitting down and is enjoying  a\r\n\r\nrest. Now, Sir, if any of the speakers on the Backbenches\r\n\r\nwho  had  opposed the Bill had based their  arguments  on\r\n\r\nreligious beliefs - for myself I have made it very  clear\r\n\r\nand it is all in the Hansard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-  many  of  them did certainly base their objections  on\r\n\r\nethical  considerations. I would expect the Hon. Minister\r\n\r\nto  consider their opposing views rather than jumping the\r\n\r\ngun  by forestalling their criticisms and saying that the\r\n\r\nopponents  of  this  Bill  would  again  come  out   with\r\n\r\nreligious  beliefs,  religious dogmas  and,  may  I  say,\r\n\r\n\"ethics\", etc. - good, the Parliamentary Secretary to the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Education is here. In the schools today  we\r\n\r\nteach  ethics, we teach them what is right  and  what  is\r\n\r\nwrong.  In this august Chamber if a Member stands up  and\r\n\r\nargues  on the basis of ethics or ethical considerations,\r\n\r\nhe  would be shot down even before he is allowed to stand\r\n\r\nup  to  speak. Is this argument not considered as ethics?\r\n\r\nWhat sort of educational system do we want to evolve?  If\r\n\r\nin   the   schools  we  teach  ethics  and,  for  ethical\r\n\r\nconsideration  in  this  august  Chamber,  what  is   the\r\n\r\napplication?  By  the same measure. Therefore,  this  has\r\n\r\ngiven  rise to a very curious situation, and as a  result\r\n\r\npeople sometimes ask me what we mean when we say \"we  are\r\n\r\na pragmatic Government\". They seem to think it means that\r\n\r\nwe have no principles. In view of the refusal on the part\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister concerned even to discuss  the  ethical\r\n\r\nconsiderations of this Bill, can he blame the people  for\r\n\r\nthinking in this way?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Minister quoted you, Sir, when you were a\r\n\r\nBackbencher. With due respect to you, Sir,  he  tried  to\r\n\r\nhand  you a bouquet. But on the other hand, you told  him\r\n\r\nthen  in no uncertain terms - if the impression I  gather\r\n\r\nfrom  the Hansard is correct - you would rather  call  it\r\n\r\nthe  Abortion (Restrictive) Act. In other words, why  not\r\n\r\ncall  it \"white\" and \"white\" only, rather than call it  a\r\n\r\nshade  of grey or black. Come out with it! Sir, you  told\r\n\r\nhim  that  a few years ago, and today he says, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nwhen you were the Member for Joo Chiat you supported  the\r\n\r\nBill. In fact, I do not think you supported the Bill. You\r\n\r\nwere  quite  frank  when you said,  \"Look,  if  you  want\r\n\r\nabortion,  go ahead.\" Therefore, Sir, it would seem  that\r\n\r\nwhenever  a  question of ethics is raised,  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwould  be  like an ostrich, burying his head in the  sand\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrefusing even to look up to the argument. Sir, I am  told\r\n\r\nthat  even the most obstinate or determined ostrich  must\r\n\r\ncome  up  for  air.  So  we  may  still  hope  that   the\r\n\r\nimplications  of  this Bill will be examined  rationally,\r\n\r\nimpartially and without emotion. After all, if we were to\r\n\r\nthink that the Minister is a man without any concern  for\r\n\r\nethical  principles,  we would surely  be  doing  him  an\r\n\r\ninjustice. He does not, for example, propose to introduce\r\n\r\na  Bill allowing infanticide at the request of the parent\r\n\r\nin  order to reduce the size of her family. This might be\r\n\r\na  quick  and efficient way of reducing the size  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation,  but he probably thinks that this  manner  of\r\n\r\nbehaviour would be unethical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, if I may be permitted to quote from Hansard,\r\n\r\nVol. 28, col. 1040:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A Bill of this nature, [that is, the present Act and\r\n\r\nnot  this particular Bill before the House] . , is not  a\r\n\r\nlicence  for a permissive society. I have already  stated\r\n\r\nin  my  opening speech that if the object  is  merely  to\r\n\r\nremove  the present restraints on abortion in  the  Penal\r\n\r\nCode,  this  Bill  in  its  present  form  will  not   be\r\n\r\nnecessary. And yet the opponents have not taken  note  of\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to what the Member for Punggol has claimed,\r\n\r\nand  I  believe that the Member for Bras Basah  has  also\r\n\r\nclaimed  that Singapore, with the passing of the Abortion\r\n\r\nBill, would become an abortion centre.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And again, he says in col. 1040:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No community anywhere in the present world,\r\n\r\nirrespective of its political character, has ever thought\r\n\r\nof  permitting  the killing of human  beings,  as  it  is\r\n\r\ngenerally   understood,  be  they  sick,   old,   infirm,\r\n\r\nparalysed or totally decrepit.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister presumably thought that this would be\r\n\r\nan  unethical  way of acting. I have mentioned  just  now\r\n\r\nthat,   as  Minister  for  Home  Affairs,  he  is  making\r\n\r\nstrenuous  efforts to stop drug-taking. Does he  consider\r\n\r\nthis an unethical practice? Unless the Minister wishes to\r\n\r\nbe  the complete ostrich, therefore, I think he will have\r\n\r\nto  consider  whether or not there is anything  unethical\r\n\r\nabout   abortion.  It  is  not  a  religious   dogma   or\r\n\r\npresumption of ethics. I opposed the former Bill  because\r\n\r\nI was concerned about human values and that the then Bill\r\n\r\nwould  not  be good for our country. I believe  that  the\r\n\r\npresent Bill will be worse, and for the same reason\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  am  opposing  it.  I  do not intend  to  go  into  the\r\n\r\nphilosophical aspect which the Minister dislikes so much.\r\n\r\nSo  let me put the matter in its simplest form to Members\r\n\r\nin this august Chamber. This Bill, if passed, and it will\r\n\r\nbe  passed because you, Sir, had mentioned in your speech\r\n\r\nthat the Bill would finally be passed. That was true then\r\n\r\nand  it  is  still  true  today. [Laughter]  This  is  no\r\n\r\nlaughing  matter.  Do  not be too happy.  Any  woman  who\r\n\r\nwishes  to  get  rid of something inside  her,  something\r\n\r\nwhich  is  already  a living thing and  which,  with  due\r\n\r\nrespect  to you, Sir, if allowed to remain there  and  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  would eventually emerge as a recognisable  human\r\n\r\nbeing, just like any one of us. Is it not so? Can any one\r\n\r\nstand  up  and say that that thing has got no life?  Note\r\n\r\nthat  I  use  the  phrase \"allowed  to  remain  there  to\r\n\r\ndevelop\".  Sir, as I said just now, with due  respect  to\r\n\r\nyou  and  to  my colleagues who are doctors  and  medical\r\n\r\npractitioners, when it comes to near full term  there  is\r\n\r\nthe  heart-beat of the child. Is that not  a  process  in\r\n\r\nwhich  a human being is subsequently born? Sir, I do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to go into the rigmarole of philosophy, as  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid. But is there no consideration given to the question\r\n\r\nof  human  values? I would strongly urge the Minister,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  his difficulty in the twin role  as  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Health and Home Affairs, to reconsider in a rational,\r\n\r\nimpartial  way  and  without any emotion  whatsoever  the\r\n\r\ncomments made by the many speakers just now. And  let  it\r\n\r\nnot  be said that there was no contradiction to the views\r\n\r\nexposed.  What  I would like to say for the  purposes  of\r\n\r\nrecord  is this. I oppose the Bill in toto, Sir,  as  you\r\n\r\nhad  mentioned in the last part of your speech that \"this\r\n\r\nBill  will be accepted in tow.\" If it is passed in  toto,\r\n\r\nthen on the same principle and for the same reason, I  so\r\n\r\noppose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the\r\n\r\nnew  Abortion Bill is a matter for grave concern, because\r\n\r\nit  will  lead  to more serious social problems.  In  the\r\n\r\npast,  people regarded abortion as a very serious  matter\r\n\r\nand to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  considered only as a last resort. The introduction of\r\n\r\nthe  present Abortion Bill will pave the way for more and\r\n\r\nmore abortions, with the result that people will take  to\r\n\r\nabortion   easily.  Consequently,  there   will   be   an\r\n\r\nundesirable social atmosphere and degradation  of  social\r\n\r\nmorals.  By  that time unmarried women will not  consider\r\n\r\nabortion as a cause for shame. Unmarried women will  take\r\n\r\nto  abortion  as a very common matter and there  will  be\r\n\r\npromiscuity  in  our society. If we come to  that  stage,\r\n\r\nyoung  girls  will not take pregnancy very seriously.  As\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  has already pointed out,  the  concept  of\r\n\r\nabortion  in  the  minds of the people  has  become  more\r\n\r\nenlightened.  Perhaps  parents  will  then   tell   their\r\n\r\nchildren,  \"Do  not worry, go and get an abortion.\"  What\r\n\r\nwould  become of our society then? What would  become  of\r\n\r\nhuman  dignity then? Since it is our desire  to  build  a\r\n\r\nhealthy  society of traditional values, we must  maintain\r\n\r\nthis  dignity  in  our  legislation  by  setting  a  high\r\n\r\nstandard of social morals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a small country that is not able to accommodate\r\n\r\nany increases in population. But to control population we\r\n\r\ncan  have  proper  family planning  programmes  and  thus\r\n\r\npromote  our national economy. I am sure all hon. Members\r\n\r\nin this House will support me on this point. On the other\r\n\r\nhand,  Sir,  we  should not liberalise  abortion  law  in\r\n\r\nSingapore because it is harmful to our society. When  the\r\n\r\nfirst  Abortion  Bill was introduced five  years  ago  to\r\n\r\naccommodate those people who wanted abortions because  of\r\n\r\nfinancial or health reasons, that was understandable. The\r\n\r\nMinister  has  pointed out that the old  legislation  was\r\n\r\neffective. If so, it is therefore not necessary to  bring\r\n\r\nin  this  new  Abortion  Bill  to  this  House.  I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore like to express my opposition to the new Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, several Members\r\n\r\nhave raised certain points which, I think, need reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the Member for Anson who, unfortunately,\r\n\r\nis  not  here.  He  said something  to  the  effect  that\r\n\r\nabortion means killing the foetus and that amounts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  killing a human life. That point has been repeated by\r\n\r\nsome  other Members who spoke against the Bill, e.g, the\r\n\r\nMember  for Punggol. In fact, that was his only  point  - that  abortion means killing the foetus, a human life.  I\r\n\r\nhave  stated quite clearly in my opening speech that  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  whether or not a foetus under 24  weeks  is\r\n\r\nhuman  life  is  a  matter which  has  been  debated  for\r\n\r\ncenturies  by  learned  people,  both  medical  and  non-medical.  They  could not come to any  conclusion  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether  a foetus is human life, and therefore to  equate\r\n\r\nabortion,  i.e, the evacuation of the  foetus  from  the\r\n\r\nwomb,  to  killing, murder, or infanticide  is  something\r\n\r\nwhich  cannot  be accepted. Perhaps they have  their  own\r\n\r\nbeliefs  that it is human life. But there are others  who\r\n\r\ndo not think so. Therefore, as I have said, if we were to\r\n\r\ncontinue to argue this point till the cows come home,  we\r\n\r\nwill come back to where we started. But from the view  of\r\n\r\nthose  who are in favour of legalised abortion, they  are\r\n\r\nquite  categorical about it. They do not consider that  a\r\n\r\nfoetus under 24 weeks of pregnancy is human life, for the\r\n\r\nsimple  reason  that if a foetus comes out  of  the  womb\r\n\r\nunder  24  weeks, it will not be able to survive  outside\r\n\r\nthe mother's womb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson made comments that some doctors\r\n\r\nare  not happy to perform abortions. I have stated  quite\r\n\r\ncategorically   here  that  there  is   a   conscientious\r\n\r\nobjection  clause where nobody is forced or compelled  to\r\n\r\nperform  an  abortion  if he or she has  a  conscientious\r\n\r\nobjection. Therefore, to say that doctors are unhappy  or\r\n\r\nare compelled to perform an abortion is nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Ho Swee stated that abortion\r\n\r\nshould be only a last resort and that we should encourage\r\n\r\nfamily  planning. This is exactly what I have stated.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  over  the  last  five years  family  planning  has\r\n\r\nadvanced to such an extent that nearly 90 per cent of our\r\n\r\neligible   population  have  accepted  family   planning.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  legalised abortion which we  are  introducing\r\n\r\ntoday is a complement to family planning. It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  not  a substitute to family planning and it will  not\r\n\r\nreplace family planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the charges for abortion and the point that\r\n\r\ndoctors  should not be allowed to exploit their patients,\r\n\r\nas  far as the Government hospitals are concerned, it  is\r\n\r\ncontained  in  the  new Bill that a fee  of  $5  will  be\r\n\r\ncharged  and  no more. However, if private  practitioners\r\n\r\nwant  to  charge  more, we cannot control  them.  So  the\r\n\r\npregnant  woman has the choice of paying only $5  for  an\r\n\r\nabortion in Government hospitals or paying more outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Bras Basah, he said that I\r\n\r\nimplied  in my speech that there was no risk in abortion.\r\n\r\nThat was not what I stated. I said that we recognise  the\r\n\r\nrisk  not only now but also five years ago, and  that  is\r\n\r\nthe  reason why we have certain safeguards - that it must\r\n\r\nbe  done under absolutely safe conditions. That is why we\r\n\r\nsaid  that  if abortions are done outside the  hospitals,\r\n\r\nthey   must   be  done  by  competent  doctors   and   in\r\n\r\ninstitutions which are approved by the Ministry of Health\r\n\r\nas  being capable of doing safe abortions. It is  because\r\n\r\nwe were very thoughtful about the need for safe abortions\r\n\r\nthat I am glad to say after 4\u00bd years of operation of  the\r\n\r\nAct  that  there  was not one single mortality,  nor  was\r\n\r\nthere any disablement resulting from legalised abortions.\r\n\r\nAs  opposed  to this, an illegal abortion, as  you  know,\r\n\r\noften turns septic and the woman dies. So it is not  true\r\n\r\nto  say  that we do not recognise the risk. It is because\r\n\r\nwe  were able to maintain a good record of no incident of\r\n\r\nmortality  and  morbidity in cases of legalised  abortion\r\n\r\nthat  we  are preserving the same safeguards in this  new\r\n\r\nBill. That is to say, if abortions are to be done outside\r\n\r\nthe  Government hospitals, they must be done in  approved\r\n\r\ninstitutions  and  by  doctors who  have  the  skill  and\r\n\r\nexperience in abortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the Member for Potong Pasir. There\r\n\r\nagain, the Member for Potong Pasir mentioned about murder\r\n\r\nand  infanticide. As I have already said, it is a  matter\r\n\r\nof  belief  -whether you believe that a foetus  under  24\r\n\r\nweeks is human or not. If you do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbelieve that it is human, then of course there is no case\r\n\r\nof infanticide when an abortion is done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About promiscuity and permissiveness, and so on, I have\r\n\r\nstated that after 4\u00bd years of operation of the Act, there\r\n\r\nhas   not  been  any  lowering  of  moral  standards   or\r\n\r\npermissiveness as a result of legalising abortion.  There\r\n\r\nmay  be  other  causes,  but  certainly  not  because  of\r\n\r\nabortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is about repeat abortions. I have\r\n\r\nstated  quite  categorically that repeat  abortions  have\r\n\r\nremained  as low as 6.5 per cent, as compared with  other\r\n\r\ncountries like Japan, Sweden, and the UK where it is much\r\n\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is about education to reduce population\r\n\r\ngrowth.  I  think I must answer that. It is  quite  clear\r\n\r\nthat  family planning efforts will continue, and  I  have\r\n\r\nstated  in  my  opening speech that we are only  offering\r\n\r\nabortion  as a last resort and as an important complement\r\n\r\nto a comprehensive family planning programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Member for Katong is concerned, he has\r\n\r\nmade certain remarks which, I think, are very diplomatic.\r\n\r\nOn  the whole, I do not disagree with his sentiments.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  some of the things he has stated are not  contrary\r\n\r\nto what I have stated in my opening speech. He has stated\r\n\r\nthat it is a vexed question. Yes, of course it is a vexed\r\n\r\nquestion.  He  has  stated that there must  be  effective\r\n\r\nGovernment propaganda and so on and so forth to propagate\r\n\r\nthese matters. Of course, if the Government thinks it  is\r\n\r\ngood,  it will propagate it; whether it is accident-free,\r\n\r\nfamily planning or crime-free campaign, it will be  done.\r\n\r\nBut,  of  course, it does not mean that those who  oppose\r\n\r\nabortion cannot themselves conduct their own campaign  to\r\n\r\npersuade people not to have abortions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point he said was something about adequate\r\n\r\ncounselling for those who are forced to have abortions. I\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned  in  my opening speech  that  the  Family\r\n\r\nPlanning and Population Board has made it a point to give\r\n\r\nadequate counselling to those who go for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabortions. In fact, I have quoted figures and  perhaps  I\r\n\r\nmay  repeat  that there has been adequate counselling  or\r\n\r\nwhat  they  call  post-abortal counselling.  May  I  just\r\n\r\nrepeat:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Further, there is evidence to suggest that overall\r\n\r\ncontraceptive  practice improved since the liberalisation\r\n\r\nof   abortions,  due  to  post-abortal  family   planning\r\n\r\ncounselling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To quote figures in support. In 1972 there were 788\r\n\r\npost-abortal sterilizations. This works out to  about  14\r\n\r\nper  cent of the total number of sterilizations in  1972.\r\n\r\nIn 1973 the number of post-abortal sterilizations rose to\r\n\r\n2,056  which works out to 23 per cent of the total number\r\n\r\nof  sterilizations in that year. In 1972 there  were  428\r\n\r\nnew   family   planning  acceptors  through  post-abortal\r\n\r\nmotivation. This works out to about 2.4 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal number of new acceptors in 1972. In 1973 the number\r\n\r\nof  new acceptors through post-abortal motivation rose to\r\n\r\n483  which works out to 2.5 per cent of the total  number\r\n\r\nof new acceptors in that year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore clear that contraceptive practice is\r\n\r\nthe accepted and preferred mode of limiting the number of\r\n\r\nchildren in families.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is quite clear that abortion is, so far, a last\r\n\r\nresort. After abortion there is post-abortal counselling,\r\n\r\nso  that  the people will accept family planning methods,\r\n\r\nwhether  it be the pill or sterilization. So  it  is  not\r\n\r\ntrue that we do not do anything about counselling a woman\r\n\r\nwho goes for abortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what I would like to say is this. The views of\r\n\r\nthose who oppose abortions, whether they be on ethical or\r\n\r\nreligious grounds, are respected. I have made that  quite\r\n\r\nclear five years ago and again today. But they should not\r\n\r\nimpose  upon  others  who do not  have  such  ethical  or\r\n\r\nreligious  beliefs. If a woman's conscience and religious\r\n\r\nbelief permit her to have an abortion, why should we deny\r\n\r\nher  an abortion? Who are we to deny? On the other  hand,\r\n\r\nif  her conscience and religious belief do not allow  her\r\n\r\nto have an abortion, nobody is forcing that woman to have\r\n\r\nan abortion. It was quite clearly stated in the Bill five\r\n\r\nyears  ago, and it is repeated in the present Bill,  that\r\n\r\nno  one  can on penalty or punishment coerce a  woman  to\r\n\r\nhave an abortion against her will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Punggol, unfortunately he is\r\n\r\nnot  here. With his rather rambling dissertation, I  have\r\n\r\ntried\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmy  best to comprehend him, but I am afraid I could  only\r\n\r\ncomprehend a little of what he has been saying. First  of\r\n\r\nall,  he  took objection to my reference to the  opposing\r\n\r\nstand that found itself in the dustbins of history. I was\r\n\r\njust quoting what I said five years ago. That was all.  I\r\n\r\nnever  said  that opponents of that Bill should  be  cast\r\n\r\ninto  the  dustbins  of history. I do respect  the  views\r\n\r\nopposing  the Bill, whether they be on religious  grounds\r\n\r\nor on ethical grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned about someone being an ostrich. I do\r\n\r\nnot  know  who is the ostrich, he or I. But the point  is\r\n\r\nthis. He keeps on quoting what I said five years ago.  It\r\n\r\nis very nice to hear what you have stated five years ago.\r\n\r\nBut by doing so he has forgotten that we are now debating\r\n\r\na new Bill and not the existing Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said something about forestalling arguments and\r\n\r\nso  on.  If  his  arguments had been  forestalled  by  my\r\n\r\nopening  speech,  I  am  afraid  I  cannot  help  it.  He\r\n\r\nmentioned something about \"abortion on demand\".  Yes,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  five  years  ago, the Bill then  did  not  allow\r\n\r\nabortion on demand. I had explained quite clearly  in  my\r\n\r\nopening  speech  that  we  then  had  no  experience   in\r\n\r\nabortions. We had to make certain assumptions. We had  to\r\n\r\nlearn  from  the experience of other countries.  We  were\r\n\r\ncautious  because,  as  I  said,  there  might  be  valid\r\n\r\narguments  then  and,  therefore, we  did  not  agree  to\r\n\r\nabortion  on  demand  then. But now  it  is  a  different\r\n\r\nmatter. Times have changed and we have gathered 4\u00bd  years\r\n\r\nof experience. We have all the facts and figures to prove\r\n\r\nour point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also brought up another point about raising and\r\n\r\nlowering the total quality of our population. He does not\r\n\r\nseem to understand the meaning of those terms. May I just\r\n\r\nexplain? If we have unwanted children around, they  will,\r\n\r\nas  the  Member  for Bukit Ho Swee said, degenerate  into\r\n\r\ndelinquents,  drug addicts, and so on. Therefore,  do  we\r\n\r\nincrease  the total quality of our population  by  having\r\n\r\nunwanted children around?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Member for Sembawang. On the matter\r\n\r\nof  promiscuity, permissiveness and so on,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nproof   that   abortions  have  caused  promiscuity   and\r\n\r\npermissiveness.  In fact, all the predictions  that  were\r\n\r\nmade five years ago did turn out to be correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Member for Sembawang talked about the\r\n\r\ndegradation of social morals, human dignity, and  so  on.\r\n\r\nDo we raise the quality of human dignity if we have a lot\r\n\r\nof unwanted children around?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Member rising on a point of clarification?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Sir, a few points of clarification and a few very small statements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I might be simplistic in\r\n\r\nmy  thinking but I do not see any reason why debates  arc\r\n\r\nnecessary  among experts to finally come to a  conclusion\r\n\r\nwhether  a foetus is a living thing or not. To  my  mind,\r\n\r\nsomething  living  requires  sustenance  and  grows.  The\r\n\r\nfoetus  requires sustenance from its mother and it grows,\r\n\r\nbecause  by the ninth month it is born a bonny  baby.  In\r\n\r\naddition  to that, if it is taken out whether  before  or\r\n\r\nafter  24  weeks it cannot grow unless it is  within  its\r\n\r\nmother.  Is the Minister suggesting that if it  is  taken\r\n\r\nout  after  24 weeks it can grow into a baby outside  the\r\n\r\nmother's womb?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> The answer is no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> The Minister also quoted lots of percentage\r\n\r\nfigures. In my case I quoted actual figures which I  have\r\n\r\nobtained. In actual fact, the Minister has no proof  that\r\n\r\nlegalised  abortion  has  not  led  to  an  increase   in\r\n\r\npromiscuity.

When I spoke just now, perhaps\r\n\r\nthe Minister was not fast enough to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrasp  my  point.  He  seemed to have  misunderstood  the\r\n\r\nessence of my speech, or perhaps he intentionally twisted\r\n\r\nwhat I said or distorted what I said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I said was that the introduction\r\n\r\nof the new Bill would create an undesirable atmosphere in\r\n\r\nour society and would lower the standard of morals of our\r\n\r\nsociety.  The  people will take promiscuity lightly,  and\r\n\r\nconsequently  our  social  and moral  standards  will  be\r\n\r\ngradually  lowered. The Minister also referred to  higher\r\n\r\nfigures of abortions in the European countries. It  would\r\n\r\nappear  that in his view it does not matter what  happens\r\n\r\nto  Singapore. I do not know whether it is his  intention\r\n\r\nto make Singapore a second Denmark or a second Sweden. If\r\n\r\nthat is the case, then it will be too bad for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know\r\n\r\nwhether  I  was  not fast enough to grasp  his  point  or\r\n\r\nwhether he was not fast enough to grasp my point. But the\r\n\r\npoint  is  this. I have never said that we want Singapore\r\n\r\nto  be  a second Sweden or a second Denmark. I have never\r\n\r\nsaid  that.  I said that our figure of abortions  carried\r\n\r\nout  on unmarried mothers is low compared with the  other\r\n\r\ncountries. But I am not saying that we must bring it  up.\r\n\r\nThat  is what the Member for Sembawang wants to interpret\r\n\r\nit,  and he talked about twisting. I do not know  who  is\r\n\r\ntwisting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that the Member for Sembawang was\r\n\r\npositive when he said that this new Bill would lower  the\r\n\r\nmoral  standards and all the pontifications and so on.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not know how the Member for Sembawang could make that\r\n\r\nstatement.   Has  he  got  any  facts  and   figures   to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate  it?  I  have said  earlier  that  the  same\r\n\r\narguments were put forward five years ago when the  first\r\n\r\nAbortion  Bill  was  being  debated  in  this  Chamber  - arguments that abortion would cause moral decline and  so\r\n\r\non and so forth. But five years after, i.e, today, has it\r\n\r\nresulted in any moral decline?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir has brought up the argument\r\n\r\nwhether the foetus is a human life or not. He is entitled\r\n\r\nto  his  belief.  As I have said, learned  men  have  for\r\n\r\ncenturies  debated  this point. We  know  that  it  is  a\r\n\r\nbiological fact that the foetus remains to be  born,  but\r\n\r\nunder  24  weeks is it human or is it not human?  Learned\r\n\r\nmen  are  still  debating it. Of course, the  Member  for\r\n\r\nPotong  Pasir is entitled to his view, and so  are  other\r\n\r\npeople who may not agree with him. I accept abortion as a\r\n\r\nfact  of life, otherwise we cannot go on from there.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Potong Pasir can keep on arguing  until  the\r\n\r\ncows  come home. This is where the matter lies. The  only\r\n\r\nthing we can do is to agree to disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point of the Member for Potong Pasir is the\r\n\r\nfigures. I think I have answered it partly when answering\r\n\r\nthe  points raised by the Member for Sembawang. I presume\r\n\r\nthe Member for Potong Pasir referred to the figures which\r\n\r\nI  have distributed. Was he referring to increased repeat\r\n\r\nabortions or was it abortions on unmarried mothers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> As far as unmarried mothers are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  it is good to know that unmarried mothers  go\r\n\r\nto  the  Government hospitals for their abortions  rather\r\n\r\nthan  go surreptitiously to the illegal abortionists  and\r\n\r\nrisk  septicity. But that only proves the point. It  does\r\n\r\nnot  prove that there has been an increase in promiscuity\r\n\r\nor  permissiveness or a decline in morals. As Members may\r\n\r\nknow,  most  of  the  cases of septic  abortions  involve\r\n\r\nunmarried mothers. Let us face the facts of life. Let  us\r\n\r\nnot,  quoting the Member for Punggol, be an  ostrich.  As\r\n\r\nfar  as  repeat abortions are concerned, they could  have\r\n\r\ngone to an illegal abortionist. On the record there is  a\r\n\r\nlow  rate  of  repeat abortions. But as I said,  even  if\r\n\r\nrepeat  abortions go up a little bit more,  it  does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that  there  has been an increase  in  promiscuity,\r\n\r\npermissiveness and so on and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Member for Potong Pasir said about\r\n\r\neducation on sexual abstinence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand so on, or some study of that nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> It speaks for itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Whatever his proposal is, it speaks for itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Chua Sian Chin].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>VOLUNTARY STERILIZATION BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to the Abortion Act, the passage of the\r\n\r\nVoluntary  Sterilization Act through Parliament  in  1969\r\n\r\nwas  a  smooth  one. It came into effect on  20th  March,\r\n\r\n1970. The Act is now in its fifth year of operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Abortion Act it was given a limited lease of\r\n\r\nlife, for the same reasons that the House should have  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to review the operation of the  Act  and  to\r\n\r\ndetermine how it has served its objectives and its impact\r\n\r\non our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the Abortion Act, however, it was soon evident\r\n\r\nthat the safeguards written in to protect persons from  a\r\n\r\nhasty  decision to be sterilized which they might  regret\r\n\r\nlater,  were  found  to be excessive. These  checks  were\r\n\r\nfound to operate against the objectives of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, Parliament approved amendments lifting\r\n\r\nsome  of  the more restrictive provisions in the  Act  on\r\n\r\n23rd  March,  1972.  These amendments were  brought  into\r\n\r\neffect  on  12th May, 1972.

The immediate result  was  a\r\n\r\nnoticeable increase in the flow of persons who  came  for\r\n\r\nsterilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statistics given in the form of tables are in the\r\n\r\nAddendum* (*Appendix II, cols, 1155-8) to my speech\r\n\r\nwhich I have distributed  earlier. It  is  evident from \r\n\r\nthe yearly figures that they clearly\r\n\r\nfall  into  two  parts. The early part  is  comprised  of\r\n\r\nfigures before the amendments were brought into effect on\r\n\r\n12th  May, 1972. The second phase is after the amendments\r\n\r\nAct had come into effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of sterilizations has increased\r\n\r\ntremendously,  particularly  in  the  last   two   years.\r\n\r\nHowever, male sterilization is still relatively unpopular\r\n\r\ncompared with female sterilizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 4,787 applications for sterilization on\r\n\r\nwomen  were  approved of which only about  three-quarters\r\n\r\nwere carried out. It would be noted that in the first  or\r\n\r\nrestrictive phase the numbers approved and performed were\r\n\r\nless  than 70 per cent of total applications. After  some\r\n\r\nof  the restrictions had been removed by amendments,  the\r\n\r\nnumbers  approved and performed went up to about  75  per\r\n\r\ncent.  The fact that there are still sizable numbers  who\r\n\r\nhave  been approved for sterilization but do not  undergo\r\n\r\nthe  operation  probably  reflects  the  effects  of  the\r\n\r\nresidual restrictions imposed by the existing law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures on the number of sterilizations undertaken for\r\n\r\ntherapeutic reasons are also given. It is interesting  to\r\n\r\nnote  that  the  proportion of female  sterilization  on\r\n\r\ntherapeutic indications increased from 66.8 per  cent  of\r\n\r\ntotal  female sterilization in 1970 but jumped  to  90.1\r\n\r\nper  cent  in  1973. This indicates that  women  will  be\r\n\r\nprepared to be sterilized if it is more easily obtainable\r\n\r\nsuch as on therapeutic grounds, rather than having to  go\r\n\r\nthrough the Eugenics Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The age of sterilizations for those sterilized on socio-economic grounds has been decreasing since 1970.

The\r\n\r\nhazards of pregnancies increase as birth order increases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only 22 per cent of females sterilized on socio-economic applications had two or less children in 1970.\r\n\r\nBut  the figure increased to 35 per cent in 1971, 48  per\r\n\r\ncent  in  1972 and 81 per cent in 1973. The  increase  in\r\n\r\n1972 and particularly in 1973 reflected the effect of the\r\n\r\namendment to the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total nearly 11 per cent of all women aged 15 to 44\r\n\r\nyears  have  been voluntarily sterilized. The demographic\r\n\r\nimpact  of  sterilization on such a large  proportion  of\r\n\r\nwomen  in the fertile ages is of particular significance.\r\n\r\nIt would of course be difficult to assess what would have\r\n\r\nbeen  the  re-productive behaviour  of  these  sterilized\r\n\r\ngroup of persons if they had not been sterilized. Such an\r\n\r\nexercise    is   often   conjectural   and   speculative.\r\n\r\nNevertheless  there are mathematical  methods,  no  doubt\r\n\r\npresumptive,  which  can be applied in  such  cases.

It rids  the\r\n\r\nparents once and for all, the inconvenience of having  to\r\n\r\nuse contraceptives, and freeing them permanently from the\r\n\r\ntyranny of unwanted pregnancies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have come some way along the path on family planning\r\n\r\nand  the  control  of  population.  We  have  passed  two\r\n\r\nimportant milestones. The first was when we adopted, as a\r\n\r\nnational programme, measures for family planning when the\r\n\r\nAct  on Family Planning was passed by Parliament in 1965.\r\n\r\nThe  next  milestone was when the laws on  abortions  and\r\n\r\nvoluntary sterilization were liberalised in 1970. At  the\r\n\r\ntime  when we passed these historic pieces of legislation\r\n\r\nthere  was  expressed concern whether  we  were  not  too\r\n\r\nadvanced  of  our  times. Sometimes as  a  Government  we\r\n\r\nshould  be  in advance of the times. If we  think  it  is\r\n\r\nright  and  have  thought  through  these  problems   and\r\n\r\ncarefully weighed the pros and cons, we should  give  the\r\n\r\nlead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As events turned out we need not have been too\r\n\r\nconcerned. We were not too far ahead of our people.  They\r\n\r\nhave  accepted  family planning and  taken  to  voluntary\r\n\r\nsterilizations  in a way quite beyond our  fondest  hopes\r\n\r\nand  expectations.  We  had offered  the  full  range  of\r\n\r\nmethods  of  contraception, from the  reversible  to  the\r\n\r\nirreversible  which  is  sterilization.  We   knew   that\r\n\r\nsterilization would be the preferable procedure where the\r\n\r\nperson had completed her family. A person was freed  from\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninconvenience  of adopting the inconvenient  measures  of\r\n\r\ncontraception. Sterilization was the method advocated  by\r\n\r\nthe  family  planners  and by doctors  as  the  best  and\r\n\r\npreferred measure in such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it turned out these advantages spoke for themselves\r\n\r\nand  a  large segment of our married women have now  been\r\n\r\nvoluntarily sterilised. In fact, a sample survey  of  our\r\n\r\nmarried  women has shown that more than 42  per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthem  know  about sterilization and will accept  it  when\r\n\r\nthey  have completed their families. This being the case,\r\n\r\nwe  have a duty to make this form of contraception freely\r\n\r\navailable to those who have given sober thought  to  this\r\n\r\nas  a means of family planning and who have considered it\r\n\r\nas the method which they will adopt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, from our experience we know that many of them\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  prepared to do so if there are  too  many\r\n\r\nrestrictions on their applications. We know for  instance\r\n\r\nthat the need to apply to a Board or panel of persons  is\r\n\r\nrepugnant  as  it interposes a third party  in  a  matter\r\n\r\nwhich  is  essentially  of a very  private  and  personal\r\n\r\nnature.  The  delays which have been  imposed,  that  is,\r\n\r\nseven  days under the existing Act together with all  the\r\n\r\nwaiting  time  in  processing  the  applications   before\r\n\r\nsterilizations  can  be done, are  also  unacceptable  to\r\n\r\nmany.  In  fact, a sizable number, approximately  25  per\r\n\r\ncent, did not undergo sterilizations after the Board  had\r\n\r\napproved them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sterilization under the Bill, as is proposed in the\r\n\r\ncase  of  abortions, will be entirely  a  private  matter\r\n\r\nbetween  the  person applying for it and  the  registered\r\n\r\nmedical  practitioner. It will be undertaken entirely  on\r\n\r\nthe  volition  of the person wanting it. A valid  consent\r\n\r\nwill  be  given by the person if he is an adult. It  will\r\n\r\nnot  require  the  further consent of the  spouse  as  is\r\n\r\nprovided in the existing law. Consent is only required in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  the  person  who  is  below  the  age   of\r\n\r\ndiscretion, that is, under 21 years of age and if  he  or\r\n\r\nshe is unmarried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, the procedures are accordingly\r\n\r\nsimplified  considerably by removing all the  unnecessary\r\n\r\nstrictures. These are: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Abolition of the Eugenics Board which, in the\r\n\r\nexisting    law,   authorises   all   applications    for\r\n\r\nsterilizations. Decision for sterilization  will  now  be\r\n\r\nmade  between  the  patient and  the  registered  medical\r\n\r\npractitioner;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Removing the restrictions requiring the persons to\r\n\r\nhave  at least two children before sterilization  can  be\r\n\r\ndone; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Not requiring consent of the spouse for\r\n\r\nsterilization. However, consent of a parent  or  guardian\r\n\r\nwill  be required by those persons who are unmarried  and\r\n\r\nare under 21 years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill-[Mr Chua Sian Chin].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>POLICE FORCE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two authorities which exercise disciplinary\r\n\r\ncontrol over Police Officers. They are the Public Service\r\n\r\nCommission and the Commissioner of Police. The  Singapore\r\n\r\nConstitution (Amendment) Act, 1970, empowers  the  Public\r\n\r\nService Commission to exercise disciplinary control  over\r\n\r\nSenior  Officers down to and including those of the  rank\r\n\r\nof  Inspector. In practice, the Public Service Commission\r\n\r\nhas  delegated  the  power of disciplinary  control  over\r\n\r\nInspectors  to  the  Commissioner of  Police.  Under  the\r\n\r\nPolice Force Act\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Chapter  78) the Commissioner of Police is  vested  with\r\n\r\ndisciplinary powers over all Junior Officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disciplinary proceedings against Inspectors and Junior\r\n\r\nOfficers are dealt with by the Police Disciplinary Boards\r\n\r\nformed  under  the Police Force Act and its  Regulations.\r\n\r\nThese Police Disciplinary Boards are made up entirely  of\r\n\r\nPolice  Officers  and  this enables the  Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nPolice  to  deal  with  ordinary breaches  of  discipline\r\n\r\nexpeditiously.  However, for some cases  of  breaches  of\r\n\r\ndiscipline such as those involving allegations of corrupt\r\n\r\npractices  it  is  important that the Disciplinary  Board\r\n\r\nformed  to  deal with them is not only in fact impartial,\r\n\r\nbut also seen in the eyes of the public to be so. Thus to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  such  cases  the Police  Disciplinary  Boards\r\n\r\nconsisting entirely of Police Officers are not  the  best\r\n\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore proposed that the Police Force Act be\r\n\r\namended  to  enable the Commissioner  of  Police,  if  he\r\n\r\nthinks  fit, to refer any disciplinary case involving  an\r\n\r\nInspector  or  a  Junior Officer to  the  Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission   to   be  dealt  with  in   accordance   with\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  regulations  for  public  officers.  It  is\r\n\r\nfurther  proposed  that  this amendment  be  effected  by\r\n\r\nadding a section 28A to the Police Force Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 28 of the Police Force Act empowers the\r\n\r\nPresident  to  dismiss or retire an  Inspector.  This  is\r\n\r\ninconsistent   with  the  provisions  in  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nConstitution (Amendment) Act, 1970, and with the terms of\r\n\r\ndelegation of powers by the Public Service Commission  to\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner.  Therefore, it is necessary  to  amend\r\n\r\nsection  28  of  the  Police Force  Act  to  empower  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Police to dismiss, retire, reduce in rank\r\n\r\nor mete out other punishment to an Inspector who is found\r\n\r\nguilty of an offence specified in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsection 27 (1) of the Act.
