He  did not say, however, that in  England\r\n\r\npublic  lotteries  are  illegal.  Now,  this  Bill\r\n\r\nbefore the House makes public lotteries legal.  So\r\n\r\nat  one fell swoop the Singapore Government  tries\r\n\r\nto  get  as much money as possible from those  who\r\n\r\nare already patronising the illegal bookmakers and\r\n\r\nthose  who can be attracted to patronise  the  new\r\n\r\nbetting shops and buy public lottery tickets  that\r\n\r\nwill  be  issued  by  approved  racing  clubs   or\r\n\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> You kill two birds with one stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, if they are really in\r\n\r\nearnest about helping the masses, they should make\r\n\r\none  experiment first to see whether  the  effects\r\n\r\nare  good  or bad. If the results are  good, then\r\n\r\nperhaps   they   could  embark   on   the   second\r\n\r\nexperiment.  Instead, at one fell swoop  they  are\r\n\r\nintroducing public gambling on a big scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure those of us who were here during the\r\n\r\nJapanese  military occupation will  remember  that\r\n\r\nthey  had public lotteries regularly; so regularly\r\n\r\nthat after a period of enthusiasm people began to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  wiser  and the tickets had to be sold  by  the\r\n\r\nChamber  of  Commerce and the One-Star,  Two-Star,\r\n\r\nand  Three-Star  men. They had legalised  gambling\r\n\r\ndens  in  amusement  parks. And  we  remember  the\r\n\r\npeople  found hanging behind some of  these  parks\r\n\r\nand  in  lanes,  because they had  lost  money  in\r\n\r\ngambling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the face of that kind of evidence, we\r\n\r\nare  now  going  back to make  the  same  kind  of\r\n\r\nexperiment on a big scale!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday I was accused of being out of touch\r\n\r\nwith  reality because I live in the atmosphere  of\r\n\r\nMoral Rearmament. Sir, that is far from the truth.\r\n\r\nInstead of being out of touch with reality, I must\r\n\r\nsay  that  I  am far more so now. I  realise  that\r\n\r\neverybody, deep down, is selfish unless he  has  a\r\n\r\nchange  of heart. Whether a man is a Communist,  a\r\n\r\ncapitalist or a socialist, or by whatever label he\r\n\r\ncalls himself, deep down he is selfish. And if  we\r\n\r\nsay  that a capitalist is selfish because he wants\r\n\r\nmoney,  the Communist is selfish because he  wants\r\n\r\npower.  So basically we are selfish unless  we  go\r\n\r\nthrough a period of change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, this seems on the surface to be a Bill\r\n\r\nto  stop  illegal  gambling, but  I  am  not  sure\r\n\r\nwhether the Government Benchers are saints.  Being\r\n\r\nrealistic - I know not all, but perhaps  a  few  are\r\n\r\napproaching sainthood, and even then they would be\r\n\r\nrealists - we admit that deep down the motive  might\r\n\r\nalso be selfish. Therefore, I presume that the $10\r\n\r\nmillion  is  the  bait  that  is  attracting   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member\r\n\r\nshould be careful about treading on grounds  which\r\n\r\nhave  already been covered in the debates  on  the\r\n\r\nprevious  two  Bills. We are now on a  Bill  which\r\n\r\nseeks    to   legalise   public   lotteries    and\r\n\r\nsweepstakes.  I know the dividing line  is  a  bit\r\n\r\ndifficult  to find, but I ask the hon. Member  not\r\n\r\nto retread the ground we have covered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, yesterday I was just\r\n\r\nabout to refer to a well-known philanthropist  who\r\n\r\ncannot be accused of having been out of touch with\r\n\r\nreality. A man who has made his way up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom poverty to the top rung in business cannot be\r\n\r\nregarded  as being out of touch with reality.  But\r\n\r\nthis man, Sir, had a different kind of reality. He\r\n\r\nwas  against public lotteries because he knew that\r\n\r\nthe   masses  would  fall  for  public  lotteries,\r\n\r\nthinking  they  were  going to  make  easy  money.\r\n\r\nThereby  they  would be deprived  of  their  hard-earned  earnings. He was realistic  not  with  the\r\n\r\nobject   of  exploiting  the  situation  and   the\r\n\r\nweaknesses  of the masses, but with  the  idea  of\r\n\r\npreventing them from going down deeper. His  life,\r\n\r\nSir,  was distinguished by his efforts to  improve\r\n\r\nthe living conditions of the masses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I refer to someone whose views should be\r\n\r\nmore   acceptable  to  those  on  the   Government\r\n\r\nbenches,  who  have  declared  that  they  are  so\r\n\r\nsocialistic  that  there is no  one  who  is  more\r\n\r\nsocialistic    than   themselves,    except    the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  Sir, I am referring to  Mr  Tan  Kah\r\n\r\nKee.  In  1947, the same issue was in  mind - public\r\n\r\nlotteries  in  order to clear the slums.  \"We  can\r\n\r\nclear  the  slums  with  State  lotteries.\"  I  am\r\n\r\nquoting, Sir, from a paper that is no longer being\r\n\r\npublished, the Sunday Tribune of 15th June,  1947.\r\n\r\nIt  was a burning issue then. I would like to read\r\n\r\nout  Mr  Tan's views as published in this  paper.\r\n\r\nSaid Mr\r\n\r\nTan:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Lottery, as we know, is one of the worst forms\r\n\r\nof  gambling. In this case, its evils would assume\r\n\r\nsuch  magnitude once it is started  as  to  spread\r\n\r\nharmful  effects  not  only  in  Malaya  and   the\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries but  also  in  places  far\r\n\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr Tan went further:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The ease with which money can be raised by\r\n\r\nrunning  a lottery is due to the weakness  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  who  resort to this kind of get-rich-quick\r\n\r\nspeculation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, he was realistic. I am realistic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Wherever there is a lottery, the poor will use\r\n\r\npart of their money to try their luck.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Finally:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The prize winners will benefit little from their\r\n\r\nluck. Money easily earned is easily spent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps the Government side does not agree\r\n\r\nwith  a  practical and realistic man like Mr  Tan\r\n\r\nKah  Kee  about public lotteries. However,  may  I\r\n\r\nappeal to them on this basis: that if after  their\r\n\r\nexperiments have been tried out for six\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonths,  and in all honesty they find the  effects\r\n\r\nare  not  good,  will  they  then  reconsider  the\r\n\r\nquestion and give up those measures which not only\r\n\r\nproduce additional revenue, but also produce other\r\n\r\nevils along with that additional revenue?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.41 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the Member for  Tanglin  has  been\r\n\r\nspeaking at great length and with great feeling on\r\n\r\nthe  subject  of  State lotteries  and  off-course\r\n\r\nbetting.  Indeed he spoke with such great  fervour\r\n\r\nthat  I cannot help coming to the conclusion  that\r\n\r\nhe   has   been   tormented  by   some   kind   of\r\n\r\npsychological fixation. Throughout  his  many  and\r\n\r\nvaried  speeches, I have been trying to trace  the\r\n\r\nroots of this fixation. So far as I can make  out,\r\n\r\nhe is troubled about two principal outcomes, which\r\n\r\nGovernment's measures would lead to. They are,  in\r\n\r\nthe  first place, that Government intends to  open\r\n\r\nhundreds  and thousands of betting shops.  When  I\r\n\r\ninterjected  with  the  word  \"millions\",  he  too\r\n\r\nagreed  that  we  might open millions  of  betting\r\n\r\nshops.  That  is  the first thing  that  has  been\r\n\r\ntroubling him. Now, may I assure him, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  that the Government does not intend to  open\r\n\r\neven one betting shop?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to his second fixation, and that is\r\n\r\nhis  fear that it would be our policy to encourage\r\n\r\nschoolboys  and the schoolgirls to bet on  horses.\r\n\r\nWhen  I  was a schoolboy, Mr Speaker, Sir,  which\r\n\r\nwas of course more recent than when the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin  was  a  schoolboy,  I  did  not  get  the\r\n\r\nimpression that there was any desire at all  among\r\n\r\nmy fellow schoolmates to bet on horses. I attended\r\n\r\nthe  school of which the Member for Tanglin is now\r\n\r\nthe  principal, and I can only hope that since  my\r\n\r\ngraduation from the school standards of  behaviour\r\n\r\nhave not declined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin went to great lengths to\r\n\r\ndiscourse on the evils of betting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think we have passed the\r\n\r\nsubject  of  betting. We are on public  lotteries,\r\n\r\nunless that is the same thing. Mr Minister?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir. He did say a great deal  about  the\r\n\r\nevils   of  gambling  and  generally  the   tragic\r\n\r\nconsequences that this could lead to. I would have\r\n\r\nthought that, if he were genuine in his belief, he\r\n\r\nwould  have pressed for the abolition of all types\r\n\r\nof gambling, including the present system of sales\r\n\r\nof  lottery  tickets to members. But this  is  not\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Member for Tanglin wanted. He obviously\r\n\r\nhas  no  objection  if lottery  tickets,  possibly\r\n\r\nhorse-racing, is strictly reserved for the delight\r\n\r\nof  a  few  persons. But the point  is  that  this\r\n\r\nactivity  is  now practised on such  an  extensive\r\n\r\nscale  that we cannot afford to ignore the illegal\r\n\r\nactivities,  which  have  surrounded  gambling  in\r\n\r\ngeneral. It is because of this that Government  is\r\n\r\nintroducing this type of legislation.  The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin  praised the previous Government  for\r\n\r\nresisting the temptation to legalise certain forms\r\n\r\nof  gambling and to allow for its extension  under\r\n\r\ncontrolled conditions. Now he is obviously  either\r\n\r\nunaware of or unimpressed by the great harm, which\r\n\r\nhas  been  done by illegal bookmakers and  private\r\n\r\nlottery syndicates, which are going on on  a  very\r\n\r\nlarge  scale.  These are major problems  which  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  tackle,  because they  are  one  of  the\r\n\r\nsources  of  income for secret society  gangsters,\r\n\r\nand  the whole underground apparatus of a gambling\r\n\r\norganisation  strikes at the root of  society  and\r\n\r\ndemoralises a large number of people.  The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin  is  only interested in  the  outward\r\n\r\nmanifestations  of gambling. So  long  as  on  the\r\n\r\nsurface  things appear decent, he does  not  worry\r\n\r\nabout  the  evil  that goes  on  behind  the  open\r\n\r\nfacade.  Although the previous Government did  not\r\n\r\ntake  the  measure, which we are now  taking,  the\r\n\r\nfact  remains  that  gambling  in  all  it  forms,\r\n\r\nparticularly in its illegal forms, has been on the\r\n\r\nincrease  all these years. And this is principally\r\n\r\ndue  to  the policy, which the Member for  Tanglin\r\n\r\nentirely   approves,  that  is,  to  confine   the\r\n\r\naccepted  forms of gambling, such as  lottery  and\r\n\r\nhorse, racing, to a limited circle and allow  the\r\n\r\nwhole cancer of illegal betting to spread all over\r\n\r\nSingapore. Mr Speaker, Sir, I find this  attitude\r\n\r\nmost  deplorable, and I think I could best express\r\n\r\nmy feelings on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  subject if I were to quote from a book  which\r\n\r\nis familiar to the Member for Tanglin.

It is just the reaction which\r\n\r\nI feel to the views which have been expressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nyesterday  we  were debating on the Betting  Bill,\r\n\r\nand as you have quite rightly ruled, the debate on\r\n\r\nthis  particular  Bill  shall  not  bring  in  any\r\n\r\nreference  to  betting shops. Sir,  yesterday,  at\r\n\r\nleast,  the Government had some reasonable  excuse\r\n\r\nto  introduce  such a Bill. It said that  it  must\r\n\r\nwipe  out  the  scourge of bookmakers.  Hence  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  the  Betting  Bill - to  wipe  out\r\n\r\nbookmakers.   But  if,  in  the  wiping   out   of\r\n\r\nbookmakers,  it is later considered  expedient  or\r\n\r\nnecessary that one should expand the activities of\r\n\r\nlegal  betting, then it could not be  helped,  one\r\n\r\nmust face reality. But now let us face the reality\r\n\r\nof this Bill. This is to give legal blessing to  a\r\n\r\npublic lottery. It is not betting at all. It  says\r\n\r\nthat  any person can now go and buy a ticket in  a\r\n\r\nsweepstake, in a public lottery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Sir, one of the reasons advanced for\r\n\r\nthe  Betting  Bill was that there  was  no  reason\r\n\r\nwhatsoever why so much money should flow into  the\r\n\r\npockets of bookmakers. Why should not this money\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  deflected into the coffers of Government?  But\r\n\r\nin  this  case, Sir, money has not gone  down  the\r\n\r\ndrain  nor into the pockets of anybody. If I  were\r\n\r\nto  buy  a  ticket  in a sweepstake  or  a  public\r\n\r\nlottery of a turf club of which I am not a member,\r\n\r\nyet  the Government is assured of its 30 per  cent\r\n\r\ntax.  There would be no loss of revenue,  even  if\r\n\r\nthe tickets were to be sold secretly and illegally\r\n\r\nto  non-members. Therefore, this attempt to try to\r\n\r\nsay that we should now legalise public lottery  is\r\n\r\njust  the thin end of the wedge. If Government  is\r\n\r\nreally   so  anxious  that  the  money  spent   on\r\n\r\nsweepstake  tickets by the public is  money  spent\r\n\r\nfoolishly by the public, and if the Government  is\r\n\r\nanxious  to  make  use of or to  cash  in  on  the\r\n\r\nweaknesses  of human nature, then it should  begin\r\n\r\nto  think.  But  perhaps it would be  a  wonderful\r\n\r\nthing if the Government could have a state lottery\r\n\r\nof  its own. Then it could have the whole 100  per\r\n\r\ncent instead of a meagre 30 per cent. This kind of\r\n\r\nstate  lottery is evil. It demoralises people.  It\r\n\r\nis  bad for the conscience of any good government.\r\n\r\nAnd  1  say this, Sir: that in spite of  what  has\r\n\r\nbeen said by the front benchers of the Government,\r\n\r\nit   is  significant  that  their  back  benchers,\r\n\r\nalthough  it  was  their  wont  to  stand  up  and\r\n\r\nchampion  any policy of the Government, have  been\r\n\r\nsilent. Perhaps, Sir, it is not so bad that  there\r\n\r\nis  still a conscience in the Party members of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> I am a back\r\n\r\nbencher,  Sir, and I have risen up to  answer  the\r\n\r\nfront bencher of the opposite bench.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> They do not have back benchers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> As usual the Opposition\r\n\r\nalways  like  to, as the Member for Cairnhill  has\r\n\r\njust said, cash in on whatever they think they can\r\n\r\ncash  in  on.  This  is one of the  opportunities,\r\n\r\nwhich they have. But I would not like to quote the\r\n\r\nScriptures, Sir. We all understand what ultimately\r\n\r\nit  really means. They try to paint a picture that\r\n\r\nthey  are real saints and that they are trying  to\r\n\r\nprotect  the public. They try and claim that  they\r\n\r\ncan really do something good. Whenever a good Bill\r\n\r\ncomes  from  the Government bench, they  say,  \"We\r\n\r\nagree with it.\" Yet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey try to pick holes here and there. And when it\r\n\r\ncomes  to  an acclaim from the public,  they  say,\r\n\r\n\"Oh,  we also agree with it.\" When it comes to  an\r\n\r\nissue  on  which  public opinion may  possibly  be\r\n\r\ndivided, they, of course, straightaway pick on the\r\n\r\nother side and say, \"We are on the morally correct\r\n\r\nside.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, is really meant to control and\r\n\r\nnot to allow an extension of public lotteries. The\r\n\r\nMember  for Cairn-hill said that the idea  of  the\r\n\r\nother two Bills which, were passed was to wipe out\r\n\r\nthe  bookmakers,  but  that  this  was  to  expand\r\n\r\nbetting.  Surely he knows the extent of chap-ji-ki\r\n\r\nthat  is rampant in Singapore. He will also  know,\r\n\r\nSir,  that a lot of people who are not members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Turf  Clubs  have  been buying  tickets  from\r\n\r\nmembers of the Turf Clubs. Cases have appeared  in\r\n\r\nthe  papers where non-members have to go to  court\r\n\r\nin  order  to sue for what they claim to be  their\r\n\r\nown   winnings.   This  is  a  common   occurrence\r\n\r\neverywhere. If anybody should care to  go  to  any\r\n\r\ncoffee-shop,  or  anywhere, they  can  always  buy\r\n\r\nthose tickets. Everybody knows that Social Welfare\r\n\r\ntickets  from the Federation are sold very  easily\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  Previously, when  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  was in power, they never seemed  to  do\r\n\r\nanything  about it. And now just because it  comes\r\n\r\nfrom  the  P.A.P. Government and just  because  we\r\n\r\nhope to control something which we know cannot  be\r\n\r\neradicated,  they  say it is  bad.  They  talk  of\r\n\r\nrealism. Well, this is realism right through. They\r\n\r\ndo  not  know what it really means. We the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nare   realistic   in  contradistinction   to   the\r\n\r\nidealistic  point which they are  advocating.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin also quoted  philanthropists,\r\n\r\nand     also     talked     about     selfishness.\r\n\r\nPsychologically,  everybody  born  is  in  a   way\r\n\r\nselfish.   But  the  difference  between   certain\r\n\r\nsystems  of  government is that in  socialism,  if\r\n\r\nthere  is any selfishness in a person, we try  and\r\n\r\ninculcate into that person how to learn and  think\r\n\r\nof  others.  In other words, we try and  think  of\r\n\r\nthings  from a socialistic point of view. Just  as\r\n\r\nman  is  now  able to inhibit the other  instincts\r\n\r\nthat  are inherent in him, so if there is  such  a\r\n\r\nthing as selfishness, we must also try and control\r\n\r\nit.  That is the only way of advancement  in  this\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin also mentioned the fact\r\n\r\nthat  this Bill was merely introduced in order  to\r\n\r\nobtain  revenue. Surely, he knows that  Government\r\n\r\nhave  many  other  ways  of  getting  revenue.  In\r\n\r\naddition, when he talked of the Government getting\r\n\r\n30  per cent revenue from the lotteries, in actual\r\n\r\nfact.  Government can gain much more revenue  from\r\n\r\nthe  sale  of liquor. What about revenue from  the\r\n\r\nbar  houses? What about revenue from samsu, liquor\r\n\r\nand even opium, if you like, which is not allowed?\r\n\r\nWhy is he not raising any objection to the sale of\r\n\r\nliquor?  The  amount  of revenue  that  Government\r\n\r\ngains  from the sale of liquor is very, very great\r\n\r\nindeed.  Surely  the Member for Tanglin  does  not\r\n\r\nwant  us to go back to the time, if I may  say  so\r\n\r\nagain, Sir, when his father was telling him  about\r\n\r\nJohore Bahru and that people had to go across  the\r\n\r\nCauseway  in order to indulge in a little  bit  of\r\n\r\ngambling.  Gambling is in the blood of  everybody.\r\n\r\nIf  we  cannot get rid of it, let us at least  try\r\n\r\nand  control it. If in controlling it we  get  the\r\n\r\ncondemnation of the opposite side, then we say, to\r\n\r\nput  it  kindly, that they have a special  bee  in\r\n\r\ntheir  bonnet,  or  that they are  merely  burying\r\n\r\ntheir heads in the sand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Byrne, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.02 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I notice that we\r\n\r\nhave  been condemned because, as practical men  of\r\n\r\naffairs,  we have sought to have two  bites  at  a\r\n\r\ncherry  at  the  same  time.  Mr  Speaker,   Sir,\r\n\r\neverybody  in Singapore knows this. It is  strange\r\n\r\nthat  the Members on the Front Bench opposite  are\r\n\r\nthe  people who appear not to know what  everybody\r\n\r\nin   Singapore  does  know.  The  public  gambling\r\n\r\nsituation in Singapore has two aspects. There  are\r\n\r\nthe  organisers of bookmaking. There are also  the\r\n\r\norganisers of public lotteries. The organisers  of\r\n\r\npublic lotteries are those who promote games  like\r\n\r\nchap-ji-ki, tikam ekor, three digits, four digits,\r\n\r\nor   what   have  you.  They  are  everywhere   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. They\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  operating  within 50 yards of  this  Assembly\r\n\r\nHouse.  Everybody knows that. We have got to  deal\r\n\r\nwith that situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin is a moralist and thinks\r\n\r\nthat  gambling  is quite wrong. We  as  socialists\r\n\r\nalso  say  that gambling in Singapore is a  social\r\n\r\nevil.  But look at the situation that we  find  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  From  1929, there has  been  legalised\r\n\r\ngambling  in  Singapore. The exemption  under  the\r\n\r\nBetting  Ordinance has been an exemption  that  we\r\n\r\nhave not introduced. It has `been part of our very\r\n\r\nlives from 1929. Look at the position of the  Turf\r\n\r\nClub  itself.  The Club is licensed  to  carry  on\r\n\r\ngaming, which is restricted to its members. It has\r\n\r\nthree  types  of  membership. There  are  ordinary\r\n\r\nmembers, there are subscribing members, and  there\r\n\r\nare  associate members. It could be said that  the\r\n\r\nordinary members are people who really go there to\r\n\r\nenjoy  the sport of racing. They gamble, but  they\r\n\r\nalso  take an interest in horse-racing as a sport.\r\n\r\nThe  subscribing members go there to bet. They pay\r\n\r\na  fee of $15 a year. The Government gets a tax of\r\n\r\nabout $5.20 as, entertainment duty. There are  the\r\n\r\nassociate  members. These people are not permitted\r\n\r\non  the  course. They go there just to participate\r\n\r\nin  the sweepstakes. They are there only for  that\r\n\r\npurpose.  It is common knowledge that anybody  can\r\n\r\ngo  to  the  Turf Club - he need not be a member - and\r\n\r\nparticipate to his heart's delight in gambling  if\r\n\r\nhe  wants  to  do  so  and  if  he  has  got  that\r\n\r\ninclination.  It is as simple as  all  that.  They\r\n\r\npass  their badges, to one another to go in.  That\r\n\r\nis the situation which my friend and colleague has\r\n\r\njust   referred   to.  That  is  the   veneer   of\r\n\r\nrespectability. So long as there is that veneer of\r\n\r\nrespectability,  the Member for  Tanglin  is  most\r\n\r\nsatisfied.  He can go to church and pray  all  the\r\n\r\nharder  for  it.  Mr Speaker. Sir,  that  is  the\r\n\r\nposition which we find in Singapore. Coupled with\r\n\r\nthat,  there  are  organisers of public  lotteries\r\n\r\nelsewhere  who send their lottery tickets  to  us.\r\n\r\nYou  can  go to any petrol kiosk at any  time  you\r\n\r\nwant.  You  buy petrol. You can also  buy  lottery\r\n\r\ntickets emanating from else-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere. That is the situation we find in Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  are socialists. We regard gambling objectively\r\n\r\nas a social evil. Something must be done about all\r\n\r\nthis.  We  cannot bury our heads in the sand  and\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Well,  God is in heaven and  everything  is\r\n\r\nright  in  the  world.\" We are not  that  sort  of\r\n\r\npeople.  That is why we have taken the trouble  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  the  Betting  Ordinance  to   make   it\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  these  operators  to  continue  to\r\n\r\noperate.  We  have  looked very closely  into  the\r\n\r\nCommon  Gaming Houses Ordinance, and we find  that\r\n\r\nthe provisions there are sufficient for us to deal\r\n\r\nwith  the situation. We are now running all  these\r\n\r\noperators to earth. Is it not better for us to try\r\n\r\nand   control   the  situation?  These   are   the\r\n\r\nfacilities available in the Turf Club. What we  do\r\n\r\nis to accept the facts as they are. We say, \"Well,\r\n\r\nif that is so, let us extend these facilities.\" We\r\n\r\ngo  for  all the clandestine organisers  of  these\r\n\r\ntypes   of   public  lotteries  and   extend   the\r\n\r\nfacilities available at the Turf Club to  all  and\r\n\r\nsundry. That is the realistic way of doing things.\r\n\r\nWhy  allow  these chaps to continue  to  get  huge\r\n\r\nprofits  from all this illegal bookmaking?  Surely\r\n\r\nthat  would  be  stupid on  our  part.  The  other\r\n\r\nalternative  is  this. Close down the  Turf  Club.\r\n\r\nThey  go elsewhere, just across the causeway. They\r\n\r\noperate  in the same way. What control do we  have\r\n\r\nover  the situation then? We are not talking sense\r\n\r\nif we do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when hon. Members say that\r\n\r\ngambling  is  evil, demoralising and bad  for  the\r\n\r\nconscience, we, the socialists, say that  that  is\r\n\r\nso. We have never come here and said that there is\r\n\r\nany justification for public gaming. We accept the\r\n\r\nsituation  as  it is and are trying  to  bring  it\r\n\r\nunder  effective  control and to check  all  these\r\n\r\ndemoralising influences on our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to refer to\r\n\r\nwhat the Member for Tanglin has suggested. He says\r\n\r\nthat  once this Bill is passed into law, there  is\r\n\r\nnothing  to  prevent  lotteries,  emanating   from\r\n\r\nelsewhere,  being sold publicly in  Singapore.  He\r\n\r\nhas  not  properly looked at the clauses  of  this\r\n\r\nBill. It is quite clear that only tickets sold  by\r\n\r\nan exempted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclub will not be regarded as tickets that are\r\n\r\npart of a public lottery. This is clearly stated\r\n\r\nin one of the clauses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, that is the position. We are\r\n\r\nrealists  and  we have therefore to introduce  the\r\n\r\nBill to try and bring the situation under control.\r\n\r\nIt  has  been  said  just now by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin  that I mentioned to this House  yesterday\r\n\r\nthat  the  House of Commons has passed legislation\r\n\r\nto  permit  betting  houses to be  established  in\r\n\r\nEngland. But in England they have not gone as  far\r\n\r\nas  we are proposing to do. Public lotteries  are\r\n\r\nstill  illegal  in England. But, Sir,  we  have  a\r\n\r\ndifferent situation here. I do not know  what  the\r\n\r\nsituation in England is. They there are facing  up\r\n\r\nto  their own internal problems. We face up to our\r\n\r\nown  problems. It is quite clear that it would  be\r\n\r\nfutile,  senseless and stupid on our  part  if  we\r\n\r\nonly  went  against the bookmakers  and  left  the\r\n\r\npeople  who  promote chap-ji-ki,  tikam  ekor  and\r\n\r\nother  forms of public gaming alone. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, we have listened to all that has been said on\r\n\r\nthis matter. Some have got emotional about it.  We\r\n\r\nare   rational  people.  So  far,  we  are   quite\r\n\r\nconvinced in our minds that this is the best  that\r\n\r\nwe can do in the present situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Mr Byrne].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That clause 2 stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, in clause 2 the new\r\n\r\nsection 23, line 4, there is the word \"any\":\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\" ... it shall not be an offence for any person to\r\n\r\nbuy a ticket or chance or take part in any public\r\n\r\nlottery held, promoted, ...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was put forward that children in school\r\n\r\nwould  not have the chance to buy lottery tickets.\r\n\r\nIf  these lottery tickets are on sale and if it is\r\n\r\nnot an offence for any person to buy a ticket, how\r\n\r\nare the young children to be prevented from buying\r\n\r\nthem? I would like the Minister for Labour and Law\r\n\r\nto  answer  that question and tackle  the  problem\r\n\r\nseriously. Sir, I have been accused of not  facing\r\n\r\nup  to realities. As a schoolmaster with 40 years'\r\n\r\nexperience, I know the habits of boys' very  well.\r\n\r\nDuring  this  period  of  40  years,  things  have\r\n\r\nchanged considerably. We have got secret societies\r\n\r\norganised in schools all over Singapore. That is a\r\n\r\nreality,  which we face today. We know  that  some\r\n\r\nboys in some schools are also conducting gambling\r\n\r\non  their own. If today they do anything like that\r\n\r\nor  they buy lottery tickets which are illegal and\r\n\r\nthey  are  reported, action is taken against  them\r\n\r\nand the practice stops. But once this Bill becomes\r\n\r\nlaw  and a schoolboy buys 20 tickets and he  sells\r\n\r\nthem to his friends to share the fortune that  is\r\n\r\nsupposed  to come, and if a teacher says  to  him,\r\n\r\n\"Sorry,  you  are  not allowed to  do  that.\"  the\r\n\r\nanswer is given to the teacher's face, \"Sir, it is\r\n\r\nthe law of the land.\" What is the teacher going to\r\n\r\nsay?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nquoted  the Scriptures. I hope he will quote  them\r\n\r\noften.  But I think he forgot to stress  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat when one studies the Scriptures, one has  got\r\n\r\nto learn to apply them to oneself first. We should\r\n\r\nlook for the mote in our own eyes before we try to\r\n\r\nremove  the beam from the eyes of other people.  I\r\n\r\nam  glad  that the Minister read a quotation  from\r\n\r\nthe  Scriptures and I hope that it will  apply  to\r\n\r\neveryone of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I find that\r\n\r\nI  have  to  rise again to speak on  this  clause.\r\n\r\nDuring   the  Second  Reading  of  this  Bill,   a\r\n\r\nGovernment Front-Bencher and a Back-Bencher  tried\r\n\r\nto explain that it was necessary to have this Bill\r\n\r\nbecause  Government wanted to control chap-ji-ki,\r\n\r\ntikam ekor, and so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non.  Sir, this is the only clause that is left  in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill. There is nothing in this Bill  to  say\r\n\r\nthat chap-ji-ki, tikam ekor, and so on, are to  be\r\n\r\ncontrolled. The control is already there. So it is\r\n\r\nnot right to say that this clause is introduced in\r\n\r\norder  to control chap-ji-ki and tikarn ekor.  But\r\n\r\nit  is right to say that this clause is introduced\r\n\r\nto  expand  facilities for taking part  in  public\r\n\r\nlotteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, it is not a case of\r\n\r\nexpansion but a case of rechanneling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin  has asked me to state whether it  is  the\r\n\r\nintention   of  the  Government  to  prohibit   or\r\n\r\nrestrict  the  sale of public lottery  tickets  to\r\n\r\nschool children and to young people generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is possible for control to\r\n\r\nbe  exercised in the case of betting  houses.  One\r\n\r\ncan  make  a  rule that people of  a  certain  age\r\n\r\nshould   not   be  admitted  into   such   places.\r\n\r\nAdministratively, it can be done. But in the  case\r\n\r\nof  the sale of public lottery tickets, it is  not\r\n\r\npossible to exercise a similar kind of control and\r\n\r\neven  if  we  try  to  do so, it  would  never  be\r\n\r\neffective. If a rule is made that lottery  tickets\r\n\r\nare not to be sold to youngsters, there is nothing\r\n\r\nto  prevent  older  people from  buying  them  and\r\n\r\npassing them on to youngsters. Even if it is ruled\r\n\r\nthat a youngster will not be entitled to the prize\r\n\r\nmoney on the lottery ticket he buys, what he  will\r\n\r\ndo  is to pass the ticket on to a grown-up person.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is  not possible to supervise  such  sales\r\n\r\nadministratively in that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point made by the Member for Tanglin\r\n\r\nwas  that  we appear to be wanting only to  expand\r\n\r\nthe  facilities  for gaming. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nhave taken the trouble just now to mention to  him\r\n\r\nthat these facilities are already available in the\r\n\r\nTurf   Club.   Three  types  of   membership   are\r\n\r\nrecognised there. An associate member is a  person\r\n\r\nwho  can  go there but he does not participate  in\r\n\r\nbetting.  He  goes  there to  participate  in  the\r\n\r\nsweeps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think all that is one big sham. Let us\r\n\r\nrecognise the position and say frankly, \"Let there\r\n\r\nbe  public lotteries.\" I have looked through  this\r\n\r\nBill  very carefully, Mr Speaker, Sir. Under  the\r\n\r\nCommon   Gaming   Houses  Ordinance,   there   are\r\n\r\nsufficient  powers to deal with the  promoters  of\r\n\r\nthese  public lotteries, like tikam ekor, chap-ji-\r\n\r\nki,  and  so  on. We have all the powers  that  we\r\n\r\nwant. No additional powers are necessary. All that\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  do is to go for them and bring  them\r\n\r\ndown.  That is what we are proposing to do.  There\r\n\r\nis  practically public gaming in the  premises  of\r\n\r\nthe  Turf Club and their tickets are sold  to  the\r\n\r\npublic.  There is a great difference, to my  mind,\r\n\r\nbetween purchasing a lottery ticket and placing  a\r\n\r\nbet  in a betting shop. Although we, as Socialists\r\n\r\ncondemn  gambling - like betting and organising  the\r\n\r\nsale  of sweepstake lottery tickets - where  is  the\r\n\r\nevil  really  in  buying a lottery  ticket  for  a\r\n\r\ndollar or fifty cents? It is not as evil as  going\r\n\r\ninto a betting shop and placing your bets. One has\r\n\r\ngot  to  acknowledge that people are human beings.\r\n\r\nAll those people -  even the person who places a bet\r\n\r\nor  buys  a lottery ticket - are not evildoers  just\r\n\r\nbecause they do that. It is the people who promote\r\n\r\nall  these  things that we are going for.  In  our\r\n\r\ncampaign, we will have to run these people in  and\r\n\r\nwe  will  have  to extend the betting  facilities.\r\n\r\nIncidentally,   we  will  get   more   money.   We\r\n\r\nacknowledge that. But we do not do all  this  with\r\n\r\nthe primary object of getting more revenue. Public\r\n\r\ngaming  has  reach ed such proportions  here  that\r\n\r\nsomething has got to be done about it and  we  are\r\n\r\ntaking  this course. We hope that we will  achieve\r\n\r\nthe  objects  that we have in view. We  are  quite\r\n\r\ndetermined to bring these activities under  proper\r\n\r\ncontrol  and  that  is why we  are  seeking  these\r\n\r\npowers from this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Sir, I quite\r\n\r\nagree  with  the  Minister that the  buying  of  a\r\n\r\nlottery  ticket is not evil. I am not thinking  of\r\n\r\nit  as  an evil. But what I fail to understand  is\r\n\r\nthis:  how does Government hope, by this Bill,  to\r\n\r\nsuppress or catch or arrest or stop these  illegal\r\n\r\noperators? Do Government think\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat, by having legal operators of their own, they\r\n\r\nare  going  to draw the public from these  illegal\r\n\r\nbookmakers to their own legal operators?  In  that\r\n\r\ncase,  as I asked yesterday, what competition  can\r\n\r\nthey offer? What I maintain is that they will  not\r\n\r\nbe  able to draw the crowd from the bookmakers and\r\n\r\nillegal  operators to the legal operators.  Unless\r\n\r\nthe  Government  see a way of  achieving  that,  I\r\n\r\nmyself  cannot see how this Bill is going to  help\r\n\r\nthem do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was indeed\r\n\r\nvery  disturbed  to learn from  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and Law when he confessed that,  with  the\r\n\r\noperation of this law, the Government would not be\r\n\r\nable  to  control the sale of lottery  tickets  to\r\n\r\nschool children. He said that school children  can\r\n\r\nnow  buy lottery tickets. As has been pointed  out\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister, it is only the members of  turf\r\n\r\nclubs  who can buy lottery tickets at the  present\r\n\r\ntime.  No  non-member  of a  turf  club  would  be\r\n\r\nqualified  to buy a lottery ticket from  a  member\r\n\r\nunless  he or she has confidence' in the integrity\r\n\r\nof  the  member.  Therefore,  the  sale  of  those\r\n\r\ntickets  to  a  non-member is  restricted  to  the\r\n\r\nextent of the integrity of the member who hopes to\r\n\r\nget a ten per cent cut of the prize money. But now\r\n\r\nto  say  that anyone - even school children - can  buy\r\n\r\nlottery tickets within the meaning of the  law  is\r\n\r\nsurely  an  expansion of, shall we say, facilities\r\n\r\nfor gambling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, when I put forward the\r\n\r\nproblem to the Minister, I had hoped that he would\r\n\r\nhave  been  able  to  find some  solution  whereby\r\n\r\nstudents and young children would not be  able  to\r\n\r\nbuy  lottery tickets and re-sell them. I am  sorry\r\n\r\nhe  has  admitted that it cannot be done and  that\r\n\r\nthere  is no solution. Sir, we know that the young\r\n\r\npeople  comprise more than half the population  of\r\n\r\nSingapore today. Fifty cent and dollar tickets are\r\n\r\nwithin  their reach. Therefore, when this Bill  is\r\n\r\npassed,  it  will  enable school children  to  buy\r\n\r\nlottery  tickets  freely and flaunt  them  in  the\r\n\r\nfaces   of  their  teachers,  saying,  \"There   is\r\n\r\nnothing, Sir, that you can do to prevent my buying\r\n\r\nthese tickets, because I am not going against  the\r\n\r\nlaw of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  land.\"  And that is going to  make  it  very\r\n\r\ndifficult for educationalists to tell them, \"Boys,\r\n\r\nyou  must work hard. You cannot depend on luck for\r\n\r\nsuccess  in  life. You have got to do  it  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  industry,\" because they can very  well\r\n\r\nsay,  \"That is all nonsense.

But\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  is going to encourage them to  do  so,\r\n\r\nbecause the Minister has now openly said that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will not be able to control  them  from\r\n\r\nbuying  lottery  tickets.

Even if we were to issue instructions\r\n\r\nthat  no  such  sales should  be  made  to  school\r\n\r\nchildren  and young people, there are no means  of\r\n\r\ncarrying  out those instructions. Suppose  it  was\r\n\r\ndecreed  that any youngster who, obtained a  prize\r\n\r\non  a  ticket  would not get the benefit  of  that\r\n\r\nprize, such a rule cannot be administered.

Article 23  of\r\n\r\nthe   Convention  provides  that  the  Convention\r\n\r\ncannot  be  ratified  by any  country  unless  its\r\n\r\nlegislation  and administrative organisations  are\r\n\r\nin  conformity  with the rules  contained  in  the\r\n\r\nConvention;  and  that  the Convention  cannot  be\r\n\r\nacceded  to on behalf of any territory unless  the\r\n\r\nlegislation  and  administrative  organisation  of\r\n\r\nthat territory are in conformity with such rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many of the provisions of the\r\n\r\nConvention  are  already  part  of  the   law   of\r\n\r\nSingapore, but in order to give complete effect to\r\n\r\nthe  Convention certain amendments  to  the  Penal\r\n\r\nCode  are required and these are contained in  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill proposes a definition of\r\n\r\n\"currency   note\"  which  follows  the  definition\r\n\r\ncontained  in section 1 (2) of the United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nCounterfeit Currency (Convention) Act, 1935.  This\r\n\r\ngives effect as far as paper money is concerned to\r\n\r\nArticle   2  of  the  Convention,  which   defines\r\n\r\ncurrency  as meaning \"paper money (including  bank\r\n\r\nnotes)  and  metallic money,  the  circulation  of\r\n\r\nwhich  is  legally recognised.\" As respects  metal\r\n\r\nmoney,  the  definitions of  \"coin\"  and  \"current\r\n\r\ncoin\" in section 230 of the Penal Code are already\r\n\r\nin accord with the requirements of the Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 and 4 of the Bill provide for the\r\n\r\nseizure and forfeiture of counterfeit currency and\r\n\r\ncoin, as well as instruments or other articles for\r\n\r\ncounterfeiting in order to give effect to  Article\r\n\r\n11 of the Convention.

Added  to\r\n\r\nthis  strange  situation, the control of  community\r\n\r\ncentres   and  youth  clubs  owned  and  built   by\r\n\r\nGovernment had by that time completely passed  into\r\n\r\nthe  hands  of community associations and  advisory\r\n\r\ncommittees  under  the control of  persons  closely\r\n\r\nconnected  with  the  former  Government  who  were\r\n\r\ndefeated  candidates at the last General  Election.\r\n\r\nSo  complete was this control that the staff of the\r\n\r\nDepartment of Social Welfare were only in name  the\r\n\r\nservants  of the Ministry. The result, as could  be\r\n\r\nexpected,  was a complete standstill in the  normal\r\n\r\nactivities of nearly all our community centres. The\r\n\r\nonly  activity  of  note then was  the  holding  of\r\n\r\ncinema  shows for which fees were charged,  and  it\r\n\r\nwas  generally  known that these  fees  were  being\r\n\r\npocketed by those in control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I decided that this situation\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  allowed  to  continue  and   gave\r\n\r\ninstructions that the Department of Social Welfare\r\n\r\nshould  reassume control of all community  centres\r\n\r\nand  youth  clubs  in Singapore. This  process  of\r\n\r\ntaking over was completed in December 1959. Having\r\n\r\nsucceeded  in bringing the community  centres  and\r\n\r\nyouth clubs under departmental control, it is  now\r\n\r\nnecessary   to   associate  the  people   in   the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of these community centres  and  youth\r\n\r\nclubs and for this purpose it is proposed in  this\r\n\r\nBill  to  set  up a Corporation by legislation  to\r\n\r\npromote  community recreation in  Singapore.  This\r\n\r\norganisation  would  be able  to  provide  trained\r\n\r\nleaders  who would be able to work on  the  ground\r\n\r\namongst   the  people,  popularise  the  community\r\n\r\ncentres   and  youth  clubs  and  organise   their\r\n\r\nactivities. No community centre or youth club  can\r\n\r\never  succeed  without the active co-operation  of\r\n\r\nthe  people, and such centres are most  successful\r\n\r\nif  they  are  run by leaders who  understand  the\r\n\r\nneeds and interests of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the Assembly is designed to set\r\n\r\nup  a People's Association which will work closely\r\n\r\nwith  the  Community Recreation  Division  of  the\r\n\r\nDepartment of Social Welfare and with associations\r\n\r\nrepresenting the people which will have members in\r\n\r\nthe Corporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of this Bill is designed to establish\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Association  as  a  Corporation  to\r\n\r\npromote community recreation in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 enables the Corporation to take over\r\n\r\nthe  assets and the movable and immovable property\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore Youth Sports Centre, which  has\r\n\r\nbeen wound up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill sets out the constitution\r\n\r\nof  the Board of Management which will consist  of\r\n\r\n14  members, with the Prime Minister as  Chairman,\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  for  Labour  and  Law  as   Deputy\r\n\r\nChairman,  the Minister for Finance, the  Director\r\n\r\nof  Social  Welfare  as  Secretary-Treasurer,  six\r\n\r\nmembers  to be appointed by the Chairman and  four\r\n\r\nmembers to be elected from among the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the organisations mentioned  in\r\n\r\nthe Schedule to the Bill. The Board will therefore\r\n\r\nhave  strong  Government representation  and  will\r\n\r\nhave  the benefit of the experience of its members\r\n\r\nwho  will  be  drawn from a very wide educational,\r\n\r\nrecreational and cultural field.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 of the Bill sets out the objects and\r\n\r\npowers  of the Corporation. The objects  are  \"The\r\n\r\norganisation of leisure and the promotion of youth\r\n\r\nactivities  in  order  not  only  to  develop  the\r\n\r\ncultural,  moral  and physical  potentialities  of\r\n\r\nyouth,  but  also  to  instil  in  the  youth   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  a  sense  of national  identity  and  a\r\n\r\nspirit  of dedicated service to the community  and\r\n\r\nthe    organisation   and   promotion   of   group\r\n\r\nparticipation in social, cultural, educational and\r\n\r\nathletic  activities in order that, the  youth  of\r\n\r\nSingapore may be made to realise that they  belong\r\n\r\nnot   to   any  particular  racial  or   religious\r\n\r\ncommunity,  but  to  a  Malayan  community   which\r\n\r\ntranscends  communal  and racial  loyalties.\"  The\r\n\r\nCorporation  has  power, inter  alia,  to  appoint\r\n\r\ncommittees, officers and servants to carry out its\r\n\r\nobjects  and receive contributions from Government\r\n\r\nand  other sources. It can also raise funds on its\r\n\r\nown.  Most important of all is its power to manage\r\n\r\nor run community centres, youth clubs, boys' clubs\r\n\r\nand  girls'  clubs  and to organise  training  for\r\n\r\nleaders  to  work  in such community  centres  and\r\n\r\nclubs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will not involve Government in any\r\n\r\nextra    financial   expenditure.   The   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation when incorporated will be able to draw\r\n\r\nupon  voluntary  service more  than  a  Government\r\n\r\ndepartment would be able to. There are at  present\r\n\r\n45  community centres and more are being built  in\r\n\r\nall  areas  in  Singapore where  there  are  large\r\n\r\nconcentrations   of   population   without    such\r\n\r\namenities. With this rapid expansion in the number\r\n\r\nof   community   centres  and  the  necessity   of\r\n\r\nproviding  a  planned  programme  of  educational,\r\n\r\ncultural  and  recreational  activities  for   the\r\n\r\nlarger numbers, which will be using these centres,\r\n\r\nit  is  obvious  that  an  organisation  like  the\r\n\r\nPeople's   Association   in   which   associations\r\n\r\nrepresenting the people are members will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetter   equipped  to  take  charge  of  community\r\n\r\nrecreation  on  such  a scale  than  a  Government\r\n\r\nDepartment.   Furthermore,  Government   machinery\r\n\r\nmoves slowly and Government servants on their  own\r\n\r\ncannot  provide the leadership required  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose.  A  People's Association is  clearly  the\r\n\r\nanswer.  Government  is confident  that  with  the\r\n\r\nestablishment   of   the   People's   Association,\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres  and youth  clubs  will  become\r\n\r\npopular  people's institutions which will help  to\r\n\r\nbring our peoples of various races closer together\r\n\r\nand  thereby  assist  us in  our  task  of  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding,  it  is most urgent therefore  that  the\r\n\r\nPeople's   Association  should   be   incorporated\r\n\r\nwithout any delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,   Sir,  concerning   the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation Bill which is tabled before the  House\r\n\r\nnow, we must thank the Minister for Labour and Law\r\n\r\nfor  introducing this significant and constructive\r\n\r\nBill which can be regarded as a valuable gift  for\r\n\r\nour National Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are aware that the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nwill   not  follow  the  previous  Government   in\r\n\r\nadopting   a   negative   attitude   towards   the\r\n\r\norganisations, letting them emerge  and  disappear\r\n\r\nby   themselves.  Our  aim  is  to  initiate   the\r\n\r\nactivities of the various organisations,  and  pay\r\n\r\ndue  regard to them. But public funds must be well\r\n\r\nutilised  so  as to ensure that they will  not  be\r\n\r\nwasted. Therefore, we must count every cent, which\r\n\r\nis  to be spent. Then we will be able to carry out\r\n\r\nthe  maximum amount of work with the minimum  cost\r\n\r\nfor the benefit of the greatest number of people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From clause 5 of this Bill, we can see clearly\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government has expressed  much  concern\r\n\r\nabout the development of the People's Association.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  one of the  reasons  why  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has  today become the governing  Party  in\r\n\r\nthis  House is that we are getting the support  of\r\n\r\nthe people of Singa-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npore.  The people of Singapore have given us their\r\n\r\nsupport because of our spirit of dedicated service\r\n\r\nto  them,  because  we share with  them  in  their\r\n\r\nvicissitudes  and  because we work  together  with\r\n\r\nthem.  Our policy is based on this principle.  Our\r\n\r\nattitude  now  in the discussion of this  Bill  is\r\n\r\nalso based on this guiding principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule on page 7 of the Bill reflects\r\n\r\naccurately our point of view. In this Schedule  we\r\n\r\nhave   included   scouting  organisations,   youth\r\n\r\norganisations, recreational organisations, student\r\n\r\nbodies  or  old boys' associations, and  the  Fine\r\n\r\nArts Society. Also the Dewan Bahasa dan Kebudayaan\r\n\r\nKebangsaan  which  was passed yesterday.  Although\r\n\r\nonly 45 organisations are set out in the Schedule,\r\n\r\nyet  it  has a wide representation from among  the\r\n\r\nexisting statutory organisations in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the setting-up of the People's Association\r\n\r\nis  a  matter worth our attention. It is the first\r\n\r\ntime  that the Government and public organisations\r\n\r\nare  shouldering  the task of  providing  communal\r\n\r\nrecreational  activities. This  is  another  proof\r\n\r\nthat  this  Government is determined to  encourage\r\n\r\npeople to participate in Government organisations.\r\n\r\nI   believe  that  with  the  initiative  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and with the assistance of the people,\r\n\r\nthe   organisation  and  the  development  of  the\r\n\r\nactivities of the People's Association will spread\r\n\r\nswiftly like fire all over the Island.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is expected that the activities of the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association in the field of culture  will\r\n\r\nbe  widened. My colleague, the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nand  Law,  has  reiterated time and again  in  the\r\n\r\nPress  that the Government will gradually increase\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  community centres.  However,  the\r\n\r\nbuilding of low-cost community centres is based on\r\n\r\nthe   Government's  economic  policy,   which   is\r\n\r\nentirely   different   from   the   wasteful   and\r\n\r\nunrealistic  policy of the past  Government.  Low-cost  community centres will be built up all  over\r\n\r\nthe  island, especially in the rural areas,  where\r\n\r\nthere is hardly any centre. Now the Government  is\r\n\r\nlooking  for  a site and as soon as  the  building\r\n\r\nplans are ready, work will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbegin.  The  setting-up of  community  centres  is\r\n\r\nconsistent with our pledge to the people. In  Part\r\n\r\nI page 4 of our Chinese pamphlet on P.A.P. policy,\r\n\r\nwe  have  stated that we need many small units  of\r\n\r\ncommunity centres or clubs in the rural areas.  We\r\n\r\nwill  look for suitable sites for the building  of\r\n\r\nthese centres. The past Government spent a lot  of\r\n\r\nunwarranted money on a few beautiful and luxurious\r\n\r\ncentres  in urban areas, which were not  used  for\r\n\r\nproper  recreational activities. There  is  urgent\r\n\r\nneed  for low-cost community centres in the  rural\r\n\r\nareas so that the rural people can make use of and\r\n\r\nenjoy the facilities provided by these centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. Government will make full use of\r\n\r\ncommunity centres for the purpose of carrying  out\r\n\r\nthe  aims contained in clause 10 (1) (b)  of  this\r\n\r\nBill.  That  is  to say, the People's  Association\r\n\r\nwill be responsible for the work of organising and\r\n\r\npromoting culture and education. Singapore  has  a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial  society,  yet  the  past  Government\r\n\r\ndisregarded the importance of racial communication\r\n\r\nand  contact. In the past, most of the people  who\r\n\r\nparticipated  in community centre activities  were\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated people. The non-English  educated\r\n\r\npeople who participated were much less. This  one-sided  development is completely contrary  to  the\r\n\r\naim  of the People's Association and the community\r\n\r\ncentres.  As a result, we find there has  been  no\r\n\r\nimprovement  in communal customs and  usage.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government will not allow this  ailing\r\n\r\nand  negative attitude to continue to develop. The\r\n\r\nintroduction of the People's Association  Bill  is\r\n\r\nan  announcement of the death of the past  ruling\r\n\r\npower  and the start of a new direction and spirit\r\n\r\nin our work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at present there are four\r\n\r\ndifferent streams of education in Singapore, which\r\n\r\nare  using  their respective mother  tongue  as  a\r\n\r\nmedium  of  communication. So there is hardly  any\r\n\r\nchance for association and understanding among the\r\n\r\nstudents of these various streams except once in a\r\n\r\nwhile when there may be some contact at a combined\r\n\r\nschools sports meet. The mixed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschools run by the Ministry of Education are still\r\n\r\nin an experimental stage. Therefore, we must hurry\r\n\r\nto  take action to check our weak points. The only\r\n\r\nway  to  achieve  this is to set up  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the new community centres will\r\n\r\nopen  the  door to young people of all  races  and\r\n\r\nwill  provide them with an opportunity which  they\r\n\r\nlack in school. In other words, to enable them  to\r\n\r\nmake  use of the centres for friendly association,\r\n\r\nstudy  and  work.  In this way  they  will  better\r\n\r\nunderstand  their  respective  custom  and  usage,\r\n\r\nwhich  will  help  to  improve  communication  and\r\n\r\npromote racial culture. Furthermore, they can make\r\n\r\nuse  of  these  facilities to learn Malay  and  be\r\n\r\nproficient  in  their conversations  and  writing.\r\n\r\nThis is of great significance in the evolution  of\r\n\r\na Malayan culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, according to the 1957\r\n\r\npopulation  census.  46  per  cent  of  our  total\r\n\r\npopulation are people who are above 21 years  old,\r\n\r\nwhereas the number of people under 21 years  comes\r\n\r\nto  53  per cent. Of this number, 46 per cent  are\r\n\r\nteenagers  under  15 years old.  Furthermore,  the\r\n\r\nschool-going children make up 22 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the above percentages, we can see for\r\n\r\nourselves  that  more than  50  per  cent  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation  are  young  people.  Therefore,  their\r\n\r\nbehaviour and conduct is a decisive factor in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  and future of our country. That  is  why\r\n\r\nthe  Government expresses much concern about their\r\n\r\nconduct.   Because   prior   to   gaining   social\r\n\r\nexperiences,  our  young people  are  too  simple-\r\n\r\nminded  and  their behaviour and ways of  thinking\r\n\r\nare  easily  influenced by society. We must  teach\r\n\r\nthem to realise their importance to society and to\r\n\r\ninstil  in them a sense of national consciousness.\r\n\r\nThis  is  only one half of the work to be  carried\r\n\r\nout   by   our   schools  and  by   the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation.  The  other half  of  the  work  will\r\n\r\ndepend  on the family. Sir, at present, there  are\r\n\r\ncertain  drawbacks in our society.  Many  parents,\r\n\r\nonce  they  have  sent their children  to  school,\r\n\r\nleave the education\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   their   children  entirely  to  the   school.\r\n\r\nforgetting  their responsibilities  towards  their\r\n\r\nchildren.  They fail to pay sufficient  regard  to\r\n\r\ntheir   children,  so  that  their  children   are\r\n\r\ninfluenced by the evil forces of society  and  get\r\n\r\nthemselves involved in criminal activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If every parent will consider the education of\r\n\r\nhis  children as his compulsory responsibility and\r\n\r\nsee  to their activities, then I believe that  the\r\n\r\nyouth  of  this country will have a bright  future\r\n\r\nand  the State will benefit substantially from it.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, I beg to support the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  Bill.  We  are  all  aware  that  the\r\n\r\nsetting-up  of  the  People's Association  by  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party is of great significance. We\r\n\r\nset  up  this People's Association for the purpose\r\n\r\nof realising our Party aims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The units to be represented in the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  are  set out in the Schedule  of  the\r\n\r\nBill. The managing members include representatives\r\n\r\nfrom  educational, cultural, recreational and  old\r\n\r\nboys' associations. This People's Association  can\r\n\r\nbe  said  to  have  a full representation  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting   organisations   in   Singapore.    This\r\n\r\nrepresentation  also  reflects  the   Government's\r\n\r\nattitude.   If   we   can   organise   all   these\r\n\r\norganisations  under the People's Association  and\r\n\r\npopularise it in every corner of the island, then,\r\n\r\non  the  one hand, it will be consistent with  our\r\n\r\nParty  aim  to strengthen unity among the  various\r\n\r\nraces  of  the people, and, on the other hand,  we\r\n\r\ncan raise the cultural standards of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has expressed much concern about\r\n\r\nthe  living conditions of the people. The Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Labour  and  Law  has  announced  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will build many community centres  all\r\n\r\nover  the  island. The setting-up of this People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  will enable the people to participate\r\n\r\nin community activities. This Association will not\r\n\r\nonly improve communications between the people of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  races  but  will also raise  the  educational\r\n\r\nstandards  and  cultural  understanding   of   the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me tell you something about the\r\n\r\nconditions  of the community centres in  the  past\r\n\r\nGovernment  and why I support this  Bill.  In  the\r\n\r\npast,  the attitude towards community centres  was\r\n\r\nnegative and was a departure from the wish of  the\r\n\r\nmasses of the people. They very seldom went to the\r\n\r\ncommunity centres and made' use of them.  I  know,\r\n\r\nfrom  my  visits,  that certain community  centres\r\n\r\nstill  have the sign. \"Beware of Dogs\" hanging  on\r\n\r\nthe  door.  Formerly, good results  were  expected\r\n\r\nfrom   grand  exhibitions  like  the  Agricultural\r\n\r\nExhibition.  But,  on  the  contrary,  there  were\r\n\r\ninstances  of gambling like tikam, and  facilities\r\n\r\nwere  provided  for the people to  gamble  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity centres. Therefore, it can be seen  that\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres in the past  were  not  run  on\r\n\r\nproper   lines,  Because  of  this,   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment took over these community centres  with\r\n\r\nthe  object  of  uniting the people  of  different\r\n\r\nraces  and  to bring them closer to the Government\r\n\r\nso  as to understand its policies. These community\r\n\r\ncentres   act  as  a  liaison  body  between   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the people, thereby breaking  down\r\n\r\nthe barrier that existed between them in the past.\r\n\r\nIf  we have the People's Association, we will then\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  teach these people  to  become  good\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past, in the guise of\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres,  many bad deeds,  took  place.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  our  aim  is to unite  the  people  of\r\n\r\ndifferent races together and to promote friendship\r\n\r\namong them through cultural activities in order to\r\n\r\nshow them a better way of life. As members of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's   Association,  the  people  will   fully\r\n\r\nrealise  that they can have their aims  satisfied.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  work to be  done  will  be  fully\r\n\r\nappreciated by them. The community centres will be\r\n\r\ncentres for their activities and they will be able\r\n\r\nto voice their wishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Byrne, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the\r\n\r\nsilence of the Members of the Opposition, I do not\r\n\r\npropose to say anything in addition to what I have\r\n\r\nalready said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Byrne].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.19 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1-\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is a Note:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 1, marginal note: after \"title\", to\r\n\r\ninsert \"and commencement\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That will be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 to 4 inclusive ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 38, after \"Chairman;\", to insert\r\n\r\n\"and\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment is necessary to improve the\r\n\r\nsyntax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is a typographical omission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5, as amended, ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6 and 7 ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 4, line 1, after \"doing\", to insert\r\n\r\n\"shall\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be a typographical omission or a\r\n\r\ngrammatical mistake depending on bow you look at\r\n\r\nthese things!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It depends on whether you have\r\n\r\nblinkers on!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8, as amended, ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 4, line 37, after \"paragraph (b)\", to\r\n\r\ninsert \"of subsection (2)\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was an inadvertent omission, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9, as amended, ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 10 to 15 inclusive ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That the Schedule stand part\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there\r\n\r\nhave  been a few inadvertent omissions.

In the case of a trade union of\r\n\r\nemployees  the trade union must be an  association\r\n\r\nof   employees  within  a  trade,  occupation   or\r\n\r\nindustry   or   within  trades,   occupations   or\r\n\r\nindustries  which  are  in  the  opinion  of   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar similar.

In this respect, I  propose\r\n\r\nto  move an amendment, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, at\r\n\r\nthe Committee Stage of the Bill to provide that  a\r\n\r\nperson shall not be a member of an executive of  a\r\n\r\ntrade  union  if  he  has been convicted  for  the\r\n\r\nillegal expenditure or use of trade union funds or\r\n\r\nof criminal breach of trust, extortion or criminal\r\n\r\nintimidation. The Bill also provides in clause  29\r\n\r\nthat a person shall not be employed as an employee\r\n\r\nof  a  trade union if he has been convicted  of  a\r\n\r\ncriminal  offence. Power is given to the  Minister\r\n\r\nin  clause 30 to exempt any trade union or  person\r\n\r\nfrom  the provisions relating to disqualifications\r\n\r\nand also to rule that the disqualification arising\r\n\r\nfrom  conviction  shall  not  apply  where  he  is\r\n\r\nsatisfied  that  the  person  convicted  has  been\r\n\r\nreformed.  In  Committee, I  shall  be  moving  an\r\n\r\namendment  to clause 30 to enable the Minister  to\r\n\r\nexempt   a   union  of  employers   from   certain\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Bill where it will be impossible\r\n\r\nfor such union to comply with these provisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum age for membership of a trade union\r\n\r\nwill  be  lowered from 18 to 16 years, but members\r\n\r\nunder 18\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears  of  age  will not be eligible  to  vote  on\r\n\r\ncertain  matters.

If my memory serves me  right,  in\r\n\r\nthat  speech I stressed that it was essential  for\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment to ensure that the officials of a trade\r\n\r\nunion  should  comprise Singapore  citizens  only.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in this Trade Unions Bill, there  is  an\r\n\r\namendment to the effect that persons born  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation are eligible to become officials  of  a\r\n\r\ntrade  union. From the point of view of  U.M.N.O.,\r\n\r\nthe   wide  opportunities  offered,  without   any\r\n\r\nspecific   mention  that  persons  born   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation should first become Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\nare   undesirable.  In  its  fight   to   suppress\r\n\r\nsubversive   elements   in   Singapore   and   the\r\n\r\nFederation, it is necessary for the Government  to\r\n\r\nkeep a watchful eye on the trade union leadership.\r\n\r\nBut  we  are compelled to seek clarification  from\r\n\r\nthe  Government on this point. What  will  be  the\r\n\r\nfate of the Government if the leaders of the trade\r\n\r\nunions   wrest  control  from  them  and  exercise\r\n\r\ninfluence on them? In that situation, I  am  quite\r\n\r\nsure,  Mr Deputy Speaker, the question  of  peace\r\n\r\nwill have to be considered not only in relation to\r\n\r\nthe  internal  security  situation,  but  also  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  the defence of our  State  from  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  threat. We consider it most undesirable\r\n\r\nfor  such  men to participate in the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement. Therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, on behalf\r\n\r\nof  the  U.M.N.O., we have brought this matter  to\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly.

Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the passing of the Industrial Relations Bill\r\n\r\nestablished the future course on which  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions in Singapore would follow in pursuing their\r\n\r\nclaims  in  future. In fact, a new era will  begin\r\n\r\nwith  the implementation of the provisions of that\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade unions will have to adhere to sense\r\n\r\nand  logic, and will have to exercise greater care\r\n\r\nin  the preparation of their claims. In the  past,\r\n\r\nthe   law   of  the  jungle  prevailed.  Employers\r\n\r\nrecognised  and  respected  larger  and   stronger\r\n\r\nunions, but took advantage of the weakness of  the\r\n\r\nsmaller  and  less militant unions.  But  now  the\r\n\r\nsituation has changed. The future prospects of the\r\n\r\nworking  class in Singapore depend on the  ability\r\n\r\nof the individual unions to prepare and present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na sound case for judgment by an independent court.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  say  that it is in this context  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  examine  the merits of this  Trade  Unions\r\n\r\nBill before us today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody in his proper senses can deny the fact\r\n\r\nthat  when this Bill is passed, and its provisions\r\n\r\nare   implemented,   the   unification   and   the\r\n\r\nstrengthening   of   the  workers'   movement   in\r\n\r\nSingapore will be helped greatly. In the past,  in\r\n\r\nthe  good old days of the previous Government, the\r\n\r\ntrade  union  movement  as  a  whole  was  one  of\r\n\r\nridicule. There were more than 200 trade unions in\r\n\r\nSingapore, each ranging in membership from  30,000\r\n\r\nto  nothing,  and more than 50 per cent  of  these\r\n\r\nunions  ranged in membership from nothing to  only\r\n\r\nabout  250. And in many cases, the smaller  unions\r\n\r\nwere yellow and splinter unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the elections, the P.A.P. pledged to wipe\r\n\r\nout these yellow and splinter unions and encourage\r\n\r\nthe healthy growth of the movement. As soon as the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was constituted, we went  about  doing\r\n\r\nthis. Today a number of splinter and yellow unions\r\n\r\nhas  been  forcibly removed from  the  arena,  and\r\n\r\nthere are some on the waiting list. In due course,\r\n\r\nthey will be removed too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main features of the Trade Unions Bill\r\n\r\nare   (1)   the   requirement  of   a   democratic\r\n\r\nconstitution and proper representation of  members\r\n\r\nin  the  management of the affairs of the  unions;\r\n\r\n(2)  the  requirement of a minimum number  of  250\r\n\r\nmembers for registration and the categories of the\r\n\r\nunions;  and  (3)  compulsory  affiliation  to  an\r\n\r\nassociation of trade unions, i.e., at the  moment,\r\n\r\nthe T.U.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we encourage proportional\r\n\r\nrepresentation  as  far  as  possible.  There  are\r\n\r\nunions  in Singapore where a minority manages  the\r\n\r\naffairs of a majority. And it has been found often\r\n\r\nthat  not  only  the  views and  interest  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority went unheard, but also suppressed by  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  some  constitutional technicalities.  For\r\n\r\nexample,   the   Army  Civil  Service   Union   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  where  some 12,000 industrial  workers\r\n\r\nare  not  properly represented in their  executive\r\n\r\nwhich  is  dominated  by a  minority  of  clerical\r\n\r\nworkers. And secondly, the require-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nment  of  250 members for the registration  of  an\r\n\r\nemployees'  union and the necessity  to  have  the\r\n\r\nunions  within  the  categories  set  out  in  the\r\n\r\nSchedule  are vital if we are to have  unification\r\n\r\nof the movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, the previous Government was more\r\n\r\ndemocratic   in  that  they  allowed   thugs   and\r\n\r\nblack-legs  to  form unions. Therefore,  we  had  a\r\n\r\nstring  of unions operated by racketeers who  were\r\n\r\never   prepared  to  break  strikes   and   supply\r\n\r\nblack-legs.  Seven workers could form a union.  And\r\n\r\nif  the  applicants had the blessings of notorious\r\n\r\nmen  like  Lee  Yew Seng, then the Government  and\r\n\r\nemployers  made  sure that they received  all  the\r\n\r\nsupport  for the furtherance of the objectives  of\r\n\r\nthese  people,  although  their  objectives   were\r\n\r\nfundamentally  opposed to the  aspiration  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no matter how liberal one decides to be, it\r\n\r\nis  nonsense to allow every Tom. Dick and Harry to\r\n\r\nform  a union, because, finally, what we will have\r\n\r\nare  as many unions as workers, and that would  be\r\n\r\nabsurdity  at  its  height.  It  is  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nprinciple to have one union in one industry.  This\r\n\r\nis  the  basic  phenomena  in  aid  of  collective\r\n\r\nbargaining. And any Government worth its salt must\r\n\r\nendeavour to establish this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now almost one year since the election\r\n\r\ntook place and this Government constituted. During\r\n\r\nthis   period,  many  changes  have  taken  place,\r\n\r\nchanges  by and large benefiting the workers.  The\r\n\r\noffice of the Minister for Labour and Law has been\r\n\r\ntransformed  from  a bureaucratic  agency  of  the\r\n\r\nemployers  in  the  past  to  a  fair   and   just\r\n\r\ninstitution,  ever  vigilant  to  check   ruthless\r\n\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the significance of the change is simply\r\n\r\nthis.  In  the past the trade unions had not  only\r\n\r\nthe employers to face, but also the Government.  A\r\n\r\nGovernment  which claimed to be popularly  elected\r\n\r\nbut  which  had its heart and soul pawned  to  the\r\n\r\nemployers; whereas now the position has been  made\r\n\r\nclear.  The Government is undoubtedly on the  side\r\n\r\nof  the workers, and this has been stated time and\r\n\r\nagain,  and it has been proved by words and deeds.\r\n\r\nIn requiring 250 members as the minimum number for\r\n\r\nthe  registration of a trade union, the Government\r\n\r\nis being extremely fair, because,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the first place, no thug is going to organise a\r\n\r\nyellow  union  and no pimp is going  to  have  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to organise a splinter union.  Because\r\n\r\nexperience  has  proved  that  these  people   are\r\n\r\nincapable of mustering the strength. But if  there\r\n\r\nshould  be a legitimate case, which I think  would\r\n\r\nbe  a  remote possibility, because existing unions\r\n\r\ncover  almost all industries, then I am  sure  the\r\n\r\nprovision will be well met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government does not intend to usurp the\r\n\r\nright   of  the  unions  to  participate  in   the\r\n\r\nunification of the movement, and setting  out  the\r\n\r\ncategories  in the Schedule is merely establishing\r\n\r\na  basis  for  the unions to work on. Without  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Bill and without the eradication\r\n\r\nof  splinter and yellow unions, if we are to  hope\r\n\r\nfor  the unification of the movement, I would say,\r\n\r\nspeaking  from  my own experience, that  it  would\r\n\r\ntake   at   least  ten  years  for  the  hope   to\r\n\r\nmaterialise. Therefore, in brief, what  this  Bill\r\n\r\nseeks  to do is to propel the development  of  the\r\n\r\ntrade union movement forward, and to encourage the\r\n\r\nunification of the movement. And I am certain that\r\n\r\nwith  the  passing  of  this  Bill  and  with  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of its provisions, we will  have  a\r\n\r\nstronger, a healthier and a unified movement in  a\r\n\r\nvery  short  time, perhaps in about  a  couple  of\r\n\r\nyears' time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on the question of compulsory\r\n\r\naffiliation  I would say this. Whether  compulsion\r\n\r\nis  democratic or not is futile to  ask.  What  is\r\n\r\nimportant  is whether it is desirable. Slogans  on\r\n\r\ndemocratic principles are beautiful but  they  are\r\n\r\nmeaningless  if  the  results  they  produce   are\r\n\r\nundesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitution of the T.U.C. has been amended\r\n\r\nand  the organisation is being geared to meet  the\r\n\r\nnew  situation. The future, as I envisage it, will\r\n\r\ncreate   a   democratic  centralization   of   the\r\n\r\nmovement. But there are all sorts of wild talk  in\r\n\r\ntown.  Wild talk about the so-called 10 Tall  Men.\r\n\r\nBut this is far too stupid to demand attention and\r\n\r\nto require clarification. But what I wish to point\r\n\r\nout  is this. In the final analysis, it is not the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General or the Secretariat of the T.U.C.\r\n\r\nwhich will decide, but the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers   themselves.

But it was\r\n\r\nleft  to a backbencher to take it upon himself  to\r\n\r\nspeak  on behalf of the Government and to go  into\r\n\r\nmatters, which were not touched on by the Minister\r\n\r\nin his speech at all. As was to be expected, there\r\n\r\nwas  reference  made of the work of  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment vis-a-vis the trade union movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous Government was accused of being on\r\n\r\nthe  side  of  employers, of trying to  choke  the\r\n\r\nhealthy growth of the trade union movement and  of\r\n\r\na  number of other crimes perpetrated against  the\r\n\r\ntrade unions in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, if one were to be honest with one's\r\n\r\nself and if one were to go through the records  of\r\n\r\nthe  industrial strife that took place during  the\r\n\r\nlife  of  the previous Government, one would  have\r\n\r\narrived at the conclusion that it was a lamentable\r\n\r\nfact  that the trade unions in Singapore  at  that\r\n\r\ntime had been misguided and had been made use\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof by people who did not have the interests of the\r\n\r\ncountry nor the interests of the workers at heart.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  do not think it is a good thing  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  go  into  detail as to what  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment had done or had not done. Let us rather\r\n\r\nconfine  ourselves to the Bill that is before  the\r\n\r\nHouse.  The  Bill, as the Minister has  said,  has\r\n\r\nincorporated a number of sections that are already\r\n\r\nin existence and also sections of the Trade Unions\r\n\r\nBill in the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, however, has departed in two\r\n\r\ndirections.  One is that it is now felt  that  the\r\n\r\nofficers  of a trade union should only  come  from\r\n\r\nthose who are citizens of Singapore or people born\r\n\r\nin the Federation of Malaya. Another one is that a\r\n\r\ntrade union, if it is to be registered, must first\r\n\r\nof all be affiliated to the Trades Union Congress,\r\n\r\nwhich  obviously  will  get  exemption  from   the\r\n\r\nMinister  under clause 59. The Minister also  goes\r\n\r\non to say that any registered trade union can have\r\n\r\nits  registration withdrawn if  it  is  no  longer\r\n\r\naffiliated to the T.U.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been pointed out in this House by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Kampong Kembangan that the time has\r\n\r\ncome for control of the trade unions to be in  the\r\n\r\nhands  of  the citizens of Singapore, and  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  clause 28 introduced by the Government  does\r\n\r\nnot  go far enough. On the one hand, Sir, we  will\r\n\r\nbe   debating   later   on  on   the   Citizenship\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill. In that Bill we are going to  be\r\n\r\nasked  to  approve steps to make it more difficult\r\n\r\nfor people to become citizens of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizenship, Sir, is and must be the very\r\n\r\ntreasure  of a man living in Singapore. It  should\r\n\r\nopen  to him, and it has opened to him, many gates\r\n\r\nof opportunities in Singapore. If it is really the\r\n\r\ndesire of the Government to make it more difficult\r\n\r\nfor   people  to  become  citizens  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nsurely,  the  same must be made in this  instance,\r\n\r\nthat  in so far as the control of the trade unions\r\n\r\nis concerned, it should be left in the hands of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  who  are citizens of Singapore.

I was just wondering whether\r\n\r\nit  would not be more convenient if those  remarks\r\n\r\ncould  be made in the Committee stage where  there\r\n\r\nis, in fact, a proposed amendment dealing with the\r\n\r\nmatter being raised now. The Member for Cairnhill,\r\n\r\nof course, is perfectly entitled to carry on if he\r\n\r\nwishes  to in that strain. But I thought it  would\r\n\r\nbe  much  more convenient if he would discuss  the\r\n\r\npoint in Committee, where there is opportunity  to\r\n\r\nspeak  more than once; otherwise, there  might  be\r\n\r\nconsiderable repetition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I agree with you, Sir. But I\r\n\r\nhave  brought it up because in the Second  Reading\r\n\r\nof the Bill, the Minister touched on this point. I\r\n\r\nwill,  however,  bring up this particular  subject\r\n\r\nwhen  the  clause is being discussed in Committee.\r\n\r\nBut  one  has the feeling, Sir, that in trying  to\r\n\r\nthrow  the  officership of trade  unions  open  to\r\n\r\npeople born in the Federation, it is just to  make\r\n\r\nthis law suit the needs of the P.A.P. Surely, Sir,\r\n\r\nin  legislating, the Government should always  pay\r\n\r\nattention to the needs of the country rather  than\r\n\r\nthe needs of the Party in power. But one comes  to\r\n\r\nthe  conclusion  that, because of this  particular\r\n\r\nclause  and of another clause, clause 30, against\r\n\r\nwhich  I will speak, all these things are done  to\r\n\r\nsuit the P.A.P. Sir, one cannot divorce one's mind\r\n\r\nfrom  the  fact that before the Second Reading  of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill, all steps have already been  taken  by\r\n\r\nP.A.P. trade union leaders to control the  Trades\r\n\r\nUnion  Congress. If one were to believe  what  one\r\n\r\nread in the newspapers, then one would come to the\r\n\r\nconclusion that there was great rejoicing  in  the\r\n\r\nminds of the Front Benchers of the Government when\r\n\r\nthey  were addressing a mass rally on May Day.  It\r\n\r\nwas  the  Minister for Labour and  Law  who  said,\r\n\r\n\"From now on, no trade union can exist, unless and\r\n\r\nuntil it is affiliated to the T.U.C.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no objection to insisting or\r\n\r\nrequiring that a registered trade union should  be\r\n\r\naffiliated to the T.U.C. That is taking the  right\r\n\r\nstep  to  encourage a healthy trade union movement\r\n\r\nand  to unify the movement. But to say that unless\r\n\r\nand  until  a  trade  union is affiliated  to  the\r\n\r\nT.U.C. it cannot be registered is just to say that\r\n\r\nthe   Government   is  prepared   to   allow   the\r\n\r\nadministration of this important part of  the  law\r\n\r\nto  be  given to the T.U.C. It will no  longer  be\r\n\r\npossible for the Registrar of Trade Unions to say,\r\n\r\n\"We register you\", or \"We cannot register you.\" It\r\n\r\nwill  just be left to the T.U.C. to say that.  The\r\n\r\nhands  of  the Registrar of Trade Unions  will  be\r\n\r\ntied.  Of  course,  I am sure the  Government  now\r\n\r\nfeels  that, because the T.U.C. is in the  control\r\n\r\nof  its Party members, it will not be difficult to\r\n\r\nuse  that  as an extra arm to choke any opposition\r\n\r\nfrom  trade  unions, which do  not  desire  to  be\r\n\r\naffiliated to the T.U.C. for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members will remember that not very long\r\n\r\nafter the P.A.P. came into power, the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour and Law said, \"We will do everything we can\r\n\r\nto  encourage the growth of national unions.\" That\r\n\r\nwas  said  about some 8 or 9 months ago, and  from\r\n\r\nwhat I can see, the encouragement of the growth of\r\n\r\nnational  unions  since then has been  a  failure.\r\n\r\nThere have been so few national unions formed.  In\r\n\r\nfact, there has been an attempt on the part of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to  start an amalgamated union  of  public\r\n\r\nemployees.  That is to say, a national  union  for\r\n\r\nall  public  employees. I do not think that  union\r\n\r\nhas made any headway, because many trade unions do\r\n\r\nnot and cannot have confidence in that amalgamated\r\n\r\nunion  of public employees in so far as it is  run\r\n\r\nand controlled by the Party in power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clause, Sir, in this particular Bill\r\n\r\nwhich says that it shall be an offence on the part\r\n\r\nof  an employer to encourage the establishment  of\r\n\r\nany  trade union and to encourage any trade  union\r\n\r\nleader  to  do  things which are inimical  to  the\r\n\r\ntrade  union  movement.

What  were  the  reasons?   The   past\r\n\r\nGovernment  encouraged  the  formation  of   trade\r\n\r\nunions  in factories to such an extent that  there\r\n\r\nexisted two or three trade unions in each factory.\r\n\r\nThe  purpose of these unions was to cause conflict\r\n\r\namong them and the workers themselves. That is how\r\n\r\nyellow unions came to be formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill said\r\n\r\nthat  the  T.U.C. was nothing but an  organisation\r\n\r\nmerely  to hoodwink the people in order to  obtain\r\n\r\npublicity.  But  we  have seen  how  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  made use of its henchmen to  help  the\r\n\r\nemployers  to  oppose genuine trade unions,  which\r\n\r\nwere fighting for the rights of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill that is before us\r\n\r\ntoday is a Bill, which is designed to protect  the\r\n\r\nworkers and the trade union movement in Singapore.\r\n\r\nWith the passing of this Bill, I am confident that\r\n\r\nthe  safety  of the people and of the trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement  in  Singapore will be ensured,  although\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  still feel uneasy.  However,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is determined to show, by  deeds,  its\r\n\r\nsincerity to the people and to the Opposition.

I am not particularly concerned with\r\n\r\nthe  rights  of the trade union movement  or  with\r\n\r\nmatters  concerning trade unionism  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nbut  I wish to speak in the interest of the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the object of this Bill is to consolidate the\r\n\r\ntrade  union movement and to protect and safeguard\r\n\r\nthe  interest of the workers, nobody can deny that\r\n\r\nthe  trade union movement in Singapore: should  be\r\n\r\nunified  in the interest of the workers.  However,\r\n\r\nthere has been marked dissatisfaction expressed by\r\n\r\ncertain sections of the trade union movement  with\r\n\r\nthe  attitude of certain trade union leaders whose\r\n\r\ntactics appear to indicate that they will make use\r\n\r\nof  the  power  at their disposal to coerce  every\r\n\r\ntrade  union  to  join  their  trade  union.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, if this kind of attitude is  adopted\r\n\r\nby the trade union leaders who are in power today,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  blame  some of  the  workers  who  are\r\n\r\nreluctant to take part in this unified trade union\r\n\r\nmovement. For example, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to\r\n\r\ndraw  the  attention of this House to  the  Sunday\r\n\r\nMail of 1st May:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In English): \"One of the leaders, Inche Buang\r\n\r\nbin   Omar  Junid,  P.A.P.

But, unfortunately, these\r\n\r\ntrade unions cannot voice their grievances for the\r\n\r\nreason  that  it  seems  that  in  the  State   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  there  are many forms  of  control  and\r\n\r\nthere  is coercion - not only in the field of trade\r\n\r\nunionism but also (we have seen the action of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment) in the field of education, and so  on.\r\n\r\nBut   we,   on  the  Opposition,  have  faith   in\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  The present Government is  a  majority\r\n\r\nGovernment  elected by the people. If  the  people\r\n\r\nare not happy with the present Government, I think\r\n\r\nthis  is  not  the  place to  oppose  it.  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment think it fit to consider and weigh  our\r\n\r\nviews  and amend their ways, they can withdraw  so\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore can be built up by people who  owe\r\n\r\ncomplete allegiance to the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another matter, Mr Speaker, Sir, to\r\n\r\nwhich  I  would like to draw attention.  We  still\r\n\r\nremember  the  tactics  employed  by  trade  union\r\n\r\nleaders five years ago in an attempt to bring  the\r\n\r\nworkers into their orbit. In the presence  of  the\r\n\r\nmasses,  they  are prepared to talk  about  making\r\n\r\nsacrifices, to thump the table, toss their caps in\r\n\r\nthe air, and make fiery speeches. If he is a Sikh,\r\n\r\nfor instance, he is prepared to shave his beard in\r\n\r\nthe  presence of the masses as though to  indicate\r\n\r\nthat  he is a genuine trade union leader.  But  as\r\n\r\nstated by the Member for Cairnhill, where are they\r\n\r\nheading  for?  Are  they  sincerely  leading   the\r\n\r\nworkers  of Singapore to prosperity? This  is  the\r\n\r\nquestion,  and this has been the cause of  concern\r\n\r\namong the masses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. Kandasamy (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, when the first Trade Unions Ordinance, indeed\r\n\r\nthe present Trade Unions Ordinance, was introduced\r\n\r\nin  this country in 1941, it was introduced  by  a\r\n\r\nColonial Government. The purpose and the desire of\r\n\r\nthat Government was to create only an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimpression that trade unionism was allowed in  the\r\n\r\nColony,  that  they could go to the  international\r\n\r\nforums,    like    the    International     Labour\r\n\r\nOrganisation,  and say, \"Yes, we  have  introduced\r\n\r\ntrade unionism.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a colonial Government, as everyone knows, is\r\n\r\nnothing   but   an   agent  or  an  administrative\r\n\r\nmachinery  for  the capitalists who exploited  our\r\n\r\ncountry. It was clearly and cleverly designed that\r\n\r\nthe  Trade Unions Ordinance would never  be  given\r\n\r\nthe opportunity for a strong, effective, organised\r\n\r\nand  disciplined movement to be created, but  that\r\n\r\nat  all  time we would have a trade union movement\r\n\r\nthat  was  splintered, weak and ineffective.  That\r\n\r\nwas  the  position, one might say, until September\r\n\r\n1959.   When   the  Trade  Unions  Ordinance   was\r\n\r\nintroduced, which made it possible for  any  seven\r\n\r\npersons to form a union, then right from the  word\r\n\r\ngo there was no possibility of creating a good and\r\n\r\nstrong  union. If any person was disaffected  with\r\n\r\ndemocratic decisions arrived at by a union, all he\r\n\r\nhad to do was to gather another six friends of his\r\n\r\nand   form  a  union.  When  that  was  done,  the\r\n\r\nemployers  were  not  very  slow  at  seizing  the\r\n\r\nopportunity before them. Thus we found racketeers,\r\n\r\nopportunists,    political    adventurers - everyone\r\n\r\njoining in the game and forming unions. Employers,\r\n\r\ntoo,  found it more profitable to have unions  led\r\n\r\nby  their  own agents and to make side deals  with\r\n\r\nthem than to negotiate with the genuine unions and\r\n\r\nreach agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the root of the riots which\r\n\r\ntook  place not long ago was inter union  rivalry.\r\n\r\nThere  was a company union - a yellow union - a  union\r\n\r\ndeliberately  created  by the  employers  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of destroying a good, genuine union, which\r\n\r\nhad  the  majority support of all the  workers  in\r\n\r\nthat industry. In that set-up, Sir, it was natural\r\n\r\nthat  Government  had no intention  whatsoever  of\r\n\r\ncreating  a  trade union centre or a Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress as we find it in other countries. Indeed,\r\n\r\nin  Singapore for a long time, before  the  Trades\r\n\r\nUnion  Congress  was registered  under  the  Trade\r\n\r\nUnion Ordinance, there was discussion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Government  and  the  trade   unions\r\n\r\nwhether the T.U.C. should be registered under  the\r\n\r\nSocieties  Ordinance  or under  the  Trade  Unions\r\n\r\nOrdinance.   Finally,  when  it  was  decided   to\r\n\r\nregister  it under the Trade Unions Ordinance, it\r\n\r\nwas  nothing more than another union. It  did  not\r\n\r\nhave   more  powers  than  any  other   union   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Among the 225 unions in Singapore, the\r\n\r\nT.U.C. was just another union. Not only  did  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  make and keep the T.U.C. so,  but  also\r\n\r\nthe  officials of the Ministry of Labour, and even\r\n\r\nthe  political  chiefs, kept the  T.U.C. in  that\r\n\r\nmanner.    I    remember,    Sir,    the    T.U.C.\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  being invited to discuss  certain\r\n\r\nlabour  problems.  At the same meeting  one  would\r\n\r\nfind  representatives of some unions  which  never\r\n\r\nhad  a membership of more than 200. How then could\r\n\r\nthe  T.U.C. claim to be speaking for all  labour,\r\n\r\nand  how  could the unions want to affiliate  with\r\n\r\nthe  T.U.C. when  they knew that they  themselves\r\n\r\ncould  represent all labour, depending on who  was\r\n\r\nthe political chief of the Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, previously we had trade union advisers who\r\n\r\nwere sent to our country to advise trade unions on\r\n\r\nhow  to  organise trade unions and how to  set  up\r\n\r\nrules. But no one needs trade union advisers  from\r\n\r\nanother country to come here and advise us on  how\r\n\r\nunions  should  be  set  up.  There  are  men   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  capable  of  organising  and   managing\r\n\r\nunions. But what was the role of those trade union\r\n\r\nadvisers?  Their  role was  nothing  but  to  kill\r\n\r\nmilitancy  and  to destroy any coordinated  action\r\n\r\namong the unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill touched on the\r\n\r\nsubject  of  the  T.U.C. and said that  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions  should affiliate with it. Yet in the  same\r\n\r\nbreath  he  said that affiliation  to  the  T.U.C.\r\n\r\nshould  not be made compulsory. As long as  it  is\r\n\r\npossible  for  unions to remain in Singapore,  get\r\n\r\nall  the benefits that the T.U.C. can provide, and\r\n\r\nyet  not  bear the responsibility for  that  work,\r\n\r\nthen  there will be unions who will not  affiliate\r\n\r\nnot  because  the members want it so, but  because\r\n\r\nthe  leaders want it so. The Member for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nalso touched upon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunions  being  created  by Government  the  T.U.C.\r\n\r\nbeing led by the Party men. As usual, Sir, he  has\r\n\r\nbeen  trying  his best not so much  to  put  facts\r\n\r\nbefore  this  House,  as  to  put  out  the  party\r\n\r\npropaganda line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 1959 there were 225 unions. Of this\r\n\r\nnumber,  over  60 unions were splinter  or  yellow\r\n\r\nunions.  Now, if these unions had been allowed  to\r\n\r\nexist,  we would have found ourselves no doubt  in\r\n\r\nthe  same  position as the people found themselves\r\n\r\nin  1956 and 1957. So rightly this Government  had\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance passed whereby splinter and  yellow\r\n\r\nunions can be de-registered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one aspect of the job of creating a\r\n\r\nunified  movement.  In  this  Bill,  it  has  been\r\n\r\nprovided that the number of persons who can form a\r\n\r\nunion  has been increased from 7 to 250. This  has\r\n\r\nbeen  deliberately done in order  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nunless  and  until  250 workmen  in  a  particular\r\n\r\ncategory  or occupation are desirous of forming  a\r\n\r\nunion, then no union should be registered. It also\r\n\r\naffords  the  possibility,  at  the  time  of  re-registration,  for  so  many  other  unions  whose\r\n\r\nmembership  is  now below 250 to be cancelled.  In\r\n\r\nthis  way, it will be possible to create  national\r\n\r\nunions,  unions which do not poach on each other's\r\n\r\nterritory,  unions  which will  have  a  specified\r\n\r\nindustry or organisation or craft from which  they\r\n\r\ncan recruit members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade union movement has been classified\r\n\r\ninto  19  industrial groups, and the unions  which\r\n\r\nare  on  the register will be placed according  to\r\n\r\nthe  membership in each one of these  groups.  But\r\n\r\nthe  rules  for  federation and amalgamation  have\r\n\r\nbeen   simplified  particularly  the   rules   for\r\n\r\namalgamation, thus  showing  a  preference   for\r\n\r\namalgamation of unions within each category.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 specifically makes it difficult for\r\n\r\nthe   re-registration  of  smaller   unions,   and\r\n\r\nprevents  the  creation  of  splinter  and  yellow\r\n\r\nunions.   Together   with  clause   7,   and   the\r\n\r\namalgamation  clauses,  it  will  be  possible  to\r\n\r\neffect  amalgamation within the several unions  in\r\n\r\neach category. And we hope that in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  not  too distant future we will have only  19\r\n\r\nunions  representing all the workers in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis,  I  am sure, will make it possible  for  the\r\n\r\nprevention of rivalry between unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many unions made representations to the\r\n\r\nRendel Constitution Commission on the position  of\r\n\r\ntrade  unions in our country, and the question  of\r\n\r\npermitting trade unions to set up political funds.\r\n\r\nI  was  a member of the delegation, together  with\r\n\r\nthe  present Minister for Labour and Law  and  the\r\n\r\npresent  Minister for Finance, which  presented  a\r\n\r\ncase  for a trade union political fund. Though  we\r\n\r\ntried to show that trade unions all over the world\r\n\r\nhad  the  right to set up political funds and  use\r\n\r\nsuch  funds  in  the interest of  the  workers  in\r\n\r\npromoting  legislation, and publishing  literature\r\n\r\nof a political nature, we were not successful with\r\n\r\nour  case.  We are, therefore, happy to note  that\r\n\r\nthis Government has now made it possible to set up\r\n\r\npolitical funds. When all this is done,  when  all\r\n\r\nthese  splinter and yellow unions have been  taken\r\n\r\noff  the register, there will still be some unions\r\n\r\nwhose  constitution is so cunningly  devised  that\r\n\r\nthe  rank  and file can at no time, even  if  they\r\n\r\ndislike  and disapprove of the leadership,  remove\r\n\r\ntheir  leadership.  It  is,  I  think,  the   most\r\n\r\nimportant thing in a trade union that the rank and\r\n\r\nfile  members should at all times have  the  right\r\n\r\nand  the  means to change the leadership  whenever\r\n\r\nthat leadership is not working in the interest  of\r\n\r\nthe  members.  But there are unions  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwhose  constitution does not provide  such  means.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  in this Bill when mention is  made  of\r\n\r\nthe  growth of a democratic trade union  movement,\r\n\r\nit simply means that the workers - the rank and file\r\n\r\nmembers - should have adequate representation at all\r\n\r\nlevels. Unfortunately, Sir, the unions which  have\r\n\r\nthe  type  of constitution which I have  mentioned\r\n\r\nare led by aliens, by men who are not citizens  of\r\n\r\nthis  country and who do not owe loyalty  to  this\r\n\r\ncountry;  but  the  members of  these  unions  are\r\n\r\npredominantly  citizens of our  country.  We  must\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that the trade union movement  at  all\r\n\r\ntimes is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the hands of our people, that it is led by the\r\n\r\npeople  of this country. Only then can we  have  a\r\n\r\ntrade  union  movement that is  conscious  of  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill said that the\r\n\r\nGovernment created a national union for Government\r\n\r\nworkers   and   he   mentioned  specifically   the\r\n\r\nAmalgamated Union of Public Employees. I  want  to\r\n\r\nmake it clear, Sir, that Government did not create\r\n\r\nthis   Union.  This  Union  was  created  by   the\r\n\r\namalgamation at the first stage of two unions  and\r\n\r\nat  a subsequent stage 10 other unions amalgamated\r\n\r\nand  created  the A.U.P.E. There  were  39  unions\r\n\r\nserving  Government  and City Council  workers  in\r\n\r\nSeptember  1959.  Today, Sir, there  are  only  25\r\n\r\nunions   on  the  register,  together   with   the\r\n\r\nAmalgamated Union of Public Employees, which  goes\r\n\r\nto  show  that  a  large  number  of  unions  have\r\n\r\namalgamated  one  way  or another  to  create  the\r\n\r\nAmalgamated Union of Public Employees. Today,  the\r\n\r\nmembership of this Union is over 8,000. The  total\r\n\r\nmembership   of  those  unions  which   have   not\r\n\r\namalgamated  does  not reach 8,000.  How  can  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill say that A.U.P.E. has failed?\r\n\r\nThat  this  Union, supposedly created, as  he  has\r\n\r\nclaimed, by Government, has failed when it  has  a\r\n\r\ntotal membership exceeding the total membership of\r\n\r\nthe other unions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to say something more in\r\n\r\nconnection  with the Amalgamated Union  of  Public\r\n\r\nEmployees.  This Union has claimed recognition  on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of  three groups of workers in  Government\r\n\r\nand  the  City  Council, and it is the  Government\r\n\r\nwith  whom we are negotiating for recognition.  We\r\n\r\nhave   not   yet   succeeded   in   getting   that\r\n\r\nrecognition.   If  this  Union  was   created   by\r\n\r\nGovernment, then it would be the easiest thing for\r\n\r\nGovernment to grant recognition to all  grades  of\r\n\r\nGovernment and City Council workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill and the Member for the\r\n\r\nSouthern  Islands  touched upon  May  Day.  I  can\r\n\r\nunderstand   the  feelings  of  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill,  Sir.  May Day 1960 will  stay  in  the\r\n\r\nmemory of all workers - maybe it will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstay  in  the memory of Members of the  Opposition\r\n\r\ntoo - because  never in the history of  our  country\r\n\r\ndid so many workers, as one newspaper put it, over\r\n\r\n50,000  workers,  attended a May Day  rally.  This\r\n\r\nrally  was organised after the T.U.C. Constitution\r\n\r\nwas adopted at the delegates' conference and after\r\n\r\nthe  officials  of  the  T.U.C. were  elected - not\r\n\r\nbefore, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I had known and I am sure if the officials of\r\n\r\nthe   T.U.C. had  known,  that  Members  of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  were  so much interested  in  May  Day\r\n\r\nrallies,  then we would have made it possible  for\r\n\r\nthem  to attend and thereby experience the spirit,\r\n\r\nthe  sense of loyalty, the sense of unity that was\r\n\r\ndisplayed at the rally. We might think about it in\r\n\r\nany  case  for  the next rally. Sir,  over  50,000\r\n\r\nworkers have endorsed the T.U.C. Constitution  and\r\n\r\nhave  given  support  to  the  new  officials.  It\r\n\r\nhappens that some of the officials are members  of\r\n\r\nthe   People's  Action  Party.  If  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nPeople's  Alliance  had trade unionists  who  were\r\n\r\nhonest, dedicated and hard-working I am sure  that\r\n\r\ntoday  in the T.U.C. we might have found  some  of\r\n\r\nthem. But, unfortunately, they did not produce any\r\n\r\nman of that calibre. If it is the P.A.P. which has\r\n\r\nthe  trade union leaders, and if it is the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ntrade  unionists who have the overwhelming support\r\n\r\nof  the  workers,  it is not  the  fault  of  this\r\n\r\nGovernment at all. Leaders are elected as  to  how\r\n\r\nthe workers want it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for the Southern Islands touched\r\n\r\nupon compulsory membership of unions. I would like\r\n\r\nto  state here that we must correct the old  state\r\n\r\nof  affairs where 100 workers became members of  a\r\n\r\nunion and 300 workers remained outside and yet  at\r\n\r\nthe same time enjoyed the benefits of what the 100\r\n\r\nworkers  had fought for and never had to  shoulder\r\n\r\ntheir   responsibility.  The  trade  unions   must\r\n\r\ncorrect  that state of affairs. But membership  of\r\n\r\ntrade unions will not be compulsory. But I am sure\r\n\r\nthe  trade  unions will make use of the Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations   Ordinance  whereby   awards   by   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Arbitration Court will be made only  to\r\n\r\nmembers of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  unions.  I  am sure that if negotiations  are\r\n\r\nconcluded along those lines, then workers who  are\r\n\r\nnow  not  member of trade unions and who  see  the\r\n\r\nbenefits which will accrue to them if they  become\r\n\r\nmembers  of  trade unions will no doubt  join  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions. But it will be wrong  to  say  that\r\n\r\nanyone  in the trade union movement will compel  a\r\n\r\nmember  or worker to become a member of the  trade\r\n\r\nunion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Industrial Relations Ordinance has\r\n\r\nimposed  certain  responsibilities  on  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement. It takes the trade union movement\r\n\r\nand   employer  away  from  the  situation   which\r\n\r\nprevailed  many years ago and brings them  to  the\r\n\r\npoint  where  collective  bargaining,  negotation,\r\n\r\nconciliation, or arbitration, should be  the  mode\r\n\r\nof  the day. If the unions' aspirations are to  be\r\n\r\nmet  successfully, then the unions must  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to be able to present facts and  figures\r\n\r\nto  the  Industrial Arbitration Court and, on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of sound reasoning, to get fair awards.  In\r\n\r\norder to do this, it will not be possible for  any\r\n\r\nsingle  union to organise, for instance,  research\r\n\r\nfacilities  in  Singapore  to  organise   workers'\r\n\r\neducation  in  order to educate  the  workers,  to\r\n\r\nunderstand    the   arbitration   machinery,    to\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  conciliation  machinery,  or   to\r\n\r\nunderstand collective bargaining. This, therefore,\r\n\r\nwill  have  to be the responsibility of  a  Trades\r\n\r\nUnion  Congress. If the Trades Union  Congress  is\r\n\r\nweak, if it is just one out of many unions, if  it\r\n\r\nhas  only about 30 unions out of 100 unions,  then\r\n\r\nit  will  not  have  the  means  to  provide  such\r\n\r\nfacilities,  nor will it be able  to  present,  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of labour, any cohesive policy at all.  But\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace with justice, if it is  to  have\r\n\r\nmeaning  and hopes of realisation, it is necessary\r\n\r\nthat   there  should  be  a  certain   amount   of\r\n\r\ndiscipline  within  the movement.  The  discipline\r\n\r\nshould  be  a discipline within the movement.  The\r\n\r\ndiscipline  should  not be a  discipline  that  is\r\n\r\nimposed  but  it  should be a discipline  that  is\r\n\r\ncreated  within the movement and accepted  by  all\r\n\r\nunions  and workers alike. This is very  important\r\n\r\nif  industrial  stability is to be maintained.  We\r\n\r\nhope,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,   that   the  new  T.U.C.,   with   its   new\r\n\r\nconstitution  and  with this Bill  that  makes  it\r\n\r\npossible  for  all  unions to affiliate  with  the\r\n\r\nT.U.C.,   will   have   the  resources   and   the\r\n\r\norganisation not only to perform the  services  so\r\n\r\nessential but also to maintain discipline that  is\r\n\r\nso  essential for our country and the  economy  of\r\n\r\nthis country.

Then they can elect the ten tall men. But now\r\n\r\nthe ten tall men have been elected for five years.\r\n\r\nIf  there is going to be one association of  trade\r\n\r\nunions,  with  all the top men already  appointed,\r\n\r\nwhat  inducement is there for others who  are  not\r\n\r\nalready in the bus to come in?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> They missed it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, several trade unions\r\n\r\nhave  sent  in  representations  complaining  that\r\n\r\nalthough  they have got a membership of more  than\r\n\r\n250  (one  has  got a membership of  over  1,500),\r\n\r\ntheir  registration has been cancelled or has  not\r\n\r\nyet  been approved.

It  has   already\r\n\r\nhappened,  Sir. A registered trade  union  applied\r\n\r\nfor affiliation to the T.U.C. one month ago and no\r\n\r\napproval has so far been given. Is the running of\r\n\r\nthe Department of the Registrar of Trade Union  to\r\n\r\nbe  left  in the hands of the T.U.C.,  or  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment now going to say that the T.U.C. is  a\r\n\r\nbranch of the Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, nobody has ever\r\n\r\nsaid that the T.U.C. is a branch or an arm of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. All this is complete nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are realists. We know what\r\n\r\nwent  on before and we are determined to see  that\r\n\r\nthe  people who played this dirty game will never\r\n\r\nbe  allowed  to  play it again. We are  determined\r\n\r\nthat  before any trade union is registered in  our\r\n\r\nMinistry it has a clean name, and it can get  that\r\n\r\nclean  name  only  when it  is  affiliated  to  an\r\n\r\nassociation of trade unions that is exempted  from\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of this Bill. Otherwise, what will\r\n\r\nhappen  is  this.  These unions  will  be  on  the\r\n\r\nregister  and they will seek affiliation.  And  if\r\n\r\nthey  cannot get affiliation, they will carry  on.\r\n\r\nYou  will then get a split leadership in the trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement.

Or, shall  we  say,  an\r\n\r\napproval could just be given in writing  to  that\r\n\r\neffect  and  when the affiliation  actually  takes\r\n\r\nplace, then the certificate of registration may be\r\n\r\nissued.

The  Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill has said that we are trying to turn\r\n\r\nthe  T.U.C. into another arm of the  P.A.P.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  in the case here, we  have  shown\r\n\r\nthat we are liberal-minded, but nevertheless,  we\r\n\r\nare  still  accused. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we  have\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  shown  in  this  House  that  we  are\r\n\r\nrealists. We look at the situation as we know  it\r\n\r\ntoday. Who are in the trade union movement? There\r\n\r\nare  people  who  are aliens. As  my  friend  and\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the  Member for  Kampong  Kapor,  has\r\n\r\nsaid, there are many people who are aliens in the\r\n\r\ntrade union movement. They may be aliens - some  of\r\n\r\nthem  do  not  owe any loyalty to the country - but\r\n\r\nthey  are  nevertheless in the movement.  Now  we\r\n\r\nhave  been very rational in our approach to  this\r\n\r\nproblem.  We  make  a  distinction  between   the\r\n\r\nofficers   of   the  union  and   the   executive\r\n\r\ncommittee. We say that it is very necessary  that\r\n\r\npeople  with  their roots in this country  should\r\n\r\nqualify to become officers in any trade union.  A\r\n\r\nperson  who is born in the Federation  of  Malaya\r\n\r\nmay   not   be   a  citizen  of  Singapore,   but\r\n\r\nnevertheless  he  has his roots  firmly  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry. We say that he should qualify to  be  an\r\n\r\nofficer in a trade union equally with the citizen\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. We have given a definition to  the\r\n\r\nterm  \"officer\". It means the main  officials  of\r\n\r\nany executive committee, such as the president or\r\n\r\nchairman,  the  vice-president or  vice-chairman,\r\n\r\nthe   treasurer,  the  secretary,  the  assistant\r\n\r\ntreasurer,  the  assistant  secretary,  the  paid\r\n\r\nofficials  in  those  categories  such  as   paid\r\n\r\nsecretaries   or   assistant  secretaries,   paid\r\n\r\ntreasurers or assistant treasurers. Those are the\r\n\r\npeople who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nqualify  to  be  officers. Now  in  the  executive\r\n\r\ncommittee  itself, there might be people  who  are\r\n\r\naliens  who  are  not citizens of Singapore.  They\r\n\r\ncould serve on the executive committee. We are not\r\n\r\nunreasonable and say, \"Get out of it now. We  want\r\n\r\neverybody  who is a citizen to be on the executive\r\n\r\ncommittee  of  the  union.\" That  is  being  very\r\n\r\nunfair.

But we approach the problem\r\n\r\nin a practical way. We do it step by step. When we\r\n\r\nwant to do things step by step, we are accused  of\r\n\r\nbeing   undemocratic.

People who are born  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya  could  become  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   with  just  a  period  of  two   years'\r\n\r\nresidence   here.  People  who  are  born   outside\r\n\r\nCommonwealth countries will have to have  a  longer\r\n\r\nresidential  qualification. But most of  them  have\r\n\r\nalready  become  citizens of Singapore.  Those  who\r\n\r\nhave  not become Singapore citizens are only a very\r\n\r\nfew.  They  have  not  `become  Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\nbecause  they do not wish to, or because they  have\r\n\r\nnot  got  their residential qualification to  apply\r\n\r\nfor citizenship. Surely, Sir, if we really want  to\r\n\r\ngive  a  meaning  to Singapore citizenship,  if  we\r\n\r\nreally  want to see to it that the running of  this\r\n\r\ncountry  is  left in the hands of  people  who  are\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore, then let us face facts.  Let\r\n\r\nus  say - it should be so - that before you can become\r\n\r\nan  officer or a member of the executive of a trade\r\n\r\nunion, you must be a citizen of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fact that it is open to people who are\r\n\r\nborn  in  the  Federation who have not  yet  become\r\n\r\ncitizens  of Singapore would make one come  to  the\r\n\r\nconclusion that because some of the ten tall\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmen in the T.U.C. are not yet citizens of\r\n\r\nSingapore, this provision in the Bill is therefore\r\n\r\nmade just for them and for the Government of the\r\n\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I have just heard a\r\n\r\nsubmission from an irresponsible person that Bills\r\n\r\nare  drafted  to  fit in with  the  desires  of  a\r\n\r\npolitical party We are responsible people here.

The words used here are that  two  or\r\n\r\nmore  unions can amalgamate and become  one  trade\r\n\r\nunion  with or without dissolution or division  of\r\n\r\nthe  funds  of  such trade unions.

What  the  Minister   is\r\n\r\nattempting  to  do  is  to  read  \"dissolution  or\r\n\r\ndivision  of  the  funds\"  as  one,  which   makes\r\n\r\ncomplete nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very clear.\r\n\r\nThe  words  used are, \"Any two or more  registered\r\n\r\ntrade  unions within one of the categories .  .  .\r\n\r\nmay  become  amalgamated as one trade  union\".  If\r\n\r\nthey  are  amalgamated as one  trade  union,  they\r\n\r\ncannot  keep  their own identities. How  can  they\r\n\r\nkeep  their  own identities?

It  is  as\r\n\r\nsimple  as all that, Mr Speaker. \"With or without\r\n\r\ndissolution or division\" relates to the  funds  of\r\n\r\nthe  unions  and  not  to the  identities  of  the\r\n\r\nunions, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the only course I can suggest to\r\n\r\nthe Minister, if he is going to dissolve the\r\n\r\nfunds, is to put it in nitric acid or burn it up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> If that is what you want, you can\r\n\r\nhave it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 39 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 40 to 48 inclusive ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 49-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 23, line 25, after \"deposited,\", to\r\n\r\ninsert \"to\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to correct a grammatical mistake, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 49, as amended, ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 50-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is a typographical\r\n\r\nemendation - in page 24, line 32, \"trustee\" to read\r\n\r\n\"trustees\".
