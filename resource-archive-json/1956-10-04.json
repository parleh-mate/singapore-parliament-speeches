I cannot\r\n\r\nthink that hon. Members need to be convinced of  the\r\n\r\nneed for legislation to protect shop assistants.  As\r\n\r\na  class of worker, they have never been very  vocal\r\n\r\nin  demanding this or that. Nevertheless, Sir, since\r\n\r\nassuming  office  as  Minister for  Labour,  I  have\r\n\r\nreceived  a  steady  stream  of  letters  from  shop\r\n\r\nassistants  outlining  their grievances  and  asking\r\n\r\nthat  some sort of protective legislation be devised\r\n\r\nto  assist  them.  These  grievances,  Sir,  can  be\r\n\r\nsummarised  very  simply: that  their  contracts  of\r\n\r\nservice  are  so vague that they never know  exactly\r\n\r\nwhat   rights  they  have  under  them;  that  their\r\n\r\nemployers make all sorts of deductions from their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsalaries,  especially when they wish to  resign  and\r\n\r\nthey have asked that their wages be settled in full;\r\n\r\nthat  their  wages are seldom paid  regularly;  that\r\n\r\ntheir  hours of work are too long; and that holidays\r\n\r\nor  sick  leave are grudgingly given. And they  have\r\n\r\nasked  particularly, Sir, that they should be  given\r\n\r\nthe  right to have their complaints settled  in  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Court. All these grievances will be  removed\r\n\r\nwhen the Bill before this House becomes law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to include\r\n\r\nearlier legislation for shop assistants, namely, the\r\n\r\nWeekly  Holidays Ordinance and the  Seats  for  Shop\r\n\r\nAssistants Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is Government's intention to commit this\r\n\r\nBill  to  a  Select Committee and any comments  that\r\n\r\nhon.  Members may have on this Bill will, of course,\r\n\r\nbe  fully  considered by the Select  Committee  when\r\n\r\nappointed. Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure this Charter\r\n\r\nof  Rights  for shop assistants will be hailed  with\r\n\r\nsatisfaction by shop assistants all over  Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  is  common knowledge, Sir, that shop  assistants\r\n\r\nare  being made to work at present from anything  up\r\n\r\nto 9 to 12 hours a day; in some cases up to 13 hours\r\n\r\na  day.  Consequently they get very little time  off\r\n\r\nfor  healthy  recreation or relaxation.  This  Bill,\r\n\r\nSir,  seeks  to  limit  the working  hours  of  shop\r\n\r\nassistants to 8 or, in certain cases, to 9  hours  a\r\n\r\nday  at contracted wages, and the maximum fixed  per\r\n\r\nweek is 44 hours in normal cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill also seeks to uplift the status of\r\n\r\nshop  assistants  in Singapore  from  that  of  mere\r\n\r\nmachines, used for profit earning for employers,  to\r\n\r\nthat of human beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, as also the Clerks Employment Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  had  its  Second Reading yesterday,  goes  to\r\n\r\nprove that the Labour Front Coalition Government  is\r\n\r\ncontinuously  seeking  to  better  the  lot  of  the\r\n\r\nworking   class,  and  no  matter  what  amount   of\r\n\r\npropaganda  is  made  by  certain  Members  of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition who seek\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  set  themselves up as champions of  the  working\r\n\r\nclass, I am sure this fact will not go into hiding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have\r\n\r\nonly two points I wish to make. The first refers  to\r\n\r\nclause 37 (1)  on the subject of an additional  half-day   holiday  for  shop  assistants,  theatre   and\r\n\r\nrestaurant  employees. There is often a considerable\r\n\r\ndifference  between  the hours of  working  of  shop\r\n\r\nassistants and restaurant employees, the latter,  in\r\n\r\nsome  cases, working either wholly or mainly in  the\r\n\r\nevenings. In this sub-clause, therefore, in  line  3\r\n\r\non page 11 of the Bill the words,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"every shop assistant employed therein shall be\r\n\r\nallowed  in each week an additional holiday  of  one\r\n\r\nhalf-day commencing at such hour in the afternoon as\r\n\r\nmay be fixed by the Minister\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>may  mean,  unless the words \"in the afternoon\"  are\r\n\r\nomitted,  that  some restaurant employees  will  get\r\n\r\nanother  full  day's holiday per week instead  of  a\r\n\r\nhalf  holiday, which I do not think is the intention\r\n\r\nof this Bill. This is a matter which will have to be\r\n\r\nlooked into further in Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I must draw the attention of the\r\n\r\nMinister  once again to clauses 48 to  50  regarding\r\n\r\nthe  very wide powers given to inspectors. Yesterday\r\n\r\nI  questioned, in respect of similar clauses in  the\r\n\r\nClerks  Employment Bill, the need in  clause  48  to\r\n\r\n\"enter  without previous notice at any hour  of  the\r\n\r\nday  or  night  any  place where he  has  reason  to\r\n\r\nbelieve any shop assistant is employed\". And I  also\r\n\r\nqueried  the omission in clause 50 (a)  of a  proviso\r\n\r\nto  be  found in section 9 (2)  of the present Weekly\r\n\r\nHolidays   Ordinance  that  \"no  person   shall   be\r\n\r\ncompellable to answer any question if the answer may\r\n\r\ntend directly or indirectly to incriminate\". Sir,  I\r\n\r\nasked  the  Hon. the Chief Minister to  justify  the\r\n\r\nvery  wide  powers  being given  to  inspectors  and\r\n\r\nyesterday he omitted to give me a reply. I hope that\r\n\r\nhe will do so today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

My motion now seeks to extend\r\n\r\nthe  continuance  of this Ordinance  for  a  further\r\n\r\nperiod  of  one  year as from the 8th  of  December,\r\n\r\n1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Ordinance gives the Minister for Commerce and\r\n\r\nIndustry  powers  to  make  orders  prohibiting  the\r\n\r\nimport  and export of goods. However, let me  assure\r\n\r\nMembers that, in keeping with our free trade policy,\r\n\r\nthese powers are used very sparingly, and except for\r\n\r\na  comparatively  narrow  field,  most  imports  are\r\n\r\nplaced  on the open general licence and exports  are\r\n\r\nfreely  licensed.  The powers of  control,  however,\r\n\r\ncome in useful in regulating imports for balance  of\r\n\r\npayment   reasons,  especially  from   hard-currency\r\n\r\nareas,  but here again all essential and many  semi-essential goods are licensed freely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These powers also provide a useful check for\r\n\r\npurposes  of disease control in connection with  the\r\n\r\nimport of plants, animals and meats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members  will recall that these  powers  were\r\n\r\nused a few months ago to prohibit the importation of\r\n\r\npin-tables and similar amusement machines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the export field the powers under this\r\n\r\nOrdinance are used to keep a check on the export  of\r\n\r\nstrategic  materials and essential  items  in  short\r\n\r\nsupply in Singapore. At present, controls on exports\r\n\r\nare  very  few in number. It is, however,  necessary\r\n\r\nfor the Minister to have such powers of control, and\r\n\r\nthe  Trade  Advisory Council agrees with this  view.\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> I second it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

A trade mission  has  left\r\n\r\nfor China from Singapore and the Federation, and has\r\n\r\nconcluded  deals in rubber for export to  China.  If\r\n\r\nthe  report  in the Press is correct - that Government\r\n\r\nrequires  a  guarantee from the exporter  that  this\r\n\r\nrubber will not be used for war purposes - how is  the\r\n\r\nexporter to know how that commodity will be used  in\r\n\r\nChina? It is impossible for an exporter here to give\r\n\r\nany guarantee or surety. On the other hand, Sir, all\r\n\r\nthese  years  rubber has been exported  through  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom to Russia. Then why is this guarantee\r\n\r\nrequired from exporters that the rubber exported  to\r\n\r\nChina  will not be used for war purposes? As I  have\r\n\r\nsaid, it is impossible for exporters to know to what\r\n\r\nuses  the  rubber will be put. I hope the Government\r\n\r\nwill  not  try and put obstacles in the  export  and\r\n\r\nimport trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M.

Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nTelok  Ayer says that he will not oppose this motion\r\n\r\nbecause  I have said that these powers will be  used\r\n\r\nsparingly and with the advice of the Trade  Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil.  Sir, that is not correct. I have not  said\r\n\r\nthat  these powers will be used with the  advice  of\r\n\r\nthe  Trade  Advisory  Council. The  discretion  lies\r\n\r\nsolely  with  the Minister, Sir, and no Minister  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  give  up that discretion  if  he  has  to\r\n\r\nexercise it for the benefit of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I should like to refer the hon.\r\n\r\nMember to section 4 (2)  of the Ordinance which says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Any order made by the Minister under this section\r\n\r\nshall  as soon as possible after the making  thereof\r\n\r\nbe  laid before the Legislative Assembly and  if  at\r\n\r\nthe  next meeting of the Legislative Assembly  after\r\n\r\nthe  order is laid before it a resolution is  passed\r\n\r\nannulling  the order or any part thereof  the  whole\r\n\r\norder  or such part thereof as the case may be shall\r\n\r\nthenceforth  be  void but without prejudice  to  the\r\n\r\nvalidity of anything previously done thereunder.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, Sir, any hon.

Members will agree  that\r\n\r\nthis  Government can take a bit of credit for trying\r\n\r\nto  get  the ban on rubber exports to China removed.\r\n\r\nSir,  in keeping with the requirements of the United\r\n\r\nNations  Organisation, we have to get statements  as\r\n\r\nto  the end uses of the rubber that is being shipped\r\n\r\nto  China. It is not a guarantee, in the real  sense\r\n\r\nof  a guarantee, from a shipper. It is a requirement\r\n\r\nthat  the  shipper should give us the  name  of  the\r\n\r\nultimate  user and the purpose for which the  rubber\r\n\r\nis  going there. He need not specifically state that\r\n\r\nit  is going for tyre manufacture or something  like\r\n\r\nthat,  so  long as he states that it is going  there\r\n\r\nfor  a  purpose which is peaceful, and not connected\r\n\r\nwith the production of war materials and so on. Sir,\r\n\r\nit  is not a guarantee in the form that we hold  the\r\n\r\nshipper  responsible  for  the  guarantee,  but,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  if  it  is  found  that  the  shipper   has\r\n\r\npurposely  made a false declaration, then there  are\r\n\r\npenalties laid out in the Control of Imports and  Exports Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with subsection\r\n\r\n(2)   of  section  1 of the Control  of  Imports  and\r\n\r\nExports  Ordinance (Chapter 214), resolves that  the\r\n\r\naforesaid Ordinance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshall continue in force for a further period of  one\r\n\r\nyear commencing on the 8th day of December, 1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FORESHORE AND SEA-BED AT TANJONG RHU</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Reclamation)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I beg to move the motion standing  in\r\n\r\nmy name, namely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with section 4 of\r\n\r\nthe Foreshores Ordinance (Chapter 246), approves the\r\n\r\nreclamation  by  Messrs.

There has been the dissolution\r\n\r\nof  the Chinese Middle School Students Union and the\r\n\r\narrest  and  detention  under  the  Public  Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance  of  the President of the  Chinese  Middle\r\n\r\nSchool  Students Union and of an Executive Committee\r\n\r\nmember of the People's Action Party, who is also  an\r\n\r\nAssistant Secretary of the Shop and Factory  Workers\r\n\r\nUnion.  However,  the substance  of  this  challenge\r\n\r\nagainst the action of the Government is the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we debated the Governor's Address on 5th\r\n\r\nSeptember, and gave this Government a unanimous vote\r\n\r\nof  confidence because it was going to call an  All-Party  conference  to  plan  tactics  for  the  next\r\n\r\nMerdeka talks and to plan tactics in case the  talks\r\n\r\nfailed,  few  of us realised that, in  fact,  a  new\r\n\r\nphase had opened in the political life of Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  did  not know then that there had been a radical\r\n\r\nchange in the policy and methods of the Labour Front\r\n\r\nCoalition Government. The first sign of that radical\r\n\r\nchange  was the arrest, under banishment orders,  of\r\n\r\nsix  prominent trade union and civic leaders on 18th\r\n\r\nSeptember,  followed on the 19th by the  dissolution\r\n\r\nof the Women's Federation and the Chinese Brass Gong\r\n\r\nMusical Society. There was not the slightest pretext\r\n\r\nfor  any of these arbitrary acts. It came out of the\r\n\r\nblue. However, we gave the Government the benefit of\r\n\r\nthe doubt. Perhaps they might not have intended this\r\n\r\nas  an  act of provocation. But an emergency sitting\r\n\r\nof  the  Legislative Assembly asked for by my  Party\r\n\r\nwas  firmly refused. Before the next sitting of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly, the Government had moved again, this  time\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Chinese Middle School Students  Union,\r\n\r\nand  a  day  before the Assembly  was  due  to  sit,\r\n\r\nagainst  a  Committee member of the People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty.  We  might have doubted before whether  these\r\n\r\nacts  were  those of wild suppression or  calculated\r\n\r\nprovocation, but there is very little doubt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow  in  our  minds  as  to  what  the  Government's\r\n\r\nintentions  are.  It is clear that there  must  have\r\n\r\nbeen  months  of deliberate and calculated  planning\r\n\r\nfor this great purge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old phase ended when the former Chief Minister\r\n\r\ndeparted   for   Cathay,  seeking  inspiration   and\r\n\r\nknowledge   probably  to  return  with  tales   more\r\n\r\nwondrous  than  those  of  Marco  Polo.  After   his\r\n\r\nresignation on 7th June, the Chief Ministership  was\r\n\r\non  the 8th June taken over by the Member for  Havelock,  who  said that his was a caretaker government\r\n\r\nwhose  only function was to carry on till  the  next\r\n\r\nMerdeka talks. It is quite clear now that, from  the\r\n\r\ntime  the former Chief Minister left Singapore,  all\r\n\r\ntalk  of  the  caretaker nature of  this  Government\r\n\r\nceased. In fact, it culminated with a declaration in\r\n\r\nlast  month's debate that the Government was  not  a\r\n\r\ncaretaker  one. The Government had decided  that  it\r\n\r\nwas  going to take care of itself. Unable to compete\r\n\r\nwith  the  vigorous and militant movements that  the\r\n\r\nlast  general  elections had set into  motion,  they\r\n\r\nknew  that  they faced certain defeat  in  the  next\r\n\r\nelections.  They have no organisation,  no  core  of\r\n\r\nparty  workers  and  party cadres,  no  intellectual\r\n\r\ncontent  in their Party. At least let this  be  said\r\n\r\nfor  the  last Chief Minister: he believed that  all\r\n\r\nthese handicaps, and the lack of organisation, could\r\n\r\nbe   overcome  by  the  sheer  force  of  a  dynamic\r\n\r\npersonality, widely publicised, and that if  he  got\r\n\r\nMerdeka,  then he was confident he could beat  rival\r\n\r\norganisations.  Unfortunately,  he   did   not   get\r\n\r\nMerdeka, but it saved him the discomfiture of having\r\n\r\nthat illusion shattered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Chief Minister is a much more prosaic,\r\n\r\nmundane and matter-of-fact man. He is more like  his\r\n\r\nMinisters. He knew that this was not the way to win,\r\n\r\nand  that  even if he wanted to do it he could  not.\r\n\r\nBut he was a plotter. He could plan, and he took  us\r\n\r\nall for a ride! But to plot, you must have people to\r\n\r\nplot  with,  people  with the  sinews  to  give  you\r\n\r\nstrength  where you lack the strength. So inevitably\r\n\r\nthey became embroiled with their colonial masters as\r\n\r\nfellow conspirators to use the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstruments which their colonial masters had  forged\r\n\r\nover  the  years  to maintain their rule  over  this\r\n\r\ncolonial territory. But, of course, to conceal  this\r\n\r\nthey  boldly stepped forward in front. Once embarked\r\n\r\non  this  course of suppression, defeat at the  next\r\n\r\npolls  becomes an absolute certainty  instead  of  a\r\n\r\nmere  probability,  unless all  Opposition  rallying\r\n\r\npoints   are   destroyed  to  ensure  no   organised\r\n\r\nchallenge  at  the  next elections.  Having  already\r\n\r\nexposed their designs thus far, it was idle for them\r\n\r\nto  go back and pretend that they were just innocent\r\n\r\ngood Democrats led astray by the British. Theirs was\r\n\r\nan irrevocable decision, a decision which has set in\r\n\r\ntrain  events the end of which we may not  know  for\r\n\r\nsome  time.  But  with  all the  mass  meetings  and\r\n\r\nrallies  which are being held and in which they  are\r\n\r\nbeing denounced in no uncertain terms, and the  mass\r\n\r\nsignature campaigns and a few other methods of  mass\r\n\r\npublicity and education, they are being reduced from\r\n\r\n\"colonial stooges\" to \"running dogs\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Of course, if only a good  excuse\r\n\r\ncould  be  found, it might be possible to deal  with\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  trade  unions  organised  by  hostile\r\n\r\nmilitant groups. It might be too blatant an  act  at\r\n\r\nthis  moment  to move directly against the  People's\r\n\r\nAction Party and remove it from peaceful competition\r\n\r\nin  the next elections, particularly if it has  been\r\n\r\ncorrect,  constitutional and proper in its  actions.\r\n\r\nBut  take  away  all the supports,  all  the  ground\r\n\r\norganisations  that  sustain  the  People's   Action\r\n\r\nParty, and then you will have removed the sinews  of\r\n\r\nthe  Party. Then you might even allow that Party  to\r\n\r\ncompete and hobble along in the next elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are happy at this? I do not say that my hon.\r\n\r\nopponents  on  the  other  side  are  seeking  these\r\n\r\nallies, but they are getting these allies.

Member:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Hear, hear indeed! They were\r\n\r\nled  by  Mr  Chua Hoe Ann, the man  who  led  the\r\n\r\noverseas  Chinese delegation to Formosa to  pledge\r\n\r\nthe support of the overseas Chinese for Chiang Kai-shek  in  his fight to regain the Chinese mainland\r\n\r\nagainst the lawfully constituted Government of the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Republic of China. In a  P.R.O. release\r\n\r\ndated 2nd October, the Government was disingenuous\r\n\r\nenough  to publish a list of the 150 organisations\r\n\r\nwhich  this  15-man  delegation  was  supposed  to\r\n\r\nrepresent.  Amongst them - I do not  wish  to  smear\r\n\r\norganisations with one broad brush - there are  good\r\n\r\norganisations  like the Singapore  Bank  Employees\r\n\r\nUnion, for whom sometimes I acted as adviser,  and\r\n\r\nthe Army Civil Service Union, in which I have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  friends as officers. But let us look at  the\r\n\r\nmajority of these 150 organisations:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The O.C. Kindergarten. What is the O.C.\r\n\r\nKindergarten? Are all the little toddling  infants\r\n\r\nin this Kindergarten counted in the 150,000?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tong Tat Library. Is every person who reads\r\n\r\na  book   from this library accounted for in  the\r\n\r\n150,000?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The G.G. Association. What is it all about?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hwa Keow Jin Ai Sia, the Koon Teok Siah - a\r\n\r\nmotley  collection of semi-defunct  organisations.\r\n\r\nThe people have never heard of them before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by all means let us fight propaganda by\r\n\r\ncounter propaganda. That is part of the democratic\r\n\r\nprocess.  If  your  opponents  start  a  signature\r\n\r\ncampaign,  you start one. That is commendable.  If\r\n\r\nyour  opponents say they represent 50,000  people,\r\n\r\nyou  get  15 people to come and say they represent\r\n\r\n150,000.  But let us do it intelligently.  Let  us\r\n\r\nnot make a mockery and a farce of this thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the end of all this? Repression, Sir, is\r\n\r\na  habit  that grows. I am told it is like  making\r\n\r\nlove - it  is  always easier the  second  time!  The\r\n\r\nfirst  time  there may be pangs of  conscience,  a\r\n\r\nsense  of guilt. But once embarked on this course,\r\n\r\nwith  constant repetition, you get more  and  more\r\n\r\nbrazen  in  the  attack and in the  scope  of  the\r\n\r\nattack.  First, the conscience is disturbed  by  a\r\n\r\nsense  of  guilt. You attack only those whom  your\r\n\r\nSpecial  Branch can definitely say are Communists.\r\n\r\nThey  have no proof except what X told Z who  told\r\n\r\nAlpha  who told Beta who told the Special  Branch.\r\n\r\nThen you attack those whom your Special Branch say\r\n\r\nare  actively  sympathising with and  helping  the\r\n\r\nCommunists,  although  they  are  not   Communists\r\n\r\nthemselves.  Then  you  attack  those  whom   your\r\n\r\nSpecial   Branch  say,  although  they   are   not\r\n\r\nCommunists  or  fellow travellers, yet,  by  their\r\n\r\nintransigent opposition to any collaboration  with\r\n\r\ncolonialism, they encourage the spirit  of  revolt\r\n\r\nand  weaken  constituted  authority  and  thereby,\r\n\r\naccording  to the Special Branch, they are  aiding\r\n\r\nthe Communists. Then finally, since\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou  have  gone that far, you attack all  those  who\r\n\r\noppose you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repression is an easy substitute for hard work and\r\n\r\norganisation.  To compete with a rival organisation,\r\n\r\nyou  have  to win mass support, to help  the  people\r\n\r\nsolve  their  problems  of living.  But  instead  of\r\n\r\nbuilding up an organisation, it is much easier  just\r\n\r\nto  have  a  collection of friends  to  contest  the\r\n\r\nelections, with no organisation. Then, by  a  fluke,\r\n\r\nyou  may  find yourself in power. You take over  the\r\n\r\norganisation  of the colonial power, the  government\r\n\r\nmachinery,    the    instruments    of    policy - the\r\n\r\nadministration, the police, broadcasting and all the\r\n\r\n\"gimmicks\" of a modern colonial State. Then you  use\r\n\r\nthis  machinery with the connivance and  concurrence\r\n\r\nof    your    colonial   masters    against    rival\r\n\r\norganisations.  It  is easier than  building  up  an\r\n\r\norganisation of your own. All you have to do  is  to\r\n\r\ndissolve  organisations and societies and banish  or\r\n\r\ndetain the key political workers in these societies.\r\n\r\nThen   miraculously  everything  is   tranquil   and\r\n\r\nquiet - on  the surface. Then an intimidated Press - and\r\n\r\nsome   sections  of  the  Press  here  do  not  need\r\n\r\nintimidation   because  they  have   very   friendly\r\n\r\nowners - the Press and the Government-controlled radio\r\n\r\ntogether can regularly sing your praises and  slowly\r\n\r\nand  steadily the people are made to forget the evil\r\n\r\nthings  that  have already been done.  Or  if  these\r\n\r\nthings  are referred to again, they are conveniently\r\n\r\ndistorted,  and  distorted  with  impunity,  because\r\n\r\nthere will be no opposition to contradict it. It has\r\n\r\nhappened  before in Asia. It happened in  China  and\r\n\r\nIndo-China. First, you knock out your opponents  who\r\n\r\ncompete  with  you, peacefully and constitutionally,\r\n\r\nbecause  they are more vigorous, because you  cannot\r\n\r\ncompete with them, because they are better organised\r\n\r\nthan  you are. When everything becomes peaceful  and\r\n\r\ntranquil,  complacency  sets  in,  and  degeneration\r\n\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Front Organising Secretary went to the\r\n\r\ninaugural  ceremony of the Women's Federation  where\r\n\r\nhe  made a fighting speech. He said: \"We must  fight\r\n\r\nagainst  corruption, all forms  of  corruption,  not\r\n\r\njust   anti-yellow   culture.\"   He   termed   moral\r\n\r\ncorruption \"the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappeals of the fleshpots of life\". He said, \"We must\r\n\r\nfight   against   political   corruption.   Physical\r\n\r\ncorruption\",  he said, \"is a weapon  which  you  use\r\n\r\nagainst your opponent by threatening either his life\r\n\r\nor  the  liberty of his person.\" That, he said,  was\r\n\r\nundemocratic and bad. The Communists were the people\r\n\r\nwho  engaged  in such forms of physical  corruption,\r\n\r\nand  he  condemned them. He said also that  we  must\r\n\r\nfight  economic  corruption,  bribery  and  all  the\r\n\r\nrottenness of things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Indo-China and China, once they crushed the\r\n\r\nopen  stimulus, that challenge to them  to  increase\r\n\r\ntheir  efficiency,  they slumped and  slowly  became\r\n\r\ndecadent  and  corrupt. They went to seed.  Finally,\r\n\r\nthe  organisation on which they depended to maintain\r\n\r\nthemselves  in  power, the machinery of  government,\r\n\r\nalso  sank. By their example, the Civil Service went\r\n\r\nto  seed.  They  became corrupt and  degenerate.  No\r\n\r\ninitiative,  no  imagination.  Instead  of  becoming\r\n\r\ninstruments to implement the policies and solve  the\r\n\r\neconomic  and  social problems of the  people,  they\r\n\r\nbecame   instruments  of  petty  oppression.  Slowly\r\n\r\ncracks began to appear on the edifice of government,\r\n\r\nuntil  finally the whole structure collapsed as  the\r\n\r\nunderground    opposition,    which     had     been\r\n\r\nstrengthening,  rose up and struck  down  all  these\r\n\r\ninstitutions  which  the  people  had  regarded   as\r\n\r\ninstruments  of their oppression and had  recognised\r\n\r\nas  the  reason  for  their misery  and  misfortune.\r\n\r\nFinally  the whole world of these men in power  came\r\n\r\nto  an end, a dismal and a disgraceful end. Then  if\r\n\r\nthey  were unlucky, according to the American Press,\r\n\r\nthey  might get buried alive. Or they might get hung\r\n\r\nup  in some market place, where the people would  go\r\n\r\nand publicly curse them to their grave, egged on  by\r\n\r\nfanatical  party  tyrants. But if they  were  lucky,\r\n\r\nthen they fled to some convenient island. There,  if\r\n\r\nthey could win or retain the support of their former\r\n\r\nmasters and collaborators, like Chiang Kai-shek  and\r\n\r\nhis  cronies,  they could continue to  live  in  the\r\n\r\ncomfort and ease to which they had grown accustomed,\r\n\r\nsustained  and supported by the Americans and,  what\r\n\r\nis most important, protected by them and the Seventh\r\n\r\nFleet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish unduly to depress my opponents on\r\n\r\nthe  other  side of the House. They have  about  one\r\n\r\nchance in a million of success with this instrument.\r\n\r\nIf  they  could  suppress  with  the  fanatical  and\r\n\r\nreligious  belief that God and right  are  on  their\r\n\r\nside - just  as  we are told the Communists  sometimes\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  God and right are on their  side  and\r\n\r\nthey  suppress their opponents - then, with a  stifled\r\n\r\nOpposition,  they  could  perhaps  strengthen  their\r\n\r\norganisation and translate their political  theories\r\n\r\nand  beliefs  into action and give  the  people  the\r\n\r\nbetter  life  that they seek. But they can  only  do\r\n\r\nthis  if  they  have  a  core  of  men  of  ability,\r\n\r\nintegrity  and courage, men imbued with high  ideals\r\n\r\nand  convictions,  driving forward  with  relentless\r\n\r\nzeal and energy derived from their convictions. They\r\n\r\nneed  a  whole team of men who can methodically  and\r\n\r\nsystematically  plan to bring about your  prosperous\r\n\r\negalitarian   society.  Then  you  can   allow   the\r\n\r\nCommunists   to  come  back  and  compete   in   the\r\n\r\nelections, after you have strengthened yourself  and\r\n\r\nremoved your economic and social ills to that  point\r\n\r\nwhere  you feel fairly confident that you  have  the\r\n\r\npeople,  if  not on your side, at least not  against\r\n\r\nyou.  But  to  do this in Malaya, you will  have  to\r\n\r\nfight  and  subdue those groups and interests  which\r\n\r\nhave  come out to support you initially because they\r\n\r\nbelieve  you  have come out to protect their  vested\r\n\r\ninterests - all your Chambers of Commerce.

I may be wrong, too, about my hon.\r\n\r\nopponents on the other side of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps they are men of ability and integrity,  with\r\n\r\nthe  courage of their convictions and tireless  zeal\r\n\r\nborn  of  these convictions. I was glad to hear  the\r\n\r\nother  day  that  some  have  even  taken  to  youth\r\n\r\nleadership  instead of lounging in hotel  bars!  But\r\n\r\nthat  is  not a sufficient basis to start  a  social\r\n\r\nrevolution. There is a revolution on in  Malaya  and\r\n\r\nthere are two ways to meet it. The first, is to meet\r\n\r\nit  militarily  and  suppress it  by  force - and  the\r\n\r\nBritish  have  been doing it for  eight  years.  The\r\n\r\nsecond  is to control and regulate it. If the  other\r\n\r\nside  is  prepared to compete and put forward  their\r\n\r\nideas  and theories in a peaceful and constitutional\r\n\r\nmanner, then they would give you the impetus to  put\r\n\r\nyour house in order, to compete. And if you fail and\r\n\r\nthey succeed, because they are better organised  and\r\n\r\nhave  worked better, then you have only yourself  to\r\n\r\nblame  if  you lose, provided, as I have said,  they\r\n\r\nfight  in a peaceful and constitutional manner.  But\r\n\r\nout  of  the blue the Government has moved to strike\r\n\r\nthem down. It is the road to perdition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am asking the House to do is formally to\r\n\r\ndeplore these arbitrary actions. But this motion  in\r\n\r\nsubstance  is  a  condemnation  of  the  policy   of\r\n\r\nsuppression on which this Government has embarked, a\r\n\r\npolicy  of suppression without any pretext, done  so\r\n\r\nblatantly  and so crudely that they will  lose  even\r\n\r\nthe  Social Democrats to the other side,  that  they\r\n\r\nwill  lose the intellectuals to the other side. They\r\n\r\nwill  lose the people with a conscience and  with  a\r\n\r\nsense of fair play and decency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what the result of these moves will\r\n\r\nbe  in  the immediate future. That depends upon  the\r\n\r\nplans  of  the  Council of Ministers, or  perhaps  a\r\n\r\nfaction  of the Council of Ministers. But I do  know\r\n\r\nthat if this policy of indiscriminate suppression is\r\n\r\npursued, the ultimate result perhaps in 8 years,  or\r\n\r\nperhaps  in  10  years if that long, is  a  foregone\r\n\r\nconclusion. It has happened before in Asia and it is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  happen  here again unless  we  learn  the\r\n\r\nlesson from what has happened elsewhere in Asia. How\r\n\r\nlong  can  you depend on the support of  those  whom\r\n\r\neventually you must fight, because your economic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterests  conflict with theirs? How  long  can  you\r\n\r\nkeep  bottled up a sense of grievance and discontent\r\n\r\nbecause  of social and economic injustices?  If  the\r\n\r\none  chance in a million works out, then no man will\r\n\r\ncheer this Government more than I will. Perhaps,  in\r\n\r\nfact, they have a sense of mission in life, and  all\r\n\r\nthese  things  are done in the belief that  God  and\r\n\r\nright  are  on their side, that they are  doing  bad\r\n\r\nthings for a good cause, that, eventually, they will\r\n\r\ndo good things for a good cause when conditions have\r\n\r\nbeen put right. But as I see it, bad things for some\r\n\r\nbogus  good  cause will lead to more bad things  for\r\n\r\neven  worse causes, until slowly the whole structure\r\n\r\nof this society will crumble into dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask my hon. opponents on the other side to\r\n\r\nweigh  the odds carefully, and not follow  what  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Branch tells them, because they are  police\r\n\r\nexperts,  they are the Sherlock Holmes who  pick  up\r\n\r\nthe   threads   and  build  up  their  theories   of\r\n\r\nsubversive  activity. Many of them do not understand\r\n\r\nwhat  this  is about. I am not saying  that  if  one\r\n\r\nunderstands  it, then one necessarily  has  all  the\r\n\r\nanswers to it. But one is more likely to be able  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the problem in the right way. This is a  fight\r\n\r\nin  Asia,  a  fight of ideas, a fight for  a  better\r\n\r\nlife. Whoever organises better and provides a better\r\n\r\nlife  for the people gets the support of the people.\r\n\r\nI agree with the hon. Gentlemen opposite that if any\r\n\r\nact is done to overthrow a government by force, that\r\n\r\nact  must  be  suppressed. But if  we  say  that  we\r\n\r\nbelieve in democracy, if we say that the fabric of a\r\n\r\ndemocratic society is one which allows the free play\r\n\r\nof   ideas,  which  avoids  revolution  by  violence\r\n\r\nbecause revolution by peaceful methods of persuasion\r\n\r\nis  allowed, then, in the name of all the gods  that\r\n\r\nwe  have  in  this country, give that  free  play  a\r\n\r\nchance  to work within the constitutional framework.\r\n\r\nIf   you   do  not,  then  you  will  face  outright\r\n\r\nopposition, an armed revolt, and eventually an armed\r\n\r\nvictory.  Then  the  whole  social  fabric  of  this\r\n\r\nsociety will collapse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to second the motion. The\r\n\r\nonly  reason  the Chief Minister has given  for  the\r\n\r\nrecent    arrests   and   dissolution    of    three\r\n\r\norganisations  is  that  they  were  \"in  the   best\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the  people\".  That  phrase  is  very\r\n\r\nfamiliar to the people of Singapore. They have heard\r\n\r\nit  many  times  in  the past  from  the  mouths  of\r\n\r\ncolonial  officials who wanted to  justify  colonial\r\n\r\nacts  of repression. The people of India heard  this\r\n\r\nphrase  from the mouths of British imperial viceroys\r\n\r\nwho  tried to persuade them that 150 years of  cruel\r\n\r\nBritish exploitation and repression of the people of\r\n\r\nlndia was \"in the best interests of the people\". The\r\n\r\npeople  of  Indonesia had also bee n told  by  their\r\n\r\nformer  Dutch colonial masters that Dutch repression\r\n\r\nwas  \"in the best interests of the people\".  So  did\r\n\r\nthe people of Indo-China hear it from the mouths  of\r\n\r\nthe  French colonialists. The same phrase was  taken\r\n\r\nup  by  Asian  Quislings who tried  to  justify  the\r\n\r\nsuppression  instigated by their  colonial  backseat\r\n\r\ndrivers. And it is the bitter fate of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  hear this phrase of colonial  Fascist\r\n\r\ndouble-talk  from  the mouth of  the  elected  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister. The Chief Minister can only show that  his\r\n\r\naction  is really in the interests of the people  by\r\n\r\nproving his charges against the arrested persons  by\r\n\r\ndemocratic processes in a fair public trial. He  has\r\n\r\nrefused to do this. He has chosen instead to repeat,\r\n\r\nlike  a  well-trained  colonial  parrot,  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  actions are \"in the best interests  of\r\n\r\nthe people\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has claimed, Sir, that he has\r\n\r\nacted  solely in accordance with the law. What  law?\r\n\r\nThe repressive laws of colonialism! One of the first\r\n\r\nthings  that a leader who claims to guide the people\r\n\r\nto  Merdeka  should  do is to safeguard  the  people\r\n\r\nagainst  the use of repressive colonial legislation.\r\n\r\nThat  is  what Nehru did in India and  he  spent  11\r\n\r\nyears in British prisons for doing so. That is  also\r\n\r\nwhat  Sukarno did in Indonesia. But that is not what\r\n\r\nour Chief Minister does. Instead of fighting the use\r\n\r\nof  repressive colonial laws, he himself  uses  them\r\n\r\nagainst  his  own  people. The  Chief  Minister  has\r\n\r\ndenied that he has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade a private agreement with Mr Lennox-Boyd behind\r\n\r\nthe  `backs  of  the people of Singapore.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  he denies that the recent arbitrary  arrests\r\n\r\nand   the   dissolution  of  peaceful  and  lawfully\r\n\r\nconstituted societies form part of the price he  has\r\n\r\nagreed  to  pay to the Colonial Office for  spurious\r\n\r\nconstitutional  concessions  at  the  next   Merdeka\r\n\r\ntalks.  But  the  whole pattern of his  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy  since he took office makes it difficult  for\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore to accept his denial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P., Sir, has consistently striven to unite\r\n\r\nall anti-colonial forces in Singapore so that at the\r\n\r\nnext Merdeka talks we can present a solid and united\r\n\r\nfront  to  the  Colonial Office. We have  repeatedly\r\n\r\ncalled for a Merdeka convention of all anti-colonial\r\n\r\nforces  in Singapore. But some people have  got  the\r\n\r\nimpression,  by  the  way  the  Chief  Minister  has\r\n\r\nstarted   to   attack   anti-colonial   groups   and\r\n\r\nindividuals,  that  the next Merdeka  convention  of\r\n\r\nanti-colonial forces will only be held inside Changi\r\n\r\nPrison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called Middle Road Group of Trade Unions\r\n\r\nhas  also consistently striven in the past  year  to\r\n\r\nachieve  unity  in the trade union  movement.  These\r\n\r\nefforts,  too,  have  been sabotaged  by  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister's  American friends in the I.C.F.T.U. like\r\n\r\nMr George Weaver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sought the unity of all anti-colonial forces in\r\n\r\nSingapore because we knew that this was the only way\r\n\r\nto ensure success at the next Merdeka talks. We gave\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister a vote of confidence because  we\r\n\r\nhoped he would do the right thing to prepare for the\r\n\r\nnext  Merdeka  talks.  We expected  that  those  who\r\n\r\nsincerely  wanted  Merdeka  would  take   steps   to\r\n\r\nstrengthen the forces of Merdeka - the anti-colonial\r\n\r\ngroups,  organisations and individuals of Singapore;\r\n\r\nbut  the  Chief Minister seemed bent on a policy  of\r\n\r\ndestroying the very basis of Merdeka, the democratic\r\n\r\nand    constitutional   anti-colonial   forces    of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  His Government struck off  the  register\r\n\r\nseven  Chinese school teachers without  proving  any\r\n\r\ncharges  against them. Then came the arrest  of  Tan\r\n\r\nLay  Boon,  a prominent trade unionist. Again  there\r\n\r\nwas  no attempt to produce any concrete evidence  to\r\n\r\njustify the arrest. Then\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuddenly on the 18th and 19th of September came  the\r\n\r\noutrage against democratic liberties and freedom  of\r\n\r\nassociation.  Seven  persons,  including   prominent\r\n\r\ntrade  unionists and leaders of civic organisations,\r\n\r\nwere  arrested  under  banishment  orders  and   one\r\n\r\ndetained  under  the Public Security Ordinance.  The\r\n\r\nWomen's  Federation  and  the  Chinese  Brass   Gong\r\n\r\nMusical  Society  were  dissolved.  Meanwhile,   the\r\n\r\npermanent  colonial  officials in  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation, aided by the internal security boys, were\r\n\r\npreparing the Minister for Education to suppress the\r\n\r\nstudents'  movement;  and  on  the  24th  came   the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Education's  bellicose  announcement\r\n\r\nbanning the Chinese Middle School Students Union. On\r\n\r\nthe night of 3rd October, Soon Loh Boon, Chairman of\r\n\r\nthe  Students' Union, was detained. On the following\r\n\r\nmorning  Mr  Chia  Ek Tian, one  of  our  Assistant\r\n\r\nSecretaries  in  the Union, was also  detained.  Our\r\n\r\nchallenge to the Chief Minister to produce  concrete\r\n\r\nevidence  to prove the charges against the  arrested\r\n\r\npersons   and  the  dissolved  societies  has   been\r\n\r\narrogantly   turned   down.  Only   vague   alarmist\r\n\r\nallegations  of Communism and Communist  inspiration\r\n\r\nhave been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the statements made by the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation   make  even  the  witch-hunting   Senator\r\n\r\nMcCarthy  of  America look reasonable  and  slightly\r\n\r\nmore   educated  in  comparison.  At  least  Senator\r\n\r\nMcCarthy  never  carried  the  logic  of  his  anti-Communism  to  the same extent as our  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation.  According to our Minister for Education,\r\n\r\nthe  collective study groups among Chinese  students\r\n\r\nare Communist, because the Communists also have such\r\n\r\nstudy  groups. By this logic, study group  movements\r\n\r\nthroughout the world must be Communist. The  Chinese\r\n\r\nCommunists eat rice. Our Minister for Education also\r\n\r\nsometimes  eats rice. Therefore, he too  must  be  a\r\n\r\nCommunist!  Englishmen prefer  their  tea  at4  p.m.\r\n\r\nAsians  who drink their tea at 4 p.m. are  therefore\r\n\r\nEnglishmen! Americans drive about in American  cars.\r\n\r\nHarry Lee also drives an American car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore,  Harry Lee is an American! Self-criticism\r\n\r\nis  practised  by the Communists. Therefore,  nobody\r\n\r\nmust  criticise himself! We must all pretend  to  be\r\n\r\nsaints. Truly we have a wonderfully educated  person\r\n\r\nin  our  Minister for Education! His logic is simply\r\n\r\nshattering. It has already completely shattered  him\r\n\r\nin the eyes of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hysterical allegations, systematic propagation of\r\n\r\nanti-Communist  hysteria - such  are  the   typical\r\n\r\nmethods  employed  by  anti-progressive  and   anti-democratic  forces the world over. The only  way  to\r\n\r\nexpose  these methods is to demand again  and  again\r\n\r\nfor  the  proof  of these allegations by  democratic\r\n\r\nprocess in an open court of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I challenge the Hon. the Chief Minister to prove\r\n\r\nthe  charges  against the arrested persons  and  the\r\n\r\norganisations  concerned by  democratic  process  in\r\n\r\nopen  court, or else be branded forever as a  witch-hunting  politician who is playing the  Devil's  own\r\n\r\ngame  with the destinies of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nI  challenge  him to deny that he  has  not  made  a\r\n\r\nshameful backdoor deal with Mr Lennox-Boyd and  the\r\n\r\nColonial  Office  to  feed the constitutional  anti-colonial forces of Singapore to the gaping  jaws  of\r\n\r\ncolonial  repression in return for  a  sham  Merdeka\r\n\r\nwhich will be safe for colonial vested interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was responsible for the arrests? The Press\r\n\r\nquotes  the  Chief Minister as saying that  colonial\r\n\r\nofficials  were not responsible for the arrests  but\r\n\r\nthat   he  and  the  other  elected  Ministers  were\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  the decision taken.  Whom  is  the\r\n\r\nChief Minister trying to bluff? Everybody knows that\r\n\r\ninternal   security  is  controlled  by  the   Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary  who sits beside him and that  the  recent\r\n\r\nrepressive measures could therefore only  have  been\r\n\r\ntaken  on the initiative and instigation of colonial\r\n\r\nofficials. How loyal of the Chief Minister  to  keep\r\n\r\nout  of public sight his colonial back-seat drivers!\r\n\r\nHe  will, no doubt, be included in the next  Queen's\r\n\r\nBirthday  Honours List! But the people  elected  him\r\n\r\nnot   to  protect  colonial  officials  from  public\r\n\r\ncensure  but  to  protect  the  people  against  the\r\n\r\nactions of colonial officials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister proudly talks about \"My\r\n\r\nGovernment\"!  Whom is he trying to bluff?  Everybody\r\n\r\nknows   that  under  the  Rendel  Constitution   the\r\n\r\nColonial  Office controls all the key positions  and\r\n\r\nretains  ultimate control. If the elected  Ministers\r\n\r\nthink   that   the  present  Government   is   their\r\n\r\nGovernment, why reopen the next Merdeka  talks?  Has\r\n\r\nthe   Chief  Minister  and  his  elected  colleagues\r\n\r\nforgotten   so  quickly  that  the  previous   Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  declared that the Rendel Constitution  was\r\n\r\nunworkable,  a  point of view with which  they  then\r\n\r\nagreed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has declared that the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore   support   the   Government's   acts   of\r\n\r\nrepression.  I challenge him to have the  moral  and\r\n\r\npolitical  courage to put that statement  to  strict\r\n\r\nproof  thereof. Let him organise a public referendum\r\n\r\nof  the  electorate of Singapore and let him promise\r\n\r\nto  treat the result of the referendum as a vote  of\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  his Government. We  say  with  every\r\n\r\nconfidence that the vast majority of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will declare against him. I have  already\r\n\r\nchallenged the Chief Minister to go back to his  own\r\n\r\nconstituency  in  Havelock.  He  knows  what  their\r\n\r\nverdict will be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, who actually supports the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister in his acts of repression? The public  have\r\n\r\nnot  failed  to  note that the Straits  Times,  that\r\n\r\nmouthpiece  of  British  vested  interests  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry  and  purveyor of cheap  sensationalism  and\r\n\r\nhysterical, unreasoning anti-Communism, regards  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister as a great hero. The Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  been described by this paper as \"A Man  with  a\r\n\r\nMission\"  and  \"The  Man  who  rose  to  the  hour\".\r\n\r\nPolitically, Sir, I would be terribly embarrassed if\r\n\r\nthis British-owned paper ever said a good word about\r\n\r\nme  or  my colleagues. We think that it is perfectly\r\n\r\nnatural   for  a  paper  like  the  Straits   Times,\r\n\r\nrepresenting reactionary colonial vested  interests,\r\n\r\nto  blast the P.A.P. and Middle Road every day as  a\r\n\r\nmatter of religious duty. We would be very surprised\r\n\r\nif  it  did not, for it is our declared aim to bring\r\n\r\nto  an  end the political dominion of British vested\r\n\r\ninterests\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. The Straits Times only favours  those\r\n\r\nwho,  in its opinion, are playing the colonial game,\r\n\r\nand  the  Straits  Times has become an  enthusiastic\r\n\r\nsupporter of the Chief Minister. Further comment  is\r\n\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Press reports, our Chief Minister has\r\n\r\nalso  become  a hero in the eyes of Washington.  All\r\n\r\nAsia knows that Washington is cold to the Nehrus and\r\n\r\nSukarnos  and  Nassers, but in our  Chief  Minister,\r\n\r\nWashington apparently sees a new Syngman Rhee, or  a\r\n\r\nnew  Chiang  Kai-shek in the making. The  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  cannot be proud that their elected  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister should find himself in the company  of  the\r\n\r\nfriends   of  these  discredited  stool-pigeons   of\r\n\r\nforeign   imperialisms  in  Asia.  Does  the   Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  have  any doubt that the  people  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry  would very much prefer him  to  be  in  the\r\n\r\nillustrious  company of great Asian liberators  like\r\n\r\nNehru,  Sukarno and Nasser? But to be worthy of  the\r\n\r\ncompany of a Nehru, our Chief Minister would have to\r\n\r\nbe  prepared  to  go  to jail fighting  against  the\r\n\r\ncolonial  repression of his people.  But  our  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  has  chosen, unlike Nehru,  to  become  an\r\n\r\ninstrument  of  colonial  repression  of  democratic\r\n\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has threatened the anti-colonial forces in Singapore that he will make\r\n\r\nfurther arbitrary arrests if necessary. He is making\r\n\r\na  fatal and suicidal political blunder if he thinks\r\n\r\nthat   he  can  cow  the  anti-colonial  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore into submission. We are not afraid. We are\r\n\r\nnot   frightened  of  such  threats.  We   are   not\r\n\r\nfrightened because the genuine anti-colonial Merdeka\r\n\r\nforces  of  Singapore  are not  confined  to  a  few\r\n\r\nindividuals.  The Merdeka movement has  struck  deep\r\n\r\nroots in the hearts and minds of people of all races\r\n\r\nand  all  classes. A hundred Hon. Mr Lim Yew  Hocks\r\n\r\ncannot destroy this movement. A hundred Hon.

The greatest military  powers  of\r\n\r\nthe  Western  world have had to retreat before  this\r\n\r\ninvincible current, and the Hon. Mr Lim Yew Hock is\r\n\r\nnothing in comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would ask\r\n\r\nthe  elected  Members  of  this  House  to  consider\r\n\r\ncarefully before they vote on this motion,  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  who elected us are watching us very closely.\r\n\r\nHow  we  vote and what we say is going to  determine\r\n\r\nour political future. We must say clearly which side\r\n\r\nwe  are on - on the side of the people of Singapore in\r\n\r\nthe  fight for democratic rights, or on the side  of\r\n\r\nill-concealed  colonial  repression.  I   also   ask\r\n\r\nMembers  not  to  be  diverted  by  what  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister will say to this motion. I can tell them in\r\n\r\nadvance what he will say. He will cry Communism.  He\r\n\r\nwill  quote  reports from his political advisers  in\r\n\r\nthe  Special  Branch.  But I  will  guarantee  this:\r\n\r\nwhatever  the Chief Minister might say, he will  not\r\n\r\noffer to prove his charges by democratic process  in\r\n\r\nan  open  court, and because of this, what  he  says\r\n\r\nwill possess no value at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will also call the attention of elected Members\r\n\r\nof this Assembly to a resolution of the Civil Rights\r\n\r\nConvention  in  which  were  represented  106  trade\r\n\r\nunions  and other public organisations, representing\r\n\r\nin  all  about  200,000 people. This Convention  has\r\n\r\nasked  our Assemblymen to make the following demands\r\n\r\nto the Government:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) That all the arrested persons be either given\r\n\r\na fair public trial or be unconditionally released.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) That an impartial public tribunal be appointed\r\n\r\nto  go  into  the  charges made  against  the  three\r\n\r\ndissolved  societies, and that if the Government  is\r\n\r\nnot  prepared  to  do this, the  ban  on  all  these\r\n\r\norganisations be immediately lifted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) That Government give an assurance to the\r\n\r\npublic  that  no further arbitrary arrests  will  be\r\n\r\nmade   and   that   freedom   of   association   and\r\n\r\nconstitutional  organisation  will  be  scrupulously\r\n\r\nrespected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) That the Labour Front Coalition Government\r\n\r\nwill  strive,  by all possible means, to  strengthen\r\n\r\nand   consolidate  the  unity  of  all  genuine  and\r\n\r\nconstitutional anti-colonial forces in Singapore  as\r\n\r\nan  essential  pre-requisite to the success  of  the\r\n\r\nnext Merdeka talks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are just and democratic demands. We elected\r\n\r\nMembers of this Assembly can only ignore them at our\r\n\r\npolitical peril.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last warning to the Chief Minister. My Party\r\n\r\nand  my Union have already said that we will use all\r\n\r\npossible   peaceful  and  constitutional  means   to\r\n\r\nprotest  against Government's action, and the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister has assured a delegation from my Union that\r\n\r\nhe  will  afford  every facility  for  peaceful  and\r\n\r\nconstitutional  protest.  I  shall  hold  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister to his promise for his own good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nmove an amendment to the motion before the House.

And I move my amendment in the  fullest\r\n\r\nconfidence that it will receive the full support  of\r\n\r\nall  Members  who sincerely believe in and  practise\r\n\r\ndemocracy. This Government does not care to have the\r\n\r\nsupport of those who claim to love Singapore, to owe\r\n\r\nloyalty  to Singapore, and yet are doing their  very\r\n\r\nbest  to destroy the security and well-being of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore. This Government does not  care\r\n\r\nto  have  the support of such people. It  is  better\r\n\r\nthat  such Assemblymen declare themselves  here  and\r\n\r\nnow  so  that the people of Singapore can know  them\r\n\r\nfor what they are and not what they pretend to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government ordered the arrests of six persons\r\n\r\nunder  the Banishment Ordinance and one person under\r\n\r\nthe  Preservation of Public Security Ordinance,  and\r\n\r\nthe  dissolution  of  two organisations;  and  these\r\n\r\norders  were  executed on the 18th and the  19th  of\r\n\r\nSeptember. Since then, one further organisation  has\r\n\r\nbeen  dissolved  and  two other  persons  have  been\r\n\r\narrested  under the Preservation of Public  Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  The arrests were ordered on the  grounds\r\n\r\nthat  the persons concerned had been taking part  in\r\n\r\nsubversive  activities which definitely are  not  in\r\n\r\nthe  best  interests and security of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore;   and   the   three  organisations   were\r\n\r\ndissolved  because the Government is satisfied  that\r\n\r\nthey were Communist-front organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, some people have quite rightly\r\n\r\nasked  me  why the Government should have  found  it\r\n\r\nnecessary to take this action when there is apparent\r\n\r\npeace  and quiet in Singapore. May I add, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthe Government has channels of information which are\r\n\r\nnot normally at the disposal of the general\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic?  They are not aware that this is a dangerous\r\n\r\nquiet.  They  are not aware that there  has  been  a\r\n\r\nchange   in  Communist  strategy.  There  has   been\r\n\r\nintensive penetration into a wide field of otherwise\r\n\r\nlaudable  activities which is building up a position\r\n\r\nof  a powerful force that threatens the whole future\r\n\r\nof  democratic government. The aim is to control the\r\n\r\nmasses  through  united front,  of  workers  through\r\n\r\ntrade unions, of youth through students' unions,  of\r\n\r\npeasants  through farmers' associations, and  attap-dwellers'   associations,  of   the   intelligentsia\r\n\r\nthrough     teachers,    literary    and    cultural\r\n\r\norganisations,   of   women  through   the   women's\r\n\r\nfederation, and of political Parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government was confronted with this growing\r\n\r\nmenace  when it took office last June, but no action\r\n\r\nwas  taken because we were biding our time and  were\r\n\r\ngathering  more  and  more news intelligence  before\r\n\r\nlaunching on our campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, Sir, the Government faced its first\r\n\r\nAssembly   sitting,  and  on  the  debate   on   the\r\n\r\nGovernor's  Address  I made it  very  clear  to  the\r\n\r\nAssembly, among other things, the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) I was personally not anxious to become Chief\r\n\r\nMinister, and still am not anxious, but that I  took\r\n\r\non  this  office,  an  onerous  and  difficult  job,\r\n\r\nbecause I sincerely believed that it was required of\r\n\r\nme and that I had the confidence of the public;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) This Government, I repeat, is not a caretaker\r\n\r\nGovernment  in the accepted sense of the word.  This\r\n\r\nGovernment is a caretaker Government in  so  far  as\r\n\r\nits life is concerned. During its life the machinery\r\n\r\nof  government will be in full swing, and whether we\r\n\r\ngovern wisely or not time will tell; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) I assured hon. Members that during the\r\n\r\nintervening  period  before  the  reopening  of  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional talks in London, this Government will\r\n\r\ndo everything in its power to bring about a state of\r\n\r\naffairs  that will not only be conducive to  success\r\n\r\nbut  also  in  the best interests of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, Sir, was gratified to receive a\r\n\r\nunanimous vote of confidence, and this has  made  us\r\n\r\nmore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naware of our duty to the people of Singapore. In the\r\n\r\ndischarge of this sacred duty, my colleagues  and  I\r\n\r\nare  determined to stop the corruption of the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  by  what  is a  vast  secret  society\r\n\r\nworking  for  Communist  domination.  As  I   stated\r\n\r\nearlier,  this  Government  is  satisfied  that  the\r\n\r\nWomen's  Federation, the Chinese Brass Gong  Musical\r\n\r\nSociety  and  the  Singapore Chinese  Middle  School\r\n\r\nStudents'    Union   have   become   Communist-front\r\n\r\norganisations. They have, therefore, been  dissolved\r\n\r\nand  those  who  perverted these otherwise  laudable\r\n\r\nassociations  to make them instruments of  Communism\r\n\r\nmust be checked and, if necessary, removed from  our\r\n\r\nmidst.   Hence   the  arrests  for  banishment   and\r\n\r\ndetention. I would like, Sir, to assure hon. Members\r\n\r\nthat  this action was taken only after very  lengthy\r\n\r\nand  serious  consideration, and once this  decision\r\n\r\nhas been taken, the Government intends to pursue  relentlessly its action against subversive activities.\r\n\r\nThe  interests, the security and the welfare of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore demand this of us, and we  shall\r\n\r\nnot fail them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the distortion of\r\n\r\nfacts  by  our  opponents, I find  it  necessary  to\r\n\r\nrepeat  in this Assembly that the decision  to  take\r\n\r\nthis  action  against subversive activities  in  the\r\n\r\nbest interests of the people of Singapore rests with\r\n\r\nthe  elected  Ministers. Although  the  question  of\r\n\r\ninternal  security is in the portfolio of the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary, the question of policy does not lie  with\r\n\r\nhim.  It lies with the Council of Ministers  and  if\r\n\r\nthe elected Government, which is in the majority  in\r\n\r\nthe  Council,  does  not  subscribe  to  any  policy\r\n\r\nregarding internal security, the Chief Secretary  is\r\n\r\npowerless to enforce it. My colleagues and  I,  Sir,\r\n\r\ntherefore  accept  full  responsibility   for   this\r\n\r\naction.  We  stand firm in our resolve and  we  face\r\n\r\nsquarely any criticism, and even any abuse  that  is\r\n\r\nbeing  hurled  at  us.  Do not therefore  blame  the\r\n\r\ncolonial officials. Put the blame where it  is  due,\r\n\r\nif  we  are  indeed blameworthy. Do  not  blame  the\r\n\r\npolice and the Special Branch, for they are there to\r\n\r\nexecute the orders of the Council of Ministers,  and\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to take this opportunity  to  pay  a\r\n\r\ntribute  to  their loyalty and to their devotion  to\r\n\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd  because I categorically stated that the elected\r\n\r\nMinisters   accepted   full   responsibility,    our\r\n\r\nopponents were therefore deprived of the pleasure of\r\n\r\nhurling their abuse at the officials. They therefore\r\n\r\ndirected their vile epithets at me, and called me  a\r\n\r\n\"colonial  stooge\". Sir, the very mention  of  these\r\n\r\nwords  recalls to my mind the meeting  which  I  had\r\n\r\nwith representatives of seven organisations who came\r\n\r\nto  see  me  in  connection  with  the  Government's\r\n\r\naction.   At  that  meeting,  Sir,  after  listening\r\n\r\npatiently   to  their  representations   and   after\r\n\r\nanswering the points raised by them, I turned  round\r\n\r\nto  their  leader and asked whether by  a  statement\r\n\r\nwhich  he had made earlier he implied that I  was  a\r\n\r\ncolonial  stooge. Silence. Silence. I repeated  this\r\n\r\nquestion  three times and after much hesitation  and\r\n\r\nwhispered  consultation he turned round  to  me  and\r\n\r\nreplied,  \"I  must consult our members.\"  These  so-called  champions of democracy have  to  have  their\r\n\r\nthinking done for them! For nearly nine years have I\r\n\r\nserved  the  people of Singapore in the  Legislative\r\n\r\nCouncil  and in this Assembly, and I would therefore\r\n\r\nleave it to the public to form their own judgment. I\r\n\r\ncan  say  with  a  clear conscience  that  I  am  no\r\n\r\ncolonial  stooge.  And my answer to  my  friends  is\r\n\r\n\"Thank God, I am no Communist stooge!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members are aware that since this  Government\r\n\r\ntook  strong action against subversive elements,  my\r\n\r\ncolleague  the  Minister for Education  and  I  have\r\n\r\nreceived a number of death threats. Both of us  have\r\n\r\ndeclared  that we are not deterred by these threats.\r\n\r\nI   repeat:   this  Government  intends   to   fight\r\n\r\nsubversive  elements to the bitter  end.  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsaying this with any sense of bravado. No, Sir. I am\r\n\r\nsaying  this with all solemnity, for it is a  solemn\r\n\r\ntask  that this Government has set out to do - to wipe\r\n\r\nout  subversive activities in the best interests  of\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As against these death threats, Sir, I am glad to\r\n\r\nsay that I have received a greater number of letters\r\n\r\nof  congratulations and wholehearted support - not the\r\n\r\n142 organisations referred to - but these are from men\r\n\r\nwho signed their names.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Looking for a job!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> No!

They came\r\n\r\nto  me,  Sir,  and  handed to me signed  pledges  of\r\n\r\nsupport  of our action against subversive  elements.\r\n\r\nThey came to me of their own accord. Because of  the\r\n\r\npledges that I had received, I took sustenance  from\r\n\r\ntheir support and I have assured them, too, that the\r\n\r\nGovernment will carry on the fight to rid  Singapore\r\n\r\nof subversive elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week I received a letter from an\r\n\r\norganisation,  loosely described  as  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTrade  Unions  Working Committee,  which  claims  to\r\n\r\nrepresent  95 trade unions. My office  asked  for  a\r\n\r\nlist  of  the names of the 95 trade unions which  it\r\n\r\nalleges  to claim, but to-date this information  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  supplied.

Six of these persons are not  local  born.\r\n\r\nThey  owe  their  loyalty elsewhere.  The  remaining\r\n\r\nthree  persons, while local born, have been  engaged\r\n\r\nin  subversive activities aimed at the overthrow  of\r\n\r\ndemocratic  government. Merdeka indeed! Merdeka  for\r\n\r\nwhom?  This  is  indeed a classic  example  of  that\r\n\r\nspecious and contemptible device - the greater the lie\r\n\r\nthe greater the chance of it being put over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  people  of  Singapore desire to be  masters  of\r\n\r\ntheir own fate and have no intention of changing one\r\n\r\nmaster for another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chia Ek Tian, Sir, was arrested on 2nd October\r\n\r\nunder  the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance\r\n\r\nas  the Government has good reasons to believe  that\r\n\r\nhe  is  involved in subversive activities.  Chia  Ek\r\n\r\nTian is the Secretary of the Bukit Panjang Branch of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Factory and Shop Workers Union.

This Government, as I have\r\n\r\nsaid  many  a  time,  intends  to  put  an  end   to\r\n\r\nsubversive  activities of all persons, whoever  they\r\n\r\nmay  be,  even  if they are members  of  the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me repeat, Sir, that Chia Ek Tian was not\r\n\r\narrested  because he is an executive member  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  but  because of his individual  activities.\r\n\r\nBut  the  fact  that he is a member of  the  Central\r\n\r\nCommittee of the P.A.P., that he is the Secretary of\r\n\r\nthe  Bukit  Panjang Branch of the Singapore  Factory\r\n\r\nand  Shop  Workers  Union, is an indication  to  the\r\n\r\npublic of the extent to which infiltration has taken\r\n\r\nplace in these two organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on this subject, Sir, I would like to repeat\r\n\r\nmy  assurance to the workers of Singapore  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  action  is in  no  way  aimed  at  the\r\n\r\nlegitimate activities of democratic trade unions and\r\n\r\ntrade unionists. The Government's policy has already\r\n\r\nbeen  and  will always be to support and assist  all\r\n\r\ndemocratic trade unions. I would therefore  ask  the\r\n\r\nworkers  of  Singapore  not  to  be  misled  by  the\r\n\r\nmalicious   lies  of  the  so-called  champions   of\r\n\r\nMerdeka.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Government desires to express the\r\n\r\ngratitude  of  the  people  of  Singapore   to   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Chief Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman,  for\r\n\r\nhis   strong  support  of  the  Government's  action\r\n\r\nagainst subversive elements. Knowing the Tunku as  I\r\n\r\ndo,  Sir,  I  am  sure he will render Singapore  all\r\n\r\npossible assistance when called upon to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, no government can abdicate its\r\n\r\nduty  to  protect  its citizens and  it  is  in  the\r\n\r\nexecution of this duty that the Banishment Ordinance\r\n\r\nis  invoked against these six persons who  were  not\r\n\r\nborn  in  Singapore. These persons are enjoying  our\r\n\r\nhospitality,   and  yet  they  were   planning   and\r\n\r\nconniving  in subversive activities with'  the  sole\r\n\r\nintention  of disrupting and destroying our  way  of\r\n\r\nlife. To allow them to stay with the knowledge  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has of their vile activities  would\r\n\r\namount  to  condoning their evil work and  betraying\r\n\r\nthe  trust the people of Singapore have imposed upon\r\n\r\nelected leaders and their elected Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fight the evil in our midst it is absolutely\r\n\r\nessential to use the special powers conferred on the\r\n\r\nGovernment  by  the  Banishment  Ordinance  and  the\r\n\r\nPreservation of Public Security Ordinance.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to assure hon. Members that these powers  will\r\n\r\nonly  be  used where my colleagues and I  are  fully\r\n\r\nsatisfied  that  they  are  necessary  in  the  best\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the  people  of  Singapore.  We  will\r\n\r\nexercise  them  with  the utmost circumspection  and\r\n\r\nwith  the  keenest  sense of responsibility  to  the\r\n\r\nindividual  as well as to the State,  and  to  prove\r\n\r\nthis,  Sir, I give the following figures of  arrests\r\n\r\nunder  the Banishment Ordinance and the Preservation\r\n\r\nof Public Security Ordinance:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orders of banishment issued between 26th April, 1955, and 18th September, 1956, that is, from the\r\n\r\ntime  of the first sitting of the last session  till 18th September, 1956:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For subversive activities - 17. This includes the\r\n\r\nsix  arrests made on 18th September, 1956.

This\r\n\r\nallegation is utterly ridiculus and is just  another\r\n\r\nartifice designed to distort real conditions and the\r\n\r\nreal  sentiments of the great majority of the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  Is  he suggesting that  the  elected\r\n\r\nGovernment must stand by tamely and take  no  action\r\n\r\nto  protect the security of the people of Singapore?\r\n\r\nThe  primary duty of this Government, and indeed  of\r\n\r\nany  government, is to provide for  the  safety  and\r\n\r\nsecurity of the people of Singapore, and it  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing to deviate from this duty.

I  am  surprised\r\n\r\nthat  a  man,  who has such a fine  command  of  the\r\n\r\nEnglish language as he has, should have descended to\r\n\r\nthat  abuse  of  the language - that double  talk  for\r\n\r\nwhich  the Communists are responsible. He speaks  of\r\n\r\n\"masses\"  when  he  really  means  \"minorities\".  He\r\n\r\nspeaks  of  \"right-thinking people\"  when  he  means\r\n\r\npeople  whose  ability to think for  themselves  has\r\n\r\nbeen  killed by the insistent brain-washing to which\r\n\r\nthey have been subjected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar ridiculed the support\r\n\r\nwhich the Government has received for its action. He\r\n\r\ncondemns some of the associations because he has not\r\n\r\nheard  of  them.  He has not heard of  them  because\r\n\r\npicked men have been doing the hearing for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhim. Is not his Party always claiming the support of\r\n\r\nso   many  hundreds  of  associations  and  so  many\r\n\r\nthousands of supporters and members? But can he deny\r\n\r\nthat  many of the members of these associations  are\r\n\r\nso  because they have been intimidated into joining?\r\n\r\nThousands  are  counted over and over again  because\r\n\r\nthey are members of many different associations. How\r\n\r\nmany  members of the Middle Schools Students' Union,\r\n\r\nfor  instance, are members also of the multitude  of\r\n\r\nthe  so-called Old Boys' Association,  Old  Boys  of\r\n\r\nPrimary   Schools  and  of  the  various   so-called\r\n\r\ncultural societies?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, one part of the speech made by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Tanjong Pagar this morning with which\r\n\r\nI  agree. I refer to the part in which he touched on\r\n\r\nthe  consequences of dictatorial action. The  action\r\n\r\nof  this Government has been taken simply and solely\r\n\r\nto  prevent  the young and immature mind from  being\r\n\r\ntaught  how to practise the art of dictatorship  and\r\n\r\nyet  win  the  support of weak-kneed  and  spineless\r\n\r\nadults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also spoke of the free play of\r\n\r\nideas. Mr Speaker, Sir, when you have heard what  I\r\n\r\nhave to say, you will be able to judge whether there\r\n\r\nis  any  free play of ideas in the Students'  Union,\r\n\r\nany  free  play of ideas among these young  students\r\n\r\nwho, by their malleable nature, have had their minds\r\n\r\nperverted  and  twisted  to think  along  the  lines\r\n\r\ndictated  to  them by unscrupulous, cowardly  adults\r\n\r\nwho  embrace  an ideology alien to all  of  us.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment,  as  the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister  has\r\n\r\npointed out, will not tolerate such subversive  acts\r\n\r\nperpetrated by aliens or local persons whose loyalty\r\n\r\nlies  elsewhere.  You  have  only  to  look  at  the\r\n\r\naudacity of the students who flout the law. One does\r\n\r\nnot  have  to  go far to see how our young  students\r\n\r\nhave  been  forced to do and to think. Thousands  of\r\n\r\nour  middle school students sang Communist songs and\r\n\r\nheld   protest  meetings  in  their  classrooms   to\r\n\r\ncelebrate  Peking's  National Day.  Where  is  their\r\n\r\nloyalty?  People talk glibly of Merdeka on  the  one\r\n\r\nhand  while, on the other, they go out of their  way\r\n\r\nto encourage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould-be  voters to turn their heads to Peking,  the\r\n\r\nNew  China, Mao Tse-tung, Lenin, Krushchev,  Stalin,\r\n\r\nand a host of other Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, hon. Members received a White Paper,\r\n\r\nNo.  Cmd.  53  of 1956, entitled \"Singapore  Chinese\r\n\r\nMiddle  Schools  Students' Union\". The  contents  in\r\n\r\nthis Paper are factual statements backed by concrete\r\n\r\nproofs.  After reading it and after I have  finished\r\n\r\nwith  my  account of the reasons for the arrests  of\r\n\r\nthe  students and teachers connected with subversion\r\n\r\nand  the grounds on which the Government has decided\r\n\r\nto  ban  the  Students' Union, I am sure  that  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  will  have  no doubts  whatsoever  of  the\r\n\r\njustifiable  and  wise action taken  by  Government.\r\n\r\nBefore  I  do so, I would like to draw the attention\r\n\r\nof  hon. Members to a few factual statements printed\r\n\r\non page 1 of the White Paper:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In 1951, the Central Bureau of the Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party issued a directive on the  \"Party's\r\n\r\nUrgent Tasks\", one of which was defined in this way:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align=\"center\">Cultural Working Personnel.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Town organisations must train up working\r\n\r\npersonnel,  particularly  young  cultural   working\r\n\r\npersonnel,  to  send out to operate  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas.  To  this end it is very necessary  for  the\r\n\r\nParty  to  be active among Middle School  Students,\r\n\r\nand  this  aspect  of our work  must  be  completed\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Similarly,  in a later M.C.P. directive  dated  11th\r\n\r\nJune, 1956, it was laid down that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of winning over the school children is\r\n\r\nvery   important   and  must  not  be   overlooked. Especially  in  circumstances where  the  enemy  is\r\n\r\nstronger  than we are, the work of winning  support\r\n\r\nfrom   school  children  and  organising  them   to\r\n\r\nstruggle    is   more   important   than   military\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Clearly  the  schools  were a target  for  Communist\r\n\r\nexploitation   as   another   instrument   for   the\r\n\r\nachievement of power by the M.C.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement was made in 1955 by a Chinese Middle\r\n\r\nSchool  student who was an official of the Singapore\r\n\r\nChinese  Middle Schools Students' Union and  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time  an under-cover agent for the  M.C.P.  He\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one stage the Government was about to permit\r\n\r\nregistration  (of  the  Singapore  Chinese   Middle Schools Students' Union) under the conditions  that\r\n\r\nstudents   should  not  take  part   in   political\r\n\r\nactivities  or  interfere  with  labour   disputes. Representatives   of   the  Preparatory   Committee\r\n\r\nrefused  to  accept  this  proviso  and  this   was\r\n\r\nconsidered   by  the  Party  Organisation   to   be\r\n\r\nstupid... The Union should accept such conditions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noutwardly  but  carry on with political  activities\r\n\r\nafterwards ...The decision to register the Union with\r\n\r\nthe  proviso  was  undoubtedly made  by  the  Party Organisation and accepted by the S.C.M.S.S.U.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now proceed to show you, Mr Speaker, in\r\n\r\ndetail how the activities of the Union have followed\r\n\r\nunmistakably  the Communist pattern. The  difficulty\r\n\r\nhas  been, not to find supporting evidence,  but  to\r\n\r\ndecide  what  to  select from the enormous  mass  of\r\n\r\nmaterial  obtained  from papers published,  speeches\r\n\r\nmade and actions taken by officials of the Union and\r\n\r\nby  leaders of the Communist countries whose stooges\r\n\r\nthey have been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government decided to dissolve the Union\r\n\r\nbecause  its activities were incompatible  with  the\r\n\r\npeace and good order of this colony, and because  it\r\n\r\nwas  being  used for purposes which conflicted  with\r\n\r\nits  objects or rules as entered in the Register  of\r\n\r\nSocieties. The grounds for the first charge are that\r\n\r\nthe Union had become a Communist-front organisation,\r\n\r\nthat  it  had  been penetrated by  elements  of  the\r\n\r\nM.C.P., and that it had used intimidatory methods to\r\n\r\noppose  Government policy and school authority;  and\r\n\r\nfor  the second, that it had persistently flouted  a\r\n\r\ncondition  in its rules that it should not take  part\r\n\r\nin politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Communists have been for several years in\r\n\r\narmed  revolt  against constitutional government  in\r\n\r\nMalaya  and anyone who aids them is an enemy of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  The charges that the Union is a  Communist-front  organisation and that it has been  penetrated\r\n\r\nby   the  M.C.P. are  therefore  exceedingly  grave\r\n\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a Communist-front organisation? It is\r\n\r\nsimply  an  organisation which allows itself  to  be\r\n\r\nused  for Communist purposes. It may or may not have\r\n\r\nmembers  who are Communists; if it has, then  it  is\r\n\r\nall the more dangerous because it can be manipulated\r\n\r\nmore  effectively  to  serve  Communist  ends.   The\r\n\r\nStudents'  Union has been infiltrated by the  M.C.P.\r\n\r\nand, since its registration in October last year,  4\r\n\r\nmembers  of  whom 3 were officials have  had  to  be\r\n\r\ndetained under the Preservation of Public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecurity  Ordinance. In all 4 cases, the Council  of\r\n\r\nMinisters  was  quite  satisfied  that  the   M.C.P.\r\n\r\nconnections did, in fact, exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the 3 officials handed over to the Police a\r\n\r\nlarge  number of M.C.P. documents including a series\r\n\r\nof  secret  party  publications entitled  Study,  in\r\n\r\nwhich  stress was laid upon the importance of  study\r\n\r\nto  help comrades to further the revolution; of  the\r\n\r\nthree  magic weapons - the leadership of the Communist\r\n\r\nParty,   the   armed  struggle,   and   the   united\r\n\r\nfront - which  experience  has  shown   them   to   be\r\n\r\nfundamentally  suited  for  use  in   the   national\r\n\r\nliberation  movements in the colonies; of  criticism\r\n\r\nand  self-criticism as a means to unity; and of  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of workers and student movements to help\r\n\r\nthe mass struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, a middle school pupil was found in\r\n\r\npossession of a series of party education  documents\r\n\r\nentitled   \"Hsueh   Hsi\"   (\"Study\")   which    have\r\n\r\nundoubtedly  influenced  the  methods  used  by  the\r\n\r\nUnion.   The  pupil  was  convicted  in  court   and\r\n\r\nsentenced to 5 years' imprisonment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is irrefutable evidence then that the\r\n\r\nCommunists  had penetrated into the Union.  What  of\r\n\r\nthe  charge  that it had behaved in a Communist  way\r\n\r\nand   allowed  itself  to  be  used  for   Communist\r\n\r\npurposes?  Here there is much evidence - for  example,\r\n\r\nof  its  close  collaboration with other  Communist-front  organisations such as the Women's  Federation\r\n\r\nand the various so-called cultural societies; of its\r\n\r\nuse  of the well-known Communist practices of  hsueh\r\n\r\nhsi and of criticism and self-criticism to condition\r\n\r\nthe  minds  of  its  members  to  accept  the  party\r\n\r\nline - that  I  must deal with at much greater  length later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting and revealing to trace the\r\n\r\nincreasing  use  by  the  Union  of  all  well-tried\r\n\r\nCommunist techniques and I therefore propose to give\r\n\r\nyou, first of all, a short survey of the origins  of\r\n\r\nthe  Union, of its `struggle' for registration,  and\r\n\r\nof    its   development   into   a   Communist-front\r\n\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  will remember the introduction  into\r\n\r\nthis country of a scheme for National Service, which\r\n\r\nrequired just a few of the army of able-bodied young\r\n\r\nmen  to  give  up an hour or two a week  to  undergo\r\n\r\ntraining  principally for the Civil  Defence  Corps.\r\n\r\nFor  any young man who professed to be loyal to this\r\n\r\ncountry,  this  service  should  have  been  not  a'\r\n\r\nhardship  to  be  avoided  but  a  privilege  to  be\r\n\r\nundertaken proudly and willingly. Yet soon after the\r\n\r\nregistration began, it became obvious that there was\r\n\r\nincreasingly  organised opposition  in  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nMiddle  Schools, and eventually a 55-man  delegation\r\n\r\nwas  appointed with the high-sounding title  of  the\r\n\r\n\"Singapore Chinese Middle Schools Students Appealing\r\n\r\nfor Exemption from National Service Delegation\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That delegation eventually gave way to a\r\n\r\npreparatory  committee which on the 9th of  October,\r\n\r\n1954, made a Press release about the proposal to set\r\n\r\nup  a Chinese Middle Schools Students' Union. On the\r\n\r\n7th  of  January, 1955, the first formal application\r\n\r\nfor  the  Union  to be registered was  made  to  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Societies.  It  was  refused  on  the\r\n\r\ngrounds  that the Union would be used for  political\r\n\r\npurposes  and  its registration would  therefore  be\r\n\r\nagainst the public interest. On the 22nd of January,\r\n\r\na second application was made and when this also was\r\n\r\nrefused, there was violent agitation in the  Chinese\r\n\r\nPress   and   appeals  for  support   to   all   the\r\n\r\norganisations  of the extreme Left. At  the  end  of\r\n\r\nMarch, the pupils of the middle schools organised  a\r\n\r\none-day  sit-down  strike  in  protest  against  the\r\n\r\ncontinued  refusal  to register  the  society.  This\r\n\r\nstrike  was very much a threat to the newly  elected\r\n\r\nCoalition  Government, which harboured  nothing  but\r\n\r\ngoodwill  to all men. I will not say that  it  could\r\n\r\nsee  no  wrong  in  anyone,  but  it  was  naturally\r\n\r\nreluctant   to  place  any  restriction   upon   the\r\n\r\nactivities of any section of the community unless it\r\n\r\nhad  certain proof that these activities  would  be\r\n\r\ndetrimental  to  the interests of the  people  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.  You  will, no doubt, remember the  flood  of\r\n\r\nmetaphors  about the position in the Chinese  middle\r\n\r\nschools  at  that time. It was said,  for  instance,\r\n\r\nthat the body\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducational was a sick child which required  careful\r\n\r\nnursing, and although it was suggested that  a  more\r\n\r\nfitting  analogy  would have  been  to  an  infected\r\n\r\npatient  who  ought  to  be  isolated,  or  to   one\r\n\r\nsuffering from a rapidly spreading cancer for  which\r\n\r\nonly the surgeon's knife could provide the cure, the\r\n\r\nGovernment, nevertheless, believed that  its  proper\r\n\r\ncourse   was   to  give  these  young   people   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to show that they could be  trusted  to\r\n\r\nwork  for  the common good. Of course,  we  had  our\r\n\r\ndoubts  about  the  wisdom of registering - doubts  on\r\n\r\neducational as well as political grounds. We thought\r\n\r\nthat authority should be vested in the principal and\r\n\r\nteachers, perhaps with the possibility of appeal  to\r\n\r\nthe supervisor as the representative of the managers\r\n\r\nin   matters   which  particularly  affected   their\r\n\r\ninterests. We foresaw the danger of introducing into\r\n\r\nthe  schools another body which might claim  control\r\n\r\nover  the  pupils,  a  control  which  might  easily\r\n\r\nconflict with the authority of those legally set  in\r\n\r\nauthority over them. It needed little imagination to\r\n\r\nforesee  the  dangers  of  their  participation   in\r\n\r\npolitics  and  in  trade disputes. Indeed  they  had\r\n\r\nalready   given   not   only  the   Government   but\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  all Parties  in  this  Assembly\r\n\r\ncause  to  fear  the  harm they might  do  by  their\r\n\r\nactivities  in these fields. Let me quote  from  the\r\n\r\nReport   of  the  All-Party  Committee  on   Chinese\r\n\r\nEducation. Paragraph 86 reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Whilst taking such a sympathetic approach towards\r\n\r\nstudents' discussion of politics, we must beware  of\r\n\r\nthe fact that there is a danger that healthy student\r\n\r\nactivities  and  enthusiasm  could  be  misused   by\r\n\r\npolitical  groups whose intentions are to use  these\r\n\r\nstudent   activities   to   overthrow   a   lawfully\r\n\r\nconstituted   Government   unconstitutionally.    In\r\n\r\nwelcoming students taking an intelligent interest in\r\n\r\npolitics  since they will shortly take their  places\r\n\r\nas  adult  members of the population,  whether  they\r\n\r\ncome  from English schools or Chinese schools, there\r\n\r\nshould,  however, be constant vigilance to see  that\r\n\r\nany  particular form of normal student  activity  is\r\n\r\nnot  perverted by groups whose sole intention is  to\r\n\r\noverthrow  a  lawfully  constituted  Government   by\r\n\r\nunlawful activities.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this danger was understood, the Committee\r\n\r\nthought  that the possibilities for good  outweighed\r\n\r\nthe possibilities for evil. Paragraph 82 of the same\r\n\r\nReport states that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...there are activities which could result in a\r\n\r\nbetter   Singapore   and  in  which   the   student\r\n\r\nparticipation would not\r\n\r\nonly  be welcomed, but would give them the sense  of\r\n\r\nworthwhile  achievement, of responsibility,  and  of\r\n\r\nvaluable training in citizenship - practical duties of\r\n\r\nbuilding  up,  of  contributing to  security  and  a\r\n\r\nbetter  way  of life, of combating disease,  poverty\r\n\r\nand  ignorance, not of fostering feelings of  hatred\r\n\r\nand  dissension.  They should devote  themselves  to\r\n\r\ntheir  studies and make good use of the  educational\r\n\r\nand  career  opportunities which will  presently  be\r\n\r\nopened  to  them,  and  thus  serve  Singapore   and\r\n\r\nMalaya.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then in paragraph 83 of the same Report:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We noted with deep satisfaction, whilst this\r\n\r\nReport  was  being  finalised,  that  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nChinese  Students'  Union  had  been  accepted   for\r\n\r\nregistration as a Society, on stipulating  that  the\r\n\r\nmembers  as a body would not participate in politics\r\n\r\nnor  in  industrial strife of any kind.  We  endorse\r\n\r\nthis decision.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Parties therefore had their doubts, yet all\r\n\r\nParties   were  then  agreed  that  Government   was\r\n\r\njustified  in  giving  the opportunity  to  do  good\r\n\r\nbefore it denied the opportunity to do evil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see now how the Union responded to the\r\n\r\ntrust  reposed in them by the Government  and  other\r\n\r\nelected  Members  of this Assembly.  The  Union  was\r\n\r\nregistered on the 6th of October, 1955. On the  very\r\n\r\nnext  day - I  repeat,  the very  next  day - the  Union\r\n\r\norganised Victory celebrations. An outsider would no\r\n\r\ndoubt   attribute   this  to  a   natural   youthful\r\n\r\nexuberance  and happiness. So it may have  been  for\r\n\r\nsome  of the misguided boys and girls who took part.\r\n\r\nBut  the  celebrations quickly  assumed  a  sinister\r\n\r\nmeaning.  The  victory  was attributed  not  to  the\r\n\r\ngenerosity on the part of the Government but to \"the\r\n\r\nglorious  bloodshed of May the 13th and to the  sit-down  strike  of the 30th of March\".  There  was  an\r\n\r\nattack on the Public Security Bill - said to be  \"more\r\n\r\nruthless than the Emergency Regulations\" - and demands\r\n\r\nfor  the release of detainees. The Union had started\r\n\r\noff  as  it  meant  to  continue,  with  a  flagrant\r\n\r\ndefiance of the authority of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, the Union wrote to the Chinese\r\n\r\nChamber  of Commerce demanding their support against\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Security  Bill,  which,  they  alleged,\r\n\r\ndiscriminated against the Union. Another  ten  days,\r\n\r\nand  we  had  a speech by an official of  the  Union\r\n\r\nsaying, amongst\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  things, that the Public Security Bill  should\r\n\r\nbe  opposed  to  the last and that the 'No-politics'\r\n\r\nclause was unreasonable and must be fought against.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the next day, the 11th November, they were\r\n\r\nreminded  by the Registrar of Societies of the  'No-politics'  clause in their constitution.  With  what\r\n\r\neffect?  At  a  meeting at the Chinese  High  School\r\n\r\ncalled on the 12th, the President of the Union,  Mr\r\n\r\nSoon  Loh  Boon, again demanded the cancellation  of\r\n\r\nthe  'No-politics'  clause and attacked  the  Public\r\n\r\nSecurity  Bill. On the 13th, there was a meeting  at\r\n\r\nthe  Chung Cheng High School which not only repeated\r\n\r\nthose attacks but also resolved to send a letter  to\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  Chamber  of  Commerce  asking  it   to\r\n\r\nintervene in the Singapore Traction Company  strike,\r\n\r\nand  to  warn  the Government that the  Union  would\r\n\r\nparticipate   in   political   activities   if   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  did  not specify in the Public  Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance  that students would not be arrested.  Can\r\n\r\nyou  imagine anything more arrogant, or more  likely\r\n\r\nto lead to a reign of terror in Singapore? What is a\r\n\r\nstudent?  The word is used in Singapore  loosely  to\r\n\r\ndescribe  anyone from a child of four or five  going\r\n\r\nto  his first nursery school to an adult doing post-graduate  studies  at a university.  Are  they  all,\r\n\r\nincluding  these  professional young  men  in  their\r\n\r\nmiddle  twenties  who appear to  find  the  role  of\r\n\r\nagitator against the Government so profitable, to be\r\n\r\nabove  the law? I hope that hon. Members will  agree\r\n\r\nwith  me  that there are so-called students in  this\r\n\r\ncolony  whose  presence here makes it imperative  to\r\n\r\nhave  the  Public Security Ordinance. You  all  know\r\n\r\nwhat  the Federation Government thinks of them,  and\r\n\r\nthat  it  has  made it quite clear that their  trips\r\n\r\nacross the Causeway are unwelcomed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me continue with this revealing catalogue of\r\n\r\nthe  Union's activities. On the 19th of November the\r\n\r\nUnion  replied that the warning of the Registrar  of\r\n\r\nSocieties  could not be accepted; on the 27th,  they\r\n\r\nwrote  to  me  asking  me to intervene  in  the  bus\r\n\r\nstrike;  and  about  this time  too  they  began  to\r\n\r\nagitate again against National Service and organised\r\n\r\na  mutual  help  department, one of the  objects  of\r\n\r\nwhich was to help members of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Union  to  avoid being called up  for  service.\r\n\r\nThese,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, are the young people  who\r\n\r\nclaim  to stand in the van of the fight for Merdeka.\r\n\r\nWhat  kind of Merdeka would it be which had to  rely\r\n\r\non such spineless material?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In early December, they returned to the attack on\r\n\r\nGovernment's educational policy, reinforced - on paper\r\n\r\nat  least,  though there is, in fact, no appreciable\r\n\r\ndistinction  between them - by a number of  Old  Boys'\r\n\r\nassociations  and  by  the Arts  Society  of  Middle\r\n\r\nSchool  Graduates of 1953. And the girls  came  into\r\n\r\nthe  picture again when a lorry carrying  the  Union\r\n\r\nbadge  was  laden at the Nanyang Girls  High  School\r\n\r\nwith  food which was then delivered to strikers from\r\n\r\nthe United Engineers, the Singapore Traction Company\r\n\r\nand the Green Bus Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Union was, of course, not concerned only with\r\n\r\neducational matters and the welfare of its  members.\r\n\r\nIn  1956, it began to take a more and more prominent\r\n\r\nrole  in  political meetings organised jointly  with\r\n\r\norganisations  not for discussion but for  political\r\n\r\naction  and  agitation. On 3rd March, for  instance,\r\n\r\nthey  joined  with four cultural groups  to  protest\r\n\r\nagainst  the banning of a concert with pro-Communist\r\n\r\nitems. On the 8th of March, the President, Soon  Loh\r\n\r\nBoon, spoke at the gathering called to celebrate the\r\n\r\nCommunist  Women's  International  Day'.  For  this\r\n\r\ncelebration  the Union published a special  book  of\r\n\r\nsongs entitled We Want Peace which was based on  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  Peace Campaign. Most of  the  songs  were\r\n\r\nclearly of Russian or Chinese Communist origin.  The\r\n\r\nname  The  Great Students Union is but a  substitute\r\n\r\nfor  The  Great  Mao  Tse-tung  in  scarcely  veiled\r\n\r\ndisguise;  and The Song of the Youthful Students  is\r\n\r\ntaken  directly  from a Russian film  on  collective\r\n\r\nfarming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I will not weary you with a recital of all the\r\n\r\nmeetings  at  which the Union has collaborated  with\r\n\r\nadult  organisations to launch political attacks  on\r\n\r\nGovernment and to initiate or support some political\r\n\r\nagitation or other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it went on. Almost every day something was done\r\n\r\nor  said  which  made it clear that  the  Union  was\r\n\r\nactively\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaking  part  in politics and in trade disputes.  If\r\n\r\nanything, the tempo of activity increased; certainly\r\n\r\nan   increasingly  large  number  of  pupils  became\r\n\r\ninvolved many of them in the first place, no  doubt,\r\n\r\ninnocently. The Union became even more arrogant, and\r\n\r\ndid  not hesitate to \"persuade\" managers of schools,\r\n\r\nprincipals  and  teachers  to  fall  in  with  their\r\n\r\nwishes.  Their language became more and more  highly\r\n\r\ncoloured and exaggerated. National Service laws, for\r\n\r\ninstance,  are alleged \"to have seriously threatened\r\n\r\nthe  lives  and  safety of students and  jeopardised\r\n\r\ntheir chances of study\"; we are told that \"the foxes\r\n\r\nare  cunning  but they cannot escape the  discerning\r\n\r\neyes  of  the hunters\" and that \"the public are  not\r\n\r\nhoodwinked by the calumnies of the authorities\"; the\r\n\r\nPresident of the Union, Soon Loh Boon, demands  that\r\n\r\n\"the  bloodshed of May the 13th shall be  repaid  in\r\n\r\nblood\"; and there is more and more talk of the cruel\r\n\r\nstruggle  and  of Malaya becoming a second  Cyprus - I\r\n\r\nrepeat that: Malaya becoming a second Cyprus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Chief Minister has already said that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> All this is so familiar to\r\n\r\nthose who have had the experience of the process  of\r\n\r\nCommunist subversion elsewhere. To the normal decent\r\n\r\ncitizen of Singapore, this ranting is sickening  and\r\n\r\nhas  no  appeal. But the leaders in this conspiracy\r\n\r\nare  addressing their words not to men and women  of\r\n\r\nmature mind and sober judgment but to the masses  of\r\n\r\nyoung people in our Chinese schools and of the  less\r\n\r\nwell-educated  workers in our fields and  factories.\r\n\r\nThese  are  their first target because they  are  so\r\n\r\nmuch more vulnerable to the emotional appeals of the\r\n\r\ndemagogue and it is all the more necessary that they\r\n\r\nshould be protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the few encouraging features has been the\r\n\r\ngrowth  within  the  Chinese  middle  schools  of  a\r\n\r\nresistance  movement. This is more than  the  active\r\n\r\ngroup  which  has been responsible for  distributing\r\n\r\nanti-Communist leaflets, the members of  which  have\r\n\r\nopenly accused the Union of encroaching on their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfreedom,  defaming their character, and  threatening\r\n\r\ntheir  safety. Even if we are to rely  only  on  the\r\n\r\nevidence  of the papers published by the  Union,  it\r\n\r\nwould appear that many members have been lukewarm in\r\n\r\ntheir   support,  have  been  backward   in   paying\r\n\r\nsubscriptions, have preferred the private company of\r\n\r\ntheir  friends to union-organised parties, and  have\r\n\r\nresisted  attempts  by  the Union  to  direct  their\r\n\r\nstudies  for  them.  This, not  unnaturally,  was  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  serious  concern  to  the  Union  and  a\r\n\r\ndetermined  campaign was launched to  overcome  this\r\n\r\nopposition.  This took a number of forms,  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant of which was probably the adoption of  the\r\n\r\nwell-known Communist practice of hsueh hsi.  Now  it\r\n\r\nis  not difficult for a student of language to  give\r\n\r\nexamples  of  words which through  association  with\r\n\r\npeople  or  circumstances have acquired a completely\r\n\r\nnew significance. The words \"hsueh hsi\" are two such\r\n\r\nwords.  In  the  days before the  Chinese  Communist\r\n\r\nParty  came  into power they meant quite simply  \"to\r\n\r\nstudy and practise\".They could have been taken as  a\r\n\r\nmotto  by any school in any country anywhere in  the\r\n\r\nworld,  and  that, no doubt, is why they  have  been\r\n\r\ntaken  over by the Communist Party. For they provide\r\n\r\na   seemingly  innocent  cover  for  the  pernicious\r\n\r\nmethods they use to indoctrinate the young people of\r\n\r\nthe  country, to ensure that they should  all  think\r\n\r\nwith one mind and all speak with one voice - the voice\r\n\r\nof the Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I try to analyse more closely the theory\r\n\r\nand practice of hsueh hsi in Communist China, let me\r\n\r\ngive  you  just  one  quotation  to  show  how   the\r\n\r\nCommunists   themselves  use  hsueh  hsi   for   the\r\n\r\npropagation of their doctrine. Here is Fung Man Pan,\r\n\r\nthe  Secretary  of  the  Central  Committee  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese Communist Youth Corps, speaking at the First\r\n\r\nNational Congress of the Youth Corps:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The main task of the Youth Corps in school is to\r\n\r\nhsueh hsi - to help and lead the students' bodies  and\r\n\r\norganisations  in  carrying  out  extra   curricular\r\n\r\nactivities and hsueh hsi and to prevent the tendency\r\n\r\nto  study  for  study's sake. Members of  the  Youth\r\n\r\nCorps should hsueh hsi Marxism and Leninism and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  theories of these two isms. The ideology of Mao\r\n\r\nTse-tung should be brought to the students.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be difficult, surely, to state more\r\n\r\nbluntly  than  this that hsueh  hsi  is  to  be  the\r\n\r\nvehicle   for  the  propagation  of  the   Communist\r\n\r\nphilosophy and its Party line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us see how the Communists define hsueh\r\n\r\nhsi.  The  New  Knowledge Dictionary,  published  in\r\n\r\nChina, describes it thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A collective hsueh hsi system includes general\r\n\r\ntheory, business or trade theory and technique  and\r\n\r\npolicies  but  it  has still to be coordinated  with\r\n\r\npolitical study. There is no limitation as  to  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of persons for participation, but the  ideal\r\n\r\nis  between 8 and 15 people, and normally a meeting\r\n\r\nis  to  he  held once a week. An outline  is  to  be\r\n\r\nprepared first regarding measures for hsueh hsi, and\r\n\r\nthereafter  everyone can express his or  her  views,\r\n\r\nmake  discussions and conclusions. This  is  because\r\n\r\nthis  sort  of organised hsueh hsi urges, helps  and\r\n\r\nleads  everyone to progress in a definite direction.\r\n\r\nAt  the same time, this sort of collective hsueh hsi\r\n\r\norganisation can be utilised to carry out  criticism\r\n\r\nand  self criticism so that everyone can continually\r\n\r\nrectify  the  former  bad  habits  of  being   anti-collective  liberal,  individually  heroic,  loosely\r\n\r\nunorganised, lax and non-urgent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you read this quickly and without examining it\r\n\r\ncritically, you may be tempted to say that  you  can\r\n\r\nsee  nothing  very wrong in it. But let  us  have  a\r\n\r\ncloser look - especially at the words \"organised hsueh\r\n\r\nhsi urges, helps and leads everyone to progress in a\r\n\r\ndefinite  direction\".  In  what  direction?  In  the\r\n\r\ndirection  your individual conscience dictates?  Or\r\n\r\nthe direction agreed upon by the group by the method\r\n\r\nwe  know  as democratic discussion? No.  It  is  the\r\n\r\ndirection laid down by the Party line: if you do not\r\n\r\nagree  with it, you will be persuaded (and the  word\r\n\r\n\"persuaded\"  is  acquiring a meaning very  different\r\n\r\nfrom  what we mean by the word) to correct your  bad\r\n\r\nhabits  and through criticism and self-criticism  to\r\n\r\nadmit the error of your ways and toe the Party line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note, too, the use of cells of small numbers of\r\n\r\npupils. Why should not the normal class of 40 be the\r\n\r\nunit?  Let us see what the students themselves  have\r\n\r\nto say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Each class is divided into 3 or 4 cells to carry\r\n\r\nout  their  study. This will cure the bad habits  of\r\n\r\nsome  students who dare not say what they  think  in\r\n\r\nfront  of  many people. They will be able to  reveal\r\n\r\nall their views in the cell meetings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no escape. No individual has any right to\r\n\r\nviews  which conflict with those of the  group.  Let\r\n\r\nhim  but  try  to  defend himself and  his  fate  is\r\n\r\nalready determined.

Allegations\r\n\r\nwere  placed over our heads and we were regarded  as\r\n\r\nwild  beasts. That is why it is difficult to buy  or\r\n\r\nfind the right type of theoretical books.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who have read the long-winded perversions of\r\n\r\ntruth   which  the  Union  has  issued  and  certain\r\n\r\nsections   of   the  local  Press  have   obediently\r\n\r\npublished,  will  need  no  further  proof  of   the\r\n\r\nabsurdity of the charge that these young people have\r\n\r\nbeen  denied freedom of speech. But what, I  wonder,\r\n\r\nare  \"the correct type of theoretical books\"? Surely\r\n\r\nonly  two  kinds of books are banned - the  subversive\r\n\r\nand  the  pornographic? And since these students  of\r\n\r\nours are so violent in their outcries against yellow\r\n\r\nliterature  there can be only one answer,  that  the\r\n\r\npublications  denied  to them are  those  which  are\r\n\r\npolitically subversive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system of hsueh hsi groups adopted from\r\n\r\nCommunist  China was first introduced into Singapore\r\n\r\non a significant scale during the first phase of the\r\n\r\n\"Hsueh  Hsi\" propaganda week held in Chinese schools\r\n\r\nfrom the 25th of February to the 3rd of March. Hsueh\r\n\r\nHsi  could  not  achieve its desired end  without  a\r\n\r\ncollective life, the purpose of which is to  achieve\r\n\r\nthe collective control of the minds and thoughts  of\r\n\r\nthe  pupils.

This\r\n\r\nemphasised   the   superiority  of   collective   to\r\n\r\nindividual  study,  the need to read  about  current\r\n\r\nevents,  but  only in the right kind of  newspapers,\r\n\r\nand  the  importance of theory.  These  are  typical\r\n\r\nquotations:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In response to the call of the Chinese Middle\r\n\r\nSchools  Students' Union, the Art  Section  of  this\r\n\r\nschool  is actively starting a study cell.

They\r\n\r\nemphasise on the greater results to be obtained from\r\n\r\nindividual study. Hitherto our fellow-students  have\r\n\r\nhad  little experience in collective study. They are\r\n\r\naccustomed  to  individual self-study.  However,  if\r\n\r\nonly   the  fellow-students  are  prepared  to  give\r\n\r\ncollective  study  a  trial,  they  will  understand\r\n\r\nbetter the importance of collective study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In collective study, it is possible to improve an\r\n\r\nindividual's   defect  in  study.  Any   doubts   or\r\n\r\ndifficulties in school lessons can be brought up for\r\n\r\nall  to  discuss and analyse, thereby  avoiding  any\r\n\r\nlowering  of  the  study  spirit  and  any  loss  of\r\n\r\nconfidence  in study. Since there are so  many  good\r\n\r\npoints in a study cell for collective study,  it  is\r\n\r\nhoped   that   all  fellow-students  will   actively\r\n\r\nparticipate in collective study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must daily read the newspapers which possess a\r\n\r\nproper  standpoint and whose comments are  fair  and\r\n\r\njust.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And on theory, they have this to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Moreover theory is an important weapon with which\r\n\r\nto  reform  our thought.

Here is what it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Criticism and self-criticism are the powerful\r\n\r\nweapons  of  the  Youth  Corps  when  educating  its\r\n\r\nmembers  and the young masses with Marxism. Leninism\r\n\r\nand the ideology of Mao Tse-tung.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some who fail to understand the\r\n\r\nimportance of criticism and self-criticism. Some may\r\n\r\nhave  views of their own, but they will  not  voice\r\n\r\ntheir  opinions in the meeting. They elect  to  make\r\n\r\nlittle broadcast behind one's back. This is a rotten\r\n\r\ntype of liberalism. All the revolutionary youths and\r\n\r\ncorps  members  who are loyal to  the  corps  should\r\n\r\noppose liberalism and carry out criticism and  self-criticism.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is again a message to the Second National\r\n\r\nCongress  of the Youth Corps delivered by Liu  Shao-chi:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In order to consolidate their own organisation,\r\n\r\nthe  entire  body  of  members of  the  Chinese  New\r\n\r\nDemocratic Youth Corps must' learn how to manipulate\r\n\r\nthe method of criticism and self-criticism so as  to\r\n\r\ncarry  on  a struggle against all the bad  phenomena\r\n\r\nwhich  are  harmful to the enterprise of the  people\r\n\r\nand the undertaking of the Party.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Union has not scrupled to use Communist\r\n\r\nsources such as these to obtain material  for  its\r\n\r\nown   publications.  The  paper   \"Actively   launch\r\n\r\ncriticism  and self-criticism\", which  was  prepared\r\n\r\nfor a series of executive vacation study classes  by\r\n\r\nthe   Directing  Sub-Committee  of  the  Union,   is\r\n\r\ntypical. The bricks of Communist ideology are there\r\n\r\nunchanged though admittedly a little local cement is\r\n\r\nused  to  bind them together. But all is couched  in\r\n\r\nthis new language of 'double-talk' or 'weasel words'\r\n\r\nin  what  was  no  doubt originally  an  attempt  to\r\n\r\nconceal its meaning. If the words are taken at their\r\n\r\nface value, they are comparatively harmless: if they\r\n\r\nare  translated  from double-talk to plain  English,\r\n\r\ntheir sinister nature becomes apparent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can anyone, Sir, have the slightest doubt that\r\n\r\nthis Union has been acting, at the very least, as  a\r\n\r\nCommunist-front  organisation,   that   it   is   an\r\n\r\norganisation  designed to act as  an  instrument  of\r\n\r\nCommunist policy, an organisation whose real purpose\r\n\r\nis  masked  behind a facade of social  ideals  which\r\n\r\nmany respectable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  of  progressive  views  in  Singapore  would\r\n\r\napprove?  Though  we  have  conclusive  proof   that\r\n\r\nseveral  members  of this Union were  Communists,  a\r\n\r\nunion  might  yet be a Communist front  organisation\r\n\r\neven if it had no Communist members at all. The fact\r\n\r\nthat  there has been this direct Communist influence\r\n\r\nwithin  the  Union  merely  strengthens  the   case\r\n\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Documents found on Communist members who have been\r\n\r\narrested  show that the general policy speeches  and\r\n\r\nwritings  of  their  Communist  masters  have   been\r\n\r\nadopted  almost without modification.  There  is  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  whatever  in  my  mind  that  the  Hsueh  Hsi\r\n\r\ncampaign  in  Singapore  has  for  its  purpose  the\r\n\r\nindoctrination  of  the  children  in  our   Chinese\r\n\r\nschools   so  that  even  if  they  do  not   become\r\n\r\nCommunists,  whilst still at school,  they  will  at\r\n\r\nleast   be   so  amenable  to  persuasion   and   so\r\n\r\nconditioned  to  sink their individuality  and  obey\r\n\r\norders  that  they  will  become  easy  converts  to\r\n\r\nCommunism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far I have dealt only with the expression in\r\n\r\nspeech   or   in   writing   of   the   theory    of\r\n\r\nindoctrination.  I  must confess  I  have  found  it\r\n\r\nimpossibly  dull  and  boring,  and  have  found  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  understand how the  pupils  could  be\r\n\r\npersuaded to read or even to listen to it. They are\r\n\r\nmade  to do so partly because the doctrines  are  so\r\n\r\nsystematically and persistently put across  that  no\r\n\r\npupil  can avoid becoming acquainted with them,  and\r\n\r\npartly because the approach is made through forms of\r\n\r\nactivity which are widely and immediately popular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tactic are described in an interesting\r\n\r\ndocument  published by the Union which  is  entitled\r\n\r\n\"Enriching Study Life and increasing Study Results\".\r\n\r\nThis  paper  shows how the Communist  influence  has\r\n\r\npenetrated  into  every aspect of school  life.  The\r\n\r\nUnion  has  become almost a separate Directorate  of\r\n\r\nEducation  within  the  middle  school  system.  Its\r\n\r\nduties may be summarised under five headings: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To draw up working plans which must be\r\n\r\npracticable and suitable;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To bring about unity amongst the officers of\r\n\r\nthe Union and to emphasise the positive\r\n\r\nand creative nature of their work;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To penetrate a wide range of cultural\r\n\r\nactivities;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) To co-ordinate collective studies with\r\n\r\nrecreational activities:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) To organise the collection of subscriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will agree that it is a most comprehensive\r\n\r\nlist  which shows the very wide scope of the Union's\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To obtain a cloak of legality for these\r\n\r\nactivities, the Union has generally sought  the  co-operation of school principals or teachers. In  this\r\n\r\nway,  some  principals  have  been  led  to  support\r\n\r\nactivities  which  outwardly  appear  to  be  highly\r\n\r\ndesirable, but in fact are the means by which pupils\r\n\r\nnot  otherwise  interested in the  Union  have  been\r\n\r\ncaught in the net.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial approach was made over hsueh hsi.\r\n\r\nAfter  all,  why should the pupils not study  harder\r\n\r\nand  practise what they had studied? Any  headmaster\r\n\r\nwould  be  delighted to find his  pupils  expressing\r\n\r\ntheir  spontaneous desire to work  together  and  to\r\n\r\nwork harder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later approaches were made in different ways at\r\n\r\ndifferent  schools, the opportunity being seized  as\r\n\r\nthe  occasion arose. At Nam Hwa Girls'  School,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, the principal agreed to prune the  library\r\n\r\nof  some  light  novels which were  classed  by  the\r\n\r\npupils as yellow literature, and with her permission\r\n\r\nceremoniously   burned.  At   other   schools,   the\r\n\r\nprincipals  cooperated  with  the  Union  in  making\r\n\r\nadjustments  to  the time-table for  extracurricular\r\n\r\nactivities  so  that  the pupils  should  have  more\r\n\r\nopportunity   to  participate  in  their   favourite\r\n\r\nactivity. This enabled them \"to choose the one which\r\n\r\nentirely  fitted in with their central  resolution\".\r\n\r\nOthers  organised  class  tea-parties,  picnics  and\r\n\r\nvisits  to  the  cinema, prepared  wall  newspapers,\r\n\r\ndevised current affairs tests and fill-in-the-blanks\r\n\r\nquestionnaires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of unified direction is\r\n\r\ncontinuously  stressed. \"It is first necessary\",  we\r\n\r\nare told, \"to put on a sound\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbasis  the  entire organisational system, to  create\r\n\r\nlively  and  subtle working methods,  to  carry  out\r\n\r\nresolutions  on  propaganda work,  especially  small\r\n\r\nscale   activities  such  as  lunches,  tea-parties,\r\n\r\nplays,  visits  to  the cinema,  swimming  parties.\"\r\n\r\nThere  was even a directing sub-committee to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat resolutions (especially the Central Resolution)\r\n\r\nwere thoroughly carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Propaganda was given high priority. A Union paper\r\n\r\nentitled \"Express News\" was published. There was  no\r\n\r\nescape from it, for if you refrained from reading it\r\n\r\nyourself, you could not avoid hearing it read by the\r\n\r\nGeneral Affairs Officer either in class or over  the\r\n\r\nschool broadcasting system so generously put at  the\r\n\r\ndisposal  of  the  Union by the school  authorities.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  at  Chung  Cheng  High  School,  additional\r\n\r\nspeakers were installed to cover those parts of  the\r\n\r\ngarden where 'unco-operative' pupils could find  some\r\n\r\nrespite from the insistent propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in his own home the pupil was not safe from\r\n\r\nthese  zealous  young  men,  for  parties  would  be\r\n\r\norganised  to visit him and his parents to  persuade\r\n\r\nthem of the joys of collective activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor were the teachers free from these visits of\r\n\r\npersuasion,  though the Union appears  to  have  had\r\n\r\nless  success  with them than with  the  pupils  and\r\n\r\ntheir  parents. Nevertheless, they had  selected  36\r\n\r\nteachers from Chung Cheng School for repeated visits\r\n\r\nby  officers of the Union. My hon. friends will,  no\r\n\r\ndoubt,  be  aware  also  of  the  pressure  recently\r\n\r\nbrought  to  bear by the Union on the principals  of\r\n\r\ntwo  schools  to dismiss two teachers who  were  not\r\n\r\nacceptable  to  them.  Of course,  there  were  some\r\n\r\nteachers  who  collaborated with the Union,  notably\r\n\r\nthe two deans of the Chung Cheng School against whom\r\n\r\nbanishment orders were recently made. On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  many  teachers have steadfastly resisted  the\r\n\r\npersistent pressure of the Union and they should  be\r\n\r\ncongratulated  on  having taken a stand  which  must\r\n\r\nhave called for a good deal of courage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Union has not used these methods of\r\n\r\nintimidation  only against individual  teachers  and\r\n\r\npupils. They have used\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsimilar methods perhaps even more blatantly,  as  an\r\n\r\ninstrument  of general education policy,  a  policy,\r\n\r\nneedless to say, which was directly opposed to  that\r\n\r\nof  this  Government.  Members  of  the  Union  have\r\n\r\nvisited  nearly all the Chinese primary  schools  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to persuade them not to accept full  aid.\r\n\r\nYet  the President, Soon Loh Boon, applied specially\r\n\r\nto  teach in a fully aided school.

There  was  also  a\r\n\r\ncampaign  to  intimidate these managers to  withdraw\r\n\r\ntheir  application for full aid and they also spread\r\n\r\nunfounded  rumours that these managers had  accepted\r\n\r\nbribes from the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for \"Enriching School Life\". I think you\r\n\r\nwill  agree, Sir, that this is a horrifying  picture\r\n\r\nand  that corruption of school life would be a  much\r\n\r\nmore  suitable title. It is difficult to find  words\r\n\r\nadequate  to  describe the depths  of  depravity  to\r\n\r\nwhich  those  who  are behind these  activities  are\r\n\r\nprepared to sink. The Communist is amoral and  quite\r\n\r\nruthless.  For him there is no future  life  and  no\r\n\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end justifies the means, however revolting,\r\n\r\nand  I  find  it difficult to imagine anything  more\r\n\r\nvile and pernicious than the corruption of the minds\r\n\r\nof  young  children of which I have been  trying  to\r\n\r\ngive  you a picture. Some hon. Members may  find  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  believe that  it  can  all  be  true.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  it  is true and when  one  begins  to\r\n\r\nanalyse  these facts, I am sure one will shudder  at\r\n\r\nthe subtle and ruthless methods perpetrated by these\r\n\r\nCommunists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other method the Union has recently\r\n\r\nstarted  to  use  to  ensure that  the  thoughts  of\r\n\r\nmembers are channelled in one direction. I refer  to\r\n\r\nthe  Question Papers that the Union has  set,  quite\r\n\r\nillegally,  for  pupils  to answer.  Some  of  these\r\n\r\nQuestion  Papers were given on a Friday  to  pupils.\r\n\r\nPupils were asked to return home and hand back those\r\n\r\nPapers  on the following Monday. In the White  Paper\r\n\r\ntabled  before  the  Assembly,  you  will  find  the\r\n\r\nAppendices  attached  to it showing  the  nature  of\r\n\r\nthose  questions. At a first glance, some  of  these\r\n\r\nquestions are quite harmless and it would indeed  be\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  take  any single question  and  state\r\n\r\ncategorically    that   it   was   politically    or\r\n\r\neducationally objectionable. There are a few  purely\r\n\r\nfactual  questions which are probably included  only\r\n\r\nto lend a cloak of respectability to the papers; but\r\n\r\nmost  are questions which require the expression  of\r\n\r\nan  opinion.  The  papers  are  indeed  but  another\r\n\r\nsearchlight  which can be turned on to the  mind  of\r\n\r\nthe  student, so that any deviation from the correct\r\n\r\npath can be quickly revealed and dealt with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That then is the picture. I have shown how the\r\n\r\nUnion  was a Communist-front organisation which  not\r\n\r\nonly  acted  as an instrument for Chinese  Communist\r\n\r\npolicy   but   had   indeed  been   infiltrated   by\r\n\r\nCommunists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dealing with this evil, the Government must\r\n\r\nhave  the  support  of  every  loyal  citizen,   and\r\n\r\nespecially  of  those  parents  and  teachers  whose\r\n\r\nimmediate  problem it is to discipline  these  young\r\n\r\npeople  and  restore them to sanity.  In  the  past,\r\n\r\nmanagers  and  teachers  have  been  wont  to  blame\r\n\r\nGovernment's   inactivity  for  their   disciplinary\r\n\r\ntroubles.  They  have said that by  registering  the\r\n\r\nUnion,  the  Government indicated its approval,  and\r\n\r\nthough in this they were mistaken, there is yet some\r\n\r\njustification  for  the  charge  that   Government's\r\n\r\ndecision to register the Union did indeed add to the\r\n\r\nschools'  disciplinary troubles. Now that excuse  is\r\n\r\nno longer valid and it is hoped that they will rally\r\n\r\nto Government's support. The parents, too, have been\r\n\r\nnot  altogether free from blame. Many  have  allowed\r\n\r\ntheir  children to get out of hand,  and  they  must\r\n\r\nlose  no  time  in re-asserting their  authority  if\r\n\r\ntheir   children  are  not  to  be  lost   to   them\r\n\r\naltogether.  The Chief Minister has set  a  lead  in\r\n\r\ncourage and devotion to the people of Singapore. Now\r\n\r\nis  the time for all who have the well-being of  our\r\n\r\nyoung  people  at  heart to rally  at  once  to  his\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing which I must make perfectly\r\n\r\nclear  to everyone who is concerned about the future\r\n\r\nof  Chinese  education. The operation the Government\r\n\r\nhas had to perform to remove the cancer of Communism\r\n\r\nfrom the Chinese middle schools was designed to cure\r\n\r\nthe  patient,  not to kill him. The  Government  has\r\n\r\nrepeatedly expressed its determination, as far as it\r\n\r\nlies   in  its  power,  to  give  equal  educational\r\n\r\nopportunity  to every child and equal  treatment  to\r\n\r\nall  kinds of schools; and it has followed up  these\r\n\r\nwords  with  deeds. It has gone to the root  of  the\r\n\r\nproblem   by  providing  courses  of  training   and\r\n\r\nconditions  of service for Chinese teachers  exactly\r\n\r\nparallel to those for other teachers; it has offered\r\n\r\nfull  grant  in aid to approved Chinese  schools  on\r\n\r\nexactly  the same conditions as those that apply  to\r\n\r\nEnglish  schools. If anyone dares to  say  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   is   discriminating   against   Chinese\r\n\r\neducation  or is trying to destroy Chinese  culture,\r\n\r\nthen I throw the words back in his face. The actions\r\n\r\nthat  your  Government has taken and the  conditions\r\n\r\nunder which Government aid will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  given  have one important aim in common-to  keep\r\n\r\nalive  what  is  good  and what  is  `universal'  in\r\n\r\nChinese art and literature. This cancer that we  are\r\n\r\ndetermined to root out is evil, it is a deadly evil.\r\n\r\nI hope, Mr Speaker, Sir, that not only hon. Members\r\n\r\nin this House, but every loyal pupil and every loyal\r\n\r\nparent  of every pupil will fight boldly and without\r\n\r\nremission   to   eliminate  this   evil   from   our\r\n\r\neducational system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is our decision, the decision of the elected\r\n\r\nGovernment of Singapore. It was a decision taken  in\r\n\r\nthe  interests  of our children in our  schools.  We\r\n\r\nknow  the heartache that the influence of the  Union\r\n\r\nupon  their children has brought into the very  many\r\n\r\nhomes  in Singapore, and we are quite sure that  the\r\n\r\nvery   great  majority  of  parents  were  immensely\r\n\r\nrelieved when the Government at last faced up to its\r\n\r\nresponsibilities. This was no hasty decision. It was\r\n\r\na  decision  based  on a great mass  of  accumulated\r\n\r\nevidence which left no doubt whatever that the Union\r\n\r\nwas  an  organisation penetrated by  Communists  and\r\n\r\nwhose  continued  existence  is  a  menace  to  this\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now proceed by touching upon the reasons for the\r\n\r\narrests  of  the  teachers. Knowing  the  importance\r\n\r\nwhich  the Chinese Communist Government attaches  to\r\n\r\nthe indoctrination of school children, it can be  no\r\n\r\nsurprise  to  hon. Members that 5 of the  7  persons\r\n\r\narrested  on  Banishment or  Detention  Orders  were\r\n\r\nteachers  in  Chinese schools. The grounds  for  the\r\n\r\narrests  are not necessarily directly or  indirectly\r\n\r\nconnected  with  their work in the schools.  Against\r\n\r\nsome  of them, there is conclusive proof that  their\r\n\r\nactivities  were  contrary to the interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of the colony, quite apart from the influence\r\n\r\nthey  brought to bear upon the pupils of the schools\r\n\r\nin  which  they taught. Cheng Meng Hui and Pang  Sui\r\n\r\nSong  were  in positions of great responsibility  in\r\n\r\nthe  Chung Cheng Main School which, as you must have\r\n\r\nheard,  was  perhaps the most seriously affected  of\r\n\r\nall middle schools. Chen Meng Hui was the Dean\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Discipline - surely an ironical title because,  as\r\n\r\nyou  all know, there had been little attempt in that\r\n\r\nschool to exert any authority which conflicted  with\r\n\r\nthe wishes of the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I am well aware of  the  great\r\n\r\npotentialities of the thousands of boys and girls in\r\n\r\nour  middle schools who have quite honestly believed\r\n\r\nthat  they were doing the right thing.

In  the  whole   of\r\n\r\npolitical history, to the man who holds the gun, the\r\n\r\nother   man  is  a  subversive  element.   That   is\r\n\r\neverywhere.  Take,  for  example,  Indo-China.  When\r\n\r\nFrance  was ruling North IndoChina, they  said  that\r\n\r\ncertain other people were subversive elements.  When\r\n\r\nthose  people took over, the Prince and  the  people\r\n\r\nwho  supported French rule were subversive elements.\r\n\r\nToday,  you  are holding the gun and you are  ruling\r\n\r\nthe  people.  You  say  that  there  are  subversive\r\n\r\nelements.  When they come to power,  they  will  say\r\n\r\nthat  you are the subversive element. So I say  that\r\n\r\nthe Hon. the Chief Minister should think it over and\r\n\r\nchoose to rule by the will of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said, Sir, that the Hon. the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister was an innocent victim in the hands of some\r\n\r\nof  the men in his Cabinet who control the levers of\r\n\r\npower  but  I  am not going to repeat those  charges\r\n\r\nhere.

There  is\r\n\r\nalso  the lesson to study that there is no place  in\r\n\r\nAsia  for Asians who have axes to grind with  Europe\r\n\r\nor for that matter with Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know, Sir, what happened to the stooges of\r\n\r\nIndo-China  but  I do not think that  the  situation\r\n\r\nwill  arise here if we all abide by the rule of  the\r\n\r\nlaw  but  if the Government takes the law  in  their\r\n\r\nhands,  it will open an avenue for others to do  the\r\n\r\nsame  and  that was precisely what had  happened  in\r\n\r\nIndo-China.   Indo-China  has  fought  against   the\r\n\r\nbackground  of colonial slumber slowly  waking  from\r\n\r\nthe  sleep of centuries but today Asians slumber  no\r\n\r\nmore.  They  are quite alert and they are  ready  to\r\n\r\nfight  for their rights and I hope that the colonial\r\n\r\nGovernment will have a new approach to the situation\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  because it has been said  that  these\r\n\r\narrests  were  made in the name  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It  is only a pretension. These  arrests\r\n\r\nwere made in the name of British vested interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will end this speech with a quotation from\r\n\r\nMr  Alfred  Robin, the Labour spokesman on  foreign\r\n\r\npolicy of the British Parliament, when he warned the\r\n\r\nBritish  Government against using force in the  Suez\r\n\r\nCanal crisis:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Remember there will be a day when Asia will ring\r\n\r\ndown  an  iron  curtain against Europeans,  when  no\r\n\r\nEuropean will be allowed to set foot in Asia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf  that  was  a  warning given  by  a  European  to\r\n\r\nEuropean adventurers, what shall I say to Asians who\r\n\r\nlend   themselves  as  stooges  to  these   European\r\n\r\nadventurers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not only I oppose the amendment but I declare\r\n\r\nin  this  House  that I am supporting  the  original\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have\r\n\r\nheard  the  tirades  of  the People's  Action  Party\r\n\r\naccusing     Government     of     having      acted\r\n\r\nundemocratically,   and   strong,   courageous   and\r\n\r\nconvincing answers from the Hon. the Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nand the Minister for Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are the people who have resorted to subversive\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  undermine our democratic institutions?\r\n\r\nWho  are  the  people who try to take the  law  into\r\n\r\ntheir own hands for their own evil purposes? Not the\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  Ministers, in our view, but those  very\r\n\r\npeople whom it has been necessary for the Council of\r\n\r\nMinisters to detain. However repugnant it is for any\r\n\r\ngovernment  to  use its powers of detention  without\r\n\r\ntrial - and  one  wonders  whether  the  P.A.P. would\r\n\r\nreally find it repugnant if they were in power - there\r\n\r\nare times and occasions when such a decision has  to\r\n\r\nbe  made to protect the democratic institutions  and\r\n\r\nthe democratic way of life of 1\ufffd million people in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  And the only way to give them protection\r\n\r\nis  to deal summarily with a handful of persons  who\r\n\r\nnot  only  have no love for democracy  but  seek  to\r\n\r\ndestroy   it.   The  vast  majority  of  law-abiding\r\n\r\ncitizens  cannot be sacrificed to the tiny  minority\r\n\r\nwho  wish  to  flout law and order  and  to  promote\r\n\r\nconditions of chaos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representatives of the People's Action Party\r\n\r\noutside  this House have advanced the argument  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government's action should have been  submitted\r\n\r\nto  a  people's referendum on the ground  that  this\r\n\r\nAssembly is unrepresentative of the people. That  is\r\n\r\npure  nonsense.  It  only serves to  underline  this\r\n\r\ngroup's contempt for a democratic form of government\r\n\r\nwe   have  learned  in  this  Assembly  proudly  and\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  to foster. The 25 elected  Members  of\r\n\r\nthis Assembly who claim to be the representatives of\r\n\r\nthe   people  were  elected  about  18  months  ago.\r\n\r\nWhatever the People's Action Party likes to say,  we\r\n\r\nrepresent  them now, and our verdict in  this  House\r\n\r\ntoday is the voice of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Sir, as an elected Member of this House,\r\n\r\nI  bring this mandate from my constituency, not from\r\n\r\nthe  residential section which is solidly behind the\r\n\r\nGovernment, but from the much larger numbers of non-English-speaking people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  my  rural  districts.

If drastic  action  is\r\n\r\nneeded, take it and we will back you.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps I may put this mandate which I hold\r\n\r\nto my hon.

We are\r\n\r\nfully  behind the Government in this matter, but  if\r\n\r\nmy  hon.  Friends  opposite  waver  in  firmness  or\r\n\r\njustice  or vigilance, it is our duty and our  right\r\n\r\nas an Opposition party to criticise any shortcomings\r\n\r\nand to hold them to the course that they have taken.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  if we all remain firm, I have no  cause  to\r\n\r\nthink that they will waver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister and his colleagues\r\n\r\nbear  a heavy responsibility.

What are these actions? Have they  broken\r\n\r\nany of the laws of this country? If they have broken\r\n\r\nany  laws and the Government has evidence, then  why\r\n\r\nis the Government afraid to try these persons in the\r\n\r\ncourts  of  law? The action of the Government,  Sir,\r\n\r\nhas  made  many people in the country  believe  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no evidence against them. There are  only\r\n\r\nsome  Police reports but the Police reports are  not\r\n\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are told that we are protecting democracy. Is\r\n\r\nthere democracy in this House or in this country? In\r\n\r\nevery  democratic country, Sir, the  courts  of  law\r\n\r\nprotect the citizens from the high-handed actions of\r\n\r\npoliticians  and policemen. If this  is  true,  then\r\n\r\nthis country is not a democracy and the Government's\r\n\r\naction has made it even less so. The Government says\r\n\r\nthat  this  is acting within the law. So did  Hitler\r\n\r\nand all the tyrants justify their actions. They made\r\n\r\nlaws    that   justified   their   highhanded    and\r\n\r\ndeliberately repressive actions and said that  their\r\n\r\nactions were legal. This is what our Government  has\r\n\r\ndone.  They  have  used the laws that  our  colonial\r\n\r\nmasters made and used for the purpose of getting rid\r\n\r\nof  people.  We have set these laws against  persons\r\n\r\nwhose  only  crime  is that they disagree  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.

For that matter,\r\n\r\nshe is more a part of this country than many who say\r\n\r\nthat  she  is an alien. If she is an alien,  then  a\r\n\r\nvery large number of the people of this country  are\r\n\r\naliens  and  all  of  them are in  danger  of  being\r\n\r\nbanished if they disagree with the Government.  Even\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  some of them are  citizens  of  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom  and the Colonies will  not  protect\r\n\r\nthem if they are not born here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, such injustice has been used on\r\n\r\nthe  people by the Government and yet they say  that\r\n\r\nthis is in the interest of the people. They say that\r\n\r\nthey  are convinced and that therefore there  is  no\r\n\r\nneed  to  go  to the courts of law. Are they  afraid\r\n\r\nthat  the Judges will not be convinced? When justice\r\n\r\nis  banned by politicians and the courts of law  are\r\n\r\nneglected, then we have the beginning of Fascism and\r\n\r\nFascism  does  not stop at even such arrests  or  70\r\n\r\narrests  or 1,000 arrests. It will go on  until  its\r\n\r\nopponents are crushed and there is nobody to  oppose\r\n\r\nthe  will  of those who rule. Why has the Government\r\n\r\nwhich represents only a minority of the people  done\r\n\r\nthis?  Some  say that this is to please the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment   so   that  the  next  talks   will   be\r\n\r\nsuccessful. They say that the Government  is  trying\r\n\r\nto  prove  to the British Government that  they  are\r\n\r\nwilling  and  able to do its dirty work.  There  are\r\n\r\nothers who say that this is the beginning of a  plan\r\n\r\nto  arrest  as  many as possible of  those  who  are\r\n\r\nopposed to the Labour Front and the British so  that\r\n\r\nwhen the next elections come, the discredited Labour\r\n\r\nFront  will have no opposition. Probably, both these\r\n\r\nviews  are true because pleasing the Colonial Office\r\n\r\nand  smashing the anti-colonial forces are the  same\r\n\r\nthings,  making Singapore safe for the Labour  Front\r\n\r\nand   making   Singapore  safe   for   the   British\r\n\r\nGovernment.  These  are both  the  same  thing.  The\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore who are prepared to fight  the\r\n\r\nBritish are also prepared to fight the Labour Front.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. J.

The Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  and  the  other elected Members  are  also\r\n\r\nfully  aware of the gravity of the penalty, and  the\r\n\r\ngravity of the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has stated on every occasion\r\n\r\nand  again today in the most clear terms the  reason\r\n\r\nfor  the decision of Government in dealing with  the\r\n\r\npersons concerned, and the banned associations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education has also given us a very full statement. There is not the slightest doubt in our minds and in the minds of those people who love Singapore and are interested in the welfare of Singapore that what Government has done is right. The only exceptions are naturally those groups\r\n\r\ncontrolled  by \"brilliantly coloured\" agitators.

The\r\n\r\nGovernment's   action  is  a  monstrous   abuse   of\r\n\r\narbitrary  powers. The Labour Front  Government  has\r\n\r\nhad  occasion prior to the 1955 elections to condemn\r\n\r\nthe   arbitrary  powers  vested  in  the  hands   of\r\n\r\nGovernment. We all know the details\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the manner in which the Preservation of  Public\r\n\r\nSecurity  Bill was enacted into law. There was  talk\r\n\r\nthen that the powers under this Ordinance would only\r\n\r\nbe used against anti-democratic forces. The Hon.the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister has openly stated to the public  and\r\n\r\nto  the Press that the recent arrests of leaders  of\r\n\r\ntrade unions and other organisations had nothing  to\r\n\r\ndo with the bodies concerned. Whom does he expect to\r\n\r\nfool?  A  few months ago, a branch chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nArmy  Civil  Service Union was arrested  soon  after\r\n\r\nhaving  successfully settled an industrial  dispute.\r\n\r\nAnd now the Banishment Ordinance is used in place of\r\n\r\nthe  Preservation of Public Security Ordinance.  The\r\n\r\neffect is absolutely the same. Arbitrary powers  are\r\n\r\nused    against    trade   unionists    and    other\r\n\r\norganisations. Three associations have been  banned.\r\n\r\nWhat,  may  we  know,  are  the  reasons  for   such\r\n\r\nundemocratic and pro-colonial measures? Why has  our\r\n\r\nChief  Minister started talking loud and tough after\r\n\r\nhis  visit to Mr Alan Lennox-Boyd? Has he  come  to\r\n\r\nany form of arrangement whereby some form of Merdeka\r\n\r\nmight  be  secured? Is he preparing the  way  for  a\r\n\r\ncompromise?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if undemocratic measures are going to be used\r\n\r\nagainst  the  people and organisations in  order  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy  the Colonial Office, then it must  be  made\r\n\r\nclear to the Government that such measures shall  be\r\n\r\nresisted   to   the   very  end  by   peaceful   and\r\n\r\nconstitutional means. I must urge the Government  to\r\n\r\ntake  heed of peaceful and constitutional resistance\r\n\r\nto  their  arbitrary  use of  powers.  Peaceful  and\r\n\r\nconstitutional resistance must be respected for,  if\r\n\r\nthey  are  not, other forms of resistance may  prove\r\n\r\ntempting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In justification of the Government's action, the\r\n\r\nHon. the Chief Minister claims to have the  support\r\n\r\nof  the  people  of  Singapore for  his  action.

I  am\r\n\r\ninformed,  Sir, by the Naval Base Labour Union  that\r\n\r\nin  reply to a letter of protest against the  recent\r\n\r\narbitrary arrest, the Hon.the Chief Minister stated\r\n\r\nthat  the  Trades Union Congress had expressed  full\r\n\r\ncon-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfidence in the Government.

The  Hon.the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister, of course, had waited  until  after\r\n\r\nthe  Trades Union Congress meeting to reply  to  the\r\n\r\nNaval Base Labour Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a point of information,\r\n\r\nSir.  The Naval Base Labour Union never wrote to  me\r\n\r\nuntil  the support of the Trades Union Congress  was\r\n\r\nreported in the Press. Do not distort facts.  I  can\r\n\r\ntake a lot but -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> It is true, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> No, it is not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong:</b> A fact is a fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> We all know, Sir, that\r\n\r\nthe support of the Trades Union Congress is a farce,\r\n\r\nI  repeat \"it is a farce\". The Trades Union Congress\r\n\r\nclaims to represent 52,000 workers at least, so  the\r\n\r\nPress informs us. All the major trade unions in  the\r\n\r\nCongress - the  Army  Civil  Service  Union,  the  Air\r\n\r\nMinistry Local Staff Union and the Singapore Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  Staff Association - have clearly stated in  the\r\n\r\npast  that  they  are against arbitrary  arrest  and\r\n\r\ndetention  of trade union leaders. Other members  of\r\n\r\nthe   Trades  Union  Congress  have  also  expressed\r\n\r\nsimilar  views but, unfortunately, Sir, these  views\r\n\r\nhave  not  been given space or publicity in  certain\r\n\r\nsections  of  the  Press, particularly  the  English\r\n\r\nPress who are now cheering on our Chief Minister  to\r\n\r\nfurther  acts  of  repression.  In  case  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister and Members of the Government have  cheated\r\n\r\nthemselves into believing that they have  even  some\r\n\r\nmeasure  of  public support, I would  urge  them  to\r\n\r\naccept  the challenge made by the representative  of\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  Factory  and  Shop  Workers'  Union\r\n\r\nrecently to the Chief Minister, the challenge  being\r\n\r\nto  hold  another election throughout the island  of\r\n\r\nSingapore or just in Havelock Division. That is  our\r\n\r\nchallenge  to  him  to  prove  that  he  has  public\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude with the remarks\r\n\r\nthat these recent arrests will go down in the annals\r\n\r\nof   this  country's  history  as  a  great  act  of\r\n\r\nindiscretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nalthough I may sound selfish, I must confess I  have\r\n\r\nnever  felt  so  happy to be an Independent  Member,\r\n\r\nespecially on this most controversial issue. We have\r\n\r\nheard  two  sides of the argument this morning.  One\r\n\r\nside   charges  that  the  actions  taken   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have  merely been  with  the  object  of\r\n\r\nwearing  down  the strength of the  P.A.P.,  thereby\r\n\r\npaving  the way to victory for the Labour  Front  in\r\n\r\nthe  coming  elections. This side also  charges  the\r\n\r\nHon. the  Chief Minister as being a stooge  of  the\r\n\r\ncolonial  power.  On the other  hand,  we  have  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  side explaining to this House  that  the\r\n\r\nactions they have taken have been with the object of\r\n\r\nwiping  out the Communist-front organisations.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment have also charged the Member for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar, the mover of the original motion, as being  a\r\n\r\nCommunist stooge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since Government took action in the matter, I\r\n\r\nhave  received many letters and representations from\r\n\r\nall  walks of life saying, \"You must not touch  this\r\n\r\nquestion.  This  is  high  politics.  It   is   very\r\n\r\ndangerous  if  you do. You might even endanger  your\r\n\r\nlife.\"  I  have also received one bit of information\r\n\r\nconcerning  an hon. Member who has been  called  the\r\n\r\nchampion  of the people. This is to the effect  that\r\n\r\nhe  also  supports  the  Government's  action,  but,\r\n\r\nbecause  of his Party Whip, he has not dared  openly\r\n\r\nto  declare his support. He is one of our  prominent\r\n\r\nleaders. Sir, I think I am most lucky in that I  can\r\n\r\nspeak  as  an Independent Member without having  any\r\n\r\nParty Whip to whip me to speak for the Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning we have heard many words and phrases\r\n\r\nlike  \"democracy\", \"the people\", \"civil  liberties\",\r\n\r\n\"peaceful  democratic means\", \"mass  organisations\",\r\n\r\netc. Each side selects its own evidence and the rest\r\n\r\nof  the  hon. Members, depending on their  point  of\r\n\r\nview,  are either pleased or dismayed. The  struggle\r\n\r\nis  now  on  for the battle of men's  minds.  But  I\r\n\r\nshould like to say this,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir.  There is now no room for indifference. We  are\r\n\r\nall in it, Sir, although in the nature of things  we\r\n\r\ndislike  being made to think, to act or  to  support\r\n\r\none   group   or   the  other.  But  after   serious\r\n\r\nconsideration,  Sir, I must admit  that  I  have  to\r\n\r\nsupport  the  Government's  action  which,  although\r\n\r\nregrettable,   is  inevitable.  I  say   regrettable\r\n\r\nbecause I recall the political climate that  we  had\r\n\r\nat  the  last  sitting of this  House  which  won  a\r\n\r\nunanimous vote of confidence for the Government. And\r\n\r\nnow  we suddenly have a storm, and a clear split  in\r\n\r\nthis  House is obvious. Although I am not  a  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  member, Sir, I did hear candidates from  that\r\n\r\nParty  during the last elections telling the  people\r\n\r\nthat  their Party was not happy about the Banishment\r\n\r\nOrdinance  and  the Emergency Regulations  and  they\r\n\r\npromised the people that if they were returned, they\r\n\r\nwould  repeal or review these two measures. But  now\r\n\r\nthe  Labour  Front finds that it has  to  use  these\r\n\r\nunpopular and undemocratic measures in the interests\r\n\r\nof the people. What is also regrettable is that I am\r\n\r\nafraid that among the arrested persons there was,  I\r\n\r\nthink, at least one whom I would term as a political\r\n\r\nscapegoat. I believe many of the real leaders of the\r\n\r\nsubversive elements are still at large. I will  take\r\n\r\nthis opportunity to quote one example of what I term\r\n\r\na political scapegoat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chen Kwang Fung was one of those arrested. He was the Chairman of the Chinese Primary School Teachers' Union. I wonder if the Government can give me an assurance that his arrest had nothing to do with his activities in the field of Chinese education. Sir, I have personal knowledge that after\r\n\r\nthe  publication of the Government  White  Paper  on\r\n\r\nChinese  Education, Chinese education  circles  have\r\n\r\nhad  fears and worries over the Government's policy.\r\n\r\nI do not know how many times I have said it - that the\r\n\r\nChinese are really worried over Government's  policy\r\n\r\non  Chinese education and their doubts and fears  up\r\n\r\ntill  now have still not been removed. Although  the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  Government's policy  on  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation  has not gathered full force, the  Chinese\r\n\r\ncommunity  is still worried. If the Chinese  schools\r\n\r\naccept the full aid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nscheme, the future of Chinese education, they  fear,\r\n\r\nwill not be secure. Although the full aid scheme has\r\n\r\nbeen  in  operation for at least two  years  now,  I\r\n\r\nthink  slightly over a hundred Chinese schools  have\r\n\r\naccepted it. Therefore recently I was approached  by\r\n\r\nmany  Chinese educational circles, and one  of  them\r\n\r\nwas  Mr Chen Kwang Fung, on how best to tackle this\r\n\r\nproblem. I felt that it was not the time for  us  to\r\n\r\noppose the full aid scheme. I said that the best way\r\n\r\nto  tackle the problem was to call a meeting of  all\r\n\r\nChinese  school principals and management committees\r\n\r\nto  discuss how we were going to accept the full aid\r\n\r\nscheme  and how we were going to secure an assurance\r\n\r\nfrom the Government that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The school committees' administrative power\r\n\r\nwould not be jeopardised;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That their curriculum would not be jeopardised\r\n\r\ntoo;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the opening up of classes was also not to\r\n\r\nbe limited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, on the question of Malayanisation of\r\n\r\nChinese  textbooks, we desired to seek clarification\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Government on the word  \"Malayanisation\".\r\n\r\nThe  Chinese are afraid that the Government is going\r\n\r\nto  use  the  opportunity  of  malayanising  Chinese\r\n\r\ntextbooks to lower their standards. They are  afraid\r\n\r\nbecause, for over a year now, the Government has not\r\n\r\nsincerely   carried  out  the  policy  of  bilingual\r\n\r\neducation.  They  feel it has now become  one-sided.\r\n\r\nSir,  bilingual education has already proved  to  be\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in  Chinese schools but not  in  English\r\n\r\nschools. The extent of the Chinese, Malay and  Tamil\r\n\r\nlanguages   taught   in  the  English   schools   is\r\n\r\ninsufficient  to  convince  the  Chinese  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  promise of equality in the  sphere  of\r\n\r\neducation for all races is being fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am just wondering whether\r\n\r\nthe hon. Member can indicate how that is relevant to\r\n\r\nthe motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, these remarks have been\r\n\r\nmade  because  I  think it is my duty  to  find  out\r\n\r\nwhether  Mr Chen Kwang Fung's arrest was  connected\r\n\r\nwith  the  activities of the proposed calling  of  a\r\n\r\nChinese school conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,  I  have personal knowledge of Mr Chen  Kwang\r\n\r\nFung.  So, Sir, based on all the facts that  I  have\r\n\r\nstated  above, we felt that the calling of a Chinese\r\n\r\nschool  conference was very urgent and essential  in\r\n\r\ndiscussing  the Government full aid scheme.  It  was\r\n\r\nnot  a  political  manoeuvre, nor  was  the  meeting\r\n\r\ncalled for political interests. We did not intend to\r\n\r\ngo round to people and say, \"We must oppose the full\r\n\r\naid  scheme. Anything that the Government  does,  we\r\n\r\nmust oppose.\" We did not mean that. I convinced  Mr\r\n\r\nChen  Kwang  Fung  that we must hold  a  meeting  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss the matter and at the same time seek certain\r\n\r\nassurances from the Government. But we did not  call\r\n\r\na conference in order to oppose the Government. Sir,\r\n\r\nI just wish to seek an assurance from the Government\r\n\r\nthat  the  arrest  of Mr Chen Kwang  Fung  was  not\r\n\r\nconnected  with  this proposal  to  hold  a  Chinese\r\n\r\nschool conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me touch on what I have said, that it was\r\n\r\ninevitable that Government should take the action it\r\n\r\ndid. Why inevitable? Because the extremist movement\r\n\r\n(I  am  not a Member of the Government, so I  cannot term  it as subversive or Communist - moreover,  I  do not  know what that is) after 2nd April has terribly\r\n\r\njeopardised  the stability of this country.  It  has\r\n\r\ndefinitely  not  done any good for the  independence\r\n\r\nmovement, and I think it should be checked in  time.\r\n\r\nIt  is  up  to the Government to do it at the  right\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now wish to say a few worth about public\r\n\r\nopinion. Just now we have heard one side say that it\r\n\r\nis  doing  this  and that in the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.. But the other side says, \"No, that  is  not\r\n\r\nin  the  interests of the people.\" Unfortunately,  I\r\n\r\nhave to admit that the Member for Tanjong Pagar  and\r\n\r\nthe  Member sitting behind him and their  Party  are\r\n\r\nclosely  connected with the dissolved  organisations\r\n\r\nand  the  arrested  persons. As  an  Independent,  I\r\n\r\nshould like to say that they should not claim to  be\r\n\r\ndoing things in the interests of the people when, in\r\n\r\nfact,  they are doing them in the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party. I take this opportunity  to'\r\n\r\nsay this: If any organisations or any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleaders   want   to   claim  themselves   as   civic\r\n\r\norganisations or civic leaders, they should  clearly\r\n\r\ncut  themselves away from any political connections.\r\n\r\nThese organisations should bear in mind that if they\r\n\r\nwant   to   fight   for   their   stand   as   civic\r\n\r\norganisations,  they  should never  enter  politics.\r\n\r\nAlso,  these  civic leaders should not become  their\r\n\r\nadvisers.  Do not use these organisations for  party\r\n\r\ninterests. If there is a civic leader who  wants  to\r\n\r\nsupport your Party, then invite him to enrol as your\r\n\r\nParty  member. But these organisations  and  leaders\r\n\r\nshould not go round telling the people, \"No, we  are\r\n\r\nfighting  for all. We are fighting for  liberty  for\r\n\r\nall.  We  are not fighting for party interests.\"  We\r\n\r\ncannot    deny   the   fact   that   the   dissolved\r\n\r\norganisations and the arrested persons were  closely\r\n\r\nconnected with a political Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to tell the Government the true facts,\r\n\r\nand  that  is, that the feelings among  the  Parties\r\n\r\nover  this  issue  are  clearly  divided - among   the\r\n\r\nintellectuals, between the English-educated and  the\r\n\r\nChinese-educated. Feelings are also divided  between\r\n\r\nthe  intelligentsia and the illiterate. Sir, I  wish\r\n\r\nthe  Government would take note that the masses have\r\n\r\nlong   been  wooed  and  controlled  by  a   certain\r\n\r\nextremist group and this group is irresponsible  and\r\n\r\ndoes  not  have the real interests of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. Therefore, the illiterate masses must  be\r\n\r\nwell  informed in the most effective way and by  the\r\n\r\nquickest means possible. Sir, with this in  view,  I\r\n\r\nurge  the  Government  to  make  its  actions  fully\r\n\r\nunderstood by the public. I think the easiest way to\r\n\r\ndo  this is to consider releasing certain details in\r\n\r\nthe report of the findings of these arrests and,  if\r\n\r\npossible, when these people appeal (I am very  happy\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government has accepted  their  appeals),\r\n\r\nthat  every elected Minister should sink  his  party\r\n\r\ninterests and consider every case according  to  his\r\n\r\nconscience. I hope they will be given a fair  trial,\r\n\r\nand  that  those  who are proved  innocent  will  be\r\n\r\nreleased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also like a repeat assurance from the\r\n\r\nHon.the Chief Minister that his Government's recent\r\n\r\nactions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  been taken in the interests of the people  and\r\n\r\nhave nothing to do with these three factors:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Party politics;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) As a result of influence brought to bear by\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the Chief Secretary, especially from  the\r\n\r\nSpecial Branch;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) As a result of an inducement from the British\r\n\r\nColonial Secretary, Mr Lennox-Boyd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder how many times I have stressed the\r\n\r\nimportance of unity in our independence movement.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  how  many  times  I  have  appealed  to  all\r\n\r\npolitical   Party  leaders  to  sink   their   petty\r\n\r\ngrievances  and suppress their desire to play  party\r\n\r\npolitics,  at  least until after  we  have  achieved\r\n\r\nMerdeka.  Sir, if we want to go all out for Merdeka,\r\n\r\nlet  us  try  and  remember that the word  \"Merdeka\"\r\n\r\nitself  does  not come from Malaya but  is  borrowed\r\n\r\nfrom Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Indonesia borrowed it from us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> So let us follow the example\r\n\r\nof Indonesia. Let us just support one leader and one\r\n\r\nvoice  in  our  independence movement.  Look  around\r\n\r\nSingapore  today. Different Parties  have  different\r\n\r\nexplanations for the simple word \"Merdeka\"  and  for\r\n\r\nthe expression \"in the interests of the people\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very happy indeed, Sir, to see so many\r\n\r\npolitical  Party  leaders  today  professing  to  be\r\n\r\ndisciples  of Mr Nehru, especially the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar. I wish that he can really succeed  in\r\n\r\ndoing  what  Mr Nehru has done for  the  people  of\r\n\r\nIndia.  Mr  Nehru was not only the  leader  of  the\r\n\r\nfarmers,  the  students or the workers.  He  is  the\r\n\r\nnational  leader for all classes and  all  races  in\r\n\r\nIndia. Why cannot all political Parties emulate him?\r\n\r\nWhy   be  overbearing,  petty,  class-conscious  and\r\n\r\nincapable  of winning the confidence of the  masses?\r\n\r\nWhy  should  we  only want to make  a  leader  of  a\r\n\r\ncertain  class  or  of  a  certain  race?  I  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is most disheartening to me to see such a\r\n\r\nwide   gulf   of   misunderstanding   between    the\r\n\r\nintelligentsia and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmasses in Singapore. I will quote one example. If  a\r\n\r\nhouse is beyond repair, it must be pulled down and a\r\n\r\nnew  one put up. But if it can be repaired, why pull\r\n\r\nit down? Countries like Russia and China, after they\r\n\r\nhad  been torn by civil strifes and because of their\r\n\r\nlow  standard of living, naturally had  to  turn  to\r\n\r\nMarxism to help them rebuild. Political leaders, let\r\n\r\nus  be  practical. Look around you. Singapore  today\r\n\r\nprobably enjoys the highest living standard in South-East  Asia.  Sir, to go back to my  analogy  of  the\r\n\r\nhouse: if we just remove certain white and red  ants\r\n\r\nthat  are  infesting the house, it will then  become\r\n\r\nbeautiful and its foundations will remain strong. If\r\n\r\nanyone wants to introduce extremism in Singapore,  I\r\n\r\nterm  him either a member of the elite or a  useless\r\n\r\ngenius.  Now  is  the  time for  us  to  bridge  all\r\n\r\nmisunderstandings and work as one solid united  body\r\n\r\naspiring  towards Merdeka. We must  learn  from  the\r\n\r\nlessons  of India, Indonesia and Burma and  see  how\r\n\r\nthey  reaped their independence harvest. How are  we\r\n\r\ngoing  to  produce leaders like Gandhi, Sukarno  and\r\n\r\nGeneral U Aung Sang?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M.

Sir, I wish to point\r\n\r\nout  that although I want Singapore to be united and\r\n\r\nto be Asia and Africa conscious, I am sure the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister would not like to be a second Syngman  Rhee\r\n\r\nof South Korea or a Chiang Kai-shek of Formosa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I will say why I support the\r\n\r\namendment  moved  by the Chief Minister.

The Chief Minister's\r\n\r\namendment has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncleverly divided into two parts, the first of  which\r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...takes note of the recent arrests of six\r\n\r\npersons under the Banishment Ordinance and one\r\n\r\nperson under the\r\n\r\nPreservation of Public Security Ordinance and the\r\n\r\ndissolution of two societies...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, nobody can condemn this - that this House takes\r\n\r\nnote of these acts. The second part of his amendment\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...and welcomes the strong action taken by the\r\n\r\nGovernment against subversive elements in     Singapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  do not know whether any decent and right-thinking\r\n\r\npeople  can oppose the Government for taking  strong\r\n\r\naction against subversive elements. Therefore, I beg\r\n\r\nto support the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  should like to add my mite as  a  Nominated\r\n\r\nMember to a debate that is essentially the pigeon of\r\n\r\nelected Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened rather sadly to the Cassandra-like\r\n\r\nutterances of the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr  Lee\r\n\r\nKuan  Yew) which I am certain the outside world will\r\n\r\nheavily  discount if ever it gets round  to  reading\r\n\r\nthem  in detail. I have the greatest admiration  for\r\n\r\nthe  gifts  of the hon. Member and I wish  that  his\r\n\r\nprophetic  zeal could have been used  on  the  other\r\n\r\nside;  not  the colonial side but the anti-Communist\r\n\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, the Member for Tanjong Pagar used his\r\n\r\ndevice of ridiculing by reading in a particular  way\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  complimentary things said  about  the\r\n\r\nChief Minister in the English Press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon Teck)\r\n\r\nhas   already   mentioned  the  stock  market.   The\r\n\r\nreference  to  a  rise  in the  local  share  market\r\n\r\nparticularly  got  under his skin although  he  said\r\n\r\nthat  he  was  amused by it but he doubtless  thinks\r\n\r\nthat  the  said rise is due to the machinations  and\r\n\r\nmanipulations  of capitalist speculators.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe improvement in the local stock market has merely\r\n\r\nbrought the quotations for these local companies  up\r\n\r\nto where they would normally have been if it had not\r\n\r\nbeen  for the series of crises that we have  had  in\r\n\r\nthis  island over the last 18 months. This  rise  in\r\n\r\nthe stock markets\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  the hon. Member was so contemptuous of  is  a\r\n\r\nclear  indication that business and trade interests,\r\n\r\non which this island depends, and the people welcome\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly the vigorous and courageous action of\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the inescapable fact is that Singapore is\r\n\r\ndivided  into two camps - Communist and anti-Communist\r\n\r\n-  and  on one side, as plainly as the nose on one's\r\n\r\nface,  especially a European nose, is  the  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party.  The  frequent  references  by  their\r\n\r\nspokesmen  to their desire to build up a democratic,\r\n\r\nnon-Communist  Malaya are to my  mind  merely  over-protesting,   as  today's  speeches   have   clearly\r\n\r\nindicated,  but even if their leaders are  not  true\r\n\r\nCommunists surely no one doubts but that their ranks\r\n\r\nare  thick  with Reds. I used to give  the  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party  credit  for being  consistent.  Their\r\n\r\nleaders  urged  early union with the Federation  and\r\n\r\nwarned  against the dangers of delay. Now  it  would\r\n\r\nseem  to me they are doing everything in their power\r\n\r\nto  keep these two territories apart. Obviously, the\r\n\r\nFederation Government can only view with the gravest\r\n\r\nmisgivings    the   manifestations   of    Communist\r\n\r\nactivities  in this city though the fact that  these\r\n\r\nhave been brought out into the open recently may  be\r\n\r\na good thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was particularly interested in some of the\r\n\r\npoints  made  by  the  Minister for  Education  this\r\n\r\nafternoon and I must say that I learned a great deal\r\n\r\nfrom  what  he  said.  It struck  me  while  he  was\r\n\r\nspeaking  that one of the most contemptible  devices\r\n\r\nused  by  the  Communists is their  so-called  anti-yellow  culture campaign which they use  to  further\r\n\r\ntheir political ends. Yellow culture, of course,  is\r\n\r\nas  old  as time but according to the Communists  or\r\n\r\neven  according  to  some of the  spokesmen  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action  Party, it  flourishes  only  under\r\n\r\ncolonialism.  Now,  anti-yellow  culture  they   say\r\n\r\ncannot  be  separated from the  fight  for  national\r\n\r\nindependence  and for getting rid of colonial  rule.\r\n\r\nOnly  when  Singapore has uprooted  yellow  culture,\r\n\r\nthey say, can she flourish. What rubbish! Men may be\r\n\r\ngood or evil but in the latter case, it is their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhearts  that you have to change, not their politics.\r\n\r\nWhat  is there I wonder, Mr Speaker, in dialectical\r\n\r\nmaterialism  or the atheistic creed of Communism  to\r\n\r\nchange  men's  hearts  or  to  rid  their  minds  of\r\n\r\npornography? Yet the Communists would link the anti-yellow  movement with the Merdeka movement to  fight\r\n\r\nfor independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us have some sweet reason.\r\n\r\nIs  not  the use of the words \"struggle\" and \"fight\"\r\n\r\nin  the  way  they  are always  used  today  in  the\r\n\r\n\"struggle  and  fight  against  colonialism\"  sense,\r\n\r\nreally a sort of euphemism in reverse? Is there  any\r\n\r\nreal  fight  or struggle? Is it still believed  that\r\n\r\nthe  wicked  Colonial Office, as distinct  from  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Government,  will double-cross  Malaya  and\r\n\r\nSingapore and refuse to grant self-government? To my\r\n\r\nmind,  this  colony  is approaching  self-government\r\n\r\nmore rapidly than anyone here ever expected it would\r\n\r\ndo  and  it would be a far, far better thing if  all\r\n\r\nreferences  to  the  so-called  evils - many  of  them\r\n\r\nimaginary - of  a dying regime were dropped  once  and\r\n\r\nfor all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;References to \"the people\" have come up again - the\r\n\r\npoint  I  have touched on before in this House.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Bukit Timah (Mr Lim Ching  Siong)  has\r\n\r\nsaid, according to what I read in the Press that the\r\n\r\nSingapore Factory and Shop Workers' Union has 30,000\r\n\r\nmembers  and this doubtless is \"the people\" to  whom\r\n\r\nhe  refers.  It  should be noted however  that  this\r\n\r\nfigure is only 2\ufffd per cent of the population of the\r\n\r\nisland of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the hopelessly biased Straits Times,\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member (Mr Lim Ching Siong) regards  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-language   Press   as   hostile    to    the\r\n\r\npeople - hostile  to his 2\ufffd per cent,  I  suppose - and\r\n\r\naccording to this newspaper he stated, and  I  quote\r\n\r\nfrom the Straits Times:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I object to newspaper reports about the existence\r\n\r\nof  an  anti-Communist group which  has  distributed\r\n\r\nleaflets in schools.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Surely  this reveals with the clearest of  clearness\r\n\r\nthat   the  gentleman  is  pro-Communist,  and   the\r\n\r\ndifference  between a pro-Communist and a  Communist\r\n\r\ncannot be, to my mind, very great.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the point which was raised by the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin (Mr Ede). The Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister in a speech made in this Assembly  on  25th\r\n\r\nJuly,  1955,  gave  a definition of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  He  was prompted to  do  so  because  of\r\n\r\nquestions  asked by me and, he said, in  giving  his\r\n\r\nanswer, to improve my political education. This  was\r\n\r\nhis definition:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The people of Singapore ... are the people who are\r\n\r\nrepresented   by  their  representatives   in   this Assembly,  and  in  a democracy, the  majority  view represents the view of the people.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  Hon. the  Chief Minister will,  no  doubt,  be pleased  to know that I gave attention to his  words\r\n\r\nand I now offer them to the People's Action Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendment to the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is indeed\r\n\r\na sad spectacle - at least it is for me - to see one who\r\n\r\nis  so  able and talented as the Member for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) misdirecting his  energies\r\n\r\nand  talent  to  attacking the Government.  And  for\r\n\r\nwhat?  For  protecting the people of Singapore  from\r\n\r\nsubversion. Sir, I suggest he can better utilise his\r\n\r\ntalents and energies towards more constructive work.\r\n\r\nIt was, Sir, a touching experience to hear him speak\r\n\r\nwithout conviction in his own heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as is usual with the People's Action Party\r\n\r\nand  those that are behind them, to cloak  the  real\r\n\r\nreasons  for Government's action, they  try  to  put\r\n\r\nforward  the  argument  for  the  benefit  of  their\r\n\r\nfollowers  that the real reason why Government  took\r\n\r\nthis  strong  action was to wipe out  opposition  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government could come in with a  thumping\r\n\r\nvictory in the next elections. Sir, this is a wilful\r\n\r\ndistortion of facts. Nothing is further  away  from\r\n\r\nthe minds of the Members of the Government. In fact,\r\n\r\nwe could have expected that sort of a line if we did\r\n\r\nnot have this elected Government in power but if  we\r\n\r\nhad  members of the People's Action Party  in  power\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they set themselves up as champions of\r\n\r\nMerdeka.  Merdeka  for what and  Merdeka  for  whom?\r\n\r\nMerdeka for that minority group who, the moment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey   get  Merdeka,  will  set  themselves  up   as\r\n\r\ndictators?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member stated that he would not mind it so\r\n\r\nmuch  if  the  Government had a  team  of  men  with\r\n\r\ncourage,  ability and integrity to pursue their  aim\r\n\r\nmethodically. Sir, I have a suspicion  that  he  was\r\n\r\nadvocating  blind ruthlessness. I, Sir, as  one  who\r\n\r\nbelieves  in  democracy, will never be  a  party  to\r\n\r\nblind ruthlessness. Those may be the tactics that he\r\n\r\nand  his Back-benchers employ but, Sir, a government\r\n\r\nthat  is  democratically elected, that  is,  through\r\n\r\ndemocracy,   cannot  pursue  a   policy   of   blind\r\n\r\nruthlessness. The Government will be firm  no  doubt\r\n\r\nin  dealing with subversion but the Government  will\r\n\r\nact  with consideration and will consider every case\r\n\r\nas  it has been doing, with thoroughness so that  no\r\n\r\nperson  will lose his liberty just because of  blind\r\n\r\nruthlessness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned about the boom in the\r\n\r\nshare market and the happiness of the merchants  and\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Chambers of Commerce. Sir,  what  is\r\n\r\nwrong if happiness is expressed by the merchants and\r\n\r\nby  members of the Chambers of Commerce? They are as\r\n\r\nintegral  a  part of our society as are the  workers\r\n\r\nand,  Sir,  we  must remember that our workers  find\r\n\r\nemployment  as a result of the commercial activities\r\n\r\nof these merchants. If we have Merdeka, do we want a\r\n\r\nMerdeka where everyone has employment or do we  want\r\n\r\nto  scare  away these merchants and then  achieve  a\r\n\r\nMerdeka  where  there  is unemployment  and  poverty\r\n\r\namongst the people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member pleaded for free play of ideas within\r\n\r\nthe  constitutional framework. Sir, that is  a  very\r\n\r\ndesirable idea and it should be encouraged  as  much\r\n\r\nas  possible provided there is no hitting below  the\r\n\r\nbelt  by  both sides; but as we know the tactics  of\r\n\r\nthese  subversive elements, they work like termites.\r\n\r\nAll  of a sudden one fine day you discover that  the\r\n\r\nvery  foundations of your house have  been  attacked\r\n\r\nand  the  house is about to tumble down.  Sir,  with\r\n\r\nthat   sort  of  subversion,  you  cannot   be   too\r\n\r\ndemocratic but still the Government does give a  lot\r\n\r\nof   consideration  to  every  individual  case.  We\r\n\r\nthoroughly dislike,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,  the  use  of  the  Banishment  Ordinance   and\r\n\r\ndetentions under the Preservation of Public Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance, and so on, but if we are to carry out the\r\n\r\ntrust  that  has  been  placed  by  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  us, it is an action  that  we  cannot\r\n\r\nescape.  We  have to do it and we have  to  be  firm\r\n\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is afraid that at the moment we may\r\n\r\nhave  a  conscience  but that,  later  on,  as  time\r\n\r\nprogresses,  our conscience may start  thinning  out\r\n\r\nand  in  the  end  we may end up as dictators.  What\r\n\r\nwould  have happened, Sir, if his Party had been  in\r\n\r\npower  today?  Probably they would not have  started\r\n\r\nwith a conscience at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a popular fallacy and propaganda to\r\n\r\nterm  those who do not follow certain ideologies  as\r\n\r\nnon-Asians,  as  anti-Asians, and so  on.  In  Asia\r\n\r\ntoday, you have three types of ideologies: there are\r\n\r\ncertain  lands with a Communist ideology; there  are\r\n\r\ncertain  lands  and  people who do  not  believe  in\r\n\r\nCommunism and have adopted a democratic way of life;\r\n\r\nand  then there are others who being democratic will\r\n\r\nnot   take  sides,  like  India  and  certain  other\r\n\r\ncountries  who  are termed what is called  neutrals.\r\n\r\nDoes the Member say that all those who do not follow\r\n\r\nthe Communist ideology are not Asians?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also said that the people of Singapore\r\n\r\ndo  not  like the strong action that the  Government\r\n\r\nhas   taken.  But,  Sir,  who  are  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore?  If  he means to say that the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  only  those few thousands  that  are\r\n\r\nrepresented by the People's Action Party and by  the unions  that  are behind the People's Action  Party, there  are hundreds of thousands of others  who  are not with the People's Action Party. What about them? Are  they  not the people of Singapore too?  I  say, Sir,  that  those who are with the Government  today\r\n\r\nare in the majority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do hope that the Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nwill  realise  that it is not to the liking  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment that this action has been taken but it is\r\n\r\nlike a medicine that has got to be swallowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir, if we have a cancer in our body whether we like\r\n\r\nit  or  not we have to undergo an operation.

Invariably,  Sir,  when\r\n\r\nstatements  are  made by the Singapore  Factory  and\r\n\r\nShop Workers' Union or other organisations connected\r\n\r\nwith  the  Union  referring  to  the  Government  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  they  refer to it as  the  Labour  Front\r\n\r\nGovernment.

This morning,\r\n\r\nSir, the Hon. the Chief Minister made it very clear\r\n\r\nthat  the  proposed banishees were all born  outside\r\n\r\nMalaya.  I say, Sir, that if anyone at all is  going\r\n\r\nto  fight for the Merdeka of this island, it is  we,\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore, the citizens of Singapore,\r\n\r\nwho should fight for Merdeka and not foreigners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point, Sir, and this tickles me to death.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Bukit Timah (Mr Lim Ching  Siong) - I\r\n\r\nbelieve  it  was last week - when he referred  to  the\r\n\r\nMinisters of the elected Government, he referred to\r\n\r\nus  as colonial stooges. This morning, Sir, we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  reduced  from that rank to Quislings.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nknow  what  Quislings are. They are the  people  who\r\n\r\nafter the last war were put up against the wall  and\r\n\r\nshot  to death, rightly or wrongly. Presumably, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen the People's Action Party comes into power, we,\r\n\r\nthe  Quislings on this side, will be put up  against\r\n\r\nthe  wall  and  shot to death, as the  Quislings  in\r\n\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede)\r\n\r\nand  the  Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon  Teck)\r\n\r\nhave  already voiced the opinion of my Party.  I  am\r\n\r\njust here to add a few more points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody in this world likes restrictions. Nobody in\r\n\r\nthis world likes arbitrary power to be placed in the\r\n\r\nhands  of  anybody. In fact, if these  were  normal\r\n\r\ntimes,  we  would be the first to ask Government  to\r\n\r\nrepeal  all these laws that give absolute  power  to\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past and especially during the election\r\n\r\ncampaign, many Parties, including the Labour  Front,\r\n\r\nthought  that it would be a good move to remove  the\r\n\r\nemergency  powers. They tried to  live  up  to  that\r\n\r\npromise  but  however after being in government  for\r\n\r\nsome  time,  they  found that it  was  necessary  to\r\n\r\nretain  those powers, but to retain them in  a  more\r\n\r\npalatable  form  in the name of the Preservation  of\r\n\r\nPublic Security Ordinance. At the time of the debate\r\n\r\non  the  Preservation  of Public  Security  Bill,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve   that  that  Bill  received  the  unanimous\r\n\r\napproval of the House and that was the expression of\r\n\r\nthe  people about the state of affairs in Singapore.\r\n\r\nOf  course, when Government is using it today, it is\r\n\r\nusing  the  power that is entrusted  to  it  by  the\r\n\r\npeople.  When we give certain powers to  Government,\r\n\r\nwe  expect the Government to use them, but  we  must\r\n\r\nalways ask Government to use them after very careful\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, I heard two sides of the story. I\r\n\r\nexpected to hear a very good defence put up  by  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party but I was really disappointed.\r\n\r\nOn  the other hand, the accounts by the Ministers on\r\n\r\nthe  opposite Benches have given me a clear picture.\r\n\r\nAs  an  Assemblyman in this House, I  am  not  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to  look  into the  Government  files  for\r\n\r\ndetails  of  why  those people were arrested  and  I\r\n\r\nthink  that  this  morning's debate  will  give  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore a chance to know what was really\r\n\r\nbehind  all  the arrests. In fact, one `day,  I  was\r\n\r\nconfronted with a question by the President  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Women's Association, Linda  Chen.  She\r\n\r\ncame along to me and asked me to support her in  her\r\n\r\nanti-yellow movement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  she  asked me these questions: \"Why  do  people\r\n\r\naccuse  me  of being a Communist? Why do people  say\r\n\r\nthat   the   anti-yellow  movement  is  a  Communist\r\n\r\norganisation?\" The answer I gave her was this,  \"Ask\r\n\r\nyourself.  As far as I am concerned, I know  nothing\r\n\r\nabout it and if you think that people are asking you\r\n\r\nthese questions, search yourself. Probably there  is\r\n\r\nsomething  behind these questions.\" Of  course,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  this  morning gave their  reply  to  her\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, whenever an action is taken by any one Party,\r\n\r\nthere is always a great deal of suspicion by others.\r\n\r\nThis   morning,  we  heard  accusations   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment had made a pact with the Colonial Office.\r\n\r\nThis,  I think, is due to the suspicion of one Party\r\n\r\nagainst  another. In fact, during the  last  Merdeka\r\n\r\ntalks, we were wrongly accused of making a pact with\r\n\r\nthe  Colonial Office when there was no truth in that\r\n\r\nwhatsoever, and I believe probably this may  be  the\r\n\r\nsame case. Having experienced false accusation once,\r\n\r\nI  can understand the Government a little bit better\r\n\r\nwhen  it  is  placed  in such a  position.  However,\r\n\r\nwhatever  the outcome, the people of Singapore  must\r\n\r\nrealise that in order to retain the greatest  amount\r\n\r\nof  freedom, we must sacrifice a small portion of it\r\n\r\nand leave it to the wise decision of the Government.\r\n\r\nAnd to the Government, we say: So long as you use it\r\n\r\nwisely,   carefully  and  with  a  great   deal   of\r\n\r\nconsideration, we will support such action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  it seems from the P.A.P. and their supporters'\r\n\r\npoint  of  view that any opinion which differs  from\r\n\r\ntheirs must be wrong and that any reports of support\r\n\r\nother  than  for  the  Middle  Road  group  must  be\r\n\r\nfictitious. Because they have indulged in this  game\r\n\r\nof  deceit so often, they are automatically  led  to\r\n\r\nbelieve that other people must be doing likewise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last two weeks, Sir, I have been approached\r\n\r\nby   a  number  of  people  comprising  businessmen,\r\n\r\nprofessional men, teachers, students, labourers, and\r\n\r\nso on. Without exception, all of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  wished  to tell me how glad they were  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  action  in the  recent  detentions  of\r\n\r\nthese troublemakers. They even said, \"We have a hope\r\n\r\nnow that the teachers can really teach, the students\r\n\r\ncan really study and the workmen can work peacefully\r\n\r\nwithout  intimidation  and  interference  from   the\r\n\r\nMiddle  Road  group.\" Some people went  further  and\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"The  Government should detain more  and  for\r\n\r\nthose  whom we cannot deport, we are quite  prepared\r\n\r\nto  contribute to their support in gaol.\"  Such  are\r\n\r\nthe opinions of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point raised by the Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\n(Mr  Lee  Kuan Yew) this morning was  that  we  are\r\n\r\nsupposed  to be a caretaker Government.  Surely,  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  think  that because we  are  a  caretaker\r\n\r\nGovernment,  we  should refrain from  governing.  If\r\n\r\nthat  is  so, then what is the purpose of forming  a\r\n\r\nGovernment?  We might as well hand it  over  to  the\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point raised by the same Member was that\r\n\r\nall  that was done by the Government to prevent  its\r\n\r\ndefeat  in the coming elections. I think we on  this\r\n\r\nside  of the House do not regard the result  of  the\r\n\r\nnext  elections  so  important  as  the  P.A.P.   We\r\n\r\nconsider that our duty is to govern and that  if  we\r\n\r\ngovern  well,  we do not care very  much  about  the\r\n\r\nresult  of the next elections a bit but we sincerely\r\n\r\nbelieve  that if we are going to carry  on  what  we\r\n\r\nhave  already started, we will be returned in  spite\r\n\r\nof  whatever  propaganda the  P.A.P. may  put  over\r\n\r\nagainst us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These 9 people are detained under the Ordinances\r\n\r\napproved by this House which were specially drawn up\r\n\r\nto  deal  with this type of cases. To say  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  undemocratic because  they  have  to\r\n\r\ncarry out duties entrusted to them is to say that we\r\n\r\nshould  close  the  Assembly and  carry  out  public\r\n\r\ntrials as we have in Communist China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I would like to ask all Members of this\r\n\r\nHouse  who have the future of Singapore at heart  to\r\n\r\nsupport  the  amended motion of the Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister to deal a blow to these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsubversive  elements which, if left unchecked,  will\r\n\r\ndefinitely  lead  us  to  a similar  fate  as  other\r\n\r\nCommunist-dominated countries in this  part  of  the\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this amendment\r\n\r\nmoved  by the Hon. the Chief Minister appears to  me\r\n\r\nto negative my motion. But if you are satisfied that\r\n\r\nthis  does not infringe the rules of debate in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly, then no more need be said about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two types of speeches we have heard\r\n\r\ntoday:  from the Government, those who are  involved\r\n\r\nin the administration, and speeches from the Liberal-Socialist  Party Members who have been supported  so\r\n\r\n\"joyously\" by Mr Sutherland. Then there were two Independents who went one each way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole tenor of the Government's speeches was\r\n\r\ncompletely  negative: \"They are subversive.  I  have\r\n\r\nthe  information that they are subversive. We intend\r\n\r\nto  deal  with them firmly. We will deal  with  them\r\n\r\nfirmly. We know what we are doing and we will  march\r\n\r\non  to  democracy.\"  Then  comes  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation with his most interesting speech in  which\r\n\r\nwhole extracts of propaganda material of the Chinese\r\n\r\nMiddle  Schools Students' Union were given  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal of publicity. But the depressing thing about it\r\n\r\nall is that none of the speakers made any attempt to\r\n\r\nunderstand what this is all about. \"Communism is  an\r\n\r\nunmitigated  evil. We are determined  to  fight  it.\r\n\r\nThey  are  white ants. They are red ants.  We  shall\r\n\r\nsquash  them.\"  How? By locking them up?  You  might\r\n\r\nsucceed  if you could be as ruthless as Hitler.  You\r\n\r\nget  them and put them in the gas chamber.  You  get\r\n\r\ntheir  books  and you burn them. But Hitler  failed.\r\n\r\nThey  are  not  as  ruthless  as  Hitler,  not  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  anyway. Not that they do  not  have  the\r\n\r\ninclinations if given the opportunities,  but  I  do\r\n\r\nnot think they have sufficient ruthlessness of moral\r\n\r\ncharacter.  As  the  Minister for Local  Government,\r\n\r\nLands  and  Housing  said, he  is  somewhat  worried\r\n\r\nbecause he might be put up against the wall and shot\r\n\r\nwhen it is all over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> I am sure you meant that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No, Sir, not if the P.A.P. wins\r\n\r\nan  election.  If  there is going  to  be  an  armed\r\n\r\nrevolution in Malaya, then that may well happen. But\r\n\r\nif  you  are prepared to let this revolution resolve\r\n\r\nitself   by   peaceful  competition   and   peaceful\r\n\r\nparliamentary and constitutional methods,  then  you\r\n\r\nwill  avoid  those  unpleasant  consequences  of   a\r\n\r\nviolent revolution. There is an astonishing blissful\r\n\r\nignorance of what this is all about. Does anybody in\r\n\r\nthis House believe that if they just lock up all the\r\n\r\ntrouble-makers  in all these trade  unions  and  get\r\n\r\nvoluntary  contributions  from  wealthy  people  and\r\n\r\narchitects  like the Member for Pasir  Panjang  (Mr\r\n\r\nWong  Foo  Nam) to feed them in gaol, that they  can\r\n\r\nkeep them locked up for ever, that one day they will\r\n\r\nnot  have  to release them? They will come out  more\r\n\r\nfervent,  more  determined than when the  Government\r\n\r\nput  them  in,  more  skilful in  their  methods  of\r\n\r\npropaganda  and their tactics of violent revolution.\r\n\r\nAssuming  that  you want to play the fair  way,  one\r\n\r\nday,  sooner or later, you will have to say:  \"Well,\r\n\r\neverything is all right. We will let them  out.\"  Or\r\n\r\nyou banish them. So, many great revolutionaries were\r\n\r\nin  exile.  Ho Chi-minh was in exile for  years  and\r\n\r\nyears. Then one day he went back to his country  and\r\n\r\nthe revolution leavened until finally the French met\r\n\r\nthe  Vietminh on the battlefield and got  themselves\r\n\r\ndestroyed.  You  can only fight  this  if  you  have\r\n\r\nsomething positive. If you have your ideas. Then you\r\n\r\ncan fight to propagate those ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard with astonishment the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation deriding this hsueh hsi method.  There  is\r\n\r\none   thing  about  the  Communist  which  wins   my\r\n\r\nadmiration. He picks up what is good from the  other\r\n\r\nside.  He is not blind. If you have something  good,\r\n\r\nhe  takes it over, like \"Merdeka\", anything which is\r\n\r\ngood.  But  if  the Communists have something  good,\r\n\r\nbecause  they have started it, you say, \"No,  it  is\r\n\r\nCommunist.  We will not have it.\" How else  can  you\r\n\r\nmarshal  the  people  on your side  if  you  do  not\r\n\r\npropagate  your  ideas, if you  do  not  have  news-sheets,  microphones, and workers to put  over  your\r\n\r\nideas  and plans that will solve the evils  of  this\r\n\r\nsociety?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs  the Government going to sit back and say, \"Look,\r\n\r\nthis  is  trouble-making and anybody who  does  this\r\n\r\nwill  upset  my  shares and then there  will  be  no\r\n\r\nbusiness.  Then what will happen to the workers?  We\r\n\r\nmust  stop it. We will suppress it.\"? They have  tried\r\n\r\nit  in other parts of the world and they have failed\r\n\r\nand the result was a violent revolution. Hearing the\r\n\r\nspeeches  today,  I think Lenin is right:  Bourgeois\r\n\r\ninstitutions  will in the last resort use  force  to\r\n\r\nkeep down a revolution. They will not give in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways of fighting a revolution. One\r\n\r\nway  is  by peaceful competition which the democrats\r\n\r\nall  say they believe in. \"You propagate your  ideas\r\n\r\npeacefully, persuade the people to vote for you. You\r\n\r\nwin  and you take over.\" That is the theory. When  I\r\n\r\nlearned  my  constitutional law I was  told  that  a\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy was the acme of  perfection\r\n\r\nof  man's  political organisations. In Britain,  for\r\n\r\n400  years,  there have been no violent  revolutions\r\n\r\nbecause one had this interplay within a system which\r\n\r\nallowed   changes   to  take   place   by   peaceful\r\n\r\npersuasion. If a group gets the majority  of  people\r\n\r\nto  vote  for  them, then automatically they  assume\r\n\r\npower.  There is continuity in the government.  They\r\n\r\ncan  introduce their legislation and bring about the\r\n\r\nchanges they desire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theory is that if the British Communist Party\r\n\r\ncould  put up a sufficient number of candidates  and\r\n\r\nbe able either by political persuasion or propaganda\r\n\r\nor   other   constitutional   means   of   political\r\n\r\nleadership to get the majority of the people to vote\r\n\r\nfor  them,  then  they  would  become  the  lawfully\r\n\r\nconstituted and elected government of the people.  I\r\n\r\nbelieved that once upon a time. The Communists  were\r\n\r\naccused  of  being evil men who believed in  violent\r\n\r\nrevolution  for the sake of violent revolution,  who\r\n\r\ndid  not want to compete peacefully and who did  not\r\n\r\nwant  to  test  one idea against another  idea.  The\r\n\r\nwhole  international  Communist  and  anti-Communist\r\n\r\nposition  has  changed with the hydrogen  bomb.  The\r\n\r\nwhole   international   Communist   philosophy    is\r\n\r\nundergoing a radical change with de-Stalinisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeaceful co-existence, peaceful competition. Openly,\r\n\r\nthe  Kremlin now says to European Communist Parties,\r\n\r\n\"Cooperate  with other Socialist organisations.  You\r\n\r\ncan   win  power  by  democratic  and  parliamentary\r\n\r\nprocesses.\" And the West says, \"Look, this must  be\r\n\r\na  great conspiracy. We must be the loser somewhere.\r\n\r\nNo, we will not co-operate. We will not allow you to\r\n\r\nwin   and  compete  in  a  democratic  parliamentary\r\n\r\nfashion.\"  It  is one of those things which  depress\r\n\r\nthose who have been liberally educated because  they\r\n\r\nassumed  that  what  they  were  told  was  honestly\r\n\r\nbelieved.  Later they discover that,  in  fact,  all\r\n\r\nthose  pious  protestations  about  the  virtues  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy were not quite true. Once upon a time  the\r\n\r\nAmericans said that the Russians wanted to  conquer\r\n\r\nthe  world by force. Therefore they had to  arm  and\r\n\r\nfight  the Russians. Then one day, Moscow said,  \"We\r\n\r\nare going to disarm.\" And Mr Dulles said, \"This  is\r\n\r\na great threat because I would rather have a Russian\r\n\r\nsoldier in uniform in non-productive work than in  a\r\n\r\nfactory  in  productive work because  then  he  will\r\n\r\ncompete with me economically.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world picture is undergoing a change and\r\n\r\nlittle  men in Singapore do not understand  that  we\r\n\r\nare  a  part  of  a world revolution.  This  is  the\r\n\r\ngreatest  revolution in the history of mankind.  For\r\n\r\nthe  first time in the history of man, he is  trying\r\n\r\nto  establish an egalitarian society. I believe  the\r\n\r\nprocess towards such a society is inevitable. We can\r\n\r\nreach  it by one of two ways. We either have  it  by\r\n\r\npeaceful   evolution  or  we  have  it  by   violent\r\n\r\nrevolution. The only difference between a democratic\r\n\r\nLeft-wing  Socialist and a Communist  is  this:  The\r\n\r\nCommunist  believes  that it is impossible  to  have\r\n\r\npeaceful  evolution and that force is  necessary  to\r\n\r\ncrush  vested interests who will prevent a  workers'\r\n\r\nrevolution. The Socialist believes it is possible to\r\n\r\nhave peaceful evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this policy of repression is pursued, if this\r\n\r\nis  the  policy  in Malaya, then the Communists  are\r\n\r\nright. There is little room for Left-wing Socialists\r\n\r\nwho   preach  social  revolution  by  constitutional\r\n\r\nmethods because those now in power\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  not  let  the Communists win constitutionally.\r\n\r\nThe Communists cannot compete constitutionally. They\r\n\r\nare  out  of the race. They will not let them  stand\r\n\r\nfor  elections because they are subversive.  What  I\r\n\r\nsay is this. The Government may have information  of\r\n\r\nthe  guilt of these six men. The Government may  not\r\n\r\nhave  this  information. The Special Branch  may  be\r\n\r\nright,  the Special Branch may be wrong. But to  put\r\n\r\nthe argument at its highest for the Government, even\r\n\r\nif,  in fact, these six men believe in Communism - the\r\n\r\nquestion still remains whether they are prepared  to\r\n\r\ncompete  constitutionally and  peacefully.  If  they\r\n\r\nhave  never  done anything which is not peaceful  or\r\n\r\nconstitutional,  then you are  negating  your  whole\r\n\r\npolitical  philosophy when you say, \"I  will  arrest\r\n\r\nyou  because  I  think you are propagating  an  idea\r\n\r\nwhich  I consider pernicious and which I propose  to\r\n\r\nstop and prevent from spreading.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does anyone honestly believe that by banning hsueh\r\n\r\nhsi  and a few Chinese books it is possible to  stop\r\n\r\nthe  spread of ideas? Nehru once said that ideas are\r\n\r\nthe greatest weapons in the world since they know no\r\n\r\ncustom  barriers and national frontiers. If  you  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  equally  powerful ideas  to  make  people\r\n\r\nbelieve  that what you are doing is right  and  will\r\n\r\nbring about a better society, if you are bankrupt of\r\n\r\nideas  and  all  you  can say is,  \"1  am  going  to\r\n\r\ncheckmate you. I will lock you up. I will break  you\r\n\r\nup\",  then  I  say  the  end result  is  a  foregone\r\n\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said earlier - and I was not inciting the Labour\r\n\r\nFront to be ruthless - that they have one chance in  a\r\n\r\nmillion of making it succeed and it is this,  It  is\r\n\r\nlike building up your local industry. First you  say\r\n\r\nto  yourself, \"All right, I am too weak to  compete.\r\n\r\nSo  I  put up trade barriers, custom tariffs  and  I\r\n\r\nbuild  up  my  industries.\"  But  can  you  do  that\r\n\r\nforever? Does anybody believe that that is  the  way\r\n\r\nin  which  to  build up the economy  of  a  country?\r\n\r\nEventually, you will have to face conditions in  the\r\n\r\nworld, not conditions just in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Liberal-Socialist Party, they are even\r\n\r\nworse  than the Government. The leader of the Party,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Serangoon, was reported in the Press\r\n\r\nas  saying, when I made an application to  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister to have an emergency sitting  of\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly:  \"The Chief Minister knows  something\r\n\r\nabout it. The P.A.P. knows something about it. I  am\r\n\r\nall  in the dark. I do not know anything about  it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd   not  knowing  anything  about  it,  his  Party\r\n\r\nmagazine comes straight out in full support  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  right  or wrong,  whatever  it  is  all\r\n\r\nabout,  arrest the boys. That is the spirit. \"It  is\r\n\r\ntime  for a showdown\", says the editorial report  of\r\n\r\n30th  September. That is the way they compete.  They\r\n\r\nhave got no ideas. They are politically bankrupt. If\r\n\r\nwe  say we are Socialists, and we win elections,  he\r\n\r\nsays he is also a Socialist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, Mr Sutherland wondered, was I amused? I was\r\n\r\namused  because  Members like the  Member  for  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar  (Mr  Lim Koon Teck) did not understand  that\r\n\r\nthere   is   an   inherent  contradiction   in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  position.  The  Government  today   is\r\n\r\nrallying  around it all the reactionary forces,  all\r\n\r\nthe riff-raff, and depending on that support. Yet if\r\n\r\nthe  Government is honest in its aim of a  Socialist\r\n\r\nsociety,  then it will have to subdue  these  forces\r\n\r\nthat   support  it.  Does  the  Government  honestly\r\n\r\nbelieve that Mr Clayton of the European Chamber  of\r\n\r\nCommerce upon whose support it depends will sit idly\r\n\r\nby  if  they  move against his interests?  Why  have\r\n\r\nindustrial shares gone up? Because they now  believe\r\n\r\nthat  perhaps  for five years - maybe ten  or  fifteen\r\n\r\nyears  if  they  are  lucky and they  can  keep  the\r\n\r\nsituation under control - their enterprises are  going\r\n\r\nto  produce profits, for all these years and not  be\r\n\r\nconfiscated. On the other hand, if the P.A.P. comes\r\n\r\nin,  it is certain that taxation will go up.  It  is\r\n\r\nalso certain that labour costs will go up. And it is\r\n\r\nprobable  that  once their managerial and  technical\r\n\r\ncontribution is no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlonger  required they might be bought out. Therefore\r\n\r\nshare prices will drop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said this morning that the Government had one\r\n\r\nchance  in a million, and that was putting  it  very\r\n\r\ngenerously.  I do not want to use Communist  phrases\r\n\r\nlike   \"self-review\",  but  I  ask  this  Government\r\n\r\nhonestly  to search their hearts and ask  themselves\r\n\r\nwhether  the steps they are taking are more  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the people or - whether they intend it  or\r\n\r\nnot - in  the interest of European investors  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry?   Let  us  accept,  at  face   value,   the\r\n\r\nprotestations of the Hon. the Chief Minister that he\r\n\r\nmade  this decision himself with no promptings  from\r\n\r\nanyone, that, in fact, the European officials  stood\r\n\r\nby  while  six elected local Ministers decided  that\r\n\r\nthey  were going to wade in and settle things  where\r\n\r\nthe  British Army, Navy and Air Force have not  been\r\n\r\nable so to do for the last eight years. What has the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister got that the British did  not  have?\r\n\r\nOnly one thing, namely, that he is an Asian and  the\r\n\r\npeople  might get confused. Because now  instead  of\r\n\r\nthe white man versus the rest, it is the rest versus\r\n\r\nthe   rest.   Then   he  gets  all  the   riff-raff,\r\n\r\nkindergartens, libraries, etc, lining up on his side\r\n\r\nand the men with the ideals, whatever their ultimate\r\n\r\npolitical convictions, on the other side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody talks of the masses. The masses are\r\n\r\nimportant because if you give one man one vote, then\r\n\r\nyou  have  to take him into account. But  I  shudder\r\n\r\nwhen I think of the complete naivety with which they\r\n\r\napproach the problem of revolution in Malaya. It  is\r\n\r\nnot  just  a  question  of counting  up  unions  and\r\n\r\nassociations and then saying, \"I have got more on my\r\n\r\nside.\" \"I have been round my constituency\", says the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanglin (Mr Ede). He was elected  by  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  European expatriates - who should never  have\r\n\r\nbeen given a vote in the first place. \"They tell  me\r\n\r\nin  the rural areas that the Government's action  is\r\n\r\nin  the right spirit and we will support you.\" Well,\r\n\r\nif  they  honestly believe in this, let us  have  an\r\n\r\nelection.  I  do  not think anybody really  believes\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we do know that the phoney phase is over.\r\n\r\nThese  are  men who have now taken their lives  into\r\n\r\ntheir own hands. They have decided for the right  or\r\n\r\nwrong  reasons to take this decision. If they cannot\r\n\r\nget  the men who are prepared to organise the masses\r\n\r\non  their side, then how are they going to  get  the\r\n\r\nmasses  on  their  side? In every  union,  in  every\r\n\r\nsociety, in every political Party, in every  office,\r\n\r\nit  is only a small group of people who are prepared\r\n\r\nto  undertake responsibilities, to fight and to work\r\n\r\nfor  their beliefs and ideals. They must find  these\r\n\r\nmen.   Give  them  those  beliefs,  beliefs  of   an\r\n\r\negalitarian democratic society. Then these men  will\r\n\r\nfight with them and organise the masses. But if they\r\n\r\nfind only lounge-lizards, bar-lizards, and directors\r\n\r\nof  companies  supporting  them,  who  is  going  to\r\n\r\norganise   the  masses  on  their  behalf?   I   can\r\n\r\nunderstand  a  Right-wing group  like  the  Liberal-Socialist   Party,  the  Democrats-cum-Progressives.\r\n\r\nThey are not interested in organising the masses and\r\n\r\nraising  the standard of living. They are interested\r\n\r\nin  more industry, more profits which they say  will\r\n\r\nbenefit  the  workers because they  will  give  more\r\n\r\nemployment. But here is a Party that believes in  an\r\n\r\negalitarian society. But it is taking all the  steps\r\n\r\nwhich make it unlikely for an egalitarian society to\r\n\r\ncome about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this morning I touched lightly\r\n\r\non one point and perhaps Mr Sutherland may be right\r\n\r\non  this,  that the developments in Malaya are  such\r\n\r\nthat we will soon reach a point where you are either\r\n\r\nCommunist  or anti-Communist and that there  is  no\r\n\r\nroom  for  anybody who says, \"Let us  have  peaceful\r\n\r\ncompetition.\"  Without any pretext,  the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  dissolved organisations which are not  involved\r\n\r\nin  any  trouble  and has locked up individuals  who\r\n\r\nhave  not  done  anything violent. This  Government\r\n\r\nwill find that there will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe, as there was in China and in IndoChina, a flight\r\n\r\nof   the   intellectuals   away   from   them.   And\r\n\r\nintellectuals do matter. They may have only one vote\r\n\r\nand  may  not matter from the point of view of  that\r\n\r\none  vote.  But from the point of view of organising\r\n\r\nthe  masses  and  influencing them, their  desertion\r\n\r\nwill  make  the result catastrophic. In the  end  at\r\n\r\nbest they will establish a society like South Korea.\r\n\r\nThey  have  some form of democracy. They  have  some\r\n\r\nkind of Parliament. They even allow opposition.  But\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Vice-President gets difficult  and  looks\r\n\r\nlike   giving  the  President  trouble,  the   Vice-President is shot by an unknown assassin.  They  may\r\n\r\nestablish that kind of democracy. But how  long  can\r\n\r\nit  last, unless it is sustained by the strength  of\r\n\r\nour own people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask this Government to remember this. We may\r\n\r\nlose  this debate because of the peculiar set-up  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly.  But we will never  lose  our  self-respect   by   either   wittingly   or   unwittingly\r\n\r\ncollaborating  with  those whose  interests  are  so\r\n\r\nopposed  to  ours  that any genuine  cooperation  is\r\n\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Minister for Education (Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  rise to support wholeheartedly the  amended\r\n\r\nmotion moved by the Hon. the Chief Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Party is giving its full support to the\r\n\r\namended  motion of the Hon. the Chief  Minister.  As\r\n\r\ntrue believers of democracy, we do believe that  the\r\n\r\naction taken by the Government in arresting the  six\r\n\r\npersons under the Banishment Ordinance and one under\r\n\r\nthe  Preservation of Public Security  Ordinance  was\r\n\r\nfully  scrutinised by the Council of Ministers  with\r\n\r\nhonesty,  sincerity and justice. This  morning,  the\r\n\r\nHon.the Chief Minister assured this House that they\r\n\r\nhad considered the matter with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreatest  care before the arrests were  made.  I  do\r\n\r\nbelieve,  Sir,  the assurance, and my  Party  and  I\r\n\r\nfully support the Hon.the Chief Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\narising  from this long debate, there is  one  vital\r\n\r\nquestion  which we must all ask ourselves  and  that\r\n\r\nquestion  is:  \"Is there any country  in  the  world\r\n\r\nwhich  does not reserve to itself the power  to  get\r\n\r\nrid of aliens whose actions are not conducive to the\r\n\r\nwelfare of the country?\" If there is such a country,\r\n\r\nI  shall be very sorry for the people living in that\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Preservation of Public Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance  under  which certain  persons  have  been\r\n\r\ndetained,  this Ordinance was copied from a  similar\r\n\r\nlaw existing in India. Asia today looks to India for\r\n\r\nguidance.  The name of Mr Nehru has been mentioned;\r\n\r\nwe respect him; we like to take his lead and we have\r\n\r\ntaken  his  lead when we introduced the Preservation\r\n\r\nof Public Security Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask every one to consider very\r\n\r\ncarefully, not only Members of this Assembly but all\r\n\r\npeople in Singapore who are capable of thinking  for\r\n\r\nthemselves,  the  question  whether  there  is   any\r\n\r\ncountry  in  this  world that does  not  reserve  to\r\n\r\nitself  the  right  to get rid  of  aliens  who  are\r\n\r\ndangerous to the welfare of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That the words proposed to be left\r\n\r\nout, be left out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Division, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.
