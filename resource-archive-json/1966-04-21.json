While   sawmilling   is   providing\r\n\r\nemployment for quite a number of people, the land  that\r\n\r\nthey   now  occupy  in  the  heart  of  the  city   and\r\n\r\nsurrounding  areas  can be better  used.  The  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board,  together  with  the  Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board, will give priority to sawmills which\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  relocated to make way for urban  renewal,\r\n\r\nhousing  and industrial projects. To date, the Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board has received about  70  applications\r\n\r\nfor  sawmills for sites at Kranji. The first 100  acres\r\n\r\nso  far reclaimed will be able to accommodate about  25\r\n\r\nsawmills.  It is the Government's intention  to  locate\r\n\r\nall sawmills at Kranji so that better amenities for the\r\n\r\nsawmill  industry  can be provided. The  allocation  of\r\n\r\nland  will begin as soon as the site at Kranji has been\r\n\r\nserviced with electricity and water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RESTRICTIONS ON TRAVEL BY CAUSEWAY</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the House and\r\n\r\nall  people of goodwill will share our regrets and deep\r\n\r\ndisappointment that today the Causeway  has  failed  to\r\n\r\nbridge the gulf between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. The\r\n\r\nCauseway has seen historical moments since it was built\r\n\r\n42 years ago. There was a brief period of a month or so\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Causeway  was blown up during  the  war  and\r\n\r\ntraffic between the mainland and Singapore ceased,  but\r\n\r\nthis  was  a physical damage which was quickly repaired\r\n\r\nso  that communication by road and rail between the two\r\n\r\nterritories was resumed. Now for the second time in its\r\n\r\nhistory   the   Causeway's   economic   and   strategic\r\n\r\nimportance  is  once  more brought  to  the  fore.  The\r\n\r\npolitical  separation  of Singapore  and  Malaysia  has\r\n\r\ntoday  reached  a  climax in the  announcement  by  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Minister for Home Affairs of the  intentions\r\n\r\nof  the Malaysian Government to impose restrictions  on\r\n\r\nthe   entry   of   Singapore  citizens   into   Malaya,\r\n\r\nparticularly  restrictions on those who travel  by  the\r\n\r\nCauseway. There are on the average 20,000 persons a day\r\n\r\nwho  move across the Causeway from Singapore to  Malaya\r\n\r\nand about the same number of persons travel from Johore\r\n\r\ninto  Singapore. The number of persons who will  suffer\r\n\r\nany  inconvenience caused by the proposed  restrictions\r\n\r\nis  therefore  not small, but I am sure that  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  are  patient and they will no doubt  bear  up\r\n\r\nwith  it. I had hoped that any decisions on immigration\r\n\r\ncontrol at the Causeway\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  have  received  first the consideration  of  the\r\n\r\njoint  Singapore/Malaysian  Immigration  Committee,  so\r\n\r\nthat the problem can be considered from all angles, but\r\n\r\nit  was  unfortunate indeed that a  decision  has  been\r\n\r\ntaken  unilaterally by the Malaysian  Government.  Soon\r\n\r\nafter the break of Singapore from Malaysia on the  23rd\r\n\r\nAugust,  1965,  I wrote to the Malaysian  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs  suggesting that the two Governments  co-ordinate  policies  on immigration,  particularly  with\r\n\r\nregard  to  travel across the Causeway.  The  Malaysian\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister replied on 16th September,  1965,\r\n\r\nagreeing  to  the  proposal  and  suggested  that   the\r\n\r\nimmigration  officials  of the two  Governments  should\r\n\r\nmeet  to examine the problem. This meeting of officials\r\n\r\nwas  held  on  11th  October, 1965. The  Malaysian  and\r\n\r\nSingapore sides were led by their respective  Heads  of\r\n\r\nImmigration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting agreed that it was desirable that the\r\n\r\nexisting  free movement across the Causeway  should  be\r\n\r\nmaintained.  There should be a co-ordinated  policy  of\r\n\r\nimmigration control between the two territories. It was\r\n\r\nalso  agreed that the present practice of common  visas\r\n\r\nfor  Malaysia and Singapore should continue, i.e, visas\r\n\r\nfor  Malaysia  will  be valid for Singapore  and  vice-versa, except where special conditions are applied.  It\r\n\r\nwas  also agreed that in order to preserve the existing\r\n\r\nfree  movement  across the Causeway,  both  Governments\r\n\r\nwould  issue Exemption Orders to provide for  entry  of\r\n\r\npersons  from  the States of Malaya into Singapore  and\r\n\r\nvice-versa without a permit or a pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Exemption Orders, provision would be made to\r\n\r\nprohibit   undesirables  from  either  territory   from\r\n\r\nentering the other territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machinery by which Malaysia could exercise\r\n\r\nimmigration  control  at the Causeway  was,  therefore,\r\n\r\nalready  in  existence, and if there were persons  whom\r\n\r\nthe   Malaysian   Government   considered   undesirable\r\n\r\nelements,  or persona non-grata, or who were  held  to\r\n\r\nhave  subversive  intentions, these could  have  easily\r\n\r\nbeen  stopped by the Singapore immigration  authorities\r\n\r\nor the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  Police from travelling into Malaya  via  the\r\n\r\nCauseway. It has, therefore, come as a surprise  to  us\r\n\r\nthat this official machinery was brushed aside, and the\r\n\r\nfacility offered by Singapore Immigration to assist has\r\n\r\nbeen ignored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the many Singapore citizens who travel across\r\n\r\nthe Causeway to Johore Bahru to patronise Johore satay,\r\n\r\nmee  stalls and other establishments more esoteric, for\r\n\r\nthose who take weekends off to Mersing and Kota Tinggi,\r\n\r\nand  for international tourists who wish to see the odd\r\n\r\npineapple   or  rubber  plantation  in  Johore,   these\r\n\r\nrestrictions  certainly  must  make  them  think  twice\r\n\r\nwhether  it will be worth their while to endure custom,\r\n\r\nimmigration and police checks, in order that  they  can\r\n\r\npursue  the  little pleasures which nearby  Johore  may\r\n\r\noffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this is too serious a matter for us to\r\n\r\ntreat  as  a game of ping-pong. It will be childish  to\r\n\r\nanswer  every Malaysian ping with a pong. The Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  not retaliate by requiring  Malaysian\r\n\r\ncitizens in Singapore to report at police stations.  We\r\n\r\ndo  not  consider  Malaysian citizens  as  aliens  even\r\n\r\nthough  legally  they  are  distinguished  from  us  by\r\n\r\ncitizenship and, in any case, even aliens in  Singapore\r\n\r\ndo  not  have to report at police stations. It is  only\r\n\r\ncriminal law supervisees who are required to report  at\r\n\r\npolice  stations  in Singapore. We do  not  think  that\r\n\r\nanyone  who has intentions to subvert Singapore  or  to\r\n\r\njeopardise the internal security of the State will want\r\n\r\nto  report himself at a police station and announce his\r\n\r\nintentions to the sergeant-in-charge. We do  not  treat\r\n\r\nMalaysian  citizens in Singapore either as  undesirable\r\n\r\naliens,  subversives or criminals. Malaysians  who  are\r\n\r\nvisitors or residents in Singapore are not required  to\r\n\r\nreport at our police stations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August the 9th, the day of Singapore's separation\r\n\r\nfrom  Malaysia  last  year, I had  announced  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore end of the Causeway would always be  open  to\r\n\r\nMalaysians. We do not intend to impose any restrictions\r\n\r\nunless  and  until  the Malaysian Government  initiated\r\n\r\nthem,  because  we  consider  the  people  across   the\r\n\r\nCauseway our fellow brethren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  is with sorrow indeed that we hear of the Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment's intention to impose a border pass or  visa\r\n\r\nrequirement for visitors from Singapore in six  months'\r\n\r\ntime. I do not know whether the consequences of such  a\r\n\r\npolicy  have  been carefully studied,  what  impact  it\r\n\r\nwould create in the minds of those who, for business or\r\n\r\nother  reasons, travel very regularly between Singapore\r\n\r\nand Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether this scheme of immigration\r\n\r\ncontrol  is  to  be a permanent feature. Meanwhile,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to be patient and hope that it is not so. On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, if such immigration restrictions become  a\r\n\r\npermanent  feature of Malaysian policy, then  obviously\r\n\r\nSingapore  must  re-examine  the  position.  Until  the\r\n\r\npicture becomes clearer, we intend to keep our  end  of\r\n\r\nthe Causeway open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had hoped that the assurance which I had given on the\r\n\r\nnight of Friday, the 15th of April, that Singapore will\r\n\r\nnot  be used as an instrument to injure Malaysia  would\r\n\r\nhave been accepted in good faith. It has come to us  as\r\n\r\na  great disappointment indeed that, in spite of  this,\r\n\r\nsuch a precipitate step has been taken by the Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to repeat that recognition of a country's\r\n\r\nindependence  is  a unilateral act,  but  it  does  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  follow  that  there  will  be   diplomatic\r\n\r\nrepresentation  simply because of recognition.  In  any\r\n\r\ncase,  according to a Straits Times report  on  Friday,\r\n\r\nthe  15th of April, 1966, despatched from Bangkok by  a\r\n\r\nspecial  correspondent, an Indonesian official  who  is\r\n\r\nvery  close  to Lieut.-Gen. Suharto and Dr Adam  Malik\r\n\r\nhas  described  the  question  of  re-establishing   an\r\n\r\nIndonesian   mission  in  Singapore  as  of   secondary\r\n\r\nimportance.   The  Indonesian  official   was   further\r\n\r\nreported  to  have said that Indonesia  had  diplomatic\r\n\r\nrelations  with  many  countries  where  they  had   no\r\n\r\ndiplomatic missions. We assure the Malaysian Government\r\n\r\nthat  the question of Indonesia setting up a diplomatic\r\n\r\nmission  in Singapore will not be decided except  after\r\n\r\ndiscussion with the Malaysian Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one denies that our experience in the last war is\r\n\r\nthat  Malaya is indefensible without Singapore, and  so\r\n\r\nalso  Singapore  is indefensible without  Malaya,  i.e.\r\n\r\nMalaysia  today. It is common sense that  it  would  be\r\n\r\nfolly  for  Singapore to permit itself to  be  used  to\r\n\r\nconfront  Malaysia. I would like to  reiterate  to  the\r\n\r\npeople of Malaysia and the Malaysian Government that we\r\n\r\nwill  not  allow  Singapore to be used  as  a  base  by\r\n\r\nanybody  to  threaten the security of Malaysia.  It  is\r\n\r\nindeed  a pity that the Malaysian Government has  taken\r\n\r\nthis  precipitate  action by imposing  Causeway  travel\r\n\r\nrestrictions   in  anticipation  of  what   it   thinks\r\n\r\nSingapore  may  do.  It  is  our  hope  that  our  good\r\n\r\nintentions  towards  the people  of  Malaysia  and  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Government will be clear by our acceptance of\r\n\r\nthe invitation by the Malaysian Government to attend  a\r\n\r\nmeeting  on  mutual defence interests and economic  co-operation  between the officials of the two Governments\r\n\r\nwhich will be held on May the 9th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, I wish to ask questions on the Ministerial\r\n\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Sawmilling  is\r\n\r\none  of  the oldest industries established in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  at  present  provides employment  for  some  2,500\r\n\r\npersons  engaged in a total of 78 sawmills. Apart  from\r\n\r\ndirect employment in the sawmills, the export of timber\r\n\r\nprovides  a  livelihood for many other persons  in  the\r\n\r\ntimber  export  trade, transport industry  and  at  the\r\n\r\ndocks.  In  1964,  export of timber amounted  to  $44.3\r\n\r\nmillion  and  was the fifth largest single export.  For\r\n\r\n1965,  exports increased to $48.7 million and  advanced\r\n\r\nfrom the fifth to the fourth position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the progress shown, the timber export industry\r\n\r\nis  not  without  its  many difficulties.  One  of  its\r\n\r\nproblems  is that of part-time exporters and mala  fide\r\n\r\ntraders who indulge in unscrupulous practices and whose\r\n\r\nonly interest is in quick profits without any regard to\r\n\r\nthe  prestige and long-term interests of the  Singapore\r\n\r\ntimber industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also complaints from overseas importers\r\n\r\narising  from non-fulfilment of contracts due  to  time\r\n\r\nlapse, delay in shipment, disputes regarding quality of\r\n\r\ntimber  supplied  and  disruption of  overseas  markets\r\n\r\ncaused by unrealistic quotations by part-time exporters\r\n\r\nwithout any regard for local costs of production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timber industry associations and the Government\r\n\r\nauthorities in both Singapore and the States of  Malaya\r\n\r\nrecognised  these common problems and a  Working  Party\r\n\r\nformed  to  consider  the matter  has  recommended  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of a Pan-Malayan Timber Export  Industry\r\n\r\nBoard under parallel legislation in both territories to\r\n\r\ncontrol and promote our timber export industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore and the States of Malaya sell timber to\r\n\r\nthe  same  markets and a good part of the log  supplies\r\n\r\nfor our sawmills come from the States of Malaya, it  is\r\n\r\nclear that close co-operation between Singapore and the\r\n\r\nStates of Malaya is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Timber Export Industry Board which this Bill seeks\r\n\r\nto  set  up is based on similar principles adopted  for\r\n\r\nthe  Malayan  Rubber Export Registration Board  set  up\r\n\r\nunder   the   Rubber  Shipping  and   Packing   Control\r\n\r\nOrdinance, and the Malayan Pineapple Industry Board set\r\n\r\nup   under   the  Pineapple  Industry  Ordinance.   The\r\n\r\nessential features of these Boards are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) they are set up under parallel legislation in\r\n\r\nSingapore and in the States of Malaya;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) each Board has a chairman who is jointly\r\n\r\nappointed   by   both   territories,   and   with\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  both  Governments  and   the\r\n\r\ntrade associations concerned as members; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) they have powers to regulate the trade concerned\r\n\r\nand  to  impose  fees or cesses to provide  funds\r\n\r\nfor expenses of the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Boards are not only good examples of economic co-operation between the two Governments but also of\r\n\r\ncommon  effort and understanding between the Government\r\n\r\nand the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from provisions for the setting up of the Board\r\n\r\nand  rules  for  conduct  of  its  meetings,  the  Bill\r\n\r\nprovides for the regulation of export of timber by  the\r\n\r\nfollowing    two    types   of   export    registration\r\n\r\ncertificates:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) An ordinary export registration certificate to be\r\n\r\nissued  to a person who has exported not less  than 1,500  cubic  tons of timber during  the  preceding\r\n\r\nyear  and not less than 3,600 cubic tons of  timber\r\n\r\nduring  the  three  years  preceding  the  year  of\r\n\r\napplication; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A temporary export registration certificate to be\r\n\r\nissued  to  a  person who has  been  assured  of  a\r\n\r\nsupply\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof,  or  of producing not less than, 500 cubic  tons\r\n\r\nof   timber.

But\r\n\r\nfor  the  first year of operation, until the Board  has\r\n\r\ncollected  sufficient  funds from  cesses,  expenditure\r\n\r\nwill  be  met from an overdraft of a maximum of $50,000\r\n\r\nto   be  jointly  guaranteed  by  the  Governments   of\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned earlier, Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\npresent  Bill  is  an example of parallel  legislation.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives  of both Governments of  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  considered and agreed on a draft  Bill.  This\r\n\r\nBill is therefore identical in substance to the Malayan\r\n\r\nTimber Export Industry Board (Incorporation) Act, 1966,\r\n\r\npassed  by  the  Malaysian Parliament in  January  this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. -[Mr Lim Kim San].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CINEMATOGRAPH FILM HIRE DUTY BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, prior to Malaysia the Cinematograph Film Hire\r\n\r\nDuty  Ordinance,  1959, regulated the business  of  the\r\n\r\nhiring  and renting of cinematograph films and provided\r\n\r\nfor the imposition of film-hire duty on the renting  of\r\n\r\nfilms  and  the  control of charges of admission  to  a\r\n\r\ncinema,  theatre or other places, where such films  are\r\n\r\nexhibited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1965, when Singapore was still part of\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  this Ordinance was repealed by the Malaysian\r\n\r\nCinematograph Film Hire Duty Act, 1965.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that Singapore is no longer part of Malaysia but\r\n\r\nis  a sovereign nation, it is necessary to re-enact the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the former Ordinance, with such  changes\r\n\r\nof  phraseology  and terminology as  are  necessary  to\r\n\r\naccord with the independent status of the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, opportunity has been taken,\r\n\r\nwherever possible, to amend the provisions of  the  old\r\n\r\nlaw, where experience and improvements so require.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, provision is made in sub-clause (7) of\r\n\r\nclause 4 to require claims to be made in respect of any\r\n\r\nmoney  overpaid,  short-paid or  erroneously  refunded,\r\n\r\nwithin  the  period of one year after such  payment  or\r\n\r\nrefund,  instead  of  six months as  is  presently  the\r\n\r\nrequirement,  as  this  would be administratively  more\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 15 and 22 contain minor changes of\r\n\r\nphraseology    and    procedure   for    administrative\r\n\r\nconvenience.

They  will  also  clarify   the\r\n\r\nposition  by  providing  for  the  annulment   of   the\r\n\r\nadjudication  after  the rescission  of  the  receiving\r\n\r\norder  and  by  empowering the  Court  to  rescind  the\r\n\r\nreceiving order when it annuls the adjudication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5 and 7 propose, by deleting the provisos to\r\n\r\nsections  17  (10)  and  31 (6) ,  to  give  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  the High Court the same  powers  as  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar in the holding of the public examinations  of\r\n\r\ndebtors and the examinations of other persons known  or\r\n\r\nsuspected  to  have  in their possession  any  property\r\n\r\nbelonging to the debtor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to now the creditors in a second bankruptcy are\r\n\r\nnot  entitled  to receive anything out of a  bankrupt's\r\n\r\nestate  until  the bankrupt has obtained his  discharge\r\n\r\nfrom  his first bankruptcy. The law in this regard  was\r\n\r\naltered  in England in 1913, and in 1959 the Federation\r\n\r\nof Malaya adopted the English law as regards the rights\r\n\r\nof  the  Official Assignee under different bankruptcies\r\n\r\nof the same debtor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 proposes to adopt the modern law in this\r\n\r\nregard. It is proposed that, in future, where there are\r\n\r\ntwo  bankruptcies  the undistributed  property  of  the\r\n\r\nbankrupt will vest in the Official Assignee on  account\r\n\r\nof  the  second bankruptcy and become divisible amongst\r\n\r\nthe  creditors of the second bankruptcy.  The  Official\r\n\r\nAssignee, as trustee of the first bankruptcy, shall  be\r\n\r\ndeemed  to  be  a creditor of the second bankruptcy  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  any  unsatisfied  balance  of  the   debts\r\n\r\nprovable  in the first bankruptcy. In this  way,  every\r\n\r\ncreditor of a bankrupt will be able to obtain dividends\r\n\r\nfrom the property of a bankrupt, no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatter whether he is a creditor of the first or of  the\r\n\r\nsubsequent  bankruptcies. The proposed  amendment  will\r\n\r\nhave retrospective effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 proposes to give power to the Official\r\n\r\nAssignee  to  make  an  allowance  to  members   of   a\r\n\r\nbankrupt's   family   for  their  support   after   the\r\n\r\nbankrupt's  death  and  also  to  defray  his   funeral\r\n\r\nexpenses.  The trustees in bankruptcy in  England  have\r\n\r\nhad   these  powers  for  many  years  now  under   the\r\n\r\nBankruptcy Rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 16 and 17 are introduced to simplify the\r\n\r\nprocedure  relating  to  investments  of  excess  funds\r\n\r\nstanding  to  the  credit  of  the  Bankruptcy  Estates\r\n\r\nAccount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed in clause 24 to alter the law relating\r\n\r\nto  married  women  and to make  them  subject  to  the\r\n\r\nBankruptcy  Ordinance in all respects as if  they  were\r\n\r\nsingle.  At  present,  a  married  woman  may  be  made\r\n\r\nbankrupt  only  if  it is shown that she  has  separate\r\n\r\nproperty.  The law was altered in England  by  the  Law\r\n\r\nReform (Married Women and Tortfeasors) Act, 1935, which\r\n\r\nassimilated to the general law the position of  married\r\n\r\nwomen  in  relation to bankruptcy.  In  the  States  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  married  women became subject  to  the  law  of\r\n\r\nbankruptcy since 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 27 makes provision for unclaimed dividends to\r\n\r\nbe  credited  to the Consolidated Fund if  they  remain\r\n\r\nunclaimed for seven years.

Sir,  it  is the duty of  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nprotect the people as a whole from acts of violence  by\r\n\r\na few criminals and disaffected persons. This Bill is a\r\n\r\nstep  towards  achieving this. Some  of  the  penalties\r\n\r\nprovided  for  in  the Bill have been  taken  from  the\r\n\r\nCorrosive   Substances  Ordinance,  1955,   which   was\r\n\r\napplicable to Singapore before Malaysia and  which  has\r\n\r\nnow  been  repealed. Where the provisions for penalties\r\n\r\ncontained  in the former Singapore Ordinance have  been\r\n\r\nconsidered  to  be inadequate, enhanced penalties  have\r\n\r\nbeen included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 seeks to enhance the penalty for carrying or\r\n\r\nbeing   in   possession  of  corrosive   or   explosive\r\n\r\nsubstances from three years' imprisonment and  whipping\r\n\r\nto  ten  years'  imprisonment and caning.

Clause 4 amends this to life imprisonment\r\n\r\nand caning.

It is proposed to make  the\r\n\r\nprovision  clear by making the provisions of section  8\r\n\r\nprevail  over those of section 10 of the Code.  (Clause\r\n\r\n5).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 17 of the Criminal Procedure Code imposes a\r\n\r\nrestriction on the powers of the High Court  to  impose\r\n\r\nsentences  where  the accused is charged  with  several\r\n\r\noffences.  This has been found undesirable in  practice\r\n\r\nand  it is proposed to remove this restriction. (Clause\r\n\r\n6).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 121 imposes a restriction on the admission of\r\n\r\nstatements  by  accused  persons  and  at  present  the\r\n\r\nconditions  have  to  be strictly  complied  with.  The\r\n\r\nposition in England is that the Judges' Rules  are  not\r\n\r\nconstrued   restrictively  but  the   Courts   have   a\r\n\r\ndiscretion to admit a statement even if the  Rules  are\r\n\r\nnot  formally and strictly observed, provided the Court\r\n\r\nis  satisfied that the statement is a voluntary one. It\r\n\r\nis  proposed to give this discretion to the  Courts  in\r\n\r\nSingapore under clause 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reference to preliminary inquiries in the case of\r\n\r\ntrials by a Judge without a jury is removed, as it  has\r\n\r\nbeen held by the Federal Court that it is not necessary\r\n\r\nto  have preliminary inquiries in such cases.

Where there is  a\r\n\r\nlarge number of accused persons, as in the Pulau Senang\r\n\r\ncase,  it  is necessary to summon more than 16  special\r\n\r\njurors or 30 common jurors. (Clause 34).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is made for the admissibility of reports by\r\n\r\nmedical,  scientific and other experts,  without  their\r\n\r\nbeing  called  to  give evidence,  unless  the  accused\r\n\r\nrequires  them  to  be called.

Largely  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of the Board's efforts, a total of 151  pioneer\r\n\r\ncertificates have been issued to 144 firms.  Of  these,\r\n\r\n95  pioneer firms have gone into production and another\r\n\r\n19   have  their  factories  under  various  stages  of\r\n\r\nconstruction.  The proposed subscribed capital  of  all\r\n\r\nthe  144  pioneer firms adds up to $266  million,  more\r\n\r\nthan half of which has been paid up. At full production\r\n\r\nthese pioneer firms are estimated to produce some  $869\r\n\r\nmillion  worth  of goods per year and  contribute  some\r\n\r\n$237 million worth to our national income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual output of the 95 pioneer firms in\r\n\r\nproduction had already reached $318 million in 1965 and\r\n\r\nthese  firms  contributed $79 million to  our  national\r\n\r\nincome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at the end of 1965, the pioneer firms in\r\n\r\nproduction  employed 10,500 workers.  It  is  estimated\r\n\r\nthat  when these firms reach full production, they will\r\n\r\nemploy 21,650 workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Board also subscribed to the\r\n\r\ncapital of industries and made loans to industries. The\r\n\r\ntotal   amount   committed  to  12  firms   in   equity\r\n\r\nparticipation is $122,175,000, of which more than  half\r\n\r\nhas been disbursed.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Board approved loans to 37 firms amounting\r\n\r\nto   $58,937,000,   of  which  $36,673,000   has   been\r\n\r\ndisbursed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at December 1965, the Board has acquired, or\r\n\r\ncommitted   to  acquire,  6,618  acres  of   land   for\r\n\r\nindustrial  development. Of these 6,122  acres  are  in\r\n\r\nJurong  and  the  rest  distributed  in  eight  smaller\r\n\r\nindustrial estates in various parts of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Jurong Industrial Estate, a total of 964 flats\r\n\r\nwere  allocated by December 1965, and a primary school,\r\n\r\na  post  office,  two  commercial  banks,  two  private\r\n\r\nclinics,  five provision shops and a community  centre,\r\n\r\nwere opened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Major projects which have been completed more\r\n\r\nrecently,  include the first deep-water  berth  at  the\r\n\r\nJurong  wharves  and  the railway  linking  the  Jurong\r\n\r\nIndustrial Estate to Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Board also established the\r\n\r\nnecessary  machinery to help producers  overcome  their\r\n\r\nproduction   and   sales  difficulties.   Through   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Research  Unit, Light Industries  Services,\r\n\r\nthe  Product and Design Centre, the Board has developed\r\n\r\na very cordial relationship with industrialists who now\r\n\r\nlook to the Board as a trusted consultant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have only mentioned some of the more tangible\r\n\r\nresults  of  the  efforts of the  Economic  Development\r\n\r\nBoard,  but  this is sufficient to show that  much  has\r\n\r\nbeen  done.  More remains to be done and can  be  done.\r\n\r\nExperience  has shown that the scope of  activities  of\r\n\r\nthe  Economic Development Board is very much restricted\r\n\r\nby  the  existing Economic Development Board Ordinance,\r\n\r\nNo.  21  of 1961. For instance, there have been various\r\n\r\nenquiries received by the Board as to whether the Board\r\n\r\ncould participate in the promotion or encouragement  of\r\n\r\ntourist  enterprises,  such as participation  in  hotel\r\n\r\nbuilding projects, and other tourist attractions. There\r\n\r\nhave  also been enquiries as to whether the Board would\r\n\r\nparticipate  in transportation projects,  such  as  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  shipping facilities for both  cargo  and\r\n\r\npassengers. These and many other activities  cannot  be\r\n\r\nperformed  by  the  Board under the present  Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThis set-back   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas,  therefore,  to  be  remedied  by  suitable\r\n\r\namendments to the existing Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 2 of the Economic Development Board\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill  is designed to  remedy  the  present\r\n\r\nsituation  by  re-defining \"industrial enterprises\"  to\r\n\r\ngive  the  Board powers to participate, inter alia,  in\r\n\r\ntourist  ventures, aircraft repairs, the working  of  a\r\n\r\nmine  or  quarry,  off-shore fisheries,  transportation\r\n\r\nventures, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity is also taken, Sir, to incorporate other\r\n\r\nprovisions which would improve the functioning  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard.

The  Board   is\r\n\r\nempowered to appoint committees and delegate powers  to\r\n\r\nsuch  committees. The Board is given  wider  powers  to\r\n\r\nraise  loans,  overdrafts and obtain credit  facilities\r\n\r\nfrom  suppliers so that it need not depend entirely  on\r\n\r\nGovernment  for loan funds.

The main purpose of the Bill is\r\n\r\nto  seek  to  re-enact the provisions of the  Financial\r\n\r\nProcedure  Ordinance, 1959, of Singapore  with  textual\r\n\r\nchanges  and changes of terminology taking  account  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's status as an independent Sovereign Republic\r\n\r\nand  to provide that the Financial Procedure Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1957, of Malaysia shall cease to apply to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to include\r\n\r\namendments  considered  desirable  in  the   light   of\r\n\r\nexperience gained since 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important variation from the Financial\r\n\r\nProcedure  Ordinance,  1959,  of  Singapore  is  a  new\r\n\r\nprovision  in section 7 (3) (d) enabling the Government\r\n\r\nto  invest  moneys in the securities of, or  guaranteed\r\n\r\nby,   any   government   or   international   financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions such as the World Bank, the International  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nMonetary  Fund, the  International  Bank  for\r\n\r\nReconstruction   and   Development,   etc.   Previously\r\n\r\ninvestments  were limited to the Sterling  bloc  unless\r\n\r\nauthority was obtained by resolution of the Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly (Parliament). The flexibility to invest  in  a\r\n\r\nwider  range of securities would enable the  Government\r\n\r\nto  take  advantage  of  fields  of  investments  where\r\n\r\nreturns are higher as well as maintain reserves in hard\r\n\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the transitional provisions under section 26,\r\n\r\nauthority is sought to validate the sums of $42,522,019\r\n\r\nand  $650,000 which were approved by resolution of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly in 1959 and 1960 by deeming  them\r\n\r\nto have been approved by resolution of Parliament under\r\n\r\nsection 9 of this Act. The earlier approvals were valid\r\n\r\nunder  Singapore's Financial Procedure Ordinance, 1959,\r\n\r\nbut   were  not  covered  by  the  Financial  Procedure\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  1957, of Malaysia and the intention  is  to\r\n\r\nregularise  the  position so as to put  it  beyond  any\r\n\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 12 (5) and section 13 (2) of the Singapore\r\n\r\nFinancial  Procedure  Ordinance,  1959,  provided   for\r\n\r\nwarrants issued in any financial year to lapse  at  the\r\n\r\nclose   of  that  year.  This  results  in  unnecessary\r\n\r\nadministrative inconvenience and it is felt that  there\r\n\r\nis  no special reason why a warrant issued should lapse\r\n\r\nat  the end of the financial year.

With the passage of\r\n\r\ntime, the Fisheries Ordinance has become antiquated and\r\n\r\nis no longer adequate to deal with present-day problems\r\n\r\nof  fishermen or to serve the purpose of developing  an\r\n\r\nup-to-date and modern fishing industry in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fisheries Bill will rectify many shortcomings in\r\n\r\nthe   Fisheries   Ordinance.  Whereas   the   Fisheries\r\n\r\nOrdinance  provides mainly for the control of  in-shore\r\n\r\nfisheries,   the  Fisheries  Bill  provides   for   the\r\n\r\nregulation  and  control  of  off-shore  and   deep-sea\r\n\r\nfisheries.  It is the Government's aim to promote  off-shore and deep-sea fisheries in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also provide, inter alia, for the\r\n\r\ndistribution  of  fish, the use  of  certain  areas  as\r\n\r\nfishing  ports  or harbours, the methods of  processing\r\n\r\nfish,   the  manning  of  fishing  vessels,   and   the\r\n\r\nconditions of employment of fishing crew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be seen that the Bill is comprehensive and\r\n\r\nhas  provisions covering all important aspects relating\r\n\r\nto the fishing industry which are necessary to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nput  it  on  a modern footing.

As this Bill  will  change  the\r\n\r\nexisting  law and will affect the right of a person  to\r\n\r\nwill  away his property as he likes, it is proposed  to\r\n\r\nrefer   it   to  a  Select  Committee,  so  that   full\r\n\r\nconsideration can be given to its provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former English law did provide for family\r\n\r\nprovision in giving the wife a right to dower by virtue\r\n\r\nof  which, if the wife survived her husband, she became\r\n\r\nentitled  to an estate for life in a third of  all  her\r\n\r\nhusband's freeholds of which he had been seised at  any\r\n\r\ntime  during  the marriage. As this right of  the  wife\r\n\r\nattached even though the husband  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalienated the land, it gave rise to a great  deal\r\n\r\nof practical inconvenience and was eventually abolished\r\n\r\nby the Dower Act of 1833. After that, there was nothing\r\n\r\nto  stop a man (or a woman with respect to her separate\r\n\r\nproperty)  from  devising  and  bequeathing  his  whole\r\n\r\nestate to charity or to a complete stranger and leaving\r\n\r\nhis  widow  and children penniless. It was  to  prevent\r\n\r\nthis   evil  that  in  1938  the  Inheritance   (Family\r\n\r\nProvision) Act was enacted. That Act did not cast  upon\r\n\r\nthe  testator  any  positive duty  to  make  reasonable\r\n\r\nprovision   for  his  dependants,  for  it   would   be\r\n\r\nimpossible  to  enforce  any such  obligation,  but  it\r\n\r\nprovided that if he fails to do so, the Court may order\r\n\r\nsuch  reasonable provision as it thinks fit to be  made\r\n\r\nof the estate to his dependants, as defined in the Act.\r\n\r\nThe  Act  was further amended in 1952 to extend  it  to\r\n\r\ncases of intestacy, as it was felt that the general law\r\n\r\nof  intestacy might leave a child inadequately provided\r\n\r\nfor. The provisions relating to family provision appear\r\n\r\nto  have  worked well in England and it is proposed  to\r\n\r\nintroduce them into Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslim law contains provisions to safeguard the\r\n\r\nposition  of widows and children in cases of  intestacy\r\n\r\nand  there is already existing provision in section  41\r\n\r\nof  the Muslims Ordinance, 1957, to enable the Court to\r\n\r\nvary  the  will of a Muslim testator to make  provision\r\n\r\nfor  his heirs. It is therefore not proposed to  extend\r\n\r\nthe legislation to Muslims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has been considered by the Singapore Bar\r\n\r\nCommittee and has been agreed to by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Bill be committed to a Select Committee\r\n\r\nconsisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and seven Members\r\n\r\nto be nominated by the Committee of Selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Bill be committed to a Select Committee\r\n\r\nconsisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and seven Members\r\n\r\nto be nominated by the Committee of Selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LIMITATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Limitation Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1959,  to  reduce the period of limitation for  damages\r\n\r\nfor  personal  injuries from six years to three  years.\r\n\r\nThis will bring the law in line with the law in England\r\n\r\nwhere the period of limitation was fixed at three years\r\n\r\nby the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions) Act, 1954.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the amendment will be that in general\r\n\r\nactions  for  personal injuries, arising, for  example,\r\n\r\nfrom  motor-car  accidents, may only be brought  within\r\n\r\nthree years of the accident. It is desirable that  such\r\n\r\nactions  should be heard as soon as possible after  the\r\n\r\naccident,  as, if the action is instituted, say,  after\r\n\r\nfour or five years, it would be difficult for witnesses\r\n\r\nto  testify  about  the accident  with  any  degree  of\r\n\r\naccuracy.   The   Act   will  therefore   prevent   the\r\n\r\ninstitution  of stale proceedings. Police investigation\r\n\r\npapers  are  normally destroyed by the  Police  two  or\r\n\r\nthree  years  after  an accident  and  if  actions  are\r\n\r\nbrought after that, police witnesses will be unable  to\r\n\r\nrefresh their memories from statements or plans made by\r\n\r\nthem soon after the accident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is felt that the reduction of the limitation\r\n\r\nperiod to three years would cause no hardship to  third\r\n\r\nparties.  Injuries  caused by motor accidents  normally\r\n\r\nbecome  obvious immediately after the accident and  the\r\n\r\nwide   publicity  given  to  proceedings  relating   to\r\n\r\naccidents  in  the local Press and the availability  of\r\n\r\nlawyers  make it possible for any third party  to  take\r\n\r\nadvice and action within a reasonably short time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has been referred to the Singapore Bar\r\n\r\nCommittee and they support its provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Yong Nyuk Lin].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PREVENTION OF CORRUPTION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prevention of Corruption Ordinance, 1960, certain\r\n\r\namendments  to  which  have  become  necessary,  itself\r\n\r\nreplaced the 1937 Ordinance with the same title and the\r\n\r\nEvidence  (Special  Provisions)  Ordinance  enacted  in\r\n\r\n1946.

By such\r\n\r\namendment of section 16 of the Ordinance, sections 16A\r\n\r\nand 16B will become redundant and it is proposed in\r\n\r\nclause 12 to repeal them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of clauses 13 and 14 of the Bill is to\r\n\r\ndefine more specifically in section 17 of the Ordinance\r\n\r\nthe extent of the special powers of investigation which\r\n\r\nthe Public Prosecutor may confer on the Director, or an\r\n\r\nAssistant Director of the Corrupt Practices\r\n\r\nInvestigation Bureau, or any police officer of or above\r\n\r\nthe rank of Assistant Superintendent for the more\r\n\r\neffective investigation of corrupt practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 15 to 18 extend to the Director and any\r\n\r\nAssistant Director certain powers of investigation,\r\n\r\nsearch, etc., provided under sections 18, 20, 24 and 25\r\n\r\nof the Ordinance for special investigators of the\r\n\r\nBureau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 seeks to amend section 26 of the Ordinance in\r\n\r\norder to provide that the abettor of an offence of\r\n\r\ncorruption shall on conviction be liable to be punished\r\n\r\nwith the punishment provided for the offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By clause 20 will be enacted two new sections which\r\n\r\nwill make attempts to commit, or conspiracy to commit,\r\n\r\nany offence under the Ordinance punishable as for the\r\n\r\noffence itself.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 introduces a new section under which a\r\n\r\ncitizen of Singapore committing an offence under the\r\n\r\nOrdinance outside Singapore will be dealt with in\r\n\r\nrespect of such offence as if he had committed it in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Yong Nyuk Lin].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.51 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 3 inclusive ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, lines 17 and 18, to leave out\r\n\r\n\"investigators and special investigators\" and insert\r\n\r\n\"investigator and special investigator\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 20, to leave out \"officers\" and\r\n\r\ninsert \"officer\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4, as amended, ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Members  are  doubtless aware that  the  present\r\n\r\nEdition  of  the  Laws of Singapore was published  more\r\n\r\nthan  ten  years ago, and that during this period  far-reaching  constitutional  changes  have  taken   place,\r\n\r\nending  with the separation of Singapore from  Malaysia\r\n\r\nin August last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even had this last event not occurred with the\r\n\r\nattendant modifications in the law occasioned  thereby,\r\n\r\nit would have been nonetheless necessary to bring out a\r\n\r\nRevised  Edition of the Laws as soon as  possible.  But\r\n\r\nthis factor, taken in conjunction with the fact that we\r\n\r\nhave  had  numerous amending Ordinances since the  last\r\n\r\nEdition  of the Laws was published a decade  ago  which\r\n\r\nneed  to  be  fused  into  their  respective  principal\r\n\r\nOrdinances, makes the preparation and publication of  a\r\n\r\nRevised Edition of the Laws a matter of some urgency if\r\n\r\nwe  are  to  have a handy manual of laws  consolidated,\r\n\r\nmodified,  amended,  and brought up  to  date  so  that\r\n\r\n\"looking up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  law\"  is not the frustrating, tiresome  and  often\r\n\r\ndifficult process that it now is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the earliest days when Singapore was part of\r\n\r\nthe   Straits   Settlements,  there   have   been   six\r\n\r\nconsolidations  or  revisions  of  the  laws  affecting\r\n\r\nSingapore:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) First was published a revision in two volumes of\r\n\r\nthe  Acts and Ordinances of the Legislative Council\r\n\r\nof  the  Straits Settlements from 1st April,  1867,\r\n\r\nto 1st June, 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The second revision embraced the Acts and\r\n\r\nOrdinances  of  the  Legislative  Council  of   the\r\n\r\nStraits  Settlements from 1st April, 1867,  to  7th\r\n\r\nMarch, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Next was the Revision of 1920; this Revision\r\n\r\nwhich  was  prepared under the Law Revision  Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1910,   was   published  in  1920  and  contained   the\r\n\r\nOrdinances amended up to 31st December, 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The succeeding Edition of the Laws of the Straits\r\n\r\nSettlements  was  published in 1926 and  contained  the\r\n\r\nlaws in force on 31st December, 1925.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) The 1936 Edition which followed was prepared under\r\n\r\nthe  authority of the Revised Edition of  the  Laws\r\n\r\nOrdinance,   1935,  and  contained  the  Ordinances\r\n\r\namended to 31st December, 1935.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) Finally, we have the present 1955 Edition of the\r\n\r\nLaws  in eight volumes with Annual Supplements for  the\r\n\r\nyears 1956 to 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, then, was the position with regard to\r\n\r\nlegislation  in  Singapore immediately before  Malaysia\r\n\r\nDay,  at  which time the law could be ascertained  with\r\n\r\nthe   exercise   of   reasonable  diligence.   However,\r\n\r\nconsequent  partly  on  the multitudinous  Modification\r\n\r\nOrders issued principally in Kuala Lumpur during\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  period Singapore was part of Malaysia, and  partly\r\n\r\nbecause  of the various amending Ordinances  that  have\r\n\r\nbeen enacted in Singapore over the last ten years,  our\r\n\r\nlaws  are not as readily ascertainable as we would like\r\n\r\nthem  to  be,  and  it is therefore my  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's  Chambers and the  Ministry  of  Law\r\n\r\nwill make it possible to render the perusal of any part\r\n\r\nof our Statute Book a painless one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will recall that section 13 of the Republic\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  Independence Act, 1965, provides,  inter\r\n\r\nalia, that the President may, by order made at any time\r\n\r\nduring  the period of three years after the  Act  comes\r\n\r\ninto force, make such modifications in any written  law\r\n\r\nas  appear to be necessary or expedient as a result  of\r\n\r\nthe  passing  of  the  Act and of the  independence  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  upon separation from Malaysia.  Pursuant  to\r\n\r\nthis  provision, modification orders, prepared  by  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General, have been published. With a  view  to\r\n\r\nfacilitating a reading of the laws modified during  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian period and also in consequence of orders made\r\n\r\nunder the Republic of Singapore Independence Act, 1965,\r\n\r\nit  is  proposed to publish reprints of laws, embodying\r\n\r\nall  amendments  and modifications whatsoever  made  to\r\n\r\nthem  during  the last ten years, and several  reprints\r\n\r\nhave  already  been published. The Interpretation  Act,\r\n\r\n1965,  at  section 38 provides the necessary  authority\r\n\r\nfor  the issue of reprints of our laws, and these  will\r\n\r\nform  part of the next Revised Edition of the  Laws  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the contents of the Revised Edition of\r\n\r\nthe  Laws  Bill,  it will be seen that it  follows  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  design  of  the Revised Edition  of  the  Laws\r\n\r\nOrdinance   at  Chapter  1  of  our  present   Edition.\r\n\r\nProvision is made in the Bill for the appointment of  a\r\n\r\nLaw Revision Commission. The purpose of this Commission\r\n\r\nmust  not  be  misunderstood; its function  is  not  to\r\n\r\nrevise  legislation in the sense of improving  it  with\r\n\r\nthe   object  of  effecting  any  changes   which   the\r\n\r\nCommission,   or   the  public  making  representations\r\n\r\nthrough the Commission, might consider desirable;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnor  is  it the function of the Commission to introduce\r\n\r\nlegislative  measures  or  concepts  of  advantage   to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Rather, its purpose is solely  to  issue  a\r\n\r\nrevised   edition  of  all  principal  and   subsidiary\r\n\r\nlegislation,   faithfully   incorporating    all    the\r\n\r\namendments  and modifications that have been  made  and\r\n\r\npublished   to   date,  either  by  way  of   statutory\r\n\r\nenactments or Modification Orders. The President is  to\r\n\r\nappoint the Law Revision Commission comprising, as  Law\r\n\r\nCommissioners,  the  Attorney-General  and  such  other\r\n\r\nperson  as may be appointed by the President to prepare\r\n\r\nand  publish  a Revised Edition of Acts and  a  Revised\r\n\r\nEdition  of  Subsidiary Legislation.  The  Commission's\r\n\r\nwork  is  purely  technical and is clearly  defined  at\r\n\r\nclause  4 of the Bill. What the Commission is empowered\r\n\r\nto   do   in  the  process  of  revision  is  carefully\r\n\r\ncircumscribed; the Commission is charged with the  task\r\n\r\nof  making the law, as it stands, readable, but it  has\r\n\r\nno  authority  to  indulge  in  the  luxury  of  making\r\n\r\ninnovations to the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal feature of the Bill and the manner in\r\n\r\nwhich it departs from previous enactments of this  kind\r\n\r\nis  that  the Revised Edition of Acts and of Subsidiary\r\n\r\nLegislation  may  be  prepared and  published,  at  the\r\n\r\nCommissioners'  discretion, volume by  volume,  in  any\r\n\r\nsequence  and at such times as they may deem expedient.\r\n\r\nInstead,  therefore, of the usual tedious  interval  of\r\n\r\nseveral years before the Revised Edition as a whole  is\r\n\r\npublished,  volumes will appear one  after  another  as\r\n\r\nrapidly as possible, each volume coming into force from\r\n\r\nsuch date as the President may determine. While, in the\r\n\r\ncase  of  the previous Edition, it took four years  for\r\n\r\nthe  preparation and publication of the  whole  Revised\r\n\r\nEdition, it is hoped to print the first volume  of  the\r\n\r\nnew Edition shortly and to make available the remaining\r\n\r\nvolumes,  one by one, to the Bench, the Bar, Government\r\n\r\nofficers, the public and all those who need to refer to\r\n\r\nour laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides that upon the completion of any\r\n\r\nvolume  of the Revised Edition of Acts or of Subsidiary\r\n\r\nLegislation,  the Commissioners shall transmit  a  copy\r\n\r\nthereof  to  the  President who may specify,  by  order\r\n\r\npublished  in  the  Gazette,  the  date  on  which  the\r\n\r\ncompleted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvolume  shall come into force, and from that  date  the\r\n\r\nlaws  in question will become part of the Statute  Book\r\n\r\nof Singapore. It is provided that after the publication\r\n\r\nof   that  order,  the  volume  in  question  shall  be\r\n\r\npublished and presented to Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Revised Edition of the Laws\r\n\r\nBill,  when enacted, will be the instrument which  will\r\n\r\nrender   possible  the  consolidation,  collation   and\r\n\r\ncodification of the laws of Singapore so that  the  law\r\n\r\non  any  particular subject can be  read  as  a  clear,\r\n\r\nconnected  and complete entity and so that  good  order\r\n\r\nand  certitude  will be brought into our Statute  Books\r\n\r\nwhere  chaos  once existed, and legislative  untidiness\r\n\r\ntransmuted  into coherent neatness.

V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nNational Registration Act, 1965, comes into operation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the  5th  May, 1966. We welcome the  issue  of  new\r\n\r\nplastic  Identity Cards because it will regularise  the\r\n\r\nanomalies. From what the Minister has earlier stated, I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that the new Identity Cards shall  be  used\r\n\r\nnot only as an Identity Card, but also serve as a Birth\r\n\r\nCertificate and Citizenship Certificate. This is really\r\n\r\nvery convenient to the public. But with only about  two\r\n\r\nweeks  to  go, the public are anxious and worried  over\r\n\r\nmany  things.  They are anticipating many  difficulties\r\n\r\nbecause   not  everyone  has  got  all  the   necessary\r\n\r\ndocuments   to   the  requirement  of   the   Act   and\r\n\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The utmost important but confusing problem is the\r\n\r\nnames  of  the  applicants. Sir, this matter  has  been\r\n\r\nraised  by  many hon. Members in this House. There  are\r\n\r\nBirth  Certificates without names. And there are  cases\r\n\r\nwhere  the  name in the Birth Certificate differs  from\r\n\r\nthat on the present Identity Card. Apart from the wrong\r\n\r\nnames,  there  are very many persons  whose  names  are\r\n\r\nwrongly  spelt,  either  in the Birth  Certificates  or\r\n\r\nIdentity Cards or both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, first I take the case of persons having\r\n\r\nunnamed Birth Certificates, or no Birth Certificates at\r\n\r\nall.  Quite  a  number of our voters  come  under  this\r\n\r\ncategory.  When  the  new plastic  Identity  Cards  are\r\n\r\nissued,  I do not know what the position will be  of  a\r\n\r\nperson  whose  name  appears in the  present  Electoral\r\n\r\nRegister but who does not possess any Birth Certificate\r\n\r\nor   Citizenship  Certificate,  but  only  a  Singapore\r\n\r\nIdentity  Card.  Such persons have  voted  in  so  many\r\n\r\nelections  in the past. Therefore, the fact  that  they\r\n\r\nhave  voted  in  so  many  elections  in  the  past  as\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens and are in possession of  Singapore\r\n\r\nIdentity  Cards issued in the earlier years  should  be\r\n\r\nsufficient  proof  to enable them  to  obtain  the  new\r\n\r\nplastic Identity Card for citizens. Many members of the\r\n\r\npublic  are  anxious  to  get  the  assurance  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mr Speaker, Sir, persons whose names are\r\n\r\nwrongly  spelt in their Birth Certificate  or  Identity\r\n\r\nCard or both. I quote a typical example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I quote here an Indian name. AMMANI AMMAL when\r\n\r\npronounced  sounds like EMILY AMMAL or HOW MANY  AMMAL.\r\n\r\nWhen the informant who goes to register the birth is an\r\n\r\nilliterate,  and the officer who registers  is  a  non-Tamil, AMMANI will sound like EMILY or HOW MANY, and  I\r\n\r\nwould  not be surprised if he writes the name as  EMILY\r\n\r\nor  HOW  MANY. So, Sir, numerous examples can be quoted\r\n\r\nfor  such cases. And again, a person may have his  name\r\n\r\nwrongly  spelt in the documents he has, as in the  case\r\n\r\nquoted by me just now, or a person may wish to have his\r\n\r\nname  spelt in a slightly different way, or he may even\r\n\r\nwish  to  have the name abbreviated. You  can  take  my\r\n\r\nname, for instance. My full name is VISVALINGAM son  of\r\n\r\nSUPPIAH. I spell it V-I-S-V-A-L-I-NG-A-M. But there may\r\n\r\nbe  people who like to spell it as VISUVALINGAM with an\r\n\r\naddition of the letter 'U'. Or I may like to shorten it\r\n\r\nto  S. V. LINGAM. So, Sir, such changes and corrections\r\n\r\nin   spelling  should  be  allowed  during   this   re-registration.  And  to do this, I  think  the  Minister\r\n\r\nshould issue directives that when an applicant requests\r\n\r\nfor such reasonable changes or corrections in the name,\r\n\r\nand  if the Registration Officer is satisfied that  the\r\n\r\napplicant's  name  has  been  wrongly  spelt   in   the\r\n\r\ndocuments  produced,  the  Registration  Officer  shall\r\n\r\nissue the new plastic Identity Card with the name spelt\r\n\r\nas  desired by the applicant. In case of any doubt, the\r\n\r\nRegistration  Officer can always refer  the  matter  to\r\n\r\nHeadquarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the difficulties in wrong names and wrong\r\n\r\nspellings  could  be  overcome to some  extent  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister will staff the different Registration Centres,\r\n\r\nas  far  as possible, with persons who know the various\r\n\r\nofficial languages, i.e. Malay, Chinese, and Tamil. For\r\n\r\nexample, more Chinese-speaking officers to be  sent  to\r\n\r\nthe  Chinatown  area, Malay-speaking  officers  to  the\r\n\r\nGeylang  area, Tamil-speaking officers to the Serangoon\r\n\r\narea,  etc. This will be easier to the public and  will\r\n\r\nspeed up the re-registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one more point. I know the particulars of the\r\n\r\napplicant in the card to be issued will be in  English.\r\n\r\nWill the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister consider writing the names of Malays,  Chinese\r\n\r\nand  Tamils in their respective languages also, so that\r\n\r\neven if a mistake is made in the English spelling,  the\r\n\r\nname written in the other languages will be a guide?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of difficulty about adopted children\r\n\r\nalso.  It is common in Singapore for Indians or  Malays\r\n\r\nto  adopt  Chinese  children or vice  versa.  When  the\r\n\r\nparents  have  legal  adoption  papers,  there  is   no\r\n\r\ndifficulty.  But, Sir, not all the adopted parents  are\r\n\r\nso   wise   and   legal-minded  as   to   foresee   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties. So there are many people who do not  have\r\n\r\nany  sort of documents to prove their adoption. In such\r\n\r\ncases,  the  new Identity Cards should be issued  under\r\n\r\nthe adopted names and races.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there should be cross-reference\r\n\r\nbetween  the new and old Identity Cards. When  the  new\r\n\r\nIdentity  Cards are issued, I do not know  whether  the\r\n\r\nnumber  and the date of issue of the old, that  is  the\r\n\r\npresent  Identity  Card, will  be  quoted  in  the  new\r\n\r\nIdentity  Card.  If  provision  is  not  made  for  the\r\n\r\ninclusion  of the number and date of issue of  the  old\r\n\r\nIdentity  Card in the new Identity Card, there  may  be\r\n\r\ndifficulties to prove the length of residence.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not wish to elaborate on this but hope the Minister\r\n\r\nwill consider this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the applicant has to give the Registration\r\n\r\nOfficer  certain  particulars  regarding  himself.  And\r\n\r\namong  them  are his race and language. In my  opinion,\r\n\r\nthese two should have relationship. For example, in  my\r\n\r\ncase, my language is Tamil; and naturally it follows my\r\n\r\nrace is also Tamil, rather than Indian which may not be\r\n\r\naltogether wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Sir, is the change of address and\r\n\r\noccupation. When a person changes his address, I  think\r\n\r\nhe  will  be  given  a separate card  showing  the  new\r\n\r\naddress.  What  happens  when  a  person  changes   his\r\n\r\noccupation? Will he be issued with an additional  card,\r\n\r\nor will it be necessary for him to replace his Identity\r\n\r\nCard, which would mean he has to pay a fee of $5? Can I\r\n\r\nhave the Minister's clarification on this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In passing, I would like to speak on reporting the\r\n\r\nloss   of   an  Identity  Card  and  applying   for   a\r\n\r\nreplacement.  Sir,  section  10  (1)  of  the  National\r\n\r\nRegistration  Act,  1965, says  that  a  person  should\r\n\r\nreport  to  the nearest Registration Office  about  the\r\n\r\nloss  and  apply for a replacement. It was the practice\r\n\r\nto  report the loss of an Identity Card to the  nearest\r\n\r\npolice  station. But since 1962, I understand, that  is\r\n\r\nnot so. The person has to go all the way from whichever\r\n\r\ncorner  he may live to Headquarters to make the  report\r\n\r\nof loss and then again to collect the replacement. This\r\n\r\nputs the public to a lot of inconvenience. When the Act\r\n\r\ncomes  into  force, I do not know whether  Registration\r\n\r\nOffices would be set up at various places. If not so, I\r\n\r\nwould request the Minister to consider using the police\r\n\r\nstations for this purpose, so that the public  may  not\r\n\r\ngo to Headquarters more than once. What I mean is, when\r\n\r\nan Identity Card is lost, the holder reports the matter\r\n\r\nto  the  nearest  police station, and  also  gives  his\r\n\r\napplication  for  a  replacement  there.   Later   when\r\n\r\neverything is ready, Headquarters informs the applicant\r\n\r\nand  he  goes  and  collects it from Headquarters.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, this will save a lot of trouble  for  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I understand sections 15 and 16 of the\r\n\r\nNational     Registration    Regulations,    Subsidiary\r\n\r\nLegislation  Supplement No. 25, page  148,  section  15\r\n\r\nwhich reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'15. Any person who has obtained his identity card or\r\n\r\nreplacement  thereof  before  attaining  the   age   of\r\n\r\nseventeen  years shall re-register within a  period  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  five  years  from  the  date  of  his  first\r\n\r\nregistration.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And section 16 says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'16. Any person of the age of seventeen years and\r\n\r\nabove  who  has  obtained  his  identity  card   or   a\r\n\r\nreplacement  thereof shall register  within  the  tenth\r\n\r\nyear from the date of his last preceding registration.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, a person affected by the two sections will have to\r\n\r\nregister three times. I presume this is re-registration\r\n\r\nwhich  is an obligation under the Act, and will not  be\r\n\r\ntreated  as a replacement for the collection  of  fees,\r\n\r\nwhich  according  to  the schedule  is  $5.  Could  the\r\n\r\nMinister kindly give his assurance on this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the difficulties faced by the public\r\n\r\nin   this   re-registration,  the   officers   of   the\r\n\r\nRegistration   Centres   will   also   have    numerous\r\n\r\ndifficulties. They will be facing all sorts of  people.\r\n\r\nBut  whatever their difficulties may be,  I  hope  they\r\n\r\nwill be patient in dealing with people, especially  the\r\n\r\nuneducated, and treat them with courtesy. I  urge  them\r\n\r\nnot  to  lose  their  patience when  dealing  with  the\r\n\r\npublic.  I am sure thus they will get full co-operation\r\n\r\nfrom our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, Singaporeans would be much grateful to\r\n\r\nthe Minister and Government if wider publicity is given\r\n\r\nover  the  Radio, Television, and the Press  about  the\r\n\r\nprocedure  of re-registration. They should be  informed\r\n\r\nclearly  and in detail as to the documents they  should\r\n\r\nbring,  such as Birth Certificates, old Identity Cards,\r\n\r\nStatutory  Declarations,  adoption  papers,  passports,\r\n\r\netc.  It  would  be better if the non-English  educated\r\n\r\npersons  could  have their names and addresses  written\r\n\r\ncorrectly  by  their friends on a piece  of  paper  and\r\n\r\nproduce it to the Registration Officers so that the re-registration work could proceed smoothly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If no other Member wishes to speak on\r\n\r\nthis particular subject, I will call on the Minister to\r\n\r\nreply. Mr Jek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, in my speech on the Second Reading of the\r\n\r\nNational  Registration Bill on 22nd December,  1965,  I\r\n\r\nexplained  how  the re-registration of  the  population\r\n\r\nwill  be  carried out. I also made a statement in  this\r\n\r\nHouse   on  30th  December,  1965,  on  Unnamed   Birth\r\n\r\nCertificates to allay anxiety over a provision  in  the\r\n\r\nNational   Registration  Act.  In  that  statement,   I\r\n\r\nannounced  Government's policy in regard to documentary\r\n\r\nevidence  required  to establish Singapore  citizenship\r\n\r\nstatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then a lot of publicity has been given in the\r\n\r\nPress, over the radio and on television on the national\r\n\r\nregistration exercise. Recently a talk has been given\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the  Commissioner  for National  Registration  over\r\n\r\ntelevision  outlining  in  detail  the  procedures  for\r\n\r\nregistration,  the documents that are  required  to  be\r\n\r\nproduced at the time of registration. Further, meetings\r\n\r\nhave been held with principals of schools to brief them\r\n\r\non  this  exercise. Before the commencement of the  re-registration exercise on 5th May, 1966, more  publicity\r\n\r\nwill  be given. I propose to convene a meeting  of  all\r\n\r\nthe  Citizens'  Consultative Committees  to  call  upon\r\n\r\ntheir help in the re-registration work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my previous speech on this subject I have stated\r\n\r\nthat  the new system of re-registration will give  each\r\n\r\nSingapore resident a number which will be used for  all\r\n\r\npurposes in the future. The new citizen identity  card,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  pink  in colour, apart from its  own  serial\r\n\r\nnumber,  will  bear the birth register  number  or  the\r\n\r\nSingapore citizenship certificate number of the holder.\r\n\r\nTherefore, once a person has been issued with a citizen\r\n\r\nidentity   card,   he  will  have  no   difficulty   in\r\n\r\nestablishing his citizenship status in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member has raised the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  names being wrongly spelt either  in  the\r\n\r\nbirth certificates or in the present identity cards.  I\r\n\r\nwish  to  assure the Member that in the re-registration\r\n\r\nexercise,  this matter will be rectified once  and  for\r\n\r\nall. Any mistakes in the spelling of the names will  be\r\n\r\ngiven  sympathetic  consideration  and  if  these   are\r\n\r\ngenuine  errors,  they  will be rectified  in  the  new\r\n\r\nidentity cards. In the case of an illiterate applicant,\r\n\r\nit  is  suggested that his friend should assist him  by\r\n\r\nwriting out the correct spelling of his name on a  slip\r\n\r\nof  paper  which  he should bring at the  time  of  re-registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has also raised the question of\r\n\r\npersons   who   have  voted  but  could   not   produce\r\n\r\ndocumentary  evidence to prove that they are  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens.  The  House may be aware that  the  Electoral\r\n\r\nRoll has been compiled from the records of the existing\r\n\r\nidentity  cards. Where the persons' place of  birth  is\r\n\r\nshown  as  Singapore on such records, their  names  are\r\n\r\nautomatically put on the Electoral Roll when they  come\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nage.  As Members are aware, in the initial registration\r\n\r\nof  the  population  in  1948 for  identity  cards,  no\r\n\r\ndocumentary proof whatsoever was required to show their\r\n\r\nplace  of birth. In this exercise, however, it  is  the\r\n\r\nintention  of Government to rectify once  and  for  all\r\n\r\nmistakes   that  have  been  made  in  the  past.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  prepared  to  consider  sympathetically\r\n\r\nthose  who  claim to be born in Singapore but  with  no\r\n\r\ndocumentary  proof and have voted during the  last  few\r\n\r\nelections.  Such  cases  will be  considered  on  their\r\n\r\nindividual merits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for the information of the House, a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  over 500 temporary and permanent staff  have\r\n\r\nbeen   recruited  for  the  re-registration   exercise.\r\n\r\nConsideration  has been taken of the  multi-racial  and\r\n\r\nmulti-lingual  structure  of our  population,  and  the\r\n\r\nstaff  have  been recruited on that basis.  The  points\r\n\r\nraised  by  the  hon. Member that more Chinese-speaking\r\n\r\nofficers should be sent to Chinatown, or Malay-speaking\r\n\r\nofficers   to   the  Geylang  area,  or  Tamil-speaking\r\n\r\nofficers to the Serangoon area have all been taken care\r\n\r\nof.  However, it is not feasible to write the names  in\r\n\r\nMalay  or Chinese or Tamil in addition to the names  in\r\n\r\nEnglish  on  the  identity cards.  All  names  will  be\r\n\r\nwritten  in Roman alphabets on the identity  cards.  In\r\n\r\nthe  case of Chinese, their names in Chinese characters\r\n\r\nwill be taken down in their application forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> The Minister has just said that he will\r\n\r\nconsider  the  writing  of Chinese  characters  in  the\r\n\r\napplication forms. I do not know whether it will be too\r\n\r\nmuch if I ask him whether he will consider writing  the\r\n\r\nnames  in  romanised Malay and Tamil in the application\r\n\r\nforms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I have already said that the names\r\n\r\nwill  be  written  in Roman alphabets.  So  it  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary  to write the names again in romanised  Malay\r\n\r\nor  romanised  Tamil because it will  be  in  the  same\r\n\r\nalphabets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> I think the Minister did not understand\r\n\r\nwhat  I  said.  I  understand that the  names  will  be\r\n\r\nwritten  in English on the identity cards. But  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister said, for the Chinese, Chinese characters will\r\n\r\nappear  in the application forms. That is why  I  asked\r\n\r\nhim  whether it would be too much if he would  consider\r\n\r\nputting  a  Malay  name  in  romanised  Malay  on   the\r\n\r\napplication form, or Tamil on the application form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member means written in the\r\n\r\nTamil  language.  Let us get the point  quite  clear  -\r\n\r\nwritten in the Tamil language?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Written in the Tamil language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Minister, now you know what the hon.\r\n\r\nMember wants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> That will be considered. I think\r\n\r\nthat  can be accepted if the hon. Member means to  have\r\n\r\nboth  the  romanised  names  and  Tamil  names  on  the\r\n\r\napplication  forms. In the case of Malays, their  names\r\n\r\nwill  already  be in romanised form.  So  there  is  no\r\n\r\nnecessity to put down their names again in Jawi on  the\r\n\r\napplication forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another point. Where a Chinese is adopted by a non-Chinese family and where no adoption papers have been\r\n\r\ntaken out, consideration will be given to entering  the\r\n\r\nadopted name on the identity card.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the hon. Member, the new\r\n\r\nidentity  card  will  show the number  of  the  present\r\n\r\nidentity  card and the date of its original  issue.  In\r\n\r\naddition,  the race and dialect group of the  applicant\r\n\r\nwill   be  entered  on  the  identity  card,  such   as\r\n\r\nChinese/Hokkien  or Chinese/Cantonese or  Indian/Tamil,\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The occupation of the holder will not be shown on the\r\n\r\nnew identity card, but if he changes his occupation, he\r\n\r\nneed   only   inform  the  Commissioner  for   National\r\n\r\nRegistration either in person or by post. Further,  the\r\n\r\nnew  plastic laminated identity card provides a  pocket\r\n\r\nfor the insertion of a change of address slip. Where  a\r\n\r\nperson  changes his address, he will report  either  to\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnearest  police station, post office or a  registration\r\n\r\ncentre to notify his change of address. He will fill  a\r\n\r\nvery  simple form and will be given at the same time  a\r\n\r\nchange of address slip which will be inserted into  the\r\n\r\npocket  provided for in the identity card. There  will,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  be no necessity for a holder of  a  plastic\r\n\r\nlaminated  identity card to change his card  completely\r\n\r\nwhen  he changes his residence. There will be no charge\r\n\r\nwhatsoever for effecting the change of address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration will be given in the future to\r\n\r\nestablishing   permanent   or  temporary   registration\r\n\r\ncentres  to deal with identity card matters,  including\r\n\r\nreports  of lost cards. In fact, the new Department  of\r\n\r\nNational  Registration  will have  mobile  registration\r\n\r\nteams  which  will visit certain centres all  over  the\r\n\r\nisland at fixed regular intervals. Details of this will\r\n\r\nbe announced at a later date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the hon. Member, any person\r\n\r\nwho is required to re-register under the provisions  of\r\n\r\nRegulations  15  and  16  of the National  Registration\r\n\r\nRegulations, 1966, will only have to pay a nominal  fee\r\n\r\nof  50 cents in the case of a citizen identity card and\r\n\r\none dollar in the case of a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnon-citizen identity card. Replacements required  under\r\n\r\nRegulations  15  and 16 are treated as  re-registration\r\n\r\nand not as replacements for lost or defaced cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure this House that the re-registration\r\n\r\nof  the  population has been so planned that as  little\r\n\r\ninconvenience  as  possible is caused  to  the  general\r\n\r\npublic.  Over the last one month, the staff  have  been\r\n\r\nundergoing vigorous training to carry out this exercise\r\n\r\nin  an  efficient and courteous manner.  In  return,  I\r\n\r\nwould ask the public to give their fullest co-operation\r\n\r\nby  bringing along the required documentary  proofs  of\r\n\r\ntheir citizenship as well as by answering questions put\r\n\r\nto  them  by the interviewing officers. By helping  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  this  manner,  they  will  be   helping\r\n\r\nthemselves. As I have said previously, the new  citizen\r\n\r\nplastic laminated identity card will in the future be a\r\n\r\npassport   to  social  amenities,  such  as  education,\r\n\r\nhousing, health and employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Twenty Minutes to Six o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
