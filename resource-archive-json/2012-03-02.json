that the geopolitical tensions\r\nin the Middle East and Iran's decision to halt oil exports to certain\r\nEuropean Union countries have not significantly affected global\r\noil supply at this point in time. The affected EU countries have\r\nstarted turning to alternative sources of crude oil supply to meet\r\ntheir needs. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer and\r\nexporter, has also made commitments to increase oil production to\r\ncompensate for any shortfall in supply due to the Iranian oil curbs. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1726</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7d095a6e-2656-451d-b8af-7c0a405771f1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-9d2bdc22-5b1d-40d6-81cb-5e6ee96c77f2__id-7d095a6e-2656-451d-b8af-7c0a405771f1\"><!--a--></a>Although the developments in Middle East\r\nare evolving and highly uncertain, they have not had a major impact\r\non our domestic costs at this juncture. As such, we are maintaining\r\nour 2012 GDP growth forecast at 1% to 3% and the CPI inflation forecast\r\nat 2.5% to 3.5%. The Government will continue to closely monitor\r\nthe situation, and take these into account when reviewing its GDP\r\ngrowth and inflation forecasts. Nevertheless, we recognise the risk\r\nthat a deteriorating situation in the Middle East may cause oil prices\r\nto raise. Indeed, UK Brent oil prices have risen from around US$110\r\nper barrel at the end of last year to more than US$120 per barrel\r\nrecently, close to the recent peak level registered in April 2011\r\nwhen the Middle East and North Africa faced significant political\r\nunrest. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-21201d76-d96e-4741-baae-dc5da6426227\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-9d2bdc22-5b1d-40d6-81cb-5e6ee96c77f2__id-21201d76-d96e-4741-baae-dc5da6426227\"><!--a--></a>Should this trend continue,\r\nwe, as a small economy almost wholly reliant on imported energy,\r\nwill face higher energy prices. Businesses, particularly in energy-intensive\r\nsectors such as transport and chemicals, could face rising costs.\r\nElectricity and gas tariffs may also increase as the price of natural\r\ngas, which is used for electricity and town gas production, is pegged\r\nto oil prices, which is the usual practice in the Asian gas market.\r\nTo enhance our resilience against supply and price shocks in uncertain conditions,\r\ndiversification of our energy sources is key. Diversification will\r\nhelp ensure that we continue to have secure and competitively priced\r\nenergy supplies to support our growth. We will continue to explore\r\nthe development of viable alternative fuel sources. For example,\r\nwe are building a Liquefied Natural Gas, or LNG, terminal which\r\nwill provide access to the global gas market. Electricity import\r\nis another option that we are considering, which could allow Singapore\r\nto tap into new energy options that may be unavailable or economically\r\ninfeasible in Singapore. The Government also works with industry\r\nplayers to explore alternative feedstock options to increase the\r\ncompetitiveness of the more energy-intensive industries, such as\r\nrefineries and crackers, in Singapore.

To be able to address the issue, SMEs must\r\nbe the focus as they are a significant part of our economy. To achieve\r\nthis, businesses have to invest in their people, processes and leverage\r\non technology to create higher value jobs for Singaporeans and those\r\nwho work in Singapore.

It will help to address the cashflow required for substantial\r\nupfront expenditure required for restructuring. I was heartened\r\nto hear from Deputy Prime Minister Tharman when he summed up the\r\nBudget that no effort would be spared to help SMEs in this drive\r\nto restructure their businesses. While I did get his assurance that SMEs\r\nwill not be required to read all the 66 pages of the PIC Guide to\r\napply for the scheme, I do, however, want to ask that we still give\r\nsome serious thought to simplification of the application process\r\nand the access to PIC. Apart from the complexity of the scheme and\r\nthe application process for the PIC, the feedback I received from\r\nthe various dialogues with business leaders indicates that the qualification\r\ncriteria for PIC are fairly rigid. In the ICPAS Pre-Budget 2012\r\nSurvey, although PIC was the top initiative that was utilised by\r\nrespondents, there was still a significant difference between widespread\r\nawareness and actual utilisation of the incentive scheme. To encourage\r\ngreater adoption of PIC by SMEs, I think that it would be worthwhile\r\nto review the qualification criteria and to simplify the application\r\nprocess. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-578c3fb7-3b5f-4fd1-8fa1-fd70a4b50893\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-578c3fb7-3b5f-4fd1-8fa1-fd70a4b50893\"><!--a--></a>A suggestion made to enhance\r\nthe adoption of the scheme is to have an exclusion list on what\r\nwould not qualify rather than a qualifying list.

This is not a good\r\ntrend as we may be over-investing and lack diversification in our\r\ninvestments, which could come back and haunt us doubly hard if these\r\nsectors are hit by problems.

This issue first came to my attention when I was attempting\r\nto solve yet another traffic problem in my area. This was the Sikh\r\ntemple at Jalan Bukit Merah which is an old temple and, therefore,\r\nthere is not an awful lot of parking space there. I noticed that\r\nthere was an unused school across the road and suggested that they\r\nmight want to consider applying for permission to use that to park\r\ncars. I applied to SLA for them. Approval was initially granted\r\nbut, for various reasons, the scheme has now not gone through partly\r\nbecause of the constraints in terms of time. It is only available\r\nfor a short period and it is now required for another use.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c4cd299d-ec1e-4fb3-918f-6f9572800c3b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-c4cd299d-ec1e-4fb3-918f-6f9572800c3b\"><!--a--></a>In the course of this,\r\nI realise that the TOL for use of that school was actually rather high\r\nand I made inquiries of SLA why that was the case. SLA informed\r\nme that currently the use of State land pursuant to TOL may be permitted\r\nupon payment of a licence fee but under current MOF requirements,\r\nthe TOL is charged at a commercial rate depending on the type of\r\nuse. And I thought whilst that was appropriate for commercial use,\r\nit may not be so suitable when the intended use is community use.\r\nSo I wanted to ask the Ministry of Finance whether it would be prepared\r\nto consider at least for such instances, TOL fee at a community\r\nrate for community use and/or for community uses. So, for example,\r\nchurches, temples or community organisations where it is clear that\r\nthe use is for a social or a community purpose.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-2cee1847-23d9-43c9-806c-43fe5b7013f8\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-2cee1847-23d9-43c9-806c-43fe5b7013f8\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading\" id=\"id-a2a0927a-7ef4-4175-bb8f-b3e56dbe0964\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a2a0927a-7ef4-4175-bb8f-b3e56dbe0964\"><!--a--></a>Encouraging Philanthropy</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3ab1ca53-2e79-4c7b-9496-b8b55c7ed8bd\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-3ab1ca53-2e79-4c7b-9496-b8b55c7ed8bd\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nSir, I am happy to learn that individual and corporate donations\r\nto Singapore charities have grown over the last decade. I also want\r\nto give due credit to the Finance Minister for the extension of\r\nthe 250% tax deduction benefit for donations to IPC at the last\r\nyear's Budget. This is a positive move which would entice donors\r\nto continue donating generously. However, while philanthropy have\r\nincreased in Singapore over time, when compare with many countries,\r\nwe are still lagging behind in charitable giving and generosity.\r\nIf the World Giving Index 2011 published by Charities Aid Foundation\r\nis any indication, Singapore was ranked No. 91 in the world. In\r\nthe whole of ASEAN, Singapore was just ahead of Vietnam but behind\r\nneighbouring countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-47a7133d-e221-47a6-b751-e8501f2ffe77\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-47a7133d-e221-47a6-b751-e8501f2ffe77\"><!--a--></a>Due to the globalised\r\nnature of our economy, Singapore experienced a wider income gap\r\nthan many countries. Based on a report by Boston Consulting Group,\r\nSingapore has the highest concentration of wealthy households in\r\nthe world; 15.5% or nearly one in every six households has more\r\nthan $1 million in assets. So, there is really no excuse why our\r\ncharitable donations are lagging behind countries that are less\r\naffluent than us. I hope the Ministry of Finance would look at further\r\nschemes to encourage philanthropy and to encourage those who have\r\ndone well to give back to society.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0ac0adce-aa6a-4acd-92b5-bb082c08d00a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-0ac0adce-aa6a-4acd-92b5-bb082c08d00a\"><!--a--></a>As only about 21% of the\r\npopulation in Singapore pay income tax, the reach of the income\r\ntax deduction benefit is quite limited.

At the end of the day, we would also want these charitable acts\r\nto come from our hearts. I hope that the Government can step up\r\nits messaging on philanthropy and encourage more giving by those\r\nSingaporeans who have done well. By cultivating the virtues of giving\r\nback to society, it is an important way to strengthen cohesiveness\r\nin our society even as the income and wealth gap widens.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-82a70ea9-528b-4150-ba20-aa09729235f0\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-82a70ea9-528b-4150-ba20-aa09729235f0\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1736</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ecfcfcd1-ae0e-4832-a2f6-b328d25cf555\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-ecfcfcd1-ae0e-4832-a2f6-b328d25cf555\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">The Minister of State for Finance (Mrs\r\nJosephine Teo)</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Chairman, first, let me thank\r\nall the Members who have spoken for their comments and suggestions\r\non a fairly wide range of topics. The questions and cuts that have\r\nbeen filed centre around three areas: the first is on facilitating\r\nbusinesses, especially our SMEs; the second is on an efficient and\r\neffective Government; the third is on how we can nurture a caring society.\r\nSir, I will address each of these themes in turn.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-047899f5-fb4b-47fe-a8f4-dd3b58c10911\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-047899f5-fb4b-47fe-a8f4-dd3b58c10911\"><!--a--></a>Let me start with facilitating\r\nbusinesses. Ms Jessica Tan and Ms Tan Su Shan suggested simplifying\r\nPIC and making it more accessible to SMEs. I think we have heard throughout\r\nthe debate many concerns on how SMEs can be helped to make this transition.\r\nWe share these concerns. I would like to emphasise that although\r\nthe PIC is available to all enterprises, it is, in fact, designed\r\nvery much with small businesses in mind. PIC is available to all\r\nenterprises and they can qualify without having to meet any special\r\ncriteria.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-24e1b988-b06b-48f5-8e19-2e7d3ade6706\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-24e1b988-b06b-48f5-8e19-2e7d3ade6706\"><!--a--></a> Now, all businesses,\r\nincluding small and micro enterprises as well as sole proprietors\r\ncan benefit from the PIC. Based on the tax returns filed last year,\r\none in three or more than 25,000 small companies claimed PIC. This\r\nis a good start since 2011 is the first year of PIC claims. We are\r\nquite confident that with improved awareness, more SMEs will be\r\nable to take advantage of the PIC.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-13f369e7-3613-4148-8290-3dcd2c03e1dc\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-13f369e7-3613-4148-8290-3dcd2c03e1dc\"><!--a--></a>Since the PIC was introduced\r\ntwo years ago, we have also acted on feedback and improved the scheme\r\nto better benefit small businesses. First, recognising the value\r\nof cash flow to small businesses, we allow them to opt for a cash\r\npayout as an alternative to tax deductions. So, for example, if\r\na small business incurred $10,000 worth of qualifying expenditure,\r\nit could previously get a cash payout of $3,000. From this year, the\r\ncash payout is doubled to $6,000. Second, the cash payout can now\r\nbe claimed at the end of each financial quarter rather than at the\r\nend of each financial year. So for SMEs, this further eases their\r\ncash flow. Third, we have made it easier for businesses to claim\r\nPIC for in-house training and they can now claim up to $10,000 per\r\nyear on their in-house training course without the need for certification\r\nby WDA or ITE. This change arose from the feedback we received about\r\nhow the scheme can help to benefit SMEs in particular.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e7decc25-985f-4e24-868f-930b68508b22\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-e7decc25-985f-4e24-868f-930b68508b22\"><!--a--></a> Some businesses may have\r\nthe impression that it is difficult to make PIC claims. In fact,\r\nthe process is fairly straightforward - the claims are made as part\r\nof the annual tax filing process. Quite a number of people do not\r\nrealise it. You have to file your tax returns anyway and whilst\r\nyou are filing your tax returns, you can make your PIC claims and\r\na taxpayer needs only to provide a few additional lines of information.\r\nI have checked it out myself. It is really just a few additional\r\nlines specifying what their productivity investments were. The PIC\r\ndoes not require an \"ocean of paperwork\" which was a phrase used\r\nby the hon Member Mdm Foo Mee Har yesterday, as feared by SMEs. No\r\nocean of paperwork. In fact, there is no need to produce any additional\r\nsupporting documents as this was discovered by Ms Yoong Chwee Hwa,\r\nDirector of Creative Edge Consultants\r\nPte Ltd. They are a small business in design and project management,\r\nless than $2 million in turnover with fewer than five employees.\r\nLike many of the other SMEs who have actually claimed PIC, Ms Yoong\r\ntold us that she thought it was a lot simpler than she originally\r\nimagined. Now, if the earlier cash payout is preferred, a business\r\njust needs to complete an additional simple form. That is only if\r\nthey want the cash payout. Otherwise, if they want to claim it against\r\ntheir taxable income, they do not need to put in any additional\r\nform.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1737</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-aafbb3eb-6fb4-4161-847a-4f9a1bdee313\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-aafbb3eb-6fb4-4161-847a-4f9a1bdee313\"><!--a--></a> As the PIC is a relatively\r\nnew scheme, we fully recognise the importance of communications\r\nefforts which many MPs have emphasised, especially to SMEs.

This helps to prevent a potential gaming which Ms Tan\r\nalso expressed concern over, by individuals who set up businesses\r\nto get a cash subsidy for essentially personal purchases. So, if\r\nthey buy an iPad and set up a company, without this condition of\r\nthree-employee, they can also get this cash payout. That is the\r\npurpose for introducing this three-employee condition \u2013 only for\r\nthe cash payout, but not for the cash deduction. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-012efc68-87ce-4e93-82df-f404ad9c6e58\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-012efc68-87ce-4e93-82df-f404ad9c6e58\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading hcTime\" id=\"id-b476c486-5604-47fb-b1a3-5092fa006a7f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-b476c486-5604-47fb-b1a3-5092fa006a7f\"><!--a--></a>11.45 am</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3054b8ca-9c47-4dcf-ad69-e0b4637bed5b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-3054b8ca-9c47-4dcf-ad69-e0b4637bed5b\"><!--a--></a>We also like to thank\r\nMr Seng Han Thong for suggesting that taxi companies be allowed\r\nto claim PIC on the training of taxi drivers.

As\r\nan international business and financial centre, it is in Singapore's\r\ninterest for the SFRS to converge with the IFRS. Using a single\r\nset of high-quality globally-accepted financial reporting standards\r\nwill help to minimise reporting costs for our listed companies that\r\noperate in multiple jurisdictions and also make it easier for companies\r\nto participate in the international capital market. The SFRS is\r\nclosely modelled after the IFRS. In 2009, the Accounting Standards\r\nCouncil (ASC) announced that it would work towards full IFRS convergence for\r\nSingapore-incorporated companies listed on the Singapore Exchange\r\nby 2012.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2a2bb99f-dfa9-4c05-9fed-b1f80dd85727\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-2a2bb99f-dfa9-4c05-9fed-b1f80dd85727\"><!--a--></a>Since then, it has proactively\r\nengaged the International Accounting Standards Board on Singapore's\r\nconvergence initiative, commissioned in-depth research and undertaken extensive\r\nconsultations with our local stakeholders on the implementation\r\nplans. Internationally, there have been some delays to the broad\r\nconvergence initiative. Standards\r\nunder review by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)\r\nsuch as the revenue recognition and financial instruments have attracted\r\nextensive comments and differing views internationally and are unlikely\r\nto take effect before 1 January 2015. The Accounting Standards Council\r\nhas thus reviewed Singapore's convergence plans and concluded that\r\nwe should not rush into convergence until these key standards are\r\nfinalised so as to avoid additional transition costs for our listed companies.\r\nTherefore, our full IFRS convergence will not take place by 2012\r\nas originally envisaged. The timeline for convergence will be adjusted\r\nin tandem with international developments. The revised timeline\r\nwill be announced at an appropriate juncture, and we would like\r\nto assure the affected companies that we will give them adequate\r\ntime to prepare for it. Convergence is not expected to be unduly\r\ndemanding because our standards are already very much aligned, nor\r\nis convergence expected to result in significant costs for listed\r\ncompanies. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1739</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4644f487-2c9c-4def-bd21-280b64d7550c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-4644f487-2c9c-4def-bd21-280b64d7550c\"><!--a--></a>Sir, we had said that\r\nto further support internationalisation efforts, a Project Finance Company\r\n(PFC) will be operational from the second half of this year. Mr\r\nChen Show Mao sought to understand how the PFC will benefit local\r\ncompanies. The PFC addresses a market gap in long tenure, cross-border\r\nproject financing. The PFC, which is a commercial venture led by\r\nTemasek Holdings, will address this gap and catalyse the supply\r\nof such project financing. Local companies will benefit in the following\r\nways: first, access to financing gives them added confidence and\r\nability to bid for major projects on an equal footing with their\r\ncompetitors, who typically have funding support from their respective\r\nnational Export Import (EXIM) banks. The PFC removes a constraint\r\non our companies where Singapore companies have had to partner foreign contractors\r\nto tap financing facilities overseas. And, as Mr Chen pointed out,\r\nwe have put our companies at a slight disadvantage. So this opens\r\nup opportunities for our own SMEs to participate in these projects. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-826d58a6-936d-45b8-8d6c-cc21f7750e44\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-826d58a6-936d-45b8-8d6c-cc21f7750e44\"><!--a--></a>Mr Chen has a specific\r\nquestion on the definition of Singapore-based companies. We have\r\ndefined a Singapore-based company as one that is listed or incorporated\r\nin Singapore and have at least three global or regional strategic\r\ndecision-making functions located in Singapore. This is the definition\r\nthat is commonly used in incentive schemes of our enterprise development\r\nagencies. While this definition does include foreign companies based\r\nhere, these companies will have substantial presence anchored in Singapore.\r\nAnd there are significant spin-offs to the economy such as value-add\r\nand jobs created because they use Singapore as a base for internationalising\r\nand undertaking major projects overseas. This will strengthen our\r\nposition as a global Asia hub. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a60ba999-4f85-4823-8d58-899bced83344\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a60ba999-4f85-4823-8d58-899bced83344\"><!--a--></a>Mr Chen also asked whether\r\nthe involvement of Singapore's companies will be a requirement in\r\nevery project. Let me reiterate that the PFC will aim to have 80%\r\nof its long-term portfolio comprise projects with significant participation\r\nfrom Singapore-based companies. This already assures us of significant\r\nbenefits because the Singapore-based company must have at least\r\nthree global or regional strategic decision-making functions located\r\nin Singapore, which I have explained earlier. The additional condition of\r\nlocal partnership, if we were to put it in, will unduly constrain\r\nthe borrower and make it less attractive for the deal to be financed\r\nout of Singapore. So if we make that as a requirement, you might\r\nnot even get it. Notwithstanding this, our economic agencies will\r\ncontinue to facilitate meaningful partnerships between our local\r\nSMEs and international companies for infrastructure opportunities\r\nin the region.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1740</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-267545ee-7d3b-4782-aec4-3e93d2f2ba0d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-267545ee-7d3b-4782-aec4-3e93d2f2ba0d\"><!--a--></a>Mr Chairman, let me now touch on issues\r\nrelated to an effective and efficient Government, beginning with\r\nthe management of our reserves, which Mr Inderjit Singh raised.\r\nHe had suggested that Government plays a coordinating role between\r\nGIC and Temasek to ensure that there are no overlaps. His key concern\r\nis that even as GIC and Temasek manage their own portfolios on a\r\ndiversified basis, taking them together, there could still be concentration\r\nrisks in the overall Government portfolio. Mr Inderjit Singh's question\r\nis a valid one and I should assure him that the Government does,\r\nin fact, systematically review the risks in its overall portfolio.\r\nWe do this by considering the Government's whole portfolio of assets\r\ninvested by the three entities \u2013 MAS, GIC and Temasek. We monitor\r\nfor concentration risks in the whole portfolio, and whether there is\r\nappropriate diversification in terms of asset classes, sectors and\r\ngeographies. We also assess the impact on the whole portfolio of\r\nvarious adverse global scenarios across medium to long-term timeframes,\r\nto ensure that the risks to the whole portfolio are not excessive.\r\nMAS, GIC and Temasek, in fact, operate at different parts of the\r\ninvestment risks spectrum, even if there is some overlap. They engage\r\nin different investment strategies and take different degrees of\r\nrisks. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-df5e5f3f-b22d-4bb5-ab8f-0450825dda09\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-df5e5f3f-b22d-4bb5-ab8f-0450825dda09\"><!--a--></a>MAS, as a central bank,\r\nis the most conservative of the three. A significant majority of\r\nits diversified portfolio is in low risk and liquid investments.\r\nGIC's mandate is to preserve and enhance the real value of Singapore's\r\nforeign reserves over time. GIC's portfolio is well-diversified\r\nacross asset classes including equities, bonds, real estate, natural\r\nresources and some other asset classes. It is also highly diversified internationally.\r\nTemasek's mandate is to create and deliver sustainable returns for\r\nits shareholders over the long run. This has remained Temasek's\r\nmandate even after its Charter was revised in 2009. Temasek is an\r\nequity-only value investor. It takes concentrated stakes from time\r\nto time but its portfolio remains diversified and it is also invested\r\nacross sectors and geographies. I should add that Temasek's strategy\r\nof actively investing internationally begun much earlier than 2009\r\n\u2013 it made the shift in 2002 and has since achieved more diversification\r\nby reducing its previously heavy concentration in Singapore assets.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9b60b11a-7bc4-48c2-8863-bb8e335f7b27\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9b60b11a-7bc4-48c2-8863-bb8e335f7b27\"><!--a--></a>The Government does not\r\ndecide on how each investment entity should manage its own portfolio.\r\nTheir respective boards and professional management teams are responsible\r\nfor those decisions. The Government's role is therefore two-fold:\r\nfirst, and foremost, we ensure that these investment entities have\r\ncompetent boards to oversee how their respective management teams\r\nexecute their investment mandates. We also ensure that these entities\r\nhave proper mandates and objectives. Second, based on the overall\r\nrisk profile of the Government's whole portfolio, we decide how\r\nGovernment capital should be allocated among the three entities.\r\nFurther, we ensure that GIC, Temasek and MAS are sensitised to Government's\r\nconsiderations with regard to these overall risks. It is therefore\r\nnot an auto-pilot system. We have a governance structure for looking\r\nat our Whole-of-Government assets within the system and for monitoring\r\nthe overall risks and returns. It is a structure that has worked\r\nwell and that we will keep improving. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6f9d70e8-7656-48ec-9ecb-2afe851d91df\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-6f9d70e8-7656-48ec-9ecb-2afe851d91df\"><!--a--></a>Sir, let me now turn to\r\nMr Laurence Lien's question on the public sector promoting productivity\r\nand being efficient in the use of manpower resources. The growth\r\nof the public sector headcount in recent years reflects the greater\r\nmanpower needs on the public sector in essential areas such as education,\r\npublic security and healthcare. The 14% cited by Mr Lien was largely contributed\r\nby major increases in teachers and allied educators \u2212 in fact, the\r\nallied educators scheme is a completely new scheme \u2212 and also of\r\nsecurity personnel.

The MMF constraints\r\nthe overall growth of the public sector manpower to keep it in line\r\nwith Singapore's resident labour force growth in the long run. Since\r\nthe introduction of the MMF in 2004 to 2011 \u2013 if you look at the\r\nwhole period, since MMF was introduced, public sector headcounts,\r\nin fact, increased 8%, compared to the resident labour force growth\r\nof 19% over the same period.

The Immigration and Checkpoint Authority\r\n(ICA) introduced the enhanced Immigration Automated Clearance system\r\nin 2006. This has helped to relief the manpower pressures on ICA\r\ndespite the large increases in cross-border travel in recent years\r\nand also improved security at our checkpoints. We acknowledge Mr\r\nLien's point that manpower issues are a key challenge faced by the\r\nsocial services sector.

So it is not all that frequent \u2212 it was\r\nquite some time ago. We support more being done to enable the social\r\nservices sector to groom a larger pool of social workers and professionals.\r\nIt is very important for the ongoing development of our social sector\r\nand this would involve providing not just better rewards but also\r\nfulfilling careers. MCYS will implement a comprehensive social sector manpower\r\ndevelopment plan and ensure that adequate resources are provided\r\nto support it. MCYS will elaborate on this at their COS.

Nonetheless, we agree with Mr Liang that those who are\r\nbetter off should be encouraged to contribute more and that is why\r\nwe increased the tax benefit from 200% to 250% for donations to approved\r\nrecipients in Budget 2009 and also provided matching grants for\r\ndonations to Institutes of Higher Learning through the $2 billion\r\nSingapore Universities Trust and to the long-term care sector through\r\nthe $1 billion Community Silver Trust. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-36840597-e96f-4125-b0af-93b62caf45d8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-36840597-e96f-4125-b0af-93b62caf45d8\"><!--a--></a>Of course, we also have\r\nnon-tax measures to increase giving. The Charity Council and MCYS\r\nhave been working to enhance public confidence in our charities.\r\nThe NVPC has rolled out initiatives such as the Community Foundation\r\nof Singapore and the Singapore Gives online portal to encourage\r\ngiving as well. To Mr Liang's question on whether there is support\r\nto encourage the setting up of charitable vehicles, let me highlight\r\ntwo specific ways. First, we exempt all our charities from income\r\ntax. Second, in Budget 2007, we introduced the qualifying grant\r\nmaking philanthropic organisation scheme. What this scheme allows\r\nis tax deductions for donations to grant makers, such as family\r\nfoundations, community foundations and business giving programmes.\r\nSince inception, 10 charitable vehicles, such as the Anglo-Chinese\r\nSchools Foundation have registered to benefit from the scheme. We\r\nare very encouraged that charitable giving has, in fact, been growing\r\nsteadily in Singapore. We know that many Singaporeans want to do\r\ntheir part to give to the community. And with them doing so, Singapore\r\ncan become a more caring and inclusive society. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-37120b24-80c7-4c20-a275-348004af8e17\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-37120b24-80c7-4c20-a275-348004af8e17\"><!--a--></a>Let me now address several\r\nspecific questions raised by Ms Indranee Rajah, Dr Chia Shi-Lu and\r\nMr Inderjit Singh. Ms Indranee Rajah asked whether MOF would be\r\nprepared to consider charging a community rate for state land use\r\nfor community purposes and/or use by community users. The Government's\r\npolicy is to charge market rates for the rental of temporarily unused\r\nState land to recognise the true value of the land. I understand\r\nwhere Ms Indranee Rajah is coming from. She will be pleased to know\r\nthat if there are grounds to subsidise the operations of an organisation,\r\nthe relevant Ministry will consider doing so, for example, MCYS\r\ncurrently provides rental subsidies to some VWOs, operating day\r\ncare centres and senior citizen homes.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a947fc9c-f497-44cb-85b9-2c8b63a9bfa0\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a947fc9c-f497-44cb-85b9-2c8b63a9bfa0\"><!--a--></a>This approach of charging\r\nState land use at the market rate and the Ministry providing subsidies\r\nin a directed manner is a more transparent and targeted approach. Dr\r\nChia Shi-Lu asked if MOF could consider increasing the income tax\r\nrelief for handicapped family members. We share his concern for\r\nsuch families. In 2008, we increase\r\nthe Handicapped Child Relief from $3,500 to $5,500. In 2010, we\r\nallowed tax reliefs for the handicapped to be claimed regardless\r\nof the dependent's earned income. However, we are mindful that about\r\n40% of individual income tax payers already do not pay taxes after\r\nreliefs and rebates. So, higher reliefs are less meaningful to them.\r\nThat is why we have introduced other support measures to help persons\r\nwith disabilities, at all stages of life. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1744</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-066460f8-e1f3-4026-a244-f1b6b231c044\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-066460f8-e1f3-4026-a244-f1b6b231c044\"><!--a--></a>In Budget 2012, we have\r\nmade significant enhancements including increasing places in centres\r\nfor children who need intensive early intervention; and also extending\r\nthe Workfare Income Supplement Scheme, as well as the Special Employment\r\nCredit to lower-income Singaporeans with disabilities.

To summarise,\r\nMOF has taken a comprehensive approach towards facilitating businesses, ensuring\r\nan effective and efficient Government and playing our part in nurturing\r\na caring society. First, we will continue to facilitate businesses,\r\nparticularly SMEs. Ensuring that the PIC claims process is straightforward;\r\ndoubling the PIC cash payout option from 30% to 60% of qualifying\r\nexpenditure up to $100,000 and allowing claims to be made quarterly\r\nrather than annually; relaxing the criteria to allow PIC claims\r\non in-house training without WDA/ITE certification. Those are some\r\nof the moves that have been made. We will also introduce more channels\r\nto help businesses learn more about PIC and get help. MOF will continue\r\nto play our role in reinforcing the efficient and effective use\r\nof manpower resources. Let me just close by saying that on the Best Sourcing\r\nInitiative, we will do everything that is within our means to make\r\nit an important tool to uplift our low-wage workers' wages and working\r\nconditions.

We listen to the Auditor-General\r\nregularly. We study his report. We have also called up the Chief Accounting\r\nOfficers (who are the Permanent Secretaries) of MHA and MOF, for\r\ndialogue and discussion. It seems that some of the feedback we got\r\nwas that there are many different Ministries \u2013 some large, some\r\nsmall, there are many different statutory boards \u2013 some large, some\r\nsmall. A particularly disturbing feedback was for that of smaller Ministries\r\nand statutory boards, they do not have, say, a DSTA-equivalent in\r\nthe Ministry of Defence. And, for good reasons, many of the officers\r\nhave to be rotated and sometimes, they are rotated out in the middle\r\nof a procurement project. There is no opportunity for deep, institutional\r\nknowledge and skills-set to set in especially for smaller Ministries\r\nand statutory boards. Would the Ministry consider setting up a central procurement\r\nunit for the Government so that smaller Ministries and statutory\r\nboards can opt in and avail themselves to such expertise?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-8fe8a884-ea12-49b2-946b-56813c8254f8\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-8fe8a884-ea12-49b2-946b-56813c8254f8\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1746</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a0ae3e23-d067-4913-bfe9-0d55845dd526\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a0ae3e23-d067-4913-bfe9-0d55845dd526\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mrs\r\nJosephine Teo</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Chairman, I thank Mr Foo for his\r\nobservations. Indeed, it is a challenge, especially for the smaller\r\nagencies. And it is not just in procurement. It is in a variety\r\nof functions that they have to perform, whether it is HR, administration,\r\nfinance, audit. They do not have a very large pool of people to\r\nbe able to support these functions. In order to standardise and\r\nensure compliance and also keep up high standards, the Government\r\nset up Vital.org to consolidate some of these activities so that\r\nthere can be greater economies of scale. There can be more specialised\r\nexpertise being built up.

Two illustrations\r\n\u2013 very quickly \u2013 my favourite topics: Kim Yam Road \u2013 Seventh Moon\r\n\u2013 always very crowded, always complaints from residents because\r\nof the festival and activities at the temple there. It has been\r\ngoing on for many years, and every time the residents have to call,\r\nit takes time for the LTA officer to come down. By that time, the\r\noffenders have moved off. I therefore have to suggest to LTA that\r\nit might be a good idea to actually be there at the peak hours before\r\nit starts and take care of the problem, and that did a great deal\r\nto resolve the issue. You do not need technology to know that you\r\nshould come down. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2230a677-df5c-4cb7-bc79-7663b3459797\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-2230a677-df5c-4cb7-bc79-7663b3459797\"><!--a--></a>The second point \u2013 Robertson\r\nQuay. Because, after a certain time, you want the noise to die down,\r\nso I suggested, perhaps, having much brighter lights after a certain\r\ntime to say that the party is over. The response from LTA was: we\r\ncannot raise ambient lighting because it would destroy the ambience\r\nof the place. My response was that I am not asking for an increase\r\nin ambient lighting but for floodlighting after a particular time. LTA\r\nsaid they would look into it. They did. What they did was they increased\r\nthe ambient lighting. I waited, of course, because that is not going\r\nto work. So, after several months, they said that increasing the\r\nambient lighting would not work. I said, yes, I know, could they\r\nplease consider floodlights? The answer that has come back is, well,\r\nwe now have to consider the loading on the bridge to see whether\r\nthe floodlights can be put on the bridge. I have suggested that,\r\nyou know, we do not have to put floodlights on the bridge, you can\r\nput it on the land next to bridge, on <em class=\"ph i\">terra firma</em>, and that\r\nwould take care of the issue.

It seems that the criteria allow\r\nSingapore incorporated foreign companies with zero Singapore ownership\r\nto take part. The first question is that can the evaluation criteria\r\nbe bias in such a way that it will favour companies with local ownership\r\nso that we can help grow locally-owned companies? The second question\r\nis that by having only 80% of the projects required to be Singapore-based\r\ncompanies involved and not 100%, is it because we are not confident\r\nthat there will be enough projects that will involve at least some\r\nof our local companies?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-a2edb794-471f-4b9e-a678-83cd95683b66\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-a2edb794-471f-4b9e-a678-83cd95683b66\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d59eef78-febb-4d17-b3b5-cadac6e57f51\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d59eef78-febb-4d17-b3b5-cadac6e57f51\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mrs Josephine Teo</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Chairman,\r\nI will try to be brief. On his second question first: why 80% and\r\nnot 100%? Actually, with the requirement to have 80% of the portfolio comprised\r\nprojects with significant participation from Singapore-based companies,\r\nthe mandate of the PFC is very clear. However, as with any investment\r\nportfolio, the PFC needs\r\nto diversify its project portfolio and also the risks. Other countries\r\nand their EXIMs are far larger than Singapore's and able to achieve\r\nsufficient risks diversity within their own country's industries\r\nand companies. So, it is a practical concern there. With us, there\r\nis a reason why we have decided to allow the PFC some flexibility\r\nto provide financing for projects not involving Singapore-based\r\ncompanies. It is to our benefit that the PFC is able to diversify\r\nand manage it risks to enhance the commercial viability. So, that\r\nis to the second question.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1748</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c54d69c3-e023-468d-b04d-8b3549d2554c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-c54d69c3-e023-468d-b04d-8b3549d2554c\"><!--a--></a>To the first question:\r\nI have every confidence that Singapore companies are up to it and,\r\nin fact, all of our efforts are directed towards helping them to\r\nbuild the capabilities and not assuming that they are not up to\r\nit.

Given that productivity growth is a core focus for the\r\nBudget, for us to know that we are on the right track, we need accurate measures\r\nof our productivity and growth. However, getting the right method\r\nto measure productivity is not easy in Singapore. Most take a very\r\nrudimentary approach which is you divide your total output by total\r\nlabour force. But output in Singapore is highly cyclical and susceptible\r\nto volatilities in business cycles. As a result, productivity growth in\r\nSingapore becomes very cyclical. If you look at the 2009 to 2011\r\nnumbers, they were very volatile and that was due to the cyclical\r\nimpact of business cycles. These co-mingle our real productivity\r\ngains. So, the question is: would MTI agree that a better measure to\r\nreflect in improvement in productivity would be the average or even\r\nthe median real income growth for Singaporeans? After all, productivity\r\ngrowth is really a means to an end and if the end gain is a real\r\ngrowth of 30% accumulative real income for Singaporeans in the next\r\n10 years, then let us not forget that productivity growth is just one\r\nway of getting to our end goal.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a1f26505-88cd-430d-b4f7-036dada8f9b5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a1f26505-88cd-430d-b4f7-036dada8f9b5\"><!--a--></a>And according to an MTI\r\nstudy, productivity gains do drive real wage growth. For such gains\r\nto translate fully into higher income, then one needs to limit inflation\r\nto help the economy restructure. My question is: what are the moves\r\nto limit inflation, particularly domestic inflation and are there\r\nany qualitative aspects that can help this productivity.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-caeb42de-3e55-4483-9e6e-c38ae0472939\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-caeb42de-3e55-4483-9e6e-c38ae0472939\"><!--a--></a>Sir, moves to limit inflation.\r\nIn my speech yesterday, I stressed that whilst a strong Sing dollar\r\npolicy does help mitigate imported inflation, one of the key issues\r\nis domestic inflation. Does MTI have a target to reduce this? And\r\nwould the Government consider other kinds of monetary policy focuses\r\nlike interest rates or supply side measures to temper these inflationary\r\npressures that is wiping out real wage growth?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1752</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d3c70a47-a553-4b31-ab07-f8b83d0f8406\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d3c70a47-a553-4b31-ab07-f8b83d0f8406\"><!--a--></a>Secondly, more qualitative ways of improving\r\nproductivity. So far, the Government's focus is to improve and measure\r\nproductivity and the focus has been very much on technology, innovation\r\nand skills training. Perhaps, we can also focus on more qualitative\r\naspects. And this could be very simple things like better team work,\r\nbetter collaboration, better sharing of resources both in the public\r\nand the private sectors because this means we save time, we save\r\nmoney and if we save time and we save money, then the same amount\r\nof work can be done by fewer workers and this also raises productivity.\r\nBut how does one measure this?

This could make\r\nSingapore less attractive when compared to our regional peers. I\r\nwould like to understand the impact of the strong Singapore dollar\r\non our competitiveness, both in terms of export competitiveness\r\nas well as a location for business operations? How have our cost\r\nstructures evolved over time? What could the Government do to help\r\nmoderate rising costs?

Unfortunately, many of our economic\r\npolicies, along with it the incentives and support schemes, are based\r\non this same principle and were designed with big companies in mind.\r\nThe successes of these schemes are also measured by KPIs which favour\r\nhelping bigger companies and do not motivate our civil servants\r\nto help smaller companies. So, we see many small companies not benefiting\r\nfrom them, including the productivity incentive schemes, thus the\r\nGovernment has had to retune the scheme yet again this year. I have said\r\na few times in this House that the approach taken by the Government\r\nshould be turned the other way round, upside down. Start with your\r\neconomic re-modelling by looking at SMEs first and it will follow\r\nthat bigger companies will also benefit and not the other way round.\r\nDesign incentives schemes with SMEs in mind and the big companies\r\nwill also have no problems benefiting from these.

One way to do this is to give SPRING \"an additional\r\ncharter\" of helping local companies and entrepreneurs link to overseas\r\nmarkets. There is a scope for IE and SPRING to merge \u2013 in fact,\r\nI mentioned this many times in this House before \u2212 to create a bigger\r\nand stronger agency supporting start-up and the growth of companies\r\nhere in Singapore.

Each sector has its unique set of challenges.\r\nTherefore, the extent of restructuring will vary with each sector.\r\nOur manufacturing sectors, for example, are largely export-driven\r\nand have restructured continuously over the years, moving up the\r\nvalue chain and building new competencies to remain competitive.\r\nThey must continue to do so. Take the example of the marine and offshore cluster.\r\nMrs Lina Chiam mentioned that we have been allowing our marine and offshore\r\ncentre a huge quota of foreign workers.

And today, Singapore is a global\r\nleader in this sector \u2013 our home-grown champions Keppel Offshore\r\nand Marine as well as Sembcorp Marine have 70% of the global market share\r\nin offshore drilling rigs and production vessels. However, offshore\r\nactivities are increasingly operating in deeper waters and harsher\r\noperating environments. This means we need more advanced solutions\r\nto satisfy the stringent operating requirements. We will therefore\r\nallocate $150 million to help companies in this cluster conduct\r\nR&amp;D so as to develop capabilities in deep water offshore engineering\r\nand seize the opportunities in this new segment.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1758</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-43c1fecb-8702-4f42-b67b-381c247c4cd8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-43c1fecb-8702-4f42-b67b-381c247c4cd8\"><!--a--></a>As Ms Jessica Tan mentioned,\r\nour bigger challenge lies in the services sectors. We do have externally-oriented\r\nservices activities that are globally competitive. For example,\r\nthe financial services and business services sectors are globally\r\ncompetitive. The trading of commodities is also competitive. Due\r\nto our excellent connectivity and our trade links, Singapore has\r\nbecome Asia's oil trading hub and is home to many of the world's\r\nlargest players in agri-commodities as well as in metals and minerals\r\ntrading. Some of our local trading companies have also successfully\r\nupgraded from being merely local wholesalers to competing on the\r\nglobal arena. We need more models like these companies. We can do\r\nmore to enhance our status as an international trading hub by anchoring\r\nnew, high value-added trading clusters. For example, with the rise\r\nof Asia, there is now strong demand for investment-grade gold.

The industrial property market comprises\r\nfour main sectors \u2013 land, specialised facilities, standard factories,\r\nand generic multi-storey multiple-user factory space. In the first\r\nsegment, JTC allocates industrial land to companies to build their\r\nspecial purpose facilities, provided these companies meet our criteria\r\nin terms of value-add, linkages to other sectors of our economy\r\nas well as jobs creation. In the second segment, JTC provides innovative\r\nindustrial facilities such as the Jurong Rock Caverns, the Very\r\nLarge Floating Structures (VLFS), Offshore Marine Centre, Seletar\r\nAerospace Park, Clean Tech Park, Med Tech Hub, etc. This is to meet\r\nthe specialised needs of these key clusters. The third segment is\r\nstandard factories where the investors need a quick start-up and\r\ncan fit their operations in JTC's standard factories. In all these\r\nthree segments, JTC has a very important role to play and will continue\r\nto do so. For such premises, JTC will price the industrial land\r\njudiciously. We cannot price industrial land cheaply in Singapore\r\nbecause land is at a premium. But at the same time, we cannot price\r\nourselves out of the competition. We do benchmark our industrial\r\nland price against regional alternatives. By and large, I think\r\nJTC's industrial land prices are set at a fair and competitive level\r\nfor these three segments. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-032f1fe0-b0b3-466a-a947-7074d7c0495c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-032f1fe0-b0b3-466a-a947-7074d7c0495c\"><!--a--></a>For the fourth segment,\r\nthe generic multi-storey multiple-user factory space, or what is\r\ncommonly known as flatted factories, the Government decided in 2005\r\nthat JTC should exit this segment.

JTC's tenants were enjoying lower\r\nrentals than the others. This was inequitable. JTC should be concentrating on the\r\nfirst three segments which are more challenging rather than undercutting\r\nthe flatted factory private sector players with JTC's lower rentals.\r\nThat is why JTC divested their flatted factories in order to ensure\r\na level playing field in this segment.

Last year, SPRING assisted some\r\n3,900 companies, while IE Singapore supported some 5,500 SMEs, largely\r\non a one-to-one basis.

How do we help them achieve the first\r\norder of business? It is to build that eco-system, the network of\r\ncontacts, opening paths, if possible, for them, but they have to\r\nbite it, carry the baton and go for it.

We are today operating at\r\nnear full employment levels, which leave limited choice for the\r\nemployer to select from local talent. The policies have chosen to\r\ngeneralise all businesses alike without considering the labour dependency needs\r\nof different businesses. Services like hospitality, F&amp;B, retail,\r\netc, are dependent on labour at the front end with barely any scope\r\nof automation at point of service. Moreover, every business needs\r\na certain aptitude and the attitude amongst its staff to make it\r\nsuccessful. Today, jobs that require standing for long hours beyond\r\nnormal working office hours, working on weekends and public holidays,\r\nare shunned by our local workers. It is just not retail, but services\r\nlike healthcare as well, that there are simply not enough locals\r\nto choose from, given the demand being the nature of the work and the\r\nskills. I request a detailed understanding and review so that we\r\nhave a more realistic approach on quotas and levies taken, keeping\r\nin view every type of business, talent requirements, scope for automation\r\nand productivity increases, besides the statistics of local talent\r\navailable for each profession rather than painting all issues with\r\none brush. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cbb822db-f59c-4fa0-b7eb-484790420252\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-cbb822db-f59c-4fa0-b7eb-484790420252\"><!--a--></a>Another note: it is heartening\r\nto see tourism business growing in Singapore with more arrivals\r\nthan before.

Among\r\nthe things that make the stay comfortable and enjoyable for tourists\r\nare: entertainment, hospitality, retail, and F&amp;B businesses.\r\nThese industries form an integral part in enhancing the tourist\r\nexperience while they are in Singapore. Today, these allied businesses,\r\nwhich can play a strong role to support tourism initiatives, have\r\nserious issues affecting their business operations. These include\r\na very rapid rise in business costs and acute shortage of right\r\ntalent locally. With significant assistance, these allied sectors\r\nwill struggle and may be unable to live up to the raised demands\r\nof additional tourists, especially higher spending tourists who\r\nexpect more personalised services. I request the Government to include\r\nthese allied sectors for assistance in their endeavours to boost\r\ntourism. By leaving out these sectors, the quality of experience\r\nfor tourists would suffer and may, ultimately, risk our status as\r\none of the top tourist destinations.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-d4ad1520-b71c-47fc-bb71-1151ceb024c7\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-d4ad1520-b71c-47fc-bb71-1151ceb024c7\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading\" id=\"id-2fbbb6b3-72c6-487f-b738-222b4a767c25\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-2fbbb6b3-72c6-487f-b738-222b4a767c25\"><!--a--></a>Energy</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-04690a8c-84ba-44fe-ad71-1928aee2f42b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-04690a8c-84ba-44fe-ad71-1928aee2f42b\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nMr Chairman, the rising cost of energy is becoming an increasing\r\nconcern for households especially in the lower and middle-income\r\nfamilies who have seen their utility bills increased with the increase\r\nin tariffs.

A*STAR and polytechnic research centres have numerous\r\nongoing projects with SMEs, and have worked on over 700 projects\r\nso far in FY2011. For example, A*STAR helped Dynaglass Pte Ltd to\r\ndevelop petrochemical storage tanks, a fibreglass floating roof\r\nthat is corrosion-proof and maintenance free.

These resources\r\nwill help take more ideas from basic research to commercialisation.\r\nFirst, we will enhance our enterprise ecosystem in nascent sectors.\r\nFor example, SPRING has embarked on a new Biomedical Sciences Accelerator\r\nProgramme to invest in start-ups and facilitate access to knowledge\r\ncapital, markets and networks. We are also expanding A*STAR's GET-Up\r\nScheme, the Growing Enterprises with Technology Upgrade Scheme,\r\nto help Biomedical Sciences SMEs develop new products and services.\r\nSecond, we will devote more efforts to bridge the gap to market.\r\nThe new IP Intermediary, or Intellectual Property Intermediary Singapore,\r\nwill proactively reach out to SMEs to assess and source for IP to\r\nmeet their technology and business needs. Lastly, we will develop platform\r\ntechnologies for key policy outcomes, such as productivity.

These are some examples of how we\r\nhave gone about developing our R&amp;D ecosystem and harnessing\r\nit to facilitate economic growth to our companies.

Mr Yee\r\nJenn Jong asked how we spent the $2 billion in the Tourism Development\r\nFund (TDF). The fund was launched in 2005 with a five-year funding\r\ncommitment period. And the reason you have a five-year commitment\r\nperiod is because many of these projects have a gestation period.\r\nYou invest early in order to let the infrastructure kick in, then contribute\r\nto your tourism spend. The long-term target is $30 billion of tourism\r\nreceipts and visitor arrivals of 17 million by 2015. The fund has\r\nsupported many major projects \u2212 Formula One, Gardens by the Bay\r\nas well as the International Cruise Terminal and River Safari, the\r\nlatter two are scheduled to open later this year. It has also brought\r\nin numerous events and helped our tourism companies build capabilities.\r\nThese, together with private sector investments such as the Integrated\r\nResorts, have transformed our tourism sector and kept us on track\r\nto achieving our long-term targets. In 2011, Singapore had 13.2\r\nmillion international visitors and tourism receipts of $22.2 billion. This\r\nis a 13% increase in visitor arrivals and 17% increase in the tourism\r\nreceipts. To respond to Mr Yee, tourism receipts include spend on\r\naccommodation, spend on shopping, spend on entertainment, so it\r\nis a collection and not segmented into particular parts alone. STB's\r\nstrategies cannot segment the spending activity of tourists in Singapore\r\nto the degree that he has asked. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1a670919-97eb-4a29-80c3-c49f12007880\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-1a670919-97eb-4a29-80c3-c49f12007880\"><!--a--></a>This growth in tourism\r\nhas also created more and diverse job opportunities for Singaporeans.\r\nLet me give Members a couple of examples. Catherine Ho is a former Warrant\r\nOfficer with 26 years of service in the SAF. Now, she is a Theme\r\nPark Manager in charge of park operations in Universal Studios Singapore,\r\nassuming there are some relevant skills there. She is now helping\r\nto set up operations at the upcoming Marine Life Park. Another example\r\nis Gwern Khoo, a chef in the Celebrity Chef Restaurant Waku Ghin\r\nin Marina Bay Sands, who has been identified by Chef Tetsuya as\r\na promising local talent with plans to send him to Sydney for further\r\ntraining. He has come a long way from his days at SHATEC and from helping\r\nout at his father's duck rice stall.

In response to Mr Liang's question, I would say that\r\non the whole, the benefits of F1, both tangible and intangible, have\r\noutweighed the costs. Yes, there are certain disruptions like the\r\nroad closures, and this is something between the Government agencies\r\nand the race promoter. There has been significant effort to reduce\r\nthat by more than half to about six days now, compared to where\r\nwe were at the start, but we need to continue to work on this. Overall,\r\nthe benefits have been significant and they outweigh the costs and\r\nany decision on an extension will have to be premised on the value\r\nthat we can continue to derive from such an event.

I\r\nlike to seek clarity on how the Government prices the land sales.\r\nLast year, there was this Paya Lebar industrial site that was not\r\nawarded because it went below the price. So there is some perception\r\nthat during economic boom, developers would bid very high prices\r\nand we award to the highest bidder, but when the market is down\r\nthen we will not award. So, will this be artificially keeping prices\r\nup so that it is quite impossible to have rent rates going down?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-29b41477-64f8-4124-8cf8-66cc03890ecb\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-29b41477-64f8-4124-8cf8-66cc03890ecb\"><!--a--></a> I am also concerned that\r\nthere is the effect that REITs being a dominant force in the market\r\nnow, they are actually price maker in the rental market.

I do not think we split them up, and whether expenditure\r\non shopping should be under another body and so on. We look at the\r\ntotal amount tourists spend.

So, essentially, these\r\nare projects that were conceived in order to enhance the tourism\r\nenvironment as part of a larger ecosystem in Singapore. And it is\r\ndifficult really to start splitting out what is the tourists' spending because\r\nof the IRs, what is the tourists' spending because of other new\r\nentertainment and other new products we have in Singapore. So, we\r\nlook at it collectively as part of the overall wallet and the share\r\nof the wallet that we are able to draw into Singapore.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1f259103-7ef2-445c-945c-ed2c6c05948a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-1f259103-7ef2-445c-945c-ed2c6c05948a\"><!--a--></a>The second question, which\r\nis his first, on the Tourism Development Fund, yes, it means that\r\nthere was $2 billion in the first instance as a first tranche, and\r\nthere is now $905 in the second tranche. So, the question is: why\r\nare we having a second tranche? Let me explain again because I think\r\nit may not have been clear for the Member. We put in the first tranche\r\nin 2005 and we said that there was a commitment period of five years, because\r\nthese investments would need to be incurred early in the period\r\nin order to generate the returns over the longer term, and that\r\nis what we are seeing now. Many of the investments we made in the\r\nfirst five years are now beginning to yield results for us, and\r\nsome are still coming on-stream, such as the International Cruise\r\nTerminal and the River Safari.

And that is why\r\nwe have significant investments already being made through the Ministry\r\nof the Environment and Water Resources' efforts. If we look at the\r\nticks that are on electrical appliances and also to educate household\r\nmembers by looking at their bills and seeing which are the parts\r\nwhich they can perhaps trim, maybe because there is an air-conditioner\r\nin the home that they can use more efficiently and so on. This is\r\nsomething we are totally committed to. An important part of that\r\neffort \u2212 and I want to stress this because sometimes this comes\r\nup and, in fact, some Members of Mr Low's Party have raised this\r\n\u2212 is indeed the pricing of electricity. Because if we subsidise\r\nelectricity, then we are dulling the instincts of the average consumer\r\nin appreciating what is the true cost of this very scarce and precious\r\nresource.

I do agree\r\nwith Finance Minister Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam. We do need them\r\nbut they must be for certain specific jobs when they come to work\r\nin Singapore, and they are really giving us good quality things\r\nto do in Singapore. I am sorry I do not know how to put it into\r\nwords. They do give quality work to Singapore. I want to ask why\r\nthere are so many foreign workers working in the marine, engineering\r\nand chemical sectors. That is the reason why I highlighted the point about\r\nforeign workers.

As I mentioned in my reply, the marine sector as well as the processing\r\nsector are very important sectors of the economy. With the foreign\r\nworkers participating in the marine sector, in fact, we are able\r\nto capture 70% market share of the oil rig and production vessel\r\nsector. Without the foreign workers, we cannot be in that very strong\r\ncommanding position. And it is complementary. At the workers' level,\r\nthe estimate is maybe 80% foreign workers and 20% Singaporeans.\r\nBut for the engineering and the naval architecture design sector,\r\nit is 80% Singaporeans and maybe 20% foreigners. So, this is how\r\nthe Singaporean core is complemented by the foreign workers to make\r\nour industry competitive. If we follow what she has suggested and\r\ncut it down to one third, then I think we are putting a lot of strain\r\non the industry, and the industry will not be able to compete.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-3ce6d4d3-dace-4b67-97f2-ce3a2712863e\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-3ce6d4d3-dace-4b67-97f2-ce3a2712863e\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9bf61301-98b0-47f9-9092-35dafc50b89f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9bf61301-98b0-47f9-9092-35dafc50b89f\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">The Chairman</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Teo Ser\r\nLuck, would you like to add to that?

With the advent of the IRs alone, we have added something\r\nin the order of magnitude of about 6,000-8,000 rooms, if I remember\r\ncorrectly, in the last few years, and there are some more to come.

And, two, given the uncertain\r\neconomic outlook over the next few years, are there any measures\r\nin the pipeline to encourage the private sector to continue spending\r\non R&amp;D? </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-2f51c335-f2b8-4011-97c7-7577dffd1d34\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-2f51c335-f2b8-4011-97c7-7577dffd1d34\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a1bfc0c3-4040-4029-93e9-4bd70dd20803\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a1bfc0c3-4040-4029-93e9-4bd70dd20803\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr S Iswaran</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir, on the\r\nratio between public and private spending, typically, what we have\r\nseen is about one is to two, or thereabouts. But I do not think\r\nwe want to be terribly formulaic about it because it really depends\r\non the contexts of the type of industry and what they are doing.\r\nBut that seems to be the general pattern. We seek, of course, to\r\nensure that every dollar of Government investment in R&amp;D gets\r\nits bang for the buck from private sector investment of an equal\r\nlevel at least, but typically we look at higher multiples than that.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1783</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5273f831-20f6-464a-85ca-a5241f4e85d9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-5273f831-20f6-464a-85ca-a5241f4e85d9\"><!--a--></a>On the broader question of whether economic\r\nuncertainty will affect R&amp;D spending \u2212 the Government component\r\nclearly is a well-defined one, and that creates certainty in the\r\nmarket, not just for our research institutes and researchers, but\r\nalso, in general, as a signal to the market that this is the commitment\r\nthe Government has made over a five-year period.

When we\r\nset the $30 billion tourism receipt target revenue in 2005, did\r\nwe envisage gaming revenue to be part of it, because gaming revenue\r\nis now a significant part of the tourism receipts by the statistics\r\nthat we capture?

When the target is set, we are talking\r\nabout tourism spending as a whole. In other words, when a tourist\r\ncomes to Singapore, what is he spending his dollar on? We do not\r\npreclude future innovations or new developments in the market which\r\nmight encourage the tourists to spend more. Let me use an alternative example.\r\nWe are now going to have an International Cruise terminal, which\r\npresumably will boost our cruise industry in Singapore and bring\r\nmore tourists to Singapore who will buy cruises. Should that be\r\nexcluded from tourism spending forecasting or calculations?

There is nothing wrong\r\nwith individualism <em class=\"ph i\">per se</em> and, indeed, we do want people\r\nto be themselves, to realise their individual potential and to appreciate\r\nthe special and unique talents of each person. At the same time,\r\nhowever, what makes Singapore different, and which is our special\r\nhallmark, is that being Singaporean is also to be a nation and to\r\nthink of ourselves as a community. And the sense of community is important\r\nbecause it helps us to think beyond ourselves and for the wider\r\nsociety at large. So, we have these tensions: an increasing focus\r\non individualism but, at the same time, how do we strengthen our\r\nsocietal and communal bonds. And here, I think that the arts and\r\nheritage have a big part to play as these are the ties that bind. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-639a0922-d2dd-4857-9a70-52f38bed32f9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-639a0922-d2dd-4857-9a70-52f38bed32f9\"><!--a--></a>The thing about arts and\r\nheritage is that we see in them things that we can identify with.\r\nThey move us emotionally \u2212 we laugh, we cry, we empathise with them\r\nor they trigger memories and a sense of a shared identity. Sir,\r\nI would like to ask the Minister what plans MICA has to develop\r\nthe arts and heritage in the community. I think it is particularly\r\nimportant in terms of giving local talent a platform to develop\r\nartistic and creative abilities. We do not always have to focus\r\non the traditional arts, and this is especially in the area of funding,\r\nbecause I think that Singaporeans are actually very creative. To\r\nsee an example of that, you just need to go on the Internet \u2212 there\r\nare extremes, there are some things which are not particularly polite,\r\nbut there are some things which are genuinely creative and funny,\r\nand where a lot of thought and creativity has gone into it. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-40430c16-4e00-426f-b666-a2ba7fecde77\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-40430c16-4e00-426f-b666-a2ba7fecde77\"><!--a--></a>A day or two ago, Ms Janice\r\nKoh, the NMP, spoke about my meeting with Daniel Sassoon and what\r\nhad come of that. Let me just explain to the Chamber a little bit\r\nmore in detail what happened. Daniel Sassoon plays with an independent\r\nband. It is called In Each Hand a Cutlass. I met with him and he\r\nwas decrying the lack of opportunity in Singapore for local independent\r\nmusic. And I think one of the difficulties is that whenever something\r\nis being organised, the organisers traditionally, if it has a commercial\r\nelement or if there is a funding element, they want to be sure that\r\nthey can recoup the investment that they put in. So, there will\r\nbe a tendency to go with more established bands or bands with greater\r\nbrand-name recognition. And, of course, this means that the local\r\nindependent bands do not get the chance to display their talent.\r\nSo, I thought about that and I said, \"Well, you know one area which\r\nhas not been explored is why do you not showcase it in the community,\r\nwork with me \u2013 my constituency \u2013 and we will give you a platform.\"\r\nBecause, obviously, we have the People's Association, we have got\r\naccess to the residents, so we will try it out. And what we did\r\nwas we organised an evening in Tiong Bahru park. They came up with\r\nthe name, again, very creative \u2013 the Malay phrase \"<em class=\"ph i\">lepak</em>\",\r\nwhich is to basically relax, so you <em class=\"ph i\">lepak</em> in the park, right?\r\nAnd it was a success because it had good attendance. There is only\r\none portion where one band was not as good as the others so that\r\nthe NPC got 11 complaints about noise during that particular band. But, apart\r\nfrom that, it went well, so well, in fact, that we are thinking\r\nof doing another one this year called \"<em class=\"ph i\">lepak lagi</em>\". And this\r\none we hope to do either at Botanics at Bay or some other area a\r\nlittle further away from the HDB flats so that we will not get as\r\nmany complaints.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1786</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f1f19099-ab10-4802-ac41-727bbf79bad2\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-f1f19099-ab10-4802-ac41-727bbf79bad2\"><!--a--></a>But the point about this\r\nis to give the local arts community a platform. Just think about\r\nit. Most of us would have heard of Lady Gaga, Linkin Park, Black\r\nEyed Peas, Coldplay. All right, some Members in the Chamber may\r\nnot have heard of these either, but trust me, they are well-known\r\ninternational bands. On the other hand, how many have heard of Cheating\r\nSons, Great Spy Experiment, Weave a Thousand and the Obedient Wives\r\nClub \u2013 not the one in Malaysia \u2013 but the musical version? These\r\nare all local independent bands who are trying to find their feet,\r\nif you like, on the local music scene, and I have heard some of\r\nthem, they are extremely good and they deserve recognition.

I asked them to redraw it because I felt that given its\r\nlocation, given the fact that it is an important part of our tourist\r\nindustry, Newton hawker centre should have a definable identity\r\nof its own. And since the area was surrounded by black and white\r\nbungalows, I asked them to incorporate into the design for Newton\r\nhawker centre the elements of black and white bungalows. So, if\r\nyou go there, you will actually see that the beams are black, the\r\nrest of it is white and in the columns there are plaster mouldings\r\nwhich reflect the kind of design that you would see in the colonial\r\nbungalows. NParks was kind enough to source, at my request, pepper\r\nplants because Newton and Cairnhill used to have pepper plantations.\r\nIt also used to have gambier plantations but NParks did not have\r\ngambier trees in stock. They told me I had to go to the Malaysian\r\njungles to find those.

However, in recent\r\nyears, we have seen an increased influx of new immigrants, many\r\nwho have taken citizenship. At the same time, while income levels\r\nhave grown across the board, there is inevitably a growing income\r\ndisparity between the rich and the poor.

While difference in opinions contributes to a more vibrant\r\nsociety, we seem to have lost our sense of a common identity, especially\r\nwhen we see Singaporeans expressing unhappiness over many hot-button\r\nissues. The recent uproar over religious insensitivities by a Christian\r\nstudent group is also a case in point. In view of these changes,\r\nwhat can the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts do\r\nto help reinforce our society's sense of national identity and cohesion,\r\nto value and share what we have in common than to accentuate the\r\ndifferences that divide?

There are separate NAC schemes for this. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1793</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1cda1ecb-2125-4e19-bd69-de52673fd0ac\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-1cda1ecb-2125-4e19-bd69-de52673fd0ac\"><!--a--></a>Sir, I would like to make\r\na point on this role of the Arts Creation Fund. I hope we take great\r\ncare to ensure that the Arts Creation Fund's funding process does\r\nnot unduly influence an artist's creative work in the early developmental\r\nstage, even if we would hold the artists accountable for the public\r\nfunding they receive. Currently, applicants for developmental funding\r\nare required to submit their plans for future distribution of the completed\r\nwork. One of the stated aims of the Arts Creation Fund for literary\r\narts is the creation of work that has \"broad readership appeal\".\r\nDrafts of manuscripts are required to be submitted for assessment\r\non, among other things, the market potential of the work. Currently,\r\nthe fund strongly encourages attaching mentors, consultants and editors\r\ninto the early stages of the creative process. For example, it is\r\nstrongly recommended that recipients appoint an editor, either identified\r\nby the National Arts Council or with a choice of editor subject\r\nto the Council's approval, who will play, among other things, a\r\ndevelopmental role. All these can represent additional time and\r\ncost and, more importantly, the commercial considerations, editors\r\nand the funding process could end up directing the work too much.\r\nAs the Committee notes, a balance needs to be struck between accountability\r\nto the public and giving the artists the time and space they need.\r\nSir, time and space are even more important during the developmental stages\r\nof an artist's creative work, and angel funding should reflect this.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-c4465287-1d47-4839-b150-7ef9142b499e\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-c4465287-1d47-4839-b150-7ef9142b499e\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading\" id=\"id-24f01d0c-d71a-43d1-a7ce-f17e9af1946c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-24f01d0c-d71a-43d1-a7ce-f17e9af1946c\"><!--a--></a>Protecting Freedom of\r\nExpression</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-bacea5d2-b70e-4173-85a3-ae5fe721581f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-bacea5d2-b70e-4173-85a3-ae5fe721581f\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Ms Janice Koh</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir, \"if\r\nart is to nourish the roots of our culture, society must set the artist\r\nfree to follow his vision wherever it takes him\".

Many\r\npeople think that arts is \"something we can do without\". The ACSR\r\ncommittee hopes to turn this kind of perception around as arts is\r\nsomething we cannot do without and is omnipresent. I agree with\r\nthe Committee's suggestion to widen the coverage of arts as it should\r\nnot only be confined\r\nto high-brow arts but also include common culture, such as handicrafts,\r\nbusking, popular entertainment and local culture, such as <em class=\"ph i\">getai</em>.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1795</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-029959d5-7fae-43c9-b1ee-581d616b68e7\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-029959d5-7fae-43c9-b1ee-581d616b68e7\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <em class=\"ph i\">Getai</em> is a uniquely\r\nSingapore activity which has decades of history.

The\r\nlocal contemporary sector has been suffering from a lack of opportunities\r\nto showcase upcoming artists as well as experienced, export-ready\r\ntalent. There is also an insufficient pool of professional expertise\r\non the ground, from sound engineers to tour managers, to groom new\r\nmusic talent and support the career development of more experienced ones.\r\nBut the biggest obstacle to developing an audience for home-grown music\r\nis not having sufficient airtime on radio. How do you nurture an\r\ninterest in local music or build a thriving ecosystem for the music\r\nscene, if it is not even readily available on mainstream, popular\r\nradio stations or heard during peak airtime hours?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1797</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2e1ed0ed-4c5f-4f01-b974-d378bba45dec\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-2e1ed0ed-4c5f-4f01-b974-d378bba45dec\"><!--a--></a>Of course, some local\r\nprogrammers play local music on their stations but a few hours,\r\nonce or twice a week, is not enough exposure.

The quota requirements average between 25% and\r\n30%, with some countries like France going up to 40%. Such quotas\r\nhelp to support the development of a unique local music culture and\r\nthe forging of a common cultural identity. But, more importantly,\r\nquotas ensure that the public has regular access to local music.\r\nAnd once a demand for the music is created, the benefits and positive\r\nspillovers are real and tangible. Increased airtime play contributes\r\nto improved record sales. This leads to more bookings for the bands, increased\r\nmusic production output, a jump in the quality of music, greater\r\ncoverage in the media, and eventually a demand from international\r\naudiences.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2c179557-09a7-40f4-8680-61a2918ff7d5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-2c179557-09a7-40f4-8680-61a2918ff7d5\"><!--a--></a>There is a chance that\r\nthere may not even be enough high quality content to broadcast in\r\nthe beginning.

For pre-schoolers\r\nup to six years old, the National Early Literacy Programme for Pre-schoolers\r\nwill provide educators and parents with best practices in developing\r\nearly childhood literacy. For older children up to 19 years of age, NLB\r\nwill expand its Whole School Reading Programme, to encourage reading\r\noutside of the school curriculum. 14 schools are involved in the\r\npilot phase, and this will be expanded to many more schools.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1802</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-09b1eeba-2685-4550-8fa6-e33b45a5574a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-09b1eeba-2685-4550-8fa6-e33b45a5574a\"><!--a--></a>Learning is as crucial to the elderly\r\nas it is to the young.

The children,\r\nfor example, at Concord Primary School know the impact that kidsREAD\r\nmakes. In 2006, Emperor Akihito of Japan visited the National Library,\r\nand the kidsREAD children were chosen to put up a skit. This was,\r\nindeed, a rare opportunity for these kids. The performance, I heard,\r\nwent well, but the real impact came after. The children grew more\r\nconfident, and, more importantly, improved in their studies.

I agree with Mr Baey Yam Keng and Mr Zainal\r\nSapari on the importance of traditional arts.

Traditional\r\nChinese music, for example, has shifted from the formal court music\r\nplayed in the Tang dynasty, to the less formal Jiang Nan Silk and\r\nBamboo genre of the masses. More recently, traditional Chinese music\r\nhas incorporated the use of western instruments to improve harmonisation\r\nand the richness of the music. Closer to home, the Singapore Chinese Orchestra\r\nhas developed its own unique style of music \u2013 the Nanyang style,\r\na Chinese repertoire with Southeast Asian influences. The evolution\r\nof traditional art forms is therefore not unusual. As long as they\r\nstay true to their artistic core, the evolution of traditional arts\r\ncould be embraced as a positive contribution to their richness. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1dc01024-adf5-4e8b-95da-a2af068db798\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-1dc01024-adf5-4e8b-95da-a2af068db798\"><!--a--></a>Singapore contributes\r\nto the richness of our traditional arts. As the confluence of many\r\ncultures and a modern, open society welcoming of ideas and talent,\r\nSingapore provides a conducive environment for cultures to influence\r\none another. The Siong Leng Musical Association is one such group.\r\nSiong Leng promotes Nanyin music, one of the oldest forms of Chinese\r\nmusic. The group has experimented with Indian instruments like the\r\ntablah. The result is a remarkable blend of old Chinese and old\r\nIndian sounds, and a new sound that breathes new life into an ancient\r\nart. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6479ba70-b3fa-45c2-8bb7-9449be504ec9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-6479ba70-b3fa-45c2-8bb7-9449be504ec9\"><!--a--></a>Innovation can take place\r\nin two ways. First, in presentation techniques, such as revolving\r\nstage platforms, digital projections and creative moveable sets.\r\nBhaskar's Arts Academy, for example, has made good use of theatrical\r\nlighting and multimedia projections to enhance its Indian traditional\r\ndance. Second, in the adoption of alternative cultural elements.\r\nOur arts groups can infuse our traditional art forms with modern\r\nor cross-cultural influences, or even elements from other art forms\r\naltogether. Era Dance Theatre, for example, has incorporated other\r\nMalay art forms like the Angklung, Kulintang and Wayang Kulit into\r\nits traditional Malay dances.

So aside from legal avenues,\r\nit may also be useful to take a more holistic approach to tackle\r\nthe problem. We need to create a national culture to reject cyber-bullying\r\nand, as such, we should enlist the support and assistance of all\r\nrelevant sectors of our society \u2013 especially parents, schools, the\r\nyouths and children themselves \u2212 against cyber-bullying. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3c7dee1b-f97c-4aaa-984e-d15d28bdb0cf\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-3c7dee1b-f97c-4aaa-984e-d15d28bdb0cf\"><!--a--></a>National anti-cyber bullying\r\nawareness campaigns can be a good option. We understand that talks\r\non bullying awareness are currently not mandatory in schools \u2013 and\r\ndisciplinary measures, anecdotally from parents, for cyber-bullying\r\ncases, are not as strict or tough compared to physical bullying.\r\nSo, can the Government, especially with the help of MOE, do more\r\nto stop the surge of cyber-bullying? Can we engage teachers, parents\r\nas well as other segments of society, such as IT and social media organisations,\r\nglobal tech and social media brand names and other community organisations,\r\nas key partners to help in our anti-cyber bullying efforts? To eliminate cyber-bullying, it\r\nwould help if the culprits also know that the law in Singapore does\r\nnot tolerate cyber-bullying and that our society rejects cyber bullies\r\nand their actions. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-3c5210e6-5476-4e53-9e0d-120bbffa1b63\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-3c5210e6-5476-4e53-9e0d-120bbffa1b63\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1808</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading\" id=\"id-6a627331-d46c-48f7-b952-6fa0f924cb51\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-6a627331-d46c-48f7-b952-6fa0f924cb51\"><!--a--></a>Cyber-wellness for Pre-schoolers</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-06523bb5-916f-4e5e-b10b-b2d1339e76df\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-06523bb5-916f-4e5e-b10b-b2d1339e76df\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Ms Low Yen Ling (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nMr Chairman, the Inter-Ministry Cyber-wellness Steering Committee\r\naims to encourage and support cyber-wellness.

Extremists are using the Internet to\r\nreach out to the bigger world, and self-radicalisation can occur\r\nfrom the comfort of the home half the world away.

Does MICA agree that we do need a more transparent\r\nand accountable approach to regulating our arts and film industry\r\nso that guidelines are published and followed? In this way, both\r\nartists and Government officials do not need to second guess what\r\nis permissible. Second, it is regarding the collation of data to\r\nstudy the impact of arts policies. I understand that there has been general\r\nstatistics collated with regard to arts attendance and the number\r\nof activities \u2013 that has been ongoing for many years now. However,\r\nwould MICA collate very detailed information about the funded arts\r\ngroups so that we know what their impact on our arts scene is? Not just\r\ngeneral arts attendance but looking at subsidy per head, for example, looking\r\nat ticket pricing, at the way their expenditures are broken down,\r\nso that we can help these arts groups develop further and remain\r\nrelevant to Singaporeans, and not just to an elite audience.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-85e3bbb7-4a57-4179-a8b0-78f59311cd5d\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-85e3bbb7-4a57-4179-a8b0-78f59311cd5d\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1823</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading hcTime\" id=\"id-98cb3646-745e-4352-9e61-f529faca86c9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-98cb3646-745e-4352-9e61-f529faca86c9\"><!--a--></a>5.45 pm</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5054653f-a32d-42ae-b13b-2321b5c1b79c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-5054653f-a32d-42ae-b13b-2321b5c1b79c\"><!--a--></a>My third clarification\r\nis regarding what the Minister of State Mr Chan Chun Sing mentioned.\r\nHe said that forum theatre has been a very good initiative as a\r\nway of reaching out to the community, and I totally agree with him.\r\nForum theatre is a very important platform to discuss social issues\r\nthat are relevant to the community, and it requires audience participation\r\nas part of the dramatic process.

But this\r\nwill take a long time and, really, not something which the Government\r\ncan compel.

I have\r\nasked MICA for a list of all the Arts Festivals and it gave me a\r\nlist of 52 festivals. I am not sure if all of them really qualify\r\nas Arts Festivals but they do give a sense of the vibrancy of our\r\narts scene. Can I ask the Minister to consider setting up an umbrella\r\ndiscussion body to look at the strategic development of all the\r\nmajor Arts Festivals and the overarching areas of mutual interests?\r\nIn this way, while the events may themselves be run by different organisations,\r\nthere can be better coordination in marketing and planning, and\r\nalso a louder voice to shout out to the world of the feast of festivals\r\nthat is available here.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-ed1e8697-e6ea-44a2-b8fc-5790216a7403\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-ed1e8697-e6ea-44a2-b8fc-5790216a7403\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a53f7d82-563c-4538-8a2d-b596d7263cd5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a53f7d82-563c-4538-8a2d-b596d7263cd5\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nWell, actually, the umbrella body exists. It is called the NAC.\r\nThe National Arts Council is the umbrella body to manage the arts\r\nscene in Singapore.\r\nBut I do agree with the Member that we can do better in terms of coordinating\r\nbecause a large number of the festivals are run by the private sector\r\ngroups and organisations, which is basically a very good development\r\nfor us here in Singapore. To be able to manage a very, very, crowded\r\nand well-packed calendar, right down to the last details of timing\r\nand non-overlapping places, I think it would be very difficult.\r\nI agree with her. In fact, we are looking into this very seriously.\r\nAs to whether or not we need to create another body, I think that\r\nwould be redundant. How can NAC play a better role? In fact, as\r\nI mentioned in my earlier reply to Ms Janice Koh, we did, for example, coordinate\r\nsome of the events at the Esplanade, and some events staged during\r\nthe Singapore Arts Festival, which is run by NAC, and those run\r\nby the private sector organisations. But I agree that we need to\r\ndo more so that we can have this fantastic calendar that not only\r\ncan show Singaporeans but also can display internationally. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-31d8c39e-3516-4d6a-9fd9-229c863b5192\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-31d8c39e-3516-4d6a-9fd9-229c863b5192\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1825</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-deca5440-e463-498d-9a70-e557cb86d882\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-deca5440-e463-498d-9a70-e557cb86d882\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Zaqy Mohamad</strong>\r\n                  </span>: I thank\r\nthe Minister for his clarification and his speech earlier.

For professionals,\r\nwe have training skills; for practitioners, perhaps there is something\r\nthat we need to work on. I know some do not receive CPF if they\r\nare working on a project basis.

One of them\r\nis the Capability Development Roadmap, and this is where we will\r\nwork with art practitioners and enthusiasts out there to help them.\r\nNAC is also working with WDA to roll out CET programmes to help\r\nthe practitioners upgrade their skills. I do not think the Government can\r\nguarantee that everyone of them will have a fantastic livelihood\r\nbut what we can do, as I responded to Ms Janice Koh, is that we\r\ncreate an eco-system or platform and, hopefully, practitioners in\r\nthe field can take advantage of that. And we support not only in\r\nterms of training but also in terms of honing their craft. There\r\nare a lot of efforts by MDA and NAC to help some of the practitioners\r\nimprove their skills. By doing so, we hope that, over time, they\r\ncan deliver better performances and therefore garner better audiences.\r\nSo, I agree with him that this is something which we have to pay\r\nattention to but, at the end of the day, as I mentioned also in\r\nmy reply, some of the practitioners have to weigh this against the\r\nopportunity cost because if you take time away from producing and\r\ntraining, you will lose some time. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c7cf3098-f21b-48b7-a266-d43bb2486f64\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-c7cf3098-f21b-48b7-a266-d43bb2486f64\"><!--a--></a>On the NGN, as far the\r\ncommercial sector is concerned, we do not have much of a problem\r\nother than some of the earlier teething problems that we had with\r\nbuilding owners opening up access to OpenNet, to be able to bring\r\nin the fibre.

In terms\r\nof the diversity of services \u2013 there were 14 to 16-odd kind of services.\r\nThere are many more other providers out there offering a whole range\r\nof services. So, MICA's assessment is that the NGN is slowly but\r\nsurely developing an eco-system to allow new creative ideas to come\r\nonboard. The pipeline is big, and he is right that we want to try\r\nand push a lot through the pipeline. We cannot mandate it again\r\nbut we have to work with the private sector.

But there is a cost to OpenNet. The reason\r\nIDA initially obligated OpenNet to send all these letters to inform\r\nthe residents is because when you roll out programmes, you have\r\nto mobilise resources. And once you miss a certain estate, to roll\r\nit back again, it will incur costs [<em class=\"ph i\">Interruption</em>]. But we\r\nhave to inform you so that you will be at home when we come so that\r\nwe can roll out either to your gate or whatever the case may be.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-75d9fe50-e004-4f11-adf0-8f04067f51b1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-75d9fe50-e004-4f11-adf0-8f04067f51b1\"><!--a--></a>We have done it twice,\r\nthrough two letters. First one may be thrown out, but not the second\r\none. But the point is, as I have mentioned in my reply, there were\r\na lot of efforts by IDA to mobilise grassroots, various organisations.\r\nThe picture I showed Members was an exhibition in Geylang Serai\r\nwhere IDA worked very closely with local grassroots to advertise\r\nabout the roll out. But having said that, we will concede that there\r\nwill be some instances where people were away, or whatever the case\r\nmay be. As I mentioned in my reply, we looked at every appeal and\r\nnine out of 10 appeals have already been acceded to by OpenNet.\r\nWe have to understand it from that perspective. All of us received\r\nthe first letter and then we got feedback according to IDA that\r\npeople did not understand the first letter. That is why, maybe,\r\nit was thrown away. We changed and the second letter had a big text\r\nthat says \"OpenNet Free Installation\", and so on. We have tried\r\nour very best. To do so now, I think it is not fair to OpenNet.\r\nHaving said that, we have also worked with some of the Retail Service\r\nProviders (RSPs) to see whether they could bundle and, in fact,\r\nthey have been offering plans, to waive the installation fee if you\r\nsign up for a service plan. Because all of us, after we get connected,\r\nmust have a service plan. What is the point of having a fibre network\r\nat home when you have no service plan? This is again another opportunity\r\nto work together with some of the RSPs that are already servicing\r\nyou or new RSPs to try and get fibre into your homes.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-ed634bd8-c19d-4d60-bfb8-2f015c8ea5eb\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-ed634bd8-c19d-4d60-bfb8-2f015c8ea5eb\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6a340d52-7296-4f8e-9876-0fa6666a74ba\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-6a340d52-7296-4f8e-9876-0fa6666a74ba\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">The Chairman</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Nicholas\r\nFang, last clarification.

She has already\r\nbeen christened the Arts NMP. My concern is that this is praise\r\nand discernment from the converted. Recent comments on the REACH\r\nwebsite shows that there is still broad perception that the arts\r\nand culture is for the elite or perhaps hoity-toity, as Ms Irene\r\nNg put it earlier.

We hope that the various\r\nconstituencies will take advantage of the resources that we are deploying\r\nat the ground.

When I see my senior\r\ncitizen ladies doing line dancing, week in, week out \u2212 large groups,\r\nI mean they are having fun. But it is an art form. They go through\r\nclasses.

I came across\r\nresidents who, after caring for their parents for so many years\r\nand when their parents passed away, they have no place to stay.\r\nAnother would be to increase the possibilities for children to live\r\nnear their parents, by building more flats in mature estates and\r\ngive them priority to these flats. I would also like to suggest\r\nto let those elderly who choose to downgrade under the newly introduced\r\nSilver Housing Bonus be given the priority to choose a flat near\r\ntheir children.

He spoke on what the economists referred to as the pig cycle.\r\nI think the economists in this House will know the cobweb theorem.\r\nWhen the price of pork is high, pig farmers rear more pigs in the\r\nhope that they will make more money. However, when the piglets grow\r\nup and reach the market, there is, of course, a glut and prices\r\ndrop. Farmers then cut the number of piglets they are going to raise\r\nthe next time, and thereby ensuring that when these piglets mature,\r\nthere will be a shortage and prices go up again.

But being a very\r\nwise man, wisely he added a caveat that in real life, events seldom\r\nmove in accordance with projections.

We have also raised the income\r\nceiling for the grant from $8,000 to $10,000, to enable more singles\r\nto qualify for the grant. Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim\r\nand Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked that we allow singles to buy BTO flats\r\ndirectly. Actually if they are above 21 years old, they can already\r\ndo so. They can form a family nucleus with their parents to buy\r\na new flat together because, as Er Dr Lee put it, the motivation\r\nis that he or she can look after their parents; so they should be\r\nstaying together. So long as they are above 21 years old, they can\r\nalready do so. But if they just want to be alone and stay by themselves,\r\nI am still mulling over how to help them as well as other groups\r\nfaced with special circumstances, eg, foreign spouses, as mentioned\r\nby Mr Desmond Lee earlier. I have not forgotten these groups. They\r\nare very much on the top of my head. Last year, my priority was\r\nfirst-timers; this year, various groups of second-timers. I think after\r\nI bite into this and address the problem in a substantial way, I\r\nwill try to find some solutions for some of these singles as well\r\nas other special groups.

These are victims of misfortune\r\nand sometimes our policies and rules do leave them cold on the wrong\r\nside. Let me give one example. Last December, which was not too\r\nlong ago, the local media reported \u2013 if you remember \u2013 of a freak\r\naccident off Pasir Panjang Terminal in which a Singaporean lorry\r\ndriver was killed. The deceased had earlier successfully selected\r\na 4-room BTO flat in Chua Chu Kang. But he never got to enjoy this\r\nnew flat. He left behind a widow and four children. Media report\r\nhighlighted his widow's plight that she was at risk of losing the\r\nBTO flat and becoming homeless, because she is a foreigner. The\r\nrule is clear \u2013 the flat is for Singaporeans. We design policies\r\nto cater to the vast majority of population, with clear rules laid\r\nout, to promote self-reliance and prevent abuse or gaming. But when\r\nwe come across deserving cases, we must exercise compassion and\r\ntreat them as special cases. For victims of misfortune, I have always\r\nimpressed on my MND colleagues that our default position is to try\r\nto say \"yes\", to help give such victims a leg-up at a time of need. So,\r\nfor the Pasir Panjang accident case, HDB is helping the family to\r\nkeep their 4-room flat in Chua Chu Kang, which I think will be completed\r\nnext year. Fortunately, while the widow is a foreigner, the children\r\nare Singaporeans. So, that gives me a leverage, a reason to allow\r\nthis family to retain this flat.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-27920efb-3edd-4b78-a25b-dd83f77b8bbc\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-27920efb-3edd-4b78-a25b-dd83f77b8bbc\"><!--a--></a>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, Mr\r\nMuhamad Faisal Manap and Mr Lim Biow Chuan spoke about the plight\r\nof divorcees.

As we free\r\nup, loosen the balloting for second-timers, many of them should\r\nbe able to benefit from this initiative. Last year, we allocated\r\n670 public rental flats to divorcees with children. This is more\r\nthan 20% of the rental flats allocated last year. Nevertheless,\r\nwe must be mindful that divorcees do not form a homogenous group.\r\nIn the West, many sympathetic rules designed to help divorcees get\r\nabused, with couples claiming such benefits even though their marriages\r\nare intact.

We take care of one another \u2013 <em class=\"ph i\">gotong royong</em> \u2013\r\nas well as our little <em class=\"ph i\">kampong</em>.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-687ba45b-2895-4e9e-920e-98b0c072d20c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-687ba45b-2895-4e9e-920e-98b0c072d20c\"><!--a--></a>As we moved into city\r\nliving, many things improved. But, yet, we became more isolated\r\nfrom one another even when we lived more closely together. And that\r\nis the irony of it. Much of the <em class=\"ph i\">kampong</em> spirit is lost. Many\r\ndo not even know their neighbours. We lost some of the basic courtesy\r\nwe used to have for one another. We care less about our neighbours\r\nand the community spaces that we share.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0d9c9830-81cd-4444-8e48-7e84e1845e57\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-0d9c9830-81cd-4444-8e48-7e84e1845e57\"><!--a--></a>There are many reasons\r\nfor the loss of the <em class=\"ph i\">kampong</em> spirit. But we need to find ways to\r\nencourage residents to own their community and to care for one another\r\nagain. To be sure, there are areas in Singapore where the <em class=\"ph i\">kampong</em> spirit\r\nremains strong. I am most proud and happy that the <em class=\"ph i\">kampong </em>spirit\r\nin my constituency is very strong. Yishun South as well, so said\r\nEr Dr Lee Bee Wah. We need to find out how such spirit can be replicated\r\nin many more places.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c6d20bb7-8261-4e16-a533-ef2b211565f6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-c6d20bb7-8261-4e16-a533-ef2b211565f6\"><!--a--></a>Second, how do we prepare\r\nfor the silver tsunami? In 20 years' time, one in five Singaporeans\r\nwill be over 65 years old; one in 20 over 80. If I am still alive,\r\nI will be one of the one in 20. Many will be living alone because\r\nmany Singaporeans have chosen not to get married. The whole texture\r\nof society will change. The built environment will need to evolve\r\nto accommodate the needs and aspirations of older Singaporeans.\r\nCertainly, we will need more nursing homes, more day care centres,\r\nmore day rehabilitation centres, better wheelchair access, etc.\r\nBut there is much more that is needed. There is no one size that\r\nwill fit all. We do not know exactly which will work more effectively.\r\nWe just need to try many models to see which one works best for\r\nus.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5ec06370-1874-431d-8055-e9c1abd44402\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-5ec06370-1874-431d-8055-e9c1abd44402\"><!--a--></a>Third, how do we keep\r\nour city world-class? There are many islands along and around the\r\nMalacca Straits and South China Sea. That Singapore is a prosperous\r\nFirst World city,\r\nwhile other islands remain undeveloped is perhaps due to our good\r\nfortune in history but also to the foresight and diligence of our\r\npioneers. But nothing stays forever. Just look at history. Many\r\nof the older cities in the United States have shrunk. The economy\r\nthat drove the growth of these cities withered. Businesses and jobs\r\nwent away. Similar history played out in UK and many European cities.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1846</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-85c7317f-6f43-47a5-812c-a2e49ed9ae0a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-85c7317f-6f43-47a5-812c-a2e49ed9ae0a\"><!--a--></a>Singapore must stay at\r\nthe top of the competition of cities because this is our only city.\r\nAnd it is not just about the economy. Our children are now well-educated.\r\nMany are much sought after by other countries and cities for their\r\ntalent. To keep them here, Singapore must remain the best place\r\nfor them to live, work and play. Beyond a vibrant physical landscape,\r\nwe must aspire to cultivate a graciousness of life in Singapore, founded\r\non the ethos of inclusiveness, compassion and kindness \u2212 kindness\r\nfor all living things, kindness for our environment.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ae4986cf-7ffb-40e1-88c4-5bfbef5e0e9b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-ae4986cf-7ffb-40e1-88c4-5bfbef5e0e9b\"><!--a--></a>In short, MND's strategic\r\nchallenge is to prepare for a very different world, physically and\r\nsocially.
