It\r\n\r\nmakes  a correction of a mistake that crept  into\r\n\r\nthe Bill when it was considered last time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 seeks to add a proviso to section 26 of\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance. Under section 26, people who  are\r\n\r\nentitled  to  become citizens  of  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nbeing  registered for an initial period of  three\r\n\r\nmonths  ending 31st January, 1958. So  far,  more\r\n\r\nthan  230,000  citizens have been registered  but\r\n\r\nthere have been cases in which the Registrars are\r\n\r\nnot   in   a   position  to  grant   certificates\r\n\r\nimmediately on application and have had to  defer\r\n\r\nthe  cases for further investigation. This clause\r\n\r\nseeks  to enable those deferred cases, when  they\r\n\r\nhave  been  finalised within one month after  the\r\n\r\nregistration period, to be allowed to be included\r\n\r\nin the electoral register.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been about 5,000 deferred cases of\r\n\r\nvarious  categories, such as people  who  applied\r\n\r\nwith  identity cards defaced and have to get  new\r\n\r\nones  to  satisfy the Registrar on the claims  on\r\n\r\nthe  application form, people who  were  born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and claimed birth elsewhere,  cases  of\r\n\r\nabsences  from  the Colony, and cases  where  the\r\n\r\napplicants are seamen and were unable to  satisfy\r\n\r\nthe Registrar that their absences fall within the\r\n\r\napproved categories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is doing all it can to finalise\r\n\r\nconsideration of these deferred cases within  one\r\n\r\nmonth  from  31st January, 1958, and it  is  felt\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  but fair that those who  registered\r\n\r\nduring   the   registration  period   but   whose\r\n\r\napplications   are   deferred   pending   further\r\n\r\ninvestigation, should  their  applications   be\r\n\r\napproved  and  citizenship granted  them,  should\r\n\r\nqualify  for inclusion on the electoral  register\r\n\r\nfor the purpose of the next general election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because the initial registration period\r\n\r\nwill come to an end on 31st January, 1958, that a\r\n\r\nCertificate of Urgency has been found  necessary.\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b>\r\n\r\nSir, I second it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.16 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not\r\n\r\nmaking   a   speech   but   just   a   point   of\r\n\r\nclarification.

In order  to\r\n\r\nimplement  this decision, a scheme was  formulated\r\n\r\nin  September  1953  whereby  Government  servants\r\n\r\ncould  borrow from Government through the  Malaya-Borneo  Building Society, Ltd., acting as  agents,\r\n\r\nto enable them to purchase their own houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, it was decided to give further\r\n\r\nassistance  to the Singapore Government  Officers'\r\n\r\nCo-operative  Housing Society  Limited  which  had\r\n\r\nbeen  established in December 1948 and  which  had\r\n\r\nalready  been granted a loan of $200,000  in  June\r\n\r\n1951  for the purpose of building houses for  sale\r\n\r\non hire-purchase to its members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housing loan scheme for Government servants\r\n\r\noperated  by  the Malaya-Borneo Building  Society,\r\n\r\nLtd. was  approved in September 1953.

This sum was fully committed by the  end\r\n\r\nof  the  year and a further sum of $1,000,000  was\r\n\r\nadvanced  in  January 1954. The demand  for  loans\r\n\r\ncontinued and further sums of $1,000,000 were made\r\n\r\navailable  in  September 1954 and  in  March  1955\r\n\r\nrespectively,  making  the  total  of   $5,000,000\r\n\r\noutlaid  in  housing loans to Government  servants\r\n\r\nthrough the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagency of the Malaya-Borneo Building Society, Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of interest charged on these loans has\r\n\r\nbeen  5  per  cent  per annum, out  of  which  the\r\n\r\nSociety   has   retained   one   per   cent    for\r\n\r\nadministrative expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government Officers' Co-operative\r\n\r\nHousing  Society  Ltd. had been given  a  loan  of\r\n\r\n$200,000  in  June  1951 to be  repaid  by  annual\r\n\r\ninstalments  of $20,000 commencing in the  twelfth\r\n\r\nyear following the grant of the loan. The rate  of\r\n\r\ninterest charged was 3\u00bd per cent per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the decision to assist locally-domiciled Government officers to buy their own\r\n\r\nhouses,  another loan of $500,000 was approved  to\r\n\r\nthe  Society in October 1953, to be repaid  either\r\n\r\nby  annual instalments of $25,000 or with interest\r\n\r\nand capital repayable at three years' notice after\r\n\r\na  minimum  period of 12 years. In  April  1954  a\r\n\r\nthird  loan  of  $1,000,000 was  approved,  to  be\r\n\r\nrepaid  by  annual instalments of  not  less  than\r\n\r\n$50,000,  repayment to be completed in  21  years.\r\n\r\nThe  rate  of interest charged on these loans  was\r\n\r\nalso 3\u00bd per cent per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1956, the Staff Side of the Singapore Civil\r\n\r\nService  Joint  Council requested that  Government\r\n\r\nshould  give  further assistance  to  enable  more\r\n\r\nlocally-domiciled Government officers  to  acquire\r\n\r\ntheir  own  houses.  This  request  received  very\r\n\r\ncareful consideration in the light of Government's\r\n\r\noverall financial resources and of the fact that a\r\n\r\ntotal  of $6,700,000 had already been tied  up  in\r\n\r\nhousing loans. In view, however, of the importance\r\n\r\nof  implementing the 1953 decision to the limit of\r\n\r\nGovernment's  financial capacity, it  was  decided\r\n\r\nthat  a  further sum of $2,000,000 should be  made\r\n\r\navailable to the Singapore Government Officers' Co-operative  Housing  Society.  It  was  considered,\r\n\r\nhowever,  that this further sum should be directed\r\n\r\nmore particularly to giving assistance to officers\r\n\r\nin  the subordinate grades of the service, and the\r\n\r\nSociety was asked to frame a satisfactory low-cost\r\n\r\nhousing scheme for Divisions III and IV officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA   satisfactory  scheme  has  now  been  prepared\r\n\r\nproviding for the construction of both single- and\r\n\r\ndouble-storeyed houses, and this has been approved\r\n\r\nby  Government.

The loan will be adequately secured against\r\n\r\nthe immovable property of the Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of interest which should be charged on\r\n\r\nthis  new  loan  has been the subject  of  careful\r\n\r\nconsideration  and  discussion with  the  Society.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the officers of the Society are anxious\r\n\r\nto  obtain the loan on the cheapest possible terms\r\n\r\nand have advanced the argument that since previous\r\n\r\nloans,  which have been utilised to provide houses\r\n\r\nfor fairly senior officers, have borne interest of\r\n\r\n3\u00bd  per  cent,  it is inappropriate that  the  new\r\n\r\nloan,  which  is  to be devoted to  the  needs  of\r\n\r\nsubordinate  officers, should bear interest  at  a\r\n\r\nhigher  rate.  The force of this  argument  is  of\r\n\r\ncourse  appreciated. At the same  time,  the  fact\r\n\r\nremains   that   interest  rates  have   increased\r\n\r\nconsiderably since previous loans were granted and\r\n\r\nthat  in  these  circumstances, it  would  not  be\r\n\r\nproper  to  tie  money up for a period  of  twenty\r\n\r\nyears  at  a  rate  of  interest  which  bears  no\r\n\r\nresemblance to current market rates. At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  note  was  taken of  the  decision  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government to grant loans on  favourable\r\n\r\nterms.  In  all the circumstances, it was  thought\r\n\r\nthat  all interests would be served by the  charge\r\n\r\nof interest of 4\u00bd per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This decision to charge interest on the further\r\n\r\nloan  to  the  Society at 4\u00bd per cent  raised  the\r\n\r\nquestion of the adjustment of the rate of interest\r\n\r\ncharged  on  loans made through the  Malaya-Borneo\r\n\r\nBuilding Society. This at present stands  at  five\r\n\r\nper  cent of which, as I said before, the  Society\r\n\r\nretains  one  per cent as an agency  fee  and  for\r\n\r\nadministrative  expenses. In this  connection,  it\r\n\r\nwas  noted that the Malaya-Borneo Building Society\r\n\r\nhad  itself  adjusted interest rates  on  its  own\r\n\r\nloans  in  sympathy with the increase in  interest\r\n\r\nrates  generally. After consideration of  all  the\r\n\r\nfactors concerned,  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit was decided that the rate of  interest\r\n\r\non  existing and future loans through the  Society\r\n\r\nshould be raised to six per cent of which one  per\r\n\r\ncent  would be retained by the Society.  The  loan\r\n\r\nagreements  issued  by the Society  require  three\r\n\r\nmonths'  notice  to be given of  any  increase  in\r\n\r\ninterest  rate.  Consequently,  the  new  rate  of\r\n\r\ninterest  on the existing loans will be  effective\r\n\r\nfrom the 1st of May, 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, I second the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves of the loan by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to the Singapore Government  Officers'\r\n\r\nCo-operative Housing Society Limited of the sum of\r\n\r\n$2,000,000 at an interest rate of 4\u00bd per cent  per\r\n\r\nannum     repayable   by   eleven   equal   annual\r\n\r\ninstalments to start from the 11th year after  the\r\n\r\ngrant  of  the loan and be completed in  the  21st\r\n\r\nyear, to be secured by a legal mortgage of all the\r\n\r\nimmovable properties belonging to the Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 3424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>GOVERNMENT LOAN TO CITY COUNCIL OF $4,000,000</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.03 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency\r\n\r\nthe Governor's authority to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves the loan by the\r\n\r\nGovernment to the City Council of $4,000,000  free\r\n\r\nof  interest  and  to be repaid  by  equal  annual\r\n\r\ninstalments over a period of ten years.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the proposal to build the Merdeka\r\n\r\nBridge   and   connected  road-works   was   under\r\n\r\nconsideration, discussions were held with the City\r\n\r\nCouncil  about the apportionment of liability  for\r\n\r\nthe   cost  of  the  undertaking.  After   lengthy\r\n\r\ndiscussions, it was agreed that Government  should\r\n\r\nmeet  the  cost  of  the bridge,  while  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil, which   was   responsible    for    the\r\n\r\nconstruction and maintenance of roads and  bridges\r\n\r\nwithin the city area, should meet the cost of  the\r\n\r\nnew  roads  leading to the bridge, the  Guillemard\r\n\r\nRoad  and  other  necessary  roundabouts  and  the\r\n\r\nbridge  over the Stamford Canal.

This\r\n\r\ndecision  was taken by the Governor in Council  in\r\n\r\nJuly 1954 but owing to an oversight was not put to\r\n\r\nthe  Legislative  Council for formal  approval  at\r\n\r\nthat  time.
