The  former\r\n\r\nGovernment  under the leadership  of  Mr  Marshall\r\n\r\nforged a pattern of democratic progress and the new\r\n\r\nGovernment,  with  the advantage of  continuity  of\r\n\r\npersonnel, will seek to ensure continuity of policy\r\n\r\nand  its  plans for the future are linked with  the\r\n\r\nachievements of the past 17 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 4</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Government stands for the early attainment\r\n\r\nof complete internal self-government and recognises\r\n\r\nthat  successful self-government must be  based  on\r\n\r\nnational prosperity and national solidarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Friendly contacts and discussions with our\r\n\r\ntrading  neighbours have already brought  Singapore\r\n\r\nbenefits   and  the  Government  will  take   every\r\n\r\nopportunity   of   continuing  to   explore   trade\r\n\r\npossibilities    and    promote    sound    trading\r\n\r\nrelationships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The Government will also promote the expansion\r\n\r\nof  existing  industries  on  the  island  and  the\r\n\r\nestablishment of new industries. For  this  purpose\r\n\r\nthere  must be adequate capital investment.  It  is\r\n\r\nhoped  that  the  rate of capital formation  within\r\n\r\nSingapore  can be increased so that the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore can finance their own prosperity.  It  is\r\n\r\nrecognised, however, that there is a need to import\r\n\r\ncapital   and,  consequently, to  attract  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestment,  if  employment  opportunities  are  to\r\n\r\nmatch the needs of our growing population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. As recommended by the International Bank\r\n\r\nMission the Government is preparing legislation  to\r\n\r\nset  up an Industrial Promotion Board to assist the\r\n\r\nsmall-scale  manufacturer  and  is  examining   the\r\n\r\npossible  establishment of an  Industrial  Research\r\n\r\nInstitute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The Government attaches much importance to the\r\n\r\nencouragement  and  expansion of  agricultural  and\r\n\r\nfisheries  production. The island-wide Agricultural\r\n\r\nShow  to  be  opened  on 1st September  will  bring\r\n\r\ntogether,  for  the  first time in  Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nvaried  and  valuable products of our  farmers  and\r\n\r\nfishermen  and  will encourage them  to  adopt  new\r\n\r\ntechniques   and   aim  at  higher   standards   of\r\n\r\nachievement. It is hoped to secure the services  of\r\n\r\nan   experienced  veterinary  geneticist  who  will\r\n\r\nimprove  the  breeding of local  pigs  and  poultry\r\n\r\nwhilst   the   Animal  Husbandry  and  Agricultural\r\n\r\nStation  to  be  built shortly  at  Sembawang  will\r\n\r\ndecentralise  the  veterinary services  and  enable\r\n\r\nfarmers  to improve their livestock, to  learn  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  chemical fertilisers and to secure  better\r\n\r\nseeds. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExperimental fish ponds to provide fry for commercial\r\n\r\nbreeding purposes will be included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The need to provide and to improve farming\r\n\r\nlands is accepted and the Government will give  its\r\n\r\nconsideration  to measures aimed at giving  farmers\r\n\r\nboth   security   of   tenure  and   freedom   from\r\n\r\nexploitation.  Road development  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nopen  up  farming and rural areas  both  for  their\r\n\r\neconomic  advantage  and for  provision  of  social\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. A special campaign will be conducted to\r\n\r\nemphasise  the  aims  and  advantages  of  the  co-operative  movement, and all possible encouragement\r\n\r\nwill be given to farmers and fishermen to establish\r\n\r\nand develop co-operative enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Development of the fishing industry will\r\n\r\nreceive close\r\n\r\nattention,  particularly the expansion of  deep-sea\r\n\r\nfishing. The plan for local fishermen to operate in\r\n\r\nconjunction  with skilled Japanese  interests  will\r\n\r\ndevelop more advanced methods and improve supplies.\r\n\r\nA  pilot co-operative scheme is now being put  into\r\n\r\noperation  for  fishermen at Ponggol  and  if  this\r\n\r\nproves  successful consideration will be  given  to\r\n\r\nfurther  schemes of this nature in  order  to  free\r\n\r\nfishermen from debt and at the same time to improve\r\n\r\nmarketing methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. It is the objective of the Government not only\r\n\r\nto increase the total wealth\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  but also to ensure  that  wealth  is\r\n\r\ndiffused throughout the population and that the gap\r\n\r\nbetween  the  largest incomes and the  smallest  is\r\n\r\nsteadily reduced. Whilst this is partly a matter of\r\n\r\nthe  cash  earnings  of  the worker,  diffusion  of\r\n\r\nwealth  also  occurs  through  improvement  of  the\r\n\r\nsocial  services provided out of national  revenue.\r\n\r\nIn  this  connection Government policy  is  one  of\r\n\r\nimproving  social services of all kinds  especially\r\n\r\nin those areas, whether urban or rural, whose needs\r\n\r\nhave not been fully met in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Extended medical facilities will be continued\r\n\r\nthrough  a system of clinics throughout the island.\r\n\r\nIncreasing  provision  of  trained  personnel  will\r\n\r\nenable nursing attention to be given in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhomes  of  the  people. The implementation  of  the\r\n\r\neducation policy laid down in the White Paper  will\r\n\r\nensure  that local schools will provide a  steadily\r\n\r\nimproving   standard   of   education   at   points\r\n\r\nconvenient and accessible to local residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. The building of community centres will be\r\n\r\naccelerated  in  co-operation  with  the   numerous\r\n\r\ngroups  who are already establishing or seeking  to\r\n\r\nestablish   community   centres   on   their    own\r\n\r\ninitiative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. Whilst Singapore's business community is\r\n\r\nserved  by  a  system of excellent  communications,\r\n\r\nthere  is a growing need for expansion in the rural\r\n\r\nareas.  The  Five-Year Postal Services  Development\r\n\r\nPlan  will bring real benefits to neglected  areas,\r\n\r\npriority  being given to the islands. At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime  the  Singapore Telephone Board  is  expanding\r\n\r\ntelephone  facilities through its  own  large-scale\r\n\r\ndevelopment plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. Plans are also in hand for decentralisation of\r\n\r\nother  social services, including public assistance\r\n\r\nand the Citizens Advice Bureau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. Hand in hand with decentralisation and\r\n\r\ndiffusion  of services will go decentralisation  of\r\n\r\nthe local government system on the lines set out in\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper,  Cmd. No. 30 of  1956.  District\r\n\r\nCouncils  will be established before the middle  of\r\n\r\n1957,  and will enable rural dwellers to deal  with\r\n\r\ntheir    own    problems    through    their    own\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  and  to make  democracy  a  living\r\n\r\nreality  in their daily lives. The Local Government\r\n\r\nBill  and the Local Elections Bill, to give  effect\r\n\r\nto  this  policy, will be introduced  at  the  next\r\n\r\nsitting of this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. Improvements in the standard of living of the\r\n\r\npeople depend to a considerable extent on expansion\r\n\r\nof  productive industry, for which an  increase  in\r\n\r\nthe number of skilled workers is required. This has\r\n\r\nbeen, and will be, given the highest priority.  Two\r\n\r\nsecondary  technical schools are now operating  and\r\n\r\nmore  are  planned. The building of the Polytechnic\r\n\r\nwill  commence shortly. A Joint Industrial  Council\r\n\r\nhas  recently been set up to advise on an expanding\r\n\r\nsystem  of apprenticeships which will enable  young\r\n\r\npeople to learn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non   the   job  with  an  appropriate   amount   of\r\n\r\ntheoretical teaching in the classroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. The Government intends to increase\r\n\r\nopportunities  for careers in the merchant  marine.\r\n\r\nApproval has been given to a scholarship scheme  to\r\n\r\nassist  likely students to acquire secondary school\r\n\r\neducation in order to qualify for entry to  careers\r\n\r\nas  deck  and  engineer officers. Plans  are  being\r\n\r\nworked  out to assist locally domiciled  seamen  to\r\n\r\nqualify  for more responsible positions.  Proposals\r\n\r\nfor  training  Local Trade Masters as  pilots  have\r\n\r\nalready   been   announced,   and   it   is   hoped\r\n\r\nprogressively  to  absorb more  local  men  in  the\r\n\r\npilotage service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. The teaching of certain technical skills\r\n\r\ncannot  be provided economically in a territory  as\r\n\r\nsmall  as Singapore. For this a co-ordinated scheme\r\n\r\nfor  the  use  of overseas facilities  through  the\r\n\r\nColombo  Plan and similar aid programmes  is  being\r\n\r\nworked   out.  This  will  ensure  that  everything\r\n\r\npossible   is   done   to   produce   the   trained\r\n\r\ntechnologists  and professional workers  which  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Singapore demands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. The Government is continuing to give careful\r\n\r\nstudy  to  the problems of road communications  and\r\n\r\ntransport.  The  establishment  of  a  unified  bus\r\n\r\nsystem   will  play  an  important  part  and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  publish a  White  Paper  on  this\r\n\r\nsubject shortly. The problems of traffic congestion\r\n\r\nin  Singapore's streets are becoming, as  in  other\r\n\r\ncities in the world, increasingly acute as more and\r\n\r\nmore  vehicles are registered. Measures  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  traffic  can  flow as  freely  as  conditions\r\n\r\npermit  and  to  reduce obstruction  from  kerbside\r\n\r\nparking will be introduced in a phased programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. Increasing inter-continental and regional\r\n\r\npassenger traffic at Singapore Airport, which  from\r\n\r\nJanuary-June   1956   has  exceeded   figures   for\r\n\r\nJanuary-June  1955  by 38 per cent,  and  which  is\r\n\r\nexpected  to  total  more than  300,000  passengers\r\n\r\nduring  1956,  shows  that Singapore's  Airport  is\r\n\r\nflourishing  and  may  in  future  be   almost   as\r\n\r\nimportant  as its seaport. This should bring  added\r\n\r\nbusiness and prosperity to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommunity,  and  the Government  is  determined  to\r\n\r\nencourage  this development. For these  reasons  it\r\n\r\nhas  been  decided to go forward at once  with  the\r\n\r\npermanent  Terminal  Building  at  Paya  Lebar  and\r\n\r\nconstruction will start early next year. Additional\r\n\r\nhangar accommodation is being provided immediately,\r\n\r\nand  work  on  the  apron and  taxi-way  system  is\r\n\r\ncontinuing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. Good progress is being made between the\r\n\r\nGovernments  concerned and the  Company  about  the\r\n\r\nfuture of Malayan Airways. The final agreement will\r\n\r\nbe tabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. The frequent and increasing floods which have\r\n\r\ncaused  serious damage and suffering  in  the  past\r\n\r\nconstitute a major problem for which the Government\r\n\r\nnow  has the technical solution, but which can only\r\n\r\nbe  dealt  with  as  funds can be  made  available.\r\n\r\nAdequate  land  will be reserved for  future  flood\r\n\r\ndrainage  works. The anti-flood scheme at Bedok  is\r\n\r\nnow  almost  completed, and the first  stage  of  a\r\n\r\nscheme  for the Geylang/Paya Lebar area will  start\r\n\r\nshortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. The importance of telecommunications in\r\n\r\nSingapore's commercial and social life is shown  by\r\n\r\nan  increase  in 1955 of more than 16 per  cent  in\r\n\r\noverseas  radio telephone calls, and by a total  of\r\n\r\nnearly 2,000,000 trunk calls between Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe  Federation, the latter figure illustrating the\r\n\r\nvery  close  ties between the two territories.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment will seek to maintain the efficiency  of\r\n\r\nthese  essential  services and to  expand  them  as\r\n\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. The Government is considering whether the\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  broadcasting in  Singapore  could\r\n\r\nbest  be  served by setting up a public corporation\r\n\r\nand  the  prospects of introducing  television  are\r\n\r\nbeing  examined  by a committee in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe resolution of this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. Means for prevention, control and treatment of\r\n\r\ndisease  and  ill  health  will  continue   to   be\r\n\r\nstrengthened.   In  conjunction  with   the   Royal\r\n\r\nSingapore AntiTuberculosis Association, whose  work\r\n\r\nin  this  field  has  been  outstanding,  and  with\r\n\r\nColombo  Plan  aid  from Australia,  a  large-scale\r\n\r\ncampaign  against tuberculosis is planned to  begin\r\n\r\nin 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimultaneously,  an expanding programme  of  health\r\n\r\neducation  for  the  public, and  of  training  for\r\n\r\ndoctors,  nurses,  midwives and  ancillary  medical\r\n\r\nworkers  will limit and reduce human suffering  and\r\n\r\neconomic  waste arising from preventable  diseases.\r\n\r\nWith an initial grant of $20,000 from Government, a\r\n\r\nHealth  Education  Council has been  created.  This\r\n\r\nCouncil  unites all willing persons  and  voluntary\r\n\r\nbodies  in a cooperative health education  project.\r\n\r\nIt has already received most welcome support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26. Departmental training awards have risen from 17 in 1955 to provision for 66 in 1957, whilst the\r\n\r\noutput  of fully trained nurses will increase  from 25  in  1955 to more than 100 in 1957. In order  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate the specialist training of local medical\r\n\r\nofficers,   the   Government  has   arranged   with\r\n\r\nAustralia  for  the holding of an annual  \"Primary\"\r\n\r\nExamination  in  Singapore of the Royal  Australian\r\n\r\nCollege  of Surgeons, thus saving time and  expense\r\n\r\non  sending  officers overseas, and  also  for  the\r\n\r\ntraining  of  young  specialists  by  exchange   of\r\n\r\ndoctors  with Australian teaching hospitals.  These\r\n\r\narrangements will facilitate the training of  local\r\n\r\nmedical  officers and assist in the  Malayanisation\r\n\r\nof the Medical Services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27. In addition to the 1,200 beds provided by\r\n\r\nconstruction  between April 1955 and December  1956\r\n\r\nwork   will  soon  start  on  a  500-bed   district\r\n\r\nhospital, on five more maternity and child  welfare\r\n\r\nclinics  and  on two more out-patient dispensaries.\r\n\r\nPlans  are  being  prepared for a  200-bed  chronic\r\n\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28. The principles governing the Master Plan have\r\n\r\nwon general acceptance and the Government will seek\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that land is wisely used and  carefully\r\n\r\ndeveloped  for  the  national  advantage  and  that\r\n\r\nownership   of   land  is  not  used   for   unjust\r\n\r\nexploitation.  Legislation  is  being  prepared  to\r\n\r\nprovide adequate machinery and powers for town  and\r\n\r\ncountry  planning  under  the  Ministry  of   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment, Lands and Housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29. Steps are in hand to provide the machinery\r\n\r\nrequired  for the operation of the new Land  Titles\r\n\r\nOrdinance, which will reduce the cost and  simplify\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprocedure   in   land   transactions.   The    Land\r\n\r\nAcquisition  and the Land Purchases  Control  Bills\r\n\r\nwill  be  brought  to this Assembly  after  further\r\n\r\nstudy  has been given to certain aspects  of  their\r\n\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30. Public housing development has hitherto been\r\n\r\nslowed  down,  and in some projects  even  stopped,\r\n\r\nbecause  nearly  all potential urban  and  suburban\r\n\r\nbuilding  sites  are occupied by  poor  people  who\r\n\r\nwould  suffer great hardship if evicted.  The  Land\r\n\r\nClearance  and Resettlement Plan, accepted  by  the\r\n\r\nprevious   Government,  makes  fair  and   adequate\r\n\r\nprovision  for compensating and rehousing  in  such\r\n\r\ncases, whether in appropriate permanent housing, or\r\n\r\nin  semi-urban  planned attap areas with  municipal\r\n\r\nservices,  or in farming settlements.  This  should\r\n\r\nmuch  facilitate the clearance of sites for housing\r\n\r\nand  also  for other development and the Government\r\n\r\nbuilding  programme  aims at  steady  expansion  of\r\n\r\npermanent  dwellings. To carry  out  this  building\r\n\r\nprogramme, the Singapore Improvement Trust will  be\r\n\r\nreplaced by a Housing Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31. Since rents at present constitute a very heavy\r\n\r\nburden  on  the  poor,  the  Government  has   been\r\n\r\nstudying  schemes  for  housing  subsidies.  Whilst\r\n\r\nthese  must  be  related on the  one  hand  to  the\r\n\r\nability  of the occupant to pay, they must also  be\r\n\r\nreasonable   in  relation  to  the   public   funds\r\n\r\navailable.  It is therefore proposed  that  housing\r\n\r\nsubsidy  commitments should be  subject  to  annual\r\n\r\ndiscussion  by  the Assembly, and it  is  hoped  to\r\n\r\npresent  the first scheme for housing subsidies  to\r\n\r\nthe Assembly in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32. The Government wishes to encourage owner\r\n\r\noccupation of houses and will proceed with  further\r\n\r\nschemes  in  this direction, on the  lines  of  the\r\n\r\nrecent  offer  for  sale of 68 houses,  which  drew 1,312 applications, and will seek to apply the same\r\n\r\ngeneral principles to ownership of flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33. Singapore's financial position continues to be\r\n\r\nsound,  and  the Government intends that  it  shall\r\n\r\nremain  so and that nothing shall be done to  shake\r\n\r\nconfidence in the stability of our economy and  our\r\n\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34. Essential development requirements have\r\n\r\nbeen re-examined and a revised plan will shortly be\r\n\r\nlaid  before the Assembly, setting out the priority\r\n\r\nof  requirements  for  schools,  hospitals,  public\r\n\r\nutilities and other projects. Whilst this  plan  is\r\n\r\nflexible,  it  will  state the  broad  outlines  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment   policy  within   the   framework   of\r\n\r\navailable funds over the next few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35. The Government will continue to ensure\r\n\r\neconomy in development spending by reference of all\r\n\r\nplans  to  the high-level Advisory Panel on  Public\r\n\r\nBuildings   or   to  the  Public   Works   Standing\r\n\r\nCommittee,  by which large economies  have  already\r\n\r\nbeen achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36. Development can be partly financed from\r\n\r\nexisting  reserves  but prudence  forbids  draining\r\n\r\nthese  too low and very large sums will have to  be\r\n\r\nraised by loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37. Simultaneously with large capital expenditure\r\n\r\non development expanding social services will cause\r\n\r\na  rapid  increase in recurrent expenditure,  which\r\n\r\nmust  be  met  by  increased revenue.  Considerable\r\n\r\ntaxation  potential  remains  to  be  tapped,   and\r\n\r\nmeasures to be introduced to increase revenue  will\r\n\r\nseek  to  lay the burden on the shoulders of  those\r\n\r\nmembers of the community best able to carry it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38. Singapore's fiscal and economic policies are\r\n\r\ninter-dependent  with those of  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya and consultation and co-ordination on  these\r\n\r\nsubjects   with  the  Federation  Government   will\r\n\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;39. With its population increasing very rapidly,\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  peculiarly urgent  youth  problems,\r\n\r\nwhich  involve provision both for proper  education\r\n\r\nand  upbringing  and  for economic  employment  and\r\n\r\nsatisfactory living conditions when education ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40. Development of the education system is\r\n\r\nproceeding  rapidly and is not far from  the  point\r\n\r\nwhere  free  compulsory primary  education  can  be\r\n\r\nenforced. It is not at present possible to envisage\r\n\r\nproviding secondary education for all, but the  co-ordinated  development  of education  and  training\r\n\r\nfacilities outlined\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nearlier   in   this  Address  should  ensure   that\r\n\r\nopportunities   match  individual   abilities   and\r\n\r\nnational needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41. The Government appreciates the need of\r\n\r\nthe  pupils leaving the Chinese middle schools  for\r\n\r\nan  institution  of higher education  in  which  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  their  studies  and  the  enterprise  and\r\n\r\nenthusiasm  which  brought the  Nanyang  University\r\n\r\ninto  being. It is aware, however, of the  need  to\r\n\r\nmaintain high academic standards without which  the\r\n\r\nqualifications  to be acquired will  be  of  little\r\n\r\nvalue.  The  Government is therefore at  all  times\r\n\r\nready to help the Nanyang University authorities to\r\n\r\nattain  standards  which  will  be  internationally\r\n\r\nrecognised, so that the graduates will be  able  to\r\n\r\nfind    worthwhile   employment   and    contribute\r\n\r\neffectively to the welfare of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42. Whilst providing for the needs of the\r\n\r\noutstanding,   the  able  and  the   average,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  also  care  for  those  who   are\r\n\r\nhandicapped in mind, body or character.  Plans  are\r\n\r\nin  hand  for  accommodation of mentally  deficient\r\n\r\nchildren;   the  school  for  the  blind   is   now\r\n\r\noperating;  further provision is  planned  for  the\r\n\r\ndeaf  and the dumb; an approved school for juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquents,  and a new block for  girls  at  Mount\r\n\r\nEmily  are  scheduled;  Borstal  training  will  be\r\n\r\navailable  very  shortly and necessary  legislation\r\n\r\nwill  be  introduced  in  the  Assembly;  the  most\r\n\r\nvaluable probation system is ready for expansion as\r\n\r\nrequired; two Prison  Welfare Officers will provide\r\n\r\nnot  only  for  the  morale and  rehabilitation  of\r\n\r\nprisoners,  but  also  for  assistance   to   their\r\n\r\ninnocent and distressed families; it is planned  to\r\n\r\nbuild  two hostels for unemployed boys and one  for\r\n\r\ngirls within the next 18 months; and close study is\r\n\r\nbeing   given  to  the  possibility  of   a   rural\r\n\r\nsettlement   for   old   people.   Healthy    youth\r\n\r\norganisations will continue to receive the  maximum\r\n\r\nencouragement and full training facilities, without\r\n\r\nbeing devitalised by excessive paternalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;43. The Government is paying particular attention\r\n\r\nto  the  complex problems of social security.  When\r\n\r\nthe Minimum\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nLiving Standards Committee has completed its study\r\n\r\nand  its recommendations have been correlated with\r\n\r\nthose  of  the International Labour Office  expert\r\n\r\nwho  has  been making a separate study, Government\r\n\r\nintends  to formulate and present to the  Assembly\r\n\r\nschemes  for ensuring that the first steps towards\r\n\r\nsocial  security and relief for the  hardships  of\r\n\r\nthe unemployed are taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;44. The Government will also continue to\r\n\r\nameliorate the working conditions and standards of\r\n\r\nliving  of  the workers, and, in particular,  will\r\n\r\nintroduce legislation to ensure fair conditions of\r\n\r\nemployment for shop assistants and clerks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;45. The Government is profoundly convinced that\r\n\r\nthe   expansion   of  national  prosperity,   with\r\n\r\naccompanying expansion of social services  and  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment, can only be achieved on the basis  of\r\n\r\nnational solidarity and national effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;46. In the field of economic production the\r\n\r\nGovernment  considers that employers  and  workers\r\n\r\nmust  recognise the need for co-operation in their\r\n\r\njoint  task of service to the national prosperity.\r\n\r\nEvery  effort of energy and patience will be  made\r\n\r\nby   the  Government  to  eliminate  wasteful  and\r\n\r\ndamaging   disputes  by  the  timely  removal   of\r\n\r\ngrievances and by the education of both management\r\n\r\nand labour in the processes of negotiation, in the\r\n\r\nmeans  of joint consultation, and in understanding\r\n\r\nof  the  importance of good human relations within\r\n\r\nindustry.  It  must  be realised  that  plans  for\r\n\r\nrelief  of  unemployment and for creation  of  new\r\n\r\nindustries   can  be  frustrated  by   unnecessary\r\n\r\nstoppages, which reduce production or even halt it\r\n\r\nforever,  thus throwing workers into the  miseries\r\n\r\nof unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;47. Detailed study of the report of the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation Commission is now far advanced  and\r\n\r\nwill  soon be completed. The Government will  then\r\n\r\npublish a programme for the phased replacement  of\r\n\r\nexpatriate  officers by Malayans.  This  programme\r\n\r\nwill  provide  for  rapid  Malayanisation  to   be\r\n\r\ncarried  out  without unreasonable  sacrifices  of\r\n\r\nefficiency  in the public administration  at  this\r\n\r\nvital\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime  in  Singapore's history. Simultaneously  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will introduce a scheme for  fair  and\r\n\r\nreasonable  compensation to  expatriate  officers.\r\n\r\nNegotiations  with the Staff Associations  are  in\r\n\r\nprogress. All expatriate officers will be informed\r\n\r\nof  their prospects for future service here and of\r\n\r\nthe   terms  on  which  their  services  will   be\r\n\r\nterminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48. A Public Services Commission with executive\r\n\r\npowers  will  be established as soon as  agreement\r\n\r\nhas been reached on a compensation scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49. It is clear that it will be some years before\r\n\r\nan  adequate supply of suitably qualified Malayans\r\n\r\nis  available to replace all expatriates and until\r\n\r\nthen  expatriates  will be  needed  especially  in\r\n\r\nprofessional    and   technical    posts.    Where\r\n\r\nappropriate   those  expatriate   officers   whose\r\n\r\nservices are needed for a further period  will  be\r\n\r\nguaranteed   consideration   for   promotion    in\r\n\r\naccordance with normal service principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50. The Government has been gravely concerned by\r\n\r\nthe  danger  to the public welfare from gangsters,\r\n\r\nfrom  secret  societies, from armed violence,  and\r\n\r\nfrom  corruption. It is determined to continue  to\r\n\r\ntake strong action to remove these threats and  to\r\n\r\nprotect all good citizens from anti-social forces.\r\n\r\nIn  that  task the Government appeals  confidently\r\n\r\nfor  the  co-operation and support of the  public,\r\n\r\nwhich   are  essential.  It  is  intended  to   do\r\n\r\neverything  possible to foster  moral  welfare  by\r\n\r\nencouragement of healthy youth activities  and  by\r\n\r\nensuring,  as  far  as may be, that  young  people\r\n\r\nreceive  proper moral teaching and  guidance.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  anxious that parents  should  give\r\n\r\nmore  care  to  watching over the  characters  and\r\n\r\noccupations   of  their  children.  A   thoroughly\r\n\r\nrevised Ordinance for the protection of women  and\r\n\r\ngirls will be introduced during 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51. As Singapore moves towards complete self-government and national status, the\r\n\r\nneed to maintain its own armed forces becomes more\r\n\r\nurgent.  Recruitment for the new Regular Battalion\r\n\r\nwill  open  shortly  and  it  is  hoped  that  all\r\n\r\nsections of the community will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot only support the new Battalion in principle but\r\n\r\nwill  also  come forward as Singapore  citizens  to\r\n\r\nenlist as regular soldiers of high civic quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;52. Aspirations of political freedom must be\r\n\r\naccompanied   by  genuine  national   efforts   for\r\n\r\neconomic  independence.  Whilst  Singapore,  as  an\r\n\r\ninternational  centre of trade, must always  retain\r\n\r\nclose  links with its trading neighbours, and  must\r\n\r\ngive scope for foreign capital, it is of the utmost\r\n\r\nimportance  that  the citizens of Singapore  should\r\n\r\nprovide as much as they possibly can of the capital\r\n\r\nneeded  for  national development. For  the  future\r\n\r\nevery  good citizen should recognise the need,  for\r\n\r\nhis  own  and  for the nation's prosperity,  to  be\r\n\r\neconomical  in  his  spending and  thrifty  in  his\r\n\r\nhabits  so  that  he can save in  order  to  invest\r\n\r\nwithin  Singapore. The Government is examining  the\r\n\r\nfeasibility   of  initiating  a  national   savings\r\n\r\nmovement.  In  this  way every  citizen  could,  in\r\n\r\ngreater  or  lesser  degree,  contribute   to   the\r\n\r\nnational prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53. Whilst the Government recognises that\r\n\r\nSingapore  lives  by  the free movement  of  trade,\r\n\r\nsteps  must and will be taken, as indicated briefly\r\n\r\nearlier in this Address, to encourage and build  up\r\n\r\nour  local production for home consumption and  for\r\n\r\nexport.  All citizens can, and should,  play  their\r\n\r\npart  in  the development of secondary industry  by\r\n\r\nconsuming goods produced on this island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54. The Government does not intend that the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of national solidarity should  in  any\r\n\r\nway   conflict  with  or  damage  the   traditional\r\n\r\ncultures  of  the different communities  living  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The education policy laid down  in  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  Cmd. No. 15 of 1956  will  ensure  to\r\n\r\nevery  child  the opportunity of education  in  the\r\n\r\nlanguage  of the parents' choice, together  with  a\r\n\r\nsecond   language   which  will   enable   him   to\r\n\r\ncommunicate  with  his fellows of  different  race.\r\n\r\nWhilst   Singapore's  trade  demands  an   adequate\r\n\r\nknowledge  of  English as a  world  language  by  a\r\n\r\nproportion of its citizens, there is no doubt  that\r\n\r\nunder  the  new education policy the languages  and\r\n\r\ncultures of the Malays, the Chinese and the Indians\r\n\r\nwill flourish as they have never\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndone  in  the  past.  It  cannot  be  too  strongly\r\n\r\nemphasized  that the Government is determined  that\r\n\r\nall  children  should  be given  equal  educational\r\n\r\nopportunity.  To  this end it is  preparing  a  new\r\n\r\nGrant  Code which will govern the payment  of  full\r\n\r\naid to different kinds of schools. Whether a school\r\n\r\nis to receive a grant or not will certainly depend,\r\n\r\nnot  on  the language of instruction of the school,\r\n\r\nbut  on  two over-riding conditions: that  its  aim\r\n\r\nshould  be to turn out children whose loyalty  will\r\n\r\nbe  to  this country and that the grant  should  be\r\n\r\nwisely used and accounted for properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55. The Government is aware of the need to provide\r\n\r\nfor  older  people  some of the  opportunities  for\r\n\r\neducation   they  were  denied  in   their   youth.\r\n\r\nExperience during the past years has shown the need\r\n\r\nfor   a  number  of  reforms  in  the  arrangements\r\n\r\npreviously  made for providing adult  education.  A\r\n\r\nnew constitution is being drafted for the Singapore\r\n\r\nCouncil for Adult Education which it is hoped  will\r\n\r\nmake these reforms effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56. As a factor of encouragement for all cultures,\r\n\r\nthe Government is considering a proposal to set  up\r\n\r\na  Department of Fine Arts and Cultural  Relations,\r\n\r\nwhich    will   without   discrimination    provide\r\n\r\nfacilities  and  encouragement  for  the  different\r\n\r\ncultures  of  Singapore  and  which  will  make  it\r\n\r\npossible  to  fertilise  them  through  visits  and\r\n\r\nexchanges with the cultures of other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57. The Government considers that an important\r\n\r\ncontribution  to national solidarity  can  be  made\r\n\r\nthrough  widening the understanding of  the  people\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to  the structure  and  work  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and its Public Services, and  will  seek\r\n\r\nto   give  this  understanding  of  the  democratic\r\n\r\nprocess by providing a scheme of civics courses for\r\n\r\nrepresentative groups from all parts of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58. The Government is aware that the hysterical,\r\n\r\nunreasonable  and  often  criminal  activities   of\r\n\r\nundercover Communists are harmful to national unity\r\n\r\nand   national   prosperity.  Whilst   willing   to\r\n\r\nfacilitate in every way the retirement to Communist\r\n\r\ncountries  of those who favour a Communist  way  of\r\n\r\nlife, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  asks those who call this country  their\r\n\r\nhome to give sincere loyalty to the free democratic\r\n\r\nMalayan way of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59. Whilst the business of Government proceeds\r\n\r\nfrom  day  to day and from year to year,  it  ought\r\n\r\nalso to be planned with proper thought for the long-term  future and for this purpose planning must  be\r\n\r\nbased   on  sound  economic  surveys  and  economic\r\n\r\nadvice.  The  Government will seek  to  expand  and\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the office of the Economic  Adviser  in\r\n\r\norder that no factor should be overlooked which can\r\n\r\ncontribute to the future welfare of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60. The first elected Government recognised that\r\n\r\nthe  welfare of the people of Singapore could  best\r\n\r\nbe  served  by  the  early attainment  of  complete\r\n\r\ninternal   self-government  and  union   with   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya and accordingly directed  its\r\n\r\nefforts to achieving these ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61. The setback sustained by an All-Party mission,\r\n\r\ncomprised  of Members of this Assembly, which  went\r\n\r\nto  London earlier this year to seek constitutional\r\n\r\nadvancement, while dealing a grievous blow  to  the\r\n\r\naspirations of the people of Singapore, is regarded\r\n\r\nby   this   Government  as  being  temporary.   The\r\n\r\nresources  and the energies of the Government  will\r\n\r\nbe   applied   to  ensure  that  these   legitimate\r\n\r\naspirations  are attained in the very near  future.\r\n\r\nIn  this the Government is confident of the support\r\n\r\nof all Parties represented in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62. Although the goal of union with the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya is still not in sight, the links already\r\n\r\nforged   are  being  strengthened  to   make   both\r\n\r\nterritories   indivisible.  The   Government   will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to foster and strengthen these  links  so\r\n\r\nthat  ultimately  the narrow gap will  be  bridged,\r\n\r\nbringing  about  the fusion of the two  territories\r\n\r\ninto  a  single, united nation. We look forward  to\r\n\r\nthis Greater Malaya taking its rightful place among\r\n\r\nthe  Comity  of Nations. With God's help  it  shall\r\n\r\ngrow  in stature and prosperity and advance in full\r\n\r\nglory into that era of Universal Peace destined for\r\n\r\nMan-kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the Governor's Address, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  preceded  by the Serjeant  at  Arms,  the\r\n\r\nClerk   Assistant  and  the  Clerk,  escorted   His\r\n\r\nExcellency out of the Chamber, and the sitting  was\r\n\r\nsuspended until twelve noon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Twelve noon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assembly resumed its sitting with Mr Speaker in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MESSAGES FROM THE GOVERNOR</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Governor's Assent to Bills passed)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.
