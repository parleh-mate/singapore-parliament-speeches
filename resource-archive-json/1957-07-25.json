It  has now become clear that  a  further\r\n\r\nextension will be necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might explain that early this year we had\r\n\r\nreached  a  point  at which the signing  of  a  new\r\n\r\nagreement  and  the  holding of  a  debate  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly in connection therewith appeared imminent.\r\n\r\nSince  then, however, a situation has arisen  which\r\n\r\nhas  made it necessary to review the action already\r\n\r\ntaken  and  to study new factors, and new proposals\r\n\r\nmade  thereon,  which  affect  the  new  agreement.\r\n\r\nNegotiations are still proceeding in the  light  of\r\n\r\nthese  new  proposals. For this  reason,  and  also\r\n\r\nbecause  the  matter involves five  Governments  as\r\n\r\nwell  as the airline operators, I am unable  to  go\r\n\r\ninto detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can, however, properly say that the new factors\r\n\r\nand the new proposals to which I have referred have\r\n\r\nraised  issues of sufficient importance to  warrant\r\n\r\nthe  holding  of personal discussions  between  the\r\n\r\nfive  Governments and the airline  operators  at  a\r\n\r\nhigh  level,  and hon. Members will doubtless  have\r\n\r\nread  in  the local Press that these took place  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  on  15th and 16th July. They  have  been\r\n\r\nadjourned till about 9th or 10th August. If by that\r\n\r\ndate   the   negotiations   can   be   successfully\r\n\r\ncompleted - and I most sincerely hope that they  will\r\n\r\nbe - certain  other action will remain  to  be  taken\r\n\r\nboth by the Government and by the airline operators\r\n\r\nin   connection  with  the  structure  of  the  new\r\n\r\ncompany.  It  is  generally agreed that  the  whole\r\n\r\noperation  will  require a further three-and-a-half\r\n\r\nor  four  months to complete. Action  is  therefore\r\n\r\nbeing  taken to extend the present agreement for  a\r\n\r\nyet further period up to 30th November, 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the House that we are pressing on\r\n\r\nwith the utmost urgency and as soon as possible the\r\n\r\nHouse  will have an opportunity of debating matters\r\n\r\nconnected  with  the  new agreement  before  it  is\r\n\r\nsigned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Recommittal read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>Committee</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.07 a.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1-\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nChairman, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 13, line 5, to leave out \"1956\" and\r\n\r\ninsert \"1957\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This is a correction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

The original\r\n\r\nclause  as it stands states quite clearly  that  as\r\n\r\nfar  as  the  boundaries of electoral divisions  in\r\n\r\nlocal  government areas are concerned the  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  complete and unfettered authority to fix  them\r\n\r\nas he thinks fit, and subsequently to alter them as\r\n\r\nhe thinks fit. The clause as it stands at the moment\r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Minister may, from time to time, by\r\n\r\nnotification published in the Gazette  specify  the\r\n\r\nnames and boundaries of the electoral divisions  of\r\n\r\nany local government area for purposes of elections\r\n\r\nunder this Ordinance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the first part of our amendment is exactly\r\n\r\nparallel to the proviso to clauses 5 and 15 of  the\r\n\r\nLocal  Government Bill in respect of the limits  of\r\n\r\nthe  City  and  District  Council  boundaries.   It\r\n\r\nrequires  that  when any alterations  are  made  in\r\n\r\nfuture   to   the  electoral  division  boundaries,\r\n\r\nnotification must be made in the Gazette  for  four\r\n\r\nconsecutive  weeks and in newspapers  in  the  four\r\n\r\nmain languages. In countering our arguments on this\r\n\r\npoint  last week, the Hon. the Chief Secretary  was\r\n\r\nnot  in  his  most  thoughtful frame  of  mind.  He\r\n\r\nsaid - and  I hope I do not misrepresent him  in  his\r\n\r\nabsence - that  this  matter was not  raised  in  the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee as being one of importance and why\r\n\r\ntherefore  should it be raised now? The  answer  is\r\n\r\nsimple. We had formed the impression that as an All-Party  Committee  was to be  set  up  to  work  out\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly electoral boundaries, the same\r\n\r\nprinciple would be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplied  by  the  Government in  respect  of  local\r\n\r\ngovernment boundaries. As we are now faced  with  a\r\n\r\nvirtual fait accompli by the strict application  of\r\n\r\nthis clause 8, it is only right and proper that  at\r\n\r\nthis  stage  we  should move an amendment  to  draw\r\n\r\nattention  to,  and  if possible  prevent,  a  fait\r\n\r\naccompli.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the whole point of recommitting clauses\r\n\r\nor  whole Bills to a Committee of this Assembly  is\r\n\r\nthat  there should be second thoughts on  important\r\n\r\nlegislation.  The  Hon. the  Minister   is   still\r\n\r\nbringing   in   fresh  amendments  to   the   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment Bill, matters which have been overlooked\r\n\r\nor left out. Is he to be criticised for introducing\r\n\r\namendments  at the eleventh hour? Or is  he  to  be\r\n\r\ncommended  for noticing them in time? We  have  had\r\n\r\nsecond  thoughts on this particular clause,  as  we\r\n\r\nare  entitled  to  have them,  and  we  find  these\r\n\r\namendments to be most vital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Secretary went on to say that\r\n\r\nelectoral division boundaries were not important to\r\n\r\nthe man-in-the-street and that so long as he got  a\r\n\r\nvote he did not mind where he voted. I am surprised\r\n\r\nat  my  Hon.  Friend  taking such  a  light-hearted\r\n\r\nattitude  in this matter which strikes at the  root\r\n\r\nof all democratic principles. Political Parties and\r\n\r\nIndependent   Members  and  individual  responsible\r\n\r\ncitizens  and  the  Press are  there  to  see  that\r\n\r\nelectoral division boundaries are delineated  on  a\r\n\r\ncompletely impartial basis, and they represent  the\r\n\r\nman-in-the-street  who may not  always  himself  be\r\n\r\narticulate.  In  the United Kingdom an  independent\r\n\r\ncommission  was set up four or five  years  ago  to\r\n\r\ndelineate  new constituencies required by  shifting\r\n\r\npopulations  and the growth of new  towns  for  the\r\n\r\nlast  general elections in that country.  This  was\r\n\r\ndone  so that neither Conservatives nor Labour  nor\r\n\r\nLiberal  could  say  that the boundaries  had  been\r\n\r\nrigged. When the Hon. the Chief Secretary tried  to\r\n\r\nmake  light  of the whole problem we on  this  side\r\n\r\nhave  been  forced  to  the  conclusion  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has a guilty conscience in this  matter.\r\n\r\nThe louder they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncry, \"We never even thought of fixing the\r\n\r\nboundaries to suit our political convenience!\", the\r\n\r\nless convincing their protestations are. That may\r\n\r\nbe unfortunate but it is inevitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said last week, if the Government does not\r\n\r\naccept the principle that the delineation of\r\n\r\nelectoral divisions should be subject to public\r\n\r\nscrutiny and objections if necessary, then it lays\r\n\r\nitself open to the charge of political manipulation\r\n\r\neven if it is innocent, and that goes for any other\r\n\r\ngovernment of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go back to the first proviso in which lies\r\n\r\nthe  principle that alterations in future  must  be\r\n\r\ngazetted  and  advertised in  four  languages.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment,  if  it  is  wise,  will  accept   this\r\n\r\nprinciple  with no difficulty whatever  because  it\r\n\r\naffects the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second and third provisos follow from the\r\n\r\nfirst. If the principle is accepted then it follows\r\n\r\nthat   it  must  be  applied  in  respect  of   the\r\n\r\nalterations  which are now being  made,  which  are\r\n\r\nmost   extensive  because  this  great  new   local\r\n\r\ngovernment  machinery is coming into operation  for\r\n\r\nthe  first  time. A huge new electorate of  largely\r\n\r\nnon-English-speaking  people  is  now  to  be  made\r\n\r\ninterested  in playing its part in local government\r\n\r\nadministration through its elected representatives.\r\n\r\nThe present six wards of the City Council are to be\r\n\r\nchanged to at least 32. The District Council  areas\r\n\r\nare  to  have between them eventually at  least  48\r\n\r\ndivisions  or  wards.  Are these  great  democratic\r\n\r\nchanges   to  be  thrust  on  the  people   in   an\r\n\r\nundemocratic way, or are the people to  be  invited\r\n\r\nto  comment on these changes through their Chinese,\r\n\r\nTamil, Malay or English newspapers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must begin, as we mean to go on, following\r\n\r\nproper principles. Government must not only be\r\n\r\ndemocratic but to be seen to be democratic. Now the\r\n\r\nGovernment, if it accepts the principle in the\r\n\r\nfirst proviso, need have no difficulty whatever in\r\n\r\naccepting the third proviso in respect of the\r\n\r\nDistrict Councils because, as the Minister has told\r\n\r\nus, these elections cannot be held until\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 1958 and therefore there is plenty of time to\r\n\r\npublish the boundaries and call for objections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only doubt arising is the second proviso and\r\n\r\nwhether  gazetting  and  advertising  the  proposed\r\n\r\nboundaries of the City Council for objections  will\r\n\r\nhave  caused the holding of elections to be delayed\r\n\r\nbeyond  December this year. There are, Sir, several\r\n\r\nanswers to this. Firstly, the Government must never\r\n\r\nward   off   or   ignore  criticism,  or   threaten\r\n\r\npostponement  of  elections as  a  reason  for  not\r\n\r\naccepting amendments. If the amendments are  sound,\r\n\r\nbut may cause delay, then delay must be accepted by\r\n\r\nall  parties  or  a  way found  round  that  delay.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the Hon. the Chief Secretary himself said\r\n\r\nthat minor changes could still be made. If that  is\r\n\r\nso,  the public have a right to express their views\r\n\r\nas to these changes. Thirdly, changes in boundaries\r\n\r\ndo  not affect the compiling of the list of voters,\r\n\r\nwhich is the biggest task. The electorate itself is\r\n\r\nthe  primary compilation; fitting them  within  the\r\n\r\nboundaries   is   secondary.   Fourthly,   if   the\r\n\r\nGovernment feels that gazetting and advertising  in\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers  for four consecutive  weeks  would\r\n\r\nseverely   upset  its  programme  of   a   December\r\n\r\nelection,  we on this side would be quite  prepared\r\n\r\nto  accept an amendment to this particular  proviso\r\n\r\nto the effect that the boundaries be gazetted, say,\r\n\r\ntwice  and advertised four times within two  weeks,\r\n\r\nwith a further week for objections to be sent in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of a time-table would this mean?\r\n\r\nGazetting  on  Saturday, 3rd  August  to  the  10th\r\n\r\nAugust,  and the last day for objections  say  17th\r\n\r\nAugust.  This will not only give time to  the  All-Party  Committee to study the boundaries  but  give\r\n\r\nIndependents and individuals the chance to  express\r\n\r\ntheir   views.  We  have  no  doubt  that  if   the\r\n\r\nGovernment wants to do this it can do it and  still\r\n\r\nhold December elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, if we want to have clean elections we must start off in a clean way, with no\r\n\r\nsuggestions  or  implications of Government  having\r\n\r\nmanipulated   the  divisions  to   suit   its   own\r\n\r\ninterests.  If  the Government refuses  to  accept\r\n\r\nthis   amendment   suspicions   will   be   aroused\r\n\r\ninevitably, and corruption - which we all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprofess to want to see removed - will not be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Chairman, I have an\r\n\r\namendment to make to the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment to the Amendment handed in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Government agrees  in  principle\r\n\r\nwith  the  first proviso given in the amendment  by\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member  for Tanglin. There  are  similar\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  clauses  5  and  15  of  the  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment  Bill. It is not agreed,  however,  that\r\n\r\nthe  present  procedure envisaged should  apply  in\r\n\r\nrespect of the first ordinary elections under  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  That is why I am moving this amendment.\r\n\r\nAt  this stage if boundaries are to be altered, all\r\n\r\nthe work which has been done in the preparation  of\r\n\r\nregisters  for  electoral  divisions  showing   the\r\n\r\npolling  districts will have been  wasted  and  the\r\n\r\nregisters will have to be scrapped. As it is,  Sir,\r\n\r\nmore  than half of the registers have been  printed\r\n\r\nby  the Printing Office. Elections would have to be\r\n\r\npostponed several months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last sitting of the Assembly the Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief  Secretary explained that the boundaries  for\r\n\r\nCity  electoral  divisions had  been  drawn  up  by\r\n\r\nofficials without any direction. In spite  of  what\r\n\r\nthe  hon. Member for Tanglin has just said, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nrepeat once again that that is so.

But once  you\r\n\r\nhave accepted that principle you must apply it from\r\n\r\nthe start. Take the second part of the amendment to\r\n\r\nthe amendment - I see no reason whatever in the first\r\n\r\nplace why this principle should not be accepted  in\r\n\r\nrespect of the District Councils. I mentioned  that\r\n\r\na  few moments ago. You have much more time in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  the  District Councils. Therefore  having\r\n\r\naccepted  the  principle  in  the  first  instance,\r\n\r\naccept  it  without hesitation in  respect  of  the\r\n\r\nDistrict Councils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We then come to the problem - we admit it is a\r\n\r\nproblem - of  the  City  Council  electoral  division\r\n\r\nboundaries  and the need to hold the  elections  as\r\n\r\nsoon  as  possible.  In  this  regard  it  must  be\r\n\r\nremembered, as the Hon. the Minister has just said,\r\n\r\nthat  the Report of the Committee which has  worked\r\n\r\nout  the  delineation of these boundaries has  only\r\n\r\nbeen  placed  in the hands of Members this  morning\r\n\r\nand  I  presume supplied to the Press this morning.\r\n\r\nWhy could this not have been done before? Why could\r\n\r\nnot  some  machinery, say the All-Party  Committee,\r\n\r\nhave  been  put  into operation to  consider  these\r\n\r\nboundaries  at  least two or three  weeks  ago?  It\r\n\r\nwould  have  been quite possible to do  this.  Then\r\n\r\npossibly there would have been no need to move this\r\n\r\npart  of  the  amendment, as I call it  the  second\r\n\r\nproviso.  We would have accepted the fact that  the\r\n\r\npublic and the All-Party Committee were being given\r\n\r\na chance to consider these new boundaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no, we are faced with this Report today, on\r\n\r\nthe  very  day  in  which we have  to  debate  this\r\n\r\nimportant question. It could have been given to  us\r\n\r\nearlier.  I  do not know why it was not.  Will  the\r\n\r\nHon. the   Minister  therefore  not  accept   our\r\n\r\nsuggestion that if he cannot agree to four weeks of\r\n\r\ngazetting  and  advertising in  the  newspapers  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of changes in the City Council boundaries,\r\n\r\nhe  will  agree to reducing the length of  time  of\r\n\r\ngazetting in order that this important principle is\r\n\r\naccepted,  which  in fact Government  has  accepted\r\n\r\nthrough accepting my first proviso?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart (Acting Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Chief Secretary (Mr S. T. Stewart):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, in support of my friend and\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the  Minister for Local  Government,  I\r\n\r\nhave  to  say  that  the  Statistics  and  Printing\r\n\r\nDepartments   are  well  on  with   preparing   the\r\n\r\nelectoral  rolls  for  the City  Council  elections\r\n\r\nbased  on the City Council boundaries specified  in\r\n\r\nthe  Local  Government Bill and  on  the  electoral\r\n\r\ndivisions  drawn up by the official Committee.  Any\r\n\r\nchange  in the boundaries must of course delay  the\r\n\r\nfinal certification of the electoral registers, and\r\n\r\nif  the  changes are major ones the effect will  be\r\n\r\nmore  serious.  For  example,  Sir,  if  Katong  is\r\n\r\nrestored to the City it will materially affect  the\r\n\r\ntotal number of voters in the City Council area  as\r\n\r\nit  contains  a large number of voters - I  remember,\r\n\r\nSir, roughly well over 25,000 voters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The electoral divisions have been based on the\r\n\r\nassumption  that there will be a total  of  505,000\r\n\r\nnames  on the rolls altogether and the 32 divisions\r\n\r\nhave been designed to divide this number as equally\r\n\r\nas  possible.  If the total number is increased  it\r\n\r\nwill probably be that all 32 divisions will have to\r\n\r\nbe  revised. If divisions adjoining the boundary of\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council  are altered there  will  almost\r\n\r\ncertainly be repercussions throughout. Even a minor\r\n\r\nchange  of  two  electoral  divisions - let  us   say\r\n\r\nCairnhill   and   its  Western   neighbour,   River\r\n\r\nValley - must cause some delay, and the length of the\r\n\r\ndelay  will depend on the number of alterations  to\r\n\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the first proviso given in the amendment of\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tanglin is made applicable  to  the\r\n\r\nCity  and District Council electoral divisions,  as\r\n\r\nsuggested in the second and third provisos  of  the\r\n\r\namendment,  it will initially mean a  delay  of  at\r\n\r\nleast  four  to five weeks. If you read  the  first\r\n\r\namendment, Sir, there will be an initial  delay  of\r\n\r\nfour  weeks and if the Minister is to consider  the\r\n\r\nrepresentations made it may mean another  delay  of\r\n\r\none week or perhaps even more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, if any major change takes place, it will\r\n\r\ninvolve  a  further delay of three or four  months,\r\n\r\nfor the following reasons: (1) We have to rearrange\r\n\r\nthe cards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto new divisions and this will require, according\r\n\r\nto  those who have to carry out this work, about 10\r\n\r\nweeks;  (2)  to  reproduce, collate  and  bind  the\r\n\r\nregisters  will  require  another  ten  weeks;  (3)\r\n\r\nassuming that a large part of these two territories\r\n\r\noverlap,  at least 15 to 17 weeks will be required.\r\r\n\r\nIf  Katong is put back into the City and the  rural\r\n\r\narea  included in the Western part of the City area\r\n\r\nis taken out again, the recasting of the boundaries\r\n\r\nof  all  District  Council areas will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nundertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague said in this Assembly - I think\r\n\r\nit was at the April or May sitting, Sir - that it was\r\n\r\nintended  to  hold  District Council  elections  in\r\n\r\nMarch  1958 if City Council elections are  held  in\r\n\r\nDecember  1957. One of the reasons,  Sir,  is  that\r\n\r\nthere  cannot be simultaneous preparation of  every\r\n\r\nphase  in  the drawing up of new District and  City\r\n\r\nCouncil registers because the sorting machines  and\r\n\r\nso  forth  can only be concentrated on one  set  of\r\n\r\nregisters  at  a  time.  Therefore,  Sir,  if  City\r\n\r\nCouncil elections have to be postponed to April/May\r\n\r\n1958  then District Council elections will have  to\r\n\r\nbe postponed to June/July, or even August, 1958.  I\r\n\r\ndo not know whether we want that. I do not think we\r\n\r\nwant  that,  Sir. I think the people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwant  to see the new City and District Councils  in\r\n\r\nbeing as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot afford any delay if elections are to be\r\n\r\nheld  in December. Since the electoral rolls should\r\n\r\nbe  published by the latter half of August in order\r\n\r\nto  hold elections in December, the tentative time-table to which Government is working, based on  the\r\n\r\nperiods allowed for in the Bill, is as follows: (1)\r\n\r\nlisting,    printing,   collating,   binding    and\r\n\r\npublication  of draft registers to be completed  by\r\n\r\n20th  August,  1957; (2) allowing  for  claims  and\r\n\r\nobjections to be completed from 21st August to 18th\r\n\r\nSeptember,   1957;  adjudication  of   claims   and\r\n\r\nobjections   to  be  completed  by  19th   October;\r\n\r\nlisting,  printing,  collating  and  insertion   of\r\n\r\namendments for claims and objections in  the  draft\r\n\r\nregisters  and certification of final registers  by\r\n\r\n31st October. Thus a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwrit  of elections can be issued any time from  1st\r\n\r\nNovember, 1957 onwards and if it is found  possible\r\n\r\nto  publish draft registers before 20th  August  so\r\n\r\nmuch the better, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the reasons which I have given, I oppose\r\n\r\nthe  second and third provisos of the hon. Member's\r\n\r\namendment.  We want to try and hold to  this  time-table. We want to have these City Council elections\r\n\r\nin  December and the District Council elections  in\r\n\r\nMarch. I repeat again, Sir: the public of Singapore\r\n\r\nwant these new Councils. For those reasons, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nsupport the amendment moved by my hon. colleague.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nSir,  the last speaker has only one point to  offer\r\n\r\nand  that is, \"We do not want to delay City Council\r\n\r\nelections.\"  But  let me ask this House,  Sir,  how\r\n\r\nlong  has  Government  delayed  them?  Has  it  not\r\n\r\ndelayed them for at least one year? Did we not hear\r\n\r\nin  this  Assembly last year that it was  going  to\r\n\r\npostpone  the  City Council elections?  I  remember\r\n\r\nwhen  the  new Government took office  it  said  it\r\n\r\nwanted  to hold elections at a very early date  but\r\n\r\nthere have since been two postponements. I think  I\r\n\r\nam  right;  there have two postponements  of  these\r\n\r\nelections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the Government been doing during these\r\n\r\ntwo  years? I would like very much to know. Has  it\r\n\r\nbeen working on the matter? Has it been trying hard\r\n\r\nto make early elections possible? It is always good\r\n\r\nto  say  that people want early elections. We  want\r\n\r\nthem  early  too, but it is a very different  thing\r\n\r\nnot  to  put it into practice. There was plenty  of\r\n\r\ntime  on  the hands of Government in the  last  two\r\n\r\nyears  and  more, yet today we are confronted  with\r\n\r\nthe  reason,  \"We  do not want delays.\"  Government\r\n\r\ncould  have  made  them  earlier  but  it  has  not\r\n\r\nattempted to make it earlier. [Interruption].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Another little point that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  put  up  is, \"We  have  had  everything\r\n\r\nprinted.  Delay will cost money; it  will  delay  a\r\n\r\ngreat deal more.\" I have already said\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat these delays could have been averted if it had\r\n\r\nstarted earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another one more point to consider. It\r\n\r\nwould  be better to have an election which is  said\r\n\r\nby  all to be fair, to be democratic, than to  have\r\n\r\none thrust down your throat just because Government\r\n\r\nsays,  \"We cannot delay.\" Now that is like tempting\r\n\r\nyou  by  saying, \"If you want it this way you  must\r\n\r\nhave  it  my way. If you want to have elections  in\r\n\r\nDecember then you must carry out elections  on  the\r\n\r\nlines  we propose. If you do not carry out  on  the\r\n\r\nlines  we  propose then there will be no elections,\r\n\r\nand if there is going to be delay the blame will be\r\n\r\non   you.\"  That  is  absolutely  unfair.  That  is\r\n\r\nabsolutely undemocratic. That amounts to  coercion,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now how much will it cost the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to change a little bit of this printing?\r\n\r\nCost   and   labour  should  not  be   taken   into\r\n\r\nconsideration. The more important consideration  is\r\n\r\nwhether  it is democratic, whether it is viewed  by\r\n\r\nall  to  be  fair. Since the Government,  Sir,  has\r\n\r\naccepted the first proviso, I see no reason why the\r\n\r\nthird proviso should not have been accepted. People\r\n\r\nliving  in  the City are important. They  can  have\r\n\r\nobjections. They must be notified of changes. But I\r\n\r\npersonally  feel that people living  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas  are  also  as important,  and  that  if  one\r\n\r\nmeasure is given to the City people then it  should\r\n\r\nalso be given to people in the Districts. This will\r\n\r\nnot  be  done  if the amendment of the Minister  is\r\n\r\naccepted  to  strike  off  the  second  and   third\r\n\r\nprovisos,  the  reason  for  opposing  the   second\r\n\r\nproviso  being  that  if  you  are  going  to  have\r\n\r\nalterations now to your City Council divisions  you\r\n\r\nwill not be able to have elections in December. Let\r\n\r\nme  quote,  Sir, from a note which I received  this\r\n\r\nmorning  about the electoral divisions in the  City\r\n\r\nproposed by the Government Committee. I happen also\r\n\r\nto  have  a  copy  of the Constituency  Delineation\r\n\r\nCommission of the Federation of Malaya, and I shall\r\n\r\nalso quote one or two extracts from that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.45 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Report of the Committee to delimit the\r\n\r\nElectoral  Divisions  of  the  City  and   District\r\n\r\nCouncils, I would like\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto read from Annex B, paragraph 1 (a). Under the\r\n\r\nheading, \"Densely populated Divisions with\r\n\r\nunusually high voter strength\", the reason is given\r\n\r\nas:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The ratio of voter strengths to population is\r\n\r\nhigh in all these areas and is due in some cases to\r\n\r\nthe fact that many suburban and rural dwellers have\r\n\r\nregistered their addresses in these divisions...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  seems then, Sir, that the system is very faulty\r\n\r\nand  the  Committee which deliberated on  this  and\r\n\r\nused  the existing facilities would be led to wrong\r\n\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 3 of the statement shown under the\r\n\r\nheading, \"23.

Sir, when a  check\r\n\r\nis made on the number of people living in a certain\r\n\r\narea,  you  find that there are 3,260 people;  your\r\n\r\nelectoral roll, however, shows that there are 4,062\r\n\r\npeople  in  that  area. There must then  have  been\r\n\r\nghosts  in the area! Let us call them ghost voters!\r\n\r\nThey  do  not live there; they live elsewhere,  but\r\n\r\ninvariably they turn up for voting. Now this  is  a\r\n\r\nterribly   bad   system,  Sir,  of  compiling   our\r\n\r\nelectoral  rolls. You put it to any man and  if  he\r\n\r\ncan say that it is logical to have 4,000 odd voters\r\n\r\nwhen  there are only 3,000 odd people living there,\r\n\r\nthen  something must be wrong. I would like to draw\r\n\r\nyour  attention further, Sir, to the fact that  the\r\n\r\n3,000  odd  people  are  men,  women  and  children\r\n\r\ncombined, whereas the 4,000 odd voters are all over\r\n\r\n21.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Furthermore, Sir,  if  no\r\n\r\nobjection  is to be allowed in this first election,\r\n\r\nthen  we will be going against the principle agreed\r\n\r\nto  by  all  and also adopted by the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya, that,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"in view of the very great distances involved in\r\n\r\nsome  of the more sparsely settled portions of  the\r\n\r\ncountry,  it  would not be regarded as unreasonable\r\n\r\nif  in some instances a rural constituency were  to\r\n\r\ncontain as little as half of the inhabitants in the\r\n\r\nmore  popular urban constituencies returning single\r\n\r\nmembers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Again on this point, Sir, you will find if you look\r\n\r\nat  the  recommendations which  the  Government  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  gazette and push through to the  people,\r\n\r\nthe  population  of areas in more  rural  districts\r\n\r\nlike Tanglin-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J.

The number of electors\r\n\r\nwould  be  18,695  for  Tanglin  which  is  a   big\r\n\r\nsprawling  area,  whereas we have a  small  compact\r\n\r\narea  like Kreta Ayer with 16,954.

There again, Sir, I  find\r\n\r\nthat  the Committee has not been carrying  out  its\r\n\r\nwork  on the principles agreed.

I certainly feel\r\n\r\nthat a little time to look into the whole matter so\r\n\r\nthat  everybody will be satisfied, will go  a  long\r\n\r\nway to make the people of Singapore realise that we\r\n\r\nare  now  an elected Government and not a  colonial\r\n\r\none  which  is going to ram everything  down  their\r\n\r\nthroat whether they like it or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Sir, we all agree\r\n\r\nwith  the  Hon. the Chief Secretary  that  we  want\r\n\r\nelections in December, but we do not agree with the\r\n\r\nprice  that we are paying today. We do not want  to\r\n\r\nbe  faced  with a fait accompli, with  a  statement\r\n\r\nthat  you  cannot change anything now, cannot  make\r\n\r\nany  amendments in this Assembly, because  half  of\r\n\r\nthe lists have been printed and the delineation has\r\n\r\nbeen completed.

I would like to\r\n\r\nknow  how long Government had this document in  its\r\n\r\nhands and why should it be given to us now when  we\r\n\r\nhave  no  time  to study, when we have  to  hold  a\r\n\r\ndebate and still read this Report? Is it fair to us\r\n\r\nthat this document should be given to us now?

As it is, Sir, I support the hon.

The life of the present City Council has\r\n\r\nbeen  extended on two or three occasions; what harm\r\n\r\nwill  it do to have a further delay of one  or  two\r\n\r\nmonths  if it is in the interests of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore? Every year the Government puts it to the\r\n\r\nAssembly  that we must extend the life of the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  because  we are not yet prepared  to  hold\r\n\r\nelections. Then all of a sudden, as the Member  for\r\n\r\nPaya Lebar has said, this Report is pushed on to us\r\n\r\nto  accept,  without giving us  a  chance  of  even\r\n\r\nglancing at it, not to say of study. Are we  rubber\r\n\r\nstamps  that we must accept whatever the Government\r\n\r\npushes on to us? If we are to be rubber stamps  why\r\n\r\nbring  all  of  us here?

But we come today  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse and, as the Member for Paya Lebar said, while\r\n\r\nwe  are going through the debate it is pushed  down\r\n\r\nour  throat. Should there be any change, the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary  said, there will have to be  alterations\r\n\r\nto all the divisions; and printing of the registers\r\n\r\nhas  already  begun. Why should they  be  put  into\r\n\r\nprint  before the Government come and tell us  what\r\n\r\nit  has  done?  Why  should it  unnecessarily  give\r\n\r\norders  and instructions to have them printed?  Was\r\n\r\nGovernment  certain  that  this  Report  would   be\r\n\r\naccepted or must be accepted? It should have let us\r\n\r\nhave  this  Report  earlier  for  discussion,   for\r\n\r\ndebate, so that we would know where we stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the Report as it is tabled today I find\r\n\r\nlittle  can  be made out of it. What  is  there  in\r\n\r\nfigures   only?   Where  are  the  boundaries?   In\r\n\r\nsubmitting  this Report, could not  the  Government\r\n\r\ngive  the  boundaries of each division so  that  we\r\n\r\ncould go further into the matter? Only figures  and\r\n\r\nmore figures are quoted. What can figures show  us?\r\n\r\nNothing;  they  bring  us  nowhere.

We\r\n\r\npointed  out  at that sitting that this delineation\r\n\r\nwas  carried out by an official Committee,  and  to\r\n\r\nprove  that it was so we tendered a Report to  each\r\n\r\nMember  of  the  Assembly so that they  could  have\r\n\r\nsomething in their hands to prove at a later  stage\r\n\r\nthat  what  the  Government  proposed  to  do  were\r\n\r\nrecommended  in  the  Report.  This  Committee  was\r\n\r\nappoined in June, only last month, because at  that\r\n\r\ntime the Select Committee was still considering the\r\n\r\nLocal  Government  Bill. Therefore  any  suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  we  are ramming this down the throat  of  any\r\n\r\nMember  of  the  Opposition or the public  is  most\r\n\r\nunfair.  We  put this Report in the  possession  of\r\n\r\nhon.  Members so that they can have evidence  at  a\r\n\r\nlater  stage. When the Minister announces in  the\r\n\r\nGazette that the City Council area shall be divided\r\n\r\ninto such and such electoral divisions, it can then\r\n\r\nbe  seen  by all Members of the Opposition and  the\r\n\r\npublic that what the Minister proposes to do is  as\r\n\r\nstated in this Report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Including ghost voters!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

How will that give a chance to\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore to express their views? The\r\n\r\nall-Party Committee - three or four members - will  sit\r\n\r\ndown  and  demarcate the boundaries; but this  will\r\n\r\nstill not give the people of Singapore a chance  to\r\n\r\nexpress  their views or to make objections  to  the\r\n\r\nproposed boundaries, as proposed by the hon.

Sir, probably the\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Liberal-Socialist Party  could  not\r\n\r\nmake  up their minds amongst themselves as to  what\r\n\r\nit  should  be.

He even went so far as to\r\n\r\naccuse the civil servants (incidentally one of  the\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the delimitation Committee  is  not  a\r\n\r\ncivil  servant) that they had worked to a directive\r\n\r\nof  the Government and had been biased, and  so  on\r\n\r\nand  so  forth. Sir, that is why today the Minister\r\n\r\nhas  handed over to hon. Members this Report of the\r\n\r\nCommittee   appointed  to  delimit  the   electoral\r\n\r\ndivisions, to prove that these accusations  against\r\n\r\nthe  Government  are  without  foundation.  And  if\r\n\r\nanybody  reads this Report he will find in  certain\r\n\r\nparagraphs  the basis on which this  Committee  has\r\n\r\nmade  its recommendations. I will just read  a  few\r\n\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In reaching its recommendation for these\r\n\r\nboundaries,  as shown on the attached map,  it  has\r\n\r\nemployed the following basic considerations:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The desirability of striking a proper balance\r\n\r\nbetween  the  population and the voter strength  in\r\n\r\neach division...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Feature boundaries such as roads and rivers,\r\n\r\ninstead  of arbitrary boundaries, have been adopted\r\n\r\nin all cases...[with certain few exceptions].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Account has been taken throughout of\r\n\r\ncommunity interests and affinities, for example, at\r\n\r\nQueenstown, Bukit Merah, Tiong Bahru, etc...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now these were the principles on which the\r\n\r\nCommittee  delineated the boundaries and based  its\r\n\r\nReport  and recommendations. There is no indication\r\n\r\nin the Report that the Committee had a directive to\r\n\r\nfix the boundaries according to what would suit the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front Coalition Government. The Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Committee, Sir, who signed the Report are  the\r\n\r\nChief   Statistician,  Mr  E.  J.  Phillips;   the\r\n\r\nPlanning Adviser, Singapore Improvement Trust,  Mr\r\n\r\nD.    H.    Komlosy;    the    Survey    Department\r\n\r\nrepresentative,  Mr  M.  George;  and  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nSecretary, Ministry of Local Government, Lands  and\r\n\r\nHousing, Mr P. H. Meadows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Sir, the hon. Member sitting next to\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member  for Tanjong Pagar  has  probably\r\n\r\ntried a little to borrow his powers of oratory  and\r\n\r\nwas trying to simulate his example, but there is  a\r\n\r\nsaying in India, Sir, that the fox tries to imitate\r\n\r\nthe  lion  but  does not succeed. For unfortunately\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member for Serangoon was not  convincing\r\n\r\nenough; he cannot talk convincingly enough like the\r\n\r\nhon. Member for Tanjong Pagar can sometimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.15 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member for Serangoon asked how long\r\n\r\nhad  the Government delayed this Bill? The fact  is\r\n\r\nthat  it  was  referred to the Select Committee  in\r\n\r\nSeptember  1956. That Committee kept the  Bill  for\r\n\r\nnine  months and made its Report in June 1957.  Now\r\n\r\nif   the  Select  Committee  took  nine  months  to\r\n\r\nconsider  this  Bill, which is a  very  complicated\r\n\r\npiece of legislation, how much longer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  it  take for the Attorney-General  to  draft\r\n\r\nthis  complicated piece of legislation,  especially\r\n\r\nas  it  is not all a matter of drafting by his  own\r\n\r\nself but of having to consult the City Council  and\r\n\r\nvarious other Departments which are involved  under\r\n\r\nthis  Bill, for it should be noticed that this Bill\r\n\r\ndoes involve many Departments. The City Council  is\r\n\r\nof  course  the primary body involved; on  planning\r\n\r\npowers  and so on the S.I.T. is involved;  and  the\r\n\r\npolice  are  involved  on the  hawker  and  traffic\r\n\r\nangles. All of them had to be consulted and all the\r\n\r\ninformation-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Hon. Minister is probably\r\n\r\nconfusing   the  two  Bills.  One  is   the   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment Bill, the Report on which was  presented\r\n\r\non  19th  June 1957; we are dealing with the  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment Elections Bill the Report of  which  was\r\n\r\npresented on 18th January, 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I am sorry, Sir. My point was\r\n\r\nthis,  that one is related to the other and  unless\r\n\r\nwe  have  the Local Government Bill we cannot  have\r\n\r\nthis Local Government Elections Bill passed in this\r\n\r\nHouse. Hon. Members will remember that in fact this\r\n\r\nBill  was  got ready by the Select Committee  early\r\n\r\nbut  because  the other and major Bill,  the  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment  Bill,  was held up in Select  Committee\r\n\r\nthis Bill could not be got to the House. Since both\r\n\r\nBills   are  related,  it  is  important   that   a\r\n\r\ncomplicated piece of legislation like that proposed\r\n\r\nin  the  other  Bill,  the Local  Government  Bill,\r\n\r\nshould be given full consideration before it  comes\r\n\r\nto us and should not be rushed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we are doing all we can to hold the\r\n\r\nelections  in December, bearing in mind  the  sword\r\n\r\nwhich  is  hanging over our heads of  the  Liberal-Socialist City Councillors, who threaten to  resign\r\n\r\nif   we   postpone  the  elections  from  December.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, Sir, the suggestion that elections can  be\r\n\r\npostponed  beyond December made by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin may have a thought\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbehind it - that if these elections are postponed the\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialists can hold sway longer in the City\r\n\r\nCouncil.  I  do  not know whether that  thought  is\r\n\r\nbehind the suggestion. I am not in the habit,  Sir,\r\n\r\nof making accusations without justification, as the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member for Serangoon is. I am just suggesting\r\n\r\nthat  the wish may be father to the thought - to  his\r\n\r\nproposal to delay the elections. It is possible.  I\r\n\r\ndo not say that that is so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member for Paya Lebar, who normally\r\n\r\nis   a  meek  and  mild  man,  who  does  not  hurl\r\n\r\naccusations  like  the  hon. Member  for  Serangoon\r\n\r\ndoes,  today  came  out in full force  against  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. He said, Sir, that it would have  saved\r\n\r\na   lot  of  accusations  if  the  Government   had\r\n\r\npublished this Report a couple of months  back.  He\r\n\r\ndoes  not  realise that Government is rushing  this\r\n\r\nthing  through  as  fast  as  possible,  that   the\r\n\r\nMinister is spending sleepless nights studying  the\r\n\r\nBill   and  that  all  the  officials  are  working\r\n\r\novertime to get this thing through so that  we  can\r\n\r\nhave elections quicker. He does not realise that we\r\n\r\nhave  not  held up this Report for two  months  and\r\n\r\nthat  it  was given to hon. Members to counter  the\r\n\r\naccusations hurled by the Member for Serangoon, who\r\n\r\ntried  to imitate the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nbut  evidently  could  not imitate  his  oratorical\r\n\r\npowers.  The hon. Member for Serangoon at the  last\r\n\r\nsitting   tried   to  accuse  the   Government   of\r\n\r\nmachinations  and  so  on, of \"fixing\"  boundaries.\r\n\r\nThat  is why this Report has been given out to show\r\n\r\nto  the  hon. Member and the public at  large  that\r\n\r\nthese accusations are false and without foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, the Minister for Commerce\r\n\r\nand Industry made the suggestion - he said it was not\r\n\r\nan accusation - that possibly the reason for all this\r\n\r\ndebate today is that the Liberal-Socialists want to\r\n\r\nremain  in  office in the City Council. We  do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to  delay the City Council elections provided\r\n\r\nprinciples   are  observed,  and   what   we   most\r\n\r\nemphatically want to do is to have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngenera1   elections  earlier  to  put  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment out of office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also considers that I was being apologetic in having second thoughts and that the\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialists cannot make up  their  minds.  I\r\n\r\nfind  his  argument amusing. The Government  itself\r\n\r\nhas had second thoughts by accepting the first part\r\n\r\nof  our amendment and the principle that goes  with\r\n\r\nit.   The  Liberal-Socialists  have  made  up   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   mind   for   it.   I   welcome   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's second thoughts which endorse our  own\r\n\r\nsecond thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to get back to facts. The Hon. the Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary  a  little  time ago confessed  that  the\r\n\r\nprinters  were  now  well on  with  making  up  the\r\n\r\nregisters. That being so, it is quite obvious  that\r\n\r\nthe  delineation  of the electoral  boundaries  was\r\n\r\ncompleted some considerable time ago. Why therefore\r\n\r\nwas  this  Report not made public earlier  so  that\r\n\r\nrepresentations could be made? The  fact  that  the\r\n\r\nregisters  have been made up - I think  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Local Government, Lands and Housing said  they\r\n\r\nwere   half-completed - means  that  the  delineation\r\n\r\nitself was completed a long time ago, otherwise the\r\n\r\nregisters  could not have been half  printed  which\r\n\r\nmeans  presumably  that 16  of  the  divisions  are\r\n\r\nalready complete and printed. Sir, I spoke on  this\r\n\r\nsame principle in the Select Committee on the Local\r\n\r\nGovernment  Bill when clause 5 was  considered,  on\r\n\r\n16th  May.  The  amendment  which  I  tabled  which\r\n\r\nincluded   a  similar  proviso  to  that   we   are\r\n\r\ndiscussing  now, was in the hands of the Government\r\n\r\na  fortnight earlier. Therefore the Government knew\r\n\r\nperfectly well what was the argument on this matter\r\n\r\nregarding the publication of boundaries for  public\r\n\r\nobjection. Sir, to say that the Government has  not\r\n\r\nhad time is an argument which we cannot support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to us, Sir, that the Government is\r\n\r\ndetermined  to  push  these new boundaries  through\r\n\r\nwithout any consideration for any objections  which\r\n\r\nmay  be  made.  It  has nevertheless  accepted  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  and  then  gone on to  flout  that  very\r\n\r\nprinciple.  It  accepts the  principle  for  future\r\n\r\nelections  but  will not accept it for  the  coming\r\n\r\nelections. In other words, it accepts the principle\r\n\r\nbut\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwrites  it down on a post-dated cheque, which  only\r\n\r\nshows  its  bankruptcy  of  democratic  ideas   and\r\n\r\ndemocratic principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, if I\r\n\r\nunderstand  the hon.

The first is the question\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  procedure which the Government has thought fit\r\n\r\nto  adopt. The second is the question of the merits\r\n\r\nof  the charge made by the Liberal-Socialist  Party\r\n\r\nagainst the Government that it has been fixing  the\r\n\r\nboundary lines to the advantage of the Labour Front\r\n\r\nCoalition Parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first charge, that the procedure has not\r\n\r\nbeen,  to  say the least, proper, no one  can  deny\r\n\r\nthat  the  position of the Minister responsible  is\r\n\r\nindefensible.  He had ample opportunity  to  inform\r\n\r\nall  the other political Parties of what was  going\r\n\r\non. He could not only have cleared his Ministry and\r\n\r\nthe  Committee, but everyone else of any allegation\r\n\r\nof  bias. For some reason or other he has not  done\r\n\r\nthat   and   therefore   he   has   to   bear   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility for this unnecessarily  long  debate\r\n\r\non this very short point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the merits of the boundary lines I would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Liberal-Socialist Party to remember\r\n\r\nthis: for the first time 500,000 people or more are\r\n\r\ngoing  to vote, many of them for the first time  in\r\n\r\ntheir lives, and no Party, however clairvoyant, can\r\n\r\npredict which way the voters are going to vote. The\r\n\r\nProgressive  Party was responsible for  the  Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitution  and  they  worked  out  the  boundary\r\n\r\nlines.  They lost because over 200,000 voters  went\r\n\r\nto the polls for the first time and threw them out.\r\n\r\nSo  even  assuming that the Labour Front  has  been\r\n\r\nrigging   these  boundary  lines,   there   is   no\r\n\r\nguarantee -  in  fact I am more  than  certain  that\r\n\r\nthere is no guarantee - that over 500,000 voters  who\r\n\r\nare going to vote for the first time in their lives\r\n\r\nmay  not  vote in a manner expected either  by  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front, or the Coalition Parties  or  indeed\r\n\r\nthe Liberal-Socialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I\r\n\r\nrefer to Standing Order 54 (1), which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If any Member desires to delete or amend any\r\n\r\nprovision  contained in a Bill as reported  from  a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole Assembly or to introduce any\r\n\r\nnew  provision therein he may at any time before  a\r\n\r\nMember rises to move the third reading of the Bill,\r\n\r\nmove that the Bill be recommitted...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point I have in mind here is that this\r\n\r\nparticular  amendment - the first amendment  standing\r\n\r\nin   my  name -  is  really  consequential  to   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of new clauses in respect of  District\r\n\r\nCouncil  finances and other allied matters,  and  I\r\n\r\nthink  it would be for the convenience of the House\r\n\r\nif we could take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose  three  new  clauses more  or  less  together\r\n\r\nrather  than  take  a debate on what  is  really  a\r\n\r\nconsequential  amendment.

But nothing in fact has  been  done\r\n\r\nand   we  still  have  this  anomaly  of  the  term\r\n\r\n\"councillor\" in one part of the Bill and \"member of\r\n\r\na  local authority\" in another, an anomaly in  fact\r\n\r\neven  in  one  single clause which I  have  already\r\n\r\nquoted.   Therefore  it  seems  to  me  that   this\r\n\r\namendment  is necessary, that \"member  of  a  local\r\n\r\nauthority\"  means a City Councillor or  a  District\r\n\r\nCouncillor   because   that   will   avoid   making\r\n\r\namendments  right through the Bill because  of  the\r\n\r\ninterchange of these two terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

I would also like to quote\r\n\r\nfrom column 9 the words which you said, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Can I explain further? Perhaps if after the Hon.\r\n\r\nthe Attorney-General has considered the whole point\r\n\r\nhe  considers that a definition of this  nature  is\r\n\r\nnot  necessary, it is still open to the Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin  to  move  his  amendment  at  the   Report\r\n\r\nstage...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,   after  consideration  we  feel   that   this\r\n\r\namendment  is not necessary. There is  no  need  to\r\n\r\namend as suggested by the Member for Tanglin. There\r\n\r\nare certain general clauses which are applicable to\r\n\r\nall  local  authorities, Sir, and in  such  general\r\n\r\nclauses  the  description which is mostly  used  is\r\n\r\n\"member  of  a local authority\", as in clauses  21,\r\n\r\n22, 23 (1), (2), (3), and (5), 24, 25 (1), (3), 27,\r\n\r\n28  and 45, and there is no need to define a member\r\n\r\nof  a local authority, Sir, because local authority\r\n\r\nis  already  defined as being a City Council  or  a\r\n\r\nDistrict Council as the case may be. So a member of\r\n\r\na  local authority means a member of a City Council\r\n\r\nor  a District Council as the case may be, which is\r\n\r\nthe  same  as saying a member of a local  authority\r\n\r\nmeans a City Councillor or a District Councillor as\r\n\r\nthe case may be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, certain specific clauses\r\n\r\nwhich  refer  either to the City Council  or  to  a\r\n\r\nDistrict   Council,   in   which   Councillor    is\r\n\r\nspecifically  used  as referring  to  such  persons\r\n\r\nspecifically. And in the definition of  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin,  he includes Chairman of  a  District\r\n\r\nCouncil  and the Deputy Chairman. I would  like  to\r\n\r\npoint  out,  Sir, clause 17, where the Chairman  is\r\n\r\nalready deemed to be a Councillor. There is no need\r\n\r\nto  mention him again in the definition of  \"member\r\n\r\nof  a local authority\", and again, Sir, with regard\r\n\r\nto  the  Deputy  Chairman, I think the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin  has perhaps overlooked the fact  that  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Chairman is not a Councillor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those reasons, Sir, we feel that the amendment is not necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, perhaps the Hon. the Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary will explain the reason why in clause  25\r\n\r\n(3),  line  6, there is mention of \"a member  of  a\r\n\r\nlocal authority\" and in the same clause, sub-clause\r\n\r\n(3)  (c)  a  little way down the page, there  is  a\r\n\r\nchange  to the term \"councillor\".

If you turn to clause 111 on\r\n\r\npage 121 regarding valuation, you will read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A local authority shall cause to be prepared a\r\n\r\nlist, which shall be known as 'the Valuation List',\r\n\r\nof all houses, buildings, lands and tenements...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I agree, Sir, that you can say that in the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  \"building\"  on  page  70  there  is\r\n\r\nincluded the term \"house\", but \"building\" there  is\r\n\r\nused  more in the sense of a structure than in that\r\n\r\nof  a dwelling house, and you have a definition  of\r\n\r\n\"house\" on page 71 which includes a dwelling-house,\r\n\r\nwarehouse,  office, counting-house,  shop,  school,\r\n\r\nand   any  other  building  in  which  persons  are\r\n\r\nemployed,  that  is  to say a place  of  habitation\r\n\r\nrather  than a structure. I therefore think  it  is\r\n\r\nconvenient - I agree it is not absolutely  essential\r\n\r\nbut   it  is  convenient - to  have  under  the  term\r\n\r\n\"premises\"  the  word \"houses\"  included.  I  would\r\n\r\npoint  out  that in the Select Committee  stage  an\r\n\r\namendment was accepted by which the term \"tenement\"\r\n\r\nwas  included  and  that is  in  exactly  the  same\r\n\r\nposition.  You  will find tenements included  under\r\n\r\nthe   term  \"dwelling-house\"  and  you  will   find\r\n\r\ndwelling-house included under the term \"house\", and\r\n\r\nyou   will  find  house  included  under  the  term\r\n\r\n\"building\".  But my point is this: for cleaning  up\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  and making it as clear as possible  from\r\n\r\nthe point of view of annual values and ratings,  it\r\n\r\nis convenient to have the word \"houses\" included in\r\n\r\nthe definition of \"premises\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Sir, we\r\n\r\naccept this amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3, as amended, ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 74, line 18, after \"him\", to insert\r\n\r\n\", provided that the provisions of this section  shall\r\n\r\nalso  apply  in respect of the alterations  in  the\r\n\r\nlimits  of the City described in the First Schedule\r\n\r\nto  this  Ordinance from those existing  under  the\r\n\r\nMunicipal Ordinance\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment to the clause is to some extent\r\n\r\nparallel  to that which we debated under the  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment Elections Bill earlier this morning, but\r\n\r\nmuch larger issues are involved in this clause than\r\n\r\nin  respect  of the other Bill. The principle  that\r\n\r\nnotification should be gazetted not only for future\r\n\r\nminor alterations but the present major alterations\r\n\r\nis  an  important matter when you are  making  such\r\n\r\nvast  changes  in the limits of the  City  and  the\r\n\r\nDistricts as are proposed in the First Schedule  to\r\n\r\nthis Bill. You do not have to go into the merits or\r\n\r\ndemerits of particular cases but you have  a  large\r\n\r\npart  of Katong, Siglap and Geylang Serai-Ulu Bedok\r\n\r\ngoing out into the district areas. A large part  of\r\n\r\nthis area is thoroughly urbanised. You have on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand a largely rural area - Pasir Panjang  and\r\n\r\nUlu Pandan - being brought into the City Council area\r\n\r\nfrom  the  rural  areas. You have a  third  anomaly\r\n\r\nwhich cuts across the other two, of a change in the\r\n\r\nBraddell  Road area, where an entirely  rural  area\r\n\r\nwhich  has been in the City Council area  for  many\r\n\r\nyears is being divided into two, one part going out\r\n\r\ninto  the Districts and the other remaining in  the\r\n\r\nCity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you have three different types of anomalies\r\n\r\nstriking  against the normal principle of extension\r\n\r\nof  City  Council  boundaries. When  a  rural  area\r\n\r\nbecomes  urbanised it is normal to bring it  within\r\n\r\nthe   area   of  the  City  Council;  whereas   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, for some reason best known  to  itself,\r\n\r\nwants to go in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now whether or not these changes are acceptable\r\n\r\nis  a matter in which the people should have a say,\r\n\r\nand  in which they have not had sufficient say.  It\r\n\r\nis  true, of course, that the Schedules were to  be\r\n\r\nfound  at  the  back of this very complicated  Bill\r\n\r\nwhen  it was first gazetted some time ago,  but  it\r\n\r\nwas   only  of  course  available  in  the  English\r\n\r\nlanguage (and I shall shortly point out that it  is\r\n\r\nsomewhat stretching the English language trying  to\r\n\r\nfollow a surveyor's idea of where a boundary lies).\r\n\r\nBut there was no notification whatever in the other\r\n\r\nthree main languages - Chinese, Malay and Tamil -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalthough for the first time those are to be  spoken\r\n\r\nlanguages  in  the  City Council and  the  District\r\n\r\nCouncils\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier on the other Bill, I raised\r\n\r\nthis  point on 16th May and the Government has  had\r\n\r\nplenty  of time. It has had two months in which  to\r\n\r\nmake the necessary gazetting or to inform people as\r\n\r\nto  what these new boundaries are in four languages\r\n\r\nand  with  the assistance of a map. And I  may  say\r\n\r\nthat the description of the boundaries is extremely\r\n\r\ncomplicated  to follow and there has  been  no  map\r\n\r\npublished with the Bill, only with the White Paper;\r\n\r\nso that the public has not had sufficient access to\r\n\r\nthe facts regarding the Government's intentions. As\r\n\r\nI  say,  I raised the point in the Select Committee\r\n\r\nmeeting on 16th May and I would also refer  you  to\r\n\r\nthe present Municipal Ordinance, section 362, where\r\n\r\nthe same or similar provision is made:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"No alteration shall be made in the limits of the\r\n\r\nMunicipality under section 5 or in the water limits\r\n\r\nunder  section  59  or  in any  area  mentioned  in\r\n\r\nsection   399,   unless  and  until  the   proposed\r\n\r\nalteration  has  been notified in  four  successive\r\n\r\nGazettes  and  contemporaneously  advertised   once\r\n\r\nevery  week  for  four  consecutive  weeks  in  one\r\n\r\nEnglish and one vernacular paper, if any...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  more  or less follows the main part  of  this\r\n\r\nclause  5. My point is this: I question whether  in\r\n\r\nfact  notification should not have been given under\r\n\r\nsection  362  of  the present Municipal  Ordinance.\r\n\r\nLegally  perhaps the lawyers will argue  that  that\r\n\r\nwould not have been possible but even if the letter\r\n\r\nof the law could not have been observed, the spirit\r\n\r\nof  the law is there, and because the future  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment  Ordinance  is to  succeed  the  present\r\n\r\nMunicipal  Ordinance  it would  be  only  right  in\r\n\r\nprinciple that the Government should have published\r\n\r\nand  notified  by Gazette and in the newspapers  of\r\n\r\nfour  languages  what it intended to  do,  for  the\r\n\r\nconvenience of the people so that they  could  make\r\n\r\ntheir objections if they desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to refer you to the First\r\n\r\nSchedule at the back of the Bill, page 246, and  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  to you that as this is all that  has  been\r\n\r\nplaced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore  the  public,  it  is  inadequate  and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has not carried it out,  as  it  should\r\n\r\nhave carried it out, adequately. The first Schedule\r\n\r\nstarts:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"All that part of the Island of Singapore bounded\r\n\r\napproximately as follows: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commencing at a point where the production\r\n\r\nsouthwards  of the western boundary of  Clementi\r\n\r\nRoad  across West Coast Road meets the  southern\r\n\r\ncoast  of  the Island of Singapore approximately\r\n\r\n50  yards  south-west of the junction  of  Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang,  West  Coast  and Clementi  Roads,  the\r\n\r\nboundary  runs  generally northwards  along  the\r\n\r\naforesaid production of the western boundary  of\r\n\r\nClementi  Road  and its continuation  along  the\r\n\r\nwestern  boundary of Clementi Road  to  a  point\r\n\r\napproximately  220  yards  north  of  7\ufffd  mile\r\n\r\nstone,  Clementi Road where it meets the  south-eastern   boundary  of  Clementi  Road   Housing\r\n\r\nEstate;  thence along the aforesaid southeastern\r\n\r\nboundary  of Clementi Road Housing Estate  on  a\r\n\r\nbearing of approximately 247\ufffd for a distance  of\r\n\r\n1,310 feet to the eastern boundary of West Coast\r\n\r\nRoad; thence along the eastern boundary of  West\r\n\r\nCoast  Road by successive lines of bearings  and\r\n\r\ndistances approximately as under: -\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n              Bearing          Distance\r\n\r\n           340\ufffd 38' 00\"        177 feet\r\n\r\n           342\ufffd 18' 00\"        487 feet\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nand  so  on. Now, I suggest to you, Sir, that  that\r\n\r\nmay  be  the route the surveyor takes,  but  it  is\r\n\r\neasier for people to understand if you say that the\r\n\r\nboundary  follows Clementi Road until its  junction\r\n\r\nwith  Ulu  Pandan  Road and then  proceeds  up  Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan  Road  until its junction with Holland  Road\r\n\r\nand  then proceeds down Holland Road until  it  has\r\n\r\nreached  its junction with Bukit Timah Road,  which\r\n\r\nis  roughly  but not exactly what this boundary  in\r\n\r\npoint of fact is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But within what I dare say is a terminological\r\n\r\nexactitude  we find that the boundary does  not  in\r\n\r\nfact  go  down  Clementi  Road  which  any  logical\r\n\r\nboundary you think would do, but it makes a  sudden\r\n\r\njump  round a housing estate built by the Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust  and where  I  think  the  Malay\r\n\r\nRegiment is housed. Now why it should suddenly make\r\n\r\na  jump and take in a little housing estate  as  it\r\n\r\nproceeds  down the road is best known to  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  for  Local  Government,  Lands  and\r\n\r\nHousing.  But the point I am making is  this,  that\r\n\r\nthe Government has not,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhatever  the  Government  may  like  to   say   by\r\n\r\npublishing this rigmarole at the back of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nseveral  months ago, made it clear  to  the  public\r\n\r\nwhat  its intentions are. And as I say, with  these\r\n\r\nvast  changes  in  the City Council  limits,  which\r\n\r\naffect  Katong, Ulu Pandan, Pasir Panjang, Braddell\r\n\r\nRoad,  and Siglap and so on, it should notify under\r\n\r\nclause  5 in respect of these first changes  as  it\r\n\r\nproposes should be done in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>12.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said before on the other Bill, we should\r\n\r\nstart  as we mean to go on. That would be a  proper\r\n\r\ndemocratic  way  of  doing  things.  And   if   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  again claims that we do  not  have  the\r\n\r\ntime,  then  I have only to point out that  it  had\r\n\r\njust  as  much time, and even more time, to publish\r\n\r\nand gazette these changes than it has for the other\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

T. Stewart (Acting Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Chief Secretary (Mr S. T. Stewart):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the merits and demerits of the\r\n\r\nboundaries   of  the  First  Schedule   have   been\r\n\r\ndiscussed  at  length in Select Committee  and  was\r\n\r\ntouched upon by the Minister in his speech in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  last  week. I think we  can  discuss  the\r\n\r\nquestion of boundaries more in detail when we  come\r\n\r\nto  the  First Schedule, Sir. The argument here  is\r\n\r\nthat the boundaries in the First Schedule should be\r\n\r\nsubjected  to the procedure laid down in clause  5.\r\n\r\nIt  has  already been pointed out,  Sir,  that  the\r\n\r\nMcNeice  Report  and  the  Government  White  Paper\r\n\r\nshowing boundaries were published some time ago and\r\n\r\nthat  an  opportunity to submit representations  to\r\n\r\nthe  Select Committee was given. What I  said  this\r\n\r\nmorning. Sir, about the effect on the City  Council\r\n\r\nand   District  Councils  elections   on   changing\r\n\r\nboundaries  now also holds good in discussing  this\r\n\r\nclause.  If  this amendment is accepted,  then  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council elections cannot be held in December.\r\n\r\nThere   is   already  considerable  dissatisfaction\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the delay in holding the City  Council\r\n\r\nelections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we have a new Bill repealing the existing\r\n\r\nMunicipal   Ordinance   and   reorganizing    local\r\n\r\ngovernment in Singapore. New local authorities  are\r\n\r\nbeing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncreated  with jurisdiction over new areas and  this\r\n\r\nBill  incorporating  the new areas  is  before  the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people in this Assembly  for\r\n\r\napproval. I would like to quote, Sir, the words  of\r\n\r\nthe then Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield)\r\n\r\nat column 20, Report No. 1:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"As the hon. Member can see from the provisos to\r\n\r\nboth  clauses 5 and 15, the Government accepts  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  that changes in the limits of  the  City\r\n\r\nand of the districts should be advertised, and that\r\n\r\nthe procedure described in these clauses should  be\r\n\r\nfollowed.  But this particular change in boundaries\r\n\r\nmade  by  this Bill is, in our view, on a different\r\n\r\nfooting  altogether - the  changes  in  the  existing\r\n\r\nboundaries are incorporated in a Bill presented  to\r\n\r\nthe Legislative Assembly and will be dealt with  by\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly. For that reason, and  also  for  the\r\n\r\nreason that we must take some definite step towards\r\n\r\nholding  City  Council elections in the  reasonably\r\n\r\nnear  future, we cannot accept the amendment  which\r\n\r\nthe hon. Member has moved to clause 5.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then,  Sir, I would like to quote the words of  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanglin (Mr Ede) at column 17,  Report\r\n\r\nNo. 1:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Yes, Sir, but there is one rather important\r\n\r\npoint  which perhaps I can make, and that is  this:\r\n\r\nthat  I  would wish, of course, to move  a  similar\r\n\r\namendment  under  clause  15  on  district  council\r\n\r\nlimits,  which is similar to clause 5,  bearing  in\r\n\r\nmind  that  the  Government has now  introduced  an\r\n\r\namendment  to  its own First Schedule  before  this\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee, an amendment which has not  been\r\n\r\ngiven  any airing whatever for the benefit  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.  The  Government may say,  \"Well,  we  have\r\n\r\npublished  this  Bill  which  includes  the   First\r\n\r\nSchedule and let out what these new areas will  be.\r\n\r\nThe public have had a chance to air their views and\r\n\r\nto  appear before this Select Committee to say what\r\n\r\nthey  feel.'  But  that will not  be  the  case  in\r\n\r\nrespect of the amendments which are proposed by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  on page 30 onwards of the Revised  List\r\n\r\nof Amendments circulated on 15th April, 1957. These\r\n\r\namendments  propose  changes  to  be  made  in  the\r\n\r\ndistrict areas which are unknown to anyone  outside\r\n\r\nthis Committee so far as I am aware.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  the Member for Tanglin said that there is  an\r\n\r\namendment to the First Schedule in Select Committee\r\n\r\nwhich  was  not  given an airing whatever  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of the public. In fact, Sir, there are  two\r\n\r\namendments but what are these amendments? They  are\r\n\r\nmere rectification of errors in the description  of\r\n\r\nthe  boundaries and nothing more. No  boundary  has\r\n\r\nbeen  altered. They are just errors in  description\r\n\r\nand we are rectifying the errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned the amendments to the Second\r\n\r\nSchedule made by Government in Select Committee for\r\n\r\nsimilar  reasons.  Except for two  amendments,  the\r\n\r\nother  amendments  are  also  corrections  in   the\r\n\r\ndescription   with   no  actual   change   in   the\r\n\r\nboundaries. Of the two amendments, one is  actually\r\n\r\na  minor  one  which I am sure nobody will  quarrel\r\n\r\nabout  and the reasons are given in column  353  of\r\n\r\nReport No. 13:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The reasons for the first amendment as suggested\r\n\r\nby  the Chief Statistician is that, as will be seen\r\n\r\nfrom   the  Plan  B,  the  present  proposed  local\r\n\r\ngovernment  boundary  cuts  along  the   land   now\r\n\r\noccupied by the Royal Malayan Navy.

The\r\n\r\namendments  to which the hon.

Member in referring to the\r\n\r\nFirst Schedule said that the manner in which it was\r\n\r\ndescribed   was  very  difficult  for   people   to\r\n\r\nunderstand.  Sir, there is nothing wrong  with  the\r\n\r\nmanner  in which the First Schedule had been  drawn\r\n\r\nup.   In  fact,  it  is  a  recognised  method   of\r\n\r\ndescription   and   it  is  only   describing   the\r\n\r\nboundaries; these boundaries are shown in the  maps\r\n\r\nattached  to  Report No. 13. Even the Schedules  in\r\n\r\nthe   Local   Government  Bill,  when   they   were\r\n\r\nintroduced in this Assembly, Sir, merely  described\r\n\r\nthe boundaries which appeared in the McNeice Report\r\n\r\nand the White Paper on Local Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the facts, I submit that there is\r\n\r\nno  need  to  advertise  these  boundaries  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  as would be required if this  amendment\r\n\r\nis  accepted  and for those reasons, Sir,  which  I\r\n\r\nhave given, I oppose the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, as in the case of clause 8\r\n\r\nof  the Local Government Elections Ordinance, so in\r\n\r\nthis clause, a principle is involved. The principle\r\n\r\nis that, when changes are made in the limits of the\r\n\r\ncity  area or the district area, the Minister shall\r\n\r\ngazette   and  advertise  in  newspapers  so   that\r\n\r\nobjections  may  be lodged. As I pointed  out  this\r\n\r\nmorning,  that is a principle which has a precedent\r\n\r\nin  the present Municipal Ordinance in section  362\r\n\r\nand although it may be a legal fact that you cannot\r\n\r\napply  that in this particular case, as I said,  it\r\n\r\nis  the spirit of the law and not the letter of the\r\n\r\nlaw that counts. The Government at the time had the\r\n\r\nprecedent  to gazette and advertise in  the  manner\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been  done  for many  years  under  the\r\n\r\npresent Municipa1 Ordinance but apparently they had\r\n\r\nnot  the  intention. Indeed I would say  that  they\r\n\r\nhave   been   extremely  casual  with  the   future\r\n\r\nelectorate in the City Council area in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would refer you, Sir, to the original clause 5\r\n\r\non page 8 of the Bill which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"No alteration shall be made in the limits of the\r\n\r\nCity  under  subsection (1) of section  4  of  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance  unless and until the proposed alteration\r\n\r\nhas  been notified in four successive Gazettes  and\r\n\r\ncontemporaneously advertised once  every  week  for\r\n\r\nfour  consecutive  weeks in  one  English  and  one\r\n\r\nvernacular newspaper circulating in the City...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It was only when I moved an amendment in the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee,  pointing out that with the introduction\r\n\r\nof four languages for prospective candidates to the\r\n\r\nCity   Council   advertising  in   one   vernacular\r\n\r\nnewspaper  was insufficient, that an amendment  was\r\n\r\naccepted  by the Government that it should  be  one\r\n\r\nChinese,  one Malay and one Indian and  not  merely\r\n\r\none  vernacular newspaper, presumably  selected  at\r\n\r\nrandom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we can see that sufficient thought has not\r\n\r\nbeen   given  to  this  matter  by  the  Government\r\n\r\nalthough   they  have  had  sufficient   time   and\r\n\r\ncertainly  sufficient  warning  to  carry  out  the\r\n\r\npurpose  and the spirit of the amendment  which  we\r\n\r\npropose today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Chairman, on the point of the\r\n\r\npurpose  and the spirit, I may mention  that  these\r\n\r\namendments were made in Select Committee  and  they\r\n\r\nare still in Select Committee. I think - I am new to\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly - if I am correct, we cannot  disclose\r\n\r\nanything which is still in Select Committee to  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, that was not my point. My\r\n\r\npoint  was  that  the Government  had  before  them\r\n\r\nsection  362 of the Municipal Ordinance which  they\r\n\r\ncould have followed in the spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Chairman, I hate to suggest that\r\n\r\nsome of the Members of the Opposition are embarking\r\n\r\non  a  filibuster  in connection  with  this  Bill.\r\n\r\nReally I feel we cannot go on-I suppose we can  but\r\n\r\nit  is undesirable that we should-discussing a  lot\r\n\r\nof points that have already been made this morning.\r\n\r\nThe  point  is  really  very  simple:  whether  the\r\n\r\nboundaries  proposed  are  all  right.  No  serious\r\n\r\nargument  has been produced to show that  they  are\r\n\r\nnot all right. There has been no questioning of the\r\n\r\nboundaries as such. As someone said, \"On principle,\r\n\r\nlet  us have as much delay as possible.\" The Member\r\n\r\nfor  Serangoon  (Mr Lim Choon  Mong)  appeared  to\r\n\r\nwelcome the chance of having some delay and he  was\r\n\r\nvigorously  supported by the Member for  Queenstown\r\n\r\n(Mr  Lee Choon Eng). The delay was no harm at  all\r\n\r\nin his opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is obvious that if you are going to\r\n\r\nreopen  the  question of boundaries for  objections\r\n\r\neither there will be objections in which case there\r\n\r\nwill  be delay, or else there will be no objections\r\n\r\nin which case the exercise is meaningless. There is\r\n\r\nno   reason   to  suppose  that  there   would   be\r\n\r\nobjections, since substantially everyone has  known\r\n\r\nfor a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery  long  time  what the proposed  changes  were:\r\n\r\nwhether  they follow Clementi Road on a  surveyor's\r\n\r\ndescription  is  a  very minor point.  The  general\r\n\r\nscheme  of what was going to happen has been  known\r\n\r\nfor  a very long time indeed and I really feel that\r\n\r\nwe ought to get on with our business, Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nand  not  involve ourselves either in delay  during\r\n\r\nthis  debate  or in delay further on  by  accepting\r\n\r\nthis amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, it seems to me that the\r\n\r\nHon. the  Minister  for Communications  and  Works\r\n\r\nwants  to gag the Opposition. He stated that  there\r\n\r\nhas been no objection to the boundaries and that we\r\n\r\nthought  that  the boundaries are all  right.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat is a complete misconception. They are not  all\r\n\r\nright. I made the point this morning that it  would\r\n\r\nbe  preferable not to go into the pros and cons and\r\n\r\nthe  merits and demerits of Katong going  into  the\r\n\r\nDistrict  Council or staying in the city  area  and\r\n\r\nthat  was  echoed by my friend the Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary  only a few minutes ago. We do object  to\r\n\r\nthe  boundaries as they stand at the moment, and  I\r\n\r\nam  quite prepared to launch into the case for  the\r\n\r\nboundaries  being  left as they are  at  this  very\r\n\r\nmoment  if my hon. Friend wishes, but our intention\r\n\r\nwas that we should discuss this particular point on\r\n\r\nthe amendments to the First and Second Schedules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, there is\r\n\r\njust one principle involved: must we or must we not\r\n\r\nlet  the electorate know whether they are going  to\r\n\r\nbe  in  the city area or outside the city  area?  I\r\n\r\nthink  on  this  point there can  be  no  argument.\r\n\r\nClause 5 of this Bill states clearly that it is the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  view that they must  be  notified  by\r\n\r\nfour   successive  Gazettes  and  contemporaneously\r\n\r\nadvertised  once  every week for  four  consecutive\r\n\r\nweeks  in English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers. This principle has been agreed by  all.\r\n\r\nThe  Government has put it forward. We  agree  with\r\n\r\nthat  principle  but the point  is  this:  if  this\r\n\r\nprinciple is introduced, is it going to be observed\r\n\r\nonly when it suits the Government or if a principle\r\n\r\nis involved\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  agreed upon, then it must be agreed  upon  and\r\n\r\nput into practice every time? I think to exclude it\r\n\r\nfor  the  first  time, Sir, does  not  convey  that\r\n\r\nspirit.  In  accordance with  the  amendment  here,\r\n\r\nthere is nothing wrong about it. The principle just\r\n\r\ncalls  upon  the  Government  to  carry  out   that\r\n\r\nprinciple which it is preaching not only for coming\r\n\r\nchanges  but also for present changes. I think  the\r\n\r\npeople have a right to know and have a right to put\r\n\r\ntheir views before the Government. The principle is\r\n\r\nthere: everybody accepts it. Why it is not put into\r\n\r\npractice is in the words of the Government, \"Do not\r\n\r\ncause  delay.\" But whose fault is it when it  comes\r\n\r\nto  a  matter  of delay? Is it because  the  people\r\n\r\ndelayed in conveying their views to the Government?\r\n\r\nHas  the Government given them the chance to  voice\r\n\r\ntheir opposition to this? The Government has not up\r\n\r\nto this point. The Government has not put them into\r\n\r\nGazettes or published them. There are two different\r\n\r\nphases in accordance with this view: one is to  put\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  to this House and make it law  and  the\r\n\r\nother is the Delineation Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we have come to this stage, Sir. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  today is trying to tell  us,  \"Now,  we\r\n\r\nhave  passed  this  Bill.  You  shall  accept   our\r\n\r\nrecommendation.\"  Could not  these  recommendations\r\n\r\nhave  been put forward by the Delineation Committee\r\n\r\nat  an earlier date? Could not this committee  have\r\n\r\nbeen  appointed  at an earlier date  and  then  the\r\n\r\nproposed  boundaries made known to  the  people  so\r\n\r\nthat  they could be gazetted before it is too late?\r\n\r\nWe  are  not  in  any way agreed on postponing  the\r\n\r\nelections.  The  postponement of the  elections  is\r\n\r\nmainly  due  to the inefficiency of the  Government\r\n\r\nand  if  the Government had thought about it during\r\n\r\nthe  time  when  it  expressed  vociferously  about\r\n\r\nholding City Council elections in 1955 and in 1956,\r\n\r\nit  should  have  had  a thought  about  these  new\r\n\r\nboundaries, appointed a committee earlier  and  let\r\n\r\nthe people know earlier through the newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M.

Member  were  to\r\n\r\nsuggest that these are all matters hidden from  the\r\n\r\npeople, I can only say that that is \"double talk\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

I was only trying\r\n\r\nto  emphasise that these matters were really in the\r\n\r\nhands  of  the people for quite a long time  and  I\r\n\r\nthink,  Sir,  to say that the people did  not  know\r\n\r\nanything  about  these  matters  is  insulting  the\r\n\r\nintelligence of the people of Singapore. They  were\r\n\r\nvery  well aware and if they had any idea of making\r\n\r\nrepresentations  to the Committee they  would  have\r\n\r\ndone  so.  In  the  absence of any representations,\r\n\r\nSir,  we  believe  that the people  are  completely\r\n\r\nbehind  the Government in their views.

In other words, the Members of\r\n\r\nthis Assembly would not have had an opportunity  of\r\n\r\ndebating  the  merits and demerits of  the  aspects\r\n\r\ninvolved  in the local government affairs.  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  we  have given the opportunity for  all  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers to discuss the merits and demerits  of  not\r\n\r\nonly  the various boundaries of electoral divisions\r\n\r\nbut also the Schedules as suggested in this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote, Sir, a statement made by\r\n\r\nthe  then  Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield)\r\n\r\nfrom the Official Report of the Select Committee on\r\n\r\nLocal Government Bill No. 1 at column 20:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government maintains its stand for the very\r\n\r\ngood  reason  that these changes are being  brought\r\n\r\nbefore  the  representatives of the people  in  the\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly - a  far  better  method   than\r\n\r\nadvertising  in  the newspapers  (which  would,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  be  followed  where changes  in  the  City\r\n\r\nlimits are made at a later stage).\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Attorney-General said this on behalf of\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  I  feel, Sir, that,  although  we\r\n\r\nagree  in  principle that changes in boundaries  of\r\n\r\nlocal  government  should be published  for  public\r\n\r\nrepresentations, we must make a start and  a  start\r\n\r\ncannot  be  made by asking the people to say  about\r\n\r\nthe   boundaries   and  other   matters   connected\r\n\r\ntherewith  for the first elections.

The\r\n\r\nnumber at present proposed by the Government is 32.\r\n\r\nIf one leaves out the mayor, from the point of view\r\n\r\nthat  he  is  the first gentleman of the  City  who\r\n\r\nshould  be above the general run of committee  work\r\n\r\nand  is  as it were on a pinnacle of his own,  that\r\n\r\nwill  leave 31 active members dealing with the day-to-day  affairs. With the mayor at  its  head,  you\r\n\r\nhave  only 31 as opposed to the present 27  members\r\n\r\nof  the City Council. This increase of four is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  quite insufficient when compared with  the\r\n\r\nenormously  enlarged electorate with which  we  are\r\n\r\nnow faced. It is so long ago since the City Council\r\n\r\nelections  were held and I do not know whether  any\r\n\r\nof us remember just how many there were on the City\r\n\r\nCouncil  electorate three years ago but  it  was  a\r\n\r\nvery insignificant number compared with the 500,000\r\n\r\nwith  which  we are faced in the coming  elections.\r\n\r\nFrom  the  Report of the Committee which  has  been\r\n\r\nthrust\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore us only this morning, we find on page 1 that\r\n\r\nthe average voter strength of a division or ward is\r\n\r\n15,761  and  on page 2 of Annex \"A\"  you  have  the\r\n\r\nbreakdown of the 505,276 expected electors and  the\r\n\r\nnumbers apportioned; against that, is 32 wards. You\r\n\r\nwill  find that in Telok Ayer for example, you have\r\n\r\nno  less than 21,078 electors and below it you have\r\n\r\n12,124  electors in Pasir Panjang. But the average,\r\n\r\nas I have already stated, in this Report is 15,761.\r\n\r\nNow,  that  in itself as an average is higher  than\r\n\r\nthe  average of the present - I think it is  about - 16\r\n\r\ndivisions  of  the Assembly constituencies  roughly\r\n\r\nwithin  the city area, the other nine being in  the\r\n\r\ndistricts  and, as in the future we are  of  course\r\n\r\ngoing   to  double  the  representatives  in   this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  that  figure will be even  more  reduced\r\n\r\nsubject  of course to the increase through our  new\r\n\r\ncitizenship  laws  which are to  come  into  effect\r\n\r\nshortly. Whichever way you look at it, it is  quite\r\n\r\nclear  of  course that the wards - if I may  so  call\r\n\r\nthem  to  separate them from the divisions  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly - are going to have many more electors  than\r\n\r\nthe   divisions.   That  is   a   wrong   principle\r\n\r\naltogether.  That  position  of  course  is   quite\r\n\r\ninevitable because the qualifications for  electors\r\n\r\nfor  the local government elections are much  lower\r\n\r\nand quite different from those that we are going to\r\n\r\nhave for the electorate for the Assembly elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Local Government Elections Bill\r\n\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Subject to the provisions of section 6 of this\r\n\r\nOrdinance, any person who-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) was not less than twenty-one years of\r\n\r\nage...and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) has been ordinarily resident in the Island\r\n\r\nfor a period of not less than five years; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) is a citizen of the United Kingdom and\r\n\r\nColonies    by   virtue   of   the    British\r\n\r\nNationality Act, 1948, or was born in any  of\r\n\r\nthe  States  or territories now  included  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya or  the  Colony  of\r\n\r\nSarawak or the Colony of North Borneo or  the\r\n\r\nState  of  Brunei who was ordinarily resident\r\n\r\nin  Singapore on the first day  of  April  in\r\n\r\nany year,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>shall  be  entitled to have his  name  entered  and\r\n\r\nretained in the register of electors...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  that as a result of approving clause 5 and  the\r\n\r\nconsiderably lower qualifications required for  the\r\n\r\nlocal government electorate, we find ourselves with\r\n\r\n500,000  people to deal with. Now,  in  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom, the normal number of electors in a ward is\r\n\r\nnever larger than 10,000. In fact, it is very often\r\n\r\nconsiderably  less,  and 48  members  of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  would therefore work out very  roughly  to\r\n\r\nthe  500,000  electorate at 10,000 per  ward  which\r\n\r\nwould  be  a very much more satisfactory number  in\r\n\r\nevery  kind  of way because it must be  remembered,\r\n\r\nSir,  that the elected representatives must  be  as\r\n\r\nclose  to the people as possible and that  most  of\r\n\r\nthe  needs  of  the  man in the  street  are  local\r\n\r\ngovernment needs, not the needs of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nWhat the man in the street is interested in is more\r\n\r\nwater,  better drainage, a solution to his problems\r\n\r\nregarding  unauthorised buildings, building  plans,\r\n\r\nhawkers,  electricity, and so  on,  and  these,  as\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the House very well know, are  matters\r\n\r\nwhich  our  own  constituents  bring  to  us   more\r\n\r\nfrequently than any other problems and they are not\r\n\r\nreally  the  problems which elected representatives\r\n\r\nof  the Assembly should have to deal with - I have no\r\n\r\ndoubt we deal with them willingly - but they are  the\r\n\r\nproblems  that  should  go  to  the  elected   City\r\n\r\nCouncillor  who can deal with them more effectively\r\n\r\nfor  the  very reason that it is for  him  to  make\r\n\r\nlocal government operate. Therefore, it seems to us\r\n\r\nessential  that we should increase  the  number  of\r\n\r\nCity  Councillors  to 48 which  would  make  a  far\r\n\r\nbetter  proportion  to  the  electorate  than   the\r\n\r\npresent  proposal. In fact, when the Minister  last\r\n\r\nweek   said   that  there  was  danger   or   over-representation at the local government level, I  am\r\n\r\nafraid I cannot agree with him. The very reverse is\r\n\r\nin   fact   true.   There  is  danger   of   under-representation  because of the huge  electorate  of\r\n\r\nhalf a million people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to have been the idea in the\r\n\r\nMinister's  mind - I  suppose  in  the  mind  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment - that   there   should   not   be    more\r\n\r\ncouncillors  in  local government  than  there  are\r\n\r\nMembers of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly. \"Oh, there are only going to  be  51\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this  House and  therefore  we  cannot\r\n\r\npossibly have as many as 48 in the City Council and\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the District Councils as well.  Better\r\n\r\nkeep  it  down  to 32.\" Now, that  I  think  is  an\r\n\r\nerroneous  approach to the whole  problem.  In  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom, there are roughly 630  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  while there are of course thousands  of\r\n\r\nCity  Councillors and County Councillors  at  local\r\n\r\ngovernment level. The argument does not hold water.\r\n\r\nBut  that is one side and an important side of  our\r\n\r\nreasons for moving an amendment to the number 32.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is connected with the needed\r\n\r\nimprovement  of  the  committee  system  of   local\r\n\r\ngovernment  by  having more  members  of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil.  It  has  to  be  remembered  that   local\r\n\r\ngovernment  is  carried on very  much  by  standing\r\n\r\ncommittees and not by the monthly meetings  of  the\r\n\r\nentire  City Council. The basis of local government\r\n\r\nis  just that. At the moment with 27 members of the\r\n\r\nCity  Council and an increase only to 31,  you  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  have  your standing committees  far  too\r\n\r\nsmall  to carry out the work as efficiently  as  it\r\n\r\ncould  be  carried  out. For example,  the  present\r\n\r\nHealth Committee of the City Council, with its  six\r\n\r\ncouncillors and I think a quorum of three,  has  an\r\n\r\nenormous    number    of    subjects    to     deal\r\n\r\nwith - departments, if I may call them  so:  hawkers,\r\n\r\nmarkets,  infant  welfare clinics, city  cleansing,\r\n\r\nveterinary  departments,  anti-malarial   measures,\r\n\r\nstandpipes, infectious diseases, etc. A whole  host\r\n\r\nof problems is dealt with by six people and because\r\n\r\nthey  are  dealt with only by six people, the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil are unable to delegate powers or feel  that\r\n\r\nthey  should not delegate powers to make  decisions\r\n\r\nto  such a small committee which probably does  not\r\n\r\nsufficiently represent the various four Parties  in\r\n\r\nthe  City Council. Perhaps I would do well to quote\r\n\r\nfrom  the representations made by the City  Council\r\n\r\nrepresentatives themselves to the Select  Committee\r\n\r\non  this point which would be found on page 361  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minutes of Evidence, at column 34, towards the\r\n\r\nbottom:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It [the Council] feels that the least number\r\n\r\nthat  could carry out efficiently the work of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil,  bearing  in mind that the  City  Council\r\n\r\nworks on a Committee system, is 48. The reason why\r\n\r\nthe Council feels that it should be 48 is that  we\r\n\r\nhave   now  in  the  City  Council  nine  Standing\r\n\r\nCommittees.  At  the  moment,  we  have  on   each\r\n\r\nStanding  Committee six members with a  quorum  of\r\n\r\nthree.  In  any expanding city, such as  Singapore\r\n\r\n(where the City Council is closely associated with the  daily wants and needs of the people) the City\r\n\r\nCouncil,  if  it  wants  to discharge  its  duties\r\n\r\nefficiently  and  promptly,  will  have  to   take\r\n\r\ndecisions  quickly  and  the  only  way  in  which\r\n\r\ndecisions can be taken quickly is for the  Council\r\n\r\nto  delegate  completely some of its authority  to\r\n\r\nthe   Standing  Committees.  At  the  moment,  the\r\n\r\nCouncil is very jealous of its overall powers  and\r\n\r\nis  most unwilling to delegate any of these powers\r\n\r\nto  Standing  Committees. I  can  appreciate  that\r\n\r\nposition, Sir, because the quorum of the  Standing\r\n\r\nCommittees is so painfully small - it is three.  How\r\n\r\ncan one reasonably expect to delegate authority to\r\n\r\nsuch a Committee? Now if we have a Committee of at\r\n\r\nleast 10 or 12 or 13 persons, I think there  is  a\r\n\r\ngreater likelihood of the Council being willing to\r\n\r\ndelegate  its authority to this Committee.

Now, that is a question\r\n\r\nthat he asked at this stage in the Select Committee\r\n\r\nand  the  answer is in column 38, page 363  of  the\r\n\r\nMinutes of Evidence.

It should be\r\n\r\nremembered that committee meetings take up a\r\n\r\ntremendous amount of time of important and highly\r\n\r\npaid officials and that the bulk of the time spent\r\n\r\nin committee could be avoided if the details of\r\n\r\nadministration are left to the officers and the\r\n\r\ncommittees, concentrated on policy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He goes on further at paragraph 379:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If the highest standards of efficiency in\r\n\r\nadministration  with the consequential  economy  in\r\n\r\npublic money are to be attained, the members of the\r\n\r\ncouncil  must  play  their part  by  first  of  all\r\n\r\n'letting  the managers manage', secondly, by  self-challenging  every  urge for information  with  the\r\n\r\nquestion 'Is it really necessary?', and finally, to\r\n\r\nrefuse  to refer questions to sub-committees  as  a\r\n\r\ntemporary  evasion of the task of  arriving  at  an\r\n\r\nimmediate  decision. In nine cases out of  ten  the\r\n\r\nultimate  decision of the committee, after  a  sub-committee  has spent a lot of time on  the  subject\r\n\r\nwill  be  the  same as that which would  have  been\r\n\r\ngiven when the case was first raised.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Finally, at paragraph 398:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Without attempting to be critical I am sure no\r\n\r\none except an outsider could see just how much time\r\n\r\nis  being  spent on doing work which is  not  worth\r\n\r\ndoing  but  which  has  become  routine,  how  many\r\n\r\noperations could be streamlined, and the number  of\r\n\r\noutmoded  systems which no one has the  courage  to\r\n\r\ndrop.

I take it that it is the practice\r\n\r\nof   his   Party   councillors  whenever   somebody\r\n\r\napproaches them for help to find out first  whether\r\n\r\nthey are on the electoral register. If the argument\r\n\r\nhad been that the population of Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  increased  and  the  work  had  increased  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  we  need more councillors,  there  might\r\n\r\nhave been some substance in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second argument that it will expedite\r\n\r\nthe  work  by  delegation of authority to  standing\r\n\r\ncommittees,  may I point out that  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin who was a leading member of the Progressive\r\n\r\nParty  recommended  in the Rendel  Report  only  25\r\n\r\nelected seats for the whole island and now  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to have no less than 32 in the City Council,\r\n\r\n12  times  three District Councils (36) ,  making  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of 68. So what is all this complaint  about?\r\n\r\nOne  has  a  sneaking  feeling  that  probably  the\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialist Party fancies  that  its  chances\r\n\r\nwould improve by fielding more candidates. Fielding\r\n\r\na  candidate  is  always an expensive  process  for\r\n\r\nparties  not  so well endowed with wealthy  patrons\r\n\r\nand  therefore if one increases the seats there are\r\n\r\nto contest, mathematically one increases the number\r\n\r\nof  chances of success in the elections but on  the\r\n\r\nmerits of the case whether we should have 32 or 48,\r\n\r\nwe  say let us start with 32 and let us see whether\r\n\r\nit works. We are quite confident that it will work.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why it should not work. There is\r\n\r\nno merit at all in this claim for 48. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, there are one or two\r\n\r\npoints  which I would like to answer.  First,  with\r\n\r\nregard  to  what the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  has\r\n\r\nsaid that you do not need a large number of members\r\n\r\nof  the City Council to carry out the work of  that\r\n\r\nCity  Council, nevertheless, it has been found from\r\n\r\nthe experience in the United Kingdom from which  we\r\n\r\ntake   our  Local  Government  Bill  in  our  local\r\n\r\ngovernment   practice  that  a  large   number   of\r\n\r\ncouncillors  is  a satisfactory way of  associating\r\n\r\npeople  with local government and, in my  own  home\r\n\r\ntown  with a population of 60,000, there is a  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  of no less than 50 persons, so that  when\r\n\r\nwe  advocate  48 for a City Council  of  about  one\r\n\r\nmillion  and  an electorate of half  a  million - one\r\n\r\nmillion  is perhaps slightly over the estimate,  it\r\n\r\nmay be a little less; it is not very much less than\r\n\r\nthat - then\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  seems  to me that we are not very much  out  of\r\n\r\nline in putting forward 48 for this now huge city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the remarks of the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications  and Works, he  quoted  one  or  two\r\n\r\nminor decisions of the Health Committee such as the\r\n\r\npermission  to  sell hot drinks which  having  been\r\n\r\nmade  on the first or second day of the month  then\r\n\r\nhad  to be confirmed by the ordinary meeting of the\r\n\r\nCity  Council  at  the  end of  the  month  and  he\r\n\r\nsuggested that that was unnecessary. I quite  agree\r\n\r\nwith  him and that is the point of delegating  more\r\n\r\npowers  but  of  course not all  decisions  of  the\r\n\r\nHealth  Committee  are  as simple  and  obvious  as\r\n\r\nasking for permission to sell hot drinks. There are\r\n\r\nvery  many more important decisions that the Health\r\n\r\nCommittee  has  to  make each  month  and,  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  these  have to be referred  to  the  whole\r\n\r\nCouncil  for  ratification  because  such  a  small\r\n\r\nnumber  of the City Council altogether are involved\r\n\r\nin  coming to decisions. You have a quorum of  only\r\n\r\nthree  persons.  Is  it desirous  that  you  should\r\n\r\ndelegate  to  the Health Committee very  many  more\r\n\r\npowers than you do now so long as you have a  small\r\n\r\nstanding  committee to deal with  these  questions?\r\n\r\nThat  is  the  point. The quorum of  three  is  not\r\n\r\nsufficient to represent the City Council make-up of\r\n\r\nparties  and independent members, whether they  are\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialists  or Labour  Front-U.M.N.O.-M.C.A.\r\n\r\nor P.A.P. If you want to get a cross-section of the\r\n\r\nCity   Council   represented   on   your   standing\r\n\r\ncommittee,  with an increase in your  quorum,  then\r\n\r\nyou  can  delegate  powers because  you  will  have\r\n\r\ndecisions being made by a proper representation  of\r\n\r\nthe  people but the City Council feels now - and very\r\n\r\nrightly  feels - that important decisions  cannot  be\r\n\r\nleft  to  a  small number of people to  tackle  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  their recommendations that are  made  at\r\n\r\nthe beginning of the month have to be ratified by\r\n\r\nthe full meeting of the City Council at the end  of\r\n\r\nthe  month; therefore, resulting in a delay of  two\r\n\r\nor  three  weeks.  As I say, if you  had  a  larger\r\n\r\ncommittee  sitting on these problems - the important\r\n\r\nproblems,  not the problems of selling  hot  drinks\r\n\r\nbut the important policy problems - then those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblems could be dealt with straightaway  and  put\r\n\r\ninto practice the very next day and not be held  up\r\n\r\nfor a considerable time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  think  that the instances  quoted  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Communications  and  Works   rather\r\n\r\nstrengthens the case for an increased number to  48\r\n\r\ninstead of 32. They bring out very clearly that due\r\n\r\nto the lack in the number of elected members in the\r\n\r\nCity Council, we had very small quorums. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  Council  itself  was  not  prepared  to  leave\r\n\r\ndecisions in the hands of the quorum.

You perhaps may remember, Sir, the\r\n\r\n\"glorious\"  meeting  when we  discussed  about  the\r\n\r\naldermen  principle.

We  felt  that  while  replacing  the   9\r\n\r\nnominated  members,  we are  increasing  the  total\r\n\r\nnumber of City Councillors to 32 and that the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  would be able to run efficiently  with  32\r\n\r\nmembers in the new Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That the word \"thirty-two\"\r\n\r\nproposed to be left out, be left out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee divided: Ayes, 9; Noes, 20;\r\n\r\nAbstention, Nil.\r\n\r\n<pre> \r\n\r\n           Ayes.

Member:</b> Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> But in this particular case, there is\r\n\r\nall  the  more  need  for  this  amendment  because\r\n\r\nchanges  in  boundaries have been made  since  this\r\n\r\nBill  was gazetted. Amendments were moved in Select\r\n\r\nCommittee by the Government which they referred  to\r\n\r\nas  minor trivial amendments of no consequence. One\r\n\r\nof  them, it is true, is a small matter to which  I\r\n\r\nneed  not  refer  but the second amendment  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  a  boundary is one  I  should  have\r\n\r\nthought was of some significance. It is the  moving\r\n\r\nof  a whole village from one District into another:\r\n\r\nNee  Soon  Village from the Bukit Panjang  District\r\n\r\ninto the Serangoon District. Now, I do not wish  to\r\n\r\nargue  the  merits or otherwise, whether  Nee  Soon\r\n\r\nVillage  should  be  in  one  District  or  another\r\n\r\nDistrict, but the principle remains that in  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, the Government moved this amendment that\r\n\r\na  village  should be changed from one District  to\r\n\r\nanother which I should have thought would have been\r\n\r\nof  considerable importance to the  inhabitants  of\r\n\r\nthat village themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as will be known to Members of this House,\r\n\r\nunder the Powers and Privileges Ordinance, anything\r\n\r\nthat  is  decided in Select Committee  may  not  be\r\n\r\ndiscussed  or  mentioned outside that committee  to\r\n\r\nany person whatever, even\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  Members of this House, and it  is  therefore\r\n\r\nnot  possible  to  obtain the views  of  people  on\r\n\r\namendments that are moved in Select Committee. Now,\r\n\r\nthe  Bill, as amended by the Select Committee,  was\r\n\r\nonly  reported to the Assembly a fortnight ago.  It\r\n\r\nwas  only  available presumably to members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  in  this large voluminous form a  fortnight\r\n\r\nago  and so again in this case we feel that  it  is\r\n\r\nall  the  more necessary that the changes  proposed\r\n\r\nwhich   are   completely   new   to   the   people,\r\n\r\nparticularly to the people of Nee Soon,  should  be\r\n\r\ngazetted and advertised in the ordinary way  as  is\r\n\r\nproposed for future alterations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our view is that it is not a small matter to move\r\n\r\none  village  from one District to  another.  There\r\n\r\nmust have been very good reasons initially why  Nee\r\n\r\nSoon  Village was put in the Bukit Panjang District\r\n\r\nand there may be very good reasons why it has since\r\n\r\nbeen moved but the voices of the people of Nee Soon\r\n\r\nshould  be  heard  if they wish to make  themselves\r\n\r\nheard  and that opportunity should be given in  the\r\n\r\nnormal way. It is not sufficient, in our view, that\r\n\r\nthese changes should be notified purely through the\r\n\r\npublication of a huge Bill as it is not likely that\r\n\r\nmany residents in Nee Soon Village would be able to\r\n\r\nread  a  voluminous report of this kind. It should,\r\n\r\nof  course,  be published in the Chinese newspapers\r\n\r\nand  in the Malay and Tamil newspapers so that  the\r\n\r\npeople there can understand what is going on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, like the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin, I do not wish to repeat the arguments\r\n\r\nand  viewpoints which this House has already  heard\r\n\r\nin   connection  with  the  Member  for   Tanglin's\r\n\r\namendment to clause 5, resulting in it being thrown\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned in connection with this amendment,\r\n\r\nsimilar to clause 15, two amendments to the  Second\r\n\r\nSchedule. I am glad to see that he agrees that  one\r\n\r\nof the amendments is a minor one which nobody would\r\n\r\nquarrel about. He speaks at greater length  on  the\r\n\r\nsecond amendment. It is true that it is not a  very\r\n\r\nminor  amendment. On the other hand, it  is  not  a\r\n\r\nvery  major  amendment but the point is  that  this\r\n\r\nproposed change was unknown to anyone except\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Select  Committee. I would like to  point  out\r\n\r\nthat this second amendment is the direct result  of\r\n\r\nthe   representation  of  the  Rural  Board   which\r\n\r\nrepresents  the  people  of  the  rural  areas   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  They  made  representations  that  this\r\n\r\namendment   should  be  made  and  the   Government\r\n\r\naccepted  that amendment and so we had  the  Second\r\n\r\nSchedule amended to follow the representations made\r\n\r\nby the people of the Rural Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those reasons, Sir, I do not wish to repeat\r\n\r\nwhat has been said when we discussed clause 5,  and\r\n\r\nI oppose the amendment of the Member for Tanglin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, Government\r\n\r\nalways  say  that they do not like second  thoughts\r\n\r\nand  I  suppose these second thoughts  coming  from\r\n\r\nthem  would  be  acceptable when  they  transfer  a\r\n\r\nvillage from one District to another. This is  very\r\n\r\nunconvincing. Government seems also to want to  put\r\n\r\nfor  our consumption that it is very democratic and\r\n\r\nsympathetic and that it would listen to  the  views\r\n\r\nof  the  people.  Here, you have  the  Rural  Board\r\n\r\ncoming  to make representations to them and saying,\r\n\r\n\"We  want  Nee Soon Village in this other  District\r\n\r\nand  not in the other,\" and they have agreed.  Yes,\r\n\r\nin  this instance, Sir, they seem to agree and they\r\n\r\nseem  to  make the best of it by beating drums  and\r\n\r\ncrowing  about it but what about the City Council?\r\n\r\nThe  City Council is another body - an elected  body,\r\n\r\nin this instance. They have made representations to\r\n\r\nthe  Government. Has the Government said,  \"We  are\r\n\r\nsympathetic towards it. We will consider your views\r\n\r\nput  forward  to us?\" No, Sir. In the other  case,\r\n\r\nthe  Government said, \"Your views must  be  chucked\r\n\r\naside.  Your  views are not good  enough.\"  In  one\r\n\r\ninstance,   it   is  a  Board  appointed   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. In the other instance, it is a  Council\r\n\r\nwith  many  members elected by the people.  If  you\r\n\r\nweigh  the  views of the people and you think  that\r\n\r\ndemocracy  must  work, this is  an  instance,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhere it will come under the wings of dictatorship;\r\n\r\nyou  may have your views heard but if you have this\r\n\r\ntype  of  democratic principles  applied,  it  will\r\n\r\nnever work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am tired of all the views put forward by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  about  delays. The  Government  has  one\r\n\r\nsingle  idea in its mind and that is to steamroller\r\n\r\neverything  in  accordance  with  its  wishes.  The\r\n\r\nprinciple  that the people should have a  voice  in\r\n\r\ntheir  affairs is clearly stated in the two clauses\r\n\r\n5  and 15. In the case of clause 5, the excuse  is,\r\n\r\n\"Please  do  not delay.\" Of course, the  delay  had\r\n\r\nalways  been  the  fault  of  Government.  In  this\r\n\r\ninstance,  Sir,  we  are  not  going  to  hold  the\r\n\r\nDistrict Council elections in December. I hope that\r\n\r\nthe Government will not change its mind again. I do\r\n\r\nnot think that the electoral rolls are already made\r\n\r\nup.  I  do  not think that the boundaries are  also\r\n\r\nmade  up. I hope certainly that Government  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  appoint another committee and  then  put\r\n\r\nforth  everything cut and dried before us and  say,\r\n\r\n\"Accept  or  you will not have your elections.\"  If\r\n\r\nwhat I have been thinking is correct, there is time\r\n\r\nfor  Government to allow the people to have a voice\r\n\r\nas to whether they want to be in one District or in\r\n\r\nanother.  Four successive Gazettes and  publication\r\n\r\nin  the  papers will only take another four  weeks.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it should not take more than two months\r\n\r\nto  consider  all  that.  The  difference  in  time\r\n\r\nbetween  the  City Council election and  the  rural\r\n\r\nDistrict Council election will be round about 4  or\r\n\r\n5  months. You have ample time to do that.  Let  us\r\n\r\nsee  that Government get on with the work  so  that\r\n\r\nthese  people can at least perceive that Government\r\n\r\nis   going  to  adhere  to  the  principle  it  has\r\n\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge this Government not to crow when every\r\n\r\ntime  the  Opposition puts up an amendment  and  is\r\n\r\ndefeated, it says, \"Look, your amendment  has  been\r\n\r\ndefeated.\" Let the Government remember that we  are\r\n\r\nhere to voice the opinion of the people. Whether we\r\n\r\nare  defeated or not, it does not matter.  We  have\r\n\r\nour  duty to perform to our constituents.  Let  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  remember, Sir, that  they  are  not  in\r\n\r\nabsolute  majority.  Let the Government  know  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  three official votes and four nominated\r\n\r\nvotes.

It is a policy  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government and I congratulate  them  for  that\r\n\r\npolicy.  But much earlier than this year,  most  of\r\n\r\nthe  Members sitting on the Government Benches made\r\n\r\npromises  during their election campaigns that,  if\r\n\r\nelected,  they  would try to reduce  the  rents  of\r\n\r\nS.I.T. houses. I can speak with some authority  on\r\n\r\nthis  because  at that time I was a member  of  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front and it was a platform of  the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  to  reduce  rentals  on  S.I.T. houses,  if\r\n\r\nelected.  Apart  from myself  who  also  made  that\r\n\r\npromise, I think members of other Parties made  the\r\n\r\nsame promise also because at that time when it  was\r\n\r\nelection time all sorts of promises were made,  not\r\n\r\ncaring whether they could be carried out or not. If\r\n\r\nmy   memory  is  correct,  at  one  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmeetings,  the P.A.P. even quoted figures  to  show\r\n\r\nhow  such rents could be reduced by granting  loans\r\n\r\nto the S.I.T. without interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the Government done so far apart from\r\n\r\nintroducing that White\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPaper? I do not see anything. The only benefit that\r\n\r\ncan  be  seen  so far is the abolition  of  service\r\n\r\ncharges on the old S.I.T. houses. How much did that\r\n\r\namount to: a matter of a dollar, two dollars or  to\r\n\r\nfive  dollars? Would that relieve the  poor  tenant\r\n\r\nvery  much, a matter of reduction from one to  five\r\n\r\ndollars? I doubt whether that would give relief  to\r\n\r\nthe tenant very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks to me now, Sir, that all those who made\r\n\r\npromises  at the time of election are not any  more\r\n\r\ninterested.  \"Why  bother?  I  have  already   been\r\n\r\nelected  and  I  am  now  in  this  Assembly.\"  But\r\n\r\npromises  will be made again when the next  general\r\n\r\nelection comes round again next year or earlier.  I\r\n\r\nwill quote, Sir, paragraph 13 of the White Paper:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is clear that considerable subsidisation will\r\n\r\nhave to be undertaken. Sites, particularly in urban\r\n\r\nareas,  are becoming more difficult and  costly  to\r\n\r\nacquire  and  prepare for building. Buildings  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  of solid and substantial  design  and\r\n\r\nconstruction if sites, particularly those in  urban\r\n\r\nareas,  are to be developed with the maximum degree\r\n\r\nof  efficiency, having regard to locality,  density\r\n\r\nof  population  and other planning  considerations.\r\n\r\nThe  economic  rents  of  these  buildings,  having\r\n\r\nregard  to  the cost of acquisition and preparation\r\n\r\nof  sites and to the cost of construction, will  in\r\n\r\nmost  cases  exceed the rents which are within  the\r\n\r\ncapacity  to pay of the sections of the public  for\r\n\r\nwhom  the houses are built. The difference  between\r\n\r\nthe   economic  rent  and  the  rents   which   the\r\n\r\nprospective tenants can pay will have to be met  by\r\n\r\nsubsidy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  Sir, this paragraph 13 clearly indicates that\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  prepared to  reduce  the  rents  of\r\n\r\nhouses  which are to be built to a level  which  is\r\n\r\nwithin the pocket of the common man. At the sitting\r\n\r\nwhen  the  White  Paper was tabled, the  Government\r\n\r\nannounced  that  only new houses  built  after  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of that White Paper would be benefited\r\n\r\nand that that privilege would not be granted to the\r\n\r\nold  houses because the old houses were built at  a\r\n\r\nhigher  interest or so. Why, Sir, should  there  be\r\n\r\ndiscrimination between the old houses and  the  new\r\n\r\nhouses?  Are  they not all S.I.T. properties?  Why\r\n\r\nshould one section of the S.I.T. tenants benefit by\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper and another section of the  S.I.T.\r\n\r\ntenants  be  charged  at a higher  rental?  I  will\r\n\r\nquote, Sir, an answer that was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven  to  me  by the Minister in his reply  to  my\r\n\r\nquestion  regarding  Singapore  Improvement   Trust\r\n\r\nFlats  in  Albert/Prinsep/Short Streets: Government\r\n\r\nSubsidy. I asked the Minister for Local Government,\r\n\r\nLands  and Housing if he will give complete figures\r\n\r\npertaining to the Singapore Improvement Trust flats\r\n\r\nin  Albert/Prinsep/Short Streets showing  how  the\r\n\r\namount of Government subsidy in respect thereof  is\r\n\r\ncalculated and the answer I got was:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The method of subsidy by Government on S.I.T.\r\n\r\nhousing is outlined in the Government White  Paper,\r\n\r\nNo.  Cmd. 6 of 1957. The subsidy is not related  to\r\n\r\nany  particular  scheme but is in fact  the  amount\r\n\r\nrequired  to  make  up the annual  deficit  in  the\r\n\r\nTrust's   Housing  Account.  It  is  not   possible\r\n\r\ntherefore  to  give  any exact calculation  of  the\r\n\r\nsubsidy  in  respect  of the Albert  Street/Prinsep\r\n\r\nStreet/Short Street scheme for which there  can  be\r\n\r\nin any case no complete figures until the buildings\r\n\r\nare completed. The approximate figure of $30 to $40\r\n\r\ngiven in oral answer to a question by Mr Lim Choon\r\n\r\nMong   at  the  last  meeting  of  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  as the subsidy for the $35/30  p.m. two-room flat is the best estimate which can be given.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now  then, the Minister himself is not sure of  the\r\n\r\namount  of subsidy that would be granted to  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nhouses whether they be new houses or old houses. He\r\n\r\nhimself  is not certain what the amount of  subsidy\r\n\r\nwould  be.  Now,  are the Prinsep Street  or  Short\r\n\r\nStreet  houses  not  completed yet?  He  says  that\r\n\r\nunless they are completed, he is not able to give a\r\n\r\ncorrect  figure. They have been completed long  ago\r\n\r\nand  complaints  of grievances  have  come  to  the\r\n\r\nknowledge  of the Minister through some Members  of\r\n\r\nthis Assembly. Why has he not looked into them?  He\r\n\r\nhas  no reply other than to say that the method  of\r\n\r\nsubsidy  is  contained in No. Cmd. 6 of 1957.  Well\r\n\r\nthat  Paper is here and I think everyone  has  read\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this year, Sir, the City Council and the\r\n\r\nGovernment   have   shirked  their   responsibility\r\n\r\ntowards  this housing subsidy and the reason  given\r\n\r\nby these two organisations is that the S.I.T. is  a\r\n\r\nstatutory   body  which  is  of   no   concern   to\r\n\r\nGovernment.   During   my  application   for   this\r\n\r\nadjournment speech, I included\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  allocation  of S.I.T. houses, but  you,  Sir,\r\n\r\nhave ruled me out that it does not come within  the\r\n\r\npurview  of the Ministry. For all purposes,  it  is\r\n\r\nmost convenient for the Minister to say that he has\r\n\r\ngot no control -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is out of\r\n\r\norder  in referring to a matter in which he himself\r\n\r\nhad been ruled out of order by the Speaker. Will he\r\n\r\nplease confine his remarks to Government subsidy on\r\n\r\nS.I.T. rentals?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Yes, Sir. I am just passing a\r\n\r\nremark that the Minister is always trying to  shirk\r\n\r\nhis  responsibility by saying that it does not come\r\n\r\nwithin his control at all. I am just only making  a\r\n\r\npassing  remark  on  that and not  in  fact  making\r\n\r\nreference to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we have an elected Government, not a\r\n\r\ncolonial  Government. At the time when  the  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nwas managed by a Board of Trustees, it was under  a\r\n\r\ncolonial  Government.  Today,  out  of  those  nine\r\n\r\nBenches on the opposite side, five are elected, one\r\n\r\nis nominated and three are ex-officio Members which\r\n\r\nclearly  indicate  that  there  is  a  majority  of\r\n\r\nelected  Ministers  in  the  Government.  Can  this\r\n\r\nelected  Government  now shirk its  responsibility?\r\n\r\nCan  this  elected Government which  made  promises\r\n\r\nduring   the   election   campaign   shirk    their\r\n\r\nresponsibility in that they have got nothing to  do\r\n\r\nwith housing subsidy? I doubt they are prepared  to\r\n\r\ndo so because election is coming very near - a matter\r\n\r\nof  another  year - and  the election  campaign  will\r\n\r\nstart  in  a matter of a few months. Did Government\r\n\r\nnot  also make a promise that they would set  up  a\r\n\r\nHousing  Authority  which  would  come  under   the\r\n\r\ncontrol of the Minister for Local Government?  When\r\n\r\nwe  have  that Housing Authority, then the Minister\r\n\r\nwill  say, \"Ah, this is within my Ministry  and  my\r\n\r\nportfolio.  I  will  look into it.\"  For  how  many\r\n\r\nmonths have the Government promised to set up  that\r\n\r\nHousing  Authority? So far, nothing has been  heard\r\n\r\nabout  it  except the Malayanisation of the  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nand the protest by the employees of the S.I.T. When\r\n\r\ncan  this Housing Authority be set up? We have  yet\r\n\r\nto see it. These promises here and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere come in when election time comes round. I  am\r\n\r\nquite  sure  that  by the time  the  life  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly expires, the Housing Authority will  still\r\n\r\nbe  in  thin air. I doubt there will be  a  Housing\r\n\r\nAuthority.   The   Government  should   set   their\r\n\r\nmachinery straightaway and then set up this Housing\r\n\r\nAuthority with the subsidy that the Government  are\r\n\r\nprepared to offer to old and new tenants of  S.I.T.\r\n\r\nhouses,  not  to  discriminate  one  section   from\r\n\r\nanother,  but to all S.I.T. tenants who  pay  their\r\n\r\nrents   to  the  S.I.T. or  to  this  new  Housing\r\n\r\nAuthority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.11 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, in my Oral and Written Answers to the\r\n\r\nQuestions  in  the  Assembly during  the  last  few\r\n\r\nmonths,  I have been at some pains to explain  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  subsidy  policy  is  contained  in\r\n\r\nSessional  Paper  No. Cmd. 6 of 1957.  The  subsidy\r\n\r\nwhich  Government provides is not  related  to  any\r\n\r\nparticular scheme for housing whether in Queenstown\r\n\r\nor  Kallang or in Albert Street or anywhere in  the\r\n\r\nisland  but  it  is operative over  all  the  Trust\r\n\r\nhousing estates. The total subsidy is in effect the\r\n\r\namount  required to make up the annual  deficit  in\r\n\r\nthe  Trust Housing Account as embodied in the White\r\n\r\nPaper  and  I  will now, Sir, proceed to  read  the\r\n\r\nrelevant paragraph. The Member for Queenstown  read\r\n\r\nparagraph  13.  I  think  it  should  be  read   in\r\n\r\nconjunction  with  paragraph  19.  This   is   what\r\n\r\nparagraph 19 has to say, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"This Housing Account will contain, on the Income\r\n\r\nside,  the  proceeds  of  rents  from  all  housing\r\n\r\nerected by the Trust and by the Authority, that is,\r\n\r\nrent   from  pre-war  properties  which  arc  still\r\n\r\nsubject to rent control, from the properties  which\r\n\r\nhave  been  built since the war, and from  all  the\r\n\r\nproperties  which will be built in connection  with\r\n\r\nslum clearance and other schemes in the future.  On\r\n\r\nthe   same   side  of  the  account   will   appear\r\n\r\ncontributions   from   tenants   in   respect    of\r\n\r\nconservancy  and  service charges and  income  from\r\n\r\nmiscellaneous sources. On the Expenditure side will\r\n\r\nappear  the  cost of administration of the  Housing\r\n\r\nAuthority,  the  cost of designing and  supervising\r\n\r\nthe  erection  of new buildings, and  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nmanaging the housing estates. On this side  of  the\r\n\r\naccount also will appear contributions to the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  in  respect  of  rates  (rents  on  public\r\n\r\nhousing  include  rates),  payments  to  the   City\r\n\r\nCouncil in respect of conservancy and service\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharges,    maintenance   of   buildings,    annual\r\n\r\ncontributions to a Repairs Fund. Lastly, payment of\r\n\r\ninterest  and repayment of principal on  all  loans\r\n\r\nfrom the Government for housing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So,  Sir, if the Member for Queenstown were to read\r\n\r\nparagraph 14 in conjunction with paragraph 19, I am\r\n\r\nsure  he will understand what is the policy of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment on subsidy of S.I.T. rentals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are\r\n\r\none   or  two  remarks  made  by  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown which might be misleading to this House.\r\n\r\nOne is that the S.I.T. is controlled by the elected\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Sir,  there is still  in  existence  a\r\n\r\nBoard   of  Trustees  and  the  only  control   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has on the S.I.T. is in regard  to  the\r\n\r\nnew  buildings of the S.I.T. The houses  that  they\r\n\r\nare  now  putting  up are covered by  this  housing\r\n\r\nsubsidy policy laid down by the Government. In  all\r\n\r\nother respects, the Board of Trustees of the S.I.T.\r\n\r\ntake their own decisions even as regards the fixing\r\n\r\nof  rents of shops. Government decides the rents of\r\n\r\nthe new houses bearing in mind two things: the type\r\n\r\nof  accommodation provided and the ability  of  the\r\n\r\ntenant,  who is going to occupy that accommodation,\r\n\r\nto  pay.  That is laid down in the housing  subsidy\r\n\r\npolicy  in Paper No. Cmd. 6 of 1957. Therefore,  it\r\n\r\nis  not  right  for  the hon. Member  to  say  that\r\n\r\nbecause  we have an elected Government to ask  what\r\n\r\nthe  elected Government has done about  the  rents,\r\n\r\nand  so on. But one thing is clear and that is when\r\n\r\nthe  Labour Front went out for elections  in  April\r\n\r\n1955,  there  was a promise that we  would  try  to\r\n\r\nreduce   the  rate  of  interest  charged  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to the S.I.T. for putting up the houses.\r\n\r\nNow, I believe that the rate of interest charged at\r\n\r\nthat   time - I  am  not  the  Minister   for   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment;  but  I do remember certain  things - was\r\n\r\nround about 4 per cent and the promise that we made\r\n\r\nto  the  electorate was that we would try to reduce\r\n\r\nit  to 2 per cent. A reduction of the interest rate\r\n\r\nby  about  2 per cent would have probably  given  a\r\n\r\nreduction in the rental by about $8 or so,  whereas\r\n\r\nnow  (if  you see the new houses that are built  in\r\n\r\nShort  Street and Albert Street) according  to  the\r\n\r\nnew  housing subsidy policy, the reduction  in  the\r\n\r\nrentals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  far  greater. Normally the economic  rent  for\r\n\r\nthat type of house, according to the present cost,\r\n\r\nwould  be somewhere in the region of about $60  to\r\n\r\n$70  and the Government has fixed the rents at $35\r\n\r\nfor  newcomers and $30 for people who are  cleared\r\n\r\nout  from  slum areas. Therefore, the  subsidy  is\r\n\r\nbetween  $30  and $40 per house. My contention  is\r\n\r\nthat  you  could  never  have  achieved  such  low\r\n\r\nrentals  if  we  had  just  reduced  the  rate  of\r\n\r\ninterest by 2 per cent or even if we had abolished\r\n\r\nthe  rate  of interest entirely. It is because  of\r\n\r\nthis bold subsidy policy that the tenants of those\r\n\r\nhouses   are   going  to  enjoy  a  much   greater\r\n\r\nreduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to make is that the\r\n\r\ndecision  to  waive conservancy and other  charges\r\n\r\nhas  resulted  in  a reduction of  $10  on  Manila\r\n\r\nStreet flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some cases, it is $2; in some it is $5, but in\r\n\r\nthe case of Manila fiats, if I am not mistaken, it\r\n\r\nis $10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr T.
