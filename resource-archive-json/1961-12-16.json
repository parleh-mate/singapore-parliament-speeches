P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there\r\n\r\nis one point on which I wish to touch, and that is Head\r\n\r\n33  in  the  Schedule - Charge on Account of  the  Public\r\n\r\nDebt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first occasion when the Budget was presented to\r\n\r\nthe Assembly by the present Government, I raised one or\r\n\r\ntwo  queries on the items set out under Head 33- Charge\r\n\r\non  Account  of the Public Debt - and you,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nruled  me  out  of  order because they  were  statutory\r\n\r\ndebts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under Head 33, the total figure to\r\n\r\nbe  allocated is set out on page 350 of the  Estimates,\r\n\r\nand  on  pages  41 and 42 is an abstract  of  estimated\r\n\r\nexpenditure  for  the  year  1962,  showing   statutory\r\n\r\nexpenditure and the amounts to be voted. Now under Head\r\n\r\n33,  the  statutory expenditure is $20,549,310 and  the\r\n\r\namount  to  be  voted  by the Legislative  Assembly  is\r\n\r\n$1,500,710. When one examines these items, one  notices\r\n\r\ntwo  points.  The first point I wish to  bring  to  the\r\n\r\nattention  of the House is subheads 4 and 5. Subhead  4\r\n\r\nis  Discount on Treasury Bills . . . . $1,500,000,  and\r\n\r\nsubhead 5 is Interest on Treasury Deposits .... $1,600,000. The point I wish to make is that these\r\n\r\ntwo  subheads  appear  as  statutory  expenditure  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  the  Assembly  has  no  control  over   its\r\n\r\nexpenditure. But the difficulty here is that these  are\r\n\r\ninterest payments on debts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich   are   not  yet  incurred  and,  therefore,   my\r\n\r\ncontention is that any interest payment on debt not yet\r\n\r\nincurred is not a public debt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 97(4) of the Singapore (Constitution) Order in\r\n\r\nCouncil,   1958,  sets  out  the  heads  of   statutory\r\n\r\nexpenditure and one of such heads is section 100  which\r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The public debt of Singapore is hereby charged on the\r\n\r\nConsolidated Fund.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What  I  would like to ask the Minister for Finance  is\r\n\r\nthis.  If  he  does not raise money by way of  Treasury\r\n\r\nbills or does not take in Treasury deposits, then these\r\n\r\ntwo sums do not become payable by way of interest. That\r\n\r\nbeing so, how can he then come to the Assembly and  say\r\n\r\nthat  this  is  statutory  expenditure  and  that   the\r\n\r\nAssembly has no control over it? This seems  to  be  a\r\n\r\nleft-handed way by means of which Government can  raise\r\n\r\nmoney  without  the consent and, if  I  may  say,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwithout  the  knowledge of the Assembly  regarding  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  expenditure. Assuming that a  discount  on\r\n\r\nTreasury bills is obtained at an average rate  of  five\r\n\r\nper cent interest, then under subhead 4, Govermnent can\r\n\r\nborrow about $30 million for 1962. Similarly, they can\r\n\r\nborrow  another $30 million by way of Treasury deposits\r\n\r\nunder  subhead  5.  So  that  the  Government  is  then\r\n\r\nenabled,  by the use of subheads 4 and 5, to borrow  up\r\n\r\nto  $60 million without the consent of the House.  That\r\n\r\nis the first point, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point to which I wish to draw the attention\r\n\r\nof  the Minister for Finance is this. Under subhead  10\r\n\r\non  page  350  of  the Estimates, there  is  a  sum  of\r\n\r\n$1,500,000  which appears as Repay ment of  War  Damage\r\n\r\nInterest-Free Loan, but that apparently is not a public\r\n\r\ndebt.  Although  it seems to be a debt which  is  being\r\n\r\npaid  out  of  the Consolidated Fund, yet it  does  not\r\n\r\nappear  under  Head 33 as a Charge on  Account  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Debt, because the Minister is, in fact,  asking\r\n\r\nthe Assembly to vote $1.5 million for the repayment  of\r\n\r\nwar  damage  interest-free loan. Perhaps  the  Minister\r\n\r\nmight care to explain to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse why it is that this particular debt is treated as\r\n\r\nif it were not a public debt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Goh, in reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I have been assured of the\r\n\r\ncorrectness  of  regarding interest  paid  on  Treasury\r\n\r\nbills  and Treasury deposits as coming within the terms\r\n\r\nof  Charge on Account of the Public Debt. Therefore, it\r\n\r\nis  statutory  expenditure which need not  require  the\r\n\r\nassent  of  this  House before it is paid.  However,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the Member for Farrer Park has a point, that  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  long-term le2ns, it is necessary  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  seek the approval of the  House - at  any\r\n\r\nrate  as  regards  the maximum limit to  which  we  can\r\n\r\nborrow  by way of loans from the public. But as regards\r\n\r\nthe Treasury bills and Treasury deposits, reference  to\r\n\r\nthis  House is not necessary. I am not quite sure  what\r\n\r\nthe legal position is in this respect, because Treasury\r\n\r\nbills  have  the  authority of an Ordinance  which  was\r\n\r\npassed  by the former Legislature, and I am not certain\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not  any ceiling has been imposed  on  the\r\n\r\namount that Government can so borrow. It could well  be\r\n\r\nthat a ceiling has been imposed under that Ordinance on\r\n\r\nthe  amount  that could be borrowed by  the  Government\r\n\r\nthrough Treasury bills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second point, that is the repayment of\r\n\r\nwar  damage interest-free loan, the position  is  this.\r\n\r\nBefore  World War II, there was a compulsory war damage\r\n\r\ninsurance   scheme  to  which  various  categories   of\r\n\r\nbusiness  were required to contribute. After  the  war,\r\n\r\nthe damage was assessed and large amounts were paid out\r\n\r\nby  way of war damage compensation. The funds available\r\n\r\nunder the war damage insurance scheme were not adequate\r\n\r\nto  meet  all the claims for war damage, and  the  U.K.\r\n\r\nGovernment  had to come to the assistance of  both  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government and the Federation Government.  I\r\n\r\nthink  this was in 1948 or thereabouts - just a few years\r\n\r\nafter  the  end of the Second World War.  Part  of  the\r\n\r\nfinancial assistance was made by way of grants and part\r\n\r\nwas  made  by way of interest-free loans. Although  the\r\n\r\nloan carried no interest, it is necessary,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  course, to make annual repayments of principal, and\r\n\r\nthis is the contribution which the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nhas to make to the U.K. Government in repayment of this\r\n\r\nloan. There is still another 15 years to go. I think it\r\n\r\nis  for this reason that the repayment of this loan has\r\n\r\nnot  been regarded legally to fall within the terms  of\r\n\r\nCharge on Account of the Public Debt as defined in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Third Reading</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Third Reading.

The origins of  the  University\r\n\r\ncould  be  traced back to the founding in Singapore  of\r\n\r\nthe  King  Edward VII College of Medicine in  1905  and\r\n\r\nRaffles  College in 1929.

Although  the  Commission\r\n\r\nrecommended  that  the  two Colleges  should  form  the\r\n\r\nnucleus of the new University, it also anticipated  the\r\n\r\nrapid   demand  for  higher  education  in  a   swiftly\r\n\r\nexpanding population of the two territories, and so  it\r\n\r\nrecommended  that  the new University  should  consider\r\n\r\nmoving into South Johore in order that future expansion\r\n\r\nwould not be hindered for lack of space. However,  this\r\n\r\ndid  not  materialise  because  of  the  enormous  cost\r\n\r\ninvolved, and the scheme had to be abandoned in\r\n\r\n1954.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1957 a Commission of Inquiry headed by Dr R. S.\r\n\r\nAitken  was set up by the Governments of Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe  Federation,  this  time  at  the  request  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity,   in  order  to  review  the  constitution,\r\n\r\nworking, and finances of the University in the light of\r\n\r\nexperience and rapid expansion of the last seven years,\r\n\r\nand  of  the prospective expansion in the near  future,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  plan for developing the  University  in\r\n\r\nKuala Lumpur, and to make recommendations. Arising from\r\n\r\nthe   Commission's  Report  and  resulting   from   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations   of  the  two  joint   Committees   on\r\n\r\nConstitution   and  Finance  appointed   by   the   two\r\n\r\nGovernments,  legislation was passed in  November  1958\r\n\r\nproviding  for  the  continuance of the  University  of\r\n\r\nMalaya   as   a   single  university   but   with   the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of two largely autonomous  Divisions  of\r\n\r\nequal  status, one in Singapore and the other at  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur.  This  legislation came  into  effect  on  15th\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The University's running expenses continued to be met\r\n\r\nfrom  grants from the Governments of Singapore and  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya, hitherto made on a  quinquennial\r\n\r\nbasis  in  the ratio 40 : 60, on the basis  of  student\r\n\r\nnumbers from the two territories. But in 1959 they were\r\n\r\namended to a triennial basis for the period 1959-61 and\r\n\r\nthe  ratio  changed to a basis of 1:  2.  It  was  also\r\n\r\nexpected   that  by  1962  each  Government  would   be\r\n\r\nresponsible for looking after its own Division  and  at\r\n\r\nthe same time contributing towards the annual recurrent\r\n\r\ncost of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe other Division in respect of its students attending\r\n\r\ncourses  not  available  in its own  Division.  Capital\r\n\r\ngrants, however, would continue to be made on an  equal\r\n\r\nbasis during the triennium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 1960 the Governments of Singapore and the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya  indicated  their  intention  to\r\n\r\nestablish autonomous separate national universities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the  Federation  by  1962.  Steps  were\r\n\r\naccordingly  taken in both territories to  redraft  new\r\n\r\nconstitutions for each Division to found  two  separate\r\n\r\nnational universities. At the request of the Divisional\r\n\r\nCouncil   of   the  University  of  Malaya   (Singapore\r\n\r\nDivision),  a joint Government/University committee  of\r\n\r\nseven  were  appointed  in  June  this  year  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose.  And  the present draft Bill was submitted  to\r\n\r\nboth  the Divisional Senate and Divisional Council  for\r\n\r\ntheir  views.  I  might add that  the  Singapore  Joint\r\n\r\nGovernment/University  Committee  were  in  the   happy\r\n\r\nposition  of  being able to use the draft Bill  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation's Joint Government/University Committee  in\r\n\r\nits  deliberations.  On  the whole,  our  Bill  closely\r\n\r\nfollows the present pattern of the Constitution of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Malaya so that a feeling of  continuity\r\n\r\nwith the old is being maintained. The present Bill  has\r\n\r\nalso incorporated all material points suggested by both\r\n\r\nthe Divisional Senates and Council of the University of\r\n\r\nMalaya  (Singapore Division). Our Bill is also  closely\r\n\r\nin  line  with the main provision of the University  of\r\n\r\nMalaya   Act   which  was  passed  in  the   Federation\r\n\r\nParliament this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should now like to enumerate the important\r\n\r\ndifferences between the provisions of the present  Bill\r\n\r\nwith   those  of  the  present  Constitution   of   the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Malaya Ordinance, No. 12 of 1949, and  as\r\n\r\nfurther  amended  by  Ordinance  No.  7  of  1954   and\r\n\r\nOrdinance  No.  44  of  1958.  Firstly,  there  was  no\r\n\r\nprovision  in  the  past for the  University  to  grant\r\n\r\nexternal  degrees.  Our draft Bill permits  this  under\r\n\r\nclause   4  (b)  (ii)  at  page  9,  Part  II  of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution.

Although for sentimental\r\n\r\nreasons we may regret that there cannot be one national\r\n\r\nuniversity  to serve the whole of Malaya, yet  we  know\r\n\r\nthat for practical purposes, this means that instead of\r\n\r\none university, we shall have two, and altogether three\r\n\r\nUniversities in Malaya, including Nanyang University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 15 years ago, when the Carr-Saunders Commission\r\n\r\nwas  here, there were still doubts whether there should\r\n\r\nbe a university. They were thinking even in terms of  a\r\n\r\nuniversity college. Yet within 15 years, we have  three\r\n\r\nuniversities.  I  am sure that within one  more  decade\r\n\r\npeople  in  northern Malaya may be thinking of  another\r\n\r\nuniversity to be sited in Penang or in Ipoh. Then with\r\n\r\nthis  idea of a united Malaysia coming to fruition,  we\r\n\r\ncan expect Singapore will continue to be very important\r\n\r\nas  an  educational centre for South-East Asia. I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  we  shall  be  drawing  students  not  only  from\r\n\r\nSingapore but also from the neighbouring regions.  Sir,\r\n\r\nI notice that in page 2, paragraph 2 of the Bill, there\r\n\r\nis  a statement to assure that each university will  be\r\n\r\nautonomous.  Sir,  I  am sorry that  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  is  not present in the House  today.  I  have\r\n\r\nasked  a few members of the staff of the University  to\r\n\r\ntake part in politics, and they have expressed the view\r\n\r\nthat  they  were  not  very sure  whether  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment would show the same\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndegree  of tolerance as the previous Government did.  I\r\n\r\nhope  that the present Government will be able to  give\r\n\r\nus  the assurance that there will be the same degree of\r\n\r\ncourtesy given, and that the Barisan Sosialis will also\r\n\r\ngive  the  same  assurance in case they  ever  come  to\r\n\r\npower:  that is, if any member of the University  staff\r\n\r\nshould  want to take part in politics in an  opposition\r\n\r\ngroup,  then they would have the same courtesy as  they\r\n\r\nhad  before.

It  is  true  that  the  Division  of   the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Malaya  has been spurred  by  political\r\n\r\nmotivations.  But I do say, Sir, that the  requirements\r\n\r\nof the two territories, and certainly, the requirements\r\n\r\nof   this  territory,  can  only  be  fulfilled  by   a\r\n\r\nuniversity here in Singapore. We have room aplenty  for\r\n\r\ntwo  universities, one in the English  language  stream\r\n\r\nand  one in the Chinese language stream. I do not  view\r\n\r\nthe establishment \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof an autonomous university as being in  any\r\n\r\nway derogatory to the unity of this area. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nthere  are political divisions which separate us.  The\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Malaya, which was a single  unit,  did\r\n\r\nassist, I believe, very considerably in bringing about\r\n\r\na  common approach anti understanding between students\r\n\r\nfrom Singapore and the Federation. I believe this will\r\n\r\ncontinue  despite the division of the  University,  by\r\n\r\nthe  need  of each territory to send students  to  the\r\n\r\nother territory to study in those faculties which  are\r\n\r\nabsent in the local University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another aspect, Sir, which engages me and\r\n\r\ncompels  me  to  rise  to sneak  this  afternoon.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Education has  told  us,  and  told  us\r\n\r\ncorrectly, that   a  university   is   a   national\r\n\r\ninstitution.  Sir,  it is a national  institution  not\r\n\r\nmerely for the dissemination of knowledge but also for\r\n\r\nthe  advancement of knowledge, as I think you will see\r\n\r\nstated  in clause 4 (a) of the Schedule. That  is  the\r\n\r\ndistinction  between  a  university  and  a  technical\r\n\r\ncollege.   In   a  technical  college,   you   acquire\r\n\r\nknowledge.  In a university you do not merely  acquire\r\n\r\nknowledge,  but  you  also  expand  the  frontiers  of\r\n\r\nknowledge. That is by far the more important  function\r\n\r\nof  a  university, that it should keep alive the human\r\n\r\nspirit  of inquiry, research and independent thinking.\r\n\r\nBefore   our  youth  can  be  trained  in  independent\r\n\r\nthinking, there must be academic freedom for those  in\r\n\r\nwhose  care  they  are - the  academic  staff.   My\r\n\r\ncomplaint about this Bill is that it does not  provide\r\n\r\nfor  the  protection of academic freedom.

I drew\r\n\r\nthe  attention  of the Principal of the University  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  in Singapore to the need for clarification  of\r\n\r\nthe  public in respect of certain matters which  arose\r\n\r\non these constitutional issues. I pointed out that, in\r\n\r\nmy view, there was a responsibility on the part of the\r\n\r\nacademic staff of the University to assist the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  and their elected representatives,  and\r\n\r\nasked  whether  he  would have  any  objection  to  my\r\n\r\napproaching  a certain professor of international  law\r\n\r\nwith  a  view of obtaining his views on constitutional\r\n\r\nissues  raised by the joint statements issued  by  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Ministers.  I said \"I...write  to  you  to  ask\r\n\r\nwhether  you agree a member of the academic  staff  of\r\n\r\nthe University can properly advise political parties...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I did not ask for permission to do so, because,\r\n\r\nto my mind, a member of the academic staff requires no\r\n\r\npermission   to   indulge  in  such  extra   curricula\r\n\r\nactivities as he thinks proper so long as they do  not\r\n\r\nencroach  upon the time required for the discharge  of\r\n\r\nhis responsibilities to the University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I received a reply which slated, in effect, that\r\n\r\nthe  University is prepared to permit individual full-time  staff  of  the Law Faculty to  give  the  advice\r\n\r\nrequested if the request is made by the Speaker and is\r\n\r\naddressed  to  the  Principal.  Sir,  I  thought,   in\r\n\r\nfairness, I should have read the lot, but I  now  will\r\n\r\ntable  it.  I can only say this. I take a  very  grave\r\n\r\nview   of   what  I  consider  to  be  the   lack   of\r\n\r\nunderstanding  displayed  in  that  letter  of  basic,\r\n\r\nacademic  traditions.  And there  are  two  traditions\r\n\r\naffected.   One  is  the  freedom  of  the  individual\r\n\r\nacademician in his unfettered discretion to advise  or\r\n\r\nnot to advise such person or organisation as he thinks\r\n\r\nfit   on  such  matters  as  are  within  his  special\r\n\r\ncompetence, without any interference of any  character\r\n\r\nwhatsoever, on the part of his colleagues or the Vice-Chancellor.  The other tradition is the responsibility\r\n\r\nof  the University and its teaching staff to recognise\r\n\r\nthat we do not subsidise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTomtits  in  ivory towers. That is  not  what  we  pay\r\n\r\nmillions of dollars for. It is an organisation for the\r\n\r\nadvancement  of learning to assist the nation  and  if\r\n\r\nand  when matters vital to the nation arise and  there\r\n\r\nis  an  honest  request for information  within  their\r\n\r\nspecific  field  of  competence,  then  they  have   a\r\n\r\nresponsibility to advise - a responsibility which, again\r\n\r\nin   their  discretion,  they  may  refuse,  for  good\r\n\r\nreasons, to comply with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wrote to the Principal seeking to avoid the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  a  misunderstanding.  At  length,   I\r\n\r\nfinally received a reply on the 22nd of this month  to\r\n\r\nsay that while a member of the University may, subject\r\n\r\nto limitations imposed by his contract and the ethical\r\n\r\ncode  of his profession, freely give advice to anyone,\r\n\r\nthe danger lies in the use to which such advice is put\r\n\r\nto.  He  would,  of course, he giving  advice  in  his\r\n\r\nindividual capacity, but the quotation of his  opinion\r\n\r\nby  a  political Party is bound to give  rise  to  the\r\n\r\nimpression  that  the University  is  involved  in  or\r\n\r\nsympathetic to any particular stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, though much more courteous in tone and to\r\n\r\nsome  extent  recognising basic academic rights,  this\r\n\r\nletter does substantially say that they are afraid  of\r\n\r\nbeing  involved in political controversies. Therefore,\r\n\r\nit would he his view (the Vice-Chancellor, the present\r\n\r\nPrincipal)  that members of the academic stall  should\r\n\r\nnot  give  advice and that they would  be  discouraged\r\n\r\nfrom doing so. It is indeed a pathetic commentary that\r\n\r\nthe  University of Singapore, on the eve of its birth,\r\n\r\nshould    fail   so   signally   to   recognise    its\r\n\r\nresponsibility to the people of Singapore, and display\r\n\r\na   lack   of  moral  courage  as  indicated  in   the\r\n\r\ncorrespondence to which I have referred  and  which  I\r\n\r\nwould  be happy not only to table here but to have  it\r\n\r\nquoted widely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the fear of the University as\r\n\r\ndisplayed by its Principal's letters arises  from  the\r\n\r\nconduct  of  this  Government with  reference  to  two\r\n\r\npersons. One has already been the subject of debate in\r\n\r\nthis House and that is the horror known as the Enright\r\n\r\nLetter. The other concerns the professor who,  in  the\r\n\r\nlegitimate  exercise of his discretion and within  his\r\n\r\nspecial field of competence,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad the temerity to advise the Member for Hong Lim who\r\n\r\nsought  his  advice.  I  do  not  know  exactly   what\r\n\r\ntranspired  thereafter, Like an  honourable  gentleman\r\n\r\nand a man of dignity, he never saw fit to complain, so\r\n\r\nfar as I know, to anybody. But it is widely recognised\r\n\r\nin  the  University  that, because of  his  legitimate\r\n\r\nactivity in advising a Member of this House on certain\r\n\r\nconstitutional  matters  which  affected   him,   that\r\n\r\nprofessor  came in for grave criticism from the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You heard the Member for Tanglin express to you what\r\n\r\nis  recognised  now  throughout the  University,  that\r\n\r\npolitical  activities will only be tolerated  if  they\r\n\r\narc  pro-P.A.P. If you invite the Prime Minister, Sir,\r\n\r\npermission  will  be  granted for  the  holding  of  a\r\n\r\nmeeting. If you invite Mr Lim Ching Siong, that  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  granted.  I  would urge that  the  Government\r\n\r\nitself  should give an undertaking that every contract\r\n\r\nof  every  member of the academic staff  will  include\r\n\r\nsome such clause as the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Every teacher shall be free in his unfettered\r\n\r\ndiscretion  to  advise any person or  organisation  on\r\n\r\nmatters   within  his  special  field  of  competence,\r\n\r\nprovided that such activity does not encroach  on  the\r\n\r\ndischarge of his responsibility to the University.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we cannot have freedom for the academic staff, we\r\n\r\ncannot  have  a  University.  It  will  merely  be   a\r\n\r\nuniversity in name, a technical college in fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House cannot be unconscious of the very genuine\r\n\r\nfears  of  the  academic stall of the  University  and\r\n\r\nthose whom it seeks to recruit, that here in Singapore\r\n\r\none  must mind one's P's and Q's, and if you annoy the\r\n\r\nGovernment, your visa is cancelled and you are in  for\r\n\r\nthe  high jump. Such conditions of intimidation cannot\r\n\r\nbring  out the best or cannot bring out anything  that\r\n\r\nis  really  valuable in the way of the development  of\r\n\r\nthe human spirit for our youth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Point of elucidation, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The two instances mentioned by the\r\n\r\nMember for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnson as being evidence that academic freedom is being\r\n\r\ncurbed   by   the  Government  related  to  expatriate\r\n\r\nprofessors,  and  I think the Government  has  clearly\r\n\r\nstated  its  stand on the participation of expatriates\r\n\r\nin  local political affairs. Does the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nnot take this stand of the Government to account?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nfor  himself admitting what I am asking this House  to\r\n\r\naccept. He now says, in effect, that any member of the\r\n\r\nacademic  staff  who, within his field of  competence,\r\n\r\nadvises   on  matters  which  may  have  a   political\r\n\r\nconnotation  is acting improperly and  will  be  dealt\r\n\r\nwith  by  the Government, just as I am saying,  and  I\r\n\r\ndisagree totally - but totally. I consider that stand to\r\n\r\nbe  barbaric  (if you permit the expression,  Sir,  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of the stand) and truly at variance with  the\r\n\r\nbasic   concept  of  academic  freedom.  II  Professor\r\n\r\nSheridan or Professor Groves, or any lawyer who is  an\r\n\r\nexpatriate, advises on questions of law any person  in\r\n\r\nthis  territory  in matters which may  have  political\r\n\r\nimplications,  I  say, Sir, he is absolutely  entitled\r\n\r\nto.  They  have  to  lecture on the legal  aspects  of\r\n\r\npolitics.  How can you seek to prevent them?  And  why\r\n\r\nshould  you seek to prevent them from advising on  the\r\n\r\nlegal aspects of politics? I say this, not only in the\r\n\r\nlegal  field  but in every other field,  Sir,In  the\r\n\r\nfield   of   culture,  about  which  the  P.A.P. are\r\n\r\njustifiably touchy, because they know so little of it,\r\n\r\nand like all ignorant people they are so terrified  of\r\n\r\nwhat they are ignorant of. But I protest vehemently in\r\n\r\nthis House against the suggestion that a member of the\r\n\r\nacademic  staff,  because he is an expatriate,  cannot\r\n\r\nadvise or lecture on matters within his special  field\r\n\r\nof   competence  if  such  matters  have  a  political\r\n\r\nconnotation  in  the context of local  politics.  What\r\n\r\ndoes  matter,  Sir, - and  in  this  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\ncompliment  the  Minister,  I  am  delighted  at   the\r\n\r\nprovision  for external degrees. It is  true,  as  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanglin has pointed out, that my  academic\r\n\r\ndegree  is an external one. Some of my friends in  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  say that that is an example of the  danger\r\n\r\nof external degrees! That certainly is one way one can\r\n\r\ntake it, Sir. But I think\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none  should recognise that in this area, where  poverty\r\n\r\nis  widespread, bursaries are only recent - and even  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will admit that they are not adequate - where\r\n\r\nmany  who  are adults cannot afford to pursue  academic\r\n\r\nstudies,  and  the provision of external degrees  would\r\n\r\nencourage them, to the greater benefit of Singapore - and\r\n\r\nnot   only   Singapore,  Sir.  We  know   that   London\r\n\r\nUniversity,   through   its   external   degrees,   has\r\n\r\ninfluenced  considerable areas of the world far  beyond\r\n\r\nthe shores of England. I say that if this provision for\r\n\r\nexternal degrees is imaginatively pursued in Singapore,\r\n\r\nwe can make a very valuable contribution to the culture\r\n\r\nof  South-East Asia - a contribution which would redound\r\n\r\nto our own benefit. I will naturally support the Second\r\n\r\nReading of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had hoped to have the assurance I asked for about\r\n\r\nacademic  freedom.

His political\r\n\r\nthinking in some ways is not the same as mine. We  have\r\n\r\ndifferent  ideas on different matters, but  in  certain\r\n\r\nareas  of thinking we agree. But I have never,  at  any\r\n\r\nmoment  during  our  ten years or  so  of  association,\r\n\r\nthought  that he was a man lacking in moral courage.  I\r\n\r\npersonally  felt  that  he was outstanding  insofar  as\r\n\r\nmoral  courage  was  concerned. If I remember  rightly,\r\n\r\nwhen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson was the first Chief Minister, and\r\n\r\nwas  speaking  and  governing Singapore  through  Press\r\n\r\nheadlines   every   day,  when  he  was   mooting   the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation Commission, he picked on Dr Sreenivasan\r\n\r\nas  the  most eminent and able man to carry out a  most\r\n\r\ndifficult  task  confronting Singapore at  that  stage.\r\n\r\n[Interruption]  But  he certainly did  not  lack  moral\r\n\r\ncourage then.

But  I  did  think, in fairness  to  someone\r\n\r\nabsent, I had to say something about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is just one matter on which I\r\n\r\nwish  to  speak  in  respect of this Bill.  During  the\r\n\r\nBudget  debate, I rose to speak on this, but you  ruled\r\n\r\nme out of order, Mr Speaker, Sir, because there was  a\r\n\r\nBill before the House. I personally regret that it  has\r\n\r\nbecome  necessary to separate the two  Universities.  I\r\n\r\nentirely agree with the previous speakers that there is\r\n\r\nmore   than   a   pressing  need  for  two   or   three\r\n\r\nuniversities. But I was of the view that all this could\r\n\r\nbe  done  within the ambit of the University of Malaya.\r\n\r\nHowever, Sir, since the position has been reached where\r\n\r\nthe  two Universities have been split, I think we  have\r\n\r\nto  make  the best of it. If this business of  the  so-called merger had come about two years earlier, perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Universities  need not have been  split.  However,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  split  has come. I think our  main  function\r\n\r\ntoday should be to try to keep the two Universities  as\r\n\r\nclosely  together as possible, to see  that  they  work\r\n\r\ntogether  in  such  a way that each of  them  uses  the\r\n\r\nfaculties  of  the other without duplicating  them  too\r\n\r\nmuch,  I  know  it  is necessary to  duplicate  certain\r\n\r\nfaculties in the interest of both countries, but  there\r\n\r\nare certain faculties which need not be duplicated. One\r\n\r\nfaculty in respect of some subjects will be enough  for\r\n\r\nboth the territories for some considerable time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the Court is an important institution in\r\n\r\nthe  University set-up and it has its place,  the  more\r\n\r\nimportant unit of the University is the University\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCouncil, both here and in the Federation. Sir, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  see  a  closer unity between  the  University\r\n\r\nCouncil in Singapore and the University Council in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya so that the policies of  the  two\r\n\r\nUniversities  would be kept as close to each  other  as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 on page 15 of the Bill sets cut the\r\n\r\ncomposition  of the Council. Under clause 16  (1)  (d),\r\n\r\nthe  Chancellor is given power to appoint not more than\r\n\r\nfour  persons.  I  was wondering whether  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwould not think it a good idea, and if he did think  it\r\n\r\na  good  idea to press this upon the University authori\r\n\r\nties,  to  make it possible for the Vice-Chancellor  of\r\n\r\neach  of  the Universities to sit in on the Council  of\r\n\r\nthe  other. The Vice-Chancellor knows what is going  On\r\n\r\nin  his  own University, and if the Vice-Chancellor  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya University could sit in on our\r\n\r\nCouncil, then his advice and his knowledge as  to  what\r\n\r\nis going on in Kuala Lumpur could be readily and easily\r\n\r\navailable to the Council here. Similarly, if our  Vice-Chancellor were to sit in on the Kuala Lumpur  Council,\r\n\r\nhis  knowledge would be available to the Council there,\r\n\r\nand  once  the  knowledge is made available,  then  the\r\n\r\nCouncils  could keep in line with each other.  That  is\r\n\r\nthe main point on which I wish to address the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of academic freedom, I myself have\r\n\r\nonce  or twice spoken in this House, and I do urge upon\r\n\r\nthe  Government  that  autonomy  means  nothing  unless\r\n\r\nacademic  freedom is possible. But the Government  says\r\n\r\nsomething  else. These are all matters which  are  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  at the moment from the Government  point  of\r\n\r\nview,  but  if academic freedom does impinge  upon  the\r\n\r\npolitical  field,  I  venture  to  suggest   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment should not take too serious a view of it  if\r\n\r\nit  is satisfied with the bona fides of the person  who\r\n\r\nis embarking on such ventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, originally I did not wish to take part in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  debate,  but  from what I  have  heard  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education it seems that he wants  to  make\r\n\r\nuse   of  this  Bill  to  establish  a  university   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  saying  that it is an  achievement  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  I am not convinced of this point and so I  want\r\n\r\nto stand up and say something about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, we must know that we want to pass\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  solely because Singapore is  in  a  passive\r\n\r\nposition.  It is because the Federation has a  national\r\n\r\nuniversity of its own and Singapore cannot make use  of\r\n\r\nits  facilities, and the name also cannot  be  used  by\r\n\r\nSingapore. If it is used, it does not mean that it is a\r\n\r\nnational  institution. Therefore,  this  University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  Bill  has  been  drafted  passively  due  to\r\n\r\npressure  exerted on Singapore. It is not anything  new\r\n\r\ndone  by  the  P.A.P. Government. This  point  must  be\r\n\r\nclarified.  We  must  not  take  this  as  a  sort   of\r\n\r\nachievement of the P.A.P. It does not mean that this is a\r\n\r\ngood result of the P.A.P.'s policy on education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, several Members have spoken on this\r\n\r\nmatter.  I  wish  to point out that the  University  of\r\n\r\nMalaya was established during colonial days and its aim\r\n\r\nwas  to serve colonial rule. Today cur country has  not\r\n\r\nachieved independence and the people of Singapore  have\r\n\r\nnot  achieved complete independence and have not joined\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  as  equals.  However,  if,  say,  our\r\n\r\nUniversity is only a semi-colonial university, and  you\r\n\r\nwant to talk of academic freedom for such a university,\r\n\r\nit  is really a dream, because I feel that only a  true\r\n\r\nuniversity  can  have  true  academic  freedom  in   an\r\n\r\nindependent country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the split of the University\r\n\r\ninto  two Divisions as provided in this Bill, it  seems\r\n\r\nthat the Guild of Graduates is also to be split. I hope\r\n\r\nthat in future graduates of both Universities will  not\r\n\r\nbe  separated and have the feeling that \"I am from  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Malaya and you are from the University of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"  If that is the case, then it will  not  be\r\n\r\ngood  for us, because having intellectuals with such  a\r\n\r\nconcept is detrimental to the unity of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  especially hope that in future all the graduates  of\r\n\r\nboth  Universities  will be treated  alike  as  far  as\r\n\r\nemployment  is concerned. There should not be  priority\r\n\r\nor privileges given to one University over the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I again hope that the P.A.P. Government will take\r\n\r\nclose  note  that in Singapore and the  Federation  the\r\n\r\ndesire  of  the  people to pursue higher  education  is\r\n\r\nvery,  very  intense, and so it is  not  sufficient  to\r\n\r\ndepend on a university run by the Government. In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  I  hope the Governments, apart  from  running\r\n\r\ntheir   own  University, must  be  liberal  and   also\r\n\r\nconcerned  themselves with the University  run  by  the\r\n\r\npeople themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.

It  is  quite\r\n\r\nunfounded. The mitosis for the University of Malaya  to\r\n\r\ndivide into two parts has already taken place. We  have\r\n\r\na  very simple example. Australia, with a population of\r\n\r\nround   about   10   million,  has  today   about   six\r\n\r\nuniversities for a population of 10 million.  There  is\r\n\r\nno  reason,  therefore,  why  we  in  Malaya,  with   a\r\n\r\npopulation  approaching nearly 8  million,  should  not\r\n\r\nhave two Universities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Three.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sorry, three Universities. And\r\n\r\nthere  is no necessity to fear that there would be  any\r\n\r\nduplication or triplication. I put to you a very simple\r\n\r\nexample.  Once  upon a time you had  only  one  medical\r\n\r\nschool in Canada. Then came the discovery that the only\r\n\r\nmedical  school  in  Canada was  not  producing  enough\r\n\r\ndoctors  to  supply the needs of the country.  So  they\r\n\r\nthought  they could solve the problem - by putting  up  a\r\n\r\nsecond  medical school, which they did. They put  up  a\r\n\r\nsecond medical school. However with two medical schools\r\n\r\nin  Canada, they still found that they could not  solve\r\n\r\nthe  shortage  of doctors. And I say the  same  problem\r\n\r\nfaces  us today. And it will be very selfish of  us  to\r\n\r\nthink   that   everything   can   be   centralised   or\r\n\r\nconcentrated in one institution - that we should  produce\r\n\r\nall our engineers from one institution, all our doctors\r\n\r\nfrom  one institution, and all our scientists from  one\r\n\r\ninstitution. I say that is not a healthy or  a  logical\r\n\r\napproach  to the problem of higher education. You  have\r\n\r\ninnumerable universities in Europe, the United Kingdom,\r\n\r\nand  the United States. And in no way has the unity  or\r\n\r\nthought  of nationalistic feeling in European countries\r\n\r\nor  the U.K. or the United States been disrupted by the\r\n\r\nfact  that  you  have  so  many  universities.

I have forgotten all that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> No, I do not wish.

I must admit that, I will  give  them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat tribute. But I will say in this House that I have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnever  at any time made the University a battle-ground\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  party  politics.  I  had  ample  opportunity   to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninfluence my academic colleagues and to influence  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents  who  came under me. But I never  did  it.  I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeliberately   kept   party  politics   out   of   the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversity.  I  kept politics out of  my  relationship\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  the students and out of my relationship with  my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstaff colleagues, because I sincerely believe that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversity should remain a neutral ground.  It  should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnever   degenerate  into  a  battle-ground  for  party\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolitics.  I would regret very much indeed if  in  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfuture   we  should  find  that  the  University   has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndegenerated into a playing field for politicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Members of this House will be fully\r\n\r\naware  that  we  have  an  excellent  example  in   the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Rangoon.

The fact that the man showed moral courage  of  a\r\n\r\nvery  high order, intellectual integrity of a very high\r\n\r\norder, and intellectual ability of a very high order on\r\n\r\none occasion does not necessarily mean he does not fail\r\n\r\nin  lack of understanding of academic traditions  at  a\r\n\r\nlater stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am glad he has given himself\r\n\r\naway,  Sir,I think the Member for Anson, the  more  he\r\n\r\nhas to say, the more he gets involved, and the more  he\r\n\r\nspeaks  against himself.

So  it  is  an\r\n\r\nimprovement over the previous Ordinance under which the\r\n\r\npresent  University  of  Malaya  is  carrying  on.  The\r\n\r\nGovermnent  respects the autonomy  of  the  University.\r\n\r\nBut,  of course, we would expect the University  to  be\r\n\r\nresponsible  enough to realise that it is  not  outside\r\n\r\nthe  law  of the State and that it has a responsibility\r\n\r\ntowards the -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> P.A.P.!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> - the security of the State. That. I\r\n\r\nthink, is an important factor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to answer the Member for Farrer Park.\r\n\r\nHis  suggestion  is  that, as far  as  possible,  there\r\n\r\nshould  not  he any duplication of faculties.  This  is\r\n\r\nsomething, I am sure, both Universities would  bear  in\r\n\r\nmind, because it would mean competing for staff and  so\r\n\r\nforth  which  will  not  be  healthy.  But  in  certain\r\n\r\nrespects, it  may  not be possible,  because  for  any\r\n\r\nproper university to function it will have to offer its\r\n\r\nArt  and  Science basic courses to students of its  own\r\n\r\nterritory.  There is the School of Agriculture  in  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Malaya at Kuala Lumpur, and  it  is  not\r\n\r\nlikely  that Singapore would establish its own separate\r\n\r\nFaculty  of Agriculture. Singapore would send to  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur  those  students  who  would  like  to  take  up\r\n\r\nagriculture. The same would apply to Engineering, which\r\n\r\nfaculty was transferred from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur.\r\n\r\nFor  some  time  to come, it would appear  that  we  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  would have to look after students  from  the\r\n\r\nFederation  who want to take up medicine. But  everyone\r\n\r\nis aware that the Federation authorities are interested\r\n\r\nin  establishing  a new Faculty of Medicine.  How  soon\r\n\r\nthey  can  do  it is a matter which they will  have  to\r\n\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the suggestion put forward by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Farrer  Park  that perhaps the Vice-Chancellor  of\r\n\r\neach University could sit in as a member of the Council\r\n\r\nin  the other University. I wonder whether he is  aware\r\n\r\nof the fact that there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  provision in the Councils of both Universities  for\r\n\r\none  person to be appointed, say, in our case,  by  the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan Agong. There is similar  provision  in\r\n\r\nthe  new University of Malaya Act for one person to  be\r\n\r\nappointed  by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.  But  in  the\r\n\r\npast  it  used to be filled by the officials, generally\r\n\r\nthe Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Education. I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Member  for Farrer Park has  a  good  point\r\n\r\nthere.  I  will discuss this matter with my counterpart\r\n\r\nin  the  Federation Government that  perhaps  for  this\r\n\r\nparticular   provision  we  might  invite   the   Vice-Chancellor of each University to fill the post. I think\r\n\r\nthat is a matter for private negotiation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I should like to deal with the remarks passed\r\n\r\nby the Member for Upper Serangoon. I find that he wants\r\n\r\nto  belittle the fact that the University of  Singapore\r\n\r\nis  something  established under the P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nand  that  the P.A.P. Government is taking  credit  for\r\n\r\nestablishing this University. Well, that is a matter of\r\n\r\nopinion, Sir, I do not think we are crowing over it. In\r\n\r\nmy  speech just now on the Second Reading of the  Bill,\r\n\r\nall  I did was to trace the background history: how the\r\n\r\nUniversity  was  founded, how  it  broke  up  into  two\r\n\r\nDivisions, and what would happen if we were  to  create\r\n\r\ntwo  separate national Universities. Today the Bill  is\r\n\r\nup  for Second Reading and, therefore, it is my duty to\r\n\r\npresent   facts  and  not  opinions  as  to  how   this\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore is to come into being. The hon.\r\n\r\nMember lamented the fact that the Guild of Graduates of\r\n\r\nthe  University  of  Malaya has  been  split  into  two\r\n\r\nbodies. Well, I do not see how otherwise it could  have\r\n\r\nhappened, because when there was one University, there\r\n\r\nwas  one  Guild  of Graduates; and when one  University\r\n\r\nbecomes  two  Universities, then the  two  Universities\r\n\r\nwould  have  to  share the number of graduates  amongst\r\n\r\nthemselves to form two separate bodies, because out  of\r\n\r\nthose two separate Guilds they would have to elect four\r\n\r\ngraduates (in our case, and I think it is high) to  the\r\n\r\nnew University of Malaya Council. I must say this, Sir.\r\n\r\nThat  this  is  yet  another step in  the  evolutionary\r\n\r\nprocess which produces the new university, just like an\r\n\r\nordinary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncell  which  breaks  up and forms two  separate  cells,\r\n\r\nfairly close.

It  is\r\n\r\nnot a question of telling the University what to do. It\r\n\r\nis  a  question  of  making it quite clear  and  giving\r\n\r\nconstitutional  protection to the academic  staff  that\r\n\r\nthey  need  fear no P.A.P. reprisals if  they  exercise\r\n\r\ntheir academic right in an extra curricula field within\r\n\r\nthe  limit  of  their competence, whether  there  is  a\r\n\r\npolitical connotation or not.

All  the major suggestions, if  any,  I  have\r\n\r\nalready incorporated in this draft Bill and the  people\r\n\r\nwho  matter have not protested over this so-called lack\r\n\r\nof  academic freedom, which is just in the mind of  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the fact that they\r\n\r\nsaid  nothing - does that mean that my  request  is  not\r\n\r\nlegitimate? Sir, because a Bill is presented to  us  by\r\n\r\nthe   State   Advocate-General,  who  is   a   man   of\r\n\r\nconsiderable legal acumen, therefore it must be correct\r\n\r\nin  every form and this Assembly should not look at  it\r\n\r\nnor  should  it  amend  it,  and  every  amendment   is\r\n\r\nunreasonable. Is that the logic of the Minister?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given to this House two clear examples of\r\n\r\nintimidation in the academic field. I am prepared  that\r\n\r\nthe  matter  should  be referred  to  a  commission  of\r\n\r\ninquiry. I know how frightened they are of commissions.\r\n\r\nThe question is this: is this a reasonable request?  Is\r\n\r\nthe  provision  I seek for the protection  of  academic\r\n\r\nfreedom  reasonable? Is there anything unreasonable  in\r\n\r\nthe  suggestion that every teacher shall be free in his\r\n\r\nunfettered   discretion  to  advise   any   person   or\r\n\r\norganisation  on  matters within his special  field  of\r\n\r\ncompetence,  whether such teacher be an  expatriate  or\r\n\r\nnot? Is there anything unreasonable in that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, what is unreasonable is the\r\n\r\ncontext  in which this request is made. We have nothing\r\n\r\nagainst  expatriates  in  their  exercise  of  academic\r\n\r\nfreedom,  but I have gone to great lengths  to  explain\r\n\r\nthat  this is a case where expatriate members join  the\r\n\r\npolitical arena. They should not do so, both  in  their\r\n\r\nown  interests and in the interests of the  University.\r\n\r\nWe  do  not  want to see members of the academic  staff\r\n\r\nembroiled   in   political  fights  either   with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment or any political Party. It will not  do  the\r\n\r\nstaff  any good, and it will not do the University  any\r\n\r\ngood. This is a simple proposition, Sir, which I put to\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson. Yet he has deliberately chosen to\r\n\r\nevade the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is fortunate that\r\n\r\nwe are in Committee and I can answer.

Minister for Finance,\r\n\r\nstatistician promoted. He asks what is the  context.  I\r\n\r\ntake the context of Prof. Sheridan, Dean of the Faculty\r\n\r\nof  Law,  who  within his special field  of  competence\r\n\r\nadvised a Member of this Assembly on his constitutional\r\n\r\nrights. He did not enter the political arena. He did  a\r\n\r\nperfectly  proper  act.  He  is  an  expatriate,   Sir.\r\n\r\nNevertheless  it  has  not  been  denied  what  I  have\r\n\r\nindirectly  learnt, that he came in for - to  my  mind - gross  criticism  from  the Government  to  the  extent\r\n\r\nwhich,  I  understand, has decided  him  to  leave  the\r\n\r\nUniversity. A man who has been of considerable value to\r\n\r\nthe University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance says it is a matter of\r\n\r\ncoming  into  the  political  arena.  Where  was   that\r\n\r\nquestion \"coming into the political arena\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue was a professor who is a Professor\r\n\r\nof Literature. He was speaking within his special field\r\n\r\nof competence. The letter that lie received will be one\r\n\r\nof  the  hallmarks  of disgrace, a thing  of  which  no\r\n\r\ncivilised  government  could be anything  but  ashamed.\r\n\r\nThey  ask,  where  is the political  intimidation?  For\r\n\r\ntheir  own  good  they should not interfere.  They  are\r\n\r\nadult  professors, Sir, perhaps a lot more mature  than\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance, and as adults they should  be\r\n\r\nleft  free to choose what is good for them and what  is\r\n\r\nin  accordance with their responsibility and their duty\r\n\r\nto  the University. I am not limiting this issue to the\r\n\r\npolitical   sphere.   I  say  it  is   important   that\r\n\r\nexpatriates as well as local staff should feel free  to\r\n\r\nadvise  or  refrain from advising in  their  discretion\r\n\r\nwithout  outside  influence, without  any  intimidation\r\n\r\nfrom the Government. We have heard from the Member  for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  that this Government, when it could  get  an\r\n\r\nexpatriate  who  was  on  the  academic  staff  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity to stand on its platform, utilised him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon.

Surely\r\n\r\nthe principle itself is one which every decent person\r\n\r\ncan accept, that the academic staff should feel secure\r\n\r\nin acting in a manner totally in conformity with\r\n\r\nacademic traditions in giving or refraining from giving\r\n\r\nadvice, and particularly that they should be conscious\r\n\r\nof a sense of responsibility in advising on matters of\r\n\r\nnational interest when these are within their field of\r\n\r\ncompetence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance said that I had not answered him.\r\n\r\nI trust he is now wiser.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question I\r\n\r\nposed to the Member for Anson is simple. Does he accept\r\n\r\nthe principle that a non-citizen, an expatriate, should\r\n\r\nnot interfere in local political affairs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think we are just straying from the\r\n\r\npoint. I think the point is whether or not the term  of\r\n\r\nservice  suggested by the Member for  Anson  should  be\r\n\r\nwritten into the constitution. That is the point, is it\r\n\r\nnot?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nknows  quite  well  that  it  is  essential  that   the\r\n\r\nUniversity should be autonomous and that there must  be\r\n\r\nsome meaning to the word \"autonomy\". You cannot have an\r\n\r\nautonomous  body which does not have any  control  over\r\n\r\nwhat  its own employees do. If the University wants  to\r\n\r\nmaintain itself as an autonomous body and does not want\r\n\r\nto get embroiled in political disputes in Singapore, it\r\n\r\nhas the right to maintain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat autonomy and it also has the right to control  the\r\n\r\nactivities of its employees. Mr Speaker, Sir, we  must\r\n\r\nleave it to the University to set those limits. Who are\r\n\r\nwe  to write in these provisions saying that University\r\n\r\nemployees  are free to do as they please  within  their\r\n\r\nintellectual competence? If we as legislators try to do\r\n\r\nthat,  Sir, I say that we will be derogating  from  the\r\n\r\nautonomy of the University. Surely the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nunderstands that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The argument of the Minister is\r\n\r\ndelightful.  So if we tell them that they have  freedom\r\n\r\nwe  are limiting their freedom. That is the argument of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister. It is particularly interesting to me  to\r\n\r\nlearn  from the lips of the Minister that, in fact,  he\r\n\r\nexpects  the  University to discipline its members  and\r\n\r\ncontrol   their   extra   curricula   activities.   Any\r\n\r\nUniversity  that  seeks  to  do  that  ceases  to  have\r\n\r\nacademic freedom. Let us recognise, Sir, when he  says,\r\n\r\n\"Who are we to intervene in this autonomy?\", that I was\r\n\r\nspeaking of our Prime Minister, his own leader and  his\r\n\r\nown  Government  who interfered - and interfered,  to  my\r\n\r\nmind,  in the most improper fashion - in respect  of  the\r\n\r\nconduct  of two Professors of the University.

Section 17(c)  of  the  Courts\r\n\r\nOrdinance  confers on the High Court  the  jurisdiction\r\n\r\nand  authority of the Colonial Court of Admiralty.

We have therefore to look at the law as it stood\r\n\r\nin  England in these matters before 1890 in relation to\r\n\r\nthe  maritime matters dealt with in this Bill. Most  of\r\n\r\nthese  provisions have, in fact, been consolidated  and\r\n\r\nre-enacted  in  section  22 of  the  Supreme  Court  of\r\n\r\nJudicature  (Consolidation) Act. 1925, but the  Act  of\r\n\r\n1925   does   not  apply  to  Singapore  although   its\r\n\r\nprovisions in the matters relating to the present  Bill\r\n\r\nare similar to those which are contained in the English\r\n\r\nActs  prior to 1890, which are the Admiralty Court Act,\r\n\r\n1840, and the Admiralty Court Act, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1956 the Administration of Justice Act, 1956, was\r\n\r\nenacted  in  the  United Kingdom  in  order  to  enable\r\n\r\nratification  of  three  international  Conventions  on\r\n\r\nmaritime  law signed at Brussels in 1952, to which  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom was a party.

This Convention calls for amendment\r\n\r\nof  English law to permit not only the ship in  respect\r\n\r\nof  which the claims arose to be arrested but also  any\r\n\r\nother  ship  which was under the same  ownership.  This\r\n\r\nConvention  necessitated the majority of the amendments\r\n\r\nincluded   in   the  1956  Act.  The   more   important\r\n\r\namendments,   apart  from  the  outstanding   provision\r\n\r\npermitting the arrest of \"sister\" ships, are:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The right to arrest a ship where the ship was a\r\n\r\npassive cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Sir, this is a very technical\r\n\r\nBill, and a lot of technical phrases are being used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Convention, that is the third\r\n\r\nConvention  relating to the Arrest of  Seagoing  ships,\r\n\r\nnecessitated the majority of the amendments included in\r\n\r\nthe 1956 Act. The more important amendments, apart from\r\n\r\nthe  outstanding provisions permitting  the  arrest  of\r\n\r\n\"sister\" ships, are:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The right to arrest a ship where the ship was a\r\n\r\npassive  cause.  For example, where a  stevedore  falls\r\n\r\ndown the hold of a ship;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To enable a mortgage to arrest a foreign ship.\r\n\r\nFormerly this could not be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question has arisen whether these Conventions\r\n\r\nshould  be  extended to Singapore. The Master Attendant\r\n\r\nand Local Shipping and Shipowners' Association favoured\r\n\r\nextension  of  these Conventions to  Singapore  on  the\r\n\r\nground  that Singapore should, as a major port,  follow\r\n\r\ninternational maritime practice, and that it  would  be\r\n\r\nin  the  interest of local shipping for this Government\r\n\r\nto  adopt the same attitude to these Conventions as the\r\n\r\nGovernment of the United Kingdom. This Bill accordingly\r\n\r\nis  designed  to bring the law in Singapore  into  line\r\n\r\nwith  the  provisions of Part I of the  United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nAdministration of Justice Act, 1956, in order to enable\r\n\r\nthe  extension  of these Conventions to Singapore, and\r\n\r\nhas  been  cleared with the Hon. the Chief Justice  and\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Bar Committee since the matters affected\r\n\r\nby  this Bill relate to the jurisdiction of High  Court\r\n\r\nin admiralty matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will deal with the main clauses of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  now. Clause 3 (1) (c) seeks to provide  that\r\n\r\nthe  High  Court shall have jurisdiction  to  hear  and\r\n\r\ndetermine a claim in respect of a mortgage or a  charge\r\n\r\non any ship or a share therein. Under existing law this\r\n\r\njurisdiction  is limited to claims where  the  ship  in\r\n\r\nquestion  is already under arrest by a process  of  the\r\n\r\ncourt  or where the proceeds of sale thereof have  been\r\n\r\nbrought  into court or to claims where the mortgage  is\r\n\r\nalready registered under the Merchant Shipping Acts  as\r\n\r\nprovided  in  sections 3 and 11 of the Admiralty  Court\r\n\r\nAct,  1861. This clause removes the requirement that  a\r\n\r\nship  must already be under arrest before the  mortgage\r\n\r\ncan  bring  an  action before the High Court.  It  also\r\n\r\nrenders  unnecessary the alternative  requirement  that\r\n\r\nthe  mortgage  must  be registered under  the  Merchant\r\n\r\nShipping Acts before action can be brought. Section  22\r\n\r\n(a)   (ix)   of   the  Supreme  Court   of   Judicature\r\n\r\n(Consolidation)  Act,  1925, similarly  provides   for\r\n\r\njurisdiction  in respect of any claim in respect  of  a\r\n\r\nmortgage  of any ship being a mortgage duly  registered\r\n\r\nin accordance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts or in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  any mortgage of a ship which  is,  or  the\r\n\r\nproceeds  thereof are under the arrest  of  the  court.\r\n\r\nThis  Act, of course, as I have said earlier  does  not\r\n\r\napply to Singapore, but the provisions of the Admiralty\r\n\r\nCourt  Act,  1861,  to which I have  already  referred,\r\n\r\ncontain  substantially the same provisions. The English\r\n\r\nAdministration of Justice Act, 1956, on which this Bill\r\n\r\nis  modelled, has already made the amendments  referred\r\n\r\nto in clause 3 (1) (c). I need hardly say that that the\r\n\r\nEnglish  Act  of 1956 does not apply to Singapore,  and\r\n\r\nthat is the reason why this Bill is before the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 35 of the Admiralty Court Act, 1861, provides\r\n\r\nthat   jurisdiction   may  be   exercised   either   by\r\n\r\nproceedings  in  rem or by proceedings in  personam  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  Admiralty claims dealt with in  that  Act.\r\n\r\nClause 4 of this Bill provides similarly in respect  of\r\n\r\nsuch claims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 (1) (f) seeks to provide that the High Court\r\n\r\nshall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any claim\r\n\r\nfor  loss of life or personal injury caused by any ship\r\n\r\nor  occurring in connection with the operation  of  any\r\n\r\nship.  The  English Acts before 1890  made  no  similar\r\n\r\nprovision  for  such  claims to  be  determined  in  an\r\n\r\nAdmiralty action -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The English Acts  before  1890\r\n\r\nmade  no  similar  provision  for  such  claims  to  be\r\n\r\ndetermined in an Admiralty action, and only the  common\r\n\r\nlaw  remedies lay against the responsible  parties.  In\r\n\r\nEngland,  however,  the  Act  of  1925  expressly  made\r\n\r\nprovision  for  the High Court in England  to  exercise\r\n\r\nAdmiralty jurisdiction in respect of claims for loss of\r\n\r\nlife  or personal injuries. As this Act does not  apply\r\n\r\nto  us,  there is no similar statutory provision  which\r\n\r\napplies  to  Singapore. This clause 3(1) (f)  makes  it\r\n\r\nclear  that the High Court can hear and determine  such\r\n\r\nclaims by virtue of its Admiralty jurisdiction,  and  a\r\n\r\nclaim  can proceed either in personam or, as  clause  4\r\n\r\nprovides,  in rem in cases where the person responsible\r\n\r\nis  the  owner, character, or in possession or  control\r\n\r\nand  was,  at  the  time  the action  is  brought,  the\r\n\r\nbeneficial owner of that ship or any other ship. In the\r\n\r\ncase  of  his owning not the ship involved but  another\r\n\r\nship,  an  action in rem could be invoked  against  the\r\n\r\nlatter. Thus even where a ship is the passive cause  it\r\n\r\ncan  be  arrested  if  the person responsible  for  the\r\n\r\ninjury  is its sole beneficial owner. This is in clause\r\n\r\n4(4).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 (1) (g) of this Bill seeks to provide for\r\n\r\njurisdiction  in respect of any claim for  loss  of  or\r\n\r\ndamage to goods carried in a ship, and clause 3 (1) (h)\r\n\r\nseeks to provide or claims arising out of any agreement\r\n\r\nrelating to the carriage of goods in a ship or  to  the\r\n\r\nuse  or  hire of a ship. The existing law contained  in\r\n\r\nsection  6  of the Admiralty Court Act, 1861,  provides\r\n\r\nfor  jurisdiction in respect of claims for damage  done\r\n\r\nto goods carried in a ship by negligence, misconduct or\r\n\r\nany breach of duty or breach of contract on the part of\r\n\r\nthe owner, master or crew of the ship, unless the court\r\n\r\nis satisfied that at the time of the institution of the\r\n\r\nproceedings any owner or part-owner is domiciled within\r\n\r\nthe  jurisdiction. Section 22 (a) (xii) of the 1925 Act\r\n\r\nmakes a similar provision. Thus both in England and  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  no such claims as these could be pursued  if\r\n\r\nthe owner or part-owner of the ship concerned possessed\r\n\r\na  domicile within the jurisdiction.

A shipowner, however, has a lien on the cargo\r\n\r\nfor  its contribution in general average, but the owner\r\n\r\nof  the  cargo  in  a  ship has no corresponding  right\r\n\r\nagainst  a  ship where he is a creditor  in  a  General\r\n\r\nAverage  Adjustment. The third Convention provides  for\r\n\r\nany  claim in respect of a general average act to be  a\r\n\r\nmaritime claim which can be pursued against a ship, and\r\n\r\nthis  paragraph gives effect accordingly  in  order  to\r\n\r\ncomply with the Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 prescribes the manner in which Admiralty\r\n\r\njurisdiction may be exercised and limits the action  in\r\n\r\nrem to conform to the Arrest Convention.

The blockage of the streams  leads  to\r\n\r\nflooding  which  causes  damage  to  the  farmers   and\r\n\r\nvillagers  living  around  the  area  where  there  are\r\n\r\nconcentrations  of  sand deposits.  These  farmers  and\r\n\r\nrural  folks have repeatedly complained of  the  losses\r\n\r\nthey have suffered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flooding has been particularly extensive after a heavy\r\n\r\nrain, and while the Government has taken remedial steps\r\n\r\nin  the  past to de-silt the drains, the nuisance  will\r\n\r\nrecur unless proper steps are taken to ensure that  the\r\n\r\noperations  are conducted in a satisfactory manner.  It\r\n\r\nwould  be  unfair to expect public funds to be utilised\r\n\r\nfor  remedial measures solely for the benefit of  these\r\n\r\noperators, but, at the same time, Government  does  not\r\n\r\nwish  to prohibit sand quarrying operations since  sand\r\n\r\nis an essential\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaterial  to  keep  the building  industry  going.  The\r\n\r\nproper remedy, therefore, is to permit the quarrying to\r\n\r\noperate  under  conditions that can  be  satisfactorily\r\n\r\ncontrolled.  It  may be as well for me  to  inform  the\r\n\r\nHouse that complaints from farmers have been coming  in\r\n\r\nyear  after year. Over the last few years, such  floods\r\n\r\nhave caused damage to farmers which could be valued  at\r\n\r\nthousands of dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far back as 1958, the Rural Board has caused action\r\n\r\nto  be taken under the Municipal Ordinance, and notices\r\n\r\nwere  served on the sand operators to require  them  to\r\n\r\nabate  the  nuisance. As a result of this  action,  the\r\n\r\nsand operators contributed a sum of $5,200 towards  the\r\n\r\ncost  of de-silting. Despite the effort to de-silt  and\r\n\r\nclear  the  drains and streams, flooding in such  areas\r\n\r\nrecurred  again in 1959 and 1960. On investigation,  it\r\n\r\nwas revealed that the flooding was caused by the drains\r\n\r\nand  canals  being choked up with waste from  the  sand\r\n\r\nquarries.  The Government then took steps to clear  the\r\n\r\nSungei  Api Api and a 60-foot wide canal at  Pasir  Ris\r\n\r\nwas  constructed. This work, however,  proved  abortive\r\n\r\nand the canal was chocked up again after a short time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sand operations have been going on in many places in\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  some years, the principal  areas  being\r\n\r\nTampines, Changi and Bedok. Activities for the last few\r\n\r\nyears  have been concentrated at Tampines. In an effort\r\n\r\nto  secure  the co-operation of the sand operators,  so\r\n\r\nthat  their method for the production of sand will  not\r\n\r\ndestroy  the livelihood of the farmers in the  Tampines\r\n\r\narea, the operators were invited by my Ministry in June\r\n\r\nthis year for discussion, the purpose being to agree on\r\n\r\nacceptable   steps  to  be  taken  and  for   necessary\r\n\r\nprecautionary  measures laid down by the  Public  Works\r\n\r\nDepartment  and the Health authorities to  be  complied\r\n\r\nwith  to  prevent silt from flooding the common  drains\r\n\r\nand  streams. The sand operators agreed that they would\r\n\r\ncomply  with  the requirements of the authorities,  and\r\n\r\nthat  they  would  compensate  any  farmer  for  losses\r\n\r\nsuffered as a result of sand operations. The quantum of\r\n\r\nsuch  losses  for  damage would be  determined  on  the\r\n\r\nadjudication\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  a  three-man committee, consisting of the  farmers'\r\n\r\nrepresentative, the sand operators' representative  and\r\n\r\na Ministry official.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent further damage to the property of\r\n\r\nthe  farmers, steps were taken to obtain an  injunction\r\n\r\nfrom  the  High Court to restrain these sand  operators\r\n\r\ntemporarily until satisfactory arrangements were  made.\r\n\r\nThe sand operators also voluntarily agreed to a payment\r\n\r\npro  rata among themselves of a sum amounting  to  some\r\n\r\n$20,000  as contributions towards the cost of desilting\r\n\r\nthe   drains.  On  the  assurance  given  by  the  sand\r\n\r\noperators  to  abide by the requirements, the  farmers\r\n\r\nwere  temporarily appeased and no steps were  taken  to\r\n\r\napply  to  the  High  Court  for  continuance  of   the\r\n\r\ninjunction   when  it  expired  on  31st  July,   1961.\r\n\r\nFollowing  the  resumption  of  sand  operations,  some\r\n\r\noperators  have  of  late begun to  fall  down  on  the\r\n\r\nundertaking they had given that adequate measures would\r\n\r\nbe   taken  to  prevent  nuisance  or  damage.  It  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  necessary, if all the Government's  efforts\r\n\r\nwere not to be nullified and the whole issue opened  up\r\n\r\nafresh  time  and  again, that  legislation  should  be\r\n\r\nintroduced  to  ensure  proper  control  of  operations\r\n\r\nbefore  further  damage takes place or  serious  health\r\n\r\nhazards  arise.  There are areas in  Changi  and  Bedok\r\n\r\nwhere  sand excavations have been going on in the past.\r\n\r\nHere  again,  the farmers living in the  vicinity  have\r\n\r\nmade  complaints from Lime to time that the excavations\r\n\r\nare   causing  damage  to  their  livestock  and  their\r\n\r\nvegetable  crops,  and  polluting  their  health.   New\r\n\r\nlegislation  is  necessary because most  sand  quarries\r\n\r\nstand  on land under private ownership over which there\r\n\r\nis  no  satisfactory control under existing legislation\r\n\r\nwhen  such  land is used for the purposes of  producing\r\n\r\nsand.  In  view of the present activity in the building\r\n\r\ntrade,   which   is   likely  to  increase   with   the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  Government's Four-Year  development\r\n\r\nprogramme, the demand for sand will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  arise. Hence, there is  every  likelihood\r\n\r\nthat   the  sand  operators  will  step  up  production\r\n\r\nactivity  considerably, giving rise  possibly  to  more\r\n\r\ndamage to the surrounding areas and adversely affecting\r\n\r\nthe  farmers,  their livestock and  crops.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of my Ministry to take steps  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  sand operators work their pits on a properly\r\n\r\ncontrolled basis so as not to create health problems or\r\n\r\nflood or other nuisance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill before the House provides that after the\r\n\r\ncoming  into force of this Bill, it shall be an offence\r\n\r\nfor  anyone to operate a sand quarry without a licence.\r\n\r\nThe  grant or renewal of a licence will be given at the\r\n\r\ndiscretion  of the licensing officer, who shall  impose\r\n\r\nsuch  restrictions and conditions as are necessary  for\r\n\r\nthe  sand operations to be conducted on a proper basis.\r\n\r\nTo  ensure that such conditions are carried out,  there\r\n\r\nis provision for the depositing of security so that, in\r\n\r\nthe  event  of failure on the part of the  licensee  to\r\n\r\nprovide  remedial measures, such work would be  carried\r\n\r\nout  by the licensing officer who may then recover  the\r\n\r\ncost of the work from the security deposited. The Bill\r\n\r\nwill   ensure  that  sand  digging  and  sand   washing\r\n\r\noperations  shall not cause any nuisance or  damage  to\r\n\r\nneighbouring lands and buildings. There are  provisions\r\n\r\nto require that the licensee shall use only fresh water\r\n\r\nfor  his sand operations in view of the possibility  of\r\n\r\ncontamination of wells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also provision to prevent the licensee from\r\n\r\ninterfering with the banks of rivers, streams of  water\r\n\r\ncourses  and  to give effect to the proper disposal  of\r\n\r\nearth, dirt or other waste matter from the sand quarry.\r\n\r\nIn  the case of these used sand pits, provision is made\r\n\r\nfor  them to be fenced in and the necessary precautions\r\n\r\ntaken to prevent danger or damage to life or property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid any case of possible hardship in special\r\n\r\ncircumstances, the Minister will be empowered to exempt\r\n\r\nany  sand quarry from all or any provisions in the Bill\r\n\r\nwhen  necessary.

But before it was  brought  up\r\n\r\nsome  operators  of sand quarries had been  prosecuted,\r\n\r\nand  so  the  minor operators are unable to  carry  out\r\n\r\ntheir  work and business. On the other hand, all  along\r\n\r\nthe  farmers  who have suffered damage have  not  been\r\n\r\ngiven compensation. Even in this Bill we do not see any\r\n\r\nprovision  for compensation to be made by the operators\r\n\r\nto  the farmers in respect of the damage caused by such\r\n\r\noperations.  It is not stated clearly that compensation\r\n\r\nwill be made accordingly. So, can we say that when this\r\n\r\nBill  is  passed  by this House, the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nfarmers and other vegetable gardeners will be protected\r\n\r\nby it? I am very doubtful about this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to know whether this Bill will be able to\r\n\r\nsolve the shortage of sand in the building industry. At\r\n\r\npresent   the  building  industry  is  expanding   very\r\n\r\nrapidly,  but the production of sand is  rather  slow.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a reduction in the production of sand.  Why?\r\n\r\nWell,  this  has come about as a result of  the  action\r\n\r\ntaken  by the Minister for National Development.  So  I\r\n\r\nmust  tell this House that before this Bill was brought\r\n\r\nup, the Minister for National Development had acted  in\r\n\r\naccordance with some of the provisions in this Bill  by\r\n\r\nprosecuting  some  operators of sand quarries.  As  the\r\n\r\nMinister  himself  has  said,  in  June  this  year  an\r\n\r\ninjunction  was  applied  for  in  the  High  Court  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  against certain operators of sand  quarries.\r\n\r\nSo we would like to know whether this Bill will be able\r\n\r\nto  bring  about  something good for  the  farmers  and\r\n\r\nworkers,  and what it will do to the building  industry\r\n\r\nin respect of sand production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, never in the history of Singapore\r\n\r\nhave we heard of any shortage of sand in respect of the\r\n\r\nbuilding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustry, lit is only recently, according  to  the\r\n\r\nreport of the Ministry of National Development, that we\r\n\r\nhave  this  shortage of sand. As a result,  some  1,000\r\n\r\nworkers  have  been  out of work. Now,  who  is  to  be\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  this?  I  think  the  main  blame  or\r\n\r\nresponsibility  should  be  put  on  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational  Development for his dealings  with  the  sand\r\n\r\nquarry   operators.   Actually   the   Tampines    area\r\n\r\ncontributes  90 per cent in respect of sand production.\r\n\r\nRecently, because some operators have come to a stop in\r\n\r\ntheir  business, some 4,000 workers dependent  on  such\r\n\r\noperations  have  been out of work.  Some  sand  quarry\r\n\r\noperators  just  carry  on their business  without  any\r\n\r\nregard  to the interest of the farmers. As a result  of\r\n\r\nthis,  many drains have been choked, water cannot  flow\r\n\r\nfreely,  and  on rainy days there is flooding  in  this\r\n\r\narea.  As a result of this situation about 100  farmers\r\n\r\nin  this area had to suffer damages and losses. So they\r\n\r\nwent  to  their  representatives, i.e.,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nRural Dwellers' Association, and asked them to complain\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister for National Development in the  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  said Minister would be able to  solve  their\r\n\r\nproblems and reduce the damage they were suffering. But\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for National Development, in dealing with\r\n\r\nthis matter, had, on the one hand, no knowledge of sand\r\n\r\nquarry  operations,  and, on the other  hand,  did  not\r\n\r\nconsult  the dwellers concerned. He rashly  took  steps\r\n\r\nwithout  giving consideration and warning to  the  sand\r\n\r\nquarry  operators. So when these sand quarry operations\r\n\r\nwere  stopped for a month, some 1,000 workers dependent\r\n\r\non  such operations were put out of work. There  was  a\r\n\r\nstandstill  in the building industry, as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nwhich  some building construction workers were put  out\r\n\r\nof work as well. Lorry drivers engaged in carrying sand\r\n\r\nwere  also put out of work. So I say that this  trouble\r\n\r\nhas come about due to lack of experience on the part of\r\n\r\nthe Minister for National Development. We all know that\r\n\r\nin   dealing  with  any  matter,  you  must  take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the interests of all parties  concerned.\r\n\r\nYou  must also know the true situation. Without knowing\r\n\r\nthe true\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsituation,  it  is not right to act or  make  any  rash\r\n\r\ndecision.   Let  us  take,  for  example, these   sand\r\n\r\noperations  again.  Before any  action  is  taken,  the\r\n\r\nfollowing points should be considered:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The 1,000 workers connected with sand quarry\r\n\r\noperations  must be taken into consideration,  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  would not be confronted with the difficulties  of\r\n\r\nunemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We must make sure against whom action is to be\r\n\r\ntaken. Action should not be taken against the farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Adequate consultation should take place between the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the sand quarry workers' representatives\r\n\r\nso that their interests could be well looked after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Such action before it is taken and when it is taken\r\n\r\nshould  not  put a stop to the sand quarry  operations,\r\n\r\nwhich would put the workers connected therewith out  of\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I can safely say that, as a result of such actions\r\n\r\ntaken  by the Minister for National Development,  there\r\n\r\nwere  some  difficulties.  He  had  laid  down  certain\r\n\r\nstringent  conditions in respect  of  the  sand  quarry\r\n\r\noperations. As a result, minor operators are  not  able\r\n\r\nto  carry on their business smoothly. So about  200  to\r\n\r\n300  workers  are out of work or will be out  of  work.\r\n\r\nThen  as  a  result of such stringent  regulations  and\r\n\r\nconditions,  you  will  have major  operators  in  sand\r\n\r\nquarries.  These people will then be able to monopolise\r\n\r\nthe trade and raise prices as they like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

This  unilateral\r\n\r\naction  of  the  Minister for National Development  has\r\n\r\ngiven rise to more difficulties with no actual solution\r\n\r\nto  the real problem. The problem of sand shortage  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  solved;  the  unemployment  problem  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  connected with this trade has not been solved;\r\n\r\nthe   farmers'  interests  have  not  been   adequately\r\n\r\nprotected. All these are to be answered by the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  National Development. In the meantime, in  dealing\r\n\r\nwith the matter, the Minister has disregarded the views\r\n\r\nof his Parliamentary Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I have heard the lengthy speech  of  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Pasir Panjang Without knowing what  he  was\r\n\r\ntalking about, because I could not catch the main point\r\n\r\nin  his speech. I do not know whether he said that  our\r\n\r\nBill  is  detrimental to the farmers  or  to  the  sand\r\n\r\nquarry operators. He has not made himself clear in this\r\n\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for National Development has tabled this Bill with this main aim, and it has been clearly stated by him. We are trying to do our best and hope that Members opposite will give their valuable views in respect of this Bill so that it will be able to look after the interests of all. But it is a pity that the Members opposite - especially those in the Barisan Sosialis - oppose good and bad things at the same time.\r\n\r\nThey  do not seem to have any principle at all in  this\r\n\r\ndebate, as they do not try to put their valuable  views\r\n\r\nacross. For example, the Member concerned says that the\r\n\r\nshortage of sand is unprecedented and he does not  know\r\n\r\nthe cause. We can tell him that this was not due to our\r\n\r\nabsentmindedness, but because we have had  very  little\r\n\r\nrain  for  a long period. It was because of  this  that\r\n\r\nsand  quarrying  was  affected, as  sand  quarrying  is\r\n\r\ndependent on the supply of water. As a result of  this,\r\n\r\nsome workers connected with this work were affected and\r\n\r\nwe received\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  lot  of complaints from these people in the Ministry\r\n\r\nof National Development. On receipt of such complaints,\r\n\r\nwe investigated the cases and we found that the farmers\r\n\r\nalso  suffered  a  great  deal.  So  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational Development thought fit to take proper  action\r\n\r\nto  deal with this situation. Of course, in the  course\r\n\r\nof this action, some inconvenience and difficulties may\r\n\r\nhave  been caused to sand quarrying operations. But  we\r\n\r\nmust  also  realise  that, in  view  of  the  expanding\r\n\r\nbuilding  industry,  we must not put  an  end  to  sand\r\n\r\nquarry operations and that, on the other hand, we  must\r\n\r\nalso  look after the interest of the farmers.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  we have this Bill which is in the interest of both\r\n\r\nthe  farmers and of the sand quarry operators. We  want\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that sand quarry operations can be  carried\r\n\r\nout  systematically  and orderly  without  causing  any\r\n\r\ninterference to the farmers' crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope that the Members opposite - especially those\r\n\r\nin  the Barisan Sosialis - will not go against the  Bill\r\n\r\njust  for the sake of going against it. They must  take\r\n\r\ninto  consideration the interest of the people and  put\r\n\r\nacross  their  views  accordingly.  They  can  make   a\r\n\r\ncontribution  to this Bill by telling us  how  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith the situation. But it would appear from the speech\r\n\r\nof  the Member for Pasir Panjang that he did not  write\r\n\r\nit himself. I do not know where he got the speech from,\r\n\r\nbecause  it appears to me that he could not  even  read\r\n\r\nhis  speech  properly.

But\r\n\r\nthe  Government paid no attention to the sufferings  of\r\n\r\nthe  people, and it completely ignored the opinions  of\r\n\r\nAssemblymen.

But I heard my colleague the  Member  for\r\n\r\nChangi  and also the Minister for National Development.\r\n\r\nThe   Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nNational  Development  said  that  we  in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis were joking. This is wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sand Quarries Bill before us is a very important\r\n\r\nBill and deserves our close attention. In principle, we\r\n\r\ndo  not  oppose it. We do not say this Bill is bad.  We\r\n\r\njust  want  to  give our opinion to the Government  and\r\n\r\npoint  out  that the Minister for National  Development\r\n\r\nhas  so  mishandled this question that a lot of  people\r\n\r\nhave  suffered. But the Parliamentary Secretary to  the\r\n\r\nMinister   said   that  we  were   joking   and   being\r\n\r\nlighthearted about it. He also touched on the  question\r\n\r\nof  compensation. The Member for Changi has  said  that\r\n\r\nthere  is no provision in the Bill for compensation  to\r\n\r\nbe  paid  to  farmers  or others whose  properties  are\r\n\r\ndamaged  by  sand-washing  operations,  and  that   the\r\n\r\noperators must compensate those who are affected.  This\r\n\r\nis  what  we  are  concerned about - why  was  this  Bill\r\n\r\nbrought  up?  The reason is to protect the  welfare  of\r\n\r\nthose  affected  by  sand  quarry  operations.  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does not protect them, what is the  use  of\r\n\r\nbringing up this Bill? If the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill cannot solve this problem, then it is useless.  If\r\n\r\nthere  is no provision for compensation, then  it  will\r\n\r\nlead to trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that\r\n\r\nthe Government had formed a three-man committee to deal\r\n\r\nwith  the  problem of compensation.  That  was  a  good\r\n\r\nconstructive move. We do not oppose it. But what we are\r\n\r\nconcerned about is whether this three-man committee can\r\n\r\nreally   shoulder   this   task,   and   whether    its\r\n\r\nrecommendations  can have any effect at  all.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhat  the Assembly should pay attention to. Let me tell\r\n\r\nthe Parliamentary Secretary this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat   is   the  use  of  establishing  this  three-man\r\n\r\ncommittee?  When  it  was established,  it  recommended\r\n\r\ncertain  conditions for compensation to those  affected\r\n\r\nby  the sand-washing operations. But the sand operators\r\n\r\npaid  no  heed  to  its decisions,  and  the  three-man\r\n\r\ncommittee   had  not  enforced  compliance   with   its\r\n\r\ndecisions,  and  so no compensation  was  paid  to  the\r\n\r\nfarmers  affected.  From what  I  know,  the  three-man\r\n\r\ncommittee  mentioned this to the Minister for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment, and he summoned the sand operators to  his\r\n\r\nMinistry to talk it over. But what was the result? Only\r\n\r\nthe Minister can now tell us whether the sand operators\r\n\r\ndid  turn up in his office or not. The final result was\r\n\r\nthat  the  sand operators paid no heed to the committee\r\n\r\nand  did  not turn up at the Ministry. They  considered\r\n\r\nthe summons of the Minister as something insignificant.\r\n\r\nThis  shows how the three-man committee dealt with this\r\n\r\nproblem. It is a great disappointment. I believe  after\r\n\r\nthis  first failure, there will be successive  failures\r\n\r\nin future. The reason is this: if there is no provision\r\n\r\nin the Bill to provide for compensation to the farmers,\r\n\r\nthen  the  interests of the farmers  cannot  be  looked\r\n\r\ninto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary has said\r\n\r\njust now that we oppose every Bill. This allegation  is\r\n\r\nnot true. We shall be happy if we can be of any use  or\r\n\r\nhelp to the Government to resolve all difficulties  and\r\n\r\nproblems. We can assure them that we shall try our best\r\n\r\nto  help  them  solve  all kinds  of  difficulties  and\r\n\r\nproblems,  and  that  they  should  not  consider   our\r\n\r\nsuggestions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeaningless  and  think  that we  are  only  trying  to\r\n\r\nembarrass them by putting up such suggestions. That  is\r\n\r\na wrong attitude on their part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary has also\r\n\r\ntouched on the matter of building materials. I  do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to  touch  on  it. What I want  to  say  is  that\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy in regard to sand quarrying is full\r\n\r\nof  contradictions. We know that the  Work  Brigade  is\r\n\r\nshouldering  the responsibility of sand quarrying.  The\r\n\r\nusual method of sand quarrying is -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder if those details come\r\n\r\nwithin  the  general principles of this  Bill.  We  are\r\n\r\ndiscussing the general principles of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): What I want to say\r\n\r\nhas  something to do with the principles of  the  Bill.\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  Work Brigade are  carrying  out  sand\r\n\r\noperations. The usual method of operation  is  to  make\r\n\r\nuse  of the water from the rivers, by drawing the water\r\n\r\ninto  the sand quarry to wash away certain sediment  to\r\n\r\nget  the  sand.  The Minister has also said  that  some\r\n\r\nwells should be dug in order to store the sediment. But\r\n\r\nthen  Government's action in this respect is a kind  of\r\n\r\nmockery.  On  the one hand, the Government is  carrying\r\n\r\nout  water rationing and, on the other hand, the  water\r\n\r\nused  in  sand quarrying is pipe-water. I want to  know\r\n\r\nfrom the Minister whether, according to his suggestion.\r\n\r\nthere  will be no damage or no bad effects as a  result\r\n\r\nof  their making use of pipe-water to wash sand. I want\r\n\r\nto  ask him whether this kind of operation will not  be\r\n\r\nmore  costly, using pipe-water rather than using  water\r\n\r\nfrom a stream or river for sand operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sand Quarries Bill tabled by the Government in the\r\n\r\nAssembly  today comes about only because  in  May  this\r\n\r\nyear  the Rural People's Association responded  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister's   request   by  giving   their   views   and\r\n\r\nsuggestions  as to how to resolve the problem  of  sand\r\n\r\nquarrying, which has caused much damage and  losses  to\r\n\r\nthe   farmers   in  the  affected  surrounding   areas.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I want to ask the Minister whether in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndrawing  up  this  Bill  he  has  consulted  the  Rural\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association. I hope that in future, when  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  deals  with this kind of problem,  it  will\r\n\r\nconsult all the people concerned. The Government should\r\n\r\nconsult  the  rural people's organisations  before  any\r\n\r\nsteps  are  taken. At the same time, I hope that  after\r\n\r\nthe  passage  of  this Bill, those people  and  farmers\r\n\r\nliving  in  the rural areas will, in fact,  have  their\r\n\r\ninterests safeguarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.34 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tan Kia Gan, in reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, the Member for Pasir Panjang,\r\n\r\nthe Member for Choa Chu Kang and the Member for Changi.\r\n\r\nthree Members in the Barisan Sosialis front -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> We live in Tampines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> They live in Tampines.

The complaints of  the  rural\r\n\r\nfolks,  the  farmers and the fishermen abut the  damage\r\n\r\nthat  they  had suffered because of the sand operations\r\n\r\nare  of  long  standing, but the previous  Governments,\r\n\r\nbecause  of vested interests or for reasons best  known\r\n\r\nto  themselves, had not looked into the  grievances  of\r\n\r\nthe farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Might I remind the Minister that\r\n\r\nhe is replying to the debate? Therefore, he cannot make\r\n\r\nanother  Second  Reading speech.  In  replying  to  the\r\n\r\ndebate,  he  must  answer  the  points  raised  by  the\r\n\r\nspeakers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> The complaints of these rural folks,\r\n\r\nfarmers  and fishermen were brought to the  Member  for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim when he was Minister, when he was responsible\r\n\r\nfor  rural matters. But again the farmers and the rural\r\n\r\npeople  received no redress. The sand operators carried\r\n\r\non  with their operations, doing more damage and making\r\n\r\nthemselves  a  nuisance. This resulted in  my  Ministry\r\n\r\ntaking  drastic action to apply for an injunction  from\r\n\r\nthe  High  Court  to stop them from carrying  out  sand\r\n\r\noperations  that  would  cause  damage  to  the   rural\r\n\r\nresidents.  The Bill now before the House provides  all\r\n\r\nthe  necessary safeguards to ensure that damage to  the\r\n\r\nfarmers will be prevented or minimised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also intended that the regulations made under\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of this Bill will help the  farmers  to\r\n\r\nestablish  liability  for the damage  caused  to  their\r\n\r\nproperty. Hitherto, it was not easy for the farmers  to\r\n\r\nmake  any  claim for compensation even though they  had\r\n\r\nsuffered  considerable  damage  as  a  result  of   the\r\n\r\nflooding  caused by sand operators. It is  intended  to\r\n\r\nseek  the assistance of the Legal Aid Bureau to provide\r\n\r\nthe farmers and rural folks with the necessary help  in\r\n\r\ntheir  claims for compensation, should any damage arise\r\n\r\nfrom sand operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the further possibility of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  doing the work of desilting and  recovering\r\n\r\nthe  cost of such work from the security deposit  which\r\n\r\nmust  be  put  down  by  the sand  operators  with  the\r\n\r\nlicensing  officer before a licence is issued.  In  the\r\n\r\nevent of the operators not abiding by the rules of  the\r\n\r\ngame,  it  will  be  possible  for  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nwithhold  their  licences  and  to  prevent  them  from\r\n\r\noperating.  There have been occasions when  mischievous\r\n\r\noperators have tried to frustrate Government's  attempt\r\n\r\nto reach an amicable settlement between the farmers and\r\n\r\nthe  sand  opera, tors. These sand operators have  only\r\n\r\nthemselves to blame if their licences are suspended  or\r\n\r\nrevoked. If they play the game according to the  rules,\r\n\r\nthey  will  find that the Government is just and  fair.\r\n\r\nBut  if  they  think that they can  get  away  with  it\r\n\r\nbecause   there   are  loop-holes   in   the   existing\r\n\r\nlegislation, they are sadly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmistaken,  for  the  Bill is specifically  designed  to\r\n\r\nprevent  mischievous and mercenary sand operators  from\r\n\r\ndoing  harm  and damage to farmers and fishermen,, all\r\n\r\nbecause of their selfish private motives. We are  aware\r\n\r\nthat  the farmers have not been able to obtain  justice\r\n\r\nbecause  of their lack of acquaintance with the process\r\n\r\nof law and also the intricacies of legal procedure. But\r\n\r\nthere  is  little  doubt that they understand  what  is\r\n\r\njustice,  and can differentiate between what  is  right\r\n\r\nand wrong. It is doubtful, however, because of the lack\r\n\r\nof  evidence, whether compensation for damage that  has\r\n\r\nbeen  done  previously  by the sand  operators  can  be\r\n\r\nobtained from them. But the Government will continue to\r\n\r\npursue   this  matter  and  hope  that  the   three-man\r\n\r\ncommittee who has been agreed between both farmers  and\r\n\r\nsand   operators  will  be  able  to   come   to   some\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  finding. Mr Speaker, Sir, we  are  doing\r\n\r\nthis for the helpless farmers and fishermen who had for\r\n\r\nyears   suffered  at  the  hands  of  sand   operators,\r\n\r\nlandowners  and vested interests. For those  who  think\r\n\r\nthat  they  can  get  away  with  their  mischief,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will use whatever there is in its  power  as\r\n\r\nprovided  in  this  Bill to prevent them  from  causing\r\n\r\nfurther damage and nuisance. To those who abide by  the\r\n\r\nlaw  and ensure that, in seeking after profit they will\r\n\r\nnot  in  any  way  adversely affect  their  neighbours'\r\n\r\nproperty,  the Bill provides a fair and  just  way  for\r\n\r\nthem to continue their occupation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill.-[Mr Tan Kia Gan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported, without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That this Assembly do now adjourn.\"---[Dr Toh Chin Chye].\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">eleven minutes to Seven o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1961/19611216/19611216-HA-0152405.pdf\"\">APPENDIX ESTIMATES CONTAINING A VOTE ON ACCOUNT FOR 1963 AND DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATES(Cols 2405-2408)</a><br>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
