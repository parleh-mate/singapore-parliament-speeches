Of\r\n\r\nthe  remaining 27 rentals, there were 25 where the\r\n\r\nrents  remained  unaltered, and  two  cases  of  a\r\n\r\nreduction  of  $10 and $25 per month respectively.\r\n\r\nThe  average  increase in rent was $25,  which  is\r\n\r\nequal to a percentage increase in rent of 16.7 per\r\n\r\ncent. The original rents were based by tender.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) It was previously the policy of the Board of\r\n\r\nTrustees  to review all new shop rentals  after  a\r\n\r\nminimum  of  twelve  months'  tenancy.

The purpose\r\n\r\nof  this Bill is to dispense with that revision in\r\n\r\nrespect of the present year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for seeking this dispensation is that\r\n\r\nit  is not possible to complete the preparation of\r\n\r\nthe electoral rolls for City Council elections  to\r\n\r\nbe  held  in December this year, if a revision  of\r\n\r\nthe  Legislative Assembly rolls  also  has  to  be\r\n\r\ncompleted by 15th September. I am sure, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nall members of this House will agree that it is of\r\n\r\nover-riding importance that elections to the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil should not be further delayed; whereas the\r\n\r\nstatutory  revision  of the  Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nelectoral rolls must become of less importance the\r\n\r\nnearer we get to the time when the whole basis  of\r\n\r\nthe   Legislative  Assembly  franchise   will   be\r\n\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already said, Sir, we hope to\r\n\r\nintroduce  at  an  early date a  Citizenship  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  will  make  provision for  a  new  form  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  That will mean a complete  recasting\r\n\r\nof  the Legislative Assembly electoral rolls,  and\r\n\r\nsince  it  is our intention that the next  general\r\n\r\nelections  to this Assembly shall be held  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of the new franchise, then revision of  the\r\n\r\npresent  electoral  rolls  does  seem  to  be   of\r\n\r\nsecondary value. It will, however, require a  very\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  of work. It is estimated  that  there\r\n\r\nwould be as many as 150,000 changes to be made  as\r\n\r\ncompared with the roll certified in September last\r\n\r\nyear and those changes would occupy the tabulating\r\n\r\nmachines  and  staff of the Statistics  Department\r\n\r\nfor  at least 30 days. Thereafter the roll has  to\r\n\r\nbe  printed and published; we have to give time to\r\n\r\nhear  claims  and  objections,  and  recheck   and\r\n\r\nreprint;  and all that time work on preparing  the\r\n\r\nCity Council electoral rolls would be delayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Sir, if the City Council\r\n\r\nelections are to be held in December, then we must\r\n\r\nenable those concerned with preparing those  rolls\r\n\r\nto  give  every effort to that task alone,  and  I\r\n\r\ntherefore  ask  that  they  be  relieved  of   the\r\n\r\nstatutory  obligation  to revise  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly electoral rolls this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.49 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Their  ex-Chief\r\n\r\nMinister (Mr David Marshall) wanted elections  in\r\n\r\nAugust  this  year, but because of  the  delay  in\r\n\r\nholding  them,  he became disgusted and  resigned.\r\n\r\nNow,  Sir,  may  I  ask  this  question:  Is  this\r\n\r\nminority Government of ten-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

It  is   rather\r\n\r\nalarming  to  us  that  a  temporary  camp  should\r\n\r\nrequire  such a large sum of expenditure,  and  we\r\n\r\nwould like to know the details for which this  sum\r\n\r\nis required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, if I may reply first of all to\r\n\r\nthe  very natural criticism of the hon. Member for\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar  as to why we should spend  a  further\r\n\r\n$200,000  or so on what purports to be a temporary\r\n\r\ncamp,  I  must say that it is unlikely  that  this\r\n\r\ncamp  will not be required for a number of  years.\r\n\r\nWe  have considered the cost of building permanent\r\n\r\naccommodation for the Singapore Battalion, and  we\r\n\r\nshall  want a very large sum indeed if we  are  to\r\n\r\nprovide   permanent  accommodation   up   to   the\r\n\r\nstandards that are expected. It will be  a  figure\r\n\r\nsomewhere  in  the order of ten or twelve  million\r\n\r\ndollars, which is a very big sum and will  make  a\r\n\r\nvery  big  demand on our public works capacity.  I\r\n\r\nthink  it would be prudent, therefore, to work  on\r\n\r\nthe assumption that the Battalion will occupy this\r\n\r\ntemporary  camp for at least two,  three  or  four\r\n\r\nyears,  and  that being so, we must  organise  the\r\n\r\ncamp accordingly. Hon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers   will  remember  that  we  put  up   this\r\n\r\ntemporary camp as rapidly as we could and with the\r\n\r\nminimum  possible accommodation. If we  could  see\r\n\r\nour way to moving the Battalion within a matter of\r\n\r\nmonths, then we could manage in the camp as it  is\r\n\r\ntoday,  but as I said, it is prudent, I think,  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  the Battalion staying there  for  at\r\n\r\nleast  two or three years, and once we posit that,\r\n\r\nwe  must  then  posit that we shall  have  a  full\r\n\r\nBattalion in that camp for a period of a  year  or\r\n\r\ntwo.  That  immediately raises one  big  question,\r\n\r\nand  that is water supply. The site was laid  out\r\n\r\nand  the  main  hutments  were  built  as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible  along the lower contours of the  ground.\r\n\r\nAt the moment they are the only accommodation that\r\n\r\nis  occupied but as the numbers increase, it  will\r\n\r\nbe essential to use the higher levels of that camp\r\n\r\nand  that  means putting in a local  water  supply\r\n\r\nscheme  to get water to the top level of the  camp\r\n\r\nso  that  there is sufficient pressure to  provide\r\n\r\nfor  the  necessary washing and other  facilities,\r\n\r\nand  that  is the expensive item in this vote  for\r\n\r\nwhich  I am now seeking approval; that is an  item\r\n\r\nof $66,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other items which go to make up the sum\r\n\r\nof  $205,300. There is at present no proper  guard\r\n\r\nroom or armoury. These two items are essential  if\r\n\r\nthe  camp  is to continue and the weapons  of  the\r\n\r\nwhole  Battalion are to be kept in the  camp,  and\r\n\r\nthey come to another $33,500. We also must provide\r\n\r\nan  M.T. workshop which will cost about  $17,000.\r\n\r\nThe   Battalion  has  already  got   about   eight\r\n\r\nvehicles.  They are new vehicles.  At  the  moment\r\n\r\nthey  are  standing  in the open  and  it  is  not\r\n\r\neconomical,  hon.  Members will  agree,  to  allow\r\n\r\nmotor transport to stand indefinitely in the open.\r\n\r\nIt  is  also right and proper that the men in  the\r\n\r\nBattalion  should learn to maintain and  do  minor\r\n\r\nrepairs on their own vehicles. For this purpose we\r\n\r\nmust have a proper M.T. shed and workshop, and the\r\n\r\nestimate for that is $17,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another item is a 30-yard range on the camp. We\r\n\r\nmade  no  provision originally for such a  range,\r\n\r\nhoping that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif we were only occupying it for a short period of\r\n\r\ntime, it would be satisfactory to ferry the troops\r\n\r\nfrom the Battalion to other 30-yard ranges. But as\r\n\r\nsoon  as we contemplate staying longer in the camp\r\n\r\nI  think it is essential there should be a 30-yard\r\n\r\nrange  so  that the men can go down  and  practise\r\n\r\nshooting  without the delay and expense  of  being\r\n\r\nferried by lorries all over Singapore Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of other detailed items which\r\n\r\nI can let the hon. Member have but it will perhaps\r\n\r\ntake  too  long to detail to the Assembly  now.  I\r\n\r\nwould give this further assurance, that we do  not\r\n\r\npropose to embark immediately on spending  of  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of this $200,000. There will be phases  and\r\n\r\nthe  first  vital requirements are the armoury  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can  keep their weapons;  getting  the\r\n\r\nwater  supply  up to the top of the hill  so  that\r\n\r\nthey can use those huts at the top; we want to  be\r\n\r\nable to open an officers' mess there. We have five\r\n\r\nlocal   boys  who  are  going  on  officer   cadet\r\n\r\ncourses - three are already up in the Federation  at\r\n\r\nthe  Military College and two more are shortly  to\r\n\r\nleave  for  Australia and will be back within  the\r\n\r\nyear;   and   we   want  to  start   getting   the\r\n\r\nappurtenances of this camp so that we can build up\r\n\r\na spirit in the Battalion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that other Members of this House as\r\n\r\nwell  as  I got considerable satisfaction  out  of\r\n\r\nseeing  the  small  squad on the Queen's  Birthday\r\n\r\nParade  last  week  which  was  the  first  formal\r\n\r\noccasion  on which the Singapore Infantry Regiment\r\n\r\nappeared before the public. If I am not ruled  out\r\n\r\nof  order, I would mention one further point, that\r\n\r\ntwo  more squads will be passing out after recruit\r\n\r\ntraining  on  27th July and if any Member  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  would care to come and see it, I  would  be\r\n\r\nvery happy to arrange it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Chairman, it does\r\n\r\nseem  to  us that there is considerable danger  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government falling between two stools in this\r\n\r\nmatter.  Once  you  decide to  stay  in  temporary\r\n\r\npremises for three or four years, it is inevitable\r\n\r\nthat you will have to put more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney into the venture, into something which later\r\n\r\nyou   propose  to  abandon.  Therefore  there  may\r\n\r\neventually  be  a  considerable  waste  of  public\r\n\r\nmoney.  Once you put money into a particular  site\r\n\r\nwhich you intend to be temporary and then you hold\r\n\r\nit  longer than you at first intended, at the same\r\n\r\ntime   planning  something  which  will  make   it\r\n\r\nnecessary to build a permanent camp somewhere else\r\n\r\nlater,  there is wastage; that seems to me  to  be\r\n\r\nthe  danger which the Government is running  into.\r\n\r\nOf course we are entirely in favour of comfortable\r\n\r\nquarters for the Singapore Battalion in every kind\r\n\r\nof  way  but I think it is only right that  we  on\r\n\r\nthis side of the House should point out the danger\r\n\r\nthat the Government is running into in respect  of\r\n\r\nthe use of public money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I do not think I can accept the\r\n\r\nsuggestion  that  there is a danger  of  waste  on\r\n\r\nthis.  We  have decided to raise a battalion;  you\r\n\r\ncannot  do  it  without  getting  some  place   to\r\n\r\naccommodate it. I think we are all agreed  and  we\r\n\r\nall  fully support the immediate raising  of  this\r\n\r\nBattalion.  I  have already said if  you  wish  to\r\n\r\nbuild  permanent  accommodation it  will  probably\r\n\r\ntake at least two years to do so and the cost will\r\n\r\nbe  someting like twelve million dollars.

At election time,  Sir,\r\n\r\nit is unrealistic to expect newspapers to give the\r\n\r\nParties  enough  publicity.  We  understand  these\r\n\r\nnewspapers   are   mostly  owned   by   capitalist\r\n\r\ninterests  and we cannot expect them to give  fair\r\n\r\nand unbiased reports of the stand of the competing\r\n\r\npolitical Parties. But we have the right, Sir,  to\r\n\r\nexpect  a  Government-controlled radio station  to\r\n\r\ngive  all political Parties the chance to  express\r\n\r\ntheir  ideas  and ideals. It is the job  of  Radio\r\n\r\nMalaya,  whether  in a general election  or  a  by-election,  to  help the working of the  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem.  What harm can there be in giving  legally\r\n\r\nconstituted  political Parties the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nplace their stand thoroughly before the people  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  and  to  persuade  them  to  vote  for   a\r\n\r\nparticular Party?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that all political Parties are\r\n\r\nnow gearing up for the general elections under the\r\n\r\nnew  Constitution.

Surely  it  will  help\r\n\r\nthe  Parties to put over their policies and  Party\r\n\r\nstands  to  the public. The public can  understand\r\n\r\nwhat  the issues are if all Parties are given  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  during election time of  broadcasting\r\n\r\ntheir programmes and stands over Radio Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.23 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, the best reason for the\r\n\r\nGovernment  not  granting  permission  for   Radio\r\n\r\nMalaya to be used has been furnished by the  mover\r\n\r\nof  the  motion,  the Member for Ponggol-Tampenis,\r\n\r\nthis morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Nair) (Seletar):</b> Sir, Government has given its\r\n\r\nearnest  and most careful consideration to the  question\r\n\r\nof   allowing   broadcast   facilities   to   candidates\r\n\r\ncontesting  the  coming Assembly  by-elections  as  were\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the  candidates in the general  elections  in\r\n\r\n1955.  The  questions were whether or  not  broadcasting\r\n\r\nfacilities  should be offered to candidates in  the  by-elections  generally or to those representing  political\r\n\r\nParties  alone. These are the first by-elections  to  be\r\n\r\nheld  since the general elections in 1955. The  question\r\n\r\nis  should  the procedure in a by-election  differ  from\r\n\r\nthat  in  a  general election? The Government  considers\r\n\r\nthat the procedure must differ since in this by-election\r\n\r\nan  electorate of only about 24,000 in number in the two\r\n\r\nconstituencies, namely, Cairnhill and Tanjong Pagar,  is\r\n\r\nconcerned.  The  policy followed  in  the  1955  general\r\n\r\nelection was that representatives of recognised  Parties\r\n\r\nshould be allowed to broadcast and the time was allotted\r\n\r\nto  the different Parties in proportion to the number of\r\n\r\ncandidates  contesting. Only candidates were allowed  to\r\n\r\ngive  those  Party  broadcasts and  they  spoke  not  as\r\n\r\nindividual  candidates to their own constituencies,  but\r\n\r\non  behalf  of their Parties, for all the candidates  of\r\n\r\ntheir  own  Party, throughout Singapore. Their  speeches\r\n\r\nwere  therefore  of  direct  interest  to  all  electors\r\n\r\nthroughout the Island. Independent candidates  were  not\r\n\r\nallowed to broadcast\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  1955 general election because they  would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  speaking only to their own constituencies and thus\r\n\r\nhave had an unfair advantage over Party candidates,  and\r\n\r\nbecause  they were so numerous that it was impracticable\r\n\r\nto  find  time  for  all of them.  Sir,  the  forum-type\r\n\r\nbroadcast was also limited to Party representatives  for\r\n\r\nthe same reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present by-elections, Sir, only the voters in\r\n\r\ntwo  constituencies are concerned and on general grounds\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  justification  to  allow  candidates   to\r\n\r\nbroadcast  to  the  whole of Singapore.  If  only  Party\r\n\r\ncandidates are allowed to broadcast they will  be  given\r\n\r\nmuch  advantage  over Independents, who will  have  good\r\n\r\nreason  to protest at this unfair discrimination against\r\n\r\nthem:  but  if Independents are allowed to broadcast  in\r\n\r\nthis  by-election,  it  would be a  departure  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy and might create a precedent leading\r\n\r\nto  a fantastic state of affairs, especially at the next\r\n\r\ngeneral elections when hundreds of candidates, including\r\n\r\nIndependents,   might   be   contesting   in   the    51\r\n\r\nconstituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration, Sir, was also given to the question of\r\n\r\nwhether a forum, in which all candidates contesting  the\r\n\r\nby-elections  could be invited to take  part,  could  be\r\n\r\nallowed.  This, Sir, is in fact no different  to  giving\r\n\r\nsuch candidates time for broadcasting by himself and  is\r\n\r\nagain   a   departure  from  the  principles, mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, requests were made by the Labour Front and the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party for broadcasting  facilities  for\r\n\r\ntheir candidates contesting these two divisions. As  far\r\n\r\nas  I  am aware, Sir, the other candidates have not made\r\n\r\nsimilar   requests  for  broadcasting  facilities.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  is convinced that to agree to any suggestion\r\n\r\nthat   candidates  in  by-elections  should   be   given\r\n\r\nbroadcasting facilities would conflict with  the  policy\r\n\r\nconcerning  election broadcasts which is  based  on  the\r\n\r\nprinciple that government is by the Party and not by the\r\n\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, Radio Malaya provides a pan-Malayan\r\n\r\nservice  common  to  Singapore  and  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya. We have consulted the Federation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment,  which  is strongly  against  allowing\r\n\r\nbroadcasts  for  by-elections. This  confirms  the\r\n\r\nview   that   it  is  not  desirable  to   provide\r\n\r\nbroadcasting facilities to any candidate  for  the\r\n\r\ncoming by-elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon.

I  do\r\n\r\nthink, Sir, that it is not a question of democracy\r\n\r\nat  all,  nor  has this anything to  do  with  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic rights of candidates. To my view, it is\r\n\r\nmore  a question of the proper use of radio  to  a\r\n\r\njustifiable degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.31 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P.

Jumabhoy:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) So far as is known, there are about 21 business\r\n\r\norganisations which claim to offer to the general public\r\n\r\nthrift,  medical service and benevolent benefits.  There\r\n\r\nare also many insurance companies which offer to policy-holders, some of the same types of benefit but I am  not\r\n\r\ncertain  whether  this  type  of  business  activity  is\r\n\r\nreferred  to  in  this question. I have  assumed  in  my\r\n\r\nanswer  that it is not intended to include the insurance\r\n\r\nbusiness within the scope of this question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The 21 or so organisations to which I have\r\n\r\nreferred offer to their clients or subscribers a variety\r\n\r\nof  benefits, including medical attention from,  doctors\r\n\r\nappointed   by   the  organisation.  They   offer   also\r\n\r\nconfinement and death benefits and in some cases a  form\r\n\r\nof  legal  aid.  A  few organisations  offer  unemployed\r\n\r\nclients assistance in finding employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) There have been about 71 complaints received since\r\n\r\nthe end of 1956 against 7 organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Following the investigation of these complaints,\r\n\r\ncriminal  proceedings are pending in one  case.  Of  the\r\n\r\nremainder,  no  final  decision has  been  taken  on  12\r\n\r\ncomplaints  and  in 58 complaints no  offence  has  been\r\n\r\ndisclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent that criminal proceedings are pending\r\n\r\nand  the  matter is accordingly sub judice, it would  be\r\n\r\nimproper for me to go into any further detail. In so far\r\n\r\nas  the activities of these organisations are within the\r\n\r\nexisting law, it is Government's intention to take such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naction  as may be necessary to regulate their activities\r\n\r\nwith a view to safeguarding the interests of members  of\r\n\r\nthe  public who participate in their schemes.
