Their indulgence  in\r\n\r\nsuch  unlawful  activities affect the  good  name  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  I  would now like to  continue.  The\r\n\r\npublic  must  be  effectively  urged  and  encouraged\r\n\r\nthrough the mass media and the cinemas to be vigilant\r\n\r\nand to give their fullest cooperation in this matter,\r\n\r\nwithout  which success in the enforcement  of  severe\r\n\r\npunishment  of offenders will be very minima).  There\r\n\r\nis  no  doubt  that  there is a need  to  extend  our\r\n\r\nsympathy to the innocent who for some reason has been\r\n\r\nassociated  with anti-social elements, thus  exposing\r\n\r\nthemselves  to evil influences. Nevertheless,  it  is\r\n\r\nclearly essential to ensure that the penalty fits the\r\n\r\ncrime  of drug offences, be they traffickers, pushers\r\n\r\nor peddlers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Addendum on the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment in regard to resettlement has prompted me\r\n\r\nto    highlight   certain   anomalies    that    need\r\n\r\nrectification. The rapid development and expansion of\r\n\r\npublic  amenities has made resettlement of the people\r\n\r\ninevitable.  Today most of the people  have  accepted\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  policy of  mass  resettlement  for\r\n\r\nnational   development.  However,  such   a   massive\r\n\r\nmovement  of  people from their familiar surroundings\r\n\r\nand mode of life as well as their means of livelihood\r\n\r\nhas not been carried out with as little suffering  as\r\n\r\npossible   to  the  people  affected.  Many  affected\r\n\r\nconstituents have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen    greatly   inconvenienced   by   unsympathetic\r\n\r\nbureaucratic  Government  officers  who  show  little\r\n\r\npatience  and  concern  to the people  affected.  The\r\n\r\nResettlement Department has not actually  taken  into\r\n\r\nconsideration the livelihood of the affected  elderly\r\n\r\nfarmers,  in particular those who have been  in  this\r\n\r\noccupation  for  many years. It is  conceivable  that\r\n\r\nthey  cannot adapt themselves easily to the  assembly\r\n\r\nlines  of  factories or building sites. It should  be\r\n\r\nthe  policy  of the Resettlement Department  to  show\r\n\r\nconcern   for   the  livelihood  of   these   people.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, it is not possible to provide alternative\r\n\r\nsites  for  all  farmers  affected  by  resettlement.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Primary Production Department can  assist\r\n\r\nin  alleviating  their plight by  teaching  them  the\r\n\r\nhydroponic  method of growing vegetables and  fruits,\r\n\r\nwhich requires less land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, being uprooted from the villages and kampongs\r\n\r\nis  already a great sacrifice for national  progress,\r\n\r\nbut  to  be deprived of their means of livelihood  is\r\n\r\ntoo high a price for them to pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monetary compensation awards in lieu of\r\n\r\nalternative  farm  sites are  not  adequate.  It  is,\r\n\r\nhowever,  difficult to establish the authenticity  of\r\n\r\ntheir  complaints. Nevertheless, true or false,  they\r\n\r\nare    dissatisfied   and   unhappy.   The   relevant\r\n\r\nauthorities  should look into the matter and  rectify\r\n\r\nany  anomaly that may exist, or make every effort  to\r\n\r\ndispel  any  dissatisfaction in  their  minds.  There\r\n\r\nseems to be no standard rates of compensation for the\r\n\r\nloss  of  fruit  trees,  pig sties,  etc.  There  are\r\n\r\ncomplaints   that  the  affected   people   are   not\r\n\r\ncompensated  with  the  amount originally  quoted  in\r\n\r\nwriting by the resettlement officers. When discussing\r\n\r\nresettlement terms, these unsympathetic officers show\r\n\r\nlittle  patience  with the affected  people  who  are\r\n\r\nilliterate and who are often hurriedly made  to  sign\r\n\r\nstatements or documents without first being  given  a\r\n\r\nclear  explanation. They ~re also told in writing  to\r\n\r\nreport  to  the  resettlement  officers  who  do  not\r\n\r\nindicate  where  they should go. When  they  call  at\r\n\r\nMaxwell Road Office, they are redirected to Toa Payoh\r\n\r\nOffice, without\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napology. This happens time and again. They should  be\r\n\r\nspecifically told where to go and what to do so  that\r\n\r\nthey  need not be inconvenienced or waste unnecessary\r\n\r\ntravelling expenses, valuable time and energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, providing them with alternative accommodation\r\n\r\nat  concessional  rentals for a certain  period  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  help,  but unfortunately these  small-time\r\n\r\nfarmers  who  pay  only  a few  dollars  a  year  for\r\n\r\noccupying  land will definitely find it difficult  to\r\n\r\npay  even  the concessionary rent unless in  addition\r\n\r\nthey  can  be  given priority of suitable employment.\r\n\r\nThey should be given preference when they apply for a\r\n\r\nhawker   licence.  In  Changi  Village  business   is\r\n\r\npractically  bad  for all the shopkeepers.  They  are\r\n\r\nfinding  it difficult to pay their rent, even  though\r\n\r\nthey  are  given special concessions at  the  moment.\r\n\r\nPerhaps   the  Housing  and  Development  Board   can\r\n\r\nconsider deferring the annual increase in their  rent\r\n\r\nuntil  their business improves with the operation  of\r\n\r\nthe new Changi International Airport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Housing and Development Board, on the\r\n\r\nother  hand, must be complimented for its achievement\r\n\r\nin  having completed about a quarter million  housing\r\n\r\nunits   for  55%  of  our  population.  It  is   most\r\n\r\ngratifying to note that the HDB is doing a very  fine\r\n\r\njob and will further accelerate the implementation of\r\n\r\nits  fourth five-year Building Programme for  another\r\n\r\n150,000 units by 1980. This is absolutely encouraging\r\n\r\nas  it  reduces  the  waiting period  for  applicants\r\n\r\nwanting to buy or rent HDB flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this pace of development, the quality\r\n\r\naspect  should  not be sacrificed for quantity.  More\r\n\r\nemphasis must be laid on the quality of construction.\r\n\r\nPresently,  there have been numerous complaints  from\r\n\r\nflat  owners  about  the poor  finish.  Fixtures  and\r\n\r\nfittings  are  haphazardly  completed.  This   merely\r\n\r\nproves  that  there  has been a lack  of  proper  and\r\n\r\nvigilant  supervision by HDB which takes over  blocks\r\n\r\nof flats from contractors without first conducting  a\r\n\r\nfull inspection of the flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problem does not end there. The HDB does\r\n\r\nnot spell out its instructions clearly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  tenants  in  regard to regulations governing  the\r\n\r\nrenovation  of  flats. Usually  after  a  tenant  has\r\n\r\ncompleted  renovation  works,  the  bureaucratic  HDB\r\n\r\nofficers  will  then come to give  a  notice  to  the\r\n\r\ntenant  ordering him to reduce the thickness  of  the\r\n\r\nflooring  because  the thickness of  the  screed  has\r\n\r\nexceeded the maximum allowed by the Board. But at the\r\n\r\ntime  when application for renovation of the flat  is\r\n\r\nmade  to  the  Board, the tenant is not  informed  of\r\n\r\ncertain  restrictions.  However,  when  tenants  make\r\n\r\ncomplaints to the Board about the slipshod work  done\r\n\r\nby  the contractors, the HDB officers show no concern\r\n\r\nat   all,  except  remarking  that  the  defects  are\r\n\r\nminimal. One wonders sometimes why slipshod  work  on\r\n\r\nthe part of contractors is condoned by the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of the shortcomings of the HDB are\r\n\r\ncausing  concern  among tenants as well  as  would-be\r\n\r\ntenants of H DB accommodation. All these shortcomings\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  thrusted down  the  throats  of  the\r\n\r\ntenants.  Nevertheless, we are proud that  the  HDB's\r\n\r\nachievement is second to none in other parts  of  the\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

These are positive measures\r\n\r\nwhich  go  along with the building of  HDB  and  HUDC\r\n\r\nflats.  However, we must not forget that  the  rising\r\n\r\ncost of leisure is now borne by the general public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the general public, the Government has\r\n\r\nestablished   parks,  swimming  pools  and   lagoons,\r\n\r\nzoological  gardens and other scenic spots  like  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  and  Chinese gardens  and  have,  at  most,\r\n\r\nlevied a small fee far within the reach of the common\r\n\r\ncitizen.  The fee is to cover operating costs.  There\r\n\r\nare  some  other places where no fees are  levied  at\r\n\r\nall. These exceptions should not be taken for granted\r\n\r\nwithout  regard  to  the funds and  effort  put  into\r\n\r\nrealizing   these   facilities.  Private   enterprise\r\n\r\nestablishments which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovide entertainment for the general public, such as\r\n\r\nthe  cinemas, have kept their prices within the reach\r\n\r\nof the general public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fact that nothing is for free, and that all\r\n\r\nneeds  will  have  to compete with  one  another  for\r\n\r\nresources to realise them. Leisure establishments set\r\n\r\nup  by  private  enterprises are  required  by  their\r\n\r\nowners   to  cover  costs  and  eventually   make   a\r\n\r\nreasonable  return on the capital invested.  Citizens\r\n\r\nwho  wish to patronise these establishments, such  as\r\n\r\nnightclubs,  bowling alleys and golf clubs,  must  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  pay for these facilities. In  order  to\r\n\r\ntake  a  lead in the leisure business, the Government\r\n\r\nhas  invested  in  leisure enterprises  such  as  the\r\n\r\nSentosa  Golf Club and the Jurong Golf Club  -  these\r\n\r\nenterprises are expected to cover not only costs  but\r\n\r\nalso   to   yield  a  reasonable  return  on  capital\r\n\r\ninvested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The takeover of the chalets at Sentosa by a local\r\n\r\nhotel  has invited comments from the general  public.\r\n\r\nAccording  to the plans of the hotel, the area  will,\r\n\r\nbe   further  developed  involving  a  large  capital\r\n\r\noutlay.  Members of the public have anticipated  that\r\n\r\nthe  present high rentals of these chalets will  rise\r\n\r\neven   further,  beyond  the  reach  of  the   common\r\n\r\nSingaporean  who  wishes to  spend  his  vacation  or\r\n\r\nweekend there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxurious leisure will always be expensive and\r\n\r\nexclusive to those who can and wish to pay for  them.\r\n\r\nSimple leisure has yet to be priced out of the  reach\r\n\r\nof the common Singaporean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the proliferation of unlicensed\r\n\r\nhawkers has been brought under control. Nevertheless,\r\n\r\nthere  are still hawkers who for some reason are  not\r\n\r\nbeing issued with licences, As a result of this, they\r\n\r\nare   constantly  harassed  by  inspectors  from  the\r\n\r\nHawkers  Department. These inspectors swoop  down  on\r\n\r\nthem  in  the most inhuman way, raiding them  like  a\r\n\r\npolice  party  raiding a gangster  hideout.  Hawkers,\r\n\r\nyoung and old, have to leave behind their wares,  and\r\n\r\nsometimes even their money is scattered all over  the\r\n\r\nplace, and to run for their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConveniently, the goods are carted away  as  if  they\r\n\r\nare contrabands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

With  this overwhelming support,  the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment   has   to   exercise   its   power   with\r\n\r\ncircumspection  and  moderation. The  President  also\r\n\r\nsaid  that  all  major policies and legislation  will\r\n\r\nhave to be closely scrutinised before implementation.\r\n\r\nThis  is  quite  to the point, and it  expresses  the\r\n\r\ndesire  of  the  people.  In fact,  other  than  some\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards, the legislation of most government\r\n\r\ndepartments  has  been brought up to  Parliament  for\r\n\r\nscrutiny and debate. But the problem arises after its\r\n\r\ndebate  in  Parliament when it is put into  practice.\r\n\r\nThere will be certain aberrations and inconsistencies\r\n\r\nin   the   administrative  process,  where   officers\r\n\r\nconcerned usually shirk their duty, thinking that  by\r\n\r\ndoing less fewer mistakes will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade,  and  that if they did nothing they  would  not\r\n\r\ncommit any mistakes at all. So in the end, the voters\r\n\r\nwill  get nowhere. They would have wasted their  time\r\n\r\nand money in dealing with the Government departments.\r\n\r\nOfficers  in  some  Government departments  are  just\r\n\r\nnonchalant in their attitude and keep themselves away\r\n\r\nfrom  their  post.  They make no attempt  to  try  to\r\n\r\nunderstand the problems and the needs of the  people.\r\n\r\nInstead    they   cause   the   people    unnecessary\r\n\r\ninconvenience. Let me quote some examples. In October\r\n\r\nlast year, the newspapers stated that one, Chou Tieng\r\n\r\nShiang, living in a HDB flat was suffering from  some\r\n\r\nchronic  illness  and could not  work  and  therefore\r\n\r\ncould not pay his rental. He was subsequently evicted\r\n\r\nby  the HDB. When this appeared in the press, members\r\n\r\nof the public rallied round to help him. When the HDB\r\n\r\nheard  about this, they finally allowed him to return\r\n\r\nto  his  flat. The HDB could have been more  tolerant\r\n\r\nand  liaised  with the Social Welfare Department  for\r\n\r\nhelp. This illustrates the unsympathetic attitude  on\r\n\r\nthe part of the HDB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another occasion, in September last year it was\r\n\r\nreported  in  the  newspapers  that  the  HDB  issued\r\n\r\nnotices to applicants of flats inquiring whether they\r\n\r\nwould be carrying out renovation works to the kitchen\r\n\r\nand  toilet with mosaic. The notice asked for a reply\r\n\r\nwithin 10 days failing which their right to apply for\r\n\r\nthe  flat would be cancelled. Sir, this is too  harsh\r\n\r\non  them. Many applicants receive the notice late, as\r\n\r\nthe  date  for  a  reply stamped on  the  notice  has\r\n\r\nexpired;  if  not,  only a few days  left  to  reply.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  the notice `does not state how  much  more\r\n\r\nprice  they have to pay after such renovation  works.\r\n\r\nIn  the  end, the applicants are confounded over  the\r\n\r\nwhole thing and do not know what to do. So they blame\r\n\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our meet-the-people sessions in the various\r\n\r\nconstituencies  we  find  a  great  number  of   such\r\n\r\ncomplaints.  The attitude of the HDB in dealing  with\r\n\r\nsuch  cases  is  really  too  harsh.  It  should   be\r\n\r\nrectified    and    improved.   All    notices    and\r\n\r\nadministrative action formulated by the HDB should be\r\n\r\nconsidered by Government leaders before promulgation.\r\n\r\nWe are told that by 1980\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout 75% of the population of Singapore, namely  two\r\n\r\nmillion  people,  will be housed in HDB  flats.  They\r\n\r\nwill  decide in future which Party should be returned\r\n\r\nto  power, who will form the government. If we do not\r\n\r\nthink  about these matters, the consequences  may  be\r\n\r\nunsavoury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps we need not dwell too much on the\r\n\r\nefficiency  and ability of Government  officers.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  in  January this year a  family  in  Bukit\r\n\r\nMerah  was hard-pressed financially. The householder,\r\n\r\nan  elderly widow, was a hawker but she was not given\r\n\r\na  licence  to hawk. Being unable to make ends  meet,\r\n\r\nthe  mother and daughter shut themselves in the  flat\r\n\r\nand  burned  themselves to death. This  very  pitiful\r\n\r\nincident calls for our attention, however rare it may\r\n\r\nbe  in  our  society. When the officers  come  across\r\n\r\ncases   of  extenuating  circumstances, they  should\r\n\r\ninquire  into them and lend a helping hand in getting\r\n\r\nthem  a  hawker's  licence or  liaising  with  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare Department. The people concerned should  also\r\n\r\nget  in touch with the MP or the CCC in that area  so\r\n\r\nas  to avail themselves of better means to help solve\r\n\r\ntheir problems. However, it is a pity that out of  so\r\n\r\nmany  thousands of officers in the various Government\r\n\r\ndepartments such as the Hawkers Department, the  HDB,\r\n\r\nand  the PUB there was hardly any one who ever  tried\r\n\r\nto  come out to study the problems of the unfortunate\r\n\r\npeople  and to render help to such people who are  in\r\n\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is correct to stress in the Presidential\r\n\r\nAddress that we must get from each his best and  give\r\n\r\nto each according to his performance, since Singapore\r\n\r\nis  a tiny island without any natural resources.  Our\r\n\r\nonly  resource is manpower in spite of our  excellent\r\n\r\ngeographical  position and rewarding entrepot  trade.\r\n\r\nEven the footpath is formed by constant trodding.  So\r\n\r\neverything  has to depend on our human resources.  As\r\n\r\nwe  have  no  other  resources,  our  able  political\r\n\r\nleadership  has to mobilise the whole population  and\r\n\r\nconsolidate their boundless energy and strength  into\r\n\r\na  concerted  effort in nation building and  economic\r\n\r\nprogress of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a new country. Since her\r\n\r\nfoundation,  upon  which strenuous efforts  had  been\r\n\r\nmade, education has been spread quite widely and  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  level  of education of the  people  is  also\r\n\r\nrising,  hopefully  to a high standard.  But  with  a\r\n\r\nshort  history  and  a  limited  economy,  we  cannot\r\n\r\nproduce a greater number of people with a high  level\r\n\r\nof  education. Differences in level of education make\r\n\r\nfor    differences   in   life-style    and    career\r\n\r\nexpectations,  resulting in  the  fortunate  and  the\r\n\r\nunfortunate. The few fortunate people can  enjoy  the\r\n\r\nbenefits of higher education and reap greater wealth.\r\n\r\nThey  are  the ones who are better able  to  give  of\r\n\r\ntheir  best  with higher performance, and of  course,\r\n\r\nthey  get higher rewards. The others, however, those\r\n\r\nunfortunate  ones with poor education  and  who  come\r\n\r\nfrom  poorer families who have been toiling hard  all\r\n\r\ntheir lives contributing their best, because of their\r\n\r\ncircumstances  and  without  the  benefit  of  higher\r\n\r\neducation,  still cannot reach the higher bracket  of\r\n\r\nreward  according to their performance, however  hard\r\n\r\nthey exert themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so far we have issued hundreds of thousands of\r\n\r\nwork  permits  to foreign labourers to  work  in  our\r\n\r\nindustries.  In  the long run, are  we  sure  whether\r\n\r\nforeign  labour will serve our national interest,  or\r\n\r\nwill  they  not bring about more social problems  and\r\n\r\nother  burden  to us? There is a saying  that  rather\r\n\r\nthan  depend  on  others, we  should  depend  on  our\r\n\r\nownselves. For long term social security and  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of our nationals, we should look  into  the\r\n\r\nreasons why our own citizens do not want to join  the\r\n\r\nlabour  force. Perhaps we should improve the  working\r\n\r\nconditions of the workers. Why should certain workers\r\n\r\nbe  required  to work 30 days a month,  while  others\r\n\r\nonly 24 days? Why can we not allow certain categories\r\n\r\nof  workers to be paid monthly and to let them  enjoy\r\n\r\nthe  same working conditions as others? There  should\r\n\r\nnot  be any discrimination in the labour force.  Sir,\r\n\r\neach  one of us must contribute our best in order  to\r\n\r\nget the reward according to our worth. We should also\r\n\r\ntry our best for rewards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccording  to our labour, so that better  recognition\r\n\r\nmay  be given to the importance of the labourers, who\r\n\r\nare  the  less fortunate lot, in our nation building.\r\n\r\nWe  should  create an amiable environment and  better\r\n\r\nworking  conditions for all workers so that they  may\r\n\r\nenjoy  a  better  livelihood and the good  things  in\r\n\r\nlife,  so  that  they can be proud of themselves.  We\r\n\r\nshould  enable all our nationals who are contributing\r\n\r\nto  the  Central  Provident  Fund  to  utilise  their\r\n\r\ncontributions to buy their own flats and be contented\r\n\r\nwith   their  lot,  so  that  they  could  think   of\r\n\r\nthemselves  as  part-owners  of  Singapore  and  feel\r\n\r\nsecure  and  happy living in Singapore.  Perhaps, we\r\n\r\nshould go a step further by making a survey of  their\r\n\r\nmonthly  needs,  how much they spend  a  month  on  a\r\n\r\nfamily  of  four or five members so as  to  determine\r\n\r\ntheir  cost  of  living.  On  this  basis  we  should\r\n\r\nformulate  their monthly wages so that they  may  get\r\n\r\nthe  necessary  means for their basic livelihood  and\r\n\r\nsurvival, adapting themselves to the environment  and\r\n\r\nbe happy and contented in their career and their lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on behalf of my constituents, I thank the\r\n\r\nPresident for his Address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ahmad Haleem (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Motion\r\n\r\nmoved  by  the  Member for Ulu Pandan expressing  our\r\n\r\nthanks  to  the  President for the  speech  which  he\r\n\r\ndelivered on behalf of the Government at the  opening\r\n\r\nof the First Session of this Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  world is currently experiencing an energy crisis\r\n\r\nand  governments  are greatly concerned  with  energy\r\n\r\nresources  and  their management.

From  time  to  time  there   have   been\r\n\r\ncampaigns over the press, radio and television urging\r\n\r\nthe  public to save power and electricity.

Sir, that there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  a  way to do this. It is simple and the  cost  is\r\n\r\nminimal.  I  am, Sir, talking about Daylight  Saving.\r\n\r\nThis  easy-to-implement device could be brought  into\r\n\r\neffect by advancing the clock by one hour at midnight\r\n\r\non  a  chosen  day.  It  will cause  the  minimum  of\r\n\r\ninconvenience as, apart from advancing the  clock  by\r\n\r\none  hour, there will be no other changes in our time\r\n\r\nschedule.  Dawn  will then be at six o'clock  in  the\r\n\r\nmorning instead of at five o'clock and sunset at 7.30\r\n\r\nin  the evening instead of at 6.30. These are some of\r\n\r\nthe areas where power consumption would be reduced by\r\n\r\nthe  introduction of Daylight Saving - in our  homes,\r\n\r\nin   public   places,   sports  facilities,   lighted\r\n\r\nadvertisements, and in industries running a two-shift\r\n\r\nsystem.  Side benefits from implementing this  scheme\r\n\r\nare  many.  Our  people, who are being encouraged  to\r\n\r\ntake   part  in  all  forms  of  sports  and  outdoor\r\n\r\nactivities,  would have an extra hour of daylight  in\r\n\r\nthe  evenings,  in  which to better  enjoy  the  many\r\n\r\nexcellent facilities which are being set up for  this\r\n\r\npurpose. One benefit that I foresee and which, to  my\r\n\r\nmind,  is  very important is that parents  and  their\r\n\r\nchildren will have an additional hour of daylight  in\r\n\r\nwhich they can enjoy family games and recreation  out\r\n\r\nof  doors, to kick a ball or like one Member  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  told  me. \"to fly a kite\", and so do  much  to\r\n\r\nfurther good parent/child relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internationally, our advancing the clock by one\r\n\r\nhour  should  be  just  a minor  adjustment  for  our\r\n\r\ntrading  partners to make. With the  introduction  of\r\n\r\nDaylight Saving, all school fields could be opened up\r\n\r\nafter  school, and football fields and all the  games\r\n\r\ncourts  would  be better used. Even if  these  spaces\r\n\r\nwere made available to our people they would still be\r\n\r\ninsufficient to meet our needs. I, therefore, welcome\r\n\r\nthe  Sports  Council Master Plan for the building  of\r\n\r\nsquash  and  tennis courts, swimming pools,  football\r\n\r\npitches,  fitness parks and the multi-purpose  indoor\r\n\r\nstadia.  Unfortunately, I feel that the Master  Plan,\r\n\r\nfor  the  most  part,  caters for  the  \"have's\"  and\r\n\r\nneglects  the \"have-not's\". You will notice  most  of\r\n\r\nthe    facilities   are   revenue-generating.    This\r\n\r\nimmediately  eliminates  our  younger  citizens   who\r\n\r\ncannot pay but whose needs for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopen  fields  and games courts should be  recognised.\r\n\r\nThey  need  more facilities where team games  can  be\r\n\r\nplayed,  spontaneously, and  where  easy  mixing  and\r\n\r\nintegration  of  our  people will  be  encouraged.  I\r\n\r\ndisagree with the Sports Council's rationale in their\r\n\r\nSports  for All policy where the emphasis is on  mass\r\n\r\nparticipation and they do not feel the need to aim at\r\n\r\nproducing champions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is human nature that the presence of a champion\r\n\r\nleader  encourages  others to  follow.  The  case  of\r\n\r\nbadminton is a good example of this. In the 50's when\r\n\r\nthe  standard of our players then taking part in  the\r\n\r\nThomas Cup and the All England Championship was  very\r\n\r\nhigh, badminton was extremely popular. The popularity\r\n\r\nof  badminton has greatly waned, now that we  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger  producing champions. In the same way,  if  we\r\n\r\nwish   to  popularise  other  sports  and  get   more\r\n\r\nparticipants, we must also produce champions  in  all\r\n\r\nfields. Every schoolboy wants to be a Pele or a  Mark\r\n\r\nSpitz.  Our constituency games also are not  popular.\r\n\r\nFor  many constituencies the reasons they are  unable\r\n\r\nto   produce  good  teams  are  lack  of  money   and\r\n\r\nfacilities.  I am not advocating paying  participants\r\n\r\nto  take  part in sports. Far from it. I am  entirely\r\n\r\nagainst this policy, but in order to produce  a  good\r\n\r\nside   it   is  necessary  to  hold  regular   intra-constituency\r\n\r\ntournaments and to arrange many practice\r\n\r\nsessions. All these require facilities and money.  It\r\n\r\nis  unfair and undesirable for the constituency to go\r\n\r\naround   asking  their  constituents   for   frequent\r\n\r\ndonations. Therefore, I suggest that the constituency\r\n\r\nsports  rules be amended to allow for sponsorship  by\r\n\r\nbusiness  firms.  Of course, when a company  sponsors\r\n\r\nthe  sports in the constituency, they would  like  to\r\n\r\nsee a return for their money. We should allow players\r\n\r\nto  use  the firm's logos on their jerseys.  In  this\r\n\r\nway,  both parties will benefit. I would still expect\r\n\r\nthe  grant  from  the  Sports  Council  to  continue.\r\n\r\nbecause  every  cent that can be gathered  will  help\r\n\r\nimmensely towards the promotion of sports.  I  should\r\n\r\nalso like to see our champions and gold medal winners\r\n\r\nwho  represent  Singapore and  bring  honour  to  our\r\n\r\ncountry, rewarded by giving them priority\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallocation for housing. Anyone who knows and sees the\r\n\r\nlong hours of practice a winner must put in, will not\r\n\r\nbegrudge him this privilege.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board should build more\r\n\r\nsports   facilities  in  their  estates.   When   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was first considering how to  tackle  the\r\n\r\nproblem of' resettling large numbers of our citizens,\r\n\r\ntheir  primary concern, and rightly so, was to  build\r\n\r\nhousing  units  as  fast  as possible.  We  have  now\r\n\r\nreached   a  stage  where  quantity  alone   is   not\r\n\r\nsufficient  to  meet the total needs of  our  people.\r\n\r\nTheir physical needs are well catered for in spacious\r\n\r\nand  sanitary housing, shops and markets, clinics and\r\n\r\nother services. Now is the time to consider how  best\r\n\r\nto  meet  their  emotional needs  to  bring  about  a\r\n\r\nhealthy   sense   of   integration   in   their   new\r\n\r\nenvironment,  Open  spaces in the estates  should  be\r\n\r\nconverted  into  children's  playgrounds,  games  and\r\n\r\nfamily  recreation  areas.  It  is  insufficient   to\r\n\r\nprovide  new parks in selected areas because  parents\r\n\r\nwould much prefer their children to play nearer their\r\n\r\nhomes,  to  kick a ball around, scream and shout  and\r\n\r\nallow healthy daily outlets for their natural drives.\r\n\r\nIf  immediate  provision is not found for  expressing\r\n\r\nthese drives, they will be suppressed, and we will be\r\n\r\nfacing a generation of maladjusted young citizens  in\r\n\r\nthe  near  future. Drug problems and other  unhealthy\r\n\r\nmanifestations of this repression will most certainly\r\n\r\nincrease  by  leaps and bounds. Apart from  providing\r\n\r\nplay  areas,  all  housing  estates  should  have   a\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre  built at  the  same  time  as  the\r\n\r\nhousing units. Citizens should not have to wait until\r\n\r\nsufficient   money   has  been  accumulated   through\r\n\r\ndonations and fund raising. Of course, improvement to\r\n\r\ncommunity centres should be borne by the constituents\r\n\r\nbut  the basic structure of a community centre  which\r\n\r\nwould  cost in the region of $400,000 should be borne\r\n\r\nby  the  Government,  and this should  be  given  top\r\n\r\npriority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1980 the estimated number of people who will\r\n\r\nlive  in HDB flats will be two million. We do have  a\r\n\r\nZoo where our children can see\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanimals,  both wild and domesticated, but because  of\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  rule that no pets are allowed and  together\r\n\r\nwith  the high cost of going to the Zoo, we will very\r\n\r\nsoon  have  a generation of children who  will  think\r\n\r\nthat  a chicken comes in a plastic bag. Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nstrongly  suggest  that  an area,  perhaps  near  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre,  be  set  aside  where   a   small\r\n\r\nmenagerie  of  domesticated animals  could  be  kept.\r\n\r\nPeople  moving  into flats for the first  time  often\r\n\r\nhave  to abandon pets because they can no longer keep\r\n\r\nthem. This is hard on both pets and their owners. How\r\n\r\nmuch  better  if  they could bring their  pets  to  a\r\n\r\ncentre  where they could be adopted and looked  after\r\n\r\nby  the children of the estate, thereby instilling in\r\n\r\nthe  young  a  respect and understanding of  animals.\r\n\r\nValuable lessons and attitudes will be inculcated and\r\n\r\nwill  influence  the  kind of environment  which  our\r\n\r\nchildren will produce in time to come. This would  be\r\n\r\ncomplementary  to our design for a clean,  green  and\r\n\r\nhealthy Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we build new estates, immediate consideration\r\n\r\nshould be given to the provision of bus services.  In\r\n\r\nthe  past, bus services to housing estates only begin\r\n\r\nafter  the  majority of people have  moved  in.  This\r\n\r\nmeans  that  the  early occupants may  have  to  wait\r\n\r\nmonths,  perhaps years, before adequate bus  services\r\n\r\nare provided. This situation should be remedied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the Area Licensing Scheme has\r\n\r\ndone  much  to reduce road congestion but  a  further\r\n\r\nmeasure  which  should be looked  into  concerns  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of lane discipline. One  only  needs  to\r\n\r\ntake an hour's drive on Singapore roads to be able to\r\n\r\npick out more than 50 offenders against the rules  of\r\n\r\nlane discipline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe our highway code rule does state that all\r\n\r\nmotorists should keep left unless overtaking. At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  slow moving traffic is seen keeping  to  the\r\n\r\nright-hand  lane,  forcing faster moving  traffic  to\r\n\r\novertake  on  the left. No doubt our system  of  road\r\n\r\ntraffic  management has met with considerable  praise\r\n\r\ninternationally, but I feel that tighter  control  of\r\n\r\nlane   discipline   would  bring  about   even   more\r\n\r\nimprovement and fast, safer traffic flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the situation on our roads is steadily\r\n\r\nimproving  a  problem has arisen in another  area  of\r\n\r\ncommunications  because of the  transfer  of  lighter\r\n\r\noperations from Telok Ayer Basin to Pasir Panjang. At\r\n\r\ncertain times of the year when the sea there is  very\r\n\r\nrough,  our  lightermen experience great difficulties\r\n\r\nin  loading and unloading. It would be desirable  and\r\n\r\nless  hazardous to have a bigger breakwater at  Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang  wharves to allow our lighters  to  load  and\r\n\r\nunload in calmer waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for security in our ports is unquestioned\r\n\r\nbut  the  very strict ruling applied by the  Port  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  Authority  for  the  issue  of  passes  is\r\n\r\ncausing  hardship  to a number of people.  These  are\r\n\r\npeople  whose livelihood depends upon going into  the\r\n\r\nport  area  and who have suddenly found their  passes\r\n\r\ncancelled  because  of some minor  offence  committed\r\n\r\nmany  years earlier for which they have already  been\r\n\r\npunished. They should not be punished again. I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore  urge  the Port of Singapore  Authority  to\r\n\r\nreview  their ruling and to reinstate the  passes  of\r\n\r\nthese  people if they have committed only  one  minor\r\n\r\noffence,  not  less than five years  prior  to  their\r\n\r\napplication. In this way our petty offender  who  has\r\n\r\nbeen going straight will not feel persecuted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point was touched upon by the Member for\r\n\r\nKallang  but  I feel that we do have a  situation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore where there are many stateless persons  who\r\n\r\nare   blue  identity  card  holders.  In  the   final\r\n\r\nanalysis, the Singapore Government is responsible for\r\n\r\nthese  people;  so our objective must  surely  be  to\r\n\r\nintegrate  and  educate them and to eventually  grant\r\n\r\nthem  citizenship. When this happens, our  dependence\r\n\r\nupon  guest  workers would be less.  At  the  moment,\r\n\r\nhowever,  in  order  to obtain  work,  our  permanent\r\n\r\nresidents have to obtain a work permit. This  creates\r\n\r\na   situation   where   small   employers   find   it\r\n\r\ninconvenient  to employ them and larger  firms  often\r\n\r\ncannot  be  bothered.  There  are  also  unscrupulous\r\n\r\nemployers  who  exploit  the  situation.  I  strongly\r\n\r\nsuggest  that the Ministry look into the  feasibility\r\n\r\nof abolishing work permit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequirements  for  our permanent  residents  who  are\r\n\r\nstateless persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our citizens have now grown to accept the\r\n\r\ndesirability of National Service and I know  of  many\r\n\r\nyoung  people who are looking forward to doing  their\r\n\r\nduty for their country. There are, however, many  who\r\n\r\nare  frustrated because they are not selected  to  do\r\n\r\neither full-time or part-time National Service.  They\r\n\r\nfeel doubly frustrated because not only are they  not\r\n\r\nable to discharge their duty, but employers also  are\r\n\r\nreluctant to employ them. It is unlikely that  youths\r\n\r\nnot  selected within one year of attaining their 18th\r\n\r\nbirthday  will  be selected at a later  date  because\r\n\r\nthere will be a new batch of eligible young men  each\r\n\r\nsubsequent  year. I therefore urge the Government  to\r\n\r\nlook  into  this  question  and  to  consider  either\r\n\r\ncalling them up for some other form of service or, if\r\n\r\nthey  are  not  called up by their 19th birthday,  to\r\n\r\ngrant them deferment, subject to recall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion moved by the Member for\r\n\r\nUlu Pandan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the\r\n\r\nMotion  moved by the Member for Ulu Pandan expressing\r\n\r\nour  thanks to the President for his Speech delivered\r\n\r\nat the opening of this Fourth Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President, in his speech, enunciated the\r\n\r\npolicies  which will be carried out in the next  five\r\n\r\nyears.  The  people  are enabled  to  understand  the\r\n\r\nvarious  programmes for action and reforms, the  most\r\n\r\nimportant  being  the new measures contained  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious Addenda of the various ministries, which  are\r\n\r\nfor  the benefit of the people and the nation,  meant\r\n\r\nto  inspire  the people to contribute  their  efforts\r\n\r\ntowards nation building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the general elections last year the people\r\n\r\nelected  all  the 69 PAP candidates into this  House.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  massive support and trust given  by  the\r\n\r\npeople  to  the People's Action Party and  they  know\r\n\r\nthat  although  we have a one-party  Parliament,  the\r\n\r\nMembers  of Parliament will not do things recklessly.\r\n\r\nThis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas also enhanced our responsibility as Backbenchers.\r\n\r\nAs   Backbenchers,  although  we  are  part  of   the\r\n\r\ngoverning  Party, we have to play  the  role  of  the\r\n\r\nopposition  and exercise our right to  criticise  and\r\n\r\nsupervise  the work of the Government and to  reflect\r\n\r\nthe  views  of  our constituents so as to  serve  the\r\n\r\npeople and the nation with dedication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the main feature of the policy\r\n\r\nspeech  is that in the next five years the Government\r\n\r\nwill  give  priority to looking after and  developing\r\n\r\nthe   less   privileged  areas  as  they  need   more\r\n\r\nattention. Such policy is both correct and  laudable,\r\n\r\nbecause  to help the well to-do is well and good  but\r\n\r\nto  do  some  good  to the poor  and  needy  is  more\r\n\r\nsignificant   of   good  government   and   will   be\r\n\r\nappreciated  by the people. Sir, it is gratifying  to\r\n\r\nnote  that  more  money  will  be  provided  for  the\r\n\r\ndevelopmental  needs of the rural areas.  This  means\r\n\r\nthat  more  laterite  roads will  be  metalled,  more\r\n\r\nwooden  bridges will be replaced by concrete  bridges\r\n\r\nand  more  country tracks and roads will be  lighted.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  rural  area has  shrunk  it  is  still\r\n\r\nextensive in area and so it needs more money for  the\r\n\r\namelioration of the living environment of the country\r\n\r\nfolk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what the people in the rural areas find most\r\n\r\ndistressing  is  the  question  of  resettlement,  as\r\n\r\ntouched  upon by the Member for Changi. We  all  know\r\n\r\nthat because of the scarcity of land and the need for\r\n\r\nindustrialisation,   housing   etc, we   have    to\r\n\r\nrequisition more land from the rural areas. There  is\r\n\r\nnothing wrong with this. Generally, the people in the\r\n\r\nrural areas understand this and they are prepared  to\r\n\r\nsacrifice  for the long-term interest of the  nation.\r\n\r\nThose  who  are  affected by the resettlement  scheme\r\n\r\nwould  have  to suffer inconvenience as  their  homes\r\n\r\nbuilt over the decades have to be abandoned and  they\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  move to new surroundings.  Everything\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  start from scratch and afresh.  Those\r\n\r\ndepartments  and  officers involved in  resettlement.\r\n\r\nwhether  it  be  the Resettlement Department  or  the\r\n\r\nPrimary  Production Department, must  understand  the\r\n\r\nplight of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  people and try, on the one hand, to minimise the\r\n\r\nhardship and inconvenience caused to the people  and,\r\n\r\non  the  other  hand,  by  all  means  give  adequate\r\n\r\ncompensation to the affected people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past few years, at my meet-the-people\r\n\r\nsessions  I received  various  complaints\r\n\r\nfrom  the villagers and I have found that there is  a\r\n\r\nlack  of  sympathy  on  the part  of  those  who  are\r\n\r\ninvolved  with resettlement affairs. In  most  cases,\r\n\r\nthe  question  centres on whether  a  person  who  is\r\n\r\nengaged in farming activity is a bona fide farmer  or\r\n\r\nnot.  Those  who are adjudged bona fide  farmers  are\r\n\r\nentitled to the allocation of land or alternatively a\r\n\r\nfree  three-room flat and their compensation rate  is\r\n\r\nmuch  higher.  Those  similarly  engaged  in  farming\r\n\r\nactivities  who  are not adjudged bona  fide  farmers\r\n\r\nwill  have to blame their bad luck and look for their\r\n\r\nMP  for  help. The officers who wield such peremptory\r\n\r\npower  are  not from the Resettlement Department  but\r\n\r\nfrom  the Primary Production Department which has  no\r\n\r\ndirect connection with the resettlement scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my understanding, the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department goes about adjudging those  who\r\n\r\nare  affected, whether they are bona tide farmers  or\r\n\r\nnot,  not  according to their actual rural  situation\r\n\r\nbut  superficially on a certain formula  and  certain\r\n\r\nfigures. If the data provided by a person,  be  he  a\r\n\r\nfarmer  or not, do not fit into the formula, then  he\r\n\r\nis  not  considered a bona fide farmer. It  is  quite\r\n\r\ncommon  to see people in the rural areas engaging  in\r\n\r\nfarming  activities.  Some of them  are  small  scale\r\n\r\nfarmers  and  whatever  they  get  is  sufficient  to\r\n\r\nsupport  their  family. Other  families,  because  of\r\n\r\ninsufficient  income will have to engage  in  certain\r\n\r\nfarming  activity  to supplement family  income.  But\r\n\r\nmany  of the younger generation of such families when\r\n\r\nthey  grow  up  do not intend to remain  farmers  but\r\n\r\nwould like to go outside to work or join the national\r\n\r\nservice. Whatever they earn outside is seldom brought\r\n\r\nback to support the family. However, their income  is\r\n\r\nalso  taken  as  a  factor in determining  whether  a\r\n\r\nfamily is a farming family or not. Thus, through such\r\n\r\ncircumstances, certain village\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfarmers  have  lost their status as farmers,  thereby\r\n\r\nlosing their right as farmers to such compensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another general situation is this. When\r\n\r\ncertain  farmers are given the notice of  acquisition\r\n\r\nof  land,  they are also advised to gradually  reduce\r\n\r\ntheir farming activity. Sometimes the census is taken\r\n\r\nmonths afterwards, while actual resettlement may take\r\n\r\nplace  one to two years later. During this transition\r\n\r\nperiod,  in order to minimise their loss, the farmers\r\n\r\nnaturally  reduce  their farming activity  gradually.\r\n\r\nOther  farmers, having failed in agricultural career,\r\n\r\nnow  because of lack of capital, have to  stop  their\r\n\r\nfarming activity for the time being. However, after a\r\n\r\nlong  wait the notice to quit has still not  arrived,\r\n\r\nand  so  because of family livelihood they are forced\r\n\r\nto  go  outside to work in order to make  ends  meet.\r\n\r\nSuch  unlucky farmers will certainly be  adjudged  by\r\n\r\nthe  Primary  Production Department as non-bona  fide\r\n\r\nfarmers, the compensation for whom will of course  be\r\n\r\nvery little\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our society should be a rational and a caring\r\n\r\nsociety. We should be sympathetic to the plight of  a\r\n\r\nsection  of  the population when they  have  to  make\r\n\r\nsacrifices  and are inconvenienced for the  sake of\r\n\r\nthe  nation  We  should help them  to  restore  their\r\n\r\ncapacity  to  earn and make a living. High  officials\r\n\r\nsitting  in  air-conditioned  rooms  of  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department make decisions  affecting  the\r\n\r\nfarmers'   fate  mainly  on  the  report   of   their\r\n\r\nsubordinate officers This causes a slur to the  truth\r\n\r\nand clouds the issue. Therefore, to adjudge whether a\r\n\r\nfarmer  is  bona fide or not, the Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment should base its consideration on  detailed\r\n\r\ninvestigation of the actual circumstances.  Also  the\r\n\r\nviews  of  the MP of the particular constituency  and\r\n\r\nthe   Citizens'  Consultative  Committee  should   be\r\n\r\nobserved before any decision is made. Only then, will\r\n\r\nit  be in keeping with the fundamental spirit of  the\r\n\r\npolicy of the present Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  express  the  gratitude  of  the  Khe  Bong\r\n\r\nelectorate to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident  for his policy speech on the 8th  February\r\n\r\nthis year After reading the speech again and again, I\r\n\r\nstrongly feel that the policy outlined therein  is  a\r\n\r\n\"universally  acceptable\" policy that  provides  100%\r\n\r\nsafeguard and security for the livelihood of the  two\r\n\r\nmillion  people  of Singapore. In  this  context,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, when the Singapore electorate returned\r\n\r\nour  party  to  power, what they want is,  in  short,\r\n\r\nsecurity and safeguard for their livelihood. This  is\r\n\r\nthe only thing they expect of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the President has stated in his policy\r\n\r\nspeech, there are numerous important problems  facing\r\n\r\nour  country,  such as those concerning the  economy,\r\n\r\neducation, communications, finance, the judiciary and\r\n\r\nso  on  and  so  forth, but none more important  than\r\n\r\ninternal  security.  This  is  because  our   present\r\n\r\nsituation is at a very critical juncture, and  if  we\r\n\r\ndo  not  handle it properly, this ship of  ours  will\r\n\r\ncapsize immediately with all of us swallowed  by  the\r\n\r\nhuge  waves  when it will be too late to  talk  about\r\n\r\nanything, and all of us will not be here,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship I refer to is the present Government of\r\n\r\nthe  party-in-power; the huge waves are  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunists and their fellow travellers. They are  our\r\n\r\narchenemies.  They jeopardize the peace and  security\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  and attempt to seize  power  by  armed\r\n\r\nforce.  They are the public enemies of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore -elements who must not be allowed to  exist\r\n\r\nfor internal security's sake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the party-in-power, are not unaware of this\r\n\r\ninternal danger. For this reason, we have been paying\r\n\r\nparticular  attention  to the  question  of  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity  However,  to be honest about  ourselves.  I\r\n\r\nthink  what  we  have  done  is  inadequate  and  not\r\n\r\nthorough enough either.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communists are like the all-permeating mercury.\r\n\r\nFor instance, now only we have found that G. Raman, a\r\n\r\nlawyer, is an out-and-out communist; now only  do  we\r\n\r\nknow  that he has colluded with European and  Malayan\r\n\r\ncommunists in their attempt to overthrow the  elected\r\n\r\nGovernment of Singapore. He became a communist long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlong  ago  when he was studying at the University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. At that time he harped on the same  string\r\n\r\nas the Malayan communists, but why did he not come to\r\n\r\nthe  notice of our security authorities then? Why has\r\n\r\nour institution of higher learning cultivated such  a\r\n\r\nhigh  level communist intellectual? I wonder if there\r\n\r\nis anything wrong with our education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have friends who teach in the secondary\r\n\r\nschools, They told me that today, there are communist\r\n\r\nelements  even  in the government secondary  schools.\r\n\r\nSuch   a  phenomenon  did  not  exist  in  the  past.\r\n\r\nFormerly,  communist elements were  found  mostly  in\r\n\r\nprivate  secondary schools. They invariably  did  not\r\n\r\nstudy well. However, the communist students today are\r\n\r\ngood  in  their  studies. They sport  long  hair  and\r\n\r\npretend to be hippies. They are, in fact, members  of\r\n\r\nthe  so-called  branch committees of the  underground\r\n\r\nMalayan communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend told me two true stories. One happened in\r\n\r\nShanghai  in  1949, when the Nationalist Party,  that\r\n\r\nis,  the  Kuo  Mm  Tang, was about to  withdraw  from\r\n\r\nShanghai.  Lo  Lung Chi, an important member  of  the\r\n\r\nDemocratic League, was arrested by the KMT agent  for\r\n\r\nsympathising with the communists. However, as soon as\r\n\r\nShanghai was liberated, the agent who interrogated Lo\r\n\r\nimmediately invited him out of the prison. Lo was  so\r\n\r\nfrightened  that his face turned pale.  But  the  man\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Comrade Lo, you have been invited  to  go  to\r\n\r\nPeking.\"  Only  then did the agent disclose  that  he\r\n\r\nwas,  in fact, a communist underground agent. Do  you\r\n\r\nthink  we  also have such dangerous elements  in  our\r\n\r\nsecurity set-ups?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second story tells about the pre-liberation\r\n\r\nSaigon  where the Income Tax Department  was  already\r\n\r\ninfiltrated  by a Vietcong agent. At that  time,  the\r\n\r\nNguyen  Van Thieu Government did not know about  him.\r\n\r\nThis  Vietcong agent, who managed to infiltrate  into\r\n\r\nthe  government department, made use of his  official\r\n\r\nposition  to make secret attacks on the rightists  so\r\n\r\nas to weaken the anti-communist force of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSaigon  Government. As soon as Saigon was  liberated,\r\n\r\nexcept  for  those  who escaped, those  who  remained\r\n\r\nbehind  were  arrested  one  by  one  on  information\r\n\r\nsupplied by this Vietcong agent. Do you think we have\r\n\r\nany  Communist  infiltrators in our  tax  department,\r\n\r\npostal  service  or  the churches,  particularly  the\r\n\r\nchoirs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such is the important work of internal security on\r\n\r\nthe  lives and properties of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  must, therefore, make sure that the work is  done\r\n\r\nwell and thoroughly and that there is no loophole  in\r\n\r\nit.  Any loophole will mean that all previous efforts\r\n\r\nwill  have  been wasted. I do not mean to praise  the\r\n\r\ncommunists.  Any communist regime, be it  the  Soviet\r\n\r\nUnion or China, will carry out a purge every now  and\r\n\r\nthen.   They   eliminate  undesirable  elements   and\r\n\r\nstrengthen their regime through purges. If we want to\r\n\r\nseek  permanent security and safeguard for the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, if we wish to ensure that  the  people\r\n\r\nenjoy  their rights and happiness, to seek peace  and\r\n\r\nprogress for society and stability and prosperity for\r\n\r\nthe  country,  it  is necessary,  I  think,  for  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Home  Affairs  to  introduce  measures\r\n\r\nwhereby  information  can be  gathered  from  various\r\n\r\nGovernment departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore have once again elected us\r\n\r\nto form the government. As has been said by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,   and  I  quote,  \"The  people  are   anti-communist;\r\n\r\nthey do not want communists.\" One  danger\r\n\r\nfacing   Singapore   today  is   internal   communist\r\n\r\nsubversion against the government. It is in  response\r\n\r\nto  the request of the electorate that such a measure\r\n\r\nis introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the \"Spring and Autumn\" period in China\r\n\r\n(period  of  feudal  warlords), there  was  a  great\r\n\r\nstatesman  by the name of Kuan Chung who  once  said,\r\n\r\n\"Expelling foreign invasion should be preceded by the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of internal security.\" In  other  words,\r\n\r\nthere   must  be  internal  security  before  foreign\r\n\r\ninvasion can be checked. Without security what  other\r\n\r\nthings can we talk about, even saving daylight?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to support the Motion moved\r\n\r\nby the Member for Ulu Pandan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto  support the Motion of Thanks moved by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Ulu Pandan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's speech clearly outlines the\r\n\r\nprospects  and  problems  facing  us  today  and  the\r\n\r\nframework  of  the general policies and measures  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  intends  to pursue during  the  five-year\r\n\r\nterm  of  the Fourth Parliament which has  the  solid\r\n\r\nsupport  of the people of Singapore. All of  us  know\r\n\r\nthat   \"soft-options\"  must  go  overboard  and  that\r\n\r\nrealism  must  be the cornerstone of the Government's\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, three areas on which I would\r\n\r\nlike  to comment. Firstly, I would like to point  out\r\n\r\nthat the last 1 2 years have not been easy ones. In 1\r\n\r\n965  the  economic and labour climate  was  extremely\r\n\r\ndistressing. But Labour realised that the  only  road\r\n\r\nto  economic  salvation and national  prosperity  was\r\n\r\njoint  endeavour  by  the  three  major  partners   -\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Labour and Management - for  the  common\r\n\r\ninterest of the country; and that none could progress\r\n\r\nunless  everyone progressed. By and large, this  has\r\n\r\ncome  to pass, thanks to the Government's initiatives\r\n\r\nand Labour's positive response.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last few years were decidedly difficult years,\r\n\r\nparticularly  on  the  economic  front,  with  global\r\n\r\ninflation  accompanied by a slowdown of the  economy.\r\n\r\nThe labour movement and the workers responded well to\r\n\r\nthe  call of the country and contributed, in no small\r\n\r\nmeasure,  to cushion the deleterious effects  of  the\r\n\r\ntimes, unlike trade unions elsewhere, particularly  a\r\n\r\nfew  of  those in the developed countries where  they\r\n\r\nignored  national  interests and pursued  destructive\r\n\r\npolicies which generated economic disarray and  heavy\r\n\r\nunemployment. Our realism averted such a situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I, at this stage, be\r\n\r\npermitted, to quote Dr Goh Keng Swee, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister and Minister of defence,  who\r\n\r\nstates  in  his  article  \"A Socialist  Economy  that\r\n\r\nWorks\"  published in the book Socialism  that  Works:\r\n\r\nThe Singapore Way, at page 837 thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Collectively, workers formed the most important\r\n\r\norganised social group. This must be so in  any  free\r\n\r\nsociety  in which every citizen enjoys voting rights.\r\n\r\nOrganised  labour  is  important  simply  because  it\r\n\r\nrepresents  the  majority  of  the  electorate.   The\r\n\r\nresponse  of  organised labour to the challenges  and\r\n\r\nopportunities in the newly independent  Republic  are\r\n\r\ndescribed in detail elsewhere ... Here it suffices to\r\n\r\nsay that the labour movement took an enlightened long-term\r\n\r\nview of their group interests. They were willing\r\n\r\nto give the growth policy a chance to succeed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so we will, Mr Speaker, Sir. What I would like to\r\n\r\nstress  here  is that the contributions of  organised\r\n\r\nlabour, in the past, and in the coming years must not\r\n\r\nbe forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area I would like to comment upon, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  is  the Addendum to the  Presidential\r\n\r\nAddress  on the Ministry of Labour, In the matter  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  relations. I am glad  to  note  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  will  take  steps to  further  improve  its\r\n\r\nindustrial   relations  services   and   set   up   a\r\n\r\ndepartmental  service  to  build  up   a   corps   of\r\n\r\nexperienced labour and industrial relations officers.\r\n\r\nPrevention and settlement of industrial disputes  are\r\n\r\nnot  just  matters of law and forms.  It  requires  a\r\n\r\ndeeper   insight  of  the  philosophy  of  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations,  of winning the confidence of the  parties\r\n\r\ninvolved  and  producing eventually,  acceptable  and\r\n\r\nreasonable  settlements. Not only experience  but  an\r\n\r\nattitude  of  equanimity must be developed.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  cite an example to underscore what  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid. The recent NWC recommendations gave rise  to  a\r\n\r\nwelter  of  interpretations,  counter-interpretations\r\n\r\nand  misinterpretations and confusion ran galore,  so\r\n\r\nmuch  so that a call had to be made to reconvene  the\r\n\r\nNational  Wages  Council. It  is  true,  Sir,  Labour\r\n\r\nrepresentatives    were    signatories     to     the\r\n\r\nrecommendations which, in any case, could only  spell\r\n\r\nout   broad   guidelines.  But  the  rub   was   that\r\n\r\nimplementing  them  became  a  problem  because   the\r\n\r\npresent  officials, most of whom had, as I would  put\r\n\r\nit, no previous\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"labour  background\", could not differentiate between\r\n\r\nthe  wood  and the tree, or more precisely  were  and\r\n\r\nstill  are  unable to reconcile practice with  policy\r\n\r\nand  to  translate  policy into practice  justly  and\r\n\r\nequitably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area I would like to touch on is\r\n\r\nproductivity.  There  are  disparate  views  on  what\r\n\r\nproductivity is, how productivity measurements are to\r\n\r\nbe  worked  out and who should carry the productivity\r\n\r\n\"baby\".  A  clear indication of lopsided concepts  is\r\n\r\nthe editorial in The Manufacturer, of January 1977, a\r\n\r\npublication    of    the   Singapore   Manufacturer's\r\n\r\nAssociation.    This   editorial   illustrates    the\r\n\r\ninadequate   perception   of   Singapore's   economic\r\n\r\nintricacies  and  the  complexities  surrounding  the\r\n\r\nproductivity   issue.  The  basic  premise   of   the\r\n\r\neditorial  is  that  \"there appears  to  be  a  basic\r\n\r\nassumption   that   manufacturing   productivity   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  already reached optimum  levels\".  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  as  far  as  the  trade  unions   are\r\n\r\nconcerned, no such assumption has ever been  made  by\r\n\r\nthem,  On  the  contrary, Labour leaders consistently\r\n\r\nemphasise the need to help our industries reach  full\r\n\r\nproduction capacity. They know that it is  only  when\r\n\r\nindustries  are strong the workers will benefit.  The\r\n\r\nSMA  editorial was, therefore, an assumption  of  the\r\n\r\nexistence of another assumption which in fact was not\r\n\r\nthere at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the National Productivity Board\r\n\r\nshould  not just continue, as in the past, to promote\r\n\r\nthe   concept  of  productivity.  The  Board   should\r\n\r\nconcentrate   more   on  working   out   productivity\r\n\r\nmeasurement  techniques  for  industries  and   show,\r\n\r\nplainly  to those faltering minds in our midst,  that\r\n\r\ntangible results are achievable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.51 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to associate\r\n\r\nmyself with my colleagues in supporting the Motion of\r\n\r\nThanks  to the President for his speech delivered  at\r\n\r\nthe  opening  of  the  First Session  of  the  Fourth\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the policy speech, I wish to dwell on the\r\n\r\nsubject of redevelopment projects carried out by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment which affect many kampongs. I am convinced\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government's intention is  extremely  good\r\n\r\nbecause it affords an opportunity to a great majority\r\n\r\nof people in Singapore to own their own homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is a minority group of people in\r\n\r\nSingapore who are deprived of this opportunity on the\r\n\r\nground  that they hold Singapore blue identity cards.\r\n\r\nAlthough they claim birth in Singapore, as stated  on\r\n\r\ntheir  identity cards, however, they  are  unable  to\r\n\r\nproduce documentary evidence as they have lost  their\r\n\r\nbirth  certificates  and neither  can  they  remember\r\n\r\ntheir  birth  dates. This is one of the  reasons  why\r\n\r\nthey have failed to obtain extracts from the Registry\r\n\r\nof  Births. Subsequently, they were advised to  apply\r\n\r\nfor  citizenship. Unfortunately, amongst  them  there\r\n\r\nare  people who have waited three to four  years  for\r\n\r\napproval  and  yet their applications have  not  been\r\n\r\napproved,  even  until the time when  their  dwelling\r\n\r\nhouses   are  affected  by  Government  redevelopment\r\n\r\nprojects. They have inherited these houses from their\r\n\r\nparents,  and  they have been in physical  occupation\r\n\r\nfrom  time immemorial. Upon acquisition by Government\r\n\r\nfor   redevelopment   they  were   paid   ex   gratia\r\n\r\ncompensation   only  but  they   were   not   offered\r\n\r\nalternative accommodation. May I ask: where are these\r\n\r\nfamilies going to stay? Can we just sit tight and see\r\n\r\nthese  people  made  homeless?  They  were  born   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and they have no other country  to  go  to\r\n\r\nwhere  they can take up permanent residence. Can  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   not   give  special   consideration   to\r\n\r\nclearance  families that I have cited?  Although  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  families is small, we  must  nevertheless\r\n\r\nshow  justice to these people whose living conditions\r\n\r\nhave  been  adversely  affected  in  consequence   of\r\n\r\nGovernment policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion of Thanks moved by the\r\n\r\nMember for Ulu Pandan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.54 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nin support of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Motion moved by the hon.

The PAP's overwhelming victory in all  the\r\n\r\n69  constituencies has proved beyond  any  doubt  the\r\n\r\nsophistication and growing political awareness of our\r\n\r\npeople.   The   fantasy-peddling   tactics   of   the\r\n\r\nopposition  parties  just did not  work.  Present-day\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are not easily beguiled  by  the  false\r\n\r\npretences   and  empty  promises  of  the  opposition\r\n\r\nparties.

This, the  people\r\n\r\nknow, can be found only in the PAP Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the General Elections are over, the\r\n\r\nopposition  parties have gone into  hibernation  once\r\n\r\nagain - only to be awakened, perhaps, in 1981 by  the\r\n\r\nfanfare  of the next General Elections. No one  hears\r\n\r\nfrom   the  rather  pitiful  Harbans  Singh  anymore!\r\n\r\nPerhaps his inglorious defeat in Tanjong Pagar by  Mr\r\n\r\nLee  Kuan Yew has rendered him speechless - a  defeat\r\n\r\nwhich  was  not unexpected even to his own  daughter.\r\n\r\nWhere  is J.B. Jeyaretnam now! Silenced too,  perhaps\r\n\r\nby:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n `Rat-catcher Fong Sip Chee\r\n\r\n  Whose \"good catch\" on Dec 23\r\n\r\n  Led PAP to victory\r\n\r\n  In the fight at Kampong Chai Chee.'\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  it has been 22  years  since  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party was founded and 17 years  since\r\n\r\nthe   PAP  was  first  voted  into  office   as   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  A great deal has happened,  both  inside\r\n\r\nand outside Singapore, since then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is still too early in the year to talk\r\n\r\nof 1977. But certainly the world of 1976 was a vastly\r\n\r\ndifferent  place from what it was 22 years  ago.  The\r\n\r\nleaders in the PAP were right in believing that a non-Communist\r\n\r\ndemocratic socialist party could  win  the\r\n\r\nhearts and minds of the masses. History has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproved  them  right. The results  of  the  last  five\r\n\r\nGeneral  Elections  in  Singapore  since  1959   bear\r\n\r\ntestimony to this belief. They were equally right  in\r\n\r\ntheir  belief that there could be no long-term social\r\n\r\ncohesion in a multi-racial society except by building\r\n\r\na    national    identity   based   on   non-communal\r\n\r\nnationalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our independence in 1965, we have all strived\r\n\r\nto  ensure that Singapore survives and prospers.  Our\r\n\r\npast  12  years  and  indeed our  future  prospects\r\n\r\nconfirm that what makes a nation thrive is more  than\r\n\r\njust the total sum of natural resources. What makes a\r\n\r\npeople into a nation is a sense of common purpose and\r\n\r\nshared destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While much has been achieved by Singapore in the\r\n\r\nlast 12 years, much more still remains to be done. We\r\n\r\nmust  continue  to  strive  with  enormous  capacity,\r\n\r\npragmatism,  and energy to bring further improvements\r\n\r\ninto the quality of human life in the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent events in the region and in Singapore have\r\n\r\nindicated   that  the  Communists  were   insidiously\r\n\r\nworking   for  a  possible  take-over  of  Peninsular\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  Singapore. These  incidents  show  the\r\n\r\nextent   of   the  danger  we  face  from  subversive\r\n\r\nactivities of the Communists, We glimpsed the  spread\r\n\r\nof  their  network, here and abroad, the machinations\r\n\r\nof   their   strategies,  and  the  depth  of   their\r\n\r\npenetrations  into every sector and racial  group  of\r\n\r\nour society. This chilling evidence of their presence\r\n\r\nand activity must strengthen our resolve to fight the\r\n\r\nCommunist threat with every means in our power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists would resort to whatever means\r\n\r\navailable to further their ends. The change of regime\r\n\r\nin  Indo-China has undoubtedly inspired them further,\r\n\r\nAt  the  Non-Aligned Summit Conference in  Sri  Lanka\r\n\r\nlast year, Laos backed by Vietnam openly declared its\r\n\r\nsupport  for communist insurgency in Southeast  Asia.\r\n\r\nPrince  Souphanouvong, in his public attack on  ASEAN\r\n\r\nat    this   Conference,   reiterated   the   Laotian\r\n\r\ndetermination to work in solidarity with Vietnam  and\r\n\r\nCambodia \" .., to contribute to the struggles to make\r\n\r\nthe  countries  of Southeast Asia truly  independent,\r\n\r\npeaceful,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  non-aligned\"  - implying, therefore,  that  only\r\n\r\nthose  countries  in Southeast Asia  under  Communist\r\n\r\nrule  are \"truly\" independent or peaceful; the others\r\n\r\nare  not!  One  has  only  to  look  around,  at  the\r\n\r\nescalation  of Thailand's border problems  with  Laos\r\n\r\nand Cambodia and the recent intrusions by Khmer Rouge\r\n\r\ninto  Thailand in which 30 Thai civilians,  including\r\n\r\nwomen and children, were massacred by the Cambodians,\r\n\r\nto  see  Souphanouvong's words dissolve in a pool  of\r\n\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, because of our political stability,\r\n\r\nsocial   development,  and  economic  progress,   the\r\n\r\nCommunists  have  found it exceedingly  difficult  to\r\n\r\nmanoeuvre. But it would be naive to believe that  the\r\n\r\nCommunists would not resort to other means  in  their\r\n\r\nefforts to grab power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> may still recall that some time in\r\n\r\n1976,  the  Government exposed a  Communist  plot  to\r\n\r\ninfiltrate and exploit top intellectuals of the upper-middle\r\n\r\nechelon. And indeed as the President  pointed\r\n\r\nout, the Communists would continue to manipulate  our\r\n\r\nmisguided  student leaders, like Tan  Wah  Plow,  and\r\n\r\nequally  misguided professionals like \"Euro-red  link\r\n\r\nman\"  G.  Raman  who,  as  hon.  Members  know,   was\r\n\r\nresponsible  for supplying distorted  information  on\r\n\r\nthe  political and social conditions in Singapore  to\r\n\r\njustify  the  expulsion of the People's Action  Party\r\n\r\nfrom the Socialist International.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here I would like to correct, if I may, the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  for  Khe  Bong G.  Raman  received  his\r\n\r\ncommunist indoctrination when he was reading  law  in\r\n\r\none  of  the  Inns in London. There  he  met  Malcolm\r\n\r\nCaldwell, Amir Dastan and Utrecht. He did not receive\r\n\r\nhis  university  education  from  the  University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another attempt which came to light last year,\r\n\r\nthe  Communists  embarked on  a  scheme  designed  to\r\n\r\ncreate  discontentment and despair among  the  Malays\r\n\r\nand  to  influence  them  towards  Communism  as   an\r\n\r\nacceptable   solution   to  the   so-called   \"Malay\"\r\n\r\nproblems. To achieve this, the Communists\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadopted  a  strategy which included the softening  of\r\n\r\nthe   Malay  ground  for  Communist  ideas  and   the\r\n\r\ndiminishing of their faith in Islam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to protect the Singapore that we\r\n\r\nhave  built  for  ourselves, our  children, and  our\r\n\r\nchildren's  children founded on justice and  equality\r\n\r\nfor all irrespective of race and religion, we must by\r\n\r\nresolute  action,  safeguard  the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\nnation,  people, and society. Let us, as  all  loyal\r\n\r\nSingaporeans should do, rally behind and  extend  our\r\n\r\nfull cooperation to the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng San (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion\r\n\r\nthanking  the  President for his speech delivered  on\r\n\r\n8th February, 1977.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Presidential address points out that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  holds firm the simple truth that  to  get\r\n\r\nfrom  each his best, rewards and recognition must  go\r\n\r\nto  those who consistently excel in high performance.\r\n\r\nThis   will  encourage  the  workers  to  work   more\r\n\r\ndiligently  and to lead better lives.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  it will also stimulate our economic growth  so\r\n\r\nthat   our  products  can  be  more  competitive   on\r\n\r\ninternational  market. The Government  will  allocate\r\n\r\nmore funds for the setting up of training centres  to\r\n\r\ntrain  our workers in higher skills so as to  prepare\r\n\r\nthem  for precision work. This will directly  improve\r\n\r\nthe  skills and standard of our workers so  that  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  our  products will be  better  and  more\r\n\r\nsophisticated. In the end, our products will be  more\r\n\r\ncompetitive in the international market. The training\r\n\r\nof our workers should ensure that it will achieve the\r\n\r\nobjects  envisaged.  That  is,  the  workers   should\r\n\r\nacquire  higher skill to enable them to do  precision\r\n\r\nwork.  On  the  other  hand we should  look  out  for\r\n\r\nemployers  who  abuse the name  of  training  by  not\r\n\r\nactually giving adequate training to the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is stated in the Presidential address that the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`will continue to work with unions and employers to\r\n\r\ncontribute  to economic growth through the  promotion\r\n\r\nof  a  stable  and peaceful industrial  climate, the\r\n\r\nfostering of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na   disciplined  and  productive  workforce  and  the\r\n\r\nsafeguarding of the welfare, safety and health of our\r\n\r\nworkers.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  is  good news to our workers as it will  enable\r\n\r\nour  workers to have a better and more stable  living\r\n\r\nand  to  enjoy their family life. This will  lead  to\r\n\r\nindustrial   peace  thus  encouraging  our   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and advancing us towards the  target  of\r\n\r\ntripartism.  With  tripartite  co-operation  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, Employer and Labour, we shall be able  to\r\n\r\nstruggle  for  our  economic  development  so  as  to\r\n\r\nrealise   our  objectives  of  nation  building.   In\r\n\r\naddition  to giving protection and safeguard  to  the\r\n\r\nwell-being,  security and health of  our  workers.  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  if the facilities and measures  could  be\r\n\r\nextended  to cover also the fields of recreation  and\r\n\r\nsports, then our workers will be able to lead  better\r\n\r\nlives and be more contented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Productivity Board will strengthen its work to\r\n\r\npromote   the  productivity  of  workers, and   will\r\n\r\nformulate  programmes  for such  purpose.  Generally,\r\n\r\nemployers always regard higher productivity as a duty\r\n\r\non  the  part of the workers. They expect workers  to\r\n\r\nwork  harder and still harder, but neglect to improve\r\n\r\nthe  method of work and the tools of production.  The\r\n\r\nProductivity Board should therefore get the employers\r\n\r\nto   improve  the  method  of  work  and   tools   of\r\n\r\nproduction. The Board should also formulate incentive\r\n\r\nschemes for the workers to raise their productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years bus transport has improved\r\n\r\nsignificantly. We must thank the Government  for  its\r\n\r\neffort.  It is also the result of sincere cooperation\r\n\r\nbetween capital and labour. In the past few years the\r\n\r\nSingapore Industrial Labour Organisation has improved\r\n\r\nthe  working  conditions of bus workers.  As  we  all\r\n\r\nknow,  the bus workers have to get up very early  for\r\n\r\nthe  morning shift duties. Usually they will have  to\r\n\r\nget  up at 4.00 or 5.00 am. They will have to retire,\r\n\r\nif  on night shift, in the small hours of the day  at\r\n\r\none   or  two  o'clock.  Their  duty  is  to  provide\r\n\r\ncommuters  with  safe and comfortable service.  Until\r\n\r\nthe   mass  rapid  transit  system  is  set  up,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Bus Service Ltd, will continue to  be  the\r\n\r\nmainstay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof our public transport system. In order to raise the\r\n\r\nstandard  of service, the Government should therefore\r\n\r\nconsider  setting  up canteens  and  toilets  at  bus\r\n\r\nterminals for the convenience of bus workers. Also to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  industrial workers and to encourage  more\r\n\r\nblue  collar workers, the Government should  consider\r\n\r\nasking   the  Company  to  provide  more   buses   in\r\n\r\nindustrial   areas   during  peak   hours   for   the\r\n\r\nconvenience  of  the workers to travel  to  and  from\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to encourage more women to join the labour\r\n\r\nforce, all  private organisations and  trade  unions\r\n\r\nshould not shirk the responsibility of building their\r\n\r\nown  creches for the care of children to help working\r\n\r\nmothers. The NTUC has been negotiating to take over a\r\n\r\ncreche  in  Toa  Payoh, while SILO has already  taken\r\n\r\nover a creche at Kallang Bahru for this purpose.  The\r\n\r\nother  organisations, whether private, industrial  or\r\n\r\nemployers,  should  also  contribute  to  our  social\r\n\r\nwelfare   undertakings.  Therefore,  the   Government\r\n\r\nshould   encourage  these  organisations  to  respond\r\n\r\nactively  in  supporting, taking over or establishing\r\n\r\ncreches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I would like to join my colleagues  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  to  thank the President for  his  speech\r\n\r\ndelivered at the opening of the First Session of  the\r\n\r\nTuesday, 8th February, 1977\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the People's Action Party again won all the 69\r\n\r\nseats  in the recent General Elections held  on  23rd\r\n\r\nDecember. 1976.

They\r\n\r\nknow  that the PAP's leadership is honest, dedicated,\r\n\r\nefficient, incorruptible, and has the experience  and\r\n\r\ncapacity   to   maintain   political   and   economic\r\n\r\nstability.

The\r\n\r\nNTUC,  the Union leaders and the workers fully  agree\r\n\r\nthat  future  wage increases have to be  orderly  and\r\n\r\nrelated  to higher productivity and economic  growth.\r\n\r\nAlso  fringe  benefits  which  are  bizarre  or   not\r\n\r\nconducive  to  economic  progress  will  have  to  be\r\n\r\ndiscontinued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since 1968 the workers of Singapore have been\r\n\r\nvery  reasonable in their wage demand and  they  only\r\n\r\nimprove   some   of  the  fringe  benefits   whenever\r\n\r\nnecessary.  The workers in Singapore have been  under\r\n\r\nthe  good  leadership  of Mr.  CV.  Devan  Nair,  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General  of  NTUC,  and  through  his  wise\r\n\r\nguidance, the workers fully appreciate the importance\r\n\r\nof   national  interest  rather  than  individual  or\r\n\r\nsectional interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the negotiations for new collective\r\n\r\nagreements  have been negotiated with the  spirit  of\r\n\r\n\"give-and-take\"  with  mutual understanding  and  co-operation.\r\n\r\nIndustrial relations between employers and\r\n\r\nlabour  have  been  good. The number  of  strikes  in\r\n\r\nSingapore for several years has been a few only.  The\r\n\r\nworkers   in   Singapore  have  gone   through   many\r\n\r\nsacrifices,  such  as  wage restraint,  reduction  of\r\n\r\nfringe  benefits,  limitation  of  bonus  payment  or\r\n\r\nAnnual   Wage  Supplement,  etc.  However,   whenever\r\n\r\nemployers   manage  to  expand  their  business   and\r\n\r\nincrease production with better profits, they  should\r\n\r\nnot   forget  to  give  better  bonus  or  reasonable\r\n\r\nincentive payment to the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on December 30th, Mr Ong Pang Boon, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour, said that the next  session  of\r\n\r\nthe  National  Wages Council would probably  have  to\r\n\r\nconsider and deliberate that offsetting, now confined\r\n\r\nto  salary  increases,  should  cover  all  forms  of\r\n\r\nremuneration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the workers are quite concerned with the NWC's\r\n\r\nintention   to   offset  to  cover   all   forms   of\r\n\r\nremuneration.  In other words, the  workers  have  to\r\n\r\nmake   a   sacrifice   again.  Workers   are   asking\r\n\r\nthemselves:  how  many times more have  they  got  to\r\n\r\nsacrifice.  There  has to be a limit  in  asking  the\r\n\r\nworkers to sacrifice. In fact, the wages they get are\r\n\r\njust  enough to feed their families. Married  workers\r\n\r\nwho  earn  less than $400 a month find difficulty  in\r\n\r\nmaking  both ends meet, and there is hardly  anything\r\n\r\nleft  for them to save. I hope the NWC will take note\r\n\r\nof  this important point when they come to the  final\r\n\r\ndecision on offsetting which may include all forms of\r\n\r\nremuneration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, Sir, instead of always looking to the\r\n\r\ndirection  of the workers who are in the  middle  and\r\n\r\nlower  income  brackets, the Government  should  also\r\n\r\nrequest the higher income bracket of workers who  are\r\n\r\nin  the Managerial, and Executive levels to make some\r\n\r\nsacrifice and follow the good examples of the workers\r\n\r\nwho earn much less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is necessary that an amendment be\r\n\r\nmade  to  the  Employment (Amendment) Act,  1975,  in\r\n\r\nrespect of the payment of the annual wage supplement.\r\n\r\nThe  employers are paying the annual wage  supplement\r\n\r\nallowable  by  law, but they have  to  apply  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance to pay an amount in  excess  of\r\n\r\nthat  allowed by law to make up the total  amount  of\r\n\r\nannual  wage  supplement.  In  other  words,  if  the\r\n\r\nemployers refuse to apply to the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nto  approve the payment of the annual wage supplement\r\n\r\nin  excess  of  what is allowed by the law,  although\r\n\r\nthey  have  negotiated with the  unions  on  the  new\r\n\r\nquantum  of  the annual wage supplement,  the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry will be powerless to compel them to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to prevent some employers from\r\n\r\nabusing the law, and some have already done so, may I\r\n\r\nsuggest   that  the  payment  of  the   annual   wage\r\n\r\nsupplement  should  be based on  the  quantum  agreed\r\n\r\nbetween the employers and the unions during the  year\r\n\r\n1976, subject to a maximum amount equivalent to three\r\n\r\nmonths'  wages of the employees. This will also  save\r\n\r\nthe trouble and inconvenience to the Minister for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinance to approve so many cases of this nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in the event an employer finds that the\r\n\r\ntrading  results are lacking in a significant degree,\r\n\r\nhe  may  invite the union to negotiate  for  a  lower\r\n\r\nquantum  of the annual wage supplement to be paid  to\r\n\r\nthe  employees.  May I suggest that an  amendment  be\r\n\r\nmade  so that if the trading results of the employers\r\n\r\nare  good and show substantial profit, the union  has\r\n\r\nthe right to invite the employers to pay for a higher\r\n\r\nquantum of the annual wage supplement. This should be\r\n\r\ndone in fairness to the workers. The employers should\r\n\r\nnot  be  given the privilege to enjoy two  pieces  of\r\n\r\ncake,  while  the workers have no choice  of  picking\r\n\r\nexcept  to  keep on sacrificing. I believe  sacrifice\r\n\r\nfor the national interest should be a two-way traffic\r\n\r\nbetween  the employers and the workers, and not  just\r\n\r\non the workers all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now refer to the Addendum on the Ministry of\r\n\r\nNational Development. I am glad that it will plan and\r\n\r\nwork towards better housing with improved social  and\r\n\r\nrecreational  facilities, better  infrastructure  and\r\n\r\npublic amenities in pleasant and gracious environment\r\n\r\nin the next five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy that under the fourth Five-Year Building\r\n\r\nProgramme another 150,000 units will be completed  by\r\n\r\n1980.  An additional 10,000 flats will be built  in\r\n\r\nthe Central Area to help reverse the population drift\r\n\r\nto  the  new towns. Also applicants will not have  to\r\n\r\nwait  longer than 1 to 1 1/2 years to buy or  rent  HDB\r\n\r\nflats.  I  am  sure applicants of HDB flats  will  be\r\n\r\nhappy  to know that they have to wait for 1  to  1 1/2\r\n\r\nyears instead of two to three years as at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Addendum on the Prime Minister's Office\r\n\r\ntruly  stated that the people of Singapore  have  the\r\n\r\nwill to succeed and they support the Government in  a\r\n\r\nnational  effort to solve the apparently  unsolvable.\r\n\r\nIn  the  last General Elections in Singapore on  23rd\r\n\r\nDecember,  1976,  the  workers  of  Singapore   fully\r\n\r\nsupported the PAP Government. The workers have agreed\r\n\r\nto   subordinate  individual  interest  to   national\r\n\r\ninterest and to ensure that Singapore will not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngo down. The present industrial peace with only a few\r\n\r\nstrikes  a  year  and the tripartite  cooperation  of\r\n\r\nlabour,  management  and government  will  definitely\r\n\r\nhelp  Singapore  to  solve various  problems  and  to\r\n\r\nsucceed in everything we do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the Addendum on the Ministry of\r\n\r\nFinance,  I fully agree that we should make Singapore\r\n\r\ngrow  fast again, more manufacturing as well  and  no\r\n\r\nextravagance  in public sector expenditure.  However,\r\n\r\nit  is necessary to spend more money in training  the\r\n\r\nyoung  workers to acquire higher skills for delicate,\r\n\r\nprecision  work. Also, I hope all the ASEAN countries\r\n\r\nwill  concentrate  on rapid economic  growth  through\r\n\r\nmutual  economic  cooperation to  implement  all  the\r\n\r\nagreed major industrial projects as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThese industrial projects for all the ASEAN countries\r\n\r\nwill  give  more jobs to the people and better  their\r\n\r\nstandard  of  living  and will  bring  political  and\r\n\r\neconomic  stability in the ASEAN  region  which  will\r\n\r\nconvince  the ASEAN people that the ASEAN  democratic\r\n\r\nway  of  life  is  just  as  good  as  the  communist\r\n\r\ncountries  or  even  better than  theirs.  We  always\r\n\r\nbelieve  and  treasure the importance of  freedom  of\r\n\r\nspeech; freedom to learn and use whatever language we\r\n\r\nlike;   freedom   to   enjoy  the  various   cultural\r\n\r\nactivities of several countries; freedom of  worship;\r\n\r\nand the freedom to be a multi-millionaire if you have\r\n\r\nthe  capacity  to do so. I can assure the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  that  those  who  have  been  to   various\r\n\r\ncountries in Asia, Europe and America will  say  that\r\n\r\nlife  in  Singapore  is very good  and  just  like  a\r\n\r\nparadise. This is my personal opinion after  visiting\r\n\r\nthese countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I comment on the Addendum on the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Defence.  There is no doubt that  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  fully endorse the policy of the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment to carry on national service for our young\r\n\r\npeople.  To  preserve our independence,  we  must  be\r\n\r\nprepared to defend our own country by our own people.\r\n\r\nThe  lesson the people of Singapore should understand\r\n\r\nis  that even America could not defend South Vietnam.\r\n\r\nIf the people of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  well  trained  to  defend  their  own\r\n\r\ncountry  and  have the courage and will to  fight  to\r\n\r\nwin,  should there be any foreign aggression, we will\r\n\r\ndefinitely win.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fall of South Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos\r\n\r\nto   the   communists,  all  ASEAN   countries   must\r\n\r\nstrengthen   their   own  defence   and   have   full\r\n\r\ncooperation. I fully support the ASEAN philosophy  to\r\n\r\nbe  friends to all countries in the world,  including\r\n\r\nthe  communist  countries and not to  let  any  great\r\n\r\npower  make use of ASEAN countries as a pawn and,  if\r\n\r\npossible, to have no enemies at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully agree with the views expressed in the\r\n\r\nAddendum  on the Ministry of Communications  on  road\r\n\r\ntransport. I travel by bus daily and I wish to record\r\n\r\nmy appreciation and satisfaction of the Singapore Bus\r\n\r\nService  Ltd, for their improved service  during  the\r\n\r\nlast  two years. Of course, there is room for further\r\n\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest that more female bus drivers be\r\n\r\ntrained and put into the service, I observe that  the\r\n\r\nmale  bus  drivers  are  more impatient  than  female\r\n\r\ndrivers.  Also,  it is a fact that conductresses  are\r\n\r\ndoing  just  as good as the conductors. However,  all\r\n\r\nthe  employees of the Singapore Bus Service are doing\r\n\r\ntheir best and my thanks and appreciation go to  most\r\n\r\nof the bus workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the Addendum on the Ministry of\r\n\r\nSocial Affairs, I am glad that priority will be given\r\n\r\nto  the  welfare  of  the young, the  aged  and  the\r\n\r\nstrengthening  of the family unit. I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nurge  the Government to be more generous and to allot\r\n\r\nmore  money  in  the  next Budget  to  this  Ministry\r\n\r\nalthough it is not a money-making one, like  the  PUB\r\n\r\nor  the  Income  Tax Department. Most  of  the  young\r\n\r\npeople   become  delinquents  as  a  result  of   the\r\n\r\nnegligence  of their parents who simply do  not  care\r\n\r\nfor  them, The rich father is interested in  business\r\n\r\nand  making  more money whereby he has  to  entertain\r\n\r\nbusiness  friends in night clubs, cabarets or  having\r\n\r\nthe maximum enjoyment. The rich mother plays mahjong,\r\n\r\ngambles and goes shopping. The poor father and mother\r\n\r\nwho earn small\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwages  and who have no means of enjoying any kind  of\r\n\r\nentertainment, however, would maintain their capacity\r\n\r\nin  human production by bringing in a new baby  every\r\n\r\nyear. For such irresponsible parents, they bring more\r\n\r\nsuffering  and  misery  to themselves  and  to  their\r\n\r\nchildren.  Rich  and  poor parents,  therefore,  must\r\n\r\nspare  some time to guide their children to  be  good\r\n\r\nand  useful  citizens, and also  to  practise  family\r\n\r\nplanning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish I could have more time to\r\n\r\nspeak  on  the  other  Addenda  to  the  Presidential\r\n\r\nAddress,  but  in fairness to my colleagues  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse, they should be given an opportunity to express\r\n\r\ntheir views and opinions. I would like to end here by\r\n\r\nsaying  that  the  people  of  Singapore  are   fully\r\n\r\nsatisfied with the programmes and policies of the PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment  which are set out in the Addenda  to  the\r\n\r\nPresidential. Address to Parliament on  Tuesday,  8th\r\n\r\nFebruary,  1977.  The  Addenda  spell  out  what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  proposes to do in the fields  of  finance\r\n\r\nand economics, social and medical services, education\r\n\r\nand  defence. I am sure we will be able to fulfil all\r\n\r\nthe  programmes and policies by 1981 or earlier which\r\n\r\nmeans that in the next General Elections in 1981, the\r\n\r\nso-called  opposition parties will have no chance  to\r\n\r\nwin   a  seat  in  Parliament.  They  can  come  into\r\n\r\nParliament  provided  they  can  do  what   the   PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment  has been doing or if they can  do  better\r\n\r\nthan us. I believe it is not possible for them to  do\r\n\r\nso  and the people of Singapore have no confidence in\r\n\r\nthem.  So  there  will be no MP from  the  opposition\r\n\r\nparties again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, I suspend the Sitting now and\r\n\r\nwill take the Chair again at 5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at 4.28 p.m.</i></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>until 5.00 p.m.</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.00 p.m.</i></div>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I\r\n\r\nsit and listen to my learned\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncolleagues here these two days, I could not but  feel\r\n\r\nand see the difference in the Backbenches as compared\r\n\r\nto  my  last two terms as a Backbencher.  We  have  a\r\n\r\nnumber of new faces and we also have an unprecedented\r\n\r\nnumber  of  Ph.Ds.  I  counted and  found  there  are\r\n\r\naltogether seven of them; a line up which I  am  sure\r\n\r\ncompares  most favourably with any other  legislature\r\n\r\nin  the  world. However, it is perhaps  pertinent  to\r\n\r\nremind  hon. Members that the reason all of  us  from\r\n\r\nthe  same party are here today is not because of  the\r\n\r\nnumber of Ph.Ds, or doctors that we have been able to\r\n\r\nparade  before our people but because for  1  7  long\r\n\r\nyears  the  first  generation  of  PAP  leaders  have\r\n\r\ndedicated the best part of their lives to working for\r\n\r\nthe  well-being of the people of Singapore, and they,\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore, have in turn  shown  their\r\n\r\nconfidence,  if  not appreciation,  in  no  uncertain\r\n\r\nmanner by voting solidly for the PAP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By entrusting the entire Parliament to us, our\r\n\r\npeople  have demonstrated once again their  faith  in\r\n\r\nour  ability to continue to exercise self-control and\r\n\r\nself-discipline both as a political party  and  as  a\r\n\r\ngovernment. They have demonstrated that they  believe\r\n\r\nin  our  ability to continue to work for a more  just\r\n\r\nand equal society, to maintain law and order, and  to\r\n\r\nensure social, economic and political stability. What\r\n\r\nwe say here, will, I feel sure, be followed with ever\r\n\r\ngreater   interest,  as  the  constituents  that   we\r\n\r\nrepresent  today  are much better educated,  informed\r\n\r\nand more sophisticated politically than say, five  or\r\n\r\n10  years  ago.  They are keenly conscious  of  their\r\n\r\nrights.   At  the  slightest  suggestion  of   unjust\r\n\r\nexploitation or unfair treatment, they expect  us  to\r\n\r\ncome  to  their defence. As Backbenchers we shall  be\r\n\r\nfailing  in  our  duty if we are insensitive  to  the\r\n\r\nfeelings on the ground. Let us voice the opinions  of\r\n\r\nthe  people without constraint or inhibition. Let  us\r\n\r\nnot  treat  this  Chamber as a place  for  expounding\r\n\r\nacademic theories which are best suited for scholarly\r\n\r\nseminars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years ahead we have been reminded that it is\r\n\r\nour  duty  at the Backbench to ensure that  no  major\r\n\r\npolicy or legislation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  passed without the closest scrutiny and the  most\r\n\r\nthorough debate at this House. It is, I submit,  also\r\n\r\nour  duty  to watch out most carefully the manner  in\r\n\r\nwhich   our  civil  servants  go  about  implementing\r\n\r\nGovernment policies. We should always make sure  that\r\n\r\nall  administrative measures taken are both just  and\r\n\r\nhumane  and that quality of service is not sacrificed\r\n\r\nfor expediency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is accepted that for the long-term benefit of\r\n\r\nour  people, unpopular measures may have to be  taken\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to  time. It falls upon us, however,  to\r\n\r\nquestion  whether  on  all such  occasions  the  most\r\n\r\nthorough  consideration has been given to  minimising\r\n\r\nthe  degree  of hardship and inconvenience  to  those\r\n\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last Parliament, we often talked about\r\n\r\nthe   growing   tendency  towards  bureaucracy,   the\r\n\r\nrudeness  and  callousness  of  some  of  our   civil\r\n\r\nservants, the lack of coordination between Government\r\n\r\ndepartments, the apparent changeability of Government\r\n\r\npolicies  and  measures  in  certain  areas  and  the\r\n\r\nunhealthy  inclination towards commercialism  of  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service.  There  is  sufficient  evidence   to\r\n\r\nindicate that much of what we complained of,  remains\r\n\r\nwith us today. As Backbenchers we may at times feel a\r\n\r\nlittle   tedious  or  frustrated  having  to   repeat\r\n\r\nourselves,  but we are duty bound to go  on  pointing\r\n\r\nout  all such anomalies and shortcomings for as  many\r\n\r\ntimes  as may be necessary so long as they appear  to\r\n\r\nus remain unrectified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's speech, together with the Addenda,\r\n\r\nillustrate once again the practical and down-to-earth\r\n\r\napproach  of our leadership. There are no  empty  and\r\n\r\nfanciful promises. The objectives that all Ministries\r\n\r\nhave  set  for  themselves are realistic  enough  and\r\n\r\nperhaps,  typical of our traditional style of  \"deeds\r\n\r\nand  not  words\", the descriptions of such objectives\r\n\r\nare  generally brief in words. However, for the words\r\n\r\nto  be  translated  into deeds,  the  continued  good\r\n\r\nservice  of  hon. Ministers is to my mind  absolutely\r\n\r\nvital.  In this connection, I am confident  that  all\r\n\r\nMembers in the Backbenches will gladly take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the challenge of the Leader of the House, when on\r\n\r\nthe   first   Sitting   of   Parliament,   he   urged\r\n\r\nBackbenchers to speak freely with open minds.  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  hon.  Ministers that if it is frankness  they\r\n\r\nwant,  they will certainly not be disappointed.  They\r\n\r\ncan  look  forward to some exciting moments  and  may\r\n\r\nnever have to complain of the lack of debate in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  To  do our job well, we may have to  take  to\r\n\r\ntask  without fear or favour any hon. Minister  found\r\n\r\nto  be wanting in his duties because he delegates  or\r\n\r\ndepends  too  much  on  civil servants,  and  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  fails  to  exercise sufficient  control  and\r\n\r\nsupervision  upon the formulation and  implementation\r\n\r\nof policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All too often. Backbenchers have been accused of\r\n\r\nusing  civil servants as convenient \"whipping  boys\".\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps some truth in the accusation as many\r\n\r\nof  the  sins,  major as well as minor ones,  of  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service were allowed to be perpetrated because\r\n\r\nof  the  lack  of  timely  intervention  or  wrongful\r\n\r\nintervention on the part of hon. Ministers.  We  also\r\n\r\nspoke of \"buck-passing\" in the past. Let us hope that\r\n\r\nwe will have no cause for complaint in this regard in\r\n\r\nthe   coming  months.  Let  us  hope  that  all  hon.\r\n\r\nMinisters  will work collectively and conscientiously\r\n\r\nas  a  team  and  will  lose none  of  the  political\r\n\r\nawareness  and sensitivity that are the  hallmark  of\r\n\r\nthe  PAP. It is, Sir, this exceptional quality of our\r\n\r\nentire  Cabinet  under the leadership  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  that has enabled the party to  continue  to\r\n\r\ninspire confidence in our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road ahead may not be as smooth as the distance\r\n\r\nthat has been covered so far. The hazards that we are\r\n\r\nlikely  to  face are numerous and have  been  clearly\r\n\r\npointed out by the President. Suffice it here to  add\r\n\r\nthat  our continued survival as a nation will  depend\r\n\r\non  the collective determination, ingenuity and  hard\r\n\r\nwork  of all parties concerned, namely, the political\r\n\r\nleadership,   civil  servants  and  the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I join my colleagues in thanking the\r\n\r\nPresident for his gracious speech to the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one\r\n\r\nof the great men of our times, Sir Winston Churchill,\r\n\r\nonce said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Life is a test and this world a place of trial.\r\n\r\nAlways the problems - or it may be the same problem -\r\n\r\nwill  be  presented to every generation in  different\r\n\r\nforms.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing could be more appropriate to the Singapore\r\n\r\ncontext.  Our test has been basically a  question  of\r\n\r\nsurvival  first, then growth. And as we  moved  along\r\n\r\nthe  path  of progress we have had to face  seemingly\r\n\r\ninsurmountable obstacles. But bold and tough policies\r\n\r\nof  the  PAP  Government, coupled with the resilience\r\n\r\nand the strong will of a unified people determined to\r\n\r\ndo  their  best helped us to prove wrong the  pundits\r\n\r\nwho  wrote us off in 1965. But that is not to say our\r\n\r\ntest  is  over for the problems are still here.  Some\r\n\r\nsimilar to those in the past, some different, but  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  our ability to solve them will be critical  to\r\n\r\nour continued survival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two important events have occurred during the past\r\n\r\nfive years that have shaped and changed the destinies\r\n\r\nof  nations, big and small. The sudden upset  in  the\r\n\r\nbalance  of  political forces in Southeast  Asia  has\r\n\r\nlent  encouragement  to  a  vigorous  resurgence   of\r\n\r\ncommunist  activities that threaten the  security  of\r\n\r\nour   neighbouring  countries.  It  has  also   given\r\n\r\nstimulus  to communist forces to mount a new strategy\r\n\r\nof  slow  infiltration  into various  strata  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety.  Secondly, the oil crisis which unleashed  a\r\n\r\nnew economic weapon that proved politically potent in\r\n\r\nundermining the great industrial nations of the  West\r\n\r\nbrought  about the worst economic crisis in  decades,\r\n\r\nand  for  us  it  brought about  problems  of  trade,\r\n\r\nunemployment and inflation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of these, Singapore has weathered the\r\n\r\nstorm.  But  bad  weather and  dark  clouds  are  now\r\n\r\ngathering  on  the  horizon  again.  The  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  have once again expressed their confidence\r\n\r\nthat   the  PAP  Government  can  pull  them  through\r\n\r\ndifficult  waters. But although the PAP won  all  the\r\n\r\nseats in the general elections, it would be naive for\r\n\r\nus  to  believe that the people are 100%  behind  us.\r\n\r\nFor, as we steer the ship of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstate  and  navigate the course  for  the  next  five\r\n\r\nyears,  let  us  not forget that people  have  become\r\n\r\npolitically more mature, as shown by their  rejection\r\n\r\nof the false pretences of the opposition parties, and\r\n\r\nat  the same time this means that they will grow more\r\n\r\ncritical of our policies and decisions. It is in this\r\n\r\ncontext   of   an   increasingly  more  sophisticated\r\n\r\nelectorate,  more volatile in their reaction  to  the\r\n\r\npolicies  we make and implement, that we welcome  the\r\n\r\nPresident's  call  for  a  more  thorough  debate  in\r\n\r\nParliament.  There  are  the  different  \"shades   of\r\n\r\nopinions\"  that have to be \"vigorously  voiced\".  But\r\n\r\nnot   for  us  the  vociferation  of  the  opposition\r\n\r\nparties, or that minority of liberals who cloak their\r\n\r\nacademic  exposition  in the name  of  democracy  and\r\n\r\nhuman  rights. For us it is a question of determining\r\n\r\nthe  bread and butter issues, the issues that  affect\r\n\r\nthe  rice bowl, issues that concern our economic  and\r\n\r\nindustrial well-being, our jobs, better education for\r\n\r\nour children, improved social and health amenities  -\r\n\r\nall  of  which  are measures intended to  better  the\r\n\r\nquality of life in our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in our efforts to seek a better life for our\r\n\r\npeople  we  have to differentiate between  those  who\r\n\r\ngenuinely  want to improve themselves and  those  who\r\n\r\nhave   been  given  their  inch  but  ask  for   that\r\n\r\nadditional  yard  without putting in  that  necessary\r\n\r\nextra  effort. The latter category is that  group  of\r\n\r\npeople who believe the nation owes them a living, who\r\n\r\ndo  not believe that reward is equated to performance\r\n\r\nbut  subscribe to a premise that higher rewards  must\r\n\r\ncome  with increasing haste and as a matter of right.\r\n\r\nSuch  an  attitude,  far from  being  latent  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety, is becoming evident and widespread with  the\r\n\r\nyounger generation and must be checked if we are  not\r\n\r\nto  go  the way of many countries in Western  Europe.\r\n\r\nThe  objective of improving and bettering one's  life\r\n\r\nhas   been  misconstrued  as  a  desire  to   achieve\r\n\r\nimmediate material gains, and this desire is in  turn\r\n\r\ncatalytic  in  generating an  impatience  with  one's\r\n\r\nimmobility   up   the   organisational   ladder    or\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction with even the slightest quirk in  the\r\n\r\nworking  environment. The resultant is the  perennial\r\n\r\nsituation  of  one  type of intense  labour  mobility\r\n\r\nwhich in times\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  conducive economic circumstances rears  its  head\r\n\r\nunder  the synonym of \"job-hopping\". The announcement\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister for Labour that the National  Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil  will consider whether job-hoppers  would  be\r\n\r\ngranted recommended full wage increases would to some\r\n\r\nextent  discourage job-hopping. But it is hoped  that\r\n\r\nthe  NWC will clearly define \"job-hopping\", and  that\r\n\r\nnothing  is  done to discriminate against  those  who\r\n\r\nmove  not  through mere fickleness, but who  find  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  do so because of a genuine  desire  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  one's skills or because he has incurred  the\r\n\r\ndispleasure  of  those to whom he is subordinate  to.\r\n\r\nMore often than not we have called upon employees  to\r\n\r\nmake  sacrifices.  It would not be untimely  at  this\r\n\r\nstage also to remind employers that they too have  to\r\n\r\nmake their contributions as a partner in the economy.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  talk of increasing productivity we tend  to\r\n\r\nforget   that   employers  must   also   make   their\r\n\r\ncontribution in terms of proper incentive schemes and\r\n\r\nthe  provision of more efficient plant and equipment.\r\n\r\nLest  we  forget,  ours  is a  system  of  tripartite\r\n\r\npartnership  of labour, employer, and Government  and\r\n\r\nno  one  partner  subjugates the  other  and  no  one\r\n\r\npartner can shirk his responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the English press lamented on the\r\n\r\nlack of female representation in Parliament when  the\r\n\r\nPAP  announced  its  candidates  for  the  elections.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  that is why unwittingly to them the Minister\r\n\r\nof  Defence has been thinking of drafting them. While\r\n\r\nit  is  not my intention to champion their cause  and\r\n\r\nrisk  the  wrath of those in this Chamber  who  would\r\n\r\nlabel  me  a `ladies' man', I would like to  raise  a\r\n\r\npoint  concerning working women who  constitute  half\r\n\r\nour work force. Women today want to be recognised  in\r\n\r\ntheir   own  right,  and  have  been,  at  least   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  They  want and have the right  to  pursue\r\n\r\ntheir  careers, whether it is a job at the  executive\r\n\r\nlevel  or  along the production line. But more  often\r\n\r\nthan not the pursuit of a career ends after marriage,\r\n\r\nthat  is  to  say, many are unable to  reconcile  the\r\n\r\nobjective of carrying on working with that of raising\r\n\r\nand  looking after a family. And we have therefore  a\r\n\r\nsituation where those who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave acquired skills for years have to stop utilising\r\n\r\nwhat  they have learned. And we also have a situation\r\n\r\nwhere  foreign workers have to be employed  when  our\r\n\r\nmarried  mothers  could well have fitted  into  their\r\n\r\nplaces.  But they are not to blame for no woman,  not\r\n\r\nleast  any  man, would like to face the trauma  of  a\r\n\r\nbroken  home, and of delinquent children as a  result\r\n\r\nof  neglect  of  the family all for  the  sake  of  a\r\n\r\ncareer.  But the cost to society, in terms of wastage\r\n\r\nof  learned  skills,  of having to  rely  on  foreign\r\n\r\nlabour, of not being able to make their contributions\r\n\r\nas  citizens  to  our  economy, of  being  unable  to\r\n\r\ncontribute to the family income, is high. It  is  not\r\n\r\nsuffice  to  say  that creches have been  established\r\n\r\nwhere working mothers can leave their children and to\r\n\r\ncarry  on working, for it is obvious that these  have\r\n\r\nnot  proved to be popular enough to encourage mothers\r\n\r\nto  do  so and concentrate on increasing their family\r\n\r\nincome and to contribute to the economy. I call  upon\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Labour and the Ministry  of  Social\r\n\r\nAffairs to work closely, perhaps in consultation with\r\n\r\nvarious  women's  organisations  to  scrutinise  this\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I come now to the Addendum on the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance. It is encouraging to note that a\r\n\r\nspecial  effort will be made to encourage industries,\r\n\r\nparticularly  those  that  supply  parts   to   other\r\n\r\nmanufacturers, We have to be blunt enough  to  admit,\r\n\r\nas  the  Member  for  Kallang has implied,  that  our\r\n\r\npresent tax system has been a contributory factor  in\r\n\r\nmany investors shying away from Singapore. That there\r\n\r\nare  many  incentives given by the EDB  is  not  good\r\n\r\nenough  for such incentives have been aimed  more  at\r\n\r\nthe  `giants' and the pioneers of industries.  It  is\r\n\r\ntime  for us now to give emphasis to small industries\r\n\r\nparticularly those which are classified as supporting\r\n\r\nindustries,  that  is, those which  supply  parts  to\r\n\r\nothers who put these parts together to constitute the\r\n\r\nfinished   product.  And  when  there  are   adequate\r\n\r\n`supporters'  in  a  particular industry,  this  will\r\n\r\nencourage   manufacturers  of  the   finished   goods\r\n\r\nrequiring the parts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade  by  these `supporters', to set up their  plants\r\n\r\nhere,  for  easy  access of  supply  of  parts  is  a\r\n\r\nfundamental factor in determining plant location. The\r\n\r\nspiralling  effect is obvious: more manufacturers  of\r\n\r\nthe  finished  product means more  factories  in  the\r\n\r\nsupporting   industry.   But   which   comes   first?\r\n\r\nSupporting  industries would not  start  here  unless\r\n\r\nthey  are  assured also of a ready market  for  their\r\n\r\nproducts.  The `chicken-and-egg' question then  comes\r\n\r\ninto play.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The call to encourage industries that seek wider\r\n\r\nand newer markets overseas is also a good one and the\r\n\r\nsteps  being  taken by the Ministry of Communications\r\n\r\nto  develop  airfreighting facilities at our  airport\r\n\r\nwill  be  timely and will contribute  vastly  to  the\r\n\r\nefforts of our export-oriented industries. For it  is\r\n\r\nan undeniable fact of marketing that one's ability to\r\n\r\nmove  one's products to the market place  at  a  fast\r\n\r\npace  and  at  the  lowest possible  cost  determines\r\n\r\nwhether one is successful or not. I do not doubt that\r\n\r\nwe  have enough airlines coming through Singapore  to\r\n\r\ncarry  our products to all corners of the world.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  I  doubt is the ability to do so at  low  cost.\r\n\r\nSingapore exporters do not enjoy the cheap  rates  of\r\n\r\nair  charter  cargo services going out of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nHong Kong offers such services to its industries  for\r\n\r\nair charter cargo services can give rates that are as\r\n\r\nlow   as  a  quarter  of  rates  offered  by  regular\r\n\r\nscheduled  airlines,  It  is  in  this  question   of\r\n\r\ntransportation  cost that Singapore  industries  have\r\n\r\noften   lost   that   competitive   edge   to   their\r\n\r\ncounterparts   in   Hong   Kong.   At   the   moment,\r\n\r\nconsolidated air cargo services are allowed to  bring\r\n\r\nin  cargo  to  Singapore at low  rates  but  are  not\r\n\r\nallowed to operate similarly out of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, lastly I would like to dwell on a\r\n\r\ntopic which has been raised on many occasions in this\r\n\r\nChamber  and  no doubt would continue to  do  so.  It\r\n\r\nconcerns  attitudes  adopted  by  civil  servants  in\r\n\r\ndealing  with members of the public. More often  than\r\n\r\nnot,  civil servants, perhaps in their desire to show\r\n\r\ntheir efficiency and perhaps to show nice figures  to\r\n\r\ntheir  Ministers  at the end of each financial  year,\r\n\r\nfollow  every  rule to the letter, even when  unusual\r\n\r\nand unexpected\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncircumstances    do   arise   that   merit    special\r\n\r\nconsideration. A story appeared in the  Sunday  Times\r\n\r\nlast  Sunday  about the case of a  family  which  was\r\n\r\nasked  by  the HDB to return the 13th month allowance\r\n\r\nalready   paid  to  an  employee  but  who  had   the\r\n\r\nmisfortune to die just a few days before 1976  ended.\r\n\r\nWhile  it  is not my intention to go into  the  legal\r\n\r\naspects  of  the  case, I cannot but agree  with  the\r\n\r\nperson who wrote the article that there could not  be\r\n\r\na   more   glaring  example  than   this   of   rigid\r\n\r\nunimaginative adherence to rules and regulations, and\r\n\r\nof    an   insensitive,   inflexible   and   mindless\r\n\r\nbureaucracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon.

Abrupt replies to  inquiries  from\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public, a straight `no' in  the  face\r\n\r\ninstead  of  a  proper explanation  of  the  decision\r\n\r\nimplemented,  a deliberate display of high-handedness\r\n\r\n-these are all acts that give the impression, whether\r\n\r\nrightly  or  wrongly,  that  requests  are  sometimes\r\n\r\nturned  down  without  a  detailed  scrutiny  of  the\r\n\r\nsurrounding  circumstances.

Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  add my support to the Motion moved  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Ulu Pandan to thank the President for  his\r\n\r\nspeech. In his speech to the House on the 8th of this\r\n\r\nmonth, the President has charted the path of progress\r\n\r\nfor  the  nation in the next few years.  We  owe  our\r\n\r\npresent well-being to hard work in the past,  and  we\r\n\r\nhave to continue with it to maintain our progress for\r\n\r\nfuture  prosperity. As we become  more  affluent,  we\r\n\r\nshall have more to spend and to save.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst spending is a relatively simple matter and\r\n\r\nalthough some people seem to have difficulty spending\r\n\r\nwithin their means,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaving can pose quite a considerable problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President in his speech has indicated that we\r\n\r\nhave now to be prepared for slower growth rates,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore we have to adjust accordingly our  spending\r\n\r\nhabits  both as a Government and as individuals.  But\r\n\r\nthen  to  maintain a low spending habit, the cost  of\r\n\r\nliving should be checked seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people living in flats face very high costs and\r\n\r\ntheir battle against inflation never ends. Since  the\r\n\r\nhome-ownership  scheme  was introduced,  flat  owners\r\n\r\nhave  to pay housing instalments, conservancy charges\r\n\r\nand  many  other  indirect  expenditure.  Though  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  are encouraged to purchase HDB  flats,  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of these flats is too high for the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  group. For instance, a new flat may have  two\r\n\r\ntoilet bowls which would automatically cost the owner\r\n\r\n$6 in sewer fees. The bills for other appliances like\r\n\r\nthe cooker, heater, etc, which are necessities, would\r\n\r\nbe a bigger burden for the lower income group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides this, the PUB does not help to alleviate\r\n\r\nthe  plight of the flat owner. The PUB levies tax  on\r\n\r\nthe  total bill which includes the rental of cookers,\r\n\r\nheaters,  etc. This surcharge should be reviewed.  Is\r\n\r\nthis  surcharge really necessary? We should be paying\r\n\r\ntax  on  rates  and  not on rentals.  This  surcharge\r\n\r\nshould  only  be  levied where there is  evidence  of\r\n\r\nindiscriminate use of utilities and not on rentals of\r\n\r\nappliances,  which are necessities. The  Addendum  on\r\n\r\nthe Public Utilities Board states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`69% of the Board's annual recurrent expenditure\r\n\r\nbefore  depreciation and interest charges is on  fuel\r\n\r\noil  for  electricity generation. Continuous  efforts\r\n\r\nare being made to increase operational efficiency  of\r\n\r\ngenerators to conserve the consumption of  fuel  oil.\r\n\r\nAs  a result of increasing efficiency, the Board has,\r\n\r\nso  far, been able to absorb the 10% increase .., in\r\n\r\nthe  price  of  fuel oil since October 1975,  without\r\n\r\nincreasing the price of electricity to consumers.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board now says that the latest increase in oil\r\n\r\nprices will necessitate an upward revision of the\r\n\r\ntariffs. Is this really necessary? Can it not be\r\n\r\navoided? Here again, in general, the people are most\r\n\r\nunhappy about the present rates and charges of the\r\n\r\nPUB and if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   tariffs  are  raised  there  will  be   greater\r\n\r\ndiscontent among the masses. Perhaps the reserve fund\r\n\r\ncould  be used as a subsidy to undercut the inflation\r\n\r\nor  perhaps the interest on the reserve fund could be\r\n\r\nused  as a subsidy. On the other hand, we should  not\r\n\r\nonly  depend on fuel oil as our source of energy.  We\r\n\r\nshould  seriously think of other alternative  sources\r\n\r\nof energy; like coal, etc. If rising oil prices is  a\r\n\r\ngreat  threat  to  our country, it is  time  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  import coal as a standby or as  a  substitute\r\n\r\nfor  fuel, During the Occupation Period there was  no\r\n\r\noil.  Everyone had to use coal. Why do we not try  to\r\n\r\nuse coal again instead of oil?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past too many schemes have been\r\n\r\nintroduced  on a trial and error basis  without  much\r\n\r\nproper  pre-planning, consultation or even debate  in\r\n\r\nParliament. As such, some of them had complicated  or\r\n\r\nconfused the people as to what they were all about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the fringe car parks and the shuttle\r\n\r\nbus service which cost the Government some $7 million\r\n\r\nhad  an  initial disastrous result. Fortunately,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had  an alternative plan to  salvage  the\r\n\r\nscheme  from total failure. The point which  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  stress here is that in future thorough  and\r\n\r\nproper pre-planning should be conducted prior to  any\r\n\r\nimplementation of projects or schemes.  Otherwise  if\r\n\r\nthe  plans turn out to be a failure, the people  will\r\n\r\nbe  confused or Government funds wasted. In line with\r\n\r\nthis,  any  amendments  to taxes,  rates  or  tariffs\r\n\r\nintroduced  by the Government or any statutory  body,\r\n\r\nshould be first brought to Parliament for debate  and\r\n\r\napproval before implementing it, and it should  never\r\n\r\nbe like in the past where some taxes and amendment to\r\n\r\nrates  were  introduced overnight,  which  eventually\r\n\r\nresulted in comments here and there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Environment Ministry says that the present\r\n\r\n28,750  licensed hawkers in Singapore are  sufficient\r\n\r\nto  cater  for  our  population.  I  agree  with  it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, no new licence will be issued because of a\r\n\r\ndiversion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   manpower  to  more  productive  sectors  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy.  If  this  is the case, a review  should  be\r\n\r\nconducted   on  the  existing  hawkers  to  determine\r\n\r\nwhether  the licensed persons themselves are managing\r\n\r\nthe  stalls,  because at the moment many stalls  have\r\n\r\nbeen  illegally sub-let to other people. Furthermore,\r\n\r\nthe  envisaged upward revision of hawker licence fees\r\n\r\nin  stages,  in view of the escalation  of  costs  of\r\n\r\nbuilding and maintenance of markets and food centres,\r\n\r\nmay  be  a  blow  to consumers. If you  increase  the\r\n\r\nlicence  fee,  they will increase the  price  of  the\r\n\r\nfood.  Is this necessary? Can it not be avoided?  Has\r\n\r\nany  thought been given to the repercussion that will\r\n\r\nfollow?  I personally feel that hawkers will transfer\r\n\r\nthe  extra cost to the consumers. An alternative plan\r\n\r\nshould  be  conceived to ensure that  the  additional\r\n\r\ncosts will not be borne by the consumers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking about the civil service, many officers\r\n\r\nhave  reached the top of their salary scale and their\r\n\r\npay  has  been  stagnated  for  many  years.  If   an\r\n\r\nofficer's pay is stagnated for many years, he  cannot\r\n\r\nwork hard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study should be made of all these officers to\r\n\r\nassess  their  capabilities  and  potentialities  and\r\n\r\nemplace them on an adjusted wage scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the past, in promotion exercises, there were\r\n\r\nmany   instances   of  dissatisfaction   in   certain\r\n\r\nquarters, the reasons for which may be genuine. As an\r\n\r\nexample,   a  matured  person  with  many  years   of\r\n\r\nexperience  and paper qualification, finds  a  young\r\n\r\ngraduate   who  had  at  one  time  been  under   his\r\n\r\nsupervision is now promoted and takes over  from  his\r\n\r\nprevious  superior. Is this promotion not a  mockery?\r\n\r\nAgain  there are certain jobs where the wrong sex  is\r\n\r\nput  in charge. Something should be done to this sort\r\n\r\nof  promotion.  Otherwise you may get a  dissatisfied\r\n\r\ncivil  service which may affect the quality of  work.\r\n\r\nObviously  you  will  find some experienced  officers\r\n\r\nsticking  to  their job and passing time  because  of\r\n\r\ntheir many years' service. Others may be looking  for\r\n\r\ngreener  pastures  in  the  private  sector.   Proper\r\n\r\ninstructions  should be outlined to the  effect  that\r\n\r\nthe right officer who has the experience\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nand  qualification should be in the right  place  and\r\n\r\nnot a green-horn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some years ago certain statutory bodies gave\r\n\r\ntheir  employees who were in the Pension  Scheme  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to opt for the CPF scheme. This, in fact,\r\n\r\nwas a wise move and many officers made use of the CPF\r\n\r\nto purchase HDB flats. However, those who did not opt\r\n\r\nat  that time had some reservations for many personal\r\n\r\nreasons.  Perhaps a second offer of an option  should\r\n\r\nbe  considered because now that some time has  passed\r\n\r\nthe  majority have already made up their mind  either\r\n\r\nto stay on in the Pension Scheme or to opt for CPF in\r\n\r\norder to get help in the purchase of HDB flats.  This\r\n\r\noption  would  also  help in the computation  of  the\r\n\r\nbenefits when a person retires from service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of CPF, I wonder whether consideration\r\n\r\ncould  be given for employees to utilise their  funds\r\n\r\nin the CPF to buy flats built by statutory bodies. If\r\n\r\nthis  service is extended to them the occupancy  rate\r\n\r\nof  flats  built  by the statutory bodies  for  their\r\n\r\nemployees would be far better than what it is at  the\r\n\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of late there has been a lot of exposure of\r\n\r\ntraitors  in  our midst, Although some of  them  have\r\n\r\nbeen detected, detained and released, there seems  to\r\n\r\nbe  some  hard-cores who do not repent. Is there  any\r\n\r\nproper reeducation programme being carried out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ISD is doing a good job in tracking these\r\n\r\nelements, many of whom have been brought to book. But\r\n\r\nwhat  about those not detected or those who  will  be\r\n\r\nmisled by the hardcore? The Home Affairs, Defence and\r\n\r\nEducation  Ministries  should work  very  closely  to\r\n\r\ncheck these anti-national elements at the grass-roots\r\n\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the main aim in education is to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  moral and civic education.  Whilst  every\r\n\r\neffort  is  being  done  to  raise  the  quality   of\r\n\r\neducation  in the Republic, a close watch  should  be\r\n\r\nmade  at  our schools where there are too many  drop-outs,\r\n\r\ndrug   addicts,  gangsters  and   all   those\r\n\r\nundesirable  acts. These schools require a  cleansing\r\n\r\noperation. I received a complaint from a father  that\r\n\r\nevery\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nday  his son has been asking for money and if he does\r\n\r\nnot  give him any money, his son would beat him.  The\r\n\r\nfather  reported this to the police and his  son  was\r\n\r\narrested. The son was locked up for one day  but  was\r\n\r\nreleased  on  the next day. I feel that a  proper  re\r\n\r\neducation programme must be carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Prime Minister has to be praised for\r\n\r\nhis   fruitful  visits  to  different  countries   on\r\n\r\ngoodwill  tours. He has done a great deal to  promote\r\n\r\ntrade  and international understanding for Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  is welcoming to hear that we are encouraging  and\r\n\r\nexpecting more tourists to visit Singapore.  However,\r\n\r\nthe  transportation service that is required to  cope\r\n\r\nwith  an  increased influx of tourists  seems  rather\r\n\r\ninadequate.  Taxis and tour buses  should  be  easily\r\n\r\navailable for the tours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on behalf of the people of Anson Constituency,\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to express our high  esteem  for  the\r\n\r\nPresident's Speech delivered at the opening  of  this\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin (Bedok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise in support of the motion moved by the Member for\r\n\r\nUlu Pandan to thank the President for his address  at\r\n\r\nthe  Opening  of  the  First Session  of  the  Fourth\r\n\r\nParliament.  It was an inspiring speech which  should\r\n\r\nconstitute   the   main   guiding   factor   in   our\r\n\r\ndeliberations in this new session of Parliament. Many\r\n\r\nof my colleagues have already spoken on various vital\r\n\r\nissues ranging from PUB charges to Communist threats.\r\n\r\nAll the 11 new Members have already made their maiden\r\n\r\nspeeches, touching upon matters of bread and  butter\r\n\r\nissues which are of common concern to the common  man\r\n\r\n-  the  man-in-the-street. For it is the  man-in-the-street\r\n\r\nwho  ultimately matters most. His  life,  his\r\n\r\nlivelihood, his well-being, his problems, his family,\r\n\r\nhis happiness\r\n\r\n- these are issues which should be our prime concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have therefore chosen to speak, on a subject\r\n\r\nwhich  is first and foremost of great concern  to  us\r\n\r\nall Singaporeans and which, at the same time, is very\r\n\r\nclose to my own heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI speak not only in my new role as a Backbencher and\r\n\r\neducationist but as a parent as well. The  subject  I\r\n\r\nshall  speak  on will concern all parents,  that  is,\r\n\r\nEducation,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, I believe, the responsibility of the\r\n\r\nGovernment to provide the right kind of education for\r\n\r\nour  children, as the right kind of education is  the\r\n\r\nkey  to  a  good  life,  a good  conduct,  a  correct\r\n\r\nattitude,  a key to the world, both our own  and  the\r\n\r\nbigger  one  outside. Education being  a  process  of\r\n\r\nliving  and  an  inseparable part of  one's  personal\r\n\r\ndevelopment, as one journeys through life's  maze  of\r\n\r\nproblems and pressures, its importance cannot be over-stressed.\r\n\r\nThis,  I  think, is  recognized.  However,\r\n\r\nwhile  we  have  all  recognized its  importance  and\r\n\r\nimplications,   have   we  been   mapping   out   and\r\n\r\nimplementing the right policies in education? It is a\r\n\r\ndifficult task, rio doubt. And upon the shoulders  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Education has fallen this  difficult\r\n\r\ntask.   The  Ministry  of  Education  is   not   only\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  the  formulation  of  our   present\r\n\r\neducational  policies, it should also be  responsible\r\n\r\nfor  their  successful implementation and  to  ensure\r\n\r\ntheir practicality and usefulness. Has this been  the\r\n\r\ncase? This is the question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past few years have seen a great deal of debate\r\n\r\non  and discussion of our education system, not  only\r\n\r\nwithin  this  House but also without. In some  cases,\r\n\r\nthe  deliberations have been very intense, mainly  in\r\n\r\nthe  problem areas. Much has also been printed on the\r\n\r\nsubject. One particular newspaper published a  series\r\n\r\nof  articles, based on surveys it conducted.  Parents\r\n\r\nand  teachers  joined in the fray with their  letters\r\n\r\nand articles in the Mentor, the official organ of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Teachers' Union. Much of the statements has\r\n\r\nbeen  critical.  Some  of the  utterances  have  been\r\n\r\nevaluative and useful. There have also been instances\r\n\r\nof  angry and contemptuous comment. All these  go  to\r\n\r\nshow  the immense concern our people in general  have\r\n\r\nover  the education of their children, in the  future\r\n\r\nof their children. The questions that follow are: How\r\n\r\nmuch have we who are in Government taken note of all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese?  How much of the useful points raised have  we\r\n\r\nused  in  our  reviews and reevaluation of  policies?\r\n\r\nThere appears to be a continuing discontent over  our\r\n\r\neducational policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me touch upon a few areas in our\r\n\r\neducational  policies and our education system  which\r\n\r\nhave  brought  about a great deal of unhappiness  and\r\n\r\nnot a little confusion. The unhappiness and confusion\r\n\r\napparently cut across the entire score board\r\n\r\n-  principals,  teachers,  parents  and  pupils.  The\r\n\r\ngeneral  feeling during the past few years  has  been\r\n\r\nthat  students  have been made the  \"guinea-pigs\"  of\r\n\r\nwhat  appeared  to  be a series of  rather  haphazard\r\n\r\nexperiments  formulated totally on an ad  hoc  basis,\r\n\r\nwithout  any  prior research nor any  in-depth  study\r\n\r\ndone.    Principals   and   teachers   are    equally\r\n\r\napprehensive  and concerned over the frequent  \"chops\r\n\r\nand  changes\". But most concerned of all are parents,\r\n\r\nnaturally. They are often heard complaining about the\r\n\r\nfrequent  implementation of short-lived policies  and\r\n\r\nnew  ideas, only to be aborted before they have  time\r\n\r\nto  take  root.  New  experiments  are  abandoned  as\r\n\r\nswiftly  as  they are implemented. Can we wonder  the\r\n\r\nconcern expressed all around? The recent Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  announcement of its decision to  impose  a\r\n\r\nsecond  language  requirement  for  entry  into  pre-university\r\n\r\nclasses in 1979 and 1980 is an example  of\r\n\r\nwhat has generated much concern among parents. It has\r\n\r\nalso  aroused anger and annoyance. Students begin  to\r\n\r\nfeel  insecure all over again, unsure of their future\r\n\r\nand what is actually to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is needed now is to convince all concerned,\r\n\r\nespecially parents whose children are, in  the  final\r\n\r\nanalysis,  the  ones to benefit or  to  suffer,  that\r\n\r\nthere   is   every  justification  for   this   fresh\r\n\r\nimposition.  There may be, as there should  be,  very\r\n\r\ngood  grounds for the move. But if there are, we have\r\n\r\nnot  heard  them in clear terms, in simple  language,\r\n\r\nand  in convincing tone. What parents and pupils  are\r\n\r\nuneasy  about is that this may yet be another one  of\r\n\r\nthose many new experiments and new ideas that crop up\r\n\r\nin the minds of Ministry officials. What they wish to\r\n\r\nknow is whether\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  new  decision is the result of a careful  study\r\n\r\nand  survey  of  the  real  needs  of  pre-university\r\n\r\nstudents.  And would this really create a new  thirst\r\n\r\nfor  the  learning of a second or third language?  Or\r\n\r\nwould   students  do  it  simply  because  they   are\r\n\r\ncompelled  to  and not because they  are  interested?\r\n\r\nThere  are, too, numerous other attendant aspects  of\r\n\r\nthe   second  language  learning  process  that  must\r\n\r\nnecessarily  be  looked  into before  a  far-reaching\r\n\r\nchange of this nature is implemented. We must presume\r\n\r\nthat  the  situation  has  been  fully  assessed  and\r\n\r\nevaluated. But has it? Factual and forthright answers\r\n\r\nto  these  various questions would go a long  way  to\r\n\r\ndispel  the doubts lingering in the minds of  parents\r\n\r\nand  pupils.  I  think  we  need  these  answers  and\r\n\r\nassurances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Addendum to the\r\n\r\nPresidential Address on the Ministry of Education, it\r\n\r\nsays, amongst other things, that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Moral and civics education is mainly taught through\r\n\r\nthe   subject  Education  For  Living  which   is   a\r\n\r\ncombination of Civics. History and Geography) in  the\r\n\r\npupils' mother tongue'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  as far as I know, when the Education For Living\r\n\r\nidea was introduced, it was aimed to give exposure to\r\n\r\npupils  doing  a  second  language,  which  may   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  be  the mother tongue. Let  me  give  an\r\n\r\nexample. To many children who go to an English-medium\r\n\r\nschool,  English  is  a foreign  language.  Even  for\r\n\r\nchildren  of  Chinese  ethnic origin  who  come  from\r\n\r\nEnglish-speaking  homes,  they  will  find  that  the\r\n\r\nlearning  of  Mandarin is not an easy  task  to  cope\r\n\r\nwith, Mandarin not being their mother tongue. In such\r\n\r\nhomes,  it  is  probable  that  other  than  English,\r\n\r\nCantonese, or Hokkien or Teochew would be spoken. But\r\n\r\nMalay  children  attending an  English-medium  school\r\n\r\nwould  find it easy enough to learn Malay as a second\r\n\r\nlanguage  because  they speak  Malay  at  home.  Then\r\n\r\nagain,  the Education For Living idea is carried  Out\r\n\r\nonly in the primary schools, but not in the secondary\r\n\r\nschools, where  Civics, History  and  Geography  are\r\n\r\nrequired  to  be  offered separately.  Where  is  the\r\n\r\ncontinuity?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the feeling that the problems in education\r\n\r\ntoday are traceable to the primary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschools,  where all kinds of what must have  appeared\r\n\r\nto  parents and pupils alike, very ad hoc  ideas  and\r\n\r\ndecisions  -  like  the Primary  Pilot  Project,  the\r\n\r\nEducation  For Living, and what have you!  While  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of these new-fangled ideas introduced in  the\r\n\r\nrecent  years  has been disconcerting, the  frequency\r\n\r\nwith   which  they  have  been  introduced  has  been\r\n\r\nastounding.  Where have all these ideas  so  suddenly\r\n\r\ncome from? The answer would be enlightening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resulting frustration is inevitable. The\r\n\r\nresulting feeling of insecurity rears its ugly  head.\r\n\r\nThe resulting position can be most damaging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take what took place a few years back when almost\r\n\r\nequal  weightage  was  given to the  second  language\r\n\r\nbecause of a policy change. Many pupils attempting to\r\n\r\nachieve  equal proficiency in languages at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime   actually  ended  up  achieving  neither.  They\r\n\r\nfinished \"half baked\" in both languages What was, for\r\n\r\nexample, the rationale behind this policy change? Was\r\n\r\nthere any attempt made to assess the damage done as a\r\n\r\nresult?  Our  education system, with its  examination\r\n\r\nand   achievement  oriented  characteristics,  places\r\n\r\ndemands and pressures upon our children to an  extent\r\n\r\nof  daily harassment with hardly any let-up. Language\r\n\r\nlearning capacity differs from person to person. This\r\n\r\nmust  be  realised.  To expect everyone  and  all  to\r\n\r\nprogress   similarly  together  in   this   difficult\r\n\r\nlearning  process is to expect too much. It would  be\r\n\r\nunrealistic, and it would be impractical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current wave of social ills prevalent all\r\n\r\naround us is another aspect of education I would like\r\n\r\nto  touch upon. For the ills of society are traceable\r\n\r\nto  the  schools.  I  feel that  there  should  be  a\r\n\r\nspiritual  balance too in our education system.  This\r\n\r\nwould  certainly  combat the making  of  future  drug\r\n\r\naddicts,  drug traffickers, gangsters and other  such\r\n\r\nlike men of menace in society. A touch of religion is\r\n\r\nalways   good.  Any  moral  value,  strengthened   by\r\n\r\nreligious belief, at once becomes a matter of greater\r\n\r\nconviction and a better sense. Otherwise, the  trend\r\n\r\ntowards a money-minded and materialistic society\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  continue unabated. Proper, correct  all  round\r\n\r\neducation should provide for the development  of  the\r\n\r\nintellectual,   physical,  social,   aesthetic,   and\r\n\r\nspiritual, areas of a growing person. One need not be\r\n\r\na  fanatic  in any of these areas. A balance  of  all\r\n\r\nthese   aspects  of  the  growing  process  is   most\r\n\r\ndesirable.  This  should be our aim  and  purpose  in\r\n\r\nteaching the young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a last point, may I now turn my attention to the\r\n\r\narea  of  Extra-Curricular  Activities, or  ECA  for\r\n\r\nshort.  The aims and objectives are laudable  enough.\r\n\r\nWe  do  want  the rugged Singaporean more  than  just\r\n\r\nbookworms, As they say, a sound mind in a sound  body\r\n\r\nis  the  best thing in the world. Games are made  for\r\n\r\nhealth. Debates and the like are made for intelligent\r\n\r\nenjoyment.  Uniformed  organisations  are  made   for\r\n\r\nsmartness   and  discipline.  Other  ,extracurricular\r\n\r\nactivities are made for leisure. These are all  fine,\r\n\r\nuntil  their  implementation goes  wrong,  until  the\r\n\r\nimportance  becomes lopsided, until the real  purpose\r\n\r\ngoes   cockeyed.  The  over-stress  placed   on   ECA\r\n\r\nactivities  in  the  recent  years  has  turned   the\r\n\r\noriginal aim and purpose more than a little awry. The\r\n\r\nresult? Pupils participate in ECA activities  not  so\r\n\r\nmuch to better themselves physically or to better the\r\n\r\ncorrect  enjoyment  of  their leisure,  but  to  gain\r\n\r\npoints  to  add  to  their academic achievements, in\r\n\r\norder  to  gain admission to pre.-university classes.\r\n\r\nThis  is  true in countless instances in schools  all\r\n\r\nover  the island. All this again has been the  result\r\n\r\nof  over-emphasis placed on a \"new idea\" - I say \"new\r\n\r\nidea\"   because  the  idea  of  physical   well-being\r\n\r\ncomplementing  mental and intellectual well-being  is\r\n\r\nas old as the hills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my purpose in bringing up all these various\r\n\r\npoints  is  not  so much to be unduly  critical,  but\r\n\r\nmerely to express the general feeling prevalent among\r\n\r\nprincipals,  teachers, parents and pupils  like.  But\r\n\r\nmore  importantly, to urge the authorities  concerned\r\n\r\nto  make  a careful and an in-depth study -  a  real,\r\n\r\ngenuine survey - of a situation before making  policy\r\n\r\nchanges which in the ultimate analysis affect our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizens as a whole, for today's school children  are\r\n\r\ntomorrow's  citizens of the State, who  will  have  a\r\n\r\nhand  in  the running of the government, the business\r\n\r\nworld  and  society. The implications  of  a  drastic\r\n\r\nchange  is  often lost sight of in the enthusiasm  of\r\n\r\nimplementing a new idea. The frequency of changes can\r\n\r\nalso  be  bewildering. But these would  be  quite  in\r\n\r\norder  if  they are made after a careful  study,  not\r\n\r\njust  because a few principals happen to  agree  with\r\n\r\nthe  changes. I do not think I need elaborate on  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  a  good survey and  the  value  of  a\r\n\r\nthorough  study before one embarks upon  a  new  idea\r\n\r\nwhich is to be implemented and which will affect  the\r\n\r\nlives   of  hundreds  of  thousands  of  our   future\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the question of making the reasons\r\n\r\nfor  far-reaching  changes  widely  known.  This   is\r\n\r\nequally   important  for  general   information   and\r\n\r\nacceptance.  Otherwise  the  unhealthy   feeling   of\r\n\r\n\"throat-ramming\"  will, rightly or wrongly,  persist.\r\n\r\nNeedless  to say, a policy change in .education  that\r\n\r\nhas the acceptance and support of the people - parents\r\n\r\nin  particular - is certainly bound to have a greater\r\n\r\nchance  of  success  than otherwise.  Any  successful\r\n\r\npolicy  change is also bound to be easier to maintain\r\n\r\nand sustain upon implementation, thereby avoiding the\r\n\r\nrather  unpleasant task of having  to  make  frequent\r\n\r\n\"chops   and   changes\"   and   to   offer   repeated\r\n\r\nexplanations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Addendum to the President's Speech the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, amongst other things, correctly pointed out\r\n\r\nthat  our  youth  \"take  the relative  prosperity  of\r\n\r\nSingapore as the norm\" and everything else that  goes\r\n\r\nwith  it, like \"high expectations, the desire to seek\r\n\r\njobs  in  comfortable surroundings\". Sir,  the  young\r\n\r\nthat  we  are much concerned about are, in fact,  the\r\n\r\nproducts  of  our  educational  policy  -   the   PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment's   educational  policy   based   on   the\r\n\r\nacceptance  of  the  1956  Report  of  the  All-Party\r\n\r\nCommittee  of the Singapore Legislative  Assembly  on\r\n\r\nChinese  education which provided,  inter  alia,  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  bilingual  education   in   primary\r\n\r\nschools   and   trilingual  education  in   secondary\r\n\r\nschools.  Our  present  educational  system  was  the\r\n\r\nresult of the Prof. Lim Tay Boh Education\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry which was set up in  1962  when\r\n\r\nwe  were  part  of Malaysia. Its Final  Report  which\r\n\r\nembodied  the  unanimous findings and recommendations\r\n\r\nwas submitted in 1963. Since then, more than a decade\r\n\r\nago,  our  educational system has undergone  so  many\r\n\r\nchanges  not  only in terms of the  frequent  ad  hoc\r\n\r\npolicy  changes  that have caused  a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\nconfusion, irritation and frustration among teachers,\r\n\r\nprincipals,  pupils and parents alike, but  in  that\r\n\r\nperiod of seven years there have been six changes  of\r\n\r\nMinisters.  In  the  Addendum  on  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation much stress has been laid on the Ministry's\r\n\r\nplans to reduce drastically the \"enormous wastage  in\r\n\r\nterms of pupils not benefiting from the system\". This\r\n\r\nmay  appear  to be fine on paper but I do  not  think\r\n\r\nthat  some of those measures that will be taken could\r\n\r\nproduce the desired results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid further \"mistakes\" and in the light of\r\n\r\nwhat  I have already mentioned, Sir, I would like  to\r\n\r\nurge the Government to set up a Commission of Inquiry\r\n\r\nto  review the present Government educational policy.\r\n\r\nIts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontents and administration in all fields and to make\r\n\r\nrecommendations  to  the  Government.  I  feel   very\r\n\r\nstrongly, Sir, that whilst we have done very well  in\r\n\r\nthe  field of technical and vocational education, the\r\n\r\nimplementation of our bilingual policy and the method\r\n\r\nof  second  language  teaching and  learning  need  a\r\n\r\nthorough study and, if need be, a general overhaul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have tried to be both critical and\r\n\r\nconstructive.  I hope my comments will  not  fall  on\r\n\r\ndeaf ears - as so many comments on education have  in\r\n\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon.
