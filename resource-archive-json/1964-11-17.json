I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  remind all that T.V. programmes  have  a  great\r\n\r\ninfluence   on  the  morals  of  our  people  and   our   future\r\n\r\ngenerations,  and  will  affect  our  future  trends.  With  the\r\n\r\nextension of television services, more and more of the  audience\r\n\r\nwill  be influenced by the programmes. Most of the audience  are\r\n\r\nyoung boys and girls who cannot think and decide for themselves.\r\n\r\nThey are still not matured and are wont to imitate what they see\r\n\r\nand hear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since television has an immediate effect on the lives of the\r\n\r\naudience,  we  should  not  under-estimate  the  effect  of  its\r\n\r\nfunction on the minds of the people. We should consider  whether\r\n\r\nwe want to educate them into good citizens or into bad citizens,\r\n\r\nlike  rogues. We want to educate our children to be  law-abiding\r\n\r\ncitizens  with a high moral sense. Or do we want  to  make  them\r\n\r\ninto people who imitate the ways of cowboys and Western rascals?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents have raised criticisms about this and have expressed to\r\n\r\nme that they have no confidence in the future of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnext  generation because of the influence of T.V. on  them.  Now\r\n\r\nthat  T.V. is an added entertainment, it further increases  the\r\n\r\nworries  of  parents because, after viewing  the  programmes  on\r\n\r\nmurder,  arson,  and robbery, their children  will  imitate  the\r\n\r\nvillains or heroes of the films, thus affecting the conduct  and\r\n\r\ncharacter of the children, who will become lax in their studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what we regret most is that the Government\r\n\r\nhas  not censored evil films which are detrimental to the mental\r\n\r\nattitude of the audience. If we describe all the T.V. programmes\r\n\r\nas  bad, it will not be justified, because there are also useful\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  But  here  I would like to raise  a  question:  why\r\n\r\nshould  bad  films  which are detrimental to  the  thinking  and\r\n\r\nmental  attitude  of our future generation be  mixed  with  good\r\n\r\nfilms?  Does it mean that there are no healthy programmes  which\r\n\r\nhave  both an educational and amusement value? Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nyellow  culture is detrimental to our mentality and our thinking\r\n\r\nbecause  it makes us degenerate to a great extent. For instance,\r\n\r\nthe  detective  stories appearing on T.V. stress  the  theme  of\r\n\r\nrevenge  by  heroes.  These stories are  filled  with  fighting,\r\n\r\nrogues, villains, robberies, and things like that. Superficially\r\n\r\nthe  theme  of the whole film may be right, but the actual  film\r\n\r\nwill cause the people to degenerate. The villains and heroes  of\r\n\r\nWesterns  and  detective  stories are worshipped  by  the  young\r\n\r\naudience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, apart from this, we also see certain filthy\r\n\r\nfilms  on  comedy. These films are not really humorous  but  are\r\n\r\njust  travesties which perhaps might be liked by Western people.\r\n\r\nBut to the people of the East, these films are not suitable.  It\r\n\r\nis  not  that we strongly oppose such films. What we  oppose  is\r\n\r\nsuch  films that will drive our young people to hysteria.  These\r\n\r\nfilms  are  films prevailing in the West and depict Rock-n-Roll,\r\n\r\nthe Twist and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has promised to wipe out yellow\r\n\r\nculture. I would urge it to do so. Let us remember that in 1959,\r\n\r\nwhen the P.A.P. assumed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noffice,  juke boxes and filthy music were banned. But today  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government is allowing more and even worse yellow culture\r\n\r\nto  intoxicate our innocent youths. We hope the Government  will\r\n\r\ntake in more healthy films both from abroad and locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to appeal to the Government to see\r\n\r\nthat the T.V. programmes, no matter how good or bad they may be,\r\n\r\nshould  be  thoroughly scrutinised and investigated.  It  should\r\n\r\nseek opinions from cultural and educational organisations. There\r\n\r\nshould  be a Review Committee set up composed of representatives\r\n\r\nfrom  these  organisations  to review the  programmes.  Personal\r\n\r\nfeelings  and  likes or dislikes should not be the criteria  for\r\n\r\nsuch a review of T.V. programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, newspapers, for instance, like the Utusan\r\n\r\nMelayu  and the Berita Harian used to print criticisms  levelled\r\n\r\nby  religious and cultural bodies against the Twist and  \r\n\r\nRock-n-Roll films on T.V. We should not ignore such criticisms. Here  I\r\n\r\nwould advise the leadership of the Government to think well  for\r\n\r\nthe future generation, to stop yellow programmes on T.V., and to\r\n\r\nallow  more healthy programmes which are more beneficial to  the\r\n\r\npeople as a whole to be shown, and not to spend public funds  on\r\n\r\npublicity  and  propaganda for the Party in power.  They  should\r\n\r\nintroduce programmes which are of an educational nature and of a\r\n\r\nhigh  standard. They should not try to economise at the  expense\r\n\r\nof the quality of the films.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P.

We are very surprised that  the  standard  of\r\n\r\nculture in Singapore is getting lower and lower. We can  see  in\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers nowadays that night clubs have come out into the\r\n\r\nopen and have made a lot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof publicity in the newspapers. As Members must have read in the\r\n\r\nnewspapers, there was a fight over some girls at a certain night\r\n\r\nclub.  I  do not know what the Government's attitude is  towards\r\n\r\nthis  incident. I hope it will curb this kind of activities  and\r\n\r\nnot allow them to spread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some healthy cultural societies, I would like to point out to\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  put up certain items at the Victoria  Memorial\r\n\r\nHall.  They were branded as yellow culture. The curtain suddenly\r\n\r\ndescended.  I  was told that the police finally  cancelled  some\r\n\r\nitems  in  their programme. That forced the show to  come  to  a\r\n\r\nsudden  stop. This cultural body was putting up a  show  at  the\r\n\r\nVictorial Memorial Hall. We can see the magazine of this musical\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on T.V. programmes. Not on night life and\r\n\r\nrestaurants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, I wish to speak up to this point only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, television is\r\n\r\nrather  a  new  achievement.  As  far  as  Asian  nations, are\r\n\r\nconcerned, only a few are able to introduce T.V. But we are  one\r\n\r\nof  the pioneer nations in South-East Asia to make use of it for\r\n\r\neducational  as  well  as entertainment  purposes.  It  is  very\r\n\r\namusing indeed to watch the Barisan Sosialis stand up and accuse\r\n\r\nthe   Party  in  power  of  allegedly  abusing  T.V. for  party\r\n\r\npropaganda.  If there were one iota of truth in it,  the  public\r\n\r\nwould not clamour for more T.V. programmes and more T.V. sets. A\r\n\r\ncasual glance at the statistics available at T.V. dealers' shops\r\n\r\nin  Singapore clearly indicates that day by day more orders  are\r\n\r\nplaced  for  T.V. sets and that practically every  middle-class\r\n\r\nhome  in  Singapore  has  one T.V. set in  order  to  enjoy  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes presented by responsible men from  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof Culture. In other words, the programmes presented to the  public\r\n\r\nthrough the medium of T.V. have become very popular. It has been\r\n\r\nrealised  by  one and all that the P.A.P. has succeeded  in  its\r\n\r\nattempt to provide entertainment and educational programmes  of\r\n\r\na high\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncalibre to the masses in Singapore. Further, foreign dignitaries\r\n\r\nwho  have  had  the  opportunity to visit our T.V. studio  have\r\n\r\nappreciated the excellent standards maintained in Singapore. The\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, of course, will refuse to believe it, because\r\n\r\nit is difficult to educate the uneducable. Since they are living\r\n\r\nin  a  state  of mind of their own creation, I fully  sympathise\r\n\r\nwith them, but I request them to wake up even at this late hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Bukit Merah is\r\n\r\nthe  most  reasonable man of the lot in front of us, because,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  he  is a bit more intelligent than some of his  comrades\r\n\r\nwho  do not know what they are talking about and where they  are\r\n\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, unfortunately it is difficult to answer him because\r\n\r\nhe was talking in platitudes. As you know, Sir, it is difficult\r\n\r\nto answer platitudes. I agree with him that T.V. programmes\r\n\r\nshould be good; T.V. programmes should be healthy. They should\r\n\r\nbe less yellow. But having agreed with him now, it is up to him\r\n\r\nto tell us what programmes he considers unhealthy, what\r\n\r\nprogrammes he considers yellow; and what does he mean by saying,\r\n\r\nfor example, that there is too much fighting; there are heroes;\r\n\r\nthere are villains, there are robberies depicted in films. Sir,\r\n\r\nI have seen what they would call progressive films - Soviet\r\n\r\nfilms, Chinese films from New China - and they show heroes and\r\n\r\nvillains fighting against Japanese invaders. I remember there\r\n\r\nwas a traitor called Wang Chingwei. He was trying to betray his\r\n\r\ncountry to the Japanese. I have seen a film where these national\r\n\r\ntraitors were depicted as villains, and the revolutionary forces\r\n\r\nwere depicted as heroes. The average cinema-goer would identify\r\n\r\nhimself with the patriots, the people who defend their country\r\n\r\nagainst traitors and villains, against robbers and purveyors of\r\n\r\nviolence. Sir, in any film and in any novel, any art form, these\r\n\r\nthings have been depicted. You cannot produce a good film or a\r\n\r\ngood novel or a good play without showing the various aspects of\r\n\r\nhuman nature - villainy, thuggery, treason, unpatriotism. These\r\n\r\nare depicted as bad forces contending with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore progressive forces like heroism, patriotism and virtue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, it is difficult to answer the Member for\r\n\r\nBukit Merah until he indicates what particular programme and what\r\n\r\nparticular film or series of films are bad. For example, he says\r\n\r\nthat detective stories are no good. A few weeks ago somebody sent\r\n\r\nme a list of translations of popular authors in the Soviet Union\r\n\r\n- Agatha Christie is a popular writer. Her works have been\r\n\r\ntranslated into Russian. There are good detective stories and bad\r\n\r\ndetective stories. Detective stories in themselves are not bad.\r\n\r\nBut if a detective story glorifies murder, and if it is shown,\r\n\r\nand if the Member for Bukit Merah can point out such a film, then\r\n\r\nI will rectify the matter. I myself am concerned that some of the\r\n\r\nfilms do show too much violence. With that end in view, we have\r\n\r\ntransferred censorship of T.V. films to the Film Censors. They\r\n\r\nare a group of people who are experts in censoring films with a\r\n\r\nview to seeing that morals are not lowered. They are also experts\r\n\r\nat detecting subversive propaganda which may get into some of the\r\n\r\nT.V. films. I believe this censorship job has already been\r\n\r\ntransferred to the Film Censors. I have seen them, and I think\r\n\r\nthey do portray too much of violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan object to cowboy films. But I am told that even\r\n\r\nprogressive people view the cowboy as a folk hero. He is of the\r\n\r\npeople. He is not of the ruling class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a cattleman, a peasant. So you are glorifying a man\r\n\r\nwho fights against oppression, against villainy, against people\r\n\r\nwho do not respect law and order. Most of the Western films show\r\n\r\nthe cowboy as the man who stands up for law and order, not people\r\n\r\nwho want to break law and order and then get into trouble.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Sir, I agree with the platitudes expressed by the\r\n\r\nMember for Bukit Merah. But unless he specifies his grievances,\r\n\r\nit will be a bit difficult to answer him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Tampines, I do not know whether the\r\n\r\nassociation he has been talking about is the same association\r\n\r\nthat I have in mind - that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe ruled out some of the programmes\r\n\r\n- healthy programmes as he calls them - put forward by a certain\r\n\r\ncultural  organisation. It was in connection with the  Keng  Leh\r\n\r\nMusical  Association, I remember, Sir, that  that  incident  did\r\n\r\ncome up. They were putting in Communist items, and therefore  we\r\n\r\nstruck  them  off.  They were trying to sneak  them  into  their\r\n\r\nprogramme. So their souvenir programmes were withdrawn. When  an\r\n\r\nassociation applies to the Ministry to put up a show, and if  it\r\n\r\ngives certain guarantees that it is not going to transgress  the\r\n\r\nlaw,  then  it should adhere to its undertaking and not  try  to\r\n\r\nsneak  in a few items in the hope that people, either the police\r\n\r\nor   whoever  goes  and  sees  the  show,  will  overlook  them.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  Sir, I hope that the Barisan Sosialis  Members  will\r\n\r\nview some of the T.V. films which do teach two things - respect\r\n\r\nfor law and order and respect for truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, first of\r\n\r\nall,  I  would like to thank the Minister for Culture. He should\r\n\r\nnot  be  so courteous and, at the same time, sarcastic. We  have\r\n\r\nraised  these  questions because it is the  right  and  duty  of\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members  to do so. We want to offer  the  Government\r\n\r\nsome  food  for thought, to consider which films  are  good  and\r\n\r\nwhich  are bad. I have also said that the merits or demerits  of\r\n\r\nthe  films  should he reviewed by a Censors Board or committee.\r\n\r\nBut  if  the  Minister for Culture wants me to pinpoint  certain\r\n\r\nprogrammes as bad or good, then I will mention them. They are my\r\n\r\npersonal  views.  The Minister for Culture has  said  that  some\r\n\r\ndetective  films are very good. I do not deny that. But  in  our\r\n\r\nT.V. programmes every week, there are too many detective films.\r\n\r\nLet  us  just open this Chinese copy of T.V. and Radio Magazine.\r\n\r\nOn Monday there is a Hitchcock detective --- \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Could the Member identify the document from which\r\n\r\nhe is reading?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, T.V. and\r\n\r\nRadio,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublished  by  Radio  Singapore  Broadcasting  Department.  On\r\n\r\nTuesday,  there  is again a detective story  on  Channel  8.  On\r\n\r\nWednesday, there is Perry Mason, a detective film. On  Thursday,\r\n\r\nanother  detective story. On Friday there is none. On  Saturday,\r\n\r\non  Channel  8,  \"77 Sunset Strip\". On Sunday another  detective\r\n\r\nstory - The Case of the Kiss. I think there are too many detective\r\n\r\nfilms. The scenes will be mostly fighting and violence. I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  this is not too good. As to what good films should he used\r\n\r\nto  replace  them,  I  would suggest that,  for  instance,  last\r\n\r\nSaturday, there was a French film, \"The Beauty and the Beast\". I\r\n\r\nthink  the Minister for Culture should try to introduce more  of\r\n\r\nsuch films.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to refer to what the Minister for Culture has\r\n\r\nsaid,  that fighting might not be necessarily bad, and that  war\r\n\r\nmight not he necessarily bad. But we should see what kind of war\r\n\r\nor  fighting  it is. What is the use of fighting over  women  or\r\n\r\nusing violence in robbery? We should see for what purpose  that\r\n\r\nwar  or fighting is staged. I do not oppose the type of fighting\r\n\r\nor  war on T.V. programmes depicting the Second World War  which\r\n\r\nis  more  serious than the cowboy type. Such fighting  scenes  I\r\n\r\nthink I may welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the judging of whether a film is good or had\r\n\r\nshould not he based on personal criteria. Since the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture wants me to give some definite examples, that is why  I\r\n\r\nam giving him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ready now?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nsay  a  few  words  about T.V. programmes.  They  have  a  great\r\n\r\ninfluence on the people of Singapore. The Minister for Education\r\n\r\nhas  not studied this problem. Therefore, he is ignorant of  the\r\n\r\neffects of T.V. programmes on the pupils' studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Minister for Culture has asked us to suggest some\r\n\r\ngood films and programmes. I can give a few examples. There  are\r\n\r\ncertain Filipino fighting films. The hero dresses like a cowboy,\r\n\r\nbut wears drainpipe trousers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe fights over women and is involved in robbery or kidnapping.\r\n\r\nThis  kind of a story or theme is a burden to our society.  That\r\n\r\nit  should appear on T.V. may be beneficial to the Minister,  but\r\n\r\nit is not beneficial to the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another type of fighting pictures are those from America. Most\r\n\r\nof these pictures depict how the Americans fight against the Red\r\n\r\nIndians and glorify the white people. There is a strong note  of\r\n\r\nracialism  in  these  pictures.  There  is  also  discrimination\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Red Indians. These pictures are not good  at  all.\r\n\r\nThey are no good to our younger generation and to those who want\r\n\r\nentertainment, because they have always depicted  the  Americans\r\n\r\nas  heroes. One shot from their gun can kill two people, whereas\r\n\r\nthe  Red Indians cannot kill any person with even 10 shots. This\r\n\r\nis  an  insult  to  the Red Indians and to the coloured  people.\r\n\r\nThese  so-called hero pictures are no good at all. After  giving\r\n\r\nthese examples, I hope the Minister will review these programmes\r\n\r\nand not talk about Russian and Chinese stories and pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, as regards the cowboy, I have seen Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  shows,  Communist shows, with Chinese  dressed  up  as\r\n\r\nCossacks.  Sir,  there is nothing wrong if a Filipino  wants  to\r\n\r\ndress  up as a cowboy. In fact, they will be interested to  know\r\n\r\nthat in Malaysia we have cowboys. In Sabah there are cowboys who\r\n\r\nare dressed in - what are they called?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Bajaus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Bajaus. Surely, Sir, they are not going to\r\n\r\ninsult  them by saying that they should not adopt a dress  which\r\n\r\nis  really  Spanish. There is nothing wrong in that. It  is  not\r\n\r\nwhether  a  Filipino dressed up as a cowboy is bad, but  whether\r\n\r\nthe  film  itself is bad. There is one valid point on which  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson did make representation, and that  is  that\r\n\r\nthey show Western films where the Red Indians\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  shown as savages. In fact, there are one or two such films.\r\n\r\nInstructions have been given not to show Western films depicting\r\n\r\nthe Red Indians as barbaric and backward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this apart, Sir, the Member says that a detective film is\r\n\r\nshown  practically every day. But that is not the point.  Is  he\r\n\r\nobjecting to good films being shown every day? Is the detective\r\n\r\nfilm  bad  or  good? The moral is quite clear  in  many  of  the\r\n\r\nHitchcock films which we show. That crime does not pay. You  can\r\n\r\nsay  there is too much love drama every day, because most  films\r\n\r\ndeal  with very basic themes, like crime or love or humour. They\r\n\r\nsay.  \"I  do  not like it. There is a humorous film  every  day.\r\n\r\nTherefore, out with it.\" The point is whether that film is  good\r\n\r\nor  bad. In fact, about six months ago we withdrew two detective\r\n\r\nseries.  There were complaints. I think \"The Saint\"  series  has\r\n\r\nrecently come off because our contract has expired. People  have\r\n\r\nbeen  writing  in,  asking.  \"Why has  my  film  programme  been\r\n\r\nwithdrawn?\"  Sir, in a T.V. programme running for  six  hours  a\r\n\r\nday,  we  must  plan  programmes with a view to  satisfying  the\r\n\r\nunsophisticated as well as the Member for Bukit Merah who  likes\r\n\r\n\"The  Beauty  and the Beast\". This film is a very  sophisticated\r\n\r\none  and would not be appreciated by more than a minority of the\r\n\r\naudience. We have to satisfy everybody. Some people like  cowboy\r\n\r\nfilms,  some like cartoons, some like news, some like  comedies.\r\n\r\nSo  we  have to plan out a programme each day. We have a  little\r\n\r\nbit  of  everything. Some people like detective stories,  so  we\r\n\r\nplan to provide four or five a week. Some people like humour, so\r\n\r\nwe provide that too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we see that the Member's objection is not that detective\r\n\r\nfilms are bad. At least he has not said so. He says there  is  a\r\n\r\ndetective  film almost every day. But some people like detective\r\n\r\nstories and, therefore, we have to satisfy all tastes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions on the amendments put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 he reduced by the\r\n\r\nwhole sum in respect of subhead 1331.*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Lim Huan Boon.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, no matter how the Minister for Culture wants\r\n\r\nto  argue, the fact remains that his Ministry is not fair in its\r\n\r\ntreatment  of  news. I would like to state one  example  of  the\r\n\r\nbiased  treatment of news over the radio and on T.V. An  obvious\r\n\r\nexample  is  the Assembly which deals with the problems  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  and which is the only place where the Opposition Parties\r\n\r\ncan  criticise the Government. The proceedings of every Assembly\r\n\r\nsitting are specially broadcast over the radio. But how does the\r\n\r\nGovernment  go  about it? The Ministers and their  Back-benchers\r\n\r\nget more coverage of their speeches than the Opposition Parties.\r\n\r\nSometimes  the Opposition Parties do not get any radio  coverage\r\n\r\nof  their  speeches in the Assembly. The people are  anxious  to\r\n\r\nknow  how the struggle is carried on in this House, and in order\r\n\r\nto   enable  them  to  have  confidence  in  the  constitutional\r\n\r\nstruggle,  they have a right to know what is actually  happening\r\n\r\nin  this  House. The reports of the proceedings  of  this  House\r\n\r\nshould  not  be prejudiced against the Opposition Parties  whose\r\n\r\nspeeches  are  not  reported over the radio.  It  is  only  when\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members are accused by the Ministers that  they  are\r\n\r\nmentioned  in  the reports. There have been occasions  when  the\r\n\r\nnews  was distorted in an attempt to lessen the time of coverage\r\n\r\nof  the speeches of the Opposition, such as reporting fictitiously  that  the Opposition Parties were so stunned by a Minister's\r\n\r\ncounter-attack that they did not know what to answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the reporting of news over the radio and on T.V.\r\n\r\nshould not be made to serve the purpose of the Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not\r\n\r\ngoing to speak on the other amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, it is curious how one can anticipate\r\n\r\nprecisely the complaints that the Barisan Sosialis will bring up\r\n\r\non any issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard that the News Section was going to be discussed\r\n\r\ntoday,  my feeling was that the Barisan Sosialis were  going  to\r\n\r\nbring up the complaint that the Opposition do not get fair play.\r\n\r\nSo  in order to provide myself with an answer, I asked the  News\r\n\r\nSection to find out for me how much of the time was given to the\r\n\r\nOpposition  and  to the Government Benches since  the  last  few\r\n\r\nAssembly  sittings began. The Barisan Members are only seven  in\r\n\r\nnumber  and mathematically they should be getting less coverage.\r\n\r\nBut according to the News Section, for example, on 4th November,\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  were  given 105 lines and the  Government  were\r\n\r\ngiven  76  lines.  On 5th November, the Barisan  were  given  60\r\n\r\nlines. On 12th November, the Opposition were given 142 lines and\r\n\r\nthe Government were given 68 lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the news period is about ten minutes. We have to get not\r\n\r\nonly  the  proceedings of this Assembly into  the-news  bulletin\r\n\r\nbut,  more  important, news of what Soekarno is going  to  \r\n\r\ndo  - whether  his boys are coming to blow up this place as  they  did\r\n\r\nyesterday. This is also important news, and the people  want  to\r\n\r\nhear  it  too. So we have to apportion the news time. It depends\r\n\r\non  what  the  Opposition  say. The News  Section  have  trained\r\n\r\nnewsmen; they judge. They do not report somebody just because he\r\n\r\nhas spoken. They report people if they have something to say. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has complained of distortion in last\r\n\r\nnight's  news  because one of the reports did mention  that  the\r\n\r\nOpposition Members were too stunned to reply to a question  that\r\n\r\nI  asked. I have the transcript, Sir, It is factual and accurate\r\n\r\nreporting. Yesterday I asked the Barisan to name one book  which\r\n\r\nthey thought was healthy literature and which had been banned. I\r\n\r\nam  quite prepared to run through the transcript. There  was  no\r\n\r\nreply. Therefore, any news reporter would say,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well,  a  pointed  question was asked to  which  there  was  no\r\n\r\nreply.\" How can that be distortion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I suggest that if Members want to get a little more\r\n\r\ntime  over  the  radio  or on T.V., they  should  say  something\r\n\r\ninteresting, something to catch the eye of the newsmen, and  not\r\n\r\nrepeat  things which they have been saying for the last  two  or\r\n\r\nthree  years. The newsmen will also get tired and they will  say\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  no use reporting them on T.V. because the  Barisan\r\n\r\nfurther complain that the television programmes are dull.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture has said that the  News  Section  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Culture has reported fairly and justly the  proceed\r\n\r\nings of the Assembly. In fact, when people compare the T.V. news\r\n\r\nreport  on the proceedings of the Assembly and what they see  in\r\n\r\nthe Chinese newspapers, they know that there is a certain amount\r\n\r\nof  bias.  The  reports in the Chinese newspapers are  different\r\n\r\nfrom  those  put  over  the  radio.  On  T.V. the  reports  are\r\n\r\npolitically biased in favour of the Government. Our suggestions,\r\n\r\nrefutations and strong points in the debates are not  broadcast,\r\n\r\nwhereas the speeches of the Government Members are reported. The\r\n\r\nGovernment's weak points which come under fire from us  are  not\r\n\r\nbroadcast, so that the people do not know anything about them at\r\n\r\nall.  The  Government  talk  about the  apportionment  of  time.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Opposition Members are few in number, they speak on\r\n\r\nfacts.  It is not fair to compare the time with the contents  of\r\n\r\nspeeches.

In other words, all the Government Back-Benchers\r\n\r\nare dumb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that Budget time is more or less\r\n\r\nreferred to as Opposition time. This is the time when Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers  make concrete and constructive criticisms  against  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  so that the Government can rectify its mistakes,  if\r\n\r\nthere  are  any.  Instead,  the seven Barisan.  Members  on  the\r\n\r\nOpposition   side  have  talked  nonsense  without  making   any\r\n\r\nworthwhile criticisms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, Mr Speaker, I would refer to what the Member\r\n\r\nfor Thomson has alleged - that news over the radio and on T.V.\r\n\r\nwas distorted and that it was more or less biased. But as the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture has pointed out, in its ten minutes of\r\n\r\nreport on the proceedings in the Legislative Assembly, they have\r\n\r\ngot to give a wide coverage and they have to summarise the whole\r\n\r\nproceedings in just under ten minutes. So these reporters know\r\n\r\nwhat their job is. Those points worth bringing home to the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore will be given coverage. And no absolute\r\n\r\nfalsehoods uttered will be carried because they are not\r\n\r\nconstructive criticisms - one Opposition Member after another\r\n\r\naccusing Government of this and that. Well, you do not expect\r\n\r\npeople to just waste their time listening to the news. What is\r\n\r\nthe news for? That is the most important programme, when people\r\n\r\nwill be informed not only of what is happening around them but\r\n\r\nin the whole world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has also said that the Chinese newspapers\r\n\r\nhave given them wide coverage in their daily reports on the\r\n\r\nproceedings of the Assembly. But the Chinese newspapers are not\r\n\r\nin the hands of the State Government. We are not controlling\r\n\r\nthem. It is up to them to publish whatever Members opposite\r\n\r\ntalked for publication in the Chinese newspapers. They have\r\n\r\nenough space. That is the point I am trying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  bring  home - that the Back-benchers of the Government  side\r\n\r\nare  not  just sitting clown here keeping quiet, hut are  giving\r\n\r\nthem  time  to make their constructive and well-supported  criticisms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, from what the\r\n\r\nMember  has just said, we can find out the faulty points of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, especially when they themselves have disclosed them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Member for Punggol has said just now that Budget\r\n\r\ntime  is the time for the Opposition to air their views.  We  on\r\n\r\nthis   side  have  been  trying  to  air  our  suggestions   and\r\n\r\ncriticisms,  but  the Minister for Culture has said  that  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  a  certain ratio in giving coverage to  speeches  of\r\n\r\nMembers on both sides of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as to the point whether there is any value in what we\r\n\r\nsay in this House, who should be the judge to say whether the\r\n\r\npoints we raise in this House are of any news value? Is it for\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Culture to decide, or is it for the audience to\r\n\r\ndecide? Speeches made by Opposition Members are not liked by the\r\n\r\nMinister. So it will be most unfair for the Minister to judge\r\n\r\nour speeches. I would ask him what he considers valuable? When\r\n\r\never he opens his mouth, he says \"Marxism\" and \"Communists\". And\r\n\r\nif we were to talk about these things, we would only be wasting\r\n\r\nthe time of this House. So are we going to utter\r\n\r\nsuch mad talk or even to emulate him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another very important point. Just now the Member for\r\n\r\nPunggol has said that Chinese newspapers are not under the\r\n\r\ncontrol of the State Government. So they can report at random,\r\n\r\nand even report unnecessarily.

Mr Koo Young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you. Mr Speaker. This will\r\n\r\nmake us look at the picture more clearly - that whatever they\r\n\r\ncan control, they will suppress the reporting. When they cannot\r\n\r\ncontrol the Chinese newspapers, when reporting in the Chinese\r\n\r\nnewspapers gives more coverage, then they become fussy and say\r\n\r\nthat they report haphazardly. So from this we can clearly see\r\n\r\nthe picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the points raised was,\r\n\r\n\"Well,  look  at the Chinese papers. They give more coverage  to\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition Members than does the radio or T.V.\" As  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  over the radio, at the most the regular news bulletin  on\r\n\r\nthe  whole proceedings of the Legislative Assembly may  take  no\r\n\r\nmore than five minutes. And that would mean perhaps no more than\r\n\r\n300 or 400 lines. If we give the same coverage as newspapers, it\r\n\r\nwill  probably  take half an hour or even three-quarters  of  an\r\n\r\nhour.  So  the  problem over the radio or on T.V. is  the  time\r\n\r\nfactor  -  how  to  condense  the  essentials  -  not  only  the\r\n\r\nessentials but things of interest to the public - within  a  few\r\n\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they have said is true, Sir, - that one of my colleagues\r\n\r\nhas  revealed  that  the Chinese newspapers are  not  under  our\r\n\r\ncontrol. And they took it up. Yet from time to time they keep on\r\n\r\nsaying that we control Chinese\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnewspapers.  Now at last they admit that Chinese newspapers  are\r\n\r\nnot  controlled. I think it was the Member for Thomson who  took\r\n\r\nup  this point saying, \"There you are. You see, we can get  more\r\n\r\nspace  in  Chinese  newspapers because the Government  does  not\r\n\r\ncontrol  them  but the radio.\" That is true, we do  control  the\r\n\r\nradio  and  television. We are the Government. I ask them:  they\r\n\r\ncontrol  the Barisan newspaper. What is it called? The Plebeian?\r\n\r\nNo,  the  Barisan Express, which is supposed to be  running  non-stop.  Will  they publish Dr Lee Siew Choh's reply to  them  in\r\n\r\ntheir  newspaper?  They  are controlling  their  newspaper  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, they have the perfect right not to publish Dr  Lee's\r\n\r\nreply.   And  Dr  Lee  has  been  complaining  that  they   are\r\n\r\nundemocratic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if they really want to know how to catch the headlines of\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers  or  over the radio, I will  give  them  a  good\r\n\r\ninstance  of  how  to  do it. Say something  sensible,  and  say\r\n\r\nsomething that catches the eye of the public. For example,  Sir,\r\n\r\nin  today's newspapers we know that the police are still hunting\r\n\r\nfor  Indonesian infiltrators - people who come here with \r\n\r\nhand-grenades, tommy guns and sten guns, not to kill Indonesians  but\r\n\r\nto kill our people. If the Barisan come out tomorrow and make  a\r\n\r\nstatement  that they condemn it, then I am quite sure they  will\r\n\r\ncatch  the headlines of every newspaper. That is the way to  get\r\n\r\nyour views published in newspapers, over the radio, on T.V. and\r\n\r\neven  over Radio Indonesia. In fact, Sir, I have looked  at  the\r\n\r\nMonitoring Digest of 14th November. It contains a report on  the\r\n\r\nproceedings of the debates here. There is great prominence given\r\n\r\nto  the Barisan Sosialis. It does mention one thing that is very\r\n\r\ninteresting:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In Malaysia our agents report ---`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Our agents\" these are the gentlemen, Sir [indicating].\r\n\r\nFortunately  for  them,  we  have done  them  a  favour  by  not\r\n\r\nreproducing  this over our radio. Therefore, they  should  learn\r\n\r\nthat  newsmen are always obliging. They want a good  story,  and\r\n\r\nthey  can get a good story tomorrow if the Barisan come out  and\r\n\r\nsay they condemn the Indonesian\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninfiltrators who come here with hand-grenades and tommy guns  to\r\n\r\nkill  our people. If they say that, Sir, the newsmen will  black\r\n\r\nout  every  other item of news, even the Budget  proceedings  in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly, and give them space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, what we have\r\n\r\nbeen  talking  about  is  the  coverage  given  by  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  which is quite extensive compared to  the  coverage\r\n\r\ngiven  by T.V. and the radio. We do not say how many lines  T.V.\r\n\r\nor  the radio has given or how many lines have been given in the\r\n\r\nPress.  We  are not talking about that. We are also not  talking\r\n\r\nabout other things. What we say is that the radio and T.V. have\r\n\r\ngiven  more  publicity to the speeches made  by  the  Government\r\n\r\nside. In spite of this, the Chinese newspapers are influenced by\r\n\r\nthe  Government to a certain extent. As to the inside  story  of\r\n\r\nthis  state of affairs, I think the Minister for Culture is most\r\n\r\naware  and  clear  about.  After  comparing  the  difference  in\r\n\r\ncoverage  between the radio and T.V. and the Chinese newspapers,\r\n\r\nwe  can  also look to the Hansard of these proceedings and  find\r\n\r\nthat  even the Chinese newspapers are not reporting as much  and\r\n\r\nas  accurately  as  what is reported in the Official  Report.  I\r\n\r\nthink this phenomenon can be well understood by the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture. He is the only person to understand what is the  reason\r\n\r\nfor this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, many of our speeches made in this House were not\r\n\r\npublished in the Press. Even the Member for Jalan Kayu  and  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Bukit  Merah did not have many  of  their  speeches\r\n\r\nreported.  From this I think that perhaps this has something  to\r\n\r\ndo  with the influence of the Ministry of Culture or the Special\r\n\r\nBranch.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banck-benchers on the Government side have been asking us\r\n\r\nwhether  we  will report the material supplied by Dr  Lee  Siew\r\n\r\nChoh. What we want to say is that T.V. and the radio are run  on\r\n\r\npublic funds, and they should report fairly. We do not ask  that\r\n\r\nour speeches be given full coverage in their P.A.P. organ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they are not prepared to give us any coverage on anything we\r\n\r\nsay,  in  other words, if they want to silence us, they  are  at\r\n\r\nliberty  to  do so. If they wish to resort to such  action,  let\r\n\r\nthem  do  so. The Government Ministers, especially the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Culture,  are  wont  to  shout  about  \"Communism\", \r\n\r\n\"pro-Indonesia\",  and so on. They criticise us and harp on  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  we  are repeating old tunes. We have heard this  time  and\r\n\r\nagain  in  the  House. After uttering such words, the  Ministers\r\n\r\nwould  sit  down.  Their  speeches  would  then  appear  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers, over the radio and on T.V. As a result,  they  black\r\n\r\nout  the  speeches made by us in this House. When they use  such\r\n\r\ntactics, our speeches are not given a fair coverage. We are  now\r\n\r\nfaced with such a situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, following on what my\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Member for Punggol, has said, if you had allotted\r\n\r\nthe  time  in such a way that one Opposition speaker is followed\r\n\r\nby  one on the Government side, the Opposition Members would not\r\n\r\nhave so much time to repeat the same things over and over again.\r\n\r\nNot  every one of them would have a chance to speak, remembering\r\n\r\nthat there is a \"guillotine\" time for each amendment. As it  is,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, you are giving the Opposition Members  every\r\n\r\nopportunity  to have their say, and rightly so, because  it  is\r\n\r\nBudget time. Therefore, the Member for Jurong's reference to the\r\n\r\nGovernment Back-benchers as being dumb is most unfair.  If  they\r\n\r\nprefer  to  take turns, that is, one speaker from the Opposition\r\n\r\nis  followed  by one from the Government side, then  they  might\r\n\r\nlike to inform you, Mr Speaker.

Government controls all the media of news\r\n\r\nreporting. They are very clear about this. The people of\r\n\r\nSingapore know this very well. In debating the Budget today, we\r\n\r\nhave criticised the inappropriate manner in which the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave handled the radio and T.V. in reporting news. We are\r\n\r\nspeaking on behalf of the people. We hope that our criticism\r\n\r\nwill be adequately aired over the radio. This is our\r\n\r\nresponsibility. I can give a very simple example. One night last\r\n\r\nweek, the Member for Paya Lebar spoke during the adjournment\r\n\r\ndebate, and during an adjournment debate there should not be any\r\n\r\nargument. The radio has transgressed the rules of this House. It\r\n\r\nhas confused the people. This mishandling by the radio is not\r\n\r\ngood. For example, there is a controversy between China and the\r\n\r\nSoviet Union. In order to maintain their policies, the\r\n\r\nrespective countries do not allow their people to tune in to\r\n\r\nforeign stations. We hope that the radio in Singapore will give\r\n\r\na fair coverage of the proceedings here. This will enable the\r\n\r\npeople to understand fully the actual situation in Singapore.\r\n\r\nOur arguments with the P.A.P. involve issues which are connected\r\n\r\nwith the people's livelihood; for example, the issue of merger.\r\n\r\nWe want our views to be judged by the people. It is the only\r\n\r\ncorrect thing for us to do. I hope that the P.A.P. will be fair\r\n\r\nin its news reporting. The radio has not been fair at all in the\r\n\r\ncoverage of news.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has talked about the difficulties of the\r\n\r\ncommercial  Press. We have had sittings for a whole week.  There\r\n\r\nis  not much news in the Press. We feel that the speeches reported  in  the newspapers are quite fair. But what we want is  that\r\n\r\nall  the views expressed from this side and front the Government\r\n\r\nside  should be aired and presented to the people. I  hope  that\r\n\r\nthe Minister will do something to improve the position. What  we\r\n\r\nare saying here concerns the people's livelihood. If what we say\r\n\r\nis not correct, of course,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  will be judged by the people as such.

In fact, we allocate\r\n\r\nthe  radio  and  T.V. time  on  the  basis  of  the  number  of\r\n\r\nAssemblymen.  If  we are dictatorial and wish  to  suppress  the\r\n\r\nOpposition's  views,  then we should adopt  the  principle  that\r\n\r\nsince  we  are more in number we should be given more time.  The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister,  the  Finance Minister  and  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture  have  to  make important statements on  the  Indonesian\r\n\r\ninvasion and aggression, saboteurs, and so on. We should  inform\r\n\r\nthe people of this important news which is of national interest.\r\n\r\nWe  have not controlled the allocation of radio time. We  should\r\n\r\nhave  more time because we have over 30 Assemblymen on our side.\r\n\r\nBut as we are a democratic Government, we have sometimes allowed\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  more  radio time. Just now,  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture has mentioned the number of lines given to them over the\r\n\r\nradio.  This  shows  that  we have given  them  much  more  time\r\n\r\nalthough they are outnumbered by us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the news value of their statements, they have\r\n\r\nsaid  that  they  should  not  be judged  by  the  Ministers  or\r\n\r\nGovernment Assemblymen. They say that they should be  judged  by\r\n\r\nthe  people. If the people had supported them, they  would  have\r\n\r\nhad more seats in the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have pointed out Dr Lee Siew Choh as an example. As a\r\n\r\nmember  of the Barisan Sosialis, he should have been allowed  to\r\n\r\nput  forward  his views in his own Party organ. If there  is  no\r\n\r\ndemocracy  in  the Barisan Sosialis itself, how can  the  people\r\n\r\nexpect democracy --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is not democracy of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis that is under discussion. It is T.V. news. Let  us  get\r\n\r\nback to T.V. news.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b> remained in his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nin  democracy, everyone should be free to air his views. But  in\r\n\r\ntoday's debate, the Opposition have levelled only criticisms  at\r\n\r\nthe  Government. All this is quite in order. The Government will\r\n\r\nhave  to  consider and reply to the criticisms of the Opposition.\r\n\r\nThe  reply  from  every Minister responsible is a  matter  which\r\n\r\naffects the welfare of the public. Therefore, it is only  proper\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister's policy speeches are given wider  coverage.\r\n\r\nThe Barisan say that their speeches in this Assembly are for the\r\n\r\npublic to judge. I believe that you yourself, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nknow that the Leader of the Barisan Sosialis held the record for\r\n\r\nthe longest speech made in this Assembly. He spoke for more than\r\n\r\nseven  hours. If the speech, which lasted for seven  hours,  was\r\n\r\nmerely  to mention the weak points of the Government,  it  would\r\n\r\nhave  been  welcomed. But as a result of his speech lasting  for\r\n\r\nover  seven  hours, the Barisan Sosialis lost in the referendum!\r\n\r\nIt  is  the policy in any country that the time given to  report\r\n\r\nspeeches  over the radio is allotted according to the number  of\r\n\r\ncandidates in the Party. If there are many Members, more time is\r\n\r\nallowed  by the radio. The speeches of the Opposition  sometimes\r\n\r\nmake  no sense. On the other hand, every syllable uttered  by  a\r\n\r\nMinister is a matter of policy. It is important for the  welfare\r\n\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore important for the people to know exactly what\r\n\r\nthe  Government policy is. The Opposition should well understand\r\n\r\nthis point. As I have said earlier, they should be grateful that\r\n\r\ntheir criticisms do get ample coverage, unlike in Indonesia  and\r\n\r\nin Peking where the Opposition have no coverage at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to supplement my\r\n\r\nstatement  on  the News Section of the Ministry of  Culture.  By\r\n\r\nwhat  criteria does the Head of the News Section decide what  is\r\n\r\nto be reported and what is not to be reported to the people? Let\r\n\r\nthe people have full reports on what is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid here and let them decide whether there is anything of value\r\n\r\nor  not. The Ministry of Culture have admitted that in reporting\r\n\r\nthe  news they have the media of T.V. and radio. The purpose  of\r\n\r\nreporting  is  to propagate the publicity work of the  Party  in\r\n\r\npower;  they have admitted this. The speeches made by us contain\r\n\r\nimportant  points with regard to certain mistakes  made  by  the\r\n\r\nParty  in power but they are usually omitted by the Head of  the\r\n\r\nNews  Section.  I  have described just now the  attitude  to  be\r\n\r\nadopted in reporting our speeches made here. We should know that\r\n\r\nsuch  people  are getting salaries out of public funds  and  yet\r\n\r\nthey are doing work to benefit the P.A.P. which is the Party  in\r\n\r\npower.  The Assembly does not belong to the Party in power,  and\r\n\r\nthe  radio  and  T.V. are paid from public funds.  They  do  not\r\n\r\nbelong  to the P.A.P. Since the Assembly, T.V, and radio do  not\r\n\r\nbelong to the P.A.P. as the people have to pay for them and  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  the  existence of the Assembly is to  exercise  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic system, we say that such reporting is not in  keeping\r\n\r\nwith the spirit of democracy. Whatever the P.A.P. have said just\r\n\r\nnow  cannot  fool the people, because how we deal  with  matters\r\n\r\nconcerning  intra-party  democracy is  our  business.  What  the\r\n\r\nGovernment side has said about this can only cause laughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think they know what\r\n\r\nexactly they want, unless by fair report, they mean just  report\r\n\r\nBarisan speeches. Is that what they mean by fair report?  Or  as\r\n\r\nthe Member for Jurong has just suggested, report it in full.  We\r\n\r\nstart at 2.30 p.m, and finish at 8.00 p.m.; so it will take just\r\n\r\nas  long; that is practically the whole day's T.V. programme  to\r\n\r\nbe  given over to reporting the speeches from the Assembly. That\r\n\r\nis what I understood from the translation--- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh:</b> On a point of explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I was talking about the\r\n\r\nNews Section which deals with the reporting of our speeches. I\r\n\r\nnever mentioned that we should have reporting coverage of the\r\n\r\nfull proceedings from 2.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m., as suggested by\r\n\r\nthe Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> In other words, at least there should not be\r\n\r\nfull  coverage. Therefore, we must decide how much coverage  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  proceedings should get, and out of that, how much  the\r\n\r\nOpposition should get. So by and large, Sir, as I have said,  we\r\n\r\nhave  only  about  5 or 10 minutes, of which  probably  3  or  4\r\n\r\nminutes are devoted to Assembly proceedings. So by and large  it\r\n\r\nis  a  process of elimination. What is said from 2.30 p.m.to 8.30 p.m.\r\n\r\nhas to be drastically reduced to 3 or 4 minutes.  The\r\n\r\nNews  Editor  therefore decides. He has got  the  whole  report\r\n\r\nbefore  him and practically 95 per cent of it must be left  out.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  for Jalan Kayu complained, \"Oh, there  is  no  free\r\n\r\nspeech,  because  an adjournment speech by the Member  for  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar was not reported.\" But I can tell you. Sir, if that is the\r\n\r\nbasis,  then I say I am not getting free speech because  neither\r\n\r\nthe  Straits Times nor the Nanyang Siang Pau has today published\r\n\r\nwhat I said yesterday --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I said last week that the\r\n\r\nMember  for Paya Lebar spoke on the adjournment debate  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.

Now, this is not a controversial matter and there should not be any dispute  over  it.\r\n\r\nRadio  Singapore reported that after the Minister rebutted  what\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Paya Lebar had said, the Member for Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nwas  unable to give any reply to the Minister. That  is  what  I\r\n\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> That is not a clarification. That is a long\r\n\r\nspeech.  As  I  have  said earlier, I can  complain  that  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore  has been unfair to me, or that the Nanyang Siang  Pau\r\n\r\nand the Straits Times have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunfair  to me, just because they left out my speech. But I  know\r\n\r\nvery  well  that they have good reasons why they cannot  get  in\r\n\r\neverything  that is being said here. But sometimes  we  do  give\r\n\r\nfull  coverage, Sir, even for the Barisan, to the  exclusion  of\r\n\r\neverything else. We have done it from time to time. For example,\r\n\r\nSir,  on  12th  September, the Barisan were  going  to  stage  a\r\n\r\ndemonstration in favour of Indonesia in Chinatown.  We  gave  it\r\n\r\nwide publicity over the radio and on Television, saying that the\r\n\r\nBarisan  pro-Indonesian, pro-Communist elements  were  going  to\r\n\r\nhave a demonstration --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think the Members on the Opposite\r\n\r\nBench  were  complaining  of  that. They  complained  about  the\r\n\r\nreporting  of proceedings in the Assembly. Let us come  back  to\r\n\r\nthe reporting of proceedings in the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, again let me point out the\r\n\r\nunreasonableness of the Barisan. We can give an accurate  report\r\n\r\nof  what went on today and make the Member look a bit silly. All\r\n\r\nI have got to do is to ask the Head of the News Section tomorrow\r\n\r\nto  report  his speech complaining that there is no free  speech\r\n\r\nbecause  his speech is not reported. If it is reported  tomorrow\r\n\r\nin  the  7  o'clock  news, saying that the Member  for  Tampines\r\n\r\ncomplains  that there is no free speech in the Assembly  because\r\n\r\nhe is not being given adequate time over the radio, he will look\r\n\r\na  bit  foolish. Because then the people will say, \"How  foolish\r\n\r\ncan  a man get?\" He is being allowed to say and disprove himself\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  no  free speech, no fair reporting  over  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore because his speeches are not reported. If I  do  that,\r\n\r\ntomorrow, next time or next year, they will complain again  that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Culture has not been fair to them by  reporting\r\n\r\nit.  So,  therefore, Sir, these are matters of judgment.  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  them  that  I  do  not go after this  meeting  to  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore and sit down and tell the Head of the News Section  or\r\n\r\nthe  reporters  there what they should report of the  Opposition\r\n\r\nspeeches.  If they think it is interesting, if they  think  they\r\n\r\nhave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid something worthwhile, they will report it. But as everybody\r\n\r\nknows, not everything that they say - in fact, Sir, in my view as\r\n\r\na former newspaper man, probably 95 per cent of what they say is\r\n\r\nnot  worth reporting. I know why newspapers do not give adequate\r\n\r\ncoverage  to some of the Opposition speeches. If they  do  that,\r\n\r\nthey  will lose circulation because nobody is going to read  the\r\n\r\ntripe.  They  select, polish it up, sometimes  they  improve  on\r\n\r\ntheir  speeches  and make them appear better speakers  and  more\r\n\r\nintelligent men than they are in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are matters of judgment. You can go on arguing what\r\n\r\nis  fair and what is accurate reporting. But, by and large,  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  the News Section are experienced newsmen. They  have\r\n\r\nseen many politicians come and go. They know what interests  the\r\n\r\npeople  better  than the Barisan. The Barisan do not  know  what\r\n\r\ninterests  the people. The newsmen know. So if you say something\r\n\r\nintelligent,  something catching, something  picturesque;  as  I\r\n\r\nhave  suggested  earlier, if you get up and say something  about\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  then people will think, \"Well, at last  these  chaps\r\n\r\nare  sensible,\" then I am quite sure they will get adequate  and\r\n\r\ncomplete  coverage over the radio, on T.V. and in the newspapers\r\n\r\nand, probably, even over Radio Peking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture  has said that had we made speeches of value,  then  the\r\n\r\nreporters  would  have reported them and they  would  have  been\r\n\r\nbroadcast  over  the radio and on T.V., because the  journalists\r\n\r\nknow  what  news is of interest to the people. The Minister,  in\r\n\r\nsaying so, seems to argue that what we have been saying in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  is  of  no interest to the people. Had that been  so,  or\r\n\r\nwhatever  we  have  said is useless, then I will  say  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's purpose and intention underlining all the  speeches\r\n\r\nmade by the Government side is for their own interest. Is it not\r\n\r\nto  the interests of the Party in power to report more on  their\r\n\r\nown speeches than on ours? In fact, in the present system the\r\n\r\nso-called  democracy is controlled by the Party in  power  and  the\r\n\r\nselection of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnews  is  also  in accordance with such a purpose.

Of course, in a colonial newspaper like the  Straits\r\n\r\nTunes,  we  cannot find reports of speeches of an  anti-colonial\r\n\r\nnature. Today we have such a Minister --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

I have been defending our position, as I feel that  the\r\n\r\nspeeches made by Opposition Members have been attacked. At  this\r\n\r\ntime,  we  find  it necessary to counter his attacks  which  are\r\n\r\nfacetious.  Today  the Minister has described  our  speeches  as\r\n\r\nuseless. But, according to what we know, the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nfully  understand that in the present day society of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe  speeches made by Opposition Members, whether reported  over\r\n\r\nthe  radio  or  on T.V., are severely curbed. This  is  an  open\r\n\r\nsecret.  If our speeches were useless and of no value,  then  at\r\n\r\nleast  the  Minister  need  not utter such  fierce  threats  and\r\n\r\nexercise such suppressive control over reporting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the facts that I want to mention in countering what\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Culture has said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I  would  like to say a few words  on  this.  Whatever\r\n\r\nspeeches that are made in this Assembly are for the good of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Television is a good medium for the people,  especially\r\n\r\nat  a  time when we are faced with confrontation from Indonesia.\r\n\r\nT.V. and  radio are run by the Government, and the speeches  of\r\n\r\nMembers are given coverage over them. If the Opposition wish  to\r\n\r\nhave  a full coverage of their speeches over the radio and T.V.,\r\n\r\nthat  will take a lot of time. It will, therefore, leave  little\r\n\r\ntime  for other programmes of entertainment. If Members  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis make speeches that are of no  value,  then  it\r\n\r\nwill be a waste of time to give them a wide coverage. Time could\r\n\r\nbe put to better use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the matter under\r\n\r\ndiscussion  is  whether  or not the  P.A.P. has  been  fair  in\r\n\r\nreporting our speeches made here. Just now we have been  talking\r\n\r\nabout  whether the apportionment of time is based on the  number\r\n\r\nof  Members here or otherwise. Secondly, whether the contents as\r\n\r\nreported  have been distorted. This interests me  most.  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  when Radio Singapore reports our speeches, it is  entirely\r\n\r\ndistorted.  It gives the listeners an impression that Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers  are  unreasonable,  and  that  the  Ministers  are  all\r\n\r\njustified in making their speeches, and sound in their reasoning\r\n\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can give an example. On the 13th of this month when we were\r\n\r\ndebating  the Budget, I said that in dealing with the matter  of\r\n\r\nland  the Government had taken action to reclaim a certain piece\r\n\r\nof  land  from the sand quarry operators and had also  mentioned\r\n\r\nthe farmers affected. The report that came over the radio was to\r\n\r\nthe  effect  that - I heard it in the Amoy language -  when  the\r\n\r\nMinister  asked  the Member for Bukit Panjang to  give  specific\r\n\r\nexamples,  the  Member was unable to give any. In  fact,  I  had\r\n\r\ngiven  all the necessary facts in detail. On the previous  day's\r\n\r\ndebate,  the Minister for National Development asked me to  give\r\n\r\nspecific examples on a certain matter, and I did so. Yet in  the\r\n\r\nreport  over the radio, there was no mention of it. If they  are\r\n\r\nto  continue with this way of reporting, then I suggest that  no\r\n\r\nreport should be given at all of the proceedings here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Generally, the radio and T.V. are entertainment\r\n\r\nmedia for the public. If that is the case, we cannot allow it to\r\n\r\nbe  used  specially  for the Barisan Sosialis.  The  public  are\r\n\r\npaying  $12 and $24 licence fees. But what the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nwant  is that publicity should be given to them. If we do  that,\r\n\r\nthe Government will be in difficulties. The radio and television\r\n\r\nare for the public, and not for the Barisan Sosialis.

Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (4)* standing in the names of Mr\r\n\r\nLim Huan Boon and Mr Koo Young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be reduced by $10 in\r\n\r\nrespect of subhead 2053.*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government, in carrying out any\r\n\r\ncultural  programmes or schemes, is unilateral in its  approach.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  willing to listen to the views of  those  who  have\r\n\r\nexperience  and  who  differ  from  them.  Therefore,  this  has\r\n\r\nresulted  in  schemes  being a flop or having  only  superficial\r\n\r\nsuccess.  Such an attitude of the Government means  a  waste  of\r\n\r\npublic money. It does not help the propagation or interfusion of\r\n\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, I would like to cite an example of the Dewan Bahasa\r\n\r\nDan  Kebudayaan  Kebangsaan. This organ is  very  attractive  in\r\n\r\nname.  Judging  by  its  name, the Dewan Bahasa  Dan  Kebudayaan\r\n\r\nKebangsaan, this Institute is to guide the nation's culture  and\r\n\r\nlanguage  in a healthy direction so as to enable them to  spread\r\n\r\nwidely  and  flourish and to enable research on them  to  be  encouraged and fully promoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in any country, such an Institute has a very heavy\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to  discharge  and  a  very  important  task  to\r\n\r\nperform.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, we regret to  say  that  the  Dewan\r\n\r\nBahasa Dan Kebudayaan Kebangsaan has not properly shouldered its\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  It  is only a cultural  ornament  for  the  Government.  It is a sort of cultural ornament which is rather  out\r\n\r\nof  date. Originally it was in a big show-case. But now  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen shifted to a small show-case. It has been shifted from  the\r\n\r\nlibrary to a small room in the Ministry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Culture.  Ever since the inception of the Dewan  Bahasa  Dan\r\n\r\nKebudayaan  Kebangsaan  more than three years  ago,  the  yearly\r\n\r\nestimate of expenditure provided for this Institute is, if I  am\r\n\r\nnot  mistaken,  about $610,000. For example, the  sum  spent  on\r\n\r\nresearch,  on the Director, on publications and other items,  is\r\n\r\nabout  $296,000. Mr Speaker, Sir, this sum of money may not  be\r\n\r\nvery  big.  But the question is, after spending this  amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney,  have any real results been achieved so far? I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture will give this House a satisfactory  reply.\r\n\r\nOn this issue, there are suspicions in the Press and the public.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  in the Berita Harian of the 12th of  this  month,\r\n\r\nthere  is an article by \"Irama\" which criticised this Institute.\r\n\r\nI  will  now  translate this article into Chinese.  The  article\r\n\r\nruns:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Unfortunately nobody knows what this organ has done up to the\r\n\r\npresent  time.  The officers responsible have  been  moved  into\r\n\r\nanother office.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the research and publications by the Dewan\r\n\r\nBahasa  Dan Kebudayaan Kebangsaan are deplorable. For  the  past\r\n\r\nthree  years, apart from publishing two or three reference books\r\n\r\non the customs and the history of the Malays, this Institute has\r\n\r\nonly  published  booklets  on Malay conversations  and  booklets\r\n\r\nabout the public entrance examination for Standard I Malay. Such\r\n\r\npublications  are  plentiful on the market.  They  are  of  many\r\n\r\nkinds. Therefore, I feel this Institute should not publish  such\r\n\r\npublications. It should publish more important books which  will\r\n\r\ngive guidance to our culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The publications should meet the tastes of the readers. The\r\n\r\nteaching of language should meet the various objectives  of  the\r\n\r\npeople. There is a direct method and an indirect method  in  the\r\n\r\nteaching  of  a  language. The former  method  is  suitable  for\r\n\r\nchildren  and  for those who live in such language surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe second method is suitable for adults, and for those who make\r\n\r\nuse  of the language as a second language. Mr Speaker. Sir,  in\r\n\r\norder  to  popularise  Malay  we  must  study  such  conditions.\r\n\r\nOtherwise no results will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nachieved. In some of the advanced countries English is taught as\r\n\r\na  second language. Many scholars have written books on  methods\r\n\r\nof  teaching from their own experience. They have based them  on\r\n\r\ntheir  own research. Books written according to those principles\r\n\r\nare easy to learn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if this Institute is going to popularise\r\n\r\nMalay and Malay culture, it should imitate and study the methods\r\n\r\nof teaching languages from these advanced countries. They should\r\n\r\ndo  more research into the methods of teaching Malay, Tamil  and\r\n\r\nChinese so as to develop them into a special field of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThey should publish books adopting these modern principles so as\r\n\r\nto meet the demands of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, according to the vote provided for the Dewan\r\n\r\nBahasa Dan Kebudayaan Kebangsaan, it seems that our Minister  is\r\n\r\nnot  going to carry out his duties. There is a reduction in  the\r\n\r\nvote.  We  can see very clearly that in 1964 the money  provided\r\n\r\nfor this Institute was $140,000. But next year the provision  is\r\n\r\nonly $36,000. If the Ministry of Culture wants to carry out  its\r\n\r\nwork properly, it will not achieve anything if it can only spend\r\n\r\nsuch  an amount of money. If they like, they should do away with\r\n\r\nthis  sort  of cultural ornament and not waste any more  of  the\r\n\r\npublic funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am more and more convinced\r\n\r\nthat  the Member is a reasonable man. First, some of the  things\r\n\r\nhe  has  to  say about the Dewan are quite valid, especially  in\r\n\r\nregard  to  the  teaching  of  the national  language.  This  is\r\n\r\nprobably  because he is something of a student of  the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem about the Dewan is this, Sir. With the advent of\r\n\r\nMalaysia, we had to decide whether there should be two  Dewans,\r\n\r\none  a  very elaborate one which has been in existence  for  the\r\n\r\nbest part of 8 or 9 years in Kuala Lumpur, and whether our Dewan\r\n\r\nshould  duplicate those functions. Or should we decide, in  view\r\n\r\nof Malaysia\r\n\r\n-  and  I  hope, Sir, this time they will not use this and  say,\r\n\r\n\"There you are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaysia has brought about further disasters for us!\" It is  not\r\n\r\ndisaster,  Sir. We have decided that with Malaysia we  can  save\r\n\r\nsome  money  and  use the $100,000 that we have  saved  to  more\r\n\r\neffect.  The  immediate  problem, as  we  see  it,  Sir,  is  to\r\n\r\ninculcate in our people, especially the non-Malay adults, a knowledge of the national language. Therefore, the functions of  the\r\n\r\nDewan should not be to surpass the Dewan in Kuala Lumpur. We aim\r\n\r\nfor  a  more  modest  objective of trying to get  the  non-Malay\r\n\r\nadults  to learn the national language as soon as possible.  For\r\n\r\nthis  reason,  the provision for next year has been considerably\r\n\r\nreduced. In fact, the staff --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon:</b> Only one editor left!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> There is one research officer, one editor, a\r\n\r\ntypist  and a clerical officer. Their job now is to try to  help\r\n\r\nto  propagate the national language over the radio, on T.V. and\r\n\r\nin  their publications. I hope that this will be accepted  as  a\r\n\r\nvery reasonable decision. It is no use our spending money to  do\r\n\r\nsomething which Kuala Lumpur is already doing and is experienced\r\n\r\nin doing. That is the reason why the provision for next year has\r\n\r\nbeen reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Culture has just given a reply to the Assembly. I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask a question. Since there is an Institute of Language  and\r\n\r\nCulture  in Kuala Lumpur, and also since several projects  which\r\n\r\nhad  been  launched  have  to  be  removed  from  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nInstitute  to  the Kuala Lumpur Institute, I wonder  whether  we\r\n\r\nshould  still spend over $30,000 to support this Institute.  Why\r\n\r\nshould we not close down this Institute? We can make use of  the\r\n\r\nmoney for some other fields of cultural activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I do not quite understand the Member for\r\n\r\nBukit Merah. Earlier on in his speech, he said how we should try\r\n\r\nand propagate the national language. Now he says, \"Let us not do\r\n\r\nit. Let Kuala Lumpur do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit.\"  I  am assuming that he is all in favour of our making  our\r\n\r\nown  effort  to  propagate the study of the  national  language.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the functions of the Dewan have correspondingly to be\r\n\r\nreorientated.  It  is  not  spending  thousands  of  dollars  in\r\n\r\nresearch. I think the provision is a thousand dollars  for  next\r\n\r\nyear,  mainly on research in regard to how to better  teach  the\r\n\r\nnational  language, especially through the medium of T.V. which\r\n\r\nwe think is a very effective and powerful medium for propagating\r\n\r\nthe  national language. The fact is that there is a Dewan  which\r\n\r\npublishes textbooks and so on, and therefore we agree that there\r\n\r\nis  no need for us to enter the book publishing business because\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur can do it better. They have got all the resources.\r\n\r\nSo,  because  of this, we have decided to reduce the  staff  and\r\n\r\nchange our objectives to a simple, immediate and more useful one\r\n\r\nof popularising the national language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I would not like\r\n\r\nto elaborate further because of limited time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Over 30 old boys'\r\n\r\nassociations  have existed for a very long time, over  8  or  10\r\n\r\nyears.

They notified them by order  to  alter\r\n\r\ntheir constitutions, not allowing them to express their opinions\r\n\r\nas  to  whether they agree or do not agree. They say if they  do\r\n\r\nnot  agree,  the organisations will be banned. This  is  a  very\r\n\r\nserious matter. This will make the P.A.P. democracy a farce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> I will say a few\r\n\r\nwords, Mr Speaker, in answer to the Member for Thomson.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  true  when he said only 36 old boys' associations  received\r\n\r\nnotice  from  the Registrar of Societies asking  them  to  amend\r\n\r\ntheir  constitutions. There are altogether in Singapore  54  old\r\n\r\nboys'  associations.  All  of them  were  given  notice  by  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  to  amend  their constitutions according  to  certain\r\n\r\nrequirements in the law, which was amended, as mentioned by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson, last year. One of the reasons  for  making\r\n\r\namendments  to  the  Ordinance concerning  the  registration  of\r\n\r\nsocieties  is  to  assist them in maintaining public  peace  and\r\n\r\nhelping them to run their societies according to the objects  as\r\n\r\nstated in the constitutions of the associations. Every organiser\r\n\r\nof  a  society,  whether it be an O.B.A. or a  musical  society,\r\n\r\nknows   very   well  that  before  the  society   is   permitted\r\n\r\nregistration, it has to satisfy the Registrar of Societies  with\r\n\r\nregard to certain requirements and has got to state very clearly\r\n\r\nthe   objectives  of  the  organisation.  Now,  an   old   boys'\r\n\r\nassociation,  or any social organisation, obviously  will  cater\r\n\r\nfor  the  interests and welfare of its members. But in our  past\r\n\r\nexperience, old boys' associations, or at least some  old  boys'\r\n\r\nassociations,  are  not as simple as they would  appear  to  be.\r\n\r\nBrass  gong societies do not only beat brass gongs, but they  do\r\n\r\nsomething more damaging\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan just creating a lot of noise. Old boys' associations do not\r\n\r\nonly  meet once a year to take their annual dinner, but they  go\r\n\r\nout taking part in political activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if any association wishes to participate in the political\r\n\r\naffairs of the State, then it is very obvious that such  a  body\r\n\r\nmust  register itself quite separately as a political Party  and\r\n\r\nnot  pretend that it is an association catering merely  for  old\r\n\r\nboys.  It  has come to our knowledge that some of these  O.B.A.s\r\n\r\nhave   shamelessly  acted  as  front  organisations.  They  have\r\n\r\nagitated  against conversion of the educational  system  in  the\r\n\r\nChinese  stream.  Some of them, too, took part  in  calling  for\r\n\r\nblank  votes in the referendum campaign organised by the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see very well indeed why the Member for Thomson expresses\r\n\r\nanxiety  that these O.B.A.s have been asked to conform  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  will adhere solely to the objectives of their associations\r\n\r\nas  stated  when they applied for registration.  Some  of  these\r\n\r\nO.B.A.s admit as members students in schools. Students who  have\r\n\r\nnot  even passed out and could barely claim themselves to be old\r\n\r\nboys,  are  already  members of old boys'  associations.  It  is\r\n\r\nthrough these members of theirs that the O.B.A.s seek to  extend\r\n\r\ntheir  influence  into the schools, or, for  that  matter,  into\r\n\r\ninstitutions  of  higher learning. It is not  our  intention  to\r\n\r\nsuppress  any  association  if it is organised  solely  for  the\r\n\r\nobjectives  for  which  the  association  was  registered.   But\r\n\r\ncertainly  we cannot pretend to allow any organisation  to  wear\r\n\r\nfalse  colours, as it were, to hang up a sheep's head  and  sell\r\n\r\ndog's  meat. That is a little Chinese saying, Mr Speaker.  That\r\n\r\nis  what some of the old boys' associations have been doing. The\r\n\r\namendment  to  the  Societies  Ordinance  made  last  year   was\r\n\r\nnecessary,  and,  in  accordance  with  it,  the  Registrar   of\r\n\r\nSocieties  has acted. I am glad to say, Mr Speaker,  that  from\r\n\r\nour knowledge, quite a number of the old boys' associations have\r\n\r\nagreed to make the necessary adjustments to their constitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before the tea-break, we were on Head 0901\r\n\r\n- Ministry of Social Affairs; amendment (1). I think Mr Chia Thye\r\n\r\nPoh was waiting for a chance to speak. Mr Chia Thye Poh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, my colleague just\r\n\r\nnow  has  mentioned that the Registrar of Societies has  ordered\r\n\r\nsome  old  boys'  associations to make  some  changes  to  their\r\n\r\nconstitutions.   The  purpose  obviously  is   to   curb   their\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Deputy Prime Minister said that the constitutions\r\n\r\nof  certain old boys' associations are out of date and that they\r\n\r\nshould  be amended to meet the present situation. The amendments\r\n\r\nsought  will  not  only curtail the rights  and  powers  of  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Executive Committees of the old boys' associations  but\r\n\r\nalso  affect  the  exercise of their rights in some  activities,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  inviting members of the public to take part in certain\r\n\r\nsocial  activities. The amendments to the constitutions  of  the\r\n\r\nold  boys'  associations will affect the powers  of  these  associations as well as those of the higher institutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I want to say that the amendments sought by the\r\n\r\nGovernment will curb the exercise of the powers of the old boys'\r\n\r\nassociations  and that what the Deputy Prime Minister  has  said\r\n\r\nis,  in  fact, to hide the real intention of the Government.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  the  constitutions  of the old  boys'  associations  have\r\n\r\nproved  to  be good and they have been in force for many  years.\r\n\r\nSome  of these associations have existed for 20 to 30 years  and\r\n\r\ntheir constitutions have proved to be useful, without being  out\r\n\r\nof date. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactivities  of the associations have been praised by educational\r\n\r\ncircles.  At  the present juncture, the activities  of  the  old\r\n\r\nboys'  associations have been directed towards the promotion  of\r\n\r\nhealthy  educational and cultural activities, such  as  concerts\r\n\r\nand  shows which are partly for the amusement of their  members.\r\n\r\nThese concerts and shows have usually been staged openly and  as\r\n\r\nfar  as  their contents and techniques are concerned, they  have\r\n\r\nwon  the  praise  of members of the public. Such activities  are\r\n\r\nactually  of  value and use to society. We cannot  see  anything\r\n\r\nthat is detrimental to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to make is that the activities of these\r\n\r\nold  boys' associations can help in the matter of education. For\r\n\r\ninstance,  when  certain  schools find themselves  in  financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties and are in need of public donations, the old  boys'\r\n\r\nassociations launch a campaign for donations from the public  to\r\n\r\nhelp  these  schools.  In  this way, the  \"mother\"  schools  are\r\n\r\ngreatly  assisted. This also helps the growth and  promotion  of\r\n\r\neducation in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also seen certain members of the old boys' associations\r\n\r\nbecoming  teachers or even directors on the board of  management\r\n\r\nof  their  \"mother\" schools, and thus being  of  great  use  and\r\n\r\nservice  to education. Therefore, I just cannot see the validity\r\n\r\nof the Deputy Prime Minister's contention that the activities of\r\n\r\nthese  old  boys'  associations have been  deterimental  to  the\r\n\r\ninterests of society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also said that these associations have issued statements\r\n\r\non  political matters. In this respect, I say that it  is  their\r\n\r\nright  to  express what they think will be in  the  interest  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. It is not only the right but also the duty  of  every\r\n\r\nresponsible   citizen  of  Singapore  to  express  such   views.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the statements made by the associations have not  been\r\n\r\nirresponsible.  It  is not right to say that these  associations\r\n\r\nshould not express their opinions on important matters of State,\r\n\r\nbecause  organisations and educational bodies under the  control\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P. have also made statements on political  matters.\r\n\r\nEducational and cultural bodies of the P.A.P. have issued\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\nstatements expressing their views on political matters. So it is\r\n\r\nunfair  for the Deputy Prime Minister to accuse these old  boys'\r\n\r\nassociations of such action. Unless the P.A.P.'s intention is to\r\n\r\nsuppress all freedom of expression, I do not see anything  wrong\r\n\r\nwith  members  of  the old boys' associations  expressing  their\r\n\r\nrights as citizens of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Deputy Prime Minister has also described the\r\n\r\nassociations  as  putting up heads of sheep  and  selling  dog's\r\n\r\nmeat.  But  I  say that the P.A.P. is burning a big  fire  while\r\n\r\nprohibiting  other people from lighting lamps. I also  say  that\r\n\r\nthe  amendments  sought to the constitutions of  the  old  boys'\r\n\r\nassociations  will  not  help in resolving  the  matter.  It  is\r\n\r\nintended  that old boys who want to join higher institutions  of\r\n\r\nlearning  should  not be allowed to become members  of  the  old\r\n\r\nboys'   associations.  By  doing  this,  the   Government   will\r\n\r\nundoubtedly  be curbing their activities. These  old  boys  have\r\n\r\nevery  right to join the old boys' associations since they  have\r\n\r\ngraduated  from  those  schools.  The  authorities  should  not,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  try to deprive them of their right  to  join  up  as\r\n\r\nmembers of the old boys' associations. If the Government were to\r\n\r\nissue orders to the effect that former students should not  join\r\n\r\nthe  old  boys'  associations, I would say that this  is  not  a\r\n\r\nmatter  within the power of the Registrar of Societies,  because\r\n\r\nthere  are parents to look after their children. In fact,  there\r\n\r\nare  parents  who  are  proud and happy to  see  their  children\r\n\r\njoining  the  old boys' associations, because these associations\r\n\r\ncan give them plenty of help. For instance, I know that some old\r\n\r\nboys'  associations conduct classes to teach the  more  backward\r\n\r\nstudents,  thus  providing  a great  service  to  the  students.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  feel that there is nothing wrong  in  the  pupils\r\n\r\njoining the old boys' associations. There are even people in the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. taking part in the P.A.P. activities, and some old  boys\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P. group are also invited to take part in the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nactivities. So, why should the Government now accuse  others  of\r\n\r\njoining old boys' associations, when the P.A.P. themselves carry\r\n\r\nout  such  activities?  There have been  such  activities  where\r\n\r\nP.A.P. members have become members of old boys' associations. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntherefore say that the Government should not abuse its powers by\r\n\r\ncurbing the old boys' associations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, it now\r\n\r\nseems  that  the Opposition Member is very clever in  distorting\r\n\r\nthe facts. I want to rebut every point that he has raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the name \"old boys' association\" we know what such an\r\n\r\nassociation  is  meant for. If we were to  change  the  name  to\r\n\r\n\"students/old  boys' association\", according  to  what  was  suggested  by the Member for Jurong, then students will be  allowed\r\n\r\nto  join the association as well. But, in actual fact, according\r\n\r\nto  the  present  name, such an association is  only  meant  for\r\n\r\nstudents who have already left school. That is why it is  called\r\n\r\nold  boys'  association, because it is not  meant  for  students\r\n\r\nattending school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After understanding what the association is meant for, we can\r\n\r\nunderstand why the Government is asking for changes to  be  made\r\n\r\nin the constitutions of the old boys' associations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four points. First, all those students who had in the\r\n\r\npast  been  studying in one particular school can join  the  old\r\n\r\nboys'  association of that school. Students who left the  school\r\n\r\nbefore  completing their studies in that school cannot join  the\r\n\r\nold boys' association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, old boys' associations should not be used for\r\n\r\npolitical  purposes. The P.A.P. Government does not  oppose  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  political Parties. Neither  does  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment fear political argument. If they want to  set  up  an\r\n\r\nold  boys' association, then its activities should be within the\r\n\r\npurview  and  constitution  of the  association  and  not  those\r\n\r\ntouching on political matters. So we are of the opinion that old\r\n\r\nboys' associations should not indulge in political activities or\r\n\r\nbe made use of by political Parties for political purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on the funds of the old boys' association, the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  and  their united front want to use such  funds  under\r\n\r\ncover of the name of donations to help the Communist Front in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nits  activities. The Government is aware that association  funds\r\n\r\nhave  been  misused for political purposes and would advise  old\r\n\r\nboys'  associations  not to use such money for  activities,  but\r\n\r\nshould use the money within the confines of the constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, statements issued by the old boys' associations\r\n\r\nshould  be approved by the supervisory committee or the  central\r\n\r\ncommittee of the associations concerned. We stress on  this.  We\r\n\r\ndo  not  say  that  it  should be passed by the  P.A.P.  Central\r\n\r\nCommittee.  It  should be passed by the committee  of  that  particular  association. In the past, we have seen many  statements\r\n\r\nissued in the names of certain associations without their  being\r\n\r\nproperly approved by the associations. They were merely  chopped\r\n\r\nwith  the  association's stamp. We know  that  every  old  boys'\r\n\r\nassociation  has its own stamp and it is not possible  to  affix\r\n\r\nits chop on to one particular statement. There have been over 30\r\n\r\nchops  affixed to a statement of a political nature in the past.\r\n\r\nSo  I  hope that the stamps of the old boys' associations should\r\n\r\nnot  be  made use of by certain irresponsible people. Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  say  that  before any statement is issued by any  old  boys'\r\n\r\nassociation, it should be properly approved by the committee responsible.  After it has been approved by the committee,  it  can\r\n\r\nthen be published. So far, some old boys' associations have been\r\n\r\nquite irresponsible in issuing statements --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P.

If I remember correctly,  the  fire\r\n\r\noccurred  one day after Deepavali. It seems a coincidence,  when\r\n\r\nwe are debating the Estimates this year, that there should be  a\r\n\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire at Pulau Minyak, in Lorong 1, deprived 1,000 people of\r\n\r\ntheir  homes. When we were debating on the subject of  the  Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade  last year I suggested that the Government should  think\r\n\r\nof  ways  and  means to prevent outbreaks of  fire.  Every  year\r\n\r\nhundreds  of attap houses go up in flames. These houses happened\r\n\r\nto  be in areas under eviction orders. This is a coincidence. If\r\n\r\nthis is arranged by God, we would rather say that it is arranged\r\n\r\nby  the  P.A.P.  Last  year  I requested  the  Minister  to  pay\r\n\r\nattention to this matter. I requested him to help the people  in\r\n\r\nareas with many attap houses against fire. Only people living in\r\n\r\nvillages  can prevent outbreaks of fires, if we rely  on  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers to fight fires, I believe more fires will occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Lorong 1 the fire victims did not receive the same benefits\r\n\r\nthat  were obtained by the Bukit Ho Swee fire victims.  I  know,\r\n\r\nwhen  I mention these things, what the reply is going to  be.  I\r\n\r\nknow  they are going to say that they give free housing. I  know\r\n\r\nthat the fire victims are being moved to Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard  flats. They were also given $35 per family.  I  know  all\r\n\r\nthis.  But  this  is not an honourable thing. I know  that  many\r\n\r\nHousing  Board  flats  are empty and yet the  P.A.P. are  still\r\n\r\nbuilding them. These flats are built to prepare for the victims.\r\n\r\nMost of the victims had their own houses. They were required  to\r\n\r\npay  only $5 per month. But now they are made to pay more.  This\r\n\r\nwould give more revenue to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  That  is why the P.A.P. is happy in doing these  things.\r\n\r\nThe  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social  Affairs\r\n\r\nsaid  they were going to give milk, etc. and some money  to  the\r\n\r\nvictims,  saying  that every victim could get  $10  -  $5  being\r\n\r\ndonated  by  the Relief Committee and $5 by the Lee  Foundation.\r\n\r\nThe  money collected by the Relief Committee was collected  from\r\n\r\nthe  public  during  the  Bukit Ho  Swee  fire.  This  time  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could not appeal to the people to  donate  money  as\r\n\r\nbefore,  because the people have already lost interest  in  what\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. is doing. Therefore, the P.A.P. has to make  use  of\r\n\r\nmoney  collected before. Victims of the Bukit Ho Swee fire  have\r\n\r\ncomplained  that  shoes donated for the victims  have  not  been\r\n\r\ngiven  to them. They have also complained that the money donated\r\n\r\nto  them  has not been distributed to them in full. And now  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is using this money for the victims of this fire. The\r\n\r\nindications are that many more houses will he burnt in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, another matter I would like to stress\r\n\r\nis  that  these  victims should be looked after  properly.  Some\r\n\r\nvictims were running provision stores before the fire. I know no\r\n\r\ninsurance  company would insure attap houses. When these  houses\r\n\r\ngo  up in flames, the occupiers lose everything. They can hardly\r\n\r\nopen  another shop to earn a living. It is not possible to  open\r\n\r\nshops  in Housing and Development Board shops because the  rents\r\n\r\nare so high. In the past, they paid a rent of $10 or so, but  in\r\n\r\nthe  Housing  and Development Board shops, the high  rent  is  a\r\n\r\ngreat  problem.  They  have to pay  a  rent  of  $300  or  more.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I suggest that the Minister should pay more attention\r\n\r\nto  this  problem. He must also pay more attention to  the  fire\r\n\r\nvictims  and  appeal to the public to help the victims  and  not\r\n\r\nrely on the Government alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, I believe\r\n\r\nthat there is no one smarter than the Barisan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin distorting facts. According to what the hon. Member has said,\r\n\r\nit  seems that the P.A.P. started the fire. However, the victims\r\n\r\nknew  that  it  was  caused by some careless people.  There  was\r\n\r\nevidence   to  prove  this.  What  the  Barisan   say   is   not\r\n\r\nsubstantiated.  Whatever  we say or  do,  we  have  evidence  to\r\n\r\nsupport us. The Government is happy to receive criticisms and it\r\n\r\nwill help the people to improve their lot. But we are faced with\r\n\r\ndifficulties   because   the   Barisan   criticisms   are    not\r\n\r\nconstructive.  It  would appear that the  Barisan  Sosialis  are\r\n\r\nmewing for dead rats. They say that they are sympathetic to  the\r\n\r\nfire  victims. I myself, after the fire, went round to see  the\r\n\r\nvictims.  At that time, the House was in session and  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  went  there  too. The Minister for  Health  also  went\r\n\r\nthere.  They went there to pacify the victims. They  asked  that\r\n\r\nrelief work should be started immediately to help the victims to\r\n\r\nrebuild their homes again. It is not our intention just to  come\r\n\r\nhere  to say some good words in order to win their votes in  the\r\n\r\nnext election. We do not want to add oil to the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of time, I am unable to reply to the hon. Member's\r\n\r\nquestions point by point. The Barisan do not debate on principle\r\n\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member says that our flats are too expensive. The\r\n\r\nGovernment let the victims stay in Housing Board flats,  and  we\r\n\r\ngive them an allowance of $7.00 per person, subject to a maximum\r\n\r\nof  $35.00 per family, and a subsidy of three months'  rent.  If\r\n\r\nanyone  can  say that the Government is not helping the  people,\r\n\r\nthen  I  say that in the whole of South-East Asia, or  for  that\r\n\r\nmatter  even in the whole world, there is no such Government  as\r\n\r\nours.  Can  one point out any country in South-East  Asia  which\r\n\r\ngives  such generous allowances to the victims? Of course,  this\r\n\r\nis  so in Indonesia! In Indonesia, if your house is destroyed by\r\n\r\nfire, the authorities will ask you to eat rats!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the Fire Brigade, I am the adviser to the Fire Brigade.\r\n\r\nIf  I  cannot do the work properly, they will not want me. There\r\n\r\nare  in Singapore 51 fire brigades with good fire-fighting equip\r\n\r\nment. If there is a fire in any place,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  fire  brigade teams go there to help the people  fight  it.\r\n\r\nThese  are  facts  which we cannot refute.  If  you  go  to  any\r\n\r\nvillage,  you  will  see  such arrangements.  I  ask  Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers to give me facts to prove otherwise. They are unable  to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate what they say. What they say is just nonsense. They\r\n\r\nblame  the radio for not broadcasting their speeches made  here.\r\n\r\nIn  every  village, there are 71 fire-fighters. For example,  in\r\n\r\nToa Payoh, every one can see that there are fire-fighting teams.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Barisan  say  that the P.A.P. is not  working  for  the\r\n\r\npeople, then what are they talking about?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the hon. Member says that it is very\r\n\r\nstrange that fires usually break out in places where the  people\r\n\r\nare  faced  with eviction orders. He even says that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhelped  to cause the fire. Such utterances are irresponsible.  I\r\n\r\nhave  just  rebutted  that by saying that some  careless  people\r\n\r\ncaused  it.  There were witnesses to substantiate that.  We  can\r\n\r\nprove that the Barisan Sosialis have been spreading rumours  and\r\n\r\ndistorting facts to the villagers to make them misunderstand the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The reporters at the scene of the fire can  testify\r\n\r\nthat  we asked the fire victims whether they would like to  move\r\n\r\nto Tanjong Rhu, and most of them say that they would, because it\r\n\r\nis  a  very cool place. The present accommodation is better than\r\n\r\ntheir  former accommodation. When they were speaking, they  were\r\n\r\nsmiling. The Barisan did not think of the people when they  were\r\n\r\nspeaking.  They were just speaking to the audience  outside  the\r\n\r\nHouse. I believe they would be happier when there are more  fire\r\n\r\nvictims. We moved these people to Tanjong Rhu, to better houses,\r\n\r\nand  gave them $10 per person, so as to restore their confidence\r\n\r\nand to enable them to live as ordinary people. This is a task of\r\n\r\nthe  Government and we are doing it. We are not playing politics\r\n\r\nwhen  we do this. We do not have to do propaganda work. We  know\r\n\r\nthat  they  went  there and said that they were members  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan. When they opened their mouths, they mentioned they were\r\n\r\nmembers of the Barisan. They did not go there to work. They went\r\n\r\nthere and told the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  they represented the Barisan.

These victims would\r\n\r\nbe  happy to receive donations. But the Barisan did not give any\r\n\r\ndonations. They did not say they were sympathetic and that  they\r\n\r\nwould  give  their $500 allowance to them. They  only  paid  lip\r\n\r\nservice.  Did  they go to the scene to console the victims?  No,\r\n\r\nthey did not.

If  its\r\n\r\nwork  is getting heavier and heavier, then, relatively speaking,\r\n\r\nthere  are more and more people receiving aid from it  and  more\r\n\r\nand  more  people  are suffering from misery. That  means  after\r\n\r\nMalaysia  there are more and more people who require  help  from\r\n\r\nthe  Government  and the Social Welfare Department.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot boast that it is able to help many  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. In fact, the P.A.P. should be ashamed of itself.  All\r\n\r\nover the world, under enlightened leadership, governments try to\r\n\r\nprevent  the occurrence of misery and suffering in society.  But\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. does not belong to this category of government.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. will try to create misery and suffering and then try  to\r\n\r\nshow that it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  merciful as the Goddess of Mercy by helping them, so that it\r\n\r\ncan  tell the world how it helps the poor people in society  for\r\n\r\ntheir publicity purpose. They do not have the courage to mention\r\n\r\nthe  cause of misery in general. I can give you some facts.  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, to illustrate my point. For example, the Social\r\n\r\nWelfare Department does not say what type of people are eligible\r\n\r\nfor  aid  and how these people are eligible for it. I have  some\r\n\r\nfacts  to show you. One, the P.A.P. Government is wasting public\r\n\r\nfunds  by employing the police to arrest people so that  members\r\n\r\nof their families will be rendered helpless, and their source of\r\n\r\nfinancial  income  cut off. As a result of the  arrest  of  some\r\n\r\nbreadwinners,  a lot of people have to go to the Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment.  This  accounts for a part of the  people  receiving\r\n\r\nrelief from the Social Welfare Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Demolition Squad is responsible for\r\n\r\nthis.  They  abused  the  law and pulled  down  the  houses  and\r\n\r\nhawkers'   stalls  of  the  poor  people  without   paying   any\r\n\r\ncompensation.  This happened in Choa Chu Kang  and  it  is  well\r\n\r\nknown to the people that this is due to the P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hawker stalls are pulled down in Aljunied Road, in Queenstown,\r\n\r\nand  this is a common sight. This action against the poor people\r\n\r\nforces them to go to the Social Welfare Department for aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, more serious still, is the question of racial\r\n\r\ndisturbances.  Some people lost their lives  during  the  recent\r\n\r\ndisturbances, thereby rendering the members of their family helpless. They have to go to the Social Welfare Department for help.\r\n\r\nThe  Government should be held responsible for the loss of  such\r\n\r\nlives.  Instead, it takes pride in being able  to  give  aid  to\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the unfortunate families. That is why I  have  said\r\n\r\nearlier  that the P.A.P. tries to create misery, and then  tries\r\n\r\nto help the people afflicted and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntakes  pride  in  it.  All the present  misery  is  due  to  the\r\n\r\nformation of Malaysia, in short.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to bring out is that all the facts that I\r\n\r\nhave mentioned show that there are more people in Singapore  who\r\n\r\nrequire relief, but, on the contrary, we can see that the relief\r\n\r\nby  the Social Welfare Department has been cut down. Some people\r\n\r\nhave had their allowances cut down or completely stopped. I have\r\n\r\nbeen  informed by a Parliamentary Secretary in this  House  that\r\n\r\nsome  1,100-odd persons have had their relief stopped, and 1,280\r\n\r\ncases  have  had  their relief reduced. This is  very  puzzling,\r\n\r\nbecause, on the one hand, we have more and more people requiring\r\n\r\naid,  and,  on the other hand, the Social Welfare Department  is\r\n\r\ncutting down on the allowances drawn by these people. The reason\r\n\r\ngiven  is  that  some recipients do not make accurate  and  true\r\n\r\nreports of their financial circumstances. But how can we account\r\n\r\nfor  the  great number of such cases? Another point is concerned\r\n\r\nwith the stoppage and reduction of relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see from the newspapers that the Prime Minister said on\r\n\r\nthe  14th of this month that more and more beggars are appearing\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  Some beggars come from hundreds of  miles  away.\r\n\r\nThat  is  what  the  Prime Minister said. This  shows  that  the\r\n\r\neconomy of Singapore is going to the dogs, so that more and more\r\n\r\nbeggars  are appearing in our streets. There are some  who  come\r\n\r\nfrom  the Federation. I cannot imagine that Singapore has become\r\n\r\na  paradise to beggars so that beggars from other territories in\r\n\r\nMalaysia are attracted to our place. The so-called New  York  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia is the collecting centre of beggars! In the Federation,\r\n\r\nthe position is quite different. So the beggars have to come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore. But this is a problem which concerns Singapore and we\r\n\r\nhave  to give our attention to it. The Prime Minister says  that\r\n\r\nsome of the beggars are from the Federation. I think he is right\r\n\r\nby  half  of  what he says. I believe that most of  the  beggars\r\n\r\nactually suffer --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng):</b> There is five more minutes\r\n\r\nleft.

On the 14th December last year, when  we\r\n\r\nwere debating this item, I asked the Minister for Social Affairs\r\n\r\nto  pay  attention  to  the inmates of a certain  temple  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency,  but  so far more than one year  has  lapsed,  and\r\n\r\nnothing  has  been  done.  I wrote to the  Minister  for  Social\r\n\r\nAffairs  on the 19th June this year, but so far I have  received\r\n\r\nno  reply.  On  the other hand, the Government  claim  they  are\r\n\r\nsincere  in  wishing to relieve the people. But the  question  I\r\n\r\nhave brought up over a year ago is still not being attended  to.\r\n\r\nThis  shows  that  they are only concerned  with  publicity  and\r\n\r\npropaganda  when  they  do  relief work.  When  relief  work  is\r\n\r\nrequired to be done without any publicity, they would not care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, if I were to give the\r\n\r\nHouse statistics of the amounts of public assistance which  have\r\n\r\nbeen  given  out  by the Social Welfare Department,  the  public\r\n\r\nwould  be  in a better position to understand how much care  and\r\n\r\nconcern the Government has for those who are unemployed and  for\r\n\r\nthose whose families have suffered hardship either on account of\r\n\r\nsome  persons being disabled or the breadwinner of the household\r\n\r\nbeing  detained  under  the Criminal Law (Temporary  Provisions)\r\n\r\nOrdinance. In 1961 public assistance was $7.21 million; in 1962,\r\n\r\n$4.49  million; in 1963, $9.72 million; in 1964, $9.40  million;\r\n\r\nfor  1965  we are asking in this Budget sitting $10 million.  It\r\n\r\ncan  be  seen that year by year the sum which has been allocated\r\n\r\nfor  public assistance is increasing, not diminishing.  For  the\r\n\r\nsums  given  to  patients who have been receiving  treatment  on\r\n\r\naccount of tuberculosis, the figures are as follows: 1961, $1.89\r\n\r\nmillion;  1962, $2.14 million; 1963, $1.88 million; 1964,  $2.20\r\n\r\nmillion, and 1965, $1.90 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may ask the Member for Bukit Panjang. \"Which country in Asia\r\n\r\ndoles out so much assistance per capita?\" Let the Members of the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis remember that somebody has got to pay  towards\r\n\r\nthe  contributions  for  public assistance, it  is  the  public\r\n\r\neventually who have got to stump out the money which is given to\r\n\r\nassist  those  persons who are suffering from hardship.  And  as\r\n\r\ncaretakers  of  the  public  money, it  is  necessary  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  see to it that the sum  of  money  which  is\r\n\r\ndevoted to public assistance is carefully spent. In fact,  after\r\n\r\nthe  PAP. Government assumed office in 1959, the rate of  public\r\n\r\nassistance  allowance to the heads of households  was  increased\r\n\r\nfrom  $15 to $16 per month; and to the wife from $8 to  $10  per\r\n\r\nmonth.  In  January  1962  the rate  of  allowance  was  further\r\n\r\nincreased  for  the head of the household from $16  to  $21  per\r\n\r\nmonth.  Now it has also come to our attention that a  number  of\r\n\r\nrecipients of public assistance do not fairly report changes  in\r\n\r\ntheir  financial circumstances. It has been found that a  number\r\n\r\nof  these  recipients  tend to conceal their  other  sources  of\r\n\r\nincome,  for  example, income derived from part-time employment,\r\n\r\nhawking, or piece-rate earnings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng):</b> Order.

As a matter of fact, I am afraid that this  old\r\n\r\nrefrain  makes  one fed up. As far back as last year,  when  the\r\n\r\neducation  policy of the Government came under  debate  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  I drew the attention of the House to the defects of  the\r\n\r\neducation  policy  of  the Government.  However,  one  year  has\r\n\r\npassed,  and  the Ministry of Education has taken  no  steps  to\r\n\r\nremove  the  defects.  On the contrary, they  still  persist  in\r\n\r\nimplementing the wrong policy in education, which is to continue\r\n\r\nthe whole colonial educational structure. Mr Deputy Speaker, in\r\n\r\nthe  past few years, one must note that the expenditure  on  education has been around $100 million. This is quite a big sum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not forget that this money comes from the taxpayers by\r\n\r\nway  of  revenue paid to the Government and that  the  taxpayers\r\n\r\nhave the right to hope that the Government will make proper  use\r\n\r\nof  this  money so that our younger generation may  be  educated\r\n\r\nproperly  and  trained  to  shoulder their  responsibilities  as\r\n\r\ncitizens  when  they grow up. But what are the  facts?  Has  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Education made good use of the hard-earned  money\r\n\r\ngiven  by  the taxpayers? No, he has wasted it. I wish  to  give\r\n\r\nsome illustrations to explain this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, the Ministry of Education is spending some\r\n\r\n$107  million  on  education. A part of it is to  pay  for  free\r\n\r\nprimary education, but while, on the one hand, the Government is\r\n\r\npaying  so  much  for  free education, on the  other  hand,  the\r\n\r\nstudents who have received six years of primary education mostly\r\n\r\nfail  the  Primary School Leaving Examination. We  can  see  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  failures during the past three years or  so.  Almost\r\n\r\nevery  year,  some  40  per cent of all the  students  fail  the\r\n\r\nexamination.  As a result, they have to leave school.  Can  they\r\n\r\nthen get any job? No, because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  are  too  young to take up employment.  Can  they  go  for\r\n\r\nfurther  studies? No, because they have not passed  the  Primary\r\n\r\nSchool Leaving Examination. So the only thing for them to do  is\r\n\r\nto  roam about the streets and do nothing. Finally, they end up,\r\n\r\nunder  the  leadership of our Minister for Culture, as  yankees,\r\n\r\nhooligans and, even worse still, as members of secret societies.\r\n\r\nThese  yankees  wear  trousers similar  to  those  worn  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Culture. As a result, crime is on the increase.  A\r\n\r\nlot  of the taxpayers' money is spent on educating them but they\r\n\r\ndo  not  reap  any benefit. So the money is wasted. Furthermore,\r\n\r\nthe  taxpayers have to pay more money for the maintenance of the\r\n\r\ncourts, the reformative training centres and even the prisons to\r\n\r\naccommodate these misled students. As a result, there has been a\r\n\r\ndouble  wastage  of public funds. Perhaps the Minister  for  Education  may say that this state of affairs is inevitable because\r\n\r\nthese unsuccessful students are unable to further their studies,\r\n\r\nas they are stupid, useless and good for nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what can one do about it? In my opinion, if the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  gives up the idea of monopolising  education  as  an\r\n\r\nenterprise,  particularly if it stops suppressing  educationists\r\n\r\nand  inducing some of the people in educational circles to serve\r\n\r\nits  interests,  then  the educational workers  will  have  more\r\n\r\nconfidence  in their work and a greater sense of responsibility,\r\n\r\nand  they will carry out their duties more efficiently. If  this\r\n\r\nhappens,  then  the whole situation will change. If  educational\r\n\r\ncircles  are not respected by the Government and are treated  by\r\n\r\nthem  as tools, then they will not have any confidence in  their\r\n\r\nwork.   They   will  not,  under  suppression,  oppression   and\r\n\r\nhumiliation, contribute their share to society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the results of the students, whether good or bad,\r\n\r\nmainly  depend on the teachers. I will give you an  illustration\r\n\r\nof this point. When the results\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the public examination are announced, one will notice that in\r\n\r\nsome  schools the percentage of passes is as high as 90 per cent\r\n\r\nor  even  100 per cent, but it is sad to say that the percentage\r\n\r\nof  passes in some schools is only 20 to 30. Why should there be\r\n\r\nsuch a great difference? Why is it that some schools are able to\r\n\r\nscore one hundred per cent passes while others can only score 20\r\n\r\nto  30 per cent passes? Why should this be so? Does it mean that\r\n\r\nsome  schools  have  students  who  are  extremely  intelligent,\r\n\r\nwhereas  other schools have students who are stupid? Of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  answer  is in the negative. So the undeniable  facts  prove\r\n\r\nthat  the  students  can improve and get better  results.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult  of improvement, less students will fail, and we  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  to  turn  a lot of them away from school and waste  public\r\n\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there are many parents, students and even teachers\r\n\r\nwho  are  beginning  to suspect that it is  the  policy  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to eliminate the students on a large scale by holding\r\n\r\na public examination which is not intended to measure the merits\r\n\r\nand  standard of study of the students. So I urge the Government\r\n\r\nto  review  the present system - or better still, to abolish  it\r\n\r\nentirely.  Perhaps in order to improve these students'  results,\r\n\r\nanother question arises and this brings us to the second  point.\r\n\r\nThat is, if there were only some 60 per cent of students passing\r\n\r\nfrom  the public examination and this figure is raised to  more,\r\n\r\nsay,  70  or 80 per cent, then there would not be enough schools\r\n\r\nto  accommodate them when the greater number of passes go on  to\r\n\r\nfurther studies. As a result, if we are to build more schools to\r\n\r\naccommodate the extra passes, then the Minister for  Finance  or\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Education may say, \"Since we are spending some\r\n\r\n$100  million on education, if we allow more students  to  pass,\r\n\r\ndoes it not mean that we have to spend more money on education?\"\r\n\r\nThe Government will say it is not in a position to shoulder such\r\n\r\na  burden. But I would like to tell the Party in power  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  worry about this point. I can tell them  that  they\r\n\r\nneed  not  pay  extra money towards this end. In fact,  it  will\r\n\r\nreduce the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on education and have more students going to  school.\r\n\r\nBut there is one pre-requisite, and that is, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. must  give up the idea of monopolising  education  as  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of enterprise. I mentioned last year in this House  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  was trying to monopolise education  and,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult, a lot of disadvantages and defects arose. But the  facts\r\n\r\nnow  show  that they are not prepared to give up  this  idea  of\r\n\r\nmonopolising education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if the Government is prepared to do this, as I\r\n\r\nsuggest,  then  it  can  do  better  by  encouraging  vernacular\r\n\r\neducation,  education in schools run by the  people  themselves.\r\n\r\nThere are some wise businessmen who are prepared to pay for  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  and maintenance of schools run privately.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  poorer  people of Singapore are also prepared to contribute\r\n\r\ntheir  share  towards  education. The establishment  of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  is  one  clear  example. Thousands  of  people  have\r\n\r\ncontributed  towards  the setting up of Nanyang  University  and\r\n\r\nthousands have contributed towards its maintenance. The  hawkers\r\n\r\nhave  sold  their wares, and contributed the whole  proceeds  to\r\n\r\nNanyang  University. But the situation at the present moment  is\r\n\r\nquite  different.  In the past, during the colonial  days,  when\r\n\r\nthere  were  many  Chinese schools in existence and  established\r\n\r\nunder  this  system, one will remember that the  maintenance  of\r\n\r\nsuch schools depended on the financial contributions made by the\r\n\r\npoor  people and the business community in Singapore.  But  ever\r\n\r\nsince  the Government assumed control of Nanyang University  and\r\n\r\naided schools and refused to respect the Board of Directors, the\r\n\r\nwhole  situation has changed. Members of the Board of  Directors\r\n\r\nhave  received no respect from the Government and so they  would\r\n\r\nnot  contribute  any  further  towards  education.  This  is   a\r\n\r\nreasonable reaction. As a matter of fact, education run  by  the\r\n\r\npeople  is  good  so  far  as  it helps  to  train  our  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration. In fact, it helps the Government to run education in\r\n\r\na better way and help education to flourish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member has had his 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  just now the Member for Thomson has talked  about\r\n\r\nmatters  relating to our education system and has  alleged  that\r\n\r\nthe  system  of public education is to eliminate students  on  a\r\n\r\nlarge  scale  so that young people are forced out of  school  to\r\n\r\nroam  about  in  the  streets. Mr Speaker, this  falsehood  and\r\n\r\nunfounded  criticism has been repeated over and  over  again  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  and  outside this House. If  we  allow  these  wild\r\n\r\nutterances  to  be  repeated  without  any  rebuttal,  then  the\r\n\r\nimpression may be created in the minds of some people that  such\r\n\r\nutterances  may have some truth in them. So it  is  my  duty  to\r\n\r\nanswer such wild utterances and allegations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has said just now that the percentage of\r\n\r\npasses in the Primary School Leaving Examination is about 60 per\r\n\r\ncent  and  the remaining 40 per cent have to be eliminated.  But\r\n\r\nthis statement is not in accordance with the facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of the public examination are improving year by\r\n\r\nyear.  In  fact, the percentage of passes is raised every  year.\r\n\r\nFor this year, in the Primary School Leaving Examination, 63 per\r\n\r\ncent  have  passed, which is higher than that for last  year  by\r\n\r\nalmost  5  per cent. Mr Speaker, the remaining percentage  that\r\n\r\nhave  failed are still in school. As a matter of fact,  we  have\r\n\r\nnot  dismissed  them. They are not eliminated. Taking  the  1963\r\n\r\nfigure  of unsuccessful candidates in the Primary School Leaving\r\n\r\nExamination,  60 per cent were successful, and of the  remaining\r\n\r\n40 per cent who were unsuccessful, 24 per cent had to repeat the\r\n\r\nPrimary  VI  classes in preparation for this year's examination.\r\n\r\nAnother  15 per cent of the remaining 40 per cent were  sent  to\r\n\r\nvocational   schools  for  two  years.  So  the  actual   figure\r\n\r\neliminated  was  1 per cent, because students in  this  category\r\n\r\nhave reached the age of 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have said time and again that the minimum school leaving age\r\n\r\nis  16  years. We never ask a child of 11 or 12 years  to  leave\r\n\r\nschool.  Every  primary school student who  has  failed  in  the\r\n\r\nPrimary   School   Leaving  Examination  has   more   than   two\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  make the grade. He can sit  for  the  Primary\r\n\r\nSchool Leaving Examination twice, and if he should fail again he\r\n\r\nwill be asked to join a vocational school to receive another two\r\n\r\nyears of education. This has been the practice over the past few\r\n\r\nyears. I am surprised to note that the Member for Thomson should\r\n\r\nrepeat  the old refrain and falsehoods in this House. If he  did\r\n\r\nnot  do so deliberately, then it only shows his ignorance of the\r\n\r\nactual situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the minimum age for leaving school is 16 years. In\r\n\r\nAsian countries, and even in England, this is the objective  yet\r\n\r\nto  be achieved. But in Singapore we have already achieved  this\r\n\r\nobjective  by raising the school-leaving age to 16. If  this  is\r\n\r\nnot  an  unprecedented achievement, I do not  know  what  is  an\r\n\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Thomson also agreed that we should spend a great\r\n\r\ndeal  of money on education. For last year and this year we have\r\n\r\nspent  about  $105 million. In fact, in the Estimates  for  next\r\n\r\nyear,  the  vote  asked for amounts to some $107  million.  This\r\n\r\nfigure  is  enormous  and  it is about one-third  of  the  total\r\n\r\nexpenditure of the State. Mr Speaker, no country in  the  whole\r\n\r\nof   South-East  Asia  can  excel  Singapore  in  the  field  of\r\n\r\neducation. We spend so much money on training and educating  our\r\n\r\nnext  generation  and  turning  them  into  useful  citizens  of\r\n\r\ntomorrow.  We do not have to go to a far country for  a  factual\r\n\r\ncomparison.  Just look at Indonesia, which is a close  neighbour\r\n\r\nand which is a country admired by the Barisan Sosialis. How much\r\n\r\ndo they spend on education every year? Is it 5 per cent of their\r\n\r\ntotal  expenditure or less? We spend so much money in  order  to\r\n\r\neducate our next generation and to make them nation builders  of\r\n\r\nthe  future. But in Indonesia, the situation is different.  Some\r\n\r\n70 per\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncent  of  their  Government expenditure is  spent  on  armament,\r\n\r\nmilitary expansion and on the purchase of ammunition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Thomson also said just now that we\r\n\r\ntried  to  monopolise education. I do not know what he meant  by\r\n\r\nthat,  because  up  to  now  anyone  who  is  enthusiastic   and\r\n\r\ninterested in education and is prepared to donate or establish a\r\n\r\nprivate  school is always welcomed. No one will object  to  this\r\n\r\nkind  move  and charitable inclinations. So when the Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson said that we monopolise education, I really do not  know\r\n\r\nwhat he meant. But if he says that we restrict the activities of\r\n\r\npro-Communist elements in schools, then I admit that this is so.\r\n\r\nIf  he says that restriction of activities by Communist elements\r\n\r\nin schools is to monopolise education, then my reply is that this\r\n\r\nis what it should be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson also touched on Nanyang University\r\n\r\nwhich,  before  the reorganisation, received generous  donations\r\n\r\nfrom  the  public,  such as from trishaw  riders,  hawkers,  and\r\n\r\nmembers of the business community. He also said that these  donations  are  not forthcoming any more. I have to tell the  Member\r\n\r\nthat,  in  fact, such donations ceased before the reorganisation\r\n\r\nof  Nanyang University because the enthusiasts were aware of the\r\n\r\ndomination of Nanyang University by Communist elements, and they\r\n\r\nwere quite dissatisfied with the anti-national activities of the\r\n\r\npro-Communist elements in the University. So even as far back as\r\n\r\na   few  years  ago  before  reorganisation  took  place,   such\r\n\r\ncontributions stopped. No one contributed any more.  We  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  to  mention trishaw riders and hawkers to  illustrate.  We\r\n\r\nonly need to mention the business community and the sponsors  of\r\n\r\nNanyang  University. They have lost confidence in the University\r\n\r\nand  they  did  not contribute any more to it. I  can  give  two\r\n\r\nillustrations. Take, for example, Tan Lark Sye,  who  agreed  to\r\n\r\ndonate  some $5 million. He has actually paid only $2.3 million,\r\n\r\nalthough he has agreed to donate $5 million. Whether he wants to\r\n\r\ncontribute\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfurther or not. I would not know. Another example is the Nanyang\r\n\r\nSiang  Pau, which is also one of the sponsors. They have  agreed\r\n\r\nto donate $1 million by instalments of $100,000 a year. Now what\r\n\r\nhappens  to  them? Up to date they have only paid  $100,000.  In\r\n\r\nfact, when they agreed to donate $1 million, great publicity was\r\n\r\ngiven to it. But what happens today? The situation is clear  for\r\n\r\neveryone  to see. A further example is Shaw Brothers Ltd,  which\r\n\r\nhave  agreed  to donate $250,000, but have actually  paid  about\r\n\r\n$50,000. So enthusiasm in Nanyang University has dwindled. If he\r\n\r\nsays  that the dwindling of this enthusiasm is due to  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  Nanyang University is under the control of the Government,\r\n\r\nthen  we  have  to refute it. No one can put the  blame  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. If he says that the loss of enthusiasm is  connected\r\n\r\nwith  the reorganisation of Nanyang University, then how can  he\r\n\r\naccount  for  the facts I have already given? Even the  sponsors\r\n\r\nthemselves  have  not contributed what they  already  agreed  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  before the reorganisation. This,  of  course,  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter entirely left to the donors themselves. No one can  force\r\n\r\nanyone to contribute or donate. But one can assume that since  a\r\n\r\ncertain  person has agreed to contribute a certain sum, then  it\r\n\r\nis  his  responsibility  to pay up whatever  he  has  agreed  to\r\n\r\ndonate. I have already given examples to show certain people who\r\n\r\nhave  not  paid  up  the amounts they agreed to  before  the  reorganisation.  All this deadening of enthusiasm is  attributable\r\n\r\nto   the   activities  of  pro-Communist  elements  in   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.  They  organised  anti-national  activities  in  the\r\n\r\nUniversity campus. That accounted for the loss of confidence  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  in the University and their refusal to pay  up  any\r\n\r\nfurther. If you want to find out the cause of the faults, then I\r\n\r\nwill  say that Members of the Barisan Sosialis are wholly to  be\r\n\r\nblamed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir, the Minister\r\n\r\nhimself  has  admitted  the fact without  our  asking  him  that\r\n\r\nsponsors of Nanyang University have not been paying up under the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresent  Government.  In  fact,  Mr  Tan  Lark  Sye  has   paid\r\n\r\n$2,300,000  and  the  Nanyang Siang Pau has paid  [Interruption]\r\n\r\nmore  than $100,000 and Shaw Brothers have paid $50,000 although\r\n\r\nthey promised a larger sum. I would like to ask the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation  this  question:  have  these  sponsors  notified  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education that they would not --- [Interruption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The topic under discussion is the policy\r\n\r\nof  the  Government on education. In passing. Nanyang University\r\n\r\nwas  mentioned  by the Member, and in passing the  Minister  has\r\n\r\nreplied.  I  will  not  allow a debate  to  develop  on  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now I was talking about\r\n\r\neducation by the people themselves. If the Government  does  not\r\n\r\nmonopolise education, then this will benefit the people. If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  takes  this advice, then the money  can  be  put  to\r\n\r\nbetter  use,  such  as  improving the lot  of  the  people.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, in the case of Nanyang University, the donations could\r\n\r\nhave continued. But up to date the Government has not encouraged\r\n\r\ncommunity education. It is because the P.A.P. want to monopolise\r\n\r\nthis field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture has blamed the pro-Communists and the\r\n\r\nanti-nationals for this mess. I will talk about this later on. \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch upon a certain mistake the Government has\r\n\r\nmade.  The  P.A.P.  Government is  not  willing  to  change  the\r\n\r\ncolonial  type of education even up till now. Has the Government\r\n\r\nplanned the students' future after they have left school? During\r\n\r\nthe  colonial  period, the students were faced with unemployment\r\n\r\nafter  they left school. Today the situation is still the  same.\r\n\r\nTheir parents have spent a lot of money on their education.  Now\r\n\r\nafter  leaving  school, they have to spend  their  time  on  the\r\n\r\nroads.  The  P.A.P. Government will have to solve this  problem.\r\n\r\nMany  pupils  find  it  difficult to get  any  employment  after\r\n\r\nleaving  school.  In this respect, the P.A.P. Government  should\r\n\r\ntry to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabolish  the  colonial system of education. They should  develop\r\n\r\ncommunity education, that is education by the people themselves.\r\n\r\nThey  have  been in power for one year. They have not given  any\r\n\r\nhelp  to solve the problem of unemployment. Even when Sabah  and\r\n\r\nSarawak  are  short  of  workers,  they  recruit  workers   from\r\n\r\nHongkong,  the Philippines and Taiwan. They are not  willing  to\r\n\r\nrecruit our school leavers who are unemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point is this. The P.A.P. Government is looking down\r\n\r\nupon  community education - education by the people  themselves.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a well-known fact. Even in recent years, according  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  statement on the number  of  primary \r\n\r\nschool-leavers  joining  secondary schools, there has been  a  definite\r\n\r\neffect  as  a  result  of  their  policy  to  destroy  community\r\n\r\neducation.  There  were  32,000 primary  school-leavers  in  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  stream. In the Chinese stream there was  an  equivalent\r\n\r\nnumber. I would urge the Minister for Education not to carry  on\r\n\r\nwith  this policy of discrimination any further. I will  explain\r\n\r\nlater on the increase in the number of entrants into the English\r\n\r\nstream. In respect of Chinese schools, there was a fewer  number\r\n\r\nof  pupils, and as a result, teachers were retrenched because of\r\n\r\nredundancy. Last year, the Ministry of Education sacked a number\r\n\r\nof   teachers   on  account  of  their  so-called  anti-national\r\n\r\nactivities. The total number is 200. This year, 18 teachers in a\r\n\r\ncertain  primary  school were said to be redundant.  In  another\r\n\r\nprimary  school, 14 teachers were said to be redundant. I  think\r\n\r\nthere will be more redundancy in the other primary schools.  How\r\n\r\nwill  the Minister for Education deal with this matter? Will  he\r\n\r\nretrench  more  teachers on security grounds? They  have  talked\r\n\r\nabout pro-Communists and Communist activities as an excuse.  All\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  bluff  in order to pacify the public.  Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education has other plans to deal with this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, the Minister for Education announced that there\r\n\r\nwill  be a second language to be studied as a compulsory subject\r\n\r\nin the schools. I think the purpose is to absorb those redundant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nteachers from Chinese schools into English schools. I would  say\r\n\r\nthat  if the policy in regard to Chinese schools is not changed,\r\n\r\nthen the number of Chinese schools will dwindle in future. There\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  enough  English schools to absorb  the  redundant\r\n\r\nteachers  from the Chinese schools. So the basic remedy  is  for\r\n\r\nthe Government to strike at the root of the problem. This is  to\r\n\r\nimplement  their self-proclaimed policy of equality of treatment\r\n\r\nto all the four streams of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education said a few days ago that the choice\r\n\r\nof a school lies in the hands of the parents concerned, and that the \r\n\r\nGovernment has no right to interfere. But, in actual  fact,\r\n\r\nthe   Government  has  not  built  enough  Chinese  schools   to\r\n\r\naccommodate the number of pupils who are willing to study in the\r\n\r\nChinese  stream. When the parents find that there is no  Chinese\r\n\r\nschool in the neighbourhood, they have to send their children to\r\n\r\nthe  English  schools. The authorities concerned are  making  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  for the parents to enrol in Chinese schools.  In  the\r\n\r\ncity  areas,  the  Government have been  building  many  English\r\n\r\nschools  in  the midst of quite a number of Chinese schools.  In\r\n\r\nthe  satellite towns there are no Chinese schools. The residents\r\n\r\nthere  are finding it impossible for them to send their children\r\n\r\nto  Chinese  schools.  As  a result, they  have  to  send  their\r\n\r\nchildren to English schools in the neighbourhood or inside  that\r\n\r\narea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving school, there is no equality of employment\r\n\r\nopportunity for the different streams of education, it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible  for  school-leavers from the Chinese schools  to  find\r\n\r\nemployment. I think the Minister for Education has given  a  few\r\n\r\nfigures just to bluff the people. He says that about 40 per cent\r\n\r\nof   primary   school  students  have  failed  in  the   primary\r\n\r\nexamination,  and that a certain percentage of  them  have  been\r\n\r\nadmitted into vocational secondary schools. Some have been asked\r\n\r\nto   stay  back.  The  actual  number  of  schoolleavers   being\r\n\r\neliminated  is  very  small. It is one  per  cent.  Nobody  will\r\n\r\nbelieve the claim made by the Minister for Education that  about\r\n\r\none per cent of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npupils was eliminated. The P.A.P. is exercising its power to\r\n\r\nstrangle community education. I can give more examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever the P.A.P. do not want to build more primary schools,\r\n\r\nthey   send   primary  school-leavers  to  join  the   so-called\r\n\r\nvocational  schools. What the Minister for  Education  dare  not\r\n\r\ndisclose  is the fact that they will conduct courses at  random.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no  advanced  preparation, either  in  the  field  of\r\n\r\ntechnical  education  or  vocational  education.  Thus  no  good\r\n\r\nresults  are obtained from this kind of education policy.  There\r\n\r\nare  other  difficulties, such as the shortage of classrooms  or\r\n\r\nteachers.  I  think of giving another example to illustrate  the\r\n\r\nfact.  The  Government  is  trying to  develop  industries.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, in Toa Payoh, there is a school called Chi Hua Chinese\r\n\r\nSchool.  This  school has received orders from the Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation to close down. This is most unreasonable on  the  part\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister, if the Government want to make  use  of  that\r\n\r\npiece of land, they should try to get another piece of land as a\r\n\r\nsubstitute to build this old school. They should not just  close\r\n\r\nit  down.  For  instance, on the 8th October,  1964,  a  certain\r\n\r\nschool was broken into by Government authorities. They have thus\r\n\r\nleft  the Chinese schools no choice. The pupils especially  have\r\n\r\nno chance to study in the schools. All these are concrete facts.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister cannot deny this. They are trying by  every  means\r\n\r\npossible to destroy community education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am a trade unionist.

If these people cannot protect Chinese education, do you\r\n\r\nthink four of you are going to protect Chinese education?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member must address the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I am sorry. Sir, doubts may be lurking in the\r\n\r\nminds  of  a  few Members of the Barisan Sosialis while  we  are\r\n\r\ndebating the vote of the Ministry of Education. Any State  which\r\n\r\nwants to prosper should necessarily pay enough attention to  the\r\n\r\nbudding  generation so that in a matter of a decade or two,  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  the  population would  necessarily  be  of  a  high\r\n\r\nstandard and the State's programme for industrialisation will be\r\n\r\ncarried  out in an efficient manner by skilled intelligence  and\r\n\r\nenlightened   manpower.  Singapore  has  one  of  the   youngest\r\n\r\npopulations in Asia, and as such, more attention must be paid to\r\n\r\nthe  budding youths who are going to be leaders of the  country.\r\n\r\nNaturally education should be of paramount importance. No effort\r\n\r\nshould  be  spared  to see that the children receive  sufficient\r\n\r\neducation to equip themselves, before they attain manhood,  with\r\n\r\nsufficient  knowledge to tackle any situation and  to  implement\r\n\r\nconstructive  programmes of development of  the  State  but,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  not  to propagate the Soekarno line and  the  Communist\r\n\r\nline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the colonial era, sufficient emphasis was laid on a good\r\n\r\neducation  policy  and  the  little amount  that  was  spent  on\r\n\r\neducation   was  to  train  a  microscopic  group  of   colonial\r\n\r\norientated white-collar workers who would necessarily  form  the\r\n\r\nthird  rank of the British bureaucratic machinery and who  would\r\n\r\nnecessarily  have  to  safeguard  the  economic  and   political\r\n\r\ninterests  of Her Majesty's Government. The attainment  of  full\r\n\r\ninternal  self-government and the eventual formation of Malaysia\r\n\r\nhas  resulted in the realisation of the necessity to  train  the\r\n\r\nyouths  to  shoulder the nation's responsibilities and  also  to\r\n\r\nreorientate their thinking in terms of one nation. The  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party  has already succeeded in infusing the  spirit  of\r\n\r\nnationalism  during the past decade and after  coming  to  power\r\n\r\nthrough   the  ballot  box,  we  decided  to  implement   social\r\n\r\nprogrammes and policies. As part\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia,  we will strive to achieve industrial  prosperity.\r\n\r\nBut  man-power resources are equally important for any  plan  or\r\n\r\nprogramme to succeed. Otherwise, the blue-print will continue to\r\n\r\nremain  in  cold storage. Sir, that exactly is the  reason  why,\r\n\r\napart from encouraging education through the English medium,  we\r\n\r\nhave  also  decided to give equal importance to the other  three\r\n\r\nstreams  of  languages spoken by the three  different  races  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The   colonial  approach  of  encouraging   English\r\n\r\neducation  resulted  in creating a small  minority  of \r\n\r\nwestern-orientated  gentlemen,  while the masses remained  ignorant  and\r\n\r\nnaturally   submissive   to   the  colonial   power.   But   the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  the various plans of the P.A.P. during  the\r\n\r\npast few years has resulted in the renaissance in this State,  a\r\n\r\nrenaissance  which perhaps can be favourably compared  with  the\r\n\r\nrenaissance in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are marching forward and this estimate of expenditure for\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  of  Education  provides  further  proof  of  our\r\n\r\ndetermination  to educate the masses along the right  lines  and\r\n\r\nalso infuse the spirit of nationhood, the spirit of progress and\r\n\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since we have succeeded so far, we cannot understand why\r\n\r\nwe  should  not  succeed in the immediate future.  This  is  the\r\n\r\nspirit  in  which the Barisan should welcome the  withdrawal  of\r\n\r\ntheir  amendment. It is possible that some of the  pro-Communist\r\n\r\nelements,  who  have no faith in democracy, but  who  happen  to\r\n\r\nremain  in  this  democratic institution, will  turn  round  and\r\n\r\naccuse  and  abuse  the Government of some  omissions.  We  have\r\n\r\nwithstood  such destructive criticisms earlier and we  can  very\r\n\r\nwell  afford  to  tolerate them since we  know  full  well  that\r\n\r\nSoekarno's  running dogs bark, but the democratic  caravan  goes\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Member for Thomson moved\r\n\r\nthe amendment to reduce the whole amount allocated\r\n\r\nto  the Ministry of Education, we would have thought that he had\r\n\r\nsomething constructive to suggest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  to  propose  in the matter of policy. But  the  very  feeble\r\n\r\nattempt  to  criticise  minor aspects of the  general  education\r\n\r\npolicy, which was started in 1959, only shows the bankruptcy  in\r\n\r\nthe  thinking of not only the Member for Thomson, but of the lot\r\n\r\nof  the Barisan Sosialis Members opposite. If I heard the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson right, he said that the Government was monopolising\r\n\r\neducation. Like the Minister for Education, I was also wondering\r\n\r\nwhat  he meant when he said that the Government was monopolising\r\n\r\neducation  in  Singapore.  I  was  also  wondering  whether,  by\r\n\r\nmonopoly  in education, he meant that the Government was  taking\r\n\r\nvery firm and positive action against subversion in the schools,\r\n\r\nor  whether  he meant that the Government was carrying  out  its\r\n\r\nobligations  to open up schools for the people, to  find  places\r\n\r\nfor  all  children who need places in schools, giving capitation\r\n\r\ngrants  to  schools  in all the four language  streams,  capital\r\n\r\ngrants for new schools. If he interprets all that as a monopoly,\r\n\r\nthen it is a monopoly whereby the Government is carrying out its\r\n\r\nduty  and its obligations to meet the educational needs  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of the various races in Singapore, giving equal treatment\r\n\r\nto  the schools in the four language streams. If, of course,  by\r\n\r\nmonopoly  he meant that we were taking firm action as we  should\r\n\r\nand  we will do in future, then that is also monopoly. For  that\r\n\r\nmatter,  he  mentioned  also  about  200  teachers  having  been\r\n\r\ndismissed from the schools last year. I have no doubt whatsoever\r\n\r\nthat  if more of the types who were dismissed last year were  to\r\n\r\nmake  their  appearance  in  the  future,  they  will  also   be\r\n\r\ndismissed. If that is monopoly in education, so it will be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member had nothing constructive to offer.\r\n\r\nSince 1959, we have promoted an education system which is moving\r\n\r\nslowly  and  steadily towards a national education system.  Much\r\n\r\nhas  been done in the way of removing the colonial aspect of the\r\n\r\nold  education system, and the first aspect which comes to  mind\r\n\r\nis,  of  course, the syllabus content. There is today  a  common\r\n\r\nsyllabus content in the schools of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  four  language  streams. There are no  more  geography  and\r\n\r\nhistory  and possibly literature, whether in the Chinese schools\r\n\r\nor  in  the  English schools, which were orientated  to  foreign\r\n\r\ncountries. Much has been done also in the fields of science  and\r\n\r\nmathematics  which  have all gone towards promoting  a  national\r\n\r\neducation  system. The Member for Thomson is either ignorant  of\r\n\r\nthese things, or he is afraid to mention them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of equal treatment for the four language streams of\r\n\r\neducation  in Singapore has won the support of the people.  This\r\n\r\nis  best  illustrated in the results of the last elections  when\r\n\r\nthe  people  overwhelmingly supported the Government  and,  more\r\n\r\nparticularly,  because in the last three years since  the\r\n\r\nanti-national and the pro-Communist elements had decided to go  where\r\n\r\nthey  belonged, there has not been any serious criticism of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's education policy of giving equal treatment  to  the\r\n\r\nfour language streams. The incidents of 1955, 1956 and 1961 were\r\n\r\ncompletely  out  of  the picture in the last  three  years.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson also very conveniently forgets about  this.\r\n\r\nThe  education policy which we are carrying out in Singapore has\r\n\r\nthe   widest  possible  support  of  the  people,  because   the\r\n\r\ncontradictions  which used to exist in the education  policy  in\r\n\r\nthose  days before the P.A.P. came to power have, by and  large,\r\n\r\nbeen removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the Member for Thomson's criticism of the children\r\n\r\nwho  he imagines have to leave school when they fail the Primary\r\n\r\nVI  School  Leaving Examination, he also does not seem  to  know\r\n\r\nthat  the  minimum school-leaving age in Singapore today  is  15\r\n\r\nplus  years  and it goes on right until 16 plus,  if  the  child\r\n\r\nprefers  to  remain  in school. He tries to say  that  what  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has said about the one per cent who have had to  leave\r\n\r\nschool in the last two or three years as something which he  can\r\n\r\nnot  believe.  Well,  whether the Member for  Thomson  wants  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  it  or not, of course, is not for us to decide.  If  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not want to accept the truth as truth, then he can believe\r\n\r\nin all the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthings he wants to believe. Probably if Indonesia says that  the\r\n\r\npercentage  there is higher and he wants to believe the  figures\r\n\r\ndished  out  by  Professor  Priono,  who  is  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  there,  then  he  can jolly  well  believe  what  the\r\n\r\nIndonesians want to tell him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, throughout the speech of the Member for\r\n\r\nThomson,  I heard the term \"community education\". I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhether the translation --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Communal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche A. Rahim Ishak:</b> --- was accurate. It is as the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth  has said a moment ago - \"communal education\". The Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson is only interested in communal education.  Probably\r\n\r\nhe used a Mandarin term which meant \"racial education\", which is\r\n\r\nno  better.  We  talk of a national education  system.  We  work\r\n\r\ntowards  the  promotion  of  a national  education  system.  But\r\n\r\neverytime he opens his mouth to talk about education, it is \"community  education\", which, of course, as far as he is concerned,\r\n\r\nis Chinese education in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy which we have carried out for the last five years\r\n\r\ngives equal treatment to all the four language streams. As  much\r\n\r\nas  we  talk  of  education in the English stream,  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nstream, the Tamil stream, or the Malay stream, we want to  bring\r\n\r\nprogress  and improvements in education and teaching  standards,\r\n\r\nand  increase  the number of teachers to meet the  shortages  as\r\n\r\nthey arise. We give thought to all streams of education and  not\r\n\r\nonly  to  one  stream. Where one particular  stream  is  lagging\r\n\r\nbehind,  as  in  the  case of the Malays where  they  never  had\r\n\r\nsecondary  education  in the whole long  history  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthen,  of  course, secondary education is provided for them.  We\r\n\r\nbring  equitable treatment to all streams. With us there  is  no\r\n\r\nsuch thing as talking about one communal stream alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is nothing more which the Member for\r\n\r\nThomson,  or for that matter any one of them on the other  side,\r\n\r\ncan  offer  in  a constructive manner for the education  of  the\r\n\r\npeople\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  At  best they can only try to criticise  without\r\n\r\nreally  being able to offer constructive suggestions  which  are\r\n\r\nreally  for the benefit of the people. Whatever amendments  they\r\n\r\nare  going to make will, for the rest of the evening, run  along\r\n\r\nthe same lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government\r\n\r\nMembers  have  not given me satisfactory answers to  the  points\r\n\r\nwhich  I  raised.  They have raised other issues,  like  pro-Com\r\n\r\nmunists and Indonesia. These are not pertinent to the question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now when I raised the point of community education, the\r\n\r\nGovernment side confused it with communal education. I  did  not\r\n\r\nsay  \"communal  education\" but \"community education\".  Community\r\n\r\neducation  applies to Chinese education and Malay  education  as\r\n\r\nwell.  How  much  has  the Government  done  for  this  type  of\r\n\r\neducation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now talk on what the Parliamentary Secretary has said\r\n\r\nabout  the support given by the people to the Government on  its\r\n\r\neducation  policy.  I  ask  him  to  forget  about  last  year's\r\n\r\nelections. Malaysia is a disgraceful thing. If that  is  a  true\r\n\r\nreflection  of  the people's wishes, then Ngo  Dinh  Diem  would\r\n\r\nstill be the President of South Vietnam today. In every election\r\n\r\nin  the past, Ngo Dinh Diem received the majority support of the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us forget about the past. Let us talk of facts. In regard\r\n\r\nto   the  P.A.P.'s  monopoly  of  education,  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary said he did not understand what I was saying.  It  was\r\n\r\nbecause I was picking out some unpleasant facts for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year about 200 teachers and principals were dismissed. We\r\n\r\ncan  talk  about these things. After this happened,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers  straightaway wanted to become principals.  This  is  an\r\n\r\nopen secret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Jurong, there are some schools where the principals are now\r\n\r\nP.A.P. supporters and relatives of P.A.P. members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Their names, please?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Do they want me to reveal the\r\n\r\nnames? In Upper Serangoon there is a Chinese school whose\r\n\r\nprincipal is now a P.A.P. member. He was previously an Arts\r\n\r\nteacher. This is clear evidence of their monopolising of\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Thomson area there is a school. The ex-principal was\r\n\r\ndetained  and a P.A.P. member was put in his place as principal.\r\n\r\nThis individual was a member of the preparatory committee of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. concert held there. Do you want me to reveal names? I can\r\n\r\ndo so. This clearly shows that the Government is misusing public\r\n\r\nfunds to employ their own people in the education field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Federal elections last year, the schools in\r\n\r\nSingapore  were  not on vacation. There were  some  school  principals who went to the Federation to do electioneering work  for\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. They forgot about their schools. I have got the facts\r\n\r\nand  evidence, if they want me to reveal names, I can do so  one\r\n\r\nby one. If this is not monopolising education, what is?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did I go? I was not a teacher. I could go. I was not using the\r\n\r\nGovernment's money. These are facts which they cannot refute.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  wish  to  follow the P.A.P. practice of  saying  things\r\n\r\nbehind the backs of people. I do not wish to reveal the names of\r\n\r\nthese people.

Are these  not  constructive\r\n\r\ncriticisms?  I  requested the Government to encourage  community\r\n\r\neducation.   Is  this  not  constructive  criticism?   Community\r\n\r\neducation will bring benefits to the country and the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the Primary school-leaving examination, my suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  it  should be abolished is another constructive criticism.\r\n\r\nThey talk about Jakarta, Soekarno, Russia, China.
