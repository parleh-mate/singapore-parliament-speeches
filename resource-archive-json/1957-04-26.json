They are faced with a number  of\r\n\r\ndisadvantages.  We are aware that ships  call  not\r\n\r\nonly  at  Singapore  but also  at  such  ports  as\r\n\r\nPenang, Port Swettenham, Malacca, Kuching  and  so\r\n\r\non.  If  the  roster  system is  disliked  by  the\r\n\r\nshipowners and they decide that they are going  to\r\n\r\ndestroy  it, then unless a parallel roster  system\r\n\r\ncould  be  instituted in other  ports,  employment\r\n\r\nwould  then  be  taken, not in Singapore,  but  in\r\n\r\nother  Malaysia ports. I therefore  query  whether\r\n\r\nthis roster system is going to help our seamen  or\r\n\r\nwhether  it is going to prevent them from  further\r\n\r\ngetting  employment. It is very unwise,  I  think,\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore to start this roster  system  until\r\n\r\nother  governments,  such as  the  Federation  and\r\n\r\nSarawak,  start  a similar one. Seamen  will  then\r\n\r\nhave a better chance of getting a job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told that this roster system is prompted by\r\n\r\nthe  desire to eliminate bribery. The question  of\r\n\r\nbribery is now being taken up by Government  which\r\n\r\nis  appointing  a commission to enquire  into  it.\r\n\r\nBribery   should   be  stamped   out.   There   is\r\n\r\nadministrative difficulty; but this  problem  must\r\n\r\nbe  eradicated and we cannot eradicate it by  just\r\n\r\nhaving  a  roster system. Let the people  who  are\r\n\r\nconcerned  come forward to Government  and  report\r\n\r\nthose   people  who  are  responsible   for   such\r\n\r\ndeplorable  acts which deny reasonable  employment\r\n\r\nto seamen unless they bribe. Let them come forward\r\n\r\nand  complain  to  the Government  and  bring  the\r\n\r\nculprits  to  book. If Government will  take  very\r\n\r\nstrong  action  on this, then that aspect  of  the\r\n\r\nargument will be met. However, if Government feels\r\n\r\nthat this roster system will help the seamen - but I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think  it  will - then  I  would  like  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to think carefully about it.  Let  the\r\n\r\nsystem  be given a trial, if it must have a trial,\r\n\r\nbut let it be for a fixed period. If the result is\r\n\r\nthat   it   is   not   going  to   create   better\r\n\r\nopportunities of employment for seamen,  then  the\r\n\r\nsystem  must  be dropped. The idea of this  roster\r\n\r\nsystem  is to protect our seamen. If it  fails  in\r\n\r\nits  aim,  then  we must think of  other  ways  of\r\n\r\nprotecting  them.  I am of the opinion  that  this\r\n\r\nsystem  will not achieve this aim and I  wish  the\r\n\r\nGovernment would reconsider it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.15 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I  would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister for Commerce and Industry\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is not a fact that under  the  roster\r\n\r\nsystem the seaman will lose his freedom of choice.\r\n\r\nHe  has to take whatever job is offered to him  by\r\n\r\nthe  vessel  or the shipping company,  whether  he\r\n\r\nlikes it or not, in order to secure employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Hon. the Minister for Commerce and\r\n\r\nIndustry mentioned how a ship could have a  multi-racial  crew  and  yet at the same  time  work  in\r\n\r\nharmony.  He  mentioned, for example - it  does  not\r\n\r\nreally  matter if I quote him accurately - that  the\r\n\r\nengine-room  hands,  for instance,  might  all  be\r\n\r\nHainanese. Now I would like to ask: supposing  the\r\n\r\nmaster  of  a  vessel required  two  engine-hands,\r\n\r\nwould  he,  in the ordinary way of things,  seeing\r\n\r\nthat  his choice is restricted to two rosters,  be\r\n\r\nable to get the men he wanted?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto make a few points and also ask a few questions.\r\n\r\nWill  the roster system consist of seamen  of  all\r\n\r\nraces  and of all nationalities, or is the  system\r\n\r\nmeant to protect only our local men? If it is  for\r\n\r\nall seamen, is it not our duty to do first justice\r\n\r\nto  our  seamen  who  may  remain  unemployed?  If\r\n\r\neveryone has a chance, it may be that our own  men\r\n\r\nmay be last on the roster. Is there any preference\r\n\r\ngiven to them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protests have been made by the ship-owners in\r\n\r\nregard to the roster system when employing seamen.\r\n\r\nOn  the  other  hand, I understand the  Government\r\n\r\nwants  the  roster system to protect  our  seamen.\r\n\r\n\"Our  seamen\"  means  I hope those  who  are  born\r\n\r\nlocally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two aspects to the problem. Some\r\n\r\nsay  that because of the roster system, seamen may\r\n\r\nnot  have  sufficient opportunities for employment\r\n\r\nwhether  they are of Indian, Pakistan, Chinese  or\r\n\r\nIndonesian nationality and that they may  have  to\r\n\r\ngo to other ports in search of employment, and the\r\n\r\nships might avoid Singapore to get men of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  choice.  That is the shipowners'  point  of\r\n\r\nview. If that happens, of course, we are bound  to\r\n\r\nlose.  The  other  side of the  argument  is  that\r\n\r\nSingapore   is   the   only  port   which   offers\r\n\r\nopportunities to the employers to pick and  choose\r\n\r\nseamen  of any nationality. Sir, there are certain\r\n\r\nshipping  lines which employ only Chinese  seamen.\r\n\r\nThere  are  others which employ only  Indians  and\r\n\r\nPakistanis.  There are still others  which  employ\r\n\r\nonly  Indonesians. Sir, Singapore is a good market\r\n\r\nfor employment for seamen, but if we have a roster\r\n\r\nsystem, the situation might arise where a shipping\r\n\r\ncompany  might find trouble in getting  the  right\r\n\r\nmen  because  the seamen selected  for  employment\r\n\r\nmight  not  fit  in with the other seamen  already\r\n\r\nemployed; so the shipping company might have to go\r\n\r\nelsewhere  for seamen. However, I have  no  strong\r\n\r\nviews about this. If our seamen suffer as a result\r\n\r\nof  this  roster system, then the Government  will\r\n\r\nhave to amend the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy)</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, Sir. Mr Chairman, the\r\n\r\nfirst and most important misunderstanding which is\r\n\r\nin  the  mind of the Member for Serangoon is  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  might lose trade as a result  of  ships\r\n\r\nbeing  diverted to other ports because they cannot\r\n\r\nrecruit seamen here as they like. That is  a  very\r\n\r\nfallacious  argument. Ships come  to  a  port  not\r\n\r\nsolely for the purpose of recruiting seamen.  They\r\n\r\ndo  so primarily if an inducement offers. If  they\r\n\r\ncan get cargo and it is paying, they will come  to\r\n\r\na port, if they recruit seamen while at that port,\r\n\r\nit  is  just  incidental, if the  port  facilities\r\n\r\noffer it. They may perhaps stop at an intermediate\r\n\r\nport  on  their route if there is urgent necessity\r\n\r\nto  recruit seamen, but they will not  go  out  of\r\n\r\ntheir  way just to recruit them; and therefore  if\r\n\r\nthere is any loss, it is not going to be a loss of\r\n\r\ncommerce to Singapore, a loss of shipping, a  loss\r\n\r\nof  transport facilities or diversion of  shipping\r\n\r\naway  from Singapore, but it is going to be solely\r\n\r\na   matter  of  losing  employment  for  Singapore\r\n\r\nseamen. So let us get\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis   point  clear - it  is  not  going  to  be   a\r\n\r\ncommercial loss to Singapore, it is going to be  a\r\n\r\nloss  to  seamen as far as gaining  employment  is\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked the representatives of the Seamen's\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  Action pointblank in Committee:  \"Are\r\n\r\nyou  prepared to take the risk of shipowners going\r\n\r\nto  some  other port to recruit?\" And  they  said,\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we are prepared to take the risk because  we\r\n\r\nare thoroughly fed up with the manner in which the\r\n\r\nseamen  are  being exploited here  in  Singapore.\"\r\n\r\nSir, these people were the representatives of  all\r\n\r\nthe  unions  in  Singapore. Should  the  Committee\r\n\r\naccept  their word as representing the  wishes  of\r\n\r\nthe  seamen, or should it accept the word of  some\r\n\r\nship-owners who said that, in spite of the unions'\r\n\r\nassurances  that  they wanted the  roster  system,\r\n\r\nthey  knew that the seamen would not want it? This\r\n\r\nis  not  in accordance with democratic principles.\r\n\r\nIf you have representatives nominated by a certain\r\n\r\nbody,  it is their views that you should  take  as\r\n\r\nbeing  representative of that section. You  cannot\r\n\r\nclaim  the oppositions views as representing them.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if there is any diversion of recruiting\r\n\r\nseamen away from Singapore to other ports, and  as\r\n\r\na  result  the seamen suffer, the best  thing  for\r\n\r\nthem to do is to throw out the representatives who\r\n\r\ncame    to   the   Select   Committee   to    make\r\n\r\nrepresentations  and  appoint   a   new   set   of\r\n\r\nrepresentatives    and   get    them    to    make\r\n\r\nrepresentations  to  Government  to  abolish  this\r\n\r\nprovision in the Ordinance. If that happens  after\r\n\r\ngiving the roster system a fair trial - it will take\r\n\r\na  year to implement it in the first instance - I am\r\n\r\nsure  that  the Minister (whoever he  is  at  that\r\n\r\nmoment)   will  take  steps  to  prevent  anything\r\n\r\ndetrimental  happening  to  the  people  or  to  a\r\n\r\nsection  of the people of Singapore and  therefore\r\n\r\nsteps will be taken to rescind that portion of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon raised the point as to\r\n\r\nhow  we  are going to help the Malays  if  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing to have a sectional or racial register. What\r\n\r\nhappens  if one particular race is not represented\r\n\r\non  the  register?  I think a  similar  point  was\r\n\r\ntouched upon by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember  for  Telok Ayer. Sir, when I  mentioned  a\r\n\r\nseparate register for Malays, a separate  one  for\r\n\r\nChinese which is subdivided into sections for  the\r\n\r\nvarious  clans,  the same system  could  apply  to\r\n\r\nother  races. But if there are not many seamen  of\r\n\r\nother  races,  probably we could  have  a  general\r\n\r\nroster   for   them:  for  example,  Indians   and\r\n\r\nPakistanis.  These seamen are only  a  handful  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The majority of seamen are Malays  and\r\n\r\nChinese. Therefore it does not mean that the other\r\n\r\nraces  who  are domiciled here would suffer  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  this  roster. But we  cannot  force  a\r\n\r\nshipowner  to  take on a person of a certain  race\r\n\r\nwhom  he does not want, because that would not  be\r\n\r\nconducive to a happy atmosphere on board the ship.\r\n\r\nSo if a shipowner wants two Hainanese, he could go\r\n\r\nstraight  on  to  the Hainanese category  of  that\r\n\r\nroster   and   recruit   them.   But   which   two\r\n\r\nHainanese - Mr A and Mr B, or Mr  C  and  Mr  D?\r\n\r\nThat   is  where,  as  far  as  the  employer   is\r\n\r\nconcerned, the shoe pinches - I know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now seamen from other territories cannot go on\r\n\r\nto  this register in Singapore. They are barred by\r\n\r\nthis  Ordinance.  But seamen could  be  signed  on\r\n\r\noutside,  say Hongkong, and brought to  Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot  stop that because those are reciprocal\r\n\r\nfacilities  which  other ports offer  to  us.  Our\r\n\r\nseamen  can  be signed on here and flown  over  to\r\n\r\nHongkong or Sydney or any other port and taken  on\r\n\r\nboard there, and if we stop that, then those other\r\n\r\ncountries will stop the same facilities to our seamen. It is possible that Penang or Malacca or Port\r\n\r\nSwettenham might have a better system of selecting\r\n\r\ncrews and thereby attract shipowners to make their\r\n\r\nselection of seamen there, but in the past it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  proved,  as the Member for  Telok  Ayer  has\r\n\r\npointed  out,  that Singapore can offer  the  most\r\n\r\nmultiracial type of crews, and most of the  Malays\r\n\r\nwho  are  recruited from Singapore are  Federation\r\n\r\nmen - they are from Malacca and Johore. Besides, not\r\n\r\nall  the  ships  which call at Singapore  call  at\r\n\r\nMalacca.  In  fact, I do not think  any  big  ship\r\n\r\ncalls  at Malacca, and only some of them  call  at\r\n\r\nPenang and Port Swettenham. Our immigration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlaws are tight. We do not allow any seamen to come\r\n\r\ninto Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is not the result of my being\r\n\r\nmoved  by  the  pleas of the Seamen's  Council  of\r\n\r\nAction to do something for the seamen. I have been\r\n\r\nin  the Ministry watching how things are going on,\r\n\r\nand  my heart bleeds for these unfortunate seamen.\r\n\r\nI  have  not got the eloquent language  which  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill has at his command, but I say\r\n\r\nin  all sincerity that I feel sorry for them. They\r\n\r\nare in fact in a much worse plight than the clerks\r\n\r\nare, because they are not educated. So if you talk\r\n\r\nof  asking them to go and report corruption, it is\r\n\r\nimpossible for them. To a person who is illiterate\r\n\r\nand  who is offered a job but is asked to pay  $50\r\n\r\nin  order to get it, his first inclination will be\r\n\r\nto  pay the $50 and get the job. He will rather do\r\n\r\nthis  than  get involved if he goes  to  a  police\r\n\r\nstation where he will have to spend time reporting\r\n\r\nthis  case of corruption. He will then have to  go\r\n\r\nand  give evidence and, for all you know, his word\r\n\r\nwill  not be believed because he is held to  be  a\r\n\r\nman of straw. It will be his word against that  of\r\n\r\nan  official in the Seamen's Bureau or an employee\r\n\r\nof  the  shipping company who will  probably  have\r\n\r\nbacking,  and who will say \"This man is  a  liar\",\r\n\r\nand probably the magistrate will believe him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have spent a lot of time over this Bill.\r\n\r\nI  have studied every word of it so that it should\r\n\r\nbe as perfect as humanly possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all the Opposition's arguments are\r\n\r\nbased  on the idea that the roster system  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  successful.  Now  why  should  they\r\n\r\nconceive  the  idea that it is  not  going  to  be\r\n\r\nsuccessful? First of all, in most cases, most  of\r\n\r\nthe  employers will not have to go to the  roster.\r\n\r\nThey are allowed to sign on their own crew as many\r\n\r\ntimes  as they like, which means that probably  60\r\n\r\nor  70  per  cent of the crew can be re-signed  on\r\n\r\nevery  occasion, and they will only have to go  to\r\n\r\nthe roster for the wastage and for replacement  of\r\n\r\nthat  part of the crew who go on leave or  die  or\r\n\r\nleave their employment, which probably will not be\r\n\r\na  big percentage. Now, when they go to the roster\r\n\r\nfor that small percentage,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif they can get efficient seamen from the\r\n\r\nrace  and  even the clan that they want, then  why\r\n\r\nshould  the system not succeed? The only hindrance\r\n\r\nis   that   they  cannot  get  the   person   they\r\n\r\nparticularly want - Mr A or Mr B - but they can  get\r\n\r\nefficient men from the race or the clan that  they\r\n\r\nwant, and they can have two choices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if a man is not efficient, he has very\r\n\r\nlittle  chance  of  getting on  the  register  and\r\n\r\r\nsubsequently  on the roster. If hon. Members  have\r\n\r\nstudied  the Bill, I will point out clause  7  (c)\r\n\r\nwhich reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Minister may make rules not inconsistent\r\n\r\nwith this Ordinance for the following purposes-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to prescribe the conditions under which the\r\n\r\nBoard  may  cancel,  suspend  or  alter  the\r\n\r\nregistration of seamen;\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and  the Minister naturally will take advice front\r\n\r\nthe  Board before he makes these rules which means\r\n\r\nthat the Minister could, under the rules, make  it\r\n\r\na  condition that a seaman who has not served well\r\n\r\nor who has been guilty of inefficiency or laziness\r\n\r\nwould go down on the roster and be penalised,  and\r\n\r\nso  on, so  that  there is every chance  of  only\r\n\r\nefficient seamen being put on the roster. Again in\r\n\r\nclause 8 (f):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Board may make regulations...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) the particulars to be furnished by\r\n\r\napplicants for registration as seamen and by\r\n\r\nregistered  seamen and masters or employers,\r\n\r\nupon   the   discharge  of  such  registered\r\n\r\nseamen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  masters  or employers, when they discharge  a\r\n\r\nseaman,  will give particulars of that  seaman  to\r\n\r\nthe Board and the Board will then be in a position\r\n\r\nto  know what type of seaman is going to he placed\r\n\r\non  the roster and they would probably make  rules\r\n\r\nto  fit him in an appropriate place on the roster\r\n\r\nif  he  is not a good man. So that again goes  for\r\n\r\nefficiency. My purpose is to get efficiency in our\r\n\r\nseamen  but,  at the same time, not  to  get  them\r\n\r\nexploited by the shipowners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to get on the register, a seaman must,\r\n\r\nfirst  of all, undergo a medical test. That  would\r\n\r\nprobably eliminate half the number who are on  the\r\n\r\npresent register because many of them are not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmedically fit - I believe probably at least about 30\r\n\r\nper  cent.  Then after that, I am  sure  that  the\r\n\r\nBoard  will  put a qualification and say  that  he\r\n\r\nmust  be  experienced as a seaman for a number  of\r\n\r\nyears  or a number of months (it is up to them  to\r\n\r\nspecify it). But there again, that shows that  the\r\n\r\nman has got the necessary experience and I am sure\r\n\r\nthat  the Board could ask the Minister to  make  a\r\n\r\nregulation  saying that he must have  had  a  good\r\n\r\ndischarge. If those conditions can be  put  up  by\r\n\r\nthe  Board and can be made by the Minister,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  see  why  the shipowners should  worry  about\r\n\r\nefficient  seamen  not being available,  in  other\r\n\r\nwords,  the  seamen who go on the roster  will  be\r\n\r\nbona fide seamen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect, Sir, from hearing the Member for\r\n\r\nSerangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong) that the threat  of\r\n\r\nsome  ship-owners  to go and  recruit  from  other\r\n\r\nports - and probably they may carry out that  threat\r\n\r\njust  out  of  spite - is because they do  not  want\r\n\r\nanything to fetter their choice. They do not  want\r\n\r\nanything   to   hinder  them  from  choosing   the\r\n\r\nparticular persons they want and just out of spite\r\n\r\nthey might go out of Singapore for a few months to\r\n\r\nrecruit from outside. But I do hope that they give\r\n\r\nup  that  idea. Our local companies, many  Chinese\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  the  Straits  Steamship   Company,\r\n\r\nemploy almost all their crew from Singapore and  I\r\n\r\nam  sure  that they will not wish to  go  outside.\r\n\r\nThey  will prefer to carry on here so long as  the\r\n\r\nsystem is workable. If the system is not workable,\r\n\r\nthen  it is in the interest of Singapore to change\r\n\r\nthat  system  and I will see that  it  is  changed\r\n\r\nthen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give this assurance to the House also that I\r\n\r\nshall  be  watching very closely the  workings  of\r\n\r\nthis Board and I shall not hesitate to remove  any\r\n\r\nmember of the Board whom I find to be obstructive,\r\n\r\nwhether  he is a trade unionist or whether  he  is\r\n\r\nrepresenting the shipping interests,  and  I  have\r\n\r\npowers  under  clause 3 (6) where it says  \"unless\r\n\r\nearlier removed by the Minister\" and that power is\r\n\r\nexpressly put for the purpose of-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Benevolent dictatorship!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

If any Member of the House has any doubt as\r\n\r\nto  my  ability to administer that or to  my  bona\r\n\r\nfide intentions, I would ask them to move a motion\r\n\r\nto  delete  that.  In fact, I  did  point  it  out\r\n\r\nyesterday or the day before when the debate  arose\r\n\r\non some other Bill on the same clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P.

I\r\n\r\nhope I am not being very obtuse but it seems to me\r\n\r\nthat,  in  fact, there are not two rosters,  there\r\n\r\nare  two  lists of choice; but if you  place  your\r\n\r\nPakistanis,  your  Indians or  your  Hainanese  on\r\n\r\nseparate  lists, then, in fact, there are  several\r\n\r\nrosters. Would the Minister agree with that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M.

You can call it by any name you like but\r\n\r\nyou  have  separate  lists. The seamen  themselves\r\n\r\nalso  have  been given a chance to have a  choice.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a clause which provides that the  Board\r\n\r\nwill  decide,  if a seaman refuses employment,  on\r\n\r\nwhat his position on the roster should be. For the\r\n\r\nfirst  refusal, I am sure the Board will say  that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  no penalty but for  a  subsequent\r\n\r\nrefusal,  they might put him down a few places  on\r\n\r\nthe roster; so that the seaman has also a choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> On a point of information,\r\n\r\nSir.

It is a measure that has been  debated,\r\n\r\nI  believe,  not only in this session but  in  the\r\n\r\nprevious session of the Assembly, for more than  a\r\n\r\nyear  now  and  the Committee has  gone  into  the\r\n\r\nmatter very thoroughly and examined many witnesses\r\n\r\nin great detail. Most of the time of the Committee\r\n\r\nwas  spent on that controversial clause 47 of  the\r\n\r\nold\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill  renumbered clause 41 in the  present  tabled\r\n\r\nBill.  The  clause  dealt  with  the  question  of\r\n\r\nwhether  the  validity of Muslim wills  should  be\r\n\r\nrestricted only to wills or portions thereof  that\r\n\r\nare in accordance with the Law of Islam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Members will recall that the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee   was  given  a  special  directive   to\r\n\r\nconsider  the  desirability of  including  such  a\r\n\r\nprovision in the Bill. Detailed examination of the\r\n\r\nwitnesses revealed that the overwhelming  majority\r\n\r\nof  Muslims were strongly of the view that such  a\r\n\r\nprovision  should be included. The same  arguments\r\n\r\nthat   have   been  brought  out  in  this   House\r\n\r\npreviously against such a provision were put up by\r\n\r\na  group  of  two witnesses but a  host  of  other\r\n\r\nwitnesses rebutted these arguments again on  lines\r\n\r\nsimilar  to  those brought out by me in  answering\r\n\r\ncriticisms  at  the Second Reading stage  of  this\r\n\r\nBill  in November last year. On balance, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  felt  that, since there  was  a  strong\r\n\r\ndesire  amongst  Muslims  for  incorporating  this\r\n\r\nprovision and since there was genuine concern  for\r\n\r\nthose  rightful heirs who might otherwise be  left\r\n\r\nunprovided for, provision should be entered in the\r\n\r\nBill as set out in clause 41.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I second the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.42 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI have spoken on this platform before that I never\r\n\r\ntake  part  in  religious controversies.  Being  a\r\n\r\nlayman,   I   leave  this  job  to  the   experts.\r\n\r\nPersonally,  I consider that religion  is  between\r\n\r\nman  and his Creator. No man is perfect except the\r\n\r\nprophets and one has to answer to his Creator  for\r\n\r\nomissions  and commissions whether he  follows  or\r\n\r\ndoes not follow his religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been placed on the Select Committee\r\n\r\nand  I belong to the Muslim faith. If anyone  born\r\n\r\nof  any faith says that his faith is so and so, he\r\n\r\nmust be true and steadfast to his religion when it\r\n\r\ncomes to legislation. There can be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno  two  opinions of any religionist going against\r\n\r\none's own religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the first object of this Bill is to\r\n\r\nprotect Muslim women against unscrupulous men  who\r\n\r\nabuse the right to marry four women and chuck them\r\n\r\noff  as  chattel if they so desire  but,  strictly\r\n\r\nfollowing  the  religion, it  is  not  so.  It  is\r\n\r\nenjoined in the religion that when marrying again,\r\n\r\nthe  husband has got to give his second, third and\r\n\r\nfourth  wives equal love, it means that it is  not\r\n\r\npossible  for anyone to marry more than one  wife,\r\n\r\nexcepting when there is no issue, and so on.  Now,\r\n\r\nthe  whole  thing has been abused in this  country\r\n\r\nand  it  is  very necessary to give protection  to\r\n\r\nMuslim  women.  This Bill should  have  come  into\r\n\r\nforce  long ago and should not have taken a  year.\r\n\r\nThis  is  something good in order to  protect  the\r\n\r\nwomen  from  being exploited by unscrupulous  men.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the discussion went from this  to  other\r\n\r\nissues   of  inheritance  and  that  is  how   the\r\n\r\ncontroversy arose and time has been taken.  It  is\r\n\r\nvery unfortunate that it took such a long time  to\r\n\r\nget  in  the  main object which is to protect  the\r\n\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, there is no objection at all to that\r\n\r\nportion  of  the  Bill  as far  as  marriages  and\r\n\r\ndivorces  are  concerned. There  is  no  objection\r\n\r\nwhatsoever to the suggested clause 47 which is now\r\n\r\nthe  present  clause 41 as far as  any  Muslim  is\r\n\r\nconcerned. When a Muslim is asked to vote, he  has\r\n\r\ngot  to  follow the Islamic law. Now here,  I  may\r\n\r\nsay,  Sir, that the Koran has stood the  test  for\r\n\r\n1,400  years. Nobody has been able to  change  it,\r\n\r\neven a comma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The controversy comes to clause 42 as it is now\r\n\r\nin  the present Bill. Now, Sir, Singapore has  got\r\n\r\nno  State  religion.  The argument  has  been  put\r\n\r\nforward  that if the Government or the Assemblymen\r\n\r\nare willing to allow the Muslims to enact some  of\r\n\r\nthe  laws  of  Islam  into a Bill,  why  not  take\r\n\r\nadvantage of it? I certainly agree that we should.\r\n\r\nAt  the  same time, if there is any defect  or  if\r\n\r\nthere  is any law in existence against the Koranic\r\n\r\nlaws, that should be amended\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntoo.  As a matter of fact, any other person  or  a\r\n\r\ngroup of persons of different religions could come\r\n\r\nbefore  this Assembly to present a Bill that  they\r\n\r\nshould  be  governed by their  own  religions.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the  Muslims would have no  objection  to\r\n\r\nthat as the non-Muslims are allowing us to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I draw the attention of the House to the\r\n\r\nproceedings  of the Select Committee meeting  held\r\n\r\non  26th  February, 1957. Sir, clause  42  of  the\r\n\r\nBill, as it stands now, has got a proviso reading:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Provided that any of the next of kin who is not\r\n\r\na  Muslim  shall  be  entitled  to  share  in  the\r\n\r\ndistribution as though he were a Muslim.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  my contention is this. Are we allowing  the\r\n\r\nenactment  of laws according to Islamic  law?  Are\r\n\r\nthe   Muslims  in  this  Assembly  going  to  vote\r\n\r\naccording  to  Koranic law? If they are  Muslims,\r\n\r\nare  they not bound to follow the Koran,  if  they\r\n\r\nbelieve in it? Now, there are persons who may  do\r\n\r\ncertain things for worldly gain but here they will\r\n\r\nnot only be judged by their God but they also will\r\n\r\nbe  judged  by  their Muslim  voters  if  they  go\r\n\r\nagainst  the Koran. Sir, there was evidence  taken\r\n\r\non  this.  The  majority view  agreed  that  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  nothing put in which  is  against  the\r\n\r\nKoran  and that that proviso should be taken  off.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there was a minor difference of opinion.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, it is not a matter of opinion. The Koran\r\n\r\nlays  down certain laws which must be followed  by\r\n\r\nevery Muslim. There is no question of opinion.  In\r\n\r\nthat  Committee, Sir, I asked those  who  differed\r\n\r\nwhether  we could have expert advice. As a  matter\r\n\r\nof  fact,  expert advice was given but, from  26th\r\n\r\nFebruary,  1957 up till now, they have had  enough\r\n\r\ntime  that  if  at all they had wanted  to  follow\r\n\r\ntheir  religion,  they should have  by  this  time\r\n\r\nsought expert advice. There is no excuse for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sorry to take a little more time. I\r\n\r\nknow  that  the  majority of the Members  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  are  not Muslims and they may not  be  very\r\n\r\nmuch  interested  in  this question.  The  law  of\r\n\r\ninheritance according to the Koran is this.  If  a\r\n\r\ngirl who is not a Christian or a Jewess marries  a\r\n\r\nMuslim, she and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nher  children are not entitled to any inheritance.\r\n\r\nAlso  by religion, he is not allowed to marry such\r\n\r\na  girl. A Muslim is not allowed to get married to\r\n\r\nany   other  non-Muslim  girl  except  to  a  girl\r\n\r\nbelonging to the faith of Christianity or Judaism.\r\n\r\nThere  is no bar against such a marriage  but  the\r\n\r\nexpert opinion and the Koran says that she or  her\r\n\r\nchildren   will   not  get  any   share   of   the\r\n\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> On a point of information,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R.

According to the Koran,\r\n\r\nthis  proviso is un-Islamic and it should be taken\r\n\r\noff  the  Bill.  Sir Sayed Ibrahim  Alsagoff,  the\r\n\r\nChairman of the Muslim Advisory Board, who  is  an\r\n\r\nArab by race, born in Mecca and well versed in his\r\n\r\nreligion,  has  written a letter - as  I  said\r\n\r\npreviously, this will not interest the  non-Muslim\r\n\r\n-   Members  of  this  House  but  I  pray   their\r\n\r\nindulgence - dated 21st October, 1956, to  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Secretary and a copy has been forwarded\r\n\r\nto  me.  This  has been mentioned  in  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee meeting held on 26th February, 1957,  in\r\n\r\nwhich he asked for the deletion of the proviso  to\r\n\r\nthe  old clause 41 which is, of course, now clause\r\n\r\n42. Well, that is also the opinion of the Chairman\r\n\r\nof  the  Muslim Advisory Board. Now, whatever  the\r\n\r\nadvice or opinion may be, what does the Koran say?\r\n\r\nAre we going to enact a law for the Muslims? If it\r\n\r\nis  to  be  a  law for the Muslims, it  should  be\r\n\r\naccording to the Koran and nothing else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to move an amendment to the\r\n\r\nmotion, namely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the motion, to add the words\r\n\r\n\"subject to the recommittal of the Bill in respect\r\n\r\nof   clause  42  to  a  Committee  of  the   whole\r\n\r\nAssembly\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, in my opening speech on moving  the\r\n\r\nmotion, I purposely did not touch upon clause 42,\r\n\r\nand this proviso to the clause, as I thought that\r\n\r\nit  had  been sufficiently debated in  Committee,\r\n\r\nwhere   the  majority  of  the  Members  of   the\r\n\r\nCommittee being Muslims had rejected the deletion\r\n\r\nof this proviso, and as I thought that the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Telok  Ayer had been satisfied. Had  I  been\r\n\r\naware,  Sir,  that  he  was  going  to  move   an\r\n\r\namendment, I would have touched upon it,  and  he\r\n\r\nmight  then  have  seen  fit  not  to  move   his\r\n\r\namendment; he might probably have been  convinced\r\n\r\nby  my  arguments. However, I think it is now  my\r\n\r\nduty - even at this late stage - to say something on\r\n\r\nthis   clause  in  order  to  clear  up   certain\r\n\r\nmisunderstandings which the Member's  speech  has\r\n\r\ncreated,  probably through no fault of  his  own - perhaps he himself is not clear in his mind as to\r\n\r\nwhat the intentions are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much mention has been made that \"according to\r\n\r\nthe   Koran  this  proviso  is  un-Islamic\",  and\r\n\r\n\"according to Koranic law this is so  on  and  so\r\n\r\nforth\".  However, although the  Koran  was  often\r\n\r\nmentioned, it was not quoted. That, Sir, is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npoint - the  part  of the Koran which  purports  to\r\n\r\nforbid  Muslims  from giving  a  share  of  their\r\n\r\nproperty to non-Muslim heirs was not quoted. Sir,\r\n\r\nit  is  easy to say \"according to this, according\r\n\r\nto that\" without quoting anything definite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there are two points I would like to make.\r\n\r\nFirst  the Koran is the fountain of Islamic  law;\r\n\r\nthere is no doubt about that. But Islamic law has\r\n\r\nbeen  evolved by Muslim jurists over  many  years\r\n\r\nsince  the  birth  of  the Islamic  religion;  no\r\n\r\ndoubt,  they have based Islamic law on the Koran,\r\n\r\nbut  they  filled  in gaps here  and  there  from\r\n\r\nHadith.  Now, Hadith  are  the  sayings  of  the\r\n\r\nProphet  and  there  is a difference  of  opinion\r\n\r\nbetween  the various sects of Muslims on  Hadith.\r\n\r\nSome  sects accept certain parts of Hadith,  some\r\n\r\ndo  not. The second point is that you find  among\r\n\r\nbelievers  in Islam there are so many  sects,  or\r\n\r\nfirkas, as they are called. The major one are the\r\n\r\nSunnis,  and  in Malaya they form the predominant\r\n\r\nmajority. The Shias are only a handful here. Now,\r\n\r\nit is true to say that, according to Islamic law,\r\n\r\nthis  proviso should be removed; but  it  is  not\r\n\r\ntrue  to  say that according to Koranic law,  for\r\n\r\nthere  is  no specific mention in the Koran  that\r\n\r\nnon-Muslims  may not or should not share  in  the\r\n\r\nproperty of a deceased parent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, touching on this proviso - prior to\r\n\r\n1924, the law applicable here on the distribution\r\n\r\nof  an  intestate deceased Muslim was not  Muslim\r\n\r\nlaw but English law. That English law was changed\r\n\r\nby  the  Mohammedan (Amendment) Ordinance,  1923,\r\n\r\nwhich came into effect on 1st January, 1924. From\r\n\r\nthat  date, the law states that an estate,  in  a\r\n\r\ncase   of   intestacy,  shall   be   administered\r\n\r\naccording to Mohammedan law except in so  far  as\r\n\r\nsuch  law  is opposed to any local custom  which,\r\n\r\nprior  to  January 1924, has the  force  of  law,\r\n\r\nprovided that any of the next of kin who is not a\r\n\r\nMohammedan  shall be entitled  to  share  in  the\r\n\r\ndistribution as though he were a Mohammedan. From\r\n\r\n1924  to the present time, this provision is part\r\n\r\nof the law of the Colony; yet no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood  Muslim  has  taken  any  objection  to   it.\r\n\r\nProbably  all  Muslims have not  abided  by  their\r\n\r\nreligion, according to the Member for Telok Ayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslim Advisory Board, Sir, as far back as\r\n\r\n1955, made representations on the inclusion of the\r\n\r\ntestacy  clause  that  wills  should  be  executed\r\n\r\naccording to Islamic law, but it did not take  any\r\n\r\nobjection to this particular proviso. It was  only\r\n\r\nin  October  1956,  when some  elements  began  an\r\n\r\nagitation  that  the  proviso  was  un-Islamic  in\r\n\r\nnature, that the Board was probably forced to make\r\n\r\nobjection. Even then, they did not press  it  with\r\n\r\nas much vigour as they have done in the other one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there is in force in this Colony a\r\n\r\nCivil  Marriage Ordinance according to  which  any\r\n\r\nmarriage  made  under it is  valid.  If  a  Muslim\r\n\r\ncontracts  a  civil  marriage  with  a  non-Muslim\r\n\r\nwoman, that marriage is therefore valid and she is\r\n\r\nhis  wife according to the law of the Colony, even\r\n\r\nthough  the Islamic law says she is not his  wife,\r\n\r\nif  she does not belong to followers of the  Book,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  if  she  is not a Jew or  a  Christian.\r\n\r\nAccording to the law of the Colony, she is a legal\r\n\r\nwife and her children are legal heirs. It would be\r\n\r\ninequitable, therefore, to cut off that  wife  (or\r\n\r\nher children) from sharing in any property left by\r\n\r\nher Muslim husband.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have here a book written by a prominent\r\n\r\nMuslim jurist, Mohameddan Law, by Syed Ameer  Ali,\r\n\r\nwho is often quoted in the courts in India. On the\r\n\r\nproviso  that non-Muslim heirs should not  inherit\r\n\r\nfrom a Muslim parent, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"These provisos do not owe their origins to\r\n\r\nreligious   exclusiveness  but  to  the  political\r\n\r\nnecessities  of  the early Commonwealth,  when  an\r\n\r\nunbeliever   was  an  inveterate  enemy   and   an\r\n\r\nappostate a traitor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another big argument against deleting\r\n\r\nthe proviso, and that is that according to Islamic\r\n\r\nlaw, not only is a non-Muslim not allowed to share\r\n\r\nin  the property of a Muslim, but a Muslim is  not\r\n\r\nallowed  to share in the property of a non-Muslim.\r\n\r\nThis again is stated by Ameer Ali, who writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Under the Sunni law, a Muslim does not inherit\r\n\r\nfrom  a non-Muslim, nor does a non-Muslim inherit\r\n\r\nfrom a Muslim\";\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  that  when you have parents who are of another\r\n\r\nreligion  and  their children are  converted  into\r\n\r\nIslam,   those   children  cannot  inherit   their\r\n\r\nparents'  property.  If  you  are  going   to   be\r\n\r\nequitable, to see both sides of the argument,  and\r\n\r\nprevent  non-Muslim heirs from participating,  you\r\n\r\nhave, according to Sunni law, similarly to prevent\r\n\r\nMuslim  heirs - and  Sunnis predominate  in  Malaya.\r\n\r\nWhat  will  happen in countries like India,  where\r\n\r\nmany  converts to Islam have been made from Hindus\r\n\r\nand  others?  -all  their children,  if  they  are\r\n\r\nSunnis,  will not be able to inherit.  (I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow about Shias or other sects).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my contention, therefore, is that it is not\r\n\r\ncorrect to stipulate that we must go \"according to\r\n\r\nthe Koran\" and say that we are not following it by\r\n\r\nrefusing  to accept the request of the Member  for\r\n\r\nTelok  Ayer - we are sticking to common sense:  and,\r\n\r\nin  a multi-racial society like ours in Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhere there is close affinity between the races, I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think  it  is  fair that  Muslims  should\r\n\r\ndeprive  their  wives, who may be non-Muslims  but\r\n\r\nwho  are legally married to them under civil  law,\r\n\r\nand  their  legitimate children  from  sharing  in\r\n\r\ntheir  property; and it is also not fair that  the\r\n\r\nchildren of legally wedded non-Muslim parents,  if\r\n\r\nsuch   children  are  converted  to   Islam,   are\r\n\r\nprevented from sharing in their parents' estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move my motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and\r\n\r\nagreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Third Reading</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

The subject of this motion  is  not  the\r\n\r\nproduct  of  the Government; it is the product  of\r\n\r\nthe  united  efforts of the All-Party  Delegation,\r\n\r\nand  I  am  moving this motion as  leader  of  the\r\n\r\ndelegation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the man who blazed the trail for a\r\n\r\nconstitutional   advance   is   the   Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill.  It  was  he who  mobilised  the  first\r\n\r\ncampaign and led an All-Party Mission to London in\r\n\r\nApril   1956.  He  fought  hard  and   he   fought\r\n\r\nvigorously for us, but it was a matter for  regret\r\n\r\nthat  the  mission did not succeed.  Although  the\r\n\r\nmission did not succeed, Sir, it had done at least\r\n\r\none  good  thing, and we must not forget this;  it\r\n\r\nopened  the way for the next round, and the credit\r\n\r\nfor this rightly goes to the Member for Cairnhill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I took over office as Chief Minister in\r\n\r\nJune  last year and pledged to have another  crack\r\n\r\nat  the  Colonial Office. Having been a member  of\r\n\r\nthe  Marshall  Mission, I  had  the  advantage  of\r\n\r\npersonal knowledge of the way the fight went,  and\r\n\r\nhow and why it went wrong. With this advantage,  I\r\n\r\nwas  able  to  plan, and plan early, the  strategy\r\n\r\nthat could give us a good chance of success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was Minister for Labour and Welfare in\r\n\r\nthe  Marshall Government, I accepted an invitation\r\n\r\nto   attend  a  conference  in  Oxford  of  Labour\r\n\r\nMinisters of colonial territories. This  was  held\r\n\r\nin  June-July 1956; and when I took over the chief\r\n\r\nministership, I decided that I should attend  this\r\n\r\nconference, and I took the opportunity it afforded\r\n\r\nme to see the Secretary of State for the Colonies.\r\n\r\nI  had two rounds of friendly sparring with him. I\r\n\r\ncame  away with the knowledge that the going  then\r\n\r\nwas  still  tough and that an early official  bout\r\n\r\nwas  inadvisable. I went round meeting people  and\r\n\r\nmaking plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I visited London again, Sir, in December, this\r\n\r\ntime  to fix a date for the Constitutional  Talks,\r\n\r\nto  draw up an agenda and to have preliminary  and\r\n\r\nunofficial  discussions  with  the  Secretary   of\r\n\r\nState.  I took the opportunity it afforded  me  to\r\n\r\nmeet  more  people  and make further  plans.  This\r\n\r\ntime,  I  returned to Singapore  more  hopeful  of\r\n\r\nsuccess  in the forthcoming talks. But I  did  not\r\n\r\nallow  this hope to blunt the strategy that I  had\r\n\r\nalready  made  up in my mind, and it  was  that  I\r\n\r\nshould strive for an All-Party unity which was  to\r\n\r\nbe the magnetic force to attract success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step was to call an All-Party\r\n\r\nConference.  The  first meeting was  held  on  7th\r\n\r\nFebruary  and altogether the conference met  eight\r\n\r\ntimes.  The  conference drew up its blueprint  and\r\n\r\nthis  was incorporated in a White Paper which  was\r\n\r\npresented to this Assembly as Sessional Paper  No.\r\n\r\nMisc.  1  of  1957.  A  special  sitting  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  was  called  for  5th  March,  when  the\r\n\r\nblueprint of the All-Party Conference was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndebated,  and it was heartening to the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  that this national issue  received  the\r\n\r\nunanimous  support  of  the Assembly.  Thus,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  was unity of purpose in the Assembly; there\r\n\r\nwas  unity of purpose in the All-Party Conference;\r\n\r\nand  what was left to be proved was unity  in  the\r\n\r\nAll-Party Delegation that was entrusted with  this\r\n\r\nmandate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I left Singapore leading this delegation\r\n\r\nconfident in this unity, and I am happy and  proud\r\n\r\nto  repeat  in  this Assembly that this  wonderful\r\n\r\nunity  in the delegation during the talks and,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  during our stay in London, was  the  source\r\n\r\nfrom  which  we  derived  our  strength,  and  was\r\n\r\nresponsible  for the successful discharge  of  our\r\n\r\nmandate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to London knowing what we had to do, and\r\n\r\nthe unity in the delegation provided the means  to\r\n\r\ndo  it. The Press communique that was released  at\r\n\r\nthe  end of each session was all the news that  we\r\n\r\nallowed to go through. There were no leakages  and\r\n\r\nno  sensational statements by any  member  in  the\r\n\r\ndelegation. We were convinced that this course  of\r\n\r\naction  was  a  necessary and wise one,  but  this\r\n\r\nshould  not  be taken to mean that all  was  plain\r\n\r\nsailing   in  the  conference  chamber.   It   was\r\n\r\ncertainly  not  so. The good ship  \"The  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore\" did encounter rough weather, but we did\r\n\r\nnot  flounder  nor  founder because  our  teamwork\r\n\r\npulled us through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Sir, let us turn our attention to\r\n\r\nSessional  Paper No. Misc. 2 of 1957.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nReport  of the Constitutional Conference:  let  me\r\n\r\nrepeat,  this  is  a Report and not  an  agreement\r\n\r\nsigned by both parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Look at paragraph 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> This Report is self-explanatory and I do not propose to go into\r\n\r\ndetails.

The  Chairman  explained\r\n\r\nthat  Her  Majesty's  Government  understood   the\r\n\r\nfeelings which prompted this request, but that  it\r\n\r\nwas  not  possible under the present  division  of\r\n\r\nresponsibilities between the two offices  for  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's Government to agree that the affairs  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   should   he   transferred    to    the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth Relations Office.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the explanation given to us, we can safely\r\n\r\ninfer   that  some  change  in  the  division   of\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  is  afoot.  Moreover,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\ndecision of the All-Party Conference was that  the\r\n\r\nAll-Party Delegation should press for this demand,\r\n\r\nbut  not to make an issue of it. We have therefore\r\n\r\ndischarged the trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Sir, is paragraph 13 (b) of\r\n\r\nSessional Paper No. Misc. 1 of 1957, which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Government rates of pay and conditions of\r\n\r\nservice to apply to such employees\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>that  is, civilian employees in the armed  forces.\r\n\r\nSir,  the answer again is to be found in paragraph\r\n\r\n2 of Appendix C to the Report, which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Her Majesty's Government indicated that they\r\n\r\ncould  not bind themselves to relate the rates  of\r\n\r\npay   and  other  conditions  of  service  of  the\r\n\r\nemployees  of the Service Departments  exclusively\r\n\r\nto those enjoyed by employees of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore   Government.

It  is clear from  paragraph  11  of\r\n\r\nSessional Paper No. Misc. 1 of 1957 that there  is\r\n\r\nto   be  no  change  in  the  responsibilities  of\r\n\r\nexternal  defence and external affairs apart  from\r\n\r\nthe  control of trade and cultural relations which\r\n\r\nshould be vested in the Singapore Government.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment, however, is interested in this  matter\r\n\r\nand  will  render all possible assistance  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers' organisations concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like now to touch on paragraphs 52,\r\n\r\n53  and 54 of the Report. These refer to the  date\r\n\r\nof  introduction of the new constitution. The view\r\n\r\nof  the  All-Party  Delegation,  as  expressed  in\r\n\r\nparagraph 54, correctly reflects the view  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  as  made  known at its  sitting  on  5th\r\n\r\nMarch. The Government does not wish to hold office\r\n\r\nunder  the  present constitution  longer  than  is\r\n\r\nnecessarily imposed by the desire of the  Assembly\r\n\r\nto  give every opportunity to all persons who will\r\n\r\nacquire  citizenship rights to have a say  in  the\r\n\r\nchoice  of  the  new  government  under  the   new\r\n\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> You can do that this month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The Government will do\r\n\r\neverything in its power to expedite the fulfilment\r\n\r\nof this desire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> The instalment plan!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> And now I come to the second\r\n\r\npart of my motion, and that is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"approves the stand of the All-Party Delegation\r\n\r\nin  not  accepting  the  condition  stipulated  in\r\n\r\nparagraph 30 of the Report.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Paragraph 30, Sir, clearly states the stand  taken\r\n\r\nby  the  All-Party Delegation.

The Parties represented in this\r\n\r\nAssembly, Sir, now have had time to consider  this\r\n\r\ncondition, and this will no doubt be made known to\r\n\r\nus in this debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State explained to the\r\n\r\ndelegation  that this was a temporary restriction.\r\n\r\nIt  was  only to apply to elections to  the  first\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly under the  new  constitution\r\n\r\nand  that  only detainees whose appeals  had  been\r\n\r\nrejected   by  the  Appeals  Tribunal   would   be\r\n\r\naffected, and Her Majesty's Government intended to\r\n\r\nimpose this, sincerely believing that this was for\r\n\r\nthe good of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Party has given full consideration to\r\n\r\nthis  condition, and has decided  to  approve  the\r\n\r\nstand  taken  by the All-Party Delegation  in  not\r\n\r\naccepting  the condition. As the Party  in  power,\r\n\r\nthere is another reason why we cannot accept  this\r\n\r\ncondition.  We  will be placed  in  the  invidious\r\n\r\nposition  of having our actions against subversive\r\n\r\nelements being twisted by uncharitable people as a\r\n\r\nmeasure  against our political opponents and  thus\r\n\r\nprevent  them  from  standing for  elections.  The\r\n\r\nactions  that  we have taken in the past  and  may\r\n\r\ntake  in  the future while we are still in  office\r\n\r\nare   and  will  be  in  the  discharge   of   our\r\n\r\nresponsibilities to look after the welfare of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if my motion is accepted under the first\r\n\r\npart, the drafting of the new constitution can  be\r\n\r\nproceeded   with   without  further   delay.

Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsecond  the  motion. As a member of the  All-Party\r\n\r\nDelegation,  I  believe  we  have  discharged  our\r\n\r\nduties  to this Assembly. We have carried out  the\r\n\r\nmandate  given  to us by the people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nexpressed  through  the various political  Parties\r\n\r\nand  through  the Assembly here. We believe,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  secured the  maximum  possible.  I\r\n\r\nremember  that last year we failed  and  after  we\r\n\r\nfailed,  some  attempt  was  made  to  revive  the\r\n\r\nconference, and if we had secured agreement  then,\r\n\r\ncomparatively  speaking, we would still  have  got\r\n\r\nmore   this  year.  The  failure  last  year   was\r\n\r\nregretted,  because it would have  been  one  year\r\n\r\nearlier for us to have self-government if  we  had\r\n\r\nsecured  agreement. We would probably  be  in  the\r\n\r\nmidst  of an election today. However, all that  is\r\n\r\npast  and we have started anew. We went to  London\r\n\r\nagain this year and we got what we wanted. I  know\r\n\r\nthere might be criticism that what we have got  is\r\n\r\ntoo  little.  People may say that we  should  have\r\n\r\nelections    immediately,   but   the    All-Party\r\n\r\nDelegation had in mind that the people who are  to\r\n\r\nenjoy citizenship rights should be given a chance.\r\n\r\nSome  people  are  of the view that  it  could  be\r\n\r\nimplemented  immediately  and  that  these  people\r\n\r\nshould  be  given,  say, two  months  to  register\r\n\r\nthemselves. However, to be democratic and  knowing\r\n\r\nas   we  do  that  not  all  people  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nunderstand everything told to them once or  twice,\r\n\r\nwe  feel that we should give them more opportunity\r\n\r\nto  be well versed in what is imparted to them and\r\n\r\nto   exercise  their  right  to  become  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Whilst we sit in the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Furthermore, Sir, since the\r\n\r\ncitizenship law - and we agreed to this  during  the\r\n\r\nlast  time we met - cannot be promulgated  at  once,\r\n\r\nthere  must be consultation.

I\r\n\r\nam quite used to such interruptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Kingdom too must amend its\r\n\r\nNationality  Act because we have  just  got  self-government. It is not independence, and as it  is,\r\n\r\nwe  are still to some extent governed by the  laws\r\n\r\nin the United Kingdom. I believe those who have so\r\n\r\nmuch  concern for the people who will be  eligible\r\n\r\nto  become  citizens of Singapore  should  have  a\r\n\r\nthought for them and should devise ways and  means\r\n\r\nof  letting  them  make  the  right  decisions  to\r\n\r\nshoulder responsibilities in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably another criticism may be levelled at\r\n\r\nthe  delegation  about the Security  Council,  and\r\n\r\nthey  may  say that this gives the United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nGovernment  a  great deal of power. Compared  with\r\n\r\nwhat  we would have got last year, I think we  are\r\n\r\nin a much better position, because now we have not\r\n\r\nonly  the three votes of the Singapore Government,\r\n\r\nbut   we  also  have  the  Federation  vote.   The\r\n\r\nFederation  vote,  I think, is  one  of  the  most\r\n\r\nimpartial  votes which we could get.  On  the  one\r\n\r\nhand,  I  understand they have made  an  agreement\r\n\r\nwith the United Kingdom on a matter of defence. On\r\n\r\nthe   other  hand,  however,  they  are  a   close\r\n\r\nneighbour  of Singapore and understand Singapore's\r\n\r\nproblems much better, and I believe they will vote\r\n\r\nin a very fair way, both to the United Kingdom and\r\n\r\nto  Singapore.  In  fact, they  should  vote  more\r\n\r\nfavourably  to  Singapore  because  events  taking\r\n\r\nplace in Singapore will also affect them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the last part of the motion, we are of\r\n\r\nthe opinion that the condition\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstipulated in paragraph 30 of the Report could not\r\n\r\nbe  accepted  because it is undemocratic.  We  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to sell democracy and we feel that  if  we\r\n\r\nare  to fight undemocratic elements, we should use\r\n\r\ndemocratic means to fight them. We know that if we\r\n\r\nfight in a democratic way we will win in the  end,\r\n\r\nwhereas probably we will be accused of winning our\r\n\r\nbattle  if  we  tie the hands of the  undemocratic\r\n\r\nelements. That condition however is imposed on  us\r\n\r\nby  the United Kingdom. They have the power to  do\r\n\r\nso at present. They mean to use that power. We are\r\n\r\nstill  subjected to that power, but  we  can  only\r\n\r\nshake  that  off  after we  have  held  our  first\r\n\r\nelections, and if we want to shake that  condition\r\n\r\noff, we must hold an election-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Not now, but as early as we\r\n\r\ncan  after  we have considered the rights  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  whom we have always in mind.

It was not and it could never\r\n\r\nbe, Sir, because the Labour Front and every Member\r\n\r\nof this House and every citizen outside knows that\r\n\r\na  mammoth  rally would be a horrible  joke,  that\r\n\r\nthere  would  be  nothing but stony  silence,  and\r\n\r\nperhaps worse, to welcome back these gentlemen who\r\n\r\nhave handed us over to our enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why, why this cold contempt of the people\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  for  their  Merdeka  Mission,   as\r\n\r\nevidenced  on the day of their return  and  since?\r\n\r\nBecause  when  the  hour  of  opportunity  struck,\r\n\r\nSingapore  was found wanting, wanting through  the\r\n\r\ninadequacy of its own representatives. We  failed,\r\n\r\nSir,  not because Lennox-Boyd was too strong - that\r\n\r\nis a glorious failure: it is a failure of which we\r\n\r\nneed  not  be  ashamed;  when  we  are  broken  by\r\n\r\nsuperior force and we are shot down with a machine-gun  bullet - we  failed because we were  afraid  of\r\n\r\nMerdeka, we, the representatives of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. We failed because we have weak guts - we,\r\n\r\nwhom  the people of Singapore trusted. In  silence\r\n\r\nmust  the people of Singapore bear the shame  that\r\n\r\ntheir   own   representatives,  the  people   they\r\n\r\ntrusted, let them down. Their people failed in the\r\n\r\nhour  of  opportunity. All Singapore, Sir,  shared\r\n\r\nthe  shame of the inadequacy of its delegation  at\r\n\r\nthe wonderful opportunity which was before it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been very fashionable to damn the\r\n\r\nflamboyant ex-Chief Minister, to seek to bury  him\r\n\r\nand to place on his shoulders the slimy hatred  of\r\n\r\npersons   who   fear  an  honest   and   a   clean\r\n\r\nconstitution  for  the people of Singapore,  which\r\n\r\nwould  make radical changes in the present  vested\r\n\r\ninterest  set-up. But I am not seeking to  justify\r\n\r\nmyself  if I ask you to turn back a few  pages.  I\r\n\r\nwill  give you my word - I can take what I am  given\r\n\r\nand I can take a lot more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  survived the Japanese prisons, do not forget.

Can you remember, Sir, the warm  solid\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the  people of Singapore  during  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional crisis of our young days,  in  July\r\n\r\nand  August 1955? Even the double-crossing  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nsupported us, and I have, as a trophy of honour, a\r\n\r\nlittle  cartoon  in  a Chinese paper  showing  the\r\n\r\nrejoicing  of  the people of Singapore,  who  were\r\n\r\nprepared to have no government at all rather  than\r\n\r\na  stooge government. They were united, the Sikhs,\r\n\r\nthe   Chinese,   the  Malays,  the  Indians,   the\r\n\r\nEurasians, all of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember, Sir, Merdeka Week last year? I\r\n\r\nshall  not remind you of the motion of the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Paya Lebar who said, \"Let us have independence\r\n\r\nimmediately.\"  I shall not. Sir, I  am  trying  to\r\n\r\ndraw  attention to some of the decent things  that\r\n\r\nhave  occurred - the Merdeka Week of last year;  the\r\n\r\nunity  of  purpose  of  all races;  the  signature\r\n\r\ncampaign - I know, because we were told it was those\r\n\r\nhorrible  little  Chinese school boys - let  me  say\r\n\r\nthis   to  you - those  Chinese  school  boys   have\r\n\r\ncommitted  many  errors; the Chinese  school  boys\r\n\r\nhave  been  a  headache and have  caused  harm  to\r\n\r\nSingapore;  their  conduct has harmed  temporarily\r\n\r\nour  relations with the Federation, but  in  those\r\n\r\nChinese  school boys there is pure gold, there  is\r\n\r\nhonesty,  there is sincerity, there  is  idealism,\r\n\r\nthere  is  energy. And those who  sneer  at  those\r\n\r\nChinese school boys will never be abe to guide the\r\n\r\ndestiny of this country to anything that is  worth\r\n\r\nwhile.

I have said, I do not know how many times,\r\n\r\nbut  let  me  repeat, that the Federation  without\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  like the the fingers  of  the  hand\r\n\r\nwithout   its   thumb.   Singapore   without   the\r\n\r\nFederation is the thumb without its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfingers.  But  we can exist independently,  and  I\r\n\r\nsay,  Sir, that crawling to the Federation on  our\r\n\r\nforeheads and on our bellies and on our knees  can\r\n\r\nonly  create  contempt, and is  creating  contempt\r\n\r\ntoday, and can only achieve a position whereby the\r\n\r\nFederation    seeks   control,   without    giving\r\n\r\nprotection,  seeks privileges without  giving  any\r\n\r\nconcession.  That  is what the  present  trend  is\r\n\r\nheading  for. I say, Sir, that if the  Tunku  does\r\n\r\nnot  want us, and if the Federation does not  want\r\n\r\nus, then it is the duty of the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nnot  to continue crawling on their bellies but  to\r\n\r\nreorient  their outlook, and that was the position\r\n\r\nwe  took  last  year,  and which  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  endorsed  as  a  member   of   the\r\n\r\ndelegation  in  London - that if we cannot  achieve\r\n\r\nintegration with the Federation, then we must have\r\n\r\nindependence within the Commonwealth.

Our  population\r\n\r\ntoday  is  larger  than the  population  of  seven\r\n\r\nindependent  countries  who  are  members  of  the\r\n\r\nUnited Nations - Iceland, Costa Rica, Jordan, Libya,\r\n\r\nLuxembourg,   Nicaragua,  and  Panama   and   only\r\n\r\nslightly   less   than  three  other   independent\r\n\r\ncountries - Honduras, the Lebanon, and Paraguay. Our\r\n\r\nrevenue  is  greater than that of  16  independent\r\n\r\ncountries   which  are  members  of   the   United\r\n\r\nNations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So our revenue is more than 16 independent\r\n\r\ncountries  and our population is equal  to  almost\r\n\r\nten  independent nations who are  members  of  the\r\n\r\nUnited Nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did we say, Sir, in our memorandum - approved\r\n\r\nby   the  P.A.P. by  the  way - submitted  to   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Constitutional Conference by  the  All-Party Mission:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Though the present Constitution of Singapore\r\n\r\ndid   not  come  into  operation  until  the   8th\r\n\r\nFebruary,  1955, all parties are agreed  that  the\r\n\r\naspirations of the people of Singapore  cannot  be\r\n\r\nmet   except  by  the  attainment  of  full  self-government within the Commonwealth as soon as  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  constitutional changes can  be  brought\r\n\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Full self-government within the Commonwealth\",\r\n\r\nSir.

I cannot,  Sir,  imitate  the\r\n\r\nstony  silence of the people of Singapore.  To  my\r\n\r\nmind,   what  is  happening  is  a  deathblow   to\r\n\r\ndemocracy  in this territory and Cairnhill  has  a\r\n\r\nvoice  unlike  the other helpless sections  and  I\r\n\r\nintend  to make that voice heard. Perhaps I should\r\n\r\nbe  a  little  more courteous. I  understand  that\r\n\r\nJulius  Caesar,  when  the bloody  hand  of  Brutus\r\n\r\nstruck,  said, 'And you, you Brute'  or  words  to\r\n\r\nthat   effect.  I  am  inclined  to  believe  that\r\n\r\nShakespeare  romanticised,  Sir,  and  that   when\r\n\r\nJulius C\ufffdsar felt the knife of his best friend  in\r\n\r\nhis  own heart, he must have rent the heavens with\r\n\r\nhis  cry  of death. I consider, Sir, that what  is\r\n\r\nhappening today is the destruction of all hope for\r\n\r\nthe  establishment  of  democracy,  attraction  of\r\n\r\ngoodwill  and  respect for the democratic  process\r\n\r\nand  that  we are clearing the arena for what  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong  Pagar would  describe  as  a\r\n\r\nclean,  straight fight between the Colonial Office\r\n\r\nand  its  fellow travellers on the one  hand,  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  and  their fellow  travellers  on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand  and the decent people  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nbeing  inarticulate, are between the crossfire  of\r\n\r\nthose two camps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people of Singapore, although they are\r\n\r\ninarticulate, do seem to have second sight and  do\r\n\r\nseem  to understand. Once they believed that there\r\n\r\nwas  possible  a  people's  merdeka.  Their  stony\r\n\r\nsilence  before and after these merdeka talks  and\r\n\r\nduring  these  merdeka talks,  as  my  friend  the\r\n\r\nMember for Changi (Mr Lim Cher Kheng) has pointed\r\n\r\nout to mean, was an indication that they knew that\r\n\r\nwhat  they  were  going to get was a  politician's\r\n\r\nmurder-ka-document that murdered what they seek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Lennox-Boyd-Yew Hock Constitution is in\r\n\r\nspirit  and in fact as colonial a document as  the\r\n\r\nRendel-Yew  Hock Constitution although  it  is  an\r\n\r\nimprovement  in some aspects.

I quote, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Although Mr Lim Yew Hock, the leader of the\r\n\r\nAll-Party delegation, has affixed his signature to\r\n\r\nthe  draft  constitution  for  Singapore  recently\r\n\r\nnegotiated with the British Colonial Secretary, it\r\n\r\nis  difficult to resist the impression that he has\r\n\r\ndone  so with many reservations - reservations which\r\n\r\nare  apparently  shared by other  members  of  the\r\n\r\ndelegation - and   will   almost   provoke    bitter\r\n\r\ncontroversy when the constitutional proposals  are\r\n\r\ndebated    in   the   Assembly.   The    so-called\r\n\r\nconstitution   which  has  emerged  from   amongst\r\n\r\npainstaking   negotiations   is   a   particularly\r\n\r\noutstanding example of an unsuccessful  compromise\r\n\r\nthat will obscure rather than clarify the colony's\r\n\r\npolitical future-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not write this, gentlemen:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"-a future that will apparently be a strange\r\n\r\ncompound of self-government and dependence on  the\r\n\r\nBritish    Government    of    a    kind    almost\r\n\r\nindistinguishable  from  colonialism.\"  [That   is\r\n\r\nputting it politely, Sir,] \"...it has nothing to do\r\n\r\nwith  the kind of self-government that is the only\r\n\r\nanswer to colonialism.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this constitution is known by all who can\r\n\r\nread  and understand to be an improvement in  part\r\n\r\nbut  is,  in  fact  and  in  essence,  a  colonial\r\n\r\nconstitution and the improvements are  not  to  be\r\n\r\nbrought into force until an indefinite period when\r\n\r\nit   so   pleases  His  Excellency  the   colonial\r\n\r\nofficial.  Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister  knows\r\n\r\nfull  well  that what he has got back is  a  thing\r\n\r\nthat is deformed and a thing of shame. That it why\r\n\r\nhe  applies the Whip in a matter which  should  be\r\n\r\nbeyond party politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The delegation has had a wonderful and a unique\r\n\r\nopportunity  for  success.  The  last  delegation,\r\n\r\nblocked  a  few yards from goal last year,  passed\r\n\r\nthe ball to the present Chief Minister, creating a\r\n\r\ndiversion   to   weaken   the   opposition.    The\r\n\r\ndisclosures of the Fascistic attitude and  tactics\r\n\r\nof the Colonial Office towards Singapore last year\r\n\r\nearned  for  the  people of Singapore  the  active\r\n\r\nsympathy  of  all Asian nations with  considerable\r\n\r\nrepercussions   on  the  Colonial   Office.   They\r\n\r\nrealised that they could not afford to fail  again\r\n\r\nand  they  realised that they had to  succeed  and\r\n\r\nsucceed  soon  to  save their face.  Not  only  in\r\n\r\nIndia, Ceylon, Indonesia, Japan but even in China,\r\n\r\nthere  was the most heartfelt and active  sympathy\r\n\r\nfor the people of Singapore. Let us admit frankly,\r\n\r\nSir,  to be fair: the Chief Minister improved  his\r\n\r\nposition after receiving the ball and improved  it\r\n\r\nmagnificently.  Whatever  we  may  think,  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext of the long-term welfare of Singapore,  of\r\n\r\nhis actions in August and October last year, there\r\n\r\nis  no  question whatsoever in my mind - nor should\r\n\r\nthere  be  in anybody else's - that his  actions  in\r\n\r\nAugust and October improved his position vis-a-vis\r\n\r\nthe Colonial Office to a very considerable extent.\r\n\r\nThe  goal was wide open. He knew it and he fumbled\r\n\r\nand  all  we get is a corner kick, and  why,  Sir?\r\n\r\nBecause there has developed in the past few months\r\n\r\na  fear  complex,  a  fear of  merdeka  which  the\r\n\r\nProgressives always had in their hearts but  which\r\n\r\nthe  rest  of us did not have - a contagious  fear - a\r\n\r\nfear that took away our faith in our people and in\r\n\r\nour  destiny. Sir, I will say this: I am not above\r\n\r\nfear and I am not without recognition, nor have  I\r\n\r\never been, of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  dangers  involved  in  any  progress.  A  man\r\n\r\nenforced to lie horizontal for 20 years, when  you\r\n\r\nstart  to  make him walk, will fall and  bark  his\r\n\r\nshins  and break his bones. He needs to  learn  to\r\n\r\nwalk.  He must be encouraged to walk. Sir, in  the\r\n\r\nworld  of today, fear is not only for those of  us\r\n\r\nin  Singapore who are considering the consequences\r\n\r\nof  merdeka but fear is for all the people of  the\r\n\r\nworld.  Although  the  Minister  for  Health  (Mr\r\n\r\nBraga) takes so blithely the repercussions of  the\r\n\r\nhydrogen bomb, most thinking people do have a very\r\n\r\nreal  fear that there will be an extermination  of\r\n\r\nthe  human race as a whole and certainly of  human\r\n\r\nculture  of  today but we cannot, Sir, survive  in\r\n\r\nany way whatsoever if we are to permit our conduct\r\n\r\nto  be governed by fear. Fear is an inhibitive and\r\n\r\na  corrosive emotion. It is no basis on  which  to\r\n\r\nbuild your future. Though one should recognise the\r\n\r\ngrounds   which   indicate  danger,   one   should\r\n\r\nnevertheless,  in my view, have faith  in  oneself\r\n\r\nand  in  the  future  and this faith  the  Merdeka\r\n\r\nMission  lacked.  Sir,  the  Merdeka  Mission  has\r\n\r\nreturned  as  loyal subjects of the Rt.  Hon.  Mr\r\n\r\nLennox-Boyd and their cries of merdeka  are  empty\r\n\r\ncries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I shall come to my specific objections\r\n\r\nto  this  deformed thing that we have  before  us,\r\n\r\nthis   Report  that  is  not  an  agreement,  this\r\n\r\nagreement that is not an acceptance. Sir, my first\r\n\r\nand  foremost objection - and I hope the Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  (Mr Lim Choon Mong) will hear  this - is\r\n\r\nthat  the agreement gives us much less, I  repeat,\r\n\r\nvery  much  less and I repeat once more, radically\r\n\r\nless   than   what  was  offered   the   Singapore\r\n\r\ndelegation  last May. Now, Sir, unlike the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Serangoon, I do not intend to make a statement\r\n\r\nand  leave  it  alone. I intend to prove  it  with\r\n\r\nchapter and verse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second objection, Sir, is that this document,\r\n\r\nif  and  when it comes into force, makes no change\r\n\r\nto the essential colonial spirit of our status. We\r\n\r\nremain   colonial  subjects.  It  is  a   colonial\r\n\r\ngovernment  and we are under the domination  of  a\r\n\r\nforeign colonial power and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  merely external domination but domination  in\r\n\r\nour every-day life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third objection, Sir, is that the date for\r\n\r\nimplementation of this extraordinary  constitution\r\n\r\nis  of an indefinite character which suggests that\r\n\r\nit  is  never  intended to be brought into  force.\r\n\r\nThis  Assembly  is not entrusted,  Sir,  with  the\r\n\r\nquestion  as to whether the time is ripe to  bring\r\n\r\nit  in  nor can we petition and get a consent.  It\r\n\r\nmust  be a colonial official who, in his goodness,\r\n\r\nmust  be satisfied that the time is ripe to  bring\r\n\r\nin  that  constitution and let me repeat  that  so\r\n\r\nlong  as this Government is an efficient extension\r\n\r\nof  the Colonial Office that long will there be no\r\n\r\nnew  constitution  and  no election,  for  let  us\r\n\r\nrecognise, Sir, that by a simple Order in Council,\r\n\r\nthis  Government can request their friend the  Rt.\r\n\r\nHon.  Mr Alan Lennox-Boyd to continue their  life\r\n\r\nfor ever and ever, amen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are other items of objection to this\r\n\r\nagreement. There is the insistence of the Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice  that we remain under its jurisdiction.  It\r\n\r\nis a petty matter, Sir, when the whole thing is in\r\n\r\na  mess.  Our  insistence at the time was,  \"Look,\r\n\r\nGreat Britain, we want a clean future relationship\r\n\r\nwith  you. We want a relationship of goodwill.  We\r\n\r\nwant an end to struggle. We want a new chapter  in\r\n\r\nour  life,  a chapter of partnership  and  of  co-operation. So do not insist on the Colonial Office\r\n\r\nbeing  the channel of our relationship.  You  pass\r\n\r\nyour   relationship  through  the  sewer  of   the\r\n\r\nColonial  Office. It must stink when  it  gets  to\r\n\r\nthis  end.\" But, Sir, when we have the whole thing\r\n\r\na  stench, what does it matter if it goes  through\r\n\r\nthe  sewer  of the Colonial Office? What  we  have\r\n\r\nnow,  Sir, is not a document that anybody in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  can  pretend is one on which the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore should rest content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, then we have the comic weeping, wailing and\r\n\r\ngnashing   of   teeth   about   the   banning   of\r\n\r\nsubversives, the comic relief which I  shall  come\r\n\r\nto,  in due course, but they are minor matters.  I\r\n\r\nam in a very queer position there, Sir. I consider\r\n\r\nthat it is the duty of the Singapore Government to\r\n\r\nmake such provision in its own Elections Bill  but\r\n\r\nI also consider that it is most improper\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the  Rt.

He knows darned well that it is not so.\r\n\r\nBut  the seconder, the Member for Serangoon,  says\r\n\r\nthat  we  got more than last year. Sir,  you  will\r\n\r\nforgive me if I take some time on this aspect  and\r\n\r\nprove to you not merely that we got radically less\r\n\r\nbut  we  handed  over lock, stock and  barrel  all\r\n\r\ncontrol  over internal security - we who pretend  to\r\n\r\nthe  status,  the powers and the privileges  of  a\r\n\r\nself-governing  territory! Let us  see!  Look  at,\r\n\r\nSir,  the debate of 5th March, 1957, columns  1457\r\n\r\nand  1458. What did this Assembly ask? Without  my\r\n\r\npresence to spur anybody on, Sir, we asked:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... from Her Majesty's Government for the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore the status of a self-governing\r\n\r\nstate  with  all the rights, powers and privileges\r\n\r\nthereto appurtenant in all internal affairs.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That is clear:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... and the control of trade, commerce and\r\n\r\ncultural relations in external affairs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>But  let  us look at this mandate which  has  been\r\n\r\nfulfilled to the hilt: \"We demand the status of  a\r\n\r\nself-governing  state with all the rights,  powers\r\n\r\nand privileges thereto appurtenant in all internal\r\n\r\naffairs.\" Let us look, Sir, at the Report produced\r\n\r\nby  the All-Party Conference to this Assembly last\r\n\r\nmonth and there it says in the clearest terms:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"When the last talks broke down, the Singapore\r\n\r\nMission  had  been offered by the  United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nGovernment  counter proposals to our demands,  and\r\n\r\nthese are set out as Annexure L, Pages 67, 68  and\r\n\r\n69  of  Cmd.

It\r\n\r\nhad  to  receive and consider regular  reports  on\r\n\r\ninternal    security    and    it    could    make\r\n\r\nrecommendations to the Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  and Her Majesty's Government.  So  its\r\n\r\npowers  were of a purely advisory character,  note\r\n\r\nthe nigger in the woodpile (clause 16) which says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nto have power by Order in Council-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to make provision for the fulfilment of\r\n\r\ntheir   responsibilities  in   relation   to\r\n\r\nexternal defence and external affairs.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What is the objection? There really was none. They\r\n\r\nsaid,   \"You  could  have  external  affairs   and\r\n\r\nexternal  defence,\"  but as  the  Colonial  Office\r\n\r\nalways  does in these matters, it never shows  its\r\n\r\nugliness  publicly. It hid it  in  a  document  it\r\n\r\ncalled  Annexure 1 [SCT. (56) 9]  on  page  51  of\r\n\r\nSessional  Paper No. Cmd. 31 of 1956.  It  defines\r\n\r\nexternal  defence  and external  affairs  somewhat\r\n\r\nvery  widely  so  that,  in  fact,  there  was  an\r\n\r\ninfringement  by Her Majesty's Government  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom,  a  sort of a  reserve  power  of\r\n\r\ninterference  in  certain  aspects   of   internal\r\n\r\nsecurity and that was where we protested and  they\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Right, we will re-word and amend it so  as\r\n\r\nto  limit  the area of interference  by  Order  in\r\n\r\nCouncil.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, gentlemen, let me add this very briefly.\r\n\r\nWhat  did we agree in this Report - this Report that\r\n\r\nis  not supposed to be an agreement? Sir, I  think\r\n\r\nthat is what the Hon. the Chief Minister said this\r\n\r\nwas.  \"This was a Report and not an agreement.\"  I\r\n\r\ncannot  blame the Hon, the Chief Minister. Perhaps\r\n\r\nhe  has had no time to read it but if I might draw\r\n\r\nhis attention to the last sentence of paragraph 12\r\n\r\nof  Sessional  Paper No. Misc.  2  of  1957  which\r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The arrangements upon which we have agreed are\r\n\r\nset out in the following sections of this Report.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So if those sections are not in agreement, perhaps\r\n\r\nwe do not speak the same language or perhaps he is\r\n\r\nembarrassed by the fact that section 30 is one  of\r\n\r\nthe sections that are covered by this sentence:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The arrangements upon which we have agreed are\r\n\r\nset out in the following sections of this Report.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, in this agreement that is not an\r\n\r\nagreement but is a Report, what have we got?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Her Majesty's Government indicated that it was\r\n\r\ntheir intention-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Unfortunately, they could not carry it  out.  They\r\n\r\nalways have very good intentions-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"that the new Constitution should confer upon\r\n\r\nSingapore   Ministers  full   responsibility   for\r\n\r\nmaintaining internal law and order and  preventing\r\n\r\nsubversion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And that is what the House asked for:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... the status of a self-governing state with\r\n\r\nall  the  rights,  powers and  privileges  thereto\r\n\r\nappurtenant in all internal affairs ...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  was  Her  Majesty's intention.

Consultation is fair enough. We  can\r\n\r\nlearn from everybody. I am prepared to learn  even\r\n\r\nfrom  a  Communist,  let alone  learning  from  an\r\n\r\nImperialist.   I   am   ready   to   learn.

You\r\n\r\nremember  last  year,  Sir,  we  appealed  to  the\r\n\r\nBritish Government to allow the Chairman to  be  a\r\n\r\nMalayan  appointed by the Chief  Minister  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya and the Tunku was  then  good\r\n\r\nenough to agree to that. That was rejected but now\r\n\r\nfinally the British Government bowed to this minor\r\n\r\nconcession, not as Chairman, but as an  additional\r\n\r\nmember  and  that unquestionably is an improvement\r\n\r\nbut an improvement to a Council that no longer has\r\n\r\nthe  same  character. What do they give you?  They\r\n\r\ngive  you sixpence, they take a hundred quid.  You\r\n\r\ncannot see it, or pretend you cannot see it-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(h) A vote on any matter within the Council's\r\n\r\nfunctions should be regarded as a binding\r\n\r\ndecision, to which immediate effect should be\r\n\r\ngiven by the authorities responsible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Do  you know what that means, Sir? It means  that\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly we will have here, Sir, or  anywhere\r\n\r\nelse,  will be just a puppet. The government  will\r\n\r\nbe  run from the board room. It is true there will\r\n\r\nbe  three members of the Singapore Government, one\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Federation and three  from  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom,  but,  Sir, we will be handing  ourselves\r\n\r\nover to dictatorship of a hidden and secret body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is to be a Federation Minister; so what? I\r\n\r\nam  very  happy that we are to have  a  Federation\r\n\r\nMinister to co-operate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith us, but is anybody suggesting that he\r\n\r\nis  the  angel  Gabriel? Or is anybody  suggesting\r\n\r\nthat sometimes the Singapore Government would  not\r\n\r\nlike  to  evade  its  responsibilities  for  doing\r\n\r\nsomething by making that Council do it? Is anybody\r\n\r\nsuggesting that, in the light of what we have seen\r\n\r\nhappen,  we  are going to be any less colonial  in\r\n\r\nstatus  under that regime, with the secret  board-room  meeting  taking  decisions  which  over-rule\r\n\r\nanything   that  happens  here?   What   kind   of\r\n\r\ngovernment are we going to have? Are we  going  to\r\n\r\nbe puppets with puppet masters in the board-room?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, paragraph 27 (i) says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If there is any disagreement as to whether a\r\n\r\nparticular matter was of internal security, and\r\n\r\ntherefore within the functions of the Council, the\r\n\r\nmatter should be discussed and decided by the\r\n\r\nCouncil\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and in respect of all these decisions they are\r\n\r\nbinding and have the effect of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, paragraph 27 (k) , Sir - \"If the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  failed  to  meet  any  requirement...\".\r\n\r\nSupposing the three gentlemen say, \"We do not like\r\n\r\nit  and  we are sorry that the Federation Minister\r\n\r\nhas agreed with the United Kingdom and we will not\r\n\r\nco-operate\"?

Who  is  responsible? - the   Internal Security  Council for which we ask. It  is  not  a question, Sir, of whether it is going to be abused or  not going to be abused; it means in fact  that democracy is dead, that there is a dictatorship of seven  behind  the  scenes to do  just  what  they\r\n\r\nplease, when they please and how they please,  and\r\n\r\nthat their will, by a majority\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  four  to three, is law. That is our democracy,\r\n\r\nOxford style. [Interruption].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sorry to hold you up; I seem to have\r\n\r\nmislaid  a  document. Sir, I ask  that  I  may  be\r\n\r\npermitted to come back to it later if I  can  find\r\n\r\nthe document from which I seek to read to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Assembly to note this, Sir, and\r\n\r\nif I am wrong, I trust that the Hon. the Attorney-General will tell me how I am wrong, because  this\r\n\r\nis  a serious question; if I err, let the Assembly\r\n\r\nhave  the truth. Sir, not only have we surrendered\r\n\r\nwhen this carrot finally reaches the mouth of  the\r\n\r\ndonkey,  not only have we surrendered our  control\r\n\r\nover  internal  security to this  board  of  seven\r\n\r\ndictators,  but we are creating a third  board  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  the  new Assembly of Singapore.  This  is\r\n\r\nsomething new, something which I do not  think  is\r\n\r\nnecessary; but look, Sir, at paragraph 37. What is\r\n\r\nmy  objection to these secret boards? It  is  very\r\n\r\nsimple, Sir. If you divide power in a way that the\r\n\r\nperson exercising it has no responsibility towards\r\n\r\nthe  people - you cannot fix him personally with the\r\n\r\nresponsibility, you cannot pin him down  and  make\r\n\r\nhim  answer - then in point of fact the area of  his\r\n\r\npower is completely excluded from the jurisdiction\r\n\r\nof  the Assembly and the people's representatives.\r\n\r\nIn  respect  of this Internal Security Council,  I\r\n\r\nsay to you, Sir, the people of Singapore know that\r\n\r\nit   means   that  our  entire  internal  security\r\n\r\nposition will be completely outside the control of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly, that it will be in  the  hands  of\r\n\r\nthis  group  of dictators, and that we  can  never\r\n\r\nknow  their  decisions  because  it  is  a  secret\r\n\r\norganisation, a secret council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example, Sir, how these\r\n\r\nthings  can happen and how the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nand  their representatives can lose any  sense  of\r\n\r\ninitiative  and  self-respect by  making  somebody\r\n\r\nelse   do   the  dirty  work.  When  I  became   a\r\n\r\n\"dictator\",  when  we were in  office,  for  about\r\n\r\nthree weeks, Sir, the question arose as to whether\r\n\r\nwe  were to renew the Emergency Regulations.  Now,\r\n\r\nSir, it was part of our platform\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   review  and  repeal  them  so  much  as   was\r\n\r\nnecessary,  and  at that time  there  was  a  very\r\n\r\nstrong movement for complete repeal. Now, Sir,  it\r\n\r\nwas  part  of  my  duty (the  duty  of  the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary,   it   is  true)  to  investigate   the\r\n\r\nposition; and I may have been wrong, but I think I\r\n\r\nwas  right,  I  believed that  it  was  absolutely\r\n\r\nessential  for our way of life that some  sort  of\r\n\r\npowers of detention should be retained. Naturally,\r\n\r\nI  was  very  embarrassed early in  my  tenure  of\r\n\r\noffice   to   have  to  meet  strong  and   bitter\r\n\r\nopposition.  And I remember, Sir,  that  Sir  John\r\n\r\nNicoll said, \"You repeal the Emergency Regulations\r\n\r\nin the Assembly and your voters will be satisfied.\r\n\r\nI  will  then  reintroduce them by  virtue  of  my\r\n\r\nspecial  reserve  powers,  and  we  will  both  be\r\n\r\nsatisfied.\" Sir, if I were to meet Sir John again,\r\n\r\nI  would apologise to him for being as rude  as  I\r\n\r\nwas.  I thought he was insulting me and the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading this document, Sir, particularly\r\n\r\nthe  weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth  about\r\n\r\nthe ban on subversion being an undemocratic ban, I\r\n\r\nfeel that all Sir John did was to think that I was\r\n\r\njust a normal politician. Sir, that is the kind of\r\n\r\nthing     that    will    happen     again     and\r\n\r\nagain - unscrupulous  politicians  will   not   take\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  necessary  acts   which   may\r\n\r\ntemporarily be unpopular, but will pass  the  buck\r\n\r\nto   the   Internal   Security  Council,   thereby\r\n\r\nconstantly maintaining the sort of tension and the\r\n\r\nsort  of antagonism which we see created the cause\r\n\r\nfor the weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to it, Sir, as I was pointing out to\r\n\r\nyou,  we are to have an InterDepartmental Council,\r\n\r\nand I would like to read paragraph 37:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It was clear that this practical division in the\r\n\r\nhandling of external relations,\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>external relations-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"together with the responsibility of Her Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  defence, made it  necessary  that\r\n\r\nthere  should  be continuous consultation  between\r\n\r\nthe  two  Governments on the many points at  which\r\n\r\ntheir  interests and responsibilities would  touch\r\n\r\nor  overlap.  We had agreed upon the establishment\r\n\r\nof  the Internal Security Council, but noted  that\r\n\r\nits competence was limited strictly to matters  of\r\n\r\ninternal security.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? Last year, there was no necessity for this.\r\n\r\nThen, we did not ask for an additional council.\r\n\r\nWhy this year? Why, except that they want a\r\n\r\nfurther point of control. I read on:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"37. Her Majesty's Government therefore proposed\r\n\r\nthat there should be established some purely\r\n\r\nconsultative-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>but let us see how purely consultative it is-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"- some purely consultative machinery through\r\n\r\nwhich  the  United  Kingdom  Government  and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of Singapore should consult  upon  and\r\n\r\ndiscuss  all  matters  or problems  affecting  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government arising from  Her  Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment's  responsibility for external  affairs\r\n\r\nand  defence.  The Singapore Delegation  indicated\r\n\r\nthat  they  regarded defence and external  affairs\r\n\r\n(save  where  the  latter had  been  delegated  to Singapore)  as being matters entirely  within  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom  sphere, for which  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  could not constitutionally accept  any\r\n\r\nresponsibility: they nevertheless  recognised  the\r\n\r\nneed  for  some consultative arrangements  through\r\n\r\nwhich   Her  Majesty's  Government  could  consult\r\n\r\nSingapore's   interests,   or   make   known   any\r\n\r\nrequirements  arising from their  responsibilities\r\n\r\ninvolving  action  on the part  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"38. We therefore agreed to establish, by\r\n\r\nadministrative   action... an   Inter-Governmental\r\n\r\nCommittee...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now, Sir, this is a purely \"consultative\"\r\n\r\norgan - you will remember. Sir, paragraph 37 says it\r\n\r\nis \"purely consultative\". But the last sentence\r\n\r\nslipped into paragraph 39 says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Except to the extent to which the Council\r\n\r\ndecided that a matter was one of internal\r\n\r\nsecurity, it would be the duty of the Government\r\n\r\nof Singapore to give effect to Her Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment's requirements\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>in this Inter-Departmental Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, we, the Government of Singapore, are to\r\n\r\nbe under the orders of this Inter-Departmental\r\n\r\nCommittee of a \"consultative\" nature to give\r\n\r\neffect to Her Majesty's Government's wishes in the\r\n\r\nrealms of external affairs and external defence.\r\n\r\nLet us read down, Sir. Paragraph 40 says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Conference further agreed that if the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government were to fail to carry out\r\n\r\ntheir duty to meet such requirements, the\r\n\r\nprocedure mentioned in paragraph 27 (k) \"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and remember the words, Sir? - the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara would then be obliged to make an Order on\r\n\r\nthe advice of the Chairman of the Council, on the\r\n\r\nadvice of the British adviser, and this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvice of the British adviser he shall be obliged\r\n\r\nto take-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\" the procedure mentioned in paragraph 27 (k) ,\r\n\r\nwhich relates to the implementation of the\r\n\r\nInternal Security Council, is applicable in this\r\n\r\ncase also. When the requirement related to a Bill\r\n\r\nbefore the Singapore Legislature, which in the\r\n\r\nview of Her Majesty's Government would prejudice\r\n\r\nthe discharge by Her Majesty's Government of their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities, the Chairman of the Security\r\n\r\ncouncil would also have the power to advise the\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara to reserve the Bill for Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's pleasure, and the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nshould then be obliged to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is the position, Sir. Not even on the advice\r\n\r\nof this Inter-Departmental Council, Sir, but if in\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government's discretion it is deemed\r\n\r\nby  Her  Majesty's Government that a  Bill  before\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly is of a character which  prejudices\r\n\r\nthe   discharge  of  Her  Majesty's   Government's\r\n\r\nresponsibility - that is wide enough - then that  Bill\r\n\r\nmust  be  reserved by our Head of  State  for  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's   Government  to   consider,   for   Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's Government's pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are nearing the moment of interruption\r\n\r\nand  although  I have much more to dwell  upon,  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that it may be appropriate at this  juncture\r\n\r\nto   introduce  an  amendment  which  Members  can\r\n\r\nconsider.  I would ask first, Sir, as a matter  of\r\n\r\ninformation, whether I am correct, as  I  think  I\r\n\r\nam, in  saying  that  I may,  after  moving  that\r\n\r\namendment,   proceed   after   the    moment    of\r\n\r\ninterruption, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

To me, it is a statement for which  I  have\r\n\r\nsome  contempt because, first of all, it does  not\r\n\r\naccurately state the facts, and, secondly, I am in\r\n\r\nfavour  of  a ban on subversives participating  in\r\n\r\npolitics.  But  I  am  not in  favour  of  Britain\r\n\r\ninterfering by making the provision a part of  our\r\n\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I would like, in so far as there is\r\n\r\ntime,  to  make clear one aspect of this question,\r\n\r\nand to interpose an explanation of what I mean  by\r\n\r\n\"nevertheless    calls    for    the     immediate\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  the new  Constitution  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis that all persons qualified by residence  for\r\n\r\ncitizenship shall be entitled to vote at the first\r\n\r\nelections\".  Sir,  the  new  constitution   is   a\r\n\r\ncolonial constitution. It gives us nothing to crow\r\n\r\nabout,  but it does give us an opportunity  for  a\r\n\r\nfresh  election for a bigger House,  and  I  feel,\r\n\r\nSir, that there has been a tremendous maturing  of\r\n\r\nthe  people politically. I also feel, for  myself,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  this  House has  now,  shall  we  say,\r\n\r\nexpended  its  utility, and that  it  is  in  fact\r\n\r\nrapidly  becoming  nothing  other  than  a  vested\r\n\r\ninterest which seeks its own perpetuation. I feel,\r\n\r\nSir, that however unfortunate and deformed the new\r\n\r\nconstitution   is,  however  much   of   an   evil\r\n\r\nhunchback,  it  is  better than the  existing  one\r\n\r\nbecause  it will give us a greater opportunity  in\r\n\r\nour  struggle  to  end  our colonial  status.  The\r\n\r\nquicker we get it, the quicker we end it, and that\r\n\r\nis  something  to remember. It is  patent  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore that from this Assembly  they\r\n\r\ncan  expect nothing more; they can expect  nothing\r\n\r\nmore  except an effort to perpetuate their sitting\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason given for not holding elections, Sir,\r\n\r\nis  that  we  have 260,000 citizens, or  potential\r\n\r\ncitizens,  and  that we should  wait  until  these\r\n\r\npeople  are given an opportunity to vote. I  shall\r\n\r\ngo  into  somewhat longer detail  a  little  later\r\n\r\nabout the validity of that excuse. But what  I  do\r\n\r\nsay  is  that we can do it now if we are  sincere,\r\n\r\nSir - and this one is really an attempt to resurrect\r\n\r\nLazarous. The Hon. the Minister for Public  Works,\r\n\r\na  naturalised  Malayan, worked  with  vigour  and\r\n\r\nintegrity  and ability in assisting the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  administration of their government,\r\n\r\nSir, but he cannot know- and he cannot be expected\r\n\r\nto  know- how we feel about this matter of  racial\r\n\r\ndomination   and  racial  inferiority.   And   the\r\n\r\nhonourable  gentleman from Tanjong Pagar,  who  is\r\n\r\nsinging  in Oxford accents the dirge of  democracy\r\n\r\nin  this  House- he is in a particularly fortunate\r\n\r\nposition; and having attained it, he does not have\r\n\r\nto  worry  about whether he or his  family  should\r\n\r\never  feel  the inferiority that the rest  of  the\r\n\r\npeople suffer as a result of colonial rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, let us go back to the question of what\r\n\r\ncan  be done. Everybody tell us anxiously, whether\r\n\r\nit  is  true  or not, they say they  are  anxious,\r\n\r\nanxious  that 270,000 domiciled aliens  should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  immediate citizenship. I say, Sir,  I  will\r\n\r\ngive   it   before   the   new   constitution   is\r\n\r\nintroduced - I will give it now! Section 42  of  the\r\n\r\nColony  Order in Council - I am sorry, Sir, I  am  a\r\n\r\nbit  disorganised this afternoon - no,  section  43,\r\n\r\nSir, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Elected Members of the Assembly shall be\r\n\r\npersons qualified for election in accordance with\r\n\r\nthe provisions of this Order\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>that does not apply-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"and elected in the manner provided by, or in\r\n\r\npursuance of, any law enacted under this Order or\r\n\r\nin pursuance of the Singapore Colony (Electoral\r\n\r\nProvisions) Order in Council, 1954.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So we can make our own laws for election purposes,\r\n\r\nand, in fact, we have made Law No. 26 of 1954, the\r\n\r\nSingapore     Legislative    Assembly    Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance, whereby we provide for persons who  can\r\n\r\nvote. Now, Sir, I say that under section 5 of that\r\n\r\nOrdinance, we have the qualifications for  holding\r\n\r\nelections. Right? Now, we also have the power,  if\r\n\r\nwe  so want, to disqualify criminals (have we  not\r\n\r\ndisqualified  the  undemocratic gentlemen  in  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  Changi  jail?). We  have  disqualified\r\n\r\nthose who are under sentence of imprisonment,  are\r\n\r\nof  unsound mind, corrupt, etc. But under  section\r\n\r\n5,  Sir, we can even make infants elected if we so\r\n\r\nlike.  What  is  there, then, to prevent  us  from\r\n\r\namending  section  5? We can do  it  in  two  days\r\n\r\nwithout  a Certificate of Urgency - amending section\r\n\r\n5 to say\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"includes  all persons domiciled in  Singapore  or\r\n\r\nresident in Singapore for the past 10 years\";  for\r\n\r\nthe first elections only - I do not ask that they be\r\n\r\nmade  permanent;  but the idea is  that,  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst elections, we want to give the vote to these\r\n\r\npeople. We do not want colonial rule (nobody likes\r\n\r\nthat), but we have got to suffer it for two years,\r\n\r\nmay  be three, four, or more, because we must have\r\n\r\nthese alien Chinese on the list of voters. You  do\r\n\r\nnot  hope for Lennox-Boyd to put them on; put them\r\n\r\non  here,  now! I will support it. Why  cannot  we\r\n\r\namend  section 5 (1) and say \"all persons resident\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  for the past 10 years\"?  Right,  it\r\n\r\ntakes  you  two days to pass that. Then,  oh,  how\r\n\r\nlong  does  it  take to get them on the  electoral\r\n\r\nroll?  You  see, Sir, those who have goodwill  can\r\n\r\nget  things  done quickly, but those who  pretend,\r\n\r\nwill   find  a  lot  of  objection.  One  of   the\r\n\r\nobjections is: How long will it take to  get  them\r\n\r\non  the electoral roll? Six weeks, I say, because,\r\n\r\ngentlemen, nobody has got to go and register!  The\r\n\r\nbeauty  of  this suggestion is that  we  have  the\r\n\r\nIdentity  Card  system - bless  the  Identity   Card\r\n\r\nsystem;  we have the Identity Card system and  all\r\n\r\nthe  names are registered. Let the Chief Secretary\r\n\r\ncorrect me - he has got all the information and  it\r\n\r\nshould  not take more than six weeks to  pick  out\r\n\r\neverybody   who   has  10  years'   residence   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. So it takes you six weeks to  get  your\r\n\r\nelectoral roll out after two days, and that  makes\r\n\r\n44 days. Let us imagine the miracle taking place - I\r\n\r\nalways   have  faith  in  miracles,   Sir!   After\r\n\r\nall -[Interruption]- you  laugh,  but  did  not  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister  yesterday accept our  motions  on\r\n\r\ncorruption? Is he not perhaps going to accept  the\r\n\r\namendment  to  the Clerical Workers Bill  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  legalise strikes? Amen to that.  Sir,  why\r\n\r\nshould  not  we believe in miracles? I believe  in\r\n\r\nmiracles;   I  am  hoping  that  this  effort   to\r\n\r\nresuscitate Lazarous will be successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to go back to the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In  any division in  Singapore,  I  am\r\n\r\nprepared  to stand against the gentleman  who  has\r\n\r\nthe majority of votes, and I say to him: I will go\r\n\r\nto his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstituency   if  he  will   go   back   to   his\r\n\r\nconstituency, and I will challenge him there-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Accepted!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

We can have it open for objections for\r\n\r\nanother  six weeks, and we can be ready  in  three\r\n\r\nmonths.  It  is to be remembered that  though  Mr\r\n\r\nLennox-Boyd promised us a State of Singapore  last\r\n\r\nyear,  we  are  now having a new  constitution  by\r\n\r\nOrder in Council; so we do not have to worry about\r\n\r\ngoing  to Parliament - we are remaining a colony  by\r\n\r\nOrder  in  Council, and an Order  in  Council  can\r\n\r\neasily  be prepared within three months. There  is\r\n\r\nno  need of our worrying about an amendment to the\r\n\r\nBritish  Nationality and Status of Aliens Act  for\r\n\r\nthe  simple reason that this Bill is not providing\r\n\r\nimmediately  for aliens to become  citizens - it  is\r\n\r\nproviding  to give them the right to vote  at  the\r\n\r\nfirst  elections. And in due course - as  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister   said,  it  takes  time  to  amend   the\r\n\r\nNationality Status Act, and it takes time to  open\r\n\r\nthe registration bureau, it takes time to register\r\n\r\n230,000  people  and we should  have  at  least  a\r\n\r\nyear - (and  I  myself agree they  should  have  two\r\n\r\nyears) - they can register, after having  voted  for\r\n\r\nthe  new  Assembly  and the new  constitution,  as\r\n\r\ncitizens of a new State instead of registering  as\r\n\r\ncitizens  of this still Colony of Singapore.  Now,\r\n\r\nSir,  this  will be objected to - I  shall  have  to\r\n\r\nanswer  objections, since I am  the  mover  of  an\r\n\r\namendment and I have no right of reply - it will  be\r\n\r\nobjected  that those aliens will have to take  the\r\n\r\noath of allegiance. That is the only objection  of\r\n\r\nsome  validity which I can foresee, and the answer\r\n\r\nis  very simply this: if a man is evil-minded,  if\r\n\r\nhis loyalty is elsewhere,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno  oath of allegiance can make him change. But  I\r\n\r\ndo not believe that there are many of those people\r\n\r\namong  the 270,000 whom we seek to attract as  our\r\n\r\ncitizens.  I  know them and I say I  believe  that\r\n\r\nthey  are men of stability, men of sincerity, that\r\n\r\nthey are loyal to this land; and I cannot envisage\r\n\r\nany  real danger in giving them the right to  vote\r\n\r\nin  the  first elections before they can take  out\r\n\r\ncitizenship  papers, the right  to  vote  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  elections  without taking  out  any  oaths,\r\n\r\nwithout registering themselves, just by virtue  of\r\n\r\nthe fact that they have been 10 years in Singapore\r\n\r\nin    accordance   with   their   Identity    Card\r\n\r\nregistration form which indicates their residence.\r\n\r\nSir,  it  is  simplicity itself,  just  as  it  is\r\n\r\nsimplicity itself whereby the Singapore Delegation\r\n\r\nhas   destroyed  and  suspended  merdeka  by  that\r\n\r\nparagraph  27.

Last year,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  frankly did not consider that we had failed. We\r\n\r\nwere  seeking,  and  seeking  with  sincerity,   a\r\n\r\ntremendous  advance, something  that  was  in  the\r\n\r\nnature of a Holy Grail for us. Sir, a setback  and\r\n\r\na  failure at the first trial is not a failure.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  consider that we failed. We had bulldozed\r\n\r\nour  way to a very short distance of the goal. The\r\n\r\nball  was still in motion; the position, Sir,  was\r\n\r\nexcellent;  and  the prospects were  perfect.  But\r\n\r\ntoday,  Sir,  today I consider I had  failed,  and\r\n\r\nthis  is my failure: This Report before the House,\r\n\r\nthe  subject  of the motion, this is  my  failure,\r\n\r\nbecause  you  cannot go back  on  what  they  have\r\n\r\nsigned  away,  not at the moment, not  until  this\r\n\r\nabortion  is  in force and a new people,  the  new\r\n\r\npeople, the new representatives of Singapore, have\r\n\r\nthe   opportunity  themselves  to  undo  what  the\r\n\r\nMission has done, if in fact it is not too late. I\r\n\r\nmyself fear this, Sir: I fear that my motion  will\r\n\r\nbe  lost.  I have seen, and I intend to  prove  to\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly, the lack of enthusiasm on the part\r\n\r\nof  Government  for an early election.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  it  will  continue or seek  to  continue  in\r\n\r\noffice until the full length of its legal term  in\r\n\r\nApril 1959. I believe it will seek to continue  in\r\n\r\noffice  thereafter  by Order  in  Council  of  the\r\n\r\nColonial Office. And I believe that, thereby,  the\r\n\r\nseeds of democracy which we sought to nurture will\r\n\r\nwither  and  die,  and  that the  alternative,  an\r\n\r\nalternative  that  bodes ill for  Singapore,  will\r\n\r\nthen  be the only means of change. Sir, I did  not\r\n\r\naccept what I was given and I was not sorry; I did\r\n\r\nnot  accept what we were given because I  believed\r\n\r\nthat   more  was  necessary  and  more  could   be\r\n\r\nobtained.  I  have faith in the men  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if, on the other hand, it is true that the\r\n\r\nreason given for the delay in new elections is  to\r\n\r\ngive  a  vote to those new citizens - I  shall  deal\r\n\r\nwith  the  question tomorrow - we can  achieve  that\r\n\r\nnow.  And  I  say we should achieve that  now,  by\r\n\r\nsimply amending the Singapore Legislative Assembly\r\n\r\nOrdinance,   that  we  could  quite  easily   hold\r\n\r\nelections in July. In the new Assembly at least we\r\n\r\nwill  have  a fresh outlook, at least we  can  say\r\n\r\nthat the people have put\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  democratically elected persons who remain  in\r\n\r\noffice for serving the people and not merely  for\r\n\r\npurposes of holding power. It can be done; it can\r\n\r\nbe  done  today. It can be done and it should  be\r\n\r\ndone.  If we want to maintain and attract respect\r\n\r\nfor  democratic processes, which means  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  have their own form of government,  which\r\n\r\nshould  be their government, one which  they  are\r\n\r\nprepared to accept - we can only do that by  giving\r\n\r\nthem  an  opportunity for an election. Otherwise,\r\n\r\nSir,  if  we refuse them this, we refuse them  an\r\n\r\nimprovement  in their colonial status  which  the\r\n\r\nnew  constitution  does give. Although  it  is  a\r\n\r\ncolonial   constitution,  it  does  improve   the\r\n\r\nconditions  of  struggle  of  the  people,  their\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  make their voice  heard.  If  we\r\n\r\nrefuse this amendment, it means that we intend to\r\n\r\ndeprive  them  of the opportunity to  have  those\r\n\r\nbetter  conditions  now, and that  we  intend  to\r\n\r\nimpose  our  desire to continue sitting  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  and  holding office for the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  irrespective  of  their  welfare   and\r\n\r\nwishes.  If we do that, we deal a mortal blow  to\r\n\r\nany hope of respect for democratic processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I have pointed out that my main\r\n\r\nargument, my main objection, to this constitution\r\n\r\nwas   that  we  will  be  handing  over  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity to a body outside the control of and not\r\n\r\nresponsible to the people of Singapore.  To  that\r\n\r\nextent,  Sir, it is a farce to speak about  self-government  with  all powers and  privileges.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  this is a radical alteration of a  greatly\r\n\r\nprejudicial character to the one Britain  offered\r\n\r\nus  last  year. And in addition to this,  we  now\r\n\r\nhave  a so-called Consultative Inter-Departmental\r\n\r\nCouncil which will have a right to order our Head\r\n\r\nof   State  to  enforce  its  will,  and  a  High\r\n\r\nCommissioner who will have power to order and  to\r\n\r\nenforce his will in respect of matters which they\r\n\r\ndeem   to  be  within  their  realm  of  external\r\n\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the second objection of ours which I raised\r\n\r\nwas that this was an \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nessentially   colonial   constitution.   Sir,   our\r\n\r\noriginal hopes were for a status of freedom which\r\n\r\nwould  have  the  respect  of  our  fellow  human\r\n\r\nbeings. Sir, last year, we said in our memorandum\r\n\r\nto  the  British Government - and this  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nalso signed - on page 22 we said that we have every\r\n\r\nright to be as independent as any other member of\r\n\r\nthe   Commonwealth  in  spite  of  our  area  and\r\n\r\npopulation.  We see paragraph 4 at  page  22  and\r\n\r\nthen,  Sir,  at page 47 - on which also the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas  now  changed its views and said we  are  too\r\n\r\nsmall to be independent - this is what we said:\r\n\r\n(This was delivered to the British Government on 1st May, 1956):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(3) We are firmly convinced that the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  have matured to a point  where  it  is\r\n\r\nessential  for  their healthy  growth  that  they\r\n\r\nshould  be  free  to  shape  their  destiny.  Our\r\n\r\ngeographical position and racial content offer an\r\n\r\ninspiring  challenge  and unique  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nmake  our  contribution to the concept of  inter-racial  amity and cooperation and the  growth  of\r\n\r\ndemocratic  institutions. We can be  adequate  to\r\n\r\nour   opportunities  only  if  we  are  free   of\r\n\r\ncontrols,  however well meant, which  prevent  us\r\n\r\nfrom  finding our feet through the normal process\r\n\r\nof trial and error with all the risks inherent in\r\n\r\nliving.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>We can even now -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.
