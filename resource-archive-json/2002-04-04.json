Consumer demand for  the  various\r\n\r\ngrades  of  petrol  determines the overall  demand.   On  the\r\n\r\nsupply  side, costs depend on several factors, including  the\r\n\r\ncosts  of  storage and distribution, the prices of crude  oil\r\n\r\nand  wholesale petrol, and the foreign exchange rates.  Crude\r\n\r\noil  prices account for about 20% of the pump price.  In  the\r\n\r\nshort  run,  as  consumer  demand does  not  adjust  rapidly,\r\n\r\nchanges  in  pump prices generally reflect changes  in  these\r\n\r\ncost   factors.    However,  because  of  the   oligopolistic\r\n\r\nstructure  of  the industry, prices tend to  be  sticky  both\r\n\r\nways.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) has asked\r\n\r\nthe oil companies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  justify the recent increases in petrol pump prices.   One\r\n\r\nof  the oil companies, ExxonMobil, has explained in detail in\r\n\r\nthe  Straits  Times on 28th March that the rise in  wholesale\r\n\r\npetrol  prices  since January this year was the  main  factor\r\n\r\nthat contributed to its decision to raise petrol pump prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key question is whether there is price fixing by the\r\n\r\noil companies.  Looking at the fluctuations, the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nTrade and Industry finds no evidence of collusion by the  oil\r\n\r\ncompanies  either  to  restrict supply or  to  raise  prices.\r\n\r\nEither  would be frowned upon by the Government and would  be\r\n\r\nillegal once we put in place a Competition Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent price increases follow decreases in petrol\r\n\r\nprices  last  year.   For the period between  July  2001  and\r\n\r\nDecember  2001,  crude oil prices fell by approximately  26%.\r\n\r\nAround the same period, and after taking into account a  time\r\n\r\nlag,  petrol pump prices fell by 14%.  Part of this reflected\r\n\r\nthe  reduction in petrol taxes announced in October  2001  as\r\n\r\npart  of the off-Budget measures.  I have circulated a  chart\r\n\r\nshowing  changes in the prices of crude oil and  petrol  from\r\n\r\n1993  to  February  this year.  Last  year,  I  circulated  a\r\n\r\nsimilar chart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20020404/20020404-HA-0740457.gif\">Import Price Index for Crude Oil (1998 = 100) and Consumer Price Index for Petrol (1998 = 100) - January 1993 - February 2002</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep the retail market for petrol as competitive as\r\n\r\npossible,   our  policy  is  to  facilitate  the   entry   of\r\n\r\nindependent petrol retailers.  Last year, I announced to  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  we  were planning to introduce \"white  pumpers\".\r\n\r\nThese  are  petrol-pumping facilities annexed to supermarkets\r\n\r\nand  commercial buildings.  MND has identified several  sites\r\n\r\nbut  detailed studies need to be made to ensure that  safety,\r\n\r\ntraffic  flow  and  environmental requirements  can  be  met.\r\n\r\nAfter  September 11, the security considerations have  become\r\n\r\nmore severe and this has caused a delay in the sites that  we\r\n\r\nintend  to  let  out  for  white pumps.   Some  parties  have\r\n\r\nexpressed interest to operate these white pumps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, if there is no\r\n\r\nprice  fixing among the major petroleum companies, why is  it\r\n\r\nthat  price  increases are always more or less  by  the  same\r\n\r\nquantum  amongst the oil companies, and why is  it  that  the\r\n\r\nprice increase takes place almost on the same day?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a\r\n\r\nwell   known  phenomenon  in  economics.   When  an  industry\r\n\r\nstructure reflects high fixed cost and, where there  are  few\r\n\r\nplayers involved, normally, the lowest cost producer will  be\r\n\r\nthe  price leader and the rest will follow suit.  In such  an\r\n\r\nindustry, there is a tendency for price instability  and  for\r\n\r\nprice wars to happen.  So the smaller players have to be very\r\n\r\ncareful  not to trigger off a chain of events which may  lead\r\n\r\nto  price wars and they will normally take the lead from  the\r\n\r\nprice  leader.   This is called monopolistic  competition  by\r\n\r\nsome  economists.  It reflects the nature of  competition  in\r\n\r\noligopolistic  structures.  The airline  industry  faces  the\r\n\r\nsame   problem.   Many  chemical  industries  face  the  same\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, if that is the case, why is it\r\n\r\nthat  the  smallest petroleum company in Singapore, which  is\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Petroleum Company,  with  only  five  or  six\r\n\r\noutlets  in Singapore has managed to keep its price  low  and\r\n\r\nhas not increased price and, in fact, is offering a discount?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nknow, but I can guess that its position in the market is  too\r\n\r\nsmall  for  it  to cause sufficient reaction from  the  other\r\n\r\nplayers.  Oil companies compete in different ways, some offer\r\n\r\nfree  tissue paper, some offer loyalty programmes.  So  there\r\n\r\nare  different  ways  to  compete and  to  hold  on  to  your\r\n\r\ncustomers.   The  question is: should MTI  intervene  in  the\r\n\r\nmarket?   We  should intervene if it is clear that  there  is\r\n\r\nabuse of dominant position, or if there is price fixing.   As\r\n\r\nI said, if you look at the chart which I have distributed and\r\n\r\nif  I may draw Members' attention to it, we have two indices,\r\n\r\none is crude oil prices which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfluctuate  quite  a  lot and are going up  again  because  of\r\n\r\ntension in the Middle East.  Then we have fluctuating with  a\r\n\r\ntime  lag, in a much more sticky way, variations in the price\r\n\r\nof  premium petrol.  I can understand why as consumers we get\r\n\r\nvery  upset  when  we see pump prices going  up.   When  pump\r\n\r\nprices  go down, it attracts less attention.  This is natural\r\n\r\nas  consumers.  These indices reflect nominal prices.  If you\r\n\r\nlook  at  the price in January this year and compare  it  to,\r\n\r\nsay, January 1993, nominal prices have not changed very much.\r\n\r\nBut I do not think that on the basis of prices we can draw an\r\n\r\nautomatic  conclusion  that  oil companies  are  deliberately\r\n\r\nfixing oil prices at high levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> One last question, Sir. Would it not\r\n\r\nbe more logical to suggest that the larger oil companies, and\r\n\r\nquite  naturally, will enjoy larger economies of  scale  than\r\n\r\nthe smallest oil company and they are in a better position to\r\n\r\nfollow  the  price set by the smallest company  which  is,  I\r\n\r\npresume, still making good profits?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not\r\n\r\nfamiliar  with the prices offered by these five SPC  outlets.\r\n\r\nI  do  not know whether they have the same loyalty programme,\r\n\r\nwhether they offer the same free gifts and points ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> $1.234 less 10%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Do they offer the same points?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> No.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Consumers will make their own\r\n\r\ndecision whether they want to collect points, or whether they\r\n\r\nwant  to  take lower upfront prices.  But let us say that  Mr\r\n\r\nTan  is right that these five outlets offer prices which  are\r\n\r\nmuch lower than the other retail outlets, then consumers will\r\n\r\nvote  with their wheels, which means that when new sites  are\r\n\r\navailable  for  tendering, SPC will be able to  offer  higher\r\n\r\nprices   for   these  sites  because  they  are   much   more\r\n\r\ncompetitive.  In other words, the market should  be  able  to\r\n\r\nresolve this problem, if there is a problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> The\r\n\r\nMinister tries to justify that there is no price fixing among\r\n\r\nthe oil companies.  So he tries to use the crude oil price in\r\n\r\nrelation to the premium petrol price.  If you really look  at\r\n\r\nthe  drastic increase and fluctuations of the crude oil price\r\n\r\nas  compared with the relatively moderate fluctuation of  the\r\n\r\npremium petrol price from the chart, I would like to ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  does  he  arrive  at the conclusion  that,  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  in fact, the oil companies are making lesser  profit\r\n\r\nas a result of the adjustment of the pump price.  That is the\r\n\r\nfirst question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is that the chart does not reflect\r\n\r\nthe  profit level of the oil companies.  I think what  people\r\n\r\nare  actually unhappy about is the high petrol price and that\r\n\r\nhas resulted in high profits by the petroleum companies.   So\r\n\r\nif  you  look  at the international petroleum spot  price,  I\r\n\r\nwould like the Minister to comment whether I am right or  not\r\n\r\non  this particular matter.  The international petroleum spot\r\n\r\nprice for 98 RON petrol ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, could you ask your question?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc.

Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> I am asking the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether I am right or not.  The 98 RON petrol price based  on\r\n\r\nthe  international petroleum spot price on  12th  March  this\r\n\r\nyear  was  32.9  cents per litre and the  pump  price,  after\r\n\r\ndeduction of the Government tax, the margin gained  was  42.4\r\n\r\ncents.   Assuming  that I am not familiar with  the  cost  of\r\n\r\noperation  -  the  cost  is  not much  because  we  are  very\r\n\r\ncompetitive in terms of our so-called business costs  -  they\r\n\r\nare  making 130% margin from the international petroleum spot\r\n\r\nprice.  I would like to ask the Minister whether this kind of\r\n\r\nmargin is  acceptable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not\r\n\r\nreally  in a position to answer that question.  The  data  is\r\n\r\nnot available to me.  We do not require them to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresented  or audited by any regulatory agency.   It  may  be\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  a  higher  margin,  but  then  the  cost  of\r\n\r\ndistributing petrol is not cheap either.  They  have  got  to\r\n\r\ntender for the sites.  They have got to ensure that safety is\r\n\r\nmaintained.   They have got to hire people, many  operate  24\r\n\r\nhours.   The cost structure varies from industry to industry,\r\n\r\nfrom  product to product, and the fact that there is  a  high\r\n\r\nmargin over the wholesale price, by itself, does not indicate\r\n\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A matter of principle is this. Should Government be\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  whether oil companies are  making  money  or\r\n\r\nlosing  money?   If we decide that we are going  to  regulate\r\n\r\nprices  and  regulate profits, then there is no  end  to  it.\r\n\r\nSome  years  ago, one major oil company protested strenuously\r\n\r\nto  MTI  that MND was releasing more sites for petrol  pumps.\r\n\r\nIt  had earlier tendered for sites thinking that we are going\r\n\r\nto restrict the number of these sites and so it paid a lot of\r\n\r\nmoney at the tender.  So he came to me and said, \"Look.  Yes,\r\n\r\nit  was not legal but surely there was an understanding.\"   I\r\n\r\nsaid, \"I am sorry.  MND has its own policy on the release  of\r\n\r\nsites  for  petrol  pumps and these are the  risks  that  you\r\n\r\ntake.\"   So we are not responsible for the losses they  make,\r\n\r\nneither  are we responsible for the profits they  make.   But\r\n\r\nfor  Dr  Low's exact question as to whether the  margins  are\r\n\r\njustifiable  or  not,  I  am in no  position  to  answer  his\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask the Minister what measure will MTI consider  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  consumers'  interest  will  be  safeguarded  in\r\n\r\nsectors  like  this where there is little or no  competition.\r\n\r\nBesides  white  pumps, how can we introduce more  competition\r\n\r\ninto the petrol retail sector?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are open\r\n\r\nto  suggestions.   White pump was an  idea  suggested  to  us\r\n\r\nslightly  over a year ago and we thought it was a good  idea.\r\n\r\nWhite  pumps  are available in some countries, like  Britain,\r\n\r\nwhere  they have attained a certain market share  and  so  we\r\n\r\ndecided to introduce them.  If CASE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  anyone  here  has  got ideas on  how  to  introduce  more\r\n\r\ncompetition  to the business, MTI keeps an open mind.   There\r\n\r\nis no reason for us to want to restrict competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our general policy towards the economy is that\r\n\r\ncompetition  is  good and competition should  be  encouraged.\r\n\r\nShould  we  regulate to ensure competition,  like  through  a\r\n\r\nCompetition Law, which is the question which has been  raised\r\n\r\na few times in this House?  There is a draft being circulated\r\n\r\namong  the  Ministries and various economic agencies.   There\r\n\r\nare  a  lot of problems because, sometimes, when you regulate\r\n\r\nto  force competition, you may in fact end up creating  anti-competitive  practices and imposing  a  higher  cost  on  the\r\n\r\neconomy.   The  key  is  to regulate, but  regulate  lightly.\r\n\r\nRight  now,  the various regulatory agencies are  responsible\r\n\r\nfor   competitive behaviour within the sectors they regulate,\r\n\r\neg, in telecoms, power, health care or whatever.  But whether\r\n\r\nthere  should  be  an  overarching  competition  law,  it  is\r\n\r\nsomething that we are now considering seriously.  We have not\r\n\r\ndecided  definitely to proceed.  It is likely that  we  will,\r\n\r\nbut  the  details are very important and we are  making  sure\r\n\r\nthat  before  we  present  a Bill  to  this  House,  we  have\r\n\r\nconsulted widely with the industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nmay  I  ask  the Minister whether the increase in oil  prices\r\n\r\nwill  lead to an increase in electricity tariffs, and whether\r\n\r\nthe  Government  will  soften the  impact  on  consumers  and\r\n\r\nbusinesses, if there is any such increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The increases in energy prices\r\n\r\nmust  be  reflected in electricity tariffs.

We  must  ensure that  the  signals  get  passed\r\n\r\nthrough  to  the  economy so that every  consumer  and  every\r\n\r\nindustry  makes  its own adjustments to these price  signals.\r\n\r\nShould the Government ameliorate it?  I would be against  the\r\n\r\nGovernment ameliorating it directly, because then we would be\r\n\r\nmaking  electricity artificially cheaper and, if  we  do  so,\r\n\r\nthere will be an over\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsumption  of electricity.

I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to ask the Minister, because he touched  on  the\r\n\r\nissue of tender prices for petrol kiosks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the tender prices that have been accepted in\r\n\r\nthe  past, I would like the Minister to comment whether I  am\r\n\r\nright  that  they  are  still very profitable  based  on  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  scenario.  When a petrol station is available  for\r\n\r\ntender  and the land is about 30,000 square feet, the  common\r\n\r\ntender price will be around $10 million.  If we work that out\r\n\r\nin  simple  mathematical terms, it will be  around  $300  per\r\n\r\nsquare  foot for a 30-year lease.  If, let us say  the  price\r\n\r\nworks  out  to be equivalent to a 99-year lease,  the  tender\r\n\r\nprice  for  a  petrol  station in a  noisy,  dirty  and  very\r\n\r\nunattractive  roadside would be even more than  that  for  an\r\n\r\nOxley  Road residential land.  If they tender for a piece  of\r\n\r\nland  at  that kind of price and the profit is not good,  why\r\n\r\nshould they do so?

Today is the  fourth\r\n\r\nday  of  this debate.  As more than 40 speakers have  already\r\n\r\nrisen  to  speak, I would just like to focus on a  couple  of\r\n\r\nspecific  issues.   I support the Motion  of  Thanks  to  the\r\n\r\nPresident moved by Mrs Lim Hwee Hua.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Competition is global</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Address, the President has highlighted the\r\n\r\nimmense   challenges  we  face  and  the  impact  of   global\r\n\r\ncompetition.  Indeed, competition is global and is coming not\r\n\r\njust  from  China and the region.  The World  Economic  Forum\r\n\r\nrecently    reported   that   Singapore's    global    growth\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness has slipped two notches from second to fourth\r\n\r\nplacing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, Singapore has been holding the No. 1 or\r\n\r\nNo. 2 position, and our good rating has been well publicised.\r\n\r\nBut  little has been said about the drop in our ranking  this\r\n\r\ntime  round.   For the first time, we have been overtaken  by\r\n\r\nFinland  and  Canada.   Fast closing  up  behind  us  include\r\n\r\nAustralia, Norway and Taiwan, whose rankings have improved by\r\n\r\nthree to nine positions within one year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The need to stay ahead</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we do to tackle the present challenges determines\r\n\r\nour  future.   Do  we despair and lose hope, do  nothing  and\r\n\r\nallow others to overtake us?  Do we dismiss it and be content\r\n\r\nwith the slack,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthinking  that things must somehow get better when the  world\r\n\r\neconomy gets moving again?  Or are we content to say there is\r\n\r\nno  need  to stay at the top all the time?  If our answer  to\r\n\r\nthe  above questions is yes, we run the risk of being  tossed\r\n\r\nout  of  the  race and get left behind.  We  have  to  regain\r\n\r\nspeed, make bold strides to catch up and stay ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not be daunted by the challenges before us. We\r\n\r\nmust  not be disheartened or feel hopeless.  On the contrary,\r\n\r\nwe  can turn them to our advantage.  We can do with a healthy\r\n\r\ndose  of  the  \"siege mentality\".  We, like the employees  of\r\n\r\nsuccessful global companies, should be driven with a sense of\r\n\r\nurgency  and purpose.  We must not be complacent.  Microsoft,\r\n\r\nthe  No. 1 PC software company, has been described to  behave\r\n\r\nas if it were No. 2 and trying to play catch-up all the time.\r\n\r\nNokia succeeded in overtaking its much larger competitors who\r\n\r\nhad  the first-mover advantage.  Now that Nokia is No. 1,  it\r\n\r\nfights  even harder to stay ahead.  These companies all  know\r\n\r\nthat  once  you slip, you can go all the way down  and  never\r\n\r\nreturn to the days of glory.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Challenges not unique</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenges Singapore faces are not unique. I would\r\n\r\nlike  to add to what Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee said yesterday\r\n\r\nabout Hong Kong with my own personal observations.  I was  in\r\n\r\nZhuhai,  China, last week.  I took the ferry to Hong Kong  on\r\n\r\nGood  Friday  to  catch the SQ flight back home.   Going  the\r\n\r\nother way were thousands of Hongkongers leaving Hong Kong for\r\n\r\nmainland China.  The ferries were packed and we had to  fight\r\n\r\nthrough  long  queues  of  people  waiting  to  buy  tickets.\r\n\r\nHongkongers go to Macau, Zhuhai and Shenzhen by the  hundreds\r\n\r\nof  thousands everyday for dinner, movies and other forms  of\r\n\r\nentertainment.  On a bad day, one has to stand more than  one\r\n\r\nhour  to  clear immigration at the Hong Kong-Shenzhen  border\r\n\r\ncrossing.   Things are cheaper across the waters.  People  go\r\n\r\nwhere  they find better value for their money, especially  in\r\n\r\nthese lean times.  When money\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  aplenty, people found it inconvenient to travel a little\r\n\r\ndistance, just to save some money.  But, now, where  they  do\r\n\r\nnot  make  thousands of dollars in one day  just  buying  and\r\n\r\nselling  shares, or hundreds of thousands of  dollars  buying\r\n\r\nand selling properties, every dollar counts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst it is important for us to build first-class\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  and  facilities and adopt  the  world's  best\r\n\r\npractices,  we  have to be mindful of the  cost  burden  that\r\n\r\nlocal businesses have to bear which, in turn, would translate\r\n\r\ninto higher prices for the consumers.  Sir, to overcome this,\r\n\r\nwe  have to attract and retain good businesses to our  shores\r\n\r\nwhich  will in turn generate the purchasing power to  support\r\n\r\nother local businesses and make this a thriving place.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>People - the differentiating factor</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then do we achieve competitive differentiation in\r\n\r\nthis   global  environment?   Others  can  import  the   same\r\n\r\ntechnology  and  talent  to build the  same  or  even  better\r\n\r\nfactory,  airport and seaport.  It must be the people  factor\r\n\r\nthat is our strategic resource.  Responding to the challenges\r\n\r\nwe  face  means  that  we, the people,  have  to  change  our\r\n\r\nmindset.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to cite an example. A couple of years ago, I\r\n\r\ndid  some  renovations to my house and wanted  some  lighting\r\n\r\npoints  fixed up.  The main contractor, who drove a  Mercedes\r\n\r\nBenz,  asked  me  to show him where I wanted  those  lighting\r\n\r\npoints.   So I went round the house with him and pointed  out\r\n\r\nthe  spots.   The next day, another man, the electrical  sub-contractor, came round in a Honda Accord and told me that  he\r\n\r\nunderstood I wanted some lights to be put up and he asked  me\r\n\r\nto  show him where.  I did that.  The next day, two men  came\r\n\r\non a 50cc Honda Cub with Johor number plates and told me that\r\n\r\nthey were there to do the job and asked me to show them where\r\n\r\nI wanted the lights to be installed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Knowledge acquisition and skill development</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first word in \"KBE\" is \"knowledge\". We cannot\r\n\r\nmerely be brokers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand middlemen in a knowledge-based economy.  Our workers, our\r\n\r\npeople,  must  change their mindset and their attitudes.   We\r\n\r\nmust want to acquire knowledge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A manager of an MNC shared this observation with me. He\r\n\r\nsaid  that while Singapore workers are hardworking,  they  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  an inquiring mind.  When a sophisticated high-tech\r\n\r\npiece  of  equipment is installed, our workers are  generally\r\n\r\nquite  contented  to  be told how to operate  the  equipment.\r\n\r\nThey  do  not have the desire to go beyond that  and  try  to\r\n\r\nfathom   the   \"whys\"  and  the  \"hows\".   They   will   take\r\n\r\ninstructions  on  how to operate it and,  if  something  goes\r\n\r\nwrong, the company has to call in the foreign experts.  It is\r\n\r\nlike  buying  a  car and learning how to  drive  it  and  not\r\n\r\nwanting  to  open the bonnet.  If something goes wrong,  call\r\n\r\nthe   workshop.    I   know  today's   automobiles   are   so\r\n\r\nsophisticated that there is nothing an amateur  mechanic  can\r\n\r\ndo  if  it  breaks down, but I hope we know at least  how  to\r\n\r\nchange the tyre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not need to acquire the whole technology. Let me\r\n\r\ncite this example.  I know a Norwegian.  He is spending a lot\r\n\r\nof  his  time now in Singapore.  For many years,  he  was  an\r\n\r\nengineer in Norway installing and maintaining pumps  for  oil\r\n\r\ncompanies in the North Sea.  These pumps are part of a larger\r\n\r\nsystem.   He  just  concentrated on the pumps.   But  he  was\r\n\r\nwilling to stick to his area of expertise and, in the  course\r\n\r\nof  his many years of experience, he found out which areas in\r\n\r\nthe  pump can be improved for better performance.  Today,  he\r\n\r\nowns a number of patents and he is here selling his own pumps\r\n\r\nto our GLCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move up the economic ladder and progress to the\r\n\r\nmore  unstructured \"innovation\" state, we need to be thinkers\r\n\r\nand  not  just  mere doers.  We need people who question  the\r\n\r\ngiven  and  seek new ways to improve.  We need to breed  more\r\n\r\nrisk-takers and foster an entrepreneurial spirit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there seems to be a misconception that\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs are necessarily school drop-outs.  I know there\r\n\r\nare a few laudable examples of drop-outs who made it big.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir  success  stories grab media attention  and  create  an\r\n\r\nimpression  that university education is a hindrance  to  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of entrepreneurship.  Perhaps, when opportunities\r\n\r\nare  aplenty,  it is those with less formal education,  those\r\n\r\nwho  have  to  take bigger risks, who have found  alternative\r\n\r\nroutes  to  success.  But in today's competitive  world,  one\r\n\r\nmust not disregard the acquisition of knowledge and skills to\r\n\r\nhave a fighting chance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Managing Director of an MNC told me that the most\r\n\r\ncreative  person  in  his  company is  the  Chief  Technology\r\n\r\nOfficer who has doctorates in a number of disciplines and who\r\n\r\nis  willing  to  think out of the box.  With  his  wealth  of\r\n\r\ntechnical knowledge and his years of practical experience, he\r\n\r\nis  able  to come up with very creative solutions to  complex\r\n\r\nproblems,   something  that  a  younger  person,  with   less\r\n\r\ntechnical  know-how and less training, would not be  able  to\r\n\r\ndo.   While  we  celebrate  the success  stories  of  instant\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs,  we must not forget the tens of  thousands  of\r\n\r\nscientists,  researchers and developers  who  toil  away  and\r\n\r\nchurn  out  patents by the millions and help to  sustain  the\r\n\r\ntechnological development of the largest MNCs of  this  world\r\n\r\nand make these successful MNCs what they are today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are no short cuts. The days of easy money\r\n\r\nare  gone for now.  We must be realistic and go back  to  the\r\n\r\nbasics, to the virtue of work and enterprise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Developing strong local enterprises</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although MNCs have and will continue to play a critical\r\n\r\nrole  in  our  economic development,  we  have  to  pay  more\r\n\r\nattention  to developing local enterprises.  It is time  that\r\n\r\nwe developed our own indigenous proprietary technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Cultivating innovative ideas</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the Government has done much in trying\r\n\r\nto   create   an   environment  conducive   for   innovation.\r\n\r\nIndividual  risk-taking is encouraged and  failures  are  not\r\n\r\nlooked  down  upon.   The  various  economic  agencies,   the\r\n\r\nuniversities   and  the  research  institutions   are   being\r\n\r\nrestructured to meet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  new  challenges.  Local enterprises have tapped  various\r\n\r\nGovernment  sponsored  schemes to  their  benefit.   Funding,\r\n\r\ngrants, tax incentives are in general not an issue for  those\r\n\r\nwho  have  a  good idea.  But for start-ups, what  is  really\r\n\r\nlacking   here  is  a  first  \"reference  site\"   where   the\r\n\r\nentrepreneur  can use to fine-tune his ideas  for  commercial\r\n\r\ndeployment.  In a larger, more competitive economy  like  the\r\n\r\nUS,  there  are  hundreds of competitors  out  there  in  any\r\n\r\nindustry, each of them willing to try something new, with the\r\n\r\nhope  that  it  is  a killer application  and  wipe  out  the\r\n\r\ncompetition.   It  is  not a problem knocking  on  doors  and\r\n\r\nfinding  someone willing to give a new idea, a new method,  a\r\n\r\ngo.  But in a small economy like ours, this must be nurtured.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budding talents need a good break in their home\r\n\r\nground to build a track record or reference sites before they\r\n\r\ncan  hope  to  debut and achieve success in  the  competitive\r\n\r\nglobal  stage.  We need to engineer some form of  demand-side\r\n\r\ninnovation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has been described as clean, efficient,\r\n\r\nsafe,  and  lately,  even  a  funky  place.   In  the  global\r\n\r\ncompetition  among city states, branding and positioning  are\r\n\r\ncrucial  to  attract  the right talents and  businesses.   In\r\n\r\naddition to the above mentioned descriptions of Singapore,  I\r\n\r\nthink we should put ourselves on the map as \"the laboratory\",\r\n\r\nthe place to experiment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh mentioned yesterday that we should set\r\n\r\nup  a  string of technology and research centres  around  the\r\n\r\nworld  where talent is found instead of having just  one  big\r\n\r\ncentre  in Singapore.  I would like to disagree with him.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  Singapore to be an even bigger laboratory  where\r\n\r\nR&D  spill out of the confines of R&D centres into the  field\r\n\r\nand  the  streets  -  Singapore as one big  integrated  field\r\n\r\nlaboratory for all ideas from all over the world, a  proofing\r\n\r\nground  for  innovation and ideas.   Let  it  be  known  that\r\n\r\nwhoever  in any part of the world who has a bright  idea  can\r\n\r\ncome to Singapore and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  have  the environment to let him or her try it out.  Tell\r\n\r\nall the talents out there in the world that this is the place\r\n\r\nto  be  in.  After all, it has been said that we are  a  good\r\n\r\nplace  to  attract pharmaceutical companies to try out  their\r\n\r\ndrugs  here  because  we are a cosmopolitan  city  with  many\r\n\r\nraces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true for other industries. We have it all\r\n\r\nhere in a small concentrated place.  So if someone has a  new\r\n\r\nidea about using natural gas, we should let him try out on  a\r\n\r\nfew  of  our buses.  If he has innovation on how to light  up\r\n\r\nour HDB common corridors more efficiently, let him deploy  it\r\n\r\nin  some  precincts.   Of  course, we  have  to  structure  a\r\n\r\nbusiness  relationship  where we have  an  equity  stake  and\r\n\r\nbenefit  from  the  resulting  technology  and  anchor   that\r\n\r\ntechnology  in Singapore for commercial deployment  in  other\r\n\r\nparts of the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years back, a water specialist from a French water\r\n\r\ntreatment company told me that we were very particular  about\r\n\r\ncertain  properties  of  our water  and  that  made  it  very\r\n\r\nexpensive  to  process  compared to our treatment  processes.\r\n\r\nBut  the  water  is very good.  Everyone knows Singapore  has\r\n\r\nvery high quality tap water.  I recall DPM Lee saying our tap\r\n\r\nwater tastes good and he misses drinking our water when he is\r\n\r\noverseas.  But we use the French technology and they use  us,\r\n\r\nour  good reputation, our good brand name, to pitch for water\r\n\r\nprojects  in  China.   To  convince the  Chinese  that  their\r\n\r\ntechnology  is superior, this French company told  them  that\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Government is using it and therefore it must be\r\n\r\ngood.  Sir, our good brand name goes a long way.  It is  like\r\n\r\nyou want to buy this PC.  You think this is a good PC?  It is\r\n\r\n'Intel  inside'.   You think Nestle has  good  SCM  and  ERP?\r\n\r\nNestle runs SAP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not leverage sufficiently on our top class brand\r\n\r\nname  and  we  become a showcase for foreign  technology.   I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is about time that our local enterprises went  out\r\n\r\nand  say  to  prospective customers  that,  \"Yes,  I  have  a\r\n\r\nreference  site in Singapore.  Come and evaluate  it.\"   That\r\n\r\nreference  site can be more crucial than the monetary  grants\r\n\r\nand tax incentives that are dished out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who love gardening know that to grow a rare bloom,\r\n\r\none needs to give special care and attention to the seedling.\r\n\r\nSometimes  you need to find a space to erect a  hothouse  and\r\n\r\nallow   the  seeds  to  germinate  and  grow.   Occasionally,\r\n\r\ngrafting   and  hybrid  help  to  reproduce  better   quality\r\n\r\nvariables.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating innovation is like cultivating the rare bloom.\r\n\r\nBigger   organisations,  whether  GLCs,   statutory   boards,\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies or bigger local boys, can play a  crucial\r\n\r\nrole   in  partnering  smaller  local  enterprise  to  enable\r\n\r\ninnovation to take root in Singapore.  This can be a  win-win\r\n\r\nproposition  for  all  as  they have  distinct  complementary\r\n\r\nadvantages but share the same global aspirations.  Instead of\r\n\r\nboth   trying  to  compete  with  each  other,  a   strategic\r\n\r\npartnership   can  be  forged  whereby  bigger  organisations\r\n\r\nprovide  the  environment for solution deployment  while  the\r\n\r\nentrepreneur exercises his innovative spirit and creativity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, success cannot be achieved based on economic\r\n\r\nfactors  alone.  We also need to strengthen the  non-economic\r\n\r\nfactors or \"soft\" infrastructures that support our growth and\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  Political and social stability top the list  in\r\n\r\nthe factors affecting foreign investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our multi-racial, multi-religious society, the\r\n\r\nunderlying  social  fabric is like a  beautiful  hand-knitted\r\n\r\nsweater.   Inevitably, there will be a few  frays  and  loose\r\n\r\nends.  If we keep tugging at the loose thread and continue to\r\n\r\npull  at  it with no regard to the consequences, we  run  the\r\n\r\nrisk of unravelling the needlework and destroying all that we\r\n\r\nhave built painstakingly over the years.  In our own way,  we\r\n\r\nhave   strived  for  unity  in  our  cultural  and  religious\r\n\r\ndiversity.  As Singaporeans, we know that regardless of race,\r\n\r\nlanguage  or  religion, we share the same destiny.   This  is\r\n\r\nparticularly so in a small country like ours.   In  a  bigger\r\n\r\ncountry, we can stay a lifetime in Chinatown and not interact\r\n\r\nwith  the other communities.  A prominent Chinese businessman\r\n\r\nwho  runs  a  business that is worth hundreds of millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars in a large neighbouring country told me recently that\r\n\r\nracial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelations in his country are good and will not pose a problem\r\n\r\nin  future.   He  sends his children to Chinese  schools  and\r\n\r\nlater  to  overseas universities.  He does  not  have  to  do\r\n\r\nbusiness  nor come into contact unnecessarily with the  other\r\n\r\nraces.  He has enough space to operate, mind his own business\r\n\r\nand  survive.   But in our small country, with a closely-knit\r\n\r\nsociety, we are one big community.  Community bonding, mutual\r\n\r\nunderstanding  and  respect are pre-requisite  to  peace  and\r\n\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans have placed their trust in the Government,\r\n\r\njust  like the patients pinning their hopes on their  doctor.\r\n\r\nIn  this case, there is no panacea for a quick cure.  We have\r\n\r\nto  work together to regain our strength and health, even  if\r\n\r\nit  means  swallowing  the bitter  pill,  even  if  it  means\r\n\r\nsuffering some short-term pain.  We have taken good  care  of\r\n\r\nourselves in the past.  Our body constituents are strong.  We\r\n\r\nwill find the best prescription to fight this bout of attack.\r\n\r\nWe will develop a greater resilience and emerge stronger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my great grandparents\r\n\r\ncame  from  India and China over 100 years ago to  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThey  were  immigrants.  The less charitable would say,  they\r\n\r\nwere opportunists who came in search for a better life and to\r\n\r\nmake a living for themselves and their family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two nights ago, my son, 11 years old, five generations\r\n\r\nlater,  asked  me, \"Daddy, if there is a war, why  should  we\r\n\r\nfight  for  Singapore?\"  It was a question which I could  not\r\n\r\nanswer fully because  I was rushing to drop him off somewhere\r\n\r\nand  going  off  for  my MPS.  But it  is  a  question  which\r\n\r\ntroubles me and haunts me even now as I speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you look at the television, newsreels and the\r\n\r\nnewspapers, you see Palestinians, suicide bombers, young  men\r\n\r\nand young women.  Rightly or wrongly, whether you believe  in\r\n\r\nthem or not, the point is that these people have a cause  and\r\n\r\nhave an ideal for which they are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndying  for.   And in Singapore we have our younger generation\r\n\r\nasking, \"What is it about this place, why should I fight  for\r\n\r\nit?   What  happens  if I die?\"  We just  came  back  from  a\r\n\r\nholiday  in Australia and my son said, \"Look, there  is  more\r\n\r\nspace  there, it is less crowded, we can get a  car,  we  can\r\n\r\ndrive around.  What is the point of sticking it out here?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then yesterday, I was having a chat with one of our\r\n\r\nMayors, who said that every time she is asked to be a  guest-of-honour at a National Service passing-out parade, it brings\r\n\r\ntears  to  her  eyes.  She is a serious person who  does  not\r\n\r\nexaggerate.   I  believed her and asked her why.   She  said,\r\n\r\n\"Well, because we might send these young men one day to their\r\n\r\ndeath.\"   I  am  a  doctor and we would like  to  think  that\r\n\r\ndoctors deal with life and death.  I look around here  and  I\r\n\r\nrealise  that in this Chamber, in your hearts and minds   you\r\n\r\ntoo discuss life and death issues.  You will or will not send\r\n\r\nour  people  towards a better life, and  a  better  life  may\r\n\r\nsometimes mean the ultimate sacrifice and these are difficult\r\n\r\nthings which we would have to face.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what are the real issues or real questions facing us\r\n\r\nas  a country, as a nation, at this stage?  I want to make  a\r\n\r\ncouple  of points.  My son will not understand them now,  but\r\n\r\nmaybe  he  will  read the Hansard years hence and  understand\r\n\r\nthat this speech is for him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, that Singapore is an artificial country.\r\n\r\nSecondly, that we are subject to external forces which we  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  absolute control over and these forces  will  play\r\n\r\nwithin our turf, within our country.  Thirdly, whilst we talk\r\n\r\nabout  filling the stomachs of our population,  we  must  not\r\n\r\nforget  to  fill  the hearts and minds of  our  people.   And\r\n\r\nfourthly,  as leaders down here, I remember Dr Wang's  speech\r\n\r\nyesterday,  in  a sense, we need to be able to  spell  out  a\r\n\r\nvision,  to give hope, to give guts and to build the  ability\r\n\r\nof our people.  Because if we do not do that, our country has\r\n\r\nfailed and we would have failed our duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the first point - an artificial country.\r\n\r\nGeographically, if you go back far enough in time, geological\r\n\r\nages,   Singapore  is  at  the  southern  tip  of  the  Malay\r\n\r\nPeninsula.   In fact, the Johore river and all  those  things\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  so  concerned about now for our  water  supply\r\n\r\nprobably ran through Singapore and probably its riverbed  was\r\n\r\nsomewhere  in  the  east  coast of Singapore.   There  is  no\r\n\r\ngeographical  reason  for the existence of  Singapore  except\r\n\r\nthat  the sea level went up and so now an island forms.   Now\r\n\r\nall  this  ruckus about reclamation is almost  ironic  humour\r\n\r\nthat geography and geology are playing on us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History, yes, the Malays had come here first and we\r\n\r\nregard them as the indigenous people of Singapore because the\r\n\r\nConstitution  says that.  And the rest of our ancestors  came\r\n\r\nhere.   Again, is there a historical reason for Singapore  to\r\n\r\nexist?   You go far back in time - the Sri Majapahit  empire,\r\n\r\nSri  Vijaya - you can always say, \"Well, this is part of  the\r\n\r\nRhio  Archipelago, part of Indonesia, part of Malaysia,  part\r\n\r\nof  Johore\".  You can go back endlessly.  There is no natural\r\n\r\nhistorical reason for the existence of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Size, we are very, very small. No doubt my Ministry is\r\n\r\ndoing its best to increase it but the fact is even after  our\r\n\r\nextreme  efforts, it will still be very very small.  We  are,\r\n\r\nin  a sense, trying to be Downtown Manhattan, without upstate\r\n\r\nNew  York, without the hinterland of the United States.   And\r\n\r\nyet,  we  have to be a country, we have to be a  nation.   We\r\n\r\nhave   our  own  airport,  seaport,  Armed  Forces,   Police,\r\n\r\nParliament.   Again,  there  is no  natural  reason  for  our\r\n\r\nexistence as a nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the composition of our people? A normal\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  a  nation is a group of  people  with  shared\r\n\r\ncharacteristics,  a  shared history,  a  shared  language,  a\r\n\r\nshared religion, who happen to congregate and multiply  in  a\r\n\r\ncertain  area.   Our  multi-racial  composition  between  the\r\n\r\nChinese,  Malays,  Indians  and  others  is  not  a   natural\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   It occurred because Stamford Raffles  happened\r\n\r\nto come along here.  He decided\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  he  liked the harbour.  Selective immigration  occurred\r\n\r\neven  150 years or more ago.  It is a freak of circumstances,\r\n\r\nnot   a  natural  occurrence.   We  are  different  from  our\r\n\r\nsurrounding  neighbours, in terms of our  ethnic  composition\r\n\r\nand  of  our outlook.  This is, after all, still a city-state\r\n\r\nwhere  the  Chinese  race is the dominant  race,  as  far  as\r\n\r\nnumbers  are concerned, and that makes us different from  our\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is no reason for Singapore to exist from a\r\n\r\nnatural  geographical,  historical, size  or  racial  reason;\r\n\r\nwhich  then brings us to thinking why are we here  today  and\r\n\r\nwhy  does  Singapore exist.  It exists because of a  man-made\r\n\r\nobsession with an ideal called multi-racialism.  We  did  not\r\n\r\nseek our independence for economic reasons or even to make  a\r\n\r\nliving.  We could make a living as a British colony, as  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  did  for a long time.  We could still make a living  as\r\n\r\npart  of Malaysia, as the Chinese in Malaysia continue to  do\r\n\r\nso.    But  we  were  thrown  out  of  Malaysia  and  we  got\r\n\r\nindependence because of this belief that we wanted  a  multi-racial place, a Singaporean Singapore, where all of us  would\r\n\r\nhave  our  chance to have our day in the sun.   That  was  an\r\n\r\nartificial   ideal  which  was  promulgated  by   our   first\r\n\r\ngeneration, which caught on amongst the population.   And  we\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"OK, fine, as an act of faith, we will do it,  and  we\r\n\r\nwill create a nation.\"  And whether you want to call it luck,\r\n\r\ncircumstance or whatever, the point is, we succeeded  and  we\r\n\r\ngot here today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, external forces. This is supposed to be a debate,\r\n\r\nbut  I  have been intrigued by the fact that there  has  been\r\n\r\nalmost  universal agreement among all the MPs, including  the\r\n\r\nOpposition,   on   the  external  forces  impinging   on   us\r\n\r\neconomically. They all talked about globalisation, about  new\r\n\r\ntechnologies, about free market.  There is actually no debate\r\n\r\nabout the recipe for economic growth.  The debate, if any, is\r\n\r\nabout  the implications of these three forces on our  society\r\n\r\nand how we are going to deal with it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you take an even broader perspective, what is\r\n\r\nhappening really is what the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTofflers  called the \"Third wave of change in  civilisation\".\r\n\r\nTen  thousand years ago, when mankind discovered agriculture,\r\n\r\nsociety  changed because they stayed put in one place.   Land\r\n\r\nwas  important.   They grew their crops.   Extended  families\r\n\r\nwere important because that was their labour source.  And  if\r\n\r\nthey grew enough crops and the weather was kind to them, they\r\n\r\nhad surpluses and they stored up.  That was the original CPF.\r\n\r\nThey prepared for a rainy day, and life went on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industrial revolution occurred about 300-400 years\r\n\r\nago.   In  this case, it is not the farm any more, which  was\r\n\r\nthe  main source of wealth, but the factory.  Families became\r\n\r\nnuclear  families  instead of extended  families.   Political\r\n\r\npower  changed  from  a feudal structure  that  characterises\r\n\r\nagricultural   society  to  the  two  competing   models    - representative democracy versus totalitarian socialism.  With\r\n\r\nthe  fall  of the Berlin Wall, we know which political  model\r\n\r\nwon as far as running an industrial age society is concerned.\r\n\r\nEconomically, it was about land; it was about labour; it  was\r\n\r\nabout  capital.  But what is happening now, when we  talk  of\r\n\r\nthe  information  age and knowledge-based  economy,  is  that\r\n\r\nanother  paradigm or sea change has occurred in the means  of\r\n\r\nproduction  of wealth.  It is now about ideas.  It  is  about\r\n\r\nsocial capital, and it is still about money, except it is now\r\n\r\nglobal and it is moving very, very quickly.  And what we  are\r\n\r\nstill trying to find out and we still do not have answers for\r\n\r\nis:   what  does  this mean to us politically,  socially  and\r\n\r\nculturally?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Parliament. This is a form of representative\r\n\r\ndemocracy.   We  are supposed to represent our  constituents.\r\n\r\nBut  you and I  know fully well that in this day and age,  it\r\n\r\nis  impossible for any one person to claim or to pretend that\r\n\r\nhe represents all views.  We come here as colleagues with our\r\n\r\nown  set  of beliefs, ideas, prejudices and biases.  We  hope\r\n\r\nthat  it  reflects what the larger society feels  and  thinks\r\n\r\nabout  it,  but it is not so simple.  When we cast the  vote,\r\n\r\ndoes that mean every single person out there agrees with  us?\r\n\r\nThis  whole  thing about having Parliament and representative\r\n\r\ndemocracy may not actually work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  future.   You  can, in a sense,  have  the  ultimate\r\n\r\nexpression of democracy because, after all, in a world  where\r\n\r\neverybody  is  always on and always connected, do  you  still\r\n\r\nneed  Parliament?  Well, that may be for a debate in a couple\r\n\r\nof  decades  or a hundred years from now.  But the  point  is\r\n\r\nthere is a change, and it is just that we do not have all the\r\n\r\nanswers to that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an optimistic side to the knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy.  Because in the knowledge-based economy, as  opposed\r\n\r\nto  an industrial economy, land, capital, machinery and cheap\r\n\r\nlabour become less important.  It is about ideas; it is about\r\n\r\nsystems; it is about organisation; it is about branding,  and\r\n\r\nthese   are  all  things  which  Singapore  has  an  inherent\r\n\r\nadvantage in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this knowledge-based economy will cause problems\r\n\r\nand  will cause dislocation, but we are actually ahead of the\r\n\r\ncurve.   And  the  fact that we worry about  it  and  we  are\r\n\r\nthinking about it now actually gives us hope that we will  be\r\n\r\namongst  the  first people, the first wave of nations  to  be\r\n\r\nable to take advantage of this revolution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is another side to this issue of\r\n\r\nglobalisation.  As the world becomes smaller and smaller, and\r\n\r\nmore  and more things become common, we sometimes forget that\r\n\r\nwhilst civilisations can change, 10,000 years is a very, very\r\n\r\nshort  time  in  evolutionary  terms.   Our  genes  have  not\r\n\r\nchanged,  certainly  not in the last  10,000  years  or  even\r\n\r\nlonger.   Therefore, human nature has not changed.  And  what\r\n\r\nwe  are  experiencing  now  is  the  clash  of  a  change  in\r\n\r\nenvironment impinging and impacting on basically an unchanged\r\n\r\nhuman  nature.   So,  in  this world  which  is  increasingly\r\n\r\ninterconnected  and global, we are suddenly  realising  that,\r\n\r\nhey,  how  I  feel and how I think actually disconnects  with\r\n\r\nwhat is happening around me and what I see around me.  And so\r\n\r\nwe  get  this  movement which we loosely call fundamentalism.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a human reaction against changes which we feel or  we\r\n\r\nfear we have no control over, and which we feel or we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfear dehumanises us.  Because, after all, the knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy  does not confer meaning, identity, purpose of  life,\r\n\r\nsolidarity,  love,  comfort.  It does not provide  all  these\r\n\r\nthings.   But  as  humans, we still need these  things.   And\r\n\r\nfundamentalism is basically a reaction against that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So before we start pinning labels on people and saying\r\n\r\nthese  are terrorists and these are not, sticking it even  to\r\n\r\nreligious  labels,  remember that underneath  all  this,  are\r\n\r\nmuch,  much  deeper  tectonic  shifts.   It  is  a  clash  of\r\n\r\nenvironment versus human nature.  And Singapore, as this tiny\r\n\r\ndot,  bobbing  around in the sea, surrounded by tsunamis,  is\r\n\r\nnot immune to these changes.  Our key challenge therefore has\r\n\r\nto  be how to manage some of the problems or consequences  of\r\n\r\nthese  changes,  key  amongst  which  are  the  economic  and\r\n\r\ncultural  disparities.   And  this  is  where  you  see   the\r\n\r\nopposition, and us disagree.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk about economics first. We agree that we\r\n\r\nhave to connect ourselves to the world.  We have improved our\r\n\r\ntechnology.  We have to have education, and we have  to  have\r\n\r\nfree trade.  We are all agreed on that.  We also accept,  all\r\n\r\nof  us  on  both  sides  of the House,  that  there  will  be\r\n\r\nincreasing disparities in the income spread.  There  are  two\r\n\r\nsolutions in front of you when you see an increase in  income\r\n\r\nspread.  Do not get on the bandwagon, in which case everybody\r\n\r\nstays  the  way we are now.  But it is not possible,  because\r\n\r\nstaying put means you sink to the bottom of the sea.   Or  we\r\n\r\nsay  that  we  will accept that there will be  an  increasing\r\n\r\nincome  disparity, but the issue is what do we do  for  those\r\n\r\nwho  are falling behind.  And the metaphor which I could  use\r\n\r\nis  that, yes, we have all talked about safety nets to  catch\r\n\r\npeople  who  fall.   But at what point does  the  safety  net\r\n\r\nbecomes a hammock, where you can fall and lie there and  say,\r\n\r\n\"This  is  good enough.  I don't need to get  up.\"   At  what\r\n\r\nstage  do you have to convert a safety net into a trampoline,\r\n\r\nso  that  you can say, \"Yes, I've fallen off, but there's  an\r\n\r\ninherent spring in this, and I can use it to bounce back up.\"\r\n\r\nAnd  the  way to bounce back up, although it may be something\r\n\r\nwhich our population does not want\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   hear,  is  about  training,  education,  retooling   and\r\n\r\nreskilling.  There is no other way to bounce back up from  an\r\n\r\neconomy which is changing, because your job has gone, because\r\n\r\nsomeone else is doing it more cheaply, or a robot is doing it\r\n\r\nmore  efficiently, or because nobody needs that job any more.\r\n\r\nSo  we have got to find ways to convert our safety nets  into\r\n\r\ntrampolines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we still need the trapeze, because you\r\n\r\nneed  some people to do those high flying, dare-devil stunts.\r\n\r\nAnd  do not say, \"Well, if you get to fly up on that trapeze,\r\n\r\nyou  will  be  a star and everyone else will be a  pedestrian\r\n\r\nwatching.\"  We have to allow people to go up on the  trapeze.\r\n\r\nLet  some of them succeed, bring glory to the whole act.  But\r\n\r\nat  the same time, we still have got our safety nets, because\r\n\r\nsome  of them will also fall.  And when they fall, hopefully,\r\n\r\nthey will bounce back up because we have converted our safety\r\n\r\nnets into trampolines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Culturally, it is not enough to say that we exist\r\n\r\nbecause we want to be an independent nation.  We draw on  our\r\n\r\nhistorical ethnic roots, whether it be from China,  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nIndia  or  the West.  But we cannot rely on them  because  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, this peculiar multi-racial mix and this  political\r\n\r\nformula  that  we  have is unique.  You cannot  rely  on  the\r\n\r\nmodels  which existed in the past or the models  which  exist\r\n\r\ncurrently  in Malaysia, India, China or the West  to  use  as\r\n\r\nlessons  for  how we need to do it.  Our ethnic  groups  must\r\n\r\nrealise  that  isolation  is not  an  option.   Reverting  to\r\n\r\nmedieval times is not an option.  Copying other countries  is\r\n\r\nnot  an option.  We have got to understand this principle  of\r\n\r\nco-determinism, that what happens to the Malays, the  Chinese\r\n\r\nor  the Indians in Singapore is not something which you  will\r\n\r\ndecide individually as a Malay, a Chinese or an Indian.  When\r\n\r\npeople  talked  about  collective leadership  for  the  Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity, what they did not understand is this concept of co-determinism.  The ultimate fate of the Malays in Singapore is\r\n\r\ngoing to be determined not by the Malays alone, but by all of\r\n\r\nus  and, similarly, for the Indians and for the Chinese.  And\r\n\r\nif we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstart  creating a system where we say this is my problem,  my\r\n\r\nbusiness  and  I  will  lead it, I will  be  pre-eminent  and\r\n\r\npredominant in making decisions on that exclusively, that  is\r\n\r\nthe  beginning of the end because we will unravel  the  whole\r\n\r\nthing.   So  we need to move beyond this.  The Government  is\r\n\r\nobsessively  secular,  and I think we must  continue  to  be,\r\n\r\nbecause that is the best guarantee for religious freedom  and\r\n\r\nreligious security in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk about the hearts and the minds. Samuel\r\n\r\nHuntington has said that in the future our loyalties will  be\r\n\r\ndetermined by what we believe rather than where we live,  and\r\n\r\nthis  applies, I think, very much to Singapore.  So, what  do\r\n\r\nwe believe in?  I share Mr Raymond Lim's views yesterday.  He\r\n\r\nsaid,  yes,  we have done Singapore 21; we have  done  Shared\r\n\r\nValues;  Agenda  for Action.  We are even  embarking  on  the\r\n\r\nRemaking  of  Singapore.   But,  really,  I  think  the  best\r\n\r\nstatement of our Shared Values is still encapsulated  in  the\r\n\r\npledge  written, again, by our first generation  leaders  one\r\n\r\nyear  after  independence.  It is the  concept  of  a  united\r\n\r\npeople,   regardless  of  race,  language  or   religion,   a\r\n\r\ndemocratic  society, justice and equality, and  all  this  in\r\n\r\npursuit  of  happiness first, then prosperity  and  progress.\r\n\r\nThese  values, I think, still stand.  It is the philosophical\r\n\r\nbasis  for the existence of our nation, and it is good enough\r\n\r\nto  fill our minds and to continue to fill the minds  of  our\r\n\r\nyoung  people.  For the hearts, my son said, \"Well, I suppose\r\n\r\nif  my  family is here, my friends are here, it may be  worth\r\n\r\nfighting for this place.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to get to Parliament from MND, or even to the\r\n\r\nIstana from MND, I have to drive past Stamford Road.  I  look\r\n\r\nat  the  National Library  -  I am not going to bring  it  up\r\n\r\nagain for discussion  -  but I look at it with a heavy heart.\r\n\r\nI  drive  past  my old school, ACS, I see the  missing  clock\r\n\r\ntower  with a heavy heart.  You look at hawker centres  which\r\n\r\nhave disappeared, it also brings something to you.  It is not\r\n\r\nthat  we  want  to  resurrect all those  things,  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible, but the fact that we have a heavy heart about it, I\r\n\r\nthink, is a good sign.  Whether you realise it or not,  there\r\n\r\nis emotional rootedness to this place called Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we have been very stiff about saying, wipe out\r\n\r\ndialects, wipe out Singlish, but the truth of the matter  is,\r\n\r\nthere  is emotion resonance in these.  And we have to realise\r\n\r\nthat,  yes, maybe it still makes sense to remove them but  be\r\n\r\naware of the cost, and be aware that emotional rootedness  is\r\n\r\nas  important as material rootedness, as important as  mental\r\n\r\nphilosophical rootedness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I want to end up by telling my son that, like the\r\n\r\nfirst  generation,  we need to reaffirm  our  faith  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry;  we  need  to say that, yes, this is  an  artificial\r\n\r\ncountry  but it is still my country.  Yes, my ancestors  came\r\n\r\nfrom elsewhere and they were not citizens, but I am different\r\n\r\nfrom  my ancestors because now I have a country and  I  am  a\r\n\r\ncitizen.   We need to tell our children that, yes, the  world\r\n\r\nis in revolution but Singapore will survive.  It will survive\r\n\r\nbecause  we  know who we are, what we stand for,  our  hearts\r\n\r\nache  and belong to something, to some place, to some  ideal.\r\n\r\nAnd what we are going to leave behind is worth an inheritance\r\n\r\nand  ultimately worth dying for.  In the final analysis, this\r\n\r\nis our Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion, not just going through the motion,\r\n\r\nbut I support the motion from the bottom of my heart.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, a point of\r\n\r\nclarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to the Minister of State with a heavy heart.\r\n\r\nHe started by quoting his son.  His son is not too young - 11\r\n\r\nyears  old,  am  I  right  - and he  is  a  fifth  generation\r\n\r\nSingaporean.  And the son asked:  Why should I fight for this\r\n\r\ncountry?  First, I think the Minister of State perhaps should\r\n\r\nask himself why is it that a young boy like him ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Wang, what is your point of\r\n\r\nclarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Would he not want to ask himself what\r\n\r\nis  wrong with our society that for a young boy like  him  to\r\n\r\nask that question?  Is there a failure in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  education system or is there a failure in our upbringing\r\n\r\nof  the  family?  And, secondly, his son is going to National\r\n\r\nService in seven years' time, so what are we proposing to  do\r\n\r\nto educate the young son that by the time he is 18 years old,\r\n\r\nhe is prepared to spill blood for Singapore, if necessary?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Would you like to reply to that, Dr\r\n\r\nBalakrishnan?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> I certainly do not want to\r\n\r\nblame the schools.  This is a real problem.  And, yes, it  is\r\n\r\nthe  family; it is society.  But I am being honest with  you.\r\n\r\nI  think  if  you ask your own children, to varying  degrees,\r\n\r\nthis is an issue.  It is something which, I am submitting  to\r\n\r\nthis  House, is worth us worrying about, thinking about,  and\r\n\r\ntrying to do something about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to sort out the answers among ourselves first.\r\n\r\nBecause  what do we tell our children if we have  not  sorted\r\n\r\nthis  out.   If we cannot, with a good conscience,  send  our\r\n\r\nchildren  out  to fight and to die, then we  really  have  to\r\n\r\nworry  about  whether we even have a right to sit  here.   So\r\n\r\nthese are the reasons why I am telling Members I have a heavy\r\n\r\nheart,  I  am worried, and has been hanging over my head,  my\r\n\r\nmind and my heart for the last few days.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What point are you raising?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> I try to find out from him whether he\r\n\r\nis  speaking for a minority of Singaporeans or he is speaking\r\n\r\nfor  all Singaporeans.

Allow me, Sir, to dwell on two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nissues,  namely, globalisation and social cohesion, and  even\r\n\r\nin  these  two  areas  I would be speaking  only  on  certain\r\n\r\naspects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards globalisation, I see that there are three\r\n\r\ntypes  of  Singaporeans.  The first are those who can  handle\r\n\r\nit; the second, those who get by; and the third are those who\r\n\r\nfind   difficulty.    The   first  group   who   can   handle\r\n\r\nglobalisation  are those who normally can take  advantage  of\r\n\r\nit.   They master the new ropes, they make necessary  changes\r\n\r\nand even profit out of it, sometimes quite handsomely too.  I\r\n\r\ncall them the \"global literates\".  The second group are those\r\n\r\nwho   adapt  and  manage  to  get  by.   They  undergo   some\r\n\r\nretraining,  some  short-term pains, but they  come  out  all\r\n\r\nright in the end.  But the third group finds it difficult  to\r\n\r\nadapt,  and  even to retrain.  They remain jobless  for  long\r\n\r\nperiods,  they accumulate debts and their financial  problems\r\n\r\nbring about social ones.  Even if they find alternative jobs,\r\n\r\nthese are the people who remain static in terms of income.  I\r\n\r\ncall them the \"survivors\", not the type who outlasts and gets\r\n\r\n$1  million at the end of 39 days, but this is the  type  who\r\n\r\nliterally barely survives only.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the global literates progress and profit, the\r\n\r\nsurvivors remain as they were.  Thus, there would be an ever-increasing  income gap between the global literates  and  the\r\n\r\nsurvivors.  If unchecked, the increasing gap may bring  about\r\n\r\nalienation, envy and social discord.  Sir, three months after\r\n\r\nbeing out of job, a person would feel depressed.  But if this\r\n\r\nsame person sees his ex-employer driving the same 3-litre car\r\n\r\ncoming  out of a country club every weekend, the same  person\r\n\r\nwho  remembers  that the ex-employer was the one  who  talked\r\n\r\nabout  bad  business, who talked about cost-cutting measures,\r\n\r\nwho  talked about the unnecessary evils of retrenchment, then\r\n\r\nthis  person would feel very frustrated and very angry.  That\r\n\r\ncan bring about social discord.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I read reports that arising from the economic\r\n\r\ncrisis  and  globalisation, companies resort to  cost-cutting\r\n\r\nmeasures.  They streamline, they merge.  But these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreports  also  say  that  more  often  than  not,  after  the\r\n\r\ndownsizing  process, most companies do not  earn  more,  they\r\n\r\njust spend less.  Further, at the individual level, those  in\r\n\r\nthe  top management earn more or less the same income,  while\r\n\r\nthose in the middle and lower rungs are either retrenched  or\r\n\r\nhave pay reduction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has put in place many useful measures to\r\n\r\nhelp this third group.  There are short-term schemes such  as\r\n\r\njob-matching and EDRS, mid-term solutions such as  retraining\r\n\r\nschemes, and even long-term ones such as educating the public\r\n\r\non  the  effects of globalisation and the need  for  lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning.  But I believe that more could be done by those  in\r\n\r\nthe first group.  I suggest the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That there be a set of best practices guidelines on\r\n\r\nretrenchment  which  does  not only  state  how  retrenchment\r\n\r\nshould   be  done  but  what  steps  should  be  done  before\r\n\r\nretrenchment is even contemplated, for instance,  wage  cuts,\r\n\r\nretraining schemes, job placement measures, and so on.  May I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that the Ministry, the employers and unions  make  a\r\n\r\nstudy  on  these to come out with a set of more comprehensive\r\n\r\nguidelines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) I also suggest that there may be a structure to\r\n\r\nenable  a  process whereby employers justify  their  proposed\r\n\r\nretrenchment  exercise to the Ministry or to the  union,  and\r\n\r\nthen  advice be given verbally or in writing, and this advice\r\n\r\nmay  be  given  also to the workers so that the  workers  are\r\n\r\naware of the advice given by the union or the Ministry.  This\r\n\r\nmakes  the process more transparent and further, since  there\r\n\r\nis no legal sanction against employers who refuse to heed the\r\n\r\nadvice  of the Ministry or the union, my suggestion  provides\r\n\r\nsome form of social pressure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am wary that we should not apply measures that\r\n\r\ndeter  present employers from continuing their businesses  or\r\n\r\npotential employers from starting ventures here.  Thus, I  am\r\n\r\nslow to suggest legislating the process.  But the idea really\r\n\r\nis  to  ensure  that  employers  really  have  exhausted  all\r\n\r\nmeasures,   including  looking  at  the   salaries   of   top\r\n\r\nmanagement, before\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeciding  that  people  should  lose  their  jobs.   In  this\r\n\r\nconnection, I also call on the first group to do more to help\r\n\r\nthe third group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every Singaporean matters, it is said. But this\r\n\r\ndoes not only mean that every Singaporean should be heard  or\r\n\r\nshould  be  cared for.  It also means that every  Singaporean\r\n\r\nshould  contribute where he can.  I urge the global literates\r\n\r\nto bend backwards a little bit more to help the survivors.  I\r\n\r\nrecall an advertisement which reads:  \"If you have it,  flout\r\n\r\nit.\"   Well, I say:  \"Flout if you want and if you must,  but\r\n\r\ndo  so  by  giving  and contributing.  Stop  showing!   Start\r\n\r\nsharing.\"   I  am aware, Sir, that many global literates  are\r\n\r\nalready  doing this, and I truly appreciate their effort.   I\r\n\r\nam only seeking to encourage others to do their part.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also aware that my calls are not in terms of hard\r\n\r\npolicies but, like the hon. Member before me, I seek to  make\r\n\r\ncalls  to  the hearts of Singaporeans.  I wish to  compliment\r\n\r\nthe  call  for policies, backed by sanctions and  enforcement\r\n\r\nmechanisms,   to  appeal  to  the  hearts  of   Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nespecially  the global literates.  Now and then, Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare called upon to do some soul-searching and perhaps this is\r\n\r\none  such call.  Soul-searching, Sir, may carry two meanings.\r\n\r\nOne  is  a search in the soul for something; two, is a search\r\n\r\nfor  a  soul.  I assume, and I hope rightly so, that  we  all\r\n\r\nagree  we  do not need to do the second one.  But I reiterate\r\n\r\nmy  call  that we search in our soul for the three more  `C's\r\n\r\nbeyond the five - care, concern, character.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move on to my next topic, which is the\r\n\r\nPresident's  discussion  on the movement  from  tolerance  to\r\n\r\nappreciation as regards inter-community relations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noteworthy that we speak of cohesion and not\r\n\r\namalgamation.   In  previous years,  some  suggest  that  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  racial, religious and cultural  groups  melt  into\r\n\r\none.  We have since moved away from that concept to one where\r\n\r\nwe  recognise that differences among the groups are likely to\r\n\r\nremain.  So\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  conjure the image of a mosaic where different  tiles  co-exist  to form a colourful whole.  We have chosen the  mosaic\r\n\r\nfloor over the melting pot.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a closer look at the mosaic floor. By\r\n\r\ndefinition,  the  mosaic floor consists of tiles  of  various\r\n\r\ncolours, even shapes or sizes.  But for it to be pleasant and\r\n\r\nuseful,  it has to be coordinated.  There must be someone  or\r\n\r\nsomething  that arranges these tiles so that, together,  they\r\n\r\nform  a beautiful pattern.  Without careful arrangement,  the\r\n\r\nsame  tiles can be a mess and not mosaic.  Or perhaps if  you\r\n\r\nhave  all yellow tiles on one side, blue tiles on one corner,\r\n\r\ngreen  tiles  in  the  opposite corner, brown  tiles  in  the\r\n\r\nmiddle,  we  may have a floor of tiles but it is not  exactly\r\n\r\nmosaic  either.   Thus,  the  arrangement  of  the  tiles  is\r\n\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: who arranges these tiles and how does\r\n\r\nhe  decide?   Do  the tiles arrange themselves  or  are  they\r\n\r\npatterned  by a transcendent force.  I recall that Dr  Vivian\r\n\r\nmentioned  about  co-determinism,  and  I  say  that  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  context, in view of the term \"co-determinism\",  it\r\n\r\nis  a  combination of both the interaction between the  tiles\r\n\r\nthemselves  and  this transcendent force.  Here,  the  mosaic\r\n\r\nimagery perhaps may find itself inadequate because mosaics do\r\n\r\nnot  move  by  themselves.  But instead of using the  sweater\r\n\r\nmetaphor  used  by  my  hon. colleague before  Dr  Vivian,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  it  was Mr Ong, may I suggest a garden instead.   It\r\n\r\nconsists  of  different  plants  which  had  hitherto   grown\r\n\r\nnaturally.   They  have hibiscus, aloe vera,  heliconia,  and\r\n\r\neven grass.  If properly maintained by a gardener, the garden\r\n\r\nis  an exhibition of life and colour.  If not, the aggressive\r\n\r\nplants  will  take over and after a few months,  you  have  a\r\n\r\nlallang  patch.  But yet, at the same time, if  the  gardener\r\n\r\ndoes  everything, the gardener does not do everything.   Each\r\n\r\nplant  or  each type of plant has its own way of  reproducing\r\n\r\nitself.   Each type of plant has its own system  of  ensuring\r\n\r\nits own uniqueness and its survival.  Yet, hybrids appear  in\r\n\r\nforms  not  imaginable before.  The bougainvillea  may  creep\r\n\r\ninto  loops  and  hang at the most curious places,  sometimes\r\n\r\neven among other plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of inter-community relations, we\r\n\r\nacknowledge that each community has traits which  are  unique\r\n\r\nto  itself  and each community has an interest to  guard  its\r\n\r\nidentity.   Yet, every community interacts with  the  others,\r\n\r\nwithout  one having to fear of being subsumed by  the  other.\r\n\r\nOn  top of it all, it is the common will to ensure peace  and\r\n\r\nsecurity  so  as to facilitate the continuous development  of\r\n\r\neach  community and to facilitate the meaningful  interaction\r\n\r\namong  communities.   The design and  plan  of  the  gardener\r\n\r\nrepresent this common will of the people.  Without the common\r\n\r\nwill,  there is no nation.  Without the gardener, we have  no\r\n\r\ngarden.   Belukar, maybe.  Sir, Singapore is indeed a  garden\r\n\r\ncity in more senses than one may think.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while it may be pleasing to indulge in this garden\r\n\r\nmetaphor,  in reality, inter-community relations  is  a  very\r\n\r\nintricate matter.  To allow each community to retain its  own\r\n\r\nunique  characteristics while at the same time moving towards\r\n\r\nnational  interaction is to unleash two forces that may  pull\r\n\r\nin  opposite directions.  I wish to humbly caution  that  the\r\n\r\nroad to appreciation is arduous.  There are three aspects  of\r\n\r\nthis road I wish to highlight.  The first is that it requires\r\n\r\neach  ethnic religious or cultural group to be more open with\r\n\r\none  another.   For  some, it requires a change  of  mindset.\r\n\r\nThere  are  many beliefs which the community holds jealously,\r\n\r\nkept  to  itself for years and for centuries, but  these  now\r\n\r\nhave  to  be exposed, lest such secrecy may arouse suspicion.\r\n\r\nFor  some, it requires a change of environment.  If you  have\r\n\r\nbeen  avoiding discussing sensitive issues in public in order\r\n\r\nto  maintain  peace and harmony, now we have to discuss  such\r\n\r\nissues  in public in order to pursue the greater appreciation\r\n\r\nof peace and harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, there was a short programme on the BBC\r\n\r\nregarding the causes of extremism and fundamentalism.  Almost\r\n\r\nall the fundamentalists agree that the growth of extremism is\r\n\r\ninversely proportionate to freedom of expression.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  the greater the clamp down on expression, the  higher\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchances  that  these  pent-up emotions  would  be  channelled\r\n\r\nthrough extremist outlets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect of this road to appreciation is that,\r\n\r\nby  opening  up,  if not handled carefully,  it  may  have  a\r\n\r\nnegative effect.  Expressions of differing and opposing views\r\n\r\non   cultural   or   religious  basis  can   heighten   these\r\n\r\ndifferences.   They  can  cause  more  tension   instead   of\r\n\r\ncohesion.   The  challenge, of course, is how to  pursue  the\r\n\r\nengagement  process in spite of many controversies  that  may\r\n\r\narise as we open the lid on sensitive issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third aspect is the need to maintain and develop a\r\n\r\ncomfort  base.  Even right now, we cannot discuss the  things\r\n\r\nthe  way  we do without first obtaining a certain  degree  of\r\n\r\ncomfort  and  confidence  among each  other.   This  we  have\r\n\r\nachieved  over  the years through various measures,  such  as\r\n\r\neffective national education, national service, intercultural\r\n\r\nactivities  and  bilingualism.  These are good  efforts  that\r\n\r\nwill  maintain  the present comfort level.  But  to  progress\r\n\r\ntowards appreciation, Sir, we need to do more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To allow effective engagement on sensitive issues, I\r\n\r\nbelieve that three points must be looked into.  Firstly, each\r\n\r\ncommunity must be very clear in themselves of their  position\r\n\r\non  several points.  The first point is that groups  must  be\r\n\r\nclear of their position as regards the development or changes\r\n\r\nin attitudes of the members of each flock towards their race,\r\n\r\nculture or religion.  The variety of such attitudes over time\r\n\r\nand space has to be understood.  No group is always static or\r\n\r\ntotally  homogenous  in its attitude towards  its  own  race,\r\n\r\nculture  or  religion.  This variety has to  be  appreciated,\r\n\r\notherwise  we  would  tend to draw general  conclusions  from\r\n\r\nspecific  instances  and  this does not  reflect  the  actual\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each group also needs to be clear on its position\r\n\r\nregarding    intolerance   and   extremism,   including    an\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of what causes extremism, what factors  affect\r\n\r\nextremism and how to counter extremism or intolerance.   Yet,\r\n\r\neach group\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  to  reconcile  between  its  understandable  desire   to\r\n\r\neventualise, to promote itself, yet at the same  time,  being\r\n\r\nmindful of contradicting positions taken by other groups with\r\n\r\nthe need to maintain the comfort base.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each group, Sir, also needs to clarify for itself how it\r\n\r\nviews  interaction among different groups  in  the  physical,\r\n\r\nrestricted   confines   of  Singapore   island,   reclamation\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding.  We wish to avoid a situation whereby inter-group  relations are progressing, but at the same time inter-group  relations  are having strains.  In this  regard,  each\r\n\r\ngroup  should identify the items within its own value  system\r\n\r\nthat  has  the  potential to cause conflict with  the  second\r\n\r\nnature  of the state and conflicts with other groups.   These\r\n\r\nitems that can cause conflict have to be honestly dealt  with\r\n\r\nin a manner that moves towards the long-term outcome of peace\r\n\r\nand harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, each group also has to have a clear\r\n\r\nposition as regards the role of race, religion and culture in\r\n\r\nthe  long-term future.  Inter-group appreciation is  a  long-term  desire.   And each group needs to search within  itself\r\n\r\nthe  values  and  principles  it makes  to  remain  relevant,\r\n\r\nmeaningful  and  contributive  to  the  well-being  of   this\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if each group is not totally sufficiently clear on\r\n\r\nthe  above points, then I humbly suggest that they embark  on\r\n\r\nserious  studies  on them.  While we all wish  to  accelerate\r\n\r\nthis  engagement process, it is worthless, if not  dangerous,\r\n\r\nif  the engagement process is supported by ill-prepared ideas\r\n\r\nand thoughts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, for effective engagement, each group must\r\n\r\nbe  willing  to  share its views and engage others  on  them.\r\n\r\nWhile  each group should search for common views among  other\r\n\r\ngroups,  yes,  each must be prepared to face  and  deal  with\r\n\r\ndiametrically opposing views as well.  Each group  must  give\r\n\r\nits  commitment  to  maintain the engagement  process.   This\r\n\r\ncommitment can be enhanced by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment   making  policies  that  seek  to   unify   while\r\n\r\nrecognising differences, which it is already doing  now,  but\r\n\r\nthis   can   be   strengthened  by  (1)   ensuring   adequate\r\n\r\nrepresentation  of such differing views in national  debates;\r\n\r\nand  (2)  incorporating greater flexibility as a feature  for\r\n\r\npolicies   so  as  to  cater  for  differences.    Also   the\r\n\r\ncommunities, when expressing their views, must do so sensibly\r\n\r\nand  sensitively  so as not to undermine the  comfort  level.\r\n\r\nBecause  if  the comfort level is undermined,  so  would  the\r\n\r\nwhole engagement process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point as regards effective engagement, Sir, is\r\n\r\nthat  confidence builds upon itself.  Confidence building  is\r\n\r\nan  accumulative  process.  As we move 10 paces  forward,  we\r\n\r\nwould  face issues that may cause us to take two steps  back.\r\n\r\nBut  this does not mean that we retrogress for we would  have\r\n\r\nby  then moved eight paces forward.  The journey will be full\r\n\r\nof  stops,  or such stops, and step-backs.  But we  all  must\r\n\r\nagree to maintain the general direction at a steady pace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the hon. Member Assoc. Prof. Koo that\r\n\r\nwe  should  not allow the rumour of gloom and doom to  fulfil\r\n\r\nits  own  prophecy.  We must have the confidence to  come  up\r\n\r\nbetter,  including this area of social cohesion.  As  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  confidence  builds  upon  itself.   If  there  is   no\r\n\r\nconfidence  amongst us now, we cannot have any confidence  in\r\n\r\nfuture for there is nothing to build on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this light, let me share an anecdote which came upon\r\n\r\nme  recently while I was in Morocco together with my two hon.\r\n\r\ncolleagues, Mr Zainul and Mr Chiam.  My wife chanced  upon  a\r\n\r\nman who asked her a question where she came from, noting that\r\n\r\nshe  wore a different dress, and she said, \"Singapore.\"   His\r\n\r\nresponse was enthusiastic.  My wife carefully avoided what he\r\n\r\nmeant  by  \"enthusiastic\".  When she said that she came  from\r\n\r\nSingapore,   the  man  was  so  pleased  and   rattled   into\r\n\r\nconversation.   It  turned out that he was  an  engineer,  an\r\n\r\nArgentinian  and  he liked to travel, he has  travelled  very\r\n\r\nwidely over six continents, and he has stayed for more than a\r\n\r\nweek in Singapore in the years of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis  travels.   At  one point, my wife  asked  him,  \"So,  is\r\n\r\nSingapore  nice?\"  His answer was, \"No.  Singapore not  nice.\r\n\r\nSingapore very, very nice.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I thank you for allowing me to  join  in  the\r\n\r\ndebate on the Motion of Thanks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asian financial crisis and the global economic\r\n\r\nrecession took its toll on the Singapore economy.   Our  four\r\n\r\nmajor  engines  of  growth,  the  US  economy,  the  combined\r\n\r\nMalaysia/Indonesia economy, the world semiconductor sales and\r\n\r\ndomestic   construction  work,  stalled.   As  the  Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy  took a nosedive, job losses continue to mount.   The\r\n\r\ngreatest  challenge  facing  the  man-in-the-street  now   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is jobs and the job situation can only improve  if\r\n\r\nwe can grow the economy and create more jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move ahead, we need to develop new engines of\r\n\r\ngrowth.   We recognise that China will be a major competitor,\r\n\r\nbut  we  also  recognise that China can be a  growth  engine.\r\n\r\nWhile  the world's economy took a battering, China's  economy\r\n\r\ncontinued  to  grow, although at a slower pace.  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmust  awaken to the serious competition that China will  pose\r\n\r\nto Singapore and the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last decade, I have had the opportunity to\r\n\r\nvisit China on several occasions.  Over the years, I have not\r\n\r\nceased to be amazed at the pace of development in China.   On\r\n\r\na recent trip, I met a Singapore company which makes external\r\n\r\ncladdings  for  buildings and windows.  They  have  relocated\r\n\r\ntheir  factories and the entire operations to  China.   Their\r\n\r\ncost  of  production  is  18% of the cost  of  production  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The Chinese engineers they hired were  not  less\r\n\r\ncompetent than the Singapore engineers.  They were willing to\r\n\r\nwork  harder  and put in longer hours.  They were  also  very\r\n\r\neager to learn and were good in research and development.  As\r\n\r\na  result, the company's products have improved at a fraction\r\n\r\nof the cost that they would have to invest in, if the R&D was\r\n\r\ndone in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Chinese companies will wipe out the competition at\r\n\r\nthe  lower  end.  However, if we are not careful,  they  will\r\n\r\nalso   become  competitors  at  the  higher  end   as   well.\r\n\r\nManufacturing  as  an  engine of growth,  especially  in  the\r\n\r\nsemiconductor industry and the electronics industry, will  be\r\n\r\nseriously  threatened.  Recently, we have   moved  into  life\r\n\r\nsciences and chemical industries, but we need to look  beyond\r\n\r\nmanufacturing to grow our services industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond its economic competitiveness, China also becomes\r\n\r\na  serious threat to Singapore in terms of quality  of  life.\r\n\r\nMajor  cities  like Beijing and Shanghai have developed  into\r\n\r\nmodern  cities  with  rich  cultural  experiences  and   wide\r\n\r\nrecreational  choices.  In Singapore, on  weekends,  when  we\r\n\r\nthink of recreation, we will visit our neighbourhood shopping\r\n\r\ncentres, perhaps take the children to the zoo, go to Sentosa,\r\n\r\nplay  golf or, maybe, go to the beaches.  In China, a weekend\r\n\r\nfor  a  family  in  Shanghai  may  mean  driving  to  Suzhou,\r\n\r\nHangzhou, or one of the nearby scenic areas.  It is therefore\r\n\r\nnot  surprising that expatriates increasingly  find  China  a\r\n\r\nfavoured choice for location of their companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Services will be new growth engines</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of severe competition to our manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustry,   services  can  be  new  engines  of  growth   for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, Singapore has been a logistics and\r\n\r\nfinancial  hub.  The telecommunications and IT services  have\r\n\r\nalso been key sectors but they have also been affected by the\r\n\r\ndownturn.  We have to look at other new growth areas  in  the\r\n\r\nservices sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should consider expanding into other services,\r\n\r\nincluding  education and healthcare.  In education, Singapore\r\n\r\nremains   one  of  the  choice  locations  for  many  Chinese\r\n\r\nnationals.   Many Chinese are eager to come to  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nlearn,  study  or  be trained.  We must not put  up  barriers\r\n\r\nunnecessarily.  We must make our visa process more efficient.\r\n\r\nCompanies have been asked to send their potential\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents to our embassy in Beijing to be interviewed.   Quite\r\n\r\noften,  the  officers in charge have many other  duties,  and\r\n\r\nthis  is not a priority for him.  Furthermore, many potential\r\n\r\nstudents  find it troublesome to fly all the way  to  Beijing\r\n\r\njust for an interview.  We must not put such roadblocks if we\r\n\r\nare  serious  about growing these services.   Having  Chinese\r\n\r\nnationals  to  study here will have economic  spin-offs  with\r\n\r\nmultiplier effects.  If we liberalise our student  visas,  we\r\n\r\nwill be able to grow the educational sector rapidly.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  we  must  be  careful  to  safeguard  our  good\r\n\r\nreputation.   The recent media reports on the cheating  cases\r\n\r\ninvolving  Chinese  students who have  rented  apartments  or\r\n\r\nChinese  nationals who have remitted money, have sullied  our\r\n\r\nreputation.  The frequent media coverage may give  the  wrong\r\n\r\nimpression  that these acts are common.  These acts  are  few\r\n\r\nand  far  in  between  and are done by  a  few  and  are  not\r\n\r\nrepresentative of Singapore.  We must send the right  signals\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  does  not tolerate such  acts  and  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to ensure that Singapore remains a conducive  place\r\n\r\nfor foreigners to live in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to grow our healthcare services, we have to\r\n\r\nmake  it  less  difficult  for those  who  wish  to  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore for their healthcare needs, to obtain their  visas.\r\n\r\nWe  should  also actively support the promotion of healthcare\r\n\r\nservices to countries in the region and jointly promote  this\r\n\r\nwith  the  tourism  board.  Support  by  the  Government  for\r\n\r\nprivate  sector healthcare has seen a large boost in  foreign\r\n\r\npatients  coming to Malaysia.  Malacca alone  attracts  about\r\n\r\n40,000 Indonesian patients a year to their hospitals.  Penang\r\n\r\nhas also become a major medical hub for Indonesians.  Further\r\n\r\nafield, the Bumrungrad Hospital in Bangkok has also become an\r\n\r\nattractive  alternative.   The difficult  visa  process  runs\r\n\r\ncontrary  to  our intention to grow our healthcare  services.\r\n\r\nFor  example, patients from Bangladesh complained that it  is\r\n\r\nmore difficult to get their visas to come to Singapore.  As a\r\n\r\nresult, they find it easier to go to other hospitals  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.  A patient of mine, recently having encountered  this\r\n\r\ndifficulty,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecided  to  fly  to a hospital in Bangkok  for  his  medical\r\n\r\nreview  and treatment and, subsequently, he faxed his results\r\n\r\nto me to ask me for my medical opinion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to ask ourselves how do we create jobs. The\r\n\r\nanswer is to grow the economy.  We have to ask ourselves  how\r\n\r\ndo  we grow the economy.  I think it is time we must also ask\r\n\r\nourselves  in  what  areas  can  the  Government  remove  the\r\n\r\nroadblocks to the growth of the economy.  By putting in place\r\n\r\na  system for a fast-track visa processing centre for  health\r\n\r\nand  educational  services, we will be  able  to  grow  these\r\n\r\nsectors rapidly.  These will translate into benefits for  the\r\n\r\nproperty  sector,  the  retail sector,  healthcare  services,\r\n\r\neducational  services, hotel services and  even  the  tourism\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Growing our external wing in the China market</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not limit the growth to Singapore but we must\r\n\r\nalso  look at growing the Singapore economy overseas as well.\r\n\r\nSingapore cannot ignore China's growth but we should use  our\r\n\r\nnatural  advantages to tap into China's growth.  Do  we  have\r\n\r\nany  advantages over others in getting access  to  the  China\r\n\r\nmarket?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Building Bonds</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese have a healthy respect for Singapore's\r\n\r\nreputation.    They   like   the  social   environment,   the\r\n\r\ncleanliness  and the safety in Singapore.  As a result,  many\r\n\r\nof  the Chinese parents feel secure in sending their children\r\n\r\nto  Singapore for studies.  Many of the students studying  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  on Government scholarships, grants or on  personal\r\n\r\nexpenses,  come from families where their parents  are  well-placed  or  are  important Government officials.   We  should\r\n\r\nactively  build  bonds  with Chinese students  who  study  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  friendship and bonds  will  strengthen  the\r\n\r\nbonds between Singapore and China.  We must not underestimate\r\n\r\nthe value of these bonds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another pool which we have not tapped on.\r\n\r\nThese are Chinese nationals who have either become\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npermanent residents or citizens.  Their intimate knowledge of\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese way of doing things and the good relations  they\r\n\r\nhave   with  their  friends  and  relatives  in  China,   can\r\n\r\npotentially smoothen our access into the Chinese  market  and\r\n\r\nshorten our learning curve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Improving the Government and the civil service</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To face these economic challenges, we not only need new\r\n\r\nengines  of  growth,  but we must ask ourselves  how  can  we\r\n\r\nimprove the internal operating milieu in Singapore.  We  must\r\n\r\nimprove  the  Government and the civil  service.   Government\r\n\r\nmust  accept  that it is not always right.  Ministries  which\r\n\r\nput  up  legislation  in Parliament or which  discuss  policy\r\n\r\nissues  with  MPs should not only explain policies  but  must\r\n\r\nalso   be  willing  to  acknowledge  differences  in  opinion\r\n\r\nwhenever  there is room for improvement.  I am glad that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  allow  more  debates  on  legislation   and\r\n\r\npolicies  that  will  give  more room  for  consideration  of\r\n\r\ndiffering  views so that improvements that are suggested  can\r\n\r\nbe   taken   into  consideration  and,  subsequently,   allow\r\n\r\namendments to be made to legislation or policies.   This  new\r\n\r\nera  of  openness will bode well for Singapore if  Ministries\r\n\r\ncan  see  that  they  do not have a monopoly  of  ideas.   It\r\n\r\nremains  now for the Government to show that there is resolve\r\n\r\nand  earnestness  to  remake the Government.   If  we  cannot\r\n\r\nremake  the  Government,  how  can  we  talk  about  remaking\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the civil service must learn to adopt a pro-people, pro-business mindset. There must be greater\r\n\r\ntransparency  and accountability in our civil  service.   Our\r\n\r\nGovernment departments continue to be a formidable barrier to\r\n\r\nboth the business community and the ordinary Singaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service gives the perception that it is wrong\r\n\r\nto  empathise with the ordinary Singaporeans, it is a sin for\r\n\r\nbusinesses  to  make money, and it is best not  to  give  the\r\n\r\npolitician the full picture.  The civil service must remember\r\n\r\nthat   it  is  not  wrong  to  empathise  with  the  ordinary\r\n\r\nSingaporean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A resident of mine came to see me regarding the sale of\r\n\r\nhis flat.  He had applied to HDB to remove a half wall of his\r\n\r\nservice  balcony  so that he could extend  his  kitchen.   He\r\n\r\nwanted to sell the flat and the HDB officer who inspected the\r\n\r\nflat said that the flat owner had only applied for permission\r\n\r\nto  remove  the half wall, but had not applied for permission\r\n\r\nto  remove the low kerb adjoining the wall.  As a result,  he\r\n\r\ninsisted  that  the owner put back the kerb before  he  could\r\n\r\nsell  the  flat.  I could not believe my ears  when  I  heard\r\n\r\nthis.   It is ridiculous to have a small kerb jutting out  of\r\n\r\nthe kitchen floor as it will be a perfect recipe for tripping\r\n\r\nover  and  breaking one's bones.  The engineering  department\r\n\r\ninsisted  that  the kerb had to be put back before  he  could\r\n\r\nsell  the  flat.  As I saw no sense in this matter, I  wanted\r\n\r\nthe  department to give a good explanation, failing  which  I\r\n\r\nwill  raise  this further up.  Following that, the department\r\n\r\nrelented  and  the flat owner was allowed to  sell  his  flat\r\n\r\nwithout further alterations.  This is just an example of  the\r\n\r\nproblems faced by residents.  The civil service cannot  be  a\r\n\r\nbureaucracy  that does not exercise its sensibility,  empathy\r\n\r\nand initiative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service must remember that it is not a sin for\r\n\r\nbusinesses  to  make money.  Let us not kill the  goose  that\r\n\r\nlays  the golden egg.  If the businesses fail, jobs  will  be\r\n\r\nlost  and  it  will  be  worse off for everyone.   The  civil\r\n\r\nservice  uses  a  technique called  \"stalling  for  time\"  to\r\n\r\nsqueeze the genuine businessmen to capitulate to its demands.\r\n\r\nI will illustrate this with two examples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A businessman had applied to participate in a Government\r\n\r\nland  tender  put  up  by the Singapore Land  Authority.   He\r\n\r\ncomplied  with the conditions and eventually won the  tender.\r\n\r\nTo  his  horror, when he applied to the URA, he  met  with  a\r\n\r\nstonewall as URA had claimed that the usage of land,  as  put\r\n\r\nout  in the tender document, required their consent as  well.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result of this, his application to start work  on  the\r\n\r\nland was stalled.  After paying several hundreds of thousands\r\n\r\nof  dollars to the Government and having been delayed  for  a\r\n\r\nyear, he was brought to his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknees  and  was  at  his  wits' end.  He  finally  sought  my\r\n\r\nassistance to appeal to the Government.  After writing to the\r\n\r\nMinisters  concerned, I am glad that his appeal was  allowed.\r\n\r\nHowever, through no fault of his, he had lost time and money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case. An entrepreneur-developer, who is also a\r\n\r\ncommunity  leader,  encountered a similar  problem.   He  had\r\n\r\napplied  to  the URA for information on a development  charge\r\n\r\n(DC)  on  a piece of land before deciding on the purchase  of\r\n\r\nthat  piece  of land.  Acting on the information  on  the  DC\r\n\r\ngiven  by URA, he went ahead to purchase the land.   When  he\r\n\r\nwanted  to  develop the land, the URA officer in  charge  had\r\n\r\nleft, and a new officer had taken his place.  The new officer\r\n\r\nclaimed  that  the  previous officer had given  him  a  wrong\r\n\r\ncomputation and, hence, URA decided to unilaterally  increase\r\n\r\nhis development charge.  It has been several months since  an\r\n\r\nappeal was sent to the Ministry of National Development  but,\r\n\r\nto  date, no official reply has been received.  This stalling\r\n\r\nhas  made  it impossible for him to proceed with his  planned\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  As a result, he had no choice but  to  pay  URA\r\n\r\naccording  to  what  URA wanted so that his  licence  can  be\r\n\r\napproved,  otherwise his interest cost and land-holding  cost\r\n\r\nwill  become a major burden to him.  He has yet to receive  a\r\n\r\nreply  from the Ministry of National Development.   I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhen  they  will  give him a reply.  It has been  six  months\r\n\r\nsince.    Where   is   the   transparency,   where   is   the\r\n\r\naccountability, where is the pro-business Government?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It saddens me that our bureaucracy can hold our\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  to ransom.  Our civil service  needs  a  major\r\n\r\nchange  in  mindset.   Time is cost in  the  business  world.\r\n\r\nIncreasing  Government transparency and accountability  is  a\r\n\r\nkey area where the Government can make a real improvement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the civil service must remember not to hide the\r\n\r\ntruth from the politicians.  We are here to work together  to\r\n\r\nmake Singapore a better place for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot  only do ordinary Singaporeans and businessmen face  this\r\n\r\nstonewalling  by the civil service.  Even MPs sometimes  face\r\n\r\nthe  same  problem.   During  our Sengkang  Town  Development\r\n\r\nCommittee  meeting,  a representative from  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth was asked by the MPs on the likelihood of a polyclinic\r\n\r\nin  Sengkang town.  The representative replied that  a  study\r\n\r\nwas being conducted and the report had already been submitted\r\n\r\nto  the Minister, but there was no confirmed plan to build  a\r\n\r\npolyclinic  then.  The representative was then reminded  that\r\n\r\nthe  minutes  would  be made available  to  the  Minister  in\r\n\r\ncharge.   Upon  hearing that, the representative  immediately\r\n\r\nretracted  the  statement and said that the  report  had  not\r\n\r\nreached the Minister.  Despite the stonewalling by the  civil\r\n\r\nservice,  I am glad that, finally, after all the lobbying  by\r\n\r\nthe  MPs  in  the GRC, the Minister for Health supported  the\r\n\r\njustification to have a polyclinic built in Sengkang and also\r\n\r\nat an earlier date.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time for the civil service to show more\r\n\r\ntransparency and accountability.  It is time for them to  see\r\n\r\nthemselves as part of Singapore Inc to improve the quality of\r\n\r\nlife  for  our  residents, not to obstruct our entrepreneurs,\r\n\r\nand to work with MPs to improve Singapore's future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the economic challenges we face are daunting. We\r\n\r\nhave  the  resources and the means to meet these  challenges.\r\n\r\nLet us not set up roadblocks and obstacles for ourselves.   I\r\n\r\nam  confident that if we have a Government which will  listen\r\n\r\nand  be  more  open,  we will be able to  sail  through  this\r\n\r\neconomic turbulence and steer ourselves to a brighter future.\r\n\r\nTo  overcome these serious daunting challenges, we  need  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to pull together.  Together, we will succeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you\r\n\r\nfor allowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, September 11th was a turning point in the history\r\n\r\nof  mankind.  It was indeed a defining moment in  our  lives.\r\n\r\nThrough CNN coverage, we watched in horror as the World Trade\r\n\r\nCentre Twin Towers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncollapsed  right in front of our eyes.  Thousands lost  their\r\n\r\nlives  in an instant. We were stunned.  We were numbed.   Was\r\n\r\nthis  the  beginning of the end of the civilised world?   Our\r\n\r\nlives  have  been  changed.  Terrorism can  strike  anywhere,\r\n\r\nanytime.  It also strikes at the innocent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorism has globalised. So must be the fight against\r\n\r\nterrorism.   Counter-terrorism has to be global.  The  United\r\n\r\nStates  has  taken the lead in this fight against  terrorism.\r\n\r\nSingapore,  too, must support the anti-terrorist measures  in\r\n\r\nour own national interests.  However, some may ask why should\r\n\r\nSingapore be so closely identified with the United States and\r\n\r\nseen to be supporting the forces aligned against terrorism.\r\n\r\nThe  answer is simple.  It is the right thing to do.  We must\r\n\r\ntake  a  stand against wanton destruction of innocent  lives.\r\n\r\nWe  must ensure safety in travel.  It affects each and  every\r\n\r\none  of  us.  If we do not stand up and be counted, who  will\r\n\r\ncome  to  our  help,  if terrorism rears  its  ugly  head  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?   Others would then ask, \"Where were you  when  we\r\n\r\nneeded you most? Now you are asking for our help?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this inter-connected world of security, trade\r\n\r\nand  investment,  we cannot fudge the issue  or  sit  on  the\r\n\r\nfence.  It  will be foolhardy to presume that the horrors  of\r\n\r\nterrorism  will  not  strike  Singapore.   Indeed,   as   the\r\n\r\ndiscovery and exposure of the JI plotters amply demonstrated,\r\n\r\nwe  have to be ever more vigilant against terrorist cells and\r\n\r\nthe protractors of violence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has been lucky so far. Terrorists could\r\n\r\nwell  have detonated the bombs in Singapore.  Buildings might\r\n\r\nhave  collapsed.  Trade would be affected.   There  would  be\r\n\r\nstupendous  loss  of  lives.   This  would  have  scared  off\r\n\r\ninvestors  and  tourists.  MNCs might relocate  their  plants\r\n\r\nelsewhere.   Jobs  would be lost.  The  economy,  already  in\r\n\r\nrecession,  would  plummet.  Worse  still,  it  would  put  a\r\n\r\ntremendous  strain  on our multi-racial  and  multi-religious\r\n\r\nharmony.  Despair, anger and distrust would reign.  It  would\r\n\r\nbe the severest test to our nationhood.  That\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  did not happen does not mean that it would not  happen.\r\n\r\nWe have to be vigilant.  We have to be prepared.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must therefore work even harder to promote multi-racial harmony and bonding. I applaud the Government's\r\n\r\nefforts  to  form Inter-Racial Confidence Circles  throughout\r\n\r\nthe  island.  Whether in our schools, our workplace or  home,\r\n\r\nmulti-racial harmony must be our motto and way  of  life.   I\r\n\r\ntherefore urge Singaporeans to invite their neighbours of all\r\n\r\nraces  to  visit  their  homes and  to  join  them  in  their\r\n\r\ncelebrations and festivals, be it Hari Raya, Chinese New Year\r\n\r\nor Deepavali.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the terrorist threat and the continuing\r\n\r\ninstability  in  Southeast  Asia  underline  once  again  the\r\n\r\nimportance of security and defence, and the vital role of the\r\n\r\nPolice and the SAF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this connection, we are all well aware that the\r\n\r\npillars of our defence are our national servicemen.  We  know\r\n\r\nthat national service is a service to the nation and involves\r\n\r\nan   element  of  sacrifice  and  indeed  sometimes,  supreme\r\n\r\nsacrifice.  I would like to refer to the point raised  by  Dr\r\n\r\nVivian  Balakrishnan  and  Dr Wang  Kai  Yuen.   I  had  done\r\n\r\nnational  service myself.  I have two sons and both  of  them\r\n\r\nare Operationally Ready National Service officers.  There  is\r\n\r\nno   doubt  that  they  will  fight  for  Singapore  and,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary,  die  for  the country.  Indeed,  my  second  son,\r\n\r\nJames,  is studying overseas and one day he told me  that  at\r\n\r\nthe first sign of trouble, he would fly back to Singapore  to\r\n\r\nbear arms.  I am very proud of him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of this supreme sacrifice, we must give due\r\n\r\nrecognition  to  our national servicemen.   But  the  limited\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen allowances have been kept frozen  for  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  years.   They have not kept  pace  with  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth, cost of living or inflation.  Some parents of NS  men\r\n\r\nfork  out money to help their sons with their expenses during\r\n\r\nNS.   They do not mind but this is the hardest on parents  of\r\n\r\nlower  income groups.  I believe that it is high time  Mindef\r\n\r\nreviewed their NS allowances and give our NSmen their dues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, relations between Singapore and Malaysia\r\n\r\nhave hit another rough patch.  We are now quite accustomed to\r\n\r\nthis  roller-coaster-like relationship between Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.   But what bothers me is that across the  Causeway,\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  always  seen to be at fault  and  Malaysia  is\r\n\r\nseemingly  blameless.  This attitude is not helpful,  to  say\r\n\r\nthe  least.   This  rather unsatisfactory  scenario  is  best\r\n\r\nsummed  up,  in my opinion, by a reader, Mr Yu Kok  Wah,  who\r\n\r\nwrote  in  the Forum page of the Straits Times on  9th  March\r\n\r\nthis year.  According to Mr Yu, the picture that emerged over\r\n\r\nthe  years was what he labelled as Rule No. 1, that  is  \"The\r\n\r\nSingapore Government must always be sensitive to the needs of\r\n\r\nthe Malaysian government and its politicians\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Rule No. 2 is \"Before Singapore does anything, it\r\n\r\nhas to adhere to Rule No. 1\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule No. 3 is \"Whatever Singapore has done, it is fair\r\n\r\ngame  for  Malaysian  politicians to  criticise  because,  as\r\n\r\nalways,  the Singapore Government has failed to observe  Rule\r\n\r\nNo. 1\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule No. 4 is \"If the Singapore Government sticks to the\r\n\r\nletter  of any agreement signed with Malaysia, it is  branded\r\n\r\nas  too legalistic and is accused of not upholding the spirit\r\n\r\nof Rule No. 1\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule No. 5 is \"Any comments on our policies by Malaysian\r\n\r\npoliticians  are  to  be treated as good  neighbourly  advice\r\n\r\nbecause of Rule No. 1\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule No. 6 is \"Any comments on our neighbour will be\r\n\r\ndeemed offensive, intrusive and abusive because the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  will be seen to have failed to observe  Rule  No.\r\n\r\n1\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this sounds familiar to us. It seems that only\r\n\r\nMalaysians have sensitivities.  Mr Yu has hit the nail on its\r\n\r\nhead.   My  GPC colleague, Mr Ravindran spoke with conviction\r\n\r\non  Singapore-Malaysia relations in this  very  Chamber  last\r\n\r\nTuesday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe must be right on target, but now he has the distinction of\r\n\r\ndrawing  fire  from  Malaysian  Ministers  and  MPs  in   the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Parliament.  Mr Ravindran, as Mr Yu predicted,  was\r\n\r\naccused of being insensitive.  More abusive words were  used,\r\n\r\nbut I would not care to repeat them because the Speaker might\r\n\r\nrule  it  unparliamentary.  Mr Ravindran's only  mistake  was\r\n\r\nthat he failed to observe Rule No. 1.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last weekend, to be sure and to satisfy myself, my\r\n\r\nfamily  and  I  took a boat ride to the waters  off  Punggol,\r\n\r\nPulau  Ubin and Pulau Tekong.  It was in good weather and  my\r\n\r\nguide  was  a  kelong  owner.   I  can  say  that  our   land\r\n\r\nreclamation is well within our own territorial waters.  And I\r\n\r\nassure you that I was not fishing in troubled waters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore will be mindful of the concerns of\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  our  nearest neighbour.   It  is  only  fair  that\r\n\r\nMalaysia  also  respects our sovereign  rights  and  national\r\n\r\ninterest.  It will be better for Malaysia to send Singapore a\r\n\r\nfull  and  comprehensive diplomatic note  on  all  issues  of\r\n\r\nconcern  and we can respond accordingly, rather than  talking\r\n\r\nor  boxing through the press.  Please hurry, send us a  note.\r\n\r\nWe  want  a diplomatic exchange, not a media exchange  or  an\r\n\r\nexchange through Parliamentary speeches.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding this, I urge Singapore and Malaysia\r\n\r\ntogether  to put the past behind us, put away the  historical\r\n\r\nbaggage  of merger and separation, and work closely  together\r\n\r\nfor the good of the people on both sides of the Causeway.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot choose our neighbours. Geography and\r\n\r\nhistory have devised and placed us side by side.  If  we  can\r\n\r\nchoose,  it  would  be easier.  But we  can  choose  to  work\r\n\r\ntowards  a win-win situation, to the mutual benefit  of  both\r\n\r\ncountries.   This  is  all  the  more  important  and  indeed\r\n\r\nimperative in this inter-dependent world.  All the  more,  as\r\n\r\nASEAN  faces  new  challenges, stress and  strains  from  the\r\n\r\nregional  downturn and the new economic challenges  from  the\r\n\r\nfast growing East Asian region led by China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can see the big picture, we can understand the\r\n\r\nstrategic consideration and the global dimensions before  us.\r\n\r\nBut  we must relate and explain this to our heartlanders,  to\r\n\r\nour  residents, to the man-in-the-street.  We must carry  the\r\n\r\nground with us.  Otherwise, in a crisis, we may fall apart or\r\n\r\npull apart by external forces and internal divisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, we must not talk down or talk over the heads of\r\n\r\nthe  people.   We  must make the effort to explain  in  clear\r\n\r\nterms  to  our  residents,  for example,  through  dialogues,\r\n\r\npresentations and skits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the people do not understand the bigger scenario\r\n\r\nor  support and trust the Government, the best-laid  plan  we\r\n\r\nhave will come to waste.  In this debate, it amply shows that\r\n\r\nwe  have to not only convince the people, we have to convince\r\n\r\nour own MPs in this House.  We have to make a start.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, it has been quite\r\n\r\ndifficult catching your eye.

I  want  to  assure  Mr\r\n\r\nAhmad  Khalis  and  all the Members of the  House  that  when\r\n\r\nworkers are retrenched, we in the trade unions do take  great\r\n\r\npains  to ensure that the retrenchments are not for frivolous\r\n\r\nreasons.  And if we are not comfortable with the reasons  for\r\n\r\ntheir  retrenchment, which we think are not valid,  we  would\r\n\r\nchallenge it in the Ministry of Manpower or in the Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport of the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President commenced his Speech by observing\r\n\r\nthat  the  last  five  years have been  momentous  times  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.   A  new  lexicon that  has  found  its  way  into\r\n\r\nmainstream  use  in  Singapore  perhaps  best  captures  that\r\n\r\nsentiment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five years ago, the words \"Singapore\" and \"recession\"\r\n\r\nwould  have  constituted  an unlikely  couplet.   After  all,\r\n\r\nSingapore was one of the Asian tigers, a dynamo humming along\r\n\r\nat  8-10%  annual  growth rates, sometimes higher.   The  odd\r\n\r\ndifficult year was almost viewed as a necessary respite  from\r\n\r\nthe  frenzied  pace of our growth, rather than as  a  serious\r\n\r\nsetback.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five years ago, the words \"HDB\" and \"terrorism\" would\r\n\r\nprobably never have been used in the same sentence.  We  took\r\n\r\npride  in  the fact that it was safe to walk our streets  and\r\n\r\nuse our subways, even in the middle of the night.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five years ago, a new batch of MPs in Parliament - and\r\n\r\nI  was  one  of  them  - spoke, not on unemployment  and  job\r\n\r\nmatching, but on job-hopping and employee loyalty.  The focus\r\n\r\nwas  very  much on managing the consequences  of  success   - high cost of COEs, high property prices and high wage costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we now know that a terrorist cell, based within our\r\n\r\nHDB  heartland,  had been plotting unthinkable  crimes.   The\r\n\r\ndreaded   \"R\"   words    -   Recession,   Restructuring   and\r\n\r\nRetrenchment  -  are heard with nauseating regularity in  our\r\n\r\nmedia.   And  we  now counsel our fresh graduates,  who  were\r\n\r\npreviously  spoilt  for choice, not to  be  too  choosy  when\r\n\r\nlooking for a new job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dramatic changes in the external environment have thrust\r\n\r\nSingaporeans into uncharted territory.  And for a younger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngeneration of Singaporeans, born and brought up in the  post-independence  era Singapore, recent events have  taken  on  a\r\n\r\nsurreal  quality,  for  this  is  so  far  removed  from  the\r\n\r\nSingapore we have experienced and what we have come to expect\r\n\r\nin our country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the question, Sir, is whether this situation is so\r\n\r\nfundamentally  different  to  our  past?   Sure,  today,  the\r\n\r\nsymptoms are acute and we feel them sharply.  But the  threat\r\n\r\nof such adversity has always been lurking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty years ago, if we had wagered on Singapore\r\n\r\naccomplishing all that it has, I suspect we would  have  been\r\n\r\ngiven rather long odds by the bookies.  Then the question was\r\n\r\nwhether  we  would  survive  the throes  of  separation,  the\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  of  British troops and early stages  of  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years ago, in the depths of the Asian economic\r\n\r\ncrisis  and political upheaval in the region, if we had  once\r\n\r\nagain  wagered on Singapore's continued success, I  think  we\r\n\r\nwould  still have been given rather long odds.  The  question\r\n\r\nwas,  once again, whether we would survive an economic  melt-down, political upheaval and security concerns in our region,\r\n\r\nin our economic hinterland.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, here we are today, relatively intact, but facing\r\n\r\nwhat   our  President  has  described  as  \"the  most  severe\r\n\r\nchallenges  in the history of our nation.\"  Again,  it  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion of survival.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the truth is, the odds have always been stacked\r\n\r\nagainst  us.  External events have compelled us to constantly\r\n\r\nrise  to  new  challenges.  But we have  pulled  through,  as\r\n\r\nindividuals  and as a people, through sheer grit and  passion\r\n\r\nfor  this  place.  Do we have the courage and  confidence  to\r\n\r\nbelieve that we will once again survive and succeed?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in thinking about this question and answer, I was\r\n\r\nreminded of my uncle, curiously enough.  He was born during\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorld  War  II and the 50s and 60s had a profound  effect  on\r\n\r\nhim.  For him, the cry \"Merdeka\", with clenched fist held  up\r\n\r\nhigh,  is  still  resonant and it evokes vivid  and  somewhat\r\n\r\nemotional memories.  And make no mistake, my uncle was not  a\r\n\r\npolitical  activist; he was not a freedom fighter;  he  is  a\r\n\r\nretired  civil servant.  And we all know, civil servants  are\r\n\r\nnot generally given to emotional displays.  But he was a firm\r\n\r\nbeliever  in Singapore and what it stands for.   And  for  my\r\n\r\nuncle and many of his generation, that cry from the steps  of\r\n\r\nCity  Hall was a rallying call.  It was a symbol of hope  and\r\n\r\nit  was  a  call to stand up and be counted in  the  nation's\r\n\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, another generation of Singaporeans must rise\r\n\r\nto  this call.  We need the right policies, but we also  need\r\n\r\nour  people  to rally behind the policies and the Government.\r\n\r\nWe  can  call it Remaking Singapore, Rediscovering Singapore,\r\n\r\nbut, in essence, we must once again find the words, the icons\r\n\r\nand  the  spirit to inspire a new generation of Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nto  imbue  them with hope and to ignite our people's passion.\r\n\r\nSo  that  a move by another liner to a neighbouring  port  is\r\n\r\nseen,  not as a body blow to our prospects, but rather  as  a\r\n\r\nspur  to  revitalize our efforts.  So that rising competition\r\n\r\nin the region does not flag our spirits, but rather puts fire\r\n\r\nin  our bellies to try even harder.  So that a bland cerebral\r\n\r\ncost-benefit  analysis will give way to an emphatic  visceral\r\n\r\nattachment to this place.  Only then can we pull ourselves up\r\n\r\nby  the bootstraps, help each other the best we can, do  what\r\n\r\nneeds  to be done, and take this adversity in our stride,  as\r\n\r\nwe move forward.  If we cannot or we do not, then we would be\r\n\r\nunworthy of the legacy of our forefathers.  Sir, that is  the\r\n\r\nchallenge  for  all  of us, the Government,  this  House  and\r\n\r\nindeed all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present circumstances have also had a salutary\r\n\r\neffect.   They  have  served as a timely  reminder  that  our\r\n\r\neconomy   and  security  are  works-in-progress.   They   are\r\n\r\nvulnerable   to   shocks  and  require  constant   attention,\r\n\r\nreinforcement and enhancement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that perspective, our social cohesion is yet\r\n\r\nanother work-in-progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have come a long way in our effort to build a multi-racial\r\n\r\nSingapore.   And  today, we have heard many Members  describe\r\n\r\nthe  state  of  multi-racial  relations  in  Singapore  using\r\n\r\nvarious metaphors  -  mosaic, garden, a knitted sweater, etc.\r\n\r\nI  am  afraid  I  do not have a metaphor to offer.   But  the\r\n\r\nquestion I wish to ask is whether it is appropriate  at  this\r\n\r\ntime  of challenge for us to also revisit our model of multi-racial  relations and ask if we are satisfied,  content  with\r\n\r\nwhere we are today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have by now grown accustomed to multi-cultural\r\n\r\nperformances at grassroots and other community functions.  We\r\n\r\nenjoy  each other's food and appreciate our diverse  cultural\r\n\r\nheritage  and festivals.  We also have an awareness  of  each\r\n\r\nother's  religions  and practices.  And these  are  important\r\n\r\nfoundations and we must treasure them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent Straits Times' article on a survey of some 300\r\n\r\nstudents also concluded that inter-racial mixing is  fine  in\r\n\r\nour  schools.   The  survey  asked questions  like:  what  is\r\n\r\nanother  name  for  the  Seventh  Moon  Festival,  the  Hindu\r\n\r\nfestival  of  lights and also which is the holy city  of  the\r\n\r\nMuslims.   The survey found that 95% of students had  friends\r\n\r\nof  other races, and 70% had six or more.  I would have liked\r\n\r\nto have found out what percentage of those students had close\r\n\r\nor even best friends who were from other races, and how often\r\n\r\nthey  socialised with them outside school.  While it is  good\r\n\r\nfor  a Chinese or Malay student to know that Deepavali is the\r\n\r\nFestival of Lights celebrated by the Hindus, would it not  be\r\n\r\nfar  better for him to have a good Hindu friend who  can  not\r\n\r\nonly  furnish  him with the answer but, better still,  invite\r\n\r\nhim  to celebrate the festival with his family?  Would it not\r\n\r\nbe  better even as we share each other's food over  a  social\r\n\r\nmeal,  we were also comfortable enough to share each  other's\r\n\r\nhopes, aspirations and fears?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is perhaps the quantum leap we should strive\r\n\r\nfor  in  our  inter-ethnic ties.  It marks a transition  from\r\n\r\nitinerant  relations  perhaps to  life-long  friendships.   I\r\n\r\nthink it is time to challenge ourselves to strive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  this  higher  paradigm in inter-ethnic  relations,   one\r\n\r\nunderpinned by deep friendships and bonds of mutual trust.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was inspired by recent discussions and dialogues that\r\n\r\nwere  held  on a variety of issues pertaining to  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  in  Singapore,  in particular  on  madrasahs,  the\r\n\r\ntudung  issue and the Malays in the SAF, while I thought  the\r\n\r\noutcomes  may  not  have pleased everyone,  the  process  was\r\n\r\nsincere, serious and dignified.  That sort of initiative  and\r\n\r\nothers like the Inter-Racial Confidence Circles pave the  way\r\n\r\nfor more that can be done in this respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the Government should commit itself to a\r\n\r\nconstant  review of its policies to ensure that they engender\r\n\r\nmore of such friendships and to ensure that it can remove any\r\n\r\nimpediments that might lie in their path.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been diligent in our efforts to build a strong\r\n\r\nmulti-racial  Singapore.   But  over  the  years,   we   have\r\n\r\nintroduced a range of policies and programmes that have  been\r\n\r\nbased  on  ethnicity and language  -  ethnic  quotas  in  HDB\r\n\r\nestates,  self-help  groups,  GRCs,  SAP  schools  are   some\r\n\r\nexamples.   Some of these policies seek to further  integrate\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.    Others  were  designed   to   meet   certain\r\n\r\nobjectives  but might have had the unintended consequence  of\r\n\r\nfurther segregating us.  I  think it is hard to really assess\r\n\r\nwhat the cumulative effect has been on our society.  At best,\r\n\r\nI would say opinion is divided.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore advocate that the Government consider\r\n\r\nappointing  a standing Ministerial Committee to  monitor  the\r\n\r\nstate  of  ethnic relations in Singapore and to  periodically\r\n\r\nreview  policies and programmes that might have an impact  on\r\n\r\nour  inter-ethnic  ties.   The  purpose  is  not  to  discard\r\n\r\npolicies that have served us well, but to take stock  and  to\r\n\r\nensure  that in their totality, they continue to move  us  in\r\n\r\nthe right direction in pursuit of this ideal.  That, I think,\r\n\r\nwill  ensure  that this important  work-in-progress  receives\r\n\r\nregular  and  high level of attention it deserves.   Finally,\r\n\r\nSir, I do not wish to create the impres\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsion that this is the responsibility of Government alone.   I\r\n\r\nthink each and every Singaporean has a role to play, and  our\r\n\r\nschools  are  a good starting point.  Schools are  a  fertile\r\n\r\npoint  to  plant the seeds of such life-long friendships.   I\r\n\r\nwas  therefore  concerned to hear of anecdotal evidence  that\r\n\r\nstudents  are grouping along ethnic lines in our schools,  be\r\n\r\nit  in  their  choice of sports, CCA activities  or  even  in\r\n\r\nproject  groups or social activities.   I was at  a  dialogue\r\n\r\nsession   recently   when  one  of  the  teachers   who   was\r\n\r\nparticipating  shared with me how he was conducting  a  class\r\n\r\nand  he  asked the students to break up into groups of  four.\r\n\r\nAnd  he said  three students of one ethnic group went out  of\r\n\r\ntheir  way  to turn around so that they could have  a  fourth\r\n\r\nmember of the same group, rather than include in that group a\r\n\r\nstudent  from another ethnic community.  I was not sure  what\r\n\r\nto  be more troubled by, that there was such an occurrence in\r\n\r\nthe  classroom  or, as I later found out,  that  the  teacher\r\n\r\nseemed to be somewhat helpless about the situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we could argue that this is a natural occurrence and\r\n\r\nthat we really cannot do much about it.  But this House,  and\r\n\r\ncertainly  this Government, has never shied away from  action\r\n\r\non matters delicate when a larger national objective has been\r\n\r\nat  stake.  And I concede, Sir, these are awkward situations.\r\n\r\nIf  you act, you draw unnecessary attention to it.  If you do\r\n\r\nnot act, you allow an unhealthy situation to perpetuate.   So\r\n\r\nwhat do we do?  I do feel that in this sort of circumstances,\r\n\r\nsome  tact  and  with a little bit of deft action,  we  could\r\n\r\nperhaps make a difference.  So perhaps our principals,  vice-principals and teachers could be trained, counselled or  made\r\n\r\naware  so  that they can deal with such situations tactfully,\r\n\r\npreferably  imperceptibly, as and when  they  emerge  in  the\r\n\r\nclassroom, the school field or in the canteen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ultimately, I think all of us - the Government, the\r\n\r\ngrassroots   organisations  and  the  people  -   must   take\r\n\r\ncollective responsibility to ensure that Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinues  to move resolutely towards our ideal of  a  multi-racial society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theme of the debate on the President's Address has\r\n\r\nbeen the remaking of Singapore.  Remaking in the sense of new\r\n\r\npolicies, also in the sense of the process by which  the  new\r\n\r\npolicies  are  developed, the involvement, the  consultation,\r\n\r\nthe debate, the to-and-fro, the binding together of views  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  a  national consensus.  There is a strong desire,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  among  a significant proportion of the  well-educated\r\n\r\npublic  for  meaningful participation in this  process.   And\r\n\r\nthere  are  encouraging signs that in fact  this  process  is\r\n\r\ndeveloping.  Letters in the Forum page now often attract well-argued rebuttals, and no longer require official replies.  We\r\n\r\nhave  people  who  spend their time reading the  Forum  page,\r\n\r\nscanning for letters which need correction.  In the old days,\r\n\r\nan error would be tracked straightaway.  Nowadays, if we wait\r\n\r\na  couple  of  days,  somebody else will come  back  with  an\r\n\r\nopposite  way, and quite often a very sensible  and  balanced\r\n\r\ncorrection,  and we can allow the debate to play itself  out.\r\n\r\nSo,  I  think  we  are  going in the  right  direction.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  is convinced that this is the right  way  forward\r\n\r\nand is committed to involving Singaporeans in the process  of\r\n\r\nconsultation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One main exercise doing this is the Economic Review\r\n\r\nCommittee.  We are leaving no stone unturned in our review of\r\n\r\neconomic  policies,  whether it  is  labour,  whether  it  is\r\n\r\nmanufacturing, whether it is services, whether it  is  taxes,\r\n\r\nin  order  to  ensure that Singapore prospers  in  the  years\r\n\r\nahead.  We are taking some time to do this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen asked yesterday:</b> Why is it so long?\r\n\r\nIs it because the civil servants have no ideas?  I assure him\r\n\r\nthat it is not because the civil servants have no ideas.   It\r\n\r\nis because we are dealing with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlong-term  measures, having already dealt with the  immediate\r\n\r\nmeasures  last  year, in October/November, in a  $11  billion\r\n\r\nspecial off-Budget package.  We are considering major changes\r\n\r\nwhich  need  to be carefully weighed.  And we are taking  our\r\n\r\nconsultations extremely seriously.  In fact, if we had  acted\r\n\r\nsooner,  he might have accused us of not taking the  feedback\r\n\r\nwith  the seriousness which it deserves.  But we have to take\r\n\r\nthe  consultations seriously and we have to  take  views  and\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that what comes out is in fact fully  cooked  and\r\n\r\nproperly deliberated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real constraint on the pace of our progress is not\r\n\r\nthe   Government;  it  is  not  the  civil  service  or   the\r\n\r\nbureaucracy.  It is the people.  How quickly can  the  people\r\n\r\naccept  new  policies  and adapt  to  change?   That  is  the\r\n\r\nquestion.   Because new policies are unsettling, people  need\r\n\r\ntime  to get used to it, accept it, understand it, and  argue\r\n\r\nabout  it.   And we need time to understand how  to  get  the\r\n\r\npolicies  packaged, polished, rough edges smoothed  off,  and\r\n\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not sending all sacred cows to the\r\n\r\nslaughterhouse.   Mr  Lim Boon Heng said we  should  consider\r\n\r\nsending  some sacred cows to the slaughterhouse.  We are  not\r\n\r\nsending  all  of them.  But I assure you that we should  send\r\n\r\nall  our  sacred cows, at the very least, to the  vet  for  a\r\n\r\nthorough  examination to make sure that they are healthy  or,\r\n\r\nif they are not healthy, something can be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pride ourselves that in Singapore no issue is too\r\n\r\nsensitive  to be talked about, nothing is taboo which  cannot\r\n\r\nbe discussed.  If you raise a subject, we will debate it.  If\r\n\r\nthere is a problem, it will be solved.  But still some issues\r\n\r\nare  very  sensitive - even to raise, never mind  to  tackle.\r\n\r\nBut  we  are  talking about a fundamental  review  in  a  new\r\n\r\nsituation,  in  a different world, and unless  we  grasp  the\r\n\r\nnettle  and address these issues now, the problems are  going\r\n\r\nto grow and are going to become even harder to tackle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review process has to be managed. We are talking\r\n\r\nabout many people.  We are talking about many views.  We have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  discuss  issues  without alarming  people.   We  have  to\r\n\r\nimplement issues without jarring the system, but we  must  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  discuss many fundamental areas  which  we  have\r\n\r\ntaken  for granted.  As the President said, \"No policy is  so\r\n\r\ncast in stone that it can never be changed.\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge for us is to fix things that ain't broke\r\n\r\nyet.   If  something is broken, it is quite easy.   Everybody\r\n\r\ncan  see  it  is  no longer working, we have to  abandon  it,\r\n\r\nsomething  has  to  replace it.  But when  something  is  not\r\n\r\nbroken,  but you can see difficulties and problems  down  the\r\n\r\nroad,  then  we have to manage that, and it is not  so  easy.\r\n\r\nBecause, first, we have to persuade people that we do have  a\r\n\r\nproblem.   And they will say, \"Why do you want to  raise  the\r\n\r\nsubject  at all?  Matters are working fine.\"  And,  secondly,\r\n\r\nif  our  policies  are still working, we  want  to  make  the\r\n\r\nchanges and derive the benefits of making the changes without\r\n\r\nlosing  the  benefits of the old policies  because  they  are\r\n\r\nstill  working, they have served us well, and we do not  want\r\n\r\nto  change  them.   I  think in the  case  of  several  major\r\n\r\nfundamental  economic policies, we have to address  them  and\r\n\r\napproach them with this mindset.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will cite three just as examples, which are important\r\n\r\nones: the CPF, our wage policies and tax policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the CPF. It is one of the cornerstones of our\r\n\r\nsocial  safety  net.   It  provides for  workers,  for  their\r\n\r\nmedical  benefits,  for their housing, for  their  retirement\r\n\r\nbenefits, even for their children to go to university, and to\r\n\r\nborrow  from the CPF.  It is funded, it is sound.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nvaluable  instrument which we have patiently  built  up  over\r\n\r\nmany years.  But we now have to look at it again.  We have to\r\n\r\nreconcile business costs versus workers' needs.  We have  got\r\n\r\nto trade off multiple purposes to which the CPF might be put.\r\n\r\nHow much to go into housing, how much to go into medical, how\r\n\r\nmuch to go into retirement, how to balance them, what are the\r\n\r\npriorities.  We have to examine the structure of the CPF more\r\n\r\nclosely, to balance between these different uses and  to  ask\r\n\r\nsome basic questions.  As Mr Lim Boon Heng\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuggested  yesterday,  are we investing  too  much  money  in\r\n\r\nhousing?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also ask, how do we get the members not just\r\n\r\nto  leave  the money with the Government in the CPF and  earn\r\n\r\n2.5% interest, which over 40, 50 years of our working life is\r\n\r\nreally  not enough, but to invest the money in pension  funds\r\n\r\nfor  better long-term returns at acceptable risk, not to take\r\n\r\nit out and have a punt on the stock market, not to splurge it\r\n\r\non  a  consumption binge, but to invest it prudently  with  a\r\n\r\nportfolio, with professional managers who will not  guarantee\r\n\r\nyou  a  return every year but over five, 10, 20  years,  will\r\n\r\noffer  you much better than the Government can offer at  2.5%\r\n\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have to examine the structure of the CPF. We also\r\n\r\nhave  to  examine the specific problem of older workers  with\r\n\r\nCPF  -  older workers meaning those nearly 55, maybe from  50\r\n\r\nyears  onwards - having difficulty finding replacement  jobs,\r\n\r\nbecause  the job market is changing, and they are not willing\r\n\r\nto  work  for  low  take-home pay  because  they  still  have\r\n\r\nfamilies to look after.  And if you say 20% knocked  off  for\r\n\r\nCPF,  because that is his contribution, he says, \"Well, take-home  $700,  not worth my while to work.\"  Often,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthey are doing odd jobs for cash, with no CPF at all.  And we\r\n\r\nsee  them, they come to our meet-the-people sessions, we  ask\r\n\r\nthem:   What are you doing?  And the standard answer  is  sua\r\n\r\nkang, which means working for cash rather than for CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this group of people, nearly 55 years old, not very\r\n\r\nwell-educated in many cases, would a lower CPF rate make them\r\n\r\nmore  employable?  It is to be considered.  What about  their\r\n\r\nobligations?   They may have committed to houses.   They  may\r\n\r\nnot  have  finished paying for their mortgages.  This  is  an\r\n\r\nissue  which  we have to think about.  But, in my  view,  the\r\n\r\noverall CPF contribution rate, which is 40% as a target rate,\r\n\r\nis something which we should maintain.  We are not there yet,\r\n\r\nwe  are  back to 36% after the package in 1998.  But we  have\r\n\r\nstated that 40% is our target, and I think\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  keep that target.  We promise to restore it when we  made\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  cut  in 1998/99, and I think we should  uphold  our\r\n\r\npromise  to  the workers.  And I do not see any justification\r\n\r\nto  see the CPF below 40% in general, because if you consider\r\n\r\nthe  needs of the workers, housing, medical and pension,  40%\r\n\r\nis not excessive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that is the first sacred cow which needs a medical\r\n\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second one which needs an examination is wages. One\r\n\r\nissue  of  wages is portable medical benefits.  Members  have\r\n\r\ntalked  about  it.   The unions and the employers  have  been\r\n\r\ntalking  about  it  for some time, and the  issue  is  simply\r\n\r\nstated.   A  young  worker starting  out  can  work  for  any\r\n\r\nemployer  and  the  employer will  take  him.   He  is  still\r\n\r\nhealthy.   If  he falls ill, the employer bears  the  medical\r\n\r\nburden.   An  older worker, already with medical  conditions,\r\n\r\nwanting to change jobs has a very serious problem, because no\r\n\r\nnew  employer  wants  to take him and carry  that  burden  of\r\n\r\ntaking on his medical benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how do we provide workers with portable medical\r\n\r\nbenefits  so  that when he changes jobs from one employer  to\r\n\r\nanother, he carries his perks with him, in the same way as he\r\n\r\ncarries  the CPF benefits with him?  Right now, for employer-provided  benefits, if the employer retrenches or goes  bust,\r\n\r\nhe  loses  it.   But we need to move from that  to  something\r\n\r\nwhich  is  portable, which means a change from  the  existing\r\n\r\nemployer-provided,   employer-paid  benefits,   which   means\r\n\r\nsomething for workers to get used to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on wages, we have to think about retrenchment\r\n\r\nbenefits.  It is the traditional way for workers to tide them\r\n\r\nover  a  period of unemployment.  It is based  on  length  of\r\n\r\nservice.   The  longer you work, the more  your  retrenchment\r\n\r\nbenefits, and it is unfunded, which means that when the  time\r\n\r\ncomes,  the  company  looks  for  money  to  pay  for   these\r\n\r\nretrenchment  benefits.  This causes  a  problem.   From  the\r\n\r\npoint  of  view of the person who is retrenched, it is  good,\r\n\r\nbecause he gets something.  But the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unions have found that sometimes the benefits of a long-serving employee are a huge drain on the company's financial\r\n\r\nresources.   And the companies may be unable  to  pay  or  it\r\n\r\ncould  be that they can pay but it will endanger the jobs  of\r\n\r\nthe  remaining  workers, because if you pay the  retrenchment\r\n\r\nbenefits,  you  are  no longer viable and  able  to  continue\r\n\r\noperating.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the system has weaknesses. And as our business\r\n\r\ncycles  become  shorter as more workers  find  themselves  in\r\n\r\nbetween  jobs, we have got to find a better way to  do  this.\r\n\r\nOne idea which the unions have thought about and have floated\r\n\r\nwith  the employers is to get the employers and employees  to\r\n\r\nput  aside  a  certain amount of money every year  while  the\r\n\r\ncompany  is still in good health, for example, in an enhanced\r\n\r\nbonus system which will vest in their employees over a period\r\n\r\nof  time.  So you cannot draw it out straightaway.  It builds\r\n\r\nup,  it  is yours.  After a certain period of time,  you  can\r\n\r\ndraw  it.   And  you  replace  the  traditional  retrenchment\r\n\r\nbenefits with such a scheme.  It is an individual-based fund.\r\n\r\nThen  when  the employee is retrenched, you do not depend  on\r\n\r\nthe state of the company then, but you can draw down what you\r\n\r\nhave  earned  earlier  in this fund, in this  enhanced  bonus\r\n\r\nsystem, until you can find a new job.  Some employers already\r\n\r\ndo  this.  It is something which needs to be studied.  It may\r\n\r\nnot work for all of the companies.  We should look at this as\r\n\r\nwell  as other ideas.  But we have to examine the problem  of\r\n\r\nretrenchment benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key idea, when we talk about wages, is to free up\r\n\r\nthe   labour   market,  to  create  more  jobs.    The   more\r\n\r\nrestrictions  we may have, the more rules we have,  the  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  it  is we make for people to join jobs  and  leave\r\n\r\njobs, the more reluctant employers will be to take on workers\r\n\r\nand the higher our unemployment rate will be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Khalis earlier this afternoon suggested, for\r\n\r\nexample,  setting  up a mechanism for employers  to  have  to\r\n\r\njustify  to  the  Ministry  before they  can  retrench  their\r\n\r\nworkers and must give reasons and also answer for how much\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  are  paying their senior executives.   It  is  a  well-intentioned   proposal,  but  it  is   a   counter-productive\r\n\r\nproposal.   Because the result of this is for companies  when\r\n\r\nthey  would otherwise hire workers to ask themselves,  \"Do  I\r\n\r\nreally  want to take on somebody whom I may not need for  the\r\n\r\nlong term, whom I may have difficulty letting go off when the\r\n\r\nbusiness  conditions change, whom I may be stuck with?\"   And\r\n\r\nthe  answer is, \"Better not, work overtime with the  existing\r\n\r\nworkers, don't hire extra hands.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a theoretical risk. It is a real problem.\r\n\r\nIn  Germany,  which has the tightest laws for firing  workers\r\n\r\nand  is the most difficult of all to let go of workers,  they\r\n\r\nhave  the  highest  unemployment  rates,  and  it  is  not  a\r\n\r\ncoincidence.   It is because employers make the calculations:\r\n\r\ntoo  hard to drop, better do not hire.  So the key idea which\r\n\r\nwe  must follow is to free up the labour market, make it easy\r\n\r\nfor  people to change jobs and then we will be able  to  have\r\n\r\nhigh employment rates, not unemployment rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue which we have to consider is taxation.\r\n\r\nLower direct taxes, lower corporate and personal income taxes\r\n\r\nare  essential if we are going to prosper in the next  phase.\r\n\r\nThey are essential because of competitiveness reasons.  Other\r\n\r\ncountries  have  been bringing down their  direct  tax  rates\r\n\r\ndrastically over the years and continuing to do  so,  and  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  be competitive with them.  The Europeans,  some  of\r\n\r\nthem,  the  Germans are 30%-plus corporate tax.   If  we  are\r\n\r\nequal  to  them,  there is no reason why they  will  consider\r\n\r\ncoming to Singapore.  Others are bringing direct taxes  down,\r\n\r\nwe have to do the same.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to attract talent intensive service industries\r\n\r\nto  Singapore.  We are not talking just about factories where\r\n\r\nhundreds  of millions of dollars of investments, one  or  two\r\n\r\nemployees  ordered  to  go, he goes  to  Singapore.   We  are\r\n\r\ntalking  about  fund  managers,  we  are  talking  about   IT\r\n\r\ncompanies, creative companies, people, movies, software.  The\r\n\r\npeople  are the company.  The people are high-earning people.\r\n\r\nIf  your  tax is not competitive, the person says,  \"I'm  not\r\n\r\ngoing to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"  The company will not be here.  We have seen  it.\r\n\r\nOur  promoting  agencies - MAS, IDA, EDB -  repeatedly,  when\r\n\r\nthey want to try and bring activities to Singapore, they  are\r\n\r\nasked,  \"How much more tax do I have to pay?\"  So that  is  a\r\n\r\nserious  reason to bring down not just the corporate tax  but\r\n\r\nthe personal tax as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to bring down direct taxes to encourage\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship because an entrepreneur goes in, if you want\r\n\r\nhim  to  risk  everything, then he must have  the  chance  of\r\n\r\ngaining  a  great  deal.   And  if  you  say,  if  you   risk\r\n\r\neverything, you lose, too bad, I give you a pat on the  back,\r\n\r\nperhaps a medal.  But you gain, you win, I will tax you  30%-40%,  you  would not get entrepreneurship.  It is  one  basic\r\n\r\nreason  why there are not so many entrepreneurs in Europe  as\r\n\r\nin  America  because, in America, tax rates  are  lower,  and\r\n\r\nEurope  is not worth your while.  In short, we have to  bring\r\n\r\nour  direct  tax rates down to encourage more investments  to\r\n\r\ngrow the economy and, ultimately, which is most important for\r\n\r\nus, to create good well-paying jobs for Singaporeans.  Unless\r\n\r\nyou bring the direct tax rates down, you cannot do that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we cannot just bring the direct tax\r\n\r\nrates  down.   You  have got to balance the  budget.   If  we\r\n\r\nsimply  cut  direct taxes, we will end up with  a  structural\r\n\r\ndeficit,  meaning  whether the economy is  up  or  down,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot balance its books and we will run a  budget\r\n\r\ndeficit.   For  example, Hong Kong now has  quite  a  serious\r\n\r\nfiscal  problem  because they have lost one major  source  of\r\n\r\nrevenue, which is land sales.  Their tax rates are very  low,\r\n\r\ntheir budget is in deficit. The Financial Secretary hopes  to\r\n\r\nbring it back into balance over a period of seven years,  but\r\n\r\nthere  are no easy solutions and raising taxes is very,  very\r\n\r\ndifficult.  But we have to balance the budget and a  balanced\r\n\r\nbudget, in fact a modest surplus maintained over many  years,\r\n\r\nhas  been  one  of the fundamental reasons why the  Singapore\r\n\r\ndollar  has  been  strong, why inflation has  been  low,  why\r\n\r\neverybody's CPF balances and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsavings have had their value protected.  So unless we protect\r\n\r\nthe  balanced budget, we are going to have a very fundamental\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if we are going to bring direct taxes down and we are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  balance the budget, there is only one  conclusion,\r\n\r\nthat  we  have to bring up indirect taxes.  What are indirect\r\n\r\ntaxes?  We have car taxes.  We could raise those if they  are\r\n\r\nnot  high enough.  But I am not sure many Members will  agree\r\n\r\nthat  they are not high enough.  And there is GST,  a  broad-based  tax  which applies to everything, paid  by  everybody,\r\n\r\nweighs  lightly on the whole economy because it is very  well\r\n\r\nspread,  efficient to collect and a stable source of  revenue\r\n\r\nfor the exchequer, whether the economy goes up or the economy\r\n\r\ngoes down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if we are going to lower direct taxes, we will have\r\n\r\nto consider raising the GST.  But before we raise the GST, we\r\n\r\nhave  to think very carefully about a couple of issues.  One,\r\n\r\ntiming,  to  be  only done when the economy is  on  a  firmer\r\n\r\nfooting.  We have to judge when we think that will be  ready,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  do  not  want to put the  economy  back  into  a\r\n\r\nrecession by an ill-judged move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have to consider the impact of any GST\r\n\r\nadjustment  on  the  lower income group.  Because  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  group  consumes a large part of their income  or,  in\r\n\r\nsome  cases, even all of their disposable income and  so  any\r\n\r\nextra tax  is an extra burden to them.  Therefore, if we  are\r\n\r\ngoing to adjust the GST, we have to buffer the overall burden\r\n\r\non  these  lower income groups.  And we also have to  address\r\n\r\nspecific  concerns over certain vital essentials - education,\r\n\r\nhealthcare, public transport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the way we did it in 1994 when we first introduced\r\n\r\nthe GST was we had a comprehensive offset package so that  we\r\n\r\ncould  make  a  calculation  and assure  everybody  and  show\r\n\r\nexamples that if you are in a 3-room flat or 4-room flat, the\r\n\r\noffset which you get to tide you over a transition period  is\r\n\r\nmore  than enough to offset the tax which you would  have  to\r\n\r\npay in GST every year for every\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhousehold.   And in addition to that, we also had reassurance\r\n\r\non education, on healthcare, on public transport, on specific\r\n\r\ncritical items so that nobody will be alarmed, panicked  into\r\n\r\nthinking  that  this is going to be an unbearable  burden  on\r\n\r\nhim, which it is not.  That was what we did last time when we\r\n\r\nhave to do GST.  This time, we must do the same.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members will agree with me that it is never\r\n\r\npopular  to suggest the possibility of new taxes.  But  going\r\n\r\nforward,  restructuring our taxes is a vital step for  us  to\r\n\r\ngear  up  our economy for the changed environment  to  create\r\n\r\nmore jobs.  I look back to 1994 when we first introduced  the\r\n\r\nGST.   We  reduced  direct taxes in 1994 and,  in  subsequent\r\n\r\nyears,  whenever  our  finances  strengthened,  we  gradually\r\n\r\nbrought  direct taxes down again.  So, today,  our  corporate\r\n\r\ntax  is 24 1/2%, our personal tax is 26 1/2%.  Because of that,\r\n\r\nour  economy grew after 1994-1995, 1996;  1997, we did  well;\r\n\r\n1998,  the  Asian crisis came, we still had positive  growth;\r\n\r\n1999, we picked up;  2000, we had a boom year;  2001, the  US\r\n\r\neconomy tanked, the electronics sector went into a slump,  we\r\n\r\nwent  down.  But we went down from a high level, we went down\r\n\r\nfrom  an economy which was strong, we went down with reserves\r\n\r\nin our pocket so that when we needed to help people, we could\r\n\r\ntake  some of these reserves and we could have generous  off-Budget  packages last year - the New Singapore Shares  -  and\r\n\r\ntherefore,  we could pull through the crisis and manage.   If\r\n\r\nwe  did not have that, had we kept our tax rates around  30%,\r\n\r\nwhich  is where they were when we first started this process,\r\n\r\nand  just gone ahead, I think we would have gradually  slowed\r\n\r\ndown  well before 1997/1998; and come 2001, we would  have  a\r\n\r\nserious  problem and unemployment would have been much,  much\r\n\r\nhigher than it is today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, these are the considerations which the Economic\r\n\r\nReview  Committee  is working through.  The  subcommittee  is\r\n\r\nfinalising  their recommendations.  The subcommittee  on  tax\r\n\r\nwhich Mr Tharman is chairing, I believe Mr Tharman intends to\r\n\r\nrelease his recommendations next\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nweek.   When the Government receives his recommendations,  we\r\n\r\nwill consider them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the specific issues which we have to deal\r\n\r\nwith, one broader issue which we should consider, as we  look\r\n\r\nforward, is the question of our social safety nets.  We  have\r\n\r\nbeen  careful over the years to avoid subsidising consumption\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  We subsidise investments, broadly understood,\r\n\r\neducation, housing, basic healthcare.  It has been  important\r\n\r\nto  us that we did this because we are not just a free market\r\n\r\neconomy,  we  are also a nation and we are also investing  in\r\n\r\nour  people and building a population together.  These social\r\n\r\nsafety nets will remain major elements of our social compact.\r\n\r\nIt  is part of the deal.  You are a Singaporean, this is  the\r\n\r\npackage.  You work, you do well, but to start off with,  here\r\n\r\nare  things which you will get, not quite a birth right,  but\r\n\r\nwhich  every  Singaporean  will get.   The  safety  nets  are\r\n\r\nespecially necessary to protect the minority who cannot  fend\r\n\r\nfor  themselves.  But for education, housing and  healthcare,\r\n\r\nour  target group is not just the bottom 20% who cannot  look\r\n\r\nafter  themselves.  In order to fulfil our social objectives,\r\n\r\nwe  are aiming these expenditures on a broad middle ground of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans because we want full and equal opportunities for\r\n\r\neverybody.  So everybody goes to Government schools.  We want\r\n\r\na home owning society.  So 90% of the population lives in HDB\r\n\r\nflats.   We want good basic medical care.  So we have  social\r\n\r\npolicies which reach the vast majority of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These social supports are still important. But we have\r\n\r\ngot  to  fine-tune them and especially, we have got to  fine-tune  the housing and healthcare part to keep them effective.\r\n\r\nThe  State  must not over-provide because, by over-providing,\r\n\r\nwe  may  undermine enterprise and self-reliance  and  we  may\r\n\r\ncreate  a  dependence  mentality.  Our  experience  with  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Downturn  Relief Scheme, which we  introduced  last\r\n\r\nyear,   is   quite   salutary.   MPs  will  have   first-hand\r\n\r\nexperience.  We did it because we needed to do it, because we\r\n\r\nwere in a sharp recession.  So we said up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto $200 for three months.  But quite a number of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nspread  the  word around that the Government is  distributing\r\n\r\nmoney.  And they came to queue up for the hand-out because it\r\n\r\nwould  have  been remiss of them not to come  and  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity.  And they came and we met them at the  meet-the-people  session.   I had one young man come  perfectly  able-bodied,  strapping, he said, \"Where is my  money?\"   I  said,\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by where is your money?\"  He said, \"I  only\r\n\r\ngot $100.\"  I said, \"Why should you have more than $100?\"  He\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"You  said $200 x 3 months here.\"  He  produced  me  a\r\n\r\nnewspaper  cutting.  I said, \"It says up to  $200  for  three\r\n\r\nmonths.\"   He  looked at it, he said, \"You said up  to  $200.\r\n\r\nYou  did  not  say  up  to three months.\"   So  I  asked  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots leaders to review his case again very carefully to\r\n\r\ndetermine how much he really needed from the EDRS.  But  from\r\n\r\nhis  point  of  view,  and many other  Singaporeans',  it  is\r\n\r\nrational.  \"You are distributing, I better make a bid.\"   So,\r\n\r\nif  we  are  going to help people, we will have  to  be  very\r\n\r\ncareful  to make sure people make an effort.  And it  is  not\r\n\r\njust a hand-out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we very quickly learnt. Now, when they come, all the\r\n\r\nMPs  say,  \"Here you are.  I have a list of jobs.   Have  you\r\n\r\napplied  for  any  of them?  If not, here is  an  application\r\n\r\nform.   After  you  have tried, come back  and  look  for  me\r\n\r\nagain.\"   And  even  the  new  MPs  have  also  learnt   this\r\n\r\ntechnique, because this is the way human nature is  and  that\r\n\r\nis  what we have to guard against.  We are nowhere near that,\r\n\r\nbut  we  have  to make sure that our safety nets avoid  that.\r\n\r\nAnd in the case of healthcare, we are making some adjustments\r\n\r\nand  the  Ministry of Health is introducing  selective  means\r\n\r\ntesting to direct the benefits to where they are most  needed\r\n\r\nand, in the case of housing, MND is also making some reviews.\r\n\r\nThese are major adjustments which can only take place over  a\r\n\r\nperiod of time because they affect a lot of people.  But they\r\n\r\nare adjustments which we have to begin to think about and  to\r\n\r\nimplement carefully, step by step.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I now speak about the role of the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   Dr  Wang Kai Yuen asked what is the  Government\r\n\r\nfor.  The people have elected us.  What do you expect of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say this is what the Government needs to do, as\r\n\r\nfar  as  economic management is concerned.   First,  set  the\r\n\r\nstrategic  direction for the country.  Make this a prosperous\r\n\r\ndeveloped   economy,  one  where  everybody   benefits   from\r\n\r\nprogress, make this a stable and harmonious society where all\r\n\r\nthe  races and religions live peacefully together.   That  is\r\n\r\nthe  first  requirement.   Set the goal,  set  the  strategic\r\n\r\nobjective,  persuade everybody, that is what we  are  working\r\n\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, pursue prudent macro-economic policies: be\r\n\r\ncareful  with our taxes; be careful with our budget spending;\r\n\r\nbe  careful with our exchange rate policy or monetary policy,\r\n\r\nmeaning  the  Singapore dollar exchange  rate;  do  not  take\r\n\r\nliberties, do not take shortcuts, because if we decide to  go\r\n\r\nfor deficit financing, borrow money to spend or we decide  to\r\n\r\ndepreciate  the  currency as a way out of our  troubles,  the\r\n\r\nlogical  conclusion of that is Argentina.  We are not getting\r\n\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Government has to set the rules for micro-economics, to make it efficient, to make sure that people can\r\n\r\ndo  business properly.  So we liberalised telecommunications.\r\n\r\nYou  can  have  001,  008, 018, any number  of  international\r\n\r\ntelephone numbers.  Let there be free competition.  We cannot\r\n\r\ngo  and micro-manage who can charge you how much, but we  can\r\n\r\nset  an environment where there will be competition and  that\r\n\r\nwill  bring  the price down.  So we are talking about  petrol\r\n\r\nprices.   We cannot decide how much the petrol companies  can\r\n\r\ncharge  you.    It is impossible.  We are not  operating  the\r\n\r\npetrol  companies.  But we can say, \"Here  are  white  sites.\r\n\r\nTake  them.\"   If  NTUC  wants to run a  petrol  station  and\r\n\r\ncompete  against the petrol companies, by all means  may  the\r\n\r\ncheapest  petrol win.  But please manage the  queues  outside\r\n\r\nthe petrol station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we need to have the right micro-economic rules. We\r\n\r\nset the rules.  We do not play the game.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we have to invest in people, in infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThat  is  critical.  You could take a purist  view  and  say,\r\n\r\n\"Well,  the  market will do it.  I will not build  trains,  I\r\n\r\nwill  not  build  schools,  I  will  not  fund  education  in\r\n\r\nuniversity.\"   But as a pragmatic approach, we  think  it  is\r\n\r\nright,  we think it is the best way.  The Government will  do\r\n\r\nthis,  because  if  the Government did  not  do  this,  quite\r\n\r\nfrankly,  I  do  not think it would be done  and,  certainly,\r\n\r\nwould not be done as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, overall, we can foster a pro-growth environment in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   You can go to China.  Yes, it is  cheaper.   The\r\n\r\nland  is cheaper.  Many people brighter, some of them  better\r\n\r\neducated than ours.  But a whole pro-growth environment, that\r\n\r\nis  not  so  easy for them to produce, and that is  something\r\n\r\nwhich  we  can  produce  in Singapore.   We  have  harmonious\r\n\r\ntripartite  relationships.  The unions  work  with  us.   The\r\n\r\nemployers  work  with us.  We have the whole system  working,\r\n\r\nwhether it is the banks, whether it is the telecommunications\r\n\r\ncompanies,  the  Government  is  predictable,  there  are  no\r\n\r\narbitrary impost, there is no red-tape.  We have a pro-growth\r\n\r\nenvironment, but we will focus on what the Government can  do\r\n\r\nbut  the private sector cannot do.  If the private sector can\r\n\r\ndo  it,  we will leave it to them.  If they cannot do it,  we\r\n\r\nwill  do it.  What we cannot do, as a Government, is  to  be:\r\n\r\nemployer  of last resort - if you cannot find a job,  I  will\r\n\r\nhire you; investor of last resort - you need somebody to  buy\r\n\r\ninto  your  company, I will do that; or Father  Christmas  of\r\n\r\nlast resort - nobody else will do for you, we will do that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen says how can we be going just on the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  self-reliance, we are such a small country,  small\r\n\r\nisland without resources.  I say, on the contrary, because we\r\n\r\nare  a  small island, because we have no resources, therefore\r\n\r\nwe  have to be self-reliant.  If we were a big country, if we\r\n\r\nhad oil, gas, timber and gold, then we do not have to be self-reliant.   You  just sit back, the Government  will  provide.\r\n\r\nBut,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlacking  those,  we  have  to fall  back  on  our  wits,  our\r\n\r\nstrength, our effort, and that means Singaporeans have to  be\r\n\r\nself-reliant.  Those were just the cards we were  dealt  with\r\n\r\nwhen we were created, and that is the way we are.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several MPs raised the question of keeping costs low.\r\n\r\nMr  Ravindran  mentioned this first.  He  asked  whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment departments were making huge profits.  After that,\r\n\r\nMr  Steve Chia echoed him.  I have a friendly word of  advice\r\n\r\nfor Steve Chia who may be new, that he should be careful when\r\n\r\nhe  picks up points from the PAP Backbenchers and uses  them.\r\n\r\nUsually  it is quite safe because our Backbenchers make  good\r\n\r\npoints but, once in a while, they are off target and then  he\r\n\r\nwill be in trouble.  In this case, I think they are wrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans get Government cheaply. The total tax\r\n\r\nburden  in  Singapore is only 18% of the GDP.  If we  go  for\r\n\r\nwelfare  programmes, if we have more subsidies,  if  we  have\r\n\r\nunemployment  benefits, if we go for free medical  care  like\r\n\r\nEuropean countries or like Britain, then the burden  will  go\r\n\r\nup  and  the  cost  will  go up.  In Europe,  the  government\r\n\r\nconsumes 45% of GDP.  We are 18%.  In America, which has much\r\n\r\nlighter burdens than Europe, the government consumes  30%  of\r\n\r\nGDP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the way to have low costs is for us to have a small\r\n\r\nGovernment and keep our subsidies to a minimum.  There is  no\r\n\r\nfree  lunch or, as the Opposition sometimes says, in Chinese,\r\n\r\n\"yang  mao  chu zai yang shen shang\", ie, wool on  the  sheep\r\n\r\ngrows  from  the  body  of  the sheep.   Anything  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment spends, it is the people's money.  If  we  do  not\r\n\r\nrecover  the  costs of services, then the Government  has  to\r\n\r\nfund  these services from taxes or from printing money.   Our\r\n\r\npolicy  is  to recover the costs, no more.  We  try  hard  to\r\n\r\nimprove  efficiency  and  cut costs further,  and  there  are\r\n\r\nopportunities to do that.  And I would not say that, in every\r\n\r\nsingle  instance,  we are as lean and as  trim  as  we  could\r\n\r\nabsolutely be.  But, by and large, we are not doing too badly\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just to make quite sure, let me make you all a\r\n\r\ngenerous offer.  Anybody who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthinks that we are overcharging for any service and that  you\r\n\r\ncould  do  it cheaper, make us an offer, take over  providing\r\n\r\nthat service, and we will make a deal with you.  You take  it\r\n\r\nover,  you make a reasonable margin, we will save some  money\r\n\r\nand  the  public  will also save some money.   We  are  quite\r\n\r\nserious about that.  From the Ministry of Finance's point  of\r\n\r\nview,  if people will come forward with such offers, it  will\r\n\r\nmake  it  much  easier for me, as Finance Minister,  to  keep\r\n\r\nexpenditures and taxes down.  But, by and large, we  are  not\r\n\r\ndoing badly and our policy, as stated in the Addenda, is  not\r\n\r\nfor  us  to make a profit from our services.  It is  just  to\r\n\r\nbreak even and cover our costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if I may put in a good word for civil servants.\r\n\r\nAssoc.  Prof. Chin Tet Yung blames civil servants  for  rigid\r\n\r\npolicies  and  for not listening with their hearts.   Dr  Amy\r\n\r\nKhor  also  asked  for civil servants to be  less  rule-bound\r\n\r\nbecause,  otherwise, they may be neither civil nor  servants.\r\n\r\nAfter the former Speaker's speech yesterday, I hesitate to be\r\n\r\nmisunderstood  as  being thin-skinned, but  since  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants  are unable to defend themselves, it is my  duty  to\r\n\r\nspeak on their behalf.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil servants do not always measure up to the ideals\r\n\r\nwhich we have set for ourselves in the Public Service 21, but\r\n\r\nwe  have  set  our ideals and we do try our best,  first,  to\r\n\r\nimplement efficiently, flexibly and courteously policies and,\r\n\r\nsecondly,  to be transparent and to explain the decision  and\r\n\r\nwhy  we  have reached a certain decision, even if  we  cannot\r\n\r\naccede  to  it.  It is not always possible, because sometimes\r\n\r\nreasons  are  confidential, sometimes a matter  of  judgement\r\n\r\nand,  if  it is a matter of opinion, then a panel of decision\r\n\r\nmakers  has  to look at the facts and decide.   There  is  no\r\n\r\nright  or wrong.  If you are the appellant, you will say,  \"I\r\n\r\nwant  it\";  if  he is the decision maker, he has  to  make  a\r\n\r\ndecision.   But, to the extent possible, we will explain,  we\r\n\r\nwill  operate  efficiently, quickly and we will  give  you  a\r\n\r\nproper answer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But remember that the policies are decided by the\r\n\r\npolitical leaders, not by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncivil   servants.    We,   the  Executive,   have   to   take\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  If the policy is wrong, the MPs should raise\r\n\r\nit  in Parliament and we can debate it and decide whether  we\r\n\r\nare  right, in which case, the policy stands, or, if  we  are\r\n\r\nwrong, in which case, the policy should be changed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the specific case which Assoc. Prof. Chin raised\r\n\r\nabout  HDB  not  approving premature requests to  sell  flats\r\n\r\nbecause  owners cannot afford it and they want to  downgrade,\r\n\r\nit  so  turns out that it is not true that HDB never  agrees.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, HDB does agree.  It examines all the cases\r\n\r\nand,  in  specific cases where there are good justifications,\r\n\r\nHDB  will act.  Last year, they had about 30 cases where  the\r\n\r\nminimum occupation period was waived for financial hardship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if there is a policy which is not right, Parliament\r\n\r\nis  the place to debate it.  If there are cases which are not\r\n\r\nproperly handled ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> DPM, could I interrupt you, please, to\r\n\r\nallow Mr Mah to move the exempted motion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down on the\r\n\r\nOrder Paper for today be exempted at this day's sitting  from\r\n\r\nthe provisions of Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Debate on the Address)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the cases are\r\n\r\nnot properly handled and in Members' view an exception should\r\n\r\nbe  made  or  the rule should be changed, raise it  with  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary, raise it with the Minister  and  it\r\n\r\nwill  be seen to.  We all take meet-the-people session  (MPS)\r\n\r\ncases, we have seen hundreds and thousands of them.  Not  all\r\n\r\nthe  MPS  cases  can  succeed.

So not all the cases can succeed but, if you  are\r\n\r\na  conscientious  MP, you will know that some  cases  deserve\r\n\r\nspecial  effort.  And if there is a special case, it is  your\r\n\r\nduty  to  take  it  up.   If  you cannot  get  joy  from  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary, you raise with the Minister.  If the\r\n\r\nMinister cannot solve it, then the MPs can raise with  me  or\r\n\r\nthe PM.  Everybody knows that PM is a very gentle man, and  I\r\n\r\ntry  my  best not to bristle.  So I think the matter  can  be\r\n\r\nresolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil servants have to listen with their hearts but,\r\n\r\nactually,  it is the duty of the political leaders to  listen\r\n\r\nwith  their  hearts and also to think with  their  heads  and\r\n\r\nthen,  when  you  set policies, set the right policies  which\r\n\r\nwill achieve the best results for Singapore.  That is how the\r\n\r\nsystem is supposed to work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have done well for many years because we have always\r\n\r\nlooked  beyond our immediate problems to anticipate  problems\r\n\r\nand events which are over the horizon.  I just give you a few\r\n\r\nstray examples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water tariffs. We started revising them up in 1997. We\r\n\r\ndid  it  over three or four years.  Now they are at  a  level\r\n\r\nwhere  it  is  viable  for  us  to  develop  NEWater  as   an\r\n\r\nalternative additional source of water.  That is critical.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial services. We liberalised it in 1997, just\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Asian financial crisis.  There  we  should  have\r\n\r\nforeseen  things a little earlier, but we were in  time,  and\r\n\r\njust  in  time to get ourselves repositioned.   So  there  is\r\n\r\nstill  a  basis for Singapore to be a financial  centre  now,\r\n\r\ndespite the difficulties of the countries around us.  Had  we\r\n\r\nnot  moved  in 1997, I think we would be in deep difficulties\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GST, in 1994, which enabled us to reduce direct taxes\r\n\r\nover  the years and kept us competitive, enabled us to  reach\r\n\r\nhere  and  to think of the next step of the restructuring  of\r\n\r\nour tax system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And political self-renewal, done over many years, which\r\n\r\nhas brought us this new Parliament, not just the latest batch\r\n\r\nof  MPs  but  the successive batches of MPs -  fresh  voices,\r\n\r\nfresh  ideas, representatives of the population in tune  with\r\n\r\nthe mood ready to bring Singapore ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can we expect if we look ahead? Slower growth,\r\n\r\nless   equal   distribution   of  income,   more   structural\r\n\r\nunemployment.  Mr Low Thia Khiang highlighted these words  of\r\n\r\nthe President and they are on the cards.  Our policies cannot\r\n\r\nprevent these trends from happening because these are  global\r\n\r\ntrends  which  will  carry us along.  But  our  policies  can\r\n\r\nmitigate these trends.  If we do the right things, we can  be\r\n\r\ncompetitive,  we  will attract investments,  we  will  create\r\n\r\njobs,  we  will enable people to earn their own  living,  far\r\n\r\nmore than any Government hongbaos or generosity.  That is why\r\n\r\nwe  have  got to make the strategic choices now.  The changes\r\n\r\nare  uncomfortable and unsettling, yes, but if  we  make  the\r\n\r\nchanges now, if we accept the discomfort and the pain, if  we\r\n\r\nfind ways to minimise the difficulties and implement what  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  do, then we will give ourselves the best chance  of\r\n\r\nsucceeding as a nation in the uncertain times ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br>4.02 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in his\r\n\r\nAddress,  the  President  has  outlined  the  challenges  for\r\n\r\nSingapore and the steps we need going forward in this era  of\r\n\r\na  globalised economy.  I would like to echo his call and  to\r\n\r\nspecially  mention  three areas that are  worth  our  further\r\n\r\ndeliberations.  They are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The inevitable outcome of globalisation in widening\r\n\r\nthe income gap, thereby increasing the societal divide;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The redesigning of the education system in\r\n\r\nSingapore; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The revamping of the healthcare scene in the\r\n\r\nglobalised economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my first topic, Sir, Singapore families are earning\r\n\r\nmore than a decade ago but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  2000  Census  data  shows that the  divide  between  the\r\n\r\nrichest and the very poor has widened.  During the last year,\r\n\r\nthe top 20% of households had an average income 21 times that\r\n\r\nfor  the  lowest 20%.  This trend is going to  stay  and  the\r\n\r\ndivide  is  going to broaden further in the  next  10  to  20\r\n\r\nyears.   This  is  inevitable with the  change  when  we  are\r\n\r\nstriving towards an entrepreneurial and innovative society in\r\n\r\nthe face of a globalised world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this is a concern was reflected in what the\r\n\r\nPresident  said,  and I quote, \"our income distribution  will\r\n\r\nstretch\",  and  \"as we upgrade our economy, we must  maintain\r\n\r\nand  strengthen  our social cohesion\".  The  fear  from  this\r\n\r\ndivide is the disruption of the stability and very fabric  of\r\n\r\nour  society.  The social and political implications will  be\r\n\r\ngreat.   Sir, my concerns are especially for those low income\r\n\r\nearners  who  will be further marginalised due to  their  low\r\n\r\neducation and significant structural unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an urgent need for efforts to maintain social\r\n\r\ncohesion  as globalisation pulls the wages of top earners  up\r\n\r\nwhile pressing those of the least well-off down.  What can be\r\n\r\ndone?   The  assistance for the lowest strata of the  society\r\n\r\nthat  are  existing from our Government must be re-looked  to\r\n\r\nsee  if  they  are  adequate to keep  up  with  this  present\r\n\r\nwidening income strength.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to review our various schemes on a more\r\n\r\nregular  basis.  Especially as Mr Lee just said earlier  that\r\n\r\nthere  may be a rise in indirect taxes that will have  impact\r\n\r\non  lower  income groups.  Sir, the PAP won a strong  mandate\r\n\r\nfrom Singaporeans because the PAP has a tremendous record for\r\n\r\nbeing  able to deliver on its promises to the people.  Today,\r\n\r\nI  would  like to ask on behalf of Singaporeans that the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment not only make good the promises it has made in the\r\n\r\nlast  GE,  but  also  make it at a speedier  pace.   This  is\r\n\r\nespecially so where there is much sufferance incurred on  the\r\n\r\nneedy,  the  retrenched and on the children of families  with\r\n\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As DPM Tony Tan has said, \"The job of MPs is to attend\r\n\r\nnot just the big picture, but also these personal concerns of\r\n\r\ntheir  constituents\".  Sir, whilst all MPs should  contribute\r\n\r\ntowards  remaking our future, they must also have a  hand  on\r\n\r\nforging   a  new  social  impact.   Therefore,  more  schemes\r\n\r\ninvolving MPs should be put in place in the delivery of  help\r\n\r\nand care to the residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second topic, Mr Speaker, Sir, is this. In the past\r\n\r\nfew  years,  education in Singapore had undergone changes  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for flexibility and innovations to enhance  national\r\n\r\neconomic   competitiveness  in  the  global   economy.    The\r\n\r\nPresident has said, and I quote, \"We should inculcate in  the\r\n\r\nyoung  a more inquiring and adventurous spirit, and encourage\r\n\r\nthem  to  think  up new ideas and create new  opportunities\".\r\n\r\nSir,  I agree with the President and I would like to add that\r\n\r\nsuch  inculcation  in our young must be started  early,  when\r\n\r\nthey are still in school, to have greatest impact.  Whilst  I\r\n\r\napplaud  the Government for redesigning our education  system\r\n\r\nto  one  where,  among  other things,  creativity  is  highly\r\n\r\nencouraged,  one  cannot  help but wonder  how  this  can  be\r\n\r\nachieved  if our students are under constant stress.   Surely\r\n\r\nthis  will  have  a  negative impact on and  can  potentially\r\n\r\nstifle  the development of creativity and innovation  in  our\r\n\r\nstudents.   Although  we  have an internationally  recognised\r\n\r\neducation   system,   we  have  unfortunately   developed   a\r\n\r\nreputation for having a stressful education system.  Children\r\n\r\ncomplain that they have little time for play because they are\r\n\r\nburdened with plenty of homework and studying for assessments\r\n\r\nand  examinations,  besides having to participate  in  extra-curricular  activities  and going for tuition  or  enrichment\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study by Dr Stella Quah of the National University of\r\n\r\nSingapore on the Singapore Family revealed that the  greatest\r\n\r\nworry for about 45% of them came from the problems associated\r\n\r\nwith their children's education.  In 1998, 2,358 new cases of\r\n\r\nchildren  aged  below  18  were  registered  at  Government's\r\n\r\npsychiatric clinics.  In almost 95% of the cases, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren  were  not mad.  Sir, they were just  stressed  out.\r\n\r\nHalf  of these cases were children from primary schools,  35%\r\n\r\nfrom  secondary schools and 15% were pre-schoolers.   Parents\r\n\r\nhave been blamed for the stress in children.  If this is  so,\r\n\r\nthen  it  is  time  to also look into the causal  factors  in\r\n\r\nparents and address them accordingly.  We need to re-look  at\r\n\r\nheavy syllabus with too much homework and stress, ranking  of\r\n\r\nschools, streaming and varsity-entry criteria and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the stress of education is real for students. The\r\n\r\nGovernment   has  recognised  that  innovative   skills   and\r\n\r\ncreativity are important.  But its push to promote innovative\r\n\r\nskills  and creativity in children may be jeopardised by  the\r\n\r\namount  of  maximum curricula in the name of maximising  each\r\n\r\nchild's potential.  Sir, how do we transit into the new  way?\r\n\r\nAre   there  existing  policies  that  in  fact  impede  this\r\n\r\ntransition?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning my last topic, Mr Speaker, Sir, is the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Singapore into the Medical Hub of  the  region\r\n\r\nand turning Singapore into the Mayo Clinic of Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that recently, Government leaders have said\r\n\r\nthat Singapore's economy can be revamped by promoting it as a\r\n\r\nregional  hub  for  services like healthcare,  education  and\r\n\r\ntourism.   Sir, it is possible to develop Singapore into  the\r\n\r\nMayo Clinic of Southeast Asia if we put our minds to it.  The\r\n\r\nMayo  Clinic  in the United States is one of the top  medical\r\n\r\ncentres  in  the  world, giving comprehensive  treatment  for\r\n\r\nvirtually  any  disease.  I would like to  discuss  the  ways\r\n\r\ntowards this path.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortage of doctors and medical personnel is a limiting\r\n\r\nfactor  and I feel the way to overcome it now is to  maximise\r\n\r\nthe  pool we have at the moment.  Training new ones will take\r\n\r\ntime, but this is not to say we need not start training  more\r\n\r\nnew  ones  right  now.  Maximisation of our present  pool  of\r\n\r\ndoctors  has to come from the integration of the  public  and\r\n\r\nprivate sectors. We need to treat both sectors as one  entity\r\n\r\nand  tap  their potential fully so as to become the  regional\r\n\r\nmedical hub we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naspire.   We  can  call upon the many private specialists  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  more.   They can return to  work  in  the  public\r\n\r\nhospitals  and  many of them can even go into research  work.\r\n\r\nWe  must  train  more  medical personnel  to  cater  for  the\r\n\r\nincreased  demands.   We  need  to  enhance  development   of\r\n\r\nclinical education and research.  These are but a few aspects\r\n\r\nthat  have  to be seen to quickly or we may lose the  cutting\r\n\r\nedge  we  have against our neighbouring countries  that  have\r\n\r\nstarted going in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the case against our becoming a medical hub\r\n\r\nwas  the fear that the healthcare costs will rise further for\r\n\r\nthe  locals and that the country could see another exodus  of\r\n\r\ntop  specialists  into the private sector.   Sir,  a  mindset\r\n\r\nchange is required here.  As a medical hub, we may not face a\r\n\r\nrise in healthcare costs for local patients.  This is because\r\n\r\nfull-paying foreign patients may even be a source of subsidy,\r\n\r\napart from giving spin-off effects for our other services  by\r\n\r\nhaving  more visitors to Singapore.  Moreover, we can  always\r\n\r\nhave  mechanisms put in place so as to limit  the  amount  of\r\n\r\npublic sector resources that can be used for foreign patients\r\n\r\nand to cause all doctors who want part of the foreign pie  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  some  of  their  time  in  treating   our   local\r\n\r\nsubsidised patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as long as quality and priority healthcare services\r\n\r\nare provided for in our public hospitals to Singaporeans,  as\r\n\r\nMr  Lee  said  earlier,  good basic  medical  care  for  all,\r\n\r\nprovision of healthcare services to foreigners should be seen\r\n\r\nas a new strategy for us to move to the next level in the new\r\n\r\neconomy.   A visiting Harvard don said that Singapore  has  a\r\n\r\nclear  edge  in  the consulting, engineering  and  healthcare\r\n\r\nindustries  in Asia.  Sir, he said that there are  tremendous\r\n\r\nneeds  in the region for healthcare services and the industry\r\n\r\ncan be much bigger than IT.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need for increased collaboration between\r\n\r\nprivate  hospitals and private entities to promote  Singapore\r\n\r\nas  a medical hub.  Under present circumstances, such schemes\r\n\r\nshould not be undertaken by the public hospitals as this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill   further  tax  their  resources  and  may  also   cause\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  in  perceived  differential  treatment   to\r\n\r\npatients.   Promoting  its  services  overseas  can  be  done\r\n\r\nthrough  and  with  the  Singapore  Tourism  Board  and  tour\r\n\r\nagencies with innovations that combine healthcare services as\r\n\r\npart  of  tourism  promotion.  Having packages  in  insurance\r\n\r\nproducts  that can be sold in the region resulting in  people\r\n\r\ncoming  to  Singapore for medical check-ups  every  year  and\r\n\r\nhaving  their  travel,  hotel and even shopping  needs  being\r\n\r\nlooked  after  as  well.   The spin-off  effect  of  being  a\r\n\r\nregional medical hub will be big for other services, such  as\r\n\r\nhotel, retail, convention industries and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this new economy, Singapore must reinvent itself\r\n\r\nto  achieve  greater  success in the  future  and  the  above\r\n\r\nconsiderations should be part of this process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise in support of Mrs Lim Hwee Hua's motion of thanks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coincidentally, there are four medical doctors,\r\n\r\nincluding  myself, speaking today.  Allow me  to  present  my\r\n\r\ndiagnosis of what ails the ground.  It is however by no means\r\n\r\na  contradictory  second opinion from  my  previously  spoken\r\n\r\nmedical colleagues.  It will be difficult to speak after  DPM\r\n\r\nLee, as he has addressed many of my concerns that I would  be\r\n\r\nlisting.   Nevertheless, Mr Speaker, Sir, let me  deliver  my\r\n\r\nconcerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President, in his Speech at the Opening of the Tenth\r\n\r\nParliament, has charged this House with the responsibility of\r\n\r\nseeing  Singapore through severe challenges.  The President's\r\n\r\nSpeech  struck  in me a disturbing thought.  I  realise  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  of my generation have grown up with  the  world\r\n\r\nview  that  if we work hard and gain good qualifications,  we\r\n\r\nwill be guaranteed a secure future.  We took for granted that\r\n\r\nSingapore  will continue to enjoy rapid growth, while  issues\r\n\r\nof racial and religious harmony\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere never in our conscience.  But things have changed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two recessions in the last five years have shown us that\r\n\r\ngood  qualifications, extensive experience and hard  work  do\r\n\r\nnot  guarantee continued employment.  The new reality is that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  plugged  into the global  economy.   A  ripple\r\n\r\nelsewhere can turn into a tidal wave for us.  In the past, we\r\n\r\ncould  ride  out these waves because our ship  of  state  was\r\n\r\nbetter  equipped, our people better trained and, while others\r\n\r\nfloundered,  we   sailed through.  But  now  everyone  has  a\r\n\r\ncomparable  ship  of  state.  Everyone is  investing  in  and\r\n\r\nupgrading  their human capital.  Everyone is  vying  for  the\r\n\r\nsame talents which today, more than ever, is globally mobile.\r\n\r\nI  shall now stop this maritime simile in case the House  may\r\n\r\nthink that I am all at sea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are indeed very severe challenges facing\r\n\r\nSingapore.   We  are in the midst of an unprecedented  storm.\r\n\r\nUnemployment has reached a high of 5%, and this situation  is\r\n\r\nlikely  to  get worse before it does get any better.   Hence,\r\n\r\nthe resounding victory of the last General Election is by  no\r\n\r\nmeans   an  absolute  support  for  all  the  PAP  Government\r\n\r\npolicies.    In  fact,  there  is  some  disquiet   that   is\r\n\r\nreverberating  across  Singapore over  some  issues,  causing\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to think whether they are second class citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to just highlight briefly some of these issues.\r\n\r\nAt  the  meet-the-people sessions, the  number  of  financial\r\n\r\nassistance  cases, as a result of job losses,  has  increased\r\n\r\nmanifold.  It is heart wrenching to see a grown up man of  50\r\n\r\nyears  old  asking for help to pay his son's school  fees  of\r\n\r\nabout  $300, amidst the fact that he has mounting rental  and\r\n\r\nutilities arrears.  Here is a hale and hearty man asking  for\r\n\r\nhelp  because he is jobless.  What more the numerous  elderly\r\n\r\ncitizens  out  there in the society?  Here is a  man  who  is\r\n\r\nantithesis  to our perennial fear of Singapore lapsing into a\r\n\r\nwelfare  state if we give handouts.  He wants  to  work,  yet\r\n\r\ncannot  find one, maybe through no fault of his, and  he  and\r\n\r\nhis family suffer for it.  This is a common sight at the meet-the-people sessions, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  am  sure  it  is  also  a common sight  with  many  of  my\r\n\r\nparliamentary colleagues in their meet-the-people sessions as\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we might therefore need to review our many-helping-hands policy towards the needy. The current economic crisis\r\n\r\naffects  almost  every  layer  of  Singapore.   It   is   not\r\n\r\ndiscriminative.  Presently, the State intervenes  only  after\r\n\r\nexhausting the needy person's immediate next-of-kin, ie,  his\r\n\r\nsiblings and the extended family.  Many themselves are facing\r\n\r\ncritical  difficulties  in  times  like  this.   I  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to consider how we may increase our assistance  to\r\n\r\nthe needy, which need not lapse into welfarism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, there is no denying that foreign talents have\r\n\r\ncontributed to Singapore.  However, what we have gained  from\r\n\r\nthe  new foreign talents, we have lost many of our own  local\r\n\r\ntalents  who  have  migrated overseas in  search  of  greener\r\n\r\npastures.  I am however apprehensive to the long-term effects\r\n\r\nto Singapore of the loss of Singapore's sons overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not saying chase out the foreigners. Rather,\r\n\r\nwhile we have the added contributions of foreign talents, are\r\n\r\nwe doing enough to prevent a local brain drain?  Are we doing\r\n\r\nenough to boost the morale of local talent  and prevent  them\r\n\r\nfrom slipping into thinking that they are not wanted and they\r\n\r\nare  second  class talents?  Are we doing enough to  increase\r\n\r\nthe  competitiveness of Singaporeans in the global employment\r\n\r\nmarket  now  that we are very much plugged into  the  world's\r\n\r\nsystem?   Singapore's  youths suffer in the  competition  for\r\n\r\nemployment  opportunities, since they spend two  and  a  half\r\n\r\nyears of the prime of their life serving the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the thousands who are unemployed, schemes to reduce\r\n\r\ntaxes and to upgrade the infrastructure merely add insult  to\r\n\r\ntheir  injury.  Of what benefit are lower taxes if  one  does\r\n\r\nnot  even  earn  an income?  Of what use is  a  spanking  new\r\n\r\nairport  if going on holiday is but a distant dream?  Arrears\r\n\r\nin  utilities  charges, rental payments,  traffic  fines  and\r\n\r\nunable to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice  the financial obligations are definitely  increasing\r\n\r\nin  numbers.   I  wonder what is happening to  our  Singapore\r\n\r\ndream.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the Government's response to the critical\r\n\r\nstructural unemployment has been for retrenched workers to go\r\n\r\nfor training and further retraining.  There are also a number\r\n\r\nand  variety  of  training  schemes  in  place  offering  job\r\n\r\nmatching, services to the unemployed and financial grants  to\r\n\r\nthose  who are especially needy.  But to the majority of  the\r\n\r\n108,000 unemployed and, to me, these are efforts to build our\r\n\r\nhardware and not our \"heartware\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To build heartware, we must tackle the issues at the\r\n\r\nfundamental level.  We must ask ourselves what we can  do  to\r\n\r\nserve  those  who  are  particularly vulnerable  to  economic\r\n\r\ndownturns.  For instance, it is an often-heard comment of the\r\n\r\nunemployed middle age, \"what is the use of retraining when we\r\n\r\nknow that after going through it, I am still unable to find a\r\n\r\njob?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unemployment problem has become more complex. The\r\n\r\njobless  bug has bitten not only the older workers  but  also\r\n\r\nthe  younger  tertiary  educated  as  well.   Our  young  and\r\n\r\ntertiary educated are now facing greater challenges from  all\r\n\r\nover  the  world.  They are however handicapped  by  national\r\n\r\nservice as well as financial obligations upon graduation.  It\r\n\r\nis  tantamount to our S-League footballers in their late  20s\r\n\r\nfacing  younger  and faster players, such as  David  Beckham,\r\n\r\nRonaldo and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also address the needs of those who are\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged.   For  example, a recurrent  theme  among  the\r\n\r\nunemployed  has  been  that the older  workers  face  greater\r\n\r\nhurdles  in  re-entering the job market.  Companies  tend  to\r\n\r\ndiscriminate against such workers for a variety  of  reasons,\r\n\r\nand   if  age  can  be  a  handicap,  what  more  a  physical\r\n\r\ndisability.  We have to ask ourselves if what we are building\r\n\r\nis a Singapore that is home only to the hale and hearty, that\r\n\r\nour  hospitals  offering world-class medical treatment  cater\r\n\r\nonly to rich foreigners.  Obviously\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot.   The  point  I  want to make is  that  our  competitive\r\n\r\nadvantages  can  no longer come from mere  hardware.   World-class   infrastructure,  competitive  tax  structures,  well-trained  workers  can and will, over time, be  replicated  by\r\n\r\nothers.   Where Singapore must distinguish itself is  in  its\r\n\r\nheartware.   By  this, I mean a spirit among Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\npull  together  to overcome adversity, to feel an  unshakable\r\n\r\nsense  of  belonging  to Singapore.  I  admit  that  this  is\r\n\r\ndefinitely easier said than done.  Some may argue that such a\r\n\r\nprocess,  which  we  could call nation  building,  cannot  be\r\n\r\nengineered.  But such argument goes against the very grain of\r\n\r\nwhat  Singapore stands for.  It is through the sheer will  of\r\n\r\nour  founding leaders and their colleagues that we are on our\r\n\r\nway to nationhood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on and turn to the theme of providing support\r\n\r\nto  our  elderly  and our infirm.  Developing heartware  also\r\n\r\ninvolves  recognising the contributions of our  elderly.   We\r\n\r\nmust   also  embrace  those  who  are  disadvantaged  through\r\n\r\nphysical or mental disabilities, and we must not develop into\r\n\r\na  society  that  nurtures  its people  only  when  they  are\r\n\r\nproductive, and to cast them aside when they can no longer do\r\n\r\nso.   We must show Singaporeans that they are not like  curry\r\n\r\nleaves,  discarded  after the curry is made.   What  we  must\r\n\r\nremember is that Singapore is built on the sweat and toils of\r\n\r\nour  elders, and this is an obvious point but one that merits\r\n\r\nreiterating.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another obvious point is that the proportion of the\r\n\r\nelderly in Singapore will continue to increase, and hence the\r\n\r\nneed  for  step-down care services.  Sir, let me  declare  my\r\n\r\ninterest  at this point of time, as I am the Medical Director\r\n\r\nof  a  local VWO that offers step-down care services.   Step-down  care  refers to services that are offered  to  patients\r\n\r\nafter  they are discharged from hospitals, and such  services\r\n\r\nare   important  because  they  serve  two  major  functions.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  they allow patients to be discharged from hospitals\r\n\r\nfaster,  thereby  relieving the pressure  on  hospitals  that\r\n\r\nconstantly face shortages of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhospital  beds,  and also thereby reducing the  cost  to  the\r\n\r\npatients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, a patient who is discharged from hospital\r\n\r\ncannot be considered to have fully recovered.  A good example\r\n\r\nwould  be a stroke patient.  He or she might not be  able  to\r\n\r\nfeed  himself, bathe or walk independently.  Thus,  step-down\r\n\r\ncare services are needed to nurse these patients back to  the\r\n\r\nbest  possible  condition.  This  is  a  step  in  the  right\r\n\r\ndirection  for  our healthcare industry, and the  net  result\r\n\r\nwould  be  a  healthcare cost that is at a manageable  level,\r\n\r\nwhile   the  level  of  service  post-hospitalisation   would\r\n\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, we have a good range of nursing homes and\r\n\r\nrehabilitative  day care centres.  However, what  is  lacking\r\n\r\nare  home  care  services, especially home medical  and  home\r\n\r\nphysiotherapy.  Through Government's healthcare policies, the\r\n\r\nmajority  of these services are offered by voluntary  welfare\r\n\r\norganisations.   By and large, the VWOs are  doing  exemplary\r\n\r\nwork,  but there is still room for improvement.  We  have  to\r\n\r\nfind   a   way   to  raise  the  standard    and   level   of\r\n\r\nprofessionalism among the VWOs and, at the same time, seek to\r\n\r\nidentify those that can serve as role models for others.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment   must  develop  and  support  more  organisations\r\n\r\noffering  such  services to our elderly, and also  constantly\r\n\r\naudit the standard of their services.  It is no doubt a  step\r\n\r\nin the right direction for the Government to devolve the step-down   services   to   professional   VWOs.    However,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's role in providing overall healthcare  cannot  be\r\n\r\ndiminished as a result.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many professional VWOs are left to the vagaries of the\r\n\r\nfree  market system, thereby having to compete against market\r\n\r\nforces  in maintaining their cost.  They struggle to  balance\r\n\r\ntheir  books  and, consequently, sometimes have to  sacrifice\r\n\r\nservices for cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the not too distant future, the demand for step-down care services would proliferate in leaps and bounds,\r\n\r\nincluding many of us in the House.  Surely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere is a role for the Government to ensure the adequacy  of\r\n\r\nsuch  services and the quality expected of does not diminish.\r\n\r\nAgain,  failing to do so would send the wrong signals to  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  citizenry.  I am happy to note  that  Mayor  Teo  Ho\r\n\r\nPin's  CDC  has  launched a scheme to ensure  that  step-down\r\n\r\nservices  are available to the non-ambulant patients  in  his\r\n\r\nCDC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, the tasks that face us are no less\r\n\r\nmonumental.    Though  monumental,  the  challenge   is   not\r\n\r\ninsurmountable.   We must use this opportunity  to  put  into\r\n\r\nplace  initiatives which will instead root Singaporeans  more\r\n\r\nfirmly  in our nation, and establish a society which is  able\r\n\r\nto   withstand   adversity,  because  we   have   world-class\r\n\r\nheartware.   Even  as the Economic Review Committee  and  the\r\n\r\nCommittee on Remaking Singapore proceed with their  work,  it\r\n\r\nis incumbent on Members of this House to drive home the point\r\n\r\nthat all our work must centre around the average Singaporean.\r\n\r\nMore  importantly, while we proceed to remake  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nreview the measures needed, we need to continuously strive to\r\n\r\nwin  the  hearts  and minds of the people.  This  is  an  old\r\n\r\ntheme.  Lest I be accused of a young person sounding like  an\r\n\r\nold  record, this is the theme that has universal importance,\r\n\r\nand it cannot be over emphasised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to speak in support of the motion by Mrs Lim Hwee Hua to\r\n\r\nthank the President for his Address to this Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Change</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Change', Mr Speaker, Sir, is the buzzword today. In\r\n\r\nfact, throughout history, change is the only constant.  It is\r\n\r\nthe only way by which our body renews and rejuvenates itself,\r\n\r\nour  mind  keeps pace with the dynamo of the  world.   Change\r\n\r\nchanges life and change will not change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is confusing, that is indeed how many people\r\n\r\nreact  to change.  Confusion, uncertainties, pain and  a  new\r\n\r\nworld order,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  not  all  can understand or keep pace  with,  are  the\r\n\r\nproducts of change.  As a sociology student, I used to sit by\r\n\r\nOrchard  Road and watched the world go by.  I used to observe\r\n\r\nhow   people   react  towards  unanticipated  events.    When\r\n\r\nsomething happened, some shrugged their shoulders and  walked\r\n\r\naway,  some  screamed  and got angry, and  some  launched  an\r\n\r\ninvestigation to see if there was an opportunity to reap.   I\r\n\r\nrealise  that for every action, and that includes non-action,\r\n\r\nthere is a reaction, there is a consequence.  Therefore,  how\r\n\r\nwe  react  to the changes around us today will determine  our\r\n\r\nsocial, economic and political destiny.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, my question, Sir, is how are we responding to the\r\n\r\nchanges  today?  Do we respond as a victim of change, thereby\r\n\r\nfeeling helpless, willy-nilly?  Or do we respond as a  critic\r\n\r\nof change, thereby generating negative energy?  Do we respond\r\n\r\nas  a bystander, awaiting for all to move before hopping onto\r\n\r\nthe  bandwagon?  Or do we respond to change as  a  navigator,\r\n\r\nseeking  to  lead and reap, and write our own  story?   Every\r\n\r\ngeneration  has a story.  What is the story for  our  current\r\n\r\nand future generation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a national level, I am thankful that we have a\r\n\r\n`navigator' Government that chooses to grab the bull  by  its\r\n\r\nhorns  and  ride  on  the  waves of change.   Our  Government\r\n\r\nrealises  that  we need to constantly check on ourselves  and\r\n\r\nstay  relevant to the dynamos of the world.  We are  at  this\r\n\r\nmilestone check now, and we have promised to `leave no  stone\r\n\r\nunturned'.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Personal response and choices</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an individual level, however, the picture is less\r\n\r\nclear.   My  question here is:  Are we aware, as individuals,\r\n\r\nthat  we  do have a choice?  Earlier on, the hon. Member,  Dr\r\n\r\nVivian Balakrishnan, stated that his junior asked him why  he\r\n\r\nshould  be  fighting for Singapore and dying  for  Singapore.\r\n\r\nAnd  the hon. Member, Dr Wang Kai Yuen, asked him whether  it\r\n\r\nwas  a  result  of our education or social system  or  family\r\n\r\nupbringing.  I suppose my question is:  Is it because we have\r\n\r\nbeen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  caught up with our own work, at our individual, adult  or\r\n\r\nparent level, that we have not spent enough time to inculcate\r\n\r\nsome  of these values, such as emotional rootedness, that  Dr\r\n\r\nVivian  spoke about, in our children?  It appears  that  more\r\n\r\nthan  40  years  of  prosperity have bred  a  new  cohort  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who have not made a habit of making up their own\r\n\r\nminds   and  whipping  up  enough  courage  to  pursue  their\r\n\r\npassions.  There is no denial that many of us would prefer to\r\n\r\nhit the well-beaten path.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could it be that some of us still live in the shadows of\r\n\r\nthe  1960s' state of emergency?  Or could it be that we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  running so relentlessly up the economic ladder, sparing\r\n\r\nlittle  time to pause, reflect and dwell deeper into what  we\r\n\r\nreally  want or what we are really about?  Or is it  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  Government that cares, and cares so  much,  that  we\r\n\r\noften  look to our Government for all directions and  answers\r\n\r\nto  our  life  -  from economic means to  business  ideas  to\r\n\r\npersonal  life  choices?  Obviously, I have not  heeded  that\r\n\r\ncall yet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was once said that when the US sneezes,\r\n\r\nSingapore  catches pneumonia.  Similarly, when our Government\r\n\r\nopens  a  door, many people rush in there without questioning\r\n\r\nwhy.   Obviously, when something goes wrong,  the  Government\r\n\r\ngets  the  blame.  Sometimes, the Government also  gets  away\r\n\r\nwith it, because there simply does not seem to be another way\r\n\r\nout.   Many of us are in our comfort zones, and some  perhaps\r\n\r\ndo  not see or even want a way out.  I cannot agree more with\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member  Koo Tsai Kee who said that  as  we  become\r\n\r\nricher,  we become more kiasu, or scared to lose.   I  myself\r\n\r\nwas in that trap before.  Years ago, I sold my car and was in\r\n\r\nthe  midst of shopping for a bigger and better car.   When  a\r\n\r\nfriend  asked me out, I told her that I could not  because  I\r\n\r\nhad no car.  She screamed and said:  \"You have no car but you\r\n\r\nhave  `kahs',  meaning my legs.  So what  is  your  problem?\"\r\n\r\nSir,  I was awakened.  I realised that years ago when  all  I\r\n\r\nhad was a backpack on my back, I was mobile and dexterous.  I\r\n\r\ncould go anywhere I wanted, to pursue my dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot  kiasu, not kiasi.  As I accumulate some wealth, I became\r\n\r\nhesitant  and cautious, thereby suffering from paralysis  via\r\n\r\nanalysis.  What an irony!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, but I realise I am not alone in my predicament. I\r\n\r\nhave  come across many people at the meet-the-people  session\r\n\r\nwho  are  handicapped by their material trappings,  and  they\r\n\r\ncould not harness new horizons as a result.  We know of  many\r\n\r\nretrenched workers who place more importance on job types and\r\n\r\njob distances, even in the face of mounting debts.  Many will\r\n\r\nrather  wait  for  the  right job  and  apply  for  financial\r\n\r\nassistance  meanwhile.  Sir, the Government can  only  do  so\r\n\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>People and Government</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Jack Neo's recent production `I Not Stupid', which\r\n\r\nhas  been mentioned many times in this Parliament, there  was\r\n\r\nthis  mother  who had so over-provided for the well-being  of\r\n\r\nher child, that the child did not even know how to butter his\r\n\r\nown  bread.  What will happen when mummy is no longer  around\r\n\r\nor as able?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to put our citizens in the driver seat. Not one\r\n\r\nperson, not a small group of people, but all Singaporeans  at\r\n\r\nlarge.   We  must  get our people to say `what  I  can  do?',\r\n\r\nrather  than `what can the Government do?'  In our  quest  to\r\n\r\nremake   Singapore,   let  us  focus   on   encouraging   and\r\n\r\nfacilitating  our  people to think and  work  for  what  they\r\n\r\nbelieve  in, rather than provide all the answers.   Let  each\r\n\r\none  take  ownership of his destiny, and switch gear  from  a\r\n\r\nreactive  to a proactive mode.  We must switch gear,  from  a\r\n\r\ngovernment-centric approach to a people-centric approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not advocating the abdication of the Government's\r\n\r\nrole or responsibility.  That just cannot be the case.  I  am\r\n\r\nadvocating  shared responsibility for a common destiny.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  be  after all, by the  people,  from  the\r\n\r\npeople  and for the people.  For what is a government without\r\n\r\npopular  support?  In Karl Marx's theory about the  bourgeois\r\n\r\nand proletariat, polarisation will lead to a revolution.   We\r\n\r\nare  far  from that but we must be mindful of any  divide  or\r\n\r\ngap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Needed space</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bridging will certainly mean more risks and take more\r\n\r\nspace.   However,  this  is  the necessary  space  needed  to\r\n\r\ngerminate  a  self-conscious society,  the  space  needed  to\r\n\r\nencourage   an   enterprising  population,   the   space   to\r\n\r\nexperiment,  fall and rejuvenate.  Rome was not  built  in  a\r\n\r\nday, we must be patient and tolerant.  However, we do need to\r\n\r\naccelerate our learning curve in Internet time, in real time,\r\n\r\nand for the sceptical ones, for real this time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Core value system as anchor</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So where do we start? I suggest we start with the\r\n\r\nbasics, with the fundamentals.  There was a time where  quick\r\n\r\nfixes  and get-rich-quick dot-com companies ruled the market.\r\n\r\nThat  did not last very long.  When the Internet bubble burst\r\n\r\nand  the  dot-coms became dot `cons' and dot  `gones',  value\r\n\r\nstocks   and   fundamentally  strong   companies   prevailed.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, let us invest in our own value system.  It is only\r\n\r\nwhen  we  know what we are about, then can we battle external\r\n\r\npressures.   Sun Tze once said: Zhi bi zhi ji, bai  zhan  bai\r\n\r\nsheng (    ,     ).  Translated literally, it means \"Know thy\r\n\r\nenemy,  know thyself, hundred battles fought, hundred battles\r\n\r\nwon.\"  To a certain extent, we are only what we think, so let\r\n\r\nus  jointly  identify and strengthen our shared core  values,\r\n\r\nlet it permeate the different strata of our society, not just\r\n\r\nvia  talk,  but  via  conscious efforts to externalise  these\r\n\r\nvalues in our daily activities.  In other words, let us  walk\r\n\r\nour talk.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Adjust responses to harness opportunities</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we know what we stand for, then let us adjust our\r\n\r\nreactions  to change.  We are in a challenging  time  and  we\r\n\r\nhave  crisis  to surmount.  The Chinese term  for  crisis  is\r\n\r\nweiji (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). Weiji means weixian de shi hou, bi you jihui\r\n\r\n(     ,       ).    It   implies  that   there   are   always\r\n\r\nopportunities amidst adversity.  After all, good value  cheap\r\n\r\nsales  surface only in hard times.  Hence, if we  can  change\r\n\r\nour collective dominant thought from that of facing adversity\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinding opportunities, then the net result must be better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to break through glass ceilings and expand our\r\n\r\nmental  box.   As  water has no fixed form, survival  has  no\r\n\r\nfixed   rules.    In  the  industrial  age,  a   hardworking,\r\n\r\nexperienced  and  highly-educated person is almost  made  for\r\n\r\nlife.   In the information age, experience and age can become\r\n\r\nliabilities, not assets, if we choose not to respond positive\r\n\r\nto  changes.   Many  people will become contract  workers  or\r\n\r\nfreelance consultants in this era.  This change will not only\r\n\r\naffect jobs and careers; it affects the entire lifestyle.  We\r\n\r\nneed to take stock of where we are now, and where we want  to\r\n\r\ngo,   in   order   to   harness  the  regional   and   global\r\n\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Stock take: Government ok, people?</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to taking stock, I think the Government\r\n\r\nhas been prudent in its spending and some say, aggressive  in\r\n\r\nits investments and earnings, and therefore we have built  up\r\n\r\nenough  resources  to tackle the challenges  and  to  harness\r\n\r\nopportunities.   However, the same  cannot  be  said  at  the\r\n\r\nindividual  level.  Many residents came to me  with  numerous\r\n\r\nbills  unpaid  and little resources to last.  Many  of  these\r\n\r\nbills  relate  to  lifestyle  expenses.   I  am  very,   very\r\n\r\nconcerned.  Here, again, I refer to the value system  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.  Does more mean better?  \"Money no enough!\" - that is\r\n\r\nthe  common outcry of many Singaporeans.  The truth is, money\r\n\r\nis  never  going  to be enough as long as we are  buying  the\r\n\r\nlatest  hi-fi,  upgrading, having posh  furniture,  and  keep\r\n\r\npaying  them in instalments.  Are we heading towards becoming\r\n\r\na  society  of consumerism and debt?   The latest  report  in\r\n\r\n2001  showed  a  28% increase in credit card  debts  and  19%\r\n\r\nincrease  in personal, not business, bankruptcy.  This  could\r\n\r\nbe   conveniently  attributed  to  the  recession,  but   the\r\n\r\nunderlying  cause  is  largely  spending  on  credit.    With\r\n\r\nanticipated slowdown in wage increment, we must not develop a\r\n\r\nnew generation of big spenders with huge debts and be trapped\r\n\r\nin  the obsessive pursuit of the 5 `Cs'.  Do we want to  hold\r\n\r\nour future generation hostage to debts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncreated  today?  The answer must be `no'.  Spending  of  what\r\n\r\none  earns is not wrong, but spending beyond one's means runs\r\n\r\ncontrary  to the basic economic formula of save,  invest  and\r\n\r\naccumulate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realise that for some people, poverty is a stark\r\n\r\nreality.   For others, it could just be a state of  mind.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask, is it the high cost of living, or the cost\r\n\r\nof  high  living, that leaves us breathless?  I  believe  the\r\n\r\nanswer  lies somewhere between the two ends.  Perhaps instead\r\n\r\nof  working non-stop to acquire more and more, we  could  re-evaluate our financial objectives, lest we end up chasing our\r\n\r\nown  tail.   While we work hard to make money, we could  also\r\n\r\nlearn  to make money work harder for us.  A particular credit\r\n\r\ncard  company  urges us not to `leave home without   it'.   I\r\n\r\nsay,  if you cannot resist temptations, you better leave home\r\n\r\nwithout it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good financial discipline and the attitude towards money\r\n\r\ncan  be  nurtured  from young.  Young children  should  learn\r\n\r\nabout  the  importance  of savings.  Older  students  can  be\r\n\r\nencouraged  to operate school cooperatives, thereby  incubate\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  who will learn about the value  of  money  and\r\n\r\nfinancial  management.  With social and domestic sciences  in\r\n\r\nour  academic  curriculum, perhaps  it  is  time  for  us  to\r\n\r\nconsider  including  financial  science  as  well.   We   can\r\n\r\nincrease FQ, or financial quotient, this way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adults, parents and retirees too can benefit from such\r\n\r\nknowledge  and  proper understanding of  money  attitude  and\r\n\r\ntools.   Yesterday, the hon. Member Mr Lim Boon Heng wondered\r\n\r\naloud  if  there is a way to reconcile the lack of retirement\r\n\r\nfunds  with  perhaps  too  much  housing.   May  I  offer  my\r\n\r\nobservation.   Our CPF savings for the ordinary  folks  is  a\r\n\r\npowerful   retirement  tool,  but  only  if  it  is  properly\r\n\r\nunderstood and utilised.  To illustrate using the Census 2001\r\n\r\nreport  of  an average household income of $4,943 per  month,\r\n\r\nand assuming an average household works for 30 years of their\r\n\r\nlife, they would potentially be able to accumulate a combined\r\n\r\nCPF savings of $1.037 million,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbased  on an average compound interest rate of 3% per  annum.\r\n\r\nIn   other  words,  the  average  Singaporean  household   is\r\n\r\npotentially a millionaire household.  If only people  realise\r\n\r\nthis  and  moderate their demand for a nice roof  with  their\r\n\r\nneed for a nice retirement nest-egg, retirement funding would\r\n\r\nbecome more achievable.  The problem here is, Sir, that  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  do  not  perceive their CPF  savings  as  their\r\n\r\nretirement nest-egg.  What they perceive their CPF savings is\r\n\r\nmoney  stuck in the Government's coffer.  As such, they  will\r\n\r\nseek  all ways to withdraw it.  Housing withdrawals  have  no\r\n\r\ncap,  and  is perceived as a status symbol, and  a  means  to\r\n\r\nrelease  their  funds from CPF.  I agree  with  Mr  Lim  that\r\n\r\ntaking  a  huge  mortgage loan in one's 50s when  one  cannot\r\n\r\nafford it is disastrous.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have designed a world-class retirement system,\r\n\r\nthe CPF system.  It is now time for us to go one step further\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that our people fully understand its prowess  and\r\n\r\nutilise it accordingly.  While the CPF liberalisation is much\r\n\r\nwelcomed,   systematic  education  is   needed   to   prevent\r\n\r\nunsystematic leakages.  May I suggest that the CPF Board  and\r\n\r\nHDB  look into the possibility of playing a much bigger  role\r\n\r\nin advising Singaporeans in their finances?  It may sound out\r\n\r\nof this world, but I know and I understand that these are not\r\n\r\ntraditional roles, but perhaps we can think out  of  the  box\r\n\r\nand either build or outsource some of these services to start\r\n\r\na  financial  counselling process for very major purchases  - much  like that of marriage counselling.  The emphasis should\r\n\r\nbe  on the attitudes and habits around money, rather than  on\r\n\r\ntechnical calculations, as is being done today.  Certainly, a\r\n\r\nfinancially savvy population will save us from the  need  for\r\n\r\nmore financial hand-outs and more taxes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am under no illusion that financial literacy\r\n\r\nwould  eliminate  all  financial hardships.   I  believe  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has a social obligation to help the less able  and\r\n\r\nless  fortunate.  I join the calls of my colleagues  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  to  seek ways to lower the cost of basic  necessities,\r\n\r\nlike  public  transport, healthcare and  utilities.   In  the\r\n\r\nSengkang part of Punggol North\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndivision,  where  void  deck  coffeeshops  are  replaced   by\r\n\r\nairconditioned food courts and neighbourhood centres come  in\r\n\r\nthe  form  of an airconditioned mall, my residents  not  only\r\n\r\nmiss  the  hawker centres there with a heavy heart, but  also\r\n\r\nwith  a  very affected pocket.  The cost of living has indeed\r\n\r\nshot up.  This problem is compounded where there are job loss\r\n\r\nand wage cuts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another group that has caught my attention\r\n\r\nlately.   This is the `asset so-so, but cash poor'  group  of\r\n\r\npeople  that  is sandwiched between the haves and  the  have-nots.   These  are  citizens  who are  faced  with  financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties, despite owning a roof.  They have paid so  much\r\n\r\nfor  their  property that little is left to see them  through\r\n\r\ntheir  silver days.  In 20 to 30 years' time, some  of  these\r\n\r\nproperties  would have only 60 years or less of  lease.   The\r\n\r\ncurrent  legislation makes it difficult  to  borrow  on  such\r\n\r\nproperty,  especially  if  it  is  HDB  property.   Can  they\r\n\r\ndowngrade?  It is easier said than done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could we then look into the needs of this group of\r\n\r\npeople by revisiting the legislation, and perhaps under  very\r\n\r\nstringent   conditions,   based  on  compassionate   grounds,\r\n\r\nconsider acting as a lender of last resort?  I know  DPM  has\r\n\r\njust said that the Government cannot be a last resort of  any\r\n\r\nkind.   While I concede that that is true and we have  to  be\r\n\r\nvery careful, if it is undesirable, then can we explore other\r\n\r\noptions?  For example, relook at the mortgage policy for this\r\n\r\ngroup  of  people so that they may use their  last  available\r\n\r\nassets to ease their retirement years.  The problem is  there\r\n\r\nand  more will be affected as time passes.  We need to tackle\r\n\r\nthese issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a Government that has continuously shown\r\n\r\nits  wits and tenacity - ensuring Singapore remains a premier\r\n\r\nbusiness  hub.   We  do not ask \"Who moved my  cheese?\",  but\r\n\r\nproactively  look for new cheese and create new  cheese.   We\r\n\r\nhave  a  Government  with great financial  wisdom,  one  that\r\n\r\nadopts a policy of building up and protecting our reserves so\r\n\r\nthat  we  can  seize the opportunities to become  bigger  and\r\n\r\nstronger.  Our Government has made\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  conscious choice to do so.  What about our people?  We now\r\n\r\nneed  to  foster this culture in our people so that they  too\r\n\r\ncan  one day lead the dance with our Government, at the world\r\n\r\nstage,  to the same tune.  Let us provide the space  so  that\r\n\r\nour  youths,  our people, can grow.  To quote an  old  adage,\r\n\r\n`Give  a child a fish, you feed him for a day.  Teach a child\r\n\r\nto  fish,  you feed him for life.'  It is therefore  my  hope\r\n\r\nthat  we  - the people, the public and the private sectors  - can  establish mutual trust and cooperation, not just to ease\r\n\r\nthe  possible pains of change, but to also embrace the  winds\r\n\r\nof  change.  Not just as `you', not just as `I', but as `we'.\r\n\r\nUnited we stand, divided we fall.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wholeheartedly support\r\n\r\nthe motion to thank the President.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> I rise on a point of\r\n\r\nclarification since my son's conversation has been a  subject\r\n\r\nof  much  interest.  We ended our conversation  with  my  son\r\n\r\nsaying, \"Yes, he would defend Singapore because this  is  his\r\n\r\nhome,  his  family and his friends are here.\"  One additional\r\n\r\nstatement  which  was a bit odd when I first  heard  him,  he\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"And  if Mr Nathan treats me well.\"  I think  what  he\r\n\r\nactually  means is that if the Government treats him  fairly.\r\n\r\nBut  really the more important point behind all this  that  I\r\n\r\nwanted  to  make was that it is important for each generation\r\n\r\nto ask themselves the fundamental questions of nationhood and\r\n\r\ntransmit that to their children.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I rise to support the motion moved by Mrs Lim Hwee Hua,\r\n\r\nMember for Marine Parade GRC, in expressing our thanks to the\r\n\r\nPresident for his Address at the Opening of this Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing speeches after speeches for the last three\r\n\r\ndays on how we can tinker with our economy and how costs  can\r\n\r\nbe  reduced  in  the remaking of Singapore, let  me  try  and\r\n\r\nattempt  to  look  at these areas from a different  angle  by\r\n\r\nreferring  to some examples and to learn from them  important\r\n\r\nvalues that can be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfound  in  these events.  The general tone of the President's\r\n\r\nAddress  is that we must be ready to face hard times  and  be\r\n\r\nvigilant  in the face of tougher competition and  to  protect\r\n\r\nour people from the unexpected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us must strive to achieve this and few could\r\n\r\ndispute  the  underlying  tone  of  the  Government  in   its\r\n\r\ncontinuing  goal of creating jobs and a safer  life  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore.  This is going to be a great challenge\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government and the people as the present  uncertain\r\n\r\neconomic  environment has led many industries  to  experience\r\n\r\nvarying  fortunes.  Only 1,600 new jobs were created  in  the\r\n\r\nyear 2001, compared to 108,500 in the year 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been encouraging businesses to expand\r\n\r\nbeyond our shores and has seen new technology, especially  e-business   and   the  dot.com  bubble  and  trading   partner\r\n\r\neconomies,   such   as  Japan,  Korea,  Thailand,   Malaysia,\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and  even  the  US, going  from  high  to  low  in\r\n\r\nunpredictable  ways.   We  have seen some  spectacular  local\r\n\r\nbankruptcies and with the likelihood of more to come.   There\r\n\r\nhave  been  major mergers and acquisitions and the demise  of\r\n\r\nwell-known companies, such as the energy company,  Enron,  in\r\n\r\nthe  United  States,  Ansett Airlines in  Australia  and  the\r\n\r\nfalling-out  of  favour of telcos and almost anything  to  do\r\n\r\nwith e-business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest rates have never been so low among major\r\n\r\neconomies.  Yet, many businesses are so uncertain  about  the\r\n\r\nfuture  that they do not really want to borrow more  or  take\r\n\r\nany  more chances.  Businesses in Singapore however are going\r\n\r\nabout  their usual way of meeting the challenges to  maximise\r\n\r\nthe   chance   of  survival  and  prosperity  in   times   of\r\n\r\nuncertainty.    They  will  formulate  and   implement   risk\r\n\r\nmanagement   and  strategy  plans  that  focus  on   economic\r\n\r\nfundamentals,  competitiveness, cash flow, profitability  and\r\n\r\nthe  factors that drive these forward.  But it is not as easy\r\n\r\nas  it  sounds.  As it requires robust planning and execution\r\n\r\nof integrated plans, we borrowed lessons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlearned from past events.  There are no short cuts, no  magic\r\n\r\nwands.   It must surely require the support and will  of  the\r\n\r\npower  and  the  resourcefulness of our  Government  to  work\r\n\r\ntogether in close consultation to improve our economy so that\r\n\r\nbusinesses can thrive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When developing our country's economic blueprint for\r\n\r\nsurvival, I would support the Government's stand in  building\r\n\r\nstrongly  on  our cultural diversity and self-esteem  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  promote  an  awareness  to  organisations,  both\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  private, to prepare plans for contingencies.\r\n\r\nThe Government must continue to adopt a humane management  of\r\n\r\nits citizens and put its primary concern on the well-being of\r\n\r\nthose  people.  Their physical safety must be protected  from\r\n\r\nthe  expectable and their recovery from the unexpected should\r\n\r\nbe facilitated.  How we reinvent ourselves will determine our\r\n\r\ndestiny  as a strong and compassionate nation.  Do  it  right\r\n\r\nand  we  will  emerge stronger.  As my hon. colleague  Assoc.\r\n\r\nProf. Koo Tsai Kee said yesterday, we must have confidence in\r\n\r\novercoming our difficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at this point, please allow me to use\r\n\r\nsome  lessons  from  the business world  to  demonstrate  the\r\n\r\nresourcefulness of people in adapting to changes and  without\r\n\r\nlosing  their dignity and pride in the process.  Firstly,  in\r\n\r\ntransforming Singapore from the present economy to  one  that\r\n\r\nwill  be  economically stronger, we must be  careful  in  not\r\n\r\ndestroying its identity, such as its cultural diversity.   We\r\n\r\ncan  look  at the case of a business entity, such as  Nissan,\r\n\r\nwhich  was a struggling Japanese motor giant, and learn  from\r\n\r\nits   blueprint   for  survival.   Nissan   became   a   huge\r\n\r\nconglomerate  when  the  economic climate  was  conducive  to\r\n\r\nJapan.  But as high costs and the inability to recognise  its\r\n\r\nforce,  faults seeped in.  It struggled to turn a profit  for\r\n\r\neight   years   in   the  1990s.   Its  operation   generated\r\n\r\nnotoriously low margins and it was estimated that Nissan gave\r\n\r\naway US$1,000  for every car it sold in the United States due\r\n\r\nto  competition from better-known brands.  At the same  time,\r\n\r\nJapanese factories alone could produce\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalmost a million more cars a year than the company sold.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If nothing was done to turn the company around, Nissan\r\n\r\nwould  cease to exist.  Nissan had to make changes and, while\r\n\r\ndoing so, they have to protect the company's identity and the\r\n\r\nself-esteem  of its people.  These two goals, making  changes\r\n\r\nand  safeguarding  identity, can easily come  into  conflict.\r\n\r\nPursuing   them  both  entails  a  difficult  and   sometimes\r\n\r\nprecarious  balancing act.  Nissan managed them by mobilising\r\n\r\nits  own  executives in teams and, through a  set  of  cross-functional  teams,  identified and  spearheaded  the  radical\r\n\r\nchanges  that  had  to  be  made.  These  changes  that  were\r\n\r\nimplemented went against the grain of not only Nissan's long-standing  operating  practices  but  also  of  some  of   the\r\n\r\nbehavioral norms of Japanese society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, its major shareholder, Renault, which is a major\r\n\r\nFrench motor maker, remained sensitive to Nissan's culture at\r\n\r\nall  times,  allowing  the company  room  to  develop  a  new\r\n\r\ncorporate that built on the best elements of Japan's national\r\n\r\nculture.  Less than three years later, Nissan, at the turn of\r\n\r\nthe  century, is profitable again.  The robust turnaround  at\r\n\r\nNissan  shows  that  we have to respect the  dignity  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  even  as you challenge them to overturn  deep-seated\r\n\r\ntraditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Review Committee, set up early this year to\r\n\r\nreview our country's performance, is somewhat like the cross-functional  teams set up in Nissan, and will  be  Singapore's\r\n\r\nattempt in the right direction in reviving its economy.   And\r\n\r\nwe  were  told that no stones would be left unturned  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess.  But when deciding on the course of action to  take,\r\n\r\nthe  Government must remain sensitive to the varied  cultures\r\n\r\nof Singaporeans and their dignity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, before Singapore could recover from the\r\n\r\nslowing-down  effects  of the Asian crisis  that  drastically\r\n\r\nreduced  the  economic activities of regional countries,  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States of America, Singapore's main business  partner\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nterms  of  trade,  suffered an overnight  economic  breakdown\r\n\r\nafter the September 11th terrorist attack.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we have discovered that disaster has now\r\n\r\nbeen  redefined after 11th September 2001, and Singapore  has\r\n\r\nto  take  another look at its economic and social  continuity\r\n\r\nplans.   The importance of a continuity plan for the  country\r\n\r\ncan be learnt from the examples of two business organisations\r\n\r\ncaught  in  circumstances  beyond  their  imagination.    The\r\n\r\naccounting firm, Deloitte & Touche, already knew the value of\r\n\r\na plan when it was forced to evacuate its office at the World\r\n\r\nTrade  Centre in 1993 after a car bomb blew up the bottom  of\r\n\r\nthe building.  It took immediate steps to move into a smaller\r\n\r\ntarget  after  that.   Unfortunately, it  was  not  far  away\r\n\r\nenough, just across the street at Two World Financial Centre.\r\n\r\nThe  plan did not specifically direct 3,500 employees to drop\r\n\r\ntheir  briefcases and dash through a shower of debris,  smoke\r\n\r\nand  dust  as two huge buildings thundered down behind  them.\r\n\r\nBut,  as  the managing partners regrouped at a safe distance,\r\n\r\nthey  knew the plan called for them to head across the Hudson\r\n\r\nRiver to a branch office in New Jersey.  There, they took out\r\n\r\na  big,  nice red book, the firm's business continuity  plan.\r\n\r\nWith  that,  they  proceeded through an excruciating  3-stage\r\n\r\nprocess of contacting all employees, reconnecting them to the\r\n\r\nfirm and its clientele, and recovering the firm's position in\r\n\r\nthe marketplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Deloitte & Touche, the securities firm, Morgan\r\n\r\nStanley,  was  in the WTC in 1993.  Morgan Stanley,  however,\r\n\r\nstayed  in the building.  Some 2,700 worked between the  43rd\r\n\r\nand  74th floor of the South Tower.  All but six survived the\r\n\r\nattack.   The  company  survived  too.   Under  its  business\r\n\r\ncontinuity  plan, it has already determined  its  fundamental\r\n\r\nactivities and how to support them.  On the Monday after  the\r\n\r\nattack,  when  the stock markets opened, Morgan  Stanley  was\r\n\r\noffering business as usual.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to learn that the Government Ministries have a\r\n\r\ncontingency plan called\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNESTS, short for the National Emergency System, formed  under\r\n\r\nthe  auspices of the Ministry of Home Affairs, and  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  working closely with the  private  sector  to\r\n\r\nensure  that the nation's infrastructure will still function,\r\n\r\nshould a disaster strike.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me next to turn to medical care. It is\r\n\r\nheartening to note that in the Ministry of Health's  Addendum\r\n\r\nto the President's Address that healthcare facilities will be\r\n\r\nmade  closer to Singaporeans with the development of two  new\r\n\r\nregional  hospitals: Jurong General Hospital and the Northern\r\n\r\nGeneral Hospital.  While this move may be good for the nation\r\n\r\nin its overall contingency plans, it is causing some concerns\r\n\r\nto  the  private sector, as it increases greater  competition\r\n\r\namong  healthcare providers in an already crowded market.   I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest that a deeper study on the complementary  role\r\n\r\nof  the Government and the private sector in the provision of\r\n\r\nquality healthcare, which is ever increasing in demand  among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, needs to be looked into so that duplication  of\r\n\r\nservices leading to wastages can be minimised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, does it mean that by adding more hospitals,\r\n\r\nthe  quality of healthcare will increase?  Modern  technology\r\n\r\nmay  aid  in the diagnosis of sicknesses and, in some  cases,\r\n\r\nprolong  the  life  of patients.  But can  we  say  that  the\r\n\r\nquality of healthcare has improved?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was a reasonably-sized hospital sitting on\r\n\r\ntop  of  a hill along Upper Serangoon Road known as Youngberg\r\n\r\nMemorial  Hospital.  It was situated opposite the  well-known\r\n\r\nBidadari  Cemetery next to Sennett Estate  at  Potong  Pasir.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, our hon. Member for Potong Pasir is  not  here\r\n\r\nto  listen  to  this.  It was then a modern hospital  run  by\r\n\r\nmissionaries.  Some healthy adults among families staying  at\r\n\r\nSennett  Estate were born there.  And the doctor who  treated\r\n\r\nthe  sick was well liked by the people.  With a name such  as\r\n\r\nDr Coffin, many could not have forgotten him.  Compared to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntoday's  hospital and medical facilities, that  hospital  was\r\n\r\noutclassed.   But  the medical care and love  offered  by  Dr\r\n\r\nCoffin  and other learned doctors there would not  have  been\r\n\r\nany  less  than those shown by today's medical practitioners.\r\n\r\nToday, the Northeast MRT line has caused that hospital to  be\r\n\r\npulled  down  for  redevelopment.  With many  happy  memories\r\n\r\nbuilt on compassion linked to good knowledge of medicine, had\r\n\r\nthat  hospital  been  given a chance to continue  in  another\r\n\r\nlocation  in that constituency, with upgraded facilities  and\r\n\r\nassistance  from the community groups, I am sure that  people\r\n\r\nin that part of Singapore would have benefited much.  Medical\r\n\r\ncare,  in  the  eyes  of the people there,  I  am  sure,  was\r\n\r\nexcellent and reasonably priced as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our mission to provide the best medical care to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  let us not forget the medical assistants,  the\r\n\r\nsupport staff and nurses, who collectively, with the doctors,\r\n\r\nmake up the human touch which all too often also helps in the\r\n\r\nhealing process.  As such, their training should include,  if\r\n\r\nnot   already,  behavioral  sciences,  among  other   medical\r\n\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, the best laid-out plans can even\r\n\r\nbreak  down  in  times of tragic circumstances  when  we  are\r\n\r\nsuddenly  faced  with a drastic challenge.  Such  events  can\r\n\r\ncause  unspeakable  pain  not only for  the  people  directly\r\n\r\ninvolved but also for those who see misfortune befall others,\r\n\r\neven  total  strangers.  That pain spills into the  workplace\r\n\r\nand  the  country.   Indeed,  the  Government's  ability   in\r\n\r\nreaching  out  compassionately to those affected economically\r\n\r\nby the current downturn directly affects the nation's ability\r\n\r\nto  maintain high performance in difficult times.  It fosters\r\n\r\na nation's capacity to heal, to learn, to adapt and to excel.\r\n\r\nThose  in  leadership  positions cannot eliminate  suffering.\r\n\r\nNor  can you ask people to check their emotions at the  door.\r\n\r\nBut  the  Government  can  use its leadership  to  begin  the\r\n\r\nhealing  process  and,  through our action,  we  can  empower\r\n\r\npeople  to find their own ways to support one another  during\r\n\r\nuncertain times.  This is the kind of leadership we  wish  we\r\n\r\nwould never have to use.  Yet, it is vital, if we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  nourish  the  very humanity that can make  people  and  a\r\n\r\ncountry great.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  rise  in  support of the Motion  of  Thanks  to  the\r\n\r\nPresident.  Thank you also for allowing me to participate  in\r\n\r\nthis  debate, albeit the arduous task being one of  the  last\r\n\r\nfew speakers.  I do not envy those who are speaking after me.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From brisk walking to running, from rowing boats down\r\n\r\nthe river to exploring the larger seas, the eloquent speakers\r\n\r\nbefore   me  have  articulated  not  just  challenges  facing\r\n\r\nSingapore   but  recommended  solutions  to  overcome   these\r\n\r\nchallenges.   I  hope  the House is not speech-fatigued  just\r\n\r\nyet.  I shall try to entice your attention buds with keywords\r\n\r\nlike \"explosion\", \"tension\" and even \"honeymoon\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has been said about remaking Singapore and the\r\n\r\nnew  vision of what Singapore can be.  One key theme that has\r\n\r\nreceived  much  attention is about rooting Singaporeans  here\r\n\r\nand  calling Singapore our home.  I would like to speak about\r\n\r\nthe nurturing of the Singapore Home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current economic crisis is a rude shock to many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  As the labour MPs in the House have repeatedly\r\n\r\nsaid,  no one is spared.  From the uneducated cleaner to  the\r\n\r\nfactory  operator,  from  the  clerical  officer  to  the  HR\r\n\r\nmanager,  many  have been victims.  Many also  probably  feel\r\n\r\nabused   psychologically,   emotionally   and,   of   course,\r\n\r\nfinancially.  Abused by whom?  By the uncompromising, emotion-free global economic market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current situation we are facing can be akin to\r\n\r\ndomestic  violence.   Like the victims of domestic  violence,\r\n\r\nthe  victims  of  the  current  abusive  economic  conditions\r\n\r\nmanifest  emotional reactions of fear, anxiety, helplessness,\r\n\r\nhopelessness, denial, anger, the list goes on.  Sir, domestic\r\n\r\nviolence is a vicious cycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been involved with domestic violence for\r\n\r\nsome  time  now,  but  let  me  assure  the  House  that   my\r\n\r\ninvolvement is as a counsellor, not as an abuser.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  I look like an abuser.  Tensions will build up  before\r\n\r\nan   abusive  incident  takes  place.   After  the  incident,\r\n\r\ncommonly  known as an explosion, the storm will  subside  and\r\n\r\nthe  honeymoon period will emerge again.  But the  nature  of\r\n\r\nviolence is that it will happen again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In domestic violence work, we help to empower the\r\n\r\nvictims to protect themselves and to raise their self-esteem.\r\n\r\nThe  reality is that many of them will endure many  years  of\r\n\r\nabuse   before   they  decide  to  say  no  and   leave   the\r\n\r\nrelationships.  As social workers, we continue to  work  with\r\n\r\nthem  to minimise the impact of the potential abuse.  We also\r\n\r\nwork  with  the  perpetrators in  overcoming  their  problems\r\n\r\npsychologically  and  behaviorally.  Unmet  expectations  are\r\n\r\ncommon  precursors to tension build-up and further  violence.\r\n\r\nWe help the couple to negotiate each other's expectations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unlike domestic violence where we can work with the\r\n\r\nvictims  and  where  the  victim  may  decide  to  leave  the\r\n\r\nrelationship   should  the  violence  continue,  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ncannot  leave  the  relationship  with  the  global  economic\r\n\r\nmarket.  Worse still, we cannot counsel the perpetrators.  We\r\n\r\nare  at  their mercy.  What we can do then is to continue  to\r\n\r\nwork with the victims and the potential victims.  We need  to\r\n\r\nempower them to be prepared for the next explosion, such that\r\n\r\nthe  impact  is  minimised.  Sir, in  incidents  of  domestic\r\n\r\nviolence, we always have the police to protect and doctors to\r\n\r\ncure.   At  least we hope that they are there all  the  time.\r\n\r\nBut, often times, these are remedial actions.  As much as the\r\n\r\nperpetrators  are  responsible for the actions,  the  victims\r\n\r\nhave also to protect themselves and minimise the impact.\r\n\r\nSir,  Singaporeans must realise by now that we are not immune\r\n\r\nto  the  potentially abusive global economic  realities.   We\r\n\r\ncannot  leave the relationship.  In the Singapore Home,  this\r\n\r\nmarriage is for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlife.   Divorce  is  not an option.   We  need  to  make  the\r\n\r\nrelationship  work.  We can empower ourselves,  lengthen  the\r\n\r\nhoneymoon  period, recognise tensions building  up,  minimise\r\n\r\nthe  impact should the explosion or abuse happen again.  Like\r\n\r\nvictims  of  domestic  violence, we must  come  out  of  each\r\n\r\nabusive incident stronger and more strong-willed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the sooner Singaporeans accept the reality and work\r\n\r\ntowards  protecting  themselves,  the  sooner  they  will  be\r\n\r\nprepared for the next onslaught of abuse.  Singaporeans  need\r\n\r\nto  increase their resilience, be nimble and make adjustments\r\n\r\nquickly  but, above all, increase their repertoire of  coping\r\n\r\nskills.   They  also need to know their partners  and  adjust\r\n\r\naccordingly  to  meet  the latter's  expectations.   While  a\r\n\r\nmarriage  requires  both  parties  to  make  adjustments  and\r\n\r\nnegotiate expectations, the marriage between Singaporeans and\r\n\r\nthe global economic market, unfortunately, seems unfairly one-sided.   We  have  to  make  the  adjustments  to  meet   the\r\n\r\nexpectations of the new global economy.  We need to find  the\r\n\r\nfit  or  else we will feel victimised again.  The  sooner  we\r\n\r\nknow what our partner expects, and the sooner we fulfill  his\r\n\r\nexpectation, the longer will be the honeymoon period.  As  we\r\n\r\nknow, honeymoon periods are the best times in any marriage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government must continue to provide the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  for Singaporeans to improve their  repertoire\r\n\r\nof  skills  to  fit  into  the new  global  realities.   This\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, however, should not only focus  on  providing\r\n\r\nan  array of training programmes, but to include the  complex\r\n\r\nrealities that individuals and families face as they  embrace\r\n\r\nthe  value  of  life-long  learning  amidst  functioning  and\r\n\r\nmanaging a household in a fast-paced society like Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this reality has serious implication on the Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity,  as  they are hardest hit in this recent  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis.  The community must focus and concentrate its efforts\r\n\r\nat  reducing future psychological and emotional abuse brought\r\n\r\nabout by the merciless economic realities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnless  the  members  of  the community  are  able  to  equip\r\n\r\nthemselves  with the required skills and the technical  know-how  of the new economy, they will feel abused again when the\r\n\r\ncycle  returns.   This  requires the  coordinated  effort  of\r\n\r\neveryone  in  the community.  We need to focus our  resources\r\n\r\nand  energies  in  such efforts which  are  critical  to  the\r\n\r\nsurvival  of the community, as well as the Singapore  society\r\n\r\nin general.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me return to the Singapore Home. The constituents\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore Home are the different ethnic communities.\r\n\r\nFamily  systems theory noted that the whole is  greater  than\r\n\r\nthe sum of its parts.  The strength of the Singapore Home  is\r\n\r\nnot merely the existence of the different ethnic communities,\r\n\r\nbut  rather  the  dynamic interaction  between  them.   These\r\n\r\ninteractions are key ingredients to the development of social\r\n\r\nsupport networks and systems in the Singapore Home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, social support systems are critical in the home as\r\n\r\nthey often buffer the impact of domestic violence.  While the\r\n\r\nglobal  economic market may be a potentially abusive partner,\r\n\r\nthe  abuse may not come from the economic sphere alone.   The\r\n\r\nthreat  of  global terrorism calls for Singaporeans  to  look\r\n\r\nwithin ourselves and assess the support system that we  have.\r\n\r\nThe  analogy  of domestic violence that I have  used  is  not\r\n\r\nunintentional.  Indeed, the threat of terrorism is no more  a\r\n\r\nforeign  and external issue.  It has become a domestic  issue\r\n\r\non the threats of violence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, prior to September 11 and the JI arrests, we seem\r\n\r\nto take our social support network for granted.  Not only are\r\n\r\nsocial support systems critical during times of crisis,  they\r\n\r\nare  indeed  our  first line of defence.  Our social  support\r\n\r\nnetwork is not a static phenomenon.  It is dynamic and fluid.\r\n\r\nIt requires constant effort at building and sustaining.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1994, I conducted a study on social support\r\n\r\nnetwork of low income families.  One aspect of the study  was\r\n\r\nto  assess  the role of social support network as buffers  to\r\n\r\neconomic  hardship.  What surprises me is that  families  are\r\n\r\nless likely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  have individuals from different ethnic groups as part  of\r\n\r\ntheir  social  network, even when they are neighbours.   This\r\n\r\nspurred  me  to  include cross-cultural understanding  in  my\r\n\r\nclasses  at NUS.  In the class, one of the exercises  that  I\r\n\r\nusually  task my students to do is to interview five  persons\r\n\r\nwho  are different from them ethnically, to understand  their\r\n\r\nvalues  and  belief  systems.   Many  of  the  students  have\r\n\r\ndifficulty  doing so, even when the exercise  did  not  limit\r\n\r\nthem  to  talking  to strangers only, ie, they  can  actually\r\n\r\ninterview  friends  that  they had  known  even  before  they\r\n\r\nentered  university.   Many have difficulty  completing  that\r\n\r\nexercise.   Each  time I give them a quiz on what  they  know\r\n\r\nabout  each  other's  community, they fail  miserably.   When\r\n\r\nSeptember 11 took place, one senior Chinese grassroots leader\r\n\r\ncame up to me and asked why do Muslim women need to wear  the\r\n\r\ntudung.  I am sure many of us have many questions about  each\r\n\r\nother's values and practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do these findings and anecdotes indicate? I am not\r\n\r\ntoo  sure.  Our integration policies are in place.   Yet,  we\r\n\r\nare  still  seeing such outcomes.  Perhaps the outcome  could\r\n\r\nhave  been worse if the policies had not been in place.  Sir,\r\n\r\nit  is not surprising that people gravitate to their own kind\r\n\r\nand  remain in their comfort zones.  I am not advocating  for\r\n\r\nmore Government intervention, but for Singaporeans to realise\r\n\r\nthat they need to be committed to the process of inter-ethnic\r\n\r\nintegration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the threat of terrorism came knocking on our doors\r\n\r\nrecently,  the issue of inter-ethnic relation was  pushed  to\r\n\r\nthe  forefront.  It is a timely reminder that  we  cannot  be\r\n\r\ncomplacent.    We  need  to  recognise  that   building   and\r\n\r\nsustaining  relationships  and networks  require  effort  and\r\n\r\ncommitment.  It is not enough for us to merely smile  at  our\r\n\r\nneighbours  or  get  our children to dress  in  each  other's\r\n\r\nethnic  costumes during Racial Harmony Day.  These  are  good\r\n\r\nstarting  points but we cannot remain at the starting  block.\r\n\r\nEach community must make the effort to reach out to the other\r\n\r\ncommunities.  The best way is, of course, to open the common\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspaces.  Yes, we do recognise and respect the private spaces.\r\n\r\nBut  to  build  relationships, we need to  step  out  of  our\r\n\r\nprivate spaces and enter the public spaces more readily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of cross-cultural understanding and\r\n\r\ninteraction  requires  a  high level  of  self-awareness  and\r\n\r\nopenness.  While we are presently \"gung-ho\" about wanting  to\r\n\r\nimprove interaction and getting to know each other better, we\r\n\r\nmust  be  mindful  of the potential threat of  ethnocentrism.\r\n\r\nEach community must respect the values and cultures of others\r\n\r\nand  avoid  the perception that one's values are better  than\r\n\r\nthe  others'.  This is ethnocentrism.  The issue of  religion\r\n\r\nand   value  systems  is  so  intrinsically  rooted  in  each\r\n\r\nindividual  and community that it is often all too  sensitive\r\n\r\nto  discuss  it  in  the  open.  Self-awareness  is  crucial.\r\n\r\nMutual  respect is imminent.  The work of the IRCC must  take\r\n\r\ninto account these key factors for it to succeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we continue to nurture the Singapore\r\n\r\nHome  with  strong  inter-ethnic bonds,  another  significant\r\n\r\npillar of the home that needs attention is the family.  There\r\n\r\nhas  been  talk  that  many Singaporean families  are  highly\r\n\r\nstressed.  Indicators that our families are stressed  include\r\n\r\nincidences  of  juvenile  delinquency,  marital  dissolution,\r\n\r\ndomestic violence, drug abuse, etc, in these families.  While\r\n\r\nstatistics show that these problems are either on  a  decline\r\n\r\nor  are  stabilised,  we cannot pretend  that  they  are  not\r\n\r\nimportant.   Often  times, these problems do  not  happen  in\r\n\r\nisolation - they actually co-exist and we typically have what\r\n\r\nsocial workers call multi-problem families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The systemic effects of any of these problems are\r\n\r\ntremendous.  A family who has a juvenile delinquent not  only\r\n\r\ndeals with the behavioral problems presented by the teenager,\r\n\r\nbut  also  the effects on the other family members.   Marital\r\n\r\nrelationships  are often strained with couples placing  blame\r\n\r\non one another.  The compensatory efforts at dealing with the\r\n\r\ndelinquent child often result in unintentional neglect of the\r\n\r\nother children. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npotential  effects  go on.  The juvenile delinquent,  if  not\r\n\r\nwell rehabilitated, may graduate to be adult offenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, families need to be strengthened to prevent the\r\n\r\nonset of such incidences. The family today is different  from\r\n\r\nthe  family of yesterday.  Yes, in its form and function, one\r\n\r\nmay argue that there is no difference.  However, the dynamics\r\n\r\nof role performances must change to keep up with the changing\r\n\r\nenvironments. I read with great interest the issues raised in\r\n\r\nthe   last   Parliament  as  it  debated  on  family-friendly\r\n\r\npractices.   I should not belabour the point nor  repeat  the\r\n\r\npoints  raised.  However, I would like to reiterate the  need\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  recognise some of the changes that families  are\r\n\r\nsubjected  to,  and  respond with a  clear  message  that  we\r\n\r\nsupport   these   changes  through  relevant   policies   and\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to strengthen our families, we need to ensure that\r\n\r\nemotional  bonds between each family member are strong,  such\r\n\r\nthat  support  would  be  available  when  called  upon.  The\r\n\r\nemotional bond between mother and child is a given and, often\r\n\r\ntimes, assumed to be a natural order of things.  However, the\r\n\r\nemotional  bonds between fathers and children are  considered\r\n\r\nrather  alien,  especially in the context of Asian  cultures.\r\n\r\nFathers  are seen more as disciplinarians in families.   They\r\n\r\nare  not supposed to be emotional.  Our boys are still raised\r\n\r\nnot  to  show their emotions.  Sociological and psychological\r\n\r\nresearch  has  begun to show the importance  of  father-child\r\n\r\nbonds in the development of children and families.  Bonds  do\r\n\r\nnot  appear  overnight.   They  need  to  be  cultivated  and\r\n\r\nnurtured.  In my work with fathers, I have heard many  lament\r\n\r\nthat  they  do  not  know how to relate to  their  adolescent\r\n\r\nchildren, as much as they realise the importance of doing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, bonds of fathering must be developed when children\r\n\r\nare  young and most dependent.  I am pleased to note that the\r\n\r\nGovernment has made provisions for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npaternity  leave for fathers to be involved in the  lives  of\r\n\r\ntheir new born.  The current three days of paternity leave is\r\n\r\na  good  start,  though I would encourage the  Government  to\r\n\r\nconsider  extending it.  And I think we have  the  next  five\r\n\r\nyears  to  discuss  that.  An infant child  is  at  his  most\r\n\r\ndependent  state, and this is the most excellent time  for  a\r\n\r\nfather to establish the bond with the child.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another opportunity for bonding is when the child is\r\n\r\nill.   Today, we have child sick leave only for female  civil\r\n\r\nservants.   Sir, this seems to send the message that  when  a\r\n\r\nchild is sick, it is the responsibility of the mother to care\r\n\r\nfor  the child.  I would recommend that the child sick  leave\r\n\r\nbenefit  be  extended  to  male  civil  servants  to  send  a\r\n\r\nconsistent  and  clear  message  that  fathers  are   equally\r\n\r\nresponsible and capable of looking after a sick child.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other opportunities like facilitating father's\r\n\r\npresence in parent-teacher meetings in schools.  I have often\r\n\r\ngiven  parenting talks in schools, and one clear  observation\r\n\r\nwhich  is supported by many school principals, is that, often\r\n\r\ntimes,  only mothers attend these talks and meetings.   Where\r\n\r\nare  the  fathers?   Working? Many mothers who  attend  these\r\n\r\nmeetings  are working mothers too.  Children often  read  the\r\n\r\nabsence  of  fathers as their disinterest in their  education\r\n\r\nand  the  lives  of their children.  These are  opportunities\r\n\r\nlost for fathers.  The result is a distancing of the children\r\n\r\nfrom their fathers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a society, we need to send a clear message that\r\n\r\nfathers  must be involved in the total development  of  their\r\n\r\nchildren, as do mothers.  In this regard, may I be so trivial\r\n\r\nto  suggest that the Ministry of the Environment ensure  that\r\n\r\nevery  public  men's  room be equipped with  diaper  changing\r\n\r\nfacilities.   Once,  I had a hard time  finding  a  place  to\r\n\r\nchange  my son's diaper after I took him for swimming,  as  I\r\n\r\ncould not find a place in the men's room to do so.  But, rest\r\n\r\nassured, I did not go to the ladies' room.  There are ways of\r\n\r\ndoing  it  though.  We need to normalise such behaviours  and\r\n\r\nencourage fathers to feel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomfortable about doing such fathering practices in public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, gone are the days where fathers can be contented\r\n\r\nwith  merely bringing home the bacon, or the halal  meat,  or\r\n\r\nthe vegetables.  He is expected to share in the parenting and\r\n\r\nhousehold  responsibilities, just as his wife is  sharing  in\r\n\r\nhis  traditional role of income provider.  The  family  bonds\r\n\r\ncan  be  strengthened with mutually supporting  partners  who\r\n\r\nshare  the  same  vision  and  responsibilities.   Sir,   the\r\n\r\nmeasures above may seem small and insignificant in themselves\r\n\r\nbut,   put  together,  I  am  confident,  as  shown  by  many\r\n\r\nresearchers,  that they would go a long way in ensuring  that\r\n\r\nchildren are raised as successful and confident adults  in  a\r\n\r\nsafe, secure and supportive environment, with the presence of\r\n\r\nboth fathers and mothers.  Sir, as the saying goes, a journey\r\n\r\nof a thousand miles begins with one single footstep.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the sharing of parenting roles and responsibilities\r\n\r\nin  families is even more critical as we study the impact  of\r\n\r\nrestructuring the economy on Singaporean families.  As  women\r\n\r\nare  a force to be reckoned with in the economic sphere, they\r\n\r\ntoo   need   to  constantly  upgrade  themselves  to   remain\r\n\r\nemployable   and   relevant.   Such   demands   have   direct\r\n\r\nimplications  on  how  families  negotiate  their  times   in\r\n\r\nrelation  to parenting responsibilities and individual  needs\r\n\r\nfor  training  and upgrading.  It is thus most  critical  now\r\n\r\nthat  we  begin  to  sow  the  seeds  of  positive  fathering\r\n\r\npractices  as  we prepare Singaporeans moving  into  the  new\r\n\r\neconomic structures.  As we remake Singapore, we need to also\r\n\r\nremake  our  perception of the family - a key pillar  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I talk about the new age father, the way the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  has  been  described  comes  to  mind.\r\n\r\nPaternalistic,  patronizing, patriarchal are adjectives  that\r\n\r\nhave been used to describe the Government.  Yes, the children\r\n\r\nof  Singapore have been raised well with a father figure  who\r\n\r\nknows what is best for them.  I have a similar father too   - dogmatic, disciplinarian and no buts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the children of tomorrow are different. The\r\n\r\nfathering practices that my father used on me no longer  work\r\n\r\nwith  my  children.  I have to be present in their lives.   I\r\n\r\nhave to listen to them  -  listen not just with my ears,  but\r\n\r\nwith   my   eyes  and,  more  importantly,  with  my   heart.\r\n\r\nRecognising  this,  I try to reach out  to  my  father.   The\r\n\r\ninitial  hesitancy is slowly changing.  He is  more  able  to\r\n\r\nexpress his emotions.  He can change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been calls to remake the Government. I think\r\n\r\nthe   Government  should  continue  being   the   father   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  But the new age father also nurtures his child\r\n\r\nand  provides the emotional support when needed.  He is  more\r\n\r\nthan a disciplinarian, more than the decision maker.  He is a\r\n\r\nfriend  who  has  built strong bonds when  the  child  is  an\r\n\r\ninfant.   It is timely for the Government to invest in  these\r\n\r\nbonds  today.  The children are reaching out to  the  father.\r\n\r\nLike my father, I am confident that the Government is capable\r\n\r\nof  responding to this call.  Take time to listen, take  time\r\n\r\nto nurture, take time to provide the emotional support.  I am\r\n\r\nconfident  it will go a long way in building up  a  Singapore\r\n\r\nHome that is united, strong, resilient and supportive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am as old as independent Singapore is. I have\r\n\r\nseen how my parents built a strong home for my eight siblings\r\n\r\nand I  -  from the kampong house at Coronation Road to the 1-room  rental flat in Toa Payoh and, subsequently, to a 3-room\r\n\r\npurchase flat in Toa Payoh where they still live today.  Like\r\n\r\nmany  other  first  generation  Singaporeans,  they  overcame\r\n\r\ninsurmountable challenges.  It is a process that is on-going.\r\n\r\nToday, like many other young couples, my wife and I strive to\r\n\r\nbuild  a  strong  home for our children.  I  have  spoken  of\r\n\r\nnurturing the Singapore Home  - preparing ourselves  for  the\r\n\r\nexpectation of Singapore's marriage partner, ie,  the  global\r\n\r\neconomic market, strengthening the bonds between communities,\r\n\r\nstrengthening families through enhancing the role of fathers,\r\n\r\nand developing new age fathering practices in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe relationship between the Government and the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is my vision as a Singaporean, as a young\r\n\r\nfather  of another generation of Singaporeans.  For Singapore\r\n\r\nto  survive,  we  need to accept and move  towards  a  common\r\n\r\ndestiny.  Singaporeans must share the same vision.  My vision\r\n\r\nfor  the  remade  Singapore is one in which  the  people  are\r\n\r\neconomically successful, yet rooted and bonded to the family,\r\n\r\nindividually  confident, yet socially  networked,  global  in\r\n\r\noutlook,  yet Singaporean in identity.  These are ingredients\r\n\r\nthat will continue to nurture the Singapore H ome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the debate be now adjourned.\" - [Mr Mah Bow\r\n\r\nTan].\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Resumption of debate on what day, Mrs Lim?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Tomorrow, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Twenty six</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">minutes to Six o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\nColumn 457\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nColumn 458\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
