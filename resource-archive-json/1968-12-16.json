Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the House rose\r\n\r\nfor  the adjournment last Friday night, I was  on  the\r\n\r\npoint of answering questions which were raised by  the\r\n\r\nMembers  for Delta, Crawford and Ulu Pandan concerning\r\n\r\nour  international relations and our  foreign  affairs\r\n\r\npolicy.  The  Member for Delta asked what the  present\r\n\r\nstate  was  of  ASEAN, what future it would  have  and\r\n\r\nwhether any concrete progress could be achieved by it.\r\n\r\nWell, Sir, even as I commenced replying to her, things\r\n\r\nwere  taking  place in Bangkok where our Minister  for\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs  along with other  Ministers  of  the\r\n\r\nASEAN  member states had been conferring, among  other\r\n\r\nthings, to keep ASEAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nviable,  and  an on-going concern despite  the  little\r\n\r\ndispute  that was going on between two member  states.\r\n\r\nIt  is  on  record, I am heartened to say,  that  some\r\n\r\nunderstanding  has  been reached between  the  Foreign\r\n\r\nMinister  of  the  Philippines and  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  of  Malaysia  at  Bangkok,  subject  to  the\r\n\r\nconcurrence  of  their respective  governments,  which\r\n\r\nwill,  we  hope,  allow ASEAN a fresh  opportunity  to\r\n\r\ncarry   on  business.  You  cannot  allow  a  business\r\n\r\nenterprise to close shop after having started business\r\n\r\njust  because  differences occur between  two  of  its\r\n\r\nboard  members, as differences are only to be expected\r\n\r\nfrom time to time over one another's specific problem.\r\n\r\nEven  the  European Economic Community, which  is  not\r\n\r\njust  10  years old but almost 20 years old, does  not\r\n\r\nfunction with unanimity on all issues. One example  is\r\n\r\nthe  admission of the United Kingdom into  the  common\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN has as yet not brought direct benefit 10 its\r\n\r\nmembers,   but   this  should  occasion   no   special\r\n\r\ndisappointment because it s only just over a year old.\r\n\r\nDuring the year substantial progress has been made  to\r\n\r\nclarify and define approaches to greater economic  co-\r\n\r\noperation   among  member  states.   At   the   recent\r\n\r\nMinisterial  Meeting  held in  Djakarta  last  August,\r\n\r\nareas  of  co-operation  have  been  defined  in  food\r\n\r\nproduction and supply (including fisheries), shipping,\r\n\r\ntransportation, telecommunications, civil aviation and\r\n\r\ntourism.   In   fact,   on  tourism,   some   of   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  have  already been  implemented,  for\r\n\r\nexample, the introduction of a seven-day free visa  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  facilities for package  and  chartered\r\n\r\ntours.  There  is  also the bilateral  agreement  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia on the Bali tourist potential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with our policy of making the maximum\r\n\r\nnumber  of friends, Singapore must co-operate with  as\r\n\r\nmany   countries  as  possible  for  mutual   benefit,\r\n\r\nparticularly   so  in  the  case  of   our   immediate\r\n\r\nneighbours, namely, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand  and\r\n\r\nthe Philippines. This is a natural grouping of nations\r\n\r\nin a common neighbourhood, but effort\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  be  made to foster the community spirit so  that\r\n\r\nmutual   understanding  and  co-operation  is  further\r\n\r\ndeveloped.  Whatever the difficulties of  the  moment,\r\n\r\nthe  ASEAN concept must be maintained - even as a state\r\n\r\nof  mind.  Last Friday night, I said that we  have  no\r\n\r\nillusions  about regionalism or about  joining  ASEAN.\r\n\r\nFor  in  the ultimate, the small nations in  a  single\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  have  to stick together  regardless  of\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  in  Asia,  Africa,  Europe  or  South\r\n\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Delta, Crawford and Ulu Pandan also\r\n\r\ntouched on our defence build-up and would like to know\r\n\r\nhow  it  would affect our non-aligned policy  and  our\r\n\r\ncommitment  to regional co-operation, against  a  back\r\n\r\nground  of  turbulence in the Southeast Asian  region.\r\n\r\nAnd   as   the  Member  for  Crawford  puts  it, the\r\n\r\npossibility  of shifting balance of power  within  the\r\n\r\nregion arising from the possibility of an early end to\r\n\r\nthe  Vietnam  war and the emergence of  a  well-tried,\r\n\r\nwell-organised military organisation in Vietnam larger\r\n\r\nthan that of our members of the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place. Sir, I do not see any\r\n\r\nincompatibility  between our defence  build-up,  which\r\n\r\nwill  cost us some $350 million in next year's budget,\r\n\r\nand  our  non-aligned  policy.  There  is  neither  in\r\n\r\nconsistency  nor incompatibility, it is an  inevitable\r\n\r\nconcomitant  of our independence that we  develop  and\r\n\r\nexercise our muscles for defence purposes, and, as far\r\n\r\nas  we are concerned, for defence purposes only. It is\r\n\r\nlike  members of the fair sex deciding these  days  to\r\n\r\ntake  up karate or judo. I am sure these precautionary\r\n\r\nmeasures  are  for  defence and not for  offence.  For\r\n\r\nwhile  the intention in such cases where the fair  sex\r\n\r\nis  concerned  is  to be equipped  to  defend  herself\r\n\r\nagainst  any attack against her modesty, it does  not,\r\n\r\nof  course, preclude her from giving way to temptation\r\n\r\nand using it for other non-defensive purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, there is no doubt in my mind that our\r\n\r\nregional  effort  in defence is inseparably  bound  up\r\n\r\nwith our neighbour  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaysia and tied to co-operation and assistance\r\n\r\nfrom  our  Commonwealth partners, the United  Kingdom,\r\n\r\nAustralia  and New Zealand. But we need  to  establish\r\n\r\ncredibility and a sort of creditworthiness  ourselves,\r\n\r\nso that our part of the bargain in the total set-up is\r\n\r\nnot wholly insignificant or negative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, I do not think, as the Member for\r\n\r\nCrawford  might be anxious about, that the  Vietnamese\r\n\r\npeople  after  more  than two  decades  of  suffering,\r\n\r\nharassment and war, would want anything more  than  to\r\n\r\nenjoy  the  blessings of peace and  to  rebuild  their\r\n\r\neconomy  and  get  on with the business  of  a  normal\r\n\r\npeaceful  existence once the war there  is  officially\r\n\r\nand technically over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like also to stress the point that it is of\r\n\r\nthe  utmost  importance that while  we  make  progress\r\n\r\ninternally  in strengthening our economic and  defence\r\n\r\nsinews,  internationally  we  should  also  make   the\r\n\r\nmaximum progress within our limited resources to  seek\r\n\r\nand maintain the friendship of other nations, both big\r\n\r\nand  small and whatever their ideology and systems  of\r\n\r\ngovernment.  If  by  our defence  policy  and  defence\r\n\r\narrangements  we can ensure that other  nations  would\r\n\r\nnot  be predisposed to be aggressive towards us,  then\r\n\r\nto  that  extent we will feel assured of a  basis  for\r\n\r\nfriendly relations, upon which we can further seek  to\r\n\r\nenlarge  by  continuing  to pursue  a  forward-looking\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we extend the hand of friendship to all\r\n\r\nnations  alike,  there is also  the  need  for  us  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  friendship even with those nations that  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  as friendly, in the hope that over the  years\r\n\r\nthey too will appreciate our gesture of friendship and\r\n\r\ndiscard  any hostility or dissatisfaction  which  they\r\n\r\nmay hold against us. The hard reality of international\r\n\r\nlife  is  that today's foes can be tomorrow's friends.\r\n\r\nAfter  all,  governments are made up of  human  beings\r\n\r\nwhose policies are subject to change depending on what\r\n\r\nis in their own respective interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our foreign policy is, briefly, in a sense, a most\r\n\r\nforward \"defence\" policy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  can be conceived, since it endeavours to  secure\r\n\r\nthe  maximum  of  friends and ensure their  friendship\r\n\r\nwith  us  at  all  times and under all  circumstances,\r\n\r\nwhatever  their own attitudes and reactions  to  other\r\n\r\nnations, in  a way, our policy of friendship  towards\r\n\r\nall nations indirectly supplements our security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our non-aligned policy as brought up by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Crawford, Sir, I already spoke  at  length\r\n\r\nlast  Thursday on this topic and I would not  like  to\r\n\r\nburden  the  House by unnecessarily repeating  it  all\r\n\r\nover again. However. I would again stress that our non-\r\n\r\naligned policy is anchored to safe and unexceptionable\r\n\r\npremises which are beyond dispute and contradiction. I\r\n\r\nshould also like to explain - as there appears  to  be\r\n\r\nsome  confusion  about this - that non-alignment  does\r\n\r\nnot  mean  rigid neutralism in dealing  with  specific\r\n\r\nissues. This distinction must be understood, otherwise\r\n\r\nwe  may be unjustifiably and mistakenly represented by\r\n\r\nthe  misinformed or the mischievous that we follow one\r\n\r\nbloc  or  another in making known our stand on certain\r\n\r\nimportant issues from time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we express our conviction and our opinion on\r\n\r\nany  specific issue, we do so purely on the merits  of\r\n\r\nthe  case  and  in the light of our national  interest\r\n\r\nfirst  and  foremost, and not because  we  follow  one\r\n\r\npower  bloc or another as such. Our non-aligned policy\r\n\r\ndoes not, in fact, preclude us from expressing our own\r\n\r\nconviction  on  specific  issues  based  on  our   own\r\n\r\nexperience and circumstances, and our own judgment  on\r\n\r\nthe   effect   it  would  have  on  our  international\r\n\r\nrelations,  itself  resting on our  basic  premise  in\r\n\r\nwanting  to be friends to all and enemy to  none.  The\r\n\r\npolicy  of non-alignment cannot be a policy of non-com\r\n\r\nmitment  in  the literal sense of the word.  It  could\r\n\r\nnever be so, because in carrying out a policy of  non-\r\n\r\nalignment,  we  aim  for  the achievement  of  certain\r\n\r\ndefinite objectives. For that matter, no policy can be\r\n\r\nconsidered  as  uncommitted because  every  policy  we\r\n\r\ndecide upon and execute implies action and has certain\r\n\r\ndefinite objectives for the achievement of which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is  engaged. So the last thing that the policy  of\r\n\r\nnon-alignment can mean is to have permanent enemies or\r\n\r\npermanent friends. This it cannot be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Crawford also touched on the changing\r\n\r\nscene  and  power shifts in Asia and he made reference\r\n\r\nto the emergence of a strong Vietnam, once the present\r\n\r\nconflict  is over As I said in the general  debate  on\r\n\r\nthe Budget, small countries like Singapore will always\r\n\r\nbe  in  the shadow of more powerful nations. But  just\r\n\r\nbecause  they are powerful, it should not be taken  to\r\n\r\nhe  synonymous with any suggestion that they have  any\r\n\r\nhostile  intentions towards us. For that  matter,  not\r\n\r\nonly  will  Vietnam be a strong nation, as the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Crawford  has  said, but  there  are  many  other\r\n\r\nstronger nations than Vietnam, as he knows. Judging by\r\n\r\nboth  the  pronouncements of policy and their actions,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  should  rest assured  that  whatever  the\r\n\r\nstrength  of  countries like Vietnam,  our  policy  of\r\n\r\nfriendship with all, regardless of ideology or systems\r\n\r\nof  government, is intended to show that just as we do\r\n\r\nnot wish to interfere in their internal affairs or the\r\n\r\nway  they  run their government, we also respect  them\r\n\r\nfor  according  us the same treatment.  In  brief,  we\r\n\r\ncannot  allow  ourselves to be perpetually  living  in\r\n\r\nfear  of  our  surroundings simply because  there  are\r\n\r\nlarge  super-powers,  much  stronger  nations  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.   By  adhering  to  intelligent  and  realistic\r\n\r\npolicies,  I am confident we and other small countries\r\n\r\ncan still live and work together for mutual benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Delta\r\n\r\nraised a question concerning our posts in Johore Bahru\r\n\r\nand   Rangoon.  As  for  Johore  Bahru,  the  original\r\n\r\nproposal  was to have a consular post there  with  the\r\n\r\nappointment  of  an  officer  of  the  rank  of  Third\r\n\r\nSecretary, to deal primarily with the issue  of  visas\r\n\r\nand related matters connected with facilitating travel\r\n\r\nbetween  West  Malaysia and Singapore.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nthe response to this from Malaysia has not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  favourable in view of its interpretation of  our\r\n\r\nrequest as being that of our desire for establishing a\r\n\r\nvisa  office, tantamount to establishing a  branch  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Immigration Department in Johore  Bahru\r\n\r\nwhich is foreign territory. While the establishment of\r\n\r\nsuch an office would have in fact been more beneficial\r\n\r\nto  Malaysians wishing to travel to Singapore, in view\r\n\r\nof  this  response the matter was not pursued further.\r\n\r\nHowever, the provision still remains and as soon as it\r\n\r\nis convenient to establish a consular office in Johore\r\n\r\nBahru  with  a wider range of functions,  a  fresh  ap\r\n\r\nproach will be made to the Malaysian Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Rangoon, it is not possible to say\r\n\r\ncategorically when this post will be set up. All I can\r\n\r\nsay  now  is that it has to be fitted into an  amended\r\n\r\ntime-table  taking into account various  new  missions\r\n\r\nwhich have to be set up in the course of the next year\r\n\r\nor two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> A point of\r\n\r\nclarification, Sir.

In some\r\n\r\ncases,   these   provisions  fall   short   of   those\r\n\r\nrecommended  by the International Labour Organisation.\r\n\r\nIf  we  compare  our legislation with  that  of  other\r\n\r\ncountries,  our  requirements  are  not  up  to  their\r\n\r\nstandard.  The Factory Inspectorate is entrusted  with\r\n\r\nthe  enforcement of these requirements. However,  very\r\n\r\noften,  the  recommendations or rulings  made  by  the\r\n\r\nInspectorate  are  quietly overlooked  or  ignored  by\r\n\r\nindustrialists  who  make  representations  to   other\r\n\r\nauthorities  entrusted with economic  development,  on\r\n\r\nthe flimsy excuse that a rigid enforcement of such  re\r\n\r\nquirements  would result in hampering  the  growth  of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to warn the House that there is a rising\r\n\r\ntrend in the rate of industrial accidents, one type of\r\n\r\nwhich  has not been discussed. I think these accidents\r\r\n\r\nare  mainly  due to the absence of safety devices  and\r\n\r\nsafety   appliances  and  the  poor   maintenance   of\r\n\r\nindustrial equipment. This is exactly what the Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate  is  out to eliminate.  In  Jurong, many\r\n\r\nindustrialists ignore the simple requirements set  out\r\n\r\nin   the  Factories  (Persons-in-Charge)  Regulations,\r\n\r\n1960.  Sir, this is bad. I consider that if we pass  a\r\n\r\nset  of laws, we should ensure that they work. But  if\r\n\r\nwe  think  that such laws are hampering our industrial\r\n\r\nprogress  -  or even hampering any progress  for  that\r\n\r\nmatter  - let us revise them. The Inspectorate  should\r\n\r\nnot be asked to go round and try to do a good job when\r\n\r\nthe  requirements are not being carried out  properly.\r\n\r\nIt  just goes round to see that the legal requirements\r\n\r\nare carried out by the industrialists. Of course, when\r\n\r\nI refer to industrialists not conforming to our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequirements, I do not refer to all of them but  to  a\r\n\r\nnumber of them in Jurong who only care to make a quick\r\n\r\nprofit and who do not worry about simple safety  rules\r\n\r\nto protect the health and welfare of their workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has professed itself to be\r\n\r\ndemocratic and socialist. The workers have given their\r\n\r\nunfailing  support to us all these years.  If  we  are\r\n\r\nasking  them  to sacrifice their fringe  benefits  for\r\n\r\nyears  to  come, let us at least make  sure  that  the\r\n\r\nfactories  are  run in such a way  as  to  ensure  the\r\n\r\nsafety and health of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must say that the Factory Inspectorate has\r\n\r\nbeen trying to do a good job in spite of a shortage of\r\n\r\nstaff and experienced engineers. Here again. I have to\r\n\r\nbring  up the same point which I brought up under  the\r\n\r\nHead \"Ministry of Foreign Affairs\". If a job is to  be\r\n\r\ndone, it should be done well, and if it is to be  done\r\n\r\nwell,  attractive salaries should be paid to the staff\r\n\r\nso  that  they  will want to stay in  the  service.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that only the Chief Inspector and the  Senior\r\n\r\nAssistant  of the Factory Inspectorate have sufficient\r\n\r\nexperience to carry out involved inspections, such  as\r\n\r\ninspections of boilers, etc. This means That they have\r\n\r\nto make such inspections all the time. They cannot get\r\n\r\nmuch  help  from their younger inspectors who  do  not\r\n\r\nhave sufficient experience. This is all wrong. Sir,If\r\n\r\nwe   want   a   Factory   Inspectorate   to   function\r\n\r\nefficiently,  I think we should provide it  with  more\r\n\r\nstaff.  Even if it means paying them better  salaries,\r\n\r\nby all means do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in full\r\n\r\nagreement with the Member for Crawford that it is  our\r\n\r\nresponsibility to see to the safety and welfare of the\r\n\r\nworkers.

They have\r\n\r\ndecided to make Singapore their permanent home  and  a\r\n\r\nnation to which they can owe loyalty. They have  their\r\n\r\nfamilies  here.  They have their  wives  and  children\r\n\r\nliving  here,  all  of  whom are  Singapore  citizens,\r\n\r\nHowever, the income of these people is not very  high.\r\n\r\nThey  are not considered to be making any contribution\r\n\r\nto   our   national  economy.

They  should\r\n\r\nreceive  due consideration by the Government. Children\r\n\r\nborn in Singapore, particularly those born during  the\r\n\r\nJapanese   Occupation,  should  be   given   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship. The lack of a Singapore birth certificate\r\n\r\nmay  not  be  the parents' fault, as in  the  case  of\r\n\r\nchildren  who were born before the Japanese Occupation\r\n\r\nor even after the Japanese Occupation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I support the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson on his amendment. We all  know  that\r\n\r\nlaws  are man-made. We do not deny that when  we  have\r\n\r\nachieved independence, we should make everybody  under\r\n\r\nstand  that  citizenship confers  certain  rights  and\r\n\r\nduties. The Government has citizenship laws which  are\r\n\r\napplicable to all the people. Everybody living in  the\r\n\r\nstate  knows what his rights and duties are. When  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  have  been given their rights,  they  should\r\n\r\nknow  how  to carry out their duties towards the  country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there is a doubt among many people\r\n\r\nregarding the laws of citizenship. Take, for instance,\r\n\r\nthe  definition  of \"citizenship\".  Many  people  have\r\n\r\nstayed  in Singapore for many years. Yet they are  not\r\n\r\nable  to get their citizenship. They are at a loss  to\r\n\r\nunderstand why this is so. Some people who  have  just\r\n\r\ncome   to   Singapore   from  abroad   have   acquired\r\n\r\ncitizenship. Yet many people who have stayed in  Singa\r\n\r\npore  for more than ten years are still unable to  get\r\n\r\ntheir  citizenship. What is the reason?  How  can  you\r\n\r\nexplain  this?  The  definition  of  \"citizenship\"  is\r\n\r\nrather  vague.  The implementation of the  citizenship\r\n\r\npolicy has, therefore, given rise to some uncertainty.\r\n\r\nCapitalists  coming from abroad and investing  250,000\r\n\r\nhere can obtain citizenship in a very short time.  Yet\r\n\r\nmany  of our people who were born here and have stayed\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  for  many years  could  not  gel  their\r\n\r\ncitizenship. This has caused us Members of  Parliament\r\n\r\nsome trouble. When we meet these people, they say.  \"I\r\n\r\nsent  in my application for citizenship three or  four\r\n\r\nyears  ago and I have not received any reply from  the\r\n\r\nCitizenship\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegistry.\"  In  some cases they have waited  for  five\r\n\r\nyears  without any reply. Being Members of Parliament,\r\n\r\nwe  have to tell them that we will bring them  to  the\r\n\r\nofficer  concerned  and  see  what  we  can  do.  But,\r\n\r\naccording to the complaints we have received,  nothing\r\n\r\nhappens   in  the  end  in  spite  of  the   necessary\r\n\r\ninterviews. One or two weeks after the interview, they\r\n\r\nwould  receive  a  letter to  the  effect  that  their\r\n\r\napplications  had  been  turned  clown.  They  finally\r\n\r\nblamed the Members of Parliament. They would say  that\r\n\r\nif  they had not sought the help of Members of  Parlia\r\n\r\nment,  nothing would have happened. Now that they  had\r\n\r\nasked for our help, their applications had been turned\r\n\r\ndown  or rejected by the Citizenship Registry.  So  we\r\n\r\nhave become the scapegoats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock temporarily in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained my points very briefly. I have\r\n\r\ntouched   upon   some  aspects  of  the   problem   of\r\n\r\ncitizenship. Citizens are important components  of  an\r\n\r\nindependent  country.  Many  people  are  put   in   a\r\n\r\ndifficult  position because of the present  Government\r\n\r\npolicy. As has been said by the Member for Anson, many\r\n\r\npeople  who  have  been affected by the  circumstances\r\n\r\nexplained  earlier  have not been able  to  get  their\r\n\r\napplications for citizenship approved. We should  take\r\n\r\nsteps to consider their cases. Unless we expedite  the\r\n\r\nprocessing  of applications for approval, we  will  be\r\n\r\nblamed by the people all the time. I suggest we set up\r\n\r\nan  advisory  committee to look into all these  cases.\r\n\r\nThe   duty  of  the  Registrar  is  to  abide  by  the\r\n\r\ninstructions  of  the  Minister,  According   to   the\r\n\r\nMinister,  the practice now is that if an  application\r\n\r\nis  not  approved, there the matter rests. Some people\r\n\r\nmay    have   sufficient   qualifications   in   their\r\n\r\napplications   to  deserve  favourable  consideration.\r\n\r\nThere  are many people who are related to some of  our\r\n\r\nlocal  people.  For  instance,  a  husband  may  be  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen but the wife is not, or it  may  be\r\n\r\nthe  other way round. When the wife is a citizen,  she\r\n\r\nmay not apply to the Registry of Citizenship for her\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\nhusband's  citizenship. But at the moment the  husband\r\n\r\ncan  apply for the wife's citizenship within a certain\r\n\r\nperiod of time of her stay here, Some members of their\r\n\r\nfamilies are doing nothing at home. They are depending\r\n\r\nonly on air and water to survive! We must not take the\r\n\r\nview that because the law provides for such a line  of\r\n\r\naction,  we  must act accordingly. These  are  matters\r\n\r\nwhich require our sympathetic consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest again the setting up of an advisory\r\n\r\ncommittee  comprising Government  representatives  and\r\n\r\nsome   Members  of  Parliament.  This  committee   can\r\n\r\ninvestigate into cases which have been pending  for  a\r\n\r\nlong    time.    If    certain   applications    merit\r\n\r\nconsideration, this advisory committee can make  recom\r\n\r\nmendations to the Minister for his final decision.  In\r\n\r\nthis way we might be able to solve this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Sir, for once I am\r\n\r\ninclined to support the complaints made by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson,  the  Member  for Kampong  Kembangan,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tiong Bahru and the Member for Delta who is\r\n\r\nthe only lady Member of this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to ask the Minister concerned\r\n\r\nwhether anti-national elements and communalists  could\r\n\r\nnot  be  deprived of their citizenship, and,  instead,\r\n\r\ncitizenship  be  granted  to  persons  whose   loyalty\r\n\r\ntowards  Singapore is not in question and who wish  to\r\n\r\nlive  in  Singapore permanently. Secondly,  would  the\r\n\r\nMinister  consider the case of children who were  born\r\n\r\nin Singapore after 17th March, 1967, and whose parents\r\n\r\nare  non-Singapore citizens? If these children are not\r\n\r\ngranted  citizenship, they will be  faced  with  grave\r\n\r\nproblems  in the future. Furthermore, they  will  also\r\n\r\ncreate problems for our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they are unable to go to school because they\r\n\r\nare  non-citizens. When they grow up, they  cannot  be\r\n\r\nemployed because they will be issued with blue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nidentity  cards and they cannot get public  assistance\r\n\r\nbecause  they are non-citizens. These are the problems\r\n\r\nthat they will face. They have got no alternative  but\r\n\r\nto  become  secret society members,  thieves  or  even\r\n\r\nkidnappers  and the peace of our country  will  be  at\r\n\r\nstake. This is our problem and we have to face it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Minister will give consideration to this\r\n\r\nmatter, perhaps we can be less stringent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  have  received many complaints from the people  on\r\n\r\nthis  problem and I would like to inform the  Minister\r\n\r\nof  some of their hardships and complaints. [Laughter]\r\n\r\nThis  is not a laughing matter. Many applications  for\r\n\r\ncitizenship  have  been  rejected  without  sufficient\r\n\r\nreasons  being given. I can give an example  to  prove\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a woman who is an owner of a small shop.\r\n\r\nShe  has been running this shop for more than 20 years\r\n\r\nand  her  sons  were born in this country.  They  have\r\n\r\ngraduated from Nanyang University and are now  working\r\n\r\nas  teachers, When this woman applied for citizenship,\r\n\r\nher   application  was  rejected.  According  to   the\r\n\r\nMinister, only those people who can make contributions\r\n\r\nto  our economy will have their applications approved.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  this woman has made a contribution  to  our\r\n\r\neconomy.   Therefore,   her  application   should   be\r\n\r\nconsidered and approved by the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is that of a father whose children\r\n\r\nare  all citizens, except one son who was born outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.  When he applied for citizenship  for  this\r\n\r\nson,  he was informed that his son was a minor because\r\n\r\nhe  had not attained 21 years of age. He submitted the\r\n\r\napplication when his son was 19 years old,  but  until\r\n\r\nnow  the  application has not been approved.  This  is\r\n\r\nvery  unreasonable. Therefore, I agree with  what  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Delta has said that an advisory  committee\r\n\r\nshould  he  set  up  to  help solve  the  problems  of\r\n\r\napplicants for citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, on the question\r\n\r\nof  citizenship, I feel that very often  we  have  let\r\n\r\ndown\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  applicants, if a person fails to get citizenship,\r\n\r\nhe will come across many difficulties through no fault\r\n\r\nof his own. It is not that he is lazy that his applica\r\n\r\ntion  is  not  approved. I think  we  are  excessively\r\n\r\nstrict  in  considering applications  for  citizenship\r\n\r\nand, because of this, we cause delays. In my view,  as\r\n\r\nthere  are  a  large number of applications, we  must\r\n\r\nincrease the staff of the Registry of Citizenship.  We\r\n\r\nshould  also  invite the Minister for  Labour  to  see\r\n\r\nwhether  the staff at the Registry is working hard  or\r\n\r\nnot.

I quote from Hansard, Vol.\r\n\r\n27, No. 7 dated 21st May, 1968, column 345:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...the grant of citizenship is a matter of privilege\r\n\r\nand  not  of  right.  A person who has  the  necessary\r\n\r\nresidential  qualifications will not automatically  be\r\n\r\ngranted Singapore citizenship.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The Minister also said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In view of the run-down of the British forces and\r\n\r\nmounting unemployment, the Government has decided  not\r\n\r\nto  grant  citizenship as freely as in the  past.  The\r\n\r\nnumber  of cases that will be approved will now depend\r\n\r\nupon  our  economic position. A person who is  granted\r\n\r\ncitizenship   must  be  able  to   make   a   positive\r\n\r\ncontribution to the economic well-being of Singapore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the detailed complaints, I will try to answer\r\n\r\nthem as well as I can. The question of deprivation  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship  of  people of bad  character  and  so  on\r\n\r\nshould not be taken side by side with the granting  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship. I think the two do not belong to the same\r\n\r\ncategory.  On  the  one  hand, the  law  provides  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  machinery  to deprive  those  who  are  not\r\n\r\nworthy  to  be  citizens. But it does not  necessarily\r\n\r\nmean  that we replace that number with an equal number\r\n\r\nof people who are of good character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Why not?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> As regards children who were born\r\n\r\nin  Singapore on or after 17th March, 1967, to parents\r\n\r\nwho   are   non-citizens,  there  is   provision   for\r\n\r\nregistration.  If  such  parents  apply,  I  am   sure\r\n\r\nconsideration will be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the applicants who claim to be born in\r\n\r\nSingapore   but  who  do  not  possess  the  necessary\r\n\r\ndocumentary   evidence,  I  must  draw  the   Member's\r\n\r\nattention  again  to the Minister's statement  on  the\r\n\r\n10th  July in this House. I quote from Hansard, Volume\r\n\r\n27, No.9 dated 10th July, 1968, column 502:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'During the national registration exercise, it was\r\n\r\nrevealed that there were many people who claimed birth\r\n\r\nin  Singapore but who, on further investigation,  were\r\n\r\nfound  not be born in Singapore.

They  cannot  produce  birth\r\n\r\ncertificates or any other evidence of their  birth  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members may not be aware that during the\r\n\r\nnational  re-registration exercise, some  1,050  cases\r\n\r\ncame  to light in which the holders of identity  cards\r\n\r\nhad  used  other persons' Singapore birth certificates\r\n\r\nto claim Singapore birth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the man who marries a Singapore citizen,\r\n\r\nthere  is  nothing  to prevent him from  applying  for\r\n\r\ncitizenship    if   he   possesses    the    necessary\r\n\r\nqualifications tinder the relevant Article of the  Con\r\n\r\nstitution.

It  is\r\n\r\nalso  possible  to  register  a  person  born  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore as a Singapore citizen by descent if at  the\r\n\r\ntime  of  his  birth  his  father  was  a  citizen  of\r\n\r\nSingapore by birth or by registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to children who were born in Singapore of unknown\r\n\r\nor  unascertainable parentage, it is the  practice  to\r\n\r\nregard  such  children  as citizens  of  Singapore  by\r\n\r\nbirth, unless the contrary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  proved.

Of course,  each\r\n\r\ncase will be considered on its own merits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of setting up an advisory board to\r\n\r\nstudy  rejected  cases  was also  raised  by  Members.\r\n\r\nObviously  they are not aware that there  is  already,\r\n\r\nunder the Citizenship Ordinance, an advisory board  in\r\n\r\nexistence.  This Board does go through  all  cases  of\r\n\r\nrefusal  before  the applicants are  informed  of  the\r\n\r\nresult of the application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan says that we need more\r\n\r\nstaff  in  the Citizenship Registry.

But  as\r\n\r\nfor  the Minister for Labour visiting the registry,  I\r\n\r\ncan assure him that the registry is visited very often\r\n\r\nnot  by  the  Minister because he has got  many  other\r\n\r\nduties to perform, but by many other people under  him\r\n\r\nwho do that chore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the individual cases quoted by the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang, I do not think it will be fair  for  me  to\r\n\r\nanswer him here, But if he has any particular case  on\r\n\r\nwhich he thinks we have made a wrong judgment, he  can\r\n\r\nalways  write to me and I will look into it and advise\r\n\r\nhim accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary's\r\n\r\nanswer to the case of the non-citizen male who chooses\r\n\r\nto marry one of our charming citizens is not that neat\r\n\r\nand  simple.

I have no quarrel with\r\n\r\nthat policy, but my quarrel is with the application of\r\n\r\nthe  policy in respect of certain categories of people\r\n\r\nresident in Singapore applying for citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has outlined a number of\r\n\r\ncategories.  There  are  people  who  were   born   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  but,  at  the  time  of  registration,  the\r\n\r\nparents  were  faced  with  certain  difficulties   to\r\n\r\nregister the birth of their children. There is also  a\r\n\r\ncategory  of people who had resided in Singapore  long\r\n\r\nbefore  the talk of Singapore joining Malaysia.  There\r\n\r\nare  also  other categories of residents applying  for\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  The ordinary people who go  about  their\r\n\r\ndaily lives having to worry about earning a living are\r\n\r\nthe  people  who will become the victims of  a  policy\r\n\r\nthat the Government has formulated in the granting  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  The  Government is  not  to  be  blamed,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  has to worry about its citizens.  But  my\r\n\r\npoint is that there has got to be a certain degree  of\r\n\r\nlaxity in the application of this policy, because  the\r\n\r\nordinary  people find it difficult to understand  this\r\n\r\ncontradiction in granting citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who come here and are able to invest $250,000\r\n\r\nare  granted  citizenship without any difficulty.  The\r\n\r\nqualification  is  that  they can  contribute  to  the\r\n\r\neconomic  well-being of the country. In which  country\r\n\r\nhas  citizenship  been granted on  the  basis  that  a\r\n\r\nperson  must  he able to make an economic contribution\r\n\r\nto  the country? I think the most important point that\r\n\r\nwe  must  look for in granting citizenship is loyalty.\r\n\r\nSingapore  will be made a laughing stock  if  it  says\r\n\r\nthat   the  criterion  in  judging  whether  a  person\r\n\r\nqualifies  for  citizenship or not is the  ability  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  towards  the economic  well-being  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk of citizenship, the first thing that it\r\n\r\ndemands  from the person is loyalty. I think the  vast\r\n\r\nmajority of those who seek citizenship today are loyal\r\n\r\nand  have  considered Singapore their home.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nsurprise  to them that the Government does  not  grant\r\n\r\nthem  citizenship. Sir, it is in this respect that  we\r\n\r\nask   the  Government  to  be  more  humane   in   the\r\n\r\napplication of this policy. II: is only rational  that\r\n\r\nthe Government should have a policy in the granting of\r\n\r\ncitizenship  in  order  not to aggravate  the  present\r\n\r\nproblem   that   we  have  in  terms   of   employment\r\n\r\nopportunities  for citizens who are  already  flooding\r\n\r\nthe  unemploynlent market. It is well and good to have\r\n\r\na  policy  like  this. But, at the same  time,  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant for the Government to consider other factors\r\n\r\nin  respect  of  some of the residents who  have  been\r\n\r\nstaying  in Singapore for many, many years.  There  is\r\n\r\nalso  another  category of people  who  were  born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore but, because of special circumstances, birth\r\n\r\ncertificates were not obtained for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Government to consider\r\n\r\nthese points in granting citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI   fully  support  the  views  of  those  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  who  have  spoken on citizenship.  We  are\r\n\r\ngetting  a  lot  of  trouble and  headaches  from  our\r\n\r\nconstituents during the \"meet-the-people\" sessions  on\r\n\r\nthis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmatter.  I  think  even a large amount  of  Aspro  and\r\n\r\naspirin will not cure our headaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are fully aware that there are many unemployed\r\n\r\npersons  in  Singapore and therefore  jobs  should  be\r\n\r\ngiven to our citizens. But, on the other hand, we must\r\n\r\nsympathetically consider deserving cases.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nthey must meet the requirements of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During our \"meet-the-people\" sessions, the\r\n\r\nconstituents who are seeking citizenship tell us  very\r\n\r\nlong  stories. We take the trouble to record  all  the\r\n\r\ndetails  and  then  write  lengthy  letters   to   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Citizens, After going through  so  much\r\n\r\ntrouble, the reply is just an ordinary acknowledgement\r\n\r\ncard   which  says  the  application  is   under   con\r\n\r\nsideration. Then there will be a long silence - it may\r\n\r\nbe  three or six months. After this the person seeking\r\n\r\ncitizenship will he asked to call at the office almost\r\n\r\nevery  week. The officer will tell him to  be  patient\r\n\r\nand that a reply will be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Government must be very realistic on\r\n\r\nthis  issue.  They must be aware that all  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  should not be made to look stupid  in  the\r\n\r\neyes  of the public. I hope they will carefully review\r\n\r\nthe  policy of granting citizenship and lay down guide\r\n\r\nlines,  instead of letting Members of Parliament  help\r\n\r\nthese  people  and in the end we find  there  is  more\r\n\r\nfrustration among the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that foreigners who have $250,000 to invest\r\n\r\nhere  will  be  given special consideration  in  their\r\n\r\napplications for citizenship, and perhaps  citizenship\r\n\r\nwill  be  granted  to  them  speedily.  I  think  some\r\n\r\nconsideration should be given to the working class  as\r\n\r\nwell.  I  am quite sure, Sir, that in time of  war  or\r\n\r\nwhen  war is about to begin, the rich people  will  be\r\n\r\nthe  first to fly or sail away from Singapore.

During   the   Japanese   occupation   of\r\n\r\nSingapore, many of the rich people flew or sailed away\r\n\r\nfrom  Singapore. This is a well-known fact.  This  was\r\n\r\nreported in the newspapers of that period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make an appeal to the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  reconsider  the  policy  of   granting\r\n\r\ncitizenship and also bear in mind that we do not grant\r\n\r\ncitizenship  only to the rich people but also  to  the\r\n\r\nworking  class  as  well.

I  thought  I  had   better\r\n\r\nintervene at this stage!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the difficulties of Members of Parliament\r\n\r\nshould be the least of our considerations. Most of the\r\n\r\nMembers  who  spoke have been trying to  persuade  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to change its policies in regard to a  very\r\n\r\nimportant subject like citizenship, apparently on  the\r\n\r\nground that it creates difficulties for them and makes\r\n\r\nthem  unpopular. I am also a Member of  Parliament.  I\r\n\r\nalso  happen to be the Minister in charge  of  citizenship \r\n\r\nand I do get bothered by people who come and tell\r\n\r\nme that they made\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplications for citizenship two, three or five  years\r\n\r\nago.  If you are a Member of Parliament, your duty  is\r\n\r\nnot  to get popular but to enforce the law to see that\r\n\r\nyou  do  things  in  the  interest  of  Singapore.   1\r\n\r\nsympathise  with  Members of  Parliament  who  are  in\r\n\r\ndifficulties -being one myself - but that  should  not\r\n\r\nhe the criterion on which we make decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members who spoke got worked up. The Minister\r\n\r\nfor Culture was going to intervene and explain. If  he\r\n\r\nhad  been allowed to do so, I think hon. Members might\r\n\r\nnot   have  heard  some  of  the  things  they  heard,\r\n\r\nespecially from the Member for Bukit Ho Swee. First of\r\n\r\nall,  anybody  who invests $250,000 in Singapore  does\r\n\r\nnot  get  citizenship.  He  gets  right  of  permanent\r\n\r\nresidence.  So  I think all this oratory  about, poor\r\n\r\npeople not getting citizenship and rich people getting\r\n\r\ncitizenship  is singularly ill-informed.  Let  me  say\r\n\r\nthat  when  somebody  invests $250,000  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nmaybe  10, 20, 30 or 40 Singaporeans get jobs. If  any\r\n\r\nof  the  hon.  Members - especially  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nMembers - suggest that we should stop giving permanent\r\n\r\nresidence, will they say categorically that  permanent\r\n\r\nresidence  should  not  be given  to  people  who  are\r\n\r\nprepared to invest $250,000 here and who provide  jobs\r\n\r\nfor  maybe  a  few hundred persons? I think  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant point to realise - I reiterate what  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid before - is that, on humanitarian grounds, it  is\r\n\r\ngood  to  give citizenship to everybody who  has  been\r\n\r\nhere  for  ten years or who qualifies for citizenship.\r\n\r\nBut  for  every one who is made a citizen,  there  are\r\n\r\nother liabilities. The moment a man becomes a citizen,\r\n\r\nhe  is  entitled  to free education, housing,  medical\r\n\r\nattention,  employment, a vote and to  social  welfare\r\n\r\nassistance.   So   every  citizen   who   is   granted\r\n\r\ncitizenship  is a liability to our society.  It  means\r\n\r\ncoming back here for money to finance our new citizens\r\n\r\nwho  need not have become citizens, I quite sympathise\r\n\r\nwith  many  of the difficulties that some  people  are\r\n\r\nconfronted  with as a result of our strict enforcement\r\n\r\nof the citizenship law, but we do so in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe interest of the majority. Sometimes the choice  is\r\n\r\nbetween  two unpleasant things and I will,  therefore,\r\n\r\nmake  the  choice  in  favour of the  less  unpleasant\r\n\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards applications for citizenship that are\r\n\r\nmade and are not acknowledged or answered, I will  say\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  a  source  of  hope.  The  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary did say that it may be due to a shortage  of\r\n\r\nstaff. But I will say that it is not really due  to  a\r\n\r\nshortage  of staff. Even if we increase the  staff,  a\r\n\r\nlot of applications will still be under consideration,\r\n\r\nand  for  a  good  reason, because if they  are  under\r\n\r\nconsideration,  there  is  a  possibility  that   when\r\n\r\nconditions  change  or  when  circumstances  make   it\r\n\r\npossible  for  us  to  allow  more  people  to  become\r\n\r\ncitizens,  we  will  do  so, lf the  applications  are\r\n\r\nrejected,  that  is that. So, as a matter  of  policy,\r\n\r\nmany of the applications are kept under consideration,\r\n\r\nbecause  if  between now and the next few years,  say,\r\n\r\nafter   the  withdrawal  of  the  British  forces   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   we   find  that  the  economic   problems\r\n\r\nassociated  with  the British withdrawal  are  not  as\r\n\r\ndisastrous as they were thought to be, we will be more\r\n\r\ngenerous  to  those people who have made  applications\r\n\r\nfor  citizenship  which have been under  consideration\r\n\r\nfor  three or four years. But if we give a reply  now,\r\n\r\nthat means they are out. So the reason why no decision\r\n\r\nhas  been  taken on many of the applications  is  that\r\n\r\nmaybe  in three, four or five years' time, it  may  be\r\n\r\npossible  to grant citizenship to those whom we  would\r\n\r\nbe compelled to reject now, if we feel that conditions\r\n\r\nhave improved and we can take them in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also say, in this connection, that quite a\r\n\r\nlarge  proportion of applications for citizenship  are\r\n\r\nmade  by  people who could have applied  five  or  six\r\n\r\nyears  ago when citizenship was granted more  readily.\r\n\r\nAt  that time, they kept their options open. Now  they\r\n\r\nhave decided. And, therefore, when people now say that\r\n\r\nthey  are  loyal, yes, many of them may be loyal.  But\r\n\r\nsome  of  them are what I call \"rice-eating citizens\",\r\n\r\nbecause  they  kept their options open, and  they  now\r\n\r\ncome and pester some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers  of Parliament as the options are now  closed.\r\n\r\nVery  often, they have come to me - in fact, too  many\r\n\r\nof   them.   Many  of  them  come  from  the  Members'\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  They make inquiries and  they  always\r\n\r\nsay  this, \"But I must have my citizenship now because\r\n\r\nI  cannot get a job.\" Some of them are of an age  when\r\n\r\nthey  could have applied for citizenship five  or  six\r\n\r\nyears   ago  when  things  looked  a  bit  dicey   for\r\n\r\nSingapore. Then they kept their options open. Now that\r\n\r\nthings  are better, they want U' press for citizenship\r\n\r\nand  the rights that go with it. Therefore, let us not\r\n\r\nbe  too  sentimental about this picture that is  drawn\r\n\r\nabout  poor people who can be loyal citizens  and  who\r\n\r\nare  now enduring hardship. If things are not as  good\r\n\r\nas  they are today, I think you will find less  demand\r\n\r\nfor   citizenship,  less  pestering  of   Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, first, let me say, if things improve - and I\r\n\r\nhope  we  will review this year by year - and we  feel\r\n\r\nthat we can give citizenship to those people from whom\r\n\r\nwe  now  withhold citizenship, we will do  so.  But  I\r\n\r\nthink it will be disastrous if, purely on humanitarian\r\n\r\ngrounds,   we  open  the  doors,  Though  Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament  may  be able to satisfy a small  minority,\r\n\r\nthe  consequences of opening the gate may be such that\r\n\r\nthey   will  find  themselves  confronted  with  other\r\n\r\nproblems  of  mounting unemployment for citizens  who,\r\n\r\nincidentally, are already voters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, though I sympathise with some of the\r\n\r\ndifficulties of Members of Parliament and with some of\r\n\r\nthe   hardships  undoubtedly  created  for  many  non-\r\n\r\ncitizens as a result of our strict enforcement of  the\r\n\r\ncitizenship policy, in the long run, it is a matter of\r\n\r\nbalancing the interest of the majority against that of\r\n\r\nthe  minority.  For the time being, we  will  have  to\r\n\r\nadhere to and protect the interest of the majority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo and Mr P.

Seven months have now elapsed since May  this\r\n\r\nyear  when  the  policy  statement  on  education  was\r\n\r\nannounced  at the beginning of this session.  On  12th\r\n\r\nDecember,  when we were debating the Budget  for  next\r\n\r\nyear,  we  learnt from the speech of the Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  that  his  Ministry had  prepared  well  in\r\n\r\nadvance  a comprehensive policy on education  for  the\r\n\r\ncoming years ahead. Thus, many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblems  will  be  solved,  Many  worries  which  are\r\n\r\npresent  in  our  society  will  be  swept  away.  The\r\n\r\ndevelopment of education has now reached a new  phase.\r\n\r\nWe are now implementing a new policy, a reformation in\r\n\r\neducation,  so that the products of our  schools  will\r\n\r\nnot lind themselves unemployed and can do nothing with\r\n\r\nwhat they have learnt after they leave school. Our new\r\n\r\neducation policy will enable our graduates to  make  a\r\n\r\ncontribution to our society. It is thus a good policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum to be allocated to the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nis  about  $200 million. This is a very large  sum  of\r\n\r\nmoney  and  second  only to defence expenditure.  This\r\n\r\nlarge  allocation  will help to produce  more  capable\r\n\r\nmen.  We will have more people who can perform various\r\n\r\ntasks  and take part in activities which will  improve\r\n\r\nour  society. We will thus be able to meet the  coming\r\n\r\nchanging situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our new education policy will give rise to\r\n\r\nsome  other  matters which need to be considered.  And\r\n\r\nhere   I   would  like  to  give  my  views  for   the\r\n\r\nconsideration of the Minister for Education,  Firstly,\r\n\r\nin  order  to ensure that our school leavers  will  be\r\n\r\nabsorbed  by  our  rapidly developing industries,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education should maintain close  liaison\r\n\r\nwith the industrial sector. In this way, a proper  and\r\n\r\nregular  review can be made of the curriculum  of  our\r\n\r\ntechnical  and vocational education in order  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe  changing  needs of our society.  In  my  view,  a\r\n\r\npermanent  agency should be set up in the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation,   comprising   representatives   from   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education, the Ministry of  Labour,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance, and the industrial and commercial\r\n\r\nsectors  in  order  to look after  the  workers.  This\r\n\r\nagency  will  plan and look after the  employment  pro\r\n\r\nblems of our school leavers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in promoting technical and vocational\r\n\r\neducation, we must not overlook the cultural aspect of\r\n\r\neducation. Education has two aims, One is cultural and\r\n\r\nthe other social. We must be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nable  to look after both aspects of education  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time.  Overemphasis on technical and  vocational\r\n\r\neducation  at  the expense of the cultural  aspect  of\r\n\r\neducation  will  result  in the  production  of  human\r\n\r\nrobots  in  our  school  leavers.  This  is  certainly\r\n\r\nagainst  the  principle of education. It  defeats  the\r\n\r\npurpose of education, for the aim of education is also\r\n\r\nto make a cultured man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the present scheme for the training of\r\n\r\nteachers in technical and vocational subjects  is  not\r\n\r\nto  be  corn-mended. The courses are given on a  part-\r\n\r\ntime  basis.  After the teachers have gone  through  a\r\n\r\nhard  day's work, they are probably exhausted  and  by\r\n\r\nthe  time  they  go  into  the class-rooms  for  their\r\n\r\ncourse,  they  have  no energy left  and  are  in  low\r\n\r\nspirits. In these circumstances, the teachers whom  it\r\n\r\nis  hoped  to produce instantly will not  be  able  to\r\n\r\nundertake the responsibility of training the  students\r\n\r\nin  technical  and vocational subjects.  The  training\r\n\r\ncourses  must  be  on the same basis as  the  training\r\n\r\ncourses  being  conducted by the Economic  Development\r\n\r\nBoard.  The  teachers must be given full-time  courses\r\n\r\nand  enough time to go through the theoretical as well\r\n\r\nas  the practical aspects of their training. They must\r\n\r\nbe  given  opportunities to do practical work  in  the\r\n\r\nfactories or workshops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, as from next year all male students from\r\n\r\nSecondary I and Secondary II, as well as 50  per  cent\r\n\r\nof  the female students from Secondary I and Secondary\r\n\r\nII, are required to do three hours' practical work  in\r\n\r\nthe  workshop. This means that our students will  have\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity of doing some practical work in their\r\n\r\nvocational  and technical education. However,  I  have\r\n\r\nsome  misgivings about the position of those who  have\r\n\r\ntalent  in painting, drawing and music. I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  provision  will  be  made  to  exempt   these\r\n\r\nstudents from attending such courses. Through  such  a\r\n\r\ncourse,  Singapore  will in time be  able  to  produce\r\n\r\nmusicians  comparable to the talented Fou  Ts'ong  the\r\n\r\nwell-known Chinese pianist. At the same time, it is my\r\n\r\nhope also that, in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naddition to domestic science, female students would be\r\n\r\ngiven the opportunity to take up other subjects,  such\r\n\r\nas sewing, typing, book-keeping, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, as from next year, students in Secondary I\r\n\r\nwill   be   given  three  extra  hours  for  technical\r\n\r\ntraining.  In  my  view, the teachers responsible  for\r\n\r\nsuch  training  should not be included  in  the  quota\r\n\r\nallowed  for  teachers.  Otherwise  it  would  greatly\r\n\r\nincrease  the  teaching load of the  teachers.  It  is\r\n\r\npossible  that  the teachers may have  to  take  seven\r\n\r\nteaching  periods  a day. This is  too  much  for  any\r\n\r\nefficient teaching to be successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, as a result of the reforms we are bringing\r\n\r\nabout  in secondary education, the study load  of  our\r\n\r\nstudents  will definitely increase, not only in  terms\r\n\r\nof  subjects  but  also in terms  of  learning  hours.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the students will not be  able  to  cope\r\n\r\nwith their subjects. In my view, although they may  be\r\n\r\nrequired  to  learn as many subjects as possible,  the\r\n\r\nexamination  subjects should be reduced  so  that  the\r\n\r\nstudy load of the students may be reduced. At the same\r\n\r\ntime,  I  wish to appeal for the abolition of the  Cam\r\n\r\nbridge  School Certificate Examination. It  should  be\r\n\r\nreplaced by a local examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now wish to go on to a new subject. This is in respect of school inspection. As far as I know, there have been recent appointments made of inspectors of schools. However, in the final analysis, the confirmation of promotion or the extension of service of teachers is handled by the\r\n\r\nprincipals themselves. I cannot see the merits of this\r\n\r\nsystem. Rather, I see many disadvantages. In the first\r\n\r\nplace, not all principals are properly trained in  the\r\n\r\nSchool  Inspectorate. They are actually  outsiders  as\r\n\r\nfar  as  school inspection is concerned. As a  result,\r\n\r\nthey  are  doing  a slipshod job. What  is  even  more\r\n\r\nridiculous  is  that  some  principals  who  are   not\r\n\r\nconversant in the second language are asked to observe\r\n\r\nthe   teaching  of  the  second  language.  After  the\r\n\r\nobservation, they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  ask a senior teacher to make a report.  This  is\r\n\r\nridiculous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excessive powers given to the principals also\r\n\r\ngive  rise to some other effects. Moreover, the duties\r\n\r\nof  school  inspection will add to the burden  of  the\r\n\r\nprincipals. As a result, their other duties will  have\r\n\r\nto  be  performed by some other teachers.  And  it  is\r\n\r\nusually  the senior teachers who have to take  on  the\r\n\r\nextra load. The work of school inspection is part  and\r\n\r\nparcel  of the education system. It should be done  by\r\n\r\nproperly  trained people in order to get  the  desired\r\n\r\nresults,  so  that  the  teachers  and  students  will\r\n\r\nbenefit.  I hope the Minister will review the  present\r\n\r\nsystem of school inspection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the 12th of this month, the Minister for Education made a clear statement that great changes will take place in respect of the teaching of the second language. The result will be that a truly multilingual and multiracial society will emerge from this policy. I hope this policy will\r\n\r\nsucceed.  We  do  need  a  great  many  bilingual  and\r\n\r\nmultilingual people in our society. This is  not  only\r\n\r\nuseful in the field of human relationship but is  also\r\n\r\nan  advantage in finding employment for our  citizens.\r\n\r\nAs  the  Minister  has pointed out, in  the  past  the\r\n\r\nteaching  of the second language was confined  to  the\r\n\r\nlanguage  itself.  All that we  tried  to  do  was  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  teaching time and improve the  teaching\r\n\r\nmethods.  In  his view, this was not enough.  I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  him. We must go beyond the normal teaching hours\r\n\r\nfor  the  second language and give our  children  more\r\n\r\nopportunity to learn it. We have used English  as  the\r\n\r\nsecond  language  in the teaching of  Mathematics  and\r\n\r\nother science subjects. We have used Chinese, Malay or\r\n\r\nTamil  as  the  second language  in  the  teaching  of\r\n\r\nGeography  and History - subjects which are  connected\r\n\r\nwith culture and language. In my view, this policy  is\r\n\r\npraiseworthy.  But  we must not  try  to  hurry  these\r\n\r\nthings  in  view  of  the problems still  existing  in\r\n\r\nconnection with teachers and textbooks. If we try to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrush  through things before these problems are solved,\r\n\r\nwe will not be able to get the desired result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also noted the possibility of using the second language as a medium of instruction in other subjects. He said that, according to a survey in Primary I, the result shows that the standard of the second language will not be lowered and the teaching of the subject in which the language is used as a\r\n\r\nmedium of instruction will not be lowered. But  if  he\r\n\r\nwere  to  make a survey, say, in Secondary I, probably\r\n\r\nhe will not be able to get as good a result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since we are trying to build a rugged society,\r\n\r\nwe  must place emphasis on extracurricular activities.\r\n\r\nI  fully  support  this policy.  But  there  are  many\r\n\r\ndefects  in the present system. As a result,  we  have\r\n\r\nnot been able to -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Even with the  increase  in\r\n\r\ndefence  expenditure amounting to  $375  million,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education still ranks  second  in  total\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  This  means that  we  are  paying  equal\r\n\r\nattention  to  education and are  able  to  train  our\r\n\r\nyouths  for  various jobs. This is the  proper  course\r\n\r\nthat we should take.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very few countries in Asia which have a\r\n\r\nhigh  rate  of  literacy.

In   1960,   we\r\n\r\nswitched our attention to technical education  and  we\r\n\r\nare also aiming at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nturning  out  people who are rugged and patriotic.  In\r\n\r\nthis respect, I wish to raise several points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I wish to talk on technical education. Most\r\n\r\nof the Secondary I and II students will come under the\r\n\r\ntechnical  education scheme. But, as far  as  I  know,\r\n\r\nthere  are not enough teachers who are able  to  teach\r\n\r\ntechnical subjects. I do not know how the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation  proposes  to  deal  with  the  shortage  of\r\n\r\ntechnical teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, some 50 to 60 Government-aided schools in\r\n\r\nthe Chinese stream will be using English as the medium\r\n\r\nof  instruction  in Mathematics and science  subjects.\r\n\r\nWhat  arrangements  will  be  made  for  the  teachers\r\n\r\nrequired  in  this respect? Are the existing  teachers\r\n\r\ncompetent  to  teach  their  students  in  the  second\r\n\r\nlanguage all of a sudden? There may not be any problem\r\n\r\nfor Primary I and II. But from Primary III onwards,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  teachers  should  be  retrained  for   the\r\n\r\npurpose,  and such retraining should start immediately\r\n\r\nso that they will be able to teach the higher classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point concerns the use of English in the\r\n\r\nteaching   of  Mathematics  and  Science  in   Chinese\r\n\r\nGovernment-aided  schools.  There   is   an   expected\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the number of teachers and,  because  of\r\n\r\nthis,  there  may  be a surplus of  teachers  in  some\r\n\r\nschools. What will become of this surplus of teachers?\r\n\r\nSome  of  them  are quite old. Will  they  be  retired\r\n\r\nprematurely?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in some aided-schools, the number of students\r\n\r\nis  decreasing, thereby resulting in the  transfer  of\r\n\r\nsome  teachers to other schools. Is there  any  policy\r\n\r\ngoverning such transfers? Is it on the last-come-first-\r\n\r\ngo  basis?  To my knowledge, this policy is not  being\r\n\r\nfollowed.  The  transfers are being done  at  the  dis\r\n\r\ncretion of the principals who, if they like the  faces\r\n\r\nof  some  teachers,  retain them.  Some  teachers  are\r\n\r\ntransferred  because  they  are  not  liked   by   the\r\n\r\nprincipals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Sir, I wish to\r\n\r\nappeal  to the Minister for Education to abolish  the\r\n\r\nSaturday classes for the English stream. As far as  I\r\n\r\ncan  make  out,  the school children go  to  Saturday\r\n\r\nclasses  about twice a month for reasons  unknown  to\r\n\r\nme.  They deserve our sympathy. I cannot somehow  get\r\n\r\nthe impression that the children profit in any way by\r\n\r\ngoing  to Saturday classes. Sending poor children  to\r\n\r\nSaturday  classes is an item of considerable  expense\r\n\r\nto  poor  parents and it is also a waste of time  not\r\n\r\nonly to the school children but also to the teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,I support the\r\n\r\nstatement of the Member for Jurong when he asked  for\r\n\r\nthe   abolition   of  the  Senior  Cambridge   School\r\n\r\nCertificate  Examination and its replacement  by  our\r\n\r\nlocally-conducted examination. As we are now  indepen\r\n\r\ndent,  we  should  not  rely on  other  countries  to\r\n\r\nconduct  examinations for us. Otherwise,  what  about\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  School Certificate Examination?  Do  we\r\n\r\nhave  to rely on Peking for this? If we do not,  then\r\n\r\nwe  do  not have to depend on England to conduct  the\r\n\r\nSchool Certificate Examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point concerns our education policy. I\r\n\r\nhave been told that the number of schools to be built\r\n\r\nnext year will be reduced. If less schools are to  be\r\n\r\nbuilt  next  year, where are we going to  accommodate\r\n\r\nthe  new  students? In my view, we should build  more\r\n\r\nschools  next year because the student population  is\r\n\r\nincreasing.  Actually we have  planned  to  build  17\r\n\r\nschools  every  year - 12 primary  schools  and  five\r\n\r\nsecondary schools. Are we changing this policy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the opinion that the Minister for Education\r\n\r\nshould instruct the big civic organisations like  the\r\n\r\nhuay   kuan  to  start  their  school  building  fund\r\n\r\ncampaign. Government should also allot state land  to\r\n\r\nthese organisations for the building of schools.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  we  can  build more schools  in  Anson  con\r\n\r\nstituency as there are vacant pieces of land there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, first, I must thank the various Members\r\n\r\nfor their appreciation of the education policy of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  as  well  as their  appreciation  of  the\r\n\r\nproblems that we are facing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to deal first with the points raised by the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Jurong.  On  the question  of  technical\r\n\r\neducation,  he  says that we must keep close  contact\r\n\r\nwith  the commercial and industrial sectors, In fact,\r\n\r\nthis is what we are doing. At the present moment,  we\r\n\r\nare   in  the  process  of  setting  up  an  advisory\r\n\r\ncommittee  on  technical and vocational education  to\r\n\r\nconsider all the related problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the social and cultural aspects of\r\n\r\neducation,  the  Member for Jurong should  not  worry\r\n\r\nbecause  a  change  in emphasis does  not  alter  the\r\n\r\nprinciple of education, We only wish to convert  one-\r\n\r\nthird  of  our  students to technical education.  The\r\n\r\nmain  point  in  our  reform is  that  our  secondary\r\n\r\nstudents  will have at least eight years  of  general\r\n\r\neducation in which they must have learnt enough about\r\n\r\nculture, language, literature, art and some technical\r\n\r\nsubjects. The principle of education is not  affected\r\n\r\nby our emphasis on technical education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several Members have raised the question of\r\n\r\nshortage  of  technical teachers,  According  to  our\r\n\r\nEstimates, when the changes are completed by 1970, we\r\n\r\nrequire  700  to  800  technical  teachers  to  teach\r\n\r\nSecondary  I and II students, At the present  moment,\r\n\r\nwe  have about 300 teachers undergoing training. Next\r\n\r\nyear, we propose to introduce the change at Secondary\r\n\r\nI  only.  Therefore, we need only half the number  of\r\n\r\nteachers  required. So there is no  question  of  any\r\n\r\nshortage of teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards part-time courses for teachers, in my\r\n\r\nview,  this  is  not  a serious problem  because  the\r\n\r\nteachers can still cope with the training done  on  a\r\n\r\npart-time  basis.  All along, trainee  teachers  have\r\n\r\nbeen  attending  lectures on a part-time  basis.  Yet\r\n\r\nthey have been able to cope with the teaching\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nload  as  well as extracurricular activities.  At  the\r\n\r\npresent  moment, we have about 80 teachers  undergoing\r\n\r\nfull-time training in technical education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the changes to be introduced in\r\n\r\nSecondary  I  and  II, we have given consideration  to\r\n\r\nstudents  who  are  talented  in  the  fine  arts.  If\r\n\r\nstudents  are considered to be talented  in  the  fine\r\n\r\narts, they will be exempted from attending three hours\r\n\r\nper week workshop practice, provided that the teachers\r\n\r\nare satisfied that the students are gifted in the fine\r\n\r\narts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference has been made to the speech of the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Education on the  12th  of  this  month\r\n\r\nregarding  the compulsory attendance of girl  students\r\n\r\nat  domestic science classes. Only 50 per cent of  the\r\n\r\ngirl  students will be affected. I have  already  said\r\n\r\nthat   we   need  only  800  teachers  for   technical\r\n\r\neducation.  This is only four per cent of  the  20,000\r\n\r\nteacher  population.  Therefore,  there  will  be   no\r\n\r\nrepercussions.  The  number of technical  teachers  re\r\n\r\nquired  for the secondary schools is small because  we\r\n\r\nare  not  fully implementing the changes at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of school inspection, I am of the\r\n\r\nview that principals should have some authority in the\r\n\r\nmethods of teaching. I think they are competent to  do\r\n\r\nthis  job,  because they have been teachers themselves\r\n\r\nin  the past. If there are cases where the work of the\r\n\r\nprincipals  is  slipshod and if  further  details  are\r\n\r\nsupplied, we will investigate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech earlier the Minister for Education has\r\n\r\nalready  made  clear the Government's  policy  on  the\r\n\r\nteaching  of  the  second language.  The  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation is now getting ready to prepare for a two to\r\n\r\nthree-year  period  of special training  in  order  to\r\n\r\nenable teachers in the non-English language streams to\r\n\r\nmake the change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of text-books, I have to point\r\n\r\nout that at the present moment, before the changes are\r\n\r\nimplemented, many schools, particularly the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChinese  schools,  are  using  English  textbooks   in\r\n\r\nScience and Mathematics. So there is no problem  about\r\n\r\ntext-books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the points raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang. The point concerning technical teachers has\r\n\r\nalready been covered by me when I answered the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Jurong. On the question of redundancy of teachers,\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Education has made it very clear that\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  dedicated and  can  carry  out  their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  properly  will  be   given   special\r\n\r\nconsideration when the question of redundancy  arises.\r\n\r\nThose  who are not dedicated teachers may be  affected\r\n\r\nby the redundancy exercise,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the decreasing number of students in aided\r\n\r\nschools, resulting in transfers of teachers,  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  transfers are based on the subjects the  teachers\r\n\r\nare  capable of teaching. The principle of \"last come,\r\n\r\nfirst  go\" is not strictly adhered to because  of  the\r\n\r\nneed for subject teachers. If the Member for Sembawang\r\n\r\nhas  got  any  special cases in mind, he can  give  me\r\n\r\nfurther details and I will look into the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the point raised by the Member for Joo\r\n\r\nChiat  about half-day classes on Saturdays.  Not  very\r\n\r\nlong ago Chinese schools had a six-day week. Now,  the\r\n\r\nattendance  on  Saturdays is required  for  extramural\r\n\r\nactivities or if there are special circumstances where\r\n\r\nthe  principal  or  the teacher is of  the  view  that\r\n\r\nspecial  classes are necessary on Saturdays.  In  this\r\n\r\nway  the  burden will not fall mainly on  the  parents\r\n\r\nbecause it is better for the students to attend school\r\n\r\nrather than roam about the streets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Members have raised the question of abolishing\r\n\r\nthe  Senior  Cambridge Examination.  The  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation is now actively considering this matter  but\r\n\r\nthere  are  technical problems which cannot be  solved\r\n\r\novernight.  Therefore, we require some  more  time  to\r\n\r\nconsider  this matter and I do not think this  is  the\r\n\r\nproper  time to make a decision yet. We will  give  an\r\n\r\nanswer when the time comes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan asked what will become of\r\n\r\nthe increasing number of students if fewer schools are\r\n\r\nbeing  built.  I  do not think this  problem  is  very\r\n\r\nserious because of our success in family planning, and\r\n\r\ntherefore  our  population growth will  be  less.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  the  enrolment  of Primary  I  students  has\r\n\r\ndecreased this year compared with last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of contributions by the public to\r\n\r\nthe  building  of schools, the Ministry  of  Education\r\n\r\nwill  give  them all the necessary help and facilities\r\n\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  you are aware  that  I  have  not\r\n\r\nfinished with my speech on education.

And in the\r\n\r\nfinal  analysis,  it is the content of  the  education\r\n\r\nthat  we  provide our young today which will determine\r\n\r\ntheir respor~ses and reactions tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I may add that I am not holding a watching\r\n\r\nbrief for the teaching profession in this Chamber  and\r\n\r\nI  do  not intend to do so. But I am anxious that  our\r\n\r\neducation system succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short space of ten years, our education\r\n\r\nsystem was adjusted as a result of:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the implementation of the recommendations of\r\n\r\nthe  all-Party Report on Chinese  Education  in 1958;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the acceptance of Malay as the national\r\n\r\nlanguage;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the policy of integration through integrated\r\n\r\nschools and bilingualism;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) the emphasis on Science and Mathematics;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) the implementation of some of the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of  the Commission  of  Enquiry\r\n\r\ninto  Vocational  and  Technical  Education in 1961;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) the implementation of a few recommendations\r\n\r\nby  the Lim Tay Boh Commission of Inquiry  into\r\n\r\nEducation; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) the impact of independence which accentuated\r\n\r\nthe need for us to be rugged and to be equipped\r\n\r\nwith  all  the  proper and  requisite  reflexes\r\n\r\nwhich  a  people who are determined to  survive\r\n\r\nmust have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes and adjustments did come rapidly one\r\n\r\nafter  the  other  in  the space of  ten  years.  They\r\n\r\ncreated many problems' which the administrators had to\r\n\r\nsolve  by  reason  of the rapidity  with  which  these\r\n\r\nproblems  came  on  an  ad hoc  basis  which  in  turn\r\n\r\nresulted   in  more  complications.  Meanwhile,   more\r\n\r\nschools  were built and more children went to  schools\r\n\r\nand  more  teachers were appointed. So  more  problems\r\n\r\ncame  in  a rush which were necessarily dealt with  ad\r\n\r\nhoc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rate and extent of expansion virtually caused a\r\n\r\nbottle-neck in the administration out-channels, and ex\r\n\r\nplains why the administration perhaps had to call  for\r\n\r\nreturns after returns from schools, a telephone  relay\r\n\r\nsystem   had  to  be  set  up  for  rapid  information\r\n\r\ntransmission,  teachers had to be  transferred  at  an\r\n\r\ninstant's  notice and administrative work  had  to  be\r\n\r\npiled upon the teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today we have restructured our education system.\r\n\r\nThe  restructuring  is extensive in  scope,  involving\r\n\r\nprimary,  secondary, technical, tertiary  and  teacher\r\n\r\neducation which I hope is a final restructuring and is\r\n\r\nintended  to  describe  in perspective  our  education\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now I say, let the administration in the Ministry\r\n\r\nstop  solving problems on an ad hoc basis. Our pattern\r\n\r\nof   the   education  system  is  now  set  for   some\r\n\r\npermanence. Let problems be solved in the  context  of\r\n\r\nthe  whole system. Let there be a continuous grasp  of\r\n\r\nthe system as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the structure is set, the administration\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to  view the system in  comprehension,\r\n\r\nanticipate  complexities  and  resolve  them   in   co\r\n\r\nordination   with   other   ancillary   administrative\r\n\r\nfunctions and the profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This urges me to reiterate the call which I made in\r\n\r\nthe  debate  on  the President's Speech  earlier  this\r\n\r\nyear.  Our  education system must contain  a  research\r\n\r\nbody  of  sufficient scope to undertake effectively  a\r\n\r\ncontinuous, thinking on the effects  of  the  present\r\n\r\nrestructuring of the education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Minister that teachers, must\r\n\r\nrespond  to  the  challenge if  we  are  to  make  our\r\n\r\nrestructured system succeed. The profession can make a\r\n\r\ntremendous  contribution to the country if its  effort\r\n\r\nis  developed  into a cohesive teaching  power  imbued\r\n\r\nwith  the aims and purposes of education, as  we  have\r\n\r\nrestructured it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this, the administration should consider\r\n\r\ntwo  courses  of  action.  First,  it  should  make  a\r\n\r\nstatement  of these aims and purposes. The  priorities\r\n\r\nin  education must be arranged and inculcated  in  the\r\n\r\nprofession  to the extent that they become  the  basic\r\n\r\nmotivations of its entire teaching effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the administration carry out the exercise of\r\n\r\nensuring that every single teacher and school-head has\r\n\r\na  precise understanding and appreciation of the' aims\r\n\r\nand purposes of the new system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I say, in the name of education, let this not be\r\n\r\ndone  through  circulars  or other  forms  of  blunted\r\n\r\nadministrative insistence,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the teaching profession must be accepted\r\n\r\nfor  what  it  is a profession. At this point  in  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  education, the country  requires  the\r\n\r\ntotal  and  enthusiastic commitment  of  the  teaching\r\n\r\nprofession to the aims and purposes of the system. Let\r\n\r\nthere  not  be instead a move to squeeze  out  of  the\r\n\r\nteaching body an effort which is nothing more  than  a\r\n\r\nservice. Not only will it be insufficient, but it  may\r\n\r\neven  be  dangerous, because the teaching  body  is  a\r\n\r\nprofession and it is not a service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching is vocational essentially.

I am not convinced that as a  form  of\r\n\r\ncharacter  education, these lessons in ethics  are  a~\r\n\r\neffective  as the teachers' impromptu and  spontaneous\r\n\r\nreferences to moral principles of personal and  social\r\n\r\nconduct in the course of a lesson, say, in History  or\r\n\r\nLiterature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, character education is the sum total of\r\n\r\na   teacher's   involvement   with   the   personality\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  his pupils through  his  sincere  and\r\n\r\nintelligent  exemplification  of  character   in   the\r\n\r\nordinary living of individuals in a society or nation,\r\n\r\nhis   pupils'   responses  and  the   management   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment of these responses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to attend to this aspect of education\r\n\r\nespecially  now when we are going technological  in  a\r\n\r\nbig way and when opportunities for character education\r\n\r\nin teaching are nil or much less in a lesson, say, for\r\n\r\nexample, in industrial designing than in history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of it, our system must produce\r\n\r\nessentially the homo sapien, the human being with  his\r\n\r\npersonal, social and moral responses. Let us not have,\r\n\r\nin  his  stead, the techno sapien, if I may be allowed\r\n\r\nto concoct a term.

Firstly,\r\n\r\nI  wish  to  draw the attention of the  House  to  the\r\n\r\ncomplaints  of  parents who are in receipt  of  public\r\n\r\nassistance.  Students of these parents  were  informed\r\n\r\nnot very long ago that they would have to pay half the\r\n\r\n\"Miscellaneous\" fees when, in fact, they did not  have\r\n\r\nto  do so in the past. The \"Miscellaneous\" fee was  $1\r\n\r\nfor  a primary student and $2 for a secondary student.\r\n\r\nIn  the  past, children of parents who were in receipt\r\n\r\nof  public  assistance were exempted from  payment  of\r\n\r\nthese  fees. As far as I know, these people  are  very\r\n\r\npoor  and  the  amount of public assistance  given  is\r\n\r\nsmall.  Therefore, they should continue to be exempted\r\n\r\nfrom  payment of these fees. I hope the Minister  will\r\n\r\ngive sympathetic consideration to this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is in respect of the transfers of\r\n\r\nstudents  which will take place next year. I hope  the\r\n\r\nofficials  in  the  Ministry of  Education  will  make\r\n\r\nproper arrangements for the transfer of students  from\r\n\r\none  school to another. Students should not be  posted\r\n\r\nto  schools very far from their homes, otherwise  this\r\n\r\nwould  result in a greater financial burden  on  their\r\n\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I wish to refer to the flag-raising ceremony\r\n\r\nin  the  morning and in the afternoon which  is  being\r\n\r\nperformed in the schools. I have noticed over a period\r\n\r\nof  two years that in some schools the students do not\r\n\r\ntake this ceremony seriously. Probably this is due  to\r\n\r\nthe failure of the teachers to explain to the students\r\n\r\nthe  significance of the flag-raising ceremony. I hope\r\n\r\nthe Ministry officials will look into this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, I wonder whether the Minister for Education\r\n\r\nwill   consider  introducing  a  uniform  of  standard\r\n\r\npattern for students of primary and secondary schools.\r\n\r\nA  standard  uniform  will ensure that  students  from\r\n\r\nprimary schools will not have to make new clothes  for\r\n\r\nschool  going  when  they are  promoted  to  secondary\r\n\r\nschool.  Otherwise  the  financial  burden  on   their\r\n\r\nparents   will  increase.  At  the  same  time,   some\r\n\r\naesthetic consideration should be given in the  design\r\n\r\ning  of  the uniforms. A standard uniform system  will\r\n\r\nsolve  the  problem of what students should wear  when\r\n\r\nthey  take  part  in mass drill at  the  National  Day\r\n\r\ncelebration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I rise to support the Members who  have\r\n\r\nspoken  before  me.  Whether a modern  and  developing\r\n\r\nnation like Singapore will continue to grow strong and\r\n\r\nhealthy  depends  on whether there  is  political  and\r\n\r\neconomic  stability. Singapore's future  survival  and\r\n\r\nwhether the democratic system will succeed will depend\r\n\r\non  whether our economic expansion will be fast enough\r\n\r\nto cope with the rising expectations of our people. We\r\n\r\nmust   march  forward  if  Singapore  is  to  survive.\r\n\r\nEveryone  knows  that we lack natural  resources.  Our\r\n\r\neconomic growth, therefore, depends on our talents and\r\n\r\nthe  proper  utilisation of our natural resources.  In\r\n\r\nother  words,  our economy depends very  much  on  the\r\n\r\nhuman  factor. Therefore, the aim of education  should\r\n\r\nbe to enhance the quality of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  viewed in  the  context  of  the situation in Asia, we have achieved  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome success in our education system. It is now mature\r\n\r\nand   more  progressive.  However,  we  must  not   be\r\n\r\ncomplacent We must always be on the look-out  for  any\r\n\r\nshortcomings and try to overcome them. If we adopt the\r\n\r\ncorrect  measures  to  overcome  our  shortcomings,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the pace in our educational development  will\r\n\r\nbe faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not want to speak on the overall education policy. I will direct my observations instead to certain short comings which we encounter in trying to implement it. Let us talk about our teachers. At this juncture in our nation building, we need not only a sufficient number of teachers but,\r\n\r\nwhat  is  more  important, we need  teachers  who  are\r\n\r\ndedicated  and  committed to the task of  implementing\r\n\r\nour   education  policy.  Otherwise  Singapore,  which\r\n\r\ndepends on its human resources for its survival,  will\r\n\r\nbe doomed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, do our teachers have a real respect for their profession? Let me quote an example from the Teachers' Training College. Recently, the T.T.C. Research Unit conducted a survey of the theme, \"Why I become a teacher.\" Among the teachers questioned, about 40 per cent of graduate teachers in\r\n\r\nthe  English stream; 68 per cent of graduates  in  the\r\n\r\nChinese stream; 71 per cent of H.S.C, trained teachers\r\n\r\n(English  stream);  69  per  cent  of  H.S.C, trained\r\n\r\nteachers (Chinese stream); 72 per cent of Secondary IV\r\n\r\ntrained  teachers (English stream) and 86 per cent  of\r\n\r\nSecondary  IV  trained teachers (Chinese stream)  have\r\n\r\nreally  committed themselves to their  profession.  In\r\n\r\nother words, of all the qualified teachers, there  are\r\n\r\nabout  60  per  cent  of  graduate  teachers  (English\r\n\r\nstream);  32  per  cent of graduate teachers  (Chinese\r\n\r\nstream);  29  per  cent  of  H.S.C, trained  teachers\r\n\r\n(English  stream);  31  per  cent  of  H.S.C, trained\r\n\r\nteachers (Chinese stream); 28 per cent of Secondary IV\r\n\r\ntrained  teachers (English stream);  14  per  cent  of\r\n\r\nSecondary  IV  trained teachers (Chinese  stream)  who\r\n\r\nregard  their  present job as a temporary  occupation.\r\n\r\nTeaching is to them a stepping stone to other jobs. If\r\n\r\nthey have a better opportunity, they will quit teaching.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  can deduce a very alarming fact  from  these\r\n\r\nfigures;  that  is, if a teacher is better  qualified,\r\n\r\nthe  less  dedicated he is to the teaching profession.\r\n\r\nWhat  is the Education Ministry going to do to  arrest\r\n\r\nthis trend? At the same time, I wish to know what  the\r\n\r\nT.T.C, is going to do to overcome this difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point. The majority of teachers\r\n\r\nhave  experienced some frustration in their  teaching.\r\n\r\nMost  of  them have been taught the latest  scientific\r\n\r\ntnethods of teaching. However, sometimes these methods\r\n\r\ndo  not  meet  with the approval of the inspectors  of\r\n\r\nschools or principals. The reasons are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The inspectors were not themselves teachers prior\r\n\r\nto  their  appointment, nor have they any  diploma  in\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Most of the principals were not given any\r\n\r\nprofessional training. They did not even keep  abreast\r\n\r\nof  the  latest  trends in education. They  run  their\r\n\r\nschools   according  to  their  own   experience   and\r\n\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Each and every lecturer has a different opinion\r\n\r\nof a trainee teacher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, there is a conflict in the\r\n\r\napproach  to  teaching between the lecturers  and  the\r\n\r\nteachers.   The  teachers  are  therefore  bewildered.\r\n\r\nWhenever a teacher wants to try out the latest methods\r\n\r\nof   teaching,  he  has  to  consider  whether  enough\r\n\r\nfacilities are available and also whether he  will  be\r\n\r\nallowed  the  freedom  to  experiment  with  the   new\r\n\r\nmethods. For example, first, there is the question  of\r\n\r\narrangement  in  the  classrooms, and,  second,   the\r\n\r\nquestion  whether the students have to go out  of  the\r\n\r\nclassrooms  or  out of the school for  extra-curricular\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, whether there are enough books for pupils\r\n\r\nto do self-study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in order to allay these doubts and fears,\r\n\r\nI believe there should be greater co-ordination and co-operation  among lecturers, principals, inspectors  of\r\n\r\nschools and teachers. To achieve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis,  more seminars, lectures and discussions  should\r\n\r\nbe held.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now speak on the problem of teachers in aided-\r\n\r\nschools  who  want  to  extend  their  service   after\r\n\r\nretirement.  At the moment, the Ministry of  Education\r\n\r\nconsiders applications on four criteria:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the physical condition of the teacher\r\n\r\nconcerned;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) his teaching ability;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) his financial situation; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) his record of social service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  agree  entirely with this approach. But  I  do  not\r\n\r\nagree  with the method of their implementation because\r\n\r\nthere  are  many  faults.  As  regards  the  teacher's\r\n\r\nteaching ability, the discretion is entirely with  the\r\n\r\nprincipal  and the inspector of schools. They  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  the  teacher well. If the inspector  of  schools\r\n\r\ndecides on the applicant's teaching ability after  one\r\n\r\nor  two  inspections,  this may lead  to  a  dangerous\r\n\r\nposition  of a blind man sizing up the picture  of  an\r\n\r\nelephant. Moreover, principals have their own personal\r\n\r\nfeelings,   whether  good  or  bad,  towards   certain\r\n\r\nteachers  and  they may not always be right.  In  this\r\n\r\nway, there may be prejudice against the teachers. This\r\n\r\nsystem   of   allowing  inspectors  of   schools   and\r\n\r\nprincipals  to judge the teaching ability of  teachers\r\n\r\nis  not  good and may lead to unfair decisions on  the\r\n\r\nteachers concerned. I suggest that a committee be  set\r\n\r\nup  to deal with the question of extending the service\r\n\r\nof retired teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point deals with textbooks. Sir, we all know\r\n\r\nthat  before 1960, our schools did not have  a  common\r\n\r\ncurriculum.  The  schools  had  their  own  choice  of\r\n\r\ntextbooks  with  an  inclination  towards  books  from\r\n\r\nforeign  countries. Because of this, students  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious  schools  adopted different  cultural  values.\r\n\r\nSince 1960, when the common curriculum was formulated,\r\n\r\nschools  of  all streams have been making use  of  the\r\n\r\nsame  curriculum  and  have been  inculcating  in  our\r\n\r\nyouths  a sense of national consciousness. But so  far\r\n\r\nwe  have not achieved much in this direction, although\r\n\r\nthe  common curriculum has been in existence for eight\r\n\r\nyears. This is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause  many textbooks are not available and many  of\r\n\r\nour schools are using textbooks the supply of which is\r\n\r\ndependent on overseas publishers. Therefore,  how  can\r\n\r\nthe   contents  of  these  textbooks  suit  our  local\r\n\r\nsituation  and requirements? I dare say that  most  of\r\n\r\nthe  publishers and authors of textbooks are the first\r\n\r\ngeneration  Chinese from China or refugees  from  Hong\r\n\r\nKong. They get very low pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Tay, you have spoken for 15\r\n\r\nminutes.

I  agree very much with the  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy  on extracurricular activities. But at  present\r\n\r\nthere  are  many faults in the implementation  of  the\r\n\r\npolicy  and,  as  a result, the objectives  cannot  be\r\n\r\nachieved.  Firstly, the teachers in  charge  of  extra\r\n\r\ncurricular  activities  are not  experienced  and  are\r\n\r\nunable  to  demonstrate the correct techniques.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult, the students are not keen on these activities.\r\n\r\nBecause   marks   are   awarded  for   extracurricular\r\n\r\nactivities, they have to participate in them in  order\r\n\r\nto gain more marks whether they like it or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, some extracurricular activities take up\r\n\r\nthree  or  four periods a week and normal lessons  are\r\n\r\ntherefore  disturbed. Some extracurricular  activities\r\n\r\nare concerned with taking part in public performances.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result, teaching hours are used up in the train\r\n\r\ning of these activities. Just because the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents  want to get some extra marks, they  have  to\r\n\r\nsacrifice  their  normal study lessons.  Sir,  do  you\r\n\r\nthink that extracurricular activities of this kind are\r\n\r\ngood  for the students? Students very often take  part\r\n\r\nin  national parades, youth festivals and other public\r\n\r\nperformances.  I feel that the Minister for  Education\r\n\r\nshould look into this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Adult Education Board has achieved results\r\n\r\nin  providing adults with supplementary education. The\r\n\r\nBoard will have greater responsibilities in the coming\r\n\r\nyears. Besides providing classes for students who have\r\n\r\nfailed  the  Primary School Leaving  Examination,  the\r\n\r\nBoard  is  also providing evening classes to over-aged\r\n\r\nstudents.  This is very good. But I feel the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education should take the responsibility of  super\r\n\r\nvising  the  activities of the  Board.  For  instance,\r\n\r\nthere have been shortcomings in the Board in the  past\r\n\r\nowing to lack of supervision. Some teachers are assist\r\n\r\ning  students  by  paying for their fees  and  thereby\r\n\r\ninducing  them  to stay on in order  to  make  up  the\r\n\r\nrequired  number of students for one  class.  In  this\r\n\r\nway,  they  will be paid by the Adult Education  Board\r\n\r\nand thus recover the money that they have spent on the\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the Ministry of Education will be\r\n\r\nmoving to a new building. I hope that, in future,  the\r\n\r\nefficiency  of the Ministry will be improved.  In  the\r\n\r\npast,  perhaps it was because the offices were  housed\r\n\r\nin  separate  buildings  that the  efficiency  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  was  low.  For instance, a  certain  teacher\r\n\r\norganisation wrote to the Ministry requesting for  per\r\n\r\nmission  to  hold a table tennis tournament  during  a\r\n\r\nparticular  term. But there was a long delay  and  the\r\n\r\nreply  was only given when the term was about to  end.\r\n\r\nSo  the  tournament had to be cancelled.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\ninefficiency in administration will not recur when the\r\n\r\nnew building is occupied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of education in Singapore in quantitative\r\n\r\nand  qualitative terms has been impressive  and  signi\r\n\r\nficant.  But,  unfortunately, the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nhave not noticed it. Educationists \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho have come to Singapore and seen  how  the\r\n\r\neducation system works have often marvelled at some of\r\n\r\nour  achievements.  Take,  for  example,  integration,\r\n\r\nbilingualism  and trilingualism in our schools.  These\r\n\r\nare aspects of our educational achievements which have\r\n\r\nimpressed many of the foreign educationists. They have\r\n\r\nalso  been impressed by the fact that we are  able  to\r\n\r\nachieve all this within the short space of one  decade\r\n\r\nor so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us who were present at the Youth Festival\r\n\r\nthis year and watched the performance of the youths at\r\n\r\nthe  youth  rally and the Youth Festival of Drama  and\r\n\r\nMusic  must admit that a great deal has been  achieved\r\n\r\nin education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, all these achievements have been\r\n\r\nconveniently forgotten by the people and also by  some\r\n\r\nMembers of this House. What stands out very clearly in\r\n\r\ntheir  minds is the failings of teachers.  There  must\r\n\r\nalways  be  black  sheep  in  every  profession.   The\r\n\r\nheadlines  they make in the papers are very  vivid  in\r\n\r\nthe  minds of the people of Singapore. The people have\r\n\r\nnot  recognised  the fact that these achievements  and\r\n\r\nthe  development  in education must necessarily  bring\r\n\r\nabout  a lot of attendant problems which will only  be\r\n\r\nsolved  with the passage of time. These problems  are\r\n\r\nunavoidable  and are sometimes due to the failings  of\r\n\r\ncertain teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we keep on harping on all these failings and\r\n\r\ncriticising  these  teachers both inside  and  outside\r\n\r\nthis  House,  I think we will have a very  demoralised\r\n\r\nteaching   profession  -  not  an  inspired   one.   A\r\n\r\ndemoralised teaching profession will not  be  able  to\r\n\r\nplay  the  role  that  we  expect  of  them  and,   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, we sometimes expect the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give a few examples of the contributions that\r\n\r\nthe  teachers  have made in response to  the  call  of\r\n\r\nnation  building.  Some time in 1960,  the  Government\r\n\r\nwanted to introduce Malay as the National Language and\r\n\r\nbilingualism and trilingualism in schools. Many of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  teachers  were not able to speak  Malay  at  that\r\n\r\ntime,  and when asked to attend the Teachers' Training\r\n\r\nCollege  in order to acquire a knowledge of  Malay  at\r\n\r\nStandard  I  and  II  level,  the  response   was   so\r\n\r\ntremendous  that  even the Teachers' Training  College\r\n\r\nand  the  Ministry  of  Education  were  not  able  to\r\n\r\norganise enough classes for them. This situation would\r\n\r\nnot  have arisen if the teachers had not risen to  the\r\n\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have recently heard of the slogan of building a\r\n\r\nrugged  society.  The number of extramural  activities\r\n\r\ngoing  on  in the schools nowadays sometimes frightens\r\n\r\nthe parents. They complain that their children have no\r\n\r\ntime  for their studies. We have observed the  results\r\n\r\nof  these extramural activities in the performance  of\r\n\r\nthe  students during the Youth Rally and the  Festival\r\n\r\nof Drama and Music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and above all this, the teachers are asked to\r\n\r\ndo  unprofessional  work.  The  Member  for  Serangoon\r\n\r\nGardens has underlined a very important point which we\r\n\r\nhave  to  remember, and that is, we have to  recognise\r\n\r\nteaching  as  a  profession. If the  teachers  are  to\r\n\r\nachieve  professional  standards  in  their  teaching,\r\n\r\ncertain  duties which are non-professional should  not\r\n\r\nbe  added to their load of professional duties. Common\r\n\r\nsense  tells us that if you have that situation,  then\r\n\r\nthe   efforts  of  the  teachers  in  the   field   of\r\n\r\nprofessional work will be diluted. Teachers  are  also\r\n\r\nhuman beings and they can only take up the load  to  a\r\n\r\ncertain extent, not more than that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens has mentioned a few\r\n\r\nexamples  of the non-professional work that principals\r\n\r\nand  teachers  are asked to do. One  of  them  is  the\r\n\r\nfilling of survey forms and all kinds of returns. This\r\n\r\nwork  is  not  done  during free  periods  but  during\r\n\r\nteaching hours, and therefore lessons must necessarily\r\n\r\nbe  interrupted. Principals are sometimes asked to act\r\n\r\nas  audit  clerks. I realise this is not entirely  the\r\n\r\nfault of the Ministry of Education, because they  have\r\n\r\ntheir limitations and, with a standstill budget,  they\r\n\r\ncannot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemploy additional clerks. But the blame should not  be\r\n\r\non  the  principals and teachers. When  they  are  not\r\n\r\nproficient  in their professional work, it is  because\r\n\r\nthey  are given this additional load of unprofessional\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has recently come out with\r\n\r\nthe idea of forming advisory committees in schools.  I\r\n\r\nthink  this  is a very splendid idea, because  schools\r\n\r\nshould  be  allowed  to use their  initiative  to  get\r\n\r\nadditional finance in order to increase their  efforts\r\n\r\nin promoting extramural activities and equipping their\r\n\r\nlibraries and so forth. Unfortunately, a sound idea is\r\n\r\nsometimes  badly  carried  out.  Principals   of   all\r\n\r\nGovernment  schools - the aided schools  already  have\r\n\r\ntheir  management  committees comprising  civic-minded\r\n\r\ncitizens who have the interest of education at heart -\r\n\r\nare asked to form advisory committees. To make it easy\r\n\r\nfor  Members to follow me, I will take 200 schools  as\r\n\r\nthe  number. Each advisory committee will comprise  15\r\n\r\nmembers  and  the principals are asked, in  the  first\r\n\r\ninstance,  to set up their advisory committees  within\r\n\r\none month. I was wondering how the principals of these\r\n\r\n200  schools  would be able to find  3,000  persons  -\r\n\r\nthere  are  15  members  in one advisory  committee  -\r\n\r\nwithin  one month to serve on them. The main  function\r\n\r\nof the committee is to contribute and raise money, and\r\n\r\nanother function is to look after the interests of the\r\n\r\nschools. The task of the principals to get this number\r\n\r\nof persons within one month is beyond most of them. In\r\n\r\nthe  first  place,  how  do  we  suddenly  find  3,000\r\n\r\ncitizens within one month or six months, who are civic-\r\n\r\nminded and with the interest of education at heart, to\r\n\r\nserve  on  the  advisory committees and to  raise  and\r\n\r\ncontribute money? The result is that if the principals\r\n\r\ndo  not form the committees in time, the blame will be\r\n\r\nput on them because they are not up to the mark. These\r\n\r\nare  some  of the problems that I am able to list  for\r\n\r\nthe  moment. I can go on listing other problems  which\r\n\r\nthe principals and teachers have to face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that there are bad principals, and bad\r\n\r\nteachers, but this fact must be, looked at against the\r\n\r\nperspective of the vast majority of teachers  who  are\r\n\r\nwilling  to play their role. I will not say  that  the\r\n\r\nvast  majority  of  the teachers are truly  dedicated.\r\n\r\nThere  are also those who, though not that dedicated,.\r\n\r\nare  willing  to rise to the occasion and  play  their\r\n\r\nrole  effectively. My point is that we  will  not  get\r\n\r\nthis  response  from  the teaching  profession  if  we\r\n\r\ncontinue  to criticise the failings of a few  and  let\r\n\r\nthese  criticisms dominate everything, while we forget\r\n\r\nthe good which the teaching profession has done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must also be recognised that how well our young\r\n\r\ncitizens  will shape up does not depend  only  on  our\r\n\r\nteachers alone. I think the teachers spend about  five\r\n\r\nhours with their students and perhaps one or two hours\r\n\r\nduring extramural activities. There are also the other\r\n\r\nhours  where the children are at home and  it  is  the\r\n\r\nparent's  concern  to teach their children  moral  and\r\n\r\nsocial  values.  Therefore, the parents'  role  is  as\r\n\r\nessential as, if not more essential than, the role  of\r\n\r\nteachers. Much as we blame the teaching profession for\r\n\r\nsome  shortcomings,  there  are  certain  parents  who\r\n\r\nshould also be blamed, for the only concern they  show\r\n\r\nfor  their  children's education is whether  they  can\r\n\r\npass  the  Primary  School  Leaving  Examination   and\r\n\r\nwhether  or not they should employ private  tutors  to\r\n\r\ngive  them  additional tuition. The vast  majority  of\r\n\r\nparents, cannot afford to engage private tutors.  They\r\n\r\nprobably  have their citizenship or other problems  to\r\n\r\nworry about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Sia, I think you have just\r\n\r\ngone beyond 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  much  of  the criticisms  against  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education can be attributed to the  rapid\r\n\r\nand  vast expansion in the field of education over the\r\n\r\nlast  10  years.  I think Members are aware  that  the\r\n\r\nschool enrolment has almost doubled since\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1960. There has been no corresponding expansion in the\r\n\r\nadministrative personnel in the Education Ministry and\r\n\r\na  considerable  backlog  of administrative  work  has\r\n\r\naccumulated.  This  has led to various  criticisms  of\r\n\r\ninefficiency, the lateness in giving decisions and  so\r\n\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens has pointed out\r\n\r\nthat  within a short space of eight years  there  have\r\n\r\nbeen  so  many changes in the educational system  that\r\n\r\nmany  of  the teachers are not able to understand  the\r\n\r\nvarious  changes  and grasp the aims and  purposes  of\r\n\r\nsuch   changes.   No  sooner  have   commissions   and\r\n\r\ncommittees been appointed to look into the educational\r\n\r\nsystem  and  no sooner has one report by a  commission\r\n\r\nbeen   completed  than  it  is  overtaken  by  events.\r\n\r\nHowever,  from now onwards we can expect a  period  of\r\n\r\nconsolidation because, as Members are aware, money  is\r\n\r\nnot  easily available in future for expansion  in  the\r\n\r\neducational field. Given this respite, we may be  able\r\n\r\nto  bring much of the administrative work up  to  date\r\n\r\nand innovate various improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will notice that although there is a\r\n\r\nrestructuring of the educational system, it is not  so\r\n\r\nmuch  a  radical change of the policy as a  change  in\r\n\r\nemphasis.  I  cannot agree more with  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Gardens that our teachers must be  informed\r\n\r\nof  the  aims and purposes of the changes in emphasis,\r\n\r\nand,  towards this end, the Ministry will do all  that\r\n\r\nis  possible to bring the teachers up to date on  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention has been made of the need for a research\r\n\r\nunit  to  study the effects of the various changes  in\r\n\r\nthe education system. I agree that although we have at\r\n\r\nthe  moment a research unit in the Ministry, not  much\r\n\r\nresearch has been carried out, because of the shortage\r\n\r\nof qualified personnel, particularly on the subject of\r\n\r\nthe  possible  effects of the various changes  in  our\r\n\r\neducation system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens expressed his\r\n\r\nanxiety  that in our eagerness to produce a sufficient\r\n\r\nnumber of technicians and craftsmen to meet the  needs\r\n\r\nof our industries, we might be producing a lot of what\r\n\r\nhe termed techno sapiens instead of homo sapiens. Sir,\r\n\r\nI  cannot  agree more with him that this is a  problem\r\n\r\nthat is causing me sleepless nights, because very  few\r\n\r\npeople have given thought to it. Unlike other matters,\r\n\r\nthe  effects  of changes in our education  system  can\r\n\r\nonly be seen after a number of years. However, we  did\r\n\r\nget  advice  from various experts on these changes  in\r\n\r\nour education system. It is hoped that we will produce\r\n\r\neducated homo sapiens and not techno sapiens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang raised the question of\r\n\r\npayment  of  \"Miscellaneous\"  fees  by  pupils   whose\r\n\r\nparents are in receipt of public assistance. Prior  to\r\n\r\nthe  third school-term this year, pupils in Government\r\n\r\nand  Government-aided  schools were  required  to  pay\r\n\r\nterminal fees which varied in amount according to  the\r\n\r\ntype  of  school and the course of study,  and  ranged\r\n\r\nfrom  $1 per term in island primary schools to $6  per\r\n\r\nterm  in  secondary schools. Poor pupils were exempted\r\n\r\nfrom  payment of these fees on the recommendations  of\r\n\r\ntheir  principals.  But  with effect  from  the  third\r\n\r\nschool-term  this year, the terminal fee was  replaced\r\n\r\nby  a  \"Miscellaneous\" fee of $1 per month in  primary\r\n\r\nschools and $2 per month in secondary schools. As  the\r\n\r\n\"Miscellaneous\" fee will be collected in small monthly\r\n\r\ninstalments  rather than in large terminal  ones,  the\r\n\r\nburden   on  the  parents  will  be  negligible   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  no  exemption  or  waiver  on  grounds  of\r\n\r\nhardship  may be considered. The Member for  Sembawang\r\n\r\nshould know that the \"Miscellaneous\" fees are intended\r\n\r\nto  meet  part  of  the  cost of expendable  materials\r\n\r\nconnected  with  sports, libraries, Science,  Domestic\r\n\r\nScience,  Arts  and  Crafts, and also  extracurricular\r\n\r\nactivities  in keeping with the Government  policy  of\r\n\r\nintensifying such activities in our schools.  In  view\r\n\r\nof  the  financial stringency, it is not  possible  to\r\n\r\ngrant exemptions to such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has always tried, as far as possible,\r\n\r\nto post students to schools nearest their homes. But I\r\n\r\nthink  the Member for Sembawang should know that  over\r\n\r\nthe  last  five  years, there has been a  considerable\r\n\r\nshift in population in Singapore. Many housing estates\r\n\r\nhave been developed, and, as a result, there have been\r\n\r\nshortages  of  school  places  in  these  new  housing\r\n\r\nestates.  But  overall, there  are  enough  places  in\r\n\r\nschools  in Singapore. The question is one of distance\r\n\r\nbecause  the school buildings are permanent structures\r\n\r\non the ground and they cannot be shifted about to suit\r\n\r\nthe  convenience of the parents. While we try our best\r\n\r\nto post students to schools nearest their homes, it is\r\n\r\nnot always possible to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar referred to the production\r\n\r\nof  textbooks by local experts. I am quite sure he  is\r\n\r\nwell  aware  that since the introduction of  a  common\r\n\r\ncurriculum  in  schools, we have been encouraging  our\r\n\r\nlocal  publishers to publish books in conformity  with\r\n\r\nthis  school curriculum. I think the response has been\r\n\r\nsatisfactory,  although it is true that  a  number  of\r\n\r\nthese  textbooks were edited by people who  came  from\r\n\r\nChina  and  by refugees from Hong Kong.  But,  by  and\r\n\r\nlarge,  I think a considerable number of books,  parti\r\n\r\ncularly  English  books, have been  produced  locally.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  steps  have  also  been  taken  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry to publish textbooks in certain subject areas\r\n\r\nwhere special needs have to be met. For example, three\r\n\r\nseries  of  textbooks  are  being  published  by   the\r\n\r\nMinistry.   A  series  of  textbooks  on  civics   for\r\n\r\nsecondary classes have already been published  by  the\r\n\r\nEducational  Publication Bureau  of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation. The publication of a similar series for the\r\n\r\npre-university level will soon follow. Other series in\r\n\r\nthe  course of preparation include a series of History\r\n\r\ntextbooks and a series of Chinese Language Readers for\r\n\r\nprimary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference was also made that many of the trained\r\n\r\nteachers and many of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose undergoing training now are not motivated by the\r\n\r\nhigh  ideals of the teaching profession. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  situation described may have resulted  from\r\n\r\nthe large number of trainees recruited in the past  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the shortage of teachers. The situation  now  is\r\n\r\nquite  different. With large numbers of well-qualified\r\n\r\napplications for a limited number of teaching jobs and\r\n\r\nwith  better  methods of selection,  I  think  we  can\r\n\r\nexpect a more dedicated crop of teachers in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar also touched on the basis\r\n\r\nof  granting  extension of service to teachers.  Since\r\n\r\nJune 1968, the work of teachers applying for extension\r\n\r\nof  service is initially inspected and assessed by the\r\n\r\nprincipal  of  the  school to  which  the  teacher  is\r\n\r\nattached.   It  is  followed  up  by  an   independent\r\n\r\ninspection  and assessment by a principal  of  another\r\n\r\nschool  nominated by the Ministry. Where the views  of\r\n\r\none   principal  differ  from  the  other,   a   third\r\n\r\ninspection  is  made by the Inspectorate  Division  of\r\n\r\nthis  Ministry.  Since  the  work  of  a  teacher   is\r\n\r\ninspected by more than one officer, the possibility of\r\n\r\npersonal  factors  coming into  play  is  considerably\r\n\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Generally\r\n\r\nspeaking,  the  secondary school examinations  set  by\r\n\r\nthis  Division are not ideal. The form and content  of\r\n\r\nthe examination questions are extensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  students are not able to cope with them. Even the\r\n\r\nteachers themselves are at a loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to touch on the Science\r\n\r\nexaminations  in secondary schools. I  feel  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education should adopt  a  more  unified\r\n\r\nmethod  of arranging the Science examinations so  that\r\n\r\nthe  school  teachers do not have  to  run  around  to\r\n\r\nobtain   the  necessary  apparatus  for  the   Science\r\n\r\nexaminations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practical examination in science subjects should\r\n\r\nalso  be  under  unified  control.  The  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation should set up a laboratory where examination\r\n\r\nquestions   on   practical   science   which   require\r\n\r\nexperiments could first be tested in the laboratory to\r\n\r\nascertain  the result, before they are  given  to  the\r\n\r\nstudents,  otherwise some mistakes may  be  discovered\r\n\r\nhalfway   through   the  examination.   A   ridiculous\r\n\r\nsituation  would then develop. This is  to  supplement\r\n\r\nwhat I have said just now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister has not given a reply to my question  on\r\n\r\nextra-curricular activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

As   the   term\r\n\r\n\"extracurricular activities\" suggests, students should\r\n\r\ntake  part in these activities only outside the normal\r\n\r\nschool  hours, except under very special circumstances\r\n\r\nwhere  they have to be undertaken during school hours.\r\n\r\nSuch  occasions are very rare and the principal should\r\n\r\nget  the  permission  of the Ministry  first.

However,  the principals  concerned  have\r\n\r\nbeen  warned  and advised to rectify the position.  In\r\n\r\nfact, the Ministry is rather concerned about such lack\r\n\r\nof discipline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to uniforms, it is not possible to have\r\n\r\na  standard  pattern of school uniform throughout  the\r\n\r\nisland.  There  are  many  schools  which  have   long\r\n\r\ntraditions, and they would be very reluctant to change\r\n\r\nthe  pattern of their uniforms. Some schools have pure\r\n\r\nwhite, some  white and yellow. I do not think  it  is\r\n\r\nreally  a  very serious matter. I think  most  schools\r\n\r\nwould prefer to keep their own tradition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as for raised by the Member for the Ministry would not like the failure of the teaching We do not -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong</b> rose -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, I did not blame the\r\n\r\nMinistry  for harping on it. I was just commenting  on\r\n\r\nthe   criticisms  that  were  being  levelled  at  the\r\n\r\nteachers  from within and without this House.  I  know\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  cannot blame the teachers  because  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  has got to blame itself. I do not  hold  the\r\n\r\nMinistry responsible for this. In fact, we are in  the\r\n\r\nsame  boat.  We have to defend ourselves  against  the\r\n\r\nunfair  criticisms both from within and  without  this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it would\r\n\r\nappear then that I need not answer the question, since\r\n\r\nas the Member for Moulmein says, the profession \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the Ministry are in the same boat! Anyway, to\r\n\r\nthose  who are dedicated to their profession we always\r\n\r\nshow the carrot, and to those who are not, we show the\r\n\r\nstick.  [Interruption.] Not from the Ministry, as  the\r\n\r\nMember for Moulmein has himself pointed out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for teachers being asked to do non-professional\r\n\r\nwork,  I  think  it is very difficult  to  distinguish\r\n\r\nprofessional  work  from  non-professional  work   for\r\n\r\nteachers.  A teacher does not only teach but  he  also\r\n\r\nbuilds  up  the  personality  and  character  of   the\r\n\r\nstudents.  He  may  therefore have  to  do  some  non-\r\n\r\nteaching  work  in order to achieve  this  aim.  If  I\r\n\r\nrecall correctly, the Member for Serangoon Gardens did\r\n\r\nask  a  question  in this House about  the  duties  of\r\n\r\nprincipals  some time ago, and this was  answered.  In\r\n\r\nteaching,  it  is  also necessary 'to perform  certain\r\n\r\nduties  pertaining to the education system as a whole,\r\n\r\nsuch  as the filling up of forms and the supplying  of\r\n\r\nstatistics   to  the  Ministry  for  the  purpose   of\r\n\r\nplanning.   This   is  indirectly  professional   work\r\n\r\ncontributing to the education profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards school advisory committees, I realise\r\n\r\nthat  200  multiplied by 15 gives 3,000,  which  is  a\r\n\r\nlarge  number.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the principals  have\r\n\r\nbeen  advised to consult the Members of Parliament  of\r\n\r\ntheir  respective constituencies for suitable  persons\r\n\r\nto  be on these committees. If they fail to do so,  it\r\n\r\nmeans  that they have little liaison with the  Members\r\n\r\nof Parliament and with the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> They did not approach the\r\n\r\nM.P.s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> I am not exactly saying that,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir.  But if the  principals  have  not\r\n\r\napproached M.P.s, of course, I cannot blame the M.P.s.\r\n\r\nBut  the  principals have been advised to  do  so.  It\r\n\r\nshould not be difficult for the M.P.s, to recommend 15\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the public to the principals  to  sit  on\r\n\r\nthese  committees. In fact, many schools have  parents\r\n\r\nand  teachers  associations before  the  new  advisory\r\n\r\ncommittees were set up. In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany  instances, it is just a matter  of  getting  the\r\n\r\nsame people to serve on the other committees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has, raised the point\r\n\r\nabout  the  necessary improvements to be made  in  the\r\n\r\nexamination  questions of the Ministry.  Most  of  the\r\n\r\nexamination questions are set not just by one examiner\r\n\r\nbut   by  a  board  of  examiners  who  consider  the'\r\n\r\nexamination  questions in detail.  It  is  unfortunate\r\n\r\nthat sometimes certain mistakes do occur. But, by  and\r\n\r\nlarge,  an examination is just a means of ascertaining\r\n\r\nthe standard which has been attained by a student.  So\r\n\r\nthe question of too wide a syllabus does not arise. We\r\n\r\ndo not want to tell the students, \"We are going to ask\r\n\r\nyou this, question. Therefore, you study this question\r\n\r\nproperly.\"  We are trying to test what they  know  and\r\n\r\nnot  what  they do not know. The question of  limiting\r\n\r\nthe  syllabus  so that the teachers will know  exactly\r\n\r\nwhat  to set as an examination question is not correct\r\n\r\nfrom any educational point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to practical work, I am afraid we cannot\r\n\r\ninstitute  a centre for' practical work in respect  of\r\n\r\nscience'  subjects. We have too many centres  already.\r\n\r\nThe Member for Paya Lebar will appreciate that most of\r\n\r\nthe  examination  questions are  set  by  the  science\r\n\r\nteachers themselves ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I do not mean that a centre should be set up\r\n\r\nwhere  all  the candidates could' be examined  on  the\r\n\r\npractical  aspects, of the science  subjects.  What  I\r\n\r\nmeant  was  that the questions should be tested  first\r\n\r\nbefore they are put down as examination questions  for\r\n\r\nthe students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  Member's question.

They have spent two years in the\r\n\r\nT.T.C, to  be trained as teachers. Under the  present\r\n\r\nsystem, such   experiments  as  are   necessary   in\r\n\r\npractical  questions  are  first  tried  out  in  the\r\n\r\nlaboratory by those who set the practical side of  the\r\n\r\nexamination  paper.  This  is  to  ensure   that   the\r\n\r\nexperiments can be carried out. Of course,  there  may\r\n\r\nbe  a  few instances where minor defects might  arise.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the teachers, who have had so much  train'ing\r\n\r\nthemselves, will be able to answer and carry  out  the\r\n\r\nexperiments faster than the students they teach.  But\r\n\r\nremedial  action is usually taken and such cases  have\r\n\r\nalways been reported to the examiners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I just want to add one point with\r\n\r\nregard to the activities of the Adult Education Board.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  for  Jurong has said just  now  that  the\r\n\r\nactivities of the Adult Education Board have not  been\r\n\r\nproperly supervised by the Ministry. Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthere is such a body as the Adult Education Board. All\r\n\r\nthe  activities  organised by it  are  supervised  'by\r\n\r\nstaff  recruited by it.

I\r\n\r\nthink the image of the inspectors of schools is fairly\r\n\r\nset  by  now. In some cases it gives rise to a lot  of\r\n\r\napprehension on the part of the teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But apart from their functions of inspection of\r\n\r\nteaching  methods, the examination of school  accounts\r\n\r\nand investigation into complaints against teachers and\r\n\r\nschool  heads,  what are their residual functions,  if\r\n\r\nany?  I  wonder  if these inspectors  of  schools  are\r\n\r\nexpected  - or a much more preferable term -  required\r\n\r\nto   submit   research  papers  on  the  problems   of\r\n\r\neducation,   analysis   of  problems   pertaining   to\r\n\r\nmethodology, methods and teaching of special  subjects\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is part of their duties to so submit\r\n\r\ntreatises,   theses  and  written  papers   on   these\r\n\r\nproblems, what have been their contributions so far?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it would be extremely desirable if the\r\n\r\nInspectorate   insists  that  inspectors  periodically\r\n\r\nsubmit  written papers on problems relating to matters\r\n\r\nof  teaching. I think they are the proper persons with\r\n\r\nthe  expertise to undertake such a problem. I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  that their duties should be so mundane  and  so\r\n\r\nlimited  as  to  go  around  examining  accounts   and\r\n\r\ninspecting the teaching of teachers for bar  crossing.\r\n\r\netc.  I think the Inspectorate can contribute best  to\r\n\r\neducation if it instils into the inspectors of schools\r\n\r\na sense\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\nof  careership, because inspectorship is a career.  It\r\n\r\ndoes not involve isolated services like inspection  of\r\n\r\nteaching,  examination of accounts  and  investigation\r\n\r\ninto  complaints.  I think there is  an  attitude,  an\r\n\r\napproach,  required of inspectors. This will  only  be\r\n\r\nachieved  if the duties of inspectors, as I  say, are\r\n\r\nmore  than  just servicing schools and  inspection  of\r\n\r\nteaching.  It must include a progressive and sustained\r\n\r\ninquiry into the many and varied problems of education\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to time. If the results of these inquiries\r\n\r\nare  published and distributed among the teaching  pro\r\n\r\nfession,  then I think it will go a long way  to  help\r\n\r\nand improve the teaching effort of the profession.  It\r\n\r\ncertainly  will benefit 19,000 teachers and indirectly\r\n\r\nwill benefit half a million school-going children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, is the Inspectorate not aware that the\r\n\r\nteaching in primary schools these days places so  much\r\n\r\nemphasis upon the passing of that infamous examination\r\n\r\ncalled the Primary School Leaving Examination that the\r\n\r\npupils going to the secondary schools are, in fact, in\r\n\r\ndifficulties   when  it  comes  to  articulating   and\r\n\r\ncomposing work in the classroom? I think this  is  due\r\n\r\nto  the  fact that the teachers in the primary schools\r\n\r\nhave  focused their efforts purely to get  the  pupils\r\n\r\nthrough  the  examination. Surely the Inspectorate  is\r\n\r\naware  of this trend and, if it is, what has  it  been\r\n\r\ndoing?  Has  it gone round to the schools to  try  and\r\n\r\ndilute  this  trend and to insist on the  teaching  of\r\n\r\nskills  in  composition? I do not mean  the  classroom\r\n\r\nsubject   Composition  but  composition   in   speech,\r\n\r\ncomposition  in thinking, composition in  articulating\r\n\r\nso  that when the pupils go to secondary schools, they\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  shocked  by the  amount  of  work  that\r\n\r\nrequires compository skills in the secondary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, the specialists and\r\n\r\ninspectors  of  schools do submit  papers  on  various\r\n\r\naspects  of  education. Some papers are  required  for\r\n\r\nstudy before decisions are taken and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nothers  are  submitted  as papers  for  discussion  by\r\n\r\nteachers  and  principals  at  various  seminars   and\r\n\r\nconferences  conducted throughout the  year.  I  agree\r\n\r\nthat  the  work  of  specialist inspectors  and  other\r\n\r\ninspectors in this respect is not sufficient, as  most\r\n\r\nof their time is taken up with the routine and mundane\r\n\r\nduties  of administration~ inspection of teachers  and\r\n\r\nso  forth.  It  is for this reason that sometime  this\r\n\r\nyear   we   decided  to  \"off  load\"  some  of   their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities on to the principals  by  asking  the\r\n\r\nlatter  to  inspect  their own teachers  and  also  to\r\n\r\nassist  in  inspecting the school  accounts.  But,  as\r\n\r\nMembers have criticised just now, this aspect  of  the\r\n\r\nwork  is  really not professional and  should  not  be\r\n\r\ngiven to the principals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only about 120 inspectors as against\r\n\r\nnearly  20,000 school teachers. Merely to inspect  the\r\n\r\nteachers'  work would have occupied most of  the  time\r\n\r\nthat  is  available to the inspectors. I think  it  is\r\n\r\nprincipally because of this reason that there have not\r\n\r\nbeen  enough  papers  on various educational  problems\r\n\r\nsubmitted by specialist inspectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure how this problem can be tackled,\r\n\r\nbecause   the   routine  inspection  of  teachers   is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  purposes  of  crossing  the  bar,  for\r\n\r\npurposes  of  promotion, extension of service  and  so\r\n\r\nforth. Somebody has to do this aspect of the work. And\r\n\r\nunless we can get staff from elsewhere to relieve  the\r\n\r\nspecialist inspectors of some of their routine duties,\r\n\r\nI  am  afraid  it is not possible to expect  too  much\r\n\r\npaper work from them. However, if financial support is\r\n\r\nforthcoming in the course of next year, I  propose  to\r\n\r\nexpand the Research Unit so that it will be able to do\r\n\r\nresearch  into the many pressing educational  problems\r\n\r\ninstead  of  directing  its attention  mainly  to  the\r\n\r\ncompilation of statistics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This subhead concerns staff officers, a subject on\r\n\r\nwhich the ambit of my debate has been somewhat reduced\r\n\r\nby  the answer given by the Parliamentary Secretary to\r\n\r\nmy question earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are two points that I want to raise.\r\n\r\nI  believe  that a directive stands to date  requiring\r\n\r\nthe staffing of qualified teachers only in Primaries I\r\n\r\nand  VI and that in between (Primaries II to V), these\r\n\r\nclasses could be staffed with unqualified teachers.  I\r\n\r\nam not saying that my information is factual. I do not\r\n\r\nknow.  Perhaps  the  Minister  for  Education  or  his\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary can enlighten me. That is what\r\n\r\nI  have  been given to understand. If that is so,  the\r\n\r\npoint  that  I wish to raise is that the  staffing  on\r\n\r\nthis  basis in primary schools should be looked  into,\r\n\r\nbecause  if  we  need  to  staff  qualified  competent\r\n\r\nteachers in any school, it is in the primary school. I\r\n\r\nthink if the pupils in the primary schools are somehow\r\n\r\nmishandled,  by  the  time they  reach  the  secondary\r\n\r\nclasses, they will be so atrophied that they will  not\r\n\r\nhave  much  of  a  potential  as  students,  in  these\r\n\r\nschools.  I  think that whatever staffing  formula  is\r\n\r\nbeing applied by the staff officers, it should be such\r\n\r\nas  to  ensure that more qualified teachers be staffed\r\n\r\nin  primary  schools  in view of  the  fact  that  the\r\n\r\nchildren  in  Primary schools are in a formative  age,\r\n\r\nand  if they are malformed, we are going to get a good\r\n\r\ndeal  of  maladjustments which would be  difficult  to\r\n\r\nreset   in   the  secondary  schools.  That   is   one\r\n\r\nobservation  which  I  would  like  the  Minister   to\r\n\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second observation that I wish to make is in\r\n\r\nreference  to what we call \"integrated schools\"  these\r\n\r\ndays.  Sir,  perhaps  we can do  away  with  the  word\r\n\r\n\"integrated\".  To me, it sounds as though  we  have  a\r\n\r\nracial problem in Singapore when we name a school inte\r\n\r\ngrated.  I  do not know whether it is possible  to  do\r\n\r\naway with it. My view is that it would not take a  lot\r\n\r\nof  thinking  to  remove  the  word  \"integrated\".  It\r\n\r\nconveys  the impression that we have got a set  racial\r\n\r\nproblem.

In fact, I do not like\r\n\r\nthis  term myself, because \"integrated\", as translated\r\n\r\nin Chinese, means \"mixed\". One does not know what type\r\n\r\nof  school  this is. However, the Member for Serangoon\r\n\r\nGardens  will  notice  that in  all  our  new  schools\r\n\r\ncompleted since 1964 when I took over, the term  \"inte\r\n\r\ngrated\"  has  not been used. But for the  old  schools\r\n\r\nwhich already have this term I have not really brought\r\n\r\nmy  mind  to bear on whether we should take  the  word\r\n\r\nout.  Some of the schools have been known by this term\r\n\r\nfor the last eight years and they have become embedded\r\n\r\nin  the  parents'  minds. I am not  sure  whether  the\r\n\r\nremoval  of the word \"integrated\" will not cause  more\r\n\r\nconfusion. Anyway, it is something into which I  would\r\n\r\nlike to look myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the staffing of the primary schools, it is\r\n\r\nour  aim  that all teachers in primary schools should,\r\n\r\nas  far  as possible, be trained. The current position\r\n\r\nis that 62 per cent of the primary school teachers are\r\n\r\ntrained teachers, 24 per cent are teachers-in-training\r\n\r\nand 14 per cent are untrained teachers. Even with this\r\n\r\n14  per cent of untrained teachers, various in-service\r\n\r\ncourses have been organised with a view to raising the\r\n\r\nstandard  of their professional teaching and  also  to\r\n\r\nkeeping   them   abreast  with   current   trends   in\r\n\r\neducational  development and the modem  techniques  of\r\n\r\nteaching.  As  the  primary school  enrolment  is  not\r\n\r\nexpanding and with more teachers being trained in  the\r\n\r\nfuture to replace the untrained teachers who might  be\r\n\r\nretiring in the course of the years, the situation  in\r\n\r\nour primary schools will be very much improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr L.

In October, a month-long\r\n\r\ncampaign  to  \"Keep Singapore Clean\" was launched  and\r\n\r\ncarried  out  successfully; the enthusiastic  response\r\n\r\nand  support  of the people in all walks of  life  was\r\n\r\ntremendous. The message did certainly get down to  the\r\n\r\npeople.  During the past three years, my Ministry  has\r\n\r\ntaken  a number of positive measures to cope with  and\r\n\r\novercome  the  many problems that have been  a  severe\r\n\r\ndeterrent to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nefforts to improve the quality of the environment. The\r\n\r\nproblems  associated  with  indiscipline  of   labour,\r\n\r\novertime  rackets  and  labour-union  interference  in\r\n\r\nmanagement  matters  have been,  to  a  large  extent,\r\n\r\nresolved  between 1966 and 1967 -that is past history.\r\n\r\nIt  culminated in the abortive daily-rated  strike  of\r\n\r\n1967  which  gave the Ministry of Health an  effective\r\n\r\nbasis  to  push  ahead  with  the  initial  phase   of\r\n\r\nreorganisation. Consequent to the tightening of  super\r\n\r\nvision  of the work force, there was some increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  efficiency  and productivity in public  cleansing\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, real improvement began with the\r\n\r\nimplementation   of   the   reorganisation   of    the\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Health Branch in August this year.  This\r\n\r\nreorganisation  involved the  division  of  our  whole\r\n\r\nisland  into  districts which were further sub-divided\r\n\r\ninto sectors and each sector was put in the charge  of\r\n\r\na  public  health inspector or a senior public  health\r\n\r\nassistant who is the officer-in-charge of the  sector.\r\n\r\nUnder  him  are a number of public health  assistants,\r\n\r\nthe public health overseers, the mandores and the beat\r\n\r\nlabourers. These officers in charge of sectors in turn\r\n\r\ncome  under a health officer who is in charge  of  the\r\n\r\nwhole  district. There is, therefore, a clear line  of\r\n\r\ncommand and responsibility. Thus, the familiar game of\r\n\r\n\"passing  the  buck\" was eliminated. It  was  also  an\r\n\r\nexercise   of   integration  of  the   public   health\r\n\r\ninspectorate  with the public cleansing department  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  of decentralisation and the giving  of  more\r\n\r\npowers  to  the persons in the field. Improvement  was\r\n\r\nfurther enhanced by the introduction of round-the-year\r\n\r\npublic  cleansing also in August this year. I am  glad\r\n\r\nto  say that there is also now a greater awareness and\r\n\r\nappreciation among the various Government  departments\r\n\r\nof  the interaction of facets and sectors of the total\r\n\r\nenvironment  and  of  the fact that  resultant  health\r\n\r\nproblems  may originate from other sources. All  these\r\n\r\nefforts  have  contributed to  a  Singapore  which  is\r\n\r\nvisibly cleaner than it was, not only two years ago\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  ten  months ago. Of course, there is  still  much\r\n\r\nmore  to be done. As I have said previously, this  war\r\n\r\nagainst  filth  and  squalor is a relentless  one  and\r\n\r\nrequires all the grit, the stamina and the persistence\r\n\r\nin order to triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, good and adequate legislation is\r\n\r\none   of  the  principal  tools, for  the  successful\r\n\r\nexecution of any public health programme involving the\r\n\r\ncommunity  as a whole. Members will remember  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  addendum to the President's Speech at the opening\r\n\r\nof  Parliament in April this year, it was stated  that\r\n\r\nthe  public  health legislation was being consolidated\r\n\r\ninto   a  comprehensive  Environmental  Health   Code,\r\n\r\ncapable of maintaining the highest standards of public\r\n\r\nhealth  that  is  required in a modern  complex  urban\r\n\r\nsociety.  The  Destruction of Disease-Bearing  Insects\r\n\r\nAct,  1968,  was passed by Parliament on  1st  August,\r\n\r\n1968,  and brought into force on 1st September,  1968.\r\n\r\nToday,  you  have before you the Environmental  Public\r\n\r\nHealth  Bill  in  this series of  measures  to  update\r\n\r\nhealth  legislation  and  improve  our  public  health\r\n\r\nstandards.  Attention will next  be  directed  to  the\r\n\r\nrevision and updating of the Quarantine and Prevention\r\n\r\nof Disease Ordinance, an Ordinance nearly 40 years old\r\n\r\nin  conception;  this  controls the  introduction  and\r\n\r\nspread  of  infectious diseases both from outside  and\r\n\r\nwithin the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated earlier, the basic needs and problems\r\n\r\nfaced  by the Public Health Division are in the  field\r\n\r\nof  environmental health services - public  cleansing,\r\n\r\nanti-mosquito and other vector control, public  health\r\n\r\nnuisances,  uncoordinated  building  development   and\r\n\r\npockets  of sub-standard environment within the  urban\r\n\r\narea.  These  problems  are  the  result  of  multiple\r\n\r\nfactors,  some  of which are within the Public  Health\r\n\r\nDivision's  sphere  of  influence  and  competence  to\r\n\r\ntackle,  but others are not. Briefly, we in  Singapore\r\n\r\nare facing the results of rapid urbanisation and socio-political changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been acutely felt that the health officials\r\n\r\nwere  working  with  outmoded  legislation  which  was\r\n\r\nformulated for a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npast  colonial era. In order to solve the present  and\r\n\r\nfuture  public  health problems on a long-term  basis,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  need  for an entirely  new  dynamic  and\r\n\r\nradical  approach, one aspect of which is  a  thorough\r\n\r\nand   complete  revision  of  all  the  principal  and\r\n\r\nsubsidiary  legislation governing  matters  of  public\r\n\r\nhealth.  In  this revision, the changed political  and\r\n\r\nsocial   circumstances,  as  well  as  the   behaviour\r\n\r\npatterns  and attitudes of our local population,  must\r\n\r\nbe  taken into account. Besides, there must also be  a\r\n\r\npainstaking  reappraisal of what may be called  health\r\n\r\nstandards or conditions or requirements. These  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  viewed  in  isolation but in the  context  of  the\r\n\r\nfabric  of our local life, and are by the very  nature\r\n\r\nof things relative to the aspirations of the community\r\n\r\nat  a  given  time.  This calls for  a  realistic  and\r\n\r\npragmatic  approach. But whatever these may  be,  once\r\n\r\ndecided,  these values will have to be  clearly  spelt\r\n\r\nout and codified so that their implementation would be\r\n\r\nuniform   and  fair.  Once  agreed,  they  should   be\r\n\r\ngenerally applicable and should not be the subject  of\r\n\r\nbargaining or ad hoc modification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Environmental Public Health Bill which is before\r\n\r\nParliament  and the various subsidiary legislation  to\r\n\r\nbe made under it have been drafted with the philosophy\r\n\r\nI  have just outlined. The Environmental Public Health\r\n\r\nAct  seeks  to replace Part IV of the Local Government\r\n\r\nIntegration  Ordinance,  1963,  which  contained   the\r\n\r\nrelevant provisions concerned with the maintenance  of\r\n\r\nenvironmental  health. It would  interest  Members  to\r\n\r\nknow  that the old provisions are essentially  similar\r\n\r\nto  the  Municipal  Ordinance (Cap.  133  o  the  1936\r\n\r\nEdition)  which  was  itself first  enacted  in  1913.\r\n\r\nSubsequent amendments to it were made to keep in  line\r\n\r\nwith  the various administrative changes in the  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment,  but  these did not affect  or  alter  the\r\n\r\ncontents  and the principles of public health practice\r\n\r\nas provided for by the said Ordinance and, hence, they\r\n\r\nhave become quite apparently obsolescent. What is more\r\n\r\ninteresting is that the Municipal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrdinance  itself  was  based on  the  British  Public\r\n\r\nHealth  Act of 1897 - Members will know that that  was\r\n\r\nthe  time of Queen Victoria. The British Public Health\r\n\r\nAct has subsequently been re-enacted three times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took one year to prepare the Environmental Public\r\n\r\nHealth  Bill.  Every single clause has been  carefully\r\n\r\nconsidered  in  terms  of present  and  future  health\r\n\r\nneeds.  The  relevant  laws in  other  countries  were\r\n\r\nlooked  into, that is, the British Public Health  Act,\r\n\r\nthe  New  Zealand Public Health Act and the  New  York\r\n\r\nCity  Health  Code.  The Bill  covers  all  fields  of\r\n\r\nenvironmental  health action except for air  pollution\r\n\r\nand  water  pollution.  While it  was  felt  that  the\r\n\r\npollution of the atmosphere is serious, it has not yet\r\n\r\nassumed  proportions of a major public health problem.\r\n\r\nThe subject of water pollution will be dealt with in a\r\n\r\nseparate  Bill.  The main purpose of the  Bill  is  to\r\n\r\nintegrate  the environmental health functions  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic Health Division and to consolidate the services\r\n\r\nof    public   cleansing,   markets,   hawkers,   food\r\n\r\nestablishments, general health licensing  and  environ\r\n\r\nmental  sanitation  and  hygiene  into  a  single  co-\r\n\r\nordinated  and  cohesive code to be implemented  by  a\r\n\r\nunified authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weaknesses of the present legislation have been\r\n\r\ntightened,  and recent advances and trends  in  public\r\n\r\nhealth  practice  have been incorporated.  Briefly, a\r\n\r\nrealistic  approach  to  the  present-day   needs   of\r\n\r\nSingapore was followed, that is, bringing the law  up-\r\n\r\nto-date    without    necessarily   discarding    such\r\n\r\nlegislative provisions as have been found to be sound,\r\n\r\nworkable  and  have stood the test of  time.  However,\r\n\r\nwhere  existing  provisions have been required  to  be\r\n\r\nrevised, re-drafted and denuded of ambiguity, this has\r\n\r\nbeen   done  so  that  within  the  umbrella  of   one\r\n\r\ncompendious Bill, all necessary provisions relating to\r\n\r\nenvironmental health have\r\n\r\nbeen systematised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am taking this opportunity to highlight some of\r\n\r\nthe notable features and innovations in the Bill:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) An important feature of the new Bill is that\r\n\r\nevery effort\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  been  made  to systematise and  arrange  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  sections  into separate  self-contained\r\n\r\nparts   to   enable  easy  reference  and   imple\r\n\r\nmentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Public Health Authority and the Commissioner\r\n\r\nof  Public  Health  shall  work  subject  to  the\r\n\r\ngeneral or special directions of the Minister.  A\r\n\r\nnecessary  separation of policy and  professional\r\n\r\nfunctions  from  operational functions  is  being\r\n\r\nachieved  as  the  public health responsibilities\r\n\r\nof  Singapore are now too complex to be  combined\r\n\r\nin  one  authority. This will enable  the  separa\r\n\r\ntion of line and staff functions and improve  the\r\n\r\nday-to-day  administration  of  the  Act.   These\r\n\r\nprovisions are parallel to those in the  recently\r\n\r\nenacted  Destruction  of Disease-Bearing  Insects\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Major changes have been brought in the\r\n\r\nprovisions  for public cleansing in Part  III  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  to tackle the massive public cleansing\r\n\r\nproblems in an urban community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Part VI provides for the licensing of food\r\n\r\nestablishments  and  contains  provisions   which\r\n\r\nensure  a  more effective and rational  approach.\r\n\r\nThe  existing  laws are not very satisfactory  as\r\n\r\nthere  was  overlap between different legislation\r\n\r\n(e.g.,  the Food and Drugs Ordinance);  moreover,\r\n\r\ntheir content was also inadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Part XII seeks to regulate and control swimming\r\n\r\npools  and public swimming pools (as defined)  by\r\n\r\nlicensure: no control now exists and it  is  felt\r\n\r\nthat if these remain un-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchecked,  they  will  grow into  a  serious  health\r\n\r\nhazard  in  the future. The extent of eye-infection\r\n\r\nand  other infections from such swimming  pools  is\r\n\r\non the increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) With the increasing and intense urban development\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  towards  multi-storey   structure,\r\n\r\nfuneral  parlours will come into  more  prominence\r\n\r\nthough  at  present  this  is  only  an  incipient\r\n\r\nproblem.  Hence,  provisions  have  been  made  to\r\n\r\nregulate  funeral parlours (Part XIII).  The  fact\r\n\r\nthat  funeral  parlours come under  Part  XIII  is\r\n\r\npurely incidental.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) Another innovation is the efficacious power given\r\n\r\nto   the  Commissioner,  the  Medical  Officer  of\r\n\r\nHealth  and the Public Health Engineer to  execute\r\n\r\nthe  necessary works specified in a notice in  the\r\n\r\nevent of failure to comply by the persons on  whom\r\n\r\nsuch  notice  had been served and,  what  is  more\r\n\r\nimportant,   the  power  to  recover   costs   and\r\n\r\nexpenses  of such works. Such action can be  taken\r\n\r\nwithout prejudice to any proceedings that  may  be\r\n\r\ninstituted  against the offender,  whether  before\r\n\r\nor  after the commencement or conclusion  of  such\r\n\r\nproceedings;    this   is   important    in    the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  where  the  default   or   omission\r\n\r\ncauses  a nuisance or offence to the community  at\r\n\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) To speed up enforcement action, powers have been\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the Commissioner to compound  specified\r\n\r\noffences   committed  under  this   Act   or   any\r\n\r\nregulations made there under. Provisions are  also\r\n\r\nmade  under certain sections for offenders  to  be\r\n\r\nticketed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) For the first time comprehensive provisions with\r\n\r\nheavy penalties have been included\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  deal  with  littering by persons  and  from\r\n\r\nmoving vehicles in public places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j) There has been a general upward revision of\r\n\r\npenalties   so   that   they   are   not   only\r\n\r\ncommensurate  with the offence but  also  serve\r\n\r\nas a deterrent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is a more detailed review of the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the new Bill:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part I (Preliminary) sets out the definitions\r\n\r\nnecessary  for purposes of the Bill. In  view  of  the\r\n\r\nomnibus  nature of the Bill, the Minister is empowered\r\n\r\nto   appoint  different  dates  for  the  coming  into\r\n\r\noperation  of  the different Parts or  the  provisions\r\n\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II (Administration) deals with the manner in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Act  is  to be administered.  The  overall\r\n\r\nprofessional  direction will be vested in  the  Public\r\n\r\nHealth Authority consisting of the senior professional\r\n\r\nhealth officials of the Ministry. This is provided  in\r\n\r\nclause  3.  The Act itself will be administered  by  a\r\n\r\n\"Commissioner of Public Health\", who, under clause  4,\r\n\r\nwill  be assisted by such Deputy and Assistant  Commis\r\n\r\nsioner as may be necessary. Provisions have been  made\r\n\r\nin  clause 5 for the appointment of one or more public\r\n\r\nhealth  engineers,  in  clause  6  for  public  health\r\n\r\nauxiliaries and other employees, and in clause  7  for\r\n\r\nthe appointment of committees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III (Public Cleansing) deals with all aspects\r\n\r\nof public cleansing in an urban setting - cleansing of\r\n\r\npublic  streets,  private streets,  removal  of  trade\r\n\r\nrefuse  and  the collection and removal of refuse  and\r\n\r\nnightsoil. The Commissioner is empowered, under clause\r\n\r\n12,  to make applicable systems for the collection and\r\n\r\nremoval of refuse and nightsoil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the removal of refuse particularly\r\n\r\nfrom  blocks  of  flats, housing  estates,  industrial\r\n\r\ncomplexes and the like, provisions have been  made  in\r\n\r\nclause  16  whereby the Commissioner may  require  any\r\n\r\ndeveloper  (as  defined) or owner  or  owners  of  any\r\n\r\npremises or group of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npremises  to  provide or construct  at  their  expense\r\n\r\ndustbins  and  other  convenient receptacles  and  for\r\n\r\nrefuse  bin  centres to be constructed at  appropriate\r\n\r\nsituations within the property wherein may  be  placed\r\n\r\ndustbins and other receptacles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increase in multi-storey developments where\r\n\r\nremoval  of refuse is by means of a refuse chute,  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility for maintaining such refuse chutes  has\r\n\r\nbeen  placed  on  the owners of any building  or  part\r\n\r\nthereof  served by such chute. This is  laid  down  in\r\n\r\nclause 17.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 provides that the occupier of any house or\r\n\r\npremises who keeps or allows any refuse or filth to be\r\n\r\nkept  for  more than 48 hours, causing a  nuisance  to\r\n\r\nneighbours, will be liable on conviction to a fine not\r\n\r\nexceeding  $500, and to a further fine  not  exceeding\r\n\r\n$50  for  every  day  during  which  the  offence   is\r\n\r\ncontinued after conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an expressed prohibition in clause 22\r\n\r\nagainst  unauthorised  collection  of  nightsoil   and\r\n\r\nagainst refusal of any service provided by the  Commis\r\n\r\nsioner  for  the collection and removal of  nightsoil.\r\n\r\nThe sale of nightsoil is prohibited in clause 23.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said just now, for the first time,\r\n\r\ncomprehensive   provisions   against   littering   and\r\n\r\ndepositing  refuse in public places (as defined)  and,\r\n\r\ninteralia,  against  drying of food,  spilling  earth,\r\n\r\nthrowing or leaving behind any bottle, food container,\r\n\r\netc.,  in  public places are contained in  clause  26.\r\n\r\nThese  offences render a person liable, on conviction,\r\n\r\nto  a fine not exceeding $500, and in case of a second\r\n\r\nand  subsequent  conviction to a  fine  not  exceeding\r\n\r\n$2,000. A more severe penalty for a first offence will\r\n\r\nbe   imposed  on  any  person  who,  during   building\r\n\r\noperations,  deposits  building  materials,  etc.,  in\r\n\r\npublic  places or fails to take reasonable precautions\r\n\r\nto  prevent  the danger to the life or  well-being  of\r\n\r\npersons using the public places or from such things as\r\n\r\nfalling dust or fragments. This is laid down in clause\r\n\r\n27.  For  speedy enforcement, any person  contravening\r\n\r\nclause 26 or 27 is liable to be ticketed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV (Markets) provides for the proper licensing\r\n\r\nand  control  of  public markets  as  well  as  private\r\n\r\nmarkets,   including   the  medical   examination   and\r\n\r\nimmunisation of stall-holders. At the moment,  the  law\r\n\r\nfor  the  control  of  private markets  is  inadequate.\r\n\r\nBesides,  stall-holders are not permitted under  clause\r\n\r\n35  to erect any extension or effect any alteration  to\r\n\r\nany  stall in any market without the permission of  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner.  Clause 36 imposes the responsibility  on\r\n\r\nlicensees and stall-holders to keep markets and  stalls\r\n\r\nin  a  clean  and sanitary condition and penalties  for\r\n\r\nfailure  to  take such steps. In case  of  default  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  can carry out the work and recover  costs\r\n\r\nand expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V (Hawkers) contains effective provisions for\r\n\r\nthe   control   of  hawkers.  Clause  38   specifically\r\n\r\nprohibits  hawkers from hawking within 50  yards  of  a\r\n\r\nmarket,   school,   hospital,  government   dispensary,\r\n\r\nclinic,  place  of  worship  or  police  station.  Food\r\n\r\nhawkers  will be required to be medically examined  and\r\n\r\nimmunised  against infectious diseases. The  provisions\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to the licensing and control  of  hawkers\r\n\r\noperating  stalls and itinerant hawkers have  been  re-\r\n\r\nenacted with some amendments in clauses 40 and 41.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI (Food Establishments) provides for the\r\n\r\nlicensing  of food establishments (as defined)  as  set\r\n\r\nout  in  the  First Schedule to the Bill  and  contains\r\n\r\nprovisions  which ensure a more effective and  rational\r\n\r\napproach  on  this  subject.  Similar  provisions  with\r\n\r\nregard  to  the  employment of persons  suffering  from\r\n\r\ninfectious  diseases and also their medical examination\r\n\r\nand  immunisation against infectious diseases have been\r\n\r\nincorporated. The Minister is empowered under clause 48\r\n\r\nto  make  regulations covering various matters relating\r\n\r\nto the control of food establishments like preparation,\r\n\r\nstorage,  transport and sale of food and to secure  the\r\n\r\nobservance  of  hygienic conditions  and  practices  in\r\n\r\nconnection therewith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VII (Public Nuisance) generally re-enacts with\r\n\r\nsome   amendments   and  heavier   penalties   existing\r\n\r\nprovisions relating to public nuisances. Its scope  has\r\n\r\nbeen  widened  to include pollution of reservoirs  used\r\n\r\nfor  the storage of water for public consumption. Where\r\n\r\nany  nuisance  arises  from  any  want  or  defect   of\r\n\r\nstructural character, this shall be dealt with  by  the\r\n\r\nChief Building Surveyor under clause 49.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VIII (Insanitary buildings and obstructive\r\n\r\nbuildings) confers more efficacious powers to deal with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) premises which are in a filthy or unwholesome\r\n\r\nstate or overgrown with rank vegetation or in an\r\n\r\ninsanitary state as to be a danger to the health\r\n\r\nof  the persons in the premises or in the  neigh\r\n\r\nbourhood;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) houses or buildings requiring to be cleansed,\r\n\r\nlime-washed or disinfected for sanitary reasons;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) rat or vermin infested premises constituting a\r\n\r\nhealth hazard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical officers of health and public health\r\n\r\nengineers  may in all these cases direct the  owner  or\r\n\r\noccupier by notice in writing to take such measures  as\r\n\r\nare  considered necessary, and on non - compliance with\r\n\r\nthe  notice, to execute the measures specified  in  the\r\n\r\nnotice  and  to  recover  costs  and  expenses  thereby\r\n\r\nincurred by the person in default. Such action  may  be\r\n\r\ntaken without prejudice to any proceedings against  the\r\n\r\noffender  and  whether before or after the commencement\r\n\r\nor conclusion of such proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IX (Sanitary conveniences, drains, sewers and\r\n\r\nwells)  contains a number of new provisions. Clause  67\r\n\r\nprovides   that  before  approving  plans,  the   Chief\r\n\r\nBuilding Surveyor may consult the Commissioner  on  the\r\n\r\nadequacy of sanitary conveniences provided for the  new\r\n\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owners of buildings will now be required under\r\n\r\nclauses  68  and  69  to  make  good  insufficient  and\r\n\r\ndefective\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsanitary  conveniences  and  to  carry  out  necessary\r\n\r\nrepairs  and maintenance. Clause 70 provides that  any\r\n\r\nbuilding  which  is  used  as  a  workplace  shall  be\r\n\r\nprovided   with  adequate  and  satisfactory  sanitary\r\n\r\nconveniences as the Commissioner may deem fit.  Clause\r\n\r\n72  provides  for  the proper care of  sanitary  conve\r\n\r\nniences  that  are used in common by  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic or by the employees or in common by two or more\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obstruction, diversion, covering or any\r\n\r\ninterference  with any public drain or  public  water-\r\n\r\ncourse  without prior approval in writing of  the  Com\r\n\r\nmissioner   is   prohibited  under  clause   75.   The\r\n\r\nconstruction and maintenance of private  drains  in  a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory state is provided for in clause 76.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part X (General health requirements for buildings)\r\n\r\ncontains  a  new  measure whereby the  Chief  Building\r\n\r\nSurveyor   may,   under   clause   80,   consult   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  on the health and sanitary  requirements\r\n\r\nof  any  new buildings before approving any plans  and\r\n\r\nspecifications thereto, and, in so far as is possible,\r\n\r\nto  give effect to any advice that may be tendered  by\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner.  Clause 81 requires  the  owner  or\r\n\r\noccupier  or the lessee of any building to  which  the\r\n\r\npublic  have access to keep such building  or  portion\r\n\r\nthereof  in  a  clean condition. The  Commissioner  is\r\n\r\nempowered  under  clause 82 to  require  employers  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  their  employees if  the  conditions  or\r\n\r\ncircumstances  under  which  such  employees  work  so\r\n\r\nwarrant, suitable and sufficient facilities by way  of\r\n\r\nmess rooms, rest rooms, canteens or changing rooms  or\r\n\r\nto improve upon the same if the Commissioner considers\r\n\r\nthe  existing facilities inadequate. Under clause  83,\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner may also direct the owner,  occupier\r\n\r\nor  lessee of any premises to take proper measures  to\r\n\r\ncontrol offensive conditions that may occur within his\r\n\r\npremises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part XI (Offensive trades) re-enacts with amendments\r\n\r\nexisting provisions for the licensing of premises used\r\n\r\nfor purposes of the offensive trades set\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout in the Second Schedule.

The\r\n\r\nintention is good because he wants Singapore to become\r\n\r\nthe  cleanest  city  in this part  of  the  world.  In\r\n\r\nOctober,  he  launched  an island-wide  public  health\r\n\r\ncampaign which received the general support of  people\r\n\r\nof  all walks of life. He has now consolidated all the\r\n\r\noriginal   laws  on  public  health   and   has   also\r\n\r\nincorporated new provisions into the Bill  before  the\r\n\r\nHouse.  The  move to introduce this Bill is worthwhile\r\n\r\nand will win the support of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill contains some very strict provisions which\r\n\r\nwill  affect the livelihood of our people,  especially\r\n\r\nthose living in the rural areas. These provisions,  if\r\n\r\nstrictly implemented, may cause a lot of inconvenience\r\n\r\nto  them. Clause 24 which prohibits the use of  night-\r\n\r\nsoil or human excreta as manure is one such provision.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  think you will agree with me that  the  rural\r\n\r\npeople  are  generally poor. Their livelihood  depends\r\n\r\nmainly on agriculture, the rearing of pigs, etc.  They\r\n\r\nuse  human  excreta as manure for the  cultivation  of\r\n\r\nvegetables. Those farmers who do not plant  vegetables\r\n\r\nsell  the  excreta from their domestic  animals.  This\r\n\r\nexcreta  can also be used as fertiliser for  vegetable\r\n\r\ngardening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some provisions in the Bill will cause hardship and\r\n\r\nan  additional financial burden - to the farmers.  One\r\n\r\nof  the reasons is that they will have to spend  money\r\n\r\non  the  construction of a hygienic  pond  to  collect\r\n\r\nmanure and night-soil. This pond needs at least a  few\r\n\r\nhundred  dollars to build. Generally, the farmers  are\r\n\r\nunable to shoulder such a burden.In addition to  this,\r\n\r\nafter  constructing a hygienic pond to collect  manure\r\n\r\nand  night-soil, it is necessary for  the  farmers  to\r\n\r\nengage people to do the collecting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  manure and night-soil. As a result, they will have\r\n\r\nto  incur  additional expenses. If they are unable  to\r\n\r\nsell their manure, their income will decrease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that if nightsoil or human excreta\r\n\r\nis  not allowed to be used as manure, then the farmers\r\n\r\nwill have to buy chemical fertilisers as a substitute.\r\n\r\nChemical  fertilisers are expensive  and  the  farmers\r\n\r\nfind  it  difficult to pay for them. This is an  added\r\n\r\nfinancial  burden on them and they will find  it  more\r\n\r\ndifficult to make a living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that we will not be too strict in the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  the  provisions   of   the   Bill,\r\n\r\notherwise the livelihood of the rural people  will  be\r\n\r\ngreatly  affected. I also hope that the Minister  will\r\n\r\ndeal with the problems carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.45p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, proceeding on the\r\n\r\nprinciple that brevity is the soul of wit, I shall try\r\n\r\nto  be as brief as possible. Sir, much as I agree with\r\n\r\nthe  Minister that the campaign to get rid of dirt and\r\n\r\nsqualor must be pursued relentlessly. I must express a\r\n\r\nregret  that this Bill is being taken through  tonight\r\n\r\nat  this  unearthly  hour. Frankly speaking,  Sir,  in\r\n\r\ntrying to go through the Bill last night, I managed to\r\n\r\ncover about 10 pages only and I came across 18 penalty\r\n\r\nclauses  and about ten forced payment clauses  whereby\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry officials can undertake construction  or\r\n\r\nwork  and cause the defaulter to pay the Ministry  the\r\n\r\ncost of that undertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a harsh Bill, Sir. Some of the provisions are\r\n\r\nhighly  loaded and, in fact, some of them are  double-\r\n\r\nbarrelled.  If I may refer the Minister, for  example,\r\n\r\nto clause 26 (7) , which, in my opinion, is a provision\r\n\r\nthat  can  impose excessive hardship. You  will  note,\r\n\r\nSir, that this clause reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Upon a person arrested in pursuance of a warrant\r\n\r\nissued  under  subsection (6) of  this  section  being\r\n\r\nproduced before it,..'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  other  words, this is the case of the accused  not\r\n\r\nhaving  complied  with  the summons  and  therefore  a\r\n\r\nwarrant of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narrest  has  been  issued and  the  accused  has  been\r\n\r\napprehended. It continues to\r\n\r\nread:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...a Court shall proceed as though he were produced\r\n\r\nbefore it in pursuance of\r\n\r\nsubsection  (1)  of  this section  and  shall  at  the\r\n\r\nconclusion of such proceedings...'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That means the proceedings in sub-clause (1) . In other\r\n\r\nwords,  the  accused  shall be  tried  and,  if  found\r\n\r\nconvicted, it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'... call upon him to show cause why he should not\r\n\r\nbe punished for failing to attend\r\n\r\nin  compliance with the notice delivered to him and if\r\n\r\ncause  be not shown may order him to pay such  penalty\r\n\r\nnot exceeding two thousand dollars as the Court thinks\r\n\r\nfit  or  may  commit  him to prison  for  a  term  not\r\n\r\nexceeding two months.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  other words, if the accused has not complied  with\r\n\r\nthe  summons,  a warrant is issued to arrest  him  and\r\n\r\nbring him before the Court. There he is tried for  the\r\n\r\nsubstantive offence and convicted thereon. Having been\r\n\r\nconvicted, he is also asked to show cause why  he  did\r\n\r\nnot  comply  with the original summons  in  the  first\r\n\r\nplace  and he is again convicted. Sir, this is what  I\r\n\r\nmean  by a double-barrelled provision. I think  it  is\r\n\r\nunnecessarily harsh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another unhappy clause, if I may refer the Minister\r\n\r\nto it, is clause 19 (2) which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Without prejudice to any proceeding& under\r\n\r\nsubsection (1) of this section and whether  before  or\r\n\r\nafter   the   commencement  or  conclusion   of   such\r\n\r\nproceedings, the cause of the nuisance may be  removed\r\n\r\nby the Commissioner.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  is where you might have a case pending, and  it\r\n\r\ncontinues to say:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...who may recover the costs and expenses thereby\r\n\r\nincurred from the occupier\r\n\r\nor  the  owner of the house or premises in the  manner\r\n\r\nprovided under section 119 of this Act.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Where  the  accused is the occupier or  owner  of  the\r\n\r\nhouse, there is a case proceeding against him and  the\r\n\r\nnuisance:  is removed. In other words, the exhibit  of\r\n\r\nthe case is removed and his whole case might depend on\r\n\r\nthat  exhibit.  So, first of all, he is prejudiced  to\r\n\r\nthe extent that the exhibit is removed and,, secondly,\r\n\r\nhe has got to pay the cost of the removal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am rather unhappy with such provisions. Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe Minister may have some explanation because, as he\r\n\r\nsaid, the preparation of this Bill has taken about  a\r\n\r\nyear.  But  I must express a regret that  this  is  a\r\n\r\nharsh  Bill  and,  unfortunately,  we  do  not   have\r\n\r\nsufficient time to ponder over it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nlike the Member for Jurong, I feel compelled to voice\r\n\r\nmy  apprehension over the likely adverse effects upon\r\n\r\nthe  agricultural sector if certain  clauses  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  are to be enforced immediately. The Member  for\r\n\r\nJurong  has touched upon clause 24 and other  clauses\r\n\r\nin  the Bill where the farming communities are likely\r\n\r\nto be affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would request that a period of grace be allowed\r\n\r\nafter this Bill has become law, during which time the\r\n\r\nattention  of  the  communities  may  be  drawn  more\r\n\r\nclosely to the changes under the law. In this regard,\r\n\r\nperhaps  some  arrangements  can  be  made  with  the\r\n\r\nvarious  centres of the Primary Production Department\r\n\r\nand  the community centres in the rural areas whereby\r\n\r\nthey  will  help  in explaining to  the  farmers  the\r\n\r\npractical implications of the relevant sections under\r\n\r\nthe law. In all cases of offences in the rural areas,\r\n\r\nwarnings should preferably be issued first before any\r\n\r\npunitive action is taken during the initial period of\r\n\r\nimplementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In putting forward this appeal on behalf of the\r\n\r\nrural folk, I should perhaps mention that in a number\r\n\r\nof areas in the rural districts there are still inade\r\n\r\nquate sewerage and drainage systems. The disposal  of\r\n\r\nrubbish  is  also  a  headache  in  the  absence   of\r\n\r\nprovision  for  a collection service  by  the  Public\r\n\r\nHealth  Department.

In order to ensure a continuation  of\r\n\r\nthis  high standard, the Minister has tabled in  this\r\n\r\nHouse a Bill known as the Environmental Public Health\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is being introduced with all good\r\n\r\nintentions  and  deserves our  support.  But  in  the\r\n\r\nenforcement  of  this Bill there are  some  technical\r\n\r\nproblems  and  difficulties which may  give  rise  to\r\n\r\npublic  inconvenience  and we  have  some  misgivings\r\n\r\nabout  it.  From November this year, the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth has taken action to ensure the observance of a\r\n\r\nhigh  standard of public health among the  people.  I\r\n\r\nhave since received several complaints against police\r\n\r\nofficers  and  public  health  inspectors  for  their\r\n\r\nunreasonableness. According to the law, every  hawker\r\n\r\nis  required to provide a receptacle beside his stall\r\n\r\nand  to  maintain general hygienic conditions  around\r\n\r\nhis stall. The provision does not clearly say whether\r\n\r\nthat has to be complied with during the peak hours of\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one bean-sprouts (tow gay) hawker who is\r\n\r\nlicensed to do business in the morning and when he is\r\n\r\nkept  busy  during morning business hours, action  is\r\n\r\ntaken  against  him for not keeping  his  pitch  area\r\n\r\nclean.  There  is another place where the  unlicensed\r\n\r\nhawkers  customarily congregate. One  morning,  after\r\n\r\nthe unlicensed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\nhawkers   were   chased  away  by  the   Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board staff, there was a heap  of  rubbish\r\n\r\nleft  outside a coffee-shop. Soon after, two policemen\r\n\r\ncame  and took down the particulars of the coffee-shop\r\n\r\nowner for an offence for which he was not responsible.\r\n\r\nFrom  these  instances,  we  can  see  that  the   law\r\n\r\nenforcement officers did not know what they should  do\r\n\r\nso  as  not to cause any unhappiness among members  of\r\n\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will take note of this and give\r\n\r\nsuitable  instructions to the officers regarding  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.57 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Sir, I can only speak as the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Joo  Chiat. Jon Chiat constituency  is  a\r\n\r\nrelatively clean area compared with many other  areas.\r\n\r\nBut  there are a number of black spots. These are  the\r\n\r\nkampongs  and  back-lanes.  The  properties   in   the\r\n\r\nkampongs  are mainly privately owned and are not  very\r\n\r\nhealthy due to the presence of the cesspools there.  A\r\n\r\nlack of proper drainage has caused these cesspools  to\r\n\r\nbe  formed. They are thus found in the low-lying areas\r\n\r\nof  these  kampongs. Not unnaturally,  mosquitoes  and\r\n\r\nflies thrive, leading to a mosquito or fly \"population\r\n\r\nexplosion\".  I am afraid the owners of the  properties\r\n\r\nin  these kampongs are not particularly susceptible to\r\n\r\nverbal or polite requests to construct proper drainage\r\n\r\nsystems  for their properties. Sir, clause 76  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  will  undoubtediy go far towards  improving  the\r\n\r\nhygienic and health standards of the dwellers in these\r\n\r\nkampongs and also in the surrounding areas when proper\r\n\r\ndrainage is enforced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back-lanes are also one of my headaches. Back-lanes\r\n\r\nwere  originally  used for night-soil  collection  and\r\n\r\nperhaps even for fire escape purposes. Today, with the\r\n\r\nintroduction of a modern sewerage system in Joo Chiat,\r\n\r\nthe  back-lanes  have  been neglected  by  the  health\r\n\r\nauthorities  and  are slowly but surely  reverting  to\r\n\r\nminiature  lalang jungles.

I am sure through the efforts  of  a  very\r\n\r\ndetermined  Minister  for  Health  and  also   equally\r\n\r\ndetermined  members of his staff,  Singapore  will  be\r\n\r\nhealthier and cleaner in the years to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>9.00p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, a few moments\r\n\r\nago, the Minister for Health moved\r\n\r\nthe  Second  Reading  of a Bill which  is  fascist  in\r\n\r\ncharacter.

Singapore was  already  clean\r\n\r\nenough  before this Bill was brought up. We  must  use\r\n\r\npersuasion  on the people to cultivate  the  habit  of\r\n\r\ncleanliness.  We  must not impose heavy  penalties  to\r\n\r\nforce  them  to  do  so. We can hold  competitions  in\r\n\r\ncleanliness  among them and encourage  them  to  adopt\r\n\r\nclean  habits.

A committee  comprising\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of hawkers, market  stallholders  and\r\n\r\nflat-dwellers  - in fact, representatives  of  people\r\n\r\nfrom  all  walks of life - should be set  up  to  look\r\n\r\nafter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic health. We do not have to resort to harsh  laws\r\n\r\nbeing rushed through this Parliament to promote public\r\n\r\nhealth.  In  my  opinion, this ~ not a proper  way  of\r\n\r\ngoing about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, I certainly\r\n\r\nwould not like to be accused of approaching this  Bill\r\n\r\nwith a pitiless heart as evinced by the Member for J00\r\n\r\nChiat and perhaps even by the Minister for Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>9.04 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think it may be proper for me to say that the\r\n\r\nBill  has  come  at  the right time  after  the  right\r\n\r\npsychological attitudes have been developed among  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore as a result of the recent  health\r\n\r\ncampaign.  The  Bill introduces for  the  first  time,\r\n\r\nunder  pain of penal sanctions, a complete  system  of\r\n\r\nhygiene  which is necessary if we are to cash  in  and\r\n\r\nsee   to  it  that  we  do  not  fall  back  on   past\r\n\r\nmisdemeanours after the health campaign that  we  have\r\n\r\ngone through. It is true to say that the penal clauses\r\n\r\nintroduced  all  over the Bill are a  bit  severe.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  as  a  lawyer  trained  in  the  rudiments   of\r\n\r\nhumanism,  I  think the penal clauses go  against  the\r\n\r\ngrain.  It  may be difficult for doctors to understand\r\n\r\nthis!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to expand a little bit on Part XIII of\r\n\r\nthe Bill which, as the Minister has said, consolidates\r\n\r\nexisting  provisions  in so far as  a  crematorium  is\r\n\r\nconcerned. We have an old crematorium in Mount  Vernon\r\n\r\nwhich, unfortunately, is not being used as effectively\r\n\r\nas  it  ought  to be. Most people do not know  of  its\r\n\r\nexistence.  I  would like to say that, for  all  these\r\n\r\npeople who are not inhibited by either convictions  or\r\n\r\nreligion, some kind of campaign ought to be started by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Health to encourage the use  of  this\r\n\r\ncrematorium so that we can be spared the use of a  lot\r\n\r\nof  land  which is a very precious commodity in  Singa\r\n\r\npore.  The Ministry could start an educative  campaign\r\n\r\nfor people - especially\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore  they die - so that they may be able to convert\r\n\r\ntheir  respective families to the view that once  they\r\n\r\ndie  they  would  want  their bodies  to  be  cremated\r\n\r\ninstead of buried. If this kind of transformation  can\r\n\r\nbe brought about,, then, of course, a lot of land will\r\n\r\nbe  saved and we will not have to go into the  problem\r\n\r\nof exhumation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of the severe penal clauses, I would\r\n\r\nalso  like  to  refer to clauses 109 and  110.  Severe\r\n\r\ninroads  have  already been made into  the  rights  of\r\n\r\nprivate property. I think these two clauses are a  bit\r\n\r\ntoo   much.  They  give  unnecessary  powers  to   the\r\n\r\nauthorities  concerned with regard to the  payment  of\r\n\r\ncompensation  to  the owners of property.  Clause  109\r\n\r\ndeals  with  the power to enter on lands  adjacent  to\r\n\r\nworks   and  to  take  over  the  lands  for  specific\r\n\r\npurposes.  Clause 110 exonerates people who take  over\r\n\r\nthe  lands from whatever misdemeanours they  may  have\r\n\r\ncommitted  in  the  course of their duties.  I  wonder\r\n\r\nsometimes  whether such provisions are  necessary  not\r\n\r\nmerely in this particular Bill but also in other Bills\r\n\r\nwhich  are being brought up in this Parliament by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, I would like to congratulate the\r\n\r\nMinister on having introduced this Bill. It may  be  a\r\n\r\nnecessarily  painful Bill, but I  think  many  of  the\r\n\r\npenal  clauses could have been watered down  and  made\r\n\r\nfar  more  humane. Perhaps in the application  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  itself, some form of humanism will be  shown  by\r\n\r\nthe authorities concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>9.09 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  thank the various. Members who spoke in support of\r\n\r\nor at least agreed in principle with the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I reply to certain valid points raised by hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  in  order to clarify the whole position?  The\r\n\r\nfirst  refers to the prohibition of the sale of night-\r\n\r\nsoil  and the prohibition of the use of night-soil  as\r\n\r\nmanure. This point was raised by the Member for Jurong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the Member for Jalan Kayu. Mr Speaker, Sir, from\r\n\r\nthe  health point of view, night-soil, in fact, is not\r\n\r\na  suitable manure for vegetables. In April this year,\r\n\r\nthe  day  after  I  took  office,  we  had  a  cholera\r\n\r\nepidemic.  I think common sense will tell us  -  apart\r\n\r\nfrom  the  advice of doctors that it is very dangerous\r\n\r\nto  use  night-soil as manure. There can be  a  severe\r\n\r\nepidemic  outbreak in Singapore if the  night-soil  is\r\n\r\ncontaminated. This is definitely not in  the  interest\r\n\r\nof the community at large. I do sympathise in the same\r\n\r\nway  as  other Members with the plight of the farmers.\r\n\r\nBut  I  believe that farmers should keep up  with  the\r\n\r\ntimes. After all, we are now living in a technological\r\n\r\nage.  The  farmers should switch over to  the  use  of\r\n\r\nartificial manure or other types of manure than  human\r\n\r\nexcreta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu said that a certain period\r\n\r\nof  grace should be given before the provisions in the\r\n\r\nBill  are  implemented. Mr Speaker, Sir,  we  in  the\r\n\r\nHealth Ministry are reasonable people. We always  give\r\n\r\nthe  required warnings. As I have often said, we  only\r\n\r\npunish  the  incorrigibles and the  recalcitrants.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  many of the summonses issued are against  those\r\n\r\npeople who are quite incorrigible. But when they  come\r\n\r\nto   the  \"meet-the-people\"  session,  they  tell  sad\r\n\r\nstories  and  make  themselves out  as  very  pleasant\r\n\r\npeople and paint the public health officers as devils.\r\n\r\nI  can assure hon. Members that public health officers\r\n\r\nact  with  discretion and that action  is  taken  only\r\n\r\nafter warnings have been issued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens and the Member for\r\n\r\nBukit Panjang remarked that this is a harsh Bill. I do\r\n\r\nrealise that both the hon. Members are members of  the\r\n\r\nlegal  profession. They do have to plead in mitigation\r\n\r\nwhen  they  go to court. So I can well understand  the\r\n\r\nthinking  that prompted them to say that the  Bill  is\r\n\r\ntoo harsh. On the other hand, the Member for J00 Chiat\r\n\r\nis more a realistic person. He said that the Bill does\r\n\r\nnot  go far enough. I leave it to Members of the House\r\n\r\nto  judge  for themselves. We should not whittle  down\r\n\r\nthe clauses of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Bill in such a way as to make it ineffective.  If\r\n\r\nwe pass a Bill with no teeth in it, our time here will\r\n\r\nhave  been wasted. I would like to inform hon. Members\r\n\r\nthat  we in the Health Ministry are reasonable  people\r\n\r\nand  that we will use our discretion when we implement\r\n\r\nthe  Bill. Contrary to what the Member for Ulu  Pandan\r\n\r\nhas  said,  we  are  not  Fascists  in  our  attitude.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, having made the accusation, the  Member\r\n\r\nhas  left this Chamber. He has not waited for a reply.\r\n\r\nIncidentally,  if he says that we are undemocratic,  I\r\n\r\ncannot  see  how  more democratic we can  be  than  by\r\n\r\nhaving this debate on all the provisions of the  Bill.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Member for Ulu Pandan  having  made\r\n\r\nthe accusation has left the Chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. There was much mention about\r\n\r\nthe  costs and expenses to be recovered from work that\r\n\r\nis  undertaken by the Health Ministry. Unless we  have\r\n\r\nsuch  a  provision,  I  am  afraid  it  will  not   be\r\n\r\neffective, because if we do not recover the costs  and\r\n\r\nexpenses, then everyone will create nuisances and just\r\n\r\ninvite  the Health Ministry to do the work. They  will\r\n\r\nget the work done free and this will encourage them to\r\n\r\ncreate  more  nuisances in the future.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  now that we have the provision to recover costs\r\n\r\nand  expenses,  I  am quite sure that  it  will  be  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent to members of the public not to create  such\r\n\r\nnuisances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru did say something about\r\n\r\nthe  rudeness of several Health Ministry officials who\r\n\r\nimplemented  the law after 1st November. This  is  the\r\n\r\nfirst time I have heard such a complaint from him.  As\r\n\r\na  matter  of fact, we in the Health Ministry  welcome\r\n\r\nsuch  complaints. If there is any specific allegation,\r\n\r\nwe will certainly look into it. We have even set up an\r\n\r\n\"Operations Room\" and the Member for Tiong  Bahru  can\r\n\r\njust take up the telephone and make his complaint.  In\r\n\r\nother  words,  the  Health Ministry  is  giving  every\r\n\r\nfacility  not only to the Member for Tiong  Bahru  but\r\n\r\nalso   to  members  of  the  public  to  lodge   their\r\n\r\ncomplaints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chua, the Member for Ulu Pandan has\r\n\r\ncome back!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I am glad, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat he has come back. If there are any complaints  of\r\n\r\nrudeness  on the part of Health Ministry officials,  I\r\n\r\nwould  invite not only the Member for Tiong Bahru  but\r\n\r\nevery  Member of this House to specify the allegations\r\n\r\nso  that we can look into them and appropriate  action\r\n\r\ncan  be  taken. In fact, we will be extremely grateful\r\n\r\nto  members  of  the public to come forward  with  the\r\n\r\ncomplaints. As hon. Members know, we are waging a  war\r\n\r\nagainst filth and squalor. To win such a war, we  need\r\n\r\nsufficient \"intelligence\" of what is going on outside.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  we regard such complaints as \"intelligence\"\r\n\r\ninformation and we can very well use it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the point brought up by the Member for\r\n\r\nJoo  Chiat about some black spots in Joo Chiat  consti\r\n\r\ntuency. Here again, the Member for Joo Chiat is  quite\r\n\r\nfree  to take up the telephone and make his complaints\r\n\r\nto  our Operations Room and they will be attended  to.\r\n\r\nWhat I wish to point out is this. The question of back-\r\n\r\nlanes  being  turned into slums is a  general  problem\r\n\r\nwhich  I  do not think the Health Ministry  alone  can\r\n\r\nsolve.  It  needs a number of Ministries to deal  with\r\n\r\nit. If a person puts up an illegal structure in a back-\r\n\r\nlane  and lives in it, it does need action by  way  of\r\n\r\nresettlement. I do not think the Health Ministry alone\r\n\r\ncan deal with the question of resettlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the question of lalang and the\r\n\r\ncementing  of back-lanes. As far as lalang  jungle  or\r\n\r\ntertiary or secondary jungle being allowed to grow  in\r\n\r\nback-lanes   is   concerned,  although   it   is   not\r\n\r\nspecifically  dealt  with  in  this  Bill,  there  are\r\n\r\nprovisions   in  the  Destruction  of  Disease-Bearing\r\n\r\nInsects  Act to deal with this problem, if the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Joo  Chiat remembers. If it does create nuisances\r\n\r\nor  causes the breeding of insects, appropriate action\r\n\r\ncan  be  taken  under  the Act.  With  regard  to  the\r\n\r\ncementing of back-lanes, as the Minister for Health, I\r\n\r\nwould  be  happy  to have back-lanes cemented  because\r\n\r\nthat would solve my problem. But the Member for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoo  Chiat will understand that it does need money  to\r\n\r\nbuy  the  cement and get the work done. As our Finance\r\n\r\nMinister told us last week, we have to operate  within\r\n\r\na  certain budget. I suggest the Member for Joo  Chiat\r\n\r\ngo round with the Citizens' Consultative Committee and\r\n\r\ncollect some money for this job. The work of cementing\r\n\r\nthe back-lanes can then be undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan also said that there was\r\n\r\nno  necessity for this Bill to be passed. He said that\r\n\r\nwhat  we  need  do  is just to persuade  people,  hold\r\n\r\ncompetitions and give rewards and so on. He said  that\r\n\r\nthe  success  of  the campaign which  we  launched  in\r\n\r\nOctober  indicated  that  by talking  to  people,  per\r\n\r\nsuading  them, holding competitions, we  could  get  a\r\n\r\ncleaner Singapore. If that were true, I would be  very\r\n\r\nhappy.  We need not then enforce the law to  see  that\r\n\r\nhealth  hazards are not created. I am afraid I do  not\r\n\r\nsubscribe   to  such  idealism.  Even  in  the   \"Keep\r\n\r\nSingapore Clean\" campaign, which was the final  effort\r\n\r\nto  put  the message across, there was always  at  the\r\n\r\nback  of the minds of the people the thought that  law\r\n\r\nenforcement  would  follow as from 1st  November,  and\r\n\r\nthat   did,  to  some  extent,  contribute  to  making\r\n\r\nSingapore  a  cleaner place. It was not just  the  com\r\n\r\npetitions and persuasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point brought up by the Member for Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan  was that, by having a committee consisting  of\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public - hawkers and  market  stall-\r\n\r\nholders  they  would be in a better position  to  keep\r\n\r\nSingapore clean. If that could be done, I would gladly\r\n\r\nrelinquish  my post as Health Minister and allow  this\r\n\r\ncommittee  to  operate.  But,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  my\r\n\r\nexperience of committees is that there is always a lot\r\n\r\nof talk but very little action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a very relevant point was brought up by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Bukit Panjang concerning the Mount  Vernon\r\n\r\nCrematorium.  According to him, very few  people  know\r\n\r\nabout  its existence and we should organise a campaign\r\n\r\nto publicise its existence. I cannot agree\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  him more that greater use should be made of  the\r\n\r\ncrematorium  because  of  the  shortage  of  land  for\r\n\r\nburial. But I believe we have other more urgent public\r\n\r\nhealth  matters to organise campaigns on than  on  the\r\n\r\nuse  of this crematorium. I believe I have now covered\r\n\r\nthe whole ground of the debate on this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Chua Sian Chin.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [Mr\r\n\r\nChua Sian Chin]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Thirty-five minutes past Nine o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
