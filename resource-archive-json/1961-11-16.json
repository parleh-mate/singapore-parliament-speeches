In so  far  as\r\n\r\nthe  Communists  were with us  in  the  nationalist\r\n\r\nmovement  to  destroy the colonial  system,  I  was\r\n\r\nprepared  to work with them and took my  risk  with\r\n\r\nthem  for  years.

Sir, you will notice that these\r\n\r\nSupplementary Estimates are required  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nincreases under Personal Emoluments as a result  of\r\n\r\npartial restoration of variable allowances from the\r\n\r\n1st  of January this year and full restoration from\r\n\r\nthe 1st of September. That is not the total figure,\r\n\r\nSir. The total figure is much greater. But the rest\r\n\r\nare   offset  seemingly  by  savings  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nincreases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since this Government took\r\n\r\noffice,  the  issue of the variable  allowances  of\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  has  been  made  a  headache - a\r\n\r\nheadache  for  the  Assembly, a  headache  for  the\r\n\r\npeople,  and most of all, Sir, a headache  for  the\r\n\r\ncivil service and particularly 6,000 of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, I am seeking to ask the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to consolidate the variable  allowances\r\n\r\ninto  the  pay of the civil service, so that  there\r\n\r\ncan  be no further reductions. I am not asking that\r\n\r\nthey should receive one cent more of salary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I want is to take the question of the pay of\r\n\r\nthe  civil servants out of politics. Sir, they  are\r\n\r\nentitled to security; they are the very backbone of\r\n\r\nour   administration.  In  fairness  I  think   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will admit our civil service  has  been\r\n\r\nreasonably efficient. And frankly, Sir, I  know  of\r\n\r\nno other civil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice  in  the  whole of Asia with  such  a  high\r\n\r\nstandard  of integrity. In many cases, I think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  frankly  admit  that  the   civil\r\n\r\nservants  are radically underpaid compared  to  the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  we  place  upon   them.   It   is\r\n\r\nimportant  that these human beings,  from  whom  we\r\n\r\nexpect  so  much, should at least have a  sense  of\r\n\r\nsecurity  free  from the possibility  of  political\r\n\r\nintimidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I intend to be brief, Sir, but I ask your\r\n\r\nindulgence to review shortly the history of  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ndealings with the civil service on this one  aspect\r\n\r\nof variable allowances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1959, Sir, this Government took office\r\n\r\nthrough  an  overwhelming vote  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, but it was generally recognised that the\r\n\r\nEnglish-speaking  population, in  all  probability,\r\n\r\ndid not vote for the P.A.P., particularly the civil\r\n\r\nservice.   Before  this  Government  even  appeared\r\n\r\nbefore the Assembly, one of the very first steps it\r\n\r\ntook  was  to slash the variable allowance  of  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service. And in His Excellency's  speech  to\r\n\r\nthis  House outlining Government policy on the  1st\r\n\r\nof July, 1959, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The threatened deficit of S14 million for 1959 can\r\n\r\nhe and will be wiped out and the Government has not\r\n\r\nshrunk   from   unpleasant  measures   to   achieve\r\n\r\nfinancial  stability. But such sacrifices  as  have\r\n\r\nbeen  imposed  by way of pay cuts  have  fallen  on\r\n\r\nthose most able to hear them.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>My  reference,  Sir,  for your record  is  Assembly\r\n\r\nDebates, Vol. 11 No 1. Col. 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Those most able to bear them', Mr Speaker! How\r\n\r\nlittle did the Government recognise that of all our\r\n\r\ncitizens,  the honest civil servants are  the  ones\r\n\r\nwho   budget  most  carefully  according  to  their\r\n\r\nincomes, and any radical reduction means very  real\r\n\r\nhardship. In any event, Sir, as was pointed by  the\r\n\r\nLeader  of the S.P.A. in the debate on the  Address\r\n\r\nin  the following year, on the 8th August, 1960, it\r\n\r\ntranspired  that there was no $14 million  deficit.\r\n\r\nThere was not even a $1 million deficit. There  was\r\n\r\n$9 million surplus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it can be said, Sir, that the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  did  really make so big an error  as  $23\r\n\r\nmillion  in  his  estimate in our inevitably  small\r\n\r\nbudget, why did the Government not restore the  pay\r\n\r\ncuts the moment it was recognised that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  was not going bankrupt? That Singapore,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  was stable and was doing very well?  In\r\n\r\nfact,  there was a surplus and not a deficit.  Why\r\n\r\ndid  they not restore the pay cuts? In fact,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  leader of the S.P.A. - more credit to him - moved\r\n\r\nin  this  Assembly, on the 8th of August, for  the\r\n\r\nrestoration  of the pay cuts. But the  Government,\r\n\r\nusing  its  steamroller  majority,  defeated  that\r\n\r\nmotion. Sir, it is interesting to remember that in\r\n\r\nthis  very Assembly, on 21st July, 1959, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`What they are bellyaching about is not the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of negotiations. The bellyache  is  the\r\n\r\npay cut.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  civil  servant could not even moderately  and\r\n\r\nconstitutionally and legitimately complain about a\r\n\r\npay  cut without being called a \"bellyacher\". That\r\n\r\nwas  the  attitude  of  the  Government,  and,  in\r\n\r\nfairness.  Sir, it is true to say  that  in  those\r\n\r\ndebates,   as   I  have  read  them  in   Hansard,\r\n\r\nGovernment  vehemently denied that  the  pay  cuts\r\n\r\nwere  by  way  of  revenge  against  the  English-educated for not having voted for the P.A.P.  But,\r\n\r\nSir,  what do we see now? From 1st January, after\r\n\r\ntremendous  efforts, a partial restoration:  first\r\n\r\nto those who agreed that that would be final; then\r\n\r\nultimately to all. And then, Sir, lo and behold, a\r\n\r\nmiracle  happened! The pay cuts were  restored  in\r\n\r\nfull   from   the  1st  of  September.   And   His\r\n\r\nExcellency,  in his speech to us last month,  said\r\n\r\nthat  with  merger in prospect it is  possible  to\r\n\r\nrelax  many  of the stringent measures of  economy\r\n\r\npreviously  adopted.  With  \"merger  in  prospect\"\r\n\r\nalso,  Sir, a vast sum of money will no  doubt  be\r\n\r\nvoted  to  the Federation, and we would have  less\r\n\r\nmoney to spend. But be that as it may, Sir, merger\r\n\r\nis two and a half years ahead, if, and I hope with\r\n\r\nall  my heart it does, come to merger. Why  is  it\r\n\r\nthat  the Government is in such a hurry to restore\r\n\r\nthe  pay  cuts now? Sir, in this context,  let  us\r\n\r\nface another fact of life. In 1959, the Government\r\n\r\ncould  say,  \"We  do not care about  the  English-educated.  It  is  the Chinese industrialists  who\r\n\r\nwill vote us into power.\" And they did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The industrial workers, not\r\n\r\nthe industrialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Thank you. I am indebted to the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister. He recognises the P.A.P. stand  so\r\n\r\nwell.  He has aptly and correctly corrected me.  I\r\n\r\naccept  it.  \"We  do not care about  the  English-speaking; it is the Chinese industrial workers who\r\n\r\nwill vote us into power.\" And they did. Today  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister and, I have no doubt, the rest  of\r\n\r\nhis  group  are all too conscious that  they  have\r\n\r\nlost  the  confidence  of the  Chinese  industrial\r\n\r\nworkers.  And if they hope to survive, it  is  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated on whom they are  to  rely.  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhatever  the  motivations of  the  Government,  I\r\n\r\nwould suggest that their conduct does give rise to\r\n\r\nfeelings,  and  legitimate  feelings,   of   fear,\r\n\r\nintimidation  and insecurity on the  part  of  the\r\n\r\ncivil service. I plead, Sir, let us put an end  to\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want them to worry next time we have a\r\n\r\ngeneral  election, having learnt their lesson,  if\r\n\r\nthey vote P.A.P. and suddenly the S.P.A. come into\r\n\r\npower - and miracles do happen - may be they will get\r\n\r\nanother  thrashing.  Let  us  protect  the   civil\r\n\r\nservice,  legitimate protection which  an  honest.\r\n\r\ndecent  group seeks. Many of them could  earn  far\r\n\r\nmore  in  the outside world. They join  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  sometimes out of a sense  of  dedication,\r\n\r\nbut  mostly,  Sir,  because of  their  desire  for\r\n\r\nsecurity.  And  I  say, let us protect  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice from a legitimate deep fear that has grown\r\n\r\nfrom government action of possible intimidation. I\r\n\r\nsay,  let  us help keep the civil service  out  of\r\n\r\npolitics. We all recognise that that is  the  only\r\n\r\nway  in which they can serve the country best.  I,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  move this amendment in order  to  urge\r\n\r\nthe Government to consolidate the pay cuts, not to\r\n\r\npay the civil service more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I thought the motion to  amend  the\r\n\r\nvote under Head 42 by the Member for Anson was, in\r\n\r\nfact,  related to the administration of the Office\r\n\r\nof  the Official Assignee and Public Trustee.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson, however, brought up the  larger\r\n\r\nissue of variable allowances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he made a number of allegations against the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the Party in power in respect of the\r\n\r\nmotive underlying this measure. He claimed that the\r\n\r\nreduction  of  variable allowances was  an  act  of\r\n\r\npolitical  intimidation.  Sir,  we  know  that  the\r\n\r\nMember   for   Anson   is   given   to   oratorical\r\n\r\npyrotechnics. But by no stretch of the  imagination\r\n\r\ncan this measure be called political intimidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959, when the P.A.P. was returned to power,\r\n\r\nthe  prospect ahead of us was by no means easy, it\r\n\r\nis  true we had a formidable majority in the House.\r\n\r\nIt  is also true that at that time we realised that\r\n\r\nthe  struggle  for power in Singapore  between  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  and the non-Communists must  eventually\r\n\r\ncome out into the open. When and over what issue no\r\n\r\none could at that time predict. At that time it was\r\n\r\nclear  that  the  Government of the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya would not even entertain the idea of merger.\r\n\r\nSingapore,   to  all  accounts,  by  all   possible\r\n\r\nforecasts  made by reasoned men at the time,  would\r\n\r\nhave  to  go it alone for a considerable number  of\r\n\r\nsears.  We  are  a small island with no  resources,\r\n\r\nwith   a   bursting  population  and   a   mounting\r\n\r\nunemployment  problem, it is obvious  that,  if  we\r\n\r\nwere  to  survive  as a going concern,  to  provide\r\n\r\nenough jobs for a growing population, there must be\r\n\r\na  tightening of the belt all round. We could do it\r\n\r\nvoluntarily by deliberate Government policy, or  it\r\n\r\ncould  be  imposed through the sheer hard facts  of\r\n\r\neconomic processes. We decided at that time that we\r\n\r\nmust  lay  aside as much savings as  possible  from\r\n\r\ncurrent  income  in order that we  could  have  the\r\n\r\nresources  to mount a substantial rate  of  capital\r\n\r\ndevelopment to ensure that the economy expands fast\r\n\r\nenough to give jobs for the growing population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is so elementary a principle in\r\n\r\neconomics  that  I do not think I need  labour  the\r\n\r\npoint.  When it comes then to tightening the  belt,\r\n\r\nit  is  only  proper that those in  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  provide  leadership,  in  particular  civil\r\n\r\nservants in the higher income bracket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson claims the civil\r\n\r\nservice  has  high  standards. I will  not  dispute\r\n\r\nthat.  I have already paid my compliment in  public\r\n\r\nto  the integrity and effectiveness, within limits,\r\n\r\nof  our  civil service. But he claims that, by  and\r\n\r\nlarge,  they  are  underpaid.  Sir,  this  I   will\r\n\r\ndispute. There are certain categories - professional\r\n\r\nmen - in short supply for whom even the present  rate\r\n\r\nof  pay in Government service will be inadequate in\r\n\r\ncomparison  with  what they  can  earn  in  private\r\n\r\npractice. That is conceded. But the fact that in  a\r\n\r\nfew  occupations members can earn more  in  private\r\n\r\npractice  than  in  Government  service  does   not\r\n\r\nentitle  one  to generalise over the inadequacy  of\r\n\r\npay  in  the whole civil service. I would say  that\r\n\r\nthere  are a priori grounds for believing that  the\r\n\r\nrate  of  pay  in civil service from the  long-term\r\n\r\npoint of view is too high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that the pay of local civil\r\n\r\nservants  has been geared to the pay of  expatriate\r\n\r\nofficers.  The  basic  pay  is  the  same  and  the\r\n\r\nvariable  allowances are the same.  The  expatriate\r\n\r\nofficer  gets some $200 to $250 more as  expatriate\r\n\r\nallowance.   In   respect  of  the   higher-ranking\r\n\r\nofficer, the difference between the pay of a  local\r\n\r\nofficer and his expatriate counterpart may be about\r\n\r\n10 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the factors by which we can assess\r\n\r\nwhether  the  level of pay is adequate  or  not  is\r\n\r\nsurely whether the country can afford that rate  of\r\n\r\npay. One of the criteria we can apply is the wealth\r\n\r\nof  the  country. How does Singapore compare  with,\r\n\r\nsay  Great  Britain, in regard to national  wealth?\r\n\r\nHow  does  our  per capita national income  compare\r\n\r\nwith  that  of  the  British  per  capita  national\r\n\r\nincome? Sir, I can assure you that we certainly  do\r\n\r\nnot  come anywhere near 90 per cent of the  British\r\n\r\nlevel.  Then,  on  those general considerations,  I\r\n\r\nwould  say  that  the statement by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson that our civil service is underpaid cannot be\r\n\r\nsustained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as to the present situation in the market for\r\n\r\nthe  services of civil servants, it is, of  course,\r\n\r\nhighly  abnormal. Malayanisation has been going  on\r\n\r\nfor  some  years.  There has been an  abnormal  and\r\n\r\nlarge demand for administrators, technicians and so\r\n\r\nforth to man the civil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice posts that were once occupied by expatriate\r\n\r\nofficers.  But  this  is only  a  temporary  phase.\r\n\r\nEventually,  these  posts will be  filled  and  the\r\n\r\ndemand  for civil servants will find its own level.\r\n\r\nIt  is  only when we reach that stage that  we  can\r\n\r\nreally  come to a proper assessment whether or  not\r\n\r\nwe   are  overpaying  or  under-paying  our   civil\r\n\r\nservants.  Therefore, until we  reach  that  point,\r\n\r\nthere  is no question of consolidating the variable\r\n\r\nallowances  now being paid to civil  servants  into\r\n\r\nthe basic salary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson has seen fit, in the\r\n\r\ncourse of his remarks, to discourse on the P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nattitude  towards  the  English-educated.  He   has\r\n\r\nclaimed  that  we  have lost  the  support  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese-speaking  industrial  group  and  that  our\r\n\r\nsurvival  depends  on getting the  support  of  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated. Sir, it is obvious that the ideas\r\n\r\nof  the  Member for Anson on matters  of  political\r\n\r\nstrategy are exceedingly innocent, because that  is\r\n\r\nnot  the way you calculate things; that is not  the\r\n\r\nway  in  which you decide your policy. The English-educated,   in   terms  of  voting  strength,   are\r\n\r\nunimportant. They may amount perhaps to some 15 per\r\n\r\ncent of the total electorate. Their contribution is\r\n\r\nnot  the  manner  in which they  cast  their  votes\r\n\r\neither for one Party or one programme or the other.\r\n\r\nThat is not the decisive function they fulfil. They\r\n\r\nhave  a role to play. This we had stated right from\r\n\r\nthe  beginning before we formed the Government, not\r\n\r\nmerely  after  we  formed  the  Government.  It  is\r\n\r\ncertainly not after the defection of members of our\r\n\r\nParty  to  pro-Communist groups. We have said  that\r\n\r\nthe English-educated are, in a sense - and only in  a\r\n\r\nsense - the prototype of the future Malayan,  because\r\n\r\nhe  has  transcended the communal barriers, whether\r\n\r\nhe  be a Malay, an Indian, a Chinese or a Eurasian.\r\n\r\nHe  has a feeling of group identity that transcends\r\n\r\ncommunal  barriers.  He has also  absorbed  certain\r\n\r\nvalues of personal liberties which are essential in\r\n\r\nthe running of the democratic system. But where  he\r\n\r\nhas  failed is that, in the course of events  under\r\n\r\ncolonial  rule,  he  has  occupied  a  position  of\r\n\r\nprivilege  as  regards job, income  and  career  as\r\n\r\nagainst other groups. To that extent, he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas isolated himself from the other sections of the\r\n\r\ncommunity.  We,  of the P.A.P.,  have  always  been\r\n\r\nsaying that the role of the English-educated is  to\r\n\r\nget  out  of  the  state of isolation  and  provide\r\n\r\nleadership,  ideas and organising  ability  in  the\r\n\r\nmovement  to  create a new Malaya. To say  that  we\r\n\r\nhave reduced the variable allowance as a measure of\r\n\r\nretribution  against  the English-educated  because\r\n\r\nthey  did  not vote for us in the general elections\r\n\r\nis,  I think, something that is too foolish to need\r\n\r\njustification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, it is pitiful to see the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance humming and hawing,  shilly-shallying, trying to defend himself -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Now,  when they realise  that  they  have\r\n\r\nreally   lost  the  support  of  all  the  Chinese-educated, they are hoping to catch some votes  from\r\n\r\nthe  English-educated. They go along to  hand  back\r\n\r\nthe  pay  cuts. Everybody knows that this so-called\r\n\r\nprospect of the so-called merger has nothing to  do\r\n\r\nwith  what is happening. Why must they bring merger\r\n\r\nin?  Do  you think the people can be easily fooled,\r\n\r\nthat  they  will support that type of  merger  just\r\n\r\nbecause  they get back a little bit of the pay-cut?\r\n\r\nThey  must  go  back  to  school  again  and  study\r\n\r\npsychology.

The reason was that last year's\r\n\r\nrainfall  was the lowest for 80 years  of  recorded\r\n\r\nmeteorological  reports.  It  was  61   inches   as\r\n\r\ncompared with the yearly average of 90 inches. As a\r\n\r\nresult,   our  impounding  reservoirs  which   were\r\n\r\nnormally  filled  up  during the  rainy  season  of\r\n\r\nNovember,  December  and  January  were  left  half\r\n\r\nempty.  However, the water levels  in  Johore  were\r\n\r\nthen  reasonably  good and no  rationing  was  then\r\n\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the drought continued throughout May, June,\r\n\r\nJuly  and August, not only did the water levels  of\r\n\r\nour   impounding  reservoirs  in  Singapore  become\r\n\r\nperilously low, but the water levels in Johore also\r\n\r\nwent  down. Out of a daily consumption of  some  69\r\n\r\nmillion  gallons of water, 59 million gallons  come\r\n\r\nfrom  Johore. Because of the drought in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe   whole   69  million  gallons  of  our   daily\r\n\r\nconsumption  of water had to come from Johore.  But\r\n\r\nwhen the drought hit not only Singapore but was, in\r\n\r\nfact,  worse in South Johore and water levels  went\r\n\r\ndown, rationing had to be introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the end of October this year, rainfall in\r\n\r\nSingapore was only 51.44 inches as against a yearly\r\n\r\naverage over the last 80 years of 76.31 inches  for\r\n\r\nthe same ten months, January to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am informed by the Meteorological Office that\r\n\r\nthe  drought hit many parts of the Federation,  and\r\n\r\nmany  towns  there  also had water  rationing.

So I would rather not get involved in the\r\n\r\nintricacies  of the argument on both sides.  All  I\r\n\r\ncan say is that we have been extremely fortunate in\r\n\r\nthat, despite pressure from certain members of  the\r\n\r\nJohore  State Assembly to buck the price up, taking\r\n\r\nadvantage of the drought and the negotiations going\r\n\r\non   in  the  course  of  the  drought,  the  State\r\n\r\nSecretary  and the Mentri Besar have  resisted  the\r\n\r\ntemptation to do so. They have only insisted on the\r\n\r\n1955  agreement. I think the Member for Farrer Park\r\n\r\nwill   remember  this  because  he  was   in   the\r\n\r\nMunicipality then in 1955 when these new rates were\r\n\r\nagreed.  The  old rates were 25 cents  per  gallon.\r\n\r\nThere  were no royalties. Singapore supplied Johore\r\n\r\nat  25  cents, and they sold to their consumers  at\r\n\r\nwhatever profit they could make, and everybody  was\r\n\r\nhappy. Then the cost of treating the water went up,\r\n\r\nbecause  instead of collecting water in  convenient\r\n\r\ncatchment areas like Kota Tinggi and Gunong  Pulai,\r\n\r\nwe  had to tap Tebrau, and now Scudai, and later on\r\n\r\nthe  Johore River. It has gone up to 50  cents.  In\r\n\r\n1955,  the  Municipality came to an agreement - well,\r\n\r\nthe  Johore  Government insisted  that  it  was  an\r\n\r\nagreement;  our contention is that it  was  only  a\r\n\r\npreliminary  agreement - that  the  cost   of   water\r\n\r\nsupplied  to Johore should be brought up  to  date,\r\n\r\nnamely, 50 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

To ask the Prime Minister (a) what is the estimated payment to be made\r\n\r\nby the Johore Government to Singapore for water supplied by Singapore for the year\r\n\r\n1962 at the new rates; and the estimated cost thereof to Singapore; and (b) the\r\n\r\nreasons for increasing the rate from 25 cents to 50 cents per thousand gallons of filtered water.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, that was at the back of\r\n\r\nmy mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister may answer\r\n\r\nquestions 14 and 15 at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, 14 and 15 at the same\r\n\r\ntime. And so they came to what our officials think\r\n\r\nis  a  dubious  proposition,  because  one  cannot\r\n\r\ncalculate  development,  particularly   with   the\r\n\r\ntremendous industrial development in Singapore, or\r\n\r\nthe  expansion in consumption. They  came  to  the\r\n\r\nagreement that we were to pay 3 cents royalty  per\r\n\r\nthousand  gallons  and  we  charged  the  cost  of\r\n\r\ntreatment  at  50  cents  per  thousand   gallons.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, or rather fortunately, depending on\r\n\r\nwhich  way  one  pitches one's hopes,  the  Johore\r\n\r\nGovernment  did not yield to pressure  from  their\r\n\r\nState  Assemblymen to scrap the agreement and  ask\r\n\r\nfor  something  more. We could  not  persuade  the\r\n\r\nJohore  Government to scrap the agreement  and  go\r\n\r\nback  to the old one where we supplied them at  25\r\n\r\ncents,  even  though  we were supplying  it  below\r\n\r\ncost.  But then we tap the rivers for what we  can\r\n\r\nmake up for that. However, the best that could  be\r\n\r\ndone is to stick to the agreement in 1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total payment - this is the answer to question\r\n\r\nNo. 14 - to the Johore Government for water supplied\r\n\r\nfrom  the Tebrau water works from 1st March, 1955,\r\n\r\nto  30th  September, 1961, is  $1.8  million.  The\r\n\r\nestimated  payment  to  be  made  to  the   Johore\r\n\r\nGovernment for the supply of water to Singapore in\r\n\r\n1962 is $.57 million. Sir, I am not aware of any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on the part of the Johore  Government\r\n\r\nfor  providing this supply which we undertake  and\r\n\r\nextract on our own, other than helping with a  few\r\n\r\npolice  escorts during the time of the  strike  to\r\n\r\nmaintain   the   water  works.   The   collection,\r\n\r\nfiltration, pipelines and storage are all  at  our\r\n\r\nexpense. In fact, we also supply Johore Bahru with\r\n\r\ntheir  requirements for water at cost. But I would\r\n\r\nlike to add that the Johore Government leases  the\r\n\r\ncatchment  area to the Singapore Government  at  a\r\n\r\npurely nominal rent. So we have to be thankful for\r\n\r\nour blessings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to question No. 15+, the estimated payment to\r\n\r\nbe  made by the Johore Government to the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment for water supplied by Singapore in 1962\r\n\r\nis  $.625 million, of which the estimated cost  to\r\n\r\nSingapore is $.562 million. As I said, the  reason\r\n\r\nfor  increasing the rate of 25 cents to  50  cents\r\n\r\nper thousand gallons of filtered water is that the\r\n\r\ncost  of supplying the water, of treating it,  has\r\n\r\nincreased for the Singapore Government. The charge\r\n\r\nof 25 cents per thousand gallons was below cost in\r\n\r\nthe  last few years, although it was the cost when\r\n\r\nit   was  fixed  many  years  ago.  The  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment would have preferred to retain the  old\r\n\r\ncost  at  25  cents  in the old  agreement,  which\r\n\r\nexpired  in 1948, and waive the extra cost  of  25\r\n\r\ncents  per thousand gallons, provided we  did  not\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay  3  cents per thousand  gallons  for\r\n\r\nextraction.  However, as I said, the best  bargain\r\n\r\nthat  was  made in the circumstances was that  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council and the Johore Government agreed  to\r\n\r\nimplement  the  new  rates  which  we  say  was  a\r\n\r\npreliminary agreement, but which they  say  was  a\r\n\r\nfinal  agreement  in 1955 - at the  time  when  the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park was in the City Council.

I can only say, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat I trust that they have done their calculations\r\n\r\ncorrectly. I am sure they have done it to the  best\r\n\r\nof  their  ability.

But\r\n\r\nif - and this is really the point - the Jurong project\r\n\r\ngets  under way and industrial consumption goes  up\r\n\r\ntremendously and unexpected demands are made,  then\r\n\r\nit  may well be that we will have to ask the Johore\r\n\r\nGovernment  not to insist on buying  out  our  Kota\r\n\r\nTinggi  and Gunong Pulai reservoirs.

The idea is that although\r\n\r\nCanadians, Australians and South Africans  did  not\r\n\r\nwant Indians, Pakistanis, Ceylonese and Malayans to\r\n\r\nmove  in  and  out  of  their country  freely,  the\r\n\r\nBritish  wanted  to maintain this  concept  of  the\r\n\r\nunity of one family of different coloured children,\r\n\r\nand so they coined this concept of the Commonwealth\r\n\r\ncitizen.

These\r\n\r\natrocities  which the Member for Anson  has  kindly\r\n\r\nreferred to as \"reputed action\" had been proved  by\r\n\r\nmany independent observers and documents. I am sure\r\n\r\nthe  House will want the Government to do  whatever\r\n\r\nwe  can to help the people of Angola in their fight\r\n\r\nfor   freedom  against  these  brutal  methods   of\r\n\r\nsuppression.  However,  I  am  informed  that   the\r\n\r\nseverance of trade relations between Singapore  and\r\n\r\nPortugal  would be of no assistance  whatsoever  to\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Angola. Our imports and exports  to\r\n\r\nPortugal  and  her  dependencies  is  a  negligible\r\n\r\nproportion of our entrepot trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the case that I recall as having been\r\n\r\ndiscussed  by  the  Government  is  that  of  South\r\n\r\nAfrica. Although we as a Government wanted  to  ban\r\n\r\nimports,  we  could  not ban consumption  of  South\r\n\r\nAfrican  goods  without at the same time  affecting\r\n\r\nour  free  port  status  and  also  preventing  the\r\n\r\ntranshipment  in Singapore for other  countries  of\r\n\r\ngoods from South Africa. Similarly, in the case  of\r\n\r\nPortugal. If we sever trade relations and  ban  the\r\n\r\nimports  with  the purpose of banning  consumption,\r\n\r\nthen  because  we  have  no  impounded  warehousing\r\n\r\nsystem  we will automatically also have to ban  all\r\n\r\nimports  even for transhipment elsewhere. For  that\r\n\r\nreason,  I  am  informed that very little  will  be\r\n\r\ngained by severing trade relations and sonic damage\r\n\r\nmay he done to our free port status.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I accept the\r\n\r\nvalidity  of  the indications given  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister for the reason of not disrupting our trade\r\n\r\nrelations  with Portugal, but if we are not  to  do\r\n\r\nthat  in  order to show our disapprobation  of  the\r\n\r\ninhuman  blood  bath  in Angola, would  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  indicate what other action it is possible\r\n\r\nfor the Government to take and what action he would\r\n\r\nconsider taking?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am told the normal\r\n\r\ndiscourtesy  in these matters, when  one  does  not\r\n\r\nwant to cut one's own nose to spite oneself, is  to\r\n\r\nisolate  coldly,  or  put  into  cold  storage  the\r\n\r\nrepresentative   of   the   country    representing\r\n\r\nPortugal.

It was\r\n\r\nan  excellent,  a carefully prepared document - if  I\r\n\r\nwho  am  a novice on these matters may be permitted\r\n\r\nto   express  an  opinion.  It  referred   to   the\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"poor\" (at page 113) as meaning those\r\n\r\npersons  who  live in conditions below the  minimum\r\n\r\nphysical needs to maintain health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Report arrived at the conclusion that in\r\n\r\nthe  period  1953-54,  the  minimum  income  for  a\r\n\r\nhusband,  his  wife and two children  was  $101.85.\r\n\r\nThis  was eight years ago. The cost of living,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will  admit, has not gone  down.  It  has\r\n\r\nrisen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, another statistic from this Report is\r\n\r\nthat  about  30  per cent of our  population  lived\r\n\r\nbelow  that  minimum standard and are poor.  Thirty\r\n\r\nper cent lived in poverty in 1953-54. I do not know\r\n\r\nhow   much  the  position  has  improved   in   the\r\n\r\nintervening  years. I should like to believe,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat they have improved in spite of our increase of\r\n\r\npopulation. But it is not on this very large  group\r\n\r\nthat  I  ask the House to concentrate its attention\r\n\r\ntonight.  I  would like hon. Members to concentrate\r\n\r\non a small portion of this group living in poverty.\r\n\r\nI  would like the House to concentrate on those who\r\n\r\nmay be officially presumed to be starving - those who\r\n\r\ndraw public assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have sought from the Ministry of Labour\r\n\r\ninformation, much of which was courteously granted,\r\n\r\nbut when I asked for figures which I could not find\r\n\r\nof  those who were drawing public assistance, I was\r\n\r\ncourteously but firmly refused that information. It\r\n\r\nis  my  hope that this top-secret information which\r\n\r\nthe Minister is so unhappy to disclose to a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember  of  the  House, will be  disclosed  to  all\r\n\r\nMembers  of the House and we shall have the figures\r\n\r\nfor 1956, 1960 and for the end of October 1961, of\r\n\r\nthe  number  of human beings in Singapore  who  are\r\n\r\nliving  well below subsistence level. I might  say.\r\n\r\nSir, that the Minister for Finance in his Report on\r\n\r\nUrban  Incomes and Housing said that  one-fifth  of\r\n\r\nthe  households  of the poor was living  on  public\r\n\r\nassistance, but that was a long time ago and it  is\r\n\r\nnot   proper  that  this  House  should   work   on\r\n\r\nstatistics so old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is public assistance, Sir? It came into\r\n\r\nbeing - so  far as I can trace it -  immediately  after\r\n\r\nthe  occupation period when a large number  of  our\r\n\r\npeople  were  in dire economic need  and  temporary\r\n\r\nrelief  measures  were instituted  and  were  later\r\n\r\nadministered  by  the newly-formed  Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment which was formed in 1946. At that  time,\r\n\r\nSir,  grants  were given of $5 per man,  $4  for  a\r\n\r\nwoman,  and $2 for children per month. The neediest\r\n\r\nrecipients,  however,  could  get  free  meals  and\r\n\r\nadditional assistance. Five years later,  in  1951.\r\n\r\nthe  public  assistance scheme was established  and\r\n\r\nthe rates to those who were fully eligible were $15\r\n\r\nfor the head of a household, $5 for each dependant,\r\n\r\nwith  a  maximum  of $40 for each family.  That  is\r\n\r\nextremely  low,  Sir,  but  let  us,  in  fairness,\r\n\r\nrecognise that at the same time there was an  equal\r\n\r\namount  given to those who were sick, so  that  the\r\n\r\nperson  receiving public assistance if he was  sick\r\n\r\ngot  a double allotment. Even then it was generally\r\n\r\nrecognised  that  the double allowance  itself  was\r\n\r\nwell  below  subsistence  level, particularly   in\r\n\r\nrespect of families with young children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in June 1953, there was a further change and\r\n\r\nall  degrees  of  eligibility  were  abolished.   A\r\n\r\nresidential   qualification   of   one   year   was\r\n\r\nintroduced.  The scales then established  were  $15\r\n\r\nfor  the head of a household, $5 for the wife,  and\r\n\r\n$5 for the child, with a maximum of $90. You had to\r\n\r\nhave  a huge family of some 12 children to get  it.\r\n\r\nSickness  allowance was also paid at the same  rate\r\n\r\nas  public  assistance, and it is to be  recognised\r\n\r\nthat this was very important to those who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  sick. Also the wife herself, if she was sick,\r\n\r\ndid  not merely get a sickness allowance of $5  but\r\n\r\nshe was given $15.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what was the cost of this scheme which in its\r\n\r\nway  indicated  our  awakening conscience  and  our\r\n\r\nawakening  humanity? In 1958, Sir, the scheme  cost\r\n\r\n$7  million. In 1959, it cost 7\ufffd million. Late  in\r\n\r\n1959 - the  year  this Government took  office - public\r\n\r\nassistance rates were altered by the Government. At\r\n\r\nfirst  it  was  not recognised to what  extent  the\r\n\r\nalteration was adverse to the most defenceless  and\r\n\r\nmost  needy  of the human beings who populate  this\r\n\r\nisland,  for the P.A.P., with its unerring instinct\r\n\r\nfor  the  propaganda point, increased the allowance\r\n\r\nto the head of the household by $1 and made it $16.\r\n\r\nIt  increased the allowance to the wife to  $10 - all\r\n\r\nto  the  good,  Sir, every little  bit;  I  am  not\r\n\r\ncomplaining - and the child over 16 to $8.  That  is\r\n\r\ngood,  Sir.  Wherein  lies the complaint?  Sickness\r\n\r\nallowance which quite materially affected  a  large\r\n\r\nportion    of    the   people   receiving    public\r\n\r\nassistance - sometimes  as   much   as   half   their\r\n\r\nincome - was  abolished  altogether,  bringing  about\r\n\r\nacute hardship to a group already recognisably  and\r\n\r\nofficially  unable  to work and  requiring  special\r\n\r\nnourishment because of their illness, let alone the\r\n\r\nminimum necessary for maintaining human health.  In\r\n\r\naddition.  Sir,  non-citizens, no matter  how  long\r\n\r\nthey lived in this country, were refused all public\r\n\r\nassistance. However, in fairness, let me  add  that\r\n\r\nto  the head of the family, only if he was so sick\r\n\r\nthat  he  could  not work - and it was  a  grave  and\r\n\r\nlengthy  matter - he was given a disability allowance\r\n\r\nof $10 per month. Other cuts were made. Persons who\r\n\r\nare  not  married cannot receive public assistance,\r\n\r\nno  matter how long they are unemployed, no  matter\r\n\r\nhow sick they are. Sir, let me correct that. If the\r\n\r\nunemployed  single person has been  sick  for  more\r\n\r\nthan  a month, then during his sickness he can  get\r\n\r\nhis  public  assistance. Non-citizens  of  whatever\r\n\r\nlength of residence are completely ineligible,  and\r\n\r\nthose  living in households where there is  regular\r\n\r\nincome  are  barred. You might  say  that  that  is\r\n\r\nreasonable. I put it to you. Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou are conscious that not only amongst the Chinese\r\n\r\nbut  in all races there is a strong attachment  and\r\n\r\nfixed  family  ties;  and you can  appreciate  that\r\n\r\nthese things do happen - that a brother takes in  his\r\n\r\nwidowed sister with six children, but because he is\r\n\r\na  clerk who earns $150 a month, the widow and  the\r\n\r\nchildren get nothing. There is a regular income  in\r\n\r\nthat household.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other matter, Sir. Tuberculosis allowance was\r\n\r\ndiscontinued  in  respect of  those  who  are  non-citizens,  whatever their length of residence.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, at first view, this might seem a very\r\n\r\nreasonable  political move. We  must  conserve  our\r\n\r\nresources for our citizens. But what the Government\r\n\r\nhas  failed  to recognise is that the  tuberculosis\r\n\r\nallowance  which  is  above subsistence  level  and\r\n\r\nassists  tuberculosis  patients  to  improve  their\r\n\r\nhealth  prevents  them from becoming  a  continuing\r\n\r\nfocus   of   infection.   Non-citizens   who   have\r\n\r\ntuberculosis do not limit their infection  to  non-citizens, and the economy which the Government  has\r\n\r\nsought  to  make  is  a false economy  because,  by\r\n\r\nleaving the unemployed tuberculosis patient who  is\r\n\r\na  non-citizen without any resources to improve his\r\n\r\nhealth,  the Government encourages and assists  the\r\n\r\nadditional  spread  of  tuberculosis  amongst   our\r\n\r\npeople, because these people continue to be a focus\r\n\r\nof infection to our healthy citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these cuts, Mr Speaker, Sir, were presumably\r\n\r\nenforced  in  the  name  of economy,  but  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest that the result has not apparently been  no\r\n\r\nticed.  It has not been recognised, Sir, that  such\r\n\r\naction  increases the hardship of a major group  in\r\n\r\nSingapore - those who are unable to work  because  of\r\n\r\nillness and where the very existence of poverty has\r\n\r\nled them to be vulnerable to illness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I will not go back to the Report of the gentleman who is now our Finance Minister, but I will give you one other statistic which I am sure\r\n\r\nhe  will  accept  as valid and  which  he  will  be\r\n\r\nprepared to respect. I am\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreliably  informed,  Sir, that  the  Department  of\r\n\r\nSocial  Medicine  of the University  has  carefully\r\n\r\ninvestigated and finally ascertained that  the  sum\r\n\r\nof  $22  per  month  is required for  the  cheapest\r\n\r\nreasonable diet to maintain the minimum standard of\r\n\r\nhealth  on  the  basis of scientific  marketing - and\r\n\r\nthis  $22  per  month does not  take  into  account\r\n\r\nclothing, rent and other basic human needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means, Sir, that those who are recipients of\r\n\r\npublic  assistance in their thousands and  tens  of\r\n\r\nthousands are today living, in truth and  in  fact,\r\n\r\nat  a  level where their health is actually rapidly\r\n\r\ndeteriorating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every government with an eye to the long-term\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  the  people must  recognise  that  the\r\n\r\neffect   of  this  extreme  malnutrition   over   a\r\n\r\nprolonged  period  will have  a  very  considerable\r\n\r\nbearing  on the public economy. I speak of economy,\r\n\r\nSir, because that seems to be the important aspect.\r\n\r\napart,  it seems, from other aspects which have  or\r\n\r\nseem  to  have a little validity to hon, gentlemen\r\n\r\nopposite, such as human values and humanity. If  it\r\n\r\nis   economics   that  the  P.A.P.  Government   is\r\n\r\ninterested, Sir, then I say it is false economy  to\r\n\r\nsave money from the sick and the starving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has been the effect, Sir, of these measures\r\n\r\nintroduced by Government of economy in the realm of\r\n\r\npublic assistance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has been good enough to supply me\r\n\r\nwith figures, and, as I have indicated, in 1959  we\r\n\r\nspent  $7,746,000; in 1960 we saved $350,000.  That\r\n\r\nwas  the economy in 1960. In 1961, on the basis  of\r\n\r\nthe  figures supplied up to the end of August,  the\r\n\r\ntotal   we  will  spend  for  the  whole  year   is\r\n\r\n$6,400,000.  In 1961, Sir, we will  have  saved  $1\r\n\r\nmillion  from the poor and the starving as compared\r\n\r\nwith  1960. Is this the type of economy  that  this\r\n\r\nHouse, being  made conscious of it,  would  really\r\n\r\napprove?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even if these human beings who are our\r\n\r\ncitizens  are  to  be deemed expendable  and  their\r\n\r\ndeath  is  to be welcomed as saving the State  some\r\n\r\nmoney, from  the point of view of  the  community,\r\n\r\nthis  is  an  unrealistic and uneconomic  approach.\r\n\r\nStarvation  and  poverty of  the  nature  indicated\r\n\r\ntakes its toll on the whole community, not only  on\r\n\r\nthe  women and children who immediately suffer, but\r\n\r\non  all citizens, through increases in the rate  of\r\n\r\ncrime,  the rate of illness, and the very degrading\r\n\r\natmosphere in which such matters can happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children, Sir, who have to suffer malnutrition\r\n\r\nduring  their  tender and formative years,  because\r\n\r\ntheir  parents  have  only $5  to  spend  on  their\r\n\r\nfood - one-fourth  of  the  basic  minimum   required\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- cannot be expected to grow up healthy, employable,\r\n\r\nbalanced  or  good citizens. They must  necessarily\r\n\r\ngrow up distorted, sick burdens on the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this is not and should not be a political or party matter. No citizen can be comfortable so long as there are those who starve.\r\n\r\nSir,  it  is  a  question of money. Money  must  he\r\n\r\nfound.  Let us resolve: \"In Singapore no man  shall\r\n\r\nstarve.\"  And  then  let us set about  finding  the\r\n\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one more. In 1957 there was tabled in this\r\n\r\nHouse  the  Report  of  the  Committee  on  Minimum\r\n\r\nStandards of Livelihood. I refer to two paragraphs,\r\n\r\nparagraph 203 and 204.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`203. We think that the Public Assistance scheme\r\n\r\nshould be put on a formal statutory basis and  that\r\n\r\nthe  rates  of  allowances and categories  of  need\r\n\r\ncovered by it should be approved by the legislature\r\n\r\nand   should  be  subject  to  amendment   by   the\r\n\r\nlegislature  from  time to  time  as  occasion  may\r\n\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;204. We think that the existing rates of allowance\r\n\r\nshould be increased ...'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  will be through, Sir. These recommendations have\r\n\r\nbeen ignored - the Report shelved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other aspects, Sir, I would like to deal\r\n\r\nwith very briefly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The delay in investigation of cases seeking public\r\n\r\nassistance has increased under this Government.  It\r\n\r\nis said that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  time is required in order to exclude  fraud.\r\n\r\nBut,  Sir,  a  delay of three  to  four  weeks  is\r\n\r\nindefensible in emergency cases where human beings\r\n\r\nare starving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member has exceeded\r\n\r\nhis time of twenty minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the subject\r\n\r\nof  poverty and human suffering is a touching one,\r\n\r\nand  the Member for Anson has excelled himself  in\r\n\r\ndealing with such a subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say at once, Sir, that surely every\r\n\r\nreasonable man will agree that poverty  is  a  bad\r\n\r\nthing   and  should  be  eliminated  if  that   is\r\n\r\npossible?  But,  Sir, while it  is  legitimate  to\r\n\r\nexpress  discontent  over  the  rates  of   public\r\n\r\nassistance  that are being paid to Singapore,  let\r\n\r\nus  not forget that this is one of the highest  in\r\n\r\nAsia, in fact the highest known to me. Let us  not\r\n\r\nforget  that  the  income earned  by  the  average\r\n\r\nfamily in receipt of public assistance is about as\r\n\r\nmuch  as  what most families in other  undeveloped\r\n\r\ncountries of Asia earn in their full-time jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of poverty is not peculiar to us.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  general  problem of all under-developed\r\n\r\ncountries  of  the  world.  Public  assistance  is\r\n\r\nfeasible  in  a  city trading economy  like  ours;\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is compact and because  we  have  the\r\n\r\nadministrative machinery to give our assistance to\r\n\r\nthose   who   are   needy.  But  they   are   only\r\n\r\npalliatives;  we  can only reduce  the  degree  of\r\n\r\ndestitution. But if we aim at eliminating  poverty\r\n\r\ncompletely,   as   the  wealthier   industrialised\r\n\r\ncountries in the west have substantially succeeded\r\n\r\nin  doing,  then it is absolutely  vital  that  we\r\n\r\nexpand  our economy, increase our national  income\r\n\r\nin  order that we can afford to cream off  surplus\r\n\r\nresources for our less fortunate brethren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would just like to mention this before\r\n\r\nconcluding. That the decision to review the  rates\r\n\r\nof  public assistance was to make the whole scheme\r\n\r\nmore  rational.  It has been discovered  that  for\r\n\r\nmany  years the payment of sickness allowance  was\r\n\r\nsubject  to  grave  abuse. There  were  no  proper\r\n\r\nchecks that those in receipt of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch an allowance were, in fact, properly entitled\r\n\r\nto  them. There were no regular medical check-ups;\r\n\r\nand  in  the  nature  of things,  because  of  the\r\n\r\nshortage of medical personnel, it was not possible\r\n\r\nto   have  the  number  of  examinations   to   be\r\n\r\nconducted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have increased payment rates in other\r\n\r\nrespects to compensate for the withdrawal of  this\r\n\r\nallowance.  Next  year  we shall  make  a  further\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the rates of public assistance.  The\r\n\r\nproper way, of course, to deal with the problem is\r\n\r\nto  have a contributory insurance scheme to  cover\r\n\r\nthe  barest  risks  to life which  overtake  urban\r\n\r\nworkers - the  risk  of unemployment,  the  risk  of\r\n\r\ndeath  of the wage earner, provision for a  steady\r\n\r\nincome  after retirement. A lot of work  has  been\r\n\r\ndone  in  the  past years, but there  are  certain\r\n\r\ndifficulties in carrying out this insurance scheme\r\n\r\nwhich I think this House can very well discuss  at\r\n\r\nthe appropriate time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim):</b>\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, in fairness to my colleague, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance, since the Member for  Anson\r\n\r\nhas  made reference to the time when he was in the\r\n\r\ncivil  service, I thought it only proper  to  give\r\n\r\nhim a few minutes to reply. I think he has more or\r\n\r\nless covered some of the proposals and suggestions\r\n\r\nmade by the Member for Anson, but I would like  to\r\n\r\ntouch on the figures which the Member claimed that\r\n\r\nhe  was  courteously but firmly refused by perhaps\r\n\r\nan  official  of  my Ministry.  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\ndisclose these figures to him now, indeed  to  all\r\n\r\nMembers of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 1958, the number of persons of\r\n\r\npublic assistance per month is\r\n\r\n72,604; 1959, 81,840; 1960, 89,548; for the months\r\n\r\nof  August  1961, 89,244; September 1961,  89,060;\r\n\r\nOctober 1961, 89,432. From these, you can see. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   that  the  average  amount  of   public\r\n\r\nassistance   disbursed  per  month   ranged   from\r\n\r\n$576,867 to now $602,583.60.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point raised about non-citizens,\r\n\r\nwhich  I  am  sure hon. Members of this House  will\r\n\r\nrecall  during the by election in Anson, the  same\r\n\r\nquestion, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink, was raised by the Member for Anson. But  he\r\n\r\nmust  at  the same time understand the  conditions\r\n\r\nprevailing in our State on the question of  public\r\n\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say here, Mr Speaker, that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  spending nearly $7\ufffd  million  a\r\n\r\nyear,  on public assistance, and this figure would\r\n\r\nhave   increased  had  it  not   been   for   this\r\n\r\nqualification  of non-citizens.  To  grant  public\r\n\r\nassistance to non-citizens would encourage  people\r\n\r\nfrom  surrounding  countries which  have  no  such\r\n\r\nscheme  or have a less favourable scheme  to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage of the allowance payable here. This is a\r\n\r\nsubstitute for residential qualification, and most\r\n\r\ncountries  in the world have either a  citizenship\r\n\r\nor   a   residential  qualification  for  a   non-contributory  scheme  such  as  that   of   public\r\n\r\nassistance. In the case of a social or a  national\r\n\r\ninsurance   scheme,  no  such   qualification   is\r\n\r\nnecessary,  as  the  beneficiary  has  contributed\r\n\r\ntowards   the   scheme   and,   subject   to   the\r\n\r\nsatisfaction  of  the contributory qualifications,\r\n\r\nhe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas an absolute right to the payment of benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that the rates which we are paying\r\n\r\nnow  are the highest payable in respect of  relief\r\n\r\nallowance  in  this  part  of  the  world.
