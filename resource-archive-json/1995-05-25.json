The objectives of the study were, firstly, to measure the effectiveness of abacus training on mental calculation and understanding of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1108</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> place value concepts and, secondly, to assess some affective outcomes related to mathematics such as pupil interest, confidence and perception of ability. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Results of the pilot study showed that pupils who went through abacus instruction showed improvement in their mental calculations. There were clear indications that pupils in the experimental schools had a more positive attitude towards mathematics. They maintained their interest and exhibited greater confidence in the subject. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The findings of the pilot study are positive as interest and confidence are important attributes for educational achievement. MOE has thus decided to implement abacus instruction at Primary 3 starting with 15 schools this year. The instructional time for abacus teaching will be 11 hours, or 5% of the total Primary 3 mathematics curriculum time of 220 hours. The programme starts in Term II and continues to Term III. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE will accelerate the implementation next year and in 2-3 years, all schools will conduct abacus lessons for their Primary 3 pupils. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE is also currently conducting another pilot study at Primary 2 level to ascertain the feasibility of implementing abacus instruction at an earlier level. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1108</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>REMOVAL OF STUDENTS FROM SCHOOL</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Guidelines)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen</b> asked the Minister for Education (a) when a school principal wishes to remove a student from his school, whether he has to seek the approval of his Ministry and give prior written notice to the parents concerned; and (b) under what circumstances a school principal may remove a student from his school and whether his Ministry has a set of guidelines pertaining to this. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a school principal does not need to seek the approval of the Ministry of Education before removing a student from the school. However, he has to inform the Ministry of his action. He is not required \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1109</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to give prior written notice to the parents concerned. Nevertheless, in all cases involving recalcitrant and severe indiscipline necessitating removal from the school, the principal and teachers would have informed the parents and sought to work with them to help the student change his ways before the school is forced to take the ultimate step of expulsion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A student is expelled from school only if he commits a very serious offence such as assault and if allowing him to remain in school would threaten the safety of staff and other pupils and severely undermine the good order in the school. Each case is unique with its own contributing and mitigating factors. The principal and his staff are in the best position to judge when a student should be removed from the school for severe indiscipline. If they are in doubt they will consult the Ministry. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1109</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CONFESSIONS MADE BY ACCUSED PERSONS TO POLICE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Rejections by courts)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. \n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs if he will inform the House on how many occasions in 1993, 1994 and 1995 (up to the latest convenient date) courts in Singapore have rejected confessions made by accused persons to the police. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from 1993 to April 1995, 166 criminal cases investigated by the police were tried in the High Court. From available police records, confession evidence was ruled inadmissible in four cases. In three of these cases, the accused persons were acquitted. In the fourth case, the accused person was convicted on the basis of other evidence. As for Subordinate Court cases, 39,804 and 41,203 criminal cases were disposed of by the Subordinate Courts in 1993 and 1994 respectively. The number of cases where statements from accused were ruled inadmissible is not readily available. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1110</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the trend in the cases tried in the High Court illustrates that the number of confessions ruled inadmissible by the courts is small. Nevertheless, the fact that the courts do reject confession evidence shows that it is an important check against inadmissible evidence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me assure this House that there are sufficient legal safeguards to firmly check any abuse in the police investigation. The law ensures that only properly obtained confession evidence is admitted as evidence of guilt. Under the Criminal Procedure Code and the Evidence Act, a confession which appears to have been obtained through any form of threat, inducement or promise is not admissible as evidence in court. The law places on the prosecution the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the confession was made voluntarily. This is a heavy burden of proof. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, police carefully monitor all cases where confession evidence is ruled inadmissible. They will not hesitate to deal firmly with any officer who has run foul of proper practices and procedures or has resorted to assaults to obtain such evidence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having addressed the immediate concerns raised by Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon, let me caution that it is common for the defence to raise doubts on the credibility of the prosecution's case by casting aspersion on the manner in which such inculpatory evidence was obtained. Besides ruling inadmissible confession evidence which appears to have been obtained through any inducement, threat or promise made to the accused person, statements containing confession evidence will be ruled inadmissible if, for example, the court is satisfied that the requisite warning for caution which precedes the statement by an accused person has been inadequately explained or interpreted to him or if there were some other kind of irregularity in the recording of the confession or substantial non-compliance with any statutory requirements which will make it unsafe to admit it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, confession evidence can be rejected by the court for a variety of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1111</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> reasons. We cannot presume that every rejected confession implies an intentional abuse or malpractice by the investigator. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1111</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>WATER RESOURCES IN SINGAPORE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Enhancement)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. \n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what measures the Government has taken since 1990 in identifying and planning the enhancement of water resources in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, I had explained to the House during the Committee of Supply debate in March this year the various efforts to develop new and alternative sources of water to meet our future needs. Perhaps the Member for Hougang was absent at that session. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I had pointed out to Members, if our water consumption continues to increase at 6% per annum, we will run short of water in six years' time, ie, in the year 2001. However, even if we succeed in halving the increase in water consumption to 3% per annum, we will only be able to delay this to the year 2011 when our 1961 Water Agreement with the Malaysians expires. This is why it is so crucial that we succeed in getting every Singaporean to use water carefully and to minimise water wastage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to our local water resources, the Public Utilities Board's policy is to conserve and develop them to the maximum. The constraint here is land. Already, 50% of the land area of Singapore is used as water catchment areas. PUB has studied and implemented all feasible schemes to exploit local water sources. For instance, it has built storm water collection schemes in developed areas like Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, Tampines and Yishun. Rain water is also collected from the developed areas in Kranji, Pandan and the non-industrial areas in western Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUB has also considered creating additional reservoirs, for example, by damming up the sea between Pulau Ubin \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1112</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and the mainland. However, the problem is lack of a suitable catchment area to collect rainfall to fill the reservoir. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cut down on potable water requirements, there is an on-going effort by PUB to encourage the use of industrial water and sea water for non-potable purposes. Today, industries use about 7 million gallons of industrial water a day for cooling and washing. This represents about 3% of our daily potable water consumption. I have asked PUB to explore with the Ministry of the Environment the wider use of industrial water. Where feasible, we also encourage the use of sea water. Three of our power stations, three oil refineries and several other industrial and commercial organisations are already using sea water for cooling purposes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides conventional sources of water, PUB is also studying the feasibility of desalination. As I had explained in March, desalinated water will cost 7-8 times more than the current cost of treated water. When we will need to resort to using this expensive water will depend very much on how well Singaporeans control their water consumption. Nonetheless, we have to make the preparations now. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers of the PUB, my Ministry and the Ministry of National Development will be visiting some countries that are already operating large-scale desalination plants to learn from their experience. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, when did the Government discover that the current water supply will not be able to meet the demand of Singapore's consumption? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the PUB constantly monitors the usage of water and that is why it has been able to implement various schemes that will come in place and be operational when the water consumption is needed. That is why we have also finalised and built the Linggiu Dam in Johor which enables us to supply the 250 million gallons of water a day that we are entitled to under our agreement with Malaysia. Similarly, we are now discussing with the Indonesians on the development of Bintan water resources as well as water resources on the mainland of Sumatra. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1113</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, my question is: when did the PUB discover that the current water resources or whatever on-going efforts will not be able to meet the future demands of Singapore? When did the PUB discover that and thereby decided to impose the water conservation tax? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, this is not something which just appears from the blue. As I said, PUB monitors and projects water consumption all the time. That is why we have all these water schemes coming in place on a planned basis. However, under the agreement with Malaysia, we are entitled to only a certain amount of water. Based on our projection, with the first agreement expiring in the year 2011, if we can get Singaporeans to reduce the usage of water to 3% a year, we will be able to have enough water until the expiry of the first agreement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have to do now is to plan what will happen after that. As I have pointed out, one alternative is desalination and this is something which has been under study for a long time. We are now sending people to visit countries with operating systems so that we can have the desalination system in place when the water supply is needed. The realisation is not something that has just appeared. It is something that we have been tracking all the time and we feel that it is now timely for us to highlight to Singaporeans that we have to reduce to 3% a year in terms of our water consumption increase. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The Minister said that PUB has been constantly tracking the consumption pattern and projecting the supply for Singapore. The Minister has also said that in the past the Government has taken various measures. What I would like to know is: since 1990, what are the detailed efforts and measures that have been specifically made before the PUB decided that there was no way out except to impose a water conservation tax? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the Member obviously does not quite understand what I have been telling him. The planning process is an on-going one. Why does he think that Singaporeans have never had \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1114</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the problem and trauma of having water shortage? It is because PUB has been monitoring and planning all the time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of highlighting to Singaporeans the need to conserve water, that again is a message which comes out from the PUB regularly. In terms of ensuring that there is adequate supply, that again is something which PUB plans for. Why does he think all the new towns in the eastern part of Singapore have had the storm water collection systems in place. They were not put in place overnight. They were the result of many years of planning and many years of construction of the system. So it is not that we only started doing things in 1990. All the water development programmes have been on-going for many, many years already. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I am not saying that the Government is doing whatever planning for collecting more water now. What I am saying is that since the Government has imposed a water conservation tax as a measure, does it mean that the Ministry concerned has actually exhausted all the measures and efforts in trying to enhance the water resources in Singapore? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, as I have explained just now, all the feasible systems for collecting water in Singapore have already been explored and are already in place. Now we have to get Singaporeans to reduce water consumption. The campaign on the water conservation programme would be one way. However, as our past experience has shown, the price of water is also a very important factor, because that drives home the importance of water. In any case, once we go to desalinated water, which is inevitable, either in the year 2001 if we do not reduce our water consumption rate, or if we are able to halve it, in the year 2011, that will incur a tremendous increase in the price of water. So either way, the price of water will increase. It is better that we get Singaporeans to realise that water is precious and important and the water conservation tax in many ways drives home that importance today, rather than deferring it to the year 2011 or 2001. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1115</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, the Minister says that the message of water conservation has been put across to the people of Singapore regularly. Other than the increase in the water conservation tax, can the Minister tell this House what other measures and campaigns the Government has embarked on to ask the people to conserve water since this matter was discussed in the Budget session? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, when this issue was brought up in the Budget debate, I had explained at that time to Members that the PUB would be embarking on a major water conservation campaign this year.

Illegal bookmakers have made illegal betting convenient and easily accessible to the public. If this is not curtailed, more people will be encouraged to bet illegally. To stem this tide, the Government has decided to introduce a package of measures which include allowing off-course betting, and reducing betting duty for horse-racing and the Singapore Turf Club's commission. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience of other countries which have set up off-course betting facilities such as Australia, Hong Kong and Japan has shown that such a measure is effective in reducing illegal bookmaking. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in every society, there will always be people with the urge to gamble. This is part of human nature which cannot be totally eliminated. If we suppress legal gambling activities, it will only benefit the illegal operators. But with legal gaming facilities, we will be able to satisfy the gambling urge of the public as well as reduce the extent of illegal gambling. The proceeds from legal gambling, which would otherwise have ended up in the coffers of the illegal operators, can also be directed to worthwhile activities such as education, health, community service and the arts. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1119</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, by making it more convenient for Singaporeans to place their bets as a result of introducing off-course betting centres, will it not encourage more Singaporeans to gamble? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is not inconvenient to place bets with illegal operators today. Although the situation is not out of hand, it is a persistent one and we need to take action to curb it. One important difference between the off-course betting that is being introduced and illegal bookmaking is that off-course betting will not provide credit facilities. Therefore, this is a significant difference and it should have some dampening effect on gambling activities as compared to the illegal bookmaking centres. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> On the contrary, Sir. I believe that those people who either have no access or who find it too troublesome to go to the Turf Club to place their bets or too scared or worried to approach an illegal bookmaker because it is illegal, will then find it more convenient to bet legally. As for the rationale of introducing off-course betting which is to stem out illegal activities, the fact is that the Senior Minister of State has mentioned that illegal bookmakers offer credit facilities. Is this going to be effective? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, we believe that by reducing the betting tax as well as the reduction in the commission of the Singapore Turf Club, the profits that illegal bookmakers make from illegal bookmaking will be substantially reduced and therefore the incentive to go into illegal bookmaking will be reduced. We believe that illegal bookmaking should decline. Therefore the other activities associated with illegal bookmaking such as providing easy credit for people to bet should also decline. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, by providing off-course betting centres, it means that illegal bookmakers will now have more direct and convenient access to the results. That would cut their cost as well. If \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1120</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> they compete with the Turf Club, will it necessarily be an effective measure to stamp out illegal bookmaking? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> The Member will know that with modern telecommunication facilities, the dissemination of results is not a particularly difficult thing.

He said that if you have got legal backing the gamblers do not have easy credit.

The CPF Education Scheme is a loan scheme. Hence, a member who borrows CPF savings under the scheme must repay the amount borrowed plus interest in cash. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most cases, part-time degree courses are meant for working adults. Part-time students can also plan in advance their studies and hence put aside sufficient savings to meet their expenses. They should be able to pay the part-time course fees with their own savings, instead of borrowing from their CPF savings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has therefore no intention of extending the Scheme to allow the use of CPF for paying tuition fees of part-time degree courses. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr John De Payva -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr John De Payva (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, would the Minister reconsider, in view of the national direction of training and retraining to upgrade oneself and the constraints that family workers have to go through to look after their family commitments, that they be allowed to use CPF money to finance their courses? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, my Ministry, together with the Ministry of Trade and Industry, has been very supportive of the call for workers to undergo training and retraining. In my view, workers who need \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1122</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to upgrade their skills today have many opportunities to undergo skill upgrading courses with support from their employers and also the Skills Development Fund. There are ample opportunities and training spaces available for workers who need to upgrade their skills through part-time training courses. The Skills Development Fund is looking at various ways and means of increasing the number of training places available for such workers. So there is really no necessity to make CPF available for paying the fees for part-time degree courses in this context. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin (Nominated Member):</b> I have three supplementary questions, Sir. (1) Would the Minister reconsider if the worker does not have enough savings for his part-time course? Would he then make an exception in that case? (2) For part-time courses, the worker continues to work and therefore can continue to build up the CPF. So if some CPF is taken out for education, it does not deplete the account as for a full-time course. (3) It seems to me that we are more willing to let people take their money for investment purposes and buying shares than we are for education purposes. Do we have the right priority? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, in my main answer, I said that a person can plan his part-time course in advance. So if a person does not have sufficient money today to enrol in a part-time course, whether it is for a degree or diploma, there is no difficulty for him to defer for a short period of time and build up enough personal savings so that he can carry on with his education. In fact, today, thousands of Singaporeans are doing it without any difficulty, as evidenced by the number of people who are already taking up such part-time studies. None have had to appeal to CPF directly to use their CPF because they have been able to save sufficient money over a period of time to take up such courses. So I do not think there is a need to make a special exception in this instance to allow such people to use their CPF, although if we do so, of course, it would be more convenient. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1123</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my point is that since people can plan their part-time courses, we encourage them to plan, and the fact that they have to put aside some savings of their own in order to do the course, it would provide better motivation and incentive for them to complete their courses and to do well in those courses so that they can see rising income as a result of higher educational attainment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we in fact have the right priority, I think the Member has to understand that the CPF investment scheme is aimed at helping CPF members to build up their assets. Whereas money that is spent for education is consumed. Whether in fact that would lead to a direct increase in income in proportion to the consumption of CPF savings is yet to be seen. Whereas in the case of people buying shares, if they invest wisely, they would see the shares appreciating over time and they would be able to build up their CPF savings to meet their expenses in their old age. That is the difference between encouraging people who have savings to invest through the CPF investment scheme and not supporting requests for use of CPF to pay for part-time tuition fees. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Would the Minister then consider some recognised special courses which the Ministry thinks will lead to asset enhancement in future and allow the member to use the money for these particular courses and not a blanket approval? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, it is not the purpose of the Ministry to scan the wide variety of part-time courses available and to decide which is better for a particular CPF member. This should be left to individuals to make the decision themselves and it is up to them to put aside sufficient non-CPF savings so that they can meet the expenses for the part-time courses. If she were to ask me, I would say that our criterion is that if he is prepared to undertake a full-time course, with all the discipline and rigours of a full-time course, we are prepared to let him use his CPF to meet the educational expenses under the current education loan scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1124</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, does the Minister agree that even with the CPF investment scheme, there is no guarantee that the asset will be increased? It depends on the shares. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> That is why I said that under the CPF investment scheme, if you invest wisely and prudently, you should see an appreciation of your assets over time, whereas in the case of using CPF for education, the savings would have been consumed immediately and whether you can recover by way of higher income or not is yet left to be seen. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I would like to follow up with a supplementary question. The Minister said that it is not incumbent on the Ministry to scan the various courses offered by foreign universities. Will the Minister consider allowing CPF to be used if these part-time courses are offered by recognised local institutions, for example, the National University of Singapore or one of the polytechnics, as it is done with full time studies? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, my reasons for not allowing the CPF education loan scheme to be extended to part-time courses apply even if the course is offered by NUS or NTU or one of the polytechnics in Singapore. Currently, we will only allow CPF savings to be used for tuition fees if the student is on a full-time course enroled in any of the tertiary institutions in Singapore. We do not intend to make a change in this regard. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Would the Minister explain his rationale why a full-time course is not consumption but investment and a part-time course is consumption but not investment? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have explained on 18th March 1993 the reason why CPF has allowed the use of CPF savings for full-time courses. It was a special exception. We are not making a judgment to say that in the case of a full-time course it would not be consumption. It is in fact just as consumptive as paying fees for part-time courses. But the fact is that the CPF education loan scheme is an exception made in order to assist parents who need to pay for the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1125</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> expenditure of their children to enrol in tertiary institutions. If they choose not to take educational loans which are today widely available, they can then call upon their CPF savings to meet the expenses of their children. In the process, we felt that having allowed a CPF member to use his CPF savings for his children's education, and if he wants to do so for himself on the basis of a full-time study, we should allow him to have the opportunity to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1125</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MEDICAL CHECK-UPS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr John De Payva -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. \n  <b>Mr John De Payva</b> asked the Minister for Health if his Ministry has any long-term plan to conduct bi-yearly medical check-ups for senior citizens above 65 years of age in view of our ageing population. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline K.

The value of the Singapore dollar is determined by economic fundamentals. MAS will continue to intervene, whenever necessary, against exchange rate movements which are not supported by fundamentals. In recent months, the Singapore dollar has appreciated against the US dollar, but it has depreciated against the Yen and the Deutschemark. This is unlike the Yen, which has risen against all currencies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the level of individual companies, exporters to the US face pressure on margins because of the weakness of the US dollar. On the other hand, exporters to Europe and Japan are benefitting from the strengthening of the Yen and the Deutschemark. Overall, the value of the Singapore dollar has remained little changed, measured against a basket of currencies of Singapore's major trading partners and competitors. The recent exchange rate movements are thus unlikely to have a significant impact on the Singapore economy as a whole. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1126</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>GOVERNMENT OF SINGAPORE INVESTMENT CORPORATION</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Profit or loss in currency trading)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. \n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Finance what is the profit or loss of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation in currency \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1127</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> trading through the Monetary Authority of Singapore account between 1st March and 30th April 1995 in the trading of US dollars and the yen. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the period 1st March 1995 to 30th April 1995, the US dollar to Singapore dollar exchange rate fell from S$1.4495 at the beginning of the period to S$1.394 at the end of the period.

It cannot intervene in order to buck the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1128</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> market and it certainly does not intervene to manipulate the Singapore dollar to make money. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister's main answer mentioned that the Singapore dollar would have to reflect the economic fundamentals.

The exchange value of the Singapore dollar is one thing. The value of the Singapore reserves which are invested overseas in foreign assets is a different matter. If the US dollar is moving down or moving up, and we know it, we have some room to adjust our portfolio in or out of the US dollar, as the case may be. But that means from US dollars to Deutschemark, US dollars to Yen, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, and not from the US dollars to Singapore dollars, because these are, by definition, our foreign reserves which are being managed. So the movements of the foreign currencies have implications in the way GIC would manage our assets. But that is quite different from the question of what is the exchange rate of the Singapore dollar today and what was it on 1st March. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1128</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>FULL-TIME NATIONAL SERVICEMEN IN POLICE FORCE</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Defence (a) what percentage of full-time National Servicemen (NSF) do their national service in the police force and what is their ethnic breakdown; (b) what are the criteria used for channelling these NSF into the police force; and (c) what percentage of these NSF join the police force as regulars after their national service stint. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Defence (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, every eligible male Singaporean is called up for full-time National Service.

Under these programmes, we have conducted courses in civil aviation and port management, among others, that are relevant to the needs of the developing countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that this approach to assisting developing countries is more effective and better targeted than contributing soft loans to multilateral development agencies like the ADB and World Bank. Through our training programmes, we have been sharing our knowledge and skills directly with the countries to develop their human resources. We will have less control over the development impact of our contribution if the funds are channelled through a multilateral aid agency. Even if we start by donating a token sum to the ADF, as suggested by Dr Soin, the commitment will not be \"one-off\". It will grow with time as the funding needs of developing countries increase. We must ensure that the money we spend in aid, like all other items of public expenditure, is cost effective and produces the desired results. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1131</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, does the Deputy Prime Minister remember that Singapore borrowed money from the ADF loan facility between 1968 and 1972?

Should we not consider helping other countries since we have made use of that loan? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> We borrowed very small sums, Mr Speaker. We have prospered and developed through our own efforts by lifting ourselves up because really that is the way to prosper. If you want to do well, you do not do well through aid or cheap loans. You do well by working harder and uplifting yourself. You need assistance, technical training, that is helpful. We benefited from the Colombo Plan, and schemes like that. We believe that the best contribution we can make is similarly by offering technical training to developing countries in the region, and we have a substantial programme. Every year about 800 foreign people come to be trained in Singapore on various activities. Some longer, some shorter. And we believe that is the most cost effective way of doing it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Would the Deputy Prime Minister agree that if you teach a man how to fish, he will still have to buy the fishing net? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The best fishermen have very bankable propositions and have no difficulty raising money. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, would the Deputy Prime Minister agree that to boost our international image, it would be proper for us to give some money as a soft loan because the other Tiger economies are also doing so, like Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in every country, the amount of aid and the disposition of the aid is a question. Is it being spent well? Does it achieve its objective in the target country? Does it further the interest of the donor country? So when we give assistance, I think we also have to ask similar questions. When we train somebody, we are helping him to acquire the skills, ability and the knowledge which will enable him to go back to his country and do something \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1132</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> which should be of lasting importance to his country. His experience here, if it has been a happy one, and I think in many cases it has been, will make him, if not our ambassador, a friend of Singapore who will leave with his countrymen a good impression of Singapore and what Singaporeans can do to help. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We assist within our abilities. We may be not as undeveloped as we used to be, but we are not a country with resources to give away. So when we commit aid, it must be with a view to specific development outcomes and we believe that the scheme which we have is really the most effective one. Other countries have chosen to do it differently. Well, it is their choice. We do not argue that they should do it our way and I think they should not argue that we should do it their way. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1132</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>FLATS AT BUKIT BATOK CENTRAL</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Rationale for upgrading)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. \n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for National Development what is the rationale for upgrading three blocks of flats at Bukit Batok Central when they are only about ten years old. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Matthias Yao Chih) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the three blocks are being upgraded under the Interim Upgrading Programme (IUP).

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill amends the Small Claims Tribunals Act (Chapter 308). In February 1994, the Chief Justice set up a working group, chaired by a senior District Judge, to review the Small Claims Tribunals Act (`the Act'), especially to consider enlarging the tribunals' jurisdiction in terms of quantum and nature of claims. The amendments in this Bill, which have been endorsed by the Chief Justice, are the result of the work of this Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these amendments are timely because of the increase in the nature and volume of cases heard by the tribunals. They seek to achieve the following objectives: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, increase the monetary jurisdiction of the tribunals from $2,000 to $5,000; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, widen the categories of claims which can be heard by the tribunals; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, provide for additional circumstances where an individual claimant may be represented in proceedings before the tribunals. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the main amendments in the Bill - first, increase in jurisdictional limit from $2,000 to $5,000. The present jurisdictional limit of $2,000 has remained unchanged since the Small Claims Tribunals Act was passed 10 years ago in 1985. At that time, this sum was appropriate as measured against the monetary jurisdiction of the Magistrates' Courts of $10,000. In July 1993, the jurisdiction of the Magistrates' Courts was raised to $30,000. Apart from this fact, inflation and rising costs of living justify an upward revision of the tribunals' monetary jurisdiction. The new limit of $5,000 can be increased to $10,000 if both parties to the claim consent in writing for the tribunals to hear the dispute. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order for the tribunals to remain responsive to the changing needs of the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1136</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> community, this monetary jurisdiction can be varied as and when circumstances justify it. This can be expeditiously done by way of subsidiary legislation. These changes are reflected in amendments to sections 2 and 5 of the Act through clauses 2 and 3 of this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Consumers' Association of Singapore (CASE) has asked for an even higher increase to the tribunals' new monetary limits. They suggest that for contracts of sale, provision and supply of goods and services, the limit should be raised to $10,000. CASE's desire to increase the tribunals' monetary limits so as to provide consumers with even greater access is laudable. However, the Government would prefer to proceed cautiously. Let us proceed step by step and increase the jurisdiction to $5,000 from the present $2,000 before considering any further increases. This approach will enable the Tribunal to better assess and cope with the expected increase in demand for its services. After assessing the Tribunals' functioning when the new limits have been implemented for some time, if it is found that the tribunals are in a position to handle larger claims, the Government will consider increasing the limit. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move now to the next major amendment - to provide for the inclusion of a new category of claims under section 5 of the Act covering claims in tort arising from damage caused to property. Claims arising from motor vehicle accidents will be excluded as there are other procedures such as insurance policies to deal with such claims. The tribunals receive many complaints involving damage caused to common areas of property between neighbouring houses or apartment units as a result of renovation works. This amendment will allow for the speedy resolution of these and other claims involving damage to property. Settlement of such disputes between neighbours in an informal manner will promote better social well-being. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, Sir, CASE has suggested that other categories be included in the tribunals' jurisdiction. These are hire purchase transactions, tenancies not \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1137</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> exceeding $2,000 and contracts for the sale of shares up to $10,000. Sir, the Committee set up to review the Small Claims Tribunals Act had considered some of these categories for inclusion but, after careful consideration, had not recommended it. Tenancies, securities and hire purchase claims often involve relatively complex legal issues which the tribunals may not be equipped to handle. Again, I would advise an incremental approach. Let us monitor how the tribunals handle their enlarged jurisdiction first. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to the third important amendment in the Bill to allow certain categories of claimants to be represented in proceedings before the tribunals by another person who is not an advocate and solicitor. The Act is presently silent on whether a management corporation, a minor or an aged, illiterate or infirm person may be represented by another person before the tribunals. The tribunals have in practice allowed such persons to be represented whenever the need arose. This amendment will clarify and regularise the current practice. Tourists, in particular, will find this amendment useful. Tourists who discover that they have purchased defective goods after leaving Singapore may now seek redress before the tribunals through a representative in Singapore. In this connection, the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board has agreed to act as the representative of such tourists in appropriate cases. This amendment will be to section 21 of the Act through clause 6 of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one other amendment is the provision for claims to be lodged by electronic means. This is in keeping with the increased emphasis to computerise so as to boost productivity and efficiency. The lodgement of claims by electronic means will expedite the processing of claims and streamline the administration of the tribunals to better serve the public. The proposed amendment will be to section 15 of the Act through clause 5 of the Bill. The other amendments to the Bill, ie, to section 9 of the Act through its repeal and re-enactment in clause 4 of this Bill is of a consequential nature arising out \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1138</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of the repeal and re-enactment of section 5. Clause 7 also makes consequential amendments to section 32(2) of the Act arising from the repeal and re-enactment of section 5. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Chief Justice delivered his speech at the opening of the legal year in January 1995, he observed that the caseloads of the tribunals had increased dramatically from 3,788 cases to some 26,000 cases by the end of 1994, almost a seven-fold increase. I believe that the recommendations of this Committee when implemented will not only improve its functioning but also allow the public to have greater access to the tribunals as quick and inexpensive forums for the resolution of disputes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Bedok GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Small Claims Tribunals have been in operation for 10 years now. It has fulfilled its promise of being a simple, inexpensive and accessible forum for small claims to be made, in particular, consumers have benefited from this forum. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take this opportunity to call on all Singapore consumers not to be shy of using the Small Claims Tribunals. My understanding is that consumers who have used the Small Claims Tribunals have found this a pleasant experience. The fact that the tribunals now do seven times more work is testimony to this. The fact that they have to present their own case has helped them also to better understand how the law works. On this score, I suggest that the Consumers' Association of Singapore consider providing assistance and advice to consumers who may wish to press their claims before the Small Claims Tribunals. CASE could advise them on their legal rights and prepare them for the hearing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend the Government for taking this important step of enlarging the jurisdiction of the tribunals. With more types of claims and a higher quantum, I am sure more Singaporeans, both businessmen and consumers, will benefit. In addition, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1139</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> this will provide a viable alternative to our court system where legal costs are incurred. In this way, this amendment will help to keep legal costs down. I welcome this amendment as it will make the small claims process even more convenient for Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Law had announced in this year's Committee of Supply debate that the Government is considering setting up regional centres and to decentralise the Small Claims Tribunals. I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary on the progress of this scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, first, let me thank the GPC Chairman for his support of the Bill. I think his call to CASE to take a higher role in helping consumers is timely. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the GPC Chairman has asked about the announcement made by the Minister earlier this year on the setting up of regional centres for the Small Claims Tribunals. Since then, Sir, we have been looking at this seriously. A Working Group has been formed comprising Ministry of Law together with Subordinate Court officials. The idea is to bring community justice to the people. So we are targeting the implementation of this scheme by way of a pilot centre some time towards the end of the year in a suitable locality. If it is successful, we can consider having more centres. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point about this scheme is that we intend to have leading members of the community, like Justices of the Peace, who can be appointed as Assistant Registrars under the Small Claims Act who will help to mediate in these regional centres. They will act as the conciliators in the consultation stage. Only when the parties cannot settle their dispute at the consultation stage at these regional centres, they will then go to the Small Claims Tribunals at the Apollo Centre. That is the progress at this stage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1140</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1140</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MERCHANT SHIPPING BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>1.47 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister of State for Communications (Mr Goh Chee Wee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Merchant Shipping Act (1985 edition) was inherited from the British and contained many provisions governing various aspects of the functions of the Marine Department. As part of its regular review of legislation to bring it in line with current international practices and our needs, the Marine Department had done a complete review of the Act. In the course of the review, the Marine Department had consulted various public and private sector organisations involved such as shipowners through the Singapore National Shipping Association, seafarers through their unions, shipping employers through the Singapore Maritime Employers' Federation, TDB, Immigration Department and PSA. The result is a completely new Merchant Shipping Bill 1995 which seeks to repeal and re-enact with amendments the existing Merchant Shipping Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the removal of obsolete provisions and the updating of certain provisions, the new Act will contain the essential provisions while most of the detailed administrative and procedural provisions will be moved to subsidiary legislation. In this way, the new Act will be flexible enough to adapt quickly to continuing changes in the shipping industry. The provisions which are removed and incorporated in the new regulations relate mainly to matters concerning the crew on board Singapore ships like crew agreements, the engagement and discharge of seamen, payment of wages and account of wages, and the keeping of official log books. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have added a provision to empower the Minister to reduce or vary the fee for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1141</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> registration of ships as circumstances warrant. This is to enable our Registry of Ships to respond quickly to competition, as we need to keep the registration fee attractive to international shipping. This will help build up our status as an international maritime centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Register books are where records of Singapore ships are kept. They serve as registers of titles to the ships, and hence new provisions concerning register books are introduced. In keeping with its importance, provisions relating to entries, amendments, rectification of clerical errors, and substantive law on ownership are introduced to regulate and facilitate the maintenance of these record books. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also contains a provision to empower the Minister to make regulations for the registration of bareboat chartered ships and to allow Singapore ships to be bareboat chartered out and registered in other countries. Our law currently allows the registration of a ship under the name of its legal owner only. Bareboat registration allows the registration to be done under the name of the charterer. The advantage of bareboat registration is that it allows the charterers the flexibility to charter the ship and register it with our Registry without having to buy over the vessel. At the same time, charterers enjoy the privileges accorded to the flag, eg, under bilateral shipping agreements. It also allows owners to structure their set-up for maximum advantage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An increasing number of countries, including the UK, are allowing bareboat registration. Hence, if Singapore is to retain its competitive edge, we will need to offer at least the same facilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demand for the registration of pleasure crafts is increasing, especially with Singapore's growing affluence. Registration confers nationality which a pleasure craft needs when sailing into international waters or calling at other ports. The Bill therefore provides for regulations for the registration of pleasure crafts. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1142</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other new provisions include imposing a duty on the master of a ship involved in a collision to assist the other ship, requiring the registration of births and deaths on Singapore ships and enabling the crew of a Singapore ship to claim to be discharged if the ship ceases to be registered in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Goh Chee Wee]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1142</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>BUILDING CONTROL (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Building Control Act was promulgated in 1989 to strengthen the law in respect of building control. The Act, first of all, enhanced the powers of the Building Authority in regulating building works and safety of buildings. It provided for the checking of structural plans by Accredited Checkers, the supervision of construction works by qualified persons and the periodic inspections of buildings by structural engineers. The Act also increased the penalties for offences. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After implementing the Act for the past six years, experience shows that certain provisions of the Act need fine-tuning in order to achieve better control of building works. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now highlight the key refinements of the Act proposed in this Amendment Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to expand the coverage of the Act. There are three statutory boards, namely, HDB, MRTC and PSA, which have been granted exemption from submitting plans for their building projects to the Building Authority for approval. The exemption \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1143</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> was given to the HDB to enable it to speed up its public housing programme. The MRTC was similarly exempted from submitting plans to the Building Authority for the implementation of the MRT system. The PSA was exempted under the PSA Act from submitting plans to the Building Authority for port related structures within the port area. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were valid reasons for granting exemption to the three statutory boards which specialise in their own area of work. Over time, these three boards have accumulated track record and specialist expertise in implementing the types of developments under their charge. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Amendment Bill proposes to bring the building projects of the three boards under the ambit of the Building Control Act, and to regulate the developments of these boards by setting up a formalised mechanism within the three boards to control their own building works. Building Control Units (BCUs) will be set up within these statutory boards, as independent units, to check and approve their in-house building plans. To ensure effective control and consistency, the BCD will oversee the operations of the BCUs. It will conduct audit checks to ensure compliance with the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to empower the Building Authority to delegate sufficient powers to qualified persons in the BCUs of these three statutory boards. When the new system is in place, the existing Exemption Orders will be revoked. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, to improve the Accredited Checker system. The Accredited Checker system was introduced to provide an independent check of structural plans and design calculations. The Building Authority's role in the system is to carry out audit checks. The Bill seeks to make it clear that the Building Authority may approve structural plans which had been checked and certified by an Accredited Checker without having to check them again. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, while an Accredited Checker is required to be appointed, the Act is silent on who should appoint the Accredited Checker. The Bill seeks to make \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1144</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> it clear that the person for whom the building works are carried out shall appoint the Accredited Checker, and prescribes the duties of the Accredited Checker and the penalty for failure to carry out the duties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under current provisions, an Accredited Checker is not allowed to check structural plans for building works for which he has been responsible for the design or construction in any capacity. This is unnecessarily restrictive. The Bill seeks to allow a professional engineer who was previously involved only in minor alterations to a building to be appointed as an Accredited Checker for subsequent alterations to the same building. Similarly, such an engineer will be allowed to be appointed as the structural engineer for any subsequent periodical inspection of the building. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to empower the Minister to permit certain statutory boards to use their in-house Accredited Checkers to check the structural plans, and to use their structural engineers to carry out periodical inspections of the boards' buildings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Bill seeks to empower the Building Authority to disapprove badly prepared plans, without having to issue written instructions and directions to the qualified persons. This will encourage qualified persons to prepare their plans properly in the first instance. The plans will also be disapproved if qualified persons fail to comply with the written directions and resubmit the plans within the specified period. The Building Authority will be empowered to revoke its approval if any information given in the application is later found to be false. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, in non-subdivided buildings, the Building Authority has encountered difficulties in getting the flat owners to jointly appoint a structural engineer to inspect the building. This Bill seeks to empower the Building Authority to require flat owners to jointly appoint a structural engineer to inspect the building, and to carry out the works recommended by the appointed engineer. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1145</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is an offence to occupy a building without a Temporary Occupation Permit or a Certificate of Statutory Completion. It should also be an offence for the owners of such buildings to permit these buildings to be occupied. However, this is currently not stipulated in the Act. This Bill seeks to make it an offence for the owners of such buildings to permit them to be occupied if they do not have the requisite permits. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other refinements in the Bill include the deletion of those provisions which have been superseded by the Fire Safety Act, and new provisions relating to the use of computer generated documents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Building Control (Amendment) Bill is necessary to fine-tune the provisions of the Act to achieve better control of building works. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1145</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>TREASURY BILLS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Acting Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Acting Minister for the Environment (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 3 of the Local Treasury Bills Act (Chapter 167), resolves that the Minister for Finance be authorised to borrow by the issue of Treasury Bills in Singapore a sum not exceeding Singapore ten thousand million dollars. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 26th March 1987, Parliament resolved, in accordance with section 2 of the Local Treasury Bills Act (Chapter 72) [current reference would now be section 3 of the Act (Chapter 167)], that the Minister be authorised to borrow by the issue of Treasury Bills in Singapore a sum not exceeding $6,000 million. Since 1987 the demand for Treasury Bills has grown rapidly. The liabilities base of the banks is expected to expand further due to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1146</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> continued strong economic growth and large capital inflows. This would increase banks' demand for Treasury Bills as liquid assets. The present limit of $6,000 million is likely to be insufficient to meet the additional demand. The authority of Parliament is therefore requested to enable the Government to issue Treasury Bills up to an amount not exceeding $10,000 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 3 of the Local Treasury Bills Act (Chapter 167), resolves that the Minister for Finance be authorised to borrow by the issue of Treasury Bills in Singapore a sum not exceeding Singapore ten thousand million dollars. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1146</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>TIME LIMIT FOR SPEECHES</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I seek your consent and the general assent of Members present to move that the proceedings on item 5 on the Order Paper be exempted from the provisions of Standing Order No. 45 to enable Members to speak without being subject to the limits for speeches, as this is an important subject for thorough airing of the episode. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> You have my consent.

However, the hanging of Flor Contemplacion started a chain of events that has placed a strain in Singapore-Philippine relations and caused other reverberations affecting Singapore's regional and international image. It behoves us to learn from this experience. Many Singaporeans are asking whether a stay, ie, a delay or deferment in the execution of Flor Contemplacion could have prevented this unfortunate state of affairs. A Feedback Unit survey conducted in April revealed that one-third of the respondents felt that with hindsight, the Government could have acceded to the request of Philippine President Fidel Ramos to delay the 17th March execution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To refresh our memories about this unfortunate case of Flor Contemplacion, let us look at some of the events in a chronological order. The information is from reports in the Straits Times and other media. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 21st January 1995, it was reported that President Ramos asked President Ong Teng Cheong to grant clemency on humanitarian grounds to Flor Contemplacion. This appeal was turned down on the absence of mitigating factors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In early March, three demonstrations in four days against the death sentence of Flor Contemplacion were held outside the Singapore Embassy in Manila. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1148</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10th March 1995 - Philippine Solicitor-General (Raul Goco) sent a letter to Singapore's Attorney-General (Chan Sek Keong) seeking deferment of execution of Flor Contemplacion. Mr Goco in the letter, a copy of which was released to the media, wrote, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Without meaning to interfere in your judicial processes, I would like to request your assistance in seeking a deferment of the execution.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>The letter also said that \"this present request is promoted by the desire of my Government, in its ministrant capacity, to put all doubts to rest before the case of Mrs Contemplacion comes to a final conclusion.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The request followed what the Government said was new evidence from another Filipina maid who claimed that she had overheard a conversation between two men which led her to believe that Contemplacion was not the killer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11th March 1995 - President Ramos made yet another appeal to President Ong, in which he expressed his and the Filipino people's \"great sadness\" over a Singapore court's decision condemning Flor Contemplacion to death. In his letter, President Ramos cited the \"close and friendly relations that bind our two peoples together\" and asked President Ong to allow a review of the condemned woman's case. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Since Mrs Frenilla is willing to come forward with her testimony, and as we are dealing with a human life, I request your Excellency for a stay of execution to allow this new evidence proper consideration,\" he said. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ramos had asked for a postponement based on a sworn statement by another maid, Mrs Emilia Frenilla. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13th March 1995 - Another protest outside the Singapore Embassy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14th March 1995 - Up to 5,000 people rallied peacefully outside the Singapore Embassy in Manila to demand a retrial for Flor Contemplacion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1149</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15th March 1995 - In a statement dated 15th March 1995, the Government said it had taken the appeal by President Ramos seriously and had studied the evidence carefully but turned down the appeal to stay the execution of Flor Contemplacion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was because the \"new evidence\" that was given and was supposed to exonerate her was found to be untrue. The new evidence was a statement by Contemplacion's friend, Mrs Emillia Frenilla, who once worked in Singapore. She claimed, among other things, that Mrs Maga's employer had killed her. Mrs Della Maga was the murdered maid. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Ong replied to Mr Ramos on 15th March 1995, saying there was no basis to justify a stay of execution. He also provided Mr Ramos with copies of Contemplacion's statements to the police, and her petition for clemency. She had admitted to both murders to the police and in the High Court and the Court of Appeal hearings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 1,500 demonstrators gathered at the Singapore Embassy to protest Singapore's rejection of clemency appeals. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, an all-night vigil was held by many people in a car park across the Singapore Embassy in Manila. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17th March 1995 - The hanging of Flor Contemplacion was carried out early in the morning. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second appeal by President Ramos was made on 11th March 1995. It was turned down by President Ong on 15th March 1995 and the hanging of Flor Contemplacion took place on 17th March 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the \"new evidence\" must have been considered carefully by the Singapore authorities, the time lapse of only four to five days between request and refusal can give the unfortunate impression that due and proper consideration was not given to the new material furnished by the Philippine authorities. This could have been one aggravating \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1150</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> factor in the strain in Singapore-Philippine relations. To put it another way, whilst justice was done, it was not seen to be done. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of this chronology of events, why did the Government not grant a stay of execution of Flor Contemplacion? What would have been lost in granting the stay? We did delay the execution of Macau-born Angel Mou to spend Christmas with her family. She was hanged for trafficking in heroin. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Philippines is an ASEAN neighbour and so why were we seemingly insensitive to the requests of its Head of State? On 21st March 1995, President Ramos in a speech to the Federation of Philippine Broadcasters said he \"felt bad\" about President Ong Teng Cheong's rejection of two personal appeals from him to defer the execution of Flor Contemplacion. Could we have committed a miscalculation in not allowing a stay in the execution of Flor Contemplacion? Could it have been a hasty decision? Should we have acceded to the request of Mr Ramos in the interest of foreign relations? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it is easier to speak after the event and with the benefit of hindsight but, as Parliamentarians, it is our duty to ask questions and question Government policies that adversely affect our country and people. These related questions therefore need also to be answered by the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Did our Foreign Ministry and our intelligence officers gauge the extent of the feelings of the Filipino people towards the impending execution of Flor Contemplacion? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) How much significance was attributed by our own experts to the pre-execution rallies and newspaper reports in the Philippines? Was the Flor Contemplacion case already a cause celebre in the Philippines before the execution? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Was it possible to have been aware that the Philippine pre-election fever of 8th May 1995 could have used the hanging of Flor Contemplacion as their \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1151</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> burning issue? If we had been aware of this, then we could have prudently stayed the execution till after the Philippine elections. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Could we possibly have acceded to the requests of President Ramos to delay the execution and not felt threatened that by doing so, we were in any way abdicating our role as a sovereign nation? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Besides efficiency, non-corruptibility, the ability to direct Singapore's economic growth in a spectacular way and other positive qualities, is it time for our Government to also reveal its latent empathy with non-economic issues like the stay of execution of Flor Contemplacion, without feeling that the Government is becoming soft? By delaying the execution, it would have shown that it is possible to carry out the force of law and yet temper it with compassion, humanitarian grounds and diplomatic savvy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Why did the prison authorities not give permission for Flor Contemplacion to embrace her children before her death as was reported in the media? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that other Members of this House have these and other similar concerns to which they would like an answer from the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now move to the second aspect of my motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Criminal Justice System Institutions and Contemplacion's Case</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House will recollect that the Gancayco Commission in the Philippines had concluded in its findings that Contemplacion could not have committed the murders of Della Maga and Nicholas Huang and that Contemplacion was apparently a victim of grave injustice and recommended that the Singapore Government reopen investigations of the killing of Maga. These findings have been rightly rejected by our Government as being based on uncorroborated and, worse, hearsay testimonies and totally ignoring the records of the trial and other information supplied by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Commission had also without \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1152</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> any justification described Singapore as a police state which tolerates, if not, allows the use of torture, meaning that Contemplacion's confession, like so many others, was extracted from her by the Investigating Officer by torture so as to found her subsequent conviction on. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the large attendant publicity raised nationally and internationally by the Contemplacion case, our judiciary and criminal justice system, together with the other law enforcement and evidence gathering agencies like the Police and the Institute of Science and Forensic Medicine, particularly its pathologists, have unnecessarily been maligned by the Gancayco Commission which was palpably wrong in making its findings. Our Government's rejection of these findings have been vindicated not only by President Ramos when he subsequently described the work of the Gancayco Commission embarrassing to him but also by former Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo last week when he tellingly said in a farewell speech sponsored by the business community: I quote part of his speech from the Straits Times: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Gancayco Commission is an egregious example of a creature of Government that is unable to understand measures and standards, that is quick to come to judgments, conclusions and decisions on the basis of unproven assumptions, that is incapable of distinguishing between truth and falsehood and between the honest and the charlatan ...\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"fact-finding became fault finding that was not supported by fact\" and the members (of the Commission) \"did not have any framework within which to work, and thus made it up along the way.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Once they heard what they wanted to hear, they accepted it as incontrovertible fact. The Gancayco Commission arrived at its conclusions and recommendations not with facts but with opinions fuelled by public and personal emotion ...\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asian Wall Street Journal, not an uncritical admirer of Singapore, had about a month earlier in an editorial on 13th April independently looked at the findings of the Gancayco Commission and the way the Commission conducted itself and had concluded that the Commission had given Singapore a \"bum rap\". Only the distant New York Times and its columnist William Safire remain unrepentant. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1153</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the judiciary and the Police are pivotal pillars of any society in ensuring the maintenance of law, order and good government. So are the supporting agencies like the Institute of Forensic Science and Medicine. Wantonly repeated and unjustified attacks on these institutions can erode the confidence of our society and the international community in us which as a tiny nation we can ill afford. Our prosperity must ultimately depend to a great extent on the vitality and viability of those two institutions. Therefore it is necessary to guard and perpetuate their integrity. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Feedback Unit survey was done in April 1995 to assess the reaction of the public to the handling of the Flor Contemplacion case. Referring to the results of this survey, Dr Ow Chin Hock said, \"They also have confidence in the judiciary of Singapore and believe the investigations by our Police to have been thorough and proper.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professional competence and integrity of the Singapore pathologists from the Institute of Forensic Science and Medicine who conducted the autopsy on Maga and which was questioned by the Philippine authorities has already been re-established at home and internationally. The Singapore pathologist's findings were unanimously confirmed by three internationally recognised consultant pathologists, a Distinguished Service Professor of Anthropology from the University of Florida, the Director, Forensic Sciences Unit, New York Police and the Director, Department of Pathology of St. Francis Central Hospital Pittsburg who travelled with the Singapore team to Manila to conduct a joint autopsy on the remains of Contemplacion. These experts announced that the Singapore autopsy was professionally performed and correct in its findings and conclusions, namely, that: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Maga died as a result of asphyxia due to ligature strangulation; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) There were no fractures of the skull, shoulder bone or ribs and that there was \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1154</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> no evidence of anti-mortem traumatic fractures of the ribs as claimed by the Philippine side. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) There was no basis whatsoever for concluding that Maga was killed by a man or a woman skilled in martial arts. \n  <br>\n  <br>The three experts also praised the work of the Singapore pathologists stating: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The post-mortem protocol prepared by the Institute of Science and Forensic Medicine was a thoroughly documented, complete and accurate presentation of all the pathological findings relating to Della Maga's murder.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to briefly acquaint the House with a few salient facts in connection with the trial of Contemplacion and her remand and detention. Some three and a half years elapsed after Contemplacion's arrest and the final rejection of her appeal by the Court of Appeal in October 1994. During those years she was defended by two sets of lawyers, both at the Court of first instance and on appeal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the High Court trial, Contemplacion was originally represented by one set of two lawyers. She remained silent when her defence was called. She was convicted of the double murder. On appeal, she was represented by a set of two new lawyers. On submissions of her Counsel, the Court of Appeal remitted the case to the trial judge to hear evidence that she may not have been guilty of murder by reason of diminished responsibility. She was thereafter represented by the same two new lawyers at the continued trial in the High Court. A private psychiatrist was allowed to interview her and psychiatric evidence was called on her behalf in respect of these interviews despite the fact that she had earlier been assessed by another private psychiatrist who was not called to testify on her behalf. At this continued trial she testified and admitted to the killing and described why she did, what she did. The trial judge, having heard all the evidence, was not persuaded into making a finding on a reduced charge that Contemplacion suffered from diminished responsibility and she was once again convicted of the murders. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of Appeal upheld the convictions of murder on 19th October 1994. In \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1155</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> its judgment the highest court in the land categorically stated that the material facts relating to the killing of the deceased had not been in dispute - I emphasise had not been in dispute - which facts it said had been adequately set out in the grounds of the trial judge and which facts the Court of Appeal adopted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may add that Contemplacion did not retract her confession throughout the trial, appeal or in her petition for presidential clemency. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In remand and in prison after her conviction, she had also been visited by Philippine Embassy officials, her various Counsel, psychiatrists and also by a religious sister some 68 times. She did not give anyone of them an indication of her innocence. Even the letters that Flor Contemplacion received from her daughter in prison mention the mother's steadfast insistence that she was guilty of the murder. According to press reports, Ms Elizabeth Buensacesco, First Secretary and Consul General of the Philippines Embassy was reported to have said in the Manila Chronicle that she saw Contemplacion soon after her arrest and during the time when she was being interrogated and before she had signed any document. According to Ms Buensacesco, Contemplacion after receiving advice from her to deny everything she said to the Police was nevertheless adamant that she committed the crime. The point I wish to make, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that it is normal police procedure not to allow visitors to see a potential accused immediately after arrest whilst active investigations and questioning are in progress so that investigations are not hampered or adversely affected. It is therefore to the credit of the Police that Ms Buensacesco was given access to Contemplacion although the stage of the investigations was a sensitive one. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to draw the attention of the House to the findings of the World Economic Forum which conducts a very authoritative annual assessment of world governments and life in their countries. In its 1994 report, having assessed the quality of justice in 12 Asian countries, amongst which was the Philippines, Singapore was placed No. 1. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1156</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Correction of Miscarriage of Justice</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now turn to a connected matter. Although our system of justice has been adjudged to be the best, I would like to make a call to this House and the Minister for Law at some time in the near future to fine-tune it. I therefore wish to focus the attention of the House to one disquieting fact, and that is, that there is no procedure after the final determination of an appeal in a criminal case for an accused, and especially an accused who is sentenced to death, to have his case reopened before the courts to correct a possible miscarriage of justice, that is, where a convicted accused's lawyers believe that they have relevant and credible fresh evidence capable of belief which was not previously available and which evidence may overturn the conviction and so avoid the miscarriage of justice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, in two cases, which I am quoting to state a principle but not in any way suggesting that there was merit in their application, Lim Choon Chye v Public Prosecutor and Abdullah bin Rahman v Public Prosecutor where fresh evidence was sought to be introduced by application in the Court of Appeal after the conclusion of the appeals, the Court of Appeal held that it was functus officio in so far as the appeals were concerned and that there was no express provision in the law which allowed it jurisdiction to hear fresh evidence, thereby reopening the case after the appeal had been heard and finally disposed of. In Lim Choon Chye's case, the Court of Appeal further said that, in any case, the unsuccessful appellant is not without recourse or remedy because the petition of clemency lies to the President of the Republic. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, whilst the President can obviously pardon a convicted person who is subsequently shown to be innocent, I believe, as I think most of the legal fraternity does, that a general recourse to a Petition of Clemency in circumstances where an accused claims innocence to the charges convicted on is perhaps an inadequate and inappropriate recourse to fall back on. Further, the purported fresh evidence sought to be introduced necessarily involves investigation, assessment \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1157</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and probably new findings. The proper forum for the reception and assessment of fresh evidence and making a finding as to guilt or innocence cannot be the existing body, that is, the Cabinet which is charged with the task of advising the President on clemency under section 8 of the Republic of Singapore Independence Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, a new law is necessary for considering and investigating allegations of miscarriages of justice and correcting them when appeal rights have been exhausted. As to whether some existing body or new body should have the responsibility for reopening a case and investigating it is a matter I leave to the Minister for Law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United Kingdom, the current law is that if a convicted person has exhausted his avenues of appeal and wishes to reopen his case in the courts, the Home Secretary must be persuaded to refer it to the Court of Appeal. However, a Criminal Appeal Bill is currently seeing its possible passage through Parliament with the proposal to create a Criminal Cases Review Commission to replace the Home Office to investigate and review the case concerning the alleged miscarriage of justice. Upon completion of its investigation, if the Commission believes that the case should be reconsidered by the Court of Appeal, it would refer the case to the Court of Appeal without making any recommendations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part, may I make the following observation and suggestion: I believe that whilst there is no presumption against the police reinvestigating their own cases, an independent Criminal Cases Review Commission or Authority is also desirable in Singapore along similar lines as proposed in the United Kingdom, especially in view of the death penalty imposable on a number of offences. The Commission, if it thinks fit, after investigations, refers the case to the Court of Appeal for its decision forwarding to it all admissible evidence and without making any recommendation. The Commission or Authority would also act as a filter against frivolous attempts to reopen a case. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1158</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Flor Contemplacion, I have no doubt whatsoever that justice was meted out and there was due process of law. However, a mechanism or avenue to correct miscarriage of justice, Mr Speaker, Sir, is essential to prevent miscarriages of justice which can never be ruled out by the discovery of some unexpected fact that comes to light. The sanctity of innocent life must be preserved. A mechanism for the correction of miscarriage of justice after the appeal procedures are exhausted will streamline the system of criminal justice and further contribute to the confidence and respect Singaporeans have for the law and the administration of justice. Justice is not a fact but a quality. Justice may be depicted symbolically as blind but I do not think any of us want to turn a blind eye to injustice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr John De Payva -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr John De Payva (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let met state, from the outset, that I am seconding the motion not because I believe in the garbage churned out by the Manila press over the Flor Contemplacion case. I am doing so in the hope that we, Members in this House - whatever our political persuasion - can have an opportunity to express our views on a matter of national concern. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relations between Singapore and the Philippines have been soured up because we executed a convicted double murderer despite an appeal by President Ramos for a stay of execution. In the days before the execution, various groups in the Philippines expressed their deep concern over the fact that Singapore was about to hang a Filipina maid for the murder of another Filipina maid, Della Maga, and a four-year old boy under her charge, Nicholas Huang. Trade unions in the Philippines urged NTUC to intervene as well. Our labour movement stayed clear of the case, not because we were not humane but because we believed that it was a matter that should be dealt with between two governments, as it involved the judicial process. However, more importantly, it was also not a labour dispute. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1159</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Philippines and Singapore are both members of ASEAN. As such, I would imagine that the channels of communications should always be open. President Ramos was (and I hope still is) on good terms with our President of Singapore, our Prime Minister and our Senior Minister. Given such open lines of communications, how could relations between the two sides have deteriorated so rapidly - to the extent that President Ramos even threatened to cut off diplomatic ties with Singapore if a commission he set up found that there had been a miscarriage of justice? Did the Philippines make use of the open channels, or was Singapore used as a convenient punching bag for domestic considerations? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret that the Commission turned out to be more interested in theatre than truth. Here are some bizarre claims accepted by the Commission. Flor Contemplacion was forced by prison personnel to lie inside a coffin lined with dry ice; she was tortured by prison staff by electricity conducted to her body through a basin of water; she was drugged each time she was due to appear before a court; she was raped and shouted at; and it was the father of Nicholas Huang who killed Della Maga, and not Flor. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just the people in Singapore who find it hard to believe the way the Commission had conducted itself. The former Philippine Foreign Secretary, Mr Roberto Romulo, had this to say of the Gancayco Commission and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... it is a body that represents the workings of a government at its most bizarre, a government gone berserk ... The Gancayco Commission arrived at its conclusions and recommendations not with facts but with opinions fuelled by public and personal emotion.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure I speak for workers when I say that we feel deeply outraged when our flag was burnt in the cities of the Philippines and used as a doormat at a police post. But what made matters worse was when the Philippine government castigated our Embassy in Manila for protesting over the flag burning! What would have happened if we had reacted in the same frenzied manner as the Filipinos? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now if I may draw the attention of the House to a report in the Straits Times \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1160</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> dated 23rd May 1995. It is about a Philippine court sentencing a Singaporean to life imprisonment for posing as a job recruiter and duping six Filipinos into giving him money for jobs in Taiwan. What if we had chosen to march up to the Philippine Embassy to protest against the sentence? What if we had demanded to know whether the Singaporean was being given life sentence as a tit-for-tat for executing Flor Contemplacion? What if we had burnt the Philippine flag? Would the Philippines have shrugged it off and say, \"Well, since we have exercised our democratic right to burn the Singapore flag, we should not object to Singaporeans exercising the same democratic right to do what they wish with our flag.\" I leave it to Members of this House to reflect on how the Philippine government, the Manila media and the Filipino people would react, if we had mounted demonstrations against the Philippine judiciary system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me return to the motion. Amidst the anti-Singapore hysteria, fanned by the Manila media, an effort was made to reconcile the different findings of the autopsy - one conducted soon after Della Maga was killed, and the other four years later. It proved inconclusive. Whilst this was to be expected, I nevertheless abhor the offensive remarks made against the integrity of our pathologists and the American forensic experts who accompanied our team to Manila. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, another autopsy would be conducted - this time in the United States, and by a team mutually chosen by the Philippines and Singapore. We should not prejudge the outcome. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Ramos has said that if an independent body were to support Singapore's autopsy findings, then the Philippines should accept that its sense of outrage had been misplaced. And Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has pledged to reopen the case if the findings were against us. So be it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I am concerned, Flor Contemplacion had been given a fair hearing - not once, but twice. If there had been a shred of evidence to cast doubt on the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1161</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> prosecution case, how come there had been silence for four years - until just before she was due to be executed? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calls for a stay of execution (even for clemency) are not uncommon. I am sure that, where there are compelling reasons, the Cabinet would accede to a request for a stay of execution. Perhaps, the Government could enlighten the House on the circumstances that led to the downgrading of diplomatic relations between two ASEAN members - not long after President Ong Teng Cheong paid a state visit to the Philippines. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What had gone wrong? From media reports, it would appear that President Ramos sent two letters of appeal to President Ong. Perhaps, the Government should disclose in full the contents of these two letters, and our response. Again, going by media reports, President Ramos said there was a Filipina woman who had \"evidence\" that Flor Contemplacion was not the killer. This woman used to work in Singapore as a maid. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was another Filipina who also claimed to have \"evidence\" of Flor's \"innocence\". This Filipina had spent time in Changi Prison where she claimed she came to know Flor. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If indeed these women believed they had \"evidence\" that could save Flor's life, why did they remain silent for four long years? Why did they raise the \"evidence\" only at this later stage? Who prompted them to come to Singapore? Who had paid their air-fares? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the moment the women suddenly turned up in Singapore, we should have sensed that something was afoot. What did we do? We promptly dispatched the two women back to Manila and issued a statement, couched in bureaucratic language, dismissing their claims. We then proceeded to carry out the execution with clockwork precision, seemingly uncaring of the feelings of our close neighbours. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it have hurt us if we had delayed the execution? The least we could have \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1162</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> done was to have taken a bit of time to look at the \"new evidence\", and not dismiss it out of hand. Should we not have allowed the women to stay a bit longer, so that we could convene an inquiry, and determine the truth? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were we suitably informed of the impending elections in the Philippines? Were we appraised of the possibility that Flor Contemplacion's hanging could be made into a political issue, jeopardising the interests of Singapore and the safety of Singaporeans in the Philippines? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that we should in any way compromise our judicial process, but a delay could not have severely affected it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was our Government taken aback by the developments that followed Flor's execution? But then, according to the Far Eastern Economic Review, 30th March issue, President Ramos himself was shocked when he returned from Europe to find demonstrators blaming his administration for failing to save Flor. If he was indeed shocked, could he have used the right tone in his messages to President Ong? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me turn to the second limb of my motion. It is crucial that the Parliament of Singapore reaffirm our confidence in our criminal justice system, which had come under unwarranted attack by the Philippines over the Flor Contemplacion affair. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our criminal justice system is patterned after that of Britain, although we had made changes to suit our conditions. For example, we have done away with the jury system. But our courts observe scrupulously the rules on admissibility of evidence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Flor Contemplacion, she was convicted of double murder after the court heard evidence of how the police tracked her down, following the murder of Della Maga and Nicholas Huang. In a police statement, admitted by the court, Flor described how she killed Della and Nicholas. In her trial, she declined to give evidence. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1163</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From whatever angle we look at this case, it is obvious that Flor had a fair trial. She was represented by counsel in both trials. So it was wrong of the Philippines to question the integrity of our courts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, in their anxiety to \"prove\" Flor's \"innocence\", some elements in the Philippines had gone too far. They even sought to blame the Senior Minister for ordering the execution of the maid, and cast aspersion on the father of Nicholas Huang. Why have we kept quiet in the face of such provocations? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not my intention to stir up feelings against Filipinos, especially those who have chosen to work in Singapore. But the Flor Contemplacion case should remind us not to depend too much on foreign labour. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that soon after Flor's execution, President Ramos banned Filipinas from taking up jobs as maids in Singapore. The Philippines even sent military aircraft to pick up Filipina maids who wished to go home. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a subsequent statement, President Ramos noted that Filipinas have been flying to Singapore as tourists, but ending up doing work as maids here. He appeared to be philosophical about this turn of events. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do need foreign labour. But is it not better for employers to automate in a big way, so that they could do with fewer workers? This would mean a cutback on foreign workers. As far as home help is concerned, should we not be investing in more childcare centres and home-cleaning services? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, I am sure the economies of our neighbouring countries will improve. Then workers from these countries will find it less attractive to take up jobs in Singapore. So we have to brace ourselves for the day when it would be increasingly difficult to get foreign labour. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the elections are over in the Philippines, I feel that it is a matter of time before relations between our two countries will be back to normal. Meanwhile, we should give ourselves a pat on our back for the way we, as Singaporeans, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1164</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> with a few exceptions, of course, stood up as one united people in the face of a crisis not of our making. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

This event has received widespread coverage in the media in Singapore, and of course much more extensively overseas, and most surely in the Philippines. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, first let me say that many Singaporeans are surprised that this House is debating this motion. As has been stated by Mr Abdullah Tarmugi, Acting Minister for Community Development, Singaporeans in general believe that there has been no miscarriage of justice and have supported the Government in its management of these events. If there is any criticism, it is that the Singapore Government has been too patient and accommodating. A personal view is that the Government has been patiently and objectively rebutting each criticism and allegation as the Government wants to preserve the spirit of ASEAN, and believes in maintaining good relationships between nations. This, in my opinion, is a correct and prudent approach at a time when emotions are riding high. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first part of the motion refers to the issue of the \"stay of execution\". Would a stay of execution have prevented the \"present strain in Singapore-Philippine relations\"? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we watch the saga of events unfurl in the Philippines, I seriously doubt whether it would have made any difference. Even before the execution, demonstrations against Singapore \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1165</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> started. The proclamation that Ms Contemplacion is a \"national heroine\" and the outburst of fury and anger resulting in the burning of our National Flag, show the very emotional reaction of a nation. Remember, the President's wife also received the cortege at the airport. The attempt to infuse objectivity into the case through the involvement of forensic pathologists from Singapore, the United States and the Philippines has also failed thus far. The findings of the Commission of Inquiry in the Philippines are alarming. The conclusion is that Ms Contemplacion has suffered injustice in Singapore. Other absurd findings have already been mentioned by the speaker before me. The belief of the movers of the motion that a \"stay of execution\" could prevent the \"present strain\" in the Singapore-Philippine relations is pure conjecture and, in my view, naive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important question to ask ourselves is whether there was any legal argument to warrant a stay of execution. If there was, then it would be justified to grant the stay of execution. The legal system must not be tampered with for purely political reason such as is put forth in this motion. Herein lies the time-held tradition of separation of powers between the Executive arm of State and the Judiciary. I will not take up the valuable time of this House by presenting the facts of this case as I am sure that the Ministers in charge of the case will give all the details. It leaves me only to say that there was no valid legal reason for a stay of execution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarise very quickly, let us recollect the facts. Throughout the two years of court hearings, until about eight days before the execution, there was no issue raised. When did the new witnesses appear? One week, and subsequently just hours before the execution, two new witnesses appeared. Nevertheless, the police investigated these allegations and found them to be obviously false. Do we want our police to be less efficient and work more slowly so that we can delay the execution? I am sure this can be arranged. But that is just not our style of working. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1166</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the motion asks this House to \"reaffirm\" its confidence in Singapore's criminal justice system. Here, Mr Speaker, I would like to clarify my interpretation of this motion. We need to reaffirm not because there is any doubt in our mind, that is, in the majority of us in this House, that our criminal justice system is a sound and fair one. We have no doubts regarding the integrity of our judges. We have no doubts regarding the competence of our police. However, because of the scathing attack on our system by the various media, we need to reaffirm our system as a signal to these people that this House has indeed no doubts regarding our criminal justice system. The most scathing attack has been an article by William Safire and carried by the New York Times. The attack by Mr William Safire extends beyond our criminal justice system to the Singaporean society, our values and our political leaders. Some quotations from the article: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Referring to the treatment of Filipino maids in Singapore - it states: \"treated as little better than slaves by their Singaporean masters\". It is indeed paradoxical that an American is talking to us about slavery. Where did slavery start and end? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Referring to the criminal justice system, it states: \"she was jailed, confessed - perhaps under torture - and her country's embassy did little on her behalf. Just another maid, who cared?\" He could not even get the order right. She \"confessed\" first, then she was \"jailed\". She was not jailed before she confessed. That is important, because ours is a system which is well entrenched. The torture that they were talking about - electrocorticogram - was ordered by her own doctors to show her innocence and these are electrodes placed around the brain which are very similar to the electrocardiogram that we do for our cardiac tracings. These are tracings of the brain waves. They cause no pain. They cause no electric shocks. Maybe the author ought to go and try this himself and know that one does not get electric shocks from having ECGs done. That the Embassy did nothing? The Embassy staff was there \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1167</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> when the police confessions were made and she was visited nine times at least by the Philippine Embassy staff. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Referring to our political system, it states: \"the dictator's front man, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, realised this had caused a rift between two members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations.\" This is the ultimate insult to our system and to our leaders that our Prime Minister is called a front man, as in the American mafia. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Safire has also made reference to the Michael Fay case. There he also showed total disregard for his own countrymen. Referring to the caning of Michael Fay for vandalism, he accused the local US business community of \"sucking up to the dictator\". Mr Speaker, I hope you will excuse me for this unparliamentary language. The dictator, of course, is our Senior Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Philippines, the fact-finding commission appointed by the Government concluded that Ms Contemplacion has suffered injustice in Singapore. What is the truth? The truth is that she was accorded all rights available to any person charged in Singapore. Two lawyers were assigned by the Supreme Court Registrar to defend her initially for her trial in January 1993. When notice of appeal was given, another two lawyers were appointed to defend her. No legal rights were denied to her. Our Government also made available to the Commission of Inquiry in the Philippines all documents relevant to the case. This did not seem to have helped them in their deliberations. And yet the SDP, in the press statement of 23rd March 1995, suggested that a Commission should be set up by both countries to facilitate an exchange of views. Perhaps, Members of the SDP would like to explain what they meant by this. In addition, the SDP also called on our Government \"to exercise greater political and diplomatic tact when it comes to making comments about our neighbours in the international community.\" This press statement was issued on 23rd March this year at a time when emotion was riding high. Here you will really question why the SDP issued this \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1168</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> statement at that time and asked for a commission to be set up by both countries to facilitate an exchange of views and facts. It also stated that the \"SDP stands ready to assist in any way it can to help to resolve this position\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we appoint a Commission of Inquiry, it is taken in all seriousness. Persons with experience, integrity and objectivity are appointed. The findings are often treated very seriously by our Government. Here we have a case in which the credibility of the Commission of Inquiry, even in the Philippines, is being questioned. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to conclude, Singaporeans can stand tall and proud. An execution is not something anyone will celebrate about. In this case of Flor Contemplacion, the due process of our criminal justice system has been adhered to. There has been no miscarriage of justice. We have a criminal justice system that we can all be proud of. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us remind ourselves that two persons were murdered - another Filipino maid and a very innocent Singapore child. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1168</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down on the Order Paper for today be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1168</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EXECUTION OF FLOR CONTEMPLACION</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, after more than two months of stormy disturbance over the Flor Contemplacion case, and with the Philippine elections being over, the dust had more or less settled down.

From March until now, grassroots leaders and members of the public have contributed 84 inputs, out of which 75 or 89.2%, endorsed or supported the Government's stand on this matter. There was only one against (1.2%) and the stand of the other 8 (9.5%) was not clear. In late April, the Feedback Unit also conducted a straw poll on 100 regular feedback contributors. Two questions were posed: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Do you support the Government's rebuttal of the Philippine Commission's report? Almost all of them, that is, 98% of the respondents had given an affirmative answer in support of the Government's rebuttal. Only 2% made no comment. These respondents had given three reasons for their support: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) They felt that the Government is in the right and has to tell the truth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) They felt that the allegations made by the Philippine Commission were groundless and could not be substantiated. Furthermore, the manner in which this Commission conducted its investigation was not professional. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The respondents had affirmed their confidence in our judiciary system. They believed that our Police had done a thorough and proper investigation into the matter and the report of our pathologists was credible and backed by the American experts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What is your impression of the Government's handling of the issue? All the 100 respondents also gave an affirmative answer. They felt that the Government had handled the matter properly. They appreciated the difficult position of the Government, in view of the irrational and emotionally-charged situation in the Philippines. They also endorsed and confirmed the Government's cool and level-headed approach in dealing with such unreasonable allegations made by the other side. But among those who supported the Government's \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1170</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> stand and handling of the matter, one-third of them felt that, with the benefit of hindsight, the Government could have acceded to President Ramos' request to delay the execution of Flor Contemplacion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past two months, the 84 grassroots leaders who have given feedback to the Feedback Unit also asked the same question: Why did the Government turn down the request of President Ramos? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past three years since May 1992, there have been 13 surveys conducted by the Feedback Unit on issues ranging from NMPs, allocation of Telecom shares, the Michael Fay case, and the Ministers' salaries. None of these surveys conducted in the past received such an overwhelming support of 98%, as in this case. I am very glad with the result of this survey and with the response of the grassroots leaders, members of the public, and the readers who wrote to the newspapers. Among these people, there may be some who are unhappy or critical of certain Government policies. But when it comes to a major issue that concerns the dignity and national interest, they are united. They give strong and full support to the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two features in the Feedback Unit's poll which are particularly relevant to the motion before this House today: Firstly, one-third of the respondents, having the benefit of hindsight, came to the view that the Government could have acceded to President Ramos' request to delay the execution of Flor Contemplacion. Secondly, most of the respondents have expressed confidence in our judicial system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first point, the motion gives the Government an opportunity to explain to one-third of the respondents and others who hold the same view, the reason why the Government at that time could not accede to the request of President Ramos. I would like to stress that among these people, many of them acknowledged that, with the benefit of hindsight, that is, only after tension has developed between the two countries, they only come to this view. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1171</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now when I heard Dr Soin presenting her argument, I have a further understanding of the Chinese saying: \" \". After the event, everybody becomes wiser, everybody becomes Zhu Ge Liang (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). But before the event, nobody could anticipate the development. How many people, including the Filipinos, expected that the murder of a Filipino maid and the son of her employer by another Filipino maid would be politicised and emotionalized to such an extent, four years after the trial and conviction of the accused, and after the petition by her President for clemency was turned down by our Government, and she was eventually hanged? Perhaps from this incident, Singaporeans can learn one lesson, that is, we are a small and vulnerable nation. Therefore, the people and the Government should be united together to cope with a sudden change of situation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the motion is about the confidence in our judicial system. This is something we should express our unanimous support. On 10th April, the Straits Times published the report of the Philippine Commission. On the same day, the Singapore Democratic Party issued a statement, which was carried in the Straits Times, on 11th April, stating \"Our nation and its system has come under close scrutiny. Indeed, it seems that Singapore has been put on trial. It is thus crucial that Singapore clears up any discrepancy found and question raised about this case.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the Workers' Party also issued a statement suggesting \"Refer the Report of the Philippine Commission to the World Court, or to a tribunal of jurists from Commonwealth countries to investigate the allegations that there might have been a miscarriage of justice in the prosecution of Ms Flor Contemplacion.\" In other words, the two statements by the two Opposition parties have insinuations or they hold the view that there was some doubt about our judicial system and the way our Police conducted its investigation. Such statements by the two Opposition parties could only add fuel to fire, to further complicate and emotionalise the issue. Such statements, on the one hand, gave the Philippine media \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1172</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and politicians ammunition to attack Singapore and make life difficult for President Ramos and, on the other hand, they misled the public with insinuations which cast doubts and aspersions on our judicial system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the two Opposition parties have said nothing and have not expressed their stand on the rebuttal of the Philippine Commission by the Singapore Government, or the statements of our forensic pathologists. They have also chosen to be blind to the description of the Philippine Commission that Singapore had \"ceased to be a humane society\", the Philippine media attack of Singapore being a \"Police State\" and Mr William Safire's insult to our judicial system in the New York Times. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time when the incident was making people very worried, the SDP and the Workers' Party issued such statements. What were their ulterior motives? Therefore, it is important that this House reaffirms the confidence in Singapore's criminal justice system so as to clarify the matter to the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to join in the debate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the first part of the motion. As regards the second part of the motion, I am certain that Flor Contemplacion was given a fair trial. In fact, I read in the papers that she was tried not once, but twice, and was allowed two appeals. She was also allowed to petition for clemency to the President, but that petition was refused. After Flor Contemplacion had exhausted all her remedies of appeal, the Government then proceeded to fix the execution date before the anti-Singapore hysteria in the Philippines arose. The date fixed for the hanging of Flor Contemplacion was 17th March 1995. It was quite obvious that the Government authorities fixed that date in complete ignorance of what was happening in the Philippines. I quote Mr Abdullah Tarmugi, Acting Minister for Community Development and Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We thought it was just a very straightforward case of one maid murdering another maid and therefore one maid has got to be punished.' \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1173</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> And he said further: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`And we really could not understand why this reaction came from the Filipinos. We did not expect it.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am surprised that the Government which professes always to be on the ball did not see the consequences of executing Flor Contemplacion on a date close to the Philippine elections. Did the officials in the Singapore Embassy in Manila give the Government proper feedback that there was an underlying seething problem in the Philippines due to the inability of the government there to provide jobs for its home citizens and that they have to seek lowly, humiliating jobs abroad? I think the Government has proven that it is not that skilful in relating to our neighbours. If it really had insights of our neighbours' character, especially the Filippinos who are so emotional and volatile, it would have set a longer date to hang Flor Contemplacion about 2 1/2 months later. Or at least the Government should have fixed the date for hanging at a later date when the elections in the Philippines have been held and all the election fervour has blown over. After all, the Flor Contemplacion case arose in 1991 and it was a four-year matter. So a delay of another 2 1/2 months would not make any difference to the Government. I say that the Government handled the timing of the execution of Flor Contemplacion very badly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the issue of the Government refusing to accommodate President Fidel Ramos' request to postpone the hanging of Flor Contemplacion is a different matter. The Opposition has to be clear in its mind that this is an international matter. It is not a case of the Opposition in Singapore against the Government on a domestic issue. This is a matter between Singapore and a foreign country, in this instance, the Philippines. The Opposition, being loyal to the country, must side our country. I would, therefore, not condemn the Singapore Government for turning down President Ramos' request to delay the hanging of Flor Contemplacion by two weeks. I would not allow the foreign press to use the Opposition as a club to hit at our Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1174</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear! \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> All Singaporeans, whether they are supporters of the ruling party or the Opposition, have to be loyal to Singapore and when there is a dispute with a foreign country, they must close ranks with the ruling party and all Singaporeans and stand united. This is the message that Singaporeans must give to all the people of other countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I must clarify that I am not pro-PAP. I am pro-Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Batok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this motion before us allows this House and all Singaporeans the opportunity to clarify the issues, and put the case in perspective. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Sir, I want to thank Mr Chiam for being pro-Singapore. I think he speaks well for the development of democracy and the growth of a responsible Opposition as represented by Mr Chiam. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one should ever doubt that Contemplacion received a fair trial. Contemplacion voluntarily admitted to having convicted both murders in her statements made to the Police in the presence of Mrs Aurora Navarro, a Labour Officer in the Philippine Embassy. From the time of her arrest by the Police until her petition for clemency to the President, about four years later, Contemplacion did not deny to anyone that she killed Mrs Della Maga and Nicholas Huang. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, while awaiting trial, she was visited nine times by Philippine Embassy officials and 68 times by a nun, Sister Gerard, from the Convent of the Good Shepherd. She had indeed every opportunity to disclaim responsibility, but she did not. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case was first heard in the High Court, then the Court of Appeal directed the High Court to hear the case again and to review any new evidence and, finally, the case was heard again in the Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court assigned two sets of lawyers to defend Contemplacion in the hearings in both the High Court and Court of Appeal. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1175</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by any yardstick, there was due process of law. Contemplacion was given every opportunity to be heard over a period of time. There is no doubt whatsoever that it was a fair and just trial. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who doubt our system of justice, I like to refer them to Professor Harald Otto Schweizer, Professor of Criminal Justice at the University of Oklahoma, who came to Singapore in July 1994 to investigate the Michael Fay incident. He then wrote a letter to President Bill Clinton, stating categorically that accusations that Fay was forced to plead guilty were completely unfounded, as Fay had legal advice and a lawyer was present when he pleaded guilty. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Schweizer went on to say, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`After a long dose of police reality here in the United States, and after visiting numerous police agencies in Latin America and Europe, I would rather be investigated by the Singapore Police Force than any agency here (in the US).' \n  <br>\n  <br>He further stated that the top leadership of the Singapore Police Force made a \"far better impression\" on him than most municipal law enforcement agencies in the US. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So those who support the Philippine Gancayco Commission, which has assigned itself the task of judging our system of justice, would also do well to heed what the former Philippine Foreign Secretary, Mr Roberto Romulo, had to say. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Romulo stated that the Gancayco Commission is \"a body that represents the workings of government at its most bizarre, of government gone berserk.\" Mr Romulo's remarks were endorsed fully by none other than the President of the Philippine Senate, Mr Edgardo Angara. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Romulo further elaborated, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Gancayco Commission is an egregious example of a creature of government that is unable to understand measures and standards, that is quick to come to judgements, conclusions and decisions, on the basis of unproven assumptions, that is incapable of distinguishing between truth and falsehood, and between the honest and the charlatan. Once they heard what they wanted to hear, they accepted it as incontrovertible fact. Moreover, the success and future \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1176</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of our nation are directly threatened by an over-indulgence in politics. Politics that play to the emotions and whip up a frenzy, politics that call for the perverse exercise of power, and politics that mistake partisan political objectives for those of the nation.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's Opposition parties should listen to the wise counsel of Mr Romulo. We, in Singapore, should avoid the politics of frenzy, and avoid subjecting our own national interests to partisan politics. If there is anything we can learn from this episode, it is that we should not be ruled by emotions, but live by the rule of law. This, Sir, in a nutshell, is what it is all about. We should not run around like some Opposition parties, shouting that we have done this or that wrongly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam said that we should know and predict the reactions in the Philippines. But I can tell Mr Chiam that historians will testify, time and again, that it is always easy to be wise after the event, to say that we should do this, or we should do that, or we should not do this, or we should not do that. Even in our routine day-to-day life, we sometimes agonize, after the event, that we should have bought, or sold, a piece of property or bought or sold the shares in time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is, in this case, no one knew it would blow up, or be blown up to such a big issue. Even the Philippine diplomats and officials did not expect such reactions. President Ramos himself was surprised by the turn of event upon his return from overseas. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Philippine officials themselves did not know, how do you expect us, as outsiders, to know? Instead of criticising our own Government and officials, I think we should be proud of them. We should commend them for keeping cool in the most difficult of times, commend them for their exemplary restraint, commend them for their measured response, commend them for being unruffled and unprovoked, despite all the brickbats and rubbish thrown at them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, throughout the ordeal, the Government is clearly a paragon of patience and forbearance. How many governments, I ask you, would send their pathologists to a foreign land to face a hostile crowd? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1177</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than criticise our own Government and officials, we should applaud them, defend them and rally around them. Instead, some Opposition parties, except Mr Chiam, cast doubts, signalling that we are divided internally at a critical time in our relationship. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been pointed out endlessly that we should consider the feelings of foreigners in such a case, and understand their culture. Yes, we should. But should they also not consider the feelings of Singaporeans? Should they also not attempt to understand our culture? What about the feelings of the parents and grandparents of the murdered Nicholas Huang? Should they also not attempt to understand our system of justice? Should they also not respect our laws? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we go to a foreign country, we would respect and abide by the laws of the country, ever mindful that we are guests in a foreign land. When foreigners come to Singapore to work, or to reside, is it too much to ask them to do the same and abide by our laws? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must bear in mind that we have 300,000-plus foreign workers here. If they do not abide by our laws, it will become terribly unmanageable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of Filipinos were also executed in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East for criminal offences recently. But why no howl of protest? There was no hue and cry because all know that such protests would come to nothing. Why then such a storm against Singapore? Is it because they think we can be easily pushed or bullied? Or that we would submit to mass hysteria or succumb to pressure? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows all the more that we have to draw the line somewhere. It would be better to draw it now clearly for all to see, than be sorry later. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we not have stayed the execution by a number of days or weeks? The question has always been asked. By natural instinct, one is tempted to say why not. It would give Contemplacion a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1178</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> reprieve. It would give President Ramos face and political mileage. It would be a nice thing to do. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But is it proper or wise for us to do so and take the easy way out? I think not. It would backfire on us in the long run. Consider that there are so many foreign condemned prisoners on the death row. Every time a foreign criminal is scheduled to be hanged, there will be an appeal by a foreign President or Prime Minister. Should we just back down and delay indefinitely the execution? If we acquiesce, there will be no end to the matter. What if there is another appeal when the execution is rescheduled later? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter is even more touchy and sensitive if and when it involves our immediate and closer neighbours. What should we do then? Should we vary the standards for different nationalities? Does it mean that foreigners enjoy more rights and privileges than our very own Singapore citizens in our own land? Or should we have just one system of justice for all, Singaporeans and foreigners alike? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you think through, it would be better to stick to one system and make it abundantly clear to one and all that this is our system of justice in our own country. All should respect and abide by it. We have to draw the line. Otherwise, our resources will be severely tested, again and again. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge this House, therefore, to support the Government and reaffirm our confidence in Singapore's system of justice. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>4.00 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Braddell Heights)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to put it in a nutshell, the Flor Contemplacion incident is nothing but a political farce. It is a game created by the mass media and the politicians of the Philippines. After the elections of the Philippines on 8th May, the dust has settled down and this fact has become even more apparent. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1179</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the victim of this political farce, the former Foreign Secretary Romulo, was finally driven beyond the limits of forbearance and came out to openly criticize his government for the extremely ridiculous, even to the extent of being beserk, approach to the matter. From this farce that took place in the Philippines, our people of Singapore can see how party politics, that is, political activities based purely on party interest, can stir up a storm. Together with an irresponsible mass media which went to the extent of distorting the facts and creating false stories to mislead the public, their behaviour will not only cause damage to their own country but will also undermine their relationship with other countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder some authoritative international organisations and risk-evaluation agencies immediately adjusted upwards the risk factor of investing in the Philippines, after the incident. I believe it will surely be more difficult for the Philippines to attract foreign investments now than before the incident. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the former Foreign Secretary of the Philippines, Mr Romulo, pointed out that the efforts made by the Philippines over the past few years have gone to nought within a short period of two months. We learn a painful lesson from this farce, that is, we cannot allow opportunistic politicians to foul up our political scene, and we should never allow the irresponsible mass media to distort the truth and facts and to mislead the public with untrue tales. Eloquent politicians may be able to incite the sentiments of the public, and the mass media also have their own influence. But if the mass media hide under the cover of freedom of the press and make no distinction between right and wrong and do not report the truth, then the country will not progress, the economy will not develop and the livelihood of the people will not improve. As a result, Filipina maids will continue to go into an exodus overseas to look for jobs as domestic maids. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I believe that in handling this incident, the Singapore Government is right in adopting a very \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1180</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> calm, firm and restraint attitude. In this incident, the people of Singapore on the whole have also expressed their rationality and maturity, although I feel that our self-restraint may, to a certain degree, be misinterpreted as a sign of weakness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as it is said, only in times of crisis can we see the real sign of patriotism and loyalty. From this storm, we are also able to see the true colours of some Members of the Opposition parties in Singapore. The SDP and the Workers' Party have made statements on this incident. But we note that what they were discussing were not the question of right or wrong, or the facts and evidence in the Flor Contemplacion case. The spearhead of SDP's criticism is directed at the People's Action Party. They alleged that the PAP had passed random remarks at other countries. The Workers' Party's statement gave me the impression that they were hinting that there was miscarriage of justice in our judicial system. The Workers' Party's statement also pointed out that our entire judicial system was on trial. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rising emotions in the Philippines, our two local Opposition parties issued such statements. What is their ulterior motive? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as the Chinese saying goes: \"Sima Zhao zhi xin, luren jie zhi ye (the villain's design is obvious)\". Why did they not go by the facts of the case when making their statement, ie, whether or not Flor Contemplacion was given a fair trial, unjustly convicted and wrongly executed? What about the irrational behaviour of the people in the Philippines, such as the burning of the Singapore national flag and injuring the dignity of Singapore? Why was it that these two political parties were completely silent on such beserk behaviour? Were they helping Singapore or were they anti-Singapore? Do they have the interest of Singapore at heart, or are they merely trying to cash in on the opportunity to earn political capital? I think this is a big question mark in the minds of our people. The SDP and the Workers' Party should clarify. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1181</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the speeches of my colleagues in this House, I notice that they have unanimously endorsed the integrity of our judicial system. That it is fair and just is beyond doubt, especially in the case of Flor Contemplacion. What is the stand of the Opposition parties on this issue? I would like to know what is their stand, especially the Opposition Members who are sitting here, on this point. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Mr Chiam See Tong has already expressed his stand and he was on the side of Singapore, although he also indicated that he was on the side of reason and not affinity. But does his stand represent that of the SDP? I do not think it is possible! Then, what is the stand of the SDP? I hope to be able to hear from the other two Members of the Singapore Democratic Party in this House on their stand. Unfortunately, they are not here now. However, I understand that this debate will go on until tomorrow and I hope that these two other Members will not miss the precious opportunity to state clearly their stand on the issue. Of course, I also hope that the Workers' Party Member in this House will also let us know clearly the stand of the Workers' Party on this matter. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this whole issue is clouded with emotion in the Philippines. And in Singapore, as has been said by speakers before, we have tried to take a pragmatic and logical view. Unfortunately, it is very hard to talk in a logical and cool fashion to people who are not listening. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three major issues, I think, that are raised by this motion. The first issue is the question of whether Flor Contemplacion actually had a fair trial. Anyone who reads the court records, who reads the information provided by the Government, who reads the reports of the forensic scientists, including American forensic scientists, must come to the conclusion that Flor Contemplacion had every protection that a civilised system of law can provide to an accused person. Only those whose ears are deliberately stopped could come to the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1182</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> fantasy conclusion, like the Gancayco Commission has, that she was a victim of injustice. The Gancayco Commission has displayed a distressing lack of professional competence and integrity. But we cannot help that. I do not think any Singaporean seriously believes that Contemplacion was framed by the Singapore police, was judicially murdered by the Singapore judges, was tortured by the prison authorities. There is no logical reason why the judges, the police, the prison authorities and the Philippine Embassy should conspire to fix Contemplacion. There is no logical basis for a conclusion like that. But people will believe what they want to believe and there is nothing we say in this House that will convince Filipinos who believe the other side. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the issue of the integrity of our judicial system is concerned, I think we need not be unduly concerned. I think any thinking person, even those who are not our friends in the Western press, must conclude that there has been no miscarriage of justice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second major issue that is raised by this motion is: was the matter handled properly, in a diplomatic sense? It is very easy to be wise after the events. It is very easy to say, had we done this or had we done that, things would have been better. Like Dr Arthur Beng, I do not think that a stay would have made very much difference because really this is not a matter of Singapore politics or Singapore system. It is a matter of Filipino politics. People in that country needed something to beat President Ramos with and we just happened to be handy. We are small. We do not make noise. We do not call other people names. We often are the targets because we are a soft target for politicians in other countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should there have been a stay? As Dr Ong Chit Chung has said, one's inclination is to say, \"What harm could have been done?\" I think that perhaps a stay might have been useful, but not to mollify the Filipinos. It is for a different reason, which brings me to the third major issue that is raised by this motion, the question of whether our system can be improved or \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1183</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> not. I think we laid ourselves open to criticism, in the sense that we gave the impression that we prize efficiency over justice. It is true that nothing that was brought up in the Philippines would have induced any rational judge or any rational court to reopen the case. But the fact is that when somebody says there is new evidence, and you just dismiss it very quickly out of hand, the impression that people outside get is that really you just want to get the matter over with and justice is not on your mind. And in that sense, I think we laid ourselves open to criticism. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only aspect of this case that really troubles me is the point that was raised by Dr Soin in her admirable speech at the beginning of this debate, and that is the question of what happens when there is an allegation that new evidence has surfaced in a capital case. We have no procedure for this. The trouble with capital cases is that the tolerance for mistake is zero. \"Sorry\" is a very weak word to use if you hang somebody wrongly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New evidence is alleged to have come to the attention of the defence counsel. Who should assess this evidence? I trust the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I understand in this particular case, the assessment of the new evidence was undertaken by the Attorney-General's Chambers. I have no criticism of the Attorney-General or the Attorney-General's Chambers on their competence or ability to assess evidence. But my disquiet is whether they are in fact the right people to assess new evidence in a capital criminal case. The Attorney-General's Chambers is in charge of prosecutions. They have to build a case beyond reasonable doubt to get a person hanged. Now new evidence comes, and to ask that very same authority that has been trying to build this water-tight case to assess the credibility of the new evidence is like asking a proud chef to assess whether or not his prize winning cake is actually half-baked. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of assessment of new evidence is a judicial one. It is not an administrative one. May I suggest that it should not be undertaken by the police, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1184</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> who are the investigating authority, or by the Attorney-General's Chambers who are the prosecuting authority, or by the Cabinet who, I think, have much better things to do than function as a judicial tribunal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscarriages of justice have happened in other countries in cases that would have led to the death penalty in Singapore. I think we have been lucky that we have had no such miscarriages up to now, but we cannot count on luck to take us through forever. As Dr Soin pointed out, we should have some proper system for the assessment of evidence that is said to arise after the event. At the very least, it should be referred to a magistrate, not to the original investigating authority, and not to the prosecuting authority. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as this motion is concerned, I do not think it would be profitable for this House to point fingers at people and say how they could have done better or how they could have done worse. There is no use, nor is it any use for us to decry what has happened in the Philippines and to call them names, because that will not change anything. President Ramos is reported in today's papers as saying that Singapore and Philippine ties are on the mend. I think all of us welcome that. I believe he is sincere and of course it would be our hope that relations would get back on an even keel. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as this motion is concerned, however, I ask Members of the House to think very carefully about what we can do about our own legal system to ensure that in a capital case mistakes are not made, even if that makes the system less efficient. I think this is one area where we can tolerate a little bit of slowness, a little less efficiency, in the interest of ensuring that we get things 100% right. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, is the debate on this motion going to continue tomorrow or is it going to end today? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I am not aware. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1185</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>4.20 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law and Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Law and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, I wish to thank Members of the House for the various points that they have made. This is an important matter and the movers of the motion as well as the speakers who have taken the floor have raised points which, I believe, are in the minds of quite a number of Singaporeans. So it is good that we have this opportunity to debate them. I also wish to commend Mr Chiam See Tong for having taken a principled position even though he is a Member of an Opposition party, ie, a principled position of standing up for Singapore which I would like to see in other Members of the Opposition on such an issue. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The points that have been raised by Members have only confirmed one point - that this whole episode about Flor Contemplacion is quite a complicated issue. It involves many dimensions. There are many phases to this whole problem. There was the investigative phase where you have criticisms of the police investigation, whether we arrested the right person, whether the autopsy reports by the pathologists were properly done, and so on. There was the judicial phase. Did she have a fair trial? Were the courts right in dismissing the defence of diminished responsibility? Was she given access to counsel at all times, and so on? Then there was the Executive or Cabinet phase, ie, the phase where petition for clemency and the appeal for stay of execution have to be considered. There was the diplomatic phase after the execution and the problems we have in bilateral relations. Did we handle it properly? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For today, I intend to concentrate more on the Executive and the diplomatic phases because, although there were important points raised on the investigative and the judicial phases, my colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs, will deal with this when he takes the floor. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us recall, very briefly, the basis for the clemency petition and later the appeal for the stay of execution. When we talk of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1186</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the clemency petition, there was Flor Contemplacion's own clemency petition of January 1995. In that petition, she never stated that she did not do the crime. Then there was President Ramos' own letter to President Ong in January 1995, where he asked that clemency be considered \"on humanitarian grounds\". He said that \"I address this request on behalf of the parents, spouse and children of Mrs Contemplacion\". It is important that we recall what was the basis for the petition. It was on humanitarian grounds. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the legal procedures in Singapore, after all the final appeals are exhausted, it is mandatory for the Attorney-General and the Trial Judge to give their opinions as to whether the law should take its course. These are considered by Cabinet and Cabinet advises the President. The Attorney-General's view was that there was nothing in this case that recommends a clemency and the law should be allowed to take its course. The Trial Judge, in his report, also stated that he saw no reason why the sentence should not be carried out. President Ong, on the advice of Cabinet, replied to President Ramos on 23rd February that clemency was not granted on the advice of Cabinet. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the appeal for stay of execution. Here too, we need to remind ourselves what was the basis for the appeal. President Ramos' letter was dated 11th March and was delivered to the MFA duty office on 12th March. But I would like to point out, particularly in response to Dr Kanwaljit Soin, who said that in three or four days everything was done with, that the fact is that several days before that, officials from the Ministry of Home Affairs, Attorney-General's Chambers, the Police and the Foreign Affairs Ministry had already begun to examine and study the matter because the details of the so-called fresh evidence had been publicised in a Malacanang Palace statement on 9th March. That Palace statement had detailed this so-called fresh evidence claim and had also stated that President Ramos would be making an appeal. So we had already started studying the matter. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1187</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were the grounds for this appeal for stay of execution? President Ramos said that new evidence had come to light and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`new evidence bearing directly on this case has just come to light from another Filipino citizen, Mrs Emilia Frenilla. Mrs Frenilla used to work in Singapore, personally knows Mrs Contemplacion. Since Mrs Frenilla is willing to come forward with a testimony, and as we are dealing here with a human life, I request Your Excellency for a stay of execution to allow this new evidence proper consideration. This appeal is addressed to Your Excellency with full respect for the laws of Singapore on humanitarian grounds and on behalf of the parents, spouse and children of Mrs Contemplacion.' \n  <br>\n  <br>Of course, as the House knows, the request was not granted and she was executed on 17th March 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have listened to the views that have been expressed so far and also studied the terms of the motion. Basically, if I could sum up, I think the criticisms which have been made are two-fold. Firstly, the Government showed unseemly haste to execute her, giving the impression that proper consideration did not appear to be given to the request for stay of execution. Secondly, in any case, so the criticism goes, we should have anticipated all the consequences that unfolded. We should have anticipated the diplomatic fall-out and we should have given face to President Ramos. As Dr Kanwaljit Soin said, \"what is the harm? What is the cost? She could have been given a few weeks' delay.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with the first issue: that the Government was unseemly hasty to execute her and proper consideration did not seem to be given to the fresh evidence. The impression the critics have is that we treated this in a rather cavalier, nonchalant and bureaucratic fashion. What are the facts? Firstly, the moment we knew of the claims of fresh evidence, and this was even before the formal letter was received, both the Minister for Home Affairs and I personally discussed the issue. We decided that we would ask the Attorney-General's Chambers officials, CID, and officials from both Ministries to study the new evidence. Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon and Dr Kanwaljit Soin have made the point whether the law should be changed, but that is a separate issue \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1188</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> which the Minister for Home Affairs would deal with. But we have to deal with this issue according to the law and procedure which exist at the moment. That is exactly what we did. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided that if the Attorney-General and the officials needed more time to study the matter, we would recommend to Cabinet a stay of execution. If they felt that there was any plausible basis for these claims of fresh evidence, a plausible basis which requires much further investigation, we would also recommend a stay. However, we felt that if it was very clear that there was no basis whatsoever and it was totally untenable, then we would not recommend a stay of execution. Both of us also personally spoke to the Attorney-General because this was an important matter. As it turned out, the Attorney-General and all the other officials who were studying this issue did not require that much more time, for reasons which will be spelt out in detail by the Minister for Home Affairs, and which were already spelt out in our press statement. The claims of new evidence were totally unfounded. We both decided that we would recommend to the Cabinet that there were no grounds for stay of execution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But precisely because this was a matter of life and death and because President Ramos had appealed, as Minister for Law, I took two additional steps. On 13th March 1995, first thing in the morning, I rang up the Attorney-General. I asked him to confirm whether he had addressed the issue personally. He said yes. I then told him that our recommendation was being finalised to Cabinet and asked him whether he had any qualms at all about not granting a stay of execution. I told him that if he had any qualms, he should let me know, and that I did not want him and the Chambers to feel pressured on account of the time factor. If he needed more time, he should let me know and I could still halt the process. He told me that he had no qualms. He was satisfied that the so-called new evidence was completely spurious and without any basis. He told me that he might have had some second thoughts if at any stage during the many years of trial, Flor \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1189</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Contemplacion had even once said she did not do it. But she did not. And in fact she maintained that she did it and even described in detail how the crime had been carried out. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the afternoon of the same day, Monday, 13th March, I also asked to see Mr Errol Foenander, Head of Crime Section at Attorney-General's Chambers. He is an experienced legal officer with some 29 years of service and he was the officer in the AG's Chambers who had gone into the details of the matter with the investigators and the other officials. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recall that the House was then in session in the Committee of Supply. I was expecting the two Ministries under my charge to come up for debate. So I asked him to come and see me in one of the rooms in Parliament House. I went over with him in detail various aspects of Frenilla's affidavit, and he explained each point fully. I asked him if he had met with the Police investigator in charge of the case. He said yes. I asked him whether he had any doubts about the Police investigation. He had none. I told him I already had a word with the Attorney-General. But since Foenander had studied the matter carefully, I wanted to know if he had any reservations about the case. He had none. He explained to me why Frenilla's claims were totally unfounded. For example, and this is only one example, Frenilla had claimed in an affidavit that Flor's employer had fabricated the story that Flor had done the crime. But the fact was that the employer had no idea or knowledge of the existence of such a person called Flor Contemplacion. It was the Police investigations that led to Flor Contemplacion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, why am I recounting all these? It is to show that far from arbitrarily brushing aside the new evidence, far from it being put on some bureaucratic auto-pilot, the matter had been given careful and urgent attention, not just by officials, not just by the Attorney-General, but also by the Ministers who had to advise the Cabinet who in turn advised the President. As I \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1190</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> said, the Minister for Home Affairs will explain why this new evidence could not withstand scrutiny. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the Members here may accept what I have said about the process - that we took diligence in attending to it. But they may still hold the other criticism against us that, in any case, we should have granted a stay. What is the harm, what is the cost, as mentioned by some Members. Their view can be stated this way. We should have given face to an appeal from an ASEAN member. Nothing would have been lost. We should have known the elections were coming up on 8th May. We should have known that there would be a fall-out in bilateral relations. And if we had given a stay, all this strain in relations would not have taken place, which is the thrust of the first part of the motion, \"when a stay could have prevented the present strain in Singapore-Philippine relations.\" But actually there are several questions here. Firstly, did we know? Did we anticipate what is going to happen? In other words, did we know, could we have known, the full extent of the consequences and therefore, nevertheless, proceeded with it? Secondly, how is it that we did not anticipate or know? Was it a major blunder on the part of my Ministry? So let us go over the information which was available to us at the point of time when the decision was given. I think that is important - at the point of time the decision had to be taken. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point I would like to make is that the Philippine appeal for clemency or stay of execution did not suggest that it was due to a problem in the domestic front and did not suggest that it would affect bilateral relations. That is why I made it a point of recapitulating what was the basis for the stay and what was the basis for the clemency petition. We had no reason to conclude that they were appealing other than on compassionate grounds or other than on fresh evidence on the stay or petition. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to make is the President of Singapore visited the Philippines. And that visit ended on 19th February, just three weeks and four days before the execution. I accompanied the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1191</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> President and I wish to tell the House there were no demonstrations, there were no protests, there were no placards at any place where we stayed or en route to our destination either in Manila, Baguio or Cebu. The issue did not come up in talks with either President Ramos or anyone else. President Ramos did hand a note to President Ong, although it did not feature in the talks. During that visit I had separate bilateral talks with Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo. He had one issue to raise. I had one issue to raise on my side. But both issues did not concern Flor Contemplacion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That gives you an indication of how important or significant an issue this was at that time - three weeks and four days. So we did not receive, Mr Deputy Speaker, any signal during this visit that there was going to be serious trouble for President Ramos domestically or for bilateral relations if the law took its course. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr John De Payva asked whether we kept our lines of communication open. Yes. For example, on 3rd March, Foreign Secretary passed through Singapore just two weeks before the execution. He asked me to return his call. I called him on the telephone. He was on his way back to Manila. He said when he was back in Manila, the media was bound to interview him and he wanted to discuss with me the case and what he might say. I agreed, after discussion with him, that he could say that the decision on clemency had been taken at the highest level in Singapore and the law had to take its course. He did not give any intimation that the Philippine government was seriously perturbed about its impact on bilateral relations. Upon his arrival in Manila, he told the press and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Minister Jayakumar expressed to me his regrets. But the Cabinet reviewed the case and after giving it the highest consideration, there were no mitigating circumstances. So the judgment is now final and executory.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Philippines must comply with the regulations and the laws.' \n  <br>\n  <br>This is from the Philippine Journal, 4th March 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1192</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I like to make a point which was made by Dr Ong Chit Chung and Mr John De Payva. By all accounts, the Philippine leadership had also not anticipated the intense protests that ensued. Many in the Philippines, it would seem, were also surprised by the reactions in their country. No one foresaw this huge burst of emotion, probably not even those who had stirred it up. As the Asian Wall Street Journal, 31st March 1995, stated, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is obvious that neither government anticipated events spinning out of control.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr John De Payva referred to a Far Eastern Economic Review article. I believe he was referring to the 30th March 1995 article, page 12, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Philippines may have been in an uproar over Singapore's execution of Flor Contemplacion, but President Fidel Ramos didn't know it.' \n  <br>\n  <br>This is also what this article says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A close aide complains that during the president's trip to Europe, his staff is giving him \"sanitized\" reports on the widespread indignation over Singapore's hanging of the Filipina domestic helper. \"They were telling us that everything's okay in Manila, and that the backlash would be manageable.\"' \n  <br>\n  <br>The article goes on to say: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Ramos was shocked when he arrived home to find demonstrators blaming his administration for failing to save Contemplacion.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, according to these reports, the Philippine leaders were taken by surprise, the question is how could we have known much better than them? And I think it is fair to say that the facts were that some of the media there and some of the Opposition politicians had skilfully and quickly capitalised on this into an anti-government and anti-Ramos campaign, linking it at the same time with a broader emotional issue of their government's handling of millions of overseas Filipino workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back, had we known that we would provoke such an uproar, would we have still refused to delay the execution, as several Members have said? With hindsight, it is of course very easy to say that we should have known, we ought to have done this, and so on. To give a candid answer, yes, we could have conceivably \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1193</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> granted a stay till after the Philippine elections on 8th May. But to those who say there is no harm, no cost, let me say it would not have been without cost, and it would have been a very difficult decision. Why? On the one hand, firstly, we have no intention to get involved in their internal domestic politics. Secondly, we have very good bilateral relations and it was not our intention to jeopardise it. It was our intention to build on it. Thirdly, we have considerable investments in the Philippines. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we had to take into account certain other important factors. Firstly, we had to note that the agitation and the demonstrations in the Philippines were really not over the stay, not over whether we had given face, but over the grant of clemency. Those who were building up the excitement and agitation were really not interested in whether we were giving a stay. But they wanted a complete pardon for Flor Contemplacion because they were convinced that she was innocent. And we had to consider carefully the fact that if we granted a stay, it could be raising false hopes unjustifiably. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we had also to consider what would be the implications in view of the various security threats, bomb threats and threats to the life of various people in our Manila Mission. I do not want to go into the details but I should inform the House, and the House should know, that in the days before the Cabinet decision was taken, our Embassy was receiving several threats. Some of course can be dismissed as frivolous and hoax but not all. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will just take an entry from one of the logs in our logbook. Monday, 13th March, there were four threats. At 11.45 am, a man called to say that a bomb would explode that day. At \n  <br>11.50 am, a man claiming to be a member of a terrorist group, and I am leaving out the name of the so-called terrorist group, telephoned the Embassy's receptionist and said that all Filipino employees should get out of the Embassy by the time of the execution so that no Filipino employees of the Embassy would be hurt. At 11.53 am, a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1194</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> man claiming to be a member of the same terrorist group said that they were going to destroy the Ambassador's car. At 2.30 pm, a man called and said, \"In 30 minutes' time, please leave the Embassy.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Members should reflect: supposing we granted a stay in these circumstances? Would anyone really believe that we did it out of compassion and not because we had been cowed and intimidated? This question is worth reflecting. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another consideration, an important one, is whether we would be setting a most undesirable precedent for future similar cases. Let me explain. Firstly, if we agree to appeals for stay of execution or clemency for foreign offenders, when there are no grounds to do so on the merits of the case, or on the evidence of the case, is it not surely an invitation, in every other case, for a foreign national and his lawyers to pressurise his home government to intervene on his behalf? It must be. And the Singapore Government would be hard put not to yield if it had already established a precedent. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Members may not know this, but I should inform Members that we regularly receive petitions for clemency from various governments. Some are publicised and hit the headlines like in this case and in the case of the Dutch drug trafficker, Van Damme. But many do not hit the headlines because those governments prefer to do it in a quiet approach, in other words, quiet diplomacy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way that we handle petitions from different governments is important. We must be even-handed and fair and treat all petitions with respect and seriousness on the merits of the case. What we do for one we will have to do for another. We value our relations with ASEAN colleagues highly. But there cannot be one standard for ASEAN appeals and another standard for non-ASEAN appeals. Also, it is not tenable for us to accede to appeals which have been highly publicised and turn down appeals which are of the same merit but were turned down because they have not become media issues and contentious issues. To do so, in fact, you are penalising governments which have opted for the quiet diplomatic approach. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1195</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, if we make special concessions for foreign nationals, for reasons other than on the merits of the case, Members should consider what happens to our own Singapore nationals who are also sentenced to death, ie, our nationals who also have no basis on merits, on evidence, to warrant clemency or stay of execution. They do not have a foreign government to pressurise the Singapore Government. They do not have an irresponsible tabloid press to write up lurid, sensational, bizarre allegations. Is the solution then to also give them a stay of execution when there are really no grounds on merits to do so? Surely, that cannot be done. That is why I say that, even looking back, yes, we could have conceivably given a stay, but it would have been a close judgement call. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, let me say a few words about the diplomatic phase. Our objective during this diplomatic phase was really to manage the events in a way that did not lead to further deterioration in relations with the Philippine government. And this phase was marked by the following features. First, exercise of restraint. Second, cooperating with President Ramos and his government. Third, keeping lines of communication open. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, exercise of restraint. Members have already spoken and noted that we had exercised as much restraint despite many provocative articles. John De Payva asked, \"Why didn't we reply to this article about Senior Minister?\" In fact, the full article, if you read it, said Senior Minister was informed and his assistance obtained and he got Jayakumar and then the maid Flor Contemplacion was fixed. For those of us who had been reading every day the faxes of the many newspapers that were coming in, there were many, many wild and bizarre stories, and we decided to make a distinction between a tabloid press, media hype and make sure that we do not over-react to these absurd stories. They were so absurd and bizarre that no reasonable person would have given them much credence. But when reaction was called for, Members would agree that we gave a robust rebuttal. When the Gancayco Commission came out with the absurd allegations, we had to respond and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1196</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> respond we did in clear-cut terms. When the integrity of our pathologists and our United States consultants was attacked, we also had to come out rebutting the absurd allegations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we cooperated with President Ramos and his government. I will give you some examples. When the Gancayco Commission was established, I was in touch with the Foreign Secretary and I assured him full cooperation. We sent bundles of documents about the court proceedings, all the relevant exhibits, photographs, autopsy reports. We even offered to send the police investigator in charge of the case. If the Gancayco Commission wanted to interview him, he would be at their disposal. We had nothing to hide. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Ramos proposed that when their National Bureau of Investigation's autopsy, after the exhumation, differed from our autopsy report and that there should be a third party panel, we agreed. Later on, they wanted our pathologists to go and view the remains in Manila. Our preference had been to go to a neutral venue so that emotions would not be there. But we were asked, \"Please come.\". We agreed. We wanted to bring our consultants with our pathologists, but they said that they should not be British or Commonwealth. We agreed. When our consultants were going there, they asked our consultants not to speak at the joint press conference. We agreed. Then they wanted the FBI to be the authority to submit the names of the panel. So we have tried to understand the predicament of the government in that particular situation and our interest was to cooperate and distinguish our objective of cooperating with the Philippine government from the other circus that was being orchestrated by opposition politicians and the media. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, during this diplomatic phase, while we kept the channels of communication open and while the sound and fury of the media and opposition thundered on, many did not know it. But we kept open the lines of communication between the leaders. For example, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and President Ramos spoke on the telephone at least on four \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1197</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> occasions and had corresponded at least six times. Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo and I kept in regular touch with each other. We spoke on the telephone at least on 14 occasions. We corresponded, faxes to his office or to his home, and he was faxing things to my home or my office, at least about 20 times. We met in Bandung, not so long ago, and had three meetings. In other words, the Foreign Ministers were in almost daily communication during this delicate period. And, in fact, strange as it may seem, both Foreign Ministers were able to negotiate through the phone and fax and conclude a written agreement called Agreed Points on the steps to establish a third party panel. We concluded this agreement and we signed it on 29th April 1995, one day before Foreign Secretary Romulo stepped down. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not met the new Foreign Secretary Domingo Saizon personally, but we have already established contact because we have spoken to each other on the telephone. In other words, while we were having this delicate and trying period, the leaders tried to keep their cool. We were aware of the broader considerations in maintaining bilateral relations on an even keel. And both Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers played their role in trying to keep contact with each other so that we would not read the signals wrongly about government-to-government intentions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to brief the House quickly on the current developments in the diplomatic phase. In the Agreed Points between the two Foreign Ministers, we have agreed that since the first stage of examining the remains in Manila was inconclusive and there were still contradictory findings, both our Prime Minister and President Ramos had agreed to resolve this difference in the contradictory findings. And to resolve it conclusively, there shall be a third party panel. Both leaders agreed also to abide by the findings of the third party panel. The two Foreign Ministers worked out the Agreed Points that there will be a third party panel of three. In order to establish the three, we originally \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1198</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> approached FBI but FBI recommended the American Board of Pathologists who had in turn recommended seven names. In fact, I have already written to Foreign Secretary Domingo Saizon to say that Singapore is ready to proceed with the process of selecting three out of the seven. Hopefully, this will be done soon and the third party panel will get down to work. Under the Agreed Points, the remains of Della Maga will be sent to a neutral place, United States, and the final conclusive determination will be made by the third party panel. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarise, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I hope at the end of the debate and after you have heard my colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs, Members will be satisfied that all due attention, including the due full process of the law, was given to Flor Contemplacion. And I wish to stress that there was no indication at that time that the case would be so intensely involved in the internal politics of the Philippines and would blow up the way it did. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the job of the Government is to make decisions based on national interest. Maintaining law and order, apprehending offenders, prosecuting offenders, are part of our national interest. Maintaining friendly relations with foreign countries is also in the national interest. In the case of Flor Contemplacion, we have to balance, on the one hand, keeping relations between Singapore and the Philippines on an even keel and, on the other hand, upholding the integrity and transparency of our legal and judicial process. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not things would have turned out differently if our decision had been different, ie, allow a stay even though we felt there were no merits, I am afraid, is a matter of speculation. But it is unlikely that this will be the last such incident. I say it is unlikely because we have nearly seven million tourists every year. We have more than 300,000 work permit holders, including more than 80,000 domestic workers. Fortunately, the majority are law abiding. But, inevitably, some are not. Some commit offences. Due process of the law must follow. We cannot waive prosecution and grant clemency \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1199</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> only because the accused is a foreigner. That will mean double standards, one for foreigners and one for Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we enforce our laws, from time to time such problems will surface and indeed may be more serious than what we have encountered in this episode, and Singaporeans must be prepared for this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the government-to-government level, relations between Singapore and the Philippines remain cordial. We value our relations with the Philippines. We hold nothing against the Philippine government or the Philippine people. As I said, the leaders of the two governments and the Foreign Ministers are in close contact. In fact, Singapore and the Philippine delegations continue to work closely in ASEAN. But both sides must also strive to restore people-to-people relations, and restore it to what it was before the Flor Contemplacion case. And this is what President Ramos has also said and is reported in today's papers. We need to cool down emotions and restore mutual confidence. And businessmen, investors and tourists must feel completely assured that they are indeed welcome by the hosts and neither the persons nor the businesses will be threatened or, worse, endangered. Then only the flow of trade, investments and tourism will return to normal. This may take some time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to get this process of people-to-people relationship on the way, both governments should now proceed to appoint a third party panel of experts which both sides have agreed will resolve the contradiction in findings between the Philippine NBI experts and Singapore pathologists. This will determine whether Flor Contemplacion was a victim of grave injustice, as the Gancayco Commission \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1200</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> claimed, or whether she was properly convicted and sentenced for the murder of Della Maga, as our courts have found. Thereafter, as the two governments have agreed, if the neutral panel finds the Philippine NBI is correct, Singapore will reopen the Flor Contemplacion case. And if the panel finds that the Singapore pathologists are correct, then the Philippines will abide by this finding. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must not leave any lingering doubts over the death of Della Maga and the execution of Flor Contemplacion to poison relations, especially people-to-people relations between Singapore and the Philippines. This issue must be conclusively settled one way or the other. Only thus can we put the matter to rest permanently and achieve a full reconciliation between the people of Singapore and the people of the Philippines. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1200</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the Debate be now adjourned.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Dr Soin, debate to be resumed on what day? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Tomorrow, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Adjourned accordingly at Six\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Minutes past Five o'clock pm.\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1201</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>VALUE AND DISPOSAL OF HARD DRUGS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. \n  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs what is the value of hard drugs confiscated from drug dealers from the years 1985 to 1994 and how do the relevant authorities dispose of these drugs. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total value of heroin and other hard drugs seized from drug dealers from 1985 to 1994 is approximately $228 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the court trial is completed, the judge would order the disposal of the drugs seized.
