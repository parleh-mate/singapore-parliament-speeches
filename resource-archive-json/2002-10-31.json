Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nbelieve these two Questions are timely as they enable  me\r\n\r\nto  brief  the  House on the state of play since  I  last\r\n\r\nspoke  on this subject at the sitting on 23rd July  2002.\r\n\r\nThere  have been quite a number of developments and  much\r\n\r\nhas  been said.  I hope Members will bear with  me  as  I\r\n\r\ntake them through these developments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key developments have been:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Ministerial Meeting in Singapore from 2-3rd September 2002;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM Goh's meeting with PM Mahathir in Putrajaya on\r\n\r\n8th October 2002;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exchange of letters between PM Mahathir (7th October\r\n\r\n2002) and PM Goh (14th October 2002); and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior officials' meeting in JB from 16-17th October\r\n\r\n2002.\r\n\r\nI will touch on each of these developments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Second  Ministerial Meeting in Singapore, 2-3rd September 2002</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On <i>price revision of water under the current\r\n\r\nAgreements:</i>  In  July  2002 I  informed  the  House  that\r\n\r\nSingapore's  position is that the  1961  and  1962  Water\r\n\r\nAgreements  do  provide  for a  review  after  25  years.\r\n\r\nHowever, if Malaysia wanted a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprice  review, this should have been undertaken  in  1986\r\n\r\nand  1987.  Notwithstanding the fact that it is 15 to  16\r\n\r\nyears   late,  we  told  the  Malaysians  at  the   First\r\n\r\nMinisterial  Meeting  in  KL (1-2nd  July)  that  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of making progress in our package talks, we were\r\n\r\nprepared  to  consider Malaysia's request to discuss  the\r\n\r\nprice revision but as part of the package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the September Ministerial meeting in Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysians  presented a formula for pricing  current\r\n\r\nwater,  which  in  effect, was based  on  our  peg  price\r\n\r\nformula meant for future water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We asked them to justify this in relation to the\r\n\r\nspecific clauses in the two Agreements which set out very\r\n\r\nclearly  the factors and criteria.   They have not  given\r\n\r\nus  an answer.   They have also not given us an answer to\r\n\r\nour  question on which provision in the Water  Agreements\r\n\r\nauthorised their claim for retrospective application.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We reiterated our position that Johor should have\r\n\r\ninvoked  the  review clauses in 1986 and  1987  and  that\r\n\r\nJohor  has lost its right of review.  If Malaysia insists\r\n\r\non  a review outside the package, Singapore will have  to\r\n\r\nchallenge every aspect of Johor's claims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia insisted that Johor had not lost its right\r\n\r\nof  review  and  that  the matter of  price  revision  be\r\n\r\ndiscussed  between  both sides but not  as  part  of  the\r\n\r\nbilateral package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the supply of future water, Malaysia indicated\r\n\r\nthat \"the detailed discussions (on a new water agreement)\r\n\r\nshould  be undertaken two years before the expiry of  the\r\n\r\n<br><br>1962&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreement.\"  As Members know, for Singapore, a  key\r\n\r\nelement of the package is the long-term supply of  water.\r\n\r\nTo  say that we should talk about this issue only in 2059\r\n\r\nwas  not  realistic and showed that they were  not  being\r\n\r\nserious.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia also wanted to delink the proposed bridge\r\n\r\nto  replace the Causeway from the package.  We  explained\r\n\r\nthat  we saw no need for the bridge but were prepared  to\r\n\r\ngo  along  and  spend  several  hundred  million  dollars\r\n\r\nprovided it is part\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the package.  The Malaysian side wanted to delink the\r\n\r\nbridge from the package even though the bridge was listed\r\n\r\nas  a  package item in PM Mahathir's letter of 4th  March\r\n\r\n2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On POA, Malaysia indicated that the KTM station\r\n\r\nwould remain in Tanjong Pagar.  While the Malaysians  did\r\n\r\nnot question the legal validity of the POA, they took the\r\n\r\nposition  that the POA would become operative only  after\r\n\r\nthe  KTM  vacates  the Tanjong Pagar  station.   This  is\r\n\r\ncontrary  to the fact that the POA is a G-to-G  agreement\r\n\r\nwhich  took  effect and became operative on the  date  of\r\n\r\nsigning (ie, 27th November 1990).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On CIQ, Malaysia reversed its earlier position to\r\n\r\nrelocate  its CIQ to Johor.  Malaysia now wants  to  have\r\n\r\nits rail CIQ in Tanjong Pagar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the Second Ministerial Meeting, both\r\n\r\nsides agreed to have a meeting at the officials' level to\r\n\r\nfocus  on  the water issue on the understanding  that  it\r\n\r\nwould be part of the package and without prejudice to our\r\n\r\nlegal position.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>PM's meeting with PM Mahathir on 8th October 2002</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM Goh visited KL to participate in the World\r\n\r\nEconomic  Forum  meeting (7-8th October  2002).   PM  Goh\r\n\r\nrequested a meeting with PM Mahathir which was  fixed  on\r\n\r\n8th  October 2002.  They discussed terrorism as  well  as\r\n\r\nthe on-going package negotiations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM Mahathir said that Malaysia wanted to \"decouple\r\n\r\nthe water issue\" from the other items in the package.  PM\r\n\r\nMahathir added that if both sides could resolve the water\r\n\r\nissue,  the other issues could then be resolved.  PM  Goh\r\n\r\nexplained why all items had to be taken as a package.  If\r\n\r\nwater were taken out of the package, then Singapore would\r\n\r\nhave less leeway to make concessions on other issues, for\r\n\r\nexample, the POA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On revision of price of water under the current\r\n\r\nAgreements,  PM Goh said that Singapore was agreeable  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  as  part  of  the package.  The two Prime  Ministers\r\n\r\nexpressed hope that the officials meeting to be  held  on\r\n\r\n16-17th October would make progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately after the meeting on 8th October 02,\r\n\r\nForeign  Minister Syed Hamid announced to the media  that\r\n\r\nSingapore had accepted \"Malaysia's prerogative to  review\r\n\r\nthe  water rates\" and that Singapore had agreed to delink\r\n\r\nwater  from the package. This was a gross distortion,  as\r\n\r\nthe  two  Prime Ministers never discussed  the  issue  of\r\n\r\nlegal  right  of Malaysia.  PM Goh had only agreed  to  a\r\n\r\ndiscussion  of  price revision of water as  part  of  the\r\n\r\npackage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Press Secretary to PM therefore clarified on 8th\r\n\r\nOctober 2002 that the legal point about Malaysia's  right\r\n\r\nto  review the price of water had not even been discussed\r\n\r\nby  the  two  Prime Ministers.  Singapore's position  was\r\n\r\nthat Malaysia has lost the legal right for reviewing  the\r\n\r\nprice  of water under the current Agreements 15-16  years\r\n\r\nlater  but  Singapore was prepared  to  discuss  a  price\r\n\r\nrevision as part of the bilateral package.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>PM  Mahathir's  letter of 7th October and PM's  reply  of 14th October 2002</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 10th October, two days after PM Goh's meeting\r\n\r\nwith  PM Mahathir, he received a letter from PM Mahathir.\r\n\r\nIt  was  dated 7th October, that is, one day  before  his\r\n\r\nmeeting with PM Goh, and sent by a Third Party Note dated\r\n\r\n9th  October from Wisma Putra which we received  on  10th\r\n\r\nOctober.  In his letter, PM Mahathir told PM Goh that  he\r\n\r\nwas discontinuing the package.  He wrote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The approach that both sides had adopted so far in\r\n\r\ndealing with the outstanding issues in a package, has not\r\n\r\nyielded  any  meaningful  results.   In  view  of   this,\r\n\r\nMalaysia  has  now  decided to  discontinue  the  package\r\n\r\napproach  and  to  give  the highest  priority  to  first\r\n\r\nresolving the long-delayed water issue, particularly  the\r\n\r\nprice   review  of  raw  water.   Once  this   issue   is\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily and amicably resolved, I am confident that\r\n\r\nMalaysia and Singapore would be able to move forward much\r\n\r\nfaster  in  finding  solutions to the  other  outstanding\r\n\r\nissues that stand in the way of our bilateral relations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers   should  note  two  important  aspects   of   PM\r\n\r\nMahathir's letter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the letter was dated 7th October, ie,\r\n\r\nwritten one day before PM Goh met PM Mahathir.  But  this\r\n\r\nletter was never mentioned at the meeting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the discontinuation of the package was a\r\n\r\nunilateral  Malaysian decision.  It was  not  a  proposal\r\n\r\nthat was put to PM Goh for consideration.  PM Goh was not\r\n\r\nasked if he agrees with this new approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM Goh replied to PM Mahathir's letter on 14th\r\n\r\nOctober  2002  to remind PM Mahathir that they  both  had\r\n\r\nagreed on a package approach, as PM Mahathir himself  had\r\n\r\nacknowledged  in his letter, and this was  why  Singapore\r\n\r\nhad  been  prepared to make concessions.   But  now  that\r\n\r\nMalaysia  has unilaterally discontinued the  package  and\r\n\r\nwants  Singapore to deal with the water issue separately,\r\n\r\ntrade-offs  would no longer be possible  and  each  issue\r\n\r\nwould  have to be dealt with individually based on  their\r\n\r\nstand-alone merits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM Goh said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"As you wrote in the opening sentence of your letter\r\n\r\nof  7  October, you and I had reached a decision  'on  27\r\n\r\nDecember  1998  in Hanoi for Malaysia and  Singapore,  to\r\n\r\nresolve, once and for all, the outstanding issues between\r\n\r\nour  two countries in a package.'  In other words, we had\r\n\r\nagreed  to trade-off, in a package, the benefits to  each\r\n\r\nother  from  the  various  issues,  namely,  water,  POA,\r\n\r\nairspace, CPF and the bridge to replace the Causeway.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM Goh added:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I had been prepared to make concessions in varying\r\n\r\nthe  POA  with  extra pieces of land, allowing  an  early\r\n\r\nwithdrawal of CPF deposits, and building our part of  the\r\n\r\nbridge  to replace the Causeway at our expense, as trade-offs, so that you could give us airspace and future water\r\n\r\nat  a  fair  price.  Regarding water, you had written  in\r\n\r\nyour  letter of February 2001 that Johor believed that  a\r\n\r\nfair price for raw water was 60 sen\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing, PM Goh stated:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Since you now want to deal with the water issue\r\n\r\nseparately  and  discontinue the package approach,  these\r\n\r\ntrade-offs  are no longer possible.  And as  the  package\r\n\r\ndeal  is off, I have instructed my officials to deal with\r\n\r\nwater  and  the other issues individually and separately,\r\n\r\non their stand-alone merits, and no longer\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  a  package.   I  hope  our officials  can  make  some\r\n\r\nprogress at their coming meeting with your new approach\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince  PM  Mahathir had not mentioned the  fact  of  this\r\n\r\nletter  when  the two Prime Ministers met on 8th  October\r\n\r\n2002, PM Goh in his reply said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Had you, at our 8 October meeting, told me that you\r\n\r\nhad  already written and signed this letter on 7 October,\r\n\r\nI  would have elaborated on the pros and cons of your new\r\n\r\napproach.   We  would then have jointly  decided  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis upon which our officials would negotiate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have referred to this\r\n\r\ncorrespondence  at some length because  there  have  been\r\n\r\nmany statements in the Malaysian media and from Malaysian\r\n\r\npoliticians  that  have deliberately misrepresented  what\r\n\r\ntranspired  at  this  meeting  between  PM  Goh  and   PM\r\n\r\nMahathir. Here is a sampling:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM Mahathir was reported to have said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"This is very clear. As I understood it, Goh Chok\r\n\r\nTong  agreed that there should be a review and a  formula\r\n\r\nto determine the price of water.\" and \"Singapore's denial\r\n\r\nof what had been agreed would only complicate the talks.\"\r\n\r\n[Utusan Malaysia, 12th October 2002]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign Minister Syed Hamid was reported to have\r\n\r\ncommented on Press Secretary to PM Goh's clarification on\r\n\r\n8th October 2002:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We think our comprehension of the language (sic\r\n\r\nEnglish) is very reasonable (but) every time we  come  to\r\n\r\nan  understanding,  they  later deny  it.\"  [New  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes, 14th October 2002]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These statements have impugned PM Goh's integrity\r\n\r\nand  imply  that PM Goh was not telling the  truth  about\r\n\r\nwhat  transpired  during his meeting  with  PM  Mahathir.\r\n\r\nSingapore's leaders stand by their words. It  is  in  our\r\n\r\nfundamental  interest to preserve our  credibility.   The\r\n\r\nMalaysians also alleged that the package was discontinued\r\n\r\nbecause  Singapore  always wanted to  discuss  the  water\r\n\r\nissue  only, as can be seen from the quotes that  I  read\r\n\r\nout.   It was Malaysia that unilaterally discontinued the\r\n\r\npackage.     And it was Malaysia that wanted  to  discuss\r\n\r\nonly water.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Senior  Officials'  Meeting in Johor  Baru  from  16-17th October 2002</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although PM Mahathir's letter announcing the\r\n\r\ndiscontinuation of the package came just days before  the\r\n\r\nSenior  Officials' meeting of 16-17th  October  in  Johor\r\n\r\nBaru  on  the  water issue, our officials still  attended\r\n\r\nthat  meeting in good faith.  We were prepared to discuss\r\n\r\nall aspects of the water issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at the Johor Baru meeting, Malaysia was\r\n\r\nonly  prepared  to  engage in discussions  on  the  price\r\n\r\nreview  of current water, as evident from the wording  of\r\n\r\ntheir  agenda  and the banner.  They amended  these  only\r\n\r\nafter  we  protested  and stressed that  the  discussions\r\n\r\nshould also be on treated water and the future supply  of\r\n\r\nwater to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia presented the same pricing formula for\r\n\r\ncurrent  water  as  at  the Second  Ministerial  Meeting,\r\n\r\nnamely, the price of raw water today as the average  cost\r\n\r\nof  desalinated water and NEWater less the treatment cost\r\n\r\nin  Johor.  We took the position that Malaysia  had  lost\r\n\r\nthe right of review, and even if Singapore was willing to\r\n\r\nconsider such a review, it would have to be based on  the\r\n\r\nexpress  provisions  or  factors  listed  in  the  review\r\n\r\nclauses.   The  Malaysians again could not justify  their\r\n\r\npricing  formula  for  current  water  under  the  review\r\n\r\nclauses in the existing Water Agreements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We reminded them that the provisions in the Water\r\n\r\nAgreements  allow for a price review using the  rise  and\r\n\r\nfall  in  the purchasing power of money and the rise  and\r\n\r\nfall  in the cost of labour, power and materials for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  supplying  the  water,  and  there  are   no\r\n\r\nprovisions for retrospective payments.  Since PUB  incurs\r\n\r\nall  these costs, the only relevant factor is the  change\r\n\r\nin  the  purchasing power of money.  Using the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nConsumer  Price  Index  (MCPI), we  calculated  that  the\r\n\r\nrevised price of raw water would be no more than  12  sen\r\n\r\nper  thousand gallons.  But we made it clear to them that\r\n\r\nthe  12  sen was not an offer but a calculation based  on\r\n\r\nthe  review  clauses.  The Malaysians asked if  we  could\r\n\r\nconsider going\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbeyond  the  figure of 12 sen.   They  pointed  out  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  had  previously  offered  45  sen.   We   said\r\n\r\nSingapore could not go beyond the review clauses  and  we\r\n\r\nhad no leeway to make any concessions because the package\r\n\r\nis off due to PM Mahathir's letter of 7th October 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On treated water, we informed the Malaysians that if\r\n\r\nwe  applied  the MCPI to the review of price  of  treated\r\n\r\nwater,  we  would  get a figure around RM2  per  thousand\r\n\r\ngallons.    Again, we made it clear that this was not  an\r\n\r\noffer.  It was our calculation going by the terms of  the\r\n\r\nreview clauses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On future water, ie, post-2061, the Malaysians\r\n\r\nactually  were  not interested or serious in  wanting  to\r\n\r\nhave  any detailed discussions.  They continued  to  take\r\n\r\nthe  position that both sides could discuss the issue two\r\n\r\nyears  before  the  expiry of  the  1962  Agreement.   We\r\n\r\nstressed  that  this was not a realistic  proposal.   Our\r\n\r\nposition  is  that  current water and  future  water  are\r\n\r\nlinked  and  we  cannot discuss price review  of  current\r\n\r\nwater now and future water only in 2059.  It is difficult\r\n\r\nfor Singapore to agree to Malaysia's proposal because  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  plan  our  long-term  needs  well  in  advance.\r\n\r\nSingapore  would need to work out in detail  the  complex\r\n\r\nissues  involved  in regard to a future water  agreement,\r\n\r\nincluding water demand management, capacity building  and\r\n\r\ntechnological advances.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Price Review</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng has asked questions specifically on the\r\n\r\nreview  clauses in the Water Agreements.   She  wants  to\r\n\r\nknow whether Malaysia has any legal basis to ask for this\r\n\r\nprice review after failing to do so in 1986 and 1987, and\r\n\r\nif  they have any legal basis also to backdate such price\r\n\r\nrevision; and if not, she asks why is Singapore  prepared\r\n\r\nto consider a price review now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My answer is that we have been advised that they do\r\n\r\nnot have a legal basis.  I do not want to go into all the\r\n\r\nlegal arguments\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhere.   But  let me say that we have taken legal  advice.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why we maintain that they have lost  the  legal\r\n\r\nright.   And  even if they have the right to  review  the\r\n\r\nwater  price  now,  there  is  no  legal  basis  in   the\r\n\r\nAgreements to backdate it.  We also added that  if  there\r\n\r\nwere  to  be  any  review, it must logically  also  cover\r\n\r\ntreated water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they have no legal basis, Ms Irene Ng asks: why\r\n\r\nare we prepared to discuss it?  Well, Sir, the answer  to\r\n\r\nthat  question is that they have said it is important  to\r\n\r\nthem.   We  said:  alright,  we  understand  that  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant to you and we are prepared to discuss  as  part\r\n\r\nof the package but not as your legal entitlement.  In the\r\n\r\nsame  way  as we do not have a legal right to  insist  on\r\n\r\nairspace rights and we do not have a legal right  to  ask\r\n\r\nfor  water supply after the expiry of the 1961  and  1962\r\n\r\nWater Agreements when they expire in 2011 and 2061.   But\r\n\r\nlet  us,  nevertheless, take the approach  of  trying  to\r\n\r\naccommodate each other's concerns as best as we  can  for\r\n\r\nreaching a mutually beneficial agreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our position on price review is clear. Malaysia has\r\n\r\nlost its right of review.  If Malaysia claims that it has\r\n\r\nthe  right  now  to  invoke the review clauses,  we  will\r\n\r\ncontest it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Concluding Remarks</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from what I have said, Members can\r\n\r\nsee  that  there have been many twists and turns  in  our\r\n\r\nnegotiations with Malaysia.  If I may sum up:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, both Prime Ministers agreed on the package\r\n\r\napproach  in  1998  to  resolve the  outstanding  issues,\r\n\r\nincluding  the long-term supply of water, CPF,  POA,  CIQ\r\n\r\nand airspace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, the Malaysians wanted to include the bridge\r\n\r\nto replace the Causeway.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we said we are prepared to spend several\r\n\r\nhundred millions to build our part of the bridge as  part\r\n\r\nof the package, they said the bridge is no longer part of\r\n\r\nthe package.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000, they said price revision of water under the\r\n\r\ncurrent  agreement (which was never part of the  original\r\n\r\npackage  agreed by PM) should be included in the package.\r\n\r\nIn  February  2001, Malaysia had informed us that  \"Johor\r\n\r\nbelieves that a fair price would be 60 sen\".  We had then\r\n\r\ncounter-proposed 45 sen for current water and 60 sen  for\r\n\r\nfuture  water.  An in-principle agreement was reached  on\r\n\r\nthis in September 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in its letter of 4th March 2002, Malaysia\r\n\r\nchanged  its position and tabled new proposals, including\r\n\r\nraising  the  price of current raw water  to  RM3.   This\r\n\r\nmeant  that they rejected our 45 sen offer.  Consequently\r\n\r\nit was no longer on the table.  We have told them so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Malaysians wanted water to be taken out of\r\n\r\nthe package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, six days before the Senior Officials'\r\n\r\nMeeting,  we  received PM Mahathir's letter stating  that\r\n\r\nthe \"package is discontinued.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then at the Johor Baru meeting (16-17th October\r\n\r\n2002),  Malaysia went further to take the  position  that\r\n\r\nthe  water  issue  involves only the  price  revision  of\r\n\r\ncurrent  water  and  that, as  far  as  future  water  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  we  can  discuss this  two  years  before  it\r\n\r\nexpires in 2061.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, at present, Mr Speaker, because Malaysia has\r\n\r\nunilaterally  called  off  the package,  the  concessions\r\n\r\nwhich  Singapore was prepared to offer, for  example,  on\r\n\r\nthe  POA, the bridge, the CPF, are off and each issue has\r\n\r\nto be discussed and agreed on its stand-alone merits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the usual barrage of accusations,\r\n\r\nallegations as well as threats continue to be  hurled  at\r\n\r\nus.   This  includes the threat last week that  they  can\r\n\r\nenact  a new law to render the Water Agreements null  and\r\n\r\nvoid.    As   usual,  we  are  also  accused   of   being\r\n\r\n\"insincere\",  and  that we are told to  be  \"sincere\"  by\r\n\r\naccepting  their demands.  As I have repeatedly  said  in\r\n\r\nthis  House, we should take the Malaysian criticisms  and\r\n\r\nattacks  against us in our stride.  There is no  need  to\r\n\r\nover-react to these pressures and efforts to intimidate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nus.   We  will continue to state the facts and stand  our\r\n\r\nground, in a quiet but serious manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is a pity that they have taken\r\n\r\nmatters to this point.  We have expended a great deal  of\r\n\r\ntime and effort in trying to reach a win-win solution for\r\n\r\nboth  sides.  Since December 1998 when PM Goh agreed,  at\r\n\r\nthe  request of PM Mahathir, that the outstanding  issues\r\n\r\nbe  discussed  as  a package, we have  had  three  Senior\r\n\r\nOfficials' Meetings in 1999, and two Ministerial Meetings\r\n\r\nthis  year.  Senior Minister had visited KL twice (August\r\n\r\n2000  and September 2001) to see how to move the  package\r\n\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, let me say that the sooner we can put\r\n\r\nthese  issues behind us the better.  As PM  Goh  told  PM\r\n\r\nMahathir  on  8th  October 2002, Malaysia  and  Singapore\r\n\r\nreally face very serious problems in the region posed  by\r\n\r\nterrorism.   It is in the interest of both  countries  to\r\n\r\nsettle  these bilateral issues so that we can  deal  with\r\n\r\nthe  real  threats and problems that confront us  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>VISIT OF DELEGATION FROM THE COMMITTEE ON CULTURE,</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EDUCATION, YOUTH AND CHILDREN FROM THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>OF VIETNAM</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Presence in Gallery)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On behalf of hon.

Very\r\n\r\nclearly,  the twists and turns in the Malaysian  position\r\n\r\nhave  made negotiations extremely difficult.  Try  as  we\r\n\r\nmust and try as we will.  In this context, I want to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  what will happen next in our negotiations.\r\n\r\nWill there be further Senior Officials'\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeeting  or  Ministerial  Meeting?   And  what  will   be\r\n\r\nSingapore's position and approach in these future  series\r\n\r\nof meetings?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, to answer Dr Ong Chit Chung,\r\n\r\nI  would  say  that  the  ball is  in  Malaysia's  court.\r\n\r\nBecause at the Second Ministerial Meeting in Singapore in\r\n\r\nSeptember,  Foreign Minister Syed Hamid said  that  after\r\n\r\nthe   Senior  Officials  reported  the  outcome  of   the\r\n\r\ndiscussions to the two Ministers, both sides  would  then\r\n\r\ndecide  on a date for the next Ministerial Meeting  which\r\n\r\nMalaysia  would be prepared to host.  He said this.   But\r\n\r\nwe  have not heard from Malaysia on any follow-up meeting\r\n\r\nto  discuss  the water and other issues after the  recent\r\n\r\nSenior Officials' Meeting in Johor Baru.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Singapore is concerned, we stand ready to\r\n\r\nmeet  them  to  discuss the water issue  further  and  to\r\n\r\ncontinue the negotiations.  But I should stress that  the\r\n\r\nnegotiations  cannot be on the basis  that:  please  show\r\n\r\nyour  sincerity by caving in to our demands.  If you want\r\n\r\nto  talk  about water, I think Malaysia has  to  be  very\r\n\r\nserious.   We  understand  Malaysia's  priority   is   to\r\n\r\nincrease the price of current raw water.  That is why  we\r\n\r\nhave  said  that  we  are prepared to discuss  the  price\r\n\r\nrevision  of  water, even though our stand is  that  they\r\n\r\nhave  lost the legal right.  But they, at the same  time,\r\n\r\nmust show seriousness in discussing future water and  not\r\n\r\nfob  us  off by saying that we can discuss this in  2059,\r\n\r\njust  two  years  before the expiry  of  the  1962  Water\r\n\r\nAgreement.  So I would say Singapore's position  is  that\r\n\r\nwe  are  committed to seeking a solution to  resolve  the\r\n\r\nwater  issue and other bilateral issues but we cannot  go\r\n\r\nby  vague assurances from Malaysia that it is prepared to\r\n\r\nsupply future water to Singapore because, as I have said,\r\n\r\nwe  must plan our long term water needs in advance.   And\r\n\r\nwe  have to work out the details years before the  expiry\r\n\r\nof  the  2062  Agreement, issues  such  as  water  demand\r\n\r\nmanagement and capacity building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what our approach will be, from my main\r\n\r\nanswer, it is quite clear that by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabandoning   the  package,  Malaysia  has   fundamentally\r\n\r\nchanged  the  basis of the bilateral talks.   Singapore's\r\n\r\nposition  has  always  been on the  basis  of  a  package\r\n\r\napproach  and, in his letter of 14th October 2002,  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Goh  made  it  clear that  since  Malaysia  had\r\n\r\ndecided to discontinue the package, each issue will  have\r\n\r\nto  be discussed on its stand-alone merits, and it is not\r\n\r\npossible to maintain our previous concessions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in future, Singapore has no choice but to deal\r\n\r\nwith  the water and other issues individually on a stand-alone basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Marine Parade):</b> Could I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  what is Singapore's position with regard  to  a\r\n\r\npreposterous  statement made by a Malaysian  Minister  by\r\n\r\nthe  name of Mr Rais Yatim, that Malaysia would  enact  a\r\n\r\nlocal law to make the Water Agreements null and void?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I think honourable Members will\r\n\r\nrecall  that,  last week, my Ministry actually  issued  a\r\n\r\nstatement  on those remarks by Minister Rais Yatim.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Foreign Affairs statement pointed  out  that\r\n\r\nwhat  Minister  Rais Yatim said was not  in  accord  with\r\n\r\nrepeated assurances by Malaysian leaders that they  would\r\n\r\nhonour  the  1961 and 1962 agreements until the  date  of\r\n\r\nexpiry.   These assurances actually date back many  years\r\n\r\nago  and  have been repeated very recently.  In fact,  in\r\n\r\n1988, Prime Minister Mahathir said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We cannot set aside the treaty (referring to the\r\n\r\nwater  agreements) as it is an agreement between the  two\r\n\r\ncountries registered with the United Nations.  We  cannot\r\n\r\nbreak our word.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is from Malaysia's Business Times of 23rd\r\n\r\nJanuary 1988, also carried in Singapore's Straits Times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, this year, Dr Mahathir said in the New Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  of 3rd May that Malaysia was \"bound\" by the  water\r\n\r\nagreements and \"cannot just break the agreements\".  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Mahathir also said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The fact is, according to the agreements, we,\r\n\r\nMalaysia, must supply them with water.  We will continue.\r\n\r\nWe promise them that we will supply them with water.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Foreign Minister Syed Hamid, in his opening\r\n\r\nstatement at the talks held in Kuala Lumpur in July 2002,\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Malaysia has repeatedly said that it will honour\r\n\r\nthe  1961 and 1962 agreements until their expiry in  2011\r\n\r\nand 2061 respectively.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"During the Separation of Singapore, Malaysia did\r\n\r\nnot  propose  for  the agreements  to  be  reviewed.   It\r\n\r\ncontinues  to honour the agreements, and such  commitment\r\n\r\nis further reinforced when Malaysia signed the Separation\r\n\r\nAgreement in 1965.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in answer to Mr Ravindran, I would say that\r\n\r\nthese  clearly are then legally binding agreements  which\r\n\r\nwere  guaranteed  by  both  governments  under  the  1965\r\n\r\nSeparation Agreement.  And, as Prime Minister Goh said in\r\n\r\nParliament  in April this year, the Separation  Agreement\r\n\r\nis fundamental to Singapore's existence as an independent\r\n\r\nnation  and  has  been registered at the United  Nations.\r\n\r\nSo,  any attempt to repudiate the guarantees set  out  in\r\n\r\nthe  Separation Agreement, any attempt to vary the  terms\r\n\r\nof  the  Water Agreements without the express consent  of\r\n\r\nboth  governments,  will  be  a  serious  breach  of  the\r\n\r\nSeparation Agreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his specific proposal of enacting a law, let me\r\n\r\nsay  that  Malaysia cannot enact a domestic law to  avoid\r\n\r\nmeeting  its international treaty obligations.  Actually,\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  very established principle of  international\r\n\r\nlaw.   If a country can get out of one treaty obligations\r\n\r\nthrough the use of domestic law, it signals to the  world\r\n\r\nthat  it  can  and will do so for any other international\r\n\r\nagreements,  and  this will destroy the sanctity  of  all\r\n\r\ninternational agreements.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Will the Minister\r\n\r\ncomment  on our position in referring the water issue  to\r\n\r\ninternational arbitration, as has been proposed  by  some\r\n\r\nMalaysian leaders?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Indeed, Sir, I have noted that\r\n\r\nboth Foreign Minister Syed Hamid and the Menteri Besar of\r\n\r\nJohor have referred to this.

He said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"There was no point in doing so because Johor was\r\n\r\ndependent on Singapore for its treated water supply,  and\r\n\r\nSingapore would have also increased its price of  treated\r\n\r\nwater sold to Johor.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\nThis was in the New Straits Times of 3rd July this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Mahathir also said that Malaysia did not revise\r\n\r\nthe water pricing when it was due then because it thought\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  would also revise the price  of  treated\r\n\r\nwater  supplied to Malaysia.  This was in  Bernama,  11th\r\n\r\nOctober   this   year.    In  other   words,   they   had\r\n\r\ndeliberately, as a matter of conscious policy, chosen not\r\n\r\nto  review  the  price of water in 1986/1987.   Actually,\r\n\r\neven up to the point of the 1990 Agreement concerning the\r\n\r\nLinggiu  Dam  and related matters being signed,  Malaysia\r\n\r\ndid not raise any issue concerning the price of 3 sen per\r\n\r\nthousand gallons of raw\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwater.

We have  made  the\r\n\r\nfacts  known before.  The first point to realise is  that\r\n\r\nwhat Malaysia does not say is that the raw water that  we\r\n\r\nget  from  them is not drinkable as such.  It has  to  be\r\n\r\ntreated.   And when it is treated, it is at the  cost  of\r\n\r\nRM2.40  per thousand gallons, and we sell it to Johor  at\r\n\r\n50  sen.  Therefore, Singapore is really absorbing RM1.90\r\n\r\nof  the cost.  Malaysia then sells this treated water  at\r\n\r\nRM3.95  per  thousand  gallons.   So,  we  can  make  the\r\n\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the Member's question, Singapore is\r\n\r\nonly  obliged, under the Agreements, to sell  17  million\r\n\r\ngallons  a day (mgd) of treated water.  That is  what  we\r\n\r\nare  obliged  to.   But  Malaysia buys  well  above  that\r\n\r\namount.  They buy 37 mgd of treated water, well above the\r\n\r\namount  that  Singapore  is  contracted  to  provide  and\r\n\r\ncalculations make it clear as to why they are doing that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, we know that\r\n\r\nthere  are a lot of accusations that the Malaysians  have\r\n\r\ngiven.

Can  the  Minister\r\n\r\nclarify   whether  there  is  any  basis  for   such   an\r\n\r\nallegation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, there is no basis. We have\r\n\r\nalso, at one previous occasion, rebutted this point.  The\r\n\r\nMembers are right.  Malaysia has repeatedly said that the\r\n\r\nWater  Agreements, including the 3 sen price, was settled\r\n\r\nby  the British who favoured Singapore.  Dr Mahathir, for\r\n\r\nexample,  had said that the Water Agreement drawn  up  by\r\n\r\nthe  British  was  in  favour of  Singapore  because  the\r\n\r\nBritish advised the Johor government then.  This  is  not\r\n\r\ntrue.   As  we  have  pointed out in our  own  MFA  press\r\n\r\nstatement in January 2002:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Tebrau and Scudai Rivers Water Agreement and\r\n\r\nthe  Johor River Water Agreement were signed by the Johor\r\n\r\nState  Government and the City Council  of  Singapore  in\r\n\r\n1961  and 1962 respectively.  By then, Malaya was already\r\n\r\nan independent and sovereign\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnation.   Singapore  had achieved  self-government.   How\r\n\r\ncould  the  British play any role in an  independent  and\r\n\r\nsovereign  Malaya?  Would the federal  government  of  an\r\n\r\nindependent  and sovereign Malaya allow the  Johor  State\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  sign  any  agreement  that  was   against\r\n\r\nMalaysia's national interest?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add two further points. Firstly, Malaysia\r\n\r\nhad  agreed in 1965, when we separated, to guarantee  the\r\n\r\nobservance of the Water Agreements, and this guarantee is\r\n\r\nenshrined  in the Separation Agreement.  Secondly,  Johor\r\n\r\nconfirmed  the price of 3 sen in 1990 when it signed  the\r\n\r\nagreement  with PUB for the construction of  the  Linggiu\r\n\r\nDam.   Had Johor exercised its right to review the  price\r\n\r\nin  accordance with the agreement in 1986 and  1987,  the\r\n\r\nPUB  would  have  taken that revised price  into  account\r\n\r\nbefore  proceeding to invest in the building of  the  dam\r\n\r\nand  all ancillary works that actually amount to some S$1\r\n\r\nbillion.   Therefore,  it is simply ridiculous  to  claim\r\n\r\nthat  the British fixed these Water Agreements in  favour\r\n\r\nof Singapore against the interest of Johor.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mr Speaker, I would like to go\r\n\r\nback  to  the earlier response by the Minister.

I do not think we have reached  the\r\n\r\nposition that Singapore should take the approach  of  not\r\n\r\ntalking.   For  example, take the  situation  when  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   Mahathir's   letter   came   on   unilaterally\r\n\r\ndiscontinuing the package.

But\r\n\r\nI  think, in good faith, we showed that we are reasonable\r\n\r\nand  went  to Johor Baru to discuss both aspects  of  the\r\n\r\nwater  issue.   This  has been our approach,  as  Members\r\n\r\nwould  have  seen in this whole saga, that although  they\r\n\r\nsaid  that  we  have been unreasonable and we  have  been\r\n\r\ndelaying,  the  facts that I have unfolded  today  should\r\n\r\nmake  it  clear to everyone that we have gone  the  extra\r\n\r\nmile.  We have tried to accommodate their concerns.  They\r\n\r\nare  the  ones  who  keep changing  the  goalposts,  keep\r\n\r\nchanging  the parameters. The package - did  not  include\r\n\r\nthe  bridge,  then it is included, then it is  out;  then\r\n\r\nnever  included raw water, price revision in; then  water\r\n\r\nis  out,  and  even  when it is out,  it  is  only  price\r\n\r\nrevision, and future water discussed after some of us  or\r\n\r\nmost  of  us are dead.  So, the point I want to make  is:\r\n\r\nas   far   as   there   is  scope  for  discussions,   my\r\n\r\nrecommendation is we continue to talk.

This\r\n\r\nwas  well  known prior to the 12th October Bali terrorist\r\n\r\nattack.

We have told the Australians  that\r\n\r\nthis  could be counter-productive.  Terrorism is a global\r\n\r\nthreat.  Post 9/11, this global threat has certainly been\r\n\r\nenhanced.  Indeed, the media has reported the presence of\r\n\r\nJI  cells in some of Australia's major cities.  We do not\r\n\r\nthink  that   undifferentiated and  alarmist  assessments\r\n\r\nserve   to   advance  our  common  commitment  to   fight\r\n\r\nterrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to press our concerns home to the\r\n\r\nAustralians.

Developments  in  the region  and  in  the  world\r\n\r\neconomy  are now less favourable in a number of important\r\n\r\nrespects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the US economy, which remains the main driver\r\n\r\nof  global growth, is losing momentum.  US consumers, who\r\n\r\nhave so far held up the US economy, are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeginning to spend less.  Consumer confidence in  the  US\r\n\r\nin October, if we go by the latest indicators, was at its\r\n\r\nlowest  level  in  nine  years.  Taking  their  cue  from\r\n\r\nconsumers,  business investments in the US  remain  weak.\r\n\r\nNew  orders  for  durable goods  fell  by  nearly  6%  in\r\n\r\nSeptember,  which is the sharpest decline in  10  months.\r\n\r\nThe  outlook  for  the US economy has therefore  weakened\r\n\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, our other major markets like Europe and\r\n\r\nJapan  are  experiencing very slow  growth   -  close  to\r\n\r\nrecession  -  due to their structural problems, and their\r\n\r\nstructural inhibitions.  China, while growing rapidly, is\r\n\r\nstill  a relatively small source of international demand.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  with  no  major engines  driving  the  global\r\n\r\neconomy, Singapore cannot expect to avoid slow growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third factor is the weaker outlook in the\r\n\r\ninfocomms sector  -  basically, the PC and communications\r\n\r\nindustry   -   which  has  direct  knock-on  effects   on\r\n\r\nSingapore's exports.  In the US, new orders for computers\r\n\r\nand  electronic  products fell by  6%  in  September    - again,  the  most severe decline in about  a  year.   The\r\n\r\nglobal  semi-conductor market, which bottomed  out  early\r\n\r\nthis  year and began recovering in the first half of  the\r\n\r\nyear,  is  now softening.  Forecasts of growth in  global\r\n\r\nsemiconductor  sales for 2002 are down  to  2%  or  less.\r\n\r\nGrowth  in 2003 is expected at about 9%, but this is  far\r\n\r\nbelow  the 22% that was predicted just a few months  ago.\r\n\r\nEven  then,  there is downside risk in the industry.   An\r\n\r\nabsolute contraction in global semiconductor sales, which\r\n\r\nis  a bellwether for the electronics industry, cannot  be\r\n\r\nruled out next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further downside is the potential impact of a\r\n\r\nUS-Iraq  war.   However,  in the  event  of  a  quick  US\r\n\r\nvictory, the consensus is that higher oil prices will not\r\n\r\nbe  sustained, and the impact on the global economy  will\r\n\r\nbe contained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fifth negative is the recent terrorist attack in\r\n\r\nBali.   It has cast a shadow on the economic outlook  for\r\n\r\nthe  region  as  a  whole.   The travel  and  hospitality\r\n\r\nindustries will have to brace themselves for a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndrop  in  tourist  arrivals over  the  short  term.   The\r\n\r\nimmediate impact on arrivals has not been major,  but  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  evident over the next couple  of  months.   The\r\n\r\nconsequences  will be broader, and more serious,  if  the\r\n\r\nBali  attacks  lead  to  a  sustained  fall  in  investor\r\n\r\nconfidence in the region.  It is too early to assess  the\r\n\r\nimpact,  especially as events in Indonesia and  in  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  unfold.   The ASEAN region  has  underlying\r\n\r\neconomic strengths, and initial assessments of the damage\r\n\r\nmay  well prove exaggerated.  But confidence matters, and\r\n\r\ninvestors will believe in the region only when  they  see\r\n\r\ncredible efforts to deal with the terrorist threat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, fortunately, some bright spots in\r\n\r\nSingapore's  economic  outlook.  Our  exports  to  China,\r\n\r\nincluding electronics exports, continue to grow  rapidly.\r\n\r\nOur  chemicals and biomedical industries are  also  doing\r\n\r\nwell, although growth fluctuates from quarter to quarter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the recovery in the Singapore economy this\r\n\r\nyear  has  been  narrow-based and uneven.   The  external\r\n\r\nenvironment  has weakened considerably in recent  months.\r\n\r\nThis  has  also  muted  expectations  of  a  recovery  in\r\n\r\nconsumer  confidence  and  in  domestic  spending.    The\r\n\r\nmanufacturing recovery is slowing, while growth  in  most\r\n\r\nof our services industries remains weak.  It is therefore\r\n\r\nlikely that growth for the year will fall below the  3-4%\r\n\r\nrange that we had forecast in August.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outlook for next year is uncertain. But there\r\n\r\nis  more downside than upside on the horizon in the world\r\n\r\neconomy,  at  least  for  the  first  half  of  2003.  We\r\n\r\ntherefore  do  not expect robust growth in the  Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy  next  year.  MTI is watching these  developments\r\n\r\nvery  closely.   We will review and announce  our  growth\r\n\r\nestimate  for  2002 and the forecast for  2003  when  the\r\n\r\nresults  for  the  full third quarter  are  out  in  mid-November.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee asked about economic stimulus\r\n\r\nmeasures.  Some of the measures implemented in July and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober  last  year  are still in place.   These  include\r\n\r\nrebates on personal, corporate and property tax, JTC  and\r\n\r\nHDB  rental  rebates, support for worker training.   They\r\n\r\nalso  include rebates on service and conservancy  charges\r\n\r\nand  rentals, which were extended for five more years  in\r\n\r\nthis  year's  Budget as part of the GST  offset  package.\r\n\r\nThe   second   tranche  of  the  New   Singapore   Shares\r\n\r\ndistributed  last  year can be withdrawn  from  tomorrow.\r\n\r\nAnd personal and corporate tax rates will be reduced with\r\n\r\neffect from Year of Assessment 2003, which will not  only\r\n\r\ngive an immediate boost to individuals and companies, but\r\n\r\nalso,  more fundamentally, help Singapore to become  more\r\n\r\ncompetitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we announced the $11 billion off-budget package\r\n\r\nin October last year, we did not expect it to be followed\r\n\r\nby a quick recovery.  We stated then that we expected the\r\n\r\neconomy  to  take  some time to pick  up.   Indeed,  last\r\n\r\nOctober  and  subsequently in November, we  had  forecast\r\n\r\nthat  growth for this year would be between -2% and  +2%.\r\n\r\nCompared  to this, the actual out-turn for this  year  is\r\n\r\nlikely to be a little better than we had expected a  year\r\n\r\nago  when the stimulus package was introduced.  We cannot\r\n\r\novercome   the  weak  global  and  regional  environments\r\n\r\nthrough  a further domestic stimulus package, or increase\r\n\r\nGovernment  spending each time there  is  a  dip  in  our\r\n\r\ngrowth figures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, MTI is monitoring the economy closely. If\r\n\r\nconditions  continue to weaken over the next few  months,\r\n\r\nthe  Government will consider extending various  measures\r\n\r\nto   help  businesses  and  Singaporeans  tide  over  the\r\n\r\ndifficult period.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, in view of the fact that the\r\n\r\nSingapore economy depends to a certain extent on tourism,\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to  ask the Minister whether  the  recent\r\n\r\nevents  in  Bali  have  affected the  number  of  tourist\r\n\r\narrivals in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Visitor arrivals for the\r\n\r\nfirst nine months were\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nslipping.  It was already fairly weak.  Before  the  Bali\r\n\r\nattack  in  October, we were actually seeing a  recovery.\r\n\r\nVisitor arrivals in the first 12 days of October,  before\r\n\r\nthe Bali terrorist attack, were actually growing at about\r\n\r\n15%  year on year.  Remember, of course, that the  fourth\r\n\r\nquarter  of  last year was a very weak period in  visitor\r\n\r\narrivals, coming after the September 11 attacks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is too early to tell what the impact of the Bali\r\n\r\nattack  will be.  We have seen some fall off in arrivals,\r\n\r\nsome  fall  off in the number of meetings and conferences\r\n\r\nthat  had  been  organised, but  have  subsequently  been\r\n\r\ncancelled.  So far, the impact is not major but we expect\r\n\r\nthere will be contractions in the next few months.  Since\r\n\r\nthe  Bali  attack, we still have positive  year  on  year\r\n\r\ngrowth in visitor arrivals, something like 11%.  But that\r\n\r\nis largely because of the weak base in the fourth quarter\r\n\r\nof last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, could the Minister\r\n\r\ntell  us what is the amount of investments that has  been\r\n\r\ncommitted  for next year, and how does that compare  with\r\n\r\nthis year?

Our  ability  to  respond   with\r\n\r\ndifficult  measures,  and to adjust when  necessary,  has\r\n\r\nbeen  registered  on  investors.

I would like  to  know\r\n\r\nfrom  him when he thinks he will be able to make a proper\r\n\r\nassessment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, just to\r\n\r\nclarify that I am not the Senior Minister, but the Senior\r\n\r\nMinister of State.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of November, MTI will issue its\r\n\r\nrevised  forecast for 2002 and estimates, as best  as  we\r\n\r\ncan, for 2003.  To be absolutely frank, the impact of the\r\n\r\nBali  bombing  is  an  ongoing matter.   It  is  a  fluid\r\n\r\nenvironment.   There is going to be no easy  quantitative\r\n\r\nestimate  of  the impact.  We know how many  tour  groups\r\n\r\nhave  been  cancelled,  how many  conferences  have  been\r\n\r\ncancelled,  and  so  on.  That is finite.   But  how  the\r\n\r\nsituation  is  going  to unfold in the  region  is  still\r\n\r\nhighly  uncertain.  And confidence is, by its nature,  an\r\n\r\nintangible.   We  cannot put a  number  on  it.   My  own\r\n\r\nassessment is that, as Mr Raymond Lim has also  said,  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  over-react,  we  should  not  overstate  the\r\n\r\nimpact.   There are certain underlying strengths  in  the\r\n\r\nregion,   and  obviously  the  competitive  strength   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   But we have to watch the situation  closely.\r\n\r\nConfidence  will  be  shaped by how  governments  in  the\r\n\r\nregion respond to the terrorist threat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Senior Minister of State, in view of  the\r\n\r\nbleak  outlook  that he has just portrayed  to  us,  what\r\n\r\nwould   the  unemployment  situation  be  like   in   the\r\n\r\nforthcoming quarter and next year.  And in view  of  this\r\n\r\nweaker  economy,  should  the Government  not  reconsider\r\n\r\ncontinuing  with the Economic Downturn Relief Scheme,  in\r\n\r\nthe  light that there may well be a continuation  of  the\r\n\r\ndownturn and more help will be needed by the people?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> On the first part of Mr\r\n\r\nLeong's question, again, as mentioned, I will leave it to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Manpower who is going to  address  the\r\n\r\nissue of unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second part of his question with regard to\r\n\r\nthe EDRS, as I have explained, we should not react by off-Budget packages or stimulus measures every time we see  a\r\n\r\ndip  in  the  growth  numbers.   We  are  no  longer   in\r\n\r\nrecession.  We are going through a dull recovery, but  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  prepare  for  what might  be  a  long  haul,  a\r\n\r\ndifficult  period  where the numbers  fluctuate  somewhat\r\n\r\nfrom quarter to quarter, and we have got to adjust to the\r\n\r\nsituation.   The  EDRS has served its  purpose.   It  was\r\n\r\nintroduced at a time of severe economic difficulty and it\r\n\r\nhas   served   its  purpose.   I  think  we  should   not\r\n\r\ninstitutionalise   it.    In   fact,   we   should    not\r\n\r\ninstitutionalise any relief scheme.  We should retain our\r\n\r\nability to respond where really necessary, and respond in\r\n\r\na  focused  fashion,  and make sure that  we  are  always\r\n\r\nhelping those who are truly needy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to monitor the situation carefully.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot  say for sure how the economic situation  will\r\n\r\nunravel  in  the coming months.  So, we will continue  to\r\n\r\nwatch  it  carefully.  If the situation gets much  worse,\r\n\r\nthen  Government will have to consider what  measures  to\r\n\r\nintroduce.  But I do not want to jump the gun on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are needy can get help. As all of us\r\n\r\nknow,  they  can  go  to their MPs,  and  those  who  are\r\n\r\nassessed  to  be  truly  needy and  are  trying  to  help\r\n\r\nthemselves will receive help from us.  The CCCs are quite\r\n\r\nwilling  to  extend  assistance,  case-by-case,  to   any\r\n\r\nSingaporean who is needy.  So, we are very mindful of the\r\n\r\nfact  that  Singaporeans are going  through  a  difficult\r\n\r\nperiod  and some are in need of help.  We should continue\r\n\r\nto  help  them.  But let us not institutionalise  schemes\r\n\r\nwhich were intended to serve a one-off purpose, like  the\r\n\r\nEDRS.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin (Nominated Member):</b> Because\r\n\r\nof the heightened security in the port, especially in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnited  States, and the transportation of goods, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to ask the Senior Minister of State what impact  it\r\n\r\nwill  have on the local businesses and what measures  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  has  taken,  or  is  going  to  take,  to  help\r\n\r\nalleviate the higher cost of business.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> I take it that the\r\n\r\nMember is referring to the US West Coast port strikes and\r\n\r\nthe aftermath of the strikes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an impact. Fortunately, a good part of our\r\n\r\nexports  are  not  bulky.  They are  transported  by  air\r\n\r\nrather  than  by sea.  So the composition of our  exports\r\n\r\nhas  fortunately  allowed  us to  avoid  a  major  impact\r\n\r\narising  from the West Coast port strikes.  But  what  is\r\n\r\nmore important is how it is going to play out in the  US.\r\n\r\nThe  stay order that the court has issued is for 90 days.\r\n\r\nThat  takes  them past the congressional  elections.   It\r\n\r\nwill  be  interesting to see, and we will want  to  watch\r\n\r\nvery closely, what happens after that cooling-off period.\r\n\r\nProductivity  is  down  very sharply  in  the  US  ports.\r\n\r\nLatest  news  indicates that it is down about  25%.   So,\r\n\r\nthings are moving slowly, goods are being jammed up,  and\r\n\r\nthey  are not reaching the stores in time for the festive\r\n\r\nshopping  period.  That could weaken the US  economy  and\r\n\r\nhave repercussions on us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the direct impact of the West Coast port strikes\r\n\r\nis  not  very  significant because we  were  transporting\r\n\r\nprincipally by air, various electronic components and  so\r\n\r\non.  But there could be an indirect impact, depending  on\r\n\r\nhow  this  plays  out in the US, how it affects  consumer\r\n\r\nsentiment, and how it affects business investment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

This will, therefore, counteract some  of\r\n\r\nthese  negative images that possibly would  be  portrayed\r\n\r\nout in the press.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> As Mr Raymond Lim\r\n\r\nindicated, STB is stepping up its marketing, particularly\r\n\r\nin  Asian countries.  Apart from the Australians, and  we\r\n\r\nhave   seen  some  cancellations  of  Australian  groups,\r\n\r\nconference groups, meeting groups, and so on,  there  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  a  gross misconception on the  part  of  other\r\n\r\ncountries  so  far  as we can tell.  I  think,  over  the\r\n\r\nmonths, people will get more discerning.  Certainly,  our\r\n\r\neconomic agencies and STB, in particular, will drive home\r\n\r\nthe point that we are a secure place, we have taken quick\r\n\r\nmeasures  and,  indeed,  ASEAN by  and  large  is  taking\r\n\r\nmeasures to address the problem.

This uncertain environment makes it more  urgent\r\n\r\nand  crucial  for us to restructure and reinvigorate  our\r\n\r\neconomy.   We cannot delay reducing our direct taxes,  in\r\n\r\norder to boost businesses, retain\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntalent,  and generate economic growth and jobs.  We  have\r\n\r\nalready  lowered corporate and top personal tax rates  to\r\n\r\n22% this year, and committed to lowering them further  to\r\n\r\n20% within three years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in GST on 1st January 2003 is an\r\n\r\nintegral part of this tax restructuring package.   If  we\r\n\r\ncut  direct taxes now, but postpone raising the GST until\r\n\r\nlater,  the  Government will not be able to  balance  its\r\n\r\nbudget,  or  adequately  provide  Singaporeans  with  key\r\n\r\npublic  services,  such  as  education,  healthcare   and\r\n\r\ndefence.  Hence, we cannot defer the increase in GST.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For households, the additional GST that they have to\r\n\r\npay  will  be  fully  neutralised  by  the  comprehensive\r\n\r\npackage  of offsets, including the Economic Restructuring\r\n\r\nShares (ERS), rebates for service and conservancy charges\r\n\r\nand  rentals, and increased subsidies on state  education\r\n\r\nand healthcare.  The value of the assistance package will\r\n\r\nbe   enough  to  offset  the  increase  in  GST  for  all\r\n\r\nhouseholds  for  at least five years.   For  lower-income\r\n\r\nhouseholds,  the  package is worth  up  to  10  years  of\r\n\r\nincreased  GST.  A few households may find  the  standard\r\n\r\noffset  package inadequate, but they can  turn  to  their\r\n\r\nCitizens  Consultative Committees (CCCs)  for  additional\r\n\r\nhelp through the CCC Assistance Scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are proceeding with the tax changes while\r\n\r\nbuffering  their  impact  on Singaporeans,  in  order  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  ourselves to compete in this  very  difficult\r\n\r\nenvironment.     I   understand   and   empathise    with\r\n\r\nSingaporeans'  worries  over the  economic  and  regional\r\n\r\noutlook,  especially in the wake of the recent  terrorist\r\n\r\nattack in Bali.  We cannot, however, avoid tightening our\r\n\r\nbelts and cutting back on less essential spending.  But I\r\n\r\nassure  Members  that the Government will  do  everything\r\n\r\nnecessary  to help Singaporeans tide over this  difficult\r\n\r\nperiod, especially lower-income families in genuine need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to predict with any certainty now\r\n\r\nwhat  next  year will bring.

The\r\n\r\nsuccess in this vital task over the years has resulted in\r\n\r\na  corruption-free public service and has made  Singapore\r\n\r\nattractive to foreign investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognition of the vital role played by the\r\n\r\ninvestigation officers in CPIB, the salary schemes of the\r\n\r\njunior   and   senior  Corrupt  Practices   Investigation\r\n\r\nOfficers have been pegged to the junior and senior Police\r\n\r\nOfficer  schemes  respectively in  order  to  make  their\r\n\r\nsalary terms attractive enough to recruit and retain good\r\n\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen  the  Ministry  of Home Affairs  Uniformed  Services\r\n\r\n(HUS) implemented a superannuation scheme in the form  of\r\n\r\nan  HUS  Invest  Plan in October 2001,  CPIB  sought  and\r\n\r\nreceived  approval from the Public Service  Division  and\r\n\r\nthe Finance Ministry to implement a similar scheme to the\r\n\r\nCPIB Investigation Officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed superannuation scheme for the junior\r\n\r\nand senior Corrupt Practices Investigation Officers would\r\n\r\nprovide for the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Lowering of the current compulsory retirement\r\n\r\nage  from  62  to  55  years for both junior  and  senior\r\n\r\nofficers; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Implementing a CPIB Invest Plan to build up a\r\n\r\nsuperannuation fund to help them transit out  of  service\r\n\r\nearlier than other civil servants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale for the CPIB Invest Plan for the CPIB\r\n\r\nofficers  is  similar  to  that  for  the  Home   Affairs\r\n\r\nUniformed Officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retirement age for the new CPIB officers has\r\n\r\nbeen lowered from 62 to 55 years because they need to  be\r\n\r\nphysically fit, agile and alert, especially when  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  suspects who resist arrests.  There are a few desk-bound  officers in CPIB to which the older  investigating\r\n\r\nofficers could be re-deployed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exemption under the Retirement Age Act has already\r\n\r\nbeen  obtained from 1st November 2001 to provide for  the\r\n\r\nnew  CPIB  officers to retire at the age of 55.   Serving\r\n\r\nofficers  can  choose to opt into the new  superannuation\r\n\r\nscheme  with  the  lowering of the compulsory  retirement\r\n\r\nage.   The  CPIB  Invest  Plan under  the  superannuation\r\n\r\nscheme  will  have  to be implemented with  retrospective\r\n\r\neffect  from  1st  November  2001,  in  tandem  with  the\r\n\r\neffective date of the lowering of the retirement age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mechanism of the CPIB Invest Plan is also\r\n\r\nsimilar  to that of the HUS Invest Plan.  Apart from  the\r\n\r\nfull  CPF contributions, CPIB will, under the CPIB Invest\r\n\r\nPlan, contribute an amount based on the percentage of the\r\n\r\nofficer's  monthly salary into a Retirement Account  kept\r\n\r\nfor the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nofficer,  which is 6% monthly for both junior and  senior\r\n\r\nCPIB officers starting from the 7th year of service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, junior officers will receive retention\r\n\r\npayments  in a separate Retention Account.  The retention\r\n\r\npayments  will  be credited into the officer's  Retention\r\n\r\nAccount  on  satisfactory  completion  of  each  year  of\r\n\r\nservice  during the officer's first 10 years of  service.\r\n\r\nThe  payment  is  one month of salary for  each  year  of\r\n\r\nservice  during the first six years.  In the 7th  to  the\r\n\r\n10th year, this payment increases to 1.5 months of salary\r\n\r\nfor each completed year of service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funds in the officers' Retirement and Retention\r\n\r\nAccounts  will be pooled to form an invest fund known  as\r\n\r\nthe  CPIB  Invest  Fund.  The CPIB Invest  Fund  will  be\r\n\r\nmanaged  by professional fund managers.  Based on returns\r\n\r\nfrom  investments,  dividends will be credited  into  the\r\n\r\nindividual accounts of the officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accumulated amounts in the CPIB Invest Accounts\r\n\r\ncan  be withdrawn by the officers progressively.  If  the\r\n\r\nofficer resigns prematurely, CPIB will retain part of the\r\n\r\namount  in the officer's account.  The officer  can  only\r\n\r\nwithdraw the full amount in his account if he serves  the\r\n\r\nfull  career with CPIB when he retires at the age of  55.\r\n\r\nCPIB  expects the progressive withdrawal feature  of  the\r\n\r\nCPIB  Invest Plan to enhance retention, thus  helping  to\r\n\r\nattract  good  quality officers to join and  remain  with\r\n\r\nCPIB for a full career.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it would not be cost effective for CPIB to set up\r\n\r\na  special  machinery  to manage  the  CPIB  Invest  Fund\r\n\r\nbecause  of the small approved establishment of  62,  the\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs Ministry has acceded to CPIB's  request  to\r\n\r\npool  the  CPIB Invest Fund with the HUS Invest Fund  for\r\n\r\nmanagement  by the HUS Board of Trustees.  The  Director,\r\n\r\nCPIB, would be made a member of the Board of Trustees  to\r\n\r\noversee  the interest of the CPIB officers.   This  would\r\n\r\nrequire  consequential amendments  to  the  Home  Affairs\r\n\r\nUniformed Services Superannuation Act 2001 and associated\r\n\r\nRegulations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Home Affairs Ministry is\r\n\r\ntaking   the  opportunity  to  amend  the  Home   Affairs\r\n\r\nUniformed  Services Superannuation Act 2001 to offer  the\r\n\r\nHUS Invest Plan to junior intelligence officers recruited\r\n\r\nfrom  outside the Home Team.  Previously, the HUS  Invest\r\n\r\nPlan was only available to intelligence officers who were\r\n\r\nalready  the HUS Invest Plan members in their  respective\r\n\r\nHome  Team  Departments  before they  were  appointed  as\r\n\r\nintelligence  officers.   The  proposed  amendments  give\r\n\r\nsimilar terms to what is available for officers appointed\r\n\r\nto  other Home Team Departments, that is, the HUS  Invest\r\n\r\nPlan   can  also  be  offered  to  intelligence  officers\r\n\r\nrecruited from other departments in the civil service, or\r\n\r\nfrom the open market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill will provide for the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The legislative framework under the Prevention\r\n\r\nof  Corruption Act for CPIB to implement the CPIB  Invest\r\n\r\nPlan;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Amendment of the Home Affairs Uniformed\r\n\r\nServices  Superannuation  Act 2001  to  provide  for  the\r\n\r\nmanagement of the CPIB Invest Fund;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Amendment of the Pension Fund Act to allow for\r\n\r\nthe  accrued  pension  benefits of the  CPIB  pensionable\r\n\r\nofficers  who have opted for the CPIB Invest Plan  to  be\r\n\r\ntransferred  from  the Pension Fund to  the  CPIB  Invest\r\n\r\nFund;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Amendment of the Home Affairs Uniformed\r\n\r\nServices Superannuation Act 2001 to offer the HUS  Invest\r\n\r\nPlan  to  junior  intelligence  officers  recruited  from\r\n\r\noutside the Home Team.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ESTATE DUTY (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Budget speech this year, the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and Minister for Finance announced a series  of\r\n\r\nmeasures to promote the spirit of philanthropy among  our\r\n\r\npeople.  One of these measures requires a change  in  the\r\n\r\nEstate  Duty  Act.   With effect from 1st  January  2002,\r\n\r\nadministrators and families of deceased individuals  will\r\n\r\nbe  allowed to donate the estate of their next-of-kin  to\r\n\r\nInstitutions of Public Character (IPC) and the  value  of\r\n\r\nthe donation will be exempt from estate duty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to this change, it was possible to apply for\r\n\r\nexemption from estate duty for such donations on a  case-by-case  basis.  But to make the process less  cumbersome\r\n\r\nand more transparent, donations from estates to IPCs will\r\n\r\nbe  exempted automatically as soon as they are made on or\r\n\r\nafter 1st January 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment to the Act is a policy change\r\n\r\nintroduced to encourage more foreigners to hold Singapore\r\n\r\ndollar  denominated  assets.  A non-domiciled  individual\r\n\r\nwho passes away on or after 1st January 2002 will not  be\r\n\r\nsubject  to  estate  duty on the  value  of  his  movable\r\n\r\nassets.   This  is  an initiative to improve  Singapore's\r\n\r\nposition as an international private banking centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last two amendments in this Bill are\r\n\r\nconsequential non-budget related amendments to  the  Act.\r\n\r\nFirst,  the  term \"National Museum\" in the  Act  will  be\r\n\r\nreplaced  by \"Approved Museums\" as the \"National  Museum\"\r\n\r\nis  no  longer in existence.  Secondly, the administrator\r\n\r\nof  the  Technopreneur Home Office  (THO)  Scheme  is  no\r\n\r\nlonger the National Science and Technology Board but  the\r\n\r\nEconomic Development Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, thank you for allowing me to speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The move to refine the Estate Duty Act by amending\r\n\r\nsection  11  to provide that estate duty be  exempted  in\r\n\r\nrespect of any movable property passing on the death of a\r\n\r\nperson  dying on or after 1st of January 2002 who is  not\r\n\r\ndomiciled  in  Singapore at the time  of  his  death,  is\r\n\r\nlaudable, as it will encourage foreigners to invest  more\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is necessary to draw more expatriates to\r\n\r\nput  their money into our banking sector, we should  also\r\n\r\nbear  in  mind  the  effects of the Estate  Duty  Act  on\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  While foreigners are building their wealth\r\n\r\nwith  no  fear  of  having  to  pay  estate  duty,  those\r\n\r\ndomiciled in Singapore have to prepare for another  round\r\n\r\nof  taxes  on  their estate before the beneficiaries  are\r\n\r\nable  to  receive the proceeds.  As we aspire to  improve\r\n\r\nour economic well-being, more and more citizens may reach\r\n\r\nthe  tax  range of the Estate Duty Act, as their  assets,\r\n\r\nboth  movable and immovable, build up over their lifetime\r\n\r\nand,  in  the  course of which, they already  pay  taxes.\r\n\r\nHaving  to  levy  estate duty on top of that  is  a  very\r\n\r\ntraumatic  way for the Government to raise money  from  a\r\n\r\nfamily  which, while suffering from the loss of  a  loved\r\n\r\none,  also has to cope with the uncalled for hardship  to\r\n\r\npay  estate  duty.  This is especially so in a  depressed\r\n\r\nmarket and the family suddenly has to sell its assets  to\r\n\r\nraise cash to pay the estate duty, plus interest on  late\r\n\r\npayments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it can also be said that most people do not have\r\n\r\nto  worry about estate duty, as there is an exemption  of\r\n\r\n$600,000  in  respect  of the deceased's  movable  assets\r\n\r\nwhich  include CPF money, plus an exemption of $9 million\r\n\r\nin  respect of all dwelling houses.  Thus, if during  his\r\n\r\nlifetime, a person plans his estate in such a manner that\r\n\r\nwhat  he  leaves  behind  is within  the  limits  of  the\r\n\r\nexemption granted,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis  estate would not have to pay any duty.  However, the\r\n\r\nfact remains that the surviving family members will still\r\n\r\nbe required to file a return to prove that the deceased's\r\n\r\nestate is fully exempted from estate duty.  And that is a\r\n\r\nlong tedious process by itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 35 of the Act requires the personal\r\n\r\nrepresentative to file particulars relating  to  all  the\r\n\r\nproperties of the deceased, including the value  thereof,\r\n\r\nin respect of which estate duty is payable.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nunder  the Estate Duty Act, the Commissioner is empowered\r\n\r\nto  assess the estate of a deceased person, even when  no\r\n\r\nestate  duty  return  is filed.  In  the  meanwhile,  the\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries,  if  dependent on  the  deceased's  money,\r\n\r\ncould not use it for their day-to-day purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong for a taxpayer to pass his\r\n\r\nassets  on  to his loved ones without being taxed  again.\r\n\r\nHence, many are at a loss as to why such a discriminatory\r\n\r\ntaxation   law   still  exists  when  the   majority   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans has been spared such an ordeal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which may be of interest in\r\n\r\ndetermining  the benefits of keeping the  law  on  estate\r\n\r\nduty  is  the  question  of the  amount  of  estate  duty\r\n\r\ncollected  each  year,  as  compared  to  the   cost   of\r\n\r\ncollecting it.  If the sums collected do not justify  the\r\n\r\ncost  incurred,  and  if  the  amount  is  negligible  as\r\n\r\ncompared  to  other  forms of taxes, then  we  should  be\r\n\r\nlooking  at also extending section 11 of the Estate  Duty\r\n\r\nAct  to  resident  taxpayers who are Singaporeans.   This\r\n\r\nwill  help  alleviate the burden of taxes on  those  with\r\n\r\nsubstantial  movable assets that are above the  exemption\r\n\r\nlimit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should have tax laws that not only\r\n\r\nencourage  the  creation of wealth  but  also  discourage\r\n\r\nmeasures  taken in avoiding estate duty, especially  when\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have to resort to transferring their  wealth\r\n\r\nto  other  countries like Malaysia, India and  Australia,\r\n\r\nwhere estate duty has been abolished.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the amendment with the\r\n\r\nhope that this action by the Government will be the start\r\n\r\nof  a series of bold steps to examine the Estate Duty Act\r\n\r\nagain  and,  perhaps,  at the next Budget  exercise,  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans can look forward to the day when they can be\r\n\r\nspared  the  trauma of having to live with this  form  of\r\n\r\noutmoded tax law.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr Andy\r\n\r\nGan  for  his  comments.  I think there are three  issues\r\n\r\nthat he raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a very fundamental issue, is should there be\r\n\r\nestate duty in Singapore.  This is a continuing debate  - whether  or not we should have a death tax regime.   Most\r\n\r\ncountries  do have it - the UK, USA, Hong Kong,  Ireland.\r\n\r\nThey  have  either inheritance tax or estate duty.   Some\r\n\r\ncountries do not have an inheritance tax or estate  duty,\r\n\r\nbut they have a gift tax, ie, those who receive them have\r\n\r\nto  pay a tax on the gifts that they are given.  So  this\r\n\r\nis  a  fundamental issue:  when somebody  builds  up  the\r\n\r\nwealth  and  you  transfer the wealth as an  inheritance,\r\n\r\nwhether that should be taxed.  As I said, a few countries\r\n\r\nhave  dispensed  with this tax, but the majority  of  tax\r\n\r\nregimes  still  continue  with  this  tax.   So  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to review this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is whether or not we should treat\r\n\r\nimmovables  and movables differently.  In Singapore,  our\r\n\r\nestate  duty  is  already  very benign.   Immovables  are\r\n\r\nexempted up to $9 million, ie, if you have properties  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  only  properties above $9  million  would  be\r\n\r\nsubject  to  estate  duty.  For movables,  the  exemption\r\n\r\nlimit  is  $600,000.   The exemption limit  for  movables\r\n\r\ncovers  both  movables in Singapore as  well  as  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.  So it is not true that Singaporeans can avoid\r\n\r\nestate  duty  by  investing  in  movable  assets  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The tax treatment for movables  is  anything\r\n\r\nabove   $600,000,  both  within  Singapore  and   outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.  So, that is the second clarification I  would\r\n\r\nlike to make.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third clarification is how do we treat people\r\n\r\nwho  are not domiciled in Singapore.  That is section  11\r\n\r\nthat  Mr  Andy  Gan refers to.  For people  who  are  not\r\n\r\ndomiciled  in  Singapore,  the estate  duty  only  covers\r\n\r\nimmovables  in Singapore, because we want  to  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  foreigners who buy property, the property  will  be\r\n\r\nsubject  to  a  tax  above  the  exemption  limit.    But\r\n\r\nforeigners  who are not domiciled in Singapore  are  only\r\n\r\ntaxed  for movables within Singapore.  So they could  put\r\n\r\ntheir  movables  outside Singapore,  and  that  would  be\r\n\r\noutside  the  ambit  of our tax.  So, to  encourage  such\r\n\r\nforeigners  not to keep their movables outside  Singapore\r\n\r\nbut  to  encourage  them to invest  in  Singapore  dollar\r\n\r\ndenominated assets, this is the reason for the section 11\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why we are making this change with\r\n\r\nrespect to foreigners is because, for foreigners, we  are\r\n\r\nalready  not  taxing them on movables outside  Singapore.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we are now also exempting them on movables  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  so that it is a level playing field,  and  we\r\n\r\nhope  that they will in fact invest in Singapore  assets.\r\n\r\nThat is the reason for the change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I take note of Mr Andy Gan's comments, and I am\r\n\r\nsure this whole debate on estate duty will continue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PROPERTY TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill will amend the Property\r\n\r\nTax  Act  to  give  legislative effect to  the  following\r\n\r\nmeasures:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) To change the billing cycle for property tax\r\n\r\nfrom twice a year to once a year in January;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) To abolish the practice of opening up the\r\n\r\nValuation  list,  in  the month  of  August,  for  public\r\n\r\ninspection and objection;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) To allow taxpayers to lodge objections on the\r\n\r\nannual  value of their properties at any time within  the\r\n\r\ncurrent year;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) To allow the Comptroller to impose a penalty\r\n\r\nnot  exceeding  5% of the amount of outstanding  property\r\n\r\ntax  immediately upon the expiration of the  time  period\r\n\r\nstipulated for payment; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) To establish a Street and Building Names Board\r\n\r\nwhich  will determine or alter the name of any  building,\r\n\r\nestate or street.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now explain the main amendments in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, property tax is payable half-yearly in\r\n\r\nadvance in the months of January and July.  Clause  3  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  amends section 6(2) of the Act to provide  for\r\n\r\nproperty  tax to be payable yearly in advance in January.\r\n\r\nProperty  tax  bills will then be sent out  only  once  a\r\n\r\nyear.  This will bring about cost and manpower savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxpayers paying their property tax through GIRO\r\n\r\nwill  not  be affected, as they are already paying  their\r\n\r\nproperty tax payments in 12 equal, interest-free, monthly\r\n\r\ninstalments.  Hence, IRAS will encourage those  taxpayers\r\n\r\ncurrently paying their tax by cash or cheque to pay their\r\n\r\ntax  through  GIRO  by sending them a package  containing\r\n\r\ninformation of how to effect payment through GIRO.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment is on objections to the\r\n\r\nValuation  List.  Currently, the Valuation List  for  the\r\n\r\nensuing  year  is  open  to  the  public  in  August  for\r\n\r\ninspection.  Any owner aggrieved by the inclusion in  the\r\n\r\nValuation  List  of any property or by the  annual  value\r\n\r\nascribed to a property may, at any time within the period\r\n\r\nallowed for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninspection  of  the Valuation List, write  to  the  Chief\r\n\r\nAssessor to object.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As taxpayers are informed of the annual values of\r\n\r\ntheir  properties  through their property  tax  bills  or\r\n\r\nvaluation  notices,  there is  no  need  to  publish  the\r\n\r\nValuation List for the public to inspect.  Thus, clause 5\r\n\r\nof the Bill removes this practice.  Clause 7 introduces a\r\n\r\nnew section 20A to the Act, which will allow taxpayers to\r\n\r\nobject  to  the Chief Assessor with regard to the  annual\r\n\r\nvalues  ascribed to their properties at any time  of  the\r\n\r\nyear.    If  the  Chief  Assessor  rejects  a  taxpayer's\r\n\r\nobjection,  the taxpayer may proceed to lodge  an  appeal\r\n\r\nwith  the  Valuation Review Board within 21 days  of  the\r\n\r\nservice  of the notice of the Chief Assessor's  decision.\r\n\r\nThis   amendment  effectively  gives  the  taxpayer  more\r\n\r\nflexibility to lodge an objection to the annual values of\r\n\r\ntheir properties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next change is on the penalty for non-payment of\r\n\r\ntax.   Under the current Act, if the property tax remains\r\n\r\nunpaid  at the end of January or July, a notice would  be\r\n\r\nserved on the person liable.  The taxpayer is required to\r\n\r\npay  the  outstanding tax and a fee for the cost  of  the\r\n\r\nnotice within 15 days from the service of the notice.   A\r\n\r\npenalty  may only be imposed upon the expiration  of  the\r\n\r\nrequisite 15 days.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage property owners to pay their taxes on\r\n\r\ntime, clause 16 introduces a new section 36 to the Act to\r\n\r\nimpose  a penalty at the point the payment is due  rather\r\n\r\nthan  upon expiration of the notice demanding payment  of\r\n\r\noutstanding tax. The penalty will be capped at 5% of  the\r\n\r\namount   of  outstanding  property  tax.   However,   the\r\n\r\nComptroller  will be given the discretion  to  waive  the\r\n\r\npenalty   imposed  on  late  payment  where   there   are\r\n\r\nexceptional circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Street and Building Names Board (SBNB).\r\n\r\nCurrently,  the  Minister for Finance  has  authority  to\r\n\r\ndetermine or change the name of any street, building  and\r\n\r\nestate.  He is assisted in this task by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan   advisory  committee.  In  practice,  most   of   the\r\n\r\napplications  for  names submitted to the  committee  are\r\n\r\nstraightforward,  and  the  committee's   recommendations\r\n\r\ncould  be accepted without any amendment.  Hence,  clause\r\n\r\n18  amends section 49 of the Act to establish the  Street\r\n\r\nand  Building  Names Board and to vest in the  Board  the\r\n\r\nauthority to determine or alter the names of any  street,\r\n\r\nbuilding  and  estate.  The Chairman and members  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard  will  be  appointed by the Minister  for  Finance.\r\n\r\nThere  will  also be an avenue to appeal to the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance, against decisions made by the Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill amends the Arms and Explosives Act to\r\n\r\ngive  effect to the Convention on the Marking of  Plastic\r\n\r\nExplosives for the Purpose of Detection.  As the Act  was\r\n\r\nlast  reviewed  in 1973, my Ministry has also  taken  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to fine-tune some provisions to keep them  up\r\n\r\nto  date.   I  shall first cover the amendments  to  give\r\n\r\neffect  to  the  Convention on  the  Marking  of  Plastic\r\n\r\nExplosives for the Purpose of Detection.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Convention  on  Marking  of Plastic  Explosives  for  the Purpose of Detection</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Convention addresses the need to mark plastic\r\n\r\nexplosives  for  the  purpose  of  detection.    Unmarked\r\n\r\nplastic explosives are hard to detect because they elude\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nx-rays,  as  well  as  metal and most  vapour  detectors.\r\n\r\nMarking  plastic explosives enables vapour  detectors  to\r\n\r\npick up the presence of such explosives. This Convention,\r\n\r\nconcluded  in 1991, was set against the backdrop  of  the\r\n\r\nblowing  up  of  Pan Am flight 103 in  the  air  on  21st\r\n\r\nDecember  1988.   The British Air Accident  Investigation\r\n\r\nBranch  concluded  that  the  crash  was  caused  by   an\r\n\r\nexplosive  device that was intentionally detonated  while\r\n\r\nthe plane was in flight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is acceding to the Convention to show our\r\n\r\nsupport for the fight against terrorism.  This Convention\r\n\r\nprotects  international civil aviation by  requiring  the\r\n\r\nmarking  of  plastic explosives for detection  so  as  to\r\n\r\nprevent  the  use of such explosives for  terrorists  and\r\n\r\nother  unlawful purposes.  In acceding to the Convention,\r\n\r\nwe  join  85  other  countries which  are  already  State\r\n\r\nParties  to  the  Convention  to  combat  terrorism.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  Singapore has already acceded  to  four  other\r\n\r\ninternational  conventions on  civil  aviation  security,\r\n\r\nnamely, the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts\r\n\r\nCommitted  on  Board  Aircraft, the  Convention  for  the\r\n\r\nSuppression   of  Unlawful  Seizure  of   Aircraft,   the\r\n\r\nConvention  for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts  against\r\n\r\nthe  Safety  of Civil Aviation and the 1988 Protocol  for\r\n\r\nthe  Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports\r\n\r\nServing International Civil Aviation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendments to Give Effect to the Convention</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key obligations of the Convention are for State\r\n\r\nParties to adopt measures to prohibit the manufacture  of\r\n\r\nunmarked plastic explosives and to impose strict  control\r\n\r\nover  the  movement of such explosives.   The  Convention\r\n\r\nalso requires State Parties to destroy, consume, mark  or\r\n\r\nrender  permanently  ineffective all stocks  of  unmarked\r\n\r\nplastic  explosives  within  3  years,  if  not  held  by\r\n\r\nmilitary  or police authorities, and within 15 years,  if\r\n\r\nheld by military or police authorities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amends the Act by inserting a\r\n\r\ndefinition of an \"unmarked\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplastic explosive\" as any plastic explosive that does not\r\n\r\ncontain  a detection agent.  A detection agent means  any\r\n\r\nsubstance  that enhances the detectability of  explosives\r\n\r\nby   vapour  detection  means.  Clause  23  of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nintroduces a new Schedule that lists the detection agents\r\n\r\nand specifies the minimum concentration level that should\r\n\r\nbe present in plastic explosives.  Clause 20 introduces a\r\n\r\nnew  section to empower the Minister for Home Affairs  to\r\n\r\namend the Schedule by order published in the Gazette.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to meet the obligations under the Convention,\r\n\r\nclause 4 of the Bill makes it an offence for a person  to\r\n\r\nmanufacture, possess, transfer, import or export unmarked\r\n\r\nplastic  explosives.  A person convicted of any of  these\r\n\r\noffences  would  be  sentenced to a  fine  not  exceeding\r\n\r\n$10,000  and imprisonment for a term not exceeding  three\r\n\r\nyears.   Exceptions  to  this  are  made,  however,   for\r\n\r\nunmarked   plastic  explosives  used  for  research   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  testing, training or for  forensic  science\r\n\r\nactivities.   Exceptions  are also  made  for  authorised\r\n\r\nmilitary  and police personnel to destroy, consume,  mark\r\n\r\nor  render permanently ineffective the existing stock  of\r\n\r\nunmarked  plastic  explosives  within  15  years  of  the\r\n\r\nConvention  coming into force.  These grace periods  will\r\n\r\nallow  time  for  the existing stock of unmarked  plastic\r\n\r\nexplosives to be destroyed, consumed, marked or  rendered\r\n\r\npermanently  ineffective.  These exceptions  are  all  in\r\n\r\naccordance with the Convention.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendments to update the Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now briefly outline other\r\n\r\namendments  to fine-tune the existing provisions  in  the\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Definition of \"Arms\" to include \"Noxious Substance\"</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Act defines \"arms\" as including\r\n\r\nfirearms, automatic guns, and any other kind of gun  from\r\n\r\nwhich any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged\r\n\r\nor noxious fumes emitted.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  current definition does not include guns  which  can\r\n\r\ndischarge  noxious substances which are  non-gaseous  but\r\n\r\ncould  also  produce a noxious effect.   For  example,  a\r\n\r\npepper  spray  discharges noxious  substances  and  falls\r\n\r\noutside the existing definition of \"arms\" under the  Act.\r\n\r\nClause  2 of the Bill addresses this by amending the  Act\r\n\r\nto  include  \"noxious  substance\" in  the  definition  of\r\n\r\n\"arms\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Manufacture, Dealing in and Export of Noxious Substance</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the inclusion of noxious substance, clause 6 of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  amends  the  Act to make  it  an  offence  for\r\n\r\nunauthorised possession, manufacture, import  and  export\r\n\r\nof noxious substances.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Appointment of Licensing and Assistant Licensing Officers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Act currently empowers the Minister to\r\n\r\nappoint  a  Licensing  Authority.  Over  the  years,  the\r\n\r\nworkload   of  the  Licensing  Authority  has   increased\r\n\r\nsubstantially.  Clause 7 of the Bill therefore amends the\r\n\r\nAct   to   empower  the  Minister  to  appoint  Assistant\r\n\r\nLicensing  Officers  to  assist  the  Licensing  Officer.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  Licensing  Officer  will  remain   overall\r\n\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Deposit of Guns, Arms or Explosives</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, any person whose licence to possess\r\n\r\na  gun,  arms  or  explosive  has  expired  or  has  been\r\n\r\ncancelled or suspended, is required to deposit  the  gun,\r\n\r\narms or explosives at a Police station.  This arrangement\r\n\r\nis  not satisfactory.  Police resources are unnecessarily\r\n\r\ntied  up  to  receive and safekeep such  guns,  arms  and\r\n\r\nexplosives when it could be better utilised in performing\r\n\r\nPolice   core  functions.   The  Police  will   therefore\r\n\r\noutsource  the  receipt and safekeeping function  to  the\r\n\r\nCommercial  and  Industrial Security Corporation  (CISCO)\r\n\r\nwhich has the capability to perform this task.  Clause  9\r\n\r\nof the Bill amends the Act to require any person\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhose  licence  to possess a gun, arms or  explosive  has\r\n\r\nexpired,  or has been cancelled or suspended  to  deposit\r\n\r\nthe  gun,  arms  or  explosive with CISCO  or  any  other\r\n\r\nauxiliary  police  force  which  is  authorised  by   the\r\n\r\nLicensing Officer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Forfeiture of Guns, Arms and Explosives</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act currently provides that any gun, arms or\r\n\r\nexplosive   which   is  deposited  with   the   Licensing\r\n\r\nAuthority, if not claimed by its owner within six  months\r\n\r\nfrom  the date of the deposit, shall be forfeited to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   Clause 10 of the Bill  amends  the  Act  by\r\n\r\nreplacing  the  Licensing Authority  with  the  Licensing\r\n\r\nOfficer  and  CISCO or any other auxiliary  police  force\r\n\r\nwhich is authorised by the Licensing Officer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Possession and Use of Arms by Schools and Clubs</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 of the Bill amends the Act to empower the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Home Affairs to make rules to regulate  the\r\n\r\npossession  and use of arms, namely, air rifles  held  by\r\n\r\nschools  and  shotguns  and pistols  held  by  clubs  for\r\n\r\nsporting activities.  It also exempts any school or  club\r\n\r\nfrom  the requirement of a licence, subject to prescribed\r\n\r\nconditions.   Currently, without the power to  make  such\r\n\r\nrules,  schools and clubs have to be subject to  all  the\r\n\r\nrequirements under the Act.  For example, if a school  or\r\n\r\nclub intends to acquire arms for sporting activities,  it\r\n\r\nhas  to  first  obtain a licence to  purchase  the  arms.\r\n\r\nHaving  purchased the arms, the school  or  club  has  to\r\n\r\napply  and  obtain a licence to possess the arms.   Also,\r\n\r\neach  time the arms are transported out of the school  or\r\n\r\nclub   to  another  location  for  a  competition,  prior\r\n\r\napproval has to be obtained from the Licensing Officer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 is therefore intended to allow rules to be\r\n\r\nmade to reduce the administrative work and the number  of\r\n\r\nlicences that a school or club needs to obtain to acquire\r\n\r\narms  for sporting purposes.  However, let me assure  the\r\n\r\nHouse that the streamlining of administrative work and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexemption from having to obtain certain licences will not\r\n\r\nundermine the safekeeping and proper custody of  arms  by\r\n\r\nschools and clubs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Power to Search Vessels or Aircraft while in any Port or Airport</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, the Act provides that the Port\r\n\r\nMaster  and  Licensing Authority may search  or  issue  a\r\n\r\nsearch warrant to search any vessel or aircraft about  to\r\n\r\nleave any port of Singapore, if it is suspected of having\r\n\r\non  board  illegal guns, arms or explosives.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nAirport  Police  and  the  Police  Coast  Guard  who  are\r\n\r\nactivated to conduct the search.  Clause 17 of  the  Bill\r\n\r\ntherefore  amends the Act to extend the power  of  search\r\n\r\nand  issuance of search warrants to the Commander of  the\r\n\r\nAirport  Police  and the Commander of  the  Police  Coast\r\n\r\nGuard.  Clause 17 of the Bill also amends the Act to make\r\n\r\nit  clear  that  any vessel in the port, aircraft  in  or\r\n\r\nabout  to  leave any airport of Singapore may be searched\r\n\r\nif  it  is  suspected  of having illegal  guns,  arms  or\r\n\r\nexplosives on board.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Repeal of section 17</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 of the Bill repeals section 17 of the Act.\r\n\r\nSection  17  provides that a permit must be  obtained  to\r\n\r\nland  any guns or arms for transhipment by any vessel  or\r\n\r\naircraft arriving at any port of Singapore.  However,  in\r\n\r\npractice,  the  cargo handler acting  on  behalf  of  the\r\n\r\nvessel and aircraft would have already obtained an import\r\n\r\nand  export  permit  which covers the  transportation  of\r\n\r\nguns,  arms  and  explosives.  Section  17  is  therefore\r\n\r\nredundant.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendments to penalties</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, clauses 6, 12 to 16 and 22 of the Bill\r\n\r\namend  the  Act  by  increasing the  existing  fines  for\r\n\r\nvarious  offences by between three and 10  times.   These\r\n\r\noffences include unauthorised manufacture, possession  or\r\n\r\nimport  of guns, arms, explosives, poisonous and  noxious\r\n\r\nsubstances.

This Bill addresses changes  that  impact\r\n\r\nCPF savings arising from this move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, when HDB grants mortgage loans, it has\r\n\r\nfirst  priority  or charge over sale proceeds  from  such\r\n\r\nflats.   The  CPF Board has second charge if CPF  savings\r\n\r\nhave  been  used to make payment towards the purchase  of\r\n\r\nthe  flat.   This means that when the flat is  sold,  HDB\r\n\r\nwill   first  deduct  the  amount  owed  to  it,   before\r\n\r\ntransferring  any  balance  back  to  the  member's   CPF\r\n\r\naccount.   From 1st January 2003, the lending banks  will\r\n\r\nhave  first  charge  when they grant loans  to  HDB  flat\r\n\r\nbuyers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To secure the refund of monies due to CPF, the CPF\r\n\r\nBoard would have to lodge a charge with the Registrar  of\r\n\r\nTitles  for  each HDB flat purchased with bank-originated\r\n\r\nloans.   However,  this would lead  to  higher  cost  and\r\n\r\nlonger  processing time for the release of  members'  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings for the purchase of flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid these problems, clause 7 of the Bill\r\n\r\ninserts  a new section 21B to create an automatic  charge\r\n\r\non  an  HDB  flat in favour of CPF Board  when  a  member\r\n\r\nwithdraws  CPF  savings to purchase or  upgrade  the  HDB\r\n\r\nflat.  It also confers on the CPF Board the power of sale\r\n\r\nto  recover the CPF savings used for the flat, as is  the\r\n\r\ncase for private properties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the automatic charge, there exists the\r\n\r\npossibility that the need to refund CPF savings  used  by\r\n\r\nthe seller could be overlooked during the transactions of\r\n\r\nHDB  flats,  especially when HDB is no longer  an  active\r\n\r\nintermediary   in  flats  purchased  with   bank   loans.\r\n\r\nHowever,  with due diligence by the parties'  lawyers  to\r\n\r\nensure that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntitle  of  the flat is passed on to the buyers free  from\r\n\r\nall  encumbrances, including the return of  the  sellers'\r\n\r\nCPF, there will be no need for CPF Board to exercise  the\r\n\r\npower of sale which, in any event, will be used only as a\r\n\r\nlast resort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For HDB flats purchased with bank-originated loans,\r\n\r\nthe  priority ranking of the CPF charge is as  listed  in\r\n\r\nthe  circulated Table (Cols. 1479-1480), and I will leave\r\n\r\nit  to Members to peruse this.  Essentially, the bank has\r\n\r\nthe first claim, and the CPF follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20021031/20021031-HA-0751479.htm\">Table 1 - Priority of claim</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Implementation of Electronic Submission and Payment of CPF Contributions by Large Employers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to implementation of electronic\r\n\r\nsubmission  and  payment  of CPF contributions  by  large\r\n\r\nemployers.    Employers   can   currently   submit    CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions and payments manually or electronically and\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  Board does not impose any processing fee.   All\r\n\r\npublic sector employers pay CPF through electronic means.\r\n\r\nThe   corresponding  figure  for  larger  private  sector\r\n\r\nemployers, ie, those with 100 or more employees, is  94%.\r\n\r\nDespite the obvious savings through electronic submission\r\n\r\nand  CPF  Board's promotional efforts, a  remnant  6%  of\r\n\r\nlarger  private employers continue to submit and pay  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions manually.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage all employers to submit and pay CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions  electronically,  clause  10  of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nenables  the  CPF  Board  to  prescribe  regulations   to\r\n\r\nimplement   the   payment,  collection  and   refund   of\r\n\r\ncontributions  through electronic means and  empower  the\r\n\r\nMinister to prescribe such fees and charges that  may  be\r\n\r\nlevied for manual submissions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, the CPF Board will impose processing\r\n\r\nfees  on those larger companies which continue to utilise\r\n\r\nthe   manual  mode  after  1st  April  2003.    This   is\r\n\r\njustifiable as the Board has to incur\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreater cost to process manual submissions and payments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will monitor the progress of large\r\n\r\nemployers   going  into  e-modes  before   imposing   the\r\n\r\nprocessing fee on smaller employers.  Even then, we  will\r\n\r\ngive smaller employers sufficient time and assistance  to\r\n\r\nadjust  to  these  changes.   The  CPF  Board  will  also\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  explore  and  develop  means  to  make   e-submission and payment of CPF more convenient and  easier\r\n\r\nfor all employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Withdrawal of CPF after age 55</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, CPF members aged 55 years or older can\r\n\r\nwithdraw  their  CPF  savings at 3-year  intervals  after\r\n\r\nsetting aside the required Minimum Sum.  CPF members  who\r\n\r\nhave  not set aside the Minimum Sum can withdraw half  of\r\n\r\ntheir  savings at 3-year intervals, with the  other  half\r\n\r\nbeing used to top-up the Minimum Sum shortfall.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With greater operational efficiency, the Board is\r\n\r\nable  to  shorten  the interval period  for  withdrawals.\r\n\r\nClause 5 of the Bill, therefore, amends section 15(3)  to\r\n\r\nallow  withdrawals  at  1-year intervals  or  such  other\r\n\r\ninterval as the Minister may direct.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Voluntary Contributions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, preferential tax treatment is currently given\r\n\r\nto   compulsory  CPF  contributions  from  employer   and\r\n\r\nemployees,  including  voluntary contributions  from  the\r\n\r\nself-employed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is a need to encourage Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  save  for  retirement, CPF savings beyond  a  certain\r\n\r\nlimit  should  not be allowed to become  a  tax  shelter.\r\n\r\nVoluntary  CPF  contributions beyond  the  tax  exemption\r\n\r\nlimit  currently enjoy a less explicit tax benefit, which\r\n\r\nis  the  acronym TEE, ie, Taxable at contribution, Exempt\r\n\r\nduring accumulation and Exempt on withdrawal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4, therefore, amends section 13B of the CPF\r\n\r\nAct  to  limit  CPF  contributions made  by  a  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen   or  permanent  resident,  including   voluntary\r\n\r\ncontributions  paid by their employers, to the  mandatory\r\n\r\ncontribution amount, or the sum of $28,800 in  any  year,\r\n\r\nwhichever  is  the  higher.  The  amount  of  $28,800  is\r\n\r\nderived  from the 40% CPF contribution rate of  a  $6,000\r\n\r\nmonthly salary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy change affirms the fundamental objective\r\n\r\nof  CPF, which is to provide for basic retirement  needs.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and permanent residents who  wish  to  save\r\n\r\nmore  for  retirement  may  instead  contribute  to   the\r\n\r\nSupplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) which provides  tax\r\n\r\ndeferral benefits for voluntary contributions up  to  15%\r\n\r\nof one's income, subject to a salary ceiling of $6,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill also amends section 13B to\r\n\r\ndisallow voluntary CPF contributions by any person who is\r\n\r\nnot  a citizen or permanent resident of Singapore.   Such\r\n\r\nforeigners  already enjoy higher SRS  relief  of  35%  of\r\n\r\nincome,  as  compared to 15% for Singapore  citizens  and\r\n\r\npermanent  residents.  With this 35% benefit in  deferred\r\n\r\ntax  plus  50% exemption on tax at withdrawal offered  by\r\n\r\nSRS,  foreigners already have a tax-advantage vehicle  to\r\n\r\nsave  for  retirement.  We understand that some employers\r\n\r\ncurrently  contribute CPF voluntarily for  their  foreign\r\n\r\nemployees  working in Singapore.  From 1st January  2003,\r\n\r\nthese  employers are encouraged to adjust the  employees'\r\n\r\nremuneration package accordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also introduces other amendments to\r\n\r\nenhance  the  administration and operation   by  the  CPF\r\n\r\nBoard.  These include:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 to enable CPF Board to authorise any 2 of\r\n\r\nits  officers  to sign documents under seal,  instead  of\r\n\r\nrestricting  it  to only the General Manager  and  Deputy\r\n\r\nGeneral Managers;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 to change the title of the General Manager\r\n\r\nand  the  Deputy General Manager in the CPF Act to  chief\r\n\r\nexecutive officer and the deputy chief executive officers\r\n\r\naccordingly;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 to amend section 24 of the Act to clarify\r\n\r\nthat monies in any fixed deposit account maintained by  a\r\n\r\nmember with a bank under the CPF Investment Scheme or CPF\r\n\r\nMinimum Sum are protected; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 repeals and re-enacts section 66 to clarify\r\n\r\nthat  the  section also applies to the Board's  insurance\r\n\r\nfunds,   and  removes  the  need  to  gazette  authorised\r\n\r\nofficers who may be required to give evidence in court so\r\n\r\nlong as an officer is duly authorised by the Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker Sir, the amendments\r\n\r\nproposed  in  the  Bill will enable  the  return  of  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings upon sale of HDB flats which were purchased  with\r\n\r\nbank-originated  loans; facilitate electronic  submission\r\n\r\nand   payment   of   CPF  by  all  companies;   introduce\r\n\r\nflexibility on the interval of CPF withdrawals after  the\r\n\r\nage  of  55;  and  limit  the  amount  of  voluntary  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions.   The  amendments are  in  line  with  the\r\n\r\noverall objectives of the CPF system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key amendment in the Bill is the creation of an\r\n\r\nautomatic  charge on the HDB flats in favour of  the  CPF\r\n\r\nBoard when a CPF member withdraws CPF funds to finance or\r\n\r\nrefinance  the  purchase of the HDB flat.  These  changes\r\n\r\nare  part of the broader recommendation on the CPF  which\r\n\r\nthe  ERC  recommended, and they have already been debated\r\n\r\nin  Parliament.  I would thus not revisit  the  arguments\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to raise two key points\r\n\r\nrelated   to  the  amendment.   First,  consumption   and\r\n\r\ninvestments  in  housing.   A  key  thrust  of  the   ERC\r\n\r\nrecommendations  on CPF is the safeguarding  of  the  CPF\r\n\r\nfunds for retirement.  To do so, one of the strategies is\r\n\r\nto  safeguard  funds  withdrawn for housing  purposes  by\r\n\r\nlimiting  CPF withdrawals.  However, this point seems  to\r\n\r\nhave been lost amongst Singaporeans.  With the lower  10%\r\n\r\ncash downpayment, we see Singaporeans snapping up private\r\n\r\nproperties.  They do not seem deterred by the  fact  that\r\n\r\nthe banks now have the first charge on the mortgage loans\r\n\r\nthat they give.  I hope that beyond these amendments, the\r\n\r\nCPF  Board  and  the Government can do  more  to  educate\r\n\r\nSingaporeans on the impact of these changes on their  CPF\r\n\r\nand  their retirement savings.  This will certainly  help\r\n\r\nthem  better  plan their finances, including  consumption\r\n\r\nand investments in housing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is on the CPF default rate and\r\n\r\nelectronic submission.  The CPF (Amendment) Bill seeks to\r\n\r\nenable  the  CPF Board to implement electronic submission\r\n\r\nand payment of CPF contributions.  With e-submission, the\r\n\r\nCPF default rate by employers can be reduced further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on 6th September, the Business\r\n\r\nTimes reported that the CPF default rate had declined  in\r\n\r\nthe  second  quarter  of this year.   In  the  April-June\r\n\r\nperiod,  0.61%  of the employers defaulted  on  payments,\r\n\r\ncompared with 0.8% in January-March.  Although the figure\r\n\r\nis  low,  what  is worrying is that the  rate  had  risen\r\n\r\ngradually  over the last four quarters,  and  up  to  the\r\n\r\nsecond  quarter of this year.  I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister of State what the CPF Board is doing to  further\r\n\r\nreduce the default rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present CPF PAL-internet system enables\r\n\r\nemployers   to  submit  their  monthly  CPF  contribution\r\n\r\ndetails  to  the Board via the Internet 24 hours  a  day,\r\n\r\nseven  days a week.  All employers need to do is to  just\r\n\r\nregister with the Board and have a GIRO bank account.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  ask  the Board what  is  the  employers'\r\n\r\nresponse rate so far to the e-submission\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem and what more can be done to get more employers on\r\n\r\nboard, particularly the small and medium enterprises  who\r\n\r\ngenerally  employ  less than 100  workers.   I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinistry would consider more measures to provide  greater\r\n\r\nsupport and incentives to these smaller employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that by April next year, all employers\r\n\r\nwith  more  than  100 employees have to  go  for  the  e-submission  system.  However, I would like to  urge  that\r\n\r\nmore time should be given to the small businesses to make\r\n\r\nadjustments.  In the interim, I hope the CPF Board  could\r\n\r\nalso  consider providing the e-submission service at  the\r\n\r\nhead office and the branches for employers with less than\r\n\r\n100 employees, so that the small businesses, particularly\r\n\r\nthose who have difficulties and find it too costly to set\r\n\r\nup  a system, will still be able to learn how to use  the\r\n\r\nsystem, and eventually use e-submission, instead  of  the\r\n\r\ntraditional way of submitting CPF contributions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Suppose\r\n\r\na  Mr  Ong has decided to buy a HDB flat from a  Mr  Tan.\r\n\r\nThey  agree on a price and Mr Ong duly paid up the amount\r\n\r\nto Mr Tan either by cash, his CPF or a loan.  Thereafter,\r\n\r\none  would expect that Mr Ong would be able to move  into\r\n\r\nhis  dream  flat with peace of mind.  However, after  the\r\n\r\namendment  comes  into  force, things  might  not  be  so\r\n\r\nstraightforward anymore for Mr Ong.  Should Mr Tan decide\r\n\r\nto  pocket the money and he does not repay the charge due\r\n\r\nto the CPF Board, Mr Ong would be in deep trouble.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? Because with the amended legislation, the\r\n\r\nBoard  would come after Mr Ong for the flat,  never  mind\r\n\r\nthat  Mr  Ong is not the person who defaults the payment.\r\n\r\nAfter 60 days on expiry of the due date of the payment to\r\n\r\nCPF  Board,  the Board would put up a notice of  sale  to\r\n\r\ndeclare its intention to sell the flat.  Another 90  days\r\n\r\nhave  lapsed  and if Mr Tan still does not  pay  up,  the\r\n\r\nBoard  would  go  ahead  and sell the  flat  and  recover\r\n\r\nwhatever charges due to CPF Board.  As a result, Mr  Ong,\r\n\r\nthe  buyer, who has paid for the flat would lose his flat\r\n\r\nwhile Mr Tan, the culprit, would get away.  An analogy is\r\n\r\nlike  when  you are going to a shop to buy  a  packet  of\r\n\r\nrice,  but  because the shopowner did  not   pay  up  the\r\n\r\nsupplier, the supplier comes after you to take away  your\r\n\r\npacket  of rice to recover the debt which is owed by  the\r\n\r\nshop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very unfair to the buyers, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the Ministry, as the Chinese saying goes, has\r\n\r\nbecome \"hei bai bu fen\" (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), which means\r\n\r\nunable to differentiate the white from the black.  Or  if\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  simply takes the easy way  out,  yes,  the\r\n\r\nBoard  can just take the flat back, sell it, recover  the\r\n\r\ncharges  due to itself and leave the buyers to  sort  out\r\n\r\nthe mess with the sellers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is another Chinese saying,\r\n\r\n\"yuan      you     tou,     zhai     you      zhu\"      (\r\n\r\n),  which  literally means there is a  culprit  to  every\r\n\r\nwrongdoing and there is a debtor to every debt.  It means\r\n\r\nthat we must go after the real\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nculprit  responsible for any wrongdoing and we  must  not\r\n\r\n\"yuan wang hao ren\" (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), that\r\n\r\nis, we must not wrong the innocent people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, while I support the\r\n\r\nother  amendments in the Bill, I would like to  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to rethink this particular amendment.   Instead\r\n\r\nof empowering the Board to sell the HDB flat involved,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to suggest that the CPF Board be empowered  to\r\n\r\nimpose a severe penalty on the members who default on the\r\n\r\ncharges due to the Board.  For example, defaulters,  like\r\n\r\nMr  Tan  in  my illustration, could be fined a hefty  sum\r\n\r\nseveral  times the amount due and, in some instances,  be\r\n\r\nimprisoned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly hope that the Ministry would not reply\r\n\r\nby  saying  that those buyers affected could take  action\r\n\r\nagainst their lawyers for negligence or take out a  civil\r\n\r\nsuit  against the sellers.  Is that not a very convoluted\r\n\r\nway of solving a simple problem?  In the first place,  it\r\n\r\nis   already   wrong   to  ask   them   to   assume   the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  of the seller's wrongdoing.   Now,  you\r\n\r\nwant  to  impose further burden on these innocent victims\r\n\r\nwho,  after losing their flats, have to incur extra legal\r\n\r\nexpenses and time, not to mention the mental anguish they\r\n\r\nhave to go through.  Since we know that this amendment is\r\n\r\nunfair  and  unjust,  I  feel that  we  should  take  the\r\n\r\ncorrective action now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our law is to protect the law-abiding citizens and to hold wrongdoers responsible for\r\n\r\ntheir   misdeeds.    This   particular   provision    has\r\n\r\ncontradicted  that spirit.  Therefore,  I  strongly  urge\r\n\r\nthat  this part of the amendment be reviewed and changed.\r\n\r\nThe  CPF Board must take action against the culprits  and\r\n\r\nnot  take  the  easy  option of penalising  the  innocent\r\n\r\nvictims while leaving them in the lurch.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr Yeo and\r\n\r\nDr  Ong for their comments.  Let me reply specifically to\r\n\r\nsome of their points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has advised the public at large to\r\n\r\nexercise prudence in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmaking  housing plans.  And we reiterate  this  call  for\r\n\r\nhome  buyers  to  acquire  homes within  their  financial\r\n\r\nmeans.  He asked what CPF Board and Government can do  to\r\n\r\neducate  Singaporeans  to  better  plan  their  finances,\r\n\r\nincluding consumption and investment in housing.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  remind the House and the public  that  this  is\r\n\r\nexactly  what the imposition of the valuation  limit,  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  CPF withdrawal limit, seeks to  do.   It  will\r\n\r\nstart at 150% and slowly move over the next five years to\r\n\r\n120%.  Similarly, the cash payments will increase from 0%\r\n\r\nto 10%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo also talked about the CPF default rate and e-submissions, in particular, he mentioned that it was 0.6%\r\n\r\nin  April-June up to 0.8% in January-March.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I think these are quite highly commendable figures.\r\n\r\nWe   have   less   than   1%  of  employers   defaulting.\r\n\r\nStatistically,  it is not different.  There  is  a  quirk\r\n\r\nthat in the month of February, there seems to be a slight\r\n\r\nblip,  perhaps  related to the Chinese New  Year  season.\r\n\r\nBut,  yes,  we will do our utmost to reduce  the  default\r\n\r\nrate  further.   Our  CPF  Board does  contact  employers\r\n\r\nfairly  quick  after  they have gone  beyond  a  two-week\r\n\r\nlimit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked about small and medium enterprises and\r\n\r\nhow  we  can  help  them to enable  them  to  submit  CPF\r\n\r\nsubmissions electronically.  Yes, the Ministry will  roll\r\n\r\nout the plan.  Currently, about less than 10% do so.   We\r\n\r\nwill  extend  the same programmes that we  do  for  large\r\n\r\nemployers  to  smaller  employers, including  subsidising\r\n\r\nsome  of their transmission fees electronically.  We will\r\n\r\nalso create additional e-channels for e-submissions which\r\n\r\ninclude  the  use of major kiosk service providers.   The\r\n\r\nAXS employer returns, for example, currently utilises 150\r\n\r\nkiosks  for goods island wide.  They can also have access\r\n\r\nto sites in CDCs and CCCs as well as, he mentioned, GIRO.\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, there are plans to also start e-lobbies, or  e-terminals  within the lobbies at CPF branches.   We  will\r\n\r\nroll   out   special  training  plans  for  these   small\r\n\r\nemployers,  including  using the Government  IT  Literacy\r\n\r\nProgramme to co-fund part of the enabling process.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the point brought up by Dr Ong\r\n\r\nwhere  he mentioned that this amendment is unfair against\r\n\r\nthe  seller.   I  would  like to  remind  him  that  this\r\n\r\nprovision already exists for private properties.   It  is\r\n\r\nno  different from that of private properties.  The  only\r\n\r\ndifference is that now we create an automatic charge.  So\r\n\r\nthe  solution really is that you still need to enable the\r\n\r\nCPF  Board  to acquire the properties with the  power  of\r\n\r\nsale.  Because in certain acts of collusion between buyer\r\n\r\nand  seller, you need the Act.  The solution  to  prevent\r\n\r\nthe  CPF Board exercising the power of sale is to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat there is due diligence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will make arrangements, in the event that HDB is\r\n\r\nthe  intermediary  and  where  HDB  is  appointed  as   a\r\n\r\nsolicitor  for  either buyer or seller  of  the  flat  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  CPF  funds  have  been  returned.   In\r\n\r\naddition, banks and lawyers will be informed of  the  CPF\r\n\r\ncharge  and the power of sale that comes with it so  that\r\n\r\nthey  will do their diligence.  They will conduct  search\r\n\r\nat  the CPF Board and the existence of the CPF charge  on\r\n\r\nthe HDB flat.  It will be in the interest of the banks to\r\n\r\nensure  that the CPF charge is this charge from the  sale\r\n\r\nof  the flat so that there is no encumbrance on the flat.\r\n\r\nThe  buyer's lawyer should ensure that the title  to  the\r\n\r\nflat   is   passed  to  their  client  free  from   prior\r\n\r\nencumbrance  and the seller's lawyer should  also  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  their client returns the CPF as otherwise the  sale\r\n\r\ncould  be  jeopardised, should CPF invoke  its  power  of\r\n\r\nsale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the unlikely event that the above mechanisms fail\r\n\r\nand  the  CPF  monies secured by the CPF charge  are  not\r\n\r\npaid,  the  CPF  Board will still seek the assistance  of\r\n\r\nHDB,  the mortgagees and the parties' lawyers to  recover\r\n\r\nthe CPF monies from the sellers.  With due diligence from\r\n\r\nall  parties involved, this power will rarely be  invoked\r\n\r\nand,  indeed,  only as a last resort, such  as  instances\r\n\r\nwhen there is evidence of collusion between the buyers or\r\n\r\nsellers,  will  CPF Board proceed to  sell  the  flat  to\r\n\r\nrecover  the  seller's CPF money that is secured  by  the\r\n\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Dr Ng Eng Hen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down on the\r\n\r\nOrder  Paper for today be exempted at this day's  sitting\r\n\r\nfrom  the provisions of Standing Order No. 1. -  [Mr  Mah\r\n\r\nBow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be\r\n\r\nnow read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July this year, Government announced that the\r\n\r\nbank  origination  of  HDB market  rate  loans  would  be\r\n\r\nimplemented from 1st January next year, 2003.  One of the\r\n\r\nobjectives   of   this   Bill  is   to   facilitate   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of bank origination.  The Bill also  seeks\r\n\r\nto  fine-tune  the Act to facilitate HDB's implementation\r\n\r\nof its upgrading programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I explain the proposed amendments in\r\n\r\ngreater detail, allow me to first reiterate the rationale\r\n\r\nfor bank origination of market rate loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Bank Origination of HDB Market Rate Loans</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>HDB Concessionary and Market Rate Loans</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB provides mortgage loans at a concessionary\r\n\r\ninterest  rate  to  help eligible  Singaporeans  buy  HDB\r\n\r\nflats.   These subsidised flats are granted to first-time\r\n\r\nsubsidised flat buyers as well as second-time buyers  who\r\n\r\nare upgrading from smaller flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB currently also provides loans at market rates.\r\n\r\nSuch market rate loans are for HDB buyers who have either\r\n\r\npreviously consumed HDB housing loan subsidies, or who do\r\n\r\nnot  qualify for HDB subsidies in the first place.  There\r\n\r\nare  five categories of such buyers:  Singapore Permanent\r\n\r\nResidents;   private   property   owners;   high   income\r\n\r\nhouseholds, ie, those which earn $8,000 or more a  month;\r\n\r\nthose  who have already enjoyed two concessionary  loans;\r\n\r\nand,  finally,  those who have enjoyed one  concessionary\r\n\r\nloan for the purchase of a subsidised flat and are buying\r\n\r\na similar-sized flat, or a smaller flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Bank Origination from 1st January 2003</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members are aware, my Ministry is reviewing the\r\n\r\nfunctions  of  HDB  to see in what  way  HDB  can  better\r\n\r\nfulfill its core responsibility, which is to provide good\r\n\r\nquality   and  affordable  public  housing.   A   guiding\r\n\r\nprinciple  of the review is that HDB should,  as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible,   let  the  private  sector  take  over   those\r\n\r\nfunctions which extend beyond this core responsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such activity is the provision of market rate\r\n\r\nloans.   As these loans are not subsidised and are pegged\r\n\r\nto  commercial  rates,  there is no  reason  for  HDB  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  provide  them.  Our financial  institutions\r\n\r\nhave  the  resources and are well positioned  to  provide\r\n\r\ncompetitive mortgage financing for the purchase of public\r\n\r\nhousing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the Government decided that HDB will no\r\n\r\nlonger  provide  market rate loans with effect  from  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary 2003.  Flat buyers who are not eligible for HDB's\r\n\r\nconcessionary rate loans can take market rate loans  from\r\n\r\nthe many banks which are licensed to offer housing loans.\r\n\r\nExisting  HDB  market rate mortgagors can transfer  their\r\n\r\nremaining mortgages to the banks if they so wish.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have previously expressed concern that\r\n\r\nthe provision of market rate loans by banks, instead of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHDB,  is  in  effect  a withdrawal by Government  of  its\r\n\r\nsocial safety net.  They see HDB as generally being  more\r\n\r\nsympathetic towards flat owners in arrears, and will  not\r\n\r\nrepossess  flats  as a last resort.  On the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nthey perceive banks as being less forbearing, as they are\r\n\r\nprofit-driven.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reiterate that there is no change in the\r\n\r\nGovernment's commitment to the provision of basic housing\r\n\r\nin the form of subsidised HDB flats.  We are not touching\r\n\r\nour basic housing safety net.  Our housing subsidies have\r\n\r\nenabled  the vast majority of Singaporeans to  own  their\r\n\r\nown  homes.  Concessionary loans are a key instrument  to\r\n\r\npromote  home  ownership.   Hence,  the  Government  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to provide HDB loans at concessionary rates  to\r\n\r\neligible  buyers.  We will continue to maintain our  home\r\n\r\nownership  policy  by  providing  subsidised  loans   for\r\n\r\nsubsidised  flats  so  that  eligible  Singaporeans   can\r\n\r\ncontinue to afford good quality public housing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with bank origination of market rate loans,\r\n\r\nthe  Government is indeed pulling back the safety net  at\r\n\r\nthe  fringes.  But this will only apply to those  who  do\r\n\r\nnot  need extra help in the first place.  They are either\r\n\r\nthe  financially better off, or those who already  own  a\r\n\r\nHDB flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Flexibility with responsibility</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While flat-buyers will enjoy greater flexibility by\r\n\r\nobtaining loans from banks, this greater flexibility also\r\n\r\ncomes  with greater responsibility.  Those who take loans\r\n\r\nfrom   banks  should  exercise  financial  prudence,   do\r\n\r\nfinancial  planning, and buy a flat within  their  means.\r\n\r\nThey  must  go  into the purchases with their  eyes  wide\r\n\r\nopen,  and expect to be subject to the mortgage financing\r\n\r\nrules and foreclosure practices of the banks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tandem with the move to bank origination and\r\n\r\ngreater  responsibility,  I  had,  in  July  this   year,\r\n\r\nsignalled  my Ministry's intention to treat  certain  HDB\r\n\r\nflats   bought   with  bank  loans  more   like   private\r\n\r\nproperties.  I informed this House that MND was  actively\r\n\r\nstudying whether\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  how  the  restrictions on resale and rental  of  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  can  be  relaxed.  This is also in line  with  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of various Economic Review Committee sub-committees,  such as the CPF Working Group and  the  Sub-Committee   on  Entrepreneurship,  that  the   Government\r\n\r\nexplore  various ways to help homeowners  monetise  their\r\n\r\nhousing assets and thus free up capital in the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to announce the results of our review.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Current policy</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB flats are restricted by a minimum occupation\r\n\r\nperiod  (MOP), which is the minimum period that a  lessee\r\n\r\nneeds  to own a flat before he can sell it.  The  MOP  is\r\n\r\ncurrently  five  years  for a flat bought  at  subsidised\r\n\r\nprices,  ie, either directly from HDB or a flat from  the\r\n\r\nresale market but bought with a CPF Housing Grant, and it\r\n\r\nis  21/2 years for a non-subsidised flat bought from  the\r\n\r\nresale market without any CPF Housing Grant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subletting of the whole flat is also currently\r\n\r\ndisallowed,   except   in  special  circumstances.    For\r\n\r\nexample, the lessee may be overseas, or he may be elderly\r\n\r\nand, subject to various criteria, he can sublet his whole\r\n\r\nflat for income generation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These restrictions reinforce the principle of long-term owner occupation for subsidised public housing.\r\n\r\nThey  help to justify the subsidies enjoyed by  HDB  flat\r\n\r\nlessees  and are fundamental features distinguishing  HDB\r\n\r\nflats from private property.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Policy refinements</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has considered the proposals from the\r\n\r\nERC  carefully.  It has decided that, together  with  the\r\n\r\nmove  to bank origination in January 2003, HDB will relax\r\n\r\nthe current restrictions on MOP and subletting for resale\r\n\r\nflats  that are bought without the CPF Housing Grant  and\r\n\r\nwhich are financed by bank loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st January 2003, HDB lessees who buy resale\r\n\r\nflats  without any CPF Housing Grant and with bank  loans\r\n\r\nwill  only  need  to  occupy their flats  for  one  year,\r\n\r\ninstead  of the current 21/2 years, before they can  sell\r\n\r\nit  in  the  open market.  Existing resale  flats  bought\r\n\r\nwithout  any CPF Housing Grant will also qualify  if  the\r\n\r\nlessee  re-finances his outstanding HDB market rate  loan\r\n\r\nwith  banks  or fully redeems his HDB market  rate  loan.\r\n\r\nThe  reduction in MOP will also apply to existing  resale\r\n\r\nflats  that  are  bought without CPF  Housing  Grant  and\r\n\r\nwithout any loan from HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subletting rules for these categories of flat buyers\r\n\r\nwill  also  be  relaxed.  HDB will allow them  to  sublet\r\n\r\ntheir entire flat if they have occupied them for 10 years\r\n\r\nor  more.   With these changes, HDB resale  flats  bought\r\n\r\nwithout  any CPF Housing Grant and without any loan  from\r\n\r\nHDB will be treated more like private properties.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Subletting guidelines to prevent disamenities</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me stress that the Government is not\r\n\r\nabandoning  the principle of long-term owner  occupation,\r\n\r\nor  the social objectives of public housing.  That is why\r\n\r\nwe  have  not  completely relaxed the MOP and  subletting\r\n\r\nrules.   To preserve the good environment of our  housing\r\n\r\nestate  and  to  minimise nuisances that may  arise  from\r\n\r\nsubletting,  the  HDB will apply certain  guidelines  and\r\n\r\nconditions  on  subletting that  are  already  in  place.\r\n\r\nLessees  are still expected to comply with the  covenants\r\n\r\nin   the   lease   and  will  be  held  responsible   for\r\n\r\ninfringements  committed by their sub-tenants.   The  HDB\r\n\r\nwill  also work closely with the grassroots organisations\r\n\r\nand  the  residents  to ensure that subletting  does  not\r\n\r\nbecome  detrimental to the living environment of the  HDB\r\n\r\nblocks.   The HDB will be releasing more details soon  on\r\n\r\nthe relaxation of the MOP and subletting rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendments to the Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the specific amendments to\r\n\r\nthe  Housing and Development Act - what they are and  why\r\n\r\nthey are being amended.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Amendments related to bank origination</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank loans for the purchase of HDB flats are secured\r\n\r\non the value of the flats.  Hence the bank has to be able\r\n\r\nto foreclose the loan, recover vacant possession of a HDB\r\n\r\nflat  and conduct a mortgagee sale, should the flat owner\r\n\r\ndefault  in his mortgage payments.  Clause 6 of the  Bill\r\n\r\nwill  allow this, by enabling the bank to attach the flat\r\n\r\nwhen  it is exercising its power of sale under the  terms\r\n\r\nof  the  mortgage charge.  The bank, in place of  HDB  as\r\n\r\nmortgagee, will have first charge on the market rate loan\r\n\r\nshould there be a foreclosure of the mortgage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises that bank origination is a\r\n\r\nsignificant  move for HDB flat buyers.  We are  therefore\r\n\r\nkeeping   certain  safeguards  in  place.   The   current\r\n\r\nprotection  clause  in the Housing  and  Development  Act\r\n\r\nagainst third-party creditors will not be changed.   Flat\r\n\r\nlessees  and  their families, including  those  who  take\r\n\r\ntheir  mortgage  loans from banks, will  not  lose  their\r\n\r\nflats  as  a  result of claims by third parties,  in  the\r\n\r\nevent that they become bankrupt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill also allows CPF Board to, as a\r\n\r\nlast  resort, exercise its power of sale to  recover  CPF\r\n\r\nmonies  used in the purchase of the flat when  solicitors\r\n\r\nacting  for  the  various parties fail to  ensure  proper\r\n\r\nrefund  of  CPF monies when the flat is sold.  This  will\r\n\r\nhelp  to  safeguard the return of CPF savings to the  CPF\r\n\r\nmember's account for his retirement use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, HDB's consent is required before a\r\n\r\nmortgage  by  a  bank can be made  on  a  HDB  flat.   To\r\n\r\nfacilitate the process of obtaining HDB's consent and  to\r\n\r\nset  out  the  terms  and conditions  for  granting  such\r\n\r\nconsent,  clause 9 of the Bill enables HDB to make  rules\r\n\r\nfor the creation of mortgage on HDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Upgrading works in HDB precincts</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the subject of upgrading works\r\n\r\nin HDB precincts.  There\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  no  change  to our policies, but the amendments  will\r\n\r\nease the implementation of the upgrading programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) that was\r\n\r\nintroduced  last year can be implemented as part  of  the\r\n\r\nMain  Upgrading  Programme (MUP).   New  lifts  and  lift\r\n\r\nshafts  will  be added, where it is technically  feasible\r\n\r\nand  cost-effective to do so, to give residents  barrier-free access when their blocks are identified for the MUP.\r\n\r\nA  75%  `yes' vote from the residents is required  before\r\n\r\nMUP  or LUP can proceed.  Clause 11 of the Bill will make\r\n\r\nit  clear that, although residents vote for both the  MUP\r\n\r\nand  the LUP at the same time, the LUP will only proceed,\r\n\r\nif both the MUP and LUP polls are successful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments related to upgrading works will\r\n\r\nprovide  a clearer definition of the various terms  used.\r\n\r\nFor  example, lift upgrading is today defined  under  the\r\n\r\ncategory of `special upgrading works' in the Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Act.     Clause 10  will  provide  HDB  with\r\n\r\ngreater  flexibility  should  we  decide  to  expand  the\r\n\r\npresent  scope of special upgrading works to other  types\r\n\r\nof  HDB properties.  Clause 14 will give HDB the power of\r\n\r\nentry, including forcible entry, into HDB flats to  carry\r\n\r\nout  upgrading works within a flat or building  that  has\r\n\r\nsuccessfully voted for upgrading.  Such powers  will,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, be used very sparingly if at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Administrative measures</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also introduce some administrative\r\n\r\nchanges  to  improve the enforcement  of  public  housing\r\n\r\nregulations and policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, clause 2 of the Bill provides for the\r\n\r\nappropriate  authority  to approve  the  purchase,  sale,\r\n\r\nlease  and  exchange of lands based on the  land  values.\r\n\r\nThis   is  because  the  Government  Instruction  Manuals\r\n\r\nalready provide for different approving authorities based\r\n\r\non the value of the lands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, clause 3 makes it clear that the rules on\r\n\r\nrenovation of HDB flats apply\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto both the flat owners and the renovation contractor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, clause 4 of the Bill disallows HDB from\r\n\r\ndelegating  the  power to make subsidiary legislation  to\r\n\r\nany  person.  It also disallows HDB to delegate the power\r\n\r\nto delegate to another party.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, clause 5 of the Bill spells out that all\r\n\r\nflat  lessees, regardless of when they bought their flats\r\n\r\nfrom  HDB, must seek HDB's prior consent before they  are\r\n\r\nallowed to use their flats as a Technopreneur Home Office\r\n\r\nor for other commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 15 of the Bill increases the maximum\r\n\r\npenalty for refusing to give information or giving  false\r\n\r\ninformation  to  HDB  to  a  $2,000  fine  or  a  3-month\r\n\r\nimprisonment  term or both.  This is  to  enable  HDB  to\r\n\r\neffectively  enforce against illegal  parking  along  HDB\r\n\r\nservice  roads.  Similar penalties are imposed under  the\r\n\r\nParking  Places Act and the Urban Redevelopment Authority\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I rise in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of market pricing for HDB\r\n\r\nflats,  it  is  only  fair that  HDB  should  reduce  its\r\n\r\nrestrictions on flat owners who do not enjoy much housing\r\n\r\nsubsidy.  The Bill will provide more flexibility for flat\r\n\r\nowners who are presently required to pay HDB market rates\r\n\r\nfor mortgage loan to obtain loan from banks instead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This move will benefit those who are able to secure\r\n\r\nattractive   mortgage  loans  due  to   their   financial\r\n\r\ncredentials.  But it may pose problems to those  who  are\r\n\r\nin  financial  hardship.  These include Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nare  bankrupt or face financial hardship due to the  loss\r\n\r\nof  their  sole  breadwinners or  prolonged  unemployment\r\n\r\nduring recessions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 10 years, many HDB flat owners have\r\n\r\nupgraded to bigger flats.  Many dual income families  had\r\n\r\napplied  for larger flats and obtained subsidised housing\r\n\r\nloans  from  HDB.   As a result of the  recent  financial\r\n\r\ncrisis, some are presently facing difficulty paying their\r\n\r\nmortgages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Bill will have negative impact on two\r\n\r\ngroups of Singaporeans.  Those who wish to downgrade to a\r\n\r\nsmaller  flat  due to various reasons, such as  financial\r\n\r\nhardship  or  retirement,  or  those  who  wish  to  move\r\n\r\nlaterally to another flat of the same size due to reasons\r\n\r\nsuch as opting to stay near their family members.  I wish\r\n\r\nto  urge  the Minister to consider providing HDB loan  to\r\n\r\nthese  two  groups of Singaporeans, in particular,  those\r\n\r\nfacing financial hardships.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the lifting of rental restrictions, the supply\r\n\r\nof  rental  flats  will  increase,  thus  providing  more\r\n\r\noptions  and  cheaper accommodation  for  people  seeking\r\n\r\nrental  flats.   But, to avoid any inconvenience  to  HDB\r\n\r\nresidents,  HDB  should apply a  cap  on  the  number  of\r\n\r\npersons living in various sizes of rental flats.  This is\r\n\r\nto avoid HDB flats being rented out as workers' dormitory\r\n\r\nfor foreign workers, thus affecting the residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we should also consider removing the\r\n\r\ntwo-and-a-half-year  occupation period  for  flat  owners\r\n\r\ntaking  a  private bank loan.  This will further increase\r\n\r\nthe  supply of rental flats, thus providing more  options\r\n\r\nfor rental.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the change in policy to allow private bank\r\n\r\nloans  for  certain  households of HDB  flats  may  cause\r\n\r\nconfusion  if  the terms and conditions are  not  clearly\r\n\r\ndisseminated  to  the  public.  Many  existing  HDB  flat\r\n\r\nowners  who may fall into this category may not be  aware\r\n\r\nof  the  financial implications of taking up a bank  loan\r\n\r\nwhich has first charge on their flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we encourage financial prudence and self-management, many HDB flat owners may not understand the\r\n\r\nfinancial risks involved in taking up a bank loan.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThese  include fluctuating interest rates, penalties  for\r\n\r\nlate  payment,  termination or early  payment  of  entire\r\n\r\nloans,  aggressive debt recovery procedures and  charges,\r\n\r\nhigher  legal  fees,  and many other  miscellaneous  bank\r\n\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to protect the interest of HDB flat owners, HDB\r\n\r\nmust  launch  a  campaign to educate the  public  on  the\r\n\r\nfinancial   implications  of  bank  loans,  and   provide\r\n\r\nfinancial counselling to potential HDB flat owners  using\r\n\r\nbank  loans.  This will help Singaporeans to make better-informed decisions when purchasing HDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to seek clarifications on certain\r\n\r\ntechnical points in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 24(2) of the\r\n\r\nHousing  and Development Board Act by deleting  the  word\r\n\r\n\"Minister\" and substituting it with the words \"prescribed\r\n\r\napproving authority\".  Section 24 provides the power  for\r\n\r\nHDB  to  purchase, sell and lease or exchange land.   The\r\n\r\namendment   removes  the  need  to  seek  the  Minister's\r\n\r\napproval   when   selling,   surrendering,   leasing   or\r\n\r\nexchanging land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the rationale of removing this authority\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister  or delegating this  authority?   The\r\n\r\nselling,  surrendering, leasing or exchange of  land  has\r\n\r\ndrastic  impact  on land use and the real estate  market.\r\n\r\nThe supply of land has always been a concern for both the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the private sector in Singapore.   It  is\r\n\r\nonly prudent that such authority be given to the Minister\r\n\r\ninstead  of  delegating  it  to  a  prescribed  approving\r\n\r\nauthority.  I do not understand why the Board  must  seek\r\n\r\nthe  approval of the Minister when purchasing or  leasing\r\n\r\nany land but do not need the Minister's approval when  it\r\n\r\nsells, surrenders, leases or exchanges land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 11 of the Bill amends section 65C of the\r\n\r\nHousing  and Development Board Act with regard to special\r\n\r\nupgrading works.  I hope the Minister can clarify what is\r\n\r\nclassified as special\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nupgrading  works and under what circumstances  must  flat\r\n\r\nowners  vote for such works.  To date, only the provision\r\n\r\nof lifts at every landing is defined as special upgrading\r\n\r\nwork,  which  requires voting and payment  by  residents.\r\n\r\nInterim  upgrading works are usually 100% funded  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and residents need not pay at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the scope of special upgrading works is not\r\n\r\nclearly  defined,  many items of  works  in  the  interim\r\n\r\nupgrading  package  may be included as special  upgrading\r\n\r\nworks,  thus requiring payment by residents.   This  will\r\n\r\npose  undue  financial  burden on  residents,  especially\r\n\r\nthose in 3- and 4-room flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendment in clause 5 to allow\r\n\r\nrestricted  use  of HDB flats for commercial  use.   This\r\n\r\nwill facilitate the Technopreneur Home Office scheme.  To\r\n\r\nfurther  encourage entrepreneurship,  I  would  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  expand  the home office  scheme  for  micro\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  such  as small agency or consultancy  firms.\r\n\r\nThis  will provide more opportunities for business start-ups which will eventually contribute to our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  rise  to  support  the Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill and the various measures proposed by the\r\n\r\nMinister, particularly the schemes to help home-owners to\r\n\r\nmonetise their housing assets and free up capital in  the\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise the following points so\r\n\r\nas  to moderate the impact on house-owners who are facing\r\n\r\nfinancial  hardships  because of  the  current  difficult\r\n\r\nbusiness and economic conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, house-owners who have enjoyed one concessionary\r\n\r\nloan with a subsidised flat and are downgrading or moving\r\n\r\nlaterally  will  now  be required to take  market  loans.\r\n\r\nCould  the Minister reconsider this especially for  those\r\n\r\nhouseholds facing financial hardships?  Like many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nothers,  I am concerned that they would find difficulties\r\n\r\nto secure a bank loan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposal to allow house-owners who have\r\n\r\nbought \"non-subsidised\" flats without any subsidy as well\r\n\r\nas  existing  lessees of such \"non-subsidised\"  flats  to\r\n\r\nhave  the  flexibility  to sublet  their  whole  flat  is\r\n\r\nwelcomed.   Sir,  I  would  like,  however,  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  allow  house-owners  of  subsidised  flats,\r\n\r\nespecially those who have fully redeemed their HDB loans,\r\n\r\nto  have  a similar flexibility.  Some may face financial\r\n\r\nhardship, especially those who are retrenched and  cannot\r\n\r\nfind  employment.  They are not able to sell their  flats\r\n\r\nand  downgrade in these difficult times.  We should allow\r\n\r\nthem  this flexibility to monetise their housing  assets.\r\n\r\nOthers  may  not want to sell their flats for sentimental\r\n\r\nor  other  reasons.  They want to move to  smaller  flats\r\n\r\nwithin  their  current means or stay with their  children\r\n\r\nwho  can  take  care of them.  I hope the Minister  would\r\n\r\nconsider  such cases having due regard to their hardships\r\n\r\nwhich they may face in these difficult times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  we  all  know that HDB is one of the key  household\r\n\r\nwords in Singapore.  There would not be the scale of home-ownership  as  we  now  know and have  here  without  the\r\n\r\nconcept and philosophy behind the setting up of HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an achievement which Singaporeans are all\r\n\r\nproud  of.  Successful as we are economically, the  value\r\n\r\nof  home-ownership, as a base for instilling a  sense  of\r\n\r\nbelonging  and  as  stakeholders in  the  newly  emerging\r\n\r\nnation like our Singapore is priceless.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons why HDB has been able to deliver\r\n\r\non  that  score is that it understood the  need  for  the\r\n\r\nBoard   to  remain  relevant,  nimble  and  flexible   in\r\n\r\nfulfilling  its  role.   HDB knows goalposts  related  to\r\n\r\nhousing keep changing as Singapore and Singaporeans  move\r\n\r\nup the ladder of economic and social well-being.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nFor, after all, housing in Singapore is more than just  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of  brick and mortar.  It is  indeed  a  socio-political  phenomenon.   It is  about  living  and,  more\r\n\r\nimportantly, living under one multi-cultural roof.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging from the number of amendments made by HDB\r\n\r\nsince  its inception, we are reassured that HDB wants  to\r\n\r\nremain  relevant, nimble and helpful.   Whether  for  the\r\n\r\nbetter administration of the Act or to allow the Minister\r\n\r\nto make rules with respect to the terms and conditions of\r\n\r\na sale, lease, mortgage or disposal of an HDB flat, or to\r\n\r\nallow  an  approved mortgage or statutory  charge  or  to\r\n\r\nenable  a  poll  to be conducted for lift  upgrading  and\r\n\r\nother special upgrading works, as the purpose behind this\r\n\r\namendment Bill, to me, they all point to the intention of\r\n\r\nthe HDB wanting to be helpful, and I support that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that upgrading has been and is generally on\r\n\r\nthe  radar  screen for sometime now.  Similarly,  matters\r\n\r\npertaining  to  leases, mortgages and the role  of  local\r\n\r\nbanks  are also very much in focus now.  While I have  no\r\n\r\nspecific  comments to make on those proposed  amendments,\r\n\r\nexcept to call for a faster rate of lift upgrading, allow\r\n\r\nme,  Mr Speaker, Sir, to urge the HDB to also look at the\r\n\r\nproblem of those who want to downgrade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realise that the HDB has been very understanding\r\n\r\nin facing the problems of those who need help in terms of\r\n\r\nrescheduling   mortgages  or  in  settlement   of   other\r\n\r\nfinancial  dues.   The recent economic downturn  and  its\r\n\r\nsubsequent  retrenchments  and rising  unemployment  have\r\n\r\nmade  many,  especially in the lower income brackets,  to\r\n\r\nrealistically review their aspirations and  dreams  about\r\n\r\nthe level and quality of home-ownership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many cases I met at the MPS, something I suspect\r\n\r\nmust be true at other MPSs too, are seriously facing this\r\n\r\nproblem  of not being able to meet their obligations  and\r\n\r\ndo  see downgrading as a way out.  For those who had  the\r\n\r\nhopes  of  making a profit from selling their flats  have\r\n\r\nhad to think again.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many, I suspect, are caught in this trap. They want\r\n\r\nto  downgrade  but  there are not many  three-room  flats\r\n\r\navailable  as  the  HDB has stopped  building  new  ones.\r\n\r\nNeither  could they sell their present four or  five-room\r\n\r\nflats  without making a loss.  Moreover, they would  also\r\n\r\nneed  to  put  up  cash upfront for their new  purchases,\r\n\r\nsomething they would be hard put at.  I do not  know  how\r\n\r\nserious  this problem is but I fear it might be faced  by\r\n\r\nmany Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the HDB, Sir, study this problem and see how\r\n\r\nbest it could help the many home-owners who would like to\r\n\r\nor  need to downgrade, but not capable of doing so either\r\n\r\nbecause of policy considerations or the market supply and\r\n\r\ndemand situation?  Could the HDB also review its existing\r\n\r\npolicies  that might make it difficult for those  needing\r\n\r\nto  do  so?   This  should also  be  part  of  the  HDB's\r\n\r\nendeavours to remain nimble and flexible in helping those\r\n\r\nin need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  to  appeal to the Ministry of National Development,\r\n\r\nin  view of the amendment Bill, to consider, in this time\r\n\r\nof  slow  economic  recovery, when many Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nstill facing difficulties in finding employment and  many\r\n\r\nfamilies are stretching on their savings, allowing for  a\r\n\r\nsecond concessionary rate HDB loan for families who  move\r\n\r\nlaterally and downgrade their flats to a smaller flat due\r\n\r\nto  forced circumstances, such as retrenchments, business\r\n\r\nfailures,  critical  illnesses,  death  of  breadwinners,\r\n\r\ndivorce separations, imprisonment and family support.  If\r\n\r\nthese affected families are not able to enjoy this second\r\n\r\nconcessionary loan rate from HDB, they will forever be in\r\n\r\nthe  financial web and stuck in this difficult  financial\r\n\r\nposition even if they downgrade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, these people downgrade to lessen their\r\n\r\nfinancial difficulty. As stated earlier by Mr Mah Bow Tan\r\n\r\non bank origination of HDB bank rate loans in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nParliament on 23rd July, concessionary loans  are  a  key\r\n\r\ninstrument  to  promote  home-ownership.   In  such  dire\r\n\r\ncircumstances, if these families are not able to get  the\r\n\r\nconcessionary  rate  loans, they would  even  lose  their\r\n\r\nability to own a flat. Since we cannot tell banks not  to\r\n\r\nforeclose  for hardship cases, we should encourage  these\r\n\r\nfamilies to take responsibility and be more dependent  on\r\n\r\nthemselves.  We  should  applaud their  decisive  choice.\r\n\r\nThis  is  in  line  with  Government's  encouragement  of\r\n\r\nprudence and responsibility in housing purchase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, most of the people in this group may be\r\n\r\nfrom  the  lower income.  This would also  cause  another\r\n\r\nmajor  problem  as they may not qualify  for  the  banks'\r\n\r\nstrict  income criteria assessment.  So if  they  do  not\r\n\r\nqualify, where can they turn to?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to appeal to the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  evaluate these special cases  individually.\r\n\r\nThe  HDB  would be able to set relevant criteria for  the\r\n\r\nevaluation of the eligibility for this concessionary rate\r\n\r\nloan to ensure that when these families move laterally or\r\n\r\ndowngrade, they are truly in financial difficulties  and,\r\n\r\nin these circumstances, truly eligible for the subsidised\r\n\r\nloan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One possibility to prevent abuse of the flexibility\r\n\r\nof  consideration  by  HDB for this second  concessionary\r\n\r\nloan  is  to cap the quantum for the second concessionary\r\n\r\nloan,  possibly  in relation to the previous  outstanding\r\n\r\nloan  amount  of  the previous flat.   This  action  will\r\n\r\ndefinitely   encourage  the  fundamental   objective   of\r\n\r\nresponsible    and    prudent   home-ownership    amongst\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area of concern is that although the\r\n\r\nproposed   amendments  will  enhance  the  home-ownership\r\n\r\nscheme   to   remain   relevant  and  injecting   greater\r\n\r\nflexibility  into  the  public housing  market,  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  that MND and HDB do consider certain  guidelines\r\n\r\nto   preserve  the  residential  nature  of  the  housing\r\n\r\nestates,  especially  so  in a  high  density  and  close\r\n\r\nproximity of a block of flats.  We should\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  turn the residential blocks into hostels, especially\r\n\r\nfor foreign workers and foreign students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MND and HDB must retain the final authority to\r\n\r\ncancel  or  reject subletting permission,  especially  so\r\n\r\nwhen   nuisance  and  complaints  are  being  made   from\r\n\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, at present, about 86% of Singaporeans  live\r\n\r\nin HDB flats.  Among them, 96% have purchased their flats\r\n\r\nfrom  HDB.   Apparently, the Government's home  ownership\r\n\r\nscheme has been well supported and is very successful.  I\r\n\r\nthink  Singapore is the only country in the  world  where\r\n\r\nthe  housing  needs of as much as 86% of the  people  are\r\n\r\nsatisfied  by  public housing, with almost  every  family\r\n\r\nowning  its  own flat.  This is a win-win  situation  for\r\n\r\nboth the Government and the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as in any other schemes, any changes to the\r\n\r\nhousing  scheme  or  any  amendment  to  the  law  would,\r\n\r\ndirectly or indirectly, affect some of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this amendment Bill, I would like to raise three\r\n\r\npoints.    First,   on   the  change   in   granting   of\r\n\r\nconcessionary  loan.   Under  the  current  rules,  every\r\n\r\nqualified  buyer  is  entitled to  a  concessionary  loan\r\n\r\noffered  by  the HDB.  However, under the  amended  rule,\r\n\r\nwhen an existing owner of a HDB flat  wants to downgrade,\r\n\r\neg,  from  a 5-room or 4-room flat to a 3-room  flat,  or\r\n\r\nfrom a 4-room flat to another 4-room flat, he will not be\r\n\r\nentitled to this concessionary loan.  Of course, if  they\r\n\r\nhave  the means, there is no problem.  But for those  who\r\n\r\nare  facing financial difficulties, particularly  in  the\r\n\r\npast  few  years because of the economic recession,  many\r\n\r\npeople  are retrenched or unemployed, and are  unable  to\r\n\r\nfind  jobs  for  a long period of time,  they  will  have\r\n\r\nproblem  servicing their loan, and may have to resort  to\r\n\r\ndowngrading  in order to make ends meet.  Under  the  new\r\n\r\nrule,  they  will not be able to enjoy this concessionary\r\n\r\nloan from the HDB.  I think this is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsomething that we should carefully reconsider.  Residents\r\n\r\nwho  have  to downgrade from a bigger flat to  a  smaller\r\n\r\nflat owing to financial hardship will face double trouble\r\n\r\nif   they   are   deprived  of  the  entitlement   to   a\r\n\r\nconcessionary loan rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another group that warrants special consideration is\r\n\r\nthe  senior citizens.  In their younger days, they  could\r\n\r\nhave  purchased a big flat so that they could  live  with\r\n\r\ntheir  children and grandchildren.  Now that the children\r\n\r\nhave  grown up,  bought their own flats, and set up their\r\n\r\nown families, the old folks may find the flat too big for\r\n\r\njust   the  old  couple  who  are  left  alone,  all   by\r\n\r\nthemselves.  They do not need to stay in such a big flat,\r\n\r\nand the logical thing is to  downgrade to a smaller flat.\r\n\r\nBut now, they are not entitled to the concessionary loan.\r\n\r\nIn  the circumstances, can we not review the applications\r\n\r\non  a  case-by-case  basis?  If they  were  in  financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties, particularly those who were retrenched,  or\r\n\r\nmaybe  those  who were adjudicated bankrupt or  had  some\r\n\r\nspecial financial difficulties, can we not consider their\r\n\r\ncases  on  a  case-by-case  basis?   As  for  the  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens,  do  we have enough studio apartments  for  the\r\n\r\nelderly?  I think this is one area where the HDB needs to\r\n\r\nlook into.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, minimum occupancy period of resale flats.\r\n\r\nUnder the present rules, you have to stay in the flat for\r\n\r\nmore  than 21/2 years before you can put it up for resale\r\n\r\nin  the  open  market.  With the present amendment,  this\r\n\r\nminimum  occupancy period is shortened to one  year.  The\r\n\r\npoint  is, since they have bought the flat from the  open\r\n\r\nmarket  with no subsidy from the Government,  why  should\r\n\r\nthere be such a restriction?  Can we not fully liberalise\r\n\r\nthis rule and do away with this restriction, so that when\r\n\r\nthey  apply  to the bank for a loan, they will  be  in  a\r\n\r\nbetter position to bargain for better terms?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, subletting of flats. Those who bought the\r\n\r\nresale  flats from the open market are allowed to  sublet\r\n\r\nthe  flat  after  staying there for a certain  period  of\r\n\r\ntime.  I  would like to ask the Minister how  many  units\r\n\r\nwould qualify for this scheme under\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  present  arrangement. Of course, the permission  for\r\n\r\nsubletting  is  a  good  policy.   It  will  provide  the\r\n\r\nprospective tenants with cheaper rental flats and, at the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  allow the owners to earn some extra  income.\r\n\r\nHowever,  if there were too many of these units available\r\n\r\nfor subletting, it would give rise to some problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Minister mentioned that such\r\n\r\nsubletting would be subjected to strict rules.  We  would\r\n\r\nlike to know whether there would be enough provisions  in\r\n\r\nthe  rules to restrict the owners from subletting  to  an\r\n\r\nexcessive  number of foreign workers to the annoyance  of\r\n\r\ntheir neighbours, or people who use the flats for illegal\r\n\r\nactivities.  This is something which we have to  be  very\r\n\r\ncareful  about. Each and every application for subletting\r\n\r\nshould be carefully scrutinised before it is approved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, thank you for\r\n\r\nallowing me to join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several of my hon. colleagues of the House have\r\n\r\nspoken  at length on the Bill.  Let me add my support  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill for giving the HDB the flexibility to  allow  a\r\n\r\nwider  use  of HDB flats.  This is timely as  the  nation\r\n\r\nemphasises    the    importance   of    creativity    and\r\n\r\ninnovativeness, the promotion of entrepreneurship and the\r\n\r\nencouragement  of  starting  of  new  business.   But  in\r\n\r\nallowing  the  wider use of HDB flats beyond  residential\r\n\r\npurposes,  let  us be mindful of the needs of  neighbours\r\n\r\nand other residents.  The Bill  -  ultimately, the Act  - provides  for  the  termination of  the  lease  for  non-authorised use.  But what about lessees who use the flats\r\n\r\nfor  the  intended  purposes but are indifferent  to  the\r\n\r\nneeds of residents and neighbours?  Their activities  may\r\n\r\ncause  annoyance.   But  instead of  doing  something  to\r\n\r\nreduce  the  annoyance, they hide  behind  the  authority\r\n\r\ngranted  to  them  to  use the flats.   I  hope  that  in\r\n\r\ngranting them the right to the flat,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe lessees are also made to undertake the responsibility\r\n\r\nnot  to  disturb  the neighbours.  If  they  unreasonably\r\n\r\nchoose   to  ignore  the  problems  they  cause  to   the\r\n\r\nneighbours  and neighbourhood, the Board  must  have  the\r\n\r\nright to withdraw the privileges granted to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I rise to oppose the\r\n\r\namendment.  This amendment requires HDB flat buyers,  who\r\n\r\nhave  used up their subsidised loan quota or who are  not\r\n\r\nqualified  for  subsidies, to take market  rate  mortgage\r\n\r\nloan from banks rather than the HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill provides for banks to grant\r\n\r\nmortgage,  and they would be able to take HDB flats  from\r\n\r\nregistered  lessees   and sell them  to  pay  outstanding\r\n\r\nloans.   The  implication of this amendment is  that  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  can now be seized and sold by bank mortgagees  for\r\n\r\ndefault of mortgage loans.  Although the reason for  this\r\n\r\nchange,  as  explained,  is that lending  money  to  flat\r\n\r\nbuyers  at  market  rate is not HDB's core  business,  my\r\n\r\nquestion  is  whether  this entire move  of  making  flat\r\n\r\nowners   take   loans  from  the  banks  is   politically\r\n\r\nmotivated.   We all know how devastating  it  can  be  to\r\n\r\nevict  families from the only roof they have  over  their\r\n\r\nheads.  HDB, being a statutory board, is identified as  a\r\n\r\nwing of the Government.  If it has to evict families  who\r\n\r\nhave  not  kept up with their payments, it will show  how\r\n\r\nuncaring and uncompassionate the Government is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this current economic climate and uncertainty in\r\n\r\nthe  future  employment market, we can expect that  there\r\n\r\nwill   be   retrenchments,  unemployment  and   decreased\r\n\r\nbusiness opportunities.  More families will be unable  to\r\n\r\nkeep  up  with  their loan payments. By shifting  lending\r\n\r\nfrom  the  HDB to the banks, the banks will be  the  ones\r\n\r\ndoing the eviction. In this way, the Government will  not\r\n\r\nbe  seen as the bad guy, when, in reality, the Government\r\n\r\nis  distancing  itself from Singaporeans who  are  facing\r\n\r\ntougher  times ahead.  This, in Mandarin, is called  chea\r\n\r\ntau sha len.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to seek clarification on clause 2\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill.   Instead of the Minister,  a  \"prescribed\r\n\r\napproving authority\" will decide whether HDB land will be\r\n\r\nsold,  exchanged, surrendered or leased.  The Explanatory\r\n\r\nStatement  says  that  the approving  authority  will  be\r\n\r\nprescribed  in the Rules.  I wonder who is this  powerful\r\n\r\nauthority  going  to  be;  will  it  be  more  than   one\r\n\r\nauthority; and what is the reason for the change.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I would like to thank various\r\n\r\nMembers for speaking in support of the Bill, and  I  will\r\n\r\nrespond to Mr Low Thia Khiang later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Dr Teo Ho Pin has asked whether we\r\n\r\ncan help those who either downgrade or move laterally and\r\n\r\nwho  are  in  financial difficulties because he  believes\r\n\r\nthat  in  this current situation, they may find  it  more\r\n\r\ndifficult to get a bank loan instead of a loan from  HDB.\r\n\r\nSeveral  other  Members have also spoken along  the  same\r\n\r\nlines  -  Mr  Othman Haron Eusofe, Mdm Cynthia  Phua,  Mr\r\n\r\nZainul Abidin and also Mr Ang Mong Seng.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, first of all, explain - I think it was Mr\r\n\r\nAng Mong Seng who said that this is a new policy  -  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  not a new policy.  This is an existing  policy,\r\n\r\nand  what  this amendment Bill seeks to do is to  require\r\n\r\nsuch  lessees, instead of getting a market rate loan from\r\n\r\nHDB,  to  now  get it from the bank.  This  is  just  for\r\n\r\nclarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But back to the reason why we have not allowed these\r\n\r\npeople  who want to either downgrade or to move laterally\r\n\r\nfrom  taking a concessionary loan and instead to  take  a\r\n\r\nmarket rate loan.  First of all, let me, as I said in  my\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading  speech,  repeat  once  again  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is committed to ensuring that public  housing\r\n\r\nin  Singapore remains affordable to its citizens.  As the\r\n\r\npublic  housing authority, HDB's role is to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans  will be able to afford  at  least  the\r\n\r\nfirst  HDB  flat.  This is the reason why HDB  sells  new\r\n\r\nflats at subsidised prices and also with subsidised loans\r\n\r\nat concessionary interest rates, and HDB will continue to\r\n\r\ndo so.  If they do not wish to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbuy  a  subsidised new flat, they can also buy  a  resale\r\n\r\nflat and we give them a CPF housing grant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first loan, HDB will provide a subsidised\r\n\r\ninterest rate for first-timers.  In addition to that,  to\r\n\r\nencourage  social mobility, to encourage people  to  move\r\n\r\nup, to allow those who have outgrown their flats  -  they\r\n\r\nmay  have  bought  a 3-room flat many  years  ago;  their\r\n\r\nfamilies have grown up; they want to have more rooms  for\r\n\r\ntheir  children  -  or they just simply want  to  have  a\r\n\r\nbigger flat, HDB provides a second concessionary loan  to\r\n\r\nthose  who  have  already bought their  first  subsidised\r\n\r\nflat.   So, from the perspective of the need for housing,\r\n\r\nthe need to have a roof over their heads, there is really\r\n\r\nno strong reason for an HDB flat owner to move laterally;\r\n\r\nin other words, move from one flat to another flat of the\r\n\r\nsame size, or for him to downgrade.  And those who decide\r\n\r\nto do so should consider carefully when they do so.  They\r\n\r\nshould act prudently and they should decide whether  they\r\n\r\nhave sufficient funds.  Indeed they would have sufficient\r\n\r\nfunds in most cases arising from the sale of the existing\r\n\r\nflat.   Invariably,  most of them who  sell  their  first\r\n\r\nflat,  which is a subsidised flat, would be able to enjoy\r\n\r\nquite a significant capital gain.  They can then use this\r\n\r\ncapital gain to finance the purchase of the second  flat,\r\n\r\nwhich  is either of the same size or smaller.  But having\r\n\r\nsaid  all  these, we do know that there  are  people  who\r\n\r\ndowngrade  because of financial difficulties,  and  these\r\n\r\nare  the cases which, I think, Members in this House come\r\n\r\nacross during their meet-the-people sessions.  These  are\r\n\r\nthe  cases  which Members who have spoken  just  now  are\r\n\r\nreferring  to - people who have difficulties in servicing\r\n\r\ntheir  mortgage either because of retrenchment, prolonged\r\n\r\nillness, demise of their main breadwinner, and so on  and\r\n\r\nso  forth.   Therefore, because of  this,  they  have  no\r\n\r\nchoice but to downgrade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we recognise that there are such cases which\r\n\r\ndowngrade due to financial difficulties and I would  like\r\n\r\nto  assure  Members of the House that HDB  will  consider\r\n\r\nsuch  cases sympathetically as and when they come to  the\r\n\r\nattention of the HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also mentioned the cases of those who either\r\n\r\nmove  laterally or downgrade in order to stay near  their\r\n\r\nparents.  I believe he asked whether such cases can  also\r\n\r\nbe  allowed to enjoy the second concessionary loan.   Let\r\n\r\nme inform him that there are actually quite a few schemes\r\n\r\nin  place  to  encourage people to move nearer  to  their\r\n\r\nfamilies.  There are higher CPF housing grants for resale\r\n\r\nflats,  for  those  who  wish to  move  nearer  to  their\r\n\r\nfamilies.   There  is a married children priority  scheme\r\n\r\nfor purchase of new flats in the mature estates.  And all\r\n\r\nthese schemes have been fairly successful.  The number of\r\n\r\nfamilies living nearby or in the same estate has actually\r\n\r\ngone  up.   So, I do not think there is any special  need\r\n\r\nfor  another  scheme  to  promote  family  living.   But,\r\n\r\nnevertheless,  we  will keep in mind his  suggestion  for\r\n\r\nanother day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also proposed some restrictions on rental\r\n\r\nflats.   If  somebody wishes to sublet his  flat,  he  is\r\n\r\nconcerned  that,  without any restriction,  this  may  be\r\n\r\nabused.   It can either be let to foreign workers  or  to\r\n\r\nthose  who are not so socially responsible and so on.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  several other Members have also  made  the  same\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure them that this is a concern of the HDB\r\n\r\nand,  in  fact,  this is the reason why even  today,  HDB\r\n\r\nallows   subletting  of  the  whole  flat  under  special\r\n\r\ncircumstances.   There  is already  in  place  a  set  of\r\n\r\nguidelines  to govern such subletting.  In  other  words,\r\n\r\nyou  cannot just freely sublet to any Tom, Dick or Harry.\r\n\r\nYou have to abide by such guidelines and these guidelines\r\n\r\nand  conditions for subletting will also be applied  when\r\n\r\nwe  relax  the  subletting of HDB flats.   In  the  first\r\n\r\nplace,  they  will have to seek prior approval  from  HDB\r\n\r\nbefore they sublet.  Lessees will be held responsible for\r\n\r\nany  infringement that their sub-tenants commit.  And  if\r\n\r\nthere  are such infringements, then, obviously,  the  HDB\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to take action.  HDB, for this  particular\r\n\r\npurpose,  will also conduct half-yearly flat  inspections\r\n\r\nfor approved subletting cases.  This is to make sure that\r\n\r\nthe situation\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  Dr Teo talked about does not actually arise in  our\r\n\r\nHDB estates, where you have got 20 foreign workers living\r\n\r\nin one HDB flat, and so on.  So there will be guidelines.\r\n\r\nThere  will  be  regular inspections to  make  sure  that\r\n\r\ninfringements  do not take place.  As a final  safeguard,\r\n\r\nwhat  HDB  will do is to have regular dialogues with  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots leaders, advisers and Members of Parliament to\r\n\r\nget  feedback to see whether the scheme is working  well,\r\n\r\nto see whether there are indeed disruptions to the social\r\n\r\nenvironment,  disamenities, people who  are  anti-social,\r\n\r\nand so on and so forth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do not think we should jump to conclusion that\r\n\r\npeople  who sublet HDB flats will automatically be  anti-social.  That is probably not being fair to those who may\r\n\r\nwish  to  sublet  the flats.  Let me just  say  that  the\r\n\r\nsubletting  will actually allow quite a large  number  of\r\n\r\npeople  who  may not want to buy HDB flats  -  the  young\r\n\r\ncouples,  people  who are in financial difficulties,  who\r\n\r\nmay  not wish to commit - to also sublet such flats.  So,\r\n\r\nI  do not think we should straightaway jump to conclusion\r\n\r\nthat  it  is only foreign workers who are subletting  the\r\n\r\nflats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also commented on the possibility of lessees\r\n\r\nnot  understanding clearly the financial implications  of\r\n\r\nbanks  taking  the  first charge, if they  refinance  the\r\n\r\nloans.   I  think  this  is a legitimate  concern.   But,\r\n\r\nhaving said that, I think we should also advise those who\r\n\r\nwish  to  refinance their existing loans with banks,  all\r\n\r\nthose who are going to go to the banks for a loan in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  place, to be aware and careful, to be  financially\r\n\r\nprudent,  and  to  do  their sums before  they  jump  in.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I dare say that the banks themselves, before they\r\n\r\nlend,  would  also  have  to do their  homework,  do  due\r\n\r\ndiligence  work, and make sure that the people that  they\r\n\r\nare  lending  to are creditworthy.  On both counts,  both\r\n\r\nparties, the lender as well as the borrower, will have to\r\n\r\ndo  their  homework.  And, I believe, this  is  currently\r\n\r\nbeing  done when you go to a bank to borrow for  purchase\r\n\r\nof  a  private property.  They are not just going to lend\r\n\r\nit  to  you  without asking any questions.  Similarly,  I\r\n\r\nexpect that the banks will exercise\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsimilar  prudence, credit assessments and judgement  when\r\n\r\nthey  lend to HDB flat owners.  HDB flat owners will also\r\n\r\nhave to do their sums.  So I would be loath to get HDB to\r\n\r\ndo  the financial counselling.  It is not HDB's job to do\r\n\r\nfinancial  counselling for those who  are  going  to  the\r\n\r\nbanks.  If HDB were to do so, one could argue why are  we\r\n\r\nhaving bank origination in the first place.  Because  the\r\n\r\nwhole  idea of bank origination is for HDB not to  be  in\r\n\r\nthe  business of providing market rate loans.  It is  not\r\n\r\ntheir job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three minor points that Dr Teo raised.\r\n\r\nOne  is  on clause 2 of the Bill - I think this  is  also\r\n\r\nwhat  Mr  Low Thia Khiang asked - why is it that  we  are\r\n\r\nchanging  the  Act.  Mr Low detects some monkey  business\r\n\r\nsomewhere, and this is the reason why he raised it.   But\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to disabuse him.  There is no  conspiracy\r\n\r\nhere.   It  is quite a simple  matter.  What happened  is\r\n\r\nthat   the  Government  Instruction  Manual  has  changed\r\n\r\nwhereby  there are new authority limits.  In the  revised\r\n\r\nGovernment  Instruction  Manual,  land  sales  below  $10\r\n\r\nmillion  will  no longer need ministerial  approval.   It\r\n\r\ngoes to a Tenders Board.  So the approving authority,  in\r\n\r\nthis  case, for land sales below $10 million will be  the\r\n\r\nTenders  Board.   This Tenders Board  will  comprise  the\r\n\r\nsenior  officials  in the Ministry  of  Finance  and  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  Ministries, whichever Ministry  is  responsible\r\n\r\nfor that sale.  Land sales above $10 million will now  go\r\n\r\nto   a   Ministerial  Committee,  and  this   Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee  will  consist of Ministers  from  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinistry,  the  National  Development  Ministry  and  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  Ministry where that sale is taking place.   So,\r\n\r\nbasically,  this is an administrative change in  the  Act\r\n\r\nwhich   recognises   the  changes   in   the   Government\r\n\r\nInstruction Manual.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 - what is \"Special Upgrading Works\"? This\r\n\r\nis  what Dr Teo asked.  Special upgrading works currently\r\n\r\nrefer  to the Lift Upgrading Programme.  This is what  we\r\n\r\nhave at the moment.  When we carry out the Lift Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgramme,  we  do so under the Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nAct.   We  carry out a poll for Lift Upgrading  Programme\r\n\r\nunder the Housing and Development Act, and we call this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSpecial  Upgrading Works.  But, in future, we may  expand\r\n\r\nthe  scope  of Special Upgrading Works to include  things\r\n\r\nlike,  for example, a pneumatic refuse collection system,\r\n\r\nif  we  do  decide  to implement that.  There  have  been\r\n\r\ntrials  going  on.   If we wanted to do  that,  we  could\r\n\r\ninclude  that for the upgrading precinct but classify  it\r\n\r\nas  Special  Upgrading Works.  I  just  use  this  as  an\r\n\r\nexample.   I  am not suggesting that we are going  to  do\r\n\r\nthis.  But if we do decide to, we will obviously have  to\r\n\r\nhave further discussion on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point that Dr Teo mentioned was on the\r\n\r\nTechnopreneur  Home Office Scheme.  He asked  whether  we\r\n\r\ncan  expand this to other small businesses.  Let me  just\r\n\r\nsay  that  at  the moment, we are already  allowing  some\r\n\r\nbusinesses   to  be  conducted  within  the   HDB   flat,\r\n\r\nbusinesses which do not pose any nuisance.  Examples that\r\n\r\ncome to mind include giving tuition, people who work from\r\n\r\nhome,  people  who  do  small scale  work,  say,  sewing,\r\n\r\ntailoring,  that kind of business.  But we  are  actually\r\n\r\nlooking at broadening the scope of this to see whether we\r\n\r\ncan,    in    support   of   the   drive   to   encourage\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship,  allow  some  other  businesses  to  be\r\n\r\nallowed  in  HDB flats, provided that they do not  create\r\n\r\nnuisance  to  their  neighbours and they  do  not  create\r\n\r\ndisamenities in the general surroundings.   But  this  is\r\n\r\nunder  discussion  with the various relevant  Ministries.\r\n\r\nSo  far,  we have not come to any conclusion  yet.   But,\r\n\r\nyes, such discussions are ongoing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have answered Dr Teo's points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Othman Haron Eusofe touched on two points. One\r\n\r\nwas  on  financial  hardship which,  I  believe,  I  have\r\n\r\nanswered.   He also asked about subletting, extending  to\r\n\r\nthose who are in subsidised flats.  The general principle\r\n\r\nreally  is, in this particular case, that for  those  who\r\n\r\nare  not getting any subsidy from the Government, whether\r\n\r\nin the price of the flats or in the loan, we are prepared\r\n\r\nto  extend this concession to them.  However, in the case\r\n\r\nof subsidised flats, I think there is a huge subsidy\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nelement involved.  At this point in time, I do not  think\r\n\r\nwe should be extending such a concession to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encik Zainul talked about helping the downgraders.\r\n\r\nI think I have also addressed that point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua talked about second concession loan\r\n\r\nfor  downgraders.  I have also addressed that.  She  also\r\n\r\nasked  about preserving the residential nature of housing\r\n\r\nestates.  I believe I have also addressed that point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked why not just lift the MOP\r\n\r\n(minimum  occupation period) completely.  Why  reduce  it\r\n\r\nfrom  two-and-a-half years to one year?   The  reason  is\r\n\r\nvery  simple.   The MOP for HDB flats is to  ensure  that\r\n\r\npublic housing is meant for owner-occupation.  It is  not\r\n\r\nfor speculation.  It is not for investment.  So the owner-occupation principle is very important.  When you  buy  a\r\n\r\nHDB  flat, you must live in it.  It is not for buying and\r\n\r\nthen renting out.  That is the reason why we want to keep\r\n\r\na  MOP  but  we  wanted to reduce it in order  to  create\r\n\r\ngreater  flexibility.  When we relax the  rules,  when  I\r\n\r\nsaid  we want to treat HDB flats like private properties,\r\n\r\nI   did   not  mean  totally,  completely  like   private\r\n\r\nproperties.  There is still a certain principle  involved\r\n\r\nin public housing and that principle is owner occupation,\r\n\r\nwhich we would like to preserve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we also want to keep the MOP of one year\r\n\r\nbecause,  although it is a short period, it helps  us  to\r\n\r\nsignal  that HDB flats are not bought for speculation  or\r\n\r\nfor  investment.  And when the property market turns  up,\r\n\r\nwhen  trading  of HDB flats comes back again,  which  was\r\n\r\nquite  prevalent at one stage, we want to make sure  that\r\n\r\nthe minimum occupation period is in place to prevent such\r\n\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked how many units are allowed to\r\n\r\nbe sublet and will it disrupt the rental market.  I think\r\n\r\nthat  is  the  thrust of his question.   Based  on  HDB's\r\n\r\nstatistics, for those who are either totally\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnon-subsidised  or  those  who can  actually  re-finance,\r\n\r\nthere  is  something  like 15,000  HDB  flats  which  are\r\n\r\neligible  for  subletting with the 10-year rule.   Having\r\n\r\nsaid  that,  I  think not all of them will be  subletting\r\n\r\ntheir flats straightaway.  In the first place, they would\r\n\r\nhave to find another place to live.  And, secondly, I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  that  HDB lessees would just want  to  sublet\r\n\r\ntheir  flats without careful consideration.  So  although\r\n\r\nthe  maximum number is 15,000, I dare say that the  final\r\n\r\nnumber that will actually be released out into the rental\r\n\r\nmarket will be far less than that.  So I do not see  that\r\n\r\nthere will be a major impact on the rental market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to respond to Mr Low Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang.  His point is that this whole move is politically\r\n\r\nmotivated that, as a result of this, Government will  now\r\n\r\nwash  its hands off market rate loans, so that we do  not\r\n\r\nhave  to  evict tenants who foreclose.  Let me inform  Mr\r\n\r\nLow  that  the  number of evictions  from  HDB  flats  of\r\n\r\ntenants who do not pay up their loans, or who default  on\r\n\r\ntheir loans, is extremely small.  So that has never  been\r\n\r\nthe  motivation for this move.  It is not as if there are\r\n\r\nmany  HDB  tenants who are defaulting on their loans  and\r\n\r\nHDB  is  now  deciding to throw this problem  on  to  the\r\n\r\nbanks.   That  has  never been the  intention,  I  assure\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House.  HDB's role is to make sure  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  sufficient  housing for  our  people.   It  is\r\n\r\naffordable, good quality housing and we want  our  people\r\n\r\nto stay in the flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the motivation then, if it is not political?\r\n\r\nIt  is  very simple.  We are in the process of  reviewing\r\n\r\nthe  role of HDB.  We know what HDB should do.   We  want\r\n\r\nHDB  to  concentrate on public housing.  We want  HDB  to\r\n\r\nconcentrate on building good public housing.  We want HDB\r\n\r\nto concentrate on managing, on making sure that towns are\r\n\r\nproperly built, and so on.  HDB is not a bank.  It is not\r\n\r\na   financial  institution.   There  are  many  financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions, over 100 at the last count, who are  better\r\n\r\nplaced  to  provide market rate loans.  These are  market\r\n\r\nrate loans.  These are not concessionary rate loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for market rate loans which are provided at\r\n\r\nmarket rates, let us leave it to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  banks.  HDB should concentrate on doing what it does\r\n\r\nbest  - building good quality, affordable public housing.\r\n\r\nThat is the motivation for this move.  It has got nothing\r\n\r\nto do with what Mr Low mentioned just now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 2, I think I have already explained to him\r\n\r\nwhat the changes are about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe I have answered all the\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I seek\r\n\r\nclarification from the Minister?  Sir, I understand that,\r\n\r\ncurrently, if the lessee of a HDB flat is evicted by  HDB\r\n\r\ndue  to financial difficulty, that is, unable to pay  the\r\n\r\nloan,  normally on compassionate ground, HDB  will  offer\r\n\r\nsuch  a  lessee a rental flat.  I would like to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  with  the  change, when the  bank  evicts  the\r\n\r\nlessee  of  a  HDB  flat,  will HDB  come  in  and  help?\r\n\r\nOtherwise, where are they going to live?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, in the first place, when\r\n\r\nsomebody  buys a property to live in - and I  am  talking\r\n\r\nagain, and I remind the House, that this is not the first\r\n\r\nbasic  flat, we are talking about the second or even  the\r\n\r\nthird  flat  -  when he decides to purchase that  second,\r\n\r\nthird,  or whatever flat, he has to do so with  his  eyes\r\n\r\nwide  open, knowing exactly what he is doing, whether  he\r\n\r\ncan  afford the purchase price, whether he can afford the\r\n\r\ndownpayment,  whether he can afford  the  repayment,  the\r\n\r\ninstalment  payment, and so on.  So I do not  expect  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to stand guarantor to every person who buys  a\r\n\r\nflat using bank loans and say that if you default, if you\r\n\r\ncannot  afford to pay your instalments, do not worry,  we\r\n\r\nwill  give  you  a  rental flat.   There  is  no  blanket\r\n\r\nguarantee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, as in all cases which come to HDB, when\r\n\r\nMPs  put up appeals on behalf of their constituents, when\r\n\r\nthere  is  a genuine case of hardship, if the family  has\r\n\r\nreally  fallen on hard times, and we look at it, we  find\r\n\r\nthat  there is a case for special consideration, we  will\r\n\r\nprovide special\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconsideration.  And that is the rule of  thumb.   But  to\r\n\r\nexpect  HDB  to  have a blanket ruling  and  say,  \"Don't\r\n\r\nworry, we are going to provide you with a rental flat  if\r\n\r\nyou  default on your loan\", I do not think that is a wise\r\n\r\nthing to do.  And it creates a moral hazard.  That is not\r\n\r\nsomething that we would like to see.  What we want to  do\r\n\r\nis  to  explain to our people, when you make a commitment\r\n\r\nlike  this  for  public housing, or for private  housing,\r\n\r\nwhen  you  go to a bank for a loan, please make sure  you\r\n\r\nknow what you are doing and do your sums.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, the Minister\r\n\r\nsays the number of eviction of lessees due to default  of\r\n\r\npayments  is very small.  Can he please tell us how  many\r\n\r\nof  such evictions were there in 2001 and up to the  10th\r\n\r\nmonth of this year?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I do not have the exact\r\n\r\nnumbers  with me.  But I can recall that there were  less\r\n\r\nthan 10.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir. I\r\n\r\nunderstand one of the reasons why there was not  much  of\r\n\r\ndefault is because there were some Government schemes  in\r\n\r\nplace,  like  deferred  loan,  etc.   Will  the  Minister\r\n\r\nexpect,  in the event of an economic downturn like  this,\r\n\r\nthe  banks  would,  like  the  Government,  provide  such\r\n\r\nservices  to help people who are unable to service  their\r\n\r\nloans  to  tide  over  the period?  And  what  would  the\r\n\r\nGovernment advise the banks?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, as I said in my Second Reading\r\n\r\nspeech,  when somebody goes to the bank for  a  loan,  he\r\n\r\nwould  have  to abide by the bank's rules of foreclosure,\r\n\r\nhe  would  have  to abide by the bank's rules  on  credit\r\n\r\nassessment.   So,  the short answer to him  is  that  all\r\n\r\nborrowers would have to abide by the rules that are  laid\r\n\r\ndown  by  the lender.  And it is no different  for  HDB's\r\n\r\ncase,  it  is no different for the bank's case.   In  the\r\n\r\ncase of HDB, when they come to HDB to borrow, HDB has  to\r\n\r\ndo a credit assessment.  If they do not comply with those\r\n\r\nconditions,  and  they default on their  loans,  HDB  can\r\n\r\nevict.  But, as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMr  Low rightly pointed out, HDB is more forbearing, more\r\n\r\nforgiving.   HDB  has various schemes in  place  to  help\r\n\r\nborrowers, such as stretching of repayments, and  so  on.\r\n\r\nWe do not expect the banks to do so.  Neither should we.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they go to the bank for a loan, they have got\r\n\r\nto  do  their  sums.   And when  they  go  to  the  banks\r\n\r\ncurrently,  they may find that the banks may actually  be\r\n\r\nmore flexible than HDB.  They may find that the banks may\r\n\r\noffer them a lower interest rate than HDB.  They may find\r\n\r\nthat  the banks are willing to give them a longer  period\r\n\r\nof  loan.   I  understand that some banks will  allow  30\r\n\r\nyears  or  more.  HDB has a maximum, which is  less  than\r\n\r\nthat.  All this will have to be factored by the borrower.\r\n\r\nDo  you want to go to the bank to borrow or not?  Do  you\r\n\r\nwant  to buy that flat in the first place or not?   These\r\n\r\nare  decisions which individuals would have to make.   We\r\n\r\nare  not talking about facilitating the purchase  of  the\r\n\r\nfirst  flat.   This is what I explained  right  from  the\r\n\r\noutset.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first timers who want to purchase their first\r\n\r\nflat  go  to HDB, and it will provide them the subsidised\r\n\r\nloan,  provide them with a subsidised flat and they  will\r\n\r\nhave  their  first flat.  But, now, they are looking  for\r\n\r\nthe  second,  or  third flat, or they  are  PRs,  private\r\n\r\nproperty owners, or high income earners.  These  are  the\r\n\r\npeople who need to get a market rate loan.  These are the\r\n\r\nones  who have to go to the bank.  Is Mr Low saying  that\r\n\r\nthese people would also need to have a guarantee that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will help them if they default on their  bank\r\n\r\nloans?  Surely not.  So we are really talking about those\r\n\r\npeople  who do not need a concessionary loan, who already\r\n\r\nare  required to get a market rate loan from HDB.   These\r\n\r\nare  the  ones who will have to go to the bank to  get  a\r\n\r\nloan.   And these are the people who should be in a  good\r\n\r\nposition to judge whether they would like to get  a  loan\r\n\r\nat  that price or not.  In other words, you have to  make\r\n\r\nyour  decision based on your own situation.  You have  to\r\n\r\ndo your sums before you get the loan.  We are not talking\r\n\r\nabout those who\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  buying  HDB  flats for the first  time.   For  those\r\n\r\npeople, nothing has changed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe:</b> I just want to make a\r\n\r\nclarification.  In fact, I am asking for consideration to\r\n\r\nbe  given  to people who have bought subsidised flats  to\r\n\r\nrent out the whole flat, and I am really referring to the\r\n\r\nhardship  cases.   They have bought the subsidised  flats\r\n\r\nand  they  have stayed there for many years.   Sometimes,\r\n\r\nthey  want to sell it, but the market conditions  do  not\r\n\r\nallow  them to sell.  So why do you not consider allowing\r\n\r\nthem  to monetise the flat by renting it out for a  while\r\n\r\nand  get an income?  In the meantime, they can stay  with\r\n\r\ntheir children, or downgrade and rent a smaller flat.  So\r\n\r\nI  am  just asking that the Minister consider the appeals\r\n\r\non a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are already\r\n\r\ncertain  schemes in place for the cases  that  Mr  Othman\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier.  In other words, if you are staying in\r\n\r\na subsidised flat and you have financial difficulties, we\r\n\r\nalready  have  various  schemes in  place,  ranging  from\r\n\r\ndeferment  of your instalment payments, reduced repayment\r\n\r\nschemes,  and so on and so forth.  Quite a few  of  those\r\n\r\nwho  are  in financial difficulties and come to  HDB  for\r\n\r\nfinancial assistance have been put on these schemes.   So\r\n\r\nfar,  I believe these have been well received.

In his negotiations to\r\n\r\nbuy  a  property and take a loan from the bank, he cannot\r\n\r\nfactor  in  all  these factors of retrenchments  and  job\r\n\r\nloss.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought this is\r\n\r\nwhat  happens all the time.

Basically, what I am saying is that  if  you\r\n\r\nbuy  your second or third HDB flat, and you cannot get  a\r\n\r\nmarket rate loan from HDB, you go to the bank.  And  when\r\n\r\nyou  go to the bank, the bank will ask you questions, you\r\n\r\nwill  have to answer those questions.  Then you  have  to\r\n\r\ndecide whether you should proceed or not.  Can you afford\r\n\r\nit  or not?  And if the answer is yes, you can afford it,\r\n\r\ngo  ahead.  If the answer is no, you do not think you can\r\n\r\nafford  it,  you  are worried about the future,  you  are\r\n\r\nworried  about your job, you are not sure, just  keep  in\r\n\r\nview.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a bit strange, because here we are talking in\r\n\r\nthis House, and Members have said so, that we should give\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  more responsibility, we  should  not  be  a\r\n\r\nnanny  state, we should allow them to make up  their  own\r\n\r\nminds.  A simple thing like this where you have to decide\r\n\r\nwhether  you  should buy a flat and how much  you  should\r\n\r\npay,  these  are  things which every  responsible  person\r\n\r\nshould  be  able  to  decide and make  up  his  mind  for\r\n\r\nhimself.

It is estimated  that  50%  of\r\n\r\nlong-term  smokers will die prematurely in  their  middle\r\n\r\nage  without reaching the life expectancy of 76 years,  a\r\n\r\nloss  of  about  22  years of life.   Yet,  new  smokers,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  youth, are attracted to  the  habit  and\r\n\r\nbecome  addicted.   The World Health  Organisation  (WHO)\r\n\r\nestimates  that  about half of those who experiment  with\r\n\r\nsmoking  during  their adolescence, will  become  regular\r\n\r\nsmokers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.10 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Youth Tobacco Survey in 2000 showed\r\n\r\nthat in Singapore, 11% of the respondents aged 13-17  had\r\n\r\nsmoked on at least one day in the preceding month,  while\r\n\r\n4%  of  these  youths  smoked at least  20  days  in  the\r\n\r\npreceding month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking rates in Singapore had dropped to a low of\r\n\r\n14%  in  2001, from 18% in 1992, putting Singapore  among\r\n\r\nthe countries with the lowest smoking rates in the world.\r\n\r\nNonetheless,  the  National  Smoking  Control   Programme\r\n\r\ncontinues to actively work towards a smoke-free lifestyle\r\n\r\namong all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic tenet of the National Smoking Control\r\n\r\nProgramme is a multi-pronged approach to control smoking.\r\n\r\nThis  includes  public education, community  involvement,\r\n\r\nlegislation,  enforcement,  fiscal  measures,   and   the\r\n\r\nprovision  of smoking cessation services.   In  order  to\r\n\r\nsupport  this  approach, the legislation  on  smoking  is\r\n\r\nreviewed  and  updated regularly so as to  keep  up  with\r\n\r\nchanges  in  social trends as well as to adopt  the  best\r\n\r\npractices from other countries.  The Smoking (Control  of\r\n\r\nAdvertisements  and  Sale  of Tobacco)  (Amendment)  Bill\r\n\r\ntherefore  comprises a total of seven amendments  to  the\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now highlight the major new\r\n\r\nprovisions that are being introduced in this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first change is to prohibit the sale of\r\n\r\ncigarette  packs  containing  fewer  than  20  sticks  of\r\n\r\ncigarettes.   The rationale for prohibiting the  sale  of\r\n\r\ncigarette  packs  containing  fewer  than  20  sticks  of\r\n\r\ncigarettes  is to discourage the youths from starting  to\r\n\r\nsmoke.   Studies  have  shown  that  most  smokers  start\r\n\r\nsmoking  during adolescence.  Many start by experimenting\r\n\r\nwith  one or a few sticks of cigarettes before they start\r\n\r\nsmoking regularly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cigarette packs containing less than 20 cigarettes\r\n\r\nare more affordable to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nyoung  smokers  as  they cost less.   For  instance,  the\r\n\r\naverage  cost of a pack of 10 cigarettes is $3.50,  about\r\n\r\nhalf  the  price of a pack of 20 cigarettes, which  costs\r\n\r\nabout  $6.50.   The smaller packs can also  be  concealed\r\n\r\nmore easily from teachers and parents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a WHO publication, cigarette packs\r\n\r\ncontaining less than 20 sticks are, in fact, a  marketing\r\n\r\nstrategy  by the tobacco industry to specifically  target\r\n\r\nyoung smokers, who are experimenting with cigarettes  and\r\n\r\nhave  less purchasing power.  Australia, Canada,  certain\r\n\r\nstates in the United States of America and Thailand  have\r\n\r\nalso  banned the sale of small packs with fewer  than  20\r\n\r\ncigarettes to discourage experimentation by young people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second change is to increase the fine quantum of\r\n\r\nunderaged  smoking offences from $50  and  $100  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst and subsequent offences, to a flat $300 ceiling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the ongoing national smoking control\r\n\r\nefforts, the trend of smoking among youths aged 18  years\r\n\r\nand  below,  is  still  a  cause  for  concern.   From  a\r\n\r\nlegislative perspective, the current system of  penalties\r\n\r\nfor   underaged  smokers  does  not  pose  a   sufficient\r\n\r\ndeterrent effect and is also administratively cumbersome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 11(1) of the Act, an underaged youth\r\n\r\ncaught smoking, chewing, buying or possessing any tobacco\r\n\r\nproduct  is liable on conviction to a fine not  exceeding\r\n\r\n$50,   and   in  the  case  of  a  second  or  subsequent\r\n\r\nconviction,  to a fine not exceeding $100.  The  existing\r\n\r\namount  of fines is not sufficient to deter the  majority\r\n\r\nof  youth offenders who can generally afford the  amounts\r\n\r\nimposed.   The revision of the current penalty towards  a\r\n\r\nflat  $300 quantum would thus have a sufficient deterrent\r\n\r\neffect on the underaged youth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third change is to include an enabling clause to\r\n\r\nprovide for the imposition of conditions when compounding\r\n\r\noffences.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, underaged youths caught smoking are not\r\n\r\nrequired to fulfill any conditions other than to  face  a\r\n\r\nfine  of  $50  or  $100 upon conviction.   This  enabling\r\n\r\nclause   will   allow  conditions  to  be  imposed   when\r\n\r\ncompounding   offences  under  the  Act.   For   example,\r\n\r\nunderaged   smoking  offenders  and  their   parents   or\r\n\r\nguardians  could  be  conditionally  required  to  attend\r\n\r\nsmoking  cessation  counselling in order  to  have  their\r\n\r\noffences  compounded.  Recognising that peer pressure  is\r\n\r\nthe  main  reason why many youths pick up  smoking,  this\r\n\r\nmeasure  provides an excellent opportunity to communicate\r\n\r\nto both the youths and their parents not only the dangers\r\n\r\nof smoking, but also equip the youths with life skills to\r\n\r\nenable them to quit and stay smoke-free.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our survey shows that almost half of our young\r\n\r\nsmokers  have either one or both parents who smoke.   The\r\n\r\ncompulsory  participation of parents in  the  counselling\r\n\r\nprocess  will  also  enable the counsellors  to  motivate\r\n\r\nthese parents to quit smoking and serve as positive  role\r\n\r\nmodels for their children.  This example illustrates  how\r\n\r\nthe enabling clause allows both enforcement and education\r\n\r\nto  work hand in hand towards combating smoking among the\r\n\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth change is to include the listing of other\r\n\r\nconstituents   in  addition  to  tar  and  nicotine,   in\r\n\r\ncigarettes  imported or sold in Singapore.   The  current\r\n\r\nAct  prescribes the maximum allowable limits for tar  and\r\n\r\nnicotine   contained  in  the  emissions  of   cigarettes\r\n\r\nimported and sold in Singapore.  However, in addition  to\r\n\r\ntar  and  nicotine, cigarettes contain many other harmful\r\n\r\nand  cancer-causing constituents.  One  such  example  is\r\n\r\ncarbon monoxide, normally found in car exhaust fumes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, Canada's legislation requires cigarette\r\n\r\npacks  to  list  the  amount  of  tar,  nicotine,  carbon\r\n\r\nmonoxide,  benzene,  hydrogen  cyanide  and  formaldehyde\r\n\r\nfound in cigarette emissions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act will be amended to require the listing and\r\n\r\nits allowable limits of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconstituents  other than tar and nicotine.  This  measure\r\n\r\nserves to inform consumers about the poisonous and  toxic\r\n\r\nsubstances that are found in tobacco products and  serves\r\n\r\nas a deterrent to some people to smoke.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth change is to extend the current licensing\r\n\r\nof   tobacco   retailers   to   include   importers   and\r\n\r\ndistributors  of  tobacco  products.   At  present,   the\r\n\r\nlicensing  of  tobacco  retailers provides  a  system  of\r\n\r\nmonitoring  and  regulation  of  the  sales  of   tobacco\r\n\r\nproducts  at  the  retail  end.   However,  there  remain\r\n\r\ncertain  aspects of product compliance that  may  not  be\r\n\r\nwithin the direct influence of the retailer.  Examples of\r\n\r\nsuch  product  compliance include the  tar  and  nicotine\r\n\r\nlimits   of  cigarettes  and  mandatory  health   warning\r\n\r\nlabelling requirements of tobacco products.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, greater accountability for ensuring such\r\n\r\ncompliance  with  the licensing authority's  requirements\r\n\r\nshould  be placed on the industry source rather than  the\r\n\r\nsmall retail shops.  This would ensure, for example, that\r\n\r\nthe  Health  Warning Labelling regulations  are  properly\r\n\r\nimplemented at the distribution stage before the products\r\n\r\nare  supplied to retailers.  In addition, this will  also\r\n\r\nhelp  to tighten the distribution of tobacco products  to\r\n\r\nonly licensed retailers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be consistent with the approach that\r\n\r\nregulation of tobacco should begin at the source  of  the\r\n\r\ntobacco  supply chain, the current licensing  of  tobacco\r\n\r\nretailers  will  be  extended to  include  importers  and\r\n\r\ndistributors  of tobacco products.  In this  manner,  the\r\n\r\nsource  of the tobacco trade can be better monitored  and\r\n\r\nregulated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth change is to allow the serving of notice\r\n\r\nto  attend Court, to be done by other means.  The current\r\n\r\nAct  does not have specific provisions on the serving  of\r\n\r\nsummonses   and   notices.   In  the  absence   of   such\r\n\r\nprovisions, the Health Sciences Authority has to rely  on\r\n\r\nChapter  V of the Criminal Procedure Code on the  serving\r\n\r\nof such notices.  This provision requires that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuch  notices  be  delivered in person by  an  authorised\r\n\r\nofficer, a time consuming and resource intensive  method.\r\n\r\nIn  comparison, the Housing and Development Board has the\r\n\r\noption  to issue notices via registered post, as provided\r\n\r\nfor in the Housing and Development Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar provision will be incorporated into the\r\n\r\nAct  in order to allow the serving of notices to be  made\r\n\r\nby  other  more  efficient means such as  the  method  of\r\n\r\nregistered post.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final change is to refine the powers of\r\n\r\ninvestigation for authorised officers under the Act.   In\r\n\r\nthe  course of investigating offences under the Act,  the\r\n\r\ninvestigating  officer authorised by the Health  Sciences\r\n\r\nAuthority  may  be  required to  obtain  statements  from\r\n\r\npersons  involved in the investigation.  Similar  to  the\r\n\r\noption available to the National Environment Agency, such\r\n\r\npowers   of  investigation  are  provided  for   in   the\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Public Health Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar provision will be made in the Act to\r\n\r\nfacilitate the investigations of offences under  the  Act\r\n\r\nby the Health Sciences Authority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, the Ministry of Health believes\r\n\r\nthat a multi-pronged approach is needed to encourage non-smokers  to  stay smoke-free and smokers to give  up  the\r\n\r\nsmoking habit.  The amendments to the Act will complement\r\n\r\nthe  existing strategies, to ensure that the  legislative\r\n\r\nmeasures remain relevant to the social climate and on par\r\n\r\nwith the best practices from other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I\r\n\r\nspeak   in   support   of   the   Smoking   (Control   of\r\n\r\nAdvertisements and Sale of Tobacco) (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the World Health Organisation, smoking\r\n\r\nkills  three  and  a half million people worldwide  every\r\n\r\nyear and this works out to be about 10,000 deaths\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neach  day.   Smoking can cause cancer, heart disease  and\r\n\r\nstroke.   Seven Singaporeans die every day from  smoking-related  diseases  and about 15% of the population  still\r\n\r\nsmoke daily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cigarette smoking has been identified as the single\r\n\r\nmost  avoidable  cause of death.  It is common  knowledge\r\n\r\nthat  smoking  kills, but yet, the size of  the  hole  it\r\n\r\nburns  in  the  pockets of smokers and non-smokers  alike\r\n\r\nremains  huge.

A smoker with  a\r\n\r\ndaily habit of 20 sticks will end up paying $68,000  over\r\n\r\n30  years,  and  this  is not considering  the  potential\r\n\r\nmedical   costs   needed   for  smoking-induced   related\r\n\r\ndiseases.   In light of this, measures to further  reduce\r\n\r\nthe smoking habit are therefore most timely and welcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-smokers, children in particular, also suffer the\r\n\r\nill effects from cigarette smoke.  Therefore, smoking  in\r\n\r\npublic  areas that affects non-smokers should be  further\r\n\r\nexpanded to protect the non-smokers.  Madam, I would like\r\n\r\nto  support  the  call to ban smoking  at  bus-stops,  as\r\n\r\ncommuters  have  no choice but to wait around  for  their\r\n\r\nbuses to arrive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many Western countries with Anti-smoking\r\n\r\nActivists Groups; the one in America is especially active\r\n\r\nin  their  fight of tobacco use especially amongst  their\r\n\r\nyouth  and  in  lobbying  tobacco  companies  to  support\r\n\r\ncommunity  and sports programmes for their youth.   There\r\n\r\nis  no such Anti-smoking Activists Group now in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the  initiation of such a group should be encouraged\r\n\r\nby  the  Ministry  of Health.  It is likely  that  larger\r\n\r\nbusiness  corporations, especially the tobacco companies,\r\n\r\ndo  not  contribute as much to our community  and  sports\r\n\r\nprogrammes  because we do not have such  an  Anti-smoking\r\n\r\nActivists  Group.  Madam, I believe that these  companies\r\n\r\nshould   be   the  biggest  donors  to  sports  promotion\r\n\r\nprogrammes in aid of our youth and anti-cancer movements.\r\n\r\nThis  is  especially so when the young people  are  their\r\n\r\nbiggest and growing customer base and when cancer is  the\r\n\r\nleading cause of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndeath  and the third leading cause of hospitalisation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  An Anti-smoking Activists Group can  champion\r\n\r\nthis  and  ameliorate the rising incidence of  cancers  - lung cancer especially.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment to clause 11 of this Bill aims to ban the\r\n\r\nsale of smaller packs containing fewer than 20 sticks  of\r\n\r\ncigarettes to make the habit more expensive to pick up or\r\n\r\nsustain.  This is targetting especially the young  people\r\n\r\nwho  presumably have less money to spend.   If  they  see\r\n\r\npeople  around them smoking and if cigarettes  are  cheap\r\n\r\nand  readily  available to them, the  tendency  to  smoke\r\n\r\nwould  be higher.  A recent study in the British  Medical\r\n\r\nJournal found that even one puff for those aged 12 to  13\r\n\r\ncould  turn  them into addicts because their  brains  are\r\n\r\nstill  at  the  developmental stage and the younger  they\r\n\r\nstart, the more likely the habits are going to stay  with\r\n\r\nthem.    However,   the   argument  against   bigger-pack\r\n\r\ncigarettes  is  that the young smokers may encourage  and\r\n\r\npersuade  others  to share and split  the  cost,  thereby\r\n\r\nexpanding  the number of smokers.  Bigger packs  also  do\r\n\r\nnot  help  those  who are trying to  quit  or  to  reduce\r\n\r\nsmoking in terms of cost and in terms of temptation  with\r\n\r\na pack of 20 compared to a pack of 10.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation must result in the desired outcomes and\r\n\r\ngetting  the  public better informed on  regulations  and\r\n\r\nstricter  enforcement  of the rules  would  be  necessary\r\n\r\nhere.  Shopkeepers selling individual cigarettes claiming\r\n\r\nignorance and selling cigarettes to those below  18  must\r\n\r\nbe firmly penalised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to support the call for new measures to\r\n\r\nscare  young  smokers off the habit with  gory  pictures.\r\n\r\nSection   16   of   the  present  Smoking   (Control   of\r\n\r\nAdvertisements and Sale of Tobacco) Act provides for  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of labelling.  Will the Ministry of Health\r\n\r\ndraw  up  an  amendment  to the Labelling  Regulation  to\r\n\r\nimpose  requirement  on  the printing  of  gory  pictures\r\n\r\nportraying health hazard?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGory  pictures may work at first but it is likely, Madam,\r\n\r\nthat  people  become  immune to the same  pictures  after\r\n\r\nsometime.  Hence,  to  be  more  effective,  these   gory\r\n\r\npictures should be changed regularly.  It will be good if\r\n\r\nthe  pictures  depict the different  diseases  caused  by\r\n\r\nsmoking:   consider, for example, pictures  of  blackened\r\n\r\nlungs,  cancerous  lung growths, bloodied  brains,  brain\r\n\r\ntumours, fat-choked arteries, dead heart muscles, rotting\r\n\r\nteeth  and mouth diseases.  This way, not only do we  get\r\n\r\nthe  scaring effect, we also create more public awareness\r\n\r\non the side effects of smoking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 11% of teenagers from Secondary 1 through to\r\n\r\nSecondary 4 light up at least once a month, according  to\r\n\r\na  survey done a couple of years ago.  It seems that peer\r\n\r\npressure is an important influencing factor. The Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Health, in partnership with the schools, should  take\r\n\r\nincreased  measures  to address this.   The  anti-smoking\r\n\r\nmessage  should  be innovative and interesting  lest  the\r\n\r\nstudents  take  them for granted.  The  Health  Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard  can  step up efforts to empower our  young  people\r\n\r\nwith  life  skills to make sensible health and  lifestyle\r\n\r\nchoices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, many people do not fathom the dangers of\r\n\r\nsmoking  and,  therefore, there  should  be  more  public\r\n\r\neducation  on  the  various diseases caused  by  smoking.\r\n\r\nSome  schools,  supported by the Health Promotion  Board,\r\n\r\nhave  started anti-smoking clinics.  I would like to  see\r\n\r\nall  secondary schools having such clinics where students\r\n\r\ntrain  to spread the smoke-free message through a special\r\n\r\npeer-leader  training programme,  to  take  lead  in  the\r\n\r\nschool's   anti-smoking  efforts  and   to   offer   peer\r\n\r\ncounselling.   On  the  fact  that  female  smokers  have\r\n\r\nincreased  two  percentage points to eight  percent,  the\r\n\r\nrecent report by Canadian scientists that women who start\r\n\r\nsmoking  when they are teenagers are 70% more  likely  to\r\n\r\ndevelop   breast  cancer  than  non-smokers   should   be\r\n\r\npublicised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prevalence and increasing incidence of smoking\r\n\r\nin teenagers is most\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndisturbing.  Mdm Deputy Speaker, we must do more to  help\r\n\r\nthis  group.  Many people smoke because their environment\r\n\r\ninfluences them.  They are much more likely to  smoke  if\r\n\r\nthere are smokers surrounding them, or if their favourite\r\n\r\nfilm  stars smoke.  Most teen smokers think smoking makes\r\n\r\nthem  look  cool.   Therefore, steps  must  be  taken  to\r\n\r\nproject  a  \"smoke-free\" lifestyle as cool  and  socially\r\n\r\ndesirable.  Teenage idols and celebrities should be roped\r\n\r\nin more to promote this message.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, may I ask the Ministry of Health to consider\r\n\r\nsubsidising nicotine-free pills like the new drug  called\r\n\r\nZyban,  nicotine patches and a variety of  other  devices\r\n\r\nthat  help smokers quit the smoking habit?  Such products\r\n\r\nshould be given free to school children to help them quit\r\n\r\nsmoking.   Britain  and some European countries  supplied\r\n\r\nthe  new  drug,  Zyban, since the  year  2000  and  their\r\n\r\nDepartments of Health said that the money was  well-spent\r\n\r\nbecause the drug was particularly effective.  May I  urge\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Health to study their experience promptly\r\n\r\nin order to do likewise in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise\r\n\r\nto  speak  both as a Member of Parliament and a concerned\r\n\r\nmother  of  young  children  in  view  of  the  troubling\r\n\r\nstatistics among the youths on smoking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is commendable that Singapore has one of\r\n\r\nthe  lowest smoking rates in the world, with the national\r\n\r\nsmoking  rate dropping from 15% in 1998 to 14%  in  2001,\r\n\r\nsmoking among the young between the age groups of 18  and\r\n\r\n24  years  has held steady at 16% between 1998 and  2001,\r\n\r\ndespite an aggressive campaign against smoking.  This  is\r\n\r\nin  contrast  to  the declines in rates  for  those  aged\r\n\r\nbetween 25 and 44 years (from 15% to 14%) and those  aged\r\n\r\nbetween 45 and 64 years (from 15% to 12%).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of a school-based youth tobacco survey\r\n\r\ncarried out in 2000 are even more disturbing.  The survey\r\n\r\nfound\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  one in four students had tried smoking before,  and\r\n\r\none  in 10 had smoked at least one day in the past month,\r\n\r\neven  though  they are prohibited by law from  buying  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  smoking cigarettes as they are under  18  years\r\n\r\nold.   Although many of the 26% respondents who had tried\r\n\r\nsmoking may have done so out of curiosity, seasoned anti-smoking campaigners will confirm that, in many instances,\r\n\r\nthis is how the habit is initiated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, the then Minister for Health, Mr Yeo Cheow\r\n\r\nTong,  had noted that about half of the smokers had taken\r\n\r\nup the habit before the age of 18 years old.  In fact,  a\r\n\r\ngrassroots volunteer of my constituency, who is a smoker,\r\n\r\ntold  me  that most of his smoking friends had picked  up\r\n\r\nthe habit when they were young.  He himself had picked up\r\n\r\nthe  habit when he was still in school.  He further noted\r\n\r\nthat  he had observed an increase in the number of  young\r\n\r\nsmokers  and  he himself was worried for  his  two  young\r\n\r\nsons.   It is worthwhile to note that even he, who  is  a\r\n\r\nsmoker,  is now worried for his young sons whom he  fears\r\n\r\nwill take up the habit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2002, in response to a question posed by my\r\n\r\nfellow  Parliamentarian, Mdm Halimah Yacob, the  Minister\r\n\r\nof  State  for Health, Dr Balaji Sadasivan, had  reported\r\n\r\nthat a total of 131 retailers had been caught selling  or\r\n\r\nproviding  tobacco products to those  aged  18  years  or\r\n\r\nunder  since 1993.  This works out to an average of  some\r\n\r\n14-15  cases per year over a nine-year period, which,  as\r\n\r\nMdm Halimah had noted, and I concur, is very small.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I would like to ask the Minister how\r\n\r\nmany  youths  aged below 18 years have  been  caught  for\r\n\r\nsmoking,  buying and/or possessing cigarettes  since  the\r\n\r\nSmoking  (Control of Advertisements and Sale of  Tobacco)\r\n\r\nAct  came  into force in 1993.  If the numbers have  been\r\n\r\nincreasing  over the years, what punishments  were  meted\r\n\r\nout  to the offenders?  Additionally, what proportion  of\r\n\r\nthese offenders are repeat offenders?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would further like to ask the Minister what\r\n\r\nmechanisms have been put\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin place to allow for effective enforcement of the law to\r\n\r\nprevent  the  sale of cigarettes to those aged  below  18\r\n\r\nyears  as well as the purchase, possession and/or use  of\r\n\r\ncigarettes  by  this group.  I would  like  to  urge  for\r\n\r\ngreater vigilance in the enforcement of the law, as  this\r\n\r\nwould   surely  serve  as  one  of  the  more   effective\r\n\r\ndeterrents to our young against lighting up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neighbourhood police could work with the RCs and\r\n\r\nthe  schools  in order to be more effective  in  locating\r\n\r\nretailers  who contravene the Act as well as in  flushing\r\n\r\nout  underaged  smokers.  In some  of  my  block  visits,\r\n\r\nresidents  have informed me that they have seen  students\r\n\r\nin  school  uniform  smoking  at  staircases  and  common\r\n\r\ncorridors on the top floors of  HDB blocks where there is\r\n\r\nvery little pedestrian traffic.  We have, of course,  fed\r\n\r\nthis  back  to  the  police and  the  schools  concerned.\r\n\r\nRegular policing of such areas as well as stalls that may\r\n\r\nbe  selling  cigarettes to underaged smokers  would  help\r\n\r\nalleviate the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I note that the Bill seeks to further hinder\r\n\r\nthe  young  from smoking by banning the sale of cigarette\r\n\r\npacks  with  less  than  20 cigarettes,  as  well  as  by\r\n\r\nincreasing the fine payable by those aged below 18  years\r\n\r\nwho   are   caught  buying,  possessing  and/or   smoking\r\n\r\ncigarettes  to  $300 for any offence, up from  $50  to  a\r\n\r\nmaximum of $100 in the existing Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback from some members of the public regarding\r\n\r\nthe  sale  of larger packs to make smoking more expensive\r\n\r\nto  pick up and sustain, particularly amongst the  young,\r\n\r\nis  that  this may not be effective, as the  young  could\r\n\r\nsimply share it with their friends or be enticed to smoke\r\n\r\neven more, whilst others may simply be indifferent to the\r\n\r\nhigher price of a larger pack.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, the Health Promotion Board had noted\r\n\r\nthat   New  Zealand  had  experienced  some  success   in\r\n\r\ndeterring  young  smokers  when  it  adopted  a   similar\r\n\r\nmeasure.  It is further noted that according\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto   a   World  Health  Organisation  study  on   smoking\r\n\r\nbehaviour,  first-time buyers usually try  smaller  packs\r\n\r\ninitially.  Although the effectiveness of this measure to\r\n\r\nthwart  the  young from smoking may be minimal,  I  would\r\n\r\nstill  support  this move.  This is because  any  measure\r\n\r\nthat can further discourage the young from lighting up is\r\n\r\nclearly  worth a try and would add weight to the host  of\r\n\r\nmeasures   that  have  been  instituted,   including   an\r\n\r\naggressive anti-smoking education campaign.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also pleased to note that clause 8 of the Bill\r\n\r\nprovides  that  underaged  offenders  as  well  as  their\r\n\r\nparents  or  guardians can be asked to attend counselling\r\n\r\nsessions.  I feel that this, in combination with a higher\r\n\r\nfine  which is now proposed, is more meaningful than just\r\n\r\na  fine.  This is because, since most youths are  not  in\r\n\r\nthe labour force, the fines would either be picked up  by\r\n\r\ntheir  parents or they may be indifferent  if  they  come\r\n\r\nfrom  wealthy  families  and  have  been  given  generous\r\n\r\nallowance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to ask the Minister what\r\n\r\nformat  such counselling sessions would take and for  how\r\n\r\nlong  the sessions would be, as one would suspect that  a\r\n\r\none-off  counselling session of a few hours  may  not  be\r\n\r\neffective  for  reformative  purposes.   Additionally,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to suggest that some form of community  order\r\n\r\nbe instituted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young offender could be required to attend a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  sessions after school, say,  on  a  Saturday,\r\n\r\nwhere  he  could be counselled and taught the hazards  of\r\n\r\nsmoking,   constructive  use  of  leisure  time,   health\r\n\r\nalternatives to de-stress and so on.  Such sessions could\r\n\r\nhelp  to reform the offenders and, at the same time,  act\r\n\r\nas  a  deterrent, since it would deprive them of some  of\r\n\r\ntheir leisure time outside of school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, it has been reported that the strategy for\r\n\r\nincreasing  tobacco taxes has failed for the  first  time\r\n\r\nthis  year,  as a turf war between tobacco companies  had\r\n\r\nbrought prices down.  As affordability is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreported to be a major deterrent to smoking, I would like\r\n\r\nto propose that tobacco taxes be further raised, so as to\r\n\r\nnegate the impact of any price cuts by tobacco companies.\r\n\r\nAny  additional revenue generated from a further increase\r\n\r\nin tobacco tax could be channelled  to cancer research or\r\n\r\nany other programme related to the fight against smoking.\r\n\r\nThis  would  then  clearly dispel  any  notion  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is increasing taxes on tobacco  for  revenue.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  I  would  like to mention that  my  grassroots\r\n\r\nvolunteer  who is a smoker said that having higher  taxes\r\n\r\nand  hitting him harder in the pocket could spur  him  to\r\n\r\ntry harder to stop smoking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, whilst the national smoking rate has declined\r\n\r\nsince  the  Act was implemented in 1993, smoking  amongst\r\n\r\nthe  young remains a major concern.  Hence, we  must  not\r\n\r\nspare  any  effort in the fight to deter the  young  from\r\n\r\ntaking  up  this habit  -  from making it less affordable\r\n\r\nand less convenient to smoke, to persistent education and\r\n\r\nvigilant enforcement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, with this, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Madam, like others in this\r\n\r\nHouse, I am concerned that the percentage of smokers aged\r\n\r\nbetween 18 and 24 has remained unchanged since 1998.   It\r\n\r\nnow   stands   at  16%  of  the  age  group   and,   more\r\n\r\ndisturbingly, the female smokers among them has increased\r\n\r\n2  percentage points to 8%.  It is critical to discourage\r\n\r\nthe youngsters from smoking.  And, as the Minister noted,\r\n\r\nstudies  have  shown  that  someone  who  starts  smoking\r\n\r\nearlier  and younger finds it harder to quit  later.   It\r\n\r\nalso  increases their risk of getting diseases like  lung\r\n\r\ncancer earlier.  And for the women smokers, it would also\r\n\r\naffect the health of their babies as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government hopes to discourage smoking among the\r\n\r\nyoung by removing the smaller packets of cigarettes  from\r\n\r\nthe  market.   Only  20-stick packs  or  larger  will  be\r\n\r\navailable and these are more expensive.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise two points. First, many young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans now get generous pocket money from  parents.\r\n\r\nA  few  extra dollars will not make much of a difference,\r\n\r\nunlike those in other countries where a study cited shows\r\n\r\nthat  it  worked in New Zealand.  An average pack  of  20\r\n\r\nsticks  now sells for $6.50.  This is akin to  a  cup  of\r\n\r\nStarbucks  coffee  and a slice of  cake.   It  is  easily\r\n\r\naffordable  to most yuppy kids in Singapore.   I  suggest\r\n\r\nthat if the Government is serious about discouraging them\r\n\r\nto  smoke by using this method, it should raise the price\r\n\r\nof  cigarettes  even more.  It can do this by  increasing\r\n\r\nthe cigarette excise duties and increasing the number  of\r\n\r\nsmoking cessation programmes at the same time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it is widely recognised that peer pressure\r\n\r\nis one reason why youngsters smoke.  In my view, much has\r\n\r\nto  do  also with where they tend to hang out with  their\r\n\r\npeers  these  days, to look cool and to look fashionable.\r\n\r\nIf  you walk into some of our pubs and clubs, chances are\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  smoke-filled and through the  haze,  you\r\n\r\nwould see young women dangling cigarettes in their hands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies in other countries have shown that girls\r\n\r\napparently  smoke  in order to attract  men,  while  boys\r\n\r\nsmoke  to appear mature.  The club scene in Singapore,  I\r\n\r\nam told, is quite colourful and exciting.  And many clubs\r\n\r\nand  pubs  are  trying to reel in the  young  girls  with\r\n\r\nLadies'   Nights,  and  by  having  a  lower  age   entry\r\n\r\nrequirement for women than for men.  The strategy is that\r\n\r\nif  you get in the young girls, the men will follow.  But\r\n\r\nthese   are   environments  which  make  smoking   appear\r\n\r\nfashionable and cool.  Clubs  have a peer pressure effect\r\n\r\non  impressionable girls to smoke in order to  belong  to\r\n\r\nthe  in-crowd  and to appear more attractive.   A  random\r\n\r\nsurvey  of  adult pubs and clubs in Singapore shows  that\r\n\r\nmany allow women as young as 18-20 in, but often impose a\r\n\r\nhigher  age requirement for men, usually above  23.   For\r\n\r\ninstance, at Madam Wong's, you need to be only 20 if  you\r\n\r\nare  a woman to get into the club, but you have to be  23\r\n\r\nif   you  are  a  man.   At  Club  Eden,  the  entry  age\r\n\r\nrequirement for women is 21; for men,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nit  is  24.   At Double O, the entry age requirement  for\r\n\r\nwomen is 22; for men, it is 25.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned about this because these 20 to 21-year-old women are more impressionable, more susceptible\r\n\r\nto  peer pressure and are less mature than the older  men\r\n\r\nin  these  clubs.  Indeed, I hear that it is not uncommon\r\n\r\nto  see  older  men lighting up the cigarettes  of  young\r\n\r\ngirls  in some clubs.  So I do not think bigger packs  of\r\n\r\ncigarettes  will work.  As I see it, we  can  either  bar\r\n\r\nthese  girls  from environments which encourage  smoking,\r\n\r\nsuch   as  these  pubs  or  clubs,  or  clean  up   these\r\n\r\nenvironments that presently promote the image that it  is\r\n\r\ncool to smoke.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not go so far as to call for a ban on smoking\r\n\r\nin  bars, pubs and discos, at least not for now.   But  I\r\n\r\nwould  call  for a higher age entry requirement  for  the\r\n\r\nwomen, to be at least on par with the present requirement\r\n\r\nfor  the men.  However, this is left pretty much  to  the\r\n\r\ndiscretion  of  the clubs and pubs right  now.   Can  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  do  something  about  this?   The  Government\r\n\r\nshould also, at the same time, rope in the pubs and clubs\r\n\r\nin its No Smoking Campaign.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I understand that the Government is taking\r\n\r\na  multi-pronged  approach to discourage youngsters  from\r\n\r\nsmoking   -   from  legislation to public  education  and\r\n\r\napplying peer pressure to emphasising that staying smoke-free  is  cool, using stars as models.  While  I  support\r\n\r\nthis,  I  would  like to caution against  a  heavy-handed\r\n\r\napproach, as it would probably backfire.  Many youngsters\r\n\r\nsmoke  because of peer group pressure or to cock a  snook\r\n\r\nat  authority.  They are biologically programmed to  take\r\n\r\nrisk.  The more the Government tells them not to smoke or\r\n\r\nthat  they  would  die earlier if they do  and  die  from\r\n\r\nhorrible  diseases,  the more they find  it  exciting  to\r\n\r\nsmoke.   The danger with a heavy-handed approach is  that\r\n\r\nsmoking  will  become  a  symbol of  youthful  rebellion.\r\n\r\nHence, I would argue that if it is an uphill task getting\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmessage  across to the young, then let us put more  focus\r\n\r\nabout  tackling the environments which influence them  to\r\n\r\nsmoke.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Madam, thank you for allowing me\r\n\r\nto join in the debate.  I rise to support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking is an expensive and harmful habit. Like the\r\n\r\nrest of the speakers, I am particularly perturbed to  see\r\n\r\nyoung  people taking on this habit.  So I think it  is  a\r\n\r\ngood idea to sell cigarettes in packets of 20, instead of\r\n\r\nthe  present  small  packets of  10  cigarettes.   I  now\r\n\r\nrealise that you can buy drinks in Starbucks with a piece\r\n\r\nof  cake  for that amount.  So, it is not too  difficult,\r\n\r\nbut  if  by this move we make it more difficult for  even\r\n\r\nsome of our young to smoke, then it would have served its\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad to see that the Bill has closed the\r\n\r\nloopholes  of retailers breaking up packets  and  selling\r\n\r\ncigarettes  in  sticks.  The stiff  penalties  legislated\r\n\r\nmake  it  not worthwhile for retailers to do  so,  and  I\r\n\r\nsupport the stiff penalties proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a friend who was a heavy smoker. When he was\r\n\r\nasked  if  he knew that he was putting his life at  risk,\r\n\r\nthe  reply  was  that, statistically, his life  would  be\r\n\r\nshortened  by  just  a few minutes,  and  what  was  that\r\n\r\ncompared to a lifespan of over, as the Minister said,  76\r\n\r\nyears.  If a person can will the last few minutes to  the\r\n\r\nvery  end of his life, then there is no problem.  To  cut\r\n\r\nthe  story  short, he contracted cancer in his early  40s\r\n\r\nand  had one of his lungs removed.  He is now a wiser man\r\n\r\nand  has stopped smoking.  But at what a price!  And even\r\n\r\nat that, he is one of the luckier ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I strongly support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, first, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to thank all four MPs who rose to  speak  in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the  Bill.  This is a rare occasion  for  me\r\n\r\nwhere I am told I am not going far enough, and I need  to\r\n\r\nbe pushed forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said in my Second Reading speech, the anti-smoking programme is a multi-faceted programme. We must\r\n\r\npursue  different  strategies and from different  angles.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  are  discussing today is really the legislative\r\n\r\nchanges  to  make it possible for us to keep the  smoking\r\n\r\nrates   in  Singapore  under  control.   For  the   items\r\n\r\nspecifically  under  discussion today,  the  issue  about\r\n\r\nsmaller packs, I accept the different views.  Whether  it\r\n\r\nis  effective or not, I think it is worth trying.  And  I\r\n\r\nthank those who support it on that basis too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo suggested setting up an anti-smoking\r\n\r\nactivist group.  I think that is an excellent suggestion.\r\n\r\nWe will pass it on to HPB and to the Committee overseeing\r\n\r\nthis  and  see  how they can prompt or encourage  such  a\r\n\r\ngroup to be set up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need more enforcement, a point made by all\r\n\r\nthree  speakers.  We need greater vigilance,  enforcement\r\n\r\nof  the rules, particularly against retailers who sell to\r\n\r\nunderaged  smokers, and also on the offenders themselves.\r\n\r\nWhile in the Bill we have asked for increase in fines and\r\n\r\nalso  introduce  counselling, the  changes  will  not  be\r\n\r\neffective  if  these are not enforced.  So I  assure  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that with these additional powers and the existing\r\n\r\npowers,  we  are  taking and intending to  take  stronger\r\n\r\nenforcement of these rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the suggestion of labelling, whether to provide\r\n\r\nmore   graphic  or  pictorial  warnings,  this  is  under\r\n\r\nconsideration.   It  is proven to be quite  effective  in\r\n\r\nother  countries.   We  intend to also  review  this  and\r\n\r\nintroduce this in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also suggested that we subsidise\r\n\r\nnicotine-free  pills  in our Smoking  Cessation  Clinics.\r\n\r\nThis  is something that I will refer to the Committee  to\r\n\r\nlook at.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor and Ms Irene Ng both advocated very\r\n\r\nstrongly that the tobacco tax be further increased.   Let\r\n\r\nme assure the House that it is the Government's policy to\r\n\r\ncontinuously increase the tobacco tax to keep up at least\r\n\r\nwith the purchasing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npower of Singaporeans.  But, as Dr Amy Khor has observed,\r\n\r\nthis  year,  while we raise the tobacco tax by  20%,  the\r\n\r\ncigarette  manufacturers lowered  the  cigarette  prices,\r\n\r\nthereby negating the impact of the tobacco tax.  But this\r\n\r\nis  a  war  that we will continue to fight.   It  is  not\r\n\r\nfought over one year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng raised several suggestions on how to\r\n\r\ninfluence  the  environment  that  youths  patronise,  to\r\n\r\ndiscourage   them  from  smoking.   I  was   particularly\r\n\r\nintrigued  by  her  comment that  young  girls  smoke  to\r\n\r\nattract  man, and boys smoke to look mature.  I remember,\r\n\r\nsome  years ago, watching an advertisement which shows  a\r\n\r\nlady smoking and the caption saying: \"Do you want to kiss\r\n\r\nan  ashtray?\"   So, I am not sure whether a lady  smoking\r\n\r\nreally attracts man.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I think we agree with all the speakers that\r\n\r\nwe  have a big battle ahead.  It may be cynical, but  the\r\n\r\ncigarette  manufacturers  are  really  targeting  at  the\r\n\r\nyoung.  They know that smoking is addictive and they know\r\n\r\nthat   the   strategy  is  to  get  people  hooked   onto\r\n\r\ncigarettes.  I think this is a very cynical strategy but,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, it is the truth, and we have to combat  it\r\n\r\nat  every level.  As you can see from the amendments that\r\n\r\nwe  put  into  the  Bill, our effort is  really  strongly\r\n\r\ntargeted at the young people to try and persuade them not\r\n\r\nto get started on the first puff.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Members for their support and their many\r\n\r\nsuggestions.   We will take these up with  the  Committee\r\n\r\nlooking  into  this.   And I can assure  you  that  these\r\n\r\nsuggestions will be followed up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, could the Minister\r\n\r\nalso  address my question on the ban of smoking  at  bus-stops?   Could  he also enlighten us on the  anti-smoking\r\n\r\nefforts  in schools, whether more can be done,  and  what\r\n\r\nelse can be done?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As part of our strategy, we have\r\n\r\ntaken  anti-smoking in schools quite seriously.  We  have\r\n\r\nconducted talks.  We have brought role\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmodels,  people in the media, people in the entertainment\r\n\r\nindustry,  who  have agreed to help us in this  campaign.\r\n\r\nSo  they go to the schools and they serve as role models,\r\n\r\nand they try to persuade young Singaporeans not to smoke.\r\n\r\nSo  that  is  part of the strategy.  We try to  strike  a\r\n\r\nsensible balance, as Ms Irene Ng mentioned, when  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  the young.  I think you have seen our reply in  one\r\n\r\nof  the  newspapers.  Dealing with the young, we  do  not\r\n\r\nreally  want to put them off.  So you have got to  strike\r\n\r\nthis  balance.  I believe the Committee looking into this\r\n\r\nhas attempted to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the various suggestions about banning additional\r\n\r\nplaces,  this is something that we work closely with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  the Environment, whether it is  banning  of\r\n\r\nsmoking  in pubs or in other places, bus stops and  other\r\n\r\nareas.   This is something that we continuously  take  up\r\n\r\nwith the Ministry of the Environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to follow up on the query on the counselling\r\n\r\nsessions  mentioned  in  clause 8.

It is also something that Dr Amy Khor  raised.\r\n\r\nThis is something that the HPB and the various committees\r\n\r\nwill do on their own.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang:</b> Just a quick follow-up. Is it possible that in the suggestions on\r\n\r\ncounselling,  in  order  for  it  not  to   be   counter-productive,  due consideration is taken into getting  the\r\n\r\nunderlying  causes for teenagers to be easily  influenced\r\n\r\nby  peers  and to have some form of self-discipline  that\r\n\r\nthere   would  be  self-awareness,  sensitivity  training\r\n\r\nprovided for them to understand how to be assertive,  how\r\n\r\nto resist peer temptation and also the kind of inner self-discipline?  Because it appears that parents will also be\r\n\r\ninvolved.  Similarly on the problems with drug abuse,  if\r\n\r\nwe do not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntackle  those  underlying  causes,  then  some  of  these\r\n\r\nmeasures  could  be  just symptomatic treatment  and  not\r\n\r\nreally  that  effective  and, in  fact,  become  counter-productive.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I thank the Member for his\r\n\r\nadvice.

E. Lim (Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr David T. E. Lim):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I\r\n\r\nbeg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Introduction</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the debate on my Ministry's budget in May\r\n\r\nthis  year,  I  announced that MITA would  establish  the\r\n\r\nMedia  Development Authority of Singapore or MDA to  give\r\n\r\nfocus to the development of the media industry.  The  MDA\r\n\r\nwill  be  formed  by  merging the Singapore  Broadcasting\r\n\r\nAuthority  (SBA),  the Films and Publications  Department\r\n\r\n(FPD)  and  the Singapore Film Commission  (SFC)  into  a\r\n\r\nsingle statutory body.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MDA Bill provides the legislative framework for\r\n\r\nthe establishment of this new statutory board.  Before  I\r\n\r\ngo  into the Bill proper, let me first elaborate  on  the\r\n\r\nrationale for forming the MDA.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Need to Form the MDA</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to form the MDA is driven largely by the\r\n\r\nconvergence  of different media, and the emergence  of  a\r\n\r\ncluster  of  high  potential growth and high  value-added\r\n\r\nactivities in the media industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, technology has blurred the lines between\r\n\r\ndifferent  types of media.  Movies, for example,  can  be\r\n\r\nwatched at cinemas, on television, and over the Internet.\r\n\r\nWe   get   our  news  from  the  newspapers,  radio   and\r\n\r\ntelevision,  and  also over SMS, MMS  and  the  Internet.\r\n\r\nMore    changes    are   coming.    Wireless    broadband\r\n\r\ntechnologies, for example, promise to bring about greater\r\n\r\nconvenience,  more  powerful communications  capabilities\r\n\r\nand wider reach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of new media channels has also spurred\r\n\r\nthe development of new content.  Contents are now created\r\n\r\nwith not just one channel in mind, but with the intent of\r\n\r\nbeing  used  and  shared across many different  channels.\r\n\r\nLikewise,  industry support capabilities, like production\r\n\r\nhouses,  are  structured  to support  multiple  forms  of\r\n\r\nmedia.   And  new content development capabilities,  like\r\n\r\nthe   use   of  animation  and  films,  are  also   being\r\n\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its report, the Economic Review Committee (ERC)\r\n\r\nSub-Committee  on Service Industries projected  that  the\r\n\r\ncreative  cluster, of which media is a significant  part,\r\n\r\ncould  contribute 6% to Singapore's GDP in 10  years,  up\r\n\r\nfrom  between  2.8% and 3.2% in 2000.  Specifically,  the\r\n\r\nmedia industry is targeted to double from 1.6% of GDP  to\r\n\r\n3.5%  over the same period.  It is therefore an important\r\n\r\nindustry for Singapore, and one that has the potential to\r\n\r\ncreate many good jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These developments have two main implications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, a single authority is needed to respond to\r\n\r\nthe  needs of the cluster of media industries.  A  single\r\n\r\nauthority would be able to develop strategies and  devise\r\n\r\nschemes to facilitate the development\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  new  innovative  contents across all  media,  and  to\r\n\r\nrespond  quickly to the rapidly changing  technology  and\r\n\r\nbusiness environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, a single authority will be in a better\r\n\r\nposition  to  develop  and  administer  a  practical  and\r\n\r\nappropriate censorship regime that takes into account the\r\n\r\ndifferent  nature,  impact and  viewership  of  different\r\n\r\nmedia.  It would be able to regulate media companies with\r\n\r\nmore  flexibility,  greater consistency  and  operational\r\n\r\neffectiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Roles of the MDA</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MDA will therefore have two primary functions - as a content regulator, and to develop the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On content regulation, MITA's view is that media\r\n\r\ncontinues  to play an important and significant  role  in\r\n\r\nnation  building.  One of the MDA's key  objectives  will\r\n\r\ntherefore  be  to  protect Singapore's  core  values  and\r\n\r\nsafeguard the interest of consumers.  To do this, it will\r\n\r\ntake  over the licensing and regulatory functions of  SBA\r\n\r\nand FPD, and administer the relevant Acts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On industry development, the MDA will play a number\r\n\r\nof  roles.   Firstly, the MDA will promote the growth  of\r\n\r\nthe  media  industry, working closely with  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  (EDB) and other agencies  to  attract\r\n\r\ninvestments  to  Singapore.   It  would  use  its  domain\r\n\r\nknowledge  to work with the industry and other Government\r\n\r\nagencies   to   build  up  the  creative  and   technical\r\n\r\ncapabilities we need.  It will drive the Media 21 vision,\r\n\r\nwhich  aims  to  develop Singapore into a vibrant  global\r\n\r\nmedia  city,  specialising in the creation,  development,\r\n\r\ndistribution and trading of media content and copyrights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the MDA will play an important role in\r\n\r\nmaintaining   fair  and  efficient  market  conduct   and\r\n\r\neffective competition in the media industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Media competition was introduced in June 2000 to\r\n\r\ngive viewers and readers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore media choices and higher quality content.  This  has\r\n\r\nresulted   in   innovative  offerings  from   the   media\r\n\r\ncompanies.  However, given the relatively small  size  of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore market, competition is likely to be limited\r\n\r\nto  just a few players.  Competition today is between two\r\n\r\nleading  media companies, each dominant in  one  area  of\r\n\r\ntraditional media - television or newspapers.   There  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  a need to ensure that the competition  between\r\n\r\nthese  players  is  not dysfunctional,  and  that  public\r\n\r\ninterests and social goals are not compromised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MDA will therefore be empowered to implement a\r\n\r\ncompetition  code for the media industry.   Such  a  code\r\n\r\nwould  lay  out the ground rules for fair market  conduct\r\n\r\nwithin the sector, provide a more transparent competition\r\n\r\nframework,  and  prevent the abuse of  market  powers  by\r\n\r\ndominant  media  companies, to  ensure  that  quality  is\r\n\r\nmaintained.   Competition codes are already in  place  in\r\n\r\ncountries,  such  as  Britain and  Australia,  to  ensure\r\n\r\nhealthy competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBA circulated a draft media competition code to the\r\n\r\nindustry  in April this year.  The comments and  feedback\r\n\r\nfrom  the industry are currently being reviewed, and  the\r\n\r\ncode  will  be released by the first half of  next  year,\r\n\r\nafter the MDA is formed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me move on to the MDA Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The MDA Bill</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MDA Bill provides for the establishment and\r\n\r\nconstitution of the new statutory board and outlines  its\r\n\r\nmain  functions,  duties and powers.   I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nhighlight some of the key aspects of this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 11 and 12 of Part III set out the functions,\r\n\r\nduties and powers of the Authority.  The primary function\r\n\r\nof  the  MDA  is  to  exercise licensing  and  regulatory\r\n\r\nfunctions  in  respect  of media services  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nincluding the establishment of guidelines and standards\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor media content, and any equipment or facility used  to\r\n\r\nprovide  these  services.   In  addition,  the  MDA  will\r\n\r\nencourage, promote and facilitate the development of  the\r\n\r\nmedia industries in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of its functions, the MDA will also\r\n\r\nadminister the following media-related legislation:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) The Newspaper and Printing Presses Act;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The Undesirable Publications Act;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) The Films Act;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) The Broadcasting Act, which is the renamed\r\n\r\nSingapore Broadcasting Authority Act; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) The arts entertainment licensing aspect of the\r\n\r\nPublic Entertainments and Meetings Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislative approach taken is to not make any\r\n\r\nsubstantive   changes  to  these  Acts  that   MDA   will\r\n\r\nadminister.  This is because the various Acts have served\r\n\r\nour  national objectives well.  The focus of  this  Bill,\r\n\r\ntherefore, is the merger of the various units to form the\r\n\r\nMDA.   After  the MDA is formed, MITA will  review  these\r\n\r\nActs, and propose further amendments as necessary to deal\r\n\r\nwith convergence and other issues that may arise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Part IV of the MDA Bill addresses an\r\n\r\nimmediate issue that needs to be dealt with, which is the\r\n\r\ncompetition framework for the media industry.  Clauses 16\r\n\r\nto  27  are provisions to allow the MDA to maintain  fair\r\n\r\nand efficient market conduct and effective competition in\r\n\r\nthe  media  industry, and also to prevent the  misuse  of\r\n\r\nmonopoly or market power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisions in the MDA Bill are essential to\r\n\r\nprovide  legislative powers for the  statutory  board  to\r\n\r\nintervene   in  competition-related  matters,   and   are\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  safeguard against the potential  abuse  of\r\n\r\nmarket powers by dominant media companies.  The MDA  will\r\n\r\nbe empowered to intervene in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompetition-related matters that have an  impact  on  the\r\n\r\nindustry,  including  mergers  and  consolidations   that\r\n\r\ninvolve   media   companies,   agreements   that    could\r\n\r\nunreasonably  restrict competition  and  restrictions  on\r\n\r\naccess  to  essential  resources.   The  provisions  also\r\n\r\ninclude  a  maximum financial penalty of  $1  million  to\r\n\r\ndeter  anti-competitive behaviour,  which  is  consistent\r\n\r\nwith that prescribed in the Telecommunications Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also includes provisions relating to staff,\r\n\r\nfinancial  matters,  and transfer of assets,  liabilities\r\n\r\nand  employees, which are similar to the  Acts  of  other\r\n\r\nstatutory boards.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mdm Deputy Speaker, the formation of\r\n\r\nthe  MDA  will benefit the industry and the public.   The\r\n\r\nMDA will provide a focus for the development of our media\r\n\r\nindustry.   As  a single authority, it will  enhance  the\r\n\r\nefficiency and effectiveness of our regulatory regimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of the MDA is timely, as it would be\r\n\r\nwell positioned to respond to the recommendations of  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Review  Committee as  well  as  the  Censorship\r\n\r\nReview  Committee  on  matters pertaining  to  the  media\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MITA is confident that the MDA, with its focus on\r\n\r\nthe  media  industry, will be instrumental in  developing\r\n\r\nSingapore into a vibrant global media city and contribute\r\n\r\nto the development of a creative economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nI rise in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me declare my interest. I am the Vice-Chairman of the NTUC Media Cooperative and Board Member\r\n\r\nof  the  Infocomm Development Authority.  And as a result\r\n\r\nof  my  21  years  as  a journalist, I  have  many  media\r\n\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I have deep admiration for them who must meet\r\n\r\ndeadlines every day and, following the liberalisation  of\r\n\r\nthe  media since June 2000, every minute is deadline  for\r\n\r\nmany of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Media Development Authority of Singapore Bill\r\n\r\nsets  out  the functions and powers of MDA.   While  MITA\r\n\r\nforesees  that  the formation of the MDA will  contribute\r\n\r\npositively  to Singapore's media sector and  benefit  the\r\n\r\npublic, I wish to highlight three concerns of its  impact\r\n\r\non the media scene.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the first concern is on the standards of\r\n\r\nperformance  mentioned in clause  17  of  the  Bill.   My\r\n\r\nquestions are:  who sets the standards?  At which  level?\r\n\r\nAre  they  the standards set by the media industry?   Are\r\n\r\nthey  the  standards set by MITA in the interest  of  the\r\n\r\nreaders  and viewers?  Will there be different  kinds  of\r\n\r\nstandards  for  different media?  And how widely  has  it\r\n\r\nbeen consulted?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I ask this question because I have observed\r\n\r\nour   media  scene  and  understand  the  aspiration  and\r\n\r\nfrustration, the satisfaction and disappointment  of  the\r\n\r\njournalists, readers, listeners and viewers in  the  past\r\n\r\ndecades.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 70s and 80s, we were discussing and debating\r\n\r\nwhat kind of media model was more suitable for Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  talked about the American style of journalism, the UK\r\n\r\nmodel  and  the Japanese model.  In the end, we developed\r\n\r\nour  own  brand of journalism, the Singapore  Model.   In\r\n\r\nshort,  the media is part of the virtuous cycle  of  good\r\n\r\ngovernment  and good society.  That is the  role  PM  Goh\r\n\r\nadvocated  at the Straits Times' 150th Anniversary,  five\r\n\r\nyears  ago.  Yes, Straits Times is now 157 years old  and\r\n\r\nLianhe  Zaobao  will be celebrating its 80th  Anniversary\r\n\r\nnext  year.   The  media is part of the  virtuous  cycle.\r\n\r\nThey  have  their long histories, performance  standards,\r\n\r\nvalues   and  cultures.   Thus,  the  kind  of  standards\r\n\r\nmentioned  in  the Bill must bear in mind  the  unwritten\r\n\r\nstandards  set  in  these media organisations  which  are\r\n\r\nalready scrutinised by the readers and viewers every day,\r\n\r\nevery hour.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, my second concern is the code of practice\r\n\r\nmentioned in the same clause.  The MDA Bill provides  for\r\n\r\nthe  Authority  to issue a Competition Code  to  regulate\r\n\r\ncompetition  so  that  competition  continues   to   stay\r\n\r\nrelevant  and  constructive.   I  understand  that  MDA's\r\n\r\nobjective  is to maintain fair and effective competition,\r\n\r\nas mentioned by the Acting Minister just now, and provide\r\n\r\nfor  safeguards against dominant media companies  abusing\r\n\r\ntheir market powers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, our principal interest is to ensure that\r\n\r\ncompetition  does  not lead to a decline  in  quality  or\r\n\r\ndepth.   With  competition, there  must  continue  to  be\r\n\r\npublic  service  and  a  value  system  that  serves  the\r\n\r\nnational interest and community.  Thus, I would urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister to introduce a code that regulates with a  light\r\n\r\ntouch rather than enforce close policing in such a way as\r\n\r\nto   end   up   stifling  competition,   creativity   and\r\n\r\ninnovation.  After all, the media here does not resort to\r\n\r\nsensationalism,   or   untruths,   just    to    generate\r\n\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, my third concern is the power of MDA. It is\r\n\r\nso  powerful that it seems that it is more of a regulator\r\n\r\nrather  than a champion and promoter of the industry,  as\r\n\r\nthe  word \"development\" in its name may imply.  MDA  will\r\n\r\noversee   the   licensing  and  content   management   of\r\n\r\nbroadcasts,  films, publications and arts  entertainment.\r\n\r\nMDA  will  also be tasked to administer the  Broadcasting\r\n\r\nAct,   the  Newspaper  and  Printing  Presses  Act,   the\r\n\r\nUndesirable  Publications Act, the  Films  Act,  and  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Entertainments  and  Meetings  Act.   It  is   so\r\n\r\npowerful that it is tantamount to be a mini-MITA.  I  can\r\n\r\nforesee that the Chairman and board members will have  an\r\n\r\nextremely challenging role in shaping the development  of\r\n\r\nthe  media scene in Singapore, especially in the  age  of\r\n\r\nnew economy and the convergence of media.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as Prime Minister Goh said at the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes' 150th Anniversary Celebrations:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"You can be proud because you have reported without\r\n\r\nbeing corrupt, adversarial or sycophantic.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this remains the spirit of our media industry\r\n\r\nwith the birth of the MDA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, many people\r\n\r\nin  the arts circle and the media industry hope that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment would not maintain the very strict  stance  on\r\n\r\ncensorship and hope that the Government would  lean  more\r\n\r\ntowards a less strict regulatory model in relation to the\r\n\r\nmedia  and the arts.  But it would appear from this  Bill\r\n\r\nthat it is not going to be so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typical of the authoritarian and paternalistic style\r\n\r\nof the PAP, it wants to continue with a strict censorship\r\n\r\nregime.  In these modern times, with the proliferation of\r\n\r\nthe  computer and fast widespread communication with  the\r\n\r\nInternet,  I do not think that strict censorship  can  be\r\n\r\neffective.   In  fact,  it is holding  Singapore  society\r\n\r\nback.   Singapore  wants to be a modern,  urban  society.\r\n\r\nThe  Government wants to make it a Renaissance City.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  wants  the  city to be dynamic,  vibrant  and\r\n\r\ncreative.   But  while promoting these enlightened  aims,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  still wants to maintain the  nanny-state\r\n\r\nstatus  of  Singapore.  How can the arts  and  the  media\r\n\r\nprogress, grow and compete with those of other countries,\r\n\r\nif  the  Government continues to treat its citizens  like\r\n\r\nchildren?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that while we all agree that pornography,\r\n\r\nunhealthy  and  destructive  pronouncements  in  politics\r\n\r\ntouching on issues of race, language or religion have  to\r\n\r\nbe  curbed, and we also believe that our children have to\r\n\r\nbe protected from harmful smut and pornography, this does\r\n\r\nnot   mean   that  there  should  be  a  blanket   strict\r\n\r\ncensorship.  It is time the Government started to  review\r\n\r\nits  policy of strict censorship.  The Government  should\r\n\r\nconsider,  in  the  alternative, a  model  of  regulatory\r\n\r\ndevices,  noting  the  conservative sensitive  nature  of\r\n\r\ncertain  groups  of our population.  For  an  enlightened\r\n\r\nregulatory  model to be accepted by the majority  of  the\r\n\r\npeople, it is best that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment should not take into its own hands the duty of\r\n\r\ndrawing  up the regulations but, rather, get all sections\r\n\r\nand representatives of various interest groups to draw up\r\n\r\nthe  regulations.  In this way, once the regulations  are\r\n\r\nmade  and enforced, it cannot be said that they were  the\r\n\r\nsole work of the Government, but rather they are made  by\r\n\r\nthe  general  consensus of the people and shall  be  more\r\n\r\nacceptable  by the public.  Whatever it is, I would  like\r\n\r\nto  urge the Government to stop treating Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nnanny  state,  but  to  open  up  the  society  and  give\r\n\r\nSingaporeans a chance to mature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should now like to comment on some of the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Bill.  I note that the enforcement  of\r\n\r\nthe  Public Entertainments and Meetings Act (PEMA), after\r\n\r\nthe  MDA  Bill  is passed, shall no longer be  under  the\r\n\r\npurview  of  the Ministry of Home Affairs.  I  hope  that\r\n\r\nMITA  shall be more flexible than the MHA in interpreting\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of the Public Entertainments and Meetings\r\n\r\nAct,  and allow me, as an Opposition MP, to make speeches\r\n\r\nat my Party dinners held in my own constituency.  Can the\r\n\r\nMinister in charge of PEMA give me an assurance that,  as\r\n\r\nan  Opposition  MP, I shall not be gagged in  future  but\r\n\r\nshall  be allowed to make speeches at functions organised\r\n\r\nby my Party in my constituency?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to refer to clause 5 concerning the\r\n\r\nmembership  of  the Authority.  Clause 5 cites  that  the\r\n\r\nAuthority  shall comprise \"a Chairman and not  less  than\r\n\r\nfive  but  not more than 16 other members,  all  of  whom\r\n\r\nshall be appointed by the Minister\".  In other words, the\r\n\r\nMinister  is  given  a  completely free  hand  to  choose\r\n\r\nwhoever he wants to be in the Authority.  I would imagine\r\n\r\nthat  it  would be more rational if the Bill specifically\r\n\r\nstates  that  the  Minister must choose  members  of  the\r\n\r\nAuthority from certain professions or occupations.   That\r\n\r\nwould  make  the Authority more representative  and  more\r\n\r\nbalanced.   I  think the Minister should include  in  the\r\n\r\nmembership  of  the  Authority representatives  from  the\r\n\r\nlocal    arts   circles,   the   universities,   parents'\r\n\r\nassociations and the different groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the functions and duties of the Authority\r\n\r\nmentioned  in  clause 11 of the Bill, I  would  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to use a light hand rather than a heavy  hand.\r\n\r\nThe Government should have, as its aim, to eventually  do\r\n\r\naway   with  censorship  and  make  Singapore   a   truly\r\n\r\nRenaissance City, when Singapore shall bloom  as  a  city\r\n\r\nrenowned for its art and culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  thank you for allowing me to speak on  the  MDA\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I can fully appreciate the rationale of the\r\n\r\nMedia  Development  Authority  of  Singapore  Bill,   and\r\n\r\nbelieve  that it is timely.  In this era of  mergers  and\r\n\r\nacquisitions, the formation of MDA as a single  authority\r\n\r\nto coordinate the regulation and development of the media\r\n\r\nindustry  across the different media platforms,  such  as\r\n\r\nprinting  media, cyberspace and the airwaves, is sensible\r\n\r\nand logical.  I believe that the aim is to streamline the\r\n\r\nroles  of  the  different  agencies  and  to  give   more\r\n\r\nflexibility and greater consistency to the Authority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As explained by the Minister, the MDA will also be\r\n\r\ntaking over the roles of such organisations as the  Films\r\n\r\nand  Publications Department, the Singapore  Broadcasting\r\n\r\nAuthority  and  the  Singapore Film Commission.   All  of\r\n\r\nthese  will  come  under  the  purview  of  MDA.   As  an\r\n\r\nintegrated statutory board, it will oversee the licensing\r\n\r\nand  content management of broadcast, films, publications\r\n\r\nand arts entertainment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be that as it may, Madam, it is noted that the Bill\r\n\r\nhas  not attempted to make any substantive changes to the\r\n\r\nrelevant  Acts which MDA is tasked to administer.   I  am\r\n\r\nquestioning the wisdom of this move.  The past  10  years\r\n\r\nhave seen the world changed drastically, due to the rapid\r\n\r\nscientific     and    technological    advancement     in\r\n\r\ncommunications   and   the  media   industry.    Internet\r\n\r\ntechnology,  handphones, PDAs and other mobile  solutions\r\n\r\nare  just some of the things that are now part and parcel\r\n\r\nof   our  lives.   Moving  forward,  we  will  see   more\r\n\r\ndevelopments and breakthroughs in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommunications  field  and,  as  we  speak,  Madam,  more\r\n\r\npeople,  even  those from the Third World countries,  are\r\n\r\nstarting to use or are considering the usage of satellite\r\n\r\ncommunications and satellite television.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago, I had the opportunity to be part\r\n\r\nof  the team to welcome some parliamentarians from  Iran.\r\n\r\nIn  our discussions with them, they also highlighted  the\r\n\r\nchallenges that they are facing to balance their  efforts\r\n\r\nto   embrace  new  technologies  like  the  Internet  and\r\n\r\nsatellite communications for all its benefits against the\r\n\r\nrisks of exposure to undesirable contents that they  want\r\n\r\nto  protect their people from.  They had wanted  to  hear\r\n\r\nfrom  us  and  hoped  to learn from our  experiences.   I\r\n\r\nthought it was quite flattering that they even considered\r\n\r\nus  as  a  country to learn from.  The point  that  I  am\r\n\r\nhighlighting is that even a country like Iran, which  has\r\n\r\na  reputation, rightly or wrongly, as being conservative,\r\n\r\nis  also toying with the idea of satellite communications\r\n\r\nand satellite television.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am wondering, Madam, what is our present status\r\n\r\nnow.   Have  we made any progress in this area?   Are  we\r\n\r\npreparing  ourselves  for  these  changes?   Is  the  new\r\n\r\nAuthority, MDA, equipped and ready to come out  with  new\r\n\r\ninitiatives and strategies?  I personally was  pleasantly\r\n\r\nsurprised  when Prime Minister Goh, in his  National  Day\r\n\r\nRally  speech,  mentioned about bar-top  dancing.   I  am\r\n\r\nhappy not because of the bar-top dancing but by the  fact\r\n\r\nthat the Prime Minister is aware of the situation on  the\r\n\r\nground  -  the  diverse views, the different  lifestyles,\r\n\r\nrequests and demands of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I believe we have arrived at the\r\n\r\njuncture of our country's development and growth where we\r\n\r\nare  expected to deliver something different.  Do  things\r\n\r\ndifferently  and do not always stick to the  old  formula\r\n\r\nthat  has  served  us well.  Let us strive  to  make  our\r\n\r\npeople  more  resilient and strong.  I  believe  that  we\r\n\r\ncannot afford to continuously shield\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  protect them from undesirable contents.   Should  we\r\n\r\nnot  start  to let them learn to fend for themselves  and\r\n\r\nlearn    to    develop   life   skills    and    personal\r\n\r\nresponsibilities towards their families  and  themselves?\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  we  should  continue  to  emphasise  on   the\r\n\r\neducation  and soft aspects of our development that  will\r\n\r\nmake our society and country even stronger in the face of\r\n\r\nmore  daunting  challenges far more  difficult  than  the\r\n\r\nundesirable contents that we are shielding them from.  To\r\n\r\ntop  it  all,  it is becoming more difficult  and  almost\r\n\r\nimpossible  to  effectively perform this protector  role,\r\n\r\ndue  to  rapid technological advancements as well as  the\r\n\r\nfact that Singaporeans travel extensively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I am glad that MITA sees the formation of MDA\r\n\r\nas  a  body that will contribute positively to the  local\r\n\r\nmedia industry.  The area that I hope that would be given\r\n\r\nsome attention and assistance would be the film industry.\r\n\r\nBack  in  the 1950s and 1960s, the local film  and  movie\r\n\r\nindustry  was  thriving,  and we  produced  many  classic\r\n\r\nmovies  and we were considered as one of the main sources\r\n\r\nof  quality  productions.  But, now, gone are  the  glory\r\n\r\ndays of Jalan Ampas, Cathay Film Production and Shaw Film\r\n\r\nProduction.  But the recent development of the local film\r\n\r\nindustry  with  the  emergence of talented  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  Jack Neo, Eric Khoo and the likes,  are  making\r\n\r\nwaves  with  their films like \"Money No Enough\",  \"I  Not\r\n\r\nStupid\", \"12 Storeys\", and \"Mee Pok Man\".  And it is very\r\n\r\nencouraging.  It is my hope, Madam, that MDA will take  a\r\n\r\nmore  active role to promote this industry.  We  can  see\r\n\r\nthat  we  do  have  talents in our  midst.   Furthermore,\r\n\r\nSingapore  and the region are not short of  resources  to\r\n\r\ncome up with respectable quality products and maybe,  one\r\n\r\nday,  we will see a Singaporean winner at the Cannes Film\r\n\r\nFestival and even at other competitions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I believe that the new Authority\r\n\r\nand  its relevant agencies must begin to take inputs from\r\n\r\nthe  industry players as their experience in the industry\r\n\r\nis  worth  more  than any advice from  academic  experts.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, MDA should\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot be seen as always giving bureaucratic directions but,\r\n\r\nrather,  it must be a partner of the stakeholders  -  the\r\n\r\nindustry  players, artistes, actors, directors  and  many\r\n\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we have made lots of progress and strides to\r\n\r\npromote  the  local  media, entertainment  and  the  arts\r\n\r\nscene.  I have to commend MITA in their efforts.  Looking\r\n\r\nforward,  it  may be worthwhile for MITA to  continuously\r\n\r\nreview  and upgrade its policies and programmes to remain\r\n\r\nrelevant.   I have to admit that it is not an easy  task.\r\n\r\nBut  it  will  certainly  make the  overall  effort  more\r\n\r\nmeaningful  and  it will help strengthen the  local  film\r\n\r\nindustry in particular and the entertainment industry  in\r\n\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Madam, this Bill marks a\r\n\r\nsignificant change for the media industry.  The Bill will\r\n\r\ncreate a super multimedia regulator authorised to,  among\r\n\r\nother  things,  develop  codes of  practice  relating  to\r\n\r\ncontent  or  technical standards for media  services,  or\r\n\r\nrelating to standards of fair market conduct in any media\r\n\r\nindustry, and also to monitor compliance with such codes.\r\n\r\nMore  significantly,  the  Bill  also  provides  for  the\r\n\r\nAuthority  to  issue  a  Competition  Code  to   regulate\r\n\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I want to point out that this Bill comes\r\n\r\nabout  two years after limited competition was introduced\r\n\r\nin the media sector.  Since then, the two media giants in\r\n\r\nSingapore  - Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) and MediaCorp\r\n\r\n-  have  forayed into each other's turf.  In the  earlier\r\n\r\nphase,  the media industry saw a flurry of rapid changes.\r\n\r\nMediaCorp  started  publishing a daily  newspaper  called\r\n\r\nToday in June 2000, while MediaWorks, SPH's new broadcast\r\n\r\narm,  was  licensed to run two free-to-air TV channels  - Channel I and Channel U.  SPH also started publishing the\r\n\r\ntabloids   Streats   and  Project  Eyeball,   the   first\r\n\r\nintegrated  print  and  cyberspace  news  publication  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, executives of Today at MediaCorp,\r\n\r\nits major owner, have painted\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  painful  start for Today over distribution  and  other\r\n\r\nmatters  that  were once monopolised by  SPH,  while  the\r\n\r\nexecutives at SPH MediaWorks also reported obstacles in a\r\n\r\nfield once dominated by MediaCorp.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The competition situation has now more or less\r\n\r\nstabilised.  Since the economic downturn  however,  there\r\n\r\nhave  been  even  more changes in terms of consolidation.\r\n\r\nConsolidation  has  been  a  key  feature  of  the  media\r\n\r\nlandscape.   For  example,  SPH  has  suspended   Project\r\n\r\nEyeball  and  MediaCorp has shut down  its  City  TV  and\r\n\r\nconsolidated its sports and Chinese programmes with  some\r\n\r\nof  its  other  TV channels.  The media  landscape  is  a\r\n\r\nchallenging one right now for the media players.  Against\r\n\r\nthis backdrop, I would like to highlight two concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is not clear if the MDA's role is to\r\n\r\npromote  a  level  playing field for  competition  or  to\r\n\r\nmanage the competition in such a way as to make sure that\r\n\r\nMediaCorp  and SPH do not knock each other  out.   It  is\r\n\r\nquite  different.   Reading  the  comments  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nleaders in the past, it would seem to be the latter.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  DPM  Lee Hsien Loong has once  said  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment wanted to promote constructive competition and\r\n\r\nit  would be a managed process so that one does not knock\r\n\r\nout  the  other.  But does it mean that to be  fair,  you\r\n\r\nhave  to be unfair?  In the sense that, does it mean that\r\n\r\nif  Today proves to be so successful, the Government  has\r\n\r\nto  step  in  to  make sure that it does not  become  the\r\n\r\ndominant  print media?  Does it mean that if SPH  becomes\r\n\r\nso  successful with its two TV channels, that there  will\r\n\r\nbe  some  constraints to make sure that it will not  take\r\n\r\nover and become the dominant broadcasting media?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also expressed another concern\r\n\r\nthat with competition, the media may go for scandals  and\r\n\r\nsensations,  instead of serious news and compete  on  the\r\n\r\nway down, which is happening in many other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister: will managing the\r\n\r\ncompetition also mean\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontrolling  the kind of news that the media can  report?\r\n\r\nAnd, if so, how will this be decided, given that the  MDA\r\n\r\nhas  made  clear  that one of its roles  is  to  issue  a\r\n\r\nCompetition Code to regulate competition?  Will there  be\r\n\r\na transparent public interest test?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, if the code is to manage the competition, as\r\n\r\nI  suspect it is, it is important that the media industry\r\n\r\nbe consulted widely in drawing up the code and that there\r\n\r\nwill  be transparency in both how it is drawn up as  well\r\n\r\nas how it will be enforced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I want to ask the Minister how this\r\n\r\nCompetition Code sits with the coming generic Competition\r\n\r\nAct  which is said to be ready in 2-3 years' time  which,\r\n\r\nincidentally, strikes me as being rather slow.  One would\r\n\r\nhave  thought  that it would be the other way  round,  to\r\n\r\nintroduce   an   over-arching   framework,   an   omnibus\r\n\r\nCompetition Act, which will underpin competition  in  all\r\n\r\nindustries and enable more focused and detailed industry-specific measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that this is the approach that Australia\r\n\r\nis   taking.   It  also  has  a  super  media   regulator\r\n\r\nresponsible for the converging media and telecoms market,\r\n\r\nbut  it does not have a separate set of media competition\r\n\r\nrules.   Australia has a generic competition law enforced\r\n\r\nby  the  Australian Competition and Consumer  Commission,\r\n\r\nwhich  applies to all industries.  In the United Kingdom,\r\n\r\nthey  are  also  moving  towards a  single  regulator  of\r\n\r\nconverging   multi-media  industries,   the   Office   of\r\n\r\nCommunications.   It  will  have strong  anti-competitive\r\n\r\npowers as in the Competition law that they have.  In  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom, they already have an omnibus Competition\r\n\r\nlaw to provide an over-arching framework.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the Government seems to be favouring a\r\n\r\nsectoral-based  competition code and  has  come  up  much\r\n\r\nfaster  with  this than with the bigger  Competition  Act\r\n\r\nwhich we are all waiting for.  For instance, the IDA  has\r\n\r\nalready come up with the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCompetition  Code  for the telecoms  and  this  has  been\r\n\r\neffective since 2000.  This poses the question of whether\r\n\r\nwe  have  a coherent framework.  Should a media  company,\r\n\r\nfor  instance, file a complaint to the MDA or  should  it\r\n\r\nfile  with the Competition Commission, once it is formed,\r\n\r\nto enforce the Competition Act?  Who is to decide whether\r\n\r\na   dispute  is  more  appropriately  tackled  under  the\r\n\r\nCompetition  Act,  which is coming, or  under  the  MDA's\r\n\r\nCompetition Code?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not arguing that we do not need sectoral\r\n\r\nregulation now.  At this stage in our development, we are\r\n\r\nworking to achieve a transition from a monopoly situation\r\n\r\nto  a  competitive marketplace.  This and the  particular\r\n\r\nfeatures   of  the  media  and  the  telecoms  are   what\r\n\r\ndistinguish  sectoral  regulators  from  the  Competition\r\n\r\nCommission.  In the absence of a Competition  Act,  there\r\n\r\nis  a need for a competition code for specific industries\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  media.  Sectoral rules  provide  a  quick,\r\n\r\neffective   way  of  solving  disputes  and  to   promote\r\n\r\ncompetition  and  to  protect  consumers.   However,   as\r\n\r\ncompetition  develops and regulatory  intervention  fades\r\n\r\ninto  the background, we should do away with the Code  to\r\n\r\nallow  greater  use  of  the  Competition  Act.   It   is\r\n\r\nimportant  that we operate both the sectoral  Competition\r\n\r\nCodes,  the competition code for the media and the coming\r\n\r\ngeneric  and  omnibus Competition Act within  a  coherent\r\n\r\nframework.  The MDA's aim should be to be able to lighten\r\n\r\nsectoral   regulation  as  competition  increases,   thus\r\n\r\nincreasingly  rely  more and more on the  coming  generic\r\n\r\ncompetition law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that the Competition Code should include\r\n\r\nprovisions for regular reviews as well as prohibition  on\r\n\r\nusing  sectoral  powers  if there  is  already  effective\r\n\r\ncompetition.   The Government should allow regulation  of\r\n\r\nthe media to move towards self-regulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, there is a need for sectoral regulation\r\n\r\nbut  my hope is that the more successful we are in  using\r\n\r\nit,  the more competition will grow and so the less  need\r\n\r\nto rely on it.  The challenge for the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMDA  is  to  develop an overall approach and  a  coherent\r\n\r\nframework  in enabling greater competition in  a  rapidly\r\n\r\nchanging environment while preserving social and cultural\r\n\r\nbenefits associated with the existing policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, thank\r\n\r\nyou very much for allowing me to speak on this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam here is a very good friend of mine. But I\r\n\r\nam amazed actually at the way he describes our media.   I\r\n\r\nknow  we  are  all getting on in age, Mr Chiam  included.\r\n\r\nMaybe  we  will soon be like grandfathers.  But I  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand  how  he describes our media  or  Government's\r\n\r\nhandling  of  the media is like a \"nanny\".   Having  been\r\n\r\nwith  the  media business for more than 20 years  as  the\r\n\r\neditor of the Straits Times Group, I find that, in  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  media  has  been  maturing, and maturing  very  well\r\n\r\nindeed.   I remember the early days when I was editor,  I\r\n\r\ndid  feel  that  the media here was rather parochial  and\r\n\r\nsensational  and I did not want to have any  part  of  it\r\n\r\nearlier on.  But after having spent sometime, 3-5  years,\r\n\r\nI  then  realise how important the role of the media  was\r\n\r\nand felt that in fact, it was important that we could  be\r\n\r\npart  of  that development of the media.  If you look  at\r\n\r\nthe media today, you will find that they are undergoing a\r\n\r\nmaturing process, with the kind of different opinions and\r\n\r\ndebates that are going on.  I think it is helping  us  to\r\n\r\nmove towards a maturing Singapore society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see this move, Mdm Deputy Speaker, as an effort on\r\n\r\nthe  part of the Government to allow an authority and  at\r\n\r\narms-length to do the kind of work which the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nInformation, Communications and the Arts has been  doing.\r\n\r\nTo  me, that is progress.  When Mr Chiam and Mr Seng  Han\r\n\r\nThong talked about a \"light touch\", I wonder what do they\r\n\r\nmean  by  \"light  touch\" as against a  \"heavy  touch\",  I\r\n\r\nsuppose.  But I think here, perhaps what is needed  is  a\r\n\r\njudicious  touch because \"light touch\" can  also  be  too\r\n\r\nlight and then we can also create problems for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nourselves.   But  neither do I call for a  \"heavy  touch\"\r\n\r\nlike  in  the early years.  Nevertheless, like my friend,\r\n\r\nMr  Seng Han Thong, we all realise how difficult  is  the\r\n\r\njob  done  by  the media people, day in day out,  chasing\r\n\r\ndeadlines  and having to make decisions every  moment  of\r\n\r\nthe  day of their working day.  Our hearts are with  them\r\n\r\nand we hope they will continue to do the good work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point I would like to make, Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   is  the  test  of  this  Bill  or  the   Media\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Authority on the question of the  choice  of\r\n\r\nmembers which the Government or MITA will appoint to this\r\n\r\nAuthority.   I think the whole credibility of this  Media\r\n\r\nDevelopment Authority will depend on the kind  of  people\r\n\r\nthat we elect to the Authority.  I would like to ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to elaborate on what is the criterion  for  the\r\n\r\nselection  of members of this Authority.  I do hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  or  the  relevant  authorities  that  will\r\n\r\nappoint  the members will choose people who are critical-minded,   open-minded  Singaporeans,  that   will   allow\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  move further ahead towards a mature  media\r\n\r\nand a mature society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, first of all, may\r\n\r\nI  thank  all  the  speakers who have spoken,  especially\r\n\r\nthose who have spoken in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, first of all, reiterate what I said in my\r\n\r\nspeech,  that is, the main function of this  Bill  is  to\r\n\r\nbring  together different agencies and Government  bodies\r\n\r\nthat  currently administer different parts of  the  media\r\n\r\nindustry  into one statutory body.  The purpose of  doing\r\n\r\nthis  is  really  to  give focus to the  media  industry.\r\n\r\nNothing  else has really changed.  I think to look  ahead\r\n\r\nand  perhaps to speculate that this means that  it  is  a\r\n\r\ntightening  of  censorship, for  example,  is  just  pure\r\n\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, on this issue of censorship and control,\r\n\r\nthis  is an issue that cannot be avoided.  No country  is\r\n\r\ndevoid  of controls or censorship rules over their media.\r\n\r\nIf you take a country, perhaps a country as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nliberal as the United States, you will find that they too\r\n\r\nhave controls over the media.  No foreign entity can  buy\r\n\r\nmore  than  20%  of  a broadcast company  in  the  United\r\n\r\nStates.   And in the United Kingdom, where the regime  is\r\n\r\nmore liberal, even the transfer of ownership in the large\r\n\r\nnewspaper  companies  will require the  approval  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister.   Every country will have to approach  this  in\r\n\r\nits  own way, sensitive to its own context and to address\r\n\r\nits own concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, indeed when my staff attended a\r\n\r\nconference  recently in Europe which had to do  with  one\r\n\r\naspect of the media, ie, about film classification,  they\r\n\r\ncame back and told me that the Europeans were not able to\r\n\r\nagree  on  a  single  film  classification  standard  for\r\n\r\nEurope.   That  is  because  each  country  had  its  own\r\n\r\nconcerns   about  what  was  important,   in   terms   of\r\n\r\nclassification,  standards and cultural norms  that  were\r\n\r\nappropriate  for that particular country.  So  censorship\r\n\r\nis  an issue that all countries have got to grapple with.\r\n\r\nAnd for Singapore, we have got to find our own standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate Mr Zainul Abidin's intervention on this\r\n\r\npoint that Mr Chiam raised that we should not keep saying\r\n\r\nthat this is a \"nanny\" state and the Government tells the\r\n\r\nmedia  what to do.  Mdm Deputy Speaker, I did not ask  Mr\r\n\r\nChiam  what  he was going to say this afternoon  when  he\r\n\r\nindicated he wanted to speak on the Bill.  Neither  do  I\r\n\r\nwant  to  know.   I  was quite happy  for  him  to  raise\r\n\r\nwhatever points he would raise.  Likewise, I do  not  ask\r\n\r\nthe  editors of our newspapers on what they are going  to\r\n\r\nwrite in the headlines tomorrow.  Neither do they ask  my\r\n\r\npermission.  Neither do I want them to do so.   I  really\r\n\r\ndo  not follow why we continue to prosecute such an image\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, if I may address, in turn, the\r\n\r\ndifferent  concerns  that have been raised  by  different\r\n\r\nspeakers.   Mr Seng Han Thong raised a number  of  issues\r\n\r\nabout  the  standards of performance and asked what  this\r\n\r\nmeant.  He\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreferred  to clause 17 on codes of practice.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nclause  under  the competition section of the  Bill.   It\r\n\r\ndeals  with  standards  of  performance  with  regard  to\r\n\r\ncompetition.   For  example,  if  this  was  a  broadcast\r\n\r\ncompany,  you  would expect that you need  to  have  some\r\n\r\nstandards  of  performance.  You might need to  regulate,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  air  time, the number of broadcast  hours.\r\n\r\nYou might need to ensure that there is no interference of\r\n\r\nsignals  between one broadcaster and another broadcaster.\r\n\r\nThere  are  certain technical standards that need  to  be\r\n\r\nachieved.   You need to ensure that service  is  provided\r\n\r\nand  the system does not break down every other day.   So\r\n\r\nthere  are these technical standards.    As I said, there\r\n\r\nare  also  other social standards.  But as  Mr  Seng  has\r\n\r\npointed out, our approach to the different media has been\r\n\r\ndifferent in the past and will continue to be  so  as  we\r\n\r\nmove  forward.  For the print media, for example, I think\r\n\r\nour editors have done a very good job.  They have managed\r\n\r\nto  build up the reputation of our newspapers.  They  are\r\n\r\nseen  to be credible.  They are seen to be serious.  They\r\n\r\nare seen to be a voice that deserves to be heard.  And  I\r\n\r\nthink  they understand their role in nation building  and\r\n\r\nhave  taken  this  role seriously.  I  think  that  is  a\r\n\r\nrelationship that has worked well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the broadcast area, we have programming codes,\r\n\r\nand that, again, is because we have some peculiarities in\r\n\r\nbroadcast,  eg,  dialect policy.  From time  to  time,  a\r\n\r\nbroadcaster may break that rule and needs to be  reminded\r\n\r\nabout  that  particular policy, and that policy  reflects\r\n\r\nthe  nature of our society and our other policies  -  our\r\n\r\nlanguage policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address Mr Seng's concern, let me say that these\r\n\r\nstandards  of performance are, firstly, technical.   And,\r\n\r\nsecondly,  the  other  standards  that  may  need  to  be\r\n\r\nintroduced, I would leave it to the MDA to consider  what\r\n\r\nother standards they need to introduce in order to ensure\r\n\r\nthat competition is on an even playing field.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng made the point that the Bill seems to\r\n\r\nsuggest that the MDA will become more of a regulator than\r\n\r\na\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndeveloper.  Just because there are more clauses  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  competition does not mean that the  Board  likewise\r\n\r\nwill be so.  I do not think we should judge a book by its\r\n\r\ncover.   There  are  many  clauses  here  to  deal   with\r\n\r\ncompetition.   Because, as I said, this is  an  immediate\r\n\r\nneed,  and this is not something that is covered  in  the\r\n\r\nother Acts that the MDA will also administer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure Mr Seng and the other Members who have\r\n\r\nspoken  that  the MDA indeed is formed to  focus  on  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of the media industry, and they are  working\r\n\r\nvery hard now to draw up plans on how to do this.  One of\r\n\r\nthe  issues raised by Mr Zainudin, for example,  was  the\r\n\r\nfilm  sector of the media industry, and I thank  him  for\r\n\r\nhis  support for the film sector.  This is indeed an area\r\n\r\nthat we would like to see develop.  As the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nsaid  in  his National Day Rally  -  I think he meant  it\r\n\r\nfor  Jack Neo  -  \"Two No Enough\", and he encouraged Jack\r\n\r\nto produce more movies that we can all enjoy and that can\r\n\r\ntravel.  And, indeed, Jack Neo's last hit  \"I Not Stupid\"\r\n\r\nhas done very well, not just in Singapore but it has also\r\n\r\ntravelled,  to some extent, in the region,  and  I  think\r\n\r\nthat augurs well.  In fact, I received an e-mail recently\r\n\r\nof  a Singapore club in the US which is gathering all the\r\n\r\nSingapore students and anybody else who is interested  to\r\n\r\nwatch  \"I Not Stupid\".  So, that is yet another way  that\r\n\r\nit  serves the function to hold together Singaporeans who\r\n\r\nare  spread far and wide, away from Singapore.   Yes,  we\r\n\r\nwill do what we can to develop the film industry.  But we\r\n\r\nhave got to recognise that it is not an easy industry  to\r\n\r\ndevelop.  We are a small marketplace and films that  have\r\n\r\nlocal  cache  that can resonate with Singaporeans  easily\r\n\r\nmay not travel very far.  So, the challenge for directors\r\n\r\nand  movie  makers is really to find a formula that  will\r\n\r\nappeal  both to Singaporeans but will also travel  beyond\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Because  whether you  show  the  film  to  3\r\n\r\nmillion  people, 30 million people or 300 million people,\r\n\r\nit is still the same set of costs of making the film.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can address some of the specific issues that Mr\r\n\r\nChiam  raised  on the Public Entertainments and  Meetings\r\n\r\nAct (PEMA),\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  should just let Mr Chiam know that the Act will not be\r\n\r\nadministered in toto by MITA.  MITA will only  administer\r\n\r\nthe  art entertainment aspects of PEMA.  So, if Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\ndecides to sing and dance, we can consider giving  him  a\r\n\r\nlicence.   But if he is going to make a speech,  he  will\r\n\r\nstill need to go back to the Minister in charge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 5, Mr Chiam made a reference to the\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Board and suggested certain criteria  for\r\n\r\npicking  these  members of the Board, as  did  Mr  Zainul\r\n\r\nAbidin.    I   would   take   their   suggestions    into\r\n\r\nconsideration.    Certainly, we want to pick  people  who\r\n\r\nare  able to contribute towards the goals of the MDA and,\r\n\r\ncertainly, their suggestions that they should  be  people\r\n\r\nwho are critical, who are open minded, who can understand\r\n\r\nand  see  the vision of making Singapore into  a  vibrant\r\n\r\nglobal  city  for  media  and  for  the  arts  these  are\r\n\r\ncertainly  the kinds of criteria we would  apply  and  we\r\n\r\nwant to try to get a broadbase of people, so that we will\r\n\r\nget different ideas to drive the Board forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have addressed Mr Chiam's suggestion that\r\n\r\nwe  should do away entirely with censorship.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink it is practical and I do not think you can point to\r\n\r\nany country in the world that has succeeded in doing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin also touched on the matter of satellite\r\n\r\ncommunications,  and  suggested  that   even   Iran   was\r\n\r\nconsidering  doing  this.   I  think  there  is   a   big\r\n\r\ndifference   between   Iran  and  Singapore,   and   that\r\n\r\ndifference  is size.  Satellite technology  is  something\r\n\r\nthat  is important and useful to large countries, because\r\n\r\nit  means  that you do not have to really lay  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ncables.  Laying cables in large countries is probably not\r\n\r\ncost  effective.  For Singapore, we have  cabled  up  the\r\n\r\nwhole  country  and,  for all practical  purposes,  every\r\n\r\nresidence in Singapore is able to receive cable  signals.\r\n\r\nSo,  there  is really not the same reason for us  to  use\r\n\r\nthis technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng asked a rather philosophical question - the difference between promoting and managing\r\n\r\ncompetition.  I think if you created a specific\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nscenario whether we would hold back a company if  it  was\r\n\r\ntoo  successful, if  Today became the dominant  newspaper\r\n\r\ncompany, would we be concerned?  If MediaWorks became the\r\n\r\ndominant  broadcasting company, would  we  be  concerned?\r\n\r\nThe  answer  is  no.  I think we leave  the  industry  to\r\n\r\ncompete.   What we want to be sure of is really that  the\r\n\r\nincumbent  operator does not put impediments unfairly  in\r\n\r\nthe   way  of  a  competitor  trying  to  get  into   the\r\n\r\nmarketplace and trying to compete, and that is  what  the\r\n\r\ncompetition code is for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Ng also talked about the omnibus Competition Act\r\n\r\nthat  is  being considered and why we have chosen  to  do\r\n\r\nsectoral  competition codes at this  point  in  time.   I\r\n\r\nthink  the  answer is that we cannot wait, once  we  have\r\n\r\nintroduced competition into the media industry.  Although\r\n\r\nover  the  last two years the more aggressive competitive\r\n\r\nbehaviour  has  quietened down  a  little  bit,  I  still\r\n\r\nreceive  complaints  every now  and  then  by  one  party\r\n\r\nagainst  another  party  on  anti-competitive  behaviour.\r\n\r\nReally,  the  only  way to deal with  this  properly  and\r\n\r\neffectively is to have a competition code and that is why\r\n\r\nwe are introducing one now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether it will be consistent with the omnibus\r\n\r\nAct  in  future,  certainly  we  will  have  to  make  it\r\n\r\ncompatible,  and  it will be reviewed at the  appropriate\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I think I have addressed the\r\n\r\nissues  that  have  been raised by  Members.   Again,  in\r\n\r\nconclusion, let me thank them for their support.  Let  me\r\n\r\nsay that the purpose of bringing these different agencies\r\n\r\ntogether  is  to create focus in the media industry.   We\r\n\r\nsee  this  as  a  potential area of  growth  as  we  move\r\n\r\nforward.   The  media, together with  applied  arts  like\r\n\r\ndesign, is an important industry, not just in itself  but\r\n\r\nbecause  of  its  spillover effects to the  rest  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy.  I think one of the key elements of our economic\r\n\r\nstrategy  to  move  forward is really  to  tap  into  the\r\n\r\ncreative and innovative capability of our people  and  of\r\n\r\nour resources here in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore, and the Media Development Authority is  tasked\r\n\r\nto do that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang:</b> Mdm, I would like to\r\n\r\nget  clarification  on the functions and  duties  of  the\r\n\r\nproposed MDA.  I can well understand that it is taking  a\r\n\r\nbalance between development and regulations.  It is true,\r\n\r\nand I agree with Ms Irene Ng, that it is creating a super\r\n\r\nstatutory  regulator.  But I do not  think  the  concerns\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  about censorship are as ominous  as  some\r\n\r\nMembers  have put it.  Because I am on one of the appeals\r\n\r\ncommittee  of  MITA and I can safely say that  we  hardly\r\n\r\nhave any appeals.  This is an indication that we have not\r\n\r\nput   too   heavy   a  touch  on  censorship   that   the\r\n\r\norganisations would like to come forward and make appeals\r\n\r\nfor  us  to consider.   I may be wrong here but something\r\n\r\nseems to be missing amongst the functions and duties, ie,\r\n\r\nas   a   very   important  regulator   or   developmental\r\n\r\norganisation  on knowledge, what kind of functions  would\r\n\r\nMDA  see  for  itself  to  actively  promote  Singapore's\r\n\r\nability  to  be  discerning about what we see,  hear  and\r\n\r\nread,  so  as  to  minimise the need for so-called  heavy\r\n\r\ntypes  of censorship here.  I would like to implore  MDA,\r\n\r\neven though it is  ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Deputy Speaker:</b> Dr Ngiam, can you just round up\r\n\r\nyour clarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang:</b> I am coming to my\r\n\r\nquestion now.  Would MDA see for itself that it also  has\r\n\r\na responsibility to make Singaporeans safe for ideas, ie,\r\n\r\nyou  give  them informed choices, rather than make  ideas\r\n\r\nsafe for Singaporeans, ie, through the censorship route?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Dr Ngiam raises a very fundamental\r\n\r\nquestion about the development of our society.   I  think\r\n\r\nhe  wants  a  society to be more reflective, to  be  more\r\n\r\nmature,  to  be  thinking, to understand that  there  are\r\n\r\ntrade-offs whatever the issue is.  He has developed these\r\n\r\nperspectives because he sits on some of our  boards,  and\r\n\r\nhe  is  put  in  a position where he has to  decide  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  issues.  On the one hand, somebody might  come\r\n\r\nand say, \"Why don't you allow this movie to be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nscreened, because as mature adults, surely we can make up\r\n\r\nour  own minds about the contents of this movie?\"  On the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  we have others coming to the appeals  board\r\n\r\nsaying,  \"No,  you should not allow this to be  screened.\r\n\r\nIt lowers our moral character.  This will do great damage\r\n\r\nto  our society.\"  And so, indeed, Singaporeans will have\r\n\r\nto  be  more discerning.  But I think this is beyond  the\r\n\r\nability  of one agency or one authority to do.   I  think\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  task  for all of us in this  House,  in  all\r\n\r\nMinistries, in the way we debate, in the way we  discuss,\r\n\r\nin  the way we formulate policies, to be more reflective,\r\n\r\nto  consider  the pros and cons and to come  to  our  own\r\n\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this afternoon, Members heard suggestions\r\n\r\nabout  the  Government  making  decisions  on  behalf  of\r\n\r\ncitizens.  Well, we want to try and shift some  of  these\r\n\r\ndecision-making risks that citizens have got to  consider\r\n\r\nand   to  evaluate  and  to  come  to  a  conclusion  for\r\n\r\nthemselves.   This is the process.  It is  not  something\r\n\r\nthat will happen overnight but, certainly, we can all  do\r\n\r\nour part.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Madam, I applaud what the\r\n\r\nMinister said earlier about not inhibiting the censorship\r\n\r\nbut making it a little bit more transparent.  As part  of\r\n\r\nthat process, while you bring in the right people to form\r\n\r\nthis body, may I also suggest that sometimes that kind of\r\n\r\noverriding  principles must come down to the officers  on\r\n\r\nthe ground, including MITA officers as well as editors of\r\n\r\npapers,  etc.  Because, sometimes the OB markers are  not\r\n\r\nvery   clear   and  everyone  tends  to   over-read   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.    Perhaps   this   can   be    taken    into\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, again, my answer\r\n\r\nis  very  similar  to what I gave to Dr  Ngiam.   We  are\r\n\r\nconducting  a  censorship review.  This  is  not  germane\r\n\r\nreally to the Bill that is before the House, but if I may\r\n\r\njust  briefly address that.  We decided that we  will  go\r\n\r\nahead  with this Censorship Review Committee, and I think\r\n\r\nI  want  to  give them time to consider inputs  from  the\r\n\r\npublic.  We have received\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmany  useful suggestions.  Arts groups have put  together\r\n\r\ntheir  thoughts  and written them down.   They  have  put\r\n\r\nserious  proposals to the Committee.  The Committee  will\r\n\r\nconsider all of these.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are moving forward in this area. But, as I have\r\n\r\nsaid in this House before, it is not whether we are going\r\n\r\nto become more liberal or more strict.  I think the issue\r\n\r\nreally is whether we can keep pace with developments.  We\r\n\r\ncannot  choose the world we live in.  And if we  want  to\r\n\r\ngrow and to progress, we have got to be connected to  the\r\n\r\nrest  of the world.  But that also does not mean we  have\r\n\r\ngot  to  be  like everybody else.  No two  countries  are\r\n\r\nalike.  No two societies are alike.  Therefore, we should\r\n\r\nfind our own formula.  We should have our own voice.   We\r\n\r\nshould  have our own distinctive identity.  And we should\r\n\r\nnot  be too eager to copy the standards that other people\r\n\r\nhave  set for themselves, because no society is  free  of\r\n\r\nthe consequences of these choices.\r\n\r\nWhatever choices we make, there will be positive outcomes\r\n\r\nand there will be problems that we will have to manage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it is a process and, I think, on censorship, let\r\n\r\nus wait to see what the Review Committee has to say.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr David T.

(This figure is seasonally\r\n\r\nadjusted). Although the labour market had shown signs  of\r\n\r\nrecovery, job creation is still not sufficient to  absorb\r\n\r\nthis   year's   new  entrants  to  the   labour   market.\r\n\r\nConsequently,    the    seasonally    adjusted    overall\r\n\r\nunemployment  rate  rose to a 15-year  high  of  4.8%  in\r\n\r\nSeptember  2002 from 4.1% in June and 4.5% in March  this\r\n\r\nyear.   Among the resident labour force, the unemployment\r\n\r\nrate was 4.9% in September 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unemployment is expected to remain high until the\r\n\r\nend  of this year.  It is expected to be between 5.0% and\r\n\r\n5.5%.    If   economic   recovery  is   sustained,   then\r\n\r\nunemployment would fall in 2003.  But it is too  soon  to\r\n\r\npredict next year's unemployment rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent developments in the external environment\r\n\r\nwould affect Singapore's economic recovery and employment\r\n\r\ngrowth.  Nevertheless, there are still job  vacancies.  I\r\n\r\nwould  therefore urge unemployed Singaporeans to  have  a\r\n\r\npositive  attitude, to be flexible and  more  willing  to\r\n\r\ntake up these jobs. It will not be easy to change, or  to\r\n\r\ngo  into  new  areas, but those who keep on trying,  will\r\n\r\neventually succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HOSPITALISATION FEE ASSISTANCE SCHEME</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Health,\r\n\r\nsince  the introduction from 1st1/2November 2001  of  the\r\n\r\none-year hospitalisation fee assistance scheme as part of\r\n\r\nthe  second  off-Budget package to help lower income  and\r\n\r\nretrenched  Singaporeans (a) how many retrenched  workers\r\n\r\nand their families have benefited from the scheme so far;\r\n\r\n(b)  how much has it cost the Government; and (c) in view\r\n\r\nof  the  continued economic downturn, does  his  Ministry\r\n\r\nplan to extend the scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two types of rebates that the Government\r\n\r\nhas been giving to Singaporeans under the Hospitalisation\r\n\r\nFee Assistance Scheme (HFAS) since 1st November 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Singaporeans who are class B2/C inpatients or\r\n\r\nsubsidised  day  surgery patients in  the  public  sector\r\n\r\nhospitals and institutions would automatically receive  a\r\n\r\n10% fee rebate on their hospitalisation bills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, retrenched Singaporeans and their non-working spouse and dependent children would be eligible\r\n\r\nfor  an  additional 40% fee assistance.

While there are no known imminent threats\r\n\r\nposed  by  the  Jemaah Islamiyah, the general  threat  of\r\n\r\nterrorism  has not abated. However, we should  not  allow\r\n\r\nthis  to  affect  our  lives.  We should  not  sink  into\r\n\r\ndespondency, nor panic and cower in fear.   We  must  not\r\n\r\nallow  ourselves  to  be intimidated  by  terrorism.   We\r\n\r\nshould  respond to these threats in a calm  and  rational\r\n\r\nmanner.

The Ministry will not be able  to\r\n\r\nextend  this  arrangement for private  sector  hospitals.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no mechanism to determine who is eligible  for\r\n\r\ntreatment  at  private hospitals, and  we  would  end  up\r\n\r\nsubsidising  those who can and should pay for  their  own\r\n\r\nhealthcare  expenses. There is also no compelling  reason\r\n\r\nfor the Ministry to run a dual system where we now select\r\n\r\nsubsidised  patients  for certain treatments  in  private\r\n\r\nhospitals, as suggested by the Parkway group.  The public\r\n\r\nhospitals  are providing acceptable standard of  care  to\r\n\r\nsubsidised  patients.

For  example,\r\n\r\nURA  which has expertise in urban redevelopment has  been\r\n\r\nappointed   to   sell  land  linked   to   planning   and\r\n\r\nredevelopment  objectives since  the  1960s.

Under the Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient\r\n\r\n(MSO)  Scheme,  introduced in 1994, we have  aligned  the\r\n\r\ntreatment  in  medical benefits between male  and  female\r\n\r\nofficers.   They receive the same additional  1%  monthly\r\n\r\ncontribution to their Medisave account which they can use\r\n\r\nfor other family members, including dependants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only slight difference is in outpatient\r\n\r\nbenefits.   Women  officers are  not  eligible  to  claim\r\n\r\noutpatient  subsidy  for  their  husbands  or   dependent\r\n\r\nchildren.    However,  this  difference  was  effectively\r\n\r\nremoved  in 2001 when the Government decided to  transfer\r\n\r\nany  unused  balance in the annual cap  of  $350  to  the\r\n\r\nofficer's Medisave account at the end of each year.   The\r\n\r\nofficer can then use this amount in Medisave according to\r\n\r\nMedisave guidelines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic philosophy of the civil service is that\r\n\r\nits medical benefit schemes should reflect the values and\r\n\r\npractices  of  our  Asian society,  where  typically  the\r\n\r\nhusband is responsible for taking care of the family.  We\r\n\r\nshould be careful to avoid inadvertently sending a signal\r\n\r\nthat  husbands  no  longer have this  responsibility,  by\r\n\r\nchanging  long-established practices  before  the  social\r\n\r\nreality  has  adjusted.  However, as I mentioned  at  the\r\n\r\nlast  Committee of Supply, this is not set  in  concrete,\r\n\r\nand  the  civil service will continue to review  the  MSO\r\n\r\nscheme periodically as our society evolves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION CONVENTION 100</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. <b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</b> asked the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Manpower in view of Singapore's ratification of  the\r\n\r\nInternational Labour Organisation Convention 100 on Equal\r\n\r\nPay  for  Equal Work, whether the Singapore Civil Service\r\n\r\nis in compliance with this convention.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore ratified ILO Convention 100 in June this\r\n\r\nyear.   This  Convention seeks to promote and ensure  the\r\n\r\napplication  of  the principle of equal remuneration  for\r\n\r\nmen and women for work of equal value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wages in Singapore are based on meritocracy and\r\n\r\ndetermined by market forces of demand and supply.  In the\r\n\r\ncase of the Civil Service, the principle of equal pay has\r\n\r\nbeen adopted since 1962.  Male and female officers of the\r\n\r\nsame rank are placed on the same salary scale.  We are in\r\n\r\ncompliance with the convention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the public sector is aware of the\r\n\r\ndifference  in  medical  benefits  for  male  and  female\r\n\r\nofficers engaged prior to 1994.  For this group of  civil\r\n\r\nservants,  medical  benefits were extended  only  to  the\r\n\r\ndependants of male officers, but not to the dependants of\r\n\r\nfemale  officers.   This  policy was  formulated  on  the\r\n\r\nprinciple that in an Asian society like Singapore, it  is\r\n\r\nthe  husband's responsibility to look after the  family's\r\n\r\nneed.    However,  if  a  female  employee  becomes   the\r\n\r\nbreadwinner,  as in a widow or divorcee,  her  dependants\r\n\r\nwould be eligible for medical benefits.  In 1994, serving\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  were given the option of  accepting  the\r\n\r\nsubsidised outpatient cum Medisave Scheme whereby male or\r\n\r\nfemale\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncivil  servants received the same outpatient subsidy  and\r\n\r\nadditional 1% Medisave contribution.

First,\r\n\r\nelectricity price in Singapore is unlikely to be  cheaper\r\n\r\nin  absolute  terms  than  in the neighbouring  countries\r\n\r\nbecause  of certain structural characteristics  that  are\r\n\r\nunique  to a city state like ours. It is no different  as\r\n\r\nto  why  property prices here are more expensive than  in\r\n\r\nKuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Jakarta. Second, the issue then\r\n\r\nis   whether   within   these   structural   constraints,\r\n\r\nelectricity prices are as competitive as they could be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the structural factors? Our electricity\r\n\r\nprice  comprises  two components.  One  is  the  cost  of\r\n\r\ngenerating electricity, and the other is the cost of  the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure to deliver the electricity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our generation cost is high because we depend on oil\r\n\r\nand   gas  for  our  energy  source,  unlike  many  other\r\n\r\ncountries which have recourse to cheaper electricity such\r\n\r\nas hydro-electricity. Both oil and gas are expensive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our infrastructure cost is also high. Because of\r\n\r\nour small size, we bury our entire electricity network so\r\n\r\nthat land can be freed up for other use. Depending on the\r\n\r\nvoltage  level, buried transmission cables cost three  to\r\n\r\n25   times   more   than  overhead  cables.   To   ensure\r\n\r\nreliability,  back-up capacity has to be installed  since\r\n\r\nfaults  take longer to locate and fix with buried cables.\r\n\r\nThis  makes  a  buried  system much more  expensive  than\r\n\r\ncomparable overhead systems used in most other  countries\r\n\r\nand   cities.  This  cost  translates  into  higher  grid\r\n\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These then are the constraints. What are we doing\r\n\r\nwithin    these   constraints   to   ensure   competitive\r\n\r\nelectricity prices? On the matter of grid charges, EMA is\r\n\r\nreviewing  the  current grid charging framework  to  find\r\n\r\nways  to  benchmark our grid charges to those imposed  in\r\n\r\ncomparable countries and cities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also started to further liberalise our\r\n\r\nelectricity market to make it more competitive. This will\r\n\r\nhelp  put  downward pressure on prices. Competition  will\r\n\r\nforce  market  players  to  be more  cost  conscious  and\r\n\r\nsqueeze   out  inefficiencies.  It  will  also  encourage\r\n\r\nplayers to seek new and cheaper technology to gain market\r\n\r\nshare. With the pending liberalisation, we have seen  the\r\n\r\nentry of seven new licensees in electricity retailing and\r\n\r\nthree new generation licensees.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see the impact of competition on electricity\r\n\r\nprices  from  the  first phase of retail  contestability.\r\n\r\nAbout  220  customers,  comprising the  large  industrial\r\n\r\ncompanies   are  already  contestable.   They   can   buy\r\n\r\nelectricity  from these retailers.  About  179  (or  80%)\r\n\r\nhave switched to buying electricity from these retailers.\r\n\r\nOf  those  who  have switched, about  86%  were  able  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate  lower  prices for their  electricity.   Retail\r\n\r\ncontestability   in  the  electricity  market   will   be\r\n\r\ngradually  opened  to other consumers.   5,000  consumers\r\n\r\nwill become contestable three months after the new market\r\n\r\nstarts.   Another 5,000 will become contestable 6  months\r\n\r\nthereafter.  This will open about 70-75% of total  demand\r\n\r\nto  retail  competition. The EMA  is  currently  studying\r\n\r\nextending  retail  contestability to  domestic  consumers\r\n\r\nstarting end 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition has also driven the existing generation\r\n\r\ncompanies to seek better efficiencies to gain competitive\r\n\r\nedge over their rivals. Some had replaced their oil fired\r\n\r\nplants  with  gas fired plants. Such plants enjoy  better\r\n\r\nefficiencies and therefore lower costs. This has  enabled\r\n\r\nthe Energy Market Authority to lower the price cap on 1st\r\n\r\nJanuary  2002,  which resulted in a 6% reduction  in  the\r\n\r\naverage electricity price.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Singapore's electricity costs are not low.\r\n\r\nMany  factors  resulting in this are beyond our  control.\r\n\r\nHowever  we can expect competition to drive the  industry\r\n\r\nto  achieve  better  efficiencies which  will  ultimately\r\n\r\nbenefit consumers. The challenge for us is to continue to\r\n\r\nprovide   consumers  with  good  quality   and   reliable\r\n\r\nelectricity supply, and the higher costs this necessarily\r\n\r\nentails; while keeping electricity prices affordable  and\r\n\r\ncompetitive.   In   this  regard,   we   appreciate   the\r\n\r\nsuggestions of the ERC sub-committee on manufacturing and\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry is carefully studying them to see what  more\r\n\r\ncan  be done. This is so as we are in full agreement with\r\n\r\nthe   sub-committee   that  keeping  electricity   prices\r\n\r\ncompetitive  is an important element for the industry  to\r\n\r\nprosper and thrive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RESPITE FOR ELECTRICITY AND WATER CONSUMERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Trade\r\n\r\nand  Industry,  at  this  time of economic  difficulties,\r\n\r\nwhether  he  will advise Power Supply Ltd and the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board not to cut electricity and water supplies\r\n\r\nto  consumers who are in arrears of utility bills but  to\r\n\r\ngive them more time to pay up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern raised by the Member for Potong Pasir is\r\n\r\nshared  by all of us in this House. My Ministry has  been\r\n\r\nin  discussion with Power Supply. Power Supply deals with\r\n\r\ncustomers  in arrears by giving them what is  effectively\r\n\r\nan  extension  of  time to pay rather than  pre-emptorily\r\n\r\ncutting  off their utility supplies.  It issues reminders\r\n\r\nand also visits these households to work out the best way\r\n\r\nto resolve the outstanding bills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a consumer informs Power Supply that he has\r\n\r\ndifficulty paying his bills, Power Supply will advise him\r\n\r\nto  make alternative payment arrangements, usually in the\r\n\r\nform  of  instalments. For such consumers, they must  pay\r\n\r\noff at least their current bill. The backpayments may  be\r\n\r\nrepaid  via  an  instalment plan. This arrangement  helps\r\n\r\ncontrol  the size of the arrears from spiralling  out  of\r\n\r\ncontrol.  Currently, about 73,000 households  are  paying\r\n\r\ntheir arrears in instalments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a commercial company, Power Supply should recover\r\n\r\narrears from its defaulting customers. However, they  are\r\n\r\naware  that  they  should  do this  in  a  sensitive  way\r\n\r\nespecially from households who have genuine difficulties.\r\n\r\nFor  these  households, if the need arises, Power  Supply\r\n\r\nwill refer them to the Community Development Councils  to\r\n\r\naccess the Government's financial assistance schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDCs administer a Rent and Utilities Assistance\r\n\r\nScheme (RUAS) that offers assistance to households in HDB\r\n\r\nrental flats who are in need and have difficulties paying\r\n\r\ntheir rent and maintenance charges.  They also administer\r\n\r\nan   Interim  (Short-term)  Financial  Assistance  Scheme\r\n\r\n(IFAS)  to  help families in 2 to 4-room HDB  flats  with\r\n\r\ntemporary   grants  to  meet  their  subsistence   needs,\r\n\r\nincluding maintenance charges.  In the first half of this\r\n\r\nyear,  a  total of about $340,000 has been  disbursed  to\r\n\r\nmore than 600 applicants of the RUAS scheme. In addition,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  also extended  the  Utilities  Save\r\n\r\nscheme  for  another year, as part of the 2nd  off-budget\r\n\r\nmeasures to help households to offset their utility bills\r\n\r\nthrough  a  monthly  grant for  10  months.   The  scheme\r\n\r\nstarted in July this year, and will last till April 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For households that are facing financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties,  they should contact Power Supply  to  work\r\n\r\nout  a viable repayment plan, so that their bills do  not\r\n\r\nget out of control. For genuine hardship cases, there are\r\n\r\nGovernment financial assistance schemes in place to  tide\r\n\r\nfamilies over temporary difficulties. However, households\r\n\r\nmust also do their part to cut consumption and to lighten\r\n\r\ntheir  own  bills.  Power Supply's statistics  show  that\r\n\r\nabout  92%  of  households with accounts in arrears  have\r\n\r\nelectricity and water consumption bills that exceeded the\r\n\r\nnational average for their housing types. Such households\r\n\r\nwill  find  their bills more manageable  if  they  reduce\r\n\r\nusage.  As  part of its education efforts,  Power  Supply\r\n\r\nadvises  these  households how to better  conserve  their\r\n\r\nelectricity and water usage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disconnection of utilities supply is a last resort\r\n\r\naction  taken  by Power Supply.  This can be  avoided  if\r\n\r\nhouseholds  contact Power Supply and jointly work  out  a\r\n\r\nviable repayment arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CHANGES TO THE JUNIOR COLLEGE SYSTEM</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation  whether  the proposed changes  to  the  junior\r\n\r\ncollege system can be implemented before 2006.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I (Minister for Education) will be moving a motion\r\n\r\nto  debate  the White Paper on the Report of  the  Junior\r\n\r\nCollege/Upper Secondary Education Review in Parliament in\r\n\r\nNovember  2002.

This\r\n\r\nrepresents a six-fold increase compared to 30 years  ago.\r\n\r\nThis trend is not sustainable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to minimise waste and recycle more. Last\r\n\r\nyear, our recycling rate was 44%.  We aim to increase  it\r\n\r\nto  60%  by  2012.   To  achieve  this  target,  one  key\r\n\r\ninitiative is the setting up of the Eco-Recycling Park in\r\n\r\nTuas through the joint effort of ENV, NEA, EDB and JTC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides helping to increase recycling in Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe  growth of the recycling industry can also serve  the\r\n\r\ngrowing  markets in Singapore as well as in  the  region.\r\n\r\nThe  Park  seeks to attract high-value added  activities,\r\n\r\nand  transform  the image of the recycling industry  into\r\n\r\none  that deploys advanced technology and provides a more\r\n\r\nconducive working environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We adopt a cluster approach in the development of\r\n\r\nthe  Park  so that companies can enjoy greater  synergies\r\n\r\nand  operational efficiency.  JTC offers them  a  30-year\r\n\r\nlease  at reasonable rental. ENV encourages them to  make\r\n\r\nuse  of the \"Innovation for Environmental Sustainability\"\r\n\r\n(IES)  Fund  and try out new approaches in  environmental\r\n\r\nmanagement.

Since then, the number of FDWs\r\n\r\nhas  grown steadily to more than 140,000 today, which  is\r\n\r\nten times the figure in 1982.\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n*  The monthly levy rates for these sectors then were set\r\n\r\nat   30%   of  the  worker's  monthly  wages   or   $150,\r\n\r\nwhichever is greater.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                                                  Annex 1\r\n\r\n             FOREIGN DOMESTIC WORKER LEVIES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Effective Date       Foreign    Domestic    Worker    Levy\r\n\r\n                       ($/month)\r\n\r\n  1 Apr 82             30% of monthly wages\r\n\r\n  1 Nov 84             $120\r\n\r\n  1 Jan 89             $160\r\n\r\n  1 Jul 89             $200\r\n\r\n  1 Feb 90             $230\r\n\r\n  1 Aug 90             $250\r\n\r\n  1 Apr 92             $300\r\n\r\n  1 Apr 95             $330\r\n\r\n  1 Apr 98             $345\r\n\r\n  1 Jan 99             $345 (moratorium imposed )\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>VACANT MARKET PRODUCE AND COOKED FOOD STALLS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nNational  Development how many market produce and  cooked\r\n\r\nfood stalls respectively have been vacant at the Block 11\r\n\r\nHougang  Avenue 3 food centre as at 1st October 2002  and\r\n\r\nwhether  the Housing and Development Board has  plans  to\r\n\r\ntender out those stalls.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 1st October 2002, there are 42 vacant market\r\n\r\nproduce  stalls and five cooked food stalls at  Block  11\r\n\r\nHougang Avenue 7 Market/Hawker Centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vacant stalls in this market/hawker centre are\r\n\r\nreserved   for  allocation  on  a  temporary   basis   to\r\n\r\nstallholders  who  are  affected  by  closure  of   their\r\n\r\nmarkets/hawker centres under the Hawker Centres Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgramme   (HUP).

But in recent months,  it\r\n\r\nhas  largely stabilised.  Until the recent breakdown,  it\r\n\r\nhas  performed to the high service standard of 99.7% that\r\n\r\nwe  demand.   (Meeting  this  standard  means  a  maximum\r\n\r\nservice disruption of less than four minutes over  a  20-hour  daily operation.)  The average service availability\r\n\r\nfrom  June  to September was 99.74%.  This compares  well\r\n\r\nwith other similar systems in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent breakdown occurred on 21st October at\r\n\r\naround  6.40  am,  when  one guide wheel  was  dislodged,\r\n\r\ncausing a power trip.  (A guide wheel helps to steer  the\r\n\r\nvehicle  towards the desired direction, unlike  a  normal\r\n\r\nwheel  which  helps to propel the vehicle forward.)   The\r\n\r\nspindle that held the guide wheel grated against the rail\r\n\r\nand  damaged  900 metres of it.  SLRT had to replace  the\r\n\r\ndamaged sections.  The repair was time-consuming  due  to\r\n\r\nthe  extent  of the damage.  Each connection  had  to  be\r\n\r\ndismantled and re-installed carefully.  Extensive  checks\r\n\r\nand  trial  runs  had to be conducted  to  ascertain  the\r\n\r\nsafety   of  the  entire  LRT  system  before  commencing\r\n\r\nservice.  Partial service resumed on 24th October at 6.30\r\n\r\npm and full service resumed on 26th October at 12 noon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incident caused a lot of inconvenience to\r\n\r\ncommuters but it did not pose any safety implication  for\r\n\r\nthem.   In  any case, having a driver on board would  not\r\n\r\nhave  prevented the occurrence of the incident.  (BP  LRT\r\n\r\nis  not  an  unmanned  system, just that  technology  has\r\n\r\nallowed it to be controlled remotely by the crew  in  the\r\n\r\nOperations Control Centre.  The crew constantly  monitors\r\n\r\nthe  system  and carries out swift recovery actions  when\r\n\r\nfaults are detected.)\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Transport Authority has directed SMRT, the\r\n\r\nparent  company of the SLRT, to investigate the incident.\r\n\r\nOne of its terms of reference is to look into measures to\r\n\r\nprevent   similar   incidents  from  re-occurring.    The\r\n\r\ninvestigation   team   is  expected   to   complete   its\r\n\r\ninvestigation within four weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MASS RAPID TRANSIT FARE CARD</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nTransport (a) if his Ministry has thought of using  other\r\n\r\nmore  convenient fare systems when replacing the  single-trip  Mass Rapid Transit fare card with the standard fare\r\n\r\ncard where a deposit is required and refunded at the  end\r\n\r\nof  each trip, which has highly inconvenienced commuters;\r\n\r\nand   (b)  what  happens  to  the  deposits  that  remain\r\n\r\nunclaimed after a while.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two main types of transit fare cards:\r\n\r\nmagnetic  cards and ez-link contactless smartcards.   LTA\r\n\r\nhas   opted   for  the  ez-link  system  as   contactless\r\n\r\nsmartcards, unlike the existing magnetic cards, have  the\r\n\r\ncapacity  to  accommodate  the  fare  information  of  an\r\n\r\nexpanding  Rapid Transit System.  Hence, they  can  allow\r\n\r\ncommuters  to continue enjoying through-ticketing  for  a\r\n\r\nseamless journey even as they transfer from line to line.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North-East Line and all future lines will operate\r\n\r\nsolely  on the ez-link system.  They will not be able  to\r\n\r\naccept magnetic cards, hence the need to replace magnetic\r\n\r\ncards,  including  the single-trip magnetic  fare  cards.\r\n\r\nThe  latter will be replaced by the new Standard  Tickets\r\n\r\n(STs) that ride on the ez-link system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, 7% or about 75,000 train passengers use\r\n\r\nsingle-trip  magnetic  cards.  While  it  is  technically\r\n\r\nfeasible  to retain a separate ticketing system for  such\r\n\r\nsingle-trip  use,  it means a higher cost  of  operation,\r\n\r\nwhich will have to be borne by the rest of the commuters.\r\n\r\nThis does not seem fair.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A contactless smartcard is more expensive to produce\r\n\r\nbut  it  can  be re-used.  The new Standard Ticket  costs\r\n\r\nabout $5 to make.  To encourage commuters to return  them\r\n\r\nfor  re-use, a $1 refundable deposit is imposed  on  each\r\n\r\ncard.   While this has imposed some inconvenience, it  is\r\n\r\nnot  that cumbersome once commuters become familiar  with\r\n\r\nthe refund procedure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, our advice is for commuters to use the\r\n\r\nstored-value  ez-link cards instead  of  the  single-trip\r\n\r\nStandard  Tickets.  They can then enjoy lower  fares  and\r\n\r\ntransfer  rebates,  and avoid the  need  to  reclaim  the\r\n\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we have also asked the operators to\r\n\r\nconsider  allowing the Standard Tickets to  be  used  for\r\n\r\nmultiple trips on the rapid transit system (RTS) so as to\r\n\r\nreduce  the inconvenience to the small group of commuters\r\n\r\nwho want to continue using the Standard Tickets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for each ST card that is not returned, SMRT loses\r\n\r\nabout  $4.  The deposits which are not claimed will  help\r\n\r\nto cover these losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20021031/20021031-HA-0751479.htm\">Table 1 - Priority  of claim</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
