A total  of  29\r\n\r\nincidents  were  officially reported;  25  persons\r\n\r\nwere  injured out of whom six died, one  is  still\r\n\r\nwarded  in hospital, while the remaining  18  have\r\n\r\nbeen  discharged. Nine houses were damaged by fire\r\n\r\nand  the  total estimated value of the  damage  is\r\n\r\nassessed  at $560,390. The loss of lives  and  the\r\n\r\nextent  of  damage have thus rendered it expedient\r\n\r\nand necessary to amend existing legislation on the\r\n\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although cracker firing has been totally banned\r\n\r\nin  countries  like Hong Kong, West  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  it  is not our intention  to  place  a\r\n\r\ntotal ban\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the discharge of fireworks. We intend instead,\r\n\r\nto  enforce  very strict control  over  those  who\r\n\r\nindiscriminately   indulge  in   such   activities\r\n\r\nwithout   due  regard  to  persons  or   property.\r\n\r\nPatterns  of  social behaviour must  of  necessity\r\n\r\nkeep  step  with changes in standards  and  living\r\n\r\nconditions if grievous consequences to all are  to\r\n\r\nbe avoided.

It is now proposed  to\r\n\r\namend section 6 of the Ordinance to revert to  the\r\n\r\nposition  before  1966,  and  to  resuscitate  the\r\n\r\noriginal regulations relating to the control, and\r\n\r\nfiring  of  fire crackers. That is to  say,  there\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  a  total ban on the  discharge  of\r\n\r\nfireworks  but  a  general  prohibition  will   be\r\n\r\nintroduced which may be lifted by way of a Gazette\r\n\r\nNotification from time to time or by the  issuance\r\n\r\nof  licences  for  personal or  other  reasons  to\r\n\r\nindividuals  or  public  bodies  by   the   Deputy\r\n\r\nCommissioner   of   Police   or   his   authorised\r\n\r\nrepresentative. Such orders or licences may relate\r\n\r\nnot  only  to  specified dates, times  and  places\r\n\r\nwherein  fireworks may be discharged, but also  to\r\n\r\nparticular  types  of  fireworks  that  could   be\r\n\r\ndischarged  or  other conditions that  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of Police may deem it  necessary  to\r\n\r\nimpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administratively, for the purposes of\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  the law,  private  persons  or\r\n\r\npublic   bodies  granted  licences  to   let   off\r\n\r\nfireworks under the Act will be identified by  the\r\n\r\nuse  of special flags, pendants or other means  to\r\n\r\nbe   displayed  in  those  areas   which   are\r\n\r\ndesignated.

We  all  agree  that   on   festive\r\n\r\noccasions, one has a right to rejoice. To  express\r\n\r\njoy  and  happiness, several forms of celebrations\r\n\r\nare  planned and held, one of which is to let  off\r\n\r\ncrackers  galore.  This  is  especially  true   on\r\n\r\nChinese  New  Year,  Hari  Raya  Puasa  and  other\r\n\r\nfestive  occasions. But more so on  Chap  Goh  Meh\r\n\r\nwhen  long strings of crackers, strung up  several\r\n\r\nstoreys  high, are let off in many  parts  of  the\r\n\r\ncity. So-called \"cracker wars\" are held and, as  a\r\n\r\nresult,  thousands of dollars are literally  burnt\r\n\r\naway. Whoever wins a war of this nature gains,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  nothing. On the contrary, I believe  he  is\r\n\r\npoorer  by several hundreds or maybe thousands  of\r\n\r\ndollars,  though he may believe that  he  will  be\r\n\r\nprosperous as a result of firing crackers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clearly there was some form of carelessness\r\n\r\nor  indiscriminate throwing of crackers, resulting\r\n\r\nin  outbreaks  of  fire and  bringing  misery  and\r\n\r\nuntold hardship to others. I felt deeply disgusted\r\n\r\nand aghast when I read in the papers of the deaths\r\n\r\nand  of  those who suffered burns in the Chap  Goh\r\n\r\nMeh\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisaster. That was senseless and, therefore, the\r\n\r\ntimely    appearance   of   the   Minor   Offences\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill will, I hope,  bring  home  some\r\n\r\nsense to those who are responsible for such deaths\r\n\r\nand suffering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has my full support. But I wish to seek\r\n\r\nclarification on two points. Firstly,  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of  Police  is  empowered  to  issue\r\n\r\norders  by a Gazette notification authorising  the\r\n\r\ndischarge  of  fireworks  on  certain  fixed  days\r\n\r\nduring  certain  fixed hours  and  within  certain\r\n\r\ndefined  areas.  Sir, I do not  know  whether  the\r\n\r\ndefined  areas  are going to be  workable  in  the\r\n\r\nlight  of the Minister's explanation. I feel  that\r\n\r\nit  will  not work in the city as there is  hardly\r\n\r\nany  open  space  except in the parks.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthose  who wish to let off crackers must forgather\r\n\r\nthere \"to fight it out\", so to say. And will  they\r\n\r\nor  will  they  not agree that such defined  areas\r\n\r\nwill eventually be littered with cracker paper?  I\r\n\r\nfeel that they will. If so, who is to clear up the\r\n\r\nmess,  especially if the fireworks are let off  in\r\n\r\nthe parks or fields? Sir, will it not be better to\r\n\r\nhave  the  firing  of crackers carried  out  under\r\n\r\ncontrolled  conditions?  For  example,   I   would\r\n\r\nsuggest  that the Government consider a total  ban\r\n\r\non the firing of long strings of crackers and only\r\n\r\napprove the firing of smaller packets of crackers.\r\n\r\nBut  even  so, this also poses attendant problems,\r\n\r\nespecially   for  those  living  in  Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Board  flats  and  other   high-rise\r\n\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, will the Minister not consider the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of a committee or committees  with  a\r\n\r\nview  to  calling  on those who wish  to  let  off\r\n\r\ncrackers during the festive seasons to donate  the\r\n\r\nmoney    instead   to   charitable   and   welfare\r\n\r\norganisations?  I  am sure this  will  bring  real\r\n\r\nhappiness all round. After all, occasions like Han\r\n\r\nRaya  Puasa,  Chinese New Year and  Deepavali,  to\r\n\r\nname  a  few, mean joy and happiness to the people\r\n\r\nin  general. Therefore, by contributing generously\r\n\r\non  such occasions to charity, those in receipt of\r\n\r\nit will be all the happier for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the firing of crackers to celebrate\r\n\r\ncertain festivals and on certain auspicious\r\n\r\noccasions is a habit as well as a custom of the\r\n\r\nChinese. In recent years, the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nirrespective of their race, creed, faith and\r\n\r\nlanguage, have been living in close contact and\r\n\r\nharmony with one another. So under this influence\r\n\r\nnot only do the Chinese celebrate their festivals\r\n\r\nand auspicious occasions by firing crackers but\r\n\r\nother races also resort to this means to\r\n\r\ncelebrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Defence has introduced this\r\n\r\namendment   Bill  which  will  inconvenience   and\r\n\r\nembarrass  those people who want to fire crackers,\r\n\r\nand put them in some sort of difficulty. When this\r\n\r\nBill  is  passed into law, the firing of  crackers\r\n\r\nwill   be  prohibited  and  there  will   not   be\r\n\r\nliveliness and merry-making during festivals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the first time that the firing of\r\n\r\ncrackers has caused deaths and loss of property in\r\n\r\nSingapore. I think this Bill may lead to abuse and\r\n\r\nto other unpleasant consequences. For instance, at\r\n\r\nthe meet-the-people sessions, there will be crowds\r\n\r\nof  people  complaining to Members  of  Parliament\r\n\r\nabout  the  banning of the firing of crackers  and\r\n\r\nabout  matters regarding the issue of licences.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Minister himself will also  meet  with\r\n\r\nthis kind of situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the recent incidents, what we should\r\n\r\ndo  is  to look into the causes of these incidents\r\n\r\nand study whether the manufacture and the contents\r\n\r\nof  fire crackers have been against our laws. This\r\n\r\nis  the  first  time  such incidents  happened  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This is also the first time  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore resorted to the purchase  of\r\n\r\nlocally-produced    fire    crackers    and    the\r\n\r\nmanufacturers had been working round the clock  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the local demand. In this respect,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask the Minister whether the  department\r\n\r\nconcerned\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  analysed the contents of the  various\r\n\r\nbrands of fire crackers. I feel that imported fire\r\n\r\ncrackers  should not be banned, but investigations\r\n\r\nshould be made into the causes of the incidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.57 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,  this  amendment  Bill  has   been\r\n\r\nintroduced at a very opportune moment. I have been\r\n\r\nliving  in  Singapore for the last  42  years.  On\r\n\r\nevery festive occasion, fire crackers are let off.\r\n\r\nBut   only   this   year  were  there   disastrous\r\n\r\nconsequences  of cracker firing, and the  Minister\r\n\r\nshould  investigate into the incidents. We  should\r\n\r\nlook  into  the  cause of the  trouble.  It  seems\r\n\r\nsomebody  burned a house down because it was  bug-infested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laws are made for the welfare of the people. But\r\n\r\nthe   penalty  imposed  by  this  Bill  is  rather\r\n\r\nexcessive.  The  maximum  penalty  is  $500.   All\r\n\r\nfestive   occasions  are  celebrated  by   cracker\r\n\r\nfiring. Therefore, there should be a provision  in\r\n\r\nthe  law  that  crackers may  be  let  off  during\r\n\r\nfestive  occasions. We must find out  the  reasons\r\n\r\nwhy  crackers  are let off. In the past,  crackers\r\n\r\nwere let off without harmful consequences. Why  is\r\n\r\nit  that  crackers  are  let off  indiscriminately\r\n\r\nnowadays   with  loss  of  lives  and  damage   to\r\n\r\nproperty? We must look into the manufacture of the\r\n\r\ncrackers and see what substances are used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend this piece of legislation. But I must\r\n\r\nrepeat   that  the  penalty  is  excessive.   Some\r\n\r\nchildren  may  let  off crackers indiscriminately,\r\n\r\nand  where  are their parents going  to  find  the\r\n\r\nmoney  to  pay  for their offences? Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nwould  say that the provisions in the Bill  should\r\n\r\nbe  re-examined.  It  should  be  sent  to  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I have been firing  crackers  ever\r\n\r\nsince  I  was a boy. I am now 66 years old  and  I\r\n\r\nstill fire crackers. However, I have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnever injured myself and I have never heard of any\r\n\r\ndeaths   caused   by  the  firing   of   crackers.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we must look into the reasons  why  the\r\n\r\nfiring  of crackers can cause deaths and injuries.\r\n\r\nWe  should  not  impose  a total  ban  on  cracker\r\n\r\nfiring. It is not right to do so. For example, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Science and Technology will be  going\r\n\r\nto  Ulu Pandan very soon to officiate at a certain\r\n\r\nceremony,  and  crackers will be let  off  in  his\r\n\r\nhonour. We will have to fix a place for the firing\r\n\r\nof   crackers.   This  is  not  very   convenient.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am totally against this provision  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill. We should allow people to choose  their\r\n\r\nown  places to fire crackers. It is not right  for\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  fix  a place for  people  to  fire\r\n\r\ncrackers. We must allow them the freedom  to  fire\r\n\r\ncrackers whenever and wherever they like. We  must\r\n\r\nnot be like children and do whatever we like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Lim Kim San].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That clause 2 stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just now\r\n\r\nseveral  Back-benchers have made some comments  on\r\n\r\nthe Bill and I hope the Minister will reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister will do so now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, of the four\r\n\r\nspeakers, two of them fully support the Bill,  one\r\n\r\nis  against  it,  and one, not  understanding  the\r\n\r\npurpose of the Bill, is probably neither for nor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nagainst  it.

The Deputy Commissioner\r\n\r\nof  Police will then be directed to specify  those\r\n\r\nareas for the firing of crackers which Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament,    with   members   of    their    own\r\n\r\nconstituencies, have decided upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

That is the only way we\r\n\r\nknow  of  controlling it. If we allow everyone  to\r\n\r\nfire crackers freely and indiscriminately in their\r\n\r\nown  homes, we will have a repetition of what  has\r\n\r\nhappened.

Those  who\r\n\r\nindulged  in firing crackers during the  Chap  Goh\r\n\r\nMeh  festival showed a lack of responsibility  and\r\n\r\nsocial  consciousness and, as a result, six people\r\n\r\nlost  their lives.

However, in  the\r\n\r\npast  whenever  the  Prime  Minister  toured   the\r\n\r\nconstituencies and the Ministers went to the rural\r\n\r\nareas,  they were welcomed by the people there  by\r\n\r\nthe  firing of crackers.

Sir, this Bill in  a\r\n\r\nway  will benefit owner-occupied properties  which\r\n\r\ncarry an annual value of not more than $6,000. But\r\n\r\nin  my view it will not help those owners who have\r\n\r\nto  pay property tax on owner-occupied property of\r\n\r\nan  annual  value  of  $6,000;  let  it  be  at  a\r\n\r\nconcessionary rate of 18 per cent, 23 per cent  or\r\n\r\n27  per cent. In other words, if an owner-occupied\r\n\r\nproperty  is today assessed at an annual value  of\r\n\r\n$3,000,  it can be reviewed annually, and in  most\r\n\r\ncases  it  is  revalued upwards.  Therefore,  more\r\n\r\nproperty  tax will be paid as the annual value  is\r\n\r\nreviewed each year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My contention is this: whilst one benefits from\r\n\r\nexemption  of  income  tax in  respect  of  owner-occupied property valued at not more than  $6,000,\r\n\r\nsuch a property, if revalued upwards, will carry a\r\n\r\nhigher  property tax. Under such circumstances,  I\r\n\r\nwould  be  grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister  for Finance could  assure  this\r\n\r\nHouse   that   properties  which  are   considered\r\n\r\nsufficiently assessed or valued today will not  be\r\n\r\nrevalued next year or the following year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, I am afraid I cannot give\r\n\r\nsuch  an  assurance to the Member for Punggol.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  \"annual value\" is defined by  the  Property\r\n\r\nTax Ordinance as the value that a house can be let\r\n\r\nout   unfurnished,  the  owner  paying   for   its\r\n\r\nmaintenance  and  repairs. In  order  to  get  the\r\n\r\ncorrect  annual  value,  the  property  should  be\r\n\r\nrevalued  every  year so that  it  will  correctly\r\n\r\nreflect  its current market value. The Member  for\r\n\r\nPunggol is asking us not to do that very thing, an\r\n\r\nannual revaluation, so that the annual value of  a\r\n\r\nproperty can reflect its market value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this Bill comes into operation, any property\r\n\r\nhaving  an  annual value of more than $6,000  will\r\n\r\nattract income tax.

And at the same time, Sir,  there  is\r\n\r\nalso the question of property tax. In other words,\r\n\r\nthere are two taxes coming under one income. I  am\r\n\r\nnot  saying that properties should not  be  valued\r\n\r\nannually,  but surely the officers in  the  Inland\r\n\r\nRevenue  Department,  in which  the  Property  Tax\r\n\r\nDivision is, should look into this aspect of owner-occupied properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid\r\n\r\nI  do  not  know  what assurance  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nPunggol  wants me to give.

My\r\n\r\nquestion is simply this. What I said just now  was\r\n\r\nthat  those  owner-occupied properties which  have\r\n\r\nalready  been  reasonably assessed should  not  be\r\n\r\nreassessed every year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have\r\n\r\nalready  said that the very purpose of revaluation\r\n\r\nis  to ensure that the property correctly reflects\r\n\r\nits  market  value,  and that it  should  be  done\r\n\r\nannually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just do not understand what the Member wants.\r\n\r\nIf he says that any annual value above $6,000 will\r\n\r\nattract income tax, that is not correct because it\r\n\r\nis only if the net annual value of the property is\r\n\r\nabove $6,000 then it will attract income tax.  The\r\n\r\n\"net  annual value\" is defined as the gross annual\r\n\r\nvalue  minus the property tax you pay,  minus  the\r\n\r\npremium  you pay on insuring your property,  minus\r\n\r\nmaintenance, and also minus any interest that  you\r\n\r\nmay have to pay on mortgaging the property. But  I\r\n\r\nsuppose  anybody who lives in a house that  has  a\r\n\r\nnet  annual  value of $6,000 or above  would  have\r\n\r\nbought  it  outright  and  not  have  to  pay  any\r\n\r\nmortgage interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am still not quite sure what the Member wants,\r\n\r\nSir. I  think  what he objects  to  is  that  any\r\n\r\nproperty having a net annual value of above $6,000\r\n\r\nattracts  income  tax  as well  as  property  tax.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  he says it is two taxes. That  is  not\r\n\r\ncorrect  because any income is supposed to attract\r\n\r\nincome  tax, and a piece of property gives  you  a\r\n\r\nnotional   income.  However,  the  Government   is\r\n\r\ngenerous  enough and now provides in the law  that\r\n\r\nany  property  having a net annual value  of  less\r\n\r\nthan  $6,000 will not attract income  tax  on  its\r\n\r\nannual value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

The total\r\n\r\nsubsidy by the Government for the coming financial\r\n\r\nyear will amount to more than $1.1 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the reorganisation of Ngee Ann College\r\n\r\ninto   a   College   providing  mainly   technical\r\n\r\neducation  facilities, the name  of  the  College,\r\n\r\nknown  as Ngee Ann College under section 3 of  the\r\n\r\nNgee  Ann  College Act, 1967, was administratively\r\n\r\nchanged  to that of Ngee Ann Technical College  on\r\n\r\n22nd August, 1968, by the Ngee Ann Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is introduced to regularise the\r\n\r\nposition,  that is, to enable Ngee Ann College  to\r\n\r\nassume the name of Ngee Ann Technical College with\r\n\r\nretrospective effect from 22nd August, 1968.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto ask the Parliamentary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  the  Minister  for  Education   the\r\n\r\nfollowing questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, what other courses of study, apart from\r\n\r\nthe    Mechanical   Engineering   and   Industrial\r\n\r\nElectronics Courses, are being offered to students\r\n\r\nand  what level of education do these courses lead\r\n\r\nto?

However, it was not until 1955 that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Asian   Seamen's   Club   Incorporation\r\n\r\nOrdinance  was passed which created a  corporation\r\n\r\nentrusted with the task of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestablishing  a Club for Asian seafarers.  Work  on\r\n\r\nthe  Club  began in that year and the building  was\r\n\r\ncompleted and declared open in February 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Asian Seamen's Club Incorporation\r\n\r\nOrdinance  has  remained  unchanged  since  it  was\r\n\r\nenacted in 1955 - 15 years ago. Certain provisions are\r\n\r\nobsolete  and  others require amendments  for  more\r\n\r\neffective   administration.  One   example   of   a\r\n\r\nprovision   in  the  Ordinance  which  has   become\r\n\r\nobsolete  is  section 4 (d) which states  that  the\r\n\r\nClub  should provide lectures in nautical and other\r\n\r\nsubjects. This may have been necessary in  the  old\r\n\r\ndays   when   there  were  no  teaching  facilities\r\n\r\navailable,  but  the  School of  Nautical  Studies,\r\n\r\nwhich was founded in our Polytechnic in 1960, makes\r\n\r\nthis   objective  superfluous.  This  section   has\r\n\r\naccordingly been deleted from the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7 (2) of the existing Ordinance provides\r\n\r\nthat  all  members  of  the  Committee  except  the\r\n\r\nChairman would retire on expiration of their  terms\r\n\r\nof   office.  It's  considered  for  administrative\r\n\r\nreasons  that this provision should also  apply  to\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman,  and  the Bill accordingly  provides\r\n\r\nthat  the Chairman should also retire on expiration\r\n\r\nof his period of appointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7 (3) of the existing Ordinance states\r\n\r\nthat  a  vacancy shall arise if a member is  absent\r\n\r\nfrom Singapore for more than three months. The  new\r\n\r\nsection 7 (3) in the Bill amends this period to six\r\n\r\nmonths.

After due consideration,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   has   decided  to   introduce   these\r\n\r\namendments  in order to remove such doubts  as  to\r\n\r\nthe practical applicability of the sections of the\r\n\r\nAct  that are now being amended or because, as the\r\n\r\nlaw  now  stands, these sections in the  Act  have\r\n\r\nbeen found to be too restrictive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.

The proposals  for\r\n\r\namendment  to  sections 37 and  38  of  the  Legal\r\n\r\nProfession  Act, 1966, that define the  limits  of\r\n\r\nsuch  exclusive rights have come from  accountants\r\n\r\nand  trade mark agents as well as from the General\r\n\r\nCouncil of the Bar itself. These amendments, it is\r\n\r\nhoped, will now resolve the doubts the professions\r\n\r\nmight  have  had  regarding  the  extent  of  such\r\n\r\nexclusive   rights   given   to   advocates    and\r\n\r\nsolicitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are further new provisions in the Bill\r\n\r\nwhich   have  been  designed  to  facilitate   the\r\n\r\nsupervision   of  bills  of  costs  submitted   by\r\n\r\nadvocates and solicitors. Up till now an order  of\r\n\r\ncourt  would  be necessary before a  bill  can  be\r\n\r\ntaxed by the Registrar of the Supreme Court.  When\r\n\r\nthis  Bill becomes law, this requirement would  be\r\n\r\ndispensed with where the taxation of the  bill  is\r\n\r\nagreed to by the parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to provide\r\n\r\nin   this  Bill  certain  amendments  that   would\r\n\r\nincorporate recent developments in the  rules  and\r\n\r\npractice   governing   the  relationship   between\r\n\r\nsolicitors  and clients in England. Thus  we  have\r\n\r\nadapted  to suit local conditions here certain  of\r\n\r\nthe rules relating to moneys in clients' accounts.\r\n\r\nThe   provisions  in  the  Bill  effecting   these\r\n\r\namendments will permit a solicitor to place moneys\r\n\r\nbelonging to a client in a deposit account with  a\r\n\r\nbank  so  as to earn interest. Such interest  will\r\n\r\nthen  be  apportioned  to the  solicitor's  client\r\n\r\nexcept,  of  course, where the task of  allocating\r\n\r\nsuch  interest  earned is rendered impractical  or\r\n\r\nwell-nigh  impossible  on account  of  either  the\r\n\r\nsmallness  of  the  sums  involved  or  where  the\r\n\r\nportions  of such moneys cannot easily be  defined\r\n\r\nor traced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are other provisions in clauses 28\r\n\r\nand  31  which  would enlarge the  powers  of  the\r\n\r\nDisciplinary  Committee of the Bar Council.  These\r\n\r\nenlarged powers would enable the Council  to  take\r\n\r\nwhatever  steps they think proper against  members\r\n\r\nof  the  profession who have been  found  to  have\r\n\r\ncommitted breaches of professional conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These then are the main changes that will be\r\n\r\nbrought  about by this Bill.

The\r\n\r\nCode   regulates   the   manner   in   which    an\r\n\r\ninvestigation is to be carried out. In the  formal\r\n\r\npart  of his investigation, a Coroner sits  either\r\n\r\nalone or with a jury of three to five persons. The\r\n\r\nproceeding  is  called an inquest or  an  inquiry,\r\n\r\naccording  to  whether the Coroner  sits  with  or\r\n\r\nwithout a jury. If the death occurs in a prison or\r\n\r\nunder  suspicious circumstances in an institution,\r\n\r\nthe  Coroner investigating it has until  now  been\r\n\r\nrequired to sit with a jury, but in most cases  he\r\n\r\nhas  a  discretion and sits alone. Where he  finds\r\n\r\nthat  a  crime has been committed, he may issue  a\r\n\r\nwarrant  for  the  arrest of the  person  whom  he\r\n\r\nthinks   should  be  charged,  but  he  makes   no\r\n\r\ndetermination of that person's guilt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.

The present Bill  seeks\r\n\r\nlikewise   to   remove   juries   from   Coroners'\r\n\r\nproceedings.

Since becoming independent,\r\n\r\nSingapore  has made arrangements with  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  and  passed the necessary legislation  to\r\n\r\nsecure  the  continuance of appeals to  the  Privy\r\n\r\nCouncil,   to  regulate  them  and  to  make   the\r\n\r\ndetermination of appeals effective. Those laws are\r\n\r\nthe   Constitution  (Amendment)  Act,  1966,   the\r\n\r\nJudicial  Committee Act, 1966,  and  the  Judicial\r\n\r\nCommittee (Amendment) Act, 1967.
