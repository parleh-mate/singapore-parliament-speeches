Sir, in the constitutional\r\n\r\ndiscussions  in  London, it  was  urged  upon  the\r\n\r\nColonial Secretary that it would be desirable,  in\r\n\r\nthe interests of focusing loyalty on the Queen, to\r\n\r\nhave a Malayan-born Yang di-Pertuan Negara-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> You mean\r\n\r\nthe contrary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> And in order that there should\r\n\r\nbe  no misunderstanding or misinterpretation  that\r\n\r\nthe   Yang   di-Pertuan  Negara  goes   with   the\r\n\r\ngovernment of the day, it was agreed that the term\r\n\r\nof  office of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara should be\r\n\r\nfour  years as against the term of office  of  the\r\n\r\ngovernment  for  five  years,  so  that   whatever\r\n\r\ngovernment  succeeds the present  Government,  the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan Negara will be a nominee  of  the\r\n\r\ngovernment  of  the day. But, unfortunately,  Sir,\r\n\r\nsome leaders of the P.A.P. in the Party as well as\r\n\r\nin  the  Government do seem to give the impression\r\n\r\noutside and to the Members of the Opposition  that\r\n\r\nthe  present  Yang di-Pertuan Negara is  a  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan Negara. It should not  be  so.  I\r\n\r\nwill   just  quote  an  instance  where   such   a\r\n\r\nmisinterpretation could have and has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaken place. I refer to the visit of the Yang  di-\r\n\r\nPertuan  Negara in the early part of this year  to\r\n\r\nthe Southern Islands. It is good, it is right,  it\r\n\r\nis  proper that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  should\r\n\r\nvisit  not  only  the islands  but  all  parts  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, so as to bring it to the notice of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore that we now have a  Malayan-born  Yang di-Pertuan Negara. Unfortunately,  Sir,\r\n\r\nhe  was  accompanied on his visit to the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslands by a Minister (we can have no objection to\r\n\r\nthat), by Parliamentary Secretaries (to that again\r\n\r\nwe can have no objection), but there were included\r\n\r\nin  that  retinue P.A.P. Assemblymen; whereas  the\r\n\r\nelected  Member  for  the  Southern  Islands   was\r\n\r\ncompletely   ignored.  Therefore,   we   got   the\r\n\r\nimpression  that  here  was  a  P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\ntrying to sell a P.A.P. Yang di-Pertuan Negara.  I\r\n\r\nam  sure  that  that was not the  intention.  Then\r\n\r\nthere    was    another   instance   where    this\r\n\r\nmisinterpretation could be given credence. It  was\r\n\r\nbecause  of the advice of certain of the Ministers\r\n\r\nthat  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara had, as reported\r\n\r\nin the papers, given a speech making comparison of\r\n\r\nGovernments-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Will the Member take his\r\n\r\nseat?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have been following the hon.\r\n\r\nMember's  speech  very  closely  and  I  must,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, be quite satisfied in my mind that  he  is\r\n\r\nnot  offending any of the Standing Orders. One  of\r\n\r\nthe Standing Orders is Standing Order 46 (8) which\r\n\r\nreads:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The conduct of the Sovereign, Members of the\r\n\r\nRoyal  Family, or the Yang di-Pertuan Negara shall\r\n\r\nnot be referred to in any circumstances.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  that if the hon. Member is now embarking on  a\r\n\r\ndissertation  on  what the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara\r\n\r\nhad said in any of his visits, then I think he  is\r\n\r\ncoming  very near the line and is probably out  of\r\n\r\norder. But if his speech is levelled solely at the\r\n\r\nmatter he has touched on, that the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara is accompanied by P.A.P. Members and P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters to the exclusion of Opposition  Members,\r\n\r\nthen perhaps he is just within the Standing Order.\r\n\r\nTun Lim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, what I want to point out\r\n\r\nin  my  speech is that Ministers of the Government\r\n\r\nshould  understand and realise that the  Yang \r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Negara is our Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  the\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara for the whole of the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore. Any advice that any Minister tenders\r\n\r\nto  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara  must  take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the fact that the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  is above politics. If any advice given  to\r\n\r\nhim  shows a political bent, then it is definitely\r\n\r\nwrong  on  the  part  of  the  Minister,  or   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary, or the Government  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole,  to  so advise him. It is just like  asking\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore to express loyalty to the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan Negara, to the flag, to the State\r\n\r\nanthem.  We all will show loyalty to this  symbol.\r\n\r\nBut if the wrong impression is given to the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore that it is a P.A.P. Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara,  a P.A.P. anthem, and a P.A.P. flag,  then\r\n\r\nsurely one cannot expect that there would be  that\r\n\r\nloyalty from the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am sorry that the\r\n\r\nleader  of  the Opposition has seen  something  to\r\n\r\ncomplain  about  in the conduct of  the  Yang \r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan  Negara. I think it is generally  accepted\r\n\r\nthat  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara is  above  party\r\n\r\npolitics.  He  plays  an important  and  impartial\r\n\r\nconstitutional role. I do not wish to go into  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  in  which it came  about  that  the\r\n\r\nvisit to the Southern Islands was made without the\r\n\r\nMember  for the Southern Islands. It depends  upon\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances. If it is a visit in connection\r\n\r\nwith  a  government project, then it  may  be  the\r\n\r\nopinion  of the Minister in charge of that project\r\n\r\nthat  the  Member of that particular  constituency\r\n\r\nhas  nothing whatsoever to do with the project  as\r\n\r\nsuch. The tour of the Southern Islands referred to\r\n\r\nwas  in  connection with a project to give special\r\n\r\ndevelopment, not just to the Southern Islands  but\r\n\r\nto  the Malay community in Kampong Melayu. On that\r\n\r\noccasion,  the Assemblyman for the  area  was  not\r\n\r\ninvited. But it might be of interest to Members of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  to know that the Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  has  expressed the intention to  visit  as\r\n\r\nmany\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the kampongs on the mainland as possible in the\r\n\r\ncoming year. I do not know if my Secretary has got\r\n\r\nin  touch  with the Opposition, but it is proposed\r\n\r\nthat  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara makes visits once\r\n\r\na  fortnight  to  a  particular division  and  the\r\n\r\nAssemblyman of that division will introduce him to\r\n\r\nthe  community leaders there. I hope that  Members\r\n\r\nof  the  Opposition will co-operate and  make  the\r\n\r\nvisit  of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  to   the\r\n\r\nkampongs  a  success.

He  asked   this\r\n\r\nquestion in Hansard of 11th December, 1959, Volume\r\n\r\n11, No. 15 at column 910;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether the House could be informed that the  then\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the Rent Conciliation  Board  was  a\r\n\r\npractising member of the Bar. At column  912,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park went on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As far as I understand the Minister's reply,\r\n\r\nthough  he did not specifically say so, it  would\r\n\r\nappear,   Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  that  the  present President of the Rent Conciliation Board  is,  in\r\n\r\nfact, a practising member of the Bar. If that  is\r\n\r\naccepted,  then I will proceed on that  basis.  I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest to the Minister that it is  highly\r\n\r\nundesirable for a practising member  of  the  Bar\r\n\r\nto  be  appointed to such a post. In  his  normal\r\n\r\npractice,  he  would come into contact  with  all\r\n\r\nsorts of people-tenants, landlords and owners  of\r\n\r\nproperty.

At   a\r\n\r\nmeeting of the Central Executive Committee of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party on 10th January, 1960,  the\r\n\r\nmatter   was  discussed.  As  a  result  of   that\r\n\r\ndiscussion,  a  decision  was  reached  which  was\r\n\r\nconveyed  to all People's Action Party Assemblymen\r\n\r\nand lawyers.

Taking  his\r\n\r\nplace is another European practising advocate  and\r\n\r\nsolicitor, Mr C. H. Smith.

In  the\r\n\r\ncase of practising lawyers, I say there is nothing\r\n\r\nwrong too, particularly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the case of the previous Chairman of the  Rent\r\n\r\nConciliation Board. Before he was appointed to the\r\n\r\nBoard,  I  extracted a promise from  him  that  he\r\n\r\nwould  not  take  any  case  concerning  the  Rent\r\n\r\nnot.  But that is not so with the members  of  the\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax Board of Review. The people know  that\r\n\r\nthe  legal firm of the Chairman of the Income  Tax\r\n\r\nBoard  of  Review  takes up cases  which  come  up\r\n\r\nbefore  the Board of Review, although he does  not\r\n\r\nattend those sittings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another difference is that the\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Rent Conciliation Board, including\r\n\r\nthe   then  Chairman,  are  not  paid  for   their\r\n\r\nservices, but I believe the Chairman of the Income\r\n\r\nTax Board of Review is paid about $100 or $200 for\r\n\r\neach  sitting, which might last from five  minutes\r\n\r\nto one day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of the composition of\r\n\r\nquasi-judicial organisations, whether the members should\r\n\r\nor   should   not   be  practising   lawyers   and\r\n\r\naccountants,  or  whether the members  are  openly\r\n\r\nconnected   with   political   parties,   is   not\r\n\r\nimportant.  This  is a clear and concrete  example\r\n\r\nthat  the present leaders of the Government, as  I\r\n\r\nproved yesterday, are protecting the interests  of\r\n\r\nvested properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, it gives me very little\r\n\r\npleasure  to expose the stupidities and  ignorance\r\n\r\nof  Members  of  this Assembly, particularly  when\r\n\r\nsuch an action will hurt innocent parties who were\r\n\r\nappointed to take over the chairmanship of \r\n\r\nquasi-judicial  tribunals.

They  can  do  no\r\n\r\nexploitation, and they are not in a  position  to.\r\n\r\nThe  exploitation,  if any, is  contained  in  the\r\n\r\nterms  of  the  Ordinance. The provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  in  so  far as they  are  against  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the farmers and in  favour  of  the\r\n\r\nlandlords, have been suspended, and legislation is\r\n\r\nbeing  prepared  and  will be  introduced  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  this Budget session to protect  their\r\n\r\ninterests  permanently. But if you have  a \r\n\r\nquasi-judicial  tribunal- first, you are the prosecutor;\r\n\r\nthen you appoint your friend to be the judge,  and\r\n\r\nyou provide him with powers to be the assessor; so\r\n\r\nwhat  is the point of the quasi-judicial tribunal?\r\n\r\nYou  could just make an administrative order  that\r\n\r\nthat  shall be so. In the same way, the Assessment\r\n\r\nCommittee  and a few other stupidities which  have\r\n\r\nsince  been  rectified. That is the  simple  basic\r\n\r\nprinciple - that you shall not be judge in your  own\r\n\r\ncase and you shall not be prosecutor and judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry that Mr Tann Wee Tiong was involved.\r\n\r\nHe  had  a  discussion with me and  I  immediately\r\n\r\nconceded  the difficult position in which  he  was\r\n\r\nplaced,   particularly  when  he   found   himself\r\n\r\naccompanied by eight P.A.P. Assemblymen. They  all\r\n\r\nresigned and Mr Tann Wee Tiong, with good  grace,\r\n\r\nimmediately withdrew. Since then a whole panel  of\r\n\r\npeople, with the Second Civil District Court Judge\r\n\r\nas   President,   have  been  running   the   Rent\r\n\r\nConciliation  Board. They are  representatives  of\r\n\r\nthe Trades Union Congress and the Chambers of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommerce,    together   with   three    Government\r\n\r\npensioners  and  a  retired officer  of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil.  I  should  hate to  imagine,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of unions, Government  pensioners\r\n\r\nand a City Council retired officer who are serving\r\n\r\non  a  quasi-judicial body - even if it  is  not  at\r\n\r\ngreat  expense, at least some time and energy  and\r\n\r\neffort    is   expended   on   these   matters - are\r\n\r\ninstruments of oppression of the poor tenants  and\r\n\r\nfarmers  at the behest of the landlords.  That  is\r\n\r\nnot  their  duty. They are there to allocate  rent\r\n\r\nincreases,  and  control rent of properties  where\r\n\r\nsanitation is put in and roads built, and  certain\r\n\r\nother specified or common improvements are made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I want to point out is this: the stupidity\r\n\r\nand  repetition of lies in which innocent  parties\r\n\r\nare hurt makes this-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am not-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

It is a principle which  is\r\n\r\nextremely important - what we do should be right and\r\n\r\nappear  to  be  right.  We have  no  intention  of\r\n\r\nrunning  a police State; that is not what  we  are\r\n\r\nhere  for. If you are to implement a principle  of\r\n\r\nthe  rule of law, then let us at least observe the\r\n\r\nbare   essentials.  And  for  that  reason,   that\r\n\r\ndirective   went   out-Party  accountants,   Party\r\n\r\nlawyers and Party men should stay out of tribunals\r\n\r\nwhere  they have to adjudicate on members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsometimes  the  interests of Party  men  involved.\r\n\r\nOpen  identification and open  bias  is  bad.  The\r\n\r\nprinciple   is   simple.  If  that  principle   is\r\n\r\nchallenged and if the Member for Hong Lim believes\r\n\r\nthat  that principle is being enforced because  we\r\n\r\nwant  an instrument to oppress the people, then  I\r\n\r\nthink  he  is  well  on the  way  to  one  of  the\r\n\r\nreputable  institutions that were referred  to  in\r\n\r\nthe asides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> The Member for Hong Lim.

I\r\n\r\nwas  present at the meeting and it was my duty  to\r\n\r\ncarry   out  the  recommendation  of  the  Central\r\n\r\nExecutive  Committee. If the Member for  Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nwill  just  look  at page 42 of  these  Estimates,\r\n\r\n\"Remarks\"  column-against the  post  \"First  Civil\r\n\r\nDistrict Judge\", he will see that the salary scale\r\n\r\nof  that post was revised by Establishment Warrant\r\n\r\nNo.  26/60  from the timescale salary  $1,100-40A-1,420  to  a  Grade F post, \r\n\r\ndrawing  a  salary  of $1,620. \r\n\r\nIt was my duty to take this matter up with\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance in view of  the  Central\r\n\r\nExecutive  Committee's decision that there  should\r\n\r\nbe  no practising member of the Bar as Chairman of\r\n\r\nthe  Income  Tax  Board  of  Review.  It  was  the\r\n\r\nintention, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir, that the person who was to fill this post  of\r\n\r\nCivil  District Judge should also be the  Chairman\r\n\r\nof  the Income Tax Board of Review. And we have on\r\n\r\nour  side  faithfully implemented the decision  of\r\n\r\nthe Central Executive Committee, so that there has\r\n\r\nbeen no manipulation whatsoever on the part of the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister.  I  was present  at  the  Central\r\n\r\nExecutive Committee meeting when that decision was\r\n\r\nmade,  and  it  was my duty to  see  that  it  was\r\n\r\nimplemented.  I  therefore took  it  up  with  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance. As a result of that,  there\r\n\r\nhas  been this revision of the salary of the  post\r\n\r\nof \"Civil District Judge\". I cannot see how such a\r\n\r\nsuggestion can honestly be made by a former member\r\n\r\nof   the   Central  Executive  Committee   and   a\r\n\r\nresponsible  person  who  is  a  Member   of   the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly for the constituency of  Hong\r\n\r\nLim.  I  am  indeed surprised that that suggestion\r\n\r\nshould have come from him today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very\r\n\r\ngrateful for the impartial interpretation  of  the\r\n\r\ndecision  of  the  Central made just  now  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Law. The decision was that\r\n\r\nit   was  wrong  for  a  practising  advocate  and\r\n\r\nsolicitor  to  be  chairman of any  quasi-judicial\r\n\r\norganisation  and not, as the Prime  Minister  has\r\n\r\nsaid  just  now,  that  it was  not  wrong  for  a\r\n\r\npractising lawyer to be chairman but that  it  was\r\n\r\nwrong  for  a  political practising lawyer  to  be\r\n\r\nchairman.  They  are two different interpretations\r\n\r\naltogether.  So,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  very\r\n\r\ngrateful  for  the  assurance  given  us  by   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour and Law,  that  there  is  a\r\n\r\nBudget provision that a First Civil District Judge\r\n\r\nhas  been appointed. According to the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance, Mr Jeyaratnam has been appointed  to  be\r\n\r\nChairman  of the Income Tax Board of Review.  But,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, I have had a letter from the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Finance  only  two days back saying  that  the\r\n\r\nChairman is Mr C. H. Smith. I wonder whether  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance has control of  Mr  H.  G.\r\n\r\nWells' \"The Time Machine\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso that he can go forward and backward any time he\r\n\r\nlikes.  If  the Minister wants to have a  look  at\r\n\r\nthis  letter,  I shall pass it over  to  him.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, in my opinion, that  issue  is  not\r\n\r\nimportant. The issue is this: that the leaders  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government are now, in full force,  with  all\r\n\r\nhonesty    and   sincerity,   protecting    vested\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot\r\n\r\nimagine  anything more stupid than the  concluding\r\n\r\nremarks   of   the  Member  for  Hong   Lim.   The\r\n\r\nexplanation  for Mr Smith carrying on  with  some\r\n\r\ncases  of which he was Chairman early on is  quite\r\n\r\nsimple.  Income tax review cases are often complex\r\n\r\nand   require  prolonged  investigation.   It   is\r\n\r\nobviously nonsense and it would be quite wrong  to\r\n\r\npass on cases that have been under his examination\r\n\r\nfor  a  long  time  to the new Chairman.  What  has\r\n\r\nhappened  was  that  all the old  cases  continued\r\n\r\nunder  the same Board of Review which sat on  them\r\n\r\nat  the beginning, and the new cases have gone  to\r\n\r\nthe new Chairman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I just want to try and\r\n\r\nconnect  the two points neatly, Mr Speaker,  Sir.\r\n\r\nThe  important and basic decision which was  taken\r\n\r\nby  the Central Executive Committee on my proposal\r\n\r\nwas  one of principle - that a Party man cannot  sit\r\n\r\non  a  judicial  tribunal, and  you  say  you  are\r\n\r\ndispensing  justice.  But there  is  a  subsidiary\r\n\r\npoint  that sometimes practising lawyers, although\r\n\r\nunconnected  with  parties, do  derive  an  unfair\r\n\r\nadvantage or benefit from their occupancy  of  the\r\n\r\nchairmanship  of certain tribunals. Therefore,  as\r\n\r\nin  the case of the Income Tax Board of Review, it\r\n\r\nbeing  a lucrative branch of the law, it might  be\r\n\r\nnecessary not to give anybody an unfair advantage.\r\n\r\nBut  the basic point contained in that resolution,\r\n\r\nwhich  was adopted and which the Member so  kindly\r\n\r\nread  without  knowing what it was all  about,  is\r\n\r\nthat   no  Party  man  should  be  on  a  judicial\r\n\r\ntribunal. If anybody says that that is wrong, that\r\n\r\nit  is contrary to democratic laws, and that it is\r\n\r\nagainst  the interest of the people, then  I  say,\r\n\r\nlike  Alice in Wonderland.

M. Byrne,\r\n\r\nsaid yesterday.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir, as I said,  the  issue  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether  he is a practising lawyer or not  is  not\r\n\r\nimportant.

In\r\n\r\nthe  case  of the Arbitration Court, it  is  in  a\r\n\r\nsomewhat different position. The Arbitration Judge\r\n\r\nis assisted b) one nominee of the employer and one\r\n\r\nnominee  of  the union. Therefore,  a  balance  of\r\n\r\ninterests is maintained. It is just like assessors\r\n\r\nhelping a Judge. But the Judge himself should  not\r\n\r\nbe  biased  and  should not be committed.  If  the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim cannot see that, then I  think\r\n\r\na  lot  of time will be wasted if we try  at  this\r\n\r\nrather late hour to initiate him into the niceties\r\n\r\nof doing things in a fair and just manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when one is\r\n\r\nignorant  I think it is folly to be wise.  I  have\r\n\r\nexplained at great length in this Chamber what the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Arbitration Court is. I have  made  the\r\n\r\npoint  that  it  does not exercise truly  judicial\r\n\r\nfunctions. When there is a dispute and the parties\r\n\r\nfail  to  agree,  or they cannot reach  agreement,\r\n\r\nthey then go to the tribunal. They go to this body\r\n\r\non which both employers and employees are properly\r\n\r\nrepresented, and this body makes the agreement for\r\n\r\nthe   parties.   There  is  no  judicial   process\r\n\r\ninvolved. For instance, one party wants  $10.  The\r\n\r\nIndustrial Arbitration Court says, \"You\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nget $5.\" The Court decides on $5. That is the sort\r\n\r\nof   thing.

When  the\r\n\r\nparties fail to agree, or when one party does  not\r\n\r\nagree,  they  submit the dispute  to  this  \r\n\r\nquasi-judicial organisation for adjudication.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nsurprise  to me to hear the Minister say that  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration  Court  is  not  a   truly\r\n\r\njudicial  body. I am sorry for the  President  and\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Arbitration Court.  I  think  the\r\n\r\nCourt   should   not  be  called  the   Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration   Court.  It  should  be   called   an\r\n\r\nArbitration - it is very difficult to find a  word\r\n\r\nmeaning  that  you want to exercise the  law.

I  almost  wish\r\n\r\nthat we can go round the Standing Orders and allow\r\n\r\nthe Speaker to participate in the debate. Sir, you\r\n\r\nwill recall that when you first wrote to me on the\r\n\r\nsubject  on  26th  June,  1959,  you  gave  me   a\r\n\r\nmemorandum on it. There was a subsequent  exchange\r\n\r\nof  letters - on  26th June, and the  reply  on  2nd\r\n\r\nJuly. On 8th September, 1959, a letter giving more\r\n\r\ndetails  of  why and where perhaps  the  Executive\r\n\r\nshould  not  in the past have interfered.  Another\r\n\r\nletter dated 30th June, 1960, followed up with the\r\n\r\nletter  of 12th September. You will remember  that\r\n\r\nafter the last letter of 11th July, 1960, we had a\r\n\r\nmeeting  on 27th  July.  I think  the  position  we\r\n\r\nreached  then was this. I have here a  note  which\r\n\r\nwas made immediately after the meeting, Sir, and I\r\n\r\nthink  it fairly represents the arguments on  both\r\n\r\nsides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then indicated to you that we were against\r\n\r\nhaving  an Assembly with a closed service  because\r\n\r\nof  the  paucity of talent that you would then  be\r\n\r\ntroubled with. You pointed out, Sir, that you  did\r\n\r\nnot  want  a  closed service. You  understood  the\r\n\r\nposition.  But  what you wanted  was  disciplinary\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  the Assembly staff to be  taken  away\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Executive,  because  they  are  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  service, although they  could  still  be\r\n\r\ntransferred  out of the Assembly provided,  as  in\r\n\r\nthe  case of the Clerk, the consent of the Speaker\r\n\r\nis   first  obtained.  I  then  pointed  out   the\r\n\r\ndifficulty  of  having a government servant  under\r\n\r\nGeneral  Orders and Colonial Regulations (or  what\r\n\r\nhas  replaced  these Regulations) working  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly and outside the discipline of the service\r\n\r\nhe  is  in.  I indicated that we were prepared  to\r\n\r\nconsider a closed service for specialist jobs like\r\n\r\nthe Clerk of the Assembly, perhaps the Sergeant at\r\n\r\nArms,    and    such   other   very    specialised\r\n\r\nappointments. I think the meeting ended  with  you\r\n\r\nexpressing unhappiness, and you indicated that you\r\n\r\nwould  pursue the question of closing the  job  of\r\n\r\nthe  Clerk  of the Assembly and perhaps  reviewing\r\n\r\nthe whole matter again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have given this matter some further\r\n\r\nthought,  and I had a further discussion with  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance. I can only make this  little\r\n\r\nconcession.  Mr  Speaker, Sir. If  the  present\r\n\r\nmembers of the Assembly staff feel that they  want\r\n\r\nto  opt out of the Government service and be in  a\r\n\r\nclosed service of the Assembly, the Government has\r\n\r\nno  objection. Then these people will  lose  their\r\n\r\navenues  of  promotion in the Government  service.\r\n\r\nThey  are  not  to compete with the  rest  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment servants when other appointments  occur\r\n\r\nin Ministries outside this Assembly. But we cannot\r\n\r\nimpose  on  them, and I think it is the considered\r\n\r\nopinion  of  the  Government  that  it  would   be\r\n\r\nundesirable  to  close  the service  because,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, you will be unable to get that  wide\r\n\r\nselection of talent which would be available in  a\r\n\r\nwider  establishment. But if there is  anybody  in\r\n\r\nthis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssembly who feels that his independence of action\r\n\r\nwould be better safeguarded if he were out of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment service - perhaps I should not have  used\r\n\r\nthe  word  \"out  of  the  Government  service\" - and\r\n\r\nshould  forever be not transferable but remain  in\r\n\r\nthis  closed service, then so be it.  We  have  no\r\n\r\nobjection whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is it not possible\r\n\r\nfor  the Prime Minister, together with the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister,  to  devise a solution to this  problem?\r\n\r\nHaving  listened to the Prime Minister and to  the\r\n\r\nproblem,  it seems to me that there is a  possible\r\n\r\nsolution  which  I would like to put  to  him.  In\r\n\r\nseeking  to  find a solution to the  problem,  one\r\n\r\nmust  try  to put one's finger on the difficulties\r\n\r\nof  a situation such as this. As I understand  the\r\n\r\nposition,  normally a civil servant,  wherever  he\r\n\r\nmay  work  comes under the control of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance who is the head of the civil service.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Clerk has statutory protection by the\r\n\r\nConstitution, that protection might not exist  for\r\n\r\na  long time. Mr Speaker, Sir, so long as you are\r\n\r\nthe Speaker I dare say the problem does not arise.\r\n\r\nBut when the next elected Assembly meets, it could\r\n\r\nwell  be, Mr Speaker, Sir, that you might not  be\r\n\r\nthe   Speaker   of   that   Assembly.   In   those\r\n\r\ncircumstances, naturally the majority Party  would\r\n\r\nin  the  normal course of events appoint a Speaker\r\n\r\nfrom  their  side of the House. That is  the  time\r\n\r\nwhen  the trouble begins. At the moment, by virtue\r\n\r\nof  the fact that you are the Speaker and that you\r\n\r\nare,  I hope, a non-Party - which I am sure you  are\r\n\r\nnot, - [Laughter] - which I am sure you are -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> You have to be quite sure!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> - The position is quite clear. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  as the Clerk and members  of  your\r\n\r\nstaff  cannot be transferred without your consent,\r\n\r\ntheir protection lies in the fact that you are the\r\n\r\nSpeaker and that you are not a Party man. But when\r\n\r\nyou  cease to be the Speaker and when a Party  man\r\n\r\nbecomes the Speaker, then, in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabsence of tradition in these matters, there is  a\r\n\r\ndistinct  possibility  that the  Government  might\r\n\r\nseek    to   influence   the   Speaker   in    the\r\n\r\ntransferability  of  the Clerk  or  in  his  being\r\n\r\nallowed  to  remain in his post.  If  some  system\r\n\r\ncould  be  devised whereby the Clerk  and  certain\r\n\r\nspecified officers of the Assembly staff could not\r\n\r\nbe  transferred without the consent of a Committee\r\n\r\nof  the House, then possibly that problem might be\r\n\r\nsolved.  Again, in the event of the Clerk  falling\r\n\r\ndown  on his duties and, therefore, should  either\r\n\r\nbe transferred or dispensed with, that again could\r\n\r\nbe left in the hands of the Committee of the House\r\n\r\nand certain devices could be worked out whereby  a\r\n\r\ncertain  majority  would be  required  before  the\r\n\r\ndecision  of that Committee could be given  effect\r\n\r\nto.  So,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, this  is  a  possible\r\n\r\nsolution  which will keep alive the  routes  along\r\n\r\nwhich   recruitment  to  the  Assembly  could   be\r\n\r\npreserved  and  promotion outside  Assembly  House\r\n\r\ncould   also  be  preserved.  The  point  of   the\r\n\r\ndiscussion,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, is  this - that  the\r\n\r\nClerk  and  his  assistants are  servants  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.  The Assembly consists not only  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  but  also of the  Opposition.  If  the\r\n\r\nClerk  is  to discharge his functions efficiently,\r\n\r\nhe  might  sometimes have to discharge them  quite\r\n\r\nfearlessly, and in so doing he might tread on  the\r\n\r\ncorns  of certain Government Members; and  Members\r\n\r\nbeing human, they might try to take it out of him.\r\n\r\nIn  a  democratic  system, Sir, one  must  try  to\r\n\r\ndevise  ways  and means, a system of balances,  as\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister once said, whereby everybody's\r\n\r\ninterests  could be protected. As the position  of\r\n\r\nthe  Clerk  of the Assembly and his assistants  is\r\n\r\nvital   in   the   traditions  of   a   democratic\r\n\r\ngovernment,  I  think one should devise  a  system\r\n\r\nwhereby   the  Clerk  and  his  assistants   could\r\n\r\nfearlessly carry out their duties without  looking\r\n\r\nover  their  shoulders all the time.  I  put  this\r\n\r\nforward  to  the  Prime  Minister  as  a  possible\r\n\r\nsolution, and we on the Opposition, Sir, would  be\r\n\r\nvery  grateful  if the Prime Minister  would  give\r\n\r\nthis his consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think the healthy approach\r\n\r\nto our problems is a practical one. This is not to\r\n\r\nsay  that  I am in any way disputing the principle\r\n\r\nwhich  you have tried to implement from  the  very\r\n\r\nbeginning,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, particularly  after\r\n\r\nyour  sojourn  with the Speaker of  the  House  of\r\n\r\nCommons,   that   you  should  have   a   separate\r\n\r\nestablishment  in this Assembly. But  we  have  to\r\n\r\nface  certain practical problems. As I have  said,\r\n\r\nif  all  the present Assembly staff drawn  largely\r\n\r\nfrom   the   more  competent  and  above   average\r\n\r\nGovernment servants say that they wish to stay  in\r\n\r\nthe Assembly, so be it. The problem is not that we\r\n\r\nwant  to  transfer  the Clerk  out.  I  think  one\r\n\r\nresigned;  another man then became  Clerk  and  he\r\n\r\nsubsequently   moved   up  to   become   Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary.  If the others say that  they  want  to\r\n\r\nstay  put, we have no objection whatsoever.  As  I\r\n\r\nhave  said, we are prepared to allow the Clerk  of\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly  and his assistants to remain  where\r\n\r\nthey  are  in  their  posts,  where  they  develop\r\n\r\ncertain  expertise.  They  cannot  develop  skills\r\n\r\nwhich  would  be  of  much  value  in  some  other\r\n\r\nMinistry.  But  if  you wish to  recruit  on  your\r\n\r\nown - your  stenographers, your personal  assistants\r\n\r\nand  your other clerical assistants - then I suggest\r\n\r\nyou  give  this matter further consideration,  not\r\n\r\nbecause  you  cannot recruit  them,  since  it  is\r\n\r\nlikely  that  you  can do better  by  tapping  the\r\n\r\ngovernment services where there are other  avenues\r\n\r\nfor  promotion,  from  clerks  to  higher  clerks,\r\n\r\nExecutive Officers, Higher Executive Officers  and\r\n\r\nso  on. The point that the Member for Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nhas   asked  me  to  consider  has  already   been\r\n\r\nconsidered. As far as the Clerk is concerned,  and\r\n\r\nI  have  also  included the Serjeant at  Arms  and\r\n\r\nother  specialised officers, I  think  they  could\r\n\r\nwell  be in a closed service. But the question  is\r\n\r\nwhether  you  should have a separate establishment\r\n\r\nas  apart from these specialised officers. That is\r\n\r\na  matter  which I think the Member for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nknew  full  well. It was debated  and  he  decided\r\n\r\nagainst it, not against\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  interests of the Assembly but because we felt\r\n\r\nthat  it would militate against the efficiency  of\r\n\r\nthe staff of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, in this matter, I speak perhaps\r\n\r\nfrom  a  selfish point of view as a Member of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition. As a Member of the Opposition, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to see a Clerk, whose terms of service\r\n\r\nare  such that he could be expected to advise  any\r\n\r\nOpposition  Member  quite fearlessly  and  without\r\n\r\nbeing afraid of the consequences of the advice  he\r\n\r\nmay  tender. At the same time, Sir, I do not  wish\r\n\r\nto  see  that  proper  avenues  of  promotion  are\r\n\r\nblocked   either  from  outside  or   inside   the\r\n\r\nAssembly.  As  the  Legislature  is  an  important\r\n\r\nadjunct of the government of the country,  and  as\r\n\r\nthe  Clerk  is  an important person in  that  very\r\n\r\nimportant  adjunct of the country,  could  we  not\r\n\r\ndevise  some  system  whereby  we  could  make  it\r\n\r\npossible for the Clerk, while he is Clerk  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly,  to  carry out his functions  fearlessly\r\n\r\nand without troubling himself as to whether he  is\r\n\r\ngoing to be transferred outside this Assembly;  or\r\n\r\nworse still, severely dealt with by some difficult\r\n\r\nMinister?   I  am  not  talking  of  the   present\r\n\r\nGovernment, Sir. So long as the present Government\r\n\r\nis  in power, the Clerk is protected, because  you\r\n\r\nare  there,  Sir. But when this present Government\r\n\r\ngoes  and some other government comes in, it could\r\n\r\nwell be that they might not be quite so reasonable\r\n\r\nas this Government and -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye): It could be yours!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It could be ours. I think, Sir, it is\r\n\r\nimportant  that  just as you  are  an  independent\r\n\r\nmember,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  and  you  have   the\r\n\r\nprotection of the Constitution in regard  to  your\r\n\r\nterm of office here, so, in a similar way, I think\r\n\r\nthis Clerk, and all future Clerks, should also  be\r\n\r\ngiven  that protection. With a little goodwill  on\r\n\r\nboth sides, surely it is not beyond the ability of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance, as head of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice, to devise some system whereby the Clerk's\r\n\r\nservice would be protected, as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwell as give some assurance to the other important\r\n\r\nofficials of this Assembly so that their interests\r\n\r\ntoo  will be protected and they could give  advice\r\n\r\nto all Members of the House fearlessly and as they\r\n\r\nthink fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the issue really does\r\n\r\nnot  arise  because  the Clerk  is  already  in  a\r\n\r\nprotected  position, according to section  46  (5)\r\n\r\nand  (6) of the Constitution. All he has to do  is\r\n\r\nto  indicate to the Minister for Finance  that  he\r\n\r\nprefers  to remain in the closed Assembly  service\r\n\r\nand  it shall be so done. But I think it may  well\r\n\r\nbe that there are other considerations which might\r\n\r\nbear  not on the Minister for Finance but  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment servants in the Assembly who  may  wish\r\n\r\nnot   to   seal   altogether  their   chances   of\r\n\r\nadvancement in the service by moving  out  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.  Under section 46 (5)  and  (6)  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution, the Clerk can exercise that right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> With due respect to the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,   Sir,   I   think   he   has    perhaps\r\n\r\nmisunderstood  the point. I am not  worried  about\r\n\r\nthe  present  Clerk. It is not  the  Clerk  as  an\r\n\r\nindividual  who worries me. I am thinking  of  any\r\n\r\nparticular Clerk who serves the Assembly  and  who\r\n\r\nshould be placed in a position whereby his removal\r\n\r\nfrom  the Assembly, or his dismissal from his post\r\n\r\nas  Clerk,  would  be  left  in  the  hands  of  a\r\n\r\nCommittee  of  this  House  composed  of   certain\r\n\r\nindividuals   from   the   Government   and    the\r\n\r\nOpposition, and his dismissal would depend on  how\r\n\r\nthat  Committee votes. Whereas if the other clerks\r\n\r\nremain  as  government servants  and  continue  to\r\n\r\nremain as government servants, they can opt to  be\r\n\r\ntransferred and can come into the Assembly as  and\r\n\r\nhow  they wish. All I ask the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nand  the Prime Minister to consider is whether  it\r\n\r\nwould  not be possible to devise a system  whereby\r\n\r\nthe  transfer  of the Clerk from the  Assembly - not\r\n\r\nthe   present   Clerk,  but  any  Clerk - would   be\r\n\r\ndetermined  by  a  particular Committee,  and  his\r\n\r\ndismissal also would be determined by a particular\r\n\r\nCommittee  and  not  according  to  normal   civil\r\n\r\nservice regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I must make a final\r\n\r\neffort   to   clear  the  air.  I  am   sure   the\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  is  a genuine  one.  What  I  am\r\n\r\nsaying is that we have already agreed with you  in\r\n\r\nprinciple,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that the  Clerk  and\r\n\r\nhis  assistants  are specialised  men  who  should\r\n\r\nacquire   expertise   in  Standing   Orders,   the\r\n\r\nprocedures  of  debate, and  all  the  intricacies\r\n\r\nwhich  a good Speaker insists upon, and that  they\r\n\r\ncan   be  specialised  jobs - as  employees  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  and not as government servants.  We  are\r\n\r\nprepared to allow the present incumbents  who  are\r\n\r\ngovernment  servants  to switch  over  from  being\r\n\r\ngovernment  servants to servants of the  Assembly.\r\n\r\nWe have offered that, not only for this particular\r\n\r\nClerk,  but for all the Clerks and for  all  time.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage of having to carry on an argument\r\n\r\nby proxy, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that we, are unable\r\n\r\nto  come to grips with the issue. The issue  is  a\r\n\r\nseparate establishment, with a House Committee  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of the whole of the staff of the Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe  point  I have made on behalf of the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance is that if they do not opt out of the\r\n\r\ngovernment  service, if they  still  stay  in  the\r\n\r\ngovernment service and they want their avenues for\r\n\r\npromotion - and you have conceded, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  they should be given these avenues,  because\r\n\r\nyou  would  not otherwise be able to recruit  good\r\n\r\nmen - then  they  cannot  be outside  the  rules  of\r\n\r\ndiscipline which bind all the other competitors in\r\n\r\nthe  same service with them.

In some Ministries  there\r\n\r\nare  other secretaries to help the Ministers  with\r\n\r\ntheir  work.

That\r\n\r\nis,  the Malay-speaking, the Chinese-speaking, the\r\n\r\nEnglish-speaking and the Tamil-speaking population\r\n\r\nI sympathise with the Prime Minister, Sir, and his\r\n\r\nGovernment  in their difficult task of  having  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  requirements of a multilingual,\r\n\r\nmulti-racial and multi-cultural society. I will even  go\r\n\r\nso  far,  Sir, as to agree with what  he  said  in\r\n\r\nHansard, Vol. 11, No. 9, col. 545:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is the whole business of a government to\r\n\r\ngovern in such a way that at the end of its  term\r\n\r\nof  office,  the people say, \"Yes, we shall  have\r\n\r\nmore of it.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>However, Sir, a lot depends on the incentives that\r\n\r\nstimulate   the  people  to  say  this.   If   the\r\n\r\nGovernment governs so well that the people benefit\r\n\r\nand  prosper,  it is natural that they  will  say,\r\n\r\n\"Yes,  we want more of it.\" But there may be other\r\n\r\nfactors  that cause people to make this  decision.\r\n\r\nFor   example,   (i)   fear   of   reprisals   and\r\n\r\nvictimisation;  (ii) they might have  been  misled\r\n\r\ninto  seeing things through rose-coloured glasses,\r\n\r\nor (iii) a funny mirror might have been put before\r\n\r\nthem, a mirror which contorts and distorts images.\r\n\r\nThese  are, of course, undesirable. If the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment   intends  to  win  the  elections   by\r\n\r\ngoverning  so  well that people will  benefit  and\r\n\r\nprosper  by  it, then it is a straightforward  job\r\n\r\nthat the Permanent Secretaries can carry out. I am\r\n\r\nsorry,  but  I  have to disagree  with  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister when he said that if the presentation and\r\n\r\nimplementation of policies were left  entirely  to\r\n\r\nthe  Civil Service, an unnecessary faux  pas  will\r\n\r\nfail  their  way. I am quite sure, Sir,  that  our\r\n\r\ncivil   servants  are  men  of  intelligence   and\r\n\r\nability,  and  have  sufficient  integrity  to  he\r\n\r\nentrusted  with the job of implementing Government\r\n\r\npolicies,  and  can be expected to implement  them\r\n\r\nefficiently.   But   if   by   implementation   of\r\n\r\nGovernment  policies is meant the  propagation  of\r\n\r\nP.A.P. propaganda,  then  I   admit   Government\r\n\r\nservants  will  not be capable of doing  it.  But,\r\n\r\nSir,  are Government servants not bound by General\r\n\r\nOrders not to take an active part in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparty  politics? Or are they exempted from General\r\n\r\nOrders  if  they happen to support a  party  which\r\n\r\nhappens  to  be  in  power? I can  appreciate  the\r\n\r\npoint,  Sir, that if the civil servant  is  not  a\r\n\r\nmember  of the P.A.P. then he will not be able  to\r\n\r\nfollow  the trend of thought that lies behind  the\r\n\r\npolicies  of the Government. But may I  ask,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhat better person is there than the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary who is himself a leading member  of  the\r\n\r\nParty, who knows all about the Party policies, who\r\n\r\nis  so  well  versed  with what  goes  on  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry, and, most important of all, in whom  the\r\n\r\nvoters  have shown confidence and have  chosen  to\r\n\r\nrepresent  them?  Should not such  a  person,  who\r\n\r\ncarries  the  confidence of  the  voters,  be  the\r\n\r\nclosest confidant of the Minister? Is there anyone\r\n\r\nwho  has  proved to the world better than  he  has\r\n\r\nthat he understands the masses, and is able to get\r\n\r\nhis  message across to them so convincingly as  to\r\n\r\nsecure  their confidence in him? If there are  any\r\n\r\npeople  who have shown to the world that they  are\r\n\r\nable to do that, it is the 51 Assemblymen who  are\r\n\r\nsitting  in this Chamber today. They have  managed\r\n\r\nto  convince the public and they have  managed  to\r\n\r\nsecure  the  confidence of the  public.  And  that\r\n\r\nincludes  the  Parliamentary Secretaries  and  the\r\n\r\nBack  Benchers  of the Government too.  So  I  can\r\n\r\nthink of no people who are better qualified to get\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry's messages and intentions across  to\r\n\r\nthe masses better than the Assemblymen themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P A.P. Ministers may be the personal friends\r\n\r\nof  the Political Secretaries, and understand them\r\n\r\nwell  enough to have confidence in them. But where\r\n\r\nthe  electorate is concerned, they have  indicated\r\n\r\ntheir  trust in and their choice of the 51 Members\r\n\r\nsitting  in this Chamber. And to brush  aside  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretaries and the  Back  Benchers\r\n\r\nand put in others as liaison personnel between the\r\n\r\nGovernment   and  the  people  is  tantamount   to\r\n\r\nignoring  public  feeling and  the  right  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  to  choose their representatives,  because\r\n\r\nthis is exactly what the Political Secretaries are\r\n\r\nin effect, Sir. They reflect public opinion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the Government so that Government could  frame\r\n\r\ntheir  policies  to  meet  the  requirements,  the\r\n\r\nopinions  and the feelings of the people.  Do  the\r\n\r\npublic riot have the right to choose those persons\r\n\r\nwhom  they  think  can understand  - them  best  to\r\n\r\nrepresent  their views and reflect their opinions?\r\n\r\nMoreover,  Sir, - I stand corrected, but I  believe\r\n\r\nit  was mentioned in this Chamber that many of the\r\n\r\nBack  Benchers  of  the Government  resigned  from\r\n\r\ntheir jobs and went into Government departments to\r\n\r\nserve  the Government and the people. If  this  is\r\n\r\nthe  case,  Sir,  who  would more  deserve  to  be\r\n\r\nrewarded  with the $1,100 monthly salary  that  is\r\n\r\npaid  to  the  Political Secretary than  the  Back\r\n\r\nBenchers  themselves who have resigned from  their\r\n\r\njobs to serve the Government and the public?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

In September 1959,  it\r\n\r\nwas  not  deemed  that the Deputy  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nneeded a Political Secretary. Even if it had  been\r\n\r\nfelt that he needed one, his need was not regarded\r\n\r\nas  being  as  urgent as that of the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour and Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This need of a Political Secretary in the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour and Law would have  continued\r\n\r\nhad   not  Mr  Fong  Swee  Suan  criticized   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy. His criticism of  Government\r\n\r\npolicy  made the Ministry of Labour and Law  decde\r\n\r\nthat  it  no  longer needed a Political Secretary,\r\n\r\nand  suddenly  made it necessary  for  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's Ministry to need one. The public\r\n\r\ncannot  see the logic in this sequence of  events,\r\n\r\nnor can they understand the principle of cause and\r\n\r\neffect  in  this. The conclusion they  draw,  Sir,\r\n\r\n- and  we  agree with them - is that the creation  of\r\n\r\nthe  posts  of Political Secretaries  is  nothing,\r\n\r\nbut,  to  borrow the Prime Minister's  expression,\r\n\r\n\"distributing largesse among the victors\". It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  denied before, Sir, and I know  it  will  be\r\n\r\ndenied again today.

If we had  wished\r\n\r\nto  give jobs away, we would have filled the whole\r\n\r\nlot  of  them,  regardless of their worth  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my position, Sir, as the Minister in charge\r\n\r\nnot  just  of  the  Government Ministries  but  of\r\n\r\nstatutory corporations like the Singapore  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard, the City Council, if it were largesse  that\r\n\r\nI  wanted to distribute, it could be done quietly,\r\n\r\nwithout the slightest fuss and bother. We put this\r\n\r\non the record because this is the proper way to do\r\n\r\nit.  If  the  Member  for  Mountbatten's  feminine\r\n\r\ninstincts  make her repeat this year  after  year,\r\n\r\nthen  I expect, Sir, at the end of it all we  will\r\n\r\nhave  to get together and form an association  for\r\n\r\nthe  rights of men! One of the rights  is  not  to\r\n\r\nhear  the  same argument, which has been answered,\r\n\r\nrepeated  again and again as if it were  something\r\n\r\nfresh out of the bag. We have had all this before.\r\n\r\nAll  I  need  add is to say perhaps  we  might  be\r\n\r\nspared  the same repetition when we come  to  the\r\n\r\nother  Political Secretaries.

If\r\n\r\nhe had gone out and spoken to people outside about\r\n\r\nthis matter, he would have found that they are all\r\n\r\npuzzled  as to how the Deputy Prime Minister,  who\r\n\r\nnever  had or needed a Political Secretary before,\r\n\r\nsuddenly  needed  one when the occasion  arose  to\r\n\r\nsuit the transfer. The Political Secretary to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Labour and Law, Mr Fong  Swee  Suan,\r\n\r\nattacked  Government policy, and all of  a  sudden\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  could  do  without   a   Political\r\n\r\nSecretary. It is the people who are puzzled, and I\r\n\r\nseek  elucidation and clarification so  that  they\r\n\r\nwill  not be puzzled any more about it; and  I  do\r\n\r\nnot think the Hon. the Prime Minister has given us\r\n\r\nthat information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Mountbatten had confined  herself\r\n\r\nto  that, then we would all have listened  to  her\r\n\r\nwith  avidity, because that was a valid point.  It\r\n\r\nis  not  because the Minister for Labour  and  Law\r\n\r\ndoes not require a Political Secretary. The Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  had always required  a  Political\r\n\r\nSecretary,  but  he had not been able  to  find  a\r\n\r\nsuitable one. Why was it necessary to transfer Mr\r\n\r\nFong  Swee Suan there? Because he had to be  moved\r\n\r\nout  of  the  Ministry of Labour and Law,  and  at\r\n\r\nonce.  There  are  ways  of doing  things,  either\r\n\r\npolitely or impolitely. We did it the polite  way.\r\n\r\nWe  transferred him to the Deputy Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nMinistry in order that his expressed views,  which\r\n\r\ndiffered  from those of the Ministry's on  certain\r\n\r\nlabour matters, should not be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallowed  to influence the workings of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Labour and Law of influence the unions in that\r\n\r\nrespect.

Sir,  I  did,\r\n\r\nand  still  do, agree as I said last year,  or  in\r\n\r\nfact  this  year, on the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's\r\n\r\nSpeech,  that there are Political Secretaries  and\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretaries.  I  see  that  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has found it fit to illustrate his  point\r\n\r\nwith  his  own Political Secretary who, we  admit,\r\n\r\nhas done good work for him. But let us examine the\r\n\r\nother Political Secretaries on the basis that they\r\n\r\nare  men who, as a result of their background, are\r\n\r\nskilled  in  the performance of certain  functions\r\n\r\nfor the Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the Political Secretary in the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance. He is never there. What  kind\r\n\r\nof  function does he perform for the Minister? You\r\n\r\nwill  find him in the Ministry of Labour and  Law.\r\n\r\nWhat  kind  of a background has he, other  than  a\r\n\r\ntrade union background, to advise a man who  is  a\r\n\r\nknown  economist not only here but in other  parts\r\n\r\nof  the world, to advise him when he is not there?\r\n\r\nA  Political Secretary to advise the Minister from\r\n\r\nwhere? From the back seat or the front seat? He is\r\n\r\nnot  even in the Ministry of Finance, and  is  yet\r\n\r\npaid  $1,100 a month. I would not like  to  accuse\r\n\r\nthat  it is a distribution or largesse. [Laughter]\r\n\r\nNo, it is not. But I would like to say this. It is\r\n\r\nnothing  but  political manoeuvring. You  want  to\r\n\r\ngive  a  job  to  a man who has been  the  Party's\r\n\r\ncomrade. Therefore, a job must be given to him. So\r\n\r\nyou  create  a job for the man to contain  him.  I\r\n\r\nwill  not  call it largesse. To contain  him -  but\r\n\r\nhave  we  contained him? He is never seen  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Finance. And then to get a  Political\r\n\r\nSecretary to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvise  the  Minister when they will not  look  at\r\n\r\neach  other face to face! What kind of advice  can\r\n\r\nthere  be?  No,  it  is  not  a  distribution   of\r\n\r\nlargesse.  It is something else more  sinister.  I\r\n\r\nwould not like to touch on the Political Secretary\r\n\r\nin  the Ministry of Labour and Law, because I will\r\n\r\nhave  something to say about the subject  when  it\r\n\r\ncomes  up.  But  to  suggest  that  all  Political\r\n\r\nSecretaries are there because they are  performing\r\n\r\nuseful  functions  for the Ministers  is  just  an\r\n\r\nuntruth. There are some Political Secretaries  who\r\n\r\nhave done good work. I will admit it here and  now\r\n\r\nthat the Political Secretary to the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhas  done a good job. But I cannot say for certain\r\n\r\nabout  the other Political Secretaries. We created\r\n\r\na  Political  Secretary for  every  Ministry  last\r\n\r\nyear, except the Deputy Prime Minister's Ministry,\r\n\r\nand  then  we  suddenly created one this  year  to\r\n\r\ncontain  someone else.

He\r\n\r\nand  I  share one advantage in that he knows  what\r\n\r\nthe  background was about, and so do I.

If\r\n\r\nit  was  done  as a tactical manoeuvre  for  other\r\n\r\npurposes,  then  I say that is a matter  which  is\r\n\r\nbound  to lead to further developments at a  later\r\n\r\nstage.  What I would like to say is this. What  is\r\n\r\nsaid  is  sometimes less important  than  what  is\r\n\r\nunsaid, and we have a lot of unsaid things on this\r\n\r\nsubject  because the matter has not  yet  come  to\r\n\r\nfinality.   The  declaration  stands - a   clear-cut\r\n\r\ndeclaration on the democratic aims and  objectives\r\n\r\nof   a  non-Communist,  socialist  Party  and  its\r\n\r\nmethods.  There  was  a minor disagreement  as  to\r\n\r\ncertain policies on the trade unions which made it\r\n\r\nnecessary  for the Political Secretary,  Mr  Fong\r\n\r\nSwee  Suan,  to  be removed from the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour. I think I need not say more, least of  all\r\n\r\nto the Member for Cairnhill.

There are two  arguments  to\r\n\r\nthis.  If  you  appoint someone there  of  a  high\r\n\r\ncalibre, he would substitute the personal  contact\r\n\r\nwhich  would  normally have  taken  place  between\r\n\r\nMinisters.   And,  therefore,  it  might   be   of\r\n\r\nadvantage  not  to  set  up  more  than  really  a\r\n\r\nclearing  house  for  the  quick  passing  on   of\r\n\r\ninformation  of what we intend to do and  of  what\r\n\r\nthey   intend   to  do.  We  often   have   little\r\n\r\ndifficulties  like  this:  sometimes  rumour,  and\r\n\r\nsometimes  more  than  rumour,  spreads  that  the\r\n\r\nimportation  of,  for  instance,  pigs  is  to  be\r\n\r\nprohibited into the Federation; or that  there  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  a higher duty on eggs. The  present\r\n\r\narrangement  is so cumbrous that the Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational Development has to take it up. Finally it\r\n\r\ncomes to me, and I have to write to my counterpart\r\n\r\nin  the Federation. Then it goes back down to  the\r\n\r\nofficials, and finally it turns out that they have\r\n\r\nno intention for the time being of either stopping\r\n\r\npigs  or putting up the tax on eggs. If we have  a\r\n\r\nquick clearing-house for information, we hope that\r\n\r\na lot of this kind of difficulties\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould  be overcome. I am fully alive to the danger\r\n\r\nthat if you have a high-powered representative, he\r\n\r\nwould   supplant  the  personal  contact   between\r\n\r\nMinisters,  which  is  absolutely  fundamental.  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  must go about this thing gradually  and\r\n\r\nslowly - feel our way forward. What we do  not  want\r\n\r\nto  do  is  to  develop any institution  in  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur, be it called a Trade Office or Information\r\n\r\nOffice,  which  will formalise  the  relationship,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  at  present  on  a  very  informal  and\r\n\r\nfriendly  and  sometimes intimate  basis,  between\r\n\r\nMinisters  in  the two territories.  But  I  think\r\n\r\nthere  is a need for someone to be there to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that information is passed quickly  and  the\r\n\r\nlines are kept clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, while the Opposition agrees that\r\n\r\neverything should be done with a view to  bringing\r\n\r\nabout  closer  understanding, closer  relationship\r\n\r\nand  quicker  clearance of  vital  issues  between\r\n\r\nourselves and the Federation, what we on this side\r\n\r\nof  the House, Mr Speaker, are afraid of is  that\r\n\r\nsomething  of  this nature would  rather  tend  to\r\n\r\nemphasise  the separation of the two  territories.\r\n\r\nIt creates a psychological situation which I think\r\n\r\nat the moment would be undesirable. It shows in  a\r\n\r\nconcrete  sort  of  way  that  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation  are separate and distinct territories,\r\n\r\nand  that,  therefore, it is necessary  to  create\r\n\r\nofficial establishments which would be used by the\r\n\r\ntwo  Governments as a clearing-house. On this side\r\n\r\nof  the  House  we rather feel, Mr Speaker,  that\r\n\r\nalthough  we cannot deny that there are  desirable\r\n\r\nfeatures  about  this proposal,  it  would  appear\r\n\r\nthat,  on  balance, and in view of the  fact  that\r\n\r\nthere  seems to be a tendency for us to go further\r\n\r\nand  further away from each other, something  like\r\n\r\nthis would tend to emphasise it rather than bridge\r\n\r\nthe differences. The Hon. the Prime Minister said,\r\n\r\nand the impression I got from his speech was, that\r\n\r\nwe would start in a small way in Kuala Lumpur. But\r\n\r\nthe  nature of the work seems to indicate that  it\r\n\r\nis  not  going  to  - be in  a  small  way.  It  is\r\n\r\ncommitting   the   Finance  Ministry   to   nearly\r\n\r\n$300,000.

Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  Government  has  already  bought\r\n\r\ntheirs  in Singapore, and all their quarters  have\r\n\r\nbeen  taken  up.  Therefore, we are  committed  to\r\n\r\ngetting  a  lease on an extremely high  market  in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur. Whatever it is, we have to  have  a\r\n\r\nsecretariat  for one man - whatever we call  him.  I\r\n\r\nsee a lot in the argument that if we start this we\r\n\r\nmight  finally  wind up in more  formal  and  more\r\n\r\ndistant  relations. It is for that reason that  we\r\n\r\nhave been careful not to call it more than a Trade\r\n\r\nand  Information Office. Perhaps we might even  go\r\n\r\non  a lower note, and just have an office to clear\r\n\r\nthings  for  Ministers  and,  if  necessary,  have\r\n\r\nMinisters  go  up to clear things for  themselves.\r\n\r\nBut  from  our  experience over the last  eighteen\r\n\r\nmonths,  particularly in view of the  difficulties\r\n\r\nabout  channels of communication having to go  out\r\n\r\nfirst to Ministers before the civil servants clear\r\n\r\nit  among  themselves, I think that  will  require\r\n\r\nsome  kind  of office accommodation  on  a  modest\r\n\r\nscale together with residential accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

The other aspect is this.

The\r\n\r\nHouse  has been asked to vote the sum of $215,290.\r\n\r\nIf  we  delete the expenditure to be  incurred  on\r\n\r\ncapital  outlay,  (two  bicycles,  furniture,  two\r\n\r\nmotor vehicles and office equipment and so on), it\r\n\r\nstill leaves a sum of $147,900 to contend with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have here the Estimates of the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya Government for 1961. I notice  that  on\r\n\r\npages  133  and 134, for a total of 22  home-based\r\n\r\nlocally recruited staff, the Federation Government\r\n\r\nhas earmarked a sum of $149,584\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  personal  emoluments,  whereas  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  is budgeting for the sum  of  $106,240\r\n\r\nfor  a  staff  of 11, which means more  than  \r\n\r\ntwo-thirds  the amount for exactly half the number  of\r\n\r\nstaff. Then again the Ambassador of the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya  in Djakarta is being paid a salary  of\r\n\r\n$1,850 per mensem, whereas we are now being  asked\r\n\r\nto  vote the sum of $1,950 for our chief executive\r\n\r\nin   Djakarta.   Although  the   post   of   Trade\r\n\r\nCommissioner calls for a Grade G appointment,  the\r\n\r\nsalary being $1,520 per mensem, for reasons  known\r\n\r\nonly to the Government, the person to be appointed\r\n\r\nwill draw a salary of $1,950 per mensem.

I wonder if the Prime Minister could assure\r\n\r\nthe  House  that  when  the appointments  do  take\r\n\r\nplace,  there  will be a bit of pruning  here  and\r\n\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nestimates for our Indonesian Office have been gone\r\n\r\nthrough  most carefully by the Treasury  and  have\r\n\r\nbeen  finally  agreed to after prolonged  argument\r\n\r\nbetween the Treasury and the Commerce and Industry\r\n\r\nDivision  of  my Ministry. I can assure  you  that\r\n\r\nthere has been no undue extravagance anywhere.  In\r\n\r\nfact, when running overseas establishments, it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  that we maintain certain standards  and\r\n\r\nthat we do not allow the good name of Singapore to\r\n\r\nbe  lowered  by  having  poorly  situated,  poorly\r\n\r\nfurnished   and   poorly  managed  establishments.\r\n\r\nOverseas  establishments are necessarily expensive\r\n\r\nto  run  because of the prestige element involved.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  have  done is to get  the  lowest  rates\r\n\r\napplicable  in  the  overseas  establishments   of\r\n\r\nvarious governments, and this is the final result.\r\n\r\nFor  a  number  of  reasons,  I  do  not  think  a\r\n\r\ncomparison with the Federation establishment would\r\n\r\nbe  fair. Firstly, of course, this being the first\r\n\r\ntime that our establishment is going to be set up,\r\n\r\nwe have to incur pretty heavy capital expenditure.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, you will notice that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  fairly  considerable sum of  $34,000  has  been\r\n\r\nallotted to overseas allowances. I have not before\r\n\r\nme  the Federation Estimates, but I am inclined to\r\n\r\nbelieve that the allowances set out there, are  in\r\n\r\na  sense, only nominal and that they do have other\r\n\r\nallowances  which would be paid out of  a  central\r\n\r\nvote  in  the External Affairs Ministry.  This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  practice which most  governments\r\n\r\nobserve  of  keeping  the  true  amount  of  their\r\n\r\noverseas  allowances and the expenditure on  their\r\n\r\nforeign establishments a State secret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the proposed holder of the office of\r\n\r\nSenior  Trade  and  Cultural  Representative,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  in mind the appointment,  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst instance, of the present Permanent Secretary\r\n\r\nof  the  Commerce  and  Industry  Division  of  my\r\n\r\nMinistry. He has been working on this project  for\r\n\r\na long time and he has excellent contacts with the\r\n\r\nofficials    of    the   Indonesian    Government.\r\n\r\nEventually,  of  course, when we find  a  suitable\r\n\r\nperson  to  replace  him, the post  will  be  held\r\n\r\nsubstantively by a Superscale G officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, in that case, why\r\n\r\ndo we not properly state in the Estimates that the\r\n\r\nSenior Trade and Cultural Representative would  be\r\n\r\ndrawing  a  salary of $1,950 instead  of  what  is\r\n\r\nstated - Grade G [$1,520]?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Sir, I am not suggesting to the\r\n\r\nGovernment that they should blindly follow what is\r\n\r\ntaking  place  in the Federation or in  any  other\r\n\r\npart  of the world.

It has nothing to do with having more ties\r\n\r\nwith the United Kingdom Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, a number of services were performed\r\n\r\nby  the  Crown  Agents for a  fee.  This  included\r\n\r\nhandling  of  payments of salaries to officers  on\r\n\r\nleave, pensions, allowances to our students in the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom, passages to and fro and so forth.\r\n\r\nA  fee  of  one per cent was charged by the  Crown\r\n\r\nAgents,  and  this  worked  out  to  approximately\r\n\r\n$42,000 a year. After due examination of the  work\r\n\r\ninvolved,  we have decided that it is cheaper  and\r\n\r\nmore  efficient if we perform that work ourselves.\r\n\r\nAccordingly,  this new post is created  to  enable\r\n\r\nnot only the work of payments, booking of passages\r\n\r\nand  so on to be done, but better liaison with our\r\n\r\nstudents in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the second question is this-the\r\n\r\npresent  holder of the post is the former  officer\r\n\r\nin  the  Commerce  and  Industry  Division  of  my\r\n\r\nMinistry, Mr G.

I\r\n\r\nwould  also  like to bring to the  notice  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment certain matters which have been told to\r\n\r\nme   in  my  Southern  Islands.  The  ketuas   and\r\n\r\npenghulus  are  not happy with their  duties  and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.  It  was the  intention  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government  that a District  and  Island\r\n\r\nCouncil    was    to    be   formed,    comprising\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the various Islands, to go into\r\n\r\nmatters affecting the progress of the people.  But\r\n\r\nunder  the present Government, this plan  was  not\r\n\r\nproceeded  with.  I  do not deny  that  many  good\r\n\r\nmeasures  have been introduced by the  Government.\r\n\r\nBut what I want to bring up is that there are some\r\n\r\npenghulus   who  have  their  own  representatives\r\n\r\nassisting them in some of the smaller areas. These\r\n\r\npeople  do  not  receive any allowance,  it  would\r\n\r\nappear\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  their  duties and responsibilities  are  the\r\n\r\nsame as those of the ketuas. From my experience, I\r\n\r\nknow  that  their duties and responsibilities  are\r\n\r\nheavy,  as they have to look after the welfare  of\r\n\r\nthe  people. It seems to me that the powers of the\r\n\r\npenghulus  would  tend to retard  progress.  Their\r\n\r\npowers  are such that it would appear they do  not\r\n\r\nlike  people  to  have  direct  contact  with  the\r\n\r\ndepartments  of  the Government. The  people  must\r\n\r\nchannel any matter through the penghulus.  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat this should not be so and that the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  should  be aware of  the  position.  To\r\n\r\navoid  all misunderstanding, I feel that elections\r\n\r\nshould be held to choose the penghulus. The system\r\n\r\nof  handling  down the posts to the  children  and\r\n\r\ngrandchildren  of the penghulus  should  not  hold\r\n\r\ngood  nowadays. In the Federation of  Malaya,  the\r\n\r\npenghulus are elected in their respective areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nunable  to  give  any  considered  reply  to   the\r\n\r\nproposal  by the Member for the Southern  Islands.\r\n\r\nThis  is a new one which has just been put on  the\r\n\r\nFloor and there may be something in it I would not\r\n\r\nlike  to commit the Government as to whether  this\r\n\r\nwould  be an innovation worth trying. What we  are\r\n\r\ndoing is to use the existing system in which every\r\n\r\ncontact  between the islanders and the  Government\r\n\r\nis  maintained by penghulus appointed partly by us\r\n\r\nand partly by authority, by the fact that they are\r\n\r\naccepted  by  the  people  of  the  Islands.   The\r\n\r\nincrease  in the vote is really to meet the  point\r\n\r\nwhich  was  made  by the Member for  the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslands, in that not only does the penghulu do the\r\n\r\nwork  but he has all kinds of helpers, and amongst\r\n\r\nthe  helpers  are  the ketuas.  Before  this,  the\r\n\r\npenghulu  was given $500 per annum and the  ketuas\r\n\r\n$250. Now, in view of the fact that they spend  $2\r\n\r\nor  $3  a  trip  every  time  they  come  down  to\r\n\r\nSingapore, it was thought that a $100 increase for\r\n\r\nthe ketua was justified. Whether we go further and\r\n\r\ngive  an  allowance to the ketua's  assistant  who\r\n\r\nruns for the ketua, that is a matter which we will\r\n\r\nhave to look into very carefully. I would not like\r\n\r\nto commit the Government on this.

By travelling to Singapore, they are forced\r\n\r\nto  be  away from their work. The allowances  they\r\n\r\nget will not, I feel, be sufficient, and this will\r\n\r\nhave  a  more  marked effect if their visits  keep\r\n\r\nthem  away from fishing, especially during a  good\r\n\r\nseason.   But   because  of  the  responsibilities\r\n\r\nentrusted to them by the Government, they have  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out their duties, which will cause them  to\r\n\r\nincur financial loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the election of penghulus, I know of\r\n\r\ntwo  or  three areas where the assistant penghulus\r\n\r\ndo  not  get the co-operation of the residents  in\r\n\r\nthe areas. The election of a penghulu should prove\r\n\r\nthat  the  people there desire to co-operate  with\r\n\r\nhim.  I hope that my suggestion will be considered\r\n\r\nby the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have\r\n\r\nstated,  I  am unable to commit the Government  to\r\n\r\nchanging  the system whereby penghulus  have  been\r\n\r\nappointed.  But  I can assure the Member  for  the\r\n\r\nSouthern Islands that if there is any penghulu  or\r\n\r\nketua who is unsuitable and obviously unacceptable\r\n\r\nto  the islanders - even though he was acceptable or\r\n\r\nthought  to  be acceptable when he was  appointed,\r\n\r\nbut  subsequently  he lost the confidence  of  the\r\n\r\nislanders or lost interest in his job - then changes\r\n\r\ncan  be made. But beyond this statement, I do  not\r\n\r\nthink I can go so far as to say that we would like\r\n\r\nto  do what the islanders want. If they would like\r\n\r\na  certain  person  to  represent  them  and  they\r\n\r\naccepted him as a penghulu, then we would  be  the\r\n\r\nfirst  to  acknowledge him as  the  local  leader,\r\n\r\nbecause  that  would facilitate  the  business  of\r\n\r\ngovernment.

We know  all\r\n\r\nthese problems confronting us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mention some of the actions of the former\r\n\r\nMinister  for National Development with regard  to\r\n\r\nhis  work for the farmers. I think many understand\r\n\r\nwhat  he  did  in the past. I feel that  the  work\r\n\r\nwhich  he did as a Minister was not right. In  the\r\n\r\npast,  he  always  said  that  he  wanted  to   do\r\n\r\nsomething for the rural farmers; for instance, how\r\n\r\nto solve the land problem. Did he do any reform in\r\n\r\nthis  respect when he was the Minister? I  believe\r\n\r\nthe  rural  people are very clear about  this.  In\r\n\r\nthis  connection, I wish to touch on this  problem\r\n\r\nagain because I myself come from the rural area. I\r\n\r\nam  a  representative for the rural area.  I  have\r\n\r\nbeen brought up there. Therefore, I know very well\r\n\r\nthe conditions there. And as such, I can speak for\r\n\r\nthe rural people. Since the P.A.P. Government took\r\n\r\noffice,  the  rural  areas  have  undergone   some\r\n\r\nimprovement. If we look back, we can see that many\r\n\r\nof  the  land problems have been dealt with.  With\r\n\r\nregard to these problems, we will have in future a\r\n\r\nprogramme,  by way of legislation, to rectify  and\r\n\r\nsolve  these  problems  in order  to  protect  the\r\n\r\npeople.  We  will put forward this legislation  in\r\n\r\nthe  near future in this Assembly. These are  some\r\n\r\nof  the  measures we intend to adopt in  order  to\r\n\r\nprotect the rural people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to land disputes, there has been\r\n\r\nsome  improvement. For instance,  there  has  been\r\n\r\nimprovement made to roads and other things. If the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members wish to talk about  the  rural\r\n\r\nand  land  problems, they can go with  me  to  the\r\n\r\nrural  area  in  order  to better  understand  the\r\n\r\nactual  conditions  there.  They  should  do  this\r\n\r\nbefore  they  talk about the problems relating  to\r\n\r\nthe  rural  areas.  They  must  not  sit  in  \r\n\r\nair-conditioned  rooms and talk about  the  rural  and\r\n\r\nland   problems.  Their  attitude  towards   these\r\n\r\nproblems   is  n  t  realistic.  We   must   first\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  issue before we  talk  about  it.\r\n\r\nLooking  at things superficially is not practical.\r\n\r\nWithout  understanding the  real  facts  and  only\r\n\r\ntalking  of the issues superficially in  order  to\r\n\r\ngain the praise of s me people will not solve  the\r\n\r\nproblem. This may be just an opportunistic  tactic\r\n\r\nin  order to gain the support of the people.

But  within\r\n\r\nthose  limitations, I tried to do  something.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, just to mention Jurong alone,  we  tried\r\n\r\nto complete the building of a railroad and others,\r\n\r\nand we built 200 standpipes within the short space\r\n\r\nof four months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Are we talking about -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir.\r\n\r\nAre we talking about Land and District Offices for\r\n\r\nwhich  I  am responsible, or are we talking  about\r\n\r\nthe   ex-Minister   for   National   Development's\r\n\r\nproclivities  to create standpipes  on  paper  for\r\n\r\nwhich I am not responsible?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is my difficulty, of course,\r\n\r\nto  find  out where the responsibility starts  and\r\n\r\nwhere  it  ends.

It  had\r\n\r\nnothing  to  do  with the translator  but  it  was\r\n\r\nbecause  of simultaneous translation.  I  am  only\r\n\r\nreplying  to  some  of the points  raised  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Jurong. I am not digressing on to  new\r\n\r\ngrounds. What I wish to say is this. Work  started\r\n\r\nin  July 1959 in the Southern Islands. A plan  was\r\n\r\ndrafted  and it was completed. Since then no  more\r\n\r\nwas  done.  A  plan to revise the laws  concerning\r\n\r\nland  reform  was  drafted but it  was  torpedoed.\r\n\r\nMeasures were taken to build roads and other steps\r\n\r\nwere taken to bring about land reform, but most of\r\n\r\nthem  were torpedoed. But earlier I have tried  to\r\n\r\nbring  up  these points again without touching  on\r\n\r\nwhat  had  happened,  hoping that  the  Government\r\n\r\nwould  give  these three matters due consideration\r\n\r\nwithout touching on personalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe revision of the Master Plan. I do not know how\r\n\r\nthe logic runs, but anyway, there it is for what\r\n\r\nit is worth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As a new approach to this,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, in all seriousness, we must now\r\n\r\nlook  at the problem that has been posed, that  an\r\n\r\nearlier  revision of the Master Plan is absolutely\r\n\r\nbasic  and fundamental. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  have\r\n\r\njust  explained to the Member for Farrer Park  why\r\n\r\nan earlier revision was impossible because all the\r\n\r\nexpatriate master planners were chased out of  the\r\n\r\nPlanning  Department and we have had to  wait  for\r\n\r\nthe  one local chap to come back. He has just come\r\n\r\nback.  No doubt the valiant efforts of the  former\r\n\r\nMinister  for  National Development  assisted  the\r\n\r\nfarmers in that he held up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have 224 square miles of land. There is a\r\n\r\ndispute  as  to  whether it  is 219  or  224.  Some\r\n\r\nauthorities  have it as 224 and  some  as  219.  I\r\n\r\nfound  out  from the Land Office not so long  ago,\r\n\r\nwhen  I had to clarify just how much we had,  that\r\n\r\nit  depends  upon whether you include those  parts\r\n\r\nwhich  are covered by tidal waters. If you exclude\r\n\r\nthose parts that are covered by tidal waters, then\r\n\r\nyou  drop to 219. But if you say you can dam  them\r\n\r\nand  make them into fish and prawn ponds, then  it\r\n\r\nbecomes   224.   Then   we   have   the   military\r\n\r\nestablishments and so on taking one third  of  the\r\n\r\narable land. We are dead against having a military\r\n\r\nbase. We do not want it here any more than anybody\r\n\r\nelse. But we also know that there are no less than\r\n\r\n30,000  civilian  employees of  the  military.  So\r\n\r\nthere  are  two propaganda angles on this.  First,\r\n\r\nout  with  the  military base and  up  with  local\r\n\r\nnationalism,  which is necessary  and  inevitable.\r\n\r\nMore  land  for the farmers and out with  military\r\n\r\ninstallations  occupying  land.  We  are  also  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of  that. But, of course, the  Member  for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  has  forgotten that  there  are  30,000\r\n\r\nfamilies  of  civilian employees.  So  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npolicy   is   as   we   have  enunciated   it   in\r\n\r\nSembawang-that  we  shall  do  it  in   a   phased\r\n\r\nprogramme.  Nobody loses his job quicker  than  is\r\n\r\nnecessary,  quicker than before he  finds  another\r\n\r\njob. These things have to be carefully thought out\r\n\r\nIn  the old days, we provided the Member for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim  with  the careful thinking, the  Master  Plan\r\n\r\nbefore he went and poured it out. But if you start\r\n\r\nshooting Les without having decided where one line\r\n\r\nis going to conflict with the other, you will soon\r\n\r\ncome  a cropper. Let us face these facts. Even  if\r\n\r\nwe  drive all the military bases into the sea,  as\r\n\r\none  day  it  will be done, and we  save  all  the\r\n\r\ncivilian  employees  by  creating  industries  and\r\n\r\ncivilian  dockyards, we will still face a  housing\r\n\r\nand  land  shortage. One of the  problems  of  the\r\n\r\nmaster planners is this, Sir. Already\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  are  having to resist the demands of  industry\r\n\r\nand  industrial  expansion from  eating  into  the\r\n\r\nlimited arable land we have got.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me pose a concrete problem. Toa Payoh - it is\r\n\r\nin  the  town  area - is also fertile farming  area.\r\n\r\nAccording to the master planners, the ideal Master\r\n\r\nPlan  means that Toa Payoh should be part  of  the\r\n\r\nCity belt for high density, not for rural farming.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, we manage to hold the position\r\n\r\nand  say, \" Well, for the foreseeable future  that\r\n\r\nwe  can plan, it shall be farming.\" It is just  to\r\n\r\nhold   the   fort,  because  it  is  serving   the\r\n\r\ncommunity, it is a fertile belt, and the  pressure\r\n\r\nfrom  the  industrial  development  is  not  acute\r\n\r\nenough.  But I think we have to face up  to  this,\r\n\r\nSir. Whatever we do, we face a land shortage,  and\r\n\r\nthe  problem is how to make the best  use  of  the\r\n\r\nlimited   land.  I  shall  be  treating  it   very\r\n\r\nseriously,  and  I  should be greatly  obliged  if\r\n\r\npeople  like  the Member for Hong Lim would,  with\r\n\r\nhis  careful thinking, make a contribution  as  to\r\n\r\nhow  we could make better use of the land we  have\r\n\r\ngot, apart from recovering land from the sea,  and\r\n\r\nfrom  the Army, Navy and Air Force, which we  must\r\n\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about the Southern Islands. I am grateful\r\n\r\nto the Member for having raised this, because as a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the Parliamentary Secretary  answering\r\n\r\nthe   Member  for  the  Southern  Islands  on  his\r\n\r\namendment   about   provision   for   water    and\r\n\r\nelectricity for the Southern Islands, I missed the\r\n\r\nopportunity to explain that the Rural  Board  (for\r\n\r\nwhich  I  am responsible) used to carry a separate\r\n\r\nbudget.  Rural development, Malay settlements  and\r\n\r\nso  on have a clear-cut vote, which you will  see.\r\n\r\nNow,  because of integration, all these votes have\r\n\r\nbeen lost in the various Ministries. I do not wish\r\n\r\nto  anticipate the many items on which I have seen\r\n\r\namendments put.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the vote which was formerly\r\n\r\nshown for rural development, Malay settlements and\r\n\r\nso  on  has  now been scattered, particularly  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment votes in nearly 15 heads, according to\r\n\r\nthe  respective  uses that would be  made  of  the\r\n\r\nvote.  It  is  my  hope  that  the  Treasury,   in\r\n\r\npresenting  the  Budget next  year,  will  have  a\r\n\r\nsummary which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  show, for easy reference, just how much goes\r\n\r\nto  rural  development, how much to roads  in  the\r\n\r\nrural   areas,  Malay  settlements,  the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslands  and  so on. This is no criticism  of  the\r\n\r\nhard  work  that has been put in to integrate  the\r\n\r\nBudget,  but  because it is the  first  time,  the\r\n\r\npoint   was   overlooked  that   in   presentation\r\n\r\nsometimes,  for easy reference of Members,  it  is\r\n\r\nuseful  to  have a summary to show just  what,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  goes to town development and what, in fact,\r\n\r\ngoes  to country development. I will deal with  it\r\n\r\nin detail as the various amendments crop up. But I\r\n\r\nwould like to make the point that there is a total\r\n\r\nof  $7.8  million intended for rural  development,\r\n\r\nwhich includes the Southern Islands, and this also\r\n\r\nincludes a sum of $200,000 intended specially  for\r\n\r\nMalay  development,  which includes  the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslands. I would say that this is a generous\r\n\r\nvote - $200,000  specially for the Southern  Islands  and\r\n\r\nthree Malay settlements so far. We are spending an\r\n\r\nextra  sum of money per head on the Malay  section\r\n\r\nto  honour  the  spirit of  the  Preamble  to  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the reply\r\n\r\ngiven  by the Prime Minister does not tell us  how\r\n\r\nhe is going to tackle these three problems, except\r\n\r\nto  say that he has started revision of the Master\r\n\r\nPlan, which I am very happy to learn-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> One plan -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> - but, Mr Speaker.

That  is\r\n\r\n$100  more  than a Grade G post. Superscale  G  is\r\n\r\n$1,520,  which is the equivalent of the scale  for\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner for Labour. So  we  are  already\r\n\r\ntied down by the responsibility, on integration of\r\n\r\nCity Council and S.I.T. employees, not to pay them\r\n\r\nless than what they are getting and there must  be\r\n\r\nsome adjustment somewhere - either the post has  to\r\n\r\nbe a Grade F post, in which case it would not even\r\n\r\nbe  a promotion for the senior planner, or it  has\r\n\r\nto  be  a superscale D post. But these are matters\r\n\r\nwhich require time to look into. I do not think an\r\n\r\nearly confirmation will make any difference to the\r\n\r\nwork that is progressing. There is a man acting in\r\n\r\nthat  capacity,  and  in due  course  he  will  be\r\n\r\nconfirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> In view of the explanation given by\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister, might I be  given  leave  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 9 be\r\n\r\nreduced  by $10 in respect of item (5) of sub-head\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, item (5) of sub-head 1 reads \"Cadet\r\n\r\nPlanners,  three  ...

Under an integrated Budget,  I\r\n\r\nwould have thought that this should not appear  as\r\n\r\na  chargeable item on the Budget, particularly  as\r\n\r\nthe   hospital  and  medical  charges   of   other\r\n\r\nGovernment officers are borne by the Government. I\r\n\r\nhave  searched the Budget and I think this is  one\r\n\r\nof  two instances where such charges are made. But\r\n\r\nthis  particular item seems to run counter to  the\r\n\r\ngeneral terms of the Budget. Normally, if you take\r\n\r\nany  Ministry - the Ministry of National Development\r\n\r\nor  the  Ministry of Health - they do not  carry  a\r\n\r\nvote for hospital and medical charges. But in this\r\n\r\nparticular  case there is a vote for hospital  and\r\n\r\nmedical  charges,  and this gives  the  impression\r\n\r\nthat the monies will be physically paid out by the\r\n\r\nPlanning   Department  either  to  the  Government\r\n\r\nhospitals or to private practitioners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is quite so. The monies\r\n\r\nwill  have to be paid out.

These  are\r\n\r\nS.I.T. members, and by section 5 of the  Planning\r\n\r\nOrdinance,   every   officer  on   the   permanent\r\n\r\nestablishment  of the S.I.T. when  transferred  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government shall be deemed to be  transferred\r\n\r\nto  the service of the Government at the same rate\r\n\r\nof  pay  and  as  near  as may  be  on  the \r\n\r\nsame conditions  of service as those on  which  he  was\r\n\r\nemployed by the S I.T. And the S.I.T. paid this to\r\n\r\nthe  City Council to provide them with medical and\r\n\r\nhospital  care. The S.I.T. was tied  up  with  the\r\n\r\nCity Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the same facilities will have to be used\r\n\r\nuntil  they are completely integrated,  when  they\r\n\r\nwill  use the Government hospitals. Therefore  the\r\n\r\nnecessity  for this vote, Where the  City  Council\r\n\r\nstaff  are  involved as against the  S.I.T.,  that\r\n\r\nwill  not be shown because they never had  to  pay\r\n\r\nanything.

The point that is\r\n\r\nexercising  my  mind is sub-head  7,  which  reads\r\n\r\n\"Management  Fee - Municipal Provident  Fund\",  and\r\n\r\nsub-head   10,   which   reads   \"Public   Utility\r\n\r\nServices - Subordinate    Staff    Quarters\".    The\r\n\r\nMunicipal Provident Fund was managed by  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  to  which  membership the  staff  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Improvement Trust were admitted.  I  am\r\n\r\nnot quite sure whether the Trust paid a management\r\n\r\nfee  to  the City Council. But the point is  this.\r\n\r\nThis  is  about the only item in the Budget  which\r\n\r\nprovides  for a management fee in respect  of  the\r\n\r\nMunicipal Provident Fund, whereas there are  other\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Singapore Improvement  Trust  who\r\n\r\nmight  have moved on to other departments. So  the\r\n\r\nquestion  is,  why  is  it  necessary  to  have  a\r\n\r\nmanagement   fee  in  respect  of  the   Municipal\r\n\r\nProvident Fund for the Planning Department and not\r\n\r\nin  respect of other departments where either City\r\n\r\nCouncil employees or Municipal employees or  Trust\r\n\r\nemployees might have found their way?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next one, sub-head 10, \"Public Utility\r\n\r\nServices-Subordinate Staff Quarters\",  I  take  it\r\n\r\nhere again that this is necessary to maintain  the\r\n\r\nstatus quo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The point is that Municipal\r\n\r\nemployees who are members of the Fund do  not  pay\r\n\r\nthis management fee.

Now, I know that Government officers  do\r\n\r\noccupy Government quarters, but in those cases the\r\n\r\nDepartments  concerned do  not  pay  rent  to  the\r\n\r\nTreasury;  in fact, it is the officers who  occupy\r\n\r\nthe quarters who pay rent to the Treasury. But  as\r\n\r\nthe vote stands here, it would appear that the Air\r\n\r\nRegistration Board Branch is called  upon  to  pay\r\n\r\n$11,100 to the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, perhaps if I\r\n\r\nwere   to   explain  the  functions  of  the   Air\r\n\r\nRegistration   Board   the   position   would   be\r\n\r\nclarified. The Air Registration Board is a private\r\n\r\ncompany  which  is,  at  the  moment,  under   the\r\n\r\ndirection  of the Director of Civil Aviation.  The\r\n\r\nfunction  of this Board is to survey the technical\r\n\r\nrequirements to ensure that aircraft  comply  with\r\n\r\nstatutory technical requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Air Registration Board was set up in 1951\r\n\r\nand since then it has been under the Department of\r\n\r\nCivil Aviation. There are two persons employed  as\r\n\r\nAir Surveyors. Both of them are living in quarters\r\n\r\nto  which  the Government contributes  $11,100  as\r\n\r\nrent.  Part  of this money is apportioned  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya and the Borneo  territories,\r\n\r\nSingapore's share being one-third of this sum. So,\r\n\r\nstrictly speaking, these two officers in  the  Air\r\n\r\nRegistration Board are not civil servants  on  the\r\n\r\nestablishment, and therefore the charges  incurred\r\n\r\nby them will have to be paid by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, if I understood the Hon. the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister,  he  says  that  the  Air\r\n\r\nRegistration  Board  Branch is  not  part  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment but some private organisation,  and  as\r\n\r\nit   is   doing  work  for  the  Government,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   has  agreed  to  contribute   towards\r\n\r\npayment of its rent. Therefore all the other items\r\n\r\nare in connection with obligations incurred by the\r\n\r\nGovernment in connection with an agreement reached\r\n\r\nwith  the Air Registration Board Branch.

The officers in this  Air\r\n\r\nRegistration  Board are not civil servants,  as  I\r\n\r\nhave said. We have to fulfil certain international\r\n\r\nstatutory  regulations concerning air  navigation.\r\n\r\nThere is an Act called the Colonial Air Navigation\r\n\r\nOrder,  1955, which was passed on 1st July,  1955.\r\n\r\nUnder  this Act the D.C.A. has to ensure the  \r\n\r\nair-worthiness of aeroplanes. There were no  qualified\r\n\r\nlocal  personnel  who could be classified  as  Air\r\n\r\nSurveyors  and therefore, under arrangements  with\r\n\r\nthe  United Kingdom Government, two officers  from\r\n\r\nthis private company, the Air Registration. Board,\r\n\r\nwhich  is also known as the Air Registration Board\r\n\r\nin  the U.K., were despatched to Singapore to  act\r\n\r\non behalf of the Singapore Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, a further question that arises\r\n\r\nfrom the Hon. the Deputy Prime Minister's reply is\r\n\r\nthis: is it a statutory\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nobligation   that  we  should  engage   this   Air\r\n\r\nRegistration  Board  Branch?

The second question is:  if  it  is\r\n\r\nnot a statutory obligation to engage somebody from\r\n\r\nthis Air Registration Board, then, of course, this\r\n\r\nmust  be a voluntary association of the Government\r\n\r\nwith  these people.

The\r\n\r\nquestion  is,  how did the Vehicles Department  of\r\n\r\nthe   City   Council  get  itself  involved   with\r\n\r\naccidents which necessitated the hire of breakdown\r\n\r\ntrucks?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, having been a\r\n\r\nCity Councillor before, the Member for Farrer Park\r\n\r\nis  quite  well  versed in  the  business  of  the\r\n\r\nRegistry  of  Vehicles. However, he has  forgotten\r\n\r\nthat  one  of  the  functions of the  Registry  of\r\n\r\nVehicles  is that, if there are motor or non-motor\r\n\r\nvehicles  which do not pay their licence  fees  or\r\n\r\nother  taxes, then they will have to be impounded.\r\n\r\nTo  impound these vehicles, it is necessary to tow\r\n\r\nthem  into  the yard of the Registry of  Vehicles.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it is necessary for the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nVehicles to hire, not really breakdown trucks, but\r\n\r\ntrucks  to tow those vehicles which have not  paid\r\n\r\ntheir  fees  or  their taxes. The  City  Transport\r\n\r\nCentre at present owns the vehicles which are used\r\n\r\nby  the department for towing those vehicles which\r\n\r\nhave  not  paid their licences. In previous  years\r\n\r\nthe  provision  was  included under  the  Hire  of\r\n\r\nOffice  Station-wagons and Hire of Trucks  in  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council Estimates.

The fact is that because of an oversight or\r\n\r\nsomething  else the taxes on these  vehicles  have\r\n\r\nnot  been paid. Therefore, it is necessary for the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  impound  them,  which   they   are\r\n\r\nentitled  to do. Now, in impounding the  offending\r\n\r\nvehicle, I see no reason why the Government should\r\n\r\nnot  employ a driver in the P.W.D. to  go  to  the\r\n\r\nhouse and drive it to the yard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The explanation is quite\r\n\r\nsimple.

One of the means to attract\r\n\r\ntourists  is to show that we have the  ability  to\r\n\r\ngovern  or  to administer our State. For  instance\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, the uniform of the attendants in\r\n\r\nthe  parking space is not proper. It is  difficult\r\n\r\nfor  us to identify the attendants who look  after\r\n\r\nthe  cars. I therefore think that it is not in the\r\n\r\ninterests  of Singapore. It goes to show  that  we\r\n\r\nare  not able to maintain our status. I hope  this\r\n\r\nstate   of  affairs  will  be  rectified  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Besides  that, there  are  complaints\r\n\r\nregarding  the  service rendered by these  parking\r\n\r\ncar   attendants.  If  there   is   a   means   of\r\n\r\nidentification, it would be a simple thing for the\r\n\r\npublic  to  lodge  such  complaints  against   the\r\n\r\nattendants concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, \"That the sum to\r\n\r\nbe  allocated  for Head 19 be reduced  by  $10  in\r\n\r\nrespect of subbed 18.\" Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it being 8 p.m. Mr Speaker therefore left\r\n\r\nthe  Chair of the Committee and took the Chair  of\r\n\r\nthe Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to report\r\n\r\nthat the Committee of Supply has made progress  on\r\n\r\nthe  Main Estimates for 1961, and beg leave to sit\r\n\r\nagain tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That this Assembly do adjourn.\"-[Dr\r\n\r\nToh Chin Chye].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Eight o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
