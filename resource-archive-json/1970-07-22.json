The   present   demand   for\r\n\r\ntelephone  facilities  has  far  exceeded  planning\r\n\r\nforecasts.  Although the Singapore Telephone  Board\r\n\r\nreceived the World Bank's approval in December 1969\r\n\r\n(only  six  months ago) of a loan  of  $33  million\r\n\r\n(US$11  million)  for its $163 million  Development\r\n\r\nPlan  for six years (1970-75) with a planned target\r\n\r\nof  14 per cent per annum rate of growth, this  has\r\n\r\nnow  been  found to be inadequate and  the  revised 1971  Development Budget which was originally fixed\r\n\r\nat  $29.4  million has just been raised by  30  per\r\n\r\ncent to $38.3 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the second complaint that there\r\n\r\n\"appears  to  be an increasing number of  erroneous\r\n\r\ncalls  being  put through\", as we are operating  an\r\n\r\nautomatic  telephone  exchange,  such  errors   can\r\n\r\nlargely  be  caused  by the person  who  dials  the\r\n\r\ntelephone. Therefore, it is the human error  rather\r\n\r\nthan the fault of the automatic exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that some new applications for\r\n\r\ntelephones  have  to wait for months  before  their\r\n\r\nrequirements  can be met. Sometimes  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTelephone Board will not even be able to  meet  the\r\n\r\nrequest   for  telephones,  because  the  applicant\r\n\r\nhappens  to  live  in  an  area  which  is   rather\r\n\r\ninaccessible and where it would be just  uneconomic\r\n\r\nto  provide  such a service. It would cost  $30,000\r\n\r\njust to fix one line for that particular person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the S.T.B, does make every effort to\r\n\r\nreduce the waiting time for applicants. Members  of\r\n\r\nthis House will be pleased to note that whereas  in\r\n\r\nJune last year, there were as many as 3,140 waiters\r\n\r\nor  3.7  per cent of total working direct  exchange\r\n\r\nlines,  the position as at June this year was  only\r\n\r\n1,850  or  1.8  per cent of direct exchange  lines.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there has been a marked improvement with\r\n\r\nwaiters being reduced by one-half over that of last\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nfirstly,   it  appears  to  me  that  the  planning\r\n\r\nforecast of the Board was quite wrong, in  view  of\r\n\r\nthe  substantial adjustments that have to be  made.\r\n\r\nCan  the  Minister inform the House what steps  are\r\n\r\nbeing  taken to ensure a more accurate forecast  in\r\n\r\nfuture years?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Minister has attributed all the\r\n\r\nerroneous  calls to so-called human  errors.

In  the past, their Five-Year  Plan  had  a\r\n\r\ntarget  of  12  per cent rate of  growth,  and  the\r\n\r\nactual achievement turned out to be 14 per cent. So\r\n\r\nthey put up the next Five-Year Plan on the basis of\r\n\r\n14  per  cent  rate of growth per  annum,  and  the\r\n\r\nactual result came to 16 per cent. So it goes on. I\r\n\r\nthink  the credit for all this should be attributed\r\n\r\nto   the   political  and  economic  stability   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  There  has  been tremendous  industrial\r\n\r\nprogress,  and therefore the demand for  telephones\r\n\r\nhas  exceeded anticipation. We have to continue  to\r\n\r\ntry to keep pace with progress up to a point. If we\r\n\r\nask  the S.T.B, to forecast the annual growth  rate\r\n\r\nat 20 per cent, and the result turns out to be just\r\n\r\n16  per cent, then we are going to overdevelop  one\r\n\r\naspect of the economic sector, the money for  which\r\n\r\ncould very well be used for other sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said that the faults are not all due to\r\n\r\nhuman error.

Members  of this House will recall  that  on\r\n\r\nthe  31st  of  March this year, the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nofficially   launched  an  all-out   anti-pollution\r\n\r\ncampaign  for Singapore. Besides focusing attention\r\n\r\non  the  need  for the early eradication  of  smoky\r\n\r\nexhausts from motor vehicles, he also commented  on\r\n\r\nsome  important  aspects of  road  transport  which\r\n\r\nneeded improvement, namely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, that the 11 existing bus companies\r\n\r\nshould   be  amalgamated  into  fewer  but   larger\r\n\r\ncompanies, and the necessity to streamline  present\r\n\r\nbus routes for better bus services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, since the employment situation has\r\n\r\nimproved  considerably and there are now  many  job\r\n\r\nopportunities available, pirate taxis would have to\r\n\r\nbe phased out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, that the diesel tax on private cars\r\n\r\nwould have to be raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, that taxi licences now limited to 3,800\r\n\r\nwould be increased to 5,000, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  was  thus  a matter of time before Government's\r\n\r\nintentions on these subjects would be spelt out  in\r\n\r\ngreater detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after assuming the portfolio of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Communications two years ago,  I  came  to  the\r\n\r\nconclusion that something drastic would have to  be\r\n\r\ndone   to  overhaul  and  to  improve  the   public\r\n\r\npassenger transport service of Singapore.  To  this\r\n\r\nend,  I  appointed  a 15-member Transport  Advisory\r\n\r\nBoard  in  August  1968,  and  its  first  term  of\r\n\r\nreference was `To study ways and means\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhow to improve the present public transport service\r\n\r\n(bus,  taxi,  etc.)'.

Although  the  Transport  Advisory\r\n\r\nBoard  has  not been able to come to  any  definite\r\n\r\nconclusions regarding the most important aspect  of\r\n\r\npublic  transport,  namely,  bus  services,  enough\r\n\r\nmaterial  and  information  are  available  to   my\r\n\r\nMinistry  for  it  to draw up a blue-print,  as  it\r\n\r\nwere, of a bold three-year reorganisation plan  for\r\n\r\nthe  motor transport service of Singapore.  In  the\r\n\r\nwake  of  an all-out anti-pollution drive, this  is\r\n\r\nindeed  the  opportune time, not for dilly-dallying\r\n\r\nbut  for  decision-making. Hence  the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nwhich is now in the hands of Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tabling the White Paper, may I be permitted to\r\n\r\nexplain,  in  brief, the guiding  principles  under\r\n\r\nwhich it was drawn up?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) First and foremost, it would have to be a\r\n\r\nsimple  yet workable plan and capable of  immediate\r\n\r\nimplementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) That although Government does not propose to\r\n\r\nnationalise the existing 11 bus companies, it  will\r\n\r\nnot  hesitate to exercise its powers to direct  and\r\n\r\ncontrol  the way in which bus companies  and  taxis\r\n\r\nare  expected  to provide a reasonably satisfactory\r\n\r\nstandard of service for a public utility for  which\r\n\r\nthe  public is paying no less than $120 million  in\r\n\r\nfares per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Any proper reorganisation of the public\r\n\r\npassenger transport service must require a decisive\r\n\r\nand  firm resolve to phase out the illegal `pirate'\r\n\r\ntaxis and the abolishment of the School (SCH) taxis\r\n\r\nand the deadline has been fixed for 1st July, 1971,\r\n\r\nor 11 months from now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this decision will have wide social and\r\n\r\neconomic repercussions affecting the livelihood  of\r\n\r\na  few  thousand, I wish to assure Members of  this\r\n\r\nHouse that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreat  care  and thought have been  given  to  this\r\n\r\nmatter so that hardship, if any, will be reduced to\r\n\r\nthe barest minimum possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our plan proposes a two-way approach towards the\r\n\r\nresolution of this tenacious problem:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) By creating not less than 6,500 job\r\n\r\nopportunities over the next three years  under  the\r\n\r\nplan (for details see para. 7.7 of White Paper):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Job\r\n\r\n                               Opportunities\r\n\r\n     1st year of plan              4,150\r\n\r\n     2nd year of plan              1,300\r\n\r\n     3rd year of plan              1,050\r\n\r\n                                   -----\r\n\r\n                           Total   6,500\r\n\r\n                                   =====\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the present `pirate' taxi drivers be\r\n\r\nreluctant  to change their occupation  as  drivers,\r\n\r\nthere  is an honourable way out for them to earn  a\r\n\r\ndecent livelihood and to become respectable members\r\n\r\nof  the  community by fitting themselves  into  the\r\n\r\nmany  jobs  that will be made available under  this\r\n\r\nreorganisation plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Once Government has decided to crack down\r\n\r\non  the  illegal activities of `pirate'  taxis  and\r\n\r\nhaving  given them more than reasonable  notice  of\r\n\r\nnearly  one  year to start a new chapter  in  their\r\n\r\nlives, to be consonant with our \"Republic's aim  of\r\n\r\nbuilding  a law-abiding, disciplined, tightly  knit\r\n\r\nand  organised society for Singapore\", a series  of\r\n\r\nstem  measures will be taken against such  `pirate'\r\n\r\ntaxi  operators, to be enumerated later, which will\r\n\r\nmake  it  clear that continuance of such activities\r\n\r\nwill no longer be tolerated nor worth while.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then are the main targets to be achieved\r\n\r\nunder this plan (for details, see para. 13 of White\r\n\r\nPaper)?

This pre-supposes  that  the  10 Chinese  bus  companies\r\n\r\nwould  have  voluntarily amalgamated themselves\r\n\r\ninto  three  regional companies  and  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Traction  Company  will  also   take\r\n\r\n\"strong steps to reorganise itself\" or else  my\r\n\r\n\"Ministry  will  have  no  alternative  but  to\r\n\r\nintervene\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) A transport consultant is already at work\r\n\r\nto  co-ordinate and to rationalise for  maximum\r\n\r\nefficiency  the  present 117 bus  routes  which\r\n\r\nhave  already  been  allotted  to  the  11  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) School buses\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Every encouragement will be given to the\r\n\r\nrapid  expansion of the school bus  service  by\r\n\r\nextending the 30 per cent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreduction   in   road   taxes   for    general\r\n\r\napplication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) It is estimated that the present school\r\n\r\nbus  fleet of 150 will be increased by at least\r\n\r\nanother 450 or 300 per cent to 600, within  the\r\n\r\nnext three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The proposal of the National Trades Union\r\n\r\nCongress  to establish a Workers Transport  Co-operative  not  only  for  taxis  but  also  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a mini school bus service will receive\r\n\r\nevery   encouragement  and  support   from   my\r\n\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Taxis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) With the proposed increase in taxi\r\n\r\nlicences from the present 3.800 by 1,200 or  35\r\n\r\nper  cent  to  5,000, it has been decided  that\r\n\r\n1,000   of  the  new  taxi  licences  will   be\r\n\r\nallotted  to  the  NTUC Transport  Co-operative\r\n\r\nwhen it is formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) With the introduction of the age limit\r\n\r\nfor  taxis  at  seven years, at least  30  per\r\n\r\ncent  of  the present fleet of taxis or  1.200\r\n\r\nare  liable to he de-licensed because of  over\r\n\r\nage, unless the present registered owners  are\r\n\r\nable  to substitute these over-aged taxis with\r\n\r\nnew  taxis.

The  increase  will,  however,\r\n\r\ntake effect in two phases. The first phase  of\r\n\r\n50  per cent increase will take effect as from\r\n\r\n1st  December,  1970 (four months  from  now),\r\n\r\nand  the second phase of a further 50 per cent\r\n\r\nwill  take  effect as from 1st of  July.  1971\r\n\r\n(11 months from now).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Seized `pirate' taxis which are in poor\r\n\r\nmechanical   condition  will  no   longer   be\r\n\r\nauctioned  for re-use as `pirate' taxis  again\r\n\r\nbut will be condemned and sold as scrap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The driving licence of the `pirate' taxi\r\n\r\ndriver will be suspended for one year, in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  instance, and a jail sentence  for  the\r\n\r\nsecond offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) `Pirate' taxi operations will be made a\r\n\r\nseizable offence by legislation. This  means\r\n\r\nthat  the  `pirate'  taxi  operator  can  be\r\n\r\narrested  on  the  spot,  detained  at   the\r\n\r\npolice  station and produced  in  court  and\r\n\r\ncharged the next day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) School (SCH) taxis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) As school (SCH) taxis are now paying the\r\n\r\ndiesel  tax rate for private cars,  these  SCH\r\n\r\ntaxis  will be liable to pay the 50  per  cent\r\n\r\nincrease  in diesel tax as from 1st  December,\r\n\r\n1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) With the proposed rapid expansion of the\r\n\r\nschool  bus  service  to include  mini  school\r\n\r\nbuses  as  well,  it  has  been  decided  that\r\n\r\nschool (SCH) taxis will be phased out as  soon\r\n\r\nas  school buses and mini buses are  ready  to\r\n\r\nreplace them in 11 months' time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) Goods vehicles\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members of the House are already aware, a\r\n\r\npilot  scheme (proposed by the Traffic  Police)  is\r\n\r\nalready  in  operation as from 1st June to  relieve\r\n\r\ncongestion on our roads by restricting loading  and\r\n\r\nunloading  of  goods during peak hours  along  nine\r\n\r\nselected streets of the central business district.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the pilot scheme has been in operation\r\n\r\nfor only seven weeks, there is no doubt that it  is\r\n\r\nalready a distinct success, and when the time comes\r\n\r\nfor a review of the scheme to take place at the end\r\n\r\nof  the  year, it is most likely that  it  will  be\r\n\r\nextended to other parts of the city by next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) Motor cycles/scooters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House will be pleased to know\r\n\r\nthat  although  he  wearing of crash  helmets  has\r\n\r\nbeen made compulsory for `L' riders\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly (which represent only 10 per cent of the total\r\n\r\nnumber of licensed riders in the Republic) as  from\r\n\r\nFebruary  this year, more and more are  voluntarily\r\n\r\nwearing  crash helmets before it becomes compulsory\r\n\r\nfor all to do so in January next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fact has been confirmed by statistics of\r\n\r\naccident figures kept by the Emergency Unit of  the\r\n\r\nOutram  Road  General Hospital. For the  five-month\r\n\r\nperiod February/June 1969 there were 1,462 cases of\r\n\r\naccidents  involving motor cyclists or  scooterists\r\n\r\nwithout crash helmets, whereas for the same  period\r\n\r\nthis  year the number of cases fell to 919, a sharp\r\n\r\nfall of 543, or 40 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When compulsory wearing of crash helmets for all\r\n\r\nscooterists,  motor  cyclists  and  their  pillion-riders becomes effective as from January next year,\r\n\r\nwe  should  have less head injuries in scooter  and\r\n\r\nmotor cycle accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Private vehicles\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, it has been decided to subject all\r\n\r\nprivate vehicles to inspection, in respect of  the\r\n\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) On transfer of ownership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) An annual inspection will be required in\r\n\r\nrespect  of old vehicles to ensure  that  they\r\n\r\nare,   in   fact,  in  a  fit  and  roadworthy\r\n\r\ncondition;  for motor cycles and  scooters  if\r\n\r\nover  five years old; and for cars if over  10\r\n\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j) Administration will be further strengthened\r\n\r\nand facilities improved\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Pending strengthening of the staff in the\r\n\r\nMechanical   Section  of   the   Registry   of\r\n\r\nVehicles,   a   list   of   authorised   motor\r\n\r\nworkshops or repairers will be drawn up  whose\r\n\r\ncertificates of inspection that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvehicles  are in order will be  accepted  by\r\n\r\nthe Registrar of Vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) A new Enforcement Section will be\r\n\r\nestablished  comprising 80 men  which  could\r\n\r\nbe  attached  to  the Traffic  Police.

This  plan can  achieve  the  many\r\n\r\ntargets  set,  given  determination  and  sustained\r\n\r\neffort  on  the part of those responsible  for  its\r\n\r\nimplementation.

F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nvoice  my  wholehearted support of  the  Bill.  The\r\n\r\nScience Centre, as we have just heard, will  be  an\r\n\r\nautonomous statutory body. It is good to note  that\r\n\r\nwhilst  the Science Centre Board will be ultimately\r\n\r\nresponsible to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Science and Technology,  it  will\r\n\r\nyet   have  discretion  over  the  acquisition  and\r\n\r\ndisposal of funds, and have adequate administrative\r\n\r\ncontrol over its officers and employees so that  it\r\n\r\nwill  be in a position to direct the implementation\r\n\r\nof its objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of the Board has a particularly\r\n\r\nspecial  logic. The Science Centre, we have  heard,\r\n\r\nwill  have  two components generally, namely,  life\r\n\r\nsciences  and technology. In the real  business  of\r\n\r\nliving,   these   two   aspects   are,   I   think,\r\n\r\ninextricably   intertwined.  One   cannot   produce\r\n\r\ntechnologists  without orientating such  people  to\r\n\r\nthe  objectives of technology, namely, to make life\r\n\r\nmuch  better  for  the people. At  the  same  time,\r\n\r\ntrying  to interest our people in life sciences  in\r\n\r\nvacuo   is,   I  think,  a  most  difficult   task.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding of the relationship between  man  and\r\n\r\nhis  environment,  a perception of  the  ecological\r\n\r\nproblem, can best be inculcated by referring to the\r\n\r\neffects  of technology on man. Technology  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  an unmitigated boon. Advances in science have\r\n\r\nresulted in pollution, in noise, anti-conservation,\r\n\r\nin traffic jams, in industrial hazards, mental ill-health, and so on. It is only when we bring home to\r\n\r\nour  people  a  sense  of  the  vital  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  technology  and our  down-to-earth  living\r\n\r\nthat we can ensure a better life for our people  as\r\n\r\nwell  as help produce technicians and technologists\r\n\r\nwho  will  contribute to this  gracious  life.  The\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of this Science Centre  will  help,  I\r\n\r\nhope, to combat our ignorance of the effects in the\r\n\r\nlong run of the exploitation of nature, as well  as\r\n\r\nencourage  our people towards such an understanding\r\n\r\nof science as will enable our society to advance to\r\n\r\nmore sophisticated levels of industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we must view this Bill as laying the\r\n\r\nfoundation for the establishment of the new Science\r\n\r\nCentre. This Bill will enable the Board, when it is\r\n\r\nset  up, to proceed apace with the negotiation  for\r\n\r\nacquisition   of  exhibits,  training   of   staff,\r\n\r\nplanning for the construction of the centre itself,\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The centre will eventually take over the National\r\n\r\nMuseum, at least the exhibits there which relate to\r\n\r\nthe  life sciences. May I suggest that the  current\r\n\r\nsite  of  the  National Museum with its  historical\r\n\r\narchitectural features can serve as  a  centre  for\r\n\r\nthe  exhibition of such materials as can attest  to\r\n\r\nthe  various cultural backgrounds that make up  the\r\n\r\nmulti-faceted life that we enjoy in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.54 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> The idea of a Science Centre\r\n\r\nis  a worthy one.

Nevertheless,   I   would   like    to\r\n\r\ncongratulate  the  Minister on his  far-sightedness\r\n\r\nand effort in modernising our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have modernisation, we must have technology.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, on the face of it, this Bill will\r\n\r\nnot  arouse  the interest of the people because  it\r\n\r\nconcerns science and technology.

The  Act  itself   was\r\n\r\nintended to meet the situation prevailing  in  the\r\n\r\nyears   immediately  preceding  1967,   when   the\r\n\r\neconomic future of Singapore was clouded  in  some\r\n\r\nuncertainty  as  a  result of our  expulsion  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than two years have passed since the\r\n\r\npassage  of the Act and these two years have  seen\r\n\r\nsome  improvement, a great deal of which  was  the\r\n\r\nresult  of  the operation of the Act  itself.  The\r\n\r\ntime  therefore has come to take a fresh  look  at\r\n\r\nthe situation, more especially\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso as several observers from aboard, including the\r\n\r\nInternational Monetary Fund and a mission sent  by\r\n\r\nthe  Massachusetts Institute of  Technology,  have\r\n\r\ncommented on the generosity of our tax incentives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will deal with the main changes which are\r\n\r\nprovided  for by this amending Bill and leave  out\r\n\r\nminor  and technical matters. The principal effect\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill,  in so far as it affects  intending\r\n\r\ninvestors,  is  a reduction in the period  of  tax\r\n\r\nincentives for export enterprises from 15 years to\r\n\r\neight years. This will apply to the general run of\r\n\r\nbusiness,  but  in  exceptional  circumstances  as\r\n\r\ndefined in the Bill, the 15-year period will still\r\n\r\nbe available. These are for very large enterprises\r\n\r\nwith  a capital investment of $ I billion or  more\r\n\r\nor   those  with  a  capital  investment  of  $150\r\n\r\nmillion,  of  which more than  half  is  owned  by\r\n\r\npermanent residents of the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the 5-year tax relief provided for\r\n\r\npioneer  industries, this incentive is  henceforth\r\n\r\navailable only to large enterprises with  a  fixed\r\n\r\ncapital  investment of not less than  $1  million.\r\n\r\nSmaller   enterprises   may   apply   for   export\r\n\r\nincentives,  but  if  they produce  only  for  the\r\n\r\ndomestic market they will get nothing as it is not\r\n\r\nthe  policy  of  the Government  to  give  Pioneer\r\n\r\nCertificates to manufacturers who produce for  the\r\n\r\ndomestic market, whatever their size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also amendments regarding depreciation\r\n\r\nallowances. Hitherto, these can be carried forward\r\n\r\nto  the  post-pioneer period at accelerated rates,\r\n\r\nwhich  in effect means an extension of the pioneer\r\n\r\nperiod  beyond  five years to six  years  or  even\r\n\r\nseven years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, those who have been granted tax\r\n\r\nconcessions  under the 1967 Act will  continue  to\r\n\r\nenjoy them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of the Government to make changes\r\n\r\nin  our tax incentive laws has been known for some\r\n\r\ntime  both  to local industrialists and industries\r\n\r\nabroad.  This  has been somewhat  helpful  to  our\r\n\r\ninvestment promotion efforts. In the last four  or\r\n\r\nfive months, there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  been  a  series of negotiations  between  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   and  a  number  .of  large  well-known\r\n\r\ninternational firms who wanted to take advantage of\r\n\r\nthe 15-year tax incentive while the going was still\r\n\r\ngood.  I am happy to announce to Members that  most\r\n\r\nof   these   negotiations  have  been  successfully\r\n\r\nconcluded, the last one at 4 p.m, yesterday.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  we shall see some very large manufacturing\r\n\r\noperations established in Singapore using  advanced\r\n\r\ntechnology  and employing large numbers of  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers, technicians and engineers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the larger and more important of these\r\n\r\ninvestors are General Electric of the United States\r\n\r\nof  America, Philips of Holland and Rollei-Werke of\r\n\r\nGermany,   producers  of  the   famous   Rolleiflex\r\n\r\ncameras.  Each  of these companies  will  establish\r\n\r\nenterprises in Singapore which will employ in their\r\n\r\nplants between 3,500 and 5,000 workers by 1975. The\r\n\r\nvalue  of  the aggregate output of these plants  by\r\n\r\n1975  is expected to exceed $600 million. The range\r\n\r\nof  products manufactured is very wide and includes\r\n\r\nconsumer   electrical  supplies,  home  appliances,\r\n\r\nradios, tape recorders, production machinery, tools\r\n\r\nand  dyes,  cameras, lenses and optical  equipment.\r\n\r\nThese  are  production  operations  and  not   mere\r\n\r\nassembly.  A  training programme has  already  been\r\n\r\nstarted  to  produce  the  skilled  craftsmen   and\r\n\r\ntechnicians   who   are   needed   in   these   new\r\n\r\nenterprises.  They  are  being  trained   both   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and abroad. I am sure that Members  will\r\n\r\nwant  me  to express our appreciation to those  who\r\n\r\nwere  responsible  for  getting  these  very  large\r\n\r\nenterprises  introduced in Singapore.  The  persons\r\n\r\nconcerned  are the very dedicated officers  of  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Development Board, who have put  in  long\r\n\r\nand  sustained hours of work both in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nin promotion offices in Europe and America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting these large firms to agree to set up\r\n\r\nthese big projects in Singapore does not mean  that\r\n\r\neverything is over bar the shouting. In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nreal work begins as from now.

If we fail to produce these workers  with\r\n\r\nthe  requisite skills, diligence and ability,  then\r\n\r\nthe   whole  foundation  of  our  industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme  would  be undermined.

It has features  that  should\r\n\r\nencourage  more  joint ventures,  greater  size  of\r\n\r\nindustries  and,  most important  of  all,  export-orientation.   Joint  ventures   are   particularly\r\n\r\nsignificant  to an economy like ours, because  when\r\n\r\ntax  exemption  is  given, at  least  some  of  the\r\n\r\nprofits accrue to our Gross National Product. There\r\n\r\nis  a very real danger that where an enterprise  is\r\n\r\nsolely   foreign-owned  and  is   tax-exempt,   the\r\n\r\ncontribution  to our Gross National Product  during\r\n\r\nthe  pioneer period may be negligible, if  we  take\r\n\r\ninto  account  the  real  cost  of  providing   the\r\n\r\neconomic infrastructure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Bill gives encouragement to joint\r\n\r\nventures  only of enterprises worth at  least  $150\r\n\r\nmillion. It seems to me to be desirable to  have  a\r\n\r\ngraduated  scale between the minimum  qualification\r\n\r\nof  $1  million  for pioneer status  and  the  $150\r\n\r\nmillion   qualification  for  special  depreciation\r\n\r\nallowances and export-tax benefits of 15  years  in\r\n\r\norder  to encourage those industries that are joint\r\n\r\nventures but which range in between $1 million  and\r\n\r\n$150 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we may want to build in a feature to\r\n\r\nencourage  management  and  technical  training  to\r\n\r\nlocal people. Perhaps an index of the proportion of\r\n\r\npayroll  which is paid to local personnel could  be\r\n\r\nused   in   determining  the  amount  of   pioneer,\r\n\r\ndepreciation and export-tax benefits,  again  on  a\r\n\r\ngraduated scale. It may be noted that salaries paid\r\n\r\nto  non-local  staff may add to our Gross  Domestic\r\n\r\nProduct but not to our Gross National Product which\r\n\r\nis  the  more accurate measure of national economic\r\n\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for raising the qualifying capital expenditure\r\n\r\nfor an expanding enterprise from $1 million to over\r\n\r\n$10  million, I think it may be desirable again  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  graduated  scale, with so  much  exemption\r\n\r\ngiven   for  so  many  million  dollars  worth   of\r\n\r\nadditional capital expenditure. It is not clear  to\r\n\r\nme  why,  if  we  allow pioneer  benefits  with  $1\r\n\r\nmillion  capital expenditure initially,  we  should\r\n\r\nrequire  reinvestment of $10 million  in  order  to\r\n\r\nprovide continuing benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the principle of the Bill is well considered and I support it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Bill  is  in relation  to  the  economic\r\n\r\nexpansion  incentives and relief from  income  tax.\r\n\r\nThe Minister has talked at length in this House  on\r\n\r\nvarious  aspects relating to the status of  pioneer\r\n\r\nindustries,   tax  exemption  and  other   matters.\r\n\r\nAccording to him, the Bill can help our economy  to\r\n\r\nprogress further. However, I have several questions\r\n\r\nwhich I would like him to clarify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, if the amendment Bill is passed, will it\r\n\r\nhave any adverse effect on those industries with  a\r\n\r\nsmaller capital? For instance, as a result of  this\r\n\r\nBill,  investors  with a smaller capital  will  not\r\n\r\ninvest here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, what are the reasons behind the\r\n\r\nintroduction of this amendment Bill?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, how much revenue can our country get every\r\n\r\nyear after the Bill is passed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Whampoa has\r\n\r\nmade  what,  to  me, appears to be  quite  a  valid\r\n\r\npoint. It is only a question of whether this is the\r\n\r\nright moment to apply the policy he recommends. For\r\n\r\ninstance, he is recommending a clear distinction in\r\n\r\ntreatment    between   the   wholly   foreign-owned\r\n\r\nenterprises  and  those in which local  capital  is\r\n\r\nallowed participation. I am wholly in sympathy with\r\n\r\nthis policy. The only question is whether we should\r\n\r\nintroduce it now or wait until our industrial  base\r\n\r\nis so firmly established that we can afford to risk\r\n\r\nsome adverse comment which is bound to arise in the\r\n\r\ninvesting countries. When the time comes,  when  we\r\n\r\nare  more  self-sufficient in technology and  know-how, and possibly even in markets, this policy will\r\n\r\nnot only make sense but can be introduced with less\r\n\r\nrisk than is the position today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards giving preference for employment of\r\n\r\nlocal  management personnel, may  I  say  that  the\r\n\r\ndemand  for  management personnel  is  so  much  in\r\n\r\nexcess of supply that, far from encouraging foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors  to employ local personnel, I have  often\r\n\r\nhad  to urge them to bring their own personnel  and\r\n\r\nnot  to  disrupt  the  tight market  situation  now\r\n\r\nexisting. In fact, it has been necessary for me  to\r\n\r\nenter into a gentleman's agreement with some of the\r\n\r\nlarger American and British companies not to  pinch\r\n\r\neach  other's  executive staff. Here again  if  the\r\n\r\nsupply  and demand position changes, we can have  a\r\n\r\ntry  at  it,  but it is likely that the demand  for\r\n\r\ngood  executives  of ability and  high  engineering\r\n\r\nskills will remain in short supply for a very  long\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa asked why $10 million for\r\n\r\nexpansion  when  there is only  $1  million  for  a\r\n\r\npioneer firm. The rationale behind it is that if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  pioneer firm has been running for some time  and\r\n\r\nhas  had experience, it has got good value for  its\r\n\r\nmoney.  And  if  it really wants more  concessions,\r\n\r\nthen  the  size  of the increment  should  be  much\r\n\r\ngreater  than  is the case with a new  venture.  We\r\n\r\nthought  that $10 million was a convenient  figure,\r\n\r\nbut any other figure will do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang asked whether there\r\n\r\nwould be any adverse effects on smaller industries.\r\n\r\nI assure him that there will be no adverse effects.\r\n\r\nSmaller  industries  will not be  persecuted.  They\r\n\r\nwill still continue to flourish, one hopes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked why we introduced this\r\n\r\namending Bill. Perhaps I did not make it very clear\r\n\r\nin  my Second Reading speech. The point is that the\r\n\r\noriginal Act has been too generous. We gave  people\r\n\r\n15  years' lax exemption, whereas we think now that\r\n\r\nwith  eight years' tax exemption we will  get  them\r\n\r\ncoming  in.  Similarly, there is no reason  why  we\r\n\r\nshould  give pioneer status to very small companies\r\n\r\nas  we are doing now. It is a lot of work and quite\r\n\r\noften  these small companies do not profit  anyway.\r\n\r\nSo the pioneer status is quite meaningless to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also wants to know how\r\n\r\nmuch  more  revenue we will collect  from  this.  I\r\n\r\nreally do not know. There is no way of making  this\r\n\r\ncalculation because it all depends on how many  new\r\n\r\nfirms come in and what profits they make. The  only\r\n\r\nthing  that  I  know is that we will  collect  more\r\n\r\nrevenue under this amending Bill than under the old\r\n\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Dr Goh Keng Swee].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PENSIONS (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.34 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nbeg  to  move, \"That the Bill he now read a  Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A national serviceman who joins Government\r\n\r\nservice  after having served a period of  full-time\r\n\r\nnational service, is now granted salary increments,\r\n\r\non  appointment, commensurate with the time he  has\r\n\r\nspent  in  such  full-time  national  service.  The\r\n\r\nvarious   statutory  boards  have   also   followed\r\n\r\nGovernment's  example.  This  is  to  ensure   that\r\n\r\nsomeone  who  is  called up for full-time  national\r\n\r\nservice  and later joins the service of  Government\r\n\r\nor one of the statutory boards does not lose out to\r\n\r\nhis contemporary who is not called up for full-time\r\n\r\nnational service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, however, proposes to take this one\r\n\r\nstage  further.  A  youth who  undergoes  full-time\r\n\r\nnational  service will also be rewarded  by  having\r\n\r\nsuch  service included as pensionable service under\r\n\r\nthe Pensions Ordinance, 1956, if he is appointed to\r\n\r\nand subsequently retires from Government service in\r\n\r\npensionable circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Pensions Ordinance only allows\r\n\r\nfor  service in a civil capacity to be included for\r\n\r\npension purposes. The Bill, in seeking to amend the\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  provides  for  the  President  to  make\r\n\r\nregulations for this purpose. The period  of  full-time  national service could be put in at any time,\r\n\r\nwhether  before or after the officer's  appointment\r\n\r\nto Government service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Mr Speaker, Sir, is only fair recognition\r\n\r\nof  the  service in the cause of our country  which\r\n\r\nour national servicemen put in. No one in his right\r\n\r\nsenses   would   grudge  this   to   our   national\r\n\r\nservicemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill provides that where an\r\n\r\nofficer is retired in the public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterest   under  paragraph  (e)  or   in   special\r\n\r\ncircumstances  after  having  completed  15  years'\r\n\r\nservice  under paragraph (j) of subsection  (2)  to\r\n\r\nsection  7  of the Ordinance, he will  not  draw  a\r\n\r\npension till he has attained the age of 50. This is\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that an officer who retires prematurely\r\n\r\ndoes  not  in  the long run benefit more  than  the\r\n\r\nofficer  who serves his full career in  the  public\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, an officer who is retired at the\r\n\r\nage of 35 years in the public interest would, if he\r\n\r\njoined  the  service  at 24 years  of  age  and  is\r\n\r\ndrawing  a salary of $1,000 a month at the time  of\r\n\r\nretirement,  normally  be eligible  for  a  monthly\r\n\r\npension  of about $200 plus a gratuity of  $10,000.\r\n\r\nIf  this  is  paid  to him from  the  time  of  his\r\n\r\nretirement  at 35 up to the age of 70, which  is  a\r\n\r\nreasonable life expectancy, he would draw  a  total\r\n\r\nof $102,000 over the 35 years he is in receipt of a\r\n\r\npension.  Moreover, he would be in  a  position  to\r\n\r\nfind  other employment after retirement  and  would\r\n\r\nbenefit  from the Central Provident Fund  or  other\r\n\r\nsuperannuation scheme in addition to the salary  he\r\n\r\nwould receive from such employment. This surely  is\r\n\r\nan  anomalous  situation where an  officer  who  is\r\n\r\nretired  or retires prematurely benefits more  than\r\n\r\none  who gives his whole working life to the public\r\n\r\nservice with loyalty and dedication and retires  at\r\n\r\nthe normal retirement age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is, however, being made for payment of\r\n\r\ngratuity  to  the  dependants  of  an  officer  who\r\n\r\nretires prematurely and who does not survive to  50\r\n\r\nyears.

It is wise for the Government to\r\n\r\nintroduce this amendment Bill. This Bill treats the\r\n\r\nperiod  of national service as pensionable  service\r\n\r\nfor   national   servicemen  who  join   Government\r\n\r\nservice.  In  other  words,  our  youths  who  have\r\n\r\ncompleted national service and who join the  public\r\n\r\nservice  will have their period of national service\r\n\r\ntaken  into  consideration when their pensions  are\r\n\r\ncomputed  on  retirement. Their full-time  national\r\n\r\nservice  is  regarded as effective public  service.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  national  servicemen  who  join   the\r\n\r\npublic   service  are  granted  salary   increments\r\n\r\ncommensurate  with the period they  have  spent  in\r\n\r\nfull-time  national service.  But  I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether the statutory boards and private enterprise\r\n\r\nhave  also  implemented this scheme.  What  is  the\r\n\r\noutcome  of  the negotiations between the  National\r\n\r\nTrades  Union  Congress and private  enterprise  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  our  youths who have completed  their\r\n\r\nnational service will benefit from this scheme?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, this scheme also applies to the statutory boards. But I do not know whether national servicemen who join the public service and the statutory boards are exempted from having to serve a three-year probationary period. If they have to, then it is in conflict with the principle\r\n\r\nthat  national  service  is  deemed  to  be  public\r\n\r\nservice. This will put them at a disadvantage  when\r\n\r\nthey  compete  with  other  people  who  have   not\r\n\r\nundergone national service in promotion exercises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is not a weak country. It is a country\r\n\r\nwhich implements measures when these are necessary.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  country  which places  emphasis  on  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of its people and it  is  a  country\r\n\r\nlocated  in  a  strategic  position.

However, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  to  a  young  man who has undergone  national\r\n\r\nservice,  it  is  proper  for  the  Government   to\r\n\r\nlegislate  to safeguard his interest and to  regard\r\n\r\nhis two-year full-time national service as part  of\r\n\r\nhis public service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support this Bill.

I do agree with the rationale behind this\r\n\r\nBill that an officer who retires prematurely should\r\n\r\nonly  be  entitled  to the drawing  of  pension  on\r\n\r\nreaching the age of 50 years. However, I feel  that\r\n\r\nthis  particular feature of the Bill has not  taken\r\n\r\ninto  consideration the fact that a public  officer\r\n\r\ncan  opt  for  a  full  pension,  a  three-quarters\r\n\r\npension and a quarter pension with gratuity. What I\r\n\r\nwant  to know is, if an officer retires prematurely\r\n\r\nand  he  is not able to receive the monthly pension\r\n\r\nuntil  he reaches the age of 50 years, will  he  be\r\n\r\nentitled  to  receive his gratuity  immediately?  I\r\n\r\nhope  that  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance will give a \"yes\" answer to my\r\n\r\nquery, simply because I think that there will be no\r\n\r\nrationale  behind  the move to prevent  an  officer\r\n\r\nfrom  receiving  his gratuity payment  immediately.\r\n\r\nThe   reason   is  this:  I  will  just   give   an\r\n\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf  an officer retires prematurely on good grounds,\r\n\r\nat  the  age of 40 years, and he is given immediate\r\n\r\npension benefits, meaning that every month he  gets\r\n\r\nhis  pension allowance, then he definitely  has  an\r\n\r\nadded  advantage over another serving  officer  who\r\n\r\nhas got to serve till the normal retirement age. It\r\n\r\ngives  him  an extra ten years to draw  that  extra\r\n\r\nmoney.  Therefore, if this Bill seeks to stop  that\r\n\r\nloop-hole,  I  think the rationale is  sound.  This\r\n\r\nwill  not  make those dedicated and loyal  officers\r\n\r\nwho serve up to the normal retirement age feel that\r\n\r\nthey have been unfairly treated, and that those who\r\n\r\nleave the service prematurely get an added monetary\r\n\r\nbenefit. But the amount of gratuity will not change\r\n\r\nonce it is computed -whether he receives it at  the\r\n\r\nage  of 40 years or 50 years. He is entitled to it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would imagine that while, or, the  one\r\n\r\nhand,  there is a rationale for stopping an officer\r\n\r\nfrom  getting his pension allowance immediately  on\r\n\r\nhis premature retirement, I see no rationale at all\r\n\r\nfor   stopping  him  from  getting  his   gratuity.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  hope that my fears are  unfounded  and\r\n\r\nthat  the Parliamentary Secretary will give a \"yes\"\r\n\r\nanswer to my query.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me reply\r\n\r\nto  the  Member for Moulmein first.

He exercises it at the  end  of\r\n\r\nhis career. Six months before he retires, he has to\r\n\r\ngive notice, and in exceptional circumstances,  the\r\n\r\nPresident can waive that six months' notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nwant   to   carry   on  this  diatribe   with   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary. I think he  has  to  check\r\n\r\nthat  fact  first because I know  it  from  my  own\r\n\r\nexperience. As a former teacher, I was required  to\r\n\r\nopt  for  full  or reduced pension at  the  outset,\r\n\r\nunless,  of course, the Ministry of Education  made\r\n\r\nthe  mistake of asking me to make the option - that\r\n\r\nprobably is possible -but I doubt that; in spite of\r\n\r\ntheir  inefficiency, they are not likely to make  a\r\n\r\nmistake  like  this  because  this  is  under   the\r\n\r\ndirection  of the Treasury. As one who happened  to\r\n\r\nbe  a  civil servant in the past I am quite certain\r\n\r\nthat  this  is  the  practice. An  officer  is  not\r\n\r\nallowed  to  carry on for 10 or  20  years  of  his\r\n\r\ncareer,  and  finally make that option  six  months\r\n\r\nbefore his retirement. In fact, at the very outset,\r\n\r\nwhen he makes the option, it is very clearly stated\r\n\r\nthat it is irrevocable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I quote\r\n\r\nfrom  clause  15  (1)  of the Pensions  Regulations\r\n\r\nwhich reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`An officer to whom a pension is granted under\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance  may, at his option  exercisable  as\r\n\r\nhereinafter  provided, be paid,  in  lieu  of  such\r\n\r\npension, a pension at the rate of three-fourths  or\r\n\r\nany  greater fraction of such pension together with\r\n\r\na gratuity equal to such number of times the amount\r\n\r\nof  the  reduction  so made in the  pension  as  is\r\n\r\nspecified in paragraph (6) of this regulation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 (2) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The option shall be exercisable, and if it has\r\n\r\nalready  been exercised, may be revoked, not  later\r\n\r\nthan the day immediately preceding the date of such\r\n\r\nofficer's retirement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that if the officer does not exercise\r\n\r\nthe  option prior to the day preceding the date  of\r\n\r\nhis retirement, the President may, if it appears to\r\n\r\nhim  in  all the circumstances equitable so to  do,\r\n\r\nallow  the  officer to exercise the option  at  any\r\n\r\ntime  between the date and the actual date of award\r\n\r\nof a pension to him.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>Does the Member understand that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will\r\n\r\ncontinue  this  controversy with the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary after this session, but the point I  made\r\n\r\nearlier  was  not whether the option is exercisable\r\n\r\nat  the  beginning or at the end of  the  officer's\r\n\r\ncareer. The point I wanted to make was this. In the\r\n\r\nillustration I gave earlier, the officer retires at\r\n\r\nthe  age of 40 years. Then from 40 up to 50,  which\r\n\r\nshould  be his normal retirement age, he  gets  ten\r\n\r\nyears  extra of pension allowance. Therefore,  this\r\n\r\ngives  an added advantage to an officer who  leaves\r\n\r\nthe  service  much  earlier  than  one  who  serves\r\n\r\nfaithfully   until  the  normal   retirement   age.\r\n\r\nTherefore  you  stop  it, and  I  say  there  is  a\r\n\r\nrationale for this. But how does this compare  with\r\n\r\ngratuity? Because whether you give him gratuity  at\r\n\r\nthe age of 40, 45, or 50, it is the same amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance just now mentioned one point, that is, that the value of money today and its value in ten years' time is not the same. My point is, do you think that it is fair that an officer, after having served a number of years and you allow him to\r\n\r\nretire with all the retirement benefits, should not\r\n\r\nbe  given the amount of money that is due to him in\r\n\r\nthe form of a gratuity when the money value is much\r\n\r\nmore than what it will be ten years hence? You  are\r\n\r\nnot  giving him the added advantage hut that  which\r\n\r\nis  rightly his. I do not think it is right for the\r\n\r\nGovernment to prevent him from immediately  getting\r\n\r\nwhat  is  due  to  him as a gratuity.  But  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does  not allow him to  get  a  pension\r\n\r\nimmediately on his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npremature retirement, it is merely saying that  his\r\n\r\nnormal  pension  benefits only start  when  he  has\r\n\r\nattained  the  age  of  50  years.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  not giving him ten years  extra  of\r\n\r\npension benefits. But whether the Government  gives\r\n\r\nhim  the  gratuity before that or after  that,  the\r\n\r\namount  is  still the same. That is my  point,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I really\r\n\r\ncannot  see the logic of the argument of the Member\r\n\r\nfor   Moulmein.  On  the  one  hand,  he   is   not\r\n\r\nquarrelling  about the rationale of  not  paying  a\r\n\r\npension until the officer reaches 50 years of  age.\r\n\r\nOn  the  other  hand, he says we  must  pay  him  a\r\n\r\ngratuity now because the amount paid today  is  the\r\n\r\nsame as the amount paid 20 years hence. Is that the\r\n\r\nMember's  argument? If so, I will  borrow  $100,000\r\n\r\nfrom  him  now  and pay him back  $100,000  in  ten\r\n\r\nyears'  time without any interest. If that  is  his\r\n\r\nargument,  he should have no objection  at  all  to\r\n\r\nlending  me the money. In fact, the whole point  is\r\n\r\nthat $100,000 today is not the same as $100,000  in\r\n\r\nten  years' time, it grows. This is because if  you\r\n\r\nput  $100,000  into a bank drawing eight  per  cent\r\n\r\ninterest  per annum, then every year  you  will  be\r\n\r\nreceiving  $8,000 in interest. And  in  ten  years'\r\n\r\ntime, the amount will double itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  clarify my point. I do not want to  enter\r\n\r\ninto   a  controversy  over  the  value  of   money\r\n\r\nincreasing  or  diminishing in years  to  come.  My\r\n\r\npoint is this. The Government has no moral right to\r\n\r\nuse somebody else's money to make money. Similarly,\r\n\r\nit  cannot say, \"Today, we will not pay in full the\r\n\r\nM.P.s'  allowances, or the Ministers'  salaries  or\r\n\r\nthe  Government servants' salaries. Instead we will\r\n\r\npay them the balance of the money at the end of  so\r\n\r\nmany  years.\"  The Government's point  of  view  is\r\n\r\nquite  different, because it thinks  it  will  earn\r\n\r\ninterest  on it. Making money is a good thing,  but\r\n\r\nthe point is, has the Government the moral right to\r\n\r\ntake  somebody's money that is due to him and  earn\r\n\r\ninterest  on it? I think not only is the Government\r\n\r\nkeen  but  the officer is also keen to get interest\r\n\r\nearned\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom the money put into the bank. But the point is,\r\n\r\nwho  has  the  moral  right to the  money?  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is thinking in terms of paying  him  the\r\n\r\ninterest, I think that is quite fair, because it is\r\n\r\nsaving  the  money for him. If he  is  entitled  to\r\n\r\n$10,000 gratuity, then the figure of $10,000 is the\r\n\r\nsame  due  to  him no matter when he is  given  the\r\n\r\ngratuity.  That is what I meant when I said  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  same amount. But whether the purchasing  power\r\n\r\nof  money  has  diminished or  not  is  a  separate\r\n\r\nmatter. This is the money that is automatically due\r\n\r\nto  him.  You pay him gratuity after he has  earned\r\n\r\nit.  How  can you keep his money and deny  him  not\r\n\r\nonly  the opportunity to earn interest on  it,  but\r\n\r\nyou  also  deny him the chance probably  to  buy  a\r\n\r\nhouse, or the opportunity to make use of the  money\r\n\r\nprofitably.  I think the Government  has  no  moral\r\n\r\nright  to  take  that  opportunity  away  from  the\r\n\r\nofficer concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand the logic of the argument of the Member.\r\n\r\nHe  seems  to be tying himself up in knots.  If  he\r\n\r\nquarrels about the granting of pension as from  the\r\n\r\nage  of  50, all right, that is possibly a question\r\n\r\nof  difference of opinion. But he does not  quarrel\r\n\r\nabout that at all. He quarrels about the fact  that\r\n\r\nwe are not giving officers a gratuity on retirement\r\n\r\nday, irrespective of whether the officer reaches 50\r\n\r\nyears  of age or not. The Member sees it from  only\r\n\r\none  point  of  view. But there is also  the  other\r\n\r\npoint of view. He is like a horse wearing blinkers,\r\n\r\nSir!

Actually I need hardly answer the Member for Kampong Kapor, as the only point he raised was the increment in salaries. This is already in force in Government departments as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwell   as  in  statutory  boards.

Surely, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis has nothing to do with pensions. I think it is\r\n\r\nonly  fair  that if everybody who joins  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  is  required  to  undergo  a  probationary\r\n\r\nperiod,  then the same condition should also  apply\r\n\r\nto  national  servicemen, even after completion  of\r\n\r\ntheir national service, because in any case they do\r\n\r\nnot lose out at all. This means that everybody goes\r\n\r\non probation for a certain period. If we make it an\r\n\r\nexception for national servicemen, they would  have\r\n\r\nan  advantage.
